His grip around the phone immediately tightens. He stares at the comment for a second, his heart beating violently. His smile is gone.
“Oh,” Cas gave a mumbled answer that the woman probably couldn’t even hear, with all the chatter going on around them.
"Wow," Cas managed to breathe. He had never exactly thought about how a place like this would look like, but what he was looking at right now definitely was impressive.
After several minutes of staring at one sentence and not being able to think about anything else than Dean and his worthiness of being immortalized in a poem, I put the current essay back on top of the stack and leaned back with a sigh. I stared at the wall across the room for a second, then I grabbed my notebook out of my bag and opened it at a blank page in the back.
So, the day went by without him talking to anyone, and especially not to Dean. He spent some time watching TV, very quietly though because of Claire's headache, and that was pretty much all he did before he gave his daughter one final portion of medicine and tucked her in for a whole night's sleep, telling her to wake him up whenever something was wrong.
Jo had gotten her some finger paint, and Cas had been okay with it, as long as she'd only use them with him around. Now that was the part that Claire didn't seem very content with, because she constantly tried snatching them when he was busy and run off to start another artwork.
And maybe, that should be the reason not to come. Their pretend relationship was one thing, and Cas tried his best to not let anything that happened in that context get too close to him, but that didn't change the fact that he really enjoyed spending time with Dean, that he felt comfortable on Dean's arm or holding his hand, and that he absolutely loved his kisses.
"Good," Dean said. "Yeah, good. It's ... I mean, it's kinda weird, and I'm hella nervous, because we ... like, I thought, we've done all that before, with the kissing and the touching for the cameras, but ..."
That conversation was yet another thing Dean and Cas didn't mention again. Though this time it didn't give Cas the impression that Dean was avoiding to talk about it, it seemed to be more like there was nothing left to say. Dean had shared all that with him, he really wouldn’t have had to, but he chose to tell Cas about his struggles. He trusted him enough to share this personal trouble with him, and that was another thing for Cas to think about.
"Yeah," Cas returned the smile. "Oh it's good that I see you actually," he pulled out a little bag from under the desk, "here"
“So, what kind of tradition were you thinking about?” Dean asked now that they were standing there, still holding hands.
"You knew that, Castiel," he said quietly. "From the very beginning. It was clear ever since that he'll have to go"
Fair enough, the second player had been there from the very beginning – I just hadn’t realized he was in the game. All this time I had thought, or had rather tried to convince myself, that it was just me. That Dean was that your average heterosexual male in his mid-20s, that we were just being friends. Maybe not even friends but instead rather the only two colleagues close in age who spent their free time together for the sake of social interaction.
We didn’t talk much on the walk back to the school. I obviously was in thoughts, still trying to rationalize that this was really happening, and I assumed he was doing the same. So, we walked in silence, holding hands and enjoying each other’s company.
Cas grasped the idea of what to do quite quickly and got to work with the pdf that was already on his laptop. Before he started checking the lyrics, though, he scrolled through the whole thing once to have a look at the design. When he reached the second to last page, he stopped.
She looked over to him. Her eyes immediately gravitated towards his hands on the wheel, and as she saw the ring, the biggest grin wandered over her face.
Dean saw how eager Cas was to do well with his new task and agreed to let him focus on it for now, and he really did have other things to do as well than being touchy with Cas all the time.
"I see," he smiled. "Yeah, she's Jo, old friend of mine and responsible for all sorts of administration, licensing, and record label stuff."
"Tempting," Cas said, "But I don't even know what this mysterious job-not-in-the-classic-sense is about"
We stood there like that for a little longer, him holding me, our foreheads and noses touching. Then, we sat down on the small couch in the back of the room together.
"No," he sighed. Not talking about it didn't even describe what they had been doing, acting like it had never happened.
The place where Dean had stopped lay at the foot of the hill. We were standing right below an old tree, its empty branches were hanging above our heads, no more leaves on them but still heavy from the load of snow they were carrying.
Yes, Claire was extremely happy with how that day went so far, and as a way of expressing her happiness, she started jumping on Cas's side.
"Yeah," Dean said with a smile. "You should bring her again. In a while, when we're finished with all the album stress. She really seemed to have a great time the last time she was here"
"Yes he does," she said with a look straight into his eyes. "Jesus Christ Cas, he's head over heels in love with you. He wrote a song about the colour of your eyes, you can't be that oblivious!"
"If you wanna call it that, maybe. In a very limited way, of course. I really wouldn't ask much of you in that aspect. Obviously you gotta be okay with being physically close to me, but I wouldn't take advantage of this agreement. I wouldn't make you do anything inappropriate, of course not."
"No, Castiel. I won't. You're good at what you do, your classes always do well and I have experienced you as a responsible and trustworthy teacher so far. You are a win for this school."
"Mh," Dean made, "not really. It's a coffee date, so that's what we're gonna do. We'll get a table outside so we definitely can be seen, have coffee, talk. It shouldn't be much different from our usual lunchbreaks. Just go with what seems plausible for the situation"
"Okay," Cas said with a look straight at Dean. He had been prepared for this, but he still was nervous about it.
- and faced Dean. He had just stepped out of the bench two rows behind me and was now looking at me. For a change, not with a smile but with a rather serious expression instead.
James Price was the school's principal, a man in his mid-fifties. He didn't have much hair left, and the most prominent detail about his face were the reading glasses he always wore right on the tip of his nose and pushed further up whenever he needed them. Overall, he did an okay job as a principal. For my taste he was always just a bit too focused on pleasing the rich parents of our students and a bit too little on their actual best education, but we got along since he always was happy with my work and I had learned very early to keep my opinions to myself. It wasn't a hard thing to do. I kept a huge part of my personality locked away at all times, keeping my mouth shut about a little disagreement in school management was a trivial task.
It was an ordinary day at work for me. I knew that a new teacher would arrive sooner or later, a substitute for a colleague from the P.E. department who had been unlucky enough to break his leg only a month into the new school year. So, I knew we would get a new colleague shortly, but I didn't know who he was, or that he would arrive that day.
"That's fine," Cas agreed, "we can come by right in the morning and then leave you to your work for the rest of the day"
Inside his own room, there was only a dimmed light on. Claire was peacefully asleep in the bed, wound up in the blanket that was way too big for her.
Several minutes later, I finally stopped. I tried to articulate a clear line about what I asked for, then ended my silent prayer with a just as silent “Amen”.
There was a photographer wandering around, strangely contrasted from everyone else in his jeans and black shirt, who shot pictures of various guests and didn’t spare Dean and Cas either. Cas had watched some others pose for photos, and that had made him insecure about how to behave, but when the man with the camera approached them, Dean leaned in and kissed Cas's cheek at the exact right moment, solving that problem.
a job? I mean it's your decision, but I was sceptical about it ever since I first heard about the idea. But everyone else seemed convinced, and I'm not PR, so who am I to complain."
With half the page covered in keywords about Dean, I stopped and looked at my notes again. I read the words, then read them again, and again.
“Yes,” Dean agreed with me, “It could be, probably, but so far we’re rather good at finding ways to entertain ourselves”
"Yeah," Cas confirmed. He had mentioned that at their first-day conversation, he remembered. He had mentioned that once, only once, and Dean still remembered it?
Dean eyed Cas for a moment with an unknown glance of emotion in his eyes that Cas couldn't exactly define, then he nodded.
"Well I didn't," Dean explained, "Originally. This was planned in like three weeks’ time. But there were some problems with the booking of the recording studio and we could've either switched it to this week or one more back, and back didn't work for me at all because of the album recordings, so I was told yesterday that I gotta be down in L.A. tomorrow morning the latest, and here we are."
Dean then quickly showed them around the ground floor. Apart from Jo's office and the meeting room Cas had already seen there was a small kitchen, toilets, another office - this one with four desks inside, at one of them they saw Charlie typing away on her computer -, one room that looked rather like a break room to Cas with two couches and a few beanbag chairs in it, but Dean explained they used it to sit down together and brainstorm in an environment more relaxed like the meeting room.
Right on the way there - they were walking together, Cas on Dean's arm, as it wasn't that for from their hotel - Cas noticed multiple pedestrians stopping and turning around after passing them or people glancing over to them with that kind of recognizing expression.
"So," Cas started as he put his bag down and took off his jacket, "I just ran into Dean acting like he's high off his ass, what's gotten into him?"
"Yeah," he shrugged. "I still don't understand why Dean told me to take the break if he knew he was working on another song that stressed everyone out, but yeah"
"I already said," Dean said honestly, "I promise. I know this isn't the world for a child, and I won't drag her into it."
"If everything's fine," Cas said calmly, "then why aren't you talking to me? You're not even looking at me"
"Details," Jo smirked, and Cas chuckled before he went into telling her about his experiences with Dean and his kisses, deliberately leaving out the part about his heart racing dangerously fast whenever Dean's lips brushed against his.
"What you said," he hesitantly started asking a question, "on the phone, earlier. About the negative articles, and that jilted ex making comments … what’s it with that?"
After a while, Dean asked Cas if they should end this now, and with a glance at his watch, Cas immediately agreed. Missouri knew he had variable work hours, but he still tried to keep up a somewhat regular schedule for Claire, and even though it was later than usual already, he'd still be able to pick her up at an okay time if they'd left now.
Then, he felt a slight brush against the same cheek. It wasn't even a kiss, he knew that, he felt that it wasn't Dean's lips, but he understood what Dean had done there. The both of them knew that hadn't been a kiss, but the other two men in the room didn't. From their perspective, that must have definitely looked like a kiss on the cheek.
"Fine," Cas chuckled. He was trying really hard right now to not burst. One, because he could not believe they were having this conversation just now, and two, because she was absolutely right and Dean was exactly his type, but he hadn't thought she'd be so aware of that, and more importantly, her pointing it out just like that made him think about what he had gotten himself into, and maybe that agreement with Dean wouldn't be that much fun after all.
"Alright," another voice suddenly interrupted. It was Jo, who was now standing in the aisle right next to them, holding onto Charlie's seat. Cas hadn't noticed her walking back to them, he had been way too focused on Dean and his so incredibly beautiful eyes.
"Maybe you should ask him," Charlie said as if she knew about his thoughts. "I'm pretty sure he'd tell you about it. And you kinda should know some stuff about him. As his boyfriend"
Dean performed the song one more time, this time he was visibly having fun doing it, and turned to Cas with a happy grin after he had finished. With an energetic high five he told Cas that he had done great work on this.
The others greeted Cas happily as well, Jo, Charlie and Garth were there that day, and Cas got news on the album right when he entered the office.
"Uhm," Dean made, and for some reason, Cas had the impression he had been blushing while answering that question. "Yeah. I've never given a single comment on those rumours, but by now it's pretty obvious, right? So I might just as well clear up on that right now and say that he's my boyfriend"
“I mean,” he said, “Even though I like the red ones and the yellow ones equally in general, right now, there is this one red M&M in particular, that I
While he was walking around, he could hear Dean explaining things to Claire. He could hear discordant sounds coming from the keyboard, and Claire laughing, then more sounds. Dean entertained the girl for quite a while at the keyboard, and when Cas had finished his own little tour she still was sitting on Dean's knee typing around on the keys with two fingers, laughing and giggling at the sounds it made. He stood behind them again, watching them for a bit longer, until he turned at the sound of the door opening.
He decided to go look for Dean, and found him upstairs in the studio by himself. Ed and Harry weren't there as all of their recordings were finished so far and they, just like Cas, didn't have any more work to do for now.
There were dozens more talks with guests, followed by a quick interview and photo of Dean and Lexie by the press person, then more talks with guests, and during all that time, Dean didn't say another word to Cas, didn't even look at him. He did his pretending for the people and cameras, sure, he did his smiling and holding Cas, but he didn't say a single word.
“Oh no, you definitely are,” he chuckled. “Though, you’re the one who asked me to buy you a drink, remember? I’m only keeping my promise”
He’s aware of course that just because Cas is probably gay, that doesn’t mean he has to be into Dean. Cas could just as well be gay and not be interested in him at all, Dean knows that, and it’s one of his fears: Telling Cas about all his thoughts, telling him about his sexuality and his confusing feelings, just to have Cas tell him he doesn’t like him that way. That would hurt. It would hurt a lot.
It wasn’t a lot that I prayed for, and still I stayed there for over an hour. I kept repeating and reformulating my thoughts, maybe in an attempt to find an answer myself, maybe simply because I didn’t know what to do and just needed to get it out. After a while, my knees started to hurt, but I stayed as I was, I didn’t stop. I kept praying.
He would have to, eventually. But not right now. And that seemed to be a pattern with his decision that day, because he thought the same thing about the overdue conversation with Dean. Not right now.
"Sure," Dean smiled. "Would have to be before lunch though, I have a conference scheduled in the afternoon"
"Yes," Dean said, "but look, you've seen them. All the time, right? So, you just remember them, okay? Can you do that?"
"I don't know," Cas sighed. "Maybe, yeah. I just ... I'm just scared, you know? Because I don't know what's gonna happen, and I have so little control over everything that's happening, and he ..."
"No, but that's the thing," Cas breathed, "I don't want to end it. I want him, because he's amazing, really he's just mindblowing in everything he does, he's everything I ever dreamed of, and he's so great with Claire, and I ... he really could be it, you know?"
A couple minutes later, Dean had gotten ice cream for each of them and they were sitting outside the ice cream shop at one of the small tables there. Cas kept Claire on his lap, holding her close to make sure she wouldn't wander off. At the moment that was an unnecessary precaution, since the little girl was as happy as somehow possible and sat in peaceful calm, focused on her ice cream.
"Well," Jo said and he could hear the smirk in her voice, "that really depends on what outcome you're hoping for. Could be a good reason to join him just as well"
I couldn’t help chuckling at that. Yes, I thought, you got the handsome genes for sure. If that wasn’t the handsome genes that I didn’t know what was.
"I never said it has to be a one-night stand," Jo replied. "Who knows what it could be, or what it could become after the first step"
Dean Winchester, the most beautiful man I had ever met with the most beautiful face I had ever seen? What was the fresh green of grass on a summer’s day compared to the infinite green of Dean Winchester’s eyes? What was the heat of the sun on a summer’s day compared to the warmth that Dean Winchester’s smile made me feel, compared to the heat he was able to arouse in my entire body?
Cas looked after her for a second. She hadn't said anything, he thought. But she must have heard them, they had been right next door, and Cas was aware of how loud they had been. How loud
Cas read that note, and he read the lyrics again that said Dean wanted to spend the rest of his life with him, and he smiled. He smiled, and he pulled out another blue post-it.
That was my first time with Dean; and despite it being rushed and of very short duration, it was wonderful. The second time was just as wonderful. The third time was incredible, and the fourth one even better.
"Mh, I see," Charlie said. "Well, we generally don't have strict work hours. Both the texting and the music depend on talking through stuff with the team, of course, so you should be there when everyone else is, but we're always rather flexible about the meetings if someone really can't make it. I suggest discussing that with Dean and Garth, who's working on the lyrics as well, and agree with them. And I think we won't be strict on you, especially not the first couple days. You just gotta be there at all. And as for your kid, when you're out acting with Dean, you totally can leave her here. I get that finding someone for her at random irregular times can be hard, and when we get you in on short notice, it's only fair if one of us looks after her while you're out playing heart-eyes for our publicity"
This was the moment. The one perfect moment, and we both knew it. But I knew just as well he wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t, because this wasn’t his choice to make. It was on me. If I wanted anything to happen right now, if I wanted anything to happen with him, this was my chance. This was my perfect chance to let him know.
. Dean was sitting there on his stool, the microphone on its stand right in front of him, guitar in his hands as he was playing the soft chords accompanied by Ed and Harry in the background, and singing the lines that he usually performed with that sparkle in his eyes and that smile at Cas. This time, though, Cas wasn't there, and Dean's eyes scanned his audience as he sang those words that Cas now knew were all about him.
“No,” I chuckled. “He’s quite busy over the holidays. This is pretty much the busiest time of the year for him and I really don’t want to bother him when he’s got mass after mass to hold. And there’s not really any other family, so I stay here.”
"Don't touch your face," he said softly as she looked at him in confusion, "if you get the paint in your eyes, it hurts."
just there, and I got no control over that. So yeah, I know that I'm in control, but what I also know is that abuse is a cycle, and if I make no other good choice, I still can make the choice to break that cycle"
I saw somebody standing there on the main street, only a couple of steps away from us. The person – it was a man, I was rather sure of that – was wearing a dark coat and a hat, their face hidden in the shadow of the street lamp, though obviously watching us.
"Yeah," Dean sighed and leaned back, "well. I told you earlier, I got an awful lot of press lately. One could say that I got sort of an image problem. Small one, but it's there, and I really don't want it to grow any bigger"
But what he was actually looking at right now was not like that at all. Dean was well built, of course he was, and there absolutely were muscles visible but you couldn't call it a six pack, and he didn't look exceptionally trained or movie-star-like, he just looked ... normal.
And then, he started moving them, started to seek his way around my lips. Softly nibbled on my bottom lip, silently asking for permission to be let inside.
He can't help but smile at the familiar little icon, and his smile gets even bigger as he opens the blog and faces the header that is just as familiar, as well as the description. It's nothing special, and definitely nothing personal. Just your average tumblr blog. What makes Castiel smile is not that blog itself, but rather the thought of the person behind it.
"Yeah," Dean agreed, a smile on him as well. "Maybe it really was from the exhaustion, and she just needed some rest. This is a lot, after all, and she's only 5"
With a little smile, Cas let a last glance wander over the page. Then, he walked over to Jo's office and left it on Dean's desk, and after a chat with Jo - that might have not been that quick - he returned to his other work that was still waiting for him.
“Thank you for reading,” I finally managed to turn back into a teacher. “Now, this is Shakespeare’s Sonnet 18. A typical Shakespearean, or English, Sonnet. The characteristics of which are? Mr. Hughes?”
"Okay," Dean repeated. "Under given circumstances, making out. This time including tongue kisses, anything in terms of mouth on skin - fully dressed of course, therefore meaning mostly neck. Alongside with that, the physical closeness that comes with making out, also hands on your body, excluding the ... private areas."
When they separated again, Dean gave him another intense look, and that smirk. Cas knew that smirk, he had seen it a thousand times already.
It hadn’t necessarily been my plan to tell him on that walk. I just liked spending time with him in general, and I really enjoyed having the chance to have more personal conversations with him in the romantic sort of atmosphere that those walks created.
Dean turned to shoot his younger brother an annoyed glance. "You know what, Sam, you said you were gonna get us food. It's about time for that, don't you think?"
Dean chuckled, and Cas immediately started gripping the rubber band harder. He was nervous. He knew that Dean was in control of the situation, and that this was a pre-recorded interview that he didn't have the slightest control over right now, but he was nervous.
Time truly had flown by. It felt like just yesterday when she had been just a baby. She had grown up so much, and so incredibly fast, especially those most recent few years.
“Dean,” I said his name in a calm voice, as calm as possible given my rising panic. “Don’t apologize for it. It’s not just your fault. I should have stopped you, but I didn’t. It’s just as much my fault.”
. I really did try, and to a certain extent, it worked. I was able to ban Dean out of my mind for the duration of a lesson, but that didn’t mean that I wasn’t still lying awake every night debating if I should give it a chance. Give him, give
He then tried to think, well, maybe he did, but at the same time, they were becoming friends. And that didn't really make sense to him either, but on the other hand,
People were still talking about the video, and those who had seen it made posts about how that obviously was the same girl that had been in the very first photo of Dean with Cas, but some things got divided into multiple rumours and since there was no more video evidence, it got rather confusing after a while for everyone involved that hadn't seen it with their own eyes.
I was 27 years old when I first met him. It was late October, a mild fall day that I will never forget. The trees on the yard were covered in leaves that were shining in their most beautiful colours; those that had fallen down already had been spread across the grass by the wind. It was a beautiful atmosphere, almost romantic.
"Dean!" the Angel exclaimed with a relieved look in his deep blue eyes. "I came as fast as I could after I got your message! Are you alright?"
So when Dean grabbed his wrist and pulled him out of the elevator, Cas let him. He let Dean pull him through the empty hallway of the hotel that they were crossing with brisk steps, and he let Dean pull him inside the room after he had hastily pulled out his key card.
After a while, Dean looked up as well. Probably he had started to feel my gaze on him. He looked up, looked back at me in silence for a moment.
Shortly after, they reached the café. Dean asked the waitress that was just walking by them for an outside table, and they were assigned one off to the side, right next to the flower boxes that were functioning as a little fence separating the outside area from the street. Dean guided Cas on how to sit down, and they took their seats with their backs to the café's windows, facing the open with a good view over the people passing by - and at the same time, giving people a good view on them.
, and only a second later, Dean opened the door and they stepped out into the corridor hand in hand.
On the way home, Claire hopped excitedly along the street by Cas's hand while telling him in detail about all the instruments Dean had let her try and the things he'd shown and taught her. Cas listened to her happy description and made some comments now and then, asked questions about what Dean had said and if she remembered everything, and while doing so, he really got convinced that Dean was definitely amazing with children, and it seemed like he was a really nice guy overall.
There wasn't much to see yet as they still had time until the show tomorrow night, but the empty concert hall with just a couple of stage building people going around doing their job had an impressive feeling to it that fascinated both Claire and Cas.
"That's fair," the moderator said. "Will there be a certain theme for the new songs, just like your last one went with sort of a western, cowboy vibe?"
all the time. Especially because it wasn't even true in the first place. It just wasn't any of the internet's business."
Without a word, I pulled my hands out of my pocket. I immediately felt the ice-cold air on my warm skin as I held them out in between us, open, inviting.
Right after she had said it, the office door was opened and Dean stormed inside, looking as good as always with a bag over his shoulder and a cup of take-away coffee in his hand.
“Dean, we talked about this before,” I laughed. “You’re teaching P.E., you really shouldn’t be complaining about having to take some stairs”
At some point, as my head almost started aching from thinking about it so much, I pulled out my notebook and opened the page in the back that had my notes about Dean and the poem on it. I stared at it for a while, then sat done the pen and added one more word to the page:
"Okay," Cas said in a calm voice, "okay, Claire, we got this, okay? We're just gonna ..." he carefully picked up the blue cup and put the lid back on the keep the rest of paint that was still inside exactly where it was, "... look, we make sure nothing else spills out, and then we clean this up, and it's okay, yeah?"
That was the moment when the meeting room door was opened and Charlie came in, only to stop right away and eye the both of them with visible irritation.
“First of all,” I said calmly, “It is not, as I said before. And second of all, nobody is losing their job, so the sheer discussion of the idea is, frankly, a waste of time”
Dean gave him another smile and slightly changed his position, moved his legs over from the coffee table to the couch, then he turned back to his notes. They sat there on the couch together in silence, both focused on their own little things, their legs touching in-between them, their feet softly stroking the other one from time to time.
And he started telling her about that night, about what had happened and about their awkward silence the day after, about the talk they finally had had and about the outcome, about Dean, about his boyfriend.
"I, uhm ..." Cas now started hesitantly, "I got another question. Organizational, if that's alright"
Every time Cas looked at him, he thought, despite his age, he was still the same man. Still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.
Dean didn't explicitly answer, but his eyes said it all. It was. It was all true, Cas finally understood. Dean was in love with him, and the lyrics of that goddamn schmaltzy love song that people were waving their phones’ flashlights to at the concerts were about him. Every word in that song was about him.
"Amazon, really?" Dean chuckled. "Back in my day, if you needed a cheap dress, you either sewed your own or borrowed one. No, seriously, Cas. I get that, and I didn't want to bring you into this for that exact reason. And I'm sorry to ask that from you, I really am, but I need you in there"
With his eyes closed, Dean pulled back again. He wanted to look at Cas, oh how much he wanted to, but at the same time he was just way too scared to see any signs of rejection on his face, in his eyes.
Maybe I could have known right then and there. I could have overthought that very first handshake as much as I overthought everything else about this man for the following months, and I probably would have gotten to the conclusion that it was just a fraction of a second too long for a brand-new-colleagues handshake.
"Thank you," Dean said with an honest expression. "Then that directly leads to the other part, things that I can't ask you for, and - as Charlie here wanted me to phrase it -
Cas's smile had grown wider and wider with every word he had read. By now, he had gotten used to Dean writing songs about him. That by far wasn't the first time, it wasn't even the second or the third anymore. He had gotten used to it, yes, but it still gave him that feeling that was so difficult to explain.
I got the answer to my questions sooner than I wished for. As I was standing in front of the Chapel next to Dean the following Sunday morning, exhausted after a sleepless night full of worries and mass in a cold chapel with dean next to me, both obviously not listening to a word that was said but hanging in our own thoughts, our countless worries instead, I suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder.
The one whose name had been called was currently standing on a ladder in the doorway to the library, busy at work over his head, trying to attach a mistletoe.
“Do you want it quick?” I asked. Somehow we both stopped moving as I asked that. Dean looked down into my eyes for a second before he answered.
“Huh?” he made. Nothing more than that. He was still looking at her, an eyebrow raised, surprised and admittedly more than a bit irritated by that conversation starter.
"Yeah," Cas said quietly. "I get that. But it's just ... sometimes you can't have it all. Gotta make sacrifices. And I think if you're making sacrifices for something that's really important to you ... if it makes you the happiest, it's probably worth it"
They both turned their faces to the other one at the exact same time. Their eyes locked, and the moment around them froze.
As I was working on the last few questions, my mind started drifting away. I looked up and watched Dean for a bit, sitting there concentrated on his book. He really was reading at that moment, I could tell by his eyes slightly moving along with the lines.
like Cas … Dean is scared of unknowingly “faking it”, he’s scared of misinterpreting his own thoughts and feelings, and he’s so so scared of hurting Cas, breaking his heart and losing him as his friend.
"Yeah," Garth replied. "Hell of a risky idea, if you ask me. He stormed in with it when you were gone just like a day. I had to pull an all-nighter on it to meet the deadline."
Cas hadn't thought they'd really use up the entire day for this, but they ended up needing every second. The adjustment of the lights and positions took some time between every couple of shots, and because of some disagreement on which pose looked the best, they did different ones to have the options.
With his thoughts still drifting off now and then, Cas now finally got into his actual work. He was almost finished with the lyrics he was currently working on. His first draft of reviewing Dean's text had been finished rather quickly, and from then on he had changed details here and there and adjusted some rhymes. He even had started thinking about the texts at random times and then hustling to scribble an idea down. That was, according to Garth, a good development - or at least something he did as well, and that was good enough to make Cas feel like he was doing a decent job.
There were his feelings, his very real feelings that didn't give a damn about the relationship being fake, and there was Dean with his illegally handsome face and his freckles and that incredible smile, and there was everything that had happened so far that made Cas think that maybe he shouldn't be close to Dean, for his own good.
Of course we found ways. But telling our boss in right front of the Church on Christmas Eve that we were not bored at all because we had been at it like rabbits ever since the break had started probably wouldn’t have been the best decision.
He didn't really want to. Sure, sometimes he missed the times when his face wasn't going around in a snippet of a picture on Twitter. Grocery shopping had become harder as well with mostly teenagers recognising him now and then, and even though they always had been respectful so far and hadn't bothered him, he still had noticed they knew who he was.
"No, it's, uhm ... not as a teacher. Something ... yeah, something new. Something really new to me, really entirely new. But I'm not sure about how much I can tell you right now."
A nameplate right next to the door indicated they were at the right address, since it had the same name on it that Cas had already heard on the phone. With Claire by his hand he stepped up the two steps to the door and rang the bell.
! It wasn't so much when I had to clean up her and the entire room. I still got stains on the floor!"
Claire understood that, and after Cas told her to try and sleep some more, she actually dozed away again.
"Actually," Dean now said, "Your Daddy and I were talking about what you would like to do today to make it the most amazing birthday. And what do you think, would you like to make some music with me?"
I couldn’t believe that someone like Dean, someone so beautiful, someone with that face and that body, would like me.
"What, nothing?" Cas chuckled. "You were singing, weren't you? Is that another new song? I thought we were finished?"
If I had ever wholeheartedly agreed with William Shakespeare in my life, it was in that very moment. Because when I listened to my student talking about how the lover is so beautiful not even a summer’s day can compare, I revisited that image of Dean Winchester in my mind and immediately thought, “Yes”.
I smiled back at him, about to answer but I was interrupted by Charles, one of the colleagues from the maths department who was sitting on Dean’s right hand side. They must have talked a bit before I arrived, I thought. Of course. A new colleague suddenly appearing at the breakfast table, it would have been weird for him to not introduce himself and make some small talk.
"Charity event," Dean explained shortly. "I would've gone alone because there's gonna be press for sure, but we got this situation and I don't wanna risk another snarky article about me showing up somewhere alone"
"Yeah," Jo said with a smile, "fuck them. So about your new job, it's a if-I-tell-you-I-have-to-kill-you kind of thing?"
"I'd love to hold your hand," he whispered into the Angel’s ear, "I want to hug you, and I want to kiss you. And I ..." Here he paused and swallowed down his nervousity before feeling ready to continue, "I think I love you, Cas"
"I, uhm ..." he stuttered and nervously ran his hand through his hair. "God, I don't know. To be completely honest with you, Dean, I just don't know. All this, it's ... it's so confusing to me, and I'm nervous about it, and I ... I know what I agreed to, of course. But I just don't know. I can't promise you that if you kiss me tomorrow, I will be able to stay in character. I don't know if I will."
Cas chuckled. "I did," he said, "but I wouldn't have done it if Jo hadn't told me to. Because we're both absolute idiots and it took Jo intervening for me to understand that it's not unrequited"
When Dean heard the door open, he looked up and as he saw Cas, he immediately stopped and put the guitar down on the stand next to him.
"Because of you?" Cas asked. There was something, he remembered, something about Dean having to look after his brother a lot.
Dean looked up from the list and met his eyes. "General rule is, same rights for both of us. Only difference, I make the big decisions about what we're doing with the situation. The little every-day things, you're free to initiate as well. Like taking my hand, leaning into me, that's things you can do freely. But when we're talking things like, for example, making out in public. Either I initiate it, or I tell you to do it, but you don't do it on your own. When we're doing anything, there's the same limits for you as for me"
Dean took a few of those pushes before he tapped Cas's hand in his hair, and Cas got the signal to let him go.
Only a second later, Dean could feel Cas's hand on his waist, pulling him closer. His heart racing, he leaned into Cas's touch.
For a moment, none of us said a word. We were just standing there on the cold, empty street, staring at each other. Dean’s face was still pale in shock, and I probably didn’t look any different.
With a deep sigh, I answered. “I’m scared of the consequences,” I explained quietly, with an honest look into his eyes. “I’m scared of what happens when the wrong person finds out that I like the
He waited quietly until Cas had hit send at the email, then he put the two pages down on the desk and sticked another one of his green post-its to Cas's forehead.
Cas was laughing into the camera, and Dean was right, the lighting really made his eyes shine here, made the blue even more intense than it already was naturally. Dean was right next to him, kissing Cas's cheek with a happy expression. His freckles were standing out about as much as Cas's eyes, though Cas was sure that if Dean's eyes hadn't been closed in the picture as he softly was kissing Cas's cheek, the green would have been even more outstanding than anything else.
“Okay,” he then breathed, and before I got the chance to say anything else, he had closed my mouth with a kiss already.
And then, the big day came. Cas woke Claire up at the usual time and wished her a happy birthday the first thing after she had opened her eyes. Hearing that, she immediately was wide awake and jumped into her father's arms.
My hands folded and eyes closed, I started formulating all my fears and insecurities into coherent thoughts, hoping that God or just
"Yeah," Cas chuckled, "And don't act like you didn't know that. Acting so innocent when we both know you came here hoping to get dinner"
Cas wanted to give his best in this, for both parts of his new job. And he wanted to be professional about it, he really wanted to be, in order to work towards the best possible future for Claire, and for himself.
“Alright, but you decided to move two states over for a couple of months, to be a P.E. substitute?” I formulated the part I couldn’t follow on.
"Yes, Daddy," Claire said, and Cas quickly kissed her head before he stood back up and turned to Dean with a smile.
Well, Garth wasn't physically there, because, as Cas had learned from Charlie last week, he did take work home a lot. Everyone seemed okay with that, and Cas really understood where he was coming from when he later told him that he worked better in his own little atmosphere.
“I like it better when I can hear you,” Dean whispered into my ear as he was holding me afterwards, both of us enjoying the afterglow before having to let go.
I knew that wasn’t what it was, but for some reason, it felt like being asked on a date. And I knew I shouldn’t think about it that way, not even for a second, but I did anyway. I allowed my mind to pretend, for just a moment, that this hot piece of man with the beautiful face and the freckles and the incredible green eyes had just asked me on a date. For just a moment, I lived in a world where something like that wasn’t impossible, where I could be myself, could be open about my sexuality, about my attraction towards him, a world where I could go on a date with my hot new colleague without having to fear losing my job because of it.
"Do want him to be around a lot?" Cas asked back, even though he was already pretty sure to know the answer.
Then he turned back to Cas. "That's great. Because we were talking, and officially, you're gonna be a lyricist. And if you wanna, you can actually be for real. Because we're not gonna fill a full time job with acting in front of some paparazzi."
"Dean," Cas said softly and took Dean's hand in his. "We talked about this. I know what I'm agreeing to"
Why exactly, he didn't really know. It just felt right in his gut. Well, and of course he could use the money. After two months of unemployment, he really
Back at home, he left Claire alone with her toys for a bit and filed his brand new employment documents. He wasn't exactly sure what to expect from his first day at work tomorrow, or from that whole unusual agreement in general, but he wasn't feeling too bad about it. Nervous, maybe. But it wasn't a bad feeling.
At this point, I had never kissed a single person in my entire life; I never even been any close to it. The reason for that was quite simple: The only people I had ever wanted to kiss had always been men.
"I'm sure Missouri would be happy to take her to the playground even if you're just at home vacuuming"
"Alright," she sighed. He knew that she knew he lied, but she didn't mention it and he was thankful for that. "Are you sure that's what you wanna do?"
"Well I don't know," she chuckled, "you've had an album release and multiple sold out shows tonight, maybe that sparks some positivity?"
So, Cas walked over to Charlie, carefully stepping over various cables, trying not to trip over anything.
Cas on his part took a moment to let his eyes wander over Dean's body. He'd never seen him like this before, and maybe he'd imagined it, yes, but not like that. He'd thought of Dean as that photoshopped teen idol with a six pack and not an ounce of fat on his body, even though Cas didn't even particularly like that, he had just thought Dean was, because he was a star, right? He just had to.
While her and Dean were off for the interview, Cas was in a relaxed position on the couch in Jo's office, Jo over at her desk chair, and both of them were quietly listening to the music on the radio station, waiting for the interview to air.
Then, Dean was suddenly right there. He leaned in and suddenly was so close to Cas, his face so close to Cas's, their noses almost touching.
“I mean,” he said, his incredible green eyes still staring into mine, “That liking both options is pretty much what I do. You know?”
"We're gonna go into the store right behind you," Dean now said calmly. "You best carry her just like that"
"Don't mention it," Dean smiled. "Though, what I actually came here for, I wanted to ask you something"
But the kiss, a little voice in his head tried to argue again and again, what was that about? It doesn't matter, he always silenced it, he doesn't like me back.
"Yeah," Dean said. "Yeah, and that got to me, because you really meant it. God. You got no idea how little people actually mean it when they compliment me"
Dean had said he would give me some more time, and he really did. And not only did he give me time, he also was incredibly sweet about it.
For now, though, his sick daughter was Cas's priority. And given all his doubts and worries concerning Dean, sitting with her on the bed and watching over her seemed a lot better to him than going down to breakfast.
He opened a new tab and visited the twitter website. Dean Winchester in the search field, sorting by most recent, and go. There were very recent tweets, only a few seconds old, just talking about Dean and his music, random comments that Cas wasn't really interested in. But then, further down, in a post from this afternoon, Cas saw himself.
“Yes,” I answered. There was a separate building in the back, housing the teachers. A small apartment, no rent to pay, it got cut directly from the salary. A few of the older colleagues, those with families, lived down in the village, but most of us stayed right there at the school. “It’s convenient. Most of us do, actually. Will you be living here as well?”
Claire obeyed and stayed in bed, the towel on her forehead. Her cheeks were red as well, he noticed. Really not what they needed right now.
So, I didn’t push him away. Instead, I chuckled and even leaned into him a bit further. Taking the hint, Dean continued. He freed the grip he had on my arm and put his arm around my waist instead, pulling me even closer. For a few steps, we walked like that. Then, his hand wandered down my back, down to my ass.
Dean had become such a permanent part of my life, he was there so much, and even when he wasn’t around, I still had him on my mind all the time - Just like I did that moment as I was walking around the hallway, chewing on my M&Ms with relish. There were only a few left in the pack by now since I had subconsciously grabbed one after another and put it into my mouth while daydreaming about Dean yet again.
Dean gave Cas's hand a soft squeeze alongside a supportive smile, a gesture that signalled something like
They arrived at the venue rather early, Cas had the impression it probably was because everyone was nervous about this being the first show. Especially Dean seemed nervous. He was fidgeting around backstage, and at some point even Claire seemed to be calmer than him.
One of those things was, keeping our relationship secret at all costs and never, not under any circumstances, doing anything suspicious in public.
them, like she's constantly all over them. But she's not allowed to use them when I'm not there, for, you know, furniture reasons"
Then, finally, a message from Dean pops up. For a second, Castiel feels like he'd pass out on the spot.
Just like Dean, I did show up for mass slightly tired and not fully listening to the sermon, my mind still hanging in some of the rather sinful thoughts I had had about Dean the night before. Sadly enough, that would become a habit as well.
Again, Dean chuckled. "Well there isn't such a strong theme as with the last one," he replied, "but there is sort of a theme. The focus has really been on some more personal songs this time, and that's pretty much the overall theme, personality, identity, being who you are"
Jo chuckled and shrugged. "Got me. A really smart cookie he is, your daddy," she leaned in and spoke to Claire, who laughed in response.
Dean acknowledged what I had said with a barely noticeable nod before we fell into a worried silence again.
Without a word of protest, Cas put the headphones on and played the video that had been put right in front of him. It was a recording of Dean on stage, taken by someone who must have been pretty far in the front, close to the stage, because it was clear and not zoomed in. The song Dean was performing was track 14.
“You know the one,” I said. “Blue cover, I always have it out on the table in the library. Have you seen it anywhere?”
Said pair of beautiful green eyes was now suddenly staring right at me as the beautiful person they belonged to came walking around the corner and greeted me with the familiar grin on his face.
"Okay," Dean said. "There's one more that's ... it's gonna sound weird, and I think it won't be important anyways because we won't ever be in a situation that makes it necessary, but we had to include it, just to be sure. Yeah. Last thing I can ask you for is pretending to be sexually intimate with me."
"Yeah," Dean said again, now standing right in front of his two colleagues with Cas by his side. "He's Cas. Cas, that's Ed and Harry"
Cas now sat on the edge of the bed right next to her, softly stroking her little hand. She was scared. She wouldn't say it, but he could see it. Sure, she hadn't been sick the last couple years. She had been a few times when she had been really young, but she probably didn't remember that, so her aches right now were something entirely new and probably really scary to her.
After Claire had started telling Cas multiple times a day that she wanted to ride a rollercoaster - and he had not the slightest clue where that sudden urge had come from, neither who had taught her what a rollercoaster was in the first place - and his second pay check from WMR music came in, he thought, why not treat his daughter to that rollercoaster ride she wanted so badly. So, he called up Jo, and the next day they took Claire on a day trip to a theme park appropriate for her age a few towns over.
They kept chatting about Dean, and even though Jo got slightly more used to the idea of Cas's new job, she still told him multiple times that she just couldn't believe it. She also kept teasing him about Dean being his type and him totally enjoying this, which Cas couldn't deny, and she was convinced of Dean finding Cas at least slightly attractive as well. Cas tried to talk her out of that idea, simply because he didn't want to think about it. He didn't tell her, but he really wanted to keep this professional. Well, as professional as an agreement like that one could possibly be. But Cas didn't want any thoughts about Dean other than professional ones, he didn't want fantasies about Dean, and he certainly didn't want to imagine Dean wanting him
"Oh I'm sure Sam would take my side in that one," Charlie laughed. "Anyways, you did really good. We got great shots, a lot to work with. You too, Cas. Good work."
"Mh," Jo made, "I'm biased of course, but in my opinion it's exactly the right amount of disgusting touchy-touchy-ness"
Cas was just playing around with a lost rubber band he had picked up from the floor when the current song ended and the moderator announced a special guest in the studio. He slightly shifted his position and noticed Jo turned up the volume, and with his ears now focused on the radio, he twisted the rubber band around his fingers again.
And Cas was starting to wonder how far they would have to go, what even closer and more intimate things Dean would come up with, when finally, a reaction from Dean's band mates came.
"Me too," Dean said with a soft smile. It seemed like he wanted to add something, but they were interrupted by Charlie coming down the aisle and falling down in the seat next to Dean.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Mr. Price said with a smile. “You do have each other, at least. With some nice company, it rarely ever gets boring”
"Going up," the elevator voice announced, and that was the first time after that kiss the both of them actually looked at each other.
None of us said a word for another moment. On my part it was because I simply didn’t know what to say. I understood him, but I had the impression he was still grieving his father, and I simply didn’t know what to say to that – or if I even should say anything to it. Because another impression I got was him not really wanting to talk about his father.
There was a silent minute in which we only stood there staring into each other’s eyes. During that minute, I decided to do it. I had made up my mind already before that conversation, I knew that I wanted this. I only had to show him.
We did move in together at the house he had inherited from his father, and while he lived his passion as a car mechanic in his hometown, I found a new position as a teacher a town over. We built ourselves a nice life together.
"Hey," Jo greeted him, and without a word, Cas got up and pulled his best friend into a tight hug. Slightly perplexed but very gentle, she put her arms around him as well and held him.
I realized that, and then thought about Dean again. About Dean, and about how his beauty was definitely worth being preserved. If Shakespeare could immortalise his nameless lover in a poem, I thought, so could I. I didn’t know Shakespeare’s mysterious person, but could they really compare to Dean? I doubted it. So if this unknown person some hundred years ago was worthy of being immortalized in a love poem, then Dean Winchester definitely was as well.
"You've given me so much already," Cas replied, and his hand found Dean's face again, now cradling his cheek.
They chatted a bit more over dinner, and as soon as Claire was finished, she started getting restless, so Cas allowed her to go play. He stayed at the table with Jo, their empty plates in front of them, and both looked after Claire until she disappeared into the next room.
The thing is, Dean isn't Castiel's boyfriend. Castiel for sure wants him to be, no doubt of that. He has been sure about that for a while now. After now more than 3 years of knowing Dean, he has admitted to his feelings. Well, silently. In secret. Not to Dean, and certainly not to anyone else.
While still on his knees with the sponge in his right hand, the left hand fished his phone out of his pocket, and with unease, he read the caller ID.
"Okay," Jo said, and it was clear from her tone that she wasn't exactly happy with the outcome of this conversation. "Cas, you know you can always talk to me, yeah? About anything that might happen."
Dean showed him another soft smile at that. "I know," he said softly. "I know, Cas, and I know why you think I would. I know it looked like that, with Claire, but I tell you, I really wouldn't"
"Yeah, I wasn't taking any offense," Cas said, "I know that. That's why I wanted to check on that with you"
What they made kind of a regular thing, though, was keeping their practice up during lunch. They tried to act as much as possible like a couple while having lunch in the kitchen, and judging by their colleagues’ chuckles and eye-rolls, they were perfectly disgusting again.
"Yeah?" Cas asked with what was barely more than a whisper. Was this … Did that mean that Dean considered them … yeah, what? Friends? Something else? Definitely something closer than just colleagues, but Cas was thinking,
In direct response to this, Dean pulled out of the kiss and stared right into Cas's eyes. He was audibly panting, his chest was moving heavily, and his eyes. God, his eyes, Cas thought. The way Dean looked at him right now ...
"I know," Cas said quietly, "I ... it's just ... around here, the lunch breaks and stuff, that's sort of a familiar space, and if I fuck it up or start laughing it's fine because everyone knows what we're doing. But out there, with a camera, I just ... I mean I got no second chance. I have to ..." he sighed. "If I make a mistake, I ruin this entire thing for you, and that scares me"
Despite knowing that this would result in dark marks on me that I would be struggling to hide, I let him. I grabbed harder into his back, holding him tight. As he was working his magic on my neck, I rested my chin on his shoulder.
"You okay?" Dean had apparently noticed that something was up with Cas, and he eyed him with a concerned glance.
Cas quietly smiled back at him for a moment, then turned his face to look around them. Dean reached for his hand again, and he let him.
Now that made me wonder: Did he know about me? And if he did, how had he found out? Had he picked up something? Had he caught me staring at him at the library without me noticing? Had he seen the page in my notebook when I was so sure he hadn’t?
"Are you ready for me?" He breathed into Dean's ear, contentedly acknowledging how Dean shuddered at his throaty voice.
“I want to see you in my office. 20 minutes,” was all he said before he turned and disappeared into the crowd of students flocking out of the chapel.
Castiel turns and reaches for his phone with a sigh. He should be concentrating. He should've muted the stupid phone. It's probably not even important. It's probably just some stupid group chat about school or some even stupider-
Anyways, Cas had realised how much time had passed, and after some more talking, they had agreed to move in together. They had started to look for a place to live, since Dean's flat had no room for a room for Claire, and Cas's house ... he liked it, it was a nice and cozy place, but come on, it wasn't exactly luxurious, and with Dean being an international pop star and Cas being a rather successful lyricist on his team, they could definitely afford a place that didn’t have squeaking floors and heating problems.
Thank you all so much for sticking with me and this story the past couple of weeks, and thank you for every single kudos and comment <3
There was Dean's name at the top with that little blue checkmark next to it that still was a bit intimidating to Cas, and right below it, he saw his own face.
That was happening. That was really happening. That was Dean, Dean Winchester, on his knees in front of him, working his belt open with an expression in his eyes as if he was willing to do anything for him right now.
Charles apparently decided that was enough conversation with “the young folk” and turned back to his food and some other colleagues, a decision that I was more than happy about.
It was Missouri and Claire, very obviously Claire, as her face was right there, facing the camera as she was talking to Missouri, who was only visibly from the back. Missouri was crouching down in front of the little girl right next to a magazine display, and Claire was pointing at one of the magazines as she declared "Daddy!"
Cas, who had listened to everything in silence, now turned to Dean with obvious confusion on his face.
"Okay then," Charlie smiled. "So, I need some stuff from you. First off, here," she placed a paper in front of him, "please fill in full name, date of birth and address. Then sign at the bottom line here, and then on this one ..."
Here he was, on the bus on the way to their tour's next stop, Dean sitting opposite him in the seat facing him, his daughter next to him, asleep, her head resting in his lap, his hand softly resting in her blonde hair. Only hours ago, he had been convinced this drive to the next tour stop would be the most awkward experience he'd ever made, he was convinced his inevitable confrontation with Dean would be awkward and embarrassing and heart-breaking and that it would end in tears.
"Yeah," Cas sighed. "And then that one," he glanced over to the magazine, "it was sort of a job thing, but people were recognising me as well because they had already seen my face, so ... we figured we might as well just"
"You know what," he then said, "just take a couple days off. If you want, of course. There isn't really any point in you sitting around here if you could just as well be spending time with your daughter. It's summer, take her out for some ice cream or something"
"Nothing to thank me for," he said. "I found it in the library. It was just sitting there on the table, open for anyone who might want to have a peek inside. Even if you're neglecting your possessions, maybe you should be more careful about your secrets."
"Okay," Dean said quietly. "I was just ... To be honest, I was a bit worried, because you just left and I didn't know what's wrong and ..."
He spent some more time there in Missouri's garden, watching his daughter stick daisies together with a lot of concentration and some help from Missouri while chatting to the both of them about this and that. When they left later in the afternoon, he had a ring of daisies sitting on his hair, and Claire kept glancing over to him with a smile while they were driving home, constantly checking if it was still sitting in place and if it still looked as pretty as it had a second ago.
"I can't help you with that," she then said. "I wish I could, but that's a decision only you can make. But whatever you decide, please remember that you're a father and that your decisions affect more than just one life"
"Okay," Cas said. He hadn't exactly been prepared for a detailed agreement like this one, and maybe he felt slightly overcharged by it, but it definitely gave him a certain feeling of safety as well.
"You too," Dean smiled. "I gotta check on you from time to time, make sure you ever cut your hair. Don't want you to end up like Rapunzel"
“It’s a big school,” I said after a moment, “Quite a lot to memorize. I’m sure you’ll get used to it.”
grade, the normal procedure. We were currently discussing poetry, Shakespeare’s Sonnets to be exact – one of my favourite topics to teach, simply because I had a thing for Shakespeare’s Sonnets and enjoyed reading them, even apart from teaching, in my free time.
"Yeah," Jo sighed. "The internet's all over it, doesn't matter. Not to me, at least. I'm just worried about my oldest friend"
Missouri immediately agreed to babysit Claire the following day, and when Cas explained that it was because of a new job, she got all excited and congratulated him. She asked about what it was and how he found it, and even though Cas wanted to tell her, he wasn't sure if he should. So he said her he couldn't tell her anything yet, but probably she'd get to hear a story a couple days in, and Missouri seemed content with that. She was just happy that he had found something, and she was excited to spend time with Claire again.
"I'm glad you asked," Dean said. "Yeah, let her sign it before you tell her. You can ask either Charlie or Jo about it, they can give you the form. Your friend signs it, then you give it back to us."
Later that day, Dean came over to ask if they wanted to come with him and the band to have a first look at the venue, and of course they did.
Normal, yes, but so so good, Cas thought. He wouldn't have wanted Dean to be a ken doll with a photoshop body. That right there was just Dean, the purest of Dean it could get, he was just himself, and that was ... Perfect, yes. It was simply perfect.
But he didn't. He pressed his cheek against the one facing away from the two other people in the room. Cas could feel stubbles of a beard against his skin, he was overwhelmed by Dean suddenly being that close, he even could smell his shampoo, and he closed his eyes, taking all that in as Dean whispered right into his ear.
"We'll see," Dean chuckled. "I'm always nervous about a release, and I'll have to have the fans be the judge of it"
"I see," Dean chuckled. "Cas listen, I'm really sorry to ask this while you're on a break, but I kinda need you"
The man must have gone somewhere, I was thinking. How had he been able to disappear so fast? What if it had been someone living in the surrounding houses, and that was why I hadn’t been able to see him, because he had disappeared into the private safety of his home?
. This time there was no fabric between us, there was nothing between us at all. It was nothing but bare skin, it was his erection, hard and leaking, that he was rubbing against mine.
It's a notification from the tumblr app. And admittedly, the fact that he's even getting this notification is a miracle considering the functionality of the app, but that's not what makes him smile.
The very first tray of cookies had just come out of the oven, and Cas was quietly humming along to the music on the radio while scattering snowflake-shaped sprinkles all over them. All of a sudden, the peaceful atmosphere was interrupted by Dean yelling a row of words that would probably not be appropriate to repeat here.
In this ficlet, I combined two Prompts, Day 5 "Carols" and Day 6 "Christmas Curse", into a silly little crack thing. Hope it makes you smile :)
“I’m sorry,” he then breathed, still looking into my eyes. “I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable. I shouldn’t have-“
The question answered itself when she let herself in and entered the living room as Cas was just watching Claire playing around with some toy blocks. He had been in thoughts while watching his daughter building shaky towers, still thinking - and mostly worrying - about who might have already recognised him, and when he saw Jo's familiar face framed by her red hair appear through the doorway, he immediately knew he was more than happy to see her, and he was more than happy that he had made the decision to tell her beforehand.
"They're practicing," Dean quietly said to Cas, "So they'll try to ignore us. They're kinda used to me walking in on practice and they try to not let it disturb them. So I suggest we just go in, I pretend to do some stuff, you just stick to me and we make it a bit disgusting"
"I ..." Cas sighed, "I just feel like I don't belog here, you know? Because I ..." he shrugged, "This isn't me, Dean. And come on, you know that. Just a couple hours ago I was on my knees scrubbing my living room floor, and that alone makes me entirely different from the people that go here. Like they don't clean their homes themselves. I just ..."
With a deep breath, he reached for his phone on the night stand. A glance at the time, and he shot his best friend a quick text.
Jo made an awkward move to put her purse down on the counter without letting go of Claire and then grabbed back to move her red hair out of the way.
After the show, Dean jogged off the stage like he always did, and when he pulled Cas into a hug just like at the first show, he kissed him. He kissed him, and that was a real kiss. No pretending for any cameras or fans, this was real, this was about them. About
When Cas didn't say anything else - all he could do was stare back at Dean - Dean continued speaking quietly.
"That's why I'm driving," Charlie chuckled. "Now stop complaining. It's your own damn fault you're that good looking"
Cas spent a lot of time thinking about if he should come on tour with Dean. He was sure he wanted to, but there still was his concern about Claire. And apart from that, after hours of debating in his head, he laid down in bed that night and thought of yet another problem.
Cas's reply was a heartfelt smile. Once more, he started to wonder about the person Dean Winchester actually was deep down, and what else he didn't know about that man. This short conversation had only given him a glimpse into his head, but he had -again- learned something about him he hadn't expected. Never would he have expected that Dean thought so little about himself and his work, never. That man was an internationally very successful musician, with fans all around the globe looking up to him, aspiring to be like him, who had won awards and been on top of the charts, you’d really think he would be proud of himself and his work, of all his achievements.
I swallowed as I stood there staring right back into his eyes. His incredible, beautiful green eyes.
Dean softly put his arm around Cas's waist and pulled him closer as he whispered to him: "some teenagers, on that bench over there"
My mind regularly brought that thought up, at the most improper occasions. As I was standing in front of a class while teaching, when my eyes met Dean’s over dinner or during mass on Sunday morning as my mind slowly drifted away from the present, it was suddenly there on my mind, just that one word: angelic.
"The recording," Dean said, now irritated by Cas's reaction, "with Taylor Swift. For her upcoming album. Because she wants to feature me in one song."
Attached was a photo from this afternoon, Dean and Cas both crouching down there on the ground, Cas with Claire pressed against his chest, only visible in profile. Dean was there right next to him, looking directly in the camera's direction. Claire's face wasn't visible at all, it was clear that Cas was holding a child in the picture, and her blonde hair stood out from his dark jacket, but her face wasn't visible, and in that moment, Cas was really grateful for Dean warning him.
She of course did, so Dean sat her down on his knee and placed the guitar in her arms. He asked her which song she wanted to play, and after agreeing on
Dean was like a fine painting, Cas liked to think. He was so aesthetically pretty to look at, he was like the masterpiece of a hard-working artist, every freckle on his face the result of the well-thought-through tap of a brush, the shape of his face carefully drawn on canvas, every single hair added with a careful movement of hand, and his eyes, his mesmerizing green eyes, the result of long hours of work, with every little variation of colour being carefully thought of and added, colours mixed with the tip of a fine brush, making those eyes as deep and beautiful as they were.
As much as he had seen in his uncountable years of existence, as many things he had learned, words he had spoken, those were the only ones he couldn’t make sense of. He of course knew there was some kind of meaning to them, a meaning that he could piece together from the context he had witnessed others using them in, but that meaning was, as a result, an observed one, not an understood one.
“It’s alright,” I said. And it was the truth, it was alright. There was a generational gap of course, most of my colleagues had been alive for both world wars, and some had even fought in them. They had made experiences that I just couldn’t relate to. I remembered the second one, yes, but from the perspective of a child. My memories were so much different from the ones my colleagues had to live with, and that sometimes really showed in our approaches to various topics, including our teaching methods. There were differences, and sometimes they saw nothing but a naïve boy in me – even though they never said it, I knew they did. It was in the way they looked at me, how they talked to me about certain things, in a way that assumed that I wouldn’t understand anyway. But in the bigger picture, I got along with most of them. I respected them, and most of them respected me. It was alright.
They were the same, and their feelings were the same, and in a way, sitting with Dean in comfortable silence felt exactly as good as it had before. But at the same time, it felt so different. It felt entirely different, Cas thought, and it felt so much better.
With that knowledge, and Dean's hopeful  eyes on him, Cas agreed, and only a couple minutes later, they were walking down the street together.
"No, it's ..." Cas sighed. "You were right," he then said. There it was. She had been right. She had been right all the time, Cas had to admit that. She had been right, and he had been one big idiot.
"Alright," he sighed. "I feel like I'm wearing clothes made out of literal bags of money, like this suit is worth more than my entire goddamn closet back home, and I just feel wrong. But that's nothing you could change, so yeah. All good."
"God," Dean groaned, whereas Cas could feel the heat crawling up his face, "Shouldn’t have told you, that was a mistake"
I told my brand new colleague to follow me and led him through the building, deliberately not choosing the fastest way to Mr. Price’s office. I might not have been able to act on my undeniable attraction to Dean in any way, but that didn't mean that I couldn't use a little trick to get a couple more minutes to talk to him and admire that beautiful face.
"Sure," Dean said softly. "Cas by all means, your kid's health comes first. Maybe you miss next show, the one after as well if you have to, so? I ain't gonna make you come to the show when she's there like that crying for her father"
Cas’s eyes were still on Dean, following him moving around over there in the other half of the room, talking to people with that smile on his face. The face was beautiful, and every time Cas looked at it, he couldn’t believe just how beautiful it was. Every time he looked at it, he was thinking that a masterpiece like that should be put in a museum.
"O...okay," Dean stuttered. He was suddenly nervous, and Cas could relate to that. He as well hadn't expected to have a conversation anything like this today.
Dean came in when Claire was about halfway through the muffin. He pushed the kitchen door open first only a bit to glance inside with a smile. That was when Cas saw him and smiled back at him. Then, he opened the door completely and stepped into the room.
"Have you seen it?" Charlie asked, and now she finally looked up from the screen and met Cas's eyes.
So when Dean came in, he found Cas alone at his desk, finishing the final read through of the booklet that had been interrupted the day before.
Some time, dinner was almost ready, Cas heard the front door open, and right away, a familiar voice yelled "Cas?" into the house.
"I can confirm music-wise," Cas said, "and while I really like you overall, I've never met her and have to give her the benefit of the doubt"
But it hadn't. The conversation might have started out rather uncomfortably, but considering the outcome, Cas really couldn't complain. Because here he was, only hours later, with Dean right there, and Dean smiling at him. Able to call Dean his boyfriend, apart from all the pretending and acting and faking it, apart from the press. For real. That man really was ... yes. His boyfriend.
He had to admit that his thoughts and doubts wouldn't get him anywhere, but since he knew he needed to make up his mind until the next day, he reached for his phone and opened his best friend's contact information.
Claire was exhausted from the eventful day and Cas soon tucked her into bed earlier than usual. When he wished her a good night, she told him in a sleepy voice that this had been a wonderful day.
"Mh," Jo made thoughtfully. "You know, I think you're making it way worse in your head than it actually is"
Cas finished the other lyrics he had been working on - the last ones for now, as he was told, since the release date for the album kept coming closer and they were trying to wrap it up in the near future. Then there were another couple of busy days filled with recording sessions, and suddenly, after weeks of hard work and lots of time pressure, Cas found himself at his desk in the office without any more work to do.
Shortly before taking the turn into the street, they switched back to holding hands, and Dean shot Cas a supportive smile.
Dean smiled back at Cas for a moment, and Cas had the impression that he understood. Then, Dean turned to Charlie.
"Exactly," Dean said. "There's always different opinions, of course. But I'm really anxious about releasing something and then finding out that the overall impression just isn't good"
absurd scenario, but if we ever were to be overheard in a situation that demands it, I could ask you to make some suggestive sounds."
I was so insecure that moment. Ridiculously flustered by a cute guy showing up unexpectedly, and ridiculously oblivious about everything that had happened during our very first conversation. Little did I know that this man who had me so flustered and confused would turn out to actually be the love of my life.
"Yeah," Jo smirked. "Glad we've cleared that. So, I didn't sign that confidentiality agreement to provide emotional support without getting some tea. Shoot."
Yes, Dean has been there. Dean has yelled at his best friend for no reason, Dean has blamed his best friend for various bad things happening in his life, and still, his best friend is always there.
And then, when Dean suddenly glanced down to the side, cleared his throat and made a hasty step back from him, Cas's thoughts finally came through again.
"So," she grinned as soon as Cas had sat back down, "I'm dying for the news. Did you figure out how to tell me?"
A few hours later, Cas had checked on Claire again, him and Dean were in bed as well. They had played a couple more rounds. After their first defeat, Claire had been okay with them playing as a team for the rest of the evening, and they had managed to win a grand total of two rounds, leaving Claire extremely proud of her connect four skills when Cas had finally sent her to bed.
As I finally arrived, I came to stop right next to him. None of us said a word, we just stood there next to each other in silence.
Dean being in love with him, that was ... Well, on the one hand, it made sense. It was the most plausible explanation for so many things that had happened between the two of them, for the smiles and that one kiss at the charity event, for the staring and the chemistry. But on the other hand, it didn't make sense at all. Dean Winchester, Cas thought over and over again. Dean Winchester, in love with
"Oh, I did!" She replied, "But at the same time, I kinda thought you'd go through with that distance thing. It was a 50/50, really"
"Shouldn't they be visible?" Cas asked. "Like with a big camera being all fussy in the front or something?"
"No job, no pretending," he said with a smile. "Just two colleagues getting to know each other better. There's a little diner just around the block, I sometimes grab lunch there and they always make sure to be discreet about me. No cameras, no saying my name, you know?"
Jo arrived back with a little paper bag. The pharmacist had recommended some kind of liquid medicine for Claire to take in. She explained to Cas what the pharmacist had explained to her as well, about how much of the medicine to give Claire and how frequently.
Sam chuckled with him. "But you know, I think the important thing is that you've talked, no matter why. You've cleared it up, and I mean I've only seen you together for like half a day, but I got the impression you're happy. Both of you. Plus, your kid, she seems happy as well"
On Saturday, she asked for the first time about his new job. The two of them were sitting at the kitchen table once again, Claire on Cas's lap, and she was colouring a picture in her colouring book, trying really hard to entirely stay within the lines with Cas's help. While colouring, she asked where he was going every day, and Cas explained it to her.
When it came to the chorus, Dean closed his eyes and sang with visible emotion, and then during the second verse, he opened his eyes again and started blinking more than before, looking up, blinking again, while still performing the song. It wasn't obvious at that point, but knowing Dean had cried, Cas knew that at that point Dean was probably just trying to fight the upcoming tears.
Dean now stood in front of Cas, naked from the waist up, breathing heavily and again looking at him like
Cas's job would be, as Garth explained, to help him with the reviewing and improving of the texts. Cas was openly insecure about how that would work and he told him he had no experience at all, but Garth calmed him with the advice, similar to what Dean had said, to just trust his gut and go with what sounded good.
Again, I let him do it. I turned my face over to him and smirked at him for a moment, obviously signalling him that I liked it. Dean looked right back at me, a grin on his face.
"There's, uhm ..." Cas started, "well we've gotten closer than necessary when there was no one to pretend for. When we were literally alone. Happened a couple times. But there's this one thing that ... it really confuses me. It fucks with my head, really"
"Hey sunshine," she said and booped the girl’s little nose, making her laugh before she pulled her little arms around the women's neck and hugged her.
But then, on the other hand, he couldn't just make a decision that big within an instant at the office. He couldn't just agree because Dean had asked with a charming smile - even though, that was a nice smile, and it was really tempting, Cas had to admit that. Maybe, if it would've been about just him, he would've agreed right away. But as Missouri had said, he was a father, and he couldn't just make that decision without thinking about his daughter.
Except that one time, he did. The exact moment I glanced over to him to steal yet another look, he looked up as well. Our eyes met, for just a fraction of a second. I felt my face heating up, I was obviously blushing, so I immediately turned back to the essay in front of me and made sure to stay focused. I didn’t dare to look up again for the rest of the afternoon; the risk of Dean catching me staring at him was way too big.
Cas sighed and massaged his forehead with his free hand. She hadn't been supposed to know that, he thought. Nobody had been supposed to know that.
"Yeah," Cas sighed. "I'm over that, though. And I got a way better pay check now, so honestly, fuck them"
"No need to be nervous," Dean smiled at him. "I wanna talk about some stuff with you, though, so if you wanna come with me?"
Then Cas did something that Dean had not expected, but seemed to like. He used all the force his body could work up right now and turned them around so now it was Cas pushing Dean back against the door.
"Am I really?" I replied. "Am I sinning if I'm just being the person God made me, with all the mistakes and desires he intended? Does it make me any more of a sinner than any other man, having the same desires for his wife?"
Dean chuckled slightly. "Well," he said, "I mean, I do love what I do. The music and stuff, that's something I've always loved, and now being able to make a living from that ... it's amazing, it really is. But everything that comes with it, you know, the attention, the interest in everything you do, the speculation and the photos and the tabloids ... I could really do without that."
"He let me keep his suit," Cas said, still not really believing it himself. That was ... he just let me keep it"
“No but it is,” Dean argued, “When you’re losing your job because I couldn’t keep my hand off of you!”
It’s dark, my alcoholised mind calmed my emerging worries. It’s dark, there’s nobody out here. It’s fine.
Dean first stayed still to let Cas do his thing, but after a moment he got impatient and started working his hands around Cas's clothes, trying to get some fabric off of him as well.
Cas glanced at his watch. Ten minutes before 9, that wasn't too bad. He hadn't been sure about how long it'd take him to get there, especially with dropping Claire off on the way, but he was content with the time.
As the door shut behind them, Claire by his hand looked around with visible impression. It wasn't anything special so far, not to Cas at least, but he knew she had never been in a place like this, and therefore everything about this very normal office hallway seemed exotic to her.
He sighed, then continued. "Anyways. Would you mind if I just leave it with you, then? You can get Garth into it any time, it's just that I really need this done when I'm back because we got the deadline coming"
“Cas,” Dean moaned, and that was the final straw that pushed me over the edge. I buried my nails in his back even harder, keeping him as close as somehow possible as I came.
Cas felt an unknown sort of pride as he stood there off to the side and watched Dean in that soundproofed cube, performing the lyrics he had worked on with a visible lot of emotion.
Cas just kept staring at her. He still couldn't really believe it. They were talking about Dean Winchester, after all. Dean Winchester, international pop star, who could have anyone he wanted ... and he wanted … Cas?
Before I met Dean, that sounded so weird. Before I met Dean, that was a whole different version of myself. A whole different time. Sure, it was a time only 3 months ago, but at the same time it seemed like an eternity away.
, Cas read that line again and again, and one more time. He could understand why Dean wasn't entirely happy with it. It wasn't bad, it really wasn't, but didn't quite hit the right tone.
"Okay," Cas said, "yeah. Sure. I, uhm ... I'm sure I'll find someone for Claire. What time should I be here?"
In the late afternoon, Garth decided that was enough input for Cas's first day, and after checking with Jo, Cas was free to go home.
"Yeah," Dean said, "yeah, of course. I just, uhm ..." he now turned and actually looked at Cas for the first time, "I was worried. Jo told me she got sick and ... yeah. I got worried about her"
He'd have to interact with Dean in some way later, there was no way going around that. But for now, Cas decided to, once again, ignore the problem and not think about it.
. Castiel knows the url, they're one of Dean's mutuals in the Doctor Sexy fandom. He's seen Dean reblogging from them a couple of times before.
"Yeah," Dean said with a slight chuckle. "Yeah, I am. This is a first for me as well." A short pause, then he added: "In faking a relationship, I mean. Never done that before. Don't know, maybe you have"
He shook his head one more time to get rid of those thoughts - they wouldn't even take him anywhere, he knew that. He had been stuck in that cycle of
"Not keeping up with the schedule?" Dean said. "Yeah. I had a scare that we might have to postpone the release. But as of today, we're gonna finish in time"
But I had thought we would be better at hiding it. I had been prepared for something like this to happen eventually, at some point. But not now, not yet. We had had only roughly three weeks together so far, this was way too early.
She chuckled. "Just joking. He's a smart guy. I've known him forever and we make that sort of jokes, you know"
food," Dean chuckled, "but basically, pretty accurate. Though, uhm ... I could buy her a new one? If that's alright with her Dad?"
Claire would come with Cas to see that first show, they had agreed on that. Regarding future shows, Cas thought they should judge that on her moods and how well she took the first one, but for now he convinced her to take a nap in the afternoon to have enough energy for the concert.
"Yeah of course he's your boyfriend," Claire said, "but you can ... I mean, do you love-love him? Like the fairy tale love of your life kind of way?"
"Great," he laughed, "I work my ass off for months and you pick the one song I wasn't involved with at all"
After the boy had finished reading the last line, it took me a second to force my mind back into the present, back into this classroom. Away from Dean.
Cas himself had, just like Garth, no more lyrics to work on, and after spending some time watching the practice that was going on upstairs, he decided to go and offer Jo some help that she gladly accepted.
“Correct,” I said. “Very good. Thank you.” The boy showed a little smile as a reaction to my praise. That was one of my favourite parts of teaching. I always made sure to let the students know if they had done something well and seeing their proud reaction to doing good always made me feel kind of proud of their learning process as well.
“I’d say I am, yeah,” I chuckled. “Though, I probably relate to a different kind of teenagers than you do”
“Dean,” I started, “I understand that you’re worried. I really do, who would I be to tell you to not worry about it when I’ve been lying awake the whole night panicking about the exact same thing. And I see why you feel guilty. I don’t
They talk for over an hour, and towards the end they're back to one of their usual conversations about life, school and rants, mixed with some jokes.
"What would that job be classified as?" He then asked. "Officially, I mean. I believe being a celeb's fake boyfriend probably isn’t exactly a state-approved career?"
"Okay?" Cas chuckled and closed the door behind him, "Good morning to you too? Did I miss something amazing happening?"
Just like Dean, she kept saying. She would be just like Dean, play the guitar and sing to it, just like Dean did.
Dean's answer was another smile on his own. He leaned in slightly, and he must have seen the quick sparkle of panic in Cas's eyes, because he whispered "calm".
"She said we can use the back door," Dean said. "In case there's still someone waiting outside. If you wanna."
Dean smiled as he read those few words. Then, he signalled Cas to push the notebook over. Cas pushed it into the middle of the table and watched how Dean pulled a green post-it out, clicked his own biro and scribbled something down before he sticked it onto the page as well.
They were sitting closely next to each other, their shoulders almost touching, and when Dean pulled up his leg to place it over his other knee to sit in a more relaxed way, their legs touched.
He watched Dean chat a bit with the woman, she once glanced behind towards Cas as she said something to Dean, then smiled at them with his answer. Cas knew she had probably asked about them, and for some reason he was really curios to know Dean's answer.
Without knowing it, he had given me the best advice of my life that day. He had given me something to hold on to. Whenever I started doubting myself, I remembered my uncle’s words.
Dean laughed out loud at the imagination of that scene, and Cas just had to join because his laughter was that contagious.
It was pretty much the same as the day before, and Cas felt pretty similar to how he did during their first kiss. He could feel his heart skipping a beat and then suddenly racing, and again he wished Dean would just stay with him like that forever.
"Yeah," Dean said and looked directly into Cas's eyes. "Would you be willing to join me on the tour and pretend to be my boyfriend at certain occasions?"
The hug turned into a kiss, and that kiss turned into another kiss, and then Cas pulled back only far enough to look into Dean's eyes.
Inside, Dean hastily closed the door behind them and let out a relieved sigh. Cas pulled Claire's hair back as he looked around. That was not a store he would've ever entered. It was clothes, sure. But expensive clothes. Very expensive clothes.
They quietly walked next to each other back to the hotel, and this time, the silence was indeed uncomfortable. It was uncomfortable, it was awkward, and Cas had not the slightest idea what on earth had happened between them, and he knew even less about what any of that meant.
Knowing that he had noticed such little details about me, that he cared enough to remember them; and knowing that he even cared enough to memorize my entire schedule just to be able to meet me at the library at the right time, that made me think. His behaviour after we had had that talk at the chapel, him being willing to give me as much time as I needed, his willingness to wait for me and him never pressuring me, not even once, him being prepared to accept a no from me, that made me think even more.
"Okay," Dean started. He slightly pressed Cas's hand, a signal for Cas to let go, and he did. He let go off Dean's hand, and he took a step away from him, creating an appropriate distance between them.
Though right now, that was okay, he told himself. Right now, they were out acting, right now he was pretending to be Dean's boyfriend, and right now it was okay, it was
With a sigh, Dean turned and now looked at Cas with an expression that seemed rather annoyed to him.
. I know it was, and you know it, too. I was an idiot, an absolute idiot. And I was a selfish asshole, because I dragged you into this even though you
," Cas explained quietly. "You've got your fans and your record label and your expensive clothes and thousand-dollar suits, and I'm just ... I'm just a single father with no appropriate suit for your fancy occasions"
"It's just," she then started, "that I really like Dean. And you're my Dad of course, but he's as well, and I want him to stay"
This might be the end of this story, but it was only the beginning of our life together. Even though it had seemed like the end for us earlier that one eventful day, even though I had been so scared of losing him just minutes before that talk, it was in fact only the beginning.
It was one of those tabloid magazines, Cas noticed. Probably the one Claire had been talking about in the video. Him and Dean were on the front cover, the picture of them taken at the charity even, but also way smaller at the bottom, the one where they were kissing at the café. There was a sensationalistic headline saying
With his teeth nervously biting his tongue, Castiel decides to just give it a shot. A risky shot, admittedly. But a shot.
Liking men had always been a part of me. A part of me that I had learned to accept a while ago, a part of me that I had eventually learned to love. Liking men was something that had always been there, something I was used to.
And that concert. Of course. The way Dean had looked directly at Cas and smiled at him during the chorus of that song. Jesus Christ, of course!
Dinner that night was served to an accordingly small group, and afterwards I walked back to the apartment building together with Dean. We were walking next to each other, but maintaining a platonic colleague distance between us. It wasn’t very likely for anyone to see us, but just in case. You never knew, and we’d rather not hold hands for a little longer than running into a student while doing it.
"Oh it's the Taylor Swift recording," Dean said, and the way he said it sounded like that was the most average thing to do.
And so it happened that multiple hours later as I was lying in my bed in my dark bedroom, it was his eyes before anything else that were on my mind as I slid my hand down my pants. His smile was there, of course, as well as his shoulders, his hips, his chest. His hands, and his neck. God, his neck. But before all of that, the most prominent image on my mind as I came into my hand that night with a voiceless “Dean” on my lips, his incredible green eyes.
"Everybody has a flower crown face," Claire decided and already started picking some daisies out of the grass.
Cas was still staring at him. He started getting the feeling that this man his daughter had bathed in ice cream wasn't just a random guy on the street, and that he
Claire nodded with a hesitant look at the man, then she robbed back a bit and stretched her leg out in front of her father.
"Yeah," Dean smirked, "we got sort of a dead couple days coming. Well, Charlie and Jo are as busy as always, but us others, not really"
"I know," he chuckled. "But that's not even the reason why I wanted to tell you. It's about the other thing, actually"
"There's gonna be photos," Cas explained calmly, "of Dean Winchester and me. There has been one already, online, but that wasn't part of the plan and he tried to keep it down because it was accidental and Claire was in it and ... anyway. There's gonna be photos that will look like snapped by chance, and they're gonna make tabloid headlines and some gossip and all that, but they're approved by his PR team. They're staged, to some extent."
"No," Dean said calmly. "But soon would be amazing. Especially because of today's photos. But you can have a night to sleep about it, if you want. Call me back tomorrow."
Now, several minutes later, Cas was hiding in the restroom. After splashing cold water in his face to clear up his thoughts, he was now leaning against the cold tiles of the wall, hands gripped into his hair, taking slow and regular breaths to calm himself down.
"It won't be for long," Dean said. "Whoever posted this will have to take it down, and so will anyone who eventually reposted it. Maybe some people have seen already, we can't change that, but we're stopping it from spreading as fast as we can"
Right, I reminded myself. We were in public. We were just two colleagues going for a drink together. And colleagues didn’t stare at each other like that.
Cas allowed Dean to pull him close, he even leaned in a bit further and put his hand on Dean's chest. His eyes followed Dean's towards the whiteboard. There was a schedule on it, written with blue marker.
The entire floor seemed to be just that one big room, divided into two parts. The front part was open and very bright, thanks to a row of windows on the side. There were various instruments spread across the room, multiple guitars, a keyboard, drums, lots of cable on the floor, and a mixer console that was pretty central in the middle of it all, facing the box that formed the second part of the room.
Cas himself was definitely perplexed by Dean's unexpected hug, but he quickly adjusted to it and put his arms around Dean as well, holding him close just for that moment with a happy smile.
None of us spoke for a minute or two. We were just walking next to each other in silence, walking across the fields, now on the way back to the school again but still far enough away for the buildings to be hidden behind a group of trees.
It felt good, it was the racing heart and the warm feeling of Dean and his soft lips on Cas's, and yes, it wasn't just good, it was better than any of their previous kisses, because this was
He told Claire to not make any noise for a bit now because he needed to make a phone call, and after getting a mumbled "yeah" from her, he grabbed the phone and started typing in the number.
“I prayed for some strength, since I desperately need it,” I said quietly, looking into Dean’s eyes.
"Yeah," Cas smiled, "She's with her babysitter. A friend, actually. Pretty sure she's having a great time"
Jo had gotten her a new set of crayons, as she knew that Claire used hers very frequently and they had gotten rather short recently. Missouri had brought a book about dinosaurs, because Claire loved being read stories and had entered a dinosaur phase lately. In the final present from Cas was a little guitar in child size. He knew what he was getting himself into, and he had debated a lot whether or not he really wanted to give his five-year-old daughter an instrument into her hyperactive hands, but the sparkling in her eyes as she unpacked it was convincing enough.
“No,” I lied. “It’s just some notes that I would like back. It would be tiring to try and write it all down again from memory. That’s all”
Absolute silence, nothing but their heavy breaths in the silence of that night, their breaths and the other one's racing heartbeat.
He scrolls down to see the most recent posts. He passes by a few reblogs - that he immediately likes and then reblogs - until he arrives at the original post that caused the notification. The post already has a number of notes, so Castiel assumes that it is at least an hours old. He, again, rolls his eyes. What are post notifications even for if they don't work? And the way better question, why doesn't anything on this godforsaken website ever work?
When Cas woke up the next morning, Dean's side of the bed was empty. At first, he was irritated, he turned around and felt the bed next to him. Cold. Then, he understood. He distinctly remembered Dean talking to him earlier that morning, he remembered Dean saying goodbye and kissing his cheek. And he remembered, sure, Dean had that thing today. Cas wasn't fully awake yet and didn't remember what exactly it was, but Dean had told him about it. He was ... somewhere, the entire day. Where was it again?
The racing of his heart was right back, spreading through his entire body, he could hear his heartbeat in his ears as he leaned into Dean's touch, leaned his entire body into him and the kiss, softly placing his hands on Dean's chest as he kissed him back.
"I'm sorry, Daddy," she said, and with the cute little puppy eyes she made at him, Cas immediately gave her a soft smile.
As he returned to the room in a suit that felt good on him, but at the same time like he would risk his entire assets if he'd only get as much as a stain on it, Dean's eyes scanned him from head to toes and back with a smile.
It gave an overview over the rumours surrounding Dean and then just went into speculation about who that man could possibly be, since it obviously wasn't another celebrity or anyone Dean had ever openly worked or been involved with in any way.
This morning followed their usual routine. Cas checked on Claire, they got ready, the three of them had breakfast together. None of them talked, especially not Dean, because no matter how sleepy Cas or Claire were, Dean was a level of grumpy in the morning that none of them could ever reach, even if they tried.
He dropped her off at Missouri's with her little backpack that today contained nothing but two stuffed animals and a picture book, but she had insisted on bringing it. Both the elder lady and the little girl were equally excited to see each other, and seeing them hug and laugh right as she opened the door gave Cas a good feeling for the day.
“Yes,” I quietly agreed, “So? Dean, I knew that. I am a grown man, I make my own decisions. And this was a decision I made, I deliberately chose to take that risk. It’s not your fault.”
“I want to be doing that all the time,” he breathed, barely loud enough to hear it. “Just never stop. No more teaching, nothing. Just kissing you forever”
"Cas," Jo interrupted him with a calm voice. "Are you writing lyrics for Dean Winchester's songs, or not?"
He was still new to the app. Dean and Jo (not Dean-Jo, his best friend Jo) had helped him figuring it all out just last week. They had created his account together and given him a crash course on how to use it.
Cas stood there in silence for another moment, hands in his pockets, still not looking at Dean - who was, Cas was aware of that, still eyeing him.
“You know,” I said, “You really don’t have to pay for my drinks every time we come here. I could pay too, once or twice”
Dean and Cas pulled out of their current kiss, and with Cas still sitting on Dean, both of them turned their faces to Charlie.
"What's wrong?" Cas asked and put his phone down. He looked over to Charlie who was intently staring at her computer screen.
"Anyways," Dean then said. "Let’s forget about that. So," he changed the topic, "that, what was it, paint accident you mentioned? What was that about?"
He didn't have to ask that question twice, as Cas immediately nodded. Dean lead him out through a side door, and after a short walk through a sterile hallway, Cas found himself outside at the side of the building. Dean pushed a wedge in below the door with his foot to keep it open just a crack and then turned back to Cas with a smile.
Cas was holding onto Dean as if he was his life support as he was passionately kissing him back, shamelessly enjoying every second of this without wasting one thought at the consequences this might bring, the problems and feelings it might cause or make worse.
Christmas break was wonderful. I enjoyed every single second I got to spend with Dean. I tried to memorize every single one of the sweet sweet words he whispered into my ear; I tried to imprint his touch on my skin. I was absorbing his unique scent every second I was close to him, and I enjoyed everything about him every night when I was there sleeping in his arms.
Dean pulled out of the parking lot and exaggeratedly focused on his driving, so Cas turned to the side with a sigh and looked out the window on the dark street instead.
Dean asked Cas to follow him, and after a short explanation to Claire that he had to go with Dean and she should be nice to Jo, he did, together with Charlie.
"Your brother Sam?" Cas asked. He remembered that here had been a mention of that name, and of Dean’s brother, the day before, but he wasn't entirely sure about that anymore with so much happening all at once.
“Speaking of some company your own age,” Dean now said, “I was wondering, would you mind showing me around a bit later? Mr. Price didn’t get to that yesterday and I could use gaining some better orientation around the place.”
“I’d love your company,” I said and returned a smile, trying my best not to let him notice anything about the implications my mind had attached to that sentence.
Ed and Harry right in front of them watched that interaction, both men with a confused expression on their faces.
He walked up to me. My eyes were almost glued to his body; they were following every step he made on the crunching gravel. I couldn't see much of his body, but as little as his suit gave away, I knew what was underneath must have been good. And his face! There was no way this indescribably beautiful face came with a second-class body. His face was perfectly symmetrical. A truly adorable nose sat in-between the greenest pair of eyes ever known to mankind, covered in dozens and dozens of freckles. Below, his soft, pink lips, so perfectly shaped. So kissable, I allowed myself to think.
Cas turned his head only slightly to the left, far enough to see a woman standing right next to him. He didn’t know her, had never seen her before. Not that he would have expected to know her, no. Honestly, running into a familiar face while on an undercover hunt probably wasn’t the best thing to happen, and therefore they were always happy to be faced with only people they had never met before. What was irritating to Cas, though, was that this unknown woman felt connected enough to him to start a conversation with that comment and nothing else.
Dean said he'd walk them to the door, and after a quick visit at Jo's office where Claire said goodbye to her with a hug, they were standing right in front of the door, Claire back by Cas's hand.
Dean teased Jo about she hadn’t gotten any work done, to which she replied with a snarky comment that he hadn't either. When Cas and Claire were already out the door, Jo stuck out her tongue at Dean. He chuckled and returned the gesture before he closed the door and stepped out into the corridor.
He spent some more time just sitting there and watching over her, until a while later, she woke up again. She wasn't exactly feeling better, but Cas made her sit up and gave her a bottle of water from the minibar to drink. He freshened up the towel with cold water and put it back on her forehead, tucked her in again.
“Because, you know,” he said as he understood I couldn’t answer, “I know that it can be very scary. The thing with the red and yellow M&Ms. I hate it how people expect you to prefer one, and not only that, they expect you to prefer
"Our plan is, and Charlie, please correct me if I get anything wrong, to approach this without giving out your name. I told you about our basic idea already yesterday, and that's what we're working with. A down to earth guy who doesn't want any of his boyfriend's publicity. We're gonna do the sunglasses thing in public, mostly at least, maybe there'll be a couple 'accidental' shots that show more you without. Depending on how it goes, maybe I'll ask you to let me take photos for my official social media, but I'd do that also without showing your whole face. It might happen though that some journalists start digging and figure out your name. But there won't be an official mention of your name on my side. Also, as we discussed, your daughter will not be part of this agreement at all, I won't ask you to involve her in any way whatsoever, and we're gonna do our best to not get her into another situation like the one yesterday. Which I'm very sorry about, by the way."
Dean did, and as Cas found out on another social media dive back at home on his laptop later that day, the fans really were having a blast over it.
My thoughts were racing as I walked through the empty corridors on the way to Mr. Price’s office. I was sure he knew about me and Dean. He had to know. It had to have been him who saw us the night before. Why else would he call me into his office on a Sunday morning, right after mass? What other reason could he even have for this?
“I remembered what you said about your uncle,” he explained quietly, “about him giving good advice, and your religious family. Then I thought, if you’re looking for advice, this is probably where you’d go”
There were four other teenagers further in the back, still on the bench, but Dean and Cas didn't even register that. Their eyes were on that girl right next to them who now came out of her freeze and hastily picked her phone up from the ground while babbling something like "sorry, don't mind me"
He watched people changing the positions of the lights, others giving Dean instructions on how to change his position - slightly to the left, no not the whole body, just move the shoulders, chin up a bit, yes exactly - and the photographer, Alec, Cas assumed, making some comments here and there while checking the setting through the camera’s lense.
"I, uhm ..." he started, "well I've been reading some comments online. And maybe I shouldn't have done that in the first place, but it ... some of them got really close to me, you know? And I talked to my friend about it, and she said I just shouldn't bother thinking about it, and she's right, but I just ... I mean, how do you do it?"
"Yeah," Cas agreed, "yeah, and I'm glad about that. So I saw that photo, and I read through a couple of comments, and I think your plan can work. I think you really got chances with this. So ... I think I'm gonna give it a try."
"Yeah," Dean smiled. "Anyways. Let's talk about you, and this plan. First of all, let's start with the official stuff. You're a teacher, not by any chance an English teacher? Or anything similar?"
“Well, I know something,” I said. “It’s just not a lot. I was given into my uncle’s care at a very young age because my parents both struggled for employment. It was the great depression, after all, and they eventually had to move around, leaving me with my uncle but sending as much money as they could. Until one day, they suddenly stopped without any explanation, never to be heard from again.”
It was moans, loud moans and groans, some quiet, little moans in between, and it was those little phrases over and over again, "yeah, oh God yeah", "fuck me", "God yes give it to me", it was the look in Dean's eyes and it was the way he moaned Cas's name, it was all that that Cas took in with all his senses, what drove him to keep going and to make it even better with every push into Dean, to make it better and more intense and to make Dean moan louder, harder, make Dean scream his name.
After a moment of silence, Dean pulled out his smartphone and started typing on it. "Oh yeah," he said after some quiet typing. "That plan definitely worked."
He soon moved his right hand down to give Dean some quick strokes, to give him only a hint of all that pleasure back that he had received.
“Psssshhht!” an entire group reacted to Dean’s interruption all at once, causing him to look up and throw an apologising smile into the room.
The photos were very easy to find. A quick Google search of Dean's name set to news, and he had them right there.
Dean didn’t know back then what the feeling was, but he knew that for some reason, he didn’t want Cas to know about it. Today, he’s still not entirely sure what the feeling is about, but by now he has figured out
It was all that, and it was amazing, it was mindblowing and it was simply perfect. Everything about it, from the way Dean looked at him over those amazing sounds he made, the grip of Dean's hand on his arm and his hand around Dean's wrist, and just the overall feeling of this, of actually, really, truly having sex with Dean, in reality, not in a dream, all of that was simply perfect to Cas.
They had a great time cooking and eating together, and Cas even allowed Claire to stay up a bit longer to spend some more time with Jo.
"Mh," Cas smirked and looked up directly into Dean's eyes, "I could, yeah. But you wouldn't have anything to look forward to if I did. Gotta keep your work experience exciting"
He eventually had to leave, and lying in bed alone like that, suddenly feeling so horribly cold and empty, I realized that I just slept so much better with Dean next to me.
"Nice to meet you too, Dean," Cas smiled, now looking directly into his green eyes for the first time.
"Come over," she said quietly, perplexity showing in her eyes, and Cas walked over the few steps to her.
It quite an extensive project, but a couple of minutes later, Cas had managed to carry his daughter into the bathroom without leaving blue footprints all throughout the house or covering himself in paint as well. First, he considered only washing off her face, but after removing her shirt and finding out that somehow, she had gotten the paint even below her sleeves, he decided to just sit her down in the shower and scrub her clean.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean whispered. “I didn’t … I shouldn’t have started this. I didn’t think. God Cas, I am so sorry …”
Shortly before he pulled into the parking lot at work, he shook his head and with it the thought out of his mind. He'd have more than enough time to think about that, he thought. Maybe there'd be the right place and time to talk about it with Dean. Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
We agreed on not getting another round in favour of a migraine-free mass the next day, but that didn’t stop us from staying at the bar for another while, talking some more. On my part, personally, staring a lot more. That one moment of unexpected direct eye-contact had done something to me that I couldn’t define, but I couldn’t get his eyes out of my mind anymore.
And that moment, in the middle of the night as I was lying in bed in my dark room, staring up at the ceiling, I realized.
"I..." Cas shrugged, "It's not that easy. Do I want it? I mean I want him, yeah. But I can only have him with all the attention that comes with him, and I don't know if I can handle that"
"Well," Cas chuckled, "to be exact, no, I didn't get you a physical ticket. What I did is, I talked to Dean, and you're coming backstage with me"
"Just do it," Dean said while he fumbled for his sunglasses and put them back on. Meanwhile, Cas pulled Claire closer to him and held her against his chest, hiding her face.
It took me a second to respond. I silently stared into his eyes for a bit longer before I managed to articulate an answer.
"You're gonna be fine," he softly told her. "It's nothing too bad. Just a little sickness, that happens"
"No," Charlie now laughed, saving him from an awkward explanation. "Well in theory, he could, and if he really wants to, I can't stop him, but I made the urgent suggestion not to do it. Because we want positive headlines to get rid of the rumours, and what we really don't need is
"Okay," she said, "so, we got all that cleared up. If there's no further questions, I suggest I get your papers ready?"
Because they care about you, just like you care about them. And they’re probably about as scared of hurting you as you are of hurting them. They are, just like you, trying to protect the person they care about.
"Great," Cas had said. Nothing more than that. "Great," and with that he had hurried out of the room, leaving Dean behind all alone and confused.
"Sure," Dean said with a charming smile. Cas gave him a meaningful look, and he added: "But do me a favour and make sure he's not in it, yeah?"
Back in his own room, Cas spent quite some time lying awake next to his daughter. Claire was peacefully sleeping, he could hear her calm, rhythmic breaths as he was lying there in silence, thinking. Just thinking.
"You got experience as a teacher," Dean said, "you know texts. It's nothing different, really. Look at it as poems, and you got it"
During their dinner date they had gone with only smiles and hand holding, alongside some very mild playing footsies that Dean had initiated at some point. They hadn't kissed even once, there hadn't been need for it, but now as they were walking back through the chill night air, that was about to change.
That night, I lay awake for hours. Staring up at the ceiling in the dark, I was still thinking, still wondering what it meant.
"Yeah," Cas said calmly, looking into Dean's eyes. "It's illegal, and I could've made a fuss and sued them, and maybe I would've, if it would've been just me. But I ..." he shrugged, "look, Dean, I'm a single father. And even though the entire situation makes my blood boil every time I think about it and I would be happy to see some assholes getting payback for this, I decided to not take them to court, because a lawsuit would take so much time, and it would cost me a lot, and even though I know I'd have good chances of winning and getting compensation, I had to think short term, and that meant making sure my daughter can eat every day until I can find a new job. I simply didn't have the money or the time or the energy to sue anyone"
Cas didn't say anything at first. He let that sink in, and part of him got excited about the thought, because Cas wanted that, and if Dean wanted it as well, that was amazing, right? But the much bigger part of him kept thinking no, that couldn't be true. Because that was Dean Winchester they were talking about, Dean Winchester who could have pretty much everyone he wanted, and who certainly wouldn't want someone as average and ordinary as Cas.
"Yeah," he stuttered and ran his hand through his because of Cas's hands ruffled hair, "yeah, uhm ... well. That worked"
The next couple days, it wasn't really obvious that Dean wasn't there. To Cas, it felt like every other day when Dean had disappeared upstairs all the time. The only difference now was that Dean wasn't there at lunch either, and Cas would've never admitted it to anyone - he didn't even want to admit it to himself - but he missed him sitting there across the table and cracking a stupid joke that made Cas almost choke on his food, he missed the way Dean smiled at him, he just missed his presence and the way it felt good to just have him around.
His smile, Cas thought, it felt so good. It was beautiful, of course it was beautiful, it always was. But apart from that, it was also warm, it was honest, and it sparked that nice feeling inside his chest.
"I really wasn't," Cas said calmly. "You don't have to sign it. Your decision. But if you don't, I can't tell you"
"Yeah," Dean smiled. "The little sunshine deserves some fun time with her father. And if we get an unforeseen emergency situation, I got your number"
"Yeah," Cas agreed. And again, they were smiling at each other. This time, Cas didn't try to look away, to break the eye contact or interrupt the moment. This time, it was okay. That was Dean, that was his
Then, Dean did something entirely unexpected. He slowly leaned in, bringing his face closer to Cas's by passing the little distance that had been between them before.
Very hesitantly, Claire lifted her head up again and looked up. This time, she didn't seem as scared. She still was rather shy and insecure about that stranger, but she let go off Cas's leg.
"Oh yes you did," she said. "It's not easy looking like a couple without doing anything obvious, but you really delivered in there. Great chemistry, guys"
"No, she's absolutely right," Missouri agreed, "I've never seen anyone look bad with flowers on their head. And I bet Dean's gonna agree that you look cute with some flowers on top of that pretty face"
"Yeah," Cas replied softly. "You know, Dean, everybody has their flaws. It's human. And someone's flaws don't automatically make them a bad person. I think it really depends on what they decide to do about it, if they're willing to work on it and better themselves. And you, you're really trying, you're trying to become a better man, you're trying to leave your father behind, you ... I think that matters, Dean. A lot."
"No," I agreed, "No, it's not. But that's nothing I could ever change. It's just who I am. So if that makes me a sinner in your eyes, if that makes me unsuitable for the position I am currently in ..." I swallowed, "Then maybe it'd be best if you'd just tell me right now"
Cas didn't resist the slightest and let Dean drag him out of the office into the hallway. They were now standing there in the quiet hallway, and Cas finally looked up and met Dean's eyes.
"My head hurts," she said. "It's pounding. And everything else hurts. My arms hurt, and my legs. Everything"
"I see," Cas said and leaned back again, Dean's hand still on his, his thumb now drawing soft circles on Cas's skin. Cas reacted to it with a little smile that Dean returned right away.
"I don't know," Dean chuckled, "she either doesn't or she's good at hiding it. Maybe she's like you and has no idea"
Then, he had tried to secretly steal a look over Dean’s shoulder. The attempt had resulted in Dean throwing a handful of flour at him. After that, Cas had accepted his fate and – flour in his hair - went on to concentrate on his own baking.
So they walked next to each other in awkward silence until they reached the hotel. Before they entered the building, Dean reached for Cas's hand again. Cas let him, he knew it would look weird if he didn't, but he didn't know how to feel about it.
"Oh come on," he rolled his eyes. "I'm not jacking it to the way some musician grabs his mic. I’m not that desperate"
"It's mostly the hopes on the instagram story," Charlie now joined the conversation. "We know Alec, and he usually shares some behind the scenes snaps of his shootings online, so having him share something were you can be seen for just a second probably will turn some fans into Sherlock Holmes"
It took unusually long until the door was opened, and to Cas's surprise, it didn't happen via the buzzer. No, someone actually opened it from the inside, and he suddenly saw Jo's - the Jo who you'd expect to be there - smiling face.
"I know it's a lot," Dean said at the end of his explanation, "especially in such short time. And it would be really really
After my talk with Mr. Price I wandered through the hallways on my way back to Dean. I couldn’t wait to tell him about whatever it was that had just happened, about how incredibly lucky we were and that it would all be fine.
"Did you like what we did with the song?" Dean casually asked as they were walking. He had put sunglasses on again, but these ones had different glasses and Cas was able to at least see the outlines of his eyes.
Cas hadn't thought Dean would remember something he had quickly mentioned on the phone, especially not with his PR worries about a charity event and all those headlines, but apparently he did, and he really wanted to know more about it.
He knew he'd have to talk to him at some point. They were on tour together, and they still had this agreement, so not talking to him ever again obviously wasn't an option. Cas just didn't know how to do that, what to say, even how to approach this. Because this had happened, and they had to address it in some way, right?
Cas kept looking into Dean's eyes, still processing that he had offered that just like that, and Dean kept smiling at him.
Cas didn't realize that right away. His first reaction was to check on Claire, who was now down on the ground crying and holding her little knee.
Had she been crying? He thought, had his daughter really been crying right next to him with him just sleeping through that?
but I think they just don't make the connection that it could be you. Why should it be you, from an outside perspective, why should it be? It's just someone who's got some resemblance."
He freed one of his hands and lifted it to softly brush over Cas's cheek, making the man in his arms chuckle before they linked their hands on Cas's stomach again.
Cas sighed. "Okay," he then said calmly, "alright. Why don't we both take a breath and sit down and discuss this like rational adults?"
"Yeah," Dean said as he wiped the last remains of ice cream from his jacket. Then he smiled right back at the employee. "I had a change in the schedule and thought I'd pop in today; I hope that doesn't throw things upside down for you?"
"Yeah," Cas said, "that way you bring in the chorus again, but it's not that repetitive because you leave out its first part"
“Yeah,” he smirked. “Also, I like to think of this as dates. I’m a gentleman; I won’t have my date pay for their own drinks”
"Do me a favour and stop reading comments," Dean said softly, "okay? For your own good. You really don't need that in your life."
"Yeah," Cas breathed absentmindedly as Charlie was already dialling a new number. He kept staring at the screen for another moment until Dean softly pulled his arm around his waist and dragged him away from Charlie's desk.
During the drive, they didn't talk much. It was mostly Claire pointing out things on the street or asking her father what certain buttons in the car were for, and Charlie watched with a smile how Cas patiently explained.
"What?" Cas asked again, but Charlie still didn't react to him. Instead, she pulled out her phone and dialled a number. Cas could only hear her say "Dean. My office. Right now." before she hung up and turned back to staring at her screen, this time covering her mouth with her hand.
"They're idiots, Cas," she said. "They're nothing but stupid hateful losers. You're way better than that, and especially now, you're in a position to just not give a fuck about them."
"Okay," Jo made, now it sounded like she was thinking. "What's your pros and cons? I know you probably made a list"
to. I worked on the album and it'd be amazing to see the songs I helped writing be performed on stage, but ... I don't know. Maybe it's not the best idea"
"Please, sit down," he said and pointed at one of the two chairs on the other side of his desk. I walked the few steps over and sat down on the first one, never looking at him, only as I sat I nervously looked up to meet his eyes.
I looked for Dean all around the school. The first place I went to was the library, but he wasn’t there. Nothing but his empty chair was sitting there in between the bookshelves. I walked around the classrooms, the community spaces, even the dining hall, but Dean was nowhere to be seen.
There I sat, making myself nervous with all those thoughts while pretending to work on an essay. Had I calmed down just a bit, though, and looked up one more time instead of driving myself insane with the questions, I would have noticed that Dean himself was trying to hide a faint blush on his cheeks by leaning down closer into his book.
"Mh," Dean made. With a smirk, he pulled up his arm and checked his watch. "There's 35 minutes left until you've gotta pick Claire up. Also, we've never done it on this couch"
"Yeah," he sighed again. "It's that ... I mean I've been doing that with him for a while now. And I ... I mean things have happened between us, in the context of our fake relationship, of course, that have ... The thing is, maybe I like kissing him a bit too much, and I'm just scared that if I go on tour with him ... I've never been so close to him for such a long time, and I don't know if I can do that. I don't know if maybe I should ... you know, try to go on distance with him, before I ..."
Then, Cas asked Jo about the form for the confidentiality agreement for his friend, and she immediately went into the file on her computer and asked him to give her the friend's personal information.
In the beginning, Cas had tried to find out what Dean was on about. First, he had tried asking. All that Dean had said was that it was a surprise and he would see soon enough.
"Oh, no," Cas smiled back at him, "That day's Claire's birthday, and I wanna make some time for her"
Not that he wouldn’t have done the exact same thing to me. God no, he absolutely did. Though, as excited as I was about everything that was happening, I was strangely focused on him. I was about to have sex for the very first time, and both my mind and body were equally excited about that, but at the same time, there was
“Well,” I chuckled, “I’m the youngest teacher here, and pretty much the only one under 50. There was Andrew of course – the one you’re substituting for. He’s only slightly older than me, but that didn’t safe him from breaking his leg”
"No, I think he does," Cas said, "to a certain extent. He said we'd figure something out, and I'm pretty sure he'd make sure we have someone to look after her when I can't bring her to a show and stuff, but ... generally, a month of constant travelling around?"
"Yeah," Dean chuckled, "she definitely doesn't have any problems keeping up with the travelling or the shows"
"What should I have done in your opinion?" He chuckled. "I wasn't allowed to tell you that I know him. And apart from that, you were absolutely right, so ..."
Then it was late that night, Claire and Cas had said goodbye to Jo who wished them all the best for the tour, and they were back on the way to the hotel where both of them fell into the bed in exhaustion. Cas watched over Claire next to him until she had fallen asleep, and then, after he softly stroked her hair out of her little face and made sure she had enough of the blanket tucked over her, he relaxed and fell asleep as well.
Dean has told Cas about pretty much every secret he’s ever had in his entire life, and he’s rather sure that Cas has done the same thing. Dean knows a lot of things about Cas, and many of those are things about which Cas has made him swear he’d never tell anyone about it.
A quick Google search showed him the closest pharmacy. Closed until 9am, the online entry said. 9am, less than two hours. He could do that, he thought. Claire could handle that.
"Oh," Dean only made. It was obvious that he hadn't known that, which was somehow surprising to Cas because Dean usually knew who was or wasn’t in. On the other hand, he had been upstairs in the studio all morning and Cas hadn't seen him downstairs even once, so he probably had just assumed Garth was in the office with Cas just like the previous days.
"Well, I had to sign a confidentiality agreement and stuff. And they said if I tell people about it they'd have to agree to not talk about it, but I'm not sure what exactly that means. Like if I have to make you sign something as well. I gotta ask them about that."
And it really did help. Her temperature seemed to go down over the course of the day, and in the evening, she told him that the aches were still there but lighter than before.
“Yeah,” I said. “I wouldn’t go as far as to say that he fully supports us. He did call me a sinner, after all. It’s more that I’m a popular teacher and he’s not a big fan of rumours”
“No, I mean, it’s true,” he shrugged with a smirk, “But I got the handsome genes, so that’s alright”
“A Shakespearean Sonnet typically consists of 14 lines, Sir,” he answered. “There’s 3 quatrains followed by a Couplet with the volta line coming after line 12. The metre usually is an iambic pentameter.”
So Dean paid and left a generable tip for their nice waitress, and they left. Dean stood at first and waited a second for Cas to get up, then as he stood in front of him he immediately pressed a quick kiss on his cheek. Then, he took his hand with a smile and they left.
Cas eyed her as she said that. He hadn't thought before about how Dean's career might have started. He hadn't thought about a lot of things, he just now realized, and basically he didn't know a thing about the man he was pretending to be dating. Well, he now knew he had recorded his first 'album' on an old tape in the garage with his childhood friend, and the image of that scene made Cas feel something he couldn't exactly define, but he only now realized that he had no idea who Dean even was, and that he was the odd one out in a group of people that had known that man for years, if not even decades, or all his life.
“It was fun,”, he then shrugged with a happy smile on his face. “She used to put on Christmas music for baking, and we always sang along in our horribly off-key child voices.”
"Alright," Cas said and sat up a bit straighter. "WMR music. You heard the name before because I asked you about it. WMR music is Dean Winchester's record label."
to stop. He had gotten into the lyrics bit by now, he had found his pace and his way of work, and it was fun, he liked what he was doing. And he liked Dean, and Charlie and Jo, and Garth, and even Ed and Harry that he had barely ever seen so far.
Cas could've facepalmed himself that moment. So, he was an idiot. He was an absolute idiot, and his best friend had been right all along, with everything, with every little detail she had suspected.
He looked down to see this gesture, then looked up into my eyes again. Insecure, surprised. A nod from me, and Dead pulled his hands out of his own pockets.
"Hey," Charlie said with a supportive smile, "You're gonna rock this, I'm sure. You and Dean have been putting on an award worthy performance every day so far, you can absolutely convince people you're on a coffee date"
“It was a man,” I stuttered, “He wore a dark coat and a hat, I … I couldn’t see his face, but he was standing right here, and he was watching us, Dean, he … He was looking directly at us. He
He stopped, looking at Dean with all the insecurities showing on his face. Dean looked back at him with one of those soft smiles Cas liked so much to see from him.
"I've already read it twice," Cas replied with a smile. "It's perfect as it is. Stop worrying, and just do it. It'll be fine"
"Well thanks for that heads-up," Cas said. Great, he thought. A bad day at home, and a salty Dean on top of that. Truly amazing.
He knew Dean came with that addition, he had known that from the very beginning, and by now he had made the decision to not only accept the addition but fully face it. He wouldn't let it drag him down, he had decided. He would embrace it.
"Right," Cas chuckled. "I really thought he was just some guy. When people started taking photos of him, I kinda started doubting."
"If I say yes," he now asked, "What about Claire? You basically want me to sell my face to the press, what about my daughter?"
Even though, he also thought, it was kind of ironic to have a musician as successful as Dean be this event’s celebrity face and not utilize any of his music at all.
Dean chuckled at that. Track number 4 of the album was one of the songs Cas had worked on with him, and it was a song about overcoming fears in your everyday life.
A sleepless night later I was sure that this was the only explanation for Dean’s behaviour that made sense, but at the same time I couldn’t believe it.
Maybe, Cas thought, maybe he could just mention that he saw people pointing this out, and leave it to Dean to carry on the conversation.
Some people online were also talking about Dean's comment, or not-comment, on the child in the picture and video. They took his silence on her identity as confirmation of the rumour that she was in fact the boyfriend's daughter, and that Dean had confirmed having asked to take the video down only solidified their convincement.
"Okay, first of all," he said, "really sweet lyrics. Love that. And I think breaking the repetition up with that different bit is a great idea"
"There you go. You're amazing, Cas, really. And it wouldn't hurt you to acknowledge that a bit more. Also, maybe you're playing pretend with him, so what? You're literally getting paid to let
"Yeah," he said. Well, not right now, not at 6 in the morning. "You're gonna have to wait a bit, though. It's really early. But I'll get you some medication later, that will make it better"
Even though they have met on tumblr and used to have long and deep conversations over the app's chat function, they exchanged numbers and switched over to text messages a while ago. It was in one of those phases where tumblr refused to show Castiel his messages, so he asked Dean if he would be comfortable with sharing his number. Ever since that day, they communicate mostly via texts. They still have long and deep conversations, at least sometimes. Other times it's silly jokes, memes, or rants about their daily life. Either way, Castiel always loves every single message from Dean. They always make him excited to open them. Well, except this one. He's genuinely scared to open this one.
Next thing he did was calling Missouri. The elder lady lived a couple streets over and had been volunteering as Claire's babysitter for most of the girl's life so far. They had met by chance on the street a few years ago when Cas had just moved into this house and was taking baby Claire on a walk in her stroller, and ever since then, she had become a friend for Cas and sort of a grandma for Claire.
That was about to change when Dean asked him to come outside the hotel with him that day. They didn't even make it outside, because when they stepped out of the elevator, Dean spotted a tall man in the lobby and started waving towards him with an excited grin. The man turned and saw Dean waving, and he gave a short wave back with a smile.
Something told him to close his eyes and just enjoy Dean's kisses on his body, but Cas wanted, he needed to see Dean doing it. He wanted to look down to see Dean on his knees before him, he wanted to see that beautiful face, those outstanding freckles, and especially those incredible eyes that now glanced up to meet his with such widened pupils and such a hot expression in them.
“Yeah,” Dean smiled, “Because it’s true. I love your writing. I’ve loved all your writing, ever since the very first poem”
The biggest secret Dean is keeping for Cas probably is the one he told him just a few months ago. Dean still remembers that day very well, maybe because it happened not that long ago, but probably rather because hearing Cas say what he said did cause him an undefinable chaos of emotions that he still doesn’t really know how to handle.
“Yeah,” he contemplated for a second, “Maybe. But on the other hand, you know … I couldn’t risk anyone else noticing I was trying to flirt. It had to be subtle.”
"Oh god you should see your faces right now," Dean laughed. "So, Cas here is on the one hand our badly needed support on the lyrics issues, but at the same time he's gonna help me out with the PR fiasco we talked about"
"Mh," Cas hummed thoughtfully. He had never been told before to have chemistry with anyone, and for some reason, that threw him off.
And that's chapter 11 :) I hope y'all are doing well and aren't too hungover from the Destiel wedding on Sunday ;)
As he leaned in, he could see that her browser was opened on a twitter feed, but the busy newsfeed didn't make sense to him at the first glance.
The two of them were in the garden when he walked in through the gate. They were sitting in the grass, and Cas wasn't entirely sure what they were doing, but as he walked closer, he noticed the flower crown on his daughter's head and several single flowers sticked into Missouri's hair.
"Uhm, kinda, yeah," Cas said. "We talked a bit, he bought Claire new ice cream, really sweet. Then he just asked if I'd be interested in a job, and here we are"
"Anyway," Jo said, "I have a feeling there's something you wanna talk about? Or did you just feel like having a nice chat with me at a time you're usually asleep already?"
would hear them and just make it a bit easier for me, give me the strength and the courage to overcome them.
Now Cas just blatantly stared. "Uhm ... you want me to ..." he stuttered, "No, seriously, Dean, you can't do that."
“No,” I said. “You’re not just a guy to me. You’re the only person in the world I ever kissed, that’s quite a lot more than just some guy”
The moment was suddenly interrupted by Dean's phone announcing a new text message with a loud sound, and both men hastily glanced away to avoid the other one's eyes.
They had breakfast as always, with Claire happily babbling about it being her birthday and how old and grown up she now was, and after that Cas took her back to her room where she was allowed to pick out her outfit for the day.
