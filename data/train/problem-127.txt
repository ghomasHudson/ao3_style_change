this, not just the sex, but life with Sherlock, more than he had ever wanted anything, and there were days, still, where it seemed like a dream, too good to be real.
‘I would need to look at her normal clothes. There’s a level of anonymity inherent in fencing gear. No colour deviation. Little in the way of personalisation… She’s not wealthy but not poor either. This kit is not quite top of the range and is several years old. Well-cared for, but not new. Repaired more than once. Either she could not afford a new kit when the old one was damaged or she had better things to spend her money on.’ Sherlock let his hand fall away. ‘Beyond that, I can’t deduce much. Not without disturbing the body further in search of personal effects.’
'I'll be in touch,' Sherlock murmured, 'when I know more. Shall I pass your regards on to Mycroft?'
He didn’t know what the future held, but Mary was right. Wherever life took him, both Sherlock and Baker Street would be right there at his side.
'With any luck, we'll have the opportunity to make the first move,' he decided. 'If we can break this stalemate on our terms, we will have the advantage.'
Sherlock turned, almost impaling himself on the barrel of her gun as he stared down at her. He could feel the stamp of the pistol's muzzle against his chest, hard enough to leave a bruise, and one of Mary's eyebrows lifted in query.
'Yesterday you said it was about AGRA. What – what could it be? I thought that was all over.'
'Not even if it was to keep you safe?'
'Eat,' Sherlock urged. 'Would you have wine, beer or something else?'
Wielding his knife and fork, he balanced a small pile of chips on the edge of the plate closest to Sherlock. It would take a while, but he knew by the time they were done the chips would be gone, transported to Sherlock's lips by agile, absent-minded fingers.
Around them, the dappled sunlight dimmed, blotted out by the gathering clouds. They robbed the world of its warmth, and John shivered, reaching for Rosie and getting clumsily to his feet. 'I think it's time to go in. You, little miss, need a bath before dinner.' He blew a raspberry against Rosie's neck, and Sherlock winced as she screamed in delight. From the outside, it was a blissful scene. No one seeing it would ever imagine the pain and strife the two Watsons had struggled through – and continued to fight even now.
He spread his hands around the vile trophy, not touching, but framing the space, as if trying to capture and funnel all the information they could give him. ‘All middle fingers.’
John may have stopped describing his skills as amazing quite some time ago, but his expression said it all. The look he sent Sherlock’s way was equal parts amused and impressed, and Sherlock struggled not to bask in the glow of approval.
‘Jesus, it looks like you’re lucky he didn’t take your eye out.’
‘Right,’ he croaked, wetting his lips and stammering in surprise as Sherlock’s fingers grabbed his cuff, practically dragging him out of the Yard.
Water dripped down his neck, collecting under his collar and turning his hair to spikes. His jeans were soaked, the heavy denim dragging at his hips as his socks squelched in his boots. He looked pitiful. John knew that well enough, but he could not bring himself to seek shelter.
Even if he could lie to everyone else, could keep up the façade of best friend and nothing more, he knew it would be a load of bollocks. All the agony and relief since Sherlock’s return had stripped away John’s platonic illusions, leaving him torn between his promises to Mary and the potential of him-and-Sherlock.
‘She didn’t get that far. Who was the last person she fought? They were probably having a bout just before this happened.’
‘I pulled some strings. Played the system.’ John wrinkled his nose, feeling a hot flash of satisfaction at Sherlock’s obvious approval. On the surface, it looked like he was just happy that John was breaking the rules, but he knew different. He was reminding John of his own power: a strength that existed outside the tight confines of society. A strength he could use whenever he chose, one that didn’t come from a hand on his gun or the curl of his fist. ‘He needed it.’
At first glance it didn’t look it, but Sherlock had a different kind of camouflage. He didn’t try and fade into the background, though he probably could if he wanted to. Instead, he used flamboyance as a lure – a challenge. He hid in plain sight, front and centre. Oh, people saw him well enough, but they didn’t see the truth of him. They didn’t see him as a threat.
If he let them know he was onto them, this whole thing – whatever it was – could blow up in his face. For now, they were happy to hang back and observe. If he changed the status-quo it could force them into action, and he wasn't sure he was ready to confront whatever that entailed.
Grumbling, he set off in search of something else. It was late enough that all the school cafes had closed for the day. The last lectures had ended hours ago, and the halls stood, ominous in their tranquillity.
'Yes.'
Sherlock looked at him, and maybe John was so tired and confused he was starting to imagine things, but he thought he saw a glimmer of hurt lingering in his features. ‘Of course.’
‘For Sherlock.’ Greg shook his head ruefully. ‘You suit each other, you know. Anyone with eyes can see that. Not sure what that says about you, mind.’
London at ground level could be a restrictive mass of roads and alleys, crowds and traffic. Oh, there were ways through, but he refused to limit himself to the two-dimensional restraints of the city’s structure. Why should he go through, when he could just as easily go up and over?
The bed remained a temptation, but not the inevitability it had been only a short while ago. Some paracetamol would help chase off the lingering aches, and while he knew it was still a journey to recover his health, it felt good to be taking the first step.
At last, after too many months, the time came to make his move.
They ate in companionable silence, the sounds of the traffic on Baker Street drifting up to them and the steady clunk of the old heating pipes providing an unlikely harmony. It was the calm before the storm: a brief interlude of peace, and John revelled in it.
He looked towards the fire; the flames banked low against the damp chill that pervaded the Georgian building. 'It's an angle of consideration we cannot afford to ignore. The question is, why now? Why after Mary's death? I could understand her being observed by people who knew of her involvement in AGRA, either those who were members of the team or who knew of its existence, but after she's gone? Unless there was something in her possession others sought, something they think John may now have?' Sherlock chewed absently on the side of his thumb, scowling at the grate. 'I need more data.'
They were talking about Christmas.
Sally let them duck under the tape and step through into the room beyond. The door swung shut in their wake with disturbing finality, leaving them standing in air laden with the smell of metal.
Wincing at the throbbing of his head, he shuffled towards the door, bracing what weight he could on his bound arms before gaining his feet. The world gave a ghastly dip, and he flinched, narrowing his eyes against the sunlight as his gaze fell to the prone form on the floor: a young man, thin and slight in build.
John's bark of laughter sounded high and thin to his own ears, and he swallowed it down. 'Normal?' he demanded. The seethe of his temper, always so close to the surface these days, erupted through the cracks in his composure. 'When has my life ever been normal? This needs to stop, Sherlock. Now.'
Sherlock let out a quick, quiet breath as he opened the door to the car that awaited them: a black Mercedes. 'I'm not keen on it either, but Mycroft's logic is sound. If we are unaware of Rosie’s location, then we cannot compromise her safety. We cannot give up a secret we don't have in our possession.' He slipped in behind the steering wheel, starting the engine as John climbed into the passenger seat.
'In a bit,' Sherlock promised, resting his hand against John's feverish brow before pulling away. 'Go to sleep. My body's used to going without. Yours, however, needs all the help it can get.'
He nodded, not uttering another word. He doubted Sherlock would choose the stealthy route to the flat. He'd park at the front door, the better to announce their return, and John was damned if he was stepping into the spotlight unarmed.
Sherlock frowned at the envelope. Blank. Not even marked with his name, as if John couldn't bring himself to scrawl it on the cheap paper. 'Right.'
'I can't say.' Sherlock shrugged in apology. 'I would like to think she was earnest in her wish for normality. What little evidence we have suggests that this group have been watching you and Rosie since before Mary's death. Perhaps they sought her out when she left that life behind. Maybe they have been observing her and, by extension, you, for even longer than we realise.'
Someone was breaking in. It seemed too early in the evening for burglary. A thief after valuables would wait until they were certain everyone was asleep. No, whoever this was, they knew the building was occupied. They weren't after things, but people.
The whisper of their panting breaths filled the air: a susurrus of benediction. John slumped back to the pillow, too spent to even wipe his hand on the bedsheets. He felt as if he had been turned inside out, broken down and built up anew into something better.
'They're gone. Thanks.'
'What?'
That, Mycroft mused, would explain the faint softening of Sherlock’s sharp angles. He never had been able to resist the stuff.
She didn’t have an answer, too lost in the depths of the sobbing fit she’d worked herself into.
John inhaled, realising he meant it. There were many things about today that would riddle him with doubt for months to come, but the fact that he had been the one to let the bullet fly was not one of them. Mary had not been taken from him by another's actions – stolen away as John was left powerless to act. He alone had been responsible; there was no way he could blame anyone else for the outcome. The consequences were his to bear for the rest of his days.
'It won't come to that,' he said at last, tilting his glass in a quick toast of promise. 'I don't think it can, not any more. We've known each other too long. Lived together for fucking years... It's not like I'm shacking up with a stranger I've only taken on three dates or anything.' John shook his head, casting away all thought of him and Sherlock and the glorious, brilliant, mad
He offered up his phone to John, who took it with a puzzled shake of his head and pressed it to his ear. 'Hello?'
One never took so much as a single drag from the cigarette in his grasp. Now and then it would burn down to the filter, and he would light another, only to cling to it and do nothing.
With a glance at his watch, John hurried back downstairs, smiling to see Sherlock standing in front of the French doors with Rosie in his arms, pointing out the flitting songbirds beyond the window. She seemed as fascinated with him as she did the shapes outside, and her pout when John retrieved her could have rivalled Sherlock's in the deepest pits of his sulks.
He sat at the far end, the space between them demanding to be bridged, but Sherlock had no idea where to start. A cacophony of words pressed against his lips, but he could give none of them voice, not when he was terrified that one wrong utterance could push John away forever.
'Yet your champion lies dead only a short distance away.'
Baker Street was old and had plenty of quirks that could work in their favour. Anyone unfamiliar with the building would be unaware of the way the steps creaked and how the living room floor in their flat sighed whenever Mrs Hudson shut her front door. Still, he'd rather make any intruder's life as difficult as possible.
Mellow afternoon sunlight coated everything in hazy gold, making him look like some nubile god in repose: perfectly tempting. All the little chores John had intended to do before he went and picked up Rosie from nursery at the end of the day flew from his mind, scattered to the four winds. This was far more important.
Going too fast now would set him back days. Still, if he could manage to stay upright and drip feed himself some decent energy, then perhaps he could get clean and start to feel more like himself by the day's end. Already, the food was doing the trick, providing his body with what it needed to heal and the fuel it required to keep going.
He felt rather than heard the intruders flee, their looming presence fading from his senses. John shivered, waiting where he sat as one minute, then two more slipped past. Sherlock had told him to stay where he was, but the noise had startled Rosie. Faint whimpers plucked at his heartstrings, and he shushed her, pressing a kiss to her brow as he pushed open the wardrobe door.
The game was on.
John huffed, jerking his head in quick denial even as the words sank in. It had crossed his mind; how could it not? One of the questions that came circling back to him was why now? Why, when Mary was gone, had this begun? Was it simply one of Sherlock's enemies choosing a moment of weakness, or was Mary's death a trigger for something unknown and unseen?
'And that is what we do not want. The illusion of control keeps Ms Morstan somewhat predictable in her behaviour. Since we both agree it is unlikely that they are rushing to her aid, then we must assume that they are after Sherlock.'
‘Bastard.’ Tyson hissed through his teeth, his struggles futile. Sherlock had the balance and the leverage. ‘Fuckin’ bastard.’ A hint of grudging respect tinted his voice as he raised his fist in the ring’s symbol of surrender. ‘Gallagher. The prick you’re looking for is Dougie Gallagher.’
'No, no. Those are communal blades. Cheap by necessity. A champion would use their own, so where is it?' Sherlock turned away, stripping off his gloves and reaching for his phone, no doubt already harassing Lestrade to find the key piece of the scene, most noticeable in its absence.
His leg ached, and he clenched a hand around it, watching the world rush by through half-closed eyes. Exhaustion nibbled at the edges of his mind, but he couldn't let go and drift into slumber. Not until he knew where they were going and made sure Rosie was truly safe. Adrenaline's flow kept him awake, hovering in the glassy, jet-lagged state of the sleep-deprived, and he barely noticed as they turned off the broad expanse of the motorway and into narrower, tree-lined streets.
'No. I assume that means there is nothing glaringly obvious at the location, so he is endeavouring to cover all the bases.'
'If I were in your place,' he began at last, 'I would make preparations with Mycroft for Rosie's safety, but bide my time. There has been no indication that we have been discovered, or that the Greek Team has even thought to look outside London. It's unlikely they have the resources for a nationwide search. Something will happen in due course to lure us back to the capital. That is when you get Rosie to a different, secure location.' He cocked his head, one corner of his mouth quirking upwards. 'Ideally, you would also take sanctuary out of harm's way, but I know you too well to expect as much.'
He winced, not wanting to witness Sherlock's inevitable disdain, but none emerged. Sherlock merely nodded as if John's request were the most natural thing, setting up an absent-minded rhythm as he stroked one of John's knuckles with his thumb.
Reflected in the mirror, Mycroft raised an eyebrow. Sherlock had assumed his (stupid) question to be rhetorical, but it seemed he expected an answer.
His heart hammered beneath his ribs, frantic and sick. He longed to call her bluff, to claim she would never hurt the man she professed to adore, but even he knew it would do him no good. Mary treated emotions like masks that could be picked up and dropped to one side. John was as much a tool to her as everyone else, and the truth tasted bitter in the back of his throat.
He would not let it go, Sherlock realised. John could be doggedly persistent at the most inconvenient times. Even if he managed to somehow redirect the conversation – even if life conspired to somehow distract them both – John would come back to it later.
'What else?' he croaked, clearing his throat and running his hands down his thighs, banishing the clammy sweat that had sprung up across his palms. 'You mentioned you had found where they were based?'
Sherlock nodded, struggling to his feet and examining the ravaged remains of his shirt. In the end, he pulled it on before shrugging the discarded Belstaff on top and doing up the buttons to hide the damning evidence. He stood, toeing into his shoes, and waited for John to finish his call.
They mixed and merged, pressing in at him from all sides, their clarity edged with other, monstrous images that had no place in the real world: nameless, chasing dread and the vice of fear at John's throat. Something, somewhere, hunted him. Heat and cold in equal measure. Glass skin that split and bled and dropped his insides at his feet, awful in every way.
He tried to cling to the positives, to acknowledge that the alternative – John being hospitalised because of this illness – was far worse, but their current situation felt so passive that it frayed Sherlock's nerves, leaving him edgy and tired. He'd taken to sleeping on the floor of his own bedroom, allowing John all the space and comfort the bed could offer while still being able to respond should John need him.
'I suspect it was hidden nearby,' Mycroft explained, marching in the direction of the vans with his head down as a dozen or so operatives formed a protective circle, all eyes on the sky. 'As for where they acquired it: the Russian black market, I imagine. A number of decommissioned military vehicles find their way into private hands every year.'
When he had lost John?
'Fat chance of that.' John rubbed his hand up and down Rosie's back. 'I'm not stupid.'
Cold and insipid, Norbury watched the world through hooded eyes. Her hair hung loose, unstyled, and her face sagged with age and exhaustion. John expected to hate the sight of her, yet it was pity that twisted through his chest. She looked like someone's grandmother; hardly villain material. It was difficult to believe that this was the woman who had pulled the trigger and caused Mary's death. She didn't look capable, at least until she smiled: a cynical curve of thin lips that made John narrow his eyes in distrust.
‘I’m guessing she can’t claim self-defence?’
'Thanks. What about testing?' A sympathetic smile tweaked his mouth as Sarah made a rough, growling noise. 'I take it that's a no?'
He traversed the short distance to the door of 221 Baker Street on shaky legs. His key scraped the lock plate as he fought his way inside, shutting out the world and casting off his Belstaff. The seventeen steps loomed before him: his own, personal Everest. At their peak lay a flat he had not truly called “home” since his return to London. His domain it may be, but without John, Baker Street remained incomplete: a roof over his head and little more.
‘Thanks for the curry, and the entertainment!' John chuckled, shoving Greg's shoulder when he glowered. 'I'll text you in a couple of days. Let you know if Mrs Hudson has any ideas about flats. Enjoy your time off.'
Greg lounged in Sherlock’s chair, watching them both. The fact Sherlock had acquired a flatmate was more than a bit surprising. Mycroft was probably having kittens about it. After all, solitude was the only way Sherlock could attain anything approaching mental and emotional peace. Surely sharing Baker Street with someone would be more trouble than it was worth?
alive?' Sherlock raised an eyebrow. 'If she did fake her own demise, would you forgive her as you did me?'
'I can't believe you spent all week with me and didn't get ill,' John mused, picking up his mug and taking a sip of his tea. 'I bet if we did an antibody test, you'd have them.'
They were John’s armour.
Besides, the cooler months heralded the return of one of John’s favourite things: the Belstaff. During the insouciant summer, it was too mild for the heavy wool. Only now, as Bonfire Night barrelled towards them, did Sherlock grab it from his wardrobe and fling it around his shoulders like a hero’s cape.
Sherlock braced his hand on the filing cabinet, pulling himself to his feet and limping around the edge of the room towards the door. Leaning against the wall, he peered along the concrete trackway. The airfield had been constructed in a logical grid shape, offering clear lines of sight. From what he'd noticed of the place as Mary marched him through, as well as the noise from the helicopter guns, they must have set the Hind down on the grassy square in the middle. 'We need to move.'
He realised, on some level, that there was more to making Baker Street a good home for Rosie than merely buying supplies. He would have to make space for her: physical, mental and, he suspected, emotional. Rosie would be as much a part of Sherlock's life as John's, a fact which scared and delighted him in equal measure, but some sacrifices would have to be made.
He'd been calling it friendship, shoving it in a box where it didn't fit in the hopes that, somehow, that's what it would become. That would be the limits of it, and all the messiness would be cleaved away.
Watson had long since made his peace with the fact that he had fallen in love with a man incapable of loving him in return. Oh, he was quite aware that Holmes loved him, but they loved each other differently. Watson never felt as if anything were missing. He had Mrs. Hudson and he had Sherlock Holmes and that was enough for him. He did not share his bed with anyone, but the warmth of the kitchen table, the sitting room at 221B, and in the kitchen garden of a seaside cottage in the South Downs, he had found his family. He asked if Holmes might be willing to take on a lodger here in this cottage. Part time at first, but after a year or so, perhaps permanently. Holmes lit up in a way Watson was unsure if he'd ever seen before and agreed readily, nearly tripping over his words as he did so.
Watson moaned and jerked, ineffectually trying to bat my hands away from his face.  I murmured softly, indistinctly, at him as he came awake as I pressed the ice wrapped in a damp cloth against his swollen face. He huffed, his face too painful to make any real expression, of annoyance at being awoken, at being hurt, or even being coddled by me.
"What are you doing?"
"You fight crime. With a shield. Dressed in that absolutely ridiculous ensemble."
"I love you, John Watson."
The private carriage was courtesy Mycroft and the swathes of bandages and blankets insured our relative anonymity as we returned to London. Holmes had not regained true consciousness since I had found him splayed out on the rocks at the foot of the falls. I was a doctor and I knew what this meant - a brain injury of this scale. I could only hope that he would be one of the miracle cases, but the Sherlock Holmes as we knew him was dead.
"You know nothing, Watson."  He spat the words at me.
"You pulled me out," he said.  "You pulled me out," he repeated.  "I owe you," he began, "I owe you my thanks-"
Holmes returned from the dead and so too were resurrected the patterns of their life before. There were cases with Holmes and Sunday roasts with Mrs. Hudson and Watson was happy for many years. But time passed and eventually Mrs. Hudson's discussions about retiring became more concrete and less hypothetical until one day she told Watson, over an American style pie he had made, that she had finally decided not to sell 221, but rather would let her niece inherit the townhouse while she relocated to some place cleaner and quieter. Even Holmes spoke about life at a slower pace, catching Watson off guard as he discussed leaving his beloved London for a cottage on the South Downs. Watson ignored him until the point where he was very nearly caught off guard by the appearance of crates to pack away Holmes's extensive library. Not yet ready to leave London yet himself, Watson let a house in Kensington and maintained a small practice and a slightly larger charity round in the east end for a few years, spending his holidays with Holmes at the cottage. Without Mrs. Hudson's kitchen or anyone to appreciate his cooking, he found that he missed his Sunday roasts.
"Truly, John?"
I chuckled.
"No, Watson.  No one wanted this case and only Wilde seemed to be surprised that it happened at all.  It had simply gone too far after the Queensbury trial to not proceed.  But as you said, a conviction for sodomy is inevitable but this was prosecution was not brought by zealots bent on punishing those for private matters."
"Next time, don’t pick a fight with a man who has friends," he replied.
The return of Sherlock Holmes, drug addict, broke my heart, and I could not bear it.
I looked back over the darkened street and yawned widely. I was falling asleep on my feet after having been kept awake by Holmes for over two days in pursuit of clues for his latest case.
Watson shifted back, resettling on the bed in a slightly more comfortable position.
Reader, I kissed him.
So here it was, months later, and we were happily back in 221B and I was itching for a bit of rough play.  Watson was napping as I carefully donned my riding outfit and selected the riding crop.  I knelt over him and trailed it across his cheek…
I gave him a look, both of us aware that we had different feelings about what exactly 'undue exertion' was but offered a quiet, "thank you."  He grinned like a schoolboy up to some mischief. I had very little room to talk, having put him through plenty of "undue exertion" last night.
I looked forward to him seeing it, eventually.  He would read his favorite bits of my stories aloud, in a dramatic voice with expansive gestures and exaggerated expressions and I would attempt not to laugh.  Then he would take me to bed and thoroughly ravish me.  It was a game we had played for years to both of our delight.
Holmes huffed out a breath, his amusement clear.  Watson smiled despite the fact that Holmes's eyes had never opened and he wouldn't see it.
After solving the Tregennis murders, Holmes spent the rest of his holiday immersed in the study of Chaldean roots of the Cornish branch of the Celtic language.  I spent mine distracting him as often as possible from it.  At one rather memorable point, I had promised him that I would consider his finishing the manuscript an abject failure to perform my duties as a newly committed partner and that I would do everything in my power to ensure it didn't happen.  I had been quite creative in my distractions.  And very successful.  His manuscript remained unfinished.
Finally, Watson stepped away. "I will cook for you," he said, decisively.
"Good God, Holmes!"
"Holmes!" I exclaimed.  "Was none of that suspicious to you?  Nothing, from the broken glass, to the beeswing, to the bell pull?"
It was years of practice at being interrupted at whatever I was doing with demands of "now, Watson!" that allowed me to meet the Vicar at the door, nearly presentable, if still a bit damp.  Holmes's excitement at investigating an untouched room led me to believe that he had the solution already and was merely thrilled with the opportunity to confirm and prove it.  I grabbed my notebook and we headed back to the Vicarage.
"It won't be Sunday roasts if you don't want them. I know you do not care for them," Watson said, reaching for Holmes's hand. He caught it and pressed his fingers to his lips.
He whirled around and faced me. "And I would know exactly how to get away with it too."
"Or what?"
"Yes, Holmes."
"And after that, you and I will be having a discussion."
"Yes," I groused.  "As I am sure was your intention, I am in fact, awake."
"I’ll show you impeccable aim!" I hollered, pounding on the door.
I quelled him with a look of my own, stern and serious.  He just chuckled at me and tapped his long fingers against his lips. He considered my body up and down as he might a client fresh in our sitting room in Baker Street.  Apparently he believed I merely needed convincing.  The man, damn him, was not wrong.  His particular sort of seduction had always been my undoing, time and time again.
Then, one Sunday, he arrived on the afternoon train. Holmes did not meet him at the station, but Watson walked the easy two miles to the cottage and let himself in the back door. The sight of a large roast complete with vegetables and potatoes and simply drowning in rich fragrant gravy arrested him in the doorway.
The next day I visited an old friend of mine, a doctor who specialized in working with men who wished to be done once and for all with the drugs that ruled their lives.  I returned to Baker Street, Dr. Moore Agar in tow.
Watson's breath caught.  He could count on one hand the number of times Holmes and called him John, first names an intimacy they had rarely shared, even in a friendship going back a decade.
He stood and set about arranging the room in precaution of the drug's effect.  His lips were pressed tight and his eyes pinched with concern.
"The newspaper?" I asked, perplexed.
He lept to his feet, clapping his hands and whirling about.
By the time we finally returned to Baker Street, he was deep in the throes of a vicious withdrawal. I set my mind to do something about what had become of us, and the next morning, I laid out my terms.  I would stay, but only if he quit using cocaine.
His hand raised and pressed against my cheek. I could see tears gather at the corners of his eyes.  He made a quip about madness and I smiled at him.
Although Holmes was certainly the Great Deductionist - he also could be remarkably dense at times when it came to the simplest affairs.  Especially those involving jilted lovers, jealous brothers, or thieving maids. He shook me awake last night after sitting beside me for hours, rambling all the while, still fully dressed, as I slumbered the night away and finally said, “it’s the footman.”
"I will take you any way I can have you, but I will not do so if it means you continue to abuse your body in that way."  I nodded to his needle, empty of his morning dose already and left out in readiness for another one.  "You must be done with cocaine, once and for all."  I rose from the table and left Baker Street for the day.
They lapsed into silence, but not sleep.
"You may be feeling better, but I hardly think-" I began.
When I returned to Baker Street the day after that, Holmes and Dr. Agar were seated in the sitting room together.
"But, I don't understand."
His lips set in a grim line.  "It's necessary."
Holmes looked a little unsure, "Well, I am sure that some mornings I may not be able to, as I cannot predict what cases--"
He stared at me through cold and considering grey eyes.  "You would stay here, in Baker Street, no matter who joined me in my bed?"
"Why does it upset you, so?" I asked carefully, turning the question back on him.  Wilde's prosecution for sodomy after his failed libel case against Queensbury bothered me, true, but that was because I found the man completely astounding in his stupidity.  Holmes, however much he was dismissive of stupidity was rarely angry over it.  Especially when it had nothing to do with a client or case.
I simply responded, “no, it was the maid,” and promptly fell back asleep.
"A little higher Watson," Holmes said with exasperation. I startled and raised the dark lantern up a bit to its original position - illuminating the lock that Holmes was busy picking.
"You were about to say rocks."
As we waited on the cold, quiet railway platform in stoney silence, I glanced over the posters advertising holiday excursions on the Great Western Railway.  Poldhu sounded quite appealing, distant and isolated from the madness that had become my life.
Domestic life with Mary had awoken something in me. I desired something more than long periods of bachelorhood punctuated by moments of overwhelming excitement.  I was content to be Holmes' friend for the rest of our lives, but I did not desire to be an occasional bed partner, no matter how enchanting I found him.
I nodded, waiting for him to continue, but he appeared to be done.  He rose and retired to bed not long after and left me with a gentle squeeze on my shoulder.  A not uncommon gesture from him, but one that seemed to carry more weight tonight than it ever had.  Holmes had said something important to me tonight and I was not quite sure I understood him.
When Holmes died, Watson was immensely grateful for the relationship he had forged with Mrs. Hudson. He was grief-stricken and barely functional for weeks after his return from Switzerland. He invented himself a literary wife so as to not be tempted to pour his pain out through the ink onto the page and lay bare a soul that felt half dead. He drank tea and choked on tears at Mrs. Hudson's kitchen table and was comforted by her steady, quiet presence.
I glanced up from my musings to see Holmes regarding me with a half-smile.
"John, perhaps it would be best if you spent a few more nights away.  I will be able to advise you best after I have had time to consult with Mr. Holmes here and he has been through the worst of his symptoms."
"But you hate roasts," Watson said, eyebrows knitting in confusion as he looked at Holmes.
I let the conversation die at that point my thoughts in too much turmoil to continue.  I was sure Holmes could seem the plain as they ever were to him, but for me, I needed more time to sort through it all.
"We depart this afternoon," I said to Holmes.
Holmes and Watson exchanged their gifts on Christmas day with dinner.  Afterwards, Watson lounged before the fire in his new housecoat and slippers. Holmes had spent the day arranging his new chemistry equipment on the table by the window.  But the bitter cold seeping in through the window the chemistry table was pressed against, and the dark early night of winter taking his light he had moved to his chair before the fire and was quite and curled up with his pipe smoking his putrid tobacco. With evening falling they were growing sleepy and laconic.
"I fear I was still trying to punish you, even after I returned and demanded you come back to me.  It wasn't fair of me, Watson.  The fact that you have not given up on me yet?  Well, it's far more than I deserve."
But instead of answering as he had expected, she instead opened the door to her apartment wider. "You'd best come in, Doctor. Mr. Holmes had said there was no need for tea today, but I see he's neglected to take you into account when deciding such things," she had said.
After our investigation at the Vicarage and my expedition to the village, I met Holmes back at the cottage.  I couldn't help but be excited and was heartened to see that his eyes were bright with focus.  He looked almost healthy, and I preened under his praise as we discussed the lamp and he led me to the conclusion of the case.
I doubt I was fooling either one of us, but bless the man, he did nothing to torment me further.  In fact, it was just the same as it ever was.
6. Has allowed his moustache to grow frightfully bushy, must encourage him to trim it before it leaves a tell-tale rash on my neck
I sighed heavily, quite sure I was being deliberately misunderstood.
Holmes looked up at me and grinned. “Shall we?”
"He'll be convicted and they'll sentence him."  There was really no other outcome possible at this point and everyone knew it.
Once again there was a report on Wilde and I found myself growing a bit tense as I read the report.  It was sensational, and designed to both titlate and entertain and I found myself soon annoyed.
Holmes was manic, flying about the sitting room, newspapers flung all about and notebooks balanced precipitously on whatever available surface there was.  He stopped dead when Dr. Agar followed me into the sitting room.
"That man loathes a roast," she scoffed. "Lamb in mint sauce, veal cutlets, braised salmon, roast duck, curried chicken, and baked haddock. But a roast? No."
But old habits are difficult to break.
He scoffed.
"Sunday dinner," Holmes replied, as if unsure as to how Watson had missed something so obvious.
"Do you know what you are asking?" Watson whispered to Holmes, looking up at him with an open expression.
"What's this?" he asked.
"You enjoy it," he replied, smugly.
"Holmes," Watson interrupted with fond exasperation.
Watson grinned at him, smile lighting up the room, bright as a summer's day, and then he tugged at Holmes's hand and pulled them both back towards Holmes's bedroom.
I did not want to pry as to how he had been friends with Wilde, but since our chat by the fire I had been wondering.  It had only recently begun to dawn on me that perhaps my companion's eschewing of the softer emotions was not quite what it seemed, but rather a lack of interest in the female sex.  For all his bohemian ways, Holmes also was not foppish, but experience had taught me that was not a reliable indicator of deviant behavior.
I didn't give my story the ending it deserved, but instead jotted down some drivel about Holmes never loving a woman in a rush to finish it.  It was quite true: the man had never loved a woman, save, perhaps his mother. But the bit about what he would do if the person he loved met such an end, of that I had no doubt.  That bit was for him to read and tease me over.  I dropped the manuscript at my editor the very next morning, and headed straight to the station after.
, in the case.
"You are not coming."
"Watson - be reasonable."
John Watson was a hedonist in love with an ascetic. Sherlock Holmes didn’t deny himself sex, no, he was too practical to not seek the release that an orgasm wrung from his long thin frame. But love? Affection? Tender touches and the softer emotions? Those were to be avoided and feared. It was no wonder that after attempting to love Sherlock Holmes, Watson found himself turning towards a woman who happily accepted all the love he gave and reflected it back to him with beauty, grace, and kindness.
"Mmmm."
It had been nearly six years since Sherlock Holmes had returned from the dead.  In order to rebuild their friendship, they had cultivated a careful distance between the two of them.  At first, Watson's lingering hurt, anger, and betrayal had made that distance necessary.  But in the last year, that distance had begun to lesson and Watson had learned how to be gentle and careful expressing his love.  There was a hand pressed in thanks, a soft smile, a tap on the wrist to catch one's attention, and even, very occasionally, a clasp of a shoulder to say goodnight.
"I don't know that it does." I answered carefully.  "The man should have never attempted a prosecution of Queensbury.  It was clear to everyone."
So it was quite a shock to be roused long before dawn by the screeching and scraping of a bow across strings in a manner that was surely designed to cause the most obnoxious noise at the loudest volume possible.
He sighed.  "We both know that I can very much go without, and you can very much not.  I am prone to moods and episodes.  There is the issue of the cocaine.  And I don't think you have quite forgiven me for those three years, not yet.  Sharing lodings is one thing, a bed is quite another."
Holmes smiled at him. "No, but I want to. Come home, Watson, it's time."
"-And an apology."  He shook his head at me, his eyes wide in shock.  "It was an unjustifiable experiment.  Even for oneself, but for a friend… I really am, I really, I am, I am very sorry."
My keen eye caught it all as I joined Watson amongst men on the lawn. The stutter and stop, the widening of the eyes, the quickening of breath, the bob of the adam’s apple, and the sweaty palms when he saw me dressed for the hunt the first time. That night was rather spectacular.
Watson took a step forward, then another one and another one and another one. Until he was toe to toe with Holmes.
I was further concerned when he tripped over the watering can. I stepped close to steady him. "You're not yourself at all," I said under my breath, concerned about his exertions and second guessing the wisdom of conducting such activities.
I smiled fondly at his dark look.  He shook his finger at me for good measure, but I refrained from laughing because I wasn't entirely sure he wouldn't follow through on his threat.  He would tolerate a great deal from me, but not anything.
Holmes let out a rather undignified yelp and dropped his bow as I scrambled over the back of the sofa towards him, my displeasure showing clearly on my face.
"John," Holmes tried again, softer, more carefully.
"Watson," he whispered back.  A strong arm wrapped around me.
Holmes nodded once more, more surely.
"You are the mad one, Sherlock Holmes, and I love you for it."
It was two days after Christmas and the new year and new century was nearly upon them.  Christmas had been a quiet affair.  Gifts had been given to Mrs. Hudson and the maid, Molly.  Holmes had dolled out sixpence to his Irregulars and Boxing Day envelopes to the various tradesmen who regularly made deliveries of goods and intelligence to Baker Street.  Mycroft had even called round to deliver a gift to his brother.
We had arranged for the release of young Neligan after Holmes utterly dazzled young Hopkins with his deductions.  I couldn't help but admire the way Holmes enjoyed revealing the solution to the case to the young inspector.  After he had left Hopkins with a promise to help on future cases if needed, we headed back to Baker Street, arm and arm despite the heat.
Good lord he would be the death of me.
He laughed, bright and loud.
"Then we'll see it out together," I promised.
"There is one final test," he said, carefully.
I awoke with a start - disoriented from the rather strange dream.
We left the Tregennis household and headed back to our cottage. Holmes seemed distracted and I was happy to stop when he suggested it.  We settled into the chairs by the front windows to update each other on what we had discovered during our separate interviews.  Despite his lingering cough, I enjoyed his focused manner and the familiar pace of the discussion on the case as we tossed observations back and forth.  It was a comforting pattern as we both added what we had observed, sharing our insights in the hope that the combined knowledge would lead to a, well,
Holmes sniffed.
To his surprise, Watson found a confidant and true friend in Mrs. Hudson as well. He'd attempted to explain Holmes to one of Watson's many friends at his officer's club, but had either been met by outright incredulity or skeptical disgust. He had become so sensitive to the feeling that he had to both explain and defend his friend that eventually he gave in and simply offered the same sanitized and highly edited version of his life that he provided to his agent, Doyle, when pressed to talk about his infamous companion. But he never needed to defend his exasperation to Mrs. Hudson, and they shared many chuckles over the actions of their house's third occupant.
The decision to spend the spring in London had been made after a very tiresome winter trapped indoors with Holmes and his habits.  The first month apart, I believe we both enjoyed our distance.  The second, he answered my letters with telegrams and hastily scribbled notes that were letters in name only.  The third month began with a sure sign that the silly man missed me.
Nothing quite matched the feeling of accompanying Holmes on cases, and Watson's favorites were those that involved investigations that sent them scrambling through London's dark mews and lanes or across windswept moors or coastal cliffs. After Afghanistan, Watson never thought he'd crave adventure again, having had quite enough of it thanks to His Majesty's Royal Fusiliers. But Holmes had awakened something again in Watson that grinned with an eager mania as he chased after clues at Holmes's side. They thrived in the strange life he had built for themselves at 221B Baker Street.
I stared at him.  He appeared ready to end the conversation.
Holmes leaned forward and pressed his lips to Watson's. The kiss was tentative, dry, and far too brief, but sweet all the same. Watson returned the kiss with one of his own. Holmes kissed him again, and they spent an embarrassingly long time there in the kitchen beside a roast growing cold, trading gentle kisses.
After the first time he had taken Sunday tea with Mrs. Hudson while Holmes himself was home, he haltingly suggested he take a plate up to Holmes as an apology for, well, he wasn't sure, she scoffed at him.
"Oscar."
He stopped and turned towards me.  "If you begin, I could not bear the end, you see."
"Sleep, Watson," he murmured. "I expect it will be another hour yet. I’ll wake you."
Holmes made a noise of frustration in the back of his throat and returned his gaze to the fire.  They were both quiet for several long minutes.
Their friendship survived, for a time, but when one literally overflows with love, one has to find a place to put it, and so John Watson did.  It broke both of them, but Watson had someone to comfort him. Holmes did not, and so he did what he thought was best and left his friend in peace.
"I thought I knew my Watson," he said, staring at me, seriously.
I spent plenty of time fretting that perhaps I had something to do with it, until an enquiry for Captain Basil appeared and  set my mind at ease.  I couldn't help the absolutely delighted grin that broke across my face when he appeared with that barbed-headed spear in our sitting room.
I awoke to a gentle shake of my shoulder and a warm smile as he nodded at the docks signaling it was time.
We had been awoken in the middle of the night to investigate, and in the chaos of leaving he had forgotten his needle and dose.  I thought little of it, dismissing it, not appreciating how dependent he had become on the drug on a daily basis.  His mood worsened with every mile that passed on our way to Chislehurst.  He was distracted and angry and any attempt to engage him in the case left him sniping at me.  It was Hopkins's frustrated exclamation of disgust after asking Holmes for the third time if he had any questions about the alleged robbery that finally did me in.  Holmes had remained silent and distracted the whole time, leaving Hopkins and I to both prompt her ladyship for information and to provide comfort in her distress.  It wasn't like Hopkins to grow frustrated with Holmes, and with startling clarity I realized that something was very wrong, and had been for quite awhile.
you were and what you were offering me.  I truly am very sorry I was so careless in my refusal to accept it. "
Watson dropped his bag and rested his shoulder against the doorway, floored by the gesture. He hadn't thought Holmes had noticed, or had noticed that he had noticed, or had even cared one whit about food except when Watson pressed it upon him.
"No.  Wilde."
"Holmes," I gasped.
"Excellent," he said.
The kitchen in Holmes's cottage was always well stocked when he came for a visit. A woman came from the village three days a week to cook and clean for Holmes, but when he was on his own, all he ever seemed capable of preparing was toast and tea. It didn't take long before Watson found himself one evening gathering the ingredients together to make them both a simple dish of baked fish and garden vegetables. Although not much of a baker, he managed a simple shortbread biscuit and they ate far too many of them after dinner, drizzled with honey from Holmes's hives.
"Don’t move, Watson!" I heard Holmes shout from the hallway.
"A costume, Watson, to conceal my identity."
I packed a bag, and departed for my club.
It didn't mean the same thing, surely it couldn't mean the same thing. He looked up at Holmes, terrified his heart would break right there, over a Sunday roast. Holmes smiled at him, one of his rare shy grins, and he shrugged, cheeks turning pink.
I attempted to pull away again.  "Because I finished mine."
Watson searched Holmes's face. "You don't have to," he whispered.
"Sorry," I mumbled, but not a few seconds later the locked clicked and the door opened silently.
"Books."
It took him an embarrassingly long time to realize that she too would grieve the loss of Holmes, and when he emerged from his stupor and caught up with the world that had continued to exist around him, he tried his best to make it up to her. She smiled at him and told him she was well situated, thanks to the elder Holmes brother, and would not need to take on a new lodger for a good while yet. He learned to cook, and the two maids of all work that Mrs. Hudson employed to help keep the house most certainly found it amusing to see the sandy haired doctor with an apron, sleeves rolled up, wielding a knife expertly on vegetables, pastries, and meats.
Holmes stepped out of the shadows dressed head to toe in all black, a white ‘H’ stitched onto the mask-and-cowell’s headpiece.  He hefted a shield.
The man was insane if he thought--  "If I say no, you'll do it alone, won't you?" I asked.
Holmes wrung his hands in front of him. "You cook for me," he said, haltingly. Then he gestured to the table. "I thought I would do the same for you."
I found myself instead rather enjoying the break from London scandals and quite fond of the doings of a Mrs. Crabetree and her apparently near-nightly dinners at the Cross residence.  Small-town gossip amused me to no end and I was quite well on my way to crafting the most ridiculous story in my head as exactly what those visits entailed.
For my sake, I would need to speak to Holmes about the future of our physical relationship. I could only continue on with him in that regard if we could find a place of intimate companionship again and grow it into love.  Giving in to his seductions on other terms would only break my heart, quite possibly for the final time.  I could spend the rest of my life with him if we were nothing but friends, but I could not share my body with him unless we both were committed to each other and no other.  I needed the words spoken aloud.
Holmes hummed in response and studied his evening brandy with far more attention than it deserved. I held my breath, afraid of upsetting the careful balance of the moment.
"Really, Doctor?" he responded with a quick brush of his hand and the expression he gets when he's waiting for me to catch up.
Holmes nodded. "To be pedantic, I arranged," he answered. "But to be poetic, yes."
"Yes, please," Holmes gasped out.
I shook my head at his verbal taunt.  "I am sure you deduced it long ago."
The next morning, we enjoyed the brisk sea air together on a bluff overlooking the bay.  The atmosphere here was doing him wonders and his complexion was brightening by what seemed to be the hour.  Last night had brought a sort of easiness to our interactions, although, as if we had declared a truce and decided to move forward.  I was still unsure as to what the future held for us in that regard, and unsure if it was wise to pursue it while he was still recovering, but I had a hard time telling him no.
Watson breathed out a laugh. "But-"
"Wilde is responsible for his own actions," Holmes said after many minutes of silence.  I looked up, brow furrowed.  It wasn't like him to take so long a pause and continue a conversation.  He was given to quick exclamations and even quicker rejoinders.
I froze.
"I'll thank you to mind your own business, Watson," he said, icly.
"Next time, duck," I said with a smile.
He took his leave.
"Unless of course, like a sensible man, you'll have nothing to do with this?"
"I would kiss you if I could," I said.
"Cornwall."
They lay together now, in the dark quiet of the snowy Christmas season night, shifting and tangling together, sharing, taking, and giving of their bodies and more with each other.  Watson was content to simply share in what Holmes was offering.  It struck him then, that he was no hedonist and that Holmes was no ascetic.  Rather, they were two very different people who had spent far too long not being able to understand each other despite desiring the very same thing: to love and be loved in return.
"All the days of my life," he replied.
"No," I responded with wryly.
It was only a little at first, but quickly grew out of control.  I knew we had reached the point where something must be done when Holmes nearly bungled a case so badly that we would have left the victim to possibly hang for the crime.
"I have engaged him for a consultation."
I smiled at him and was heartened to the see the corner of his lip twitch.
I stumbled into the too-bright sun and collapsed on the ground with Holmes cradled against me.  I gulped air, desperate for the drugs to break their hold, praying I hadn't gone mad.  I was back in a hotel room in London, the day before I had met Holmes, staring at my service revolver, only this time I pulled the trigger and when I did, it was somehow Holmes who was dead.  I looked down at Holmes, his face contorted in horror and pain and wondered if I had made it in time, or if he had already descended into complete madness.
"Watson," Holmes began.  He paused and stared into the fire.
It became their habit to take a full Sunday dinner, lovingly prepared by Watson with as much food directly from their garden as possible every week. Holmes would eat sparingly even during their happiest times, but on Sundays, they sat down together at the kitchen table, read the newspaper or their correspondence and took in a full meal. Watson limited his roasts to those provided by the pub in town.
The return of others to his bed, in this case the frustratingly likeable and competent Stanley Hopkins, broke my heart, but I bore it.
Then at the very height of summer, Sherlock Holmes disappeared.
It was all quite by accident. Initially, at least. We had been invited up to a hunting and shooting party in the countryside by an old friend of Watson’s. Normally I declined to accompany Watson on these little outings, preferring to stay in London of course. But this time I had accepted. The new aspect of our relationship meant I was disinclined to spend a week apart from him, especially when he would be spending it in the company of hale and healthy sporting men.
"You see everything, Holmes," I whispered, "How can you not see me?  The world knows that I would do anything for my friend Holmes, but you know there is absolutely nothing,
I pressed my face to his, "you know that it's my greatest joy and privilege to help you."  I stroked my thumbs along his cheeks.
I dropped my face into my hands. Just a nightmare.
I found myself at loose ends in the spring of 1895 and knew that my boredom was driving my friend and fellow lodger absolutely batty.  Holmes had already sent me away once, but the wet and dreary countryside was no better than wet and dreary London, so I returned before I upset a friend less likely to forgive me than Holmes was.  Something had caught Holmes' attention, and I watched him fall into one of his typical obsessive moods as every waking hour was consumed by whatever little problem he was researching.
"No you hold still!" I lept up as soon as the third arrow hit, distressingly close to where my feet were curled against the armrest.
I returned that night to see the needle gone and Holmes retired to his room.
Dr. Agar considered us both.
"And I love you."
"I almost cannot believe that you would still be willing, after all we have been through, to try yet again to love me, but thank goodness for that goddamned heart of yours."
"Yes, I heard," I said dryly.  "I couldn’t help but hear.  I quite frankly had no choice in the matter."
"Marriage made me realize what I want," I replied calmly.
"Did you finish your manuscript?" I asked, tearing my mouth away from his.  He chased it back down, fingers twisting in my shirtfront.
He smile was so bright it nearly blinded me.
"It was just a spot of harmless archery," he gasped as he struggled up the stairs towards my bedroom.  The bastard was laughing.
Watson waited until she'd served herself before carefully taking a slightly smaller portion for himself. He caught her appraising look and offered her a small smile. She didn't return it, but her silence didn't feel stilted or awkward. Watson couldn't help but fill the quiet with comments and observations here and there, probably far more than Mrs. Hudson would have preferred, but by the end of the meal she would offer him a small smile or a non-committal noise of inquiry or agreement whenever he said something. Still, he worried at his intrusion into her space and could not help but feel guilty, despite no evidence that she was at all bothered by it, that he had done so.
"Really Watson, my sleep last night was sound and restful, what I got of it at least.  I am hardly taxed."
He waved me off and pulled at his sleeves.
To be honest, he was a bit startled at the invitation. Over the past dozen days or so, he'd convinced himself that he had been terribly rude to intrude on his landlady' private sanctum like that and had nearly plucked up the courage to apologize. In fact, he'd been nearly ready to rouse himself to go down to take supper in his club as the lack of food at a quarter past Mrs. Hudson's normal hour to serve tea had made him realize that Holmes had very likely told her not to bother.
"Boxing champion, Melville College, 5th AND 6th form!"
"Or you and I are done.  We are done with both our professional and our personal considerations."
Holmes finally looked at him with his unreadable grey eyes.
"I do not require a consultation."
When Sherlock Holmes made up his mind, he was not likely to change it.  It was a surprising characterization for a man who was apt to blame others often for theorizing ahead of the facts.  On a case, he was careful and methodical.  For anything else, once he had was decided there was no turning back.
I had, of course, learned to ride as youngster and so I donned the breeches, boots, and coat that had been long buried in a trunk and joined Watson with hunt cap in hand.
"Watson?" came his entirely-too-awake enquiry.
"To somewhere sufficiently dull, I assume?"  His tone was tired, but wry.
"At the slightest sign!"
I took his hand and placed it in the crook of my elbow, laying my fingers over his and drawing him close to me.  He smiled sadly.
I jerked awake at the first thump that landed startling close to my ear.
"Then shall I take you to bed?"  Watson asked, rising, still holding Holmes's hands in his own.
We were not as young as we once were, but we certainly kept ourselves well occupied for quite awhile before falling into an exhausted and contented sleep.  The wind rattled the windows, but the fire and the heat of our bodies kept the cold at bay.
I took his arm and led him home and straight up our seventeen steps into the sitting room where I locked the door and pressed him against it, hands firmly wrapped around his upper arms.
"Good lord, John, it is supposed to be a rest cure, not a prison sentence."
"Nevermind that," he said waving his hands at me.  "Did you hear?  I’ve solved it!"
"Neither do I."
I had only know him a short while, but found myself incapable of refusing. I laid my head back and let my eyes drift closed.
His answering grin told me everything.
That sunny summer Sunday afternoon was the second supper in what became a tradition for the two of them. At first, their conversation was practically non-existent before it grew polite but stilted. But Watson's naturally easygoing personality and Mrs. Hudson's no-nonsense but practical sensibility found a balance and by the following summer, Watson considered Mrs. Hudson amongst his friends. He suspected that in addition to be a fairly quiet and reserved woman, Mrs. Hudson kept to herself for propriety's sake as well. There was no Mr. Hudson at 221 and Watson had no inclination to ask - although he was quite sure Holmes had long since deduced the information and Mrs. Hudson had a ready answer whether it was true or not. An independent woman of means was a target for the less scrupulous, and even those who meant well but had no respect for someone valuing their independence and freedom. Watson certainly had grown to understand the challenges such women faced in the world even from those that they called friends - plenty had darkened the doorway of 221B and shared their tales of struggle and strife with Holmes while asking for his help.
He began to slowly awaken from his coma. Confused, struggling to form words, and completely unaware of who or where he was. I would not give up. I would never give up for him. The pieces of his mind returned slowly.
Then, I heard the rushing of the water over a tremendous waterfall.
Apparently I was not being subtle and after being a bit overzealous over the consumption of a few bites of Mrs. Hudson's fine roast I was banished.   "Distracting, annoying, and about to get himself killed if he interrupts me one more time," was what was shouted at me as he all but shoved me out the door.
"Wilde?"  I was taken aback by the familiarity and casualness of the way Holmes said is name.  He had given no previous indication that he had any acquaintance with the man, and certainly not one that would warrant such an intimacy of being referred to as Oscar to your friends.
Sherlock stared at the picture. There were the three of them. Sherlock on the left side dressed in what looked like one of his suits, there was Rosie in the middle in her bee costume and on the right there stood John in a jumper. They were all holding hands and they seemed to be walking in a park. They were all wearing big smiles. At the top of the paper, ‘My Family’ was written in capitals and a big heart right next to it.
It was the nurse who startled him from his surprise. ‘I’m sorry, John, but-‘
John suddenly didn’t know what to do. He knew he should call the doctor but was afraid it would upset Sherlock even more. In the end, he decided he would call him as he seemed to be upsetting Sherlock nonetheless and the doctor should know that he’s awake.
After breakfast that tasted like ash, John was ready to go to see Sherlock again.
In the hospital, they sat him in the waiting room. Sherlock was taken to a surgery. And then, it really hit John. He was useless now. And he was scared to death. He began to cry. He desperately tried not to see the worst scenarios. And failed, of course. He thought about brain injury. About Sherlock’s brain, which was most probably without the supply of oxygen for…how long? How long did it take for the swelling to develop, blocking the passage? How long did Sherlock lie there before he found him? How long was he late?
‘Hello, Rosamund.’ They both said and exchanged kisses on cheeks with each other.
‘Good afternoon, John.’ He said with great difficulty.
‘Yes, daddy. I will. I… tell Papa I love him.’
‘Is he going to die?’ Rosie asked straightforwardly, eyes wide and full of tears.
‘Sherlock!’ He screamed as he fell to his knees at Sherlock’s side. Although it was fruitless as Sherlock remained still. Oh God, please let him live. John quickly assessed his condition. He felt pulse, although weak. ‘Oh, thank god.’ It was at least something. However, it didn’t look good as Sherlock didn’t respond at all. He had some small cuts on his hands and two fingers on his right hand were swelled. But that was all right. However, his hair was full of blood which seemed to be pouring from the back of his head. Blow to the head, then and probably not a single one saying by the state of his forehead.
When Caroline came to check on Sherlock, he remembered the ring and asked, if she didn’t know how it appeared in the room on the table and not on Sherlock’s finger.
They sat next to each other and were holding hands in a silence until John broke it. ‘Thank you for telling me. I understand how it might have felt. But I also see how much you have changed over the years. You enjoy every bit of family life… yeah, I observe sometimes, too. Even the lazy Sundays you love.’ He smiled at Sherlock teasingly and nudged him. When their eyes met, he continued. ‘And you are a wonderful father to Rosie.’
“I’m so sorry Sherlock. I’m sorry for everything that I’ve caused you. It will never happen again. I will never hurt you again. Promise.” A moment of silence followed.
‘What is it, sweetheart?’
Of course, thought John.
‘John! Wake up!’ Sherlock whispered as loudly as whispering could be and shook John’s arm vigorously.
Sherlock’s body was healing well and after three more days of exercising with John he could move around on his own without any bigger problem and the doctor felt confident in saying he could be released soon.
He called the nurse, who called the doctor and John told him what had happened. Doctor, of course said his ambiguous diagnose but sounded pleased, hopeful. At least to John’s ears.
“Then what’s wrong?” John stood up from his chair and went slowly over to them.
‘Can I go and see him?’ Rosie asked.
“Well… would you mind?”
But today, he didn’t let the grim thoughts to invade his brain. He talked to Sherlock about nonsense, then received a call from Greg and then Violet Holmes, who wasn’t feeling well so she couldn’t visit. Just as he wanted to make himself a cuppa, Sherlock started trashing just like the day before. John did a few quick steps and tried to hold him down softly.
Both John and Rosie stayed frozen for a few seconds.
Sherlock exhaled loudly. “I’m scared that… I’ll drop her or just… break her something.“ John relaxed and smiled. He was in fact moved by this. How Sherlock cared.
“Move back here.” His gaze was so intense John felt the urge to cry but his eyes filled with glitter of hope and happiness rather than tears.
Rosie looked up at him as he lowered himself beside Sherlock. Then he picked up his left hand. The ring finger wasn’t attached to any wire or anything and it seemed alright for Sherlock to have it returned. So, he looked into Sherlock’s face and then slid the ring on his finger.
He felt something. A slight shift of Sherlock’s trapped hand. But he couldn’t even identify what it was. In what direction it moved. Maybe it was just a spasm of muscled. All the same, it left John breathless for a moment since it felt like Sherlock patted his cheek…with a bit of imagination.
‘Yeah, sure. Can we go to Angelo’s for lunch?’ Rosie asked. She didn’t seem nervous at all.
Meanwhile Sherlock calmed down a bit and just watched the doctor’s every movement. All of a sudden, he looked tired and really, his eyes began closing again. Before John could start to panic that he would fall into coma again, the doctor broke his train of thoughts.
