“Cas, wait,” Dean hears the shake in his own voice, and he can only hope that Cas doesn’t notice. “Eat with me. I’ll throw a shirt on.”
Cas stays home, he tends to his garden in the backyard, and he’s recently talked to Dean about maybe keeping bees. Dean’s fine with that, loves the idea actually. Fresh honey would be awesome, and he knows it would make Cas happy.
“Please what, angel?” Dean asks, untucking his head from Cas’ neck to pull him in for a kiss. As he does, he gets a hand around Cas and starts stroking him at an agonizingly slow pace.
“Don’t tell me what to do, Winchester. When you sounded so weird the last time we talked, I did some digging. I know, Dean. About the supernatural, angels, demons, all of it. I’ve been training, so knock it the fuck off. Get your panties out of a twist and suck it up. We’re coming to help. Deal with it,” Charlie says. What the fuck?
“Anna,” Dean says, and he approaches her. He puts his hands firmly on her shoulders and looks into her eyes. “If something goes sideways,” he starts, “you just tuck tail and run. I can't lose you, too, okay?”
“It’s a little smushed,” Cas says, an apology. “But we’re going to smash it for the spell, anyway. It’ll work.”
They’re the only ones in the elevator, so Dean takes Cas’ hand. He lets it go every time the doors open, and only holds it when the elevator’s empty. He hopes Cas understands.
“Do you mean it?” Cas asks, turning his head to meet Dean’s eyes. He can see Dean’s pulse in his neck, his heart is beating so hard and so fast, and all they’re doing is holding hands. He watches Dean part his lips to try and say something, but he closes his mouth and nods slowly instead.
“You’ve thought about this.” It’s not a question. Cas’ heart swells. Dean’s been thinking about a future where they don’t hunt, where the biggest danger that faces Dean are power tools. He loves the thought. He really, truly does. He’s always wanted for Dean to have something other than the life his father forced him into when he was far too young.
he’s starting to freak the fuck out. He rushes over to the window and pulls it closed. “Cas!” he shouts. “Get in here!”
“What? Dean, I—“ Cas pauses, and he shifts in the bed. His voice becomes clearer, so Dean can only assume he’s turned on his side to face him. “Yes, she told me,” he says quietly. “But I don’t hate you for it, Dean. Please don’t think that,” he adds. Dean feels it when Cas’ hand lands on the air mattress, searching for a body he won’t find because Dean’s scooted all the way over to the other side of it.
Dean always catches him with that look on his face, ever since he got back. Cas looks at him and treats him like he’s about to break, even though Cas is the one that got tortured within an inch of his life and had his grace ripped out just a few days ago. Dean imagines that Cas is still probably in some sort of shock or denial or
Both of their shirts are off, so as Cas hugs him, their bare chests are pressed together. It’s the first time since Cas got hurt that they’ve been chest-to-chest like this with nothing separating them. Dean sighs and sags against Cas, unable to keep his body from relaxing into the touch. As Dean nuzzles his face into Cas’ neck, Cas reaches between them to start unbuckling Dean’s belt. He leaves it open but doesn’t bother pulling it off as he unbuttons and unzips them, and then he shoves them down Dean’s legs until they pool around his ankles. “Come on, Dean. Let’s go to bed,” he offers, pulling back to take Dean’s wrist and lead him to bed.
“Goodnight,” Cas says, and Dean’s never heard Cas sound sad before, but he does. His heart sinks even lower.
Of course, just like every time Dean has touched him for the last week and a half, Cas jerks away from him.
Cas imagines that Dean is probably feeling a hell of a lot higher than he is right now, not having the tolerance that Cas has built up over the last few years of his annoyingly mortal life. That’s fine, he wants Dean to have a good time. He wants to spend this time with the Dean that he knows, the one he recognizes, the one that doesn’t want him to follow him straight to the end of their lives as they know it -- and probably their lives, period.
He runs his hands through Dean's hair, scratching lightly at his scalp. He loves the way Dean's hair has grown, loves to run his fingers through it and bury his nose in it. He likes twirling it around his fingers and tugging on it while they kiss. And Dean likes it too, as far as Cas can tell. He always pulls these contented little hums from the back of Dean's throat when he plays with it. Dean's doing it now, actually, as Cas washes his hair.
When all is said and done, Dean slowly lifts himself up to peel Cas out of his boxers. He uses the already soiled underwear to finish wiping Cas clean, pressing kisses to the center of his chest as he does. “Was that okay for you?” Dean asks quietly.
"My dad, he- um. Oh, God. He would just hate me, y'know? He'd be so disappointed in me." Dean's voice breaks as he speaks but he's finally managed to stop the tears.
Dean nods and settles his hands on Cas’ waist. “Me too, buddy,” he says quietly. His stomach growls. And come to think of it, his throat is actually super dry as well. He could probably use about a gallon of water and something that can pass as a meal.
Cas pulls back to plant a kiss on his cheek, and then to his lips. “Of course,” he says. “We just pulled the first batch out of the oven. They — well, they’re less like cinnamon rolls and more like cinnamon lumps, but — Missouri and I tasted them, and — they’re very good, Dean.”
but okay. He can roll with this. His hands settle at Cas’ hips, rubbing small circles with his thumbs. He nods once to give Cas the green light, and Cas does it.
Dean pulls back and sighs. “It— it’s fine, Cas. It’s okay. I understand better than a lot of people think what it’s like to have a fucked up past. It’s unfair that I held it against you for not wanting to talk about shit like that.”
Dean. Don’t take that tone with me. I don’t care that you’re grown, I’m still your mother,” Mary snaps. “I understand that it’s a lot. I do. But it’s important for you to know.”
Cas follows her out to the front porch. He can just barely hear them, but he can’t make out anything they’re saying. He rests his elbows on the table, peering at Sam through his fingers where his hands cover his face. “The
Dean grins back at him, he can’t help it. He moves the arm that had been around Cas’ shoulders all night to straighten out his hair a little, running his fingers through it so there are less pieces sticking straight up. He finishes by tucking a piece of hair behind Cas’ ear, “You want a haircut soon? You’re gettin’ shaggy again.” He sees Cas’ smile falter, so he adds, “Not that it’s bad. It’s not. It’s- You look nice.” Dean knows his cheeks are pink. He can feel them get hotter and hotter.
Aaron shrugs and takes another drink. “Not a big deal, I guess. It’s pretty nice up here, y’know? Especially under the new management,” he jokes, and Dean smiles at his feet in the water. He’s thinking about Cas.
“That didn’t go as bad as it could’ve,” Cas notes. He’s holding their shared duffel in his hand, and both beds are made.
Dean has never been so fucking happy to hear those words in his life. He must look ridiculous, he thinks, standing in his bedroom doorway wearing his father's old leather jacket, an torn up t-shirt, a pair of sweatpants Cas had been partial to while he was human, and a pair of socks with fucking
Cas reaches up and cups the back of Dean's neck, kissing him deeply. Dean can basically feel the love pouring out of him through his lips. He makes a soft noise of surprise but returns the same enthusiasm that Cas is giving him. Dean's hands pull Cas close to him by his waist. He wraps one arm all the way around his back, and he wants to
He keeps climbing the steps as Cas starts to descend, and they meet somewhere in the middle with their arms around each other. “Sorry for being an ass,” Dean says into Cas’ chest. The angle’s a little weird with Cas being one step above him, but it’s still nice.
Then, Cas hears the creaky iron door of the bunker swing open. He wonders who it is somewhere in the back of his mind as he watches Sam and Dean prepare the final touches.
Dean showers and they don't talk, they don't need to. He hums to himself after a few minutes, forgetting that he isn't alone for a second. Even when he remembers Cas' presence, he continues. Once his wounds have been rinsed and he's washed his hair, he turns the water off. He pokes his head out from the curtain and gives Cas a shit-eating grin. "I'm naked behind here, ya know?"
Sam’s bouncing his leg on the other end of the couch and biting at his fingernails like he’s waiting for Dean to stand up and start yelling at him, calling him all sorts of names and disowning him as a brother or something. Instead, Dean takes a moment to swap places with Cas so he can throw and arm around his little brother’s shoulders.
The Djinn easily would have beat Dean here if this is where it was bringing Cas. Dean crouches to the ground, rubbing his hand over his mouth over and over. He wants to scream. He's so mad at himself, he can't even think straight. The Djinn isn't here, Sam took the car, and Cas could be anywhere. Dean just prays to deaf ears that Sam finds him.
drunk?” Dean asks, poking him right in the center of the chest. “It’s like—“ he hiccups, “—you don’t even get drunk. Do you even get drunk?” he asks. Stupid question. Of course Cas gets drunk.
"I'm fine," Cas huffs, and he struggles to push himself up into a sitting position. Dean lets one of his hands leave Cas’ face in order to place it on his back, right between his shoulder blades. He nudges Cas forward and upward into a sitting position. He drops his hand from Cas’ face finally, but rubs slow circles into his back.
Cas goes rigid next to Dean, and when Dean looks over at him, he’s even more pale than he had been after all of the blood loss a few days prior. “That means…”
Dean reaches up to lay his own hand over Cas’ where it remains on his shoulder, “Cas?” he asks softly, like he’s not sure if he’s got that quite right. Like maybe he didn’t guess correctly.
Because he is selfish, Castiel lets him. He wants to feel Dean’s rough hands sliding across the achy planes of his back, cleaning him and washing the day away.
They decided they wanted kids shortly after their wedding, but they didn’t know how they’d go about it.
thank you times 100 to my discord server who i’ve pestered about this fic since the day i started writing it. a lot of them have read over it for me. specifically a huge huge thanks to abby, liv, bash, scott, and imp in no particular order. y’all are lifesavers and i mean that.
He glances up when he feels a hand on his bicep. He meets Cas’ eyes, and they’re filled with the same sort of sadness he knows his own must be full of. “I’m glad to be back, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean knows he means it.
That doesn’t mean Cas wants to interact with him at the moment, though. He thinks he’d rather sulk in his room for a while until he gets over it. He knows he will. Even when he’s annoyed, his love for Dean is unwavering. There’s nothing on God’s green Earth that Dean could do to make Cas stop loving him.
But Cas didn’t care. He still doesn’t. He’ll take sole responsibility and accept whatever consequences the cosmos decides to reign down on him. To keep Dean safe, he’d do it over and over again. No hesitation.
He barely knows the guy and he’s doing everything he can just to see him smile. It’s fucking pathetic, is what it is. If you don’t count all the staring, he’s only been acquainted with him for all of half an hour. Even in such a short amount of time, Dean can tell that even when he isn’t actively trying to make Cas smile, his face is always relatively impassive. It feels good to elicit emotions from the guy, but Dean refuses to look to closely at that, because he’s
Cas chokes back a laugh, sipping at his coffee. “I’m twenty-two, Dean,” he says, “and I think a party could be fun. If you’re sure I won’t be intruding,” he adds, turning to Charlie.
Dean does what he said he would, and shortly he’s sliding in next to Cas at the table with two plates. Wordlessly, he put Cas’ plate down in front of him. Just bacon and eggs and a slice of toast, but it smells wonderful. They eat their food in relative silence, their knees knocking together.
Eventually, their laughter dwindles to soft chuckles and then into nothing, and Dean only hears gentle breathing on the other side of the line. “I really am sorry for the way we left things,” Sam says. I wasn’t — I was never upset with you. Just dad. And I figured you probably hated me for leaving you with him, and I just—”
Dean can obviously tell, because he pops off for a moment to speak. “Don’t hold back. I don’t care who hears us. Let them,” and then he goes right back to work with a newfound determination to apparently suck Cas’ entire life force out through his dick.
Cas fits the pillow underneath him, humming contentedly. He drags his finger over Dean’s dick, all the way down, down, down, until. Well, until his finger is pressed right against the one place on Dean’s body that he’s never allowed anyone but himself to touch. He sucks in a sharp breath, he knows he clenches, but he’s not opposed to this. It’s just… new. That’s all.
Cas repositions so that he’s laying on his side, and he watches as Dean settles down next to him, but on his back. He turns his head to the side and Cas just looks at him for a moment. He wants so deeply. Wants to reach out and touch Dean, wants to have him, wants to keep him. He longs for it, but now isn’t the time. “Dean’s not stupid,” Cas starts, flickering his gaze down so he’s looking right at Dean’s chest. “He’s one of the smartest and bravest leaders I’ve ever encountered, he’s just reckless.” Cas’ heart hurts, and this is what sucks the most about being mortal. Before, when he started to feel, it hadn’t been a physical thing, not really. He felt emotions, recognized them even, but they were never a tangible, physical thing the way they are now. “He’ll do whatever it takes to take out Lucifer. Any and all losses are worth it, to him.”
Not even your father would believe half of it,” Missouri says. She sighs and levels him with a look, and Dean shrinks back into the couch. “Now,” she says, “I wanna help you boys. I do. But I don’t know
He’s witnessed Dean tear off the head of a vampire with his bare hands when his machete couldn’t quite get the job done. He’s watched Dean sharpen that exact machete with a look of such peace displayed over his features. He finds comfort in the monotony. He’s seen Dean as a demon, and he’s seen Dean possessed by an angel. Over the last decade and some change, Castiel has seen a thousand iterations of Dean Winchester. He loves each one more than the last.
Dean washes his back with a gentle pressure, trying to dig out some of the tension knotted there. Because Castiel is weak, he lets a smile cross his features as he relaxes into Dean’s gentle caresses. His eyes fall closed and he lets himself enjoy this, because surely Dean will decide he’s had enough at any moment. He’ll decide that this is too weird for him, that friends don’t do this for each other. He’ll fumble around an excuse about making dinner and leave Castiel here to finish bathing himself.
“Drove,” Brooke says simply, shrugging her shoulders. “Protected my car, hid it. I’m not an idiot. I wasn’t followed.”
While they wait on toast and eggs, Dean wraps one arm around Cas' waist and pulls him close. He presses a kiss to Cas' temple and mumbles against it, "Gotta do laundry today. My bed's bigger, I'm not waking up basically glued to you by our sweat again tomorrow morning." He's only teasing, of course.
They load up Dean’s bag and everything else he wants to take home, and they set off toward Cas’ place. It occurs to Dean once they’re already nearly there that Cas doesn’t exactly have a couch for him to sleep on. There’s just the loveseat. He supposes he could probably hook his legs over the side of one of the armrests and make it work, but it wouldn’t be comfortable, and he wants to be rested if he’s gotta drive home tomorrow. They can share a bed, right? No big deal. Totally fine.
“It doesn’t sound boring at all. What about the rest of you?” Cas asks, and Dean’s heart swells. He knows Cas is probably just trying to make some friends since he’s the new guy here, but the fact that Cas is trying to befriend his friends is way more endearing than it should be.
He never sees the Leviathan. Not unless he uses his grace, so he doesn’t. He tries, when he can, not to think about it at all. He feels… almost human. Not quite, but maybe somewhere close. He doesn’t need to eat, and he doesn’t need to sleep, but he also exists without using his grace for the first time in his millenia of life.
“Fine. Don’t you dare fucking laugh,” Dean points a finger, “Or this will be all over your lap in a heartbeat.”
Cas just keeps on smiling and squeezes Dean’s hand, reminding him that they’re still clasped. The air is buzzing around them. The hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stands up as he realizes he wants to kiss Cas.
That night, when the clock strikes midnight, Dean has Cas spread out below him and moaning his name. Dean glances to the clock and leans down to press a deep kiss to Cas’ lips. “Happy twentieth, Sweetheart,” he breathes, and sinks into Cas.
Dean thinks he and Cas are doing just fine with Jack. The kid seems happy, well-adjusted, and well-rounded. It’s summer now, but Jack will start kindergarten when August rolls around. Dean’s excited for him to make some friends, and also excited to have a little bit of free time with Cas.
worrying about money, but Cas said he’d take care of it. Dean, for once in his life, believes that. He believes Cas when Cas tells him he’s got something under control. He
Dean nods. Good. This is good, right? Anna’s on board, Cas is on board. The only thing left is to get Brooke to agree. “Cool. Good, yeah. Awesome. Cas, do you have her number?” he asks.
“What? Together? No way,” Dean says. “I care about her. A lot, actually, but… not like that. She’s… not exactly my type, I guess,” he finishes.
Working as a carpenter hasn’t made Dean rich or anything, but he makes enough to get by with a comfortable cushion. He keeps himself and Cas fed, keeps the water and electricity on. And Dean has a pretty good grasp on most basic home repairs, so it’s not like they ever have to spend money when pipes get clogged or leaky.
Dean helps him stand up off the lip of the tub so he can strip him. He starts with Cas’ shirt, slowly maneuvering his arms inside of it and then pulling it over his head so that Cas doesn’t have to stretch his abdomen out too much by lifting his arms. That could potentially rip the scabs open, and nobody wants that. He moves next to Cas’ pants, untying the drawstring of the sweats and letting them fall to the floor. He holds on to Cas’ forearms so he can stay steady as he steps out of them, and then Dean does the same with his boxers.
“Clarence,” Meg drawls — what a stupid fucking nickname to give Cas, but whatever — “You’re up first.”
Cas finally twists his hand free from Dean’s grip so that he can hold both sides of his face. It doesn’t take long for Cas to swipe his tongue across Dean’s bottom lip. Dean makes a soft noise as he parts his lips and lets Cas lick into his mouth. Cas moves one hand from Dean’s face to cup the back of his neck and pull him deeper into the kiss. Dean is so pliant under his touch, and it makes Cas’ stomach turn inside out. He could do this forever.
Cas places a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Go sit down. Wait for me to get you,” he says. Dean frowns—what does Cas think he’s going to be able to accomplish that Dean couldn’t?
Cas smiles at him and readjusts his beanie for him. Dean smiles right back. “There’s—“ Cas cuts himself off, and Dean swears he can see him blush. “There’s pie. In my apartment. I made it, don't know how good it is. But if you want some, you can have some,” he says. “I was going to bring it to game night, but I forgot.”
Cas effortlessly rolls them so that Dean is on top of him, and Dean lets out an embarrassing squeak in surprise. “Gonna use some of that angel strength to throw me around a little, Cas?” he breathes, and goes right back to kissing him.
There’s nobody out here except for a couple of frat dudes, and one of them is smoking a cigarette. “Hey, could I bum one?” he asks. “And a light, if you got one.”
“You really love this car, don’t you?” Cas says after a few seconds, but there’s no judgement in his voice. He’s not making fun of Dean, he’s just… asking.
"Cas, I-" He takes one more deep breath. He can do this. "It's my dad, Cas. I can't, because my dad-" he chokes on his words, trying to breathe and steady himself. He uses the feeling of Cas' hand against his face ground him.
Sam stands up from the table as Cas is lost in thought, and Cas glances up to see Dean shoot Sam a glare as he places his plate in the sink while Dean does dishes. After Sam walks out of the kitchen and presumably to the library, Cas stands up and walks to the sink to help Dean with the dishes.
Dean does, he closes his eyes. He feels when Cas comes inside of him, and he can see a bright flash of light behind his eyelids. Vaguely, he registers the sound of something shattering. He feels like Cas is bleeding into his very being. He feels like he might be on fire. His hip sears where Cas has a grip on it, but it feels
Before Dean can think, he's clamped his hand down on Cas' thigh, gripping with more force than was entirely necessary. His face goes hot and he's sure Cas catches it, because Dean can see him smirk out of his peripheral vision. "No, Cas. No, don't." It comes out of his mouth sounding more desperate than he intends, and then Cas lays a gentle hand on top of Dean's. Dean releases his death grip on Cas' thigh, but leaves his hand in place. He stares down at Cas' hand on top of his own and gulps.
"You're thinking too loud. Shut up and go to sleep," Cas grumbles, burrowing himself deeper into Dean's embrace.
Cas pulls Dean's chair out from the table, grabs the collar of the shirt he's wearing, and heaves him up. Cas is staring into his eyes, their faces almost as close as they had been during their last movie night. "You want me to touch you, Dean?" he all but growls, his fists balled up as he holds tight.
Cas isn’t very fond of the fact that he has to eat and drink to stay alive. He finds it tedious, he’d told Dean as much on his first full day as a human. And pissing — that was a whole different ordeal in and of itself. Cas didn’t want
"Uh, the truth?" Cas suggests, shrugging his shoulders. "He probably already suspects something. I'll help you tell him, Dean. Don't worry about it." He smiles, and its full of so much warmth that Dean just wants to bask in it forever.
Aaron nods, and he looks a little confused. Dean figures that’s fair. “So,” he says, “Your best friend’s son is your step-kid? You get how that sounds, right?” he says, and Dean knows it’s a joke, but it manages to cut deep anyway.
Cas shakes his head. “Not exactly. I can sense your emotions, though. Yours more than anyone else’s,” he says. “I knew you were struggling that day in Art History. I know when you get annoyed with me. I know when I piss you off. I know when you’re happy, I know when you need to be held,” he says, and he pulls Dean against his chest. “I know
Dean just looks up at him with blown pupils and swollen, spit-slick lips and nods. “So fucking okay, Cas. C’mere.” He pulls Cas down into another kiss, which Cas happily returns. He’s straddling Dean’s thighs and his hands make their way up to tangle in Dean’s hair.
It doesn’t take them long to scarf down their breakfast, and by then it’s nearly time for checkout. If Cas gathers their things, he’ll have time to call John before they have to head out.
Dean’s between his legs, eyes trained on Castiel’s face. He smiles when Cas meets his eyes, the same soft one that makes Castiel feel warm inside in a way his arousal doesn’t. “I do love you,” Dean says again, which only makes Castiel whine louder. He presses a third finger inside without warning, but he goes slow and it doesn’t hurt. It feels anything
Cas smiles at him. He presses gentle kisses to his cheeks, his nose, his lips. “You’re tired,” he says. He’s not asking. Dean supposes maybe he’d been right all along—maybe angels can read minds.
Cas rolls his eyes. “I… want to remember this,” he says carefully. “I want to remember you. In the before.”
“I—“ Cas starts, and then he dips down to kiss Dean again. “Me too,” he says. “I really like you, too. I care about you more than I can put into words you’d understand.”
This is going to break Dean’s heart. He has to stay. This is the life he deserves. Surely, more Leviathan will be on him the moment Dean passes through the portal, assuming they don’t get ambushed again. They make their way there, and Dean keeps a tight grip on Cas wherever he can. His coat, his forearm, his wrist.
“I never would have admitted it before now, though. I don’t know what changed. Seeing you so happy with the other me… It just made me want to do better, it made me want to be better than him. I was… jealous of him. And I couldn’t figure out why. Because it wasn’t like you were
he asks, and his voice cracks. He might have the body of some kid in his early twenties, but he truly sounds like a genuine
Dean snaps his fingers in front of Cas’ face, and only then does Cas realize he’s been staring off into space while the rest of them have been making moves to pack up and head home. “We’ll be right behind you, Sam. Don’t wait up, I think I’ll ride back with Cas,” Dean tells Sam, and Cas’ blood runs cold.
"No, not- not that. He- God, Cas. My dad really fucking hated gay people." Dean sputters. That counts, right? That counts as coming out. Cas will know what he means.
Cas chuckles as he collapses next to Dean, fully sated. “I love you, too,” he jokes, poking Dean in the side.
Dean fishes his phone out of his back pocket and heads to his room, sitting down on the edge of the mattress. Cas sits next to him, rubbing a hand up and down his spine. “You don’t have to do this,” he says softly. “I’d like to know, but we don’t have to. I know it’s scary,” he says.
Dean takes a deep breath and tries to steady himself. He knows. He knows that Cas staying any longer would fuck up the timeline, and that the longer he stays, the more of Dean’s memory they’ll have to wipe, but he doesn’t care. If he’s not going to remember any of this, he needs to at least let himself have it for now. He needs Cas. “I don’t wanna be alone,” Dean says, which is what he says every time they have this fight.
Both cars are packed, Cas is hidden because of the tattoo he’d given himself, Dean is hidden by the inscription on his ribs, and Brooke is hidden by various sigils and hex bags. The only one left is Anna, who’s decided that she’s going to swallow her grace back up before they hit the road, just in case they run into any sort of trouble.
closer, he can crawl inside his skin and stitch him together from the inside out. Dean thinks idly that he wouldn’t even really mind if Cas lived inside his skin. Cas would be part of him, then, wouldn’t leave. No matter how much Dean pushes people away, it’s nothing but a test to see if they will.
Whatever sort of shit Christians are on about when they talk about salvation, that’s what Dean feels with his lips pressed against Cas’. They wind up having sex most nights, but Dean can tell already — that’s not where this is headed.
nervous than the last time. He’s always worried about something or other. He worries a lot that this time will be the time Cas decides he’s bored, decides to move on to people that are more fun to hang out with.
“Angels have to take vessels when they come to earth. This one…” Cas says, rubbing his hands down his own chest, “His name was Jimmy. He… left. A couple of years back. He died. It—I didn’t kill him. But my superiors did. They decided that I needed to be in this vessel alone in order to complete my mission.”
Cas hears shuffling but doesn’t feel movement, so he assumes Sam is awake. He lets his eyes drift closed again, barbed wire constricting and poking at his heart. He pulls the covers up over his shoulders, cocooning himself. He feels like hiding from the world today, and he’s not excited to spend two hours in the backseat of the Impala. He just wants to stay in bed.
know is that when his mother had laid his little brother in his arms that awful night all those years ago, there had been blood on his lips — like it had been there on purpose. Like somebody — some
Dean opens his eyes to see Cas sliding the shower door open and stepping inside. He crowds Dean against the wall, and Dean knows he looks cocky. He looks like the most smug son of a bitch this side of the Mississippi, but Cas has a look in his eye like he’s about to rectify that as soon as possible.
hope u enjoyed! if somehow youre reading this DIRECTLY after ive posted it, im posting the first real chapter as soon as i get it formatted to ao3 and from there updates should be every tuesday for at least the next five weeks, since i have seven chapters written so far. after that i'm starting a new job and have no clue how often i can commit to updating. im not setting a number of chapters, because when i do that i always get derailed. right now its looking like 12, including a prologue and epilogue, but that could change at literally any time. so anyways! i hope you enjoy <3
Brooke scrubs a hand over her face, takes a deep breath. “He got here, and asked for my help. I said yes, and we already had everything we needed to do the spell. So we did it, and it was fine.” She stands up, starts to pace. “We found it. We found Anna’s grace, and it wasn’t even that far. Cas said he was gonna go get it, and I… didn’t care for that plan,” she admits.
“Just a black iced coffee? You’re sure? The coffee here kinda fuckin’ sucks unless you load it up with syrup and creamers,” Dean says.
Just when he thinks it can’t get any better, the wings are moving, and he’s watching as Cas drags them up onto the bed. He feels the contrast of the rough drag of Cas’ fingernails and the soft, protective wings wrapping around his back. He buries his nose in Cas’ hair, grinding down on his lap. He’s squirming and whimpering and trying like hell to get Cas as close as he can, in every sense of the word.
Anna smiles at him, and she presses her lips to his cheek. “Thank you,” she whispers, just barely above her breath.
“What, angels have special healing powers?” Dean asks. It would honestly be the least surprising thing he’s learned about angels so far.
Cas’ tongue darts out to lick at Dean’s bottom lip, and Dean presses impossibly closer. He can hear Jack sucking on air, so without breaking the kiss, he lets go of Cas’ jaw and feels around until his hand hits the bottle, and he takes it out of Jack’s mouth and Cas’ hand. He’s still kissing Cas just as slowly as he reaches behind himself to put the bottle down on the table. Jack stays silent as they kiss, and Dean’s hand settles on top of the kid’s belly.
The instant the words have left Dean’s mouth, Cas’ eyes glow bright, icy blue for a moment. The bulb in the lamp next to them bursts, as does the one across the room. No other lights in the room were on, but Cas can’t be sure he didn’t just blow out all the lights in the entire motel. Maybe the whole block.
Hesitantly, Dean takes his balled up jacket and lays it in Cas’ lap instead. He rests his head there, tries for a minute to get a little more comfortable, and eventually works it out. He’s still curled up, but his spine is straight at least. He won’t wake up as stiff as he would have in the other position. He’s a rather large man, but the truck’s bench seat is a little longer than even the Impala’s, so Dean makes due.
Dean hears the scrape of Cas’ chair on the hardwood floor and then he hears bare feet padding slowly toward him. There’s a gentle hand on the small of his back, and Dean does his best not to relax into it. “I’m not trying to fix you, Dean. You don’t need fixing,” Cas says quietly. “I just want to be here for you. I know I can’t do anything, and I don’t want to try. I just want you to know I’m not going to leave you.”
“What do you mean, different?” Dean asks. He wasn’t aware that there’s more than a couple of types of love in the world — familial and romantic. He sure as shit hopes Cas’ love for him isn’t the former. That’d be — well. Horrible, really. Dean can’t think of anything much worse, all things considered.
Dean’s Adam’s apple bobs up and down for a few moments, and then he’s nodding. “Of course. God, Cas. Yes,” he whispers, pressing their mouths together again for a long moment. “How?” he asks.
Cas breaks the kiss to look between them, and he groans. Dean's dick is pressed right against his and they're rutting together, the spray of the shower making it smoother. He holds tight to Dean's biceps and drops his head to rest on his shoulder, still staring down between them.
"Okay, Dean. Thank you," Cas smiles, curling his fingers around Dean's wrist for a moment before he heads for the bathroom. This is another one of those times where Dean wishes he could just hop in with him, he just wants to be clean. He doesn't even really have an ulterior motives for wanting to shower with Cas. He just wants this vamp stench off him, like, yesterday.
“Oh, please. Spare me, Dean. You think I don’t know what’s happening tomorrow night? It’s a suicide mission. I know it, and you know it, so don’t pretend like you don’t.” The whole time Cas speaks. He’s cradling Dean’s head to his chest and whispering. Dean never stirs in his arms.
Cas speaks up, then. “None of you know this,” he says. “I only know because I was involved in Heaven’s plans for so long, but—“
Cas immediately releases his shirt collar, but doesn't step out of his space. Instead, he throws his arms around Dean's shoulders and hugs him. Tight. Like, so tight that Dean hears his back crack in a couple of different places. He isn't complaining, though, it felt good. And it feels good to be touching Cas again. They still haven't crossed the line. They were safe, right at the edge of it.
The kiss is achingly tender, and Cas handles him as if he’s about to break. Dean figures it’s probably deserved, because he
Dean slowly stands up off the cold ground, sitting on the bed with his legs hanging off the edge. He doesn’t even know where to start. “I need… I need you to go through all of it again. Slower. I… I think I was in shock yesterday,” he admits.
Dean thinks, and Jack pulls back from the hug. Dean smiles sadly and ruffles his hair while Jack wipes at his own eyes.
Cas wraps his hand around Dean, his touch almost too light. but it’s certainly better than nothing. Dean rolls his hips up into Cas’ grip, blindly searching for his waistband as he turns onto his side. He dips his fingers just below the elastic and lets them curl around Cas. “Fuck. I want that
“Yes. Goodnight, Dean,” Cas says, and he sounds just about as wrecked as Dean had, so he doesn’t feel quite as bad.
feel sleepy. His eyelids are heavy and so are his limbs where they rest against Cas’. He squirms his way closer, somehow, impossibly closer. He wiggles his thigh between Cas’ legs and wraps his arm all the way around him. He might hate himself for it later, but he hasn’t felt as safe, warm, and carefree as he does right now in a
He plops down next to Cas again, intentionally sitting closer to him than he had been before. He unscrews the cap of the whiskey and tilts the bottle up, taking a long swig. It burns down his throat and blooms through his chest and stomach. Dean loves that burn, loves how it numbs him from the inside out. He offers the bottle to Cas who takes it without hesitation. This is a recipe for disaster.
“Should I turn the heat down? Are you too hot?” Cas asks, already making moves to get back out of bed.
Cas nods, but neither of them make any move to pull away. Dean presses forward for one more kiss, and then he finally puts some space between them. When he pulls back, Cas is blushing with his hands folded in his lap, hiding what Dean assumes is at least part of an erection beneath his hands. He chooses to ignore it and not poke fun at Cas, because Cas isn’t really equipped to deal with being made fun of or having an orgasm right now. He just turns to the sink and pulls a large cup out from under it.
the windshield, but none of those things will help him get to Dean faster, so he doesn’t. He just presses harder on the gas, and weaves in and out of traffic. He ignores the blaring of horns from angry drivers, because they don’t matter. He has to get to Dean.
Dean cries so hard that he doesn’t even notice when the attic door opens. He doesn’t notice Cas undressing to climb into bed with him. He only knows Cas is there because he feels the bed dip, and on instinct, he turns to look at him.
Dean’s face flushes under Cas’ gaze, as if he wasn’t just inside Cas a couple minutes ago. It just makes Cas smile bigger as he watches Dean wipe his hand on an already-dirty shirt and throw his robe on. He leaves the room for a couple of minutes, and comes back with a warm rag and a glass of water for them to share. He puts the water down on the nightstand and wipes his hand and chest off a little better, letting the robe hang open.
Dean makes an attempt to deflect, "Gotta put some antibiotic cream on that and bandage it, then I think you're good, it's mostly bruises other than-"
Cas beats Dean to answering her. “Very much so,” he sighs. “We appreciate your kindness, Leslie, but we’ll be on our way. Sorry for bothering you,” he says, and he’s wrapping his fingers around Dean’s wrist to tug him out the door before Leslie can so much as argue.
He’s sniffling now, and he’d been too lost in his own prayer to realize it until Jack is peeking his head out of his bedroom door. “Hi,” he says quietly, and he sinks down next to Dean on the ground. Dean shoots him a well-meaning smile, but he can’t force a genuine one out of himself right now. Dean throws an arm around the kid’s shoulders, and lets Jack lean on him.
Cas just nods as he finishes up the last of his breakfast, sipping at his juice as he eyes Dean with concern.
Dean settles back against the headboard once more, but he doesn’t release Castiel’s hands from his hold. “I want… you. God, Cas, I want so much from you that I’m not sure what to do with all of it. I wanna make you breakfast in the mornings, I wanna kiss you awake and make you take your vitamins. I wanna take care of you. I wanna be here for you. I want…” he trails off to flick open one side of Castiel’s robe, “…to touch you. I wanna make you feel good, Cas, and not just… not just like this.” Dean clears his throat and lets one hand curl around the bare skin of Castiel’s hip. “You said it. This isn’t about that, not entirely. I just want
“Forget somethin’?” Dean asks, and he thinks his heart might start beating out of his chest like a goddamn cartoon when Cas swings the door open in nothing but a towel. He’s seen the guy naked pretty much every day for the last three weeks and it never stops being earth-shattering.
Cas is, however, decidedly less afraid of Dean's ass than Dean is of Cas'. Dean audibly gasps and has to brace himself with his palm flat against the wall of the shower. Cas' hand is brushing over a part of him that has literally never been touched by another human being. He squirms a little but he certainly doesn't protest. He just allows Cas to wash him, reminding himself that nothing about this whole thing has been sexual, and he doesn't have to worry about Cas trying to fuck his ass just yet.
surprise! my birthday is tmrw and i’m worried i’ll forget to format for ao3 and upload it amidst all the chaos so. here. take this <3
Dean swallows. He leans forward and presses his lips to Cas’ just for a moment. “I make you feel?” he asks.
"Well... Cas probably needs some sustenance, I'll be back in a while with food," Sam says, clearing his throat. Dean hardly hears him. He waves a hand in acknowledgement, not able to tear his eyes off of Cas just yet. He's scared if he looks away, Cas might pass out on him. And judging by the looks of him, it's not even an irrational fear.
He isn't going to wear pride pins, or hang the bisexual flag up in his bedroom, but he wants to be able to hold Cas' hand in public without fear.
Dean groans, his hands tangling in Cas’ hair. “Cas,” he whimpers. He pulls one hand out of his hair so he can drag his thumb across Cas’ upper lip where it stretches around his cock. “You look so pretty like this,” he breathes. “So pretty with your mouth around me, shit. Shit, sweetheart. You’re gonna kill me, aren’t you?” he says, throwing his head back against his pillow with a breathless laugh.
He sits on the arm of the couch, angling his body toward the two of them. “Okay,” he says. He takes a deep breath. “What the hell happened to him?”
His bath water is so cold now that he’s almost started to shiver, and that’s when he hears a knock on the bathroom door. He hadn’t locked it, so Sam or Dean could walk in here and see him like this, pathetically curled up in cold, murky bath water with his knees to his chest. It still isn’t enough to prompt him to move, not even when he hears a voice on the other side of the door.
Cas feels Dean’s hands on him, feels one on the small of his back, and another on his waist, fingers digging in like they belong underneath his skin. Cas thinks that if he could get Dean that close, he probably would.
Anna stands from the couch and crosses the room to wrap her arms around Dean’s shoulders. He thinks she’s standing on her toes to do it.
When the bag is full, she zips it up. She plucks Sam from his crib and places him in his car seat, buckling him in. Once he’s secure, she turns to Dean. She doesn’t look so much like a robot anymore, and her face goes soft. “Dean, sweetie. You’re so brave. We’re gonna go now, and when we do, I need you to walk in front of me and keep your eyes forward. Don’t look back, okay? Just go to the car. I’ll be right behind you.”
Once Cas is fully washed and rinsed off, he returns the favor to Dean. He uses the same care and attention that Dean had used on him, and it makes Dean feel a little bit sick in the best way. He's nervous, twitchy, sensitive. He isn't used to anyone looking at him like this, caring for him like this,
Cas sighs even louder this time. “I just have… a very high tolerance, Dean. Would you like to go back inside until I’m okay to drive?” he asks. Dean gawks at him. High tolerance his ass, nobody’s tolerance is
If Castiel really gives it some thought, he and Dean have been intimate for years. They share touches that Dean doesn’t even afford to his brother most days. They sit side by side on the couch to watch movies. Dean let’s his guard down around Cas in a way that he doesn’t with anyone else. Not even Sam. When it’s just the two of them, Dean will reach over to fix a stray strand of unruly hair. He’ll smooth his hands down Castiel’s shoulders and tell him his shirt’s wrinkled, but his hands always linger.
Cas’ eyes rake over his form, and Dean definitely feels a lot more naked than he is. He feels his face flush as he looks down at Cas in nothing but his boxers, and Dean’s not looking, but if he were, he’d wonder if Cas is half hard in his boxers or if he’s just seeing things. He twists around a couple of times, cracking his back and rolling his neck so that it pops, too. Cas’ eyes never leave his body. “Not long,” Cas finally answers, long after Dean forgot he asked a question in the first place.
Cas squeezes there for just a second before he moves to cup Dean’s cheeks. He holds his cheeks, rubs his thumbs under Dean’s eyes as they kiss, dips his tongue into Dean’s mouth. His hands roam back down to rest on Dean’s hips rubbing circles into his hip bones.
The next few hours consist of a lot of scrambling, a lot of groaning, and more than a few tears shed on just about everybody’s part. Dean thinks he even sees Bobby shed a few while he’s taping Sam’s wrist. They think it’s sprained.
Nobody answers him, so Cas assumes everyone is happy with this plan. He slips on his shoes and slings his own bag over his shoulder. “I’ll be in the car.” His tone is flat and lifeless, which is exactly how he feels.
Sam’s just kinda staring at the ground, so Dean clears his throat and starts to shuffle up in bed. “Where’s Cas?” he croaks, and he feels like he hasn’t used his voice in days even though realistically there’s no way it’s been more than a few hours.
Cas rubs up and down on Dean’s back and tries to settle his own heart rate. He takes a few deep breaths. He never thought he’d be allowed the privilege of holding Dean like this again, after Hell.
“You don’t need to ask,” Dean says quietly, pulling Cas down by the back of his neck. He knows Cas’ tongue was just
He pulls open the passenger door and lets Cas out before he ducks inside to turn off the car and grab the keys out of the ignition. He nearly knocks Cas over when he stands back up, but the dude’s made of fucking bricks or something, because he just grabs Dean by his forearms to steady him. “Everything okay?” Cas asks him. “You look… frazzled.”
Cas kisses right above where the tip of his thumb is still inside Dean. “If you want my fingers, I’ll need actual lubricant,” he says softly. “Is that what you want?”
“Uh, he’ll have a coffee. Lots of creamer. Same for me, but hold the creamer,” Dean says. Beck writes it down on the ticket.
besides Cas and what may or may not be happening to him while Dean sits on his ass, completley and utterly useless. Anna guides him to the table, sits him down, and places a stack of french toast in front of him. “Just a few bites,” she pleads. “You didn’t touch your dinner last night. You have to eat.”
Cas thinks, and he’s right. It’s a small bottle, about half-full, and Cas takes the opportunity to just look at him again. Dean’s cheeks, neck, and chest are all flushed so beautifully. His hair is sticking to his forehead, which is just slightly damp. His chest is nearly heaving from how hard he’s breathing, and there’s only one word that comes to mind.
He finally opens his eyes, and he's so startled that he rolls off the bed entirely. He hits the floor and curses, the blankets and sheets around him doing next to nothing to break his fall on the cold concrete floor of Dean's room.
Dean just swallows and nods his head. He waits a minute, and he looks like he’s contemplating maybe saying something, or doing something? Cas can’t tell. He knows Dean well, and he used to be able to read him like a book, even without
Dean knows that Cas doesn’t quite grasp a lot of human concepts. Dean’s had to teach him a lot. But he’s fairly certain that Cas understands that dudes don’t just… hold hands and pull each others’ hair and kiss each others’ necks. But what if he isn't? What if Cas isn’t aware of all that stuff, and Dean is totally misreading the signals?
Dean thinks about it for a minute. He tries to put himself back in that bar -- so much has happened since then, but he finds it relatively easy. That in and of itself should probably be telling, but he tries not to linger on it. Aaron’s cute. He’s cute in the nerdy sort of way, and Dean didn’t really think he had to be attracted to guys to see that much. But now that he’s really thinking about it, he
Castiel raises his eyebrows, and he looks… smug, almost. Maybe just amused? Jesus, it’s hard to get a read on this guy. “I was going to offer to help you study,” Castiel says, “but I wouldn’t want to be a distraction.”
A lot of things can surely be said about Cas, but he certainly doesn’t waste any time. He removes his hand and repositions himself between Dean’s legs, trailing kisses from the inside of his knees, all the way up to where his thigh meets his groin. Dean’s squirming with it by the time Cas finally grips him by the base and licks a stripe from root to tip. Jesus, he feels like a fucking teenager.
He gets out of the car and carries the bags of flowers out toward the middle of the field. He gets far enough away from the road that he can’t hear cars passing, but he can hear the quiet trickle of a stream somewhere nearby. There’s the windmill. Dean knew he had the right place, he doesn’t think he’ll ever forget exactly what this spot is, but the confirmation is nice.
Dean shoots straight up in bed, scrambling away from Cas so quick that he gets tangled in the blankets and lands flat on his ass, on the cold hard-wood floor of the room he’s in. Cas clicks the light on and then he remembers, yeah, this definitely isn’t his room. It’s somewhere close, but he has carpet in his own room. That would’ve broken his fall at least a little bit, and now with the light from the lamp flooding the room, he can see, this room is much bigger than his own.
“Yes, Dean. Thank you.” Cas still has the towel around his waist, so Dean can just turn around for a second once he gets the boxers up over Cas’ knees for him. Cas starts speaking as Dean kneels to start dressing him, “I used to lead armies,” he says quietly.
would he say that? Oh well. Can't take it back. "But not boyfriends. Makes us sound like we're teenagers. Partners." He settles, and his hands shake as he turns around to flip the bacon. Hes praying to God (Jack?) that Cas doesn't acknowledge the 'husband' comment, because he hadn't even really meant to say it. He was in no way, shape, or form ready to be married to Cas. He hadn't even given it a thought until literally just now.
Dean’s always up first, which is a weird adjustment, but he’s getting used to it. He can usually flip the covers off of Cas, lift his shirt, and clean him up with only a few disgruntled sounds from Cas. He almost never fully wakes up, not even if Dean needs to reapply triple antibiotic ointment.
“You’ll wanna use that remaining grace to take your wings out for a few more spins, right?” Dean asks, smiling at her. “They sure are pretty. It’d be a shame if you didn’t get to say goodbye.”
"Well it's no fun if you just let me," Cas sighs, rolling his eyes. Dean walks over to turn off the water, and then he walks back over to plant one right on Cas' mouth. "I love you," he sighs against his lips. It gets a little easier every time he says it.
“Are you hungry?” Cas asks, “You should eat something. There’s food here, for you and Anna. I can make you something,” he says.
It’s even worse with food,” he complains, but he’s got a goofy, gummy grin on his face as he speaks. He throws an arm around Dean and leans over on his shoulder, “But we love him. Even though he’s a grump.”
Cas adverts his gaze when he sees Dean reach for his belt to pull it off, presumably to take his jeans off and climb into bed. In the meantime, he decides that if he’s going to be laying in bed with Dean, he should probably at least take the coat off.
Dean is sure he looks thoroughly fucked as he speaks, he can feel his own spit, wet on his chin. He hasn't stopped grinding his own hips into the bed, so if Cas hadn't noticed before, he definitely had now. "It's okay, Cas. Come for me," is what comes out of his mouth, which is fine. It's not like he has control over his brain or body or
Dean smiles at that and wads Cas’ boxers up, wrapping them and the t-shirt in Cas’ clean sweatpants. He’ll wash those when they get back to campus, it can wait. It can all wait.
Cas presses the pads of his fingers into Dean’s skin beneath his shirt as he starts to speak. “I understand you think you’re unworthy,” he says, and Dean tenses in his arms for a moment. There’s a pang in his chest, but he continues. “But you aren’t.”
“I got you a chocolate chip waffle, two eggs over medium, an order of bacon, an order of hashbrowns, and a slice of toast. Not that you asked, but I got the same for myself. Except I got sausage, not bacon. And my waffle is plain.”
She’d been thirteen when she’d been placed with them, and now it’s been a little over a year. It’s her fifteenth birthday, and Dean and Cas have a special surprise for her.
It’s just bits and pieces, really, a few dreams or flashbacks here and there when he smells smoke, or that one time he’d smelled whiskey on Bobby’s breath on a weekend and recognized it as exactly what his mom had smelled like when she walked out of their old home for the last time. He’d cut his thumb open working on the Impala and wiped the blood off on his jeans, and recalled a stain nearly identical to that one on his mom’s pants the night of the fire.
Cas nods thoughtfully, but doesn’t say anything else for the rest of the drive. He does hum along to a couple of the Zeppelin songs playing through the speakers though, so Dean counts it as a win.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Fuck no. You guys have fun riding in that glorified Little Tikes whatever the fuck, Cas can just ride with me in the Impala,” he says, taking Cas’ coffee and sipping on it again, which earns him a side-eye and an eyebrow raise from Charlie. He flips her off with the straw in his mouth, and Cas smiles next to him. Dean catches only the tail end of it, when Cas is looking down at his lap with little more than one corner of his lip perked up. He mentally kicks himself for being upset he missed the whole thing.
Dean wakes up to an empty bed and the smell of cinnamon. He frowns — he doesn’t like it when Cas isn’t there when he wakes up, but at least he can be sure that Cas is still in the house. Missouri wouldn’t let him go out in the snow. Speaking of —
Cas smiles a little but he shrugs, “I’m not all that worried about ‘chicks’,” he says, complete with air quotes, which makes Dean chuckle.
Anna shakes her head. “Just me. Brooke and I have been over the spell more than a few times. I know what to do, how to do it. If it’s going to work, I can get it done,” she promises.
“I mean it, Dean. Thank you for looking after him. I know how you felt about him… I even understand why. You didn’t have to take care of him, but you did anyway. I’ll always be grateful,” Cas says, rocking Jack gently in his arms.
One of Dean's hands is still around Cas' dick, stroking the part of it that he can't fit into his mouth in time with Cas' slow and gentle thrusts. Dean's other hand comes up to grab onto Cas' hand. The one that isn't presently tugging on his hair. Their fingers interlock and Dean's heart swells. He always thought of blowjobs as some filthy, sexy thing until now. The way Cas is holding his hand and looking into his eyes and thrusting into his mouth so fucking slowly makes this one of the most intimate experiences Dean has ever had.
"Okay," Dean's voice breaks and he coughs. "I've never done this before, Cas. I'm guessing you haven't either," Cas opens his mouth to speak, but Dean presses a finger to his lips. He doesn't want to know. "I mean, I've seen gay porn. I kinda know what I'm supposed to do. But there's gonna be some trial and error here, 'kay? You're gonna have to tell me what feels good and what doesn't." Dean has never been good at communicating in an emotional sense. But in a sexual one? He knows he's caring, considerate, and willing to listen. Dean has lived most of his life aiming to please anyone and everyone, and his sexual partners are no exception. This one especially. This is
Dean leans into Cas, the phone still pressed tight to his ear. “Cas told me,” he says. “He told me everything, mom. Demons?” he whispers the last word, curling his body further into Cas. “Why didn’t you ever say anything? I don’t understand, mom. I’m
That’s exactly what he does. He presses in close and throws one of his legs atop both of Dean’s where they’re stretched out. His arm wraps around Dean’s middle, and he smiles when his face rubs against the soft robe covering the skin of Dean’s chest.
Cas drops a feather-light kiss to his head, and Dean stops breathing. He goes completely still, like if he doesn't move, maybe the moment won't shatter. Maybe if he stays still, he can live right here in this moment forever. Cas obviously notices Dean go still, because he does the same thing.
Cas turns to look at him and he raises one eyebrow. He forgot how completely oblivious Dean could be before he became the stone cold leader of the resistance against Lucifer. “Don’t tell me you haven’t even
misreading signals, or this guy is shamelessly coming onto him without even knowing he’s gay. “Uh, I mean, are you free right now?” Dean asks. “There’s a coffee shop on campus, it’s like a five minute walk from here.”
Cas nods at him just as Beck sits their coffee cups on the table. Dean thanks them without taking his eyes off of Cas, waiting for him to say something else. “Very excited,” he starts. “I haven’t ever exactly… celebrated.”
He doesn’t remember it, not all of the time, and definitely not clearly, but he understands what happened. Understands that it’s not something they talk about. He figures the rosary beads and weird patterns on floors and behind paintings probably have something to do with it, so he never asks.
“Anna’s grace,” Dean answers, and Cas’ hand freezes. It grips him. Then there’s a mouth covering his own, overgrown stubble brushing against his own, and the hand on his waist is pulling him closer. That isn’t exactly the reaction he’d been expecting, but he’s not going to deny Cas or himself a post-coital make-out session, even if they
Before he can make it anywhere, Dean grabs his wrist and pulls him back down. “No, it’s fine. Thank you, though. I’ll be fine now that I lost the shirt,” he says. He stays facing Cas as he settles into the blankets. Cas reaches over to turn off the lamp, and they’re both plunged into near-darkness.
Her face drops. Shit. Dean knew this was a bad idea. “What is it?” She asks, and she sounds small. Scared, almost. “You’re not giving me back, are you? Jesus, guys, whatever I did, I’m sorry, okay? I know I’m a lot to handle, I know I skip school and smoke weed and come in past curfew, but —“
Cas breathes out a sigh of relief. “I’ve never loved Charlie more than I do right now,” he says, and he reaches around Dean to adjust his wings. “They were crooked,” he offers.
Cas nods and stands up, holding a hand out for Dean to take. He does, and he doesn’t let go until they climb into the car together.
Cas presses kisses all along the vein on the underside of his dick. “I don’t need to see you to know that right now, and always, you’re beautiful,” he says, his warm breath hitting Dean’s cock and making him twitch.
“I love you,” Cas says. “I know you, Dean. I know your soul. I’ve seen it. I can see it now,” he whispers. “You’re beautiful. I’m going to get you through this, I promise.”
is going on here?” Dean snaps, jerking his thumb over his shoulder to where the guards are still attempting to get into the room.
Their mom had been wonderful. She had done her absolute best, and she’d loved them through every second of it.
Dean’s a little nervous to leave them alone together after… whatever he witnessed a few minutes ago, but he does what he’s told. He knocks on Sam’s door, who pushes past him to get to Christmas dinner at the speed of light. “Jesus, kid,” Dean mutters to himself. “The food’s not goin’ anywhere.”
“It’s— well, it’s… good to see you, man. Thought we lost you,” Sam says, his eyes flicking up to the rearview mirror to look at him. “How did you…”
For now, he needs to get Cas in some warm clothes. He unlocks the car and roots around in the backseat until he comes up with both of their bags. Dean had done some digging around in the trunk, and he’d found one of Sam’s old bags. Cas is older than Sam was the last time he wore these, but they’re clothes that he’d had to buy the kid after his first real growth spurt. They fit Cas just fine, and a couple of the shirts are even a little too big on him. It works, though. It’s fine. Dean slings both bags over his shoulder and heads inside. He checks twice to make sure he locked the door behind himself, and he makes his way up the stairs.
She laughs and shakes her head. “I need to go to bed,” she tells him. “Feel free to shower before you do the same. I’m pretty fond of you two, but you both need it. The room across from the bathroom is open, and so is the one just down the hall. Not that I think you’ll need both, but —” she smirks, “just in case.”
. He always had this look in his eyes like he was a lost puppy. And, dammit, he probably felt exactly like one. That was Dean's fault. Dean's the one that booted him out of their home. Dean's the one that abandoned him when all he needed was a place to
Dean shakes his head. It’s now or never. These things have always felt easier in Purgatory. Hell, everything’s easier here. He’s
Cas thinks. He's truly so lucky to have this, so lucky to have Dean. He had danced around his own feelings for Dean for years before he became human. But he remembers becoming human, falling from grace, he remembers his love for Dean overwhelming him. He couldn't shove it down anymore since he couldn't use his grace to suppress the intensity of human emotions.
Castiel feels like he could burst from the pressure of all the love building up inside of him, threatening to start spilling out of his mouth and never stop.
Dean wakes up with a pounding in his head not unlike what he imagines it feels like to have your head bashed against concrete. Needless to say — not happy. But he thinks he hears sizzling coming from the kitchen, and then he
Dean shakes his head and puts one hand on Cas’ thigh, dialing the number Charlie gave him with the other. “No, I gotta know,” he whispers. He lifts his eyes to meet Cas’ as his fingers hover over the call button. He leans in, presses a kiss to Cas’ lips, and then hits call. He turns it on speaker while they wait.
It’s Christmas now, and Dean listened. He got himself and Cas three weeks in the honeymoon suite of a
it honestly baffles Dean a little. He probably comes from a military family or something. Shrugging it off, Dean packs away his laptop and slings his bag over his shoulder.
think about how beautiful Cas looks. All the time. Without even trying. Even when he’s sick or injured, his eyes never dull. Dean’s noticed, how could he not? He’s sure everyone and their mother looks at Cas and thinks he’s beautiful. Dean’s not blind. It doesn’t mean anything. He just has eyes.
Cas curls up into him this time, laying his head on Dean’s chest. Dean runs his fingers through Cas’ slightly sweat-damp hair and smiles. “I—I uh,” he starts, and oh God, he’s really about to say this, isn’t he? “I really like you, y’know that?” he says quietly.
He must have drifted out of consciousness, because the next thing he knows, he's jerking his head up at the sound of the bathroom door opening. Cas is standing there with a towel hung almost too low on his hips, and it takes every ounce of strength inside of Dean not to whine. And he almost does it, anyways. Cas looks so fucking
Dean watches him walk up the steps to his apartment, stays parked outside of it for way longer than necessary. He grumbles to himself, this feels wrong. Are they
"God, sweetheart, yes. Anything you want, I'll give it to you, just ask, it's already yours," Dean is absently aware that he's babbling, but he really doesn't give a fuck right now. He's grinding against Cas and his body feels like one huge live wire. The friction is so sweet, but just not
He doesn’t bother whipping it off, just starts in on the button and fly of Cas’ slacks, shoving them and his boxers down. “You’re eager,” Cas says into his mouth. “Slow down. Enjoy this,” he breathes. “We don’t know when we’ll get this again.”
Dean has to hold back a sob, and restrain himself from squeezing Cas tighter. He only lets himself hold on for a moment longer before pulling back to flash a bright smile. If Cas notices that his eyes are glassy, he doesn’t comment.
Cas is whining now, his breathing heavy. He looks desperate and needy and like what he's about to do is going to be the hardest thing he's ever had to do in his life when he says, "Dean, I- I'm-" and then he pulls Dean's hair to pull him off, which means it's
Its times like this, when Cas leaves him alone with his thoughts, that Dean starts to freak out a little. He feels sick. He never wants to be without Cas again. He had been beside himself with grief not even 48 hours ago. And now, that's gone. Or rather, it
didn’t think you’d ever use it again,” he says sadly, but he lays Jack on top of the changing table anyways.
Dean’s eyes well up with tears again, but he nods. “Okay, mommy. I love you,” he whispers, and he holds out his arms to take his baby brother.
Cas plucks the joint from Dean’s fingers and puffs on it for a moment, watching Dean watch him. He wonders absently, if Dean from 2009 has got his shit figured out yet, if he’s realized how he feels about Cas.
Cas pulls Dean against his bare chest and holds him there. Dean can hear his heart beating, and he lets it soothe him. They have today, he reminds himself. Tomorrow, they set off to find a witch that can wipe his memory and send Cas home, but at least they have today. “He loves you, y’know,” Dean tells him. “The me that you know. In your timeline.”
By the time Dean has Cas stripped, the water is running warm, so he plugs the drain of the tub and lets it start to fill up. Cas is still slumped with his eyes closed, but Dean can see his chest rising and falling pretty steadily. He takes Cas’ hand in his own as he waits for the tub to fill up, allowing himself a second to breathe. “Cas?” he asks, loud enough to grab Cas’ attention but hopefully not so loud as to startle him.
Bobby’s about the closest thing he and Sam have to a father, though, so Dean keeps his mouth shut. His mom has a late shift at the hospital tonight, so they’ll be here a while. He’s not gonna ruin it by being a smart-ass. He shuts his mouth and eats his food, glad to be warm and safe.
“You—are you sure? You don’t have to,” Cas says, but he’s rolling his hips down into Dean’s, and he sounds a little breathless. Almost like he’s seconds away from coming already.
“What? No, mom, Jesus. I just… haven’t told him? And I think his family might be super religious or something. Just keep it between us, okay? He’s kind of important to me.”
“Yeah. That’s -- I mean, God’s kind of my step-son,” Dean explains, and Aaron turns to look at him like he’s insane. Maybe he is, a little. “Yeah, I know. His dad is -- he’s --” he searches for the words and comes up short. “His dad’s my -- Jesus. He’s my best friend,” he breathes, and he kicks his feet in the water. He splashes them both a little, but Aaron doesn’t seem to mind. “He helped out, too. From what I understand.”
Which is fine, because Dean is enjoying this. He's enjoying taking his time to take care of Cas, to wash him. It gives him an excuse to shamelessly admire all the details he had missed last night in the heat of the moment. He takes note of Cas' thighs, which are more muscular than he had expected them to be. They're steady beneath his shaking hands. At some point, Dean abandons the loofa and opts to start washing Cas with his hands. It might be slightly less effective, but it still works. He stays away from Cas' dick for the time being, just barely missing it every time his hands slide along Cas' inner thighs. He makes his way all the way down until he's washed Cas' feet, and then he stands back up.
“Cas?” Dean mumbles. “It’s three o’clock in the morning, babe, what’re you doin’ awake?” he asks, and even through the blanket thrown over his head, Cas can see the light peek through when he hears Dean click on the lamp.
"I missed it," is all Cas offers in response, his mouth full. Dean thinks to himself that he's been a bad influence, and he's got Cas talking with his mouth full now. He doesn't really care, actually. It makes him smile that Cas has picked up some of his habits, but he tucks
He lines up and steadies himself above Cas. He leans down to kiss his lips as he pushes in slowly. He whimpers at how
Dean almost drops the fucking phone. “How the hell do you know I’m in El Paso? Charlie, go the fuck home. I’m not kidding. This isn’t something you should be in the middle of.”
There’s no sexy way to wash your own ass, but Dean’ll be damned if he doesn’t give it his best shot. He considers turning around and slipping one of his fingers inside, but — he decides against that. Not without actual lube. He’s not really interested in finding out how that feels, so he settles for washing as quickly and thoroughly as he can before reaching between his legs to tug at his dick again.
He orders Cas’ plain black coffee as well, iced, and waits at the other end of the counter for their drinks to be ready. He turns to catch Cas staring again, and he shoots him a smile like it’s the easiest thing in the world. He’s not going to admit it out loud to anyone
They’ve graduated from spending a lot of time in the living room to hanging out in Dean’s room. The bed is just more comfortable to hang out on, and the TV in his room is bigger anyways. It’s not like anything has
something gay is going on between him and Cas makes him feel a little sick. It isn’t that he doesn’t trust her, he just doesn’t want to deal with anything that comes along with coming out to your closest friend. It’s too much on top of everything else. But whatever, right? He doesn’t wanna fucking fail Art History, and Cas has a knack for it. The guy’s like a walking Google search.
“Don’t care. Gotta keep you alive,” Dean says, and Cas pouts. Dean leans down to kiss it off his lips, and he feels Cas smile. Works like a charm. Dean doesn’t even mind the morning breath, not if it gets Cas out of bed to eat something.
Is he supposed to believe Cas hasn’t ever done this before? Because he doesn’t. Not with the way Cas’ hand roams up her body to rest against her throat, not with the way his hand trails down the side of her face. For fucks sake, he can see
Cas rubs up and down Dean’s spine and presses a kiss to the top of his head. “I know,” he says quietly. “But you’re doing what you can, and I’m proud of you. Dean, we’re going to figure something out.”
Cas thinks for a moment, and then shakes his head. “No, he didn’t.” Cas is secretly pleased to hear Dean differentiate between the dream-version of himself, and the real one. He leans down to kiss Dean again as he starts to very slowly press inside of him.
Sam nods solemnly. “Yeah, unfortunately. Rowena knows them. But I’ll call if I need you,” he promises, handing the room key to Cas.
there’s a lot of time skipping in this chapter — sorry! but the good news is we’re starting to finally dig into the actual meat of the story. a lot of your questions will be answered this chapter. but a few more will pop up. thanks for sticking with me so long, and this chapters another doozy at almost 10k words. hope you enjoy!!!
Dean nods and moves his finger slowly, pressing gentle kisses to the inside of Cas' thigh. He feels him tighten around his finger, and he leans his face against Cas' thigh, looking up at him. "You have to relax for me, baby. It'll feel better. I promise," Dean says, but it's an empty promise and they both know it. Dean has literally
It breaks Dean’s heart a little. Cas looks at him with glassy eyes, reaching out to touch his cheek. “You… are you afraid, now?” he asks brokenly.
The sludge encroaches on Castiel’s abdomen. It’s probably up to his bellybutton now, and it’s not slowing down. “It’s the Empty, Dean. There’s no time. We’re all out, and I am
“D’you, wanna… Maybe watch a movie with me?” Dean offers, and Cas stares at him, wide-eyed. Of course he would want that. They haven’t had time in a while, and it would be nice to stay up with Dean, sharing a bowl of popcorn and laughing through the night.
badly. He already knows it. Maybe he can just pretend to fall asleep ten minutes in. Dean would buy it, he’s still pretty tired from being poisoned by the Djinn.
Dean shakes his head. “No, man. I mean, it went really well, you know? I’m just — relieved, more than anything. It’s — it’s not a bad cry. It’s alright.”
Cas lays back down and pulls Dean onto his chest, who once again, allows himself to be guided in any direction that Cas leads him. Dean is pliant and warm against his chest, but Cas knows they’ll both get cold shortly. He brings the blankets up to cover their lower halves, and then he cards his fingers through Dean’s hair.
He realizes now that tears are flowing freely from his eyes, which is weird. He doesn’t know when that began. “I—“ he tries, but the words die in his throat before he can get them out. He all but faceplants into his mother’s shoulder, wrapping his arms around her.
Dean relaxes a little at this, and takes the bacon out of the pan. He lays the strips on a paper towel to let it soak up some of the extra grease. Dean's had enough of examining his emotions so closely this morning, so he plasters a smile on his face and says, "Be a dear and grab the eggs out of the fridge for me." When Cas eyeballs him suspiciously with one eyebrow raised, Dean lets the fake smile fall off his face and replaces it with a real, softer one. "Please?" he adds, leaning in to peck Cas' cheek.
Dean swallows and slowly lets his hand fall back to grip Cas’ wings. Not hard, not like he had been, but a little harder than just stroking them. He holds on, can feel the muscles and flesh and bone beneath the soft feathers. He can feel them move. If this is the only true part of Cas he can ever witness, he’ll take it. This is pretty damn awesome.
"Yeah, I'd say so. You hit your head pretty hard last night while we were drinking. Sammy here spilled some beer, you slipped in it. Knocked your head right on the Library table, man." Dean chuckles, presumably thinking back to watching Cas fall. "I was worried for a sec, but you bounced back. Probably hurts like hell now, though."
Sure enough, there’s Anna doing shots with Meg. He breathes out a sigh of relief and walks up to her, wrapping his arms around her waist. “You don’t just wander off from your friends at a fuckin’ frat party, Anna,” he says into her neck, pulling her close. He pulls back and tucks her hair behind her ear, sighing. “Now, pour me a shot.”
Dean shakes his hand, firm grip, he notices. A little too firm, actually, but that’s respectable. “Oh, right. Cool name, I think. I’m Dean,” he says, dropping Cas’ hand after hanging on to it for a beat too long. “Couldn’t help but notice you staring for the last hour and a half,” he says, summoning a boldness from deep inside himself he hadn’t even known existed until the moment the words were out of his mouth.
Dean presses another kiss to Cas’ neck before Cas rolls off of him, and then he gets his ass in gear. He rolls out of bed and pulls on whatever pants are closest to him, not bothering with a shirt. Who gives a shit, anyway?
Cas leads him through the Bunker, and they're still wet. Less wet than they would be with their soaking wet clothes on, but they're definitely tracking water all through the Bunker. Dean follows closely behind Cas, wrapping his free hand around Cas' where it circled his wrist. This was a stupid idea. Dean should have just had his way with Cas in the garage. He thinks he might die if he has to wait much longer.
Dean nods his head and he pulls back. He rubs his hands over his own face, his tears mixing with what's left of Cas’ on his palms. He sits back down next to him and places his elbows on his knees with his face in his hands. “I’m sorry,” he says, and it’s muffled. “Sorry.”
Sam just sighs and nods, but there's a frown on his face like he's unconvinced. "Okay, man. If you say so. I'm gonna go tell Cas bye, and then I'm off. Call if you guys need anything," And with that, Sam leaves his brother with his thoughts.
There are three fingers moving inside of him with ease now, as Dean whispers soft declarations of love to the skin of Castiel’s hip. He stops for a moment, buries his fingers as deep as he can get them, and he
Dean rolls his eyes but he leans into Garth anyway. He’d been a little put-off by Garth’s affection when they first met, but he’s grown accustomed to it, and he’d never admit it, but he even likes it sometimes. He doesn’t have a lot of guy friends, and the ones he does have aren't affectionate in the way Garth always has been. Garth wouldn’t be, well,
Dean takes the towel and wraps it around his hips, tucking it into place. He steps out of the shower and into Cas' arms, kissing him deep and slow, because
“This story is about an angel that fell for a human man,” he says. He doesn’t get far before Dean interrupts.
When they’re in the bathroom, Dean helps Cas sit on the ledge of the tub and starts to run the water. They’re going to have to pack a bunch of shit up today, so Cas should save his energy. They can have a bath today, and they’ll just do a quick rinse off afterward.
That night in bed, Cas tells Dean he knows. Dean just puts on a guilty smirk and apologizes, and Cas forgives him. Of course he does. He has been for the last two decades, and he will until he dies.
He finishes the toast anyway, because maybe if he finishes it, Cas will take that as a good sign and he won’t keep staring at Dean like he’s ready to drop everything and glue him back together.
Slowly but surely, he’s learned how to survive here. He only ever has to fight something that’s unlucky enough to cross his regular paths. He tries to move without a pattern, but even angels are creatures of habit. And besides, it works. Nobody’s onto him yet. He only has to kill a werewolf here, a vampire there. He’d run into a wraith once, which had been unsettling at the most. As it turns out, all monsters he’s run into during his time here have been easy to kill. A headshot isn’t required for a wraith, nor is silver for a werewolf. Beheading has worked on everything he’s encountered here, and he’s willing to bet it works even on things he hasn’t.
Cas clears his throat. “I…” he starts, “I know Dean said this, but I’m very grateful for all of you. I didn’t have many friends at my last school. I’m sure you’ve all noticed that I’m… a little odd.” He gets a soft laugh for this, but not a malicious one. Cas
Dean wants to fire, wants to start unloading rounds in the general direction the Djinn took off in. He knows he can't anymore, though. It could be shielding itself with Cas' body. If Cas were still an angel, Dean would fire at it until he ran out of bullets. But Cas is human, and he has a better chance of surviving the Djinn, as long as they catch up to him in time.
Cas pushes deeper into him until he bottoms out. He groans, rolling his hips just barely. “Don't be,” he says, dipping his head down to kiss at Dean’s neck. “I don’t want to hear that some fake version of you loves me. I don’t care about that.
As Cas pads down the hallway with Dean hot on his heels, he thinks about how lucky he is for all of this. He worries a little about the fact that he can't remember a time when they
she continues, completely unfazed by Dean’s mildly violent display of affection, “There’s a party this Saturday. We’re all invited, and now Cas is too,” she says, shooting him a wink.
“Yes?” He says, and he winces at how his voice sounds when it erupts from his throat. His vocal cords vibrate together slightly differently now that he’s human, and he’s not sure he’s fond of it. Before, when he’d been an angel, control of his voice had been natural. Instinctual. But now, it cracks and breaks in all the wrong places at all the worst times.
Missouri comes back into the living room looking — sad? Dean’s not sure. He can only hope the woman hadn’t been reading his goddamn mind that entire time. She puts down a small platter with cream and sugar and two cups of tea in front of them, and she sits in a small chair across from them. “What can I help you boys with?” she asks, and her eyes linger on Dean’s, looking for — something. Dean doesn’t know what. Maybe some sort of outward indication that he used to whore himself out for money to feed his little brother. Her eyes go a little wide when he has that thought, so Dean averts his gaze to Cas and hopes he takes that as a cue to do the speaking.
“Just you, here. In this bed. All day,” he says. He knows what he wants, has no idea how to ask for it. It’s been a month of this, and they still haven’t
They're always touching each other. A shoulder squeeze here, a hair tousle there. Cas always gets closer to him than strictly necessary when they brush past each other, or when they sit on the same side of a booth in a diner. They're just small, meaningless touches. Meaningless to Cas, Dean assumes. His own stomach does backflips every time Cas so much as
She’d blurted that she doesn’t even like dudes, and the guy had called her all sorts of horrible, awful words. Dean didn’t even think twice about swinging on him. It had been how they became friends, actually. Charlie had been pretty reluctant to let him go, after that. She’d introduced him to Anna and Garth, and up until now, they’d been the only people he had any real interest in getting to know.
But Dean doesn’t ask him to. Dean starts the water again, but doesn’t plug the drain. He’s filling a cup with water, and he’s rinsing the filth from the lining of the bathtub. It hasn’t had time to dry, so it doesn’t stick. It slides off the porcelain lining of the bathtub and down the drain with ease, and when Dean makes his way to the side of the tub that Cas is facing, he turns his face in the opposite direction. He still can’t look at Dean, but his friend doesn’t try to make him.
Dean sighs again. He pinches the bridge of his nose and tries to collect himself. This may be the most awkward phone call of his life, but just hearing Sam’s voice puts him at ease where he hadn’t even noticed he was tense. Something unfurls in his chest, just knowing that Sam’s doing well. “Yeah, man. I’m good, y'know? Great, even.”
Then, all at once, Cas’ senses are full of Dean. He’s wrapped in a tight hug, and he’s genuinely surprised. This is the second time in the last twelve hours that Dean has hugged him. That’s more times than he’s hugged Cas in the last month, maybe two.
Sam crosses his arms above his head, letting them rest on the truck. He dangles the room key from one hand as he speaks, “You guys can head back up, if you want. Rowena and I need to get the Grimoire from the witches who did this,” he says.
right where his fingertip is pressed against Dean. He smears it there, pressing against it. Not enough that it slips inside, just enough for Dean to get used to the pressure. “Fuck,” he hisses.
Dean nods his head. “Sure,” he says. “Stop by the roadhouse sometime. I owe you one,” he adds, and he holds up his empty glass. In a moment, it’s full again.
Yeah, no way in hell was Dean letting her slip through their fingers. She needed a place to grow into herself, and Dean and Cas could give that to her.
most likely unnecessary is the way he wraps the arm that isn’t holding the bottle around Cas, resting it on top of the table but still rubbing circles into his back. He leans even further into Cas’s space to put the bottle in the baby’s mouth, showing Cas the right angle to hold it at.
His mom had gotten called into work a little over an hour ago, and Sam went to hang out with his friends to ring in the new year, so it’s just Dean and Cas at the house now. They sit in front of the TV, side by side, waiting for the ball to drop. Dean’s got one arm slung around Cas’ shoulder, and Cas is watching the TV, but Dean’s only looking at Cas.
Slowly, Jack shuffles backward on his knees. He looks up at Dean with sad eyes, nearly identical to the pair he looked straight into as Cas begged him to stop, begged him just to get out of that place. Jack blinks up at him, slowly. “So tell me,” he says. “Tell me what happened.”
“Even me,” Cas admits, finally looking up to meet Dean’s eyes. He fucking hates this, he’s nowhere near high enough for this. Not even close.
It could be Cas. It probably isn’t, but it could be. It could also be somebody waiting to kill them. It could be anything. But they can’t ignore it, not really. More knocks. The wall adjacent to the door shakes.
But... what throws him is how Cas didn't want to leave. Cas was perfectly content to stay in his perfect little world, even if it meant dying in the real one. He can't pin down why that is. Was it because dream-Dean was more affectionate? Because Dean certainly took note of that. He could be more affectionate. He could hug Cas a little more, be a little kinder sometimes. It won't kill him. Touchy-feely isn’t in Dean’s nature, but he doesn’t mind the lingering touches from Cas. In fact, he often finds himself wishing they’d linger a little longer. He wishes that he wasn’t so emotionally stunted, that his father hadn’t fucked up the way he views affection toward other men that aren’t your family.
Dean lowers himself down to sit on the bed, trying his best to take deep breaths. He screws his eyes shut. He has no idea what to do with any of this. He wants to lay down in his bed and not come out for the rest of the day. It doesn’t even sound like an awful idea.
Cas had been a great dad, and Dean’s just something akin to a shitty step-parent that the kid gets left with when their biological parent… dies. Not that Jack is Cas’ biological kid, but sometimes Dean wonders.
“So you don’t love me back?” Dean asks. Cas is at a loss for words. This is never how this was supposed to go. His heart jumps into his throat when Dean starts to tear up, but he keeps his eyes on him anyways. “Listen,” Dean starts, “I may not be able to remember your name right now, or even my own, but after all of that…” Dean trails off. He turns to look out the window, and Cas can’t help but stare.
And it's this train of thought that leads him to thinking about Cas in a more general sense. His head bounces from one thought to the next. How he looks, how he smells, how he speaks. How he carries himself. How is tie is always a little crooked and his jacket always a little wrinkled. He closes his eyes and he can see Cas' face as clear as day in his mind's eye. He can see his jawline, his always-messy hair, his slightly grown-out stubble, and his eyes. God, his eyes. Dean can zoom in on them in his mind, and he does. The last thought he has before he drifts off to sleep is that he feels like he could drown in those shades of deep blue. He dreams of the ocean, deep and vast.
"Yeah, baby? Like that?" He does it again, earning himself another moan. He smiles at this. Dean has always gotten off on his partner's pleasure. He takes a lot of pride in his ability to make women feel good, and he's proud of himself for getting the hang of this so quickly. Dean leans forward as he continues to move his fingers, taking the head of Cas' dick into his mouth. He sucks gently as he fucks his fingers into Cas, pulling all sorts of noises out of him that Dean never wants to stop hearing.
Dean nods. Sammy has a bed in his own room and in their mom and dad’s room, so he’s already in here this time. “Not dad?” he asks.
Dean laughs weakly against him and burrows into the hug. “We should pack,” he says softly. “Gotta get on the road in the morning. Told mom we’d be there before dark.”
It’s infinitely better than Castiel ever imagined. He’s thought about this moment more times than he can possibly attempt to count, even just since losing his grace. Castiel hadn’t expected them to, but Dean’s lips certainly don’t disappoint. They’re just as plush and soft as they look. They’re wet enough that there’s an easy slide to the kiss, but not so wet that it’s too much. He’s really not sure if there’s anything that could deter him from kissing Dean though, as long as he knew he had permission. “You have no idea…” Castiel breathes into Dean’s mouth, pressing forward again to cut himself off before he says anything that will have Dean fleeing.
Cas presses an unmistakable kiss to his neck, and Dean has to fight to keep himself upright. “Right, of course. I’ll have to go home for a while to get my things,” he says into Dean’s neck, arms still wound tightly around his waist.
Every time Cas comes over, they do little more than watch TV. Sometimes, Cas helps Dean study with the stuff he struggles with, and lets him work in silence on the stuff he’s good at. They always order food — Dean hasn’t really had the time nor the patience to cook anything recently. It’s so many
Dean whimpers against him, pressing impossibly closer. They stay like that until Dean no longer can, until his muscles start to ache from the awkward position. “Do you think we can just stay here tonight? Checkout isn’t ‘til 11 like y’said, ‘nd I really don’t wanna drive eight hours right now,” he breathes, and Cas smiles at him.
Cas kisses his ear, just once, and says, “I promised,” a kiss below his ear, “that if you forgot,” another kiss, right where Dean’s neck meets his jaw, “everything I told you,” one more, and he lets his teeth graze the meat of Dean’s neck, “that I would remind you,” he finishes. Dean is breathing heavily beside him, and Cas leans over him to press a kiss to his temple before settling back down.
you’re not asking me to repeat it again. Yes. Tell me what to do.” Dean bites, and he’s sure the look in his eyes could kill. Or maybe he’s about to cry. He can’t tell, but he’s trying
he hears, an addition that Dean hadn’t intended to let him in on. Not yet, at least, and Cas crumbles inwardly at the thought of never hearing Dean speak those words aloud.
Dean pauses with his fork halfway to his mouth. He knows his mother. He knows that tone. Cas is about to get
Two thirds of the way into the movie, Cas is leaning his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean doesn’t dare risk moving to check if he’s gone back to sleep, but when he reaches for the popcorn and doesn’t feel Cas’ fingers brush his own, he has his answer anyways. He tilts his own head over on top of Cas’ after the credits roll, and he turns off the TV. He’s not going to wake Cas. It’ll probably kill both of their backs to sleep like this all night, but Dean doesn’t really care right now. This feels nice, and he’s going to let himself have this, if only just for tonight.
“Okay,” Dean says, and that’s all. He turns the radio up a little and sings along under his breath to Black Dog. He doesn’t really feel like thinking too hard.
Jack rolls his eyes and stands up from the floor. He smiles at Dean and places a hand on his shoulder, something he no doubt picked up from his father. It makes Dean want to fold in on himself. It makes him want to strike up a deal with the Empty to come sweep him away. No body left behind to deal with, no trace that he was ever even around. He catches Jack’s wrist with his hand and shakes his head, removing Jack’s hand from his shoulder.
He watches Dean hold the joint between his thumb and his middle finger. He watches him puff on it twice before blowing the smoke out and handing the joint back. It’s… bizarre, to see Dean act this way. The Dean he knows hasn’t smoked with him for at least three years, probably longer. He stopped smoking with him around the same time he stopped staying the night after either fucking Cas, or letting Cas fuck him. Usually the latter. Cas always invited him to stay, still does, but after the first night Dean denied to sleep next to him, he never did again.
“I don’t doubt it,” Cas says, and Dean spares a glance at him to see that he’s smiling again. “Are you and Anna…?” he trails off, the end of the sentence going unsaid.
than you could ever understand or comprehend. You don’t understand the multitudes which you contain. You can’t see it, Dean. But I can. Your soul… it…” He trails off and pulls back, and Dean feels like he’s being flayed alive. He feels like Cas is looking straight through him, past all the blood and bone and gore, right to his middle, where everything else that makes him up resides. He supposes he’s probably right. Cas is checking him out right now. But not just
huh? Am I the only one who can hear the guards trying to get in here? We’re in some deep fucking shit here, guys!” He’s pacing now, he can’t help it. He’s fucking nervous. He’s
his face flushes when he says it because he can feel it. “Just so… y’know, we can both see the screen,” he finishes lamely.
warnings in the end notes! nothing major but there are a couple little things i felt i should warn for here just in case
too close for the real thing. He tries not to gag as he takes it from Cas’ hands. As bad as it smells, it’s a fucking miracle. They need this, and they got it.
Jack’s grip loosens then, but he doesn’t let go, and he doesn’t stop frowning. “You killed my father,” Jack says, full of a quiet sort of rage, the kind that chills Dean down to his bones. Sometimes, it’s easy for him to forget that Jack’s pretty much the most powerful being in existence, if you don’t count God himself. Chuck. Whatever. The point is, Jack could decide right here and now that Dean should be dead, and Dean
Dean laughs, just once, short and aborted. “Yeah, you’re right about that. Thanks,” he says again. “You’re welcome to stay here. You should be safe.”
he says. He doesn’t mean to let it slip out of his mouth, but it does. It’s there. He’s said it. He’s been thinking it for weeks, he’s known pretty much since he laid eyes on the guy in Art History that he’d be helpless to do anything
Cas nods once and squeezes Dean’s shoulder for a moment before he heads out the door. “I’ll see you in class tomorrow.”
“Yeah, man. Pre-law, good grades. Probably even got some friends. I’m real proud of ‘im,” Dean says, and he sniffles again. “Thank you,” he adds quietly.
“I forget my lunch, like, every other day,” Dean snorts. “Not that I mind, but seriously, what’s up?”
Dean chuckles again, that same low, breathy laugh. He sits up and strokes himself a couple of times, throwing his head back and groaning. Cas may not know as much as Dean about what it means to be human, but he knows that Dean is putting on a show for him. He also knows it’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever witnessed.
Cas hums against him, wiggling his tongue to get it deeper. He pulls back, “If you want,” he says simply, before burying his face once again.
and it seems to calm Jack a little faster, so it’s fine. If anything’s worth using his voice again, it’s comforting Jack. And besides, he’s not actually saying words. He’s just trying to offer comfort. “I’m sorry for what I said to you,” Jack says quietly, into Dean’s tear-soaked shirt. “I didn’t mean any of it. I was just mad.”
“No clue. Sam’s not here either. I haven’t checked the other rooms, but we know they aren’t in the attic, both bathroom doors are wide open, and I have no clue why either of them would be in Brooke or Anna’s rooms,” Dean says. “Where the fuck did they go?”
Mary smiles wide again, pulls him into a hug, and his heart shatters a little more. “Then why do you look like you’re about to puke, sweetie? That’s great!” Dean clings to her for a moment before he steps back again. Bobby puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Mary frowns. “What? What is it?”
Cas grumbles and focuses his attention back to Dean, who hasn’t stopped looking at him the entire time. He feels his face heat up, which is
though. She calls me sometimes to fix her wifi all the way from here. I tell her the same thing every time,
If Castiel can’t make himself useful, there’s no reason for him to stick around. He knows it, and he’s sure Dean knows it, so he had to do
Dean swallows. He opens his mouth to talk, but he can’t get any words to come out. He just does what he can, and he moves his fingers to thread between Cas’ without breaking eye contact. He squeezes three times in a row. He’s not sure if Cas will get it, if Cas will understand. He prays to anyone who might be listening that somehow, he’ll get it.
Cas turns to him, stiff and red faced, his mouth open like he’s trying to find something to say. Dean’s brows furrow and he squeezes Cas on the shoulder, “Hey, what is it buddy? You need some air?” he asks. He knows the signs of a sick drunk, and Cas is about halfway to having the exact look on his face.
Dean nods. “I know, sweetheart. I know that. You’re not getting rid of me anytime soon,” he whispers, pressing forward for another short kiss.
Galaxies hold on to Castiel’s human form in their bedroom. Stars explode out of Dean’s skin and into Castiel’s flesh. Galaxies cover him, protect him. Here in this room, constellations outside of the observable universe cling to the flesh of one man. There is nothing, Castiel realizes, nothing more important than this, here, in the bedroom of the man with stars hand-painted across his body.
Dean really hates when people pity him. He knows he looks at least a couple years younger than he is, his clothes are pretty much perpetually dirty, and he looks about a week away from starving half the time, but — he likes pie more than he hates being pitied, so. He flashes his most grateful smile and elects to leave her more of a tip than he originally planned on. “That’s awful sweet of you,” he says. “Thank you.”
"Dean?" Cas asks, and he looks like he isn't sure if he should wrap Dean up in his arms and never let go, or if he should turn around and bolt in the other direction.
When he turns back around, Cas is standing in nothing but his boxers. Dean swallows and folds the clothes back up, and he puts them down on his desk. “You can just… put ‘em on if you need to go get Jack,” he says, voice hoarse.
Dean’s tongue flits out of his mouth to wet his bottom lip. This is dangerous. This is scary. He can’t do this. He can’t do this to Cas. Cas just wants him to show he cares in a more physical way. Cas never asked for this. There was no sign that he wanted any part of this in his dream. Dean can’t just shove that onto him without asking him about it, without knowing if it’s something Cas would even want.
"Dean," Cas rasps out, and even though Dean isn't squeezing his throat, it sounds like he is. Cas' voice is so strangled, so rough. "Please."
Sam turns around to pilfer through Dean's bag, pulling out the Dream Root. He microwaves some water in a paper cup, dumps some in, and stirs it around.
But Dean? What does Dean do? Well, apparently, Dean confesses his love to his best friend in fucking Monsterland of all places, which results in his best friend getting killed. Then, when Dean makes it home alive, he downs a third of a brand new bottle of whiskey in one go.
Cas shrugs, “I don’t really mind. I mean, we say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other on the day of, but exchanging gifts has never been our style.” As he speaks, he won’t meet Dean’s eyes, which Dean has learned is a telltale sign of Cas holding something back. He’s also learned not to pry, so he leaves it. Even though he’d like to pick at it a little, he doesn’t. It’s not the time. They’ll be together basically non-stop for the next three weeks, so there’s time. He’s got time to get Cas out of his shell. They’ll get there eventually.
Castiel nods. He doubts that even the force of his Father’s will could drag him away from Dean. “I love you,” he admits quietly, to the fabric of Dean’s robe. He pinches it between his fingers. He isn’t waiting for a response, because he doesn’t think he’s going to get one. Those aren’t words he’s ever heard Dean say to anyone, not even to his brother. They don’t come easy to him, not in a familial sense, and certainly not in a romantic one. Castiel knows this, knows
Dean presses kisses into Cas’ thighs on either side of his head as he starts pumping his finger. Cas’ breathing picks up, and he still doesn’t take his eyes off of Dean’s. “You look — shit, Cas, you look so good like this,” Dean says, and he lets out a breathy chuckle when he does. “More?” he asks, pulling his finger out to press another against him, without pressing back inside yet.
“Jesus, Cas,” he whines. He tries to squirm away, but all he really does is grind down on his tongue where it’s slipped past the ring of muscle, starting to stretch him the tiniest bit with only the tip. “Isn’t that— aren’t you grossed out?” he asks.
Castiel curls in tighter on himself, and he lets Dean cover him with his body. He lets Dean hold on to him. He lets Dean protect him. This has always been how Dean shows love, and Castiel will take it from him in any form he’s willing to give it.
“I got time,” Aaron shrugs, and he finally turns to look at Dean. He’s got the straw in his mouth, and he’s sucking his drink down so quick that Dean can see it draining from the glass in real time.
hehe enjoy another dean chapter! im aware my writing from dean's pov is waaaaay stronger. its the deancoding i apologize
Dean doesn’t realize there are tears running down his face until Sam sits down across from him, slides a single-serving frozen pizza across the table, and gives him the softest eyes he’s ever seen from the kid. “Hey,” Sam says quietly, and he reaches out to wrap his hand around Dean’s forearm. “It’s okay, you know. To talk about him.”
Cas launches into an explanation about Hellenistic art, about how its sculptures emphasized natural yet extremely expressive movement. He describes that Hellenistic art also does its best to depict realistic body parts in idealistic manners. Dean cocks his head at that, at the contradiction, so Cas pulls up a photo of a sculpture called Laocoon and His Sons. He gets it, then. It looks like a real body, but the dude is just
Cas lowers his hand from Dean’s temple, and their hands come to rest in Dean’s lap, his fingers still curled around Cas’ wrists. “Ask your mother, Dean. Call her.”
By the time the grilled cheese is cut into triangles and plated, the soup’s warm. He puts the bowl on top of the plate, and then puts that on top of a tray so that Jack can eat in bed. He knocks twice before he pushes Jack’s bedroom door open, and Jack finally sits up.
him watch them, because God knows Cas doesn’t watch movies on his own. He claims he’s more entertained by his own thoughts, which is something Dean can’t even begin to understand, and he really doesn’t want to.
Brooke nods quickly, “Of course, sorry. Um. Good luck. I think he’s okay, just faint from all the blood loss.”
Dean makes his presence known by walking down the stairs a little louder than he probably needs to. He smiles when he sees Cas, and Cas returns the smile in full. Dean throws an arm around his shoulders. “Hunting? Cas? Are you kidding? I don’t think this guy could hurt a fly if he wanted to,” he says, ruffling Cas’ already-messy hair even further.
Dean figures. He's laying on his back in the darkness of his room, eyes wide open. His hands are folded under his head and he's breathing heavily. He's teetering on hyperventilation, actually, but he forces himself to breathe deep and slow before it gets too out of hand. Hot tears roll out of the corners of his eyes, dripping down into his ears. It's an uncomfortable sensation, but Dean can't bring himself to care enough to lay in a different position. If only his father could see him now. He scratches at his scalp and squeezes his eyes closed, willing the tears to come to a stop.
Cas pulls back and isn’t looking through him, past his flesh this time. He’s looking straight into Dean’s eyes. “I see you, and I can do nothing
Cas tucks his finger into the waistband of Dean's joggers, and then pulls the drawstring. He shoves them down Dean's thighs enough so that he can shimmy out of them the rest of the way on his own. What Dean does next is completely out of his control. He pushes Cas backwards until they land on his bed, and crawls on top of him. He's straddling Cas' hips and grinding their hips together as he grabs a fistful of hair and kisses him filthier than he's ever kissed anyone in his life.
Dean shakes his head and leans forward. He presses his lips to Cas’ and all he can taste is the salt of their tears, but he doesn’t care. “I believe you,” he whispers, because he does, and he feels like an asshole for making Cas cry. He feels like a dick for not being able to keep his emotions in check when Cas has obviously been holding back a lot of his own. Cas wants to stay just as bad as Dean wants him to, he’s just been keeping quiet about it for Dean’s sake.
