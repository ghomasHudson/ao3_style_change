Though he knows it means pain, Tony could no more avoid her as he walked through the halls of his mind, than he could avoid himself. She's more a part of him than his blood and bone.
Following the attack on Tony’s safe house an “investigation” had been launched into his care and the contract between Potts and SHIELD. Nobody expected them to get very far proving that Pepper was abusive as an owner, and though they’d likely argue negligent until they were blue in the face, it was obviously just a smoke screen to hide their true goal.
"Well when they do Ms. Romanov I'm sure you'll be the first to know." Fury sneered and then he rolled his eyes to Pepper and said dryly, "I'm only telling you this much because I've been reminded that I'm contractually obligated. Now all of you, get the hell out of my office."
“That’s all I ever wanted to do, from the first day Tony, was get him out of that cage and away from all those people who had hurt him. I promised him I'd keep him safe, and when we were kids I think he really believed I could. But we got older and things changed. He changed.
Bullshit Tony thought. They were escaping in an aircraft, he knew it. He scanned the sky looking for any sign and cursing the fact that wasn’t light out when he’d have a better chance at it.
Thor was frowning thoughtfully and seemed to realize the other occupants of the room were staring blankly at him and shrugged.
A Pride was built around a marriage of many minds yes, but it was not without a center, and if the core was weak, then the body would be weak.
Tony unhooked his sunglasses from where they hung on his shirt collar and placed them back on as he prepared to make his exit, because this was all he had to say and he wasn't sticking around for more when he was finished.
Natasha shifted, turning to slowly lower herself onto the bed across from him. He watched her as she flipped through the next few pages, memories from that Christmas long ago and so many more before she finally looked up at him, some calculation flashing through her eyes.
As he breathes he imagines himself to be sinking inside their stream. He lets their ebb and flow surround him until Bruce’s thoughts are not just an impression but a steady stream of pictures surrounding them in brilliant display.
“Hi Honey, bad day at work?” He batted his eyelashes at her and she rolled her eyes, but as predicted let the gesture pass without violent retaliation.
There are glittering parties full of chains and leashes, painted lips and diamond studded collars.  Everywhere they go there are cameras.
“And you are naturally wary of strangers.” The tom nodded in understanding. “It is a calming tea. Mr. Stark. Heat puts your body under a lot of stress and with tonight’s events you are in danger of overloading yourself. This root is known to provide a stabilizing effect.”
“Is it possible somebody reverse engineered parts of the suit?” Bruce asked, replaying the clip of one of the thieves taking off at a run and springing off the wall to take flight, neatly avoiding becoming entangled in whatever ropey web like substance Spiderman was ejecting.
Tony might have been a little vehement about that last bit, which might be the reason Rhodey had pulled him away to berate him about his drinking.
"You need to slow your heart rate down." Natasha's warning was devoid of all emotion in tone but her concern wrapped around Tony through their bond almost in spite of how professional her mask was.
The whole thing about Kat’s liking to play with their food is a stereotype. But the thing about them is, there is an element of truth in every one. And it’s obvious now that whatever else T’Challa had intended to do when he’d infiltrated Tony’s home, he was the sort of tomkat who just couldn’t resist playing with his food before he ate it.
"Great." Tony nodded, some of the tension easing from his neck.  He didn’t trust Ross not to try and sabotage things. He was going to try, some way, and Sonia Dyson would love a way to take him down a peg or two hundred. Two hundred confirmed residents so far. Two hundred lives that would depend solely upon him for protection.
The machine issued a steady, almost perfunctory beep supposedly in rhythm with Tony’s heart as he lay in the center of the cradle, naked but for his underwear, eyes fluttering sleepily as Helen explained for the cameras recording the event that Tony had been given drugs to dull his senses but due to interference from Extremis they could not safely administer a dose strong enough to keep him fully under.
Tony frowned. A three day coma might seem normal to the Alurio but it was wigging him out. Where was Natasha, he wondered, reaching for her. Bruce was here, and that was great but he needed to touch Natasha but – Tony frowned, panic beginning to surge within him once more as he was met with only silence.
"Yeah, a couple guys at the VA and I had a thing going." Sam laughed, revealing a slight gap between his two front teeth. It gave him kind of a goofy look, but something about him warned Steve he probably took full advantage of how disarming that was.
Only, Ty had been like that too, the first time Tony's spindly teenage body had started pumping out heat pheromones Ty hadn't wanted to let go of him and they'd had so much reckless rebellious sex it's only a wonder that Tony never figured out that he was playing right into everybody's hands.
“I see you worked hard on this Kiddo and it’s good, very in depth. A plus. But I need to have a talk with your mom and you have a lesson with Bruce.”
"Forget it." He shrugged, downing the rest of his drink. "Water under the bridge. As you said, it's not like either of us had many choices."
“I’m trying to keep this from being an interrogation. He’s thirteen Cap. I can’t imagine doing what we do at his age. Kid’s probably scared stiff the government is going to realize he’s enhanced and have him put down. The last thing he needs is to have the Avengers ganging up to interrogate him.”
“I was fifteen and over confident. I was sure that if I saved my targets life I’d win his trust and complete the mission. But The Soldier… he’s relentless. He fights without emotion, he’s super enhanced even for Gata. He could have killed me that day. Should have, only he recognized me. We’d met in the Red Room and it was only because he hesitated that I survived the encounter.”
For those still reading this. I hope you enjoy. Posting in honor of seeing Black Panther tomorrow. I'm having a ton of T'Challa feelings right now and hoping to do some further world building this weekend for the upcoming visit to Wakanda in future chapters.
, way in which this is all proceeding that finally shocks through him like a bracing slap and gives him the strength to pull back and push back, begging for much needed distance.
Their progress was slow going but slowly but surely they pressed forward, the mist growing thicker around them the deeper they journeyed into the wood. It was also getting hotter as they walked, the moisture clinging to their skin with the mugginess of a swamp and Bruce thought they must be getting closer, because fire breathing birds and heat.
In contrast not far from where they’d stopped, Bruce had asked Miss Cho for a dance, and the two were talking quietly together as they swayed gently to the music. His throat was bare, hers was adorned by a thin silver chain, a heart shaped tag hanging from the end. It was a thin, delicate little barrier between them, but it might as well have been a wall. But despite it, there was color high on both their cheeks and a strength to their grip where their fingers entwined. It made Steve smile to see.
“Steve?” Tony called gently, stepping forward slowly with gauntlet raised because it was way past time to intervene.
One day this crime boss named Marko had approached Barney and made him an offer too good to be true. No more masters. A cushy pad. All the girls a guy could ask for and an endless supply of nip besides. All they had to do was run jobs and do security detail.
The only thing that makes it brighter are the pictures taped to the walls, brightly colored childish portraits of rainbows and suns, stars and universes.
Swallowing back the threat of tears Nyota Stark rolled her shoulders and shook off the dark clouds casting a maudlin shadow over her mood. The feel of her curls brushing against her cheeks made her grimace.  With the sudden appearance of the Builders and the threat to that other earth, they’d been working non-stop on the portal device. She hadn’t had a proper wash day in way too long and it was starting to show. Scowling, she reached up to grasp a flyaway coil, tugging on it dispassionately and wrinkling her nose at the dry feel of it between her fingers before she let it spring loose.
Bruce took a breath, thinking of turning around and just continuing up to his own floor (he was pretty sure he still had some of the tea in his own cupboard) but Steve blinked, drawn by the slight movement and looked right at him. He smiled thinly in greeting and Bruce returned the gesture nervously, slouching past Steve's chair over to the cabinet where he kept his tea because it would have been even worse at that point to try turning around.
He let out an exuberant whoop as he leapt off the edge of a roof onto the sloped roof of the neighboring building, but when part of the roofing crumbled beneath his feet as soon as he landed it drove a surprised breath out of him and he began to slide.
He'd been chafing to get up almost the minute he'd woken up at the hospital, despite looking like some horrendous version of two face, with one side of his body still healing from severe burns. Between him and Clint they'd been driving the hospital staff crazy.
Yinsen is helping the driver load the packages into the car, and Devi is giving Tony some new words to learn when it happens. Tony feels a hand slip into the pocket of his trousers and yank and by the time he turns around the older boy who has just robbed him is already disappearing into the crowd with Tony's spending money and his journal with his engine specs.
The amusement Steve felt at watching Tony talk circles around the table began to fade as something cold trickled through him. He couldn’t say what caused it exactly. Just a feeling of trepidation. Next to him Natasha had gone very still and was watching Tony very intently.
“Alurio or not, they have to be apprehended” he reminded everyone. “There are already protests organized outside city hall calling for greater restrictions on Gata activities and tougher oversight.”
"Don't make the mistake of thinking he's just a brain without a heart Steve. Stark is going to die of empathy just like the rest of us. He expects to be standing alone when it happens."
There wasn't anything Tony could do about it except pray not to get struck so he completely ignored the pieces of New York real estate falling around him and the screaming coming from below as he kept a firm grasp of control on the hover chair and spread his palms wide.
There were other words he found dancing on the tip of his tongue. For one reason or another he wanted to remind her of all the ways she was very much not a monster, how being violated in this way hadn’t changed any of the things that mattered most about the amazing individual she was. But he was sure he’d just make an idiot of himself (Clint would laugh for days if he heard about it) and in any case he kinda figured it wasn’t really the point. The point was she had been changed. Forced to. It was hard to heal from that sort of thing. Still, he hoped she listened. She did consider his words for a long moment, her eyes softening as she leaned toward him.
"MiKall, one of the kits that my mother fostered in Valhalla. She is to be married and many celebrations to be held. When I told my mother I could not attend I was forced to also tell her of your predicament. It was her suggestion that the Avengers attend the feast as well, as honored guests." Thor explained in a quick fashion that Tony suspected was meant to make him feel less nervous about the prospect of venturing off planet to dine with actual gods.
Steve didn’t know much about the inner workings of Gata biology but he’s unique in the fact that he’s had the privilege of knowing two feral Queen Fels in his lifetime. There weren’t words for it. Being close to a Queen was enthralling, addicting even. But Tony specifically…. Tony was like holding a Sparkler in hand under a black velvet sky. He was Iron and fire burning in your palm, warm and so beautiful you could almost forget it was dangerous, only you don’t want to. The danger was part of the enchantment.
"What's up Buttercup?" Tony looked now at Thor as he continued his work, hands flying across the console in front of him.
“You don’t have to say it back,” he says, his voice low and rough and unmistakably tinged with hurt like the thought of Tony not saying it back hurts, but he swallows and keeps going. “I just… I know this isn’t easy for you, and I know you could be with anyone. I guess I just need you to know I’m happy you’re with me.”
"What are you doing?" The curious tom asked and never one to pass up a chance to show off his babies, Tony motioned to the rapid series of numbers flashing over the holo-screen and explained.
Still, Ivan chooses not to answer. Giving nothing more away than he has to, he feigns that he is ignoring them both. He’s not. He’d never be that careless. They are his partners on this mission and his protegees, but he doesn’t trust them. It’s not a slight. Ivan doesn’t trust anyone. It’s not in his directions.
But this earth was already different. Already closer to home. She knew intellectually that in all the universes out there, there was surely more than one of her, but she couldn’t help the desperate hope growing inside of her that this was the right one.
“It angers me that even now I… I failed to protect my mate and my child, and now I won’t ever have the chance to again. And to feel this monstrous because of it; it’s so antiquated it’s practically biblical.”
“Home doesn’t exist yet. Landing here was a one and a billion shot guys and we got it.” Nyota swallowed the lump in her throat as she met each of their eyes. “I’ve been thinking. Our parents died because they refused to abandon this planet, even when they knew it was the end of everything. They stayed to try and find a way to save everybody, down to the last second. I don’t think they’d get on the ARK with us this time around either.”
"I'm sorry, did you mean to dial Steve?" Tony began, gaining confidence as he went, swatting his tail against the tom's side.
“Not sure how things are done in your neck of the woods but here in the USofA courting is considered really old fashioned. Steve and I are more of a done deal I’d say.”
It stayed quiet in the wake of Tony’s words and he felt a small measure of relief. Maybe they were both really listening now.
“That complicates things. We have plenty of Alurian scientists in Wakanda but I’m not sure how many will agree to come here. Your country is not safe for them and I will not recklessly endanger my people.”
Some of the best parts of Tony weren’t in his head at all - his wicked sense of humor, the way he always threatened his bots and bantered with Jarvis. The way he’d built a tower fueled by clean energy and welcomed a bunch of rag tag hard luck cases in and made them family- and one of these days he was going to really hurt himself, and that really bothered Steve because…
Pepper and Harley's mother were discussing the finer merits of custom jewelry. You wouldn't know it to look at her that Jena had a been studying Fashion Design before she'd dropped out of school to have Harley. Tony knew by the calculating look in Pepper's eye that some lucky bastard was going to being paying out a favor pretty soon. Probably Mel over at Darlings. Pepper practically kept the boutique in business with her obsession with their jewelry line.
“People make too much of things that are not their business,” the aging woman scoffed. “Sometimes I think I couldn’t love my sweet Rumiko any more, but who is to say if she weren’t a strapping tom that I wouldn’t find myself carried away by my affection?”
"Ivan." Clint realized, and Tony started, only because he hadn't realized that Clint knew about Ivan but then in retrospect, of course he did. Bruce looked confused but he kept his questions at bay.
"How long have you two been coming here?" Steve asked and Kitty huffed a noisy breath, sending her bangs flying upward.
"I suppose your sense of smell is inferior." She answered with a dramatic sniff and Tony tensed. "Didn't your mother ever teach you what happens when a tom meets a fel little halfing?
"Because lets be honest, the choices of where to go from here aren't that great right?" Tony went on, his eyes meeting children and adults alike as they swept over the crowd. They paused on a little girl in the front, the quiet one with white blond hair who Steve kept hearing him call Tink, and the kit lit up from head to toe like someone had lit a candle inside her.
Peter swallowed, saying nothing. Tony was right. Most people didn’t know that stuff, except for some of the old ladies who had lived on the block forever. Mrs. Krentz still liked to gossip about it sometimes while she knitted on her porch and Peter played with her cats.
Oh right. They were going to bed. Which had made him think of sinking into a pile of soft blankets which had made him think of that day on the beach. Yes. On to bed. Amazing idea. Thor had all the best ideas.
Guy had a point there, Tony thought as he pulled away with a purr, nuzzling Bruce’s cheek once more before finally releasing him. He supposed releasing him was the polite thing to do.
“Is that how you help people? By lying to them?”  he snapped, perhaps harsher than he’d meant. But it upset him, thinking of letting Tony go on believing that one day everything he’d seen would be real when Steve already knew it couldn’t be. It was manipulative and dishonest and certainly no way to treat a friend, let alone a lover.
"Neither was I." Bruce groaned and Tony thought he looked very green, but not at all for the usual reason.
A moment later he heard the sound of someone pounding on the front door and one quick sweep with his mind (headache slicing through his skull for his efforts) was all it took to confirm the worst. The foot soldiers were here and if they were here it meant they might be at the barn as well.
“What is it about the human brain you find so interesting?” Tony asked, but the young woman was already waving away his question before he even finished.
“Tony?” he barks as if he’s forgotten Tony was even in the room. It’s not unlikely. “Christ Obi, Maria will kill us both if she sees you giving him that.”
“He’s Iron Man.” Harley piped up bravely, finished harvesting his potato gun for parts, he handed them over to Tony. “And if you don’t want to be here when the bad guys get here, I’d do what he says.”
Natasha didn’t so much as blink, but to her credit she didn’t let the question hang in the air long.
Natasha was preparing to depart on her mission when JARVIS asked her to hold take off because Tony was on his way up to the hangar.
She got several photos of the event but she couldn't see enough from her location to capture any clear faces. Perhaps it was a wounded comrade but it was more likely that she'd just witnessed the transport of another test case. Getting inside the facility tonight had just become a top priority. She had a feeling this was pay dirt.
“I like your style, for a house pet,” Nakia taunted with that fanged grin, and the thing was Tony got the feeling she meant it. There was a glow of admiration in her eyes as Natasha kicked her feet out from under her, forcing the woman to flip and roll to regain her footing.
“Thor’s real.” Harley answered with a shrug. “I’ve already made like a dozen wishes. You need to hang up one or it won’t know what to leave you.”
The store is fading away like a photograph exposed to light too soon, leaving him and the strange kat, who hops off the counter with a sigh and strolls towards him.
“Got it in one Jolly Green.” Tony waved Maya’s flash drive expressively as he explained to the others. “We’ve been through the research backwards and forwards. The amount of energy it would take the human body to generate that kind of self-repair – to regrow an entire limb – we’re not built for it. It’s no wonder these guys are lighting up like fireworks.”
“More in a fish mood Buddy. Lets go with the smoked tuna and fries from Han’s Fish Fry, skip the green stuff. Order extras for the moochers.”
“Did you get what you needed from me?” Steve asked, already rising from his seat and Tony nodded, grin fading. He could tell that Steve was anxious to get back to what he’d been doing before Tony had pulled him away from yet another strategy session in the ongoing search for Bucky Barnes. Truthfully Tony could have tested the prosthetics without him but they could both use the break and Tony was starting to feel his absence.
Tony was still getting used to his new abilities and so was the team. The isolation rule had lasted about as long as his teammates could stand not seeing for themselves that he truly was awake, well, and that he’d come through the operation alright.
The battle had died down, the A.I.M agents seeming to lose the will to fight as soon as Tony had blown their fearless leader sky high like someone had flipped a switch (one of them was even blathering about mind control).
"He's mine. I'm his. We sensed it from the beginning. I don't feel it as strongly with the others as you probably do, but you know the potential is there." Natasha murmured lowly as Tony watched their teammates across the floor.
“You’ve played it down, but lets not be trite here Nicky. Let’s review the facts,” Tony began to tick off on his fingers. “We know they’re heavily populated by Alurio and that their ruling family is intermarried with their largest Pride. They hid their entire country for centuries to avoid being conquered by foreign powers and likely enslavement. My father stumbled upon their borders unknowingly in his younger years, and in return for their hospitality he robbed them.  And lastly, the rest of you only found out they existed when Klaw acquired some of my dad’s old things and got the idea to retrace his steps and try to steal more of their shit.”
Nyota and her crew repair their ship after tangling with the Avengers. Now that they have what they were after and can forge identities for themselves, there is only one thing left to do - prepare to say goodbye.
Because Fury just sighed and nodded, not putting up any of the fight that Tony had expected, already reaching for the button to the intercom as he said, “Have it your way Stark. Hill!”
“Show time gang.” Tony clapped his hands together as the sound of clicking cameras and rumble of voice rushed through the open door in a wave. “No pressure but this is our first ‘official’ act as a Pride so mind your manners or I can’t promise to protect you when Pepper tries to eat you.”
“Hey.” Spiderman, aka Peter Parker, greeted him with a nervous wave. “I uh… was in the neighborhood, walking, I was totally walking, when I- aaaah.”
“Stark,” Clint called out in greeting as Tony entered and Tony grunted, blearily making his way toward the refrigerator. He’d had his first and second cup of coffee down in the lab, and since Rhodey was already giving him the stink eye he figured he’d better grab some food to chase down the third.
The pull he felt towards the tower (and Tony in the tower) was a tangible thing now, but he tried not to let it scare him, or to wonder too long why Tony hadn’t broached the subject of bonding yet. He and Steve were still working on it, and once this whole mess with the Winter Soldier was figured out, he told himself then Tony would do it. He couldn’t possibly have any reason not to. Right?
God this place was a dump, but thankfully it was practically a treasure trove of odds and ends, little homemade devices that were obviously childish in design but rather ingenious in execution if Tony said so himself.
RaTu had been placed in charge of managing the armory tent that had been set up for last minute repairs and emergencies just such as Thor’s arrival with unprepared guests.
“You sure don’t smell like one either, Princess,” he commented with a wrinkle of his nose, whiskers twitching and Nyota made a face at him.
Kind of like the sound his mother used to make when she’d been lulling him to sleep as a very small kit only much much louder, Tony thought, and he was so busy gapping at the woman wondering if he’d interpreted that sound right, that he didn’t even think to get out of the way in case it meant she was about to go on the attack; but Steve must have thought of it because he’d grabbed Tony by the arm and hauled him backward by the time the woman had leapt forward.
As for who the stronger Queen would prove to be. Time would be the truest test, but Tony didn’t believe in going into battle without the utmost confidence in one’s self.
Smiling cheerfully Tony swaggered past him on his way toward the door, clapping a hand on Fury's shoulder along the way despite the frankly dangerous nature of his scowl.
"Ah so this is your hero is it?" Ana guesses, shoulders relaxing as her mouth tugs into a smile. Tony feels his face heat as the boy's eyes widen in question.
He's shopped here a million times with his boy, but people don’t send their kats on errands without a letter of permission. Kats aint supposed to have money of their own, though he’s heard some rich knobs give their pets allowances.
Unbidden, what that medic had said to him the night of the attack on the safe house came back. It wasn’t right, what AIM had done, what they’d taken away from him. But what was he going to do, curl into a ball and moan about how unfair it was? Wait for someone to produce a miracle cure so he could go back to his life and not deal with any of it?
When a beggar shows up at the kitchen door one night demanding to see Master Stark Ana is shocked. Thankfully Tony is there keeping her company and reading up on Africa. When he hears his voice, he knows it's the boy who saved his journal and Tony leaps out of his chair.
"Hey…” Tony forced out tiredly through his dry mouth and Bruce whipped around at the sound of his voice. “Don't be so mean to Banner Big Green. We like him remember?”
She saw now what Luke had meant, about the bonding being deadly, because there was no way she could get caught in that and break free. Tony would either take her in or take her down and she knew better than to put faith in his abilities just then, because he wasn’t in control of this. Maybe extremis was working in some ways. Maybe it fixed whatever was blocking Tony’s reach before, but now his mind might as well have been an open nerve. This was his subconscious grabbing at anything in reach, begging not to die alone.
Somehow they had to convince Tony that they were mad enough to want his heart, in both light and shadow and they couldn't focus on that until AIM was taken care of.
"Does it involve an island..." Bruce hedged and Tony frowned at him, wondering how he'd known that, figuring with Bruce in his lab so often he must have picked up something but then Bruce said, "I was on an island in one of my dreams . I think I had a mate and there's no way she could... well no way a lot of it could have happened without you."
"Can we remember that I didn't take the deal. " Fury reiterated forcefully, as if the more forcefully he said it the quicker they would understand. Tony was shaking. His heart was pounding too hard and his blood felt hot as it rushed to his head, leaving him with the strange feeling that he was literally about to combust and blow his own head off like one of Clint's cartoons.
“Either you’re still pretty pissed about that,” Steve remarked, straightening his stance as he flicked his eyes down purposefully to those gleaming claws once more. “Or you’re just happy to see me.”
His boy hadn't liked it, and neither had Ma, but the kit had insisted. Ma had let the kit keep the money. Said it was his, like giving it to him would make them all feel less dirty about what had happened.
Ivan resolutely pushes the insistent thoughts away. They are just preprogramed commands. They aren’t him. If he follows that directive this time, he’s just going to go blank again and they may decide to give the twins to another handler. He can’t let that happen. He has to see that they graduate the program successfully. They are his after all.
He wanted Harley to go to school with Tink and the other kits, because nobody questioned whether or not they could learn and the necessity of an education. He wanted high walls and thick doors and nothing but blue skies for miles in a place where he could entertain the thought of raising a family without a sick twist of dread and the ash of despair in his mouth.
At least he thought he did. But when he looked up and glanced around at the room to figure out just where that scent was coming from, all he saw were the completely unbothered faces of his teammates. Bruce was Zen, Clint was toasted and Steve seemed as predictably happy to have a lap full of cuddly kitten to pet as Tony had expected him to be. Which left Luke, who was looking rather stiff backed as he stared intently at Steve (who was making some joke about needing to read up on foreplay) but he didn't look at all as murderous as that bitter whiff had seemed to suggest.
Well in for a penny in for a pound, Tony thought darkly to himself as he raised the bowl to his mouth. He just prayed he didn't go back to his childhood. Anything but back there.
It took his brain a minute to catch up to the fact that the other one was no longer resting on the bed beside him but getting up to answer the phone beeping steadily on the bedside table. After sniffing out that they were still alone in the room Clint forced his body to relax, sitting up in the bed to watch Phil as he tried to follow the clipped conversation his partner was having with Agent Hill.
“What?” Steve asked, blinking kind of sleepily, like he was coming out of a daze. But his eyes were clear once more and intently focused on Tony as he asked, “Tony what’s wrong?”
” the breath punched out of Tony’s lungs as Steve took a hold of his dick, no ceremony about it, just a firm tug and then he’s stroking Tony like there’s a race to get him off and Tony has to dig his fingers into the man’s shoulders just to stay upright as pleasure jolts through him.
“I wasn’t prepared to be a mother. One minute you’re having a forbidden romance and you think you can take on the world, the next you’re staring at a pair of pink lines as your whole world comes crashing in. Daddy’s family always kept kats, horses too back in the day. That’s how they made their money. In the hey-day they were some real prize winners. We were the talk of the county.” Jena’s eyes danced with a hint of self-depreciating humor but Tony found it hard to join in on the joke, having been on the other side of that curtain.
So that was it. The army couldn’t make them super, but they could make use of the poor souls they’d driven rabid by throwing them at their enemies.
“You’ve got us there Your Highness, there have been a lot of people throughout history who have taken advantage where they shouldn’t have and I don’t doubt there will be a few more. But we learn from the past. We get stronger and we help one another. It’s always been that way, hasn’t it? The African kings had a great partnership with the Alurio.”
Tony was already curled up in the middle of Bruce's bed when he made it there, so after crawling in and letting Tony sleepily entangle their limbs he drifted off to sleep, confident in his chances of a good nights rest.
“Yeah?” Tony panted as Steve leaned down to kiss and suck at his neck, breath coming hard and hot as he continued to stroke him toward completion.
Nyota blinked back the unexpected prick of tears as Jaime's voice filled her head. He was currently stomping around on the outside of the hull, trying to patch up the hole while Matai and T'Cael were helping mend the broken wires and circuitry, closely monitored by Riri.
Tony expects to watch the thief disappear out of sight but to his surprise the thief is suddenly stopped by a figure stepping in front of his path and the two bodies collide, wrestling each other to the ground.
Grimacing he pushed the crazy thought of going to Tony’s room aside and reached for the abandoned sketchbook on his nightstand instead.
"Well you shouldn't have to. We're a team Tony, you don't have to go it alone." Tony's eyes flew to Steve as their team leader managed to make even something that should have been comforting sound like a personal rebuke.
But even so, honestly he’d still prefer to go back just thirty minutes ago, before he’d gotten out of his nice comfortable bed that had smelled like him, Steve, bacon and eggs. Because Steve was the sort of guy who made you breakfast the morning after and didn’t even try to make you eat anything green.
It had never been clearer to him how much he wanted this.  Not specifically Steve barefoot and cooking in his kitchen (he wasn’t a Neanderthal) but everything the moment represented. His cold empty penthouse filled with their scent and the smell of rich tomato sauce. Steve’s shit scattered around and mingling with his, his shoes lost somewhere.
"The fire giants are not the fiercest creatures on Múspell." The little tom rebuked with an angry flick of her tail. "The Kǫtrdýr have lived there for ages and we are neither so big nor so heavily scaled."
Loki would never admit it but he was twice as stubborn as Thor, and though Thor loved Loki all the more for it, he feared that it meant it might be very long before the wounds they had inflicted upon each other could heal and the distance between them breached. More years than his Midgardian friends would ever see, but he had faith the day would come (always).
You have got to be kidding me, Tony thought, gritting his teeth as Pepper beamed into the camera at him. At least somebody was still having a good morning.
The scientists been forced to turn their eyes then to creating a combatant to the domesticating serum, which had pretty disastrous (and of course deadly) results for the kits they tried it on.
Still, Tony didn't like to see him looking so hangdog or feel the weight of his guilt hanging over them, especially over the ridiculous idea that he'd somehow been a bad friend. Did Bruce have any idea how much Tony enjoyed having him around? What it had been like rattling around in that tower all by himself after losing Clint to finding out he'd never really had Clint to begin with?
"You see To-" but Tony wasn't in the mood to hear it and slammed a couple of slugs into the guy's chest. It probably wouldn't kill him but it would slow him down.
“Yeah. I’m good, just in the middle of an evolutionary crisis. So, okay. New plan. I need a tiny screwdriver. The tiniest one you can find. Be fast. I’ll be upstairs.”
“Well then.” Tony clapped his hands together decisively with a devilish grin in Steve’s direction. “Lead the way Captain.”
The probability of Tony or Natasha crawling into bed with one of the toms they did trust was high, so Bruce just kept a metaphorically open door policy and was grateful that the other guy seemed fond of Tony.
It was permission for them both to let got. To stop thinking and dwelling in places that hurt and simply feel one another.
"Yeah fantastic," Tony grumbled because if he didn't know any better, he'd think that Loki had just told him he was hallucinating him. But if he was why would he trust the word of his hallucination?
Romanov inclined her head slightly in acknowledgement of his words but apparently had nothing more to say on the subject. Whatever her thoughts on his methods she kept to herself but there was something softer about her when she looked back at him.
“You know, I’d always hoped you and Andre would take a liking to each other. With his build and your beautiful coloring Tony, you’d have made such beautiful kits.” Sonia murmured thoughtfully, as if she’d read the track of his thoughts. There was a hint of dry amusement around her tone as she finished, “But you’d have made a terrible mother. You’re too possessive. I’d sooner try and snatch a pair of cubs from a mother bear than try and separate you from your kits.”
And there, for the tiniest moment Ty met his eyes and they flashed a familiar angry gold as the tom nodded and promised with an air of certainty. "Another time Tony."
Mama gave them a list, because she likes to buy silk directly from Devi because the shops will just mark up the price and Devi always gives them a good deal.
And just as quickly the chamber was gone and he was in a nursery room, breeding-nurses surrounding a young fel woman in the throes of labor. There was blood, and the grim faces of the breeders told a story of too much blood lost.
“Scouts honor.” Tony swore with a chuckle, placing one hand on his chest which was rumbling in a barely discernable purr. He liked that he’d made her laugh. God he needed to get a grip. Bonding instincts or not he still had to put her through the same test as everyone else. Her background checks must have checked out to make it to this point but Ross was not without resources or the means to pressure some family into pressuring their kat into a spy gig.
The message must have been clear because Nick sighed deeply like a confession was being dug up from the recesses of his soul and dragged out of his mouth.
These two weren’t the half-crazed results of twisted genetic tampering and they weren’t militant robots trained from birth to be nothing but killers. Under those masks they were likely as healthy and (arguably) sane as anyone standing in this room.
“Great why don’t you have a seat Peter. Make yourself comfortable. And call me Tony.” Tony suggested nodding to the seat Peter had abandoned. “Did you bring your work sample?”
“Yeah well, that’s mostly because of Mr. Osborne. I’m a kat, my teachers just go easy on me because they’re afraid of losing his money. There’s nothing special about me at all.” Peter lied, setting his jaw stubbornly. Tony snorted, rolling his eyes again and reached inside his suit for his phone.
Worse, the sheepish way that Thor was looking at them all made him certain the answer to Clint’s question was yes.
“I don’t think it’s working Papa. She still looks mad.” Tony whispers, only even smart as he is he hasn't quite managed to to figure out how to make his vocal chords go as quiet as he'd like because Mama definitely hears him.
"Hello Tony." A husky voice whispered in his ear and recognizing the voice Tony went cold, though he forced the tension to ease from his back and shoulders. Plastering on an unbothered expression he turned, sliding just enough to put distance between him and the heat of the larger kat's body, but Tony was rather afraid the smell of the tom was going to cling to his clothing. Ty always had been liberal with his pheromones.
Clint continued to dig around in the refrigerator, oblivious, shrugging his muscled shoulders loosely and muttering, “His loss. Bill really knows what he's doing. The place looks great Tony."
T’Challa had finally figured out a foreign system was communicating with his ship. Truthfully Tony was impressed. His mind might function like a computer but it didn’t leave the same trail behind it – at least if Tony was being careful it didn’t. The fact that he’d noticed at all and had been able to trace it back to him was rather astounding.
As Coulson spoke JARVIS projected images of each of the properties along with the information they’d compiled on the number of employees and other stats.
“No. Extremis is targeting the BX. We can’t take the risk of the serum being destroyed before the fusion has a chance to take.”
This is the beginning. The Furnace. His maker is always here in this room even though the soldier serves new masters. The soldier always returns here, at the start of every mission. It is part of his genesis.
“The renovations on your mother’s house will be finished in a couple of days and if you really want to go back to Pit Stop Tennessee to wait tables, you’re welcome to. If that’s what you want you can sell the condo. It’s a million dollar residence so do me a favor and put that money to good use and move out mom’s house. ” Tony squared with her.
"Tony, you met Aldrich at the party in Switzerland, the same night you met me." Maya went on, fingering the hem of her skirt. "I showed you my research but my formula was still flawed."
', she'd told him. And Tony remembered just the way she'd looked. He remembered now where he'd seen the stone around Luke's neck before. Hers had been larger, but Queen Bastet had worn a stone just like it in the brooch at the end of her collar.
Tony’s memory might be as perfect as pictures but he is still human. Much of how one recalls things are based on associations, and in his beginning, everything was brilliantly (terrifyingly) new. Existence, like reality, had exploded outward in one catastrophic bang.
This really annoying kid Eugene Thompson had groaned and complained that Peter only wanted to go to Stark Industries because he was a Kat. Eugene’s dad said that Tony Stark was overrated, took credit for the ideas of others and thought far too highly of himself. That had made Peter really mad and he and Eugene had gotten into a fight about all the things that Mr. Stark had invented that absolutely nobody could take credit for, and their classmates had jumped in too until even Eugene had reluctantly had to admit that Tony Stark was pretty amazing. For a kat.
Above him was a haze. Through it he thought he glimpsed faces, familiar, and then a light, pale and blue, but he couldn’t concentrate on any of them.
"I have every right." Tony snapped viciously, stepping equally close, hands curled tightly into fists. "Did you forget what we're all doing here Captain? This is the Avengers Pride isn't it? Pretty sure I read the label and it named me Queen."
Fear sent tension tightening up Steve’s back, putting his nerves on edge. The smell of antiseptic burned in his nose. Every beep and click of a machine coming through the speakers rang sharply in his ears.
“And why would I do that?” T’Challa asked slowly, cool and measured. Never an easy read this guy. Tony liked that.
“Same story different day Stark. What’s with you man?” Rhodey prodded. “You need to keep your head in the game. Why are you letting that tired old shit get to you?”
They nuzzle their cheek against brown hair so dark it’s closer to black and settle their chin between the boy’s furry ears and hold on tight, breathing in the scent that tells him this boy is kin.
“It means he looks pale and gross, kind of like a slug.” Harley explained confidently with all the tact of his ten years. Swallowing his mouthful he perked up in his seat looking toward Tony for confirmation. “Is that right?”
“Miss Stark that designation no longer exists,” the ships A.I. reminded her, but the lights on the device flicker on and the console hums beneath her hands as data begins to stream down the screen in front of her. She grinned with elation.
“Not sure you’re getting the point here Steve. They aren’t the same thing. Sir doesn’t care if I’m a good man or not just-” Tony stifled the words as his body shuddered, the first true waves of heat washing through him and scattering his thoughts. Sir? He hadn’t called Howard Sir since the man had died, but heat addled the senses. Made you regress to a gooey pile of primal instincts. Made it impossible to defend yourself when someone wanted to take advantage.
Bruce was behind on his work and had taken the opportunity to stay up late that night, but around the time he started getting seriously irritated at himself for not being able to completely focus he decided to call it quits. Better to not get worked up about something easily fixed by hitting the hay.
"Great, then two things. One:stop calling me Anthony, and you can drop the House Stark bit because it makes me feel like you're about to make me Hand of The Queen or something and if that's your intent, no dice. I like my head attached to my neck."
It's been like that from the beginning. Tony meets Rhodey for the first time down in the city, at the docks.
Tony doubts Ana would stay either if that happened. The thought of losing them both brings tears to his eyes faster than the cream that Jarvis is massaging into his skin.
It might still take a world ending level disaster to get through the wall of numbers and codes surrounding Tony’s brain when he’s in the zone. So Steve doesn’t expect miracles and comes to him instead, sometimes occupying the couch in the corner to handle the heaps of paperwork that comes with Avengering, or to draw in his sketchbook. But usually he coaxes Tony into eating something and coming up for air to indulge in some pedestrian activity. They take lots of walks and though Tony gripes about the cold, and the threat of the paparazzi, they both know he’s enjoying himself.
"Tony, I'm sorry." Bruce finally said, and there was such a gravity to his tone that Tony couldn't pretend not to understand what Bruce was talking about.
"Bruce, if I haven't chased you off for good, you're welcome to come with me. There are only four facilities to infiltrate and I know I'd feel better with you at my back."
“Fair point,” Tony allowed. “But that is why it’s an official meeting within Stark Industries. Pepper will be there along with the hired guns. And the lodge will have all the security I can throw at it. I’m having JARVIS installed up there as we speak. If Killian is stupid enough to attack either me or the lodge in broad daylight with dozens of witnesses he’s welcome to but he won’t get away with it. Besides he has no reason to suspect I suspect him or even know his name beyond his public work.”
“Clint and Thor followed the team headed to the barn. They’ve secured the situation. Natasha’s fine.” Steve assured him, reaching tentatively for Tony’s other arm, presumably to help him walk. Tony stared balefully at his hand, tail arcing in warning until he decided better of it and withdrew. It wasn’t that he didn’t get that Steve was trying to help (because Tony’s body was just about done and any idiot with eyes could see that he could use some help).
Thor had said exactly that during his last visit, while playing keep away from Dummy's pinchers. The seemingly simple comment had sparked an idea in Tony's thoughts, something he was convinced was the key to solving his issues with Extremis.
“Look Tony, a man just blew up in a public shopping center. Fifteen dead, including a mother and her two children, multiple people in critical condition. People don't feel safe, and they need to know that the same rules that apply to them apply to everyone. You can't be special.”
"We need to get evidence that Killian is our guy and put him behind bars before he can kill more innocent people. You're right. I like to handle things on my own, and every time I look at the news, or the footage from the attack, I want to find this guy so bad my teeth hurt. But I can't do that this time. I'm trusting you all to do that for me, and that's hard for me to do. I need you... okay? Pepper and I are a distraction while you guys get the pay dirt, nothing more."
, not free to do any of the things that they could do. How could he sit there and talk about things getting better with any kind of certainty, when he’d barely understood what was happening right under his nose.
The wind kicked up and the ground shook under his boots as he pushed through the fog in their minds. They appeared slowly, one by one, on either side of him and Steve as if they’d formed out of the rapidly churning mist, all of them looking shaken and blinking dazedly as if waking from a dream. A bead of sweat rolled down Tony’s brow and he fought to stay standing as dizziness overwhelmed him, but Steve was there a moment later to hold him up.
“Alright, get to your positions.  On my word we close ranks and box them in.” Steve instructed, and Tony flew up with a kick of thrusters to zipp through an upstairs window at his designated entry point, blasting his way inside with a grin at the sound of the shattering glass. He did love making an entrance.
He was certain it would only respond to the right combination of thought and touch, but he was hoping by closely examining what functioned within the chip when a negative response was triggered, he could figure out the code that would trigger a false positive.
“Did Tony ever show you his dream?” Steve asked and Natasha was still beside him. Steve looked up at her and found pensive green eyes staring back.
"Indeed." Thor agreed with the same beaming grin, and Tony narrowed his eyes at him because there was something suspiciously cheeky about it. Whatever. There would be time enough later to educate Thor on classic board games. Right now he had more than enough on his plate to handle.
"Why was Stark even allowed out on the field?!" Fury decried from his usual seat at the head of the table. "He was a known liability. The last thing the world needs is to watch Tony Stark splatter his guts all over Manhattan!"
“It is expedient when dealing with the KǪTRDÝR to learn to recognize scent signatures to avoid diplomatic incidents. They are very territorial creatures especially when courting. Your body could only react to both toms the same way unless they were in fact the same man.”
“That doesn’t make them bad Peter.” Tony said, seeming to read his mind again and Peter stared up at him with hope. Did he mean that? Or was he just saying it to make Peter feel better about what had happened to him?
And no, before you think it. Usually a kat's "parent" is in no way blood related to them. See when young kits are put up for adoption their owners like to feel good about themselves and the whole messed up institution, so they become proud "parents" rather than slave masters. But that's just Tony's opinion. Don't let him influence you.
"But hey. Positive thinking right? I'm gonna be fine and when it's all over, we're all going to sit down and have another one of these great family talks." Tony squeezed him encouragingly and Bruce chuckled, somewhat thinly.
“Good, Norman Osborne isn’t making radioactive spiders for fun.” Tony drained what was left of the coffee in his mug and set it down with a clunk, closing one door of conversation before he looked back at them both and opened another.
“Great.” Tony clapped his hands, pulling the attention back to the center of the room. “So for the official record and you kids watching at home, what’s about to go down here is called a bond in layman’s terms. In genius, it means Bruce and I are going to establish a permanent psychic link between our brains.”
He injected himself with the strongest suppressant he’d yet to develop and hissed under his breath when he took in a deep drag of air through his nose and thought he could still smell the lingering notes of heat on his skin. So he'd taken a quick peek at the one that was still in production and argued with JARVIS for a few minutes before relenting that it probably wasn't safe to give it a go just yet.
“I think that’s what the liberals forget. I can confidently say that nobody here doubts just how valuable Gata are. We may disagree on methodology but we all want the same thing. Strong, happy healthy Gata.”
“Get the girl!” Ivan snapped, burst into action, trusting the twins would heed his command. He rushed Stark, taking the kat by surprise.
At Bruce's nod the tight knot of tension coiled in Natasha's chest began to release. It still wasn't ideal but at least one of them would be there with Tony if something went wrong, and perhaps even more pressingly (given the bright flush in Tony's cheeks) it was good he'd have a tom he trusted nearby.
The com line crackles, not with interference (Tony’s tech is too good for that) but with the telltale whine of repulsors loading, and Clint’s gut tightened again.
Okay, that wasn’t his name but whatever. Tony shifted with the intention of untangling his hand from the ruined repulsor and take better stock of his injuries, stiffening in alarm (and okay a healthy dose of indignation) as a gloved hand pressed against his chest in unspoken demand for stillness, a strange chittering sound emitting from the masked man. Catman began delicately stripping away the mess of melted wires and metal, murmuring, “Forgive me Ayeba, but you are in pain and I fear what will happen if we do not settle your heartrate.”
Jena, bristled at the clipped tone and bit the edge of one pale lip nervously. Tony sort of felt bad about it until, crossing her arms over her jacket, the woman halted to turn to him and say, “I’m a waitress Mr. Stark not a child. I’m a single mother. A college drop out. A social outcast. Do you think Harley or I ever dreamed we could live in a place like this? Or that someone would offer to pay his exam fees? I did the best I could, homeschooling him. He’s so intelligent… but I never would have been able to pay the fees for those tests. If he can go to school he’ll have a much better life than I ever could have given him. Don’t think I don’t know that. I may just be an overprotective mom but I can’t figure out why you’re doing any of this.”
And then because JARVIS knew Tony better than that, he continued, "Armor integrity levels currently reside at sixty percent, however there is a some sort of magnetic interference. I believe it is a result of the hit from the energy beam. You may be in some trouble."
That's the cost of forward momentum. Everybody blamed him but Natasha knew better. The death that followed Stark was just a consequence of nature. Matter destabilizes. Everything breaks down. You can't go forward without loss and for better or for worse, Stark meant future.
It was the video sample from the single interview the Wakandain king had given after the country had been discovered. The one where he'd basically told the U.N. to fuck off and leave them alone. Although it had been over a decade since then Tony seriously doubted the King of Wakanda had graduated to dressing up in costume and following the Avengers around New York for the hell of it.
Tony didn’t get urges for home cooked meals. In fact, Bruce had quickly figured out that when deep in a new project (and when wasn’t Tony diving into something new) that Tony seemed to forget he had a physical body at all.
There. Tony blinked, gaze focusing on his teammates once more as he pointed to the now frozen image of the two girls walking, just before the kat lands in front of them. The two women are walking arm and arm, heads bent close together. It’s only when the footage is zoomed in and paused that someone might catch the strange glazed expression on the human woman’s face, or the faint reddish light around the second woman’s fingers as they tickle her companions ear.
Next up, Tony's surgery chapter! Clint and Tony deal with the past. Steve and T'Challa have a little peace talk of their own. And dare I say it? A wild Bucky (finally) appears.
He needed to win. That was the only way to protect other gata and protect the future he was trying to give them. And if he was going to win against these guys, he needed to be in his lab, creating tools to defeat them, not losing his head and tearing off on a suicide run.
“Hey Moltres! Nobody likes a sore loser,” Tony jeered, firing at the thing more certain of distracting it then he actually was of damaging it because up close he could see that it’s feathers had a strange scaly sheen which in their line of work usually didn’t mean soft and easily destructible.
"Do you have any idea how many calls I've fielded today because of this mess you've created?" Fury demanded and Tony bristled.
"Would we call this checkmate?" Helen whispered in amusement to Bruce, loud enough for them all to hear.
But here in his memories the sun is beating down bright and the water is blue as anything as he runs towards the edge of the low cliff side.
But fast and deadly as she was Natasha was also severely outnumbered, so Tony shook off the stupor and began struggling at his bonds anew. He was stronger than the average human but the metal restraints seemed to have been made with gata in mind because they didn't so much as budge.
Natasha’s hand had somehow crept up Tony’s pant leg and her vicious little claws were digging into his ankle.
That was pretty ingenious, Natasha had to admit. But Tony's brilliance, when it came to matters of code and mechanical parts, had never been in doubt. She'd marveled at few things in her life, but she could honestly say that there in that moment, Tony made her stop and wonder at his design.
“Tony.” That low modulated voice came through the mouthpiece of Catman’s mask (helmet?) in soft but firm demand, accompanied by a low rumbling purr that Tony realized he should find alarming but his senses weren’t in on that bit of intel. He wanted to close his eyes and sink into that sound. All the more reason he should be fighting right?
Even without a building map it was fairly easy for Natasha to navigate her way around. The facility was mostly deserted and they'd only bothered to light the areas where stations for lab work and other necessary functions had been set up.
"No. It's a Greek myth. A Midgardian-" Tony began to explain, only to give up partway through with a deep sigh of aggravation. "You know what. Just forget it. The Greeks ruined everything."
“Do any of us know what Prince T’Challa’s interests actually are?” he returned with a dark glance in the prince’s direction before his attention was stolen from the woman across from him, a Mrs. Fujikawa (a wealthy widow who was attending the dinner with her prized kitten) who leaned forward in her chair to interrupt their whispered conversation with a knowing look.
It paired nicely with Tony's heavier smell and Bruce knew that this close to heat how having another fel around could be comforting. Not in the same way as making contact with a tom, but pleasant none the less.
They'd had to leave the city in order to find a place to land their ship where they wouldn't be noticed, and Jaime had come up with the idea of going to the cabin. It was a good idea. It was all Stark land up in those woods, and Nyota remembered it well from her visits there as a child, before the incursions and the President of the United States had fallen out with her dad because Tony had been unwilling to sell him a weapon. The ultimate weapon: the planet destroyer.
Though the floor Tony had given Bruce came outfitted with all the essential living spaces he rarely did more than sleep there.
Steve was sitting in the armchair nearest the Christmas tree, what looked like a sketchpad open on his lap, a thin pencil slowly scratching across the paper as he stared down at his work with the look of someone lost in their minds eye.
“We’re losing her.” One of the nurses murmurs sadly, as if it is inevitable. “Happens a lot when you breed them young.”
“Gee whiz Cap, you’re so big and strong.” Tony giggled, burring his nose against the jacket of Steve’s tux, dragging in his soothing scent. “You know I dreamed about this sort of thing when I was a kid?”
"I assure you that the Bifröst is quite safe. And my mother tells me that Bastet is to be in attendance. She is the mother of your line Tony and a Queen like you. She will know much that may benefit your efforts here to form a Pride as well as your research."
So in all those little stories Thor had told them about the Kǫtrdýr, he had totally neglected to mention how short they were. Every time he’d shared anything about them he’d thrown the word mighty around enough to give Tony the impression that they must be similarly built to Asgardians, perhaps with more fur, but generally all around huge and intimidating.
The pain swells and Tony hears screaming, tastes bile and blood in his mouth. His head is a consuming storm of memories that rather than distract from the pain only seem to add to it.
Right, the dinner with the ambassador from Wakanda was scheduled this evening. The headliners had talked of nothing else but the history making event all week. Steve’s smooch with Tony in the park was old news (thankfully) in the wake of the news that foreign royalty from a mysterious and dangerous country would be stepping on American soil.
Almost a year later, and he had come to realize that Tony wasn't anybody but himself, which probably made him the best and the worst of both his parents and more besides.
Tony could see it all as Bruce remembered it: the lights flashing, the way that he Helen, and T’Challa had scrambled to keep up with the virus (keep it from killing him), the way they’d scrambled to keep him from killing his teammates as they dropped one by one, convulsed in violent seizures.
She was wearing the uniform that allowed her to move with her tail out even though normally she liked to work tucked (one less appendage for an enemy to grab) because when it came to climbing the tail really did help, and she was confident enough in her ability to get in and out of the facility without being seen that she opted for the luxury over comfort.
Whatever comeback Tony would have made was not to be, for at that moment the horn sounded, signaling that the hunt was about to begin.
“Are you okay Tony?” Harley’s worried eyes looked up at him as the kit laid a hand tentatively against his side.
"What, are you saying you don't think it will work?" Tony asked in confusion and not a little bit of indignation and Luke chuckled, shaking his head again.
Nyota gasped as the view changed to a hand-held camera on a red carpet somewhere as reporters shouted out questions, and there he was. She knew it was her dad. She just did, even if he looked different. He was younger than she’d ever seen him, and he wasn’t wearing the armguards her Papa had given him but it was him. She knew it.
Okay we should probably get a few things straight before we go on because terminology is important, and even if Tony hates the derogatory shit that is mainstream today, it is what is and you should probably get familiar. So here we go.
"Your principles Hughard are going to be the death of you. I think I'll bring you boys lunch today, and give poor Ana a break." He hears Mama say and it's only then that Tony realizes Hughard must be talking about him. It's him he's bringing to the yard. Tony's heart leaps in his chest.
He looked at her with glazed eyes and Natasha didn’t think he could see her through the haze of pain, but something in him must have known she was there because she felt his mind reaching for hers.
They'd almost given up hope, until Barnes and Rogers happened. A kid and his kitty, or if Howard's version of events are to be believed, a kitty and his kid.
There are years of pageant shows and plastic smiles, performing tricks for Howard’s friends and associates because even a failed experiment has some use.
“It’s my understanding that friendship requires trust.” Back straight, ears erect and not a stitch of submission in sight, Tony’s smile was pleasant as peach pie for the cameras but his eyes told another story. “Hopefully that’s something we can build between our countries.”
Because the last thing he wanted to do in front of Captain America was have another fucking panic attack. Thanks but no thanks.
“It’s connected to OSCORP somehow. His sires were scientists, both belonged to OSCORP. When they died in a plane crash Peter was entrusted to his aunt and uncle but OSCORP still holds the right of ownership.”
Obadiah, like always, seems to know the question at the top of his mind without Tony needing to ask.
The telepad hummed and Riri appeared in the center of a swirl of wholly unnecessary lights and spinning molecules. Dad had borrowed the sound effects straight from Star Trek because he was a giant nerd.
Bruce was coming to think being pride meant they all needed to find something in each other. Why else would the pull be so specific? Why these particular people?
He fired and the phantom dived into the mist, but the wind was blowing such that a few heartbeats was all it took to clear as if it had never been, and then they could all see it: a large shape descending from above, eagle-like talons outstretched with wings spread wide.
"Shut up Stark. We all know you have JARVIS remind you a few days before or else you'd forget you even had heats. And you know you wouldn't enjoy DUMMY assisting you half as much as one of us."
Tony laughed, as if he could read all of Peter’s whirlwind thoughts and put a hand on his shoulder again.
screaming trough him as Steve’s breath hitched and he pulled back in shock, just enough to peer down at Tony with wide blue eyes.
“Steve you said it yourself, you were in his head and he felt you there. That’s not a dream, that’s a bond at work.” Tony refuted, and Steve’s eyes widened momentarily as he took that in, working his jaw as he thought it through, but after a moment he was shaking his head again stubbornly, snapping.
It had been kind of morbid, but comforting in its own way, eating together as a team knowing that afterwards they would all take the elevator down to Bruce’s lab where Helen would hook them up to the machines that would monitor them while they attempted to form the bond.
Last night is a familiar sort of hazy that usually makes his skin crawl with unease, the loss of memories to sweat and sensation leaving too many dark areas for old demons to lurk, the sharply detailed flashes that he can remember embarrassingly carnal and a painful reminder of his weaknesses; but last night with Steve was different, and it’s the difference between falling apart and letting go.
“Hey so, I’ve got another couple of rounds of interviews this afternoon including the spider kid, but I was serious about dinner. We could both use a night off.”
They've been around for centuries but they're less than five percent of the population still. Most people don't call them by the politically approved name (Gata) and go straight to pop culture. On the whole Kats are popular possessions for most domestic households though to properly care for them it does take a bit of dough, so primarily they are possessed by the upper middle class and the elite.
Bruce ignored it as best he could, breathing in and out, letting the anger simmer quietly in the background.
"I had it guys," Tony grit out as soon as the petulant tom was out of earshot and he tried not to think of it as pouting when Clint slung his arm over Tony's shoulder and he continued to scowl. "No seriously. Hello. Iron Man. Feral kat. I can handle myself."
If you’re an outright stalker (or just unfortunate enough to have been born in the quaintest most bygone area of the great state of Georgia you can imagine) then you know the truth.
Broken. Needs to focus on the mission before the wrong people catch on. He and his charges are on this mission ‘solo’ but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other eyes around. Hydra has eyes everywhere, and if they catch on to the fact that Ivan has a screw loose in his head and his thoughts are spinning out of joint like an over worked machine, then they will take him out of the field. They’ll wipe him, and he’ll lose the man slowly coming together in the mirror. Worse. He’ll lose Wanda and Pietro, just like he lost
Ivan jerked with a start, slamming back into reality as if he’d been dropped into his body from a great height. Somewhere between falling and opening his eyes, Ivan changed.
Those were the tactical reasons for giving him warmth. There were others, and they were all tied to seeing him chained up and at the mercy of that mad man. If those who had trained her could only see her now.
They’re fifteen. There are ropes around their legs. A larger body is pressed down against theirs and they’re choking on tears and rage because they Do Not Want THIS – but their body has betrayed them, their mind a haze of twisted impulses and cravings that defy all reason. It’s not long before the others realize the well has run dry, that they took a chemical torch to it in a fit of defiance (a knife to their own flesh) because they’’ll always burn the field before they let it succor their enemies. They are struck over and over, so they curl into a defensive ball and wait for the storm to pass, the devils screeching in their ear.
Tony had been able to create the worlds first true artificial Intelligence because he'd never been afraid of the code, of finding out that there was nothing at the bottom of the well but numbers and more numbers. Why fear it? It wasn't like boiling things down to the math made them less powerful, strange or beautiful.It's not like it stripped them of mystery, because god knew compared to even the most advanced computer system human bodies were still a universe barely tapped into.
There was something niggling at the back of her consciousness, an insistent warning bell ringing long and thin under each breath that had her itching to reach for her communicator and check on her teammates, certain that something somewhere had gone wrong.
“Of impaired judgment.” The tom admitted softly. “Of making a mistake that would come back to harm my people. I am unfamiliar with being unable to trust my own judgment and I can only apologize for any wounds you have suffered as a result.”
“Yes.” Her voice rasped and she swallowed before going on. “I got older. He came back. He was different but still the same. Under their conditioning, he was still Ivan inside, and that gave me false hope. Hope that maybe it didn’t matter so much what my body or my hands did, that inside maybe I was still someone worth saving. They’d sterilized the other girls, but they’d left me alone. They were afraid I’d stop having heats and they saw the heats as an advantage. I wasn’t careful enough. I got pregnant, and I knew I couldn’t let them have my child. Ivan and I planned to escape together, proving just how stupid I was.”
"Stark hardly looked fragile to me. Some are saying his actions may have aggravated the strange condition that led to the unidentified woman's death. What do you say to them?"
He'd spent eight months building that cover before it had finally paid off in the form of a prized apprenticeship at Stark Industries. Maria's House prioritized teaching all willing residents a form of trade and finding them job placements with trusted handlers when they were ready to reenter the world.
Tony wanted to help them. Wanda too, and Bucky and the speedy one they didn’t know the name of. They were victims of the same system that chewed up Gata and spat them back out every day, and it was not their fault that they’d drawn the short straw in the pack of shit straws. Tony had suffered. He’d been experimented on, but he’d never been forced to choose between stealing or starving like some, or to kill for others unless be killed himself.
Because Tony’s eager nose could smell it was right. Black, two dollops of the good cream and no sugar.
But reality had intruded on their little love nest in the form of their worried teammates who were all up and about, and finding reasons to linger on the common floor in wait for Tony and Steve to emerge from the penthouse.  After a while the constant tug of worry in the back of Tony’s mind had become too distracting.
"Mr. Debar is apprenticing under Dr. Debar." Phil explained with a slightly apologetic turn to his expression. "His uncle."
“How could our friend Ty or any tom hope to win the heart of someone like you, when he had no teeth? No way to fight for you? No way to fight for your progeny? It’s a crime Tony. You come from a beautiful masterful people, but you’re all broken.”
A stream of binary code flowed across Tony’s vision, Extremis lighting his eyes the eerie vibrant blue that gave Pepper the heebie-jeebies and usually sent the interns scuttling away in fear. He fondled the little metal disk, analyzing the numbers over and over as he tried to access the technology inside only to be firmly rebuffed.
He stuffed another spoonful of yogurt into his mouth, chewed and then licked the creamy residue from his lips with a dainty flick of the tongue just to make his point, before he gestured at the medic with his spoon.
to think about all the time, it gets real cluttered up there. Do you ever have that problem? I suppose you don't, but trust me it's a nightmare. Somebody should invent something that does all the remembering and the sorting for you – hey!"
When they’d parted and Steve had pulled himself together enough to depart with a promise to see him later, Tony still couldn’t stop purring. There might even have been an honest to god bounce in his step as he turned back to his work.
They are the only surviving test subjects to come out of Castle Black. They have both successfully been crossed with mutant genes, but Wanda has powers of the mind that go beyond anyone’s ability to fathom. Her potential is devastating. The world should be very afraid.
“Natasha, six o’clock!” Bruce warned as the leopard spotted Dora Milaje that T’Challa had called Nakia landed on the bridge behind her, a gleaming ivory hilt - of what Steve had already discovered for himself (most unfortunately) was some sort of energy blade - clamped between her teeth.
do I gotta?” Tony grumbled and T’Challa’s eyes narrowed on him in a way that made his breath hitch and every muscle in his body freeze like a deer in headlights. The slow heated appraisal he gave Tony just wasn’t decent or right for when Tony was in a backless hospital gown probably looking like death gone cold and reheated; but there it was, that look, all sexy and dangerous just like the man it belonged to.
“Coulson.” Clint looked up, curious as Steve approached their handler with his brow heavily creased, a pensive line to his mouth. “What are the odds that someone would target this shelter when Tony’s compromised, just out of coincidence?”
"Dyson's crew finally has their act together. There was some bitching about a kat being put in charge but Bill kept a cool head. " Clint reported with an easy smile, making a beeline for the fridge. "He's good people. How on earth did you manage to buy him away from Harper and Jung?"
But the real cherry on top (like he hadn't been given enough shit to deal with) and the one thing that spoiled all of Howard's grand plans for him, was the fact that Tony's a queen.
Great so they were stuck in here with a homeless kid, who’d likely been scared out of his wits when two strangers barged into his hidey hole and spent the night throwing up and ripping machinery out of their bodies. He was surprised the kid hadn’t tried to make a run for it as soon as they passed out. Then again, Natasha had done a good job barricading the door. He’d probably been too afraid of waking them to risk trying to move it.
And then there’s someone else, another mind, and he’s falling into it, or taking it in, and he can’t tell which but it doesn’t matter.
He'd be sitting listening to whatever rambling conversation was going on around him, usually about shit he didn't understand or couldn't see because the person talking to him was zoning out, and he'd be trying to count all the hair on their head or something (because wasn't it amazing how many there were?) and the next he'd be on a beach somewhere with six playboy kittens because those girls were awesome and they knew how to ask before grabbing, and they loved cuddles as much as he did. Serena liked to play with his ears.
Uncle Steve had been against it, which meant Uncle Bucky had also been against it. She knew in the back of her mind that she wasn’t being completely fair to her uncles, that you could love someone and still find yourself standing on opposite sides of a no win scenario; but considering what those lines had cost her and her Pride, Nyota didn’t care to be fair anymore.
"Every last inch." he replied with a snap to his tone. "It's still in beta phase right now, cause when Thor said wedding I wasn't expecting to have to fight off a dragon, but I'd still bet it against anything you've got."
“Which I was very grateful for, considering my life’s work had just gone down the drain. When I left AIM I thought I took everything with me, and I didn’t think Killian was reckless enough to try and continue without me.” Maya looked at Tony. “But when I saw you fighting that woman on the news I recognized her symptoms. They match the test subjects who failed. All of them eventually self-destructed the same way.”
"I admit to some curiosity about that." Tony allowed with a shrug, though the tom couldn't see him either. "Sorry to disappoint you Catguy. They were very nice arms, but I have this rule about not jumping into bed with undercover operatives. Especially ones from foreign governments."
“Tony! How’s that drop looking?” he panted into his comm link, gritting his teeth in frustration. Above him he heard the quiet clinking that meant T’Challa was back in the rafters again, watching and smirking down at him.
"That's good to hear." Steve murmured, turning to slide his arms around Tony's waist. They weren't the only ones dancing to the slow trickling music coming from the band. To Steve’s wonder Nakia and Natasha had taken up a dance, and though the other guests were giving them a wide berth they were impossible not to watch. The she-tom and the fel appeared to be trying to out do each other and the intensity of their private little competition was practically electric in the air. Maybe the most striking thing about it was how wild they both looked. Both of them exhibiting grace and power with every movement they made, sweat glistening off of the columns of their throats, no collars or tags in sight and no apologies for it.
"When I agreed to align myself with the Avengers Pride it was with the understanding that Mr. Stark had been named Queen. I was also given to understand that as he has no mate, you were appointed Captain until such a time as your title is made permanent by a mating bond.
“This is kind of amazing,” Bruce murmured, aloud. He blinked in surprise, seeming to feel the way all eyes turned to stare at him incredulously and shrugged. “From all appearances, we have at least two feral adolescents displaying high levels of reasoning, teamwork, and competency with none of the physical or mental trauma we normally see in Gata who have gone through some sort of ReAgression training.”
“Well if we're hunting baby dragons I'm not going out there trussed up like an idiot. I’m good with just this.” Clint grumbled, shrugging out of the armored plates and letting them clatter to the ground. RaTu watched him curiously as he reached for the bow he’d set on the long table beside him.
He's nine when his father hires a man named Jacob Yinsen to teach him and warns him that if he runs this one off he'll give Tony a whipping that will put Vonkov to shame.
Well quiet wasn’t the best word. In reality, laboratories could be fairly noisy places. The beeps and whistles of various equipment running various programs notwithstanding, there was usually the clacking of keys, the occasional rustle of pages and the low murmur of human voices (many of them engaged in intense conversations with themselves as they muttered over their work).
“Does that hurt?” She asked, putting pressure on his wrist, forcing his arm back toward his knee. Even wounded Steve was capable of resisting that pressure but they both knew that wasn’t the point so he allowed it.
“Does she know you don’t like your ears rubbed?” Natasha asked, allowing a hint of amusement to show through her expression.
Tony had asked back in Fury’s office why Steve had joined the initiative, and the truth was more selfish than Steve was comfortable with sometimes.
“Are you ready?” Tony asked, gently placing his hands on either side of Steve’s skull. He was trembling, but his voice was steady, and Steve was staring steadily back at him with so much trust. Tony had the wild urge to run. Abort mission. You’ll only fuck it up. But he couldn’t run. He knew that. No more running away from his problems.
Unfortunately, the soldier is not inclined to answer. Tony realizes too late that the question was distraction. He misses any tell that might have been there before the soldier twists, out of the line of fire as electricity pushed from Tony’s hands strikes the place where he had once rested. He’s on his feet inhumanly fast, and is bearing down on Tony a second later with two knives in hand.
Green and yellow eyes watched Tony from behind a fan of long thick dark lashes, a smirk tilting the lips of the tom they belonged to. The toms scent was strong and itched heavily in Tony’s nose. It was cologne, probably something named ‘wild’ with a panther on the bottle, trying to mimic the fresh and powerful scent of a feral kat and mask the bitter scent notes that always accompanied the domesticated.
He was worried, but she knew he'd get them to the barn. Becuase Tony wasn't going to die alone and gutted in the snow any more than she was. That wasn't who he was.
I CAN NOT SPEAK FOR YOUR CAPTAIN. BUT I MUST REMIND YOU, FOR BOTH YOUR SAKES, THAT IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS LOVE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. BEFORE YOU THERE WAS ANOTHER QUEEN AND THAT HAS REAL COMPLICATIONS.
Here’s the thing. Peter totally hadn’t applied to Tony Stark’s internship program. Not because it wouldn’t be the most amazing thing to ever happen to him, but because he knew Master Osborne would never allow it. He was nice to Peter but Tony Stark was his biggest competitor and Master Osborn had been talking for years about when Peter was old enough to start working at the lab and take over his father’s job. Master Osborne had been so good to pay for his school and Uncle Ben’s funeral expenses, and the leftover mortgage on their house. How could Peter insult him by asking to go work for Mr. Stark?
Wrong. Tony thought. Hadn’t he told Steve once that if there was a way to cut the wire he’d find it?
Tony barked a laugh, cheeks flushing pink and heart picking up pace in his chest. By god was that humiliating. Not because of the
Oh god. Tony groaned, rolling his eyes heavenward. He was catching feelings again. If he wasn’t careful he’d find himself buying the kid clothes and decorating a room for him within the tower. Harley would get jealous. Maybe he should schedule a ‘just because we’ve decided to adopt a spiderbaby doesn’t mean mom and dad love you any less’ talk for their future.
There may have been an alarming incident the first week when Fury had showed up to yell at him for experimental at home medical procedures, and he’d thought rather vehemently that the man should go jump off a bridge, and to everyone’s astonishment the guy had stopped mid rant and tried to jump out a window. Oops.
Still, it was miserable going through heat alone and the world was full of masters who would pay good money to stud out their toms. This time around, when his heat had been coming on and Marilyn had gotten a good whiff of him, it hadn’t surprised him a bit when Mr. Allen came knocking on their door offering a stud price.  It wasn’t as much as some fancy kitten with a pedigree would probably pull in, but it was more money than they’d seen in a while.
They don’t tell you upfront, what it does to you when the boss says ‘go to this address and teach so and so a lesson’. There’s no instruction manual for living with yourself when you’ve got to put some guy’s family in the river because he owed the wrong people.
He likes to invent things because he’s all about forward motion. Into the future, onto the next discovery. Perhaps he’s hoping to discover the cure for all the heartache (all the bumps and bruises) he has compiled along the way.
“Thank you for agreeing to come.” T’Challa murmured, ending the not uncomfortable silence. They both seemed to have a lot on their minds. “And for agreeing on a fresh start. It means a great deal to me.”
There were quite a few leashes on display that night. Far more than Steve had expected considering who their guest of honor was. He’d thought that the brass would scramble together to try and hide their sins but in a way this made sense too, that they would all show up in their best clothes to show off their prized possessions. They were making a statement of their own, in response to the one that T’Challa had made earlier that afternoon.
“When did you start giving the orders?” he teased, even though they both knew he’d already accepted the plan because it was solid.
“Sounds a lot like his creator.” Bruce mumbled distractedly, already back to concentrating on his work.
“Oh.” Peter wilted like the poor flowers of Tony’s imagination. “I just… I didn’t want you to get hurt.”
“Is the get around in there?” Tony asked, “Because I’m in a dangerous line of work and that’s not changing.”
Bruce stared at him for a long moment and Tony felt like the toms eyes were trying to see through his skin. Just when Tony had decided he couldn't take it anymore and opened his mouth to divert Bruce's attention to some other shiny problem, like his inability to be on time for his own meeting, Bruce drew himself up like he was gearing to confess something profound and Tony kind of wanted to jump out the window.
But there are other memories that sober just as well, that don't leave him shaking and heaving with the need to be sick. These memories are rich with scents: roses in the garden, lye soap and shoe polish, flour, soil and bubbling bone broth.
Like how dare Tony think of doing anything without their support! Jesus could this guy get any more self righteous. Had Tony had a team when his old man was trying to turn him into some sort of super tom (into Steve)? Had Tony had a team when Howard was bargaining his unborn kits to his business rival and threatening to make Tony's life hell if he didn't comply? Had Tony had a team when he was in that cave in Afghanistan? No. He'd survived all of that on his own thank you very much why the hell should he cry for help just because his dick of an ex was back in town?!
Clint had admitted he wanted it and before he could blink Fury was all like “Barton, you’re going under cover” and the giant shit storm that was the Stark Job had begun.
Howard’s funeral will be the event of the year. Their mother will be buried on a small plot of land in the section of the cemetery set aside for treasured friends, right next to some senator’s trusty wolfhound. It’s better, they suppose than feeding her body to the flames among a pile of nameless others and turning her to ash, as happens with most of their kind. At least the old bastard gave her this one small dignity.
Clint said through the comm, seconds after Steve raised his shield just in time for an arrow to thud against it. Clint had already scored a dozen hits on him. A few more and JARVIS would declare his status critical. Steve wasn’t too upset with the outcome, the course was designed with Clint’s skillset in mind and if their current pace held true the archer would actually shave a minute off his standing win time.
Catman had touched them down in the middle of the throng of SHIELD agents in the midst of arresting A.I.M agents and helping with the clean up effort currently being conducted by local police and the Red Cross.
Her courage was extraordinary, Tony thought not for the first time. It would have been a big deal for any kid in their twenties to face off with a woman like Sonia, but for a domesticated kat who had to fight against a lifetime of conditioning and damaged fight or flight responses to boot, Tony was daily in awe of her. And not just her. It was all of the interns in their different ways. Peter and Harley, Mika and Kamala.  Young men and women who had defied all odds to pursue their dreams and succeed where the world told them they had no business.
He and Natasha worked like a dream together and after some pretty heavy shit started threatening the planet and talking to a bunch of experts, Fury realized he had a good trick going with them. If he and Natasha had sparked the beginnings of a bond, it was possible that they could bond with other ferals like themselves and form a complete pride, which given their performance record everyone could only agree would be bad ass.
"Er... So, why hunt them then?" Clint asked what was on all their minds and MiKall's gay laughter returned.
“New plan.” Tony rasped aloud, clutching his chest for a moment more until the pain had eased to something manageable. He gestured for Harley to come and the kit scampered closer wordlessly. “Get upstairs. Lock yourself in your mothers room and don’t come out until I tell you to. Got it?”
He settles in the dark of his room and lets the dust fly, catching moonlight in the recesses of his mind.
“I didn’t know what that meant but I looked it up on the tablet you gave me, and it means sometimes that his values create contradictions. Like why is it okay to swear at home but not on the comm lines? And why does he still let women and fels walk through a door first when he almost punched that guy outside Planned Parenthood? Well I figured it out!”
In which Tony's young pride is tested and his first act of leadership is to do the one thing everyone is advising him not to do. Otherwise known as just another day in the life of Tony Stark. Maybe the last day. So maybe not just another day.
“You know, omnipotent lizard,” Tony was prattling beside her. “Speaks in riddles and tells you just enough to make you fear your imminent doom, but never actually says or does anything that could help you prevent it? Wise dragon.”
It was strange, because on the one hand, they've been teammates for months and living in the same tower, so of course they've all been building towards something easily slapped with the label of friendship and put away on a shelf.
Jena smiled slowly, tucking the deed to the condo into her purse as she stepped into the elevator that would take her back down to her floor.
She looked a lot denser than Tony would have expected for a woman of her size, with solid bone structure. She was angular in a distinctly feline fashion was mostly naked except for the skin-tight armored suit she wore. The scales moved with the suppleness of leather but had a distinctly metallic sheen to them. Tony found himself fascinated by the small delicate looking scales and wondered if she'd let him examine them if he asked pretty please.
Tony hadn’t seen very many pictures of him growing up, most of the surviving images focused on Steve anyway, and the comic book renderings hadn’t been known for their accuracy. The Bucky Tony remembered from the comics he devoured as a boy had been the typical hyper sexualized human fantasy. He’d been this incredibly slender little twink who looked perpetually trapped at fifteen years old, with whiskers and eyelashes for days who ran around in a red and blue catsuit!
promised, so it just looked like she’d have to drag his sorry ass back from the metaphorical grave and make sure that this time around he stood by his god damn word!
Of course Clint was fine with his wing-pack but it was against the rules to use it in game, so this match at least was a draw.
Tony gritted his teeth and shook his head clear of his jumbled tangle of misgivings as Fury finally entered the meeting room. Tony kept his expression level because he’d be damned before he showed Nick how irritated he was with being kept waiting when he’d purposefully arrived late himself to be the one keeping the director waiting.
"I think people need insurance.” Sam explained softly, as if he could sense the turmoil going on inside of Steve. “There was always going to be a control measure, Cap. I'm just glad it's you.  You know I still have your trading cards?"
He asked as he had each time before. The first time she'd had a particularly gruesome nightmare about Ivan the night they'd returned, he'd gone to her room and climbed into bed with her but the next time it happened she'd all but flinched away from him. She'd never admit it, but she'd hated that he was there, seeing how badly shaken she was and that the bond told him everything he'd ever needed to know about how to hurt her.
Tony’s hand stayed raised, posed in wait to tap out the sequence of commands that would open up the files he’d dragged up from the underbelly of SHIELD and all that he’d collected on the Winter Soldier since he’d first realized Steve and Natasha’s inexplicable connection to him and the pieces of the puzzle had begun to rattle inside of his mind. Natasha watched, her eyes fixated on the unassuming holographic file.
it, but the names won't materialize inside his mind. These are memories that belong to someone else. Not Ivan. Not the soldier. But
But on that score, Tony had been doomed from the beginning because that first round of tests had revealed evidence of Tony’s as yet undesignated secondary gender, his hormone levels singing strongly the tale of an unflowered fel. The end of Howard’s great vision of Tony as some sort of super-tom to act as a replacement for Captain America.
He still remembered his first Christmas with Bucky. Steve's mom couldn't afford a big fancy tree, but the guy down at the lot had taken pity on them and given her one of the duds for a quarter of the price. It had been one of the trees that came off the trucks with twisted trunks and mangled branches.
And Jaime... those other kits, who must have belonged to the rest of the team. Spunky little Nyota had to belong to Bruce and his mystery mate because he was the only other person Tony could think of who would name their daughter after Uhura besides himself. God he'd never be the same after seeing that.
After the disastrous way the team briefing had ended Tony had holed himself up in his lab for the rest of the night. Relying on his previous pattern of behavior Natasha hadn't expected to see him again until after she returned from her mission; when he'd perhaps not be ready to talk, but would feel at least fortified enough to face her in order to pretend as if nothing had happened for as long as she'd allow.
They liked to call him a black cat. America’s favorite, but a black cat none the less. In Steve’s day, the hey day of the domestication drugs, black kats were the thing your mother used to scare you into coming home before it got dark.
"Ho. Ho. Ho. Do we now allow children to participate in the hunt?" Clint crowed in a fair imitation of the toms who'd sneered at them when they'd joined the line-up for selection. "Their fur hasn't even grown in yet. As if being a great hairy bastard means anything."
“A deal is a deal your Highness,” Tony quipped, allowing himself a small smile in return. “The slate is wiped clean and I treated you to a good time. Now you’ve got to tell me what I want to know.”
Security had never been a big part of his life. He’d been born on a breeding farm somewhere in Europe and the kats that were born in places like that were destined for one of two things: the heat houses or the fight rings.
“Amory, the portal!” Riri screams, and their cousin Amory’s fingers fly over the controls of the teleportation device that they and the T’Challa of this earth have been working to repair. If it works the way it should, a portal between here and somewhere else should open up just long enough for the ARK to escape the destruction of this earth. If it doesn’t, then they die.
Whosoever caught the first and successfully brought it back to the waiting couple was given great honor by the Queen and was bestowed splendid gifts by the houses of the losing teams.
long, because most importantly in all of that Peter had applied for an internship at a competing company without Master Osbornes permission.
But for once he bit his tongue, because if it was a choice between Rogers high handedness and rehashing old shit with Ty, he knew which one he'd rather suffer.
He was glad his friends could see it. One day, Thor was determined that they should have it for themselves. It was only right.
“In all those stories our parents told us, do you remember what made things so hard? It wasn’t the war, it was trying to keep the government from taking me. I was the reason dad realized he couldn’t lead the team anymore.”
That had to be the tenth time since they’d sat down that T’Challa had sniffed like that, like he’d caught a wiff of someone’s heinous body odor and couldn’t shake it out of his nose. And considering that they were dining in the heated rooftop garden of one of New York’s most expensive hotels and the only ones present at that, Tony had to ask.
"That? That was me vanquishing our foe, as Thor would put it." Tony responded with a sharp smile that he swore made Steve see red.
But Tony likes to torture himself, so sometimes he goes to his father's rooms pours the mental equivalent of a drink, pulls out those old reels and lets them play on loop just to remind himself what a stupid child he was.
But because Tony’s heat was so close completely overpowering the pheromones he was dishing out was next to impossible. He did his level best, putting on as much of the strongest cologne he owned that he dared without smelling like a teen with his first can of Axe.
“What aren’t you telling me?” Tony asked, proving once again that no matter what his weaknesses he would never be someone to underestimate.  “What do you know?”
Tony bit his lip, emotion welling behind his eyes though they remained stubbornly dry. Steve wanted to smile.
He (Bruce) still worries when this happens, so mindful of the delicate creature in his arms, but in this future (in this dream) he’s not alone with Hulk anymore. The team is together, all of them, and that means even when he can’t find the strength to calm his mind or make his heart slow on his own, the others can help.
Domesticated fels were timid little creatures terrified of saying no to their betters, and toms would be toms and all that.
In which there is a small storm involving Rubber Guys, Glowy Guys, and a whole lot of negative press. Some people actually explode, but Tony would like the record to show that the exploding people are not actually his fault.
It’s more than a command. It’s a creed. An instinct buried so deeply he can feel it in his bones. It is the one directive that carries with it the undeniable ring of truth when all else is stripped away.  He must protect the child.
“I’m sorry I walked out on you.” Steve apologized with an aching heart. “I shouldn’t have left you alone with this.”
Natasha's eyebrows raised as a low rumble began in Tony's chest, the purr escaping him before he could wrench his head away from Clint's very wicked fingers.
Tony had been over all of the footage from the fight in the mall and debriefed with the other members of the team. Clint had heard the male fel she was with call the witchy fel Wanda when she was downed by one of the rebel kits. One of the rebels had been injured and down for the count. Her male companion was being restrained by the last of them. Whatever their aims, the rebels had surrendered easily when Steve and Clint had arrived, with backup following behind. They’d continued to ben cooperative when Steve explained that they were going to be taken into SHIELD custody.
“She’s the one who likes pillows right? Have somebody put together an apology basket. While you’re at it, pencil in a conversation between you and me where I remind you that I’m your boss.”
“The Alurio are an endangered species Tony. There are only five free Prides left in the entire world.” The prince began slowly. “We may have cloaked ourselves from the eyes of the world but that does not mean we have not watched the outside. We have watched our way of life disappear outside of our walls. As a boy I could not help but think it cowardly, that my forbearers sat in their nest of riches and did nothing while the rest of our kind were decimated. As a man I understand the hard choice that was presented to them. Sometimes it is only possible to save a few.
"How! How are you doing this? Release me!" M.O.D.O.K. was screeching as he streaked past, and Tony praying that his lab work would pay off, gathered that hot pulsing energy in the center of his chest and cast it toward his palms.
Tony was full on flushed by the time Happy pulled the car into the garage of the tower. Stupid really. You’d think after dealing with these heat flashes for weeks that he’d know the signs by now, but fuck if Tony could tell how he felt about anything anymore.
He needed help, he knew that. But unless there was a doctor out there who could raise the dead, Steve didn’t know what anybody could do for him.
“I’m not afraid.” They whisper against his skin, pressing kisses, biting with possession. “They can’t stop us.”
Natasha's eyes flashed dangerously under the bright lights and her face somehow looking even stiller, and it was the only way that Tony knew his words had hurt her. Because she was right, he did feel the pull between them, between all of them, and try as he might to keep a level of distance between them in the months since the attack on New York they'd all gotten closer.
“We’ll be moving to the ballroom shortly. I’d give it a half hour or so, a few cocktails. A dance or two so there’s a nice cozy picture of you and Tony dancing on the front page tomorrow that Pepper can turn into gold. I’ll let Pepper know so Happy can be waiting with the car. You alert the others.” She answered with a considering look in Tony’s direction. “He’s got time.”
Darren stared at the circling image of a towering island kingdom with shock, slowly closing his mouth as something frustratingly close to pity crept into his eyes as he searched for a response.
"Hey." Tony's harsh voice broke into the cloud of her thoughts, the older fel shaking her roughly with a violent twist of his back. "Don't fall asleep! I think I see lights."
“Stark’s got the interns in the control room today?” Clint asked as the Tower landing pad grew larger in his view. On the other end of the line Parker paused and a voice in the background that sounded a lot like Harley chirped, “Hey Clint!”
“I’m not expecting it to be easy and the truth is, I’m not all that certain how much time I have before… well before I’m out of time in any event. So I know it may never come to full fruition, but I’m going to give it everything I have left in me, because everything I have isn’t worth a damn thing Darren.
Bucky’s ears weren’t the same orange but Tony could see Jaime in him clear as day, and that had just begged all the questions because Natasha’s Ivan was a tom but Barnes was a fel, and either way a dead man couldn’t sire kits in Tony’s bright new future.
“I never just say things.” T’Challa refuted him with a severely unimpressed chill to his tone, but his gaze softened and so did his tone as he continued. “It is true, we have the ability to take what we need from others at times and the Queen mind can take more than one can imagine; but that is not what happened here. Your friends offered you their strength because it was theirs to offer. And as Doctor Banner has already stated, you took only what you knew they could bear to lose.”
Which Tony understood right away was everything he wasn’t, and by the time that he was old enough to figure out that the bitterness eating up Howard Stark's world was more about his own failings than Tony’s, the damage had already been done.
Tony wobbled on his feet as silence descended once more and his head pounded with headache. Jesus Christ that shit was not fun, and likely to cause Parker some sort of permanent hearing damage if he let it linger on. Steve had the serum, so he’d probably heal up fine from a burst eardrum or too.
Tony barked a disbelieving laugh. This guy. This guy had more nerve than anyone Tony had ever met! And he’s been held captive by terrorists for god sake.
It turns out Rubber Guys aren’t just raiding any old shelter at the ass crack of morning. If they had been, SHIELD would have handled it on their own, because funny looking guys with guns weren’t exactly the sort of threats Fury had in mind when he’d started the Pride initiative.
“Because Queens are second to no one and they do not relinquish the hearts they take.” A chill went down Tony’s spine. T’Challa’s voice was positively grave now. “Not even in death.”
"When you meet a compatible tom your mind begins building links and it changes much, including the chemical composition of your sweat. In essence you begin to smell more like one another. So you see I, as well as every unmated tom in this room, can smell that there is someone in your life. Likely as drawn to you as you are to him."
“You could have killed him.” Steve insisted, stubborn and fierce but eyes still as lost as any child’s and Tony wanted to throw something (preferably at him).
Phil’s phone had beeped rather urgently, instantly pulling Clint from sleep. He hadn’t moved in the dark, knew better than to give away his wakefulness, but his hand had slid toward the slit between the headboard and the wall where his bow rested on the specialized hooks that Tony had installed. Easy reach. Being able to be armed within seconds of waking was one of two reasons for him being able to sleep in a proper bed for once.
He wanted to trust T'Challa, he did, but he wasn't stupid enough to put so much faith in the unproven when innocent gata sitting at home just trying to make the most of their lives were the ones who would pay the price for his misplaced faith.
“The O-gland. I’m sure there are better classes on it now than back in my day, but generally everybody knows it… revs things up.” He blushed again, pushing on with forcefulness as if scolding some invisible party. “A lot of people like to focus on that alone, but it’s good for far more important things like, comfort and affection…” Steve trailed off, seeming to become aware of the blank and increasingly incredulous expressions on his teammates faces.
“How come you’re not dressed Tony?” Pepper asked and in reply Tony reached up and pressed the button on the side of his custom glasses. A pair of metal wings slid out of the nearly invisible slits in the back of his suit jacket while above his head the holographic image of a halo appeared.
Tony’s never been able to just let go like that, to put down the fight and let somebody elses hands take him apart with confidence that he won’t break for good. But last night he did and it was probably glorious if the pleasurable ache left over is anything to go by.
“Yeah, sorry sometimes that happens. Here’s what I need.” Tony raised a hand and began to tick off on his fingers before that despondent expression and the weight of loss could settle over the boy. “Warm blankets, medical tape, gauze, a laptop, a cell phone, a digital watch, a pneumatic actuator from your bazooka there, a map of town, a mirror, a pair of tweezers and the largest tuna-fish sandwich you can make. Can you get me those without getting into trouble?”
A flurry of shouting and rapid footsteps follow and then Tony watches as the woman comes flying out the door and envelopes his mother in the fiercest of hugs. They cling tightly to one another. And Tony watches with wide eyes as his mother begins to cry and laugh all at once as if the two urges are at war with one another.
“But do you trust us?”  Natasha had kept quiet, but Tony looked at her now trying not to flinch at the hard stare she was giving him. “Because it looks like you don’t. You’re ripe with heat. By the smell of you I give it two, maybe three days if you’re lucky before you can’t function, and you want to go off on your own again.”
Tony really should have been more embarrassed by the thought that he’d given two of his teammates a front row seat into his sex life, but he’s just not the cat for that. So to speak.
Stark was meant to be a Queen. What was more, Thor believed that Midgaurd needed the kind of Queen he knew Stark would be; but a perfect man Anthony was not and Thor was not unfamiliar with the hard lessons of humility.
What he really wanted to do was rip the man’s arm off for touching but that was probably the pheromones talking. It was a close thing when Tony’s wide wary eyes flew to him, as if it was Steve he was unsure of (Steve who might take advantage of his vulnerability) and seeing that look on his face felt like a punch to the throat.
It no longer hurt initially using his technopathy and Tony was confident he’d be able to crack the jets shields and download every last thing there was to glean from it and any onboard computing systems before the pain started up. Even the highly-advanced security of the prince’s aircraft wasn’t designed to hold up against something like extremis. Not indefinitely.
He's going to make a good Queen Tony because it takes a mind like that, a will like that, to push a society into greatness and yank it back from the jaws of destruction. A mind that plays the game ten steps ahead, and understands that to win you have to sacrifice. A constitution that can make those sacrifices and keep going (always).
“I mourned Ivan many years ago Tony.” She finally answered. “And if I have to mourn him again, then I won’t do it alone, but with the family I chose.”
“My observations are imprecise with only these images to go off of, but biology is my expertise.” Helen responded with a flicker of a smile. “If I had to guess I would pin them in late adolescence. A male and a female. They’ve been expertly trained but the way they respond to impact suggests their bodies are more used to recreational sport than active combat.”
“King T’Chaka insisted on a private assessment with no one knowledgeable besides myself and Agent Coulson,” Fury answered through gritted teeth and Tony laughed. Perfect. Coulson had known from the gate as well. He might literally have been the last to figure it out. He was over this conversation already. Way over it.
Tony thinks that's that, because Vankov is the teacher and Ana is just a servant and Vankov can discipline however he likes (it’s not like Tony’s parents are there to take an issue) only a few moments later Jarvis is there, telling Vonkov that he has to go and that Tony’s lessons are done for the week.
The fit the Board had thrown was the kind of epic that would likely never be seen again. They’d contested the will in a long drawn out legal battle, but Tony had poured every bit of the money he had into hiring a lawyer crazy enough to take on his case and sharp enough to win.
“You never do small Stark.” Darren reached up to remove his trendy glasses, pinching the edge of his nose as if to stave off a headache and puffed out his cheeks like a chipmunk before releasing a slow heavy breath.
Tony would have laughed but at that moment Clint and their adversaries collided. The two suited villains rounding the corner at top speed only to skid to a stop when they saw Clint waiting at the end of the hall, bow drawn because he was a dramatic asshole.
"I assessed Tony when the alert went out and found him battle fit. I regulated him to aerial support and civilian rescue. I stand by that call. I'm not happy with his choices, but it should be remembered that without him we may not have won that fight, and certainly not with fewer lives lost."
There’s a click and then Tony is gone. Steve jerked, like he might throw his ear link but thankfully nothing went flying, even if he did curse vehemently under his breath. Clint could give him a hard time about it but his guts a little too tight and the moment passes.
Thor had some bullshit reason for knowing that involved Tony and scent signatures of all things, that had Tony gritting his teeth (because fuck that) and remembering with humiliation Queen Bastet saying something very similar.
He couldn’t remember. Why was he so heavy? Why couldn’t he stop fighting toward the surface when he just wanted to close his eyes and let the mist swallow him. What was so damnably important that he couldn’t just put it all down?
” Peter stood up, voice ringing shrilly with excitement in the room as he blinked up at Tony in astonishment. He couldn’t believe it. Did Tony really mean it? Was he really going to let Peter be a part of the Pride? Would it be like the stories his parents had always told him? They’d be one big family who protected each other. They’d protect the city too, because it was theirs. They’d hunt down anything that tried to hurt them or the people who lived there and they’d build incredible things until there was no place like their home in the entire world.
The assholes who think they can break into Maria’s House and not get the full fury of Ironman unleashed upon them, are possibly rethinking that now.
“Nonsense, I’ve slept with you Barton. Kinda insulted over here that you forgot.” Tony had rejoined. Stalled more like, and he didn’t even know why he’d pretended to misunderstand because he knew exactly what they were all getting at.
"One condition?" Steve's face lit up with hope and Tony laughed. "Just let me call Pepper. She'll have kittens if I don't and well... they'd lock us up for scientific study considering."
“This is not good.” Tony muttered under his breath, glancing up to lock eyes with Steve who stared back at him with similar dread.
“I’m so sorry Anthony.” Mrs Sousa says. She squeezes their shoulder. Her fingers are getting brittle with age but the grip is still strong.
Those old pharaohs were wise enough to see that with the strength of the Alurio behind them Egypt could become a neigh unbeatable empire. Which of course it was, for an age or two, but as these things go, it rose and then it fell (to corruption and greed and a bevy of outside influences you can read about elsewhere).
"And while some of us are lucky to land in luxuries lap, I'm sure you'd agree that while suicide rates and wrongful deaths due to mistreatment are still at a staggering high in this country, that finding a solution should be our primary focus?"
"But lets talk about the realities for a moment. The reality is that no matter how carefully we vet these families, it is a leap of faith we take with every placement we make. We have been given no choice but to rely on a system that says we are not the masters of our own lives, or our own bodies. We are told never to ask ourselves how we can rely on the good character of the same people who see no issue in owning us, and when that character fails the law does not protect us.”
"Happy blew up your tank." Tony remembered, pulling his eyes away from Stone who Natasha noticed hadn't looked anywhere else besides Stark since he'd sat down. The tom's air was confident unlike Hansen. The contrite way he held his shoulders and the imploring looks he kept giving Tony were just dressing. He was very sure of himself and his purpose there. It was irritating, but Natasha kept her peace, mindful of the explosive tempers of her teammates.
"Oh, was she trying to spare me?” he scoffed. His gums itched and he had the strong urge to bare his teeth at them both but he resisted. He didn’t actually want to fight them. Not really. He wanted so much better for them all, but they had to deal with this first and he wasn’t happy about it. Not one bit.
"I can't get the past back and that's okay, cause the future gives me a lot of hope." Smiling shyly at him now he squeezed Tony's hands. "I'd like to make a couple of new memories, if you're up for it."
Bruce’s sudden coughing fit wasn’t any more convincing the second time around. T’Challa just smiled at him, all warm and fond like Tony was the most adorable thing since Hello Kitty became a thing.
“The boy must be punished this time. Properly. And no ending punishment early because Shuri batts her eyes at you. They gang up on you and you always fall for it.” Her eyes finally move down to him and they make him hunch his shoulders in shame.
“Your western clothing is too restrictive.” One of the she-toms denounced, her spotted tail swishing. “A hunter’s best and often last weapon is their body. But by all means, continue to be ashamed of yours.”
“Sir,” JARVIS’ voice interrupted his contemplation. Tony perked his ears. “There is an event unfolding in Washington.”
The mall was laid out arena style. Thick marble columns held up the floors, and the shops on each floor surrounded a center court. Steve and the others were still fighting their way through the panicked crowds in the Macey’s on the first floor.
Tony released a shuddering breath, blinking away the threat of tears because she’d thrown herself on the wire. For him. She can’t hide how scared she is or how much she needs him right now. How much she wants him and yet doesn’t want to. It didn’t sting like it once had. He’d seen her now.
it was for?” Clint summarized slowly, almost dangerously and Steve blinked silently a moment before narrowing his eyes.
"He's a genius, and you know I don't say that lightly. He had to be to get this far, and to get snapped up by SHIELD. So the real problem here is personal bias. Despite all logic, the only thing that will make you feel better is if you hear it from some Dr. Round Ears. And while I get that, it's just something you're gonna have to get over."
Tony and yelped as Natasha grabbed him hard, yanking him out of the way as Killian, still struggling furiously with catsuit man nearly slammed into them both.
"On your way to help Clint." Tony interjected forcefully, because he could hear Clint's panting as he struggled to hold his ground in the corner he'd been backed into and screw Cap and his need to control everything but they didn't have time for this shit. "Do it right now!"
“Maybe we’d be better off using our own things?” Steve suggested, adjusting his loose breastplate. “I’m not sure I could throw my shield in this thing.”
“You knocked Tony up. That’s what’s going on.” Clint snapped and Steve paled. “He trusts me and Bruce to keep it together and not use our teeth, but I guess he didn’t know he was sleeping with a rookie.”
Thankfully Catman decided to move, releasing him slowly as he climbed to his feet, offering Tony a hand which he largely ignored.
"It’s alright. You just, took me by surprise...where did you get that?" She asked tentatively, lifting her eyes to his and Tony shook his head.
But there was an unmistakable heaviness coming from her end of the bond, pulling at him like a weight tied to the end of a nylon stocking.  It occurred to Tony that if Bucky really was somehow her Ivan, this was the first time she was seeing him like this. Not just the clean cut and well cared for but
“Landing code, really? Guys it’s me!” Clint whined, buying himself time as he wracked his brains for the code JARVIS had given him when he’d set out. That was the great thing about having Jarvis running the tower and access to all their ships, not having to remember shit like landing codes.
“Princess.” She answered with an exaggerated pout. “It’s what everyone calls me. I hate it but I’m afraid if you tried to call me anything else I wouldn’t know you were talking to me.”
By the time he is three he’s torn the toys all apart and made them better anyway, because toys are for babies.
They got a scare or two when the heartrate monitors started to blare, sending Helen and Dr. Salek into a flurry of motion as they did what they could to steady both heartbeats.
"I was kind of surprised at first that this place is still standing but the more I think about it the more it makes sense." Steve mused and Tony glanced at him curiously. He hadn't really taken Steve for the nightclub kind.
"This was a bad idea." Bruce muttered and Tony could hear him taking deep practiced breaths, fighting for calm.
Tony remembers the few days that follow with a golden sort of bliss. They trickle through his mind like honey, sweet and smooth. The Roman Torpedo is a thing of beauty and he remembers her like his first kiss, sweeter even than his first time.
The tide was turning. The fight for their lives was brewing and money wasn’t going to be enough to stop it this time. Tony couldn’t afford to prioritize his tangled feelings over doing what was best for the people in his care. He’d promised them more than safety. He’d promised them a future.
"Yeah... you're probably right about that last part." Steve huffed a laugh, looking away for a moment. When he turned back to Tony there was a pink flush to the back of his neck and a nervousness to him that was  kind of a lot endearing if Tony were honest.
Stark was a complicated man but a good one, and he was doing a good thing here for all of them. Maybe they wouldn't agree on everything but now he was certain that they truly shared a common goal. Tony wasn’t Bucky, but nobody was ever going to be.
