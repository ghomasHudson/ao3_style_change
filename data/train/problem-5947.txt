“So you think?  Do you think Steve is going to leave me for you? "He smiled." You were just the second-table plate, Sharon, a distraction while I was not here.  Do you want to know why I'm still with Steve?  Because he did everything to make me fall in love, it was he who took me out of the things I failed and yes, he will not be with me all my life, but I assure you that you will not be with him even in your dreams.”
The redhead saw again him Captain and the agent;  she smiled dazzlingly and obsessively.  The blonde just nodded to the girl's words, his face showed no emotion or anything, he's too kind to yell at once to shut up.  Tony moved a little in his place making Steve's attention go to him completely, without thinking: he got up from the sofa saying goodbye to Sharon as kindly as possible and walked up to his boyfriend with a smile.
"Wait, where's Rogers?" He questioned holding his friends, turned to the redhead and raised his eyebrows to get the answer. "Where is my baby, Natasha?"
Tony ignored all the people present, his mind was wandering the other way, in those sincere words "Because that boy, that person, is you." The blonde showed him that character of courage, that strength and nervousness to confess it. He put part of his soul too, why didn’t he react? In those moments you should be feeling bad and just as he told you it would happen. He was an idiot.
Rogers denied smiling openly and without asking permission: he approached the brunette to plant a kiss on his lips. Tony responded a little surprised and threw himself on the older man's legs. The lack of air caused them to separate. Stark looked into his eyes-the prettiest he had ever seen-and smiled tenderly.
"Wait to? No, you're confusing ... "Rogers fell down when he saw who he was talking to, let out a sigh and lowered his eyes. "It's something bad?"
They appreciated that the tense atmosphere between them was not noticed, well, not tense, something like a little confusion or something serious.
The Captain didn’t understand that question with more than he wanted to answer, his mind had been blank, the courage had vanished from a few minutes ago and really, I didn’t expect to tell him, let alone the question of "Why me?" It was easy, but very difficult to explain.
"It's okay, Captain Rogers, I want all your happiness," he says, getting up from his chair. "You deserves it.”
"Anthony?" He heard that delicate and hoarse voice leave the Captain's lips. Looked at him with little emotion and waited for him to continue. "You're good?"
And he kissed him again, letting out all the love of his heart so that Tony felt it and that he didn’t need to feel it because he knew it, he knew that Steve loved him and that all that time he had hidden it from himself. Now he realized.
"It's obvious," Bruce replied. "Love is love and if they feel it, we don’t have to get into their lives."
“I told Fury that none of the Avengers will go to the gala.”informed the blonde with a smile to the Captain. “He said it was fine, anyway SHIELD would not last long in that place.”
Stark grimaced at that question, denied giving him a little push back while still taking his wrists and started walking to leave him on the couch.  The boys left everything they were doing to watch the scene, saw Natasha laugh when Barton took her waist with one hand to keep from falling.  The spy signaled to the Captain not to get up from his place and she went to help the brunette.
"No matter how many times you want to separate, in the end I'll always choose you," he whispered, placing a soft kiss on her forehead. "They do not know anything about us.  They do not know how much I love you and although you do not love me any day, I will continue to love you with the same intensity.”
"Let me talk" he asked. "I'm sorry for acting as if it were not real, but fuck, I like you and this has confirmed me. I don’t know how to express what I feel, even so, since I saw you in Germany ... it was crazy. "
“Love is not sent, Sharon.  And I'm really sorry, really.  You could have been a great friend, but with Tony things were going to be wrong. "He crossed his arms." Someday you'll find someone else.”
"You didn’t tell me you were coming" he ran his hand down Tony's cheek and he closed his eyes at the soft touch. "I would have returned earlier."
“Why are you still with him?  You're going to be alone again, Pepper was the beginning of your misfortunes and your failures, "he pointed at Steve." He will not last you a lifetime and you know that too well.”
She smiled at the sight of Tony and raised her eyebrows mischievously, the millionaire laughed a little and Romanov raised his thumbs in acceptance with discretion. Stark winked, giving him "Thank you" so to speak and not telling anyone in the room.
He explained the scene with Sharon from the night before, was surprised that Anthony understood him so ... well.  His boyfriend was too jealous, which moved by his side, which he pulled away.  It did not bother him, on the contrary, it made him feel good and he knew that he was the only one in his life.  Still smiling, he sat on the edge of the bed and ran his hand through the hair of the child, so soft, so he, so much his.
Thought the blonde from the sofa. I was furious and especially jealous, she wanted to be the one to hug Steve that way and tell him all her love, but Tony was among them. He was everything to him Soldier. What could I do? Maybe trying to separate them would not be such a bad idea.
And Steve to feel the lips of Tony knew he had won everything, that the love of his life accepted him for life, and could not ask for more because he already had everything.
Steve stared at him, he noticed dark and also looked at him, waited for the blonde to say something, but nothing came out of his beautiful lips.
"I have to talk to you," he said, turning to the older man, who nodded and informed Tony that he would be back in a short time. He darkly accepted. Natasha took him to the other side of the bar, noticed that no one could hear and looked at his friend.
He was going to respond with his high ego that always accompanies him even in his dreams, but the exclamations of others silenced him. He looked to the left and found Thor going to him to hug him and lift him off the ground. The blonde did not understand anything when she saw her "friends" hugging the brunette with such joy. Even Natasha received it in the best way and she was not about to hug you or smile a lot or at least that's what Sharon thought.
Rogers smiled a little, calming his inner depression for that, he was trying to get Stark's questions not to come up like thunderbolts and discover him, even so, he did not want to hide it anymore. Since they defeated Loki; He could not contain himself, they won his feelings towards him. Three years of that happened, now he imagined how in love he must be with Tony.
He wanted to love him, he wanted him to hug him always, to kiss him and say "Good morning" in the morning, He wanted to be part of him, but above all he wanted to be the love of his life.
"Mm ..." he raised a confused eyebrow. "Returning to our previous talk, I want to tell you that you should risk it, it's not like you're going to lose your life for that."
"It must have been hard" said the redhead crossing her arms. "Could you finish them? Your patience isn’t the best of all. "
"Where were you?" She asked without more, earning a somewhat confused and at the same time amused look from Tony. "You went out months ago without giving Shield a notice."
"I just realized it" he looked down at his hands. "Sorry, I had to say it or Natasha would bring Sharon."
"Stark, you should go and leave your things to the room," Bruce suggested, avoiding an argument. "Come on."
The chestnut stirred a little, that made the soldier smile.  He had the love of life in front of him, asleep and his deserved.  He did not deny that it was difficult at first to adapt the two to this relationship, but now they are in the chasm.
After several hours of being in the small meeting, everyone danced from one place to another, some were drunk and others just had fun with the follies of Thor and Clint. Several times the archer fell to the ground giving himself strong blows that in the morning would hurt him and the worst thing is that he wouldn’t remember anything. Bruce walked by his side all the time, something that was strange to everyone.
The spy narrowed her eyes to the left, soon a frown appeared on her face and a bad expression on her face.  He turned to look at the millionaire.
Wednesday had Tony stuck in meetings all day, and the team had to go out without Iron Man. The billionaire was not impressed and had tried to whine to Pepper that he really needed to leave, but she fixed him with a “so-help-me-god-you-better-stick-around-if-you-know-what’s-good-for-you” look so he might have cowed slightly with a loud sigh and a pout. This was not fair at all.
He was cut off when Steve kissed him. This happened a lot, usually to get Tony to stop rambling because rambling meant anxiety and anxiety meant a panic attack and…
Not that anyone was around to hear him. He knew he had to figure out something soon because he knew he definitely wouldn’t escape before darkness took over, and he didn’t like the idea of being on some strange island in the dark with no electricity or running water or heat or...anything to do at all. This was a nightmare befitting someone like Tony Stark. Fucking great.
“In case you haven’t noticed, Tony, I don’t know much of anything about you other than the fact that you’re part of the Avengers and probably one of the most amazing piano players I’ve ever seen.”
The soldier sighed, his shoulders slumping. He wanted to see Tony, to have Tony hold him and tell him things would work out in the end, but he couldn’t. He wouldn’t. And he knew Tony would never lie to him like that anyway.
The room was silent, so silent that Steve could pick up everyone’s bated breathing as they waited for Tony to react. Tony’s hands balled into fists, his face unreadable. “Of course,” he muttered. He cleared his throat a little, stretched out his neck. “Three months in a torture facility. I was never sure but…” Tony fidgeted in his chair before standing up so fast that his chair screeched across the floor. “Anything else?”
He pulled his hand away. “There’s ice in the fridge.” He pointed to the small one he kept in here when he didn’t have time to go elsewhere. Steve nodded and grabbed some ice and a towel to hold over Tony’s hand. “I guess we’re friends. And if we are then I’m not going to use you. You’re a person, not a weapon or a toy or a slave.”
Steve’s hands were sliding over Tony’s back and then down to his rear, gripping firmly. Tony will tell anyone until the end of time that what escaped his lips was definitely not a needy whimper, and that it was definitely not what prompted Steve to flip them over so Tony was the one sitting underneath the soldier.
He turned slightly so he could face Steve a bit. When he looked Tony in the eyes, Tony could only stare at how wide Steve’s pupils were blown. His lips were red and he kept biting them to hold in the moans Tony knew he was trying desperately not to make. He leaned over and kissed Steve hard, the hand stroking Steve’s crotch adding a bit more pressure and moving a bit faster.
When Steve said no, Tony had began shouting, arguing himself hoarse as he hurtled accusations off at Steve until Steve had found himself out of his seat, shouting right back at Tony until the other man had thrown his hands up in the air and stormed out of the room with a slam that rattled the bookshelves.
“So are you going to tell me what’s funny or will I need to phone a friend so I can get the answer?”
“You haven’t done much to raise me at all,” he said under his breath, but Howard had heard him anyway, clear as day.
Rhodey and Pepper both sat in stunned silence for a few minutes before Rhodey’s voice cracked through the air, low and menacing. “I think you need to start at the beginning.”
Schmidt was indeed there, in the center of the room surrounded by servers humming and buzzing and lighting up in every direction. He spread his hands wide, a sharp toothed smile spreading over his face, a face badly scarred by grievous burns, the skin a deep pink, almost red hue. “Ah, welcome. I was a bit concerned you would not make it in time for our little date, Captain,” the German man said, voice heavily accented, “Just in time though, to watch as my virus has begun taking over the internal servers all around the building. The secrets these companies hide….wunderbar. And now they are mine.”
“Absolutely.” He had to look away for a moment while thinking to himself. “So, Steve...are we uh...is this something? Are we going to try to be...well an us I guess?”
“Oh relax.” He gave Steve an easy smile. “I’m not going to bite.” He stopped and leered. “Unless you’re interested.”
Bucky, on the other hand, was already schmoozing up to his date who he couldn’t recall hearing the name of and this was exactly why Steve hated double dates. He absentmindedly pulled apart some straw paper in front of him. He was hoping a few drinks would calm his nerves enough that he’d find the courage to talk. In proper, coherent sentences even.
Of course, he also met all sorts of interesting people doing his undercover gig at Iron Man. People adored him in that respect and it had nothing to do with his status as a piano prodigy. No one knew his true identity. Well he took that back. The people in his band knew, but they were sworn to secrecy and he’d come to trust them to keep that secret eventually.
Tony shrugged again and wrapped his tiny arms around Steve’s neck. “Maybe that’s why my dad likes you more than everyone else. You make people feel good about themselves.”
Steve just smiled. “Ah, thanks. I guess.” He moved on from the straw paper to a napkin, twisting the corners between his finger and thumb. “She was...is a swell lady.”
Steve sat down on the floor and held the tiny robot dog in his hands. He grinned when it started barking. He laughed when it started doing tricks. “Tony, this is-this is great! I can’t believe you made this so fast!”
Steve fiddled with the device, twisting it between his fingers. “This is a sonic taser. Hence the ear plugs.”
Steve wasn’t listening though. His eyes were unfocused and he looked like he was in a completely different place.
Steve opened his mouth to ask if the other man was okay but what came out instead was a gruff, “How did you find this place?”
“Not my thing.” He looked up at Steve and shrugged. “I don’t even like the idea of dom/sub in the bedroom.”
“I’ve got money, a phone, a bike...or a car. I think you had a pretty kick ass motorcycle so I have one you can have.”
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand for one more ridiculous, wordless second and then let go, putting his hand back on his side of the car.
It seemed the rest of their group was following suit. Steve watched helplessly as the others tried to leave and felt Peggy’s hand on his shoulder. He smiled at her and she leaned down to kiss his cheek, whispering in his ear. “Now would be a good time for you to talk to him.”
Tony shoved at Steve’s shoulder gently, a smile in his eyes. “You know what? I take it back. You’re a jerk and I hope you have a miserable life.”
Steve glanced up at her and smiled a little. “Good. I mean that he’s happy.” He sighed and then picked up his phone. “I’m going to order the pizza.”
Tony’s spine stiffened and he gently pushed Bruce’s hands away, eyes wide. “You want me to kill Obie?” Any color he may have had in his face drained away.
“I made this cell phone slash tablet with you in mind. It’s nearly indestructible and can not only be used for basic functions like calling people, texting, and taking pictures but can also be programmed to turn on the microwave or coffee maker just to name a few. And that’s just the small stuff. I’ll let you find out the really cool stuff for yourself.”
“People have said much worse to me. It’s not like I couldn’t just make time to come out and do something.”
As it turned out, genies can eat a lot. Steve might have been enjoying the sweet and sour chicken a little too much but the genius thought it was funny. And maybe a little cute. Not that he was going to say that. Besides, Pepper couldn't keep her eyes off him either which was making their conversation more difficult to have.
"Butter and salt from the kitchen. But tell Tony to get it because I don't trust him with the corn." Pausing, Steve tilted his head toward Tony. "He grew up with the finer things in life, and yet corn on the cob excites him almost as much as a cheeseburger."
Wrapping his arms around Tony's, Steve hugged him tightly and drew his lips into a kiss. "Surprise!"
"Nosey is an understatement," Steve mutters under his breath, his lips curving upward as he glances at Tony to make sure he heard. He's such a brat. Tony really loves that about him.
She nodded, watching as he pulled the hoodie off, and gasped, unable to hold back her surprise. "Tony!" His ribs were sticking out.
Another tear follows, and then another. It's jarring to see Steve Rogers openly crying. Tony doesn't know what to do. It's not a common occurrence that he's left without some plan of action, but seeing someone he's grown to care about, someone he loves on a deeper level than anyone he ever has before, so heartbreakingly sad, strikes him dumb.
Tony, who never held much stock in things that weren't rooted in science, who scoffed at things like poetry. Who learned and read for Steve.
He started with the shelves to the left side of him. They were oak, tasteful even to his (unknowingly) classic predilection, and stained a dark and rich red. They were filled with books and framed photographs, knick knacks, and mementos. Each style of each decoration so varied he couldn't discern if the decorations were that of one person with diverse likes or many people with individual preferences. A large framed photo in the middle caught his attention.
He shifted when the tremors made his thigh muscles quake with how he was sitting. His face screwed up in concentration. The physical withdrawal symptoms were temporary, he just needed to remember that. Sliding his legs out from under him, he fell back, arms splayed out and a light sheen of sweat along his brow. He took a deep breath, held it, and exhaled loudly. The whole team was obviously close, but Steve and Tony seemed to have a special bond. They spent most of their time together, and if Howard felt an obtrusive pang of jealousy, he pushed it down with two fists banging into the mattress.
He stepped forward, pushing down the sweats and leaving them on the floor, his cock standing up. "I will gladly join you." He gave it a few twists, letting out a small breath when he finally touched himself.
There was applause and cheering as he left the stage, shaking hands with the board members and the VIP guests at the stairs, cameras flashing and journalists jotting notes quickly to make their deadlines. It was a whirl in the very best way.
Tony was quiet for a moment, his inquisitive nature warring with his lust. "Ah, fuck," he relented, squirming around in an attempt to right himself on the couch. Steve looked down at him, a fond and amused expression on his face.
, Nick," she lightly teased, her heart ready to burst in excitement. "Established fan base, talent, and intelligence. This is
Steve ignored them, which Bruce didn't blame him for. Adjusting Tony in his arms, he walked out. Bruce watched him go, a soft smile playing on his lips. He bumped Clint's shoulder. "How long do you think we're grounded for?"
"No." Turning, she headed toward her kitchenette. "He wouldn't risk losing Tony over that. Tea?" The kettle was already on the stove, steam rising from the spout. Steve might hurt Howard, but he wouldn't chance altering Tony's birth, his temper notwithstanding.
The sweater stayed on, and he flopped back on his bed, shoving a few pillows underneath himself and grabbing the lube, the dildo, and the vibrator from his nightstand. It never hurt to be prepared.
but, Bridgette had said to ignore the signs. Under his feet, the shiny linoleum echoes his footsteps back to him, and he takes a left at the end of the hall. He encounters no one, and for a few panicky moments, he fears they’ve had one over on him, that he's actually in
Tony wobbles his head back and forth like he's contemplating it. "I can deal with dirt. Archangel, you say? Do you always make house calls?"
"If it would be of use if we cannot locate him," Thor spoke up, and Steve was almost giddy to see that though Bruce didn't seem to care and Natasha was too stoic to allow herself to leer, the Asgardian had a full erection poking a tent in his pants, "we could draw him out, and I am positive I could destroy any equipment he has." Steve liked when Thor wore civilian clothes. There was something very sexy about him in sweatpants and a t-shirt. He and Tony had entertained the idea of bringing him into their bedroom on a few occasions. Hell, they had spoken about having all the other Avengers at one point or another. The tent in the grey sweatpants was glorious, he only hoped Tony would lift his head to see it as well.
Steve had no words to even begin to respond to that. Instead, he turned on his heels and left, his feet heavy on the marble floors, slamming the door to his bedroom behind him.
"Box of the new Starkphones over there," Tony gestured with his head, taking the second mug from Clint's hands. "They come out next month."
"Because he was trying to find me? Why does Howard do anything? He's selfish, he doesn't think of the repercussions of his actions."
"I have a packet here, of information concerning celiac." Natasha took the packet from the folds of her jacket and placed it on the table. "But maybe you could help us, Bruce?"
He shifted in his seat, getting comfortable as Happy pulled into traffic, "yeah, Doc said what everyone thinks. Came back positive for celiac."
Avery spoke quietly when Tony didn't move to answer her, "This is common. He's okay. It's the fact that he finally knows what's wrong, that it isn't going to kill him. To have an answer."
"No." Steve said softly, his fingers still moving, he bent the digit upwards, trying to stretch him quicker. Out of nowhere, Tony keened.
A plate slid in front of Howard and he glanced up, Natasha giving him a small smile, "Eat. You need something in your stomach. Cream cheese?" He nodded and she retrieved it, handing it to him along with a knife and sitting down with her last remaining piece of toast. "I get it, you know." At his inquiring look, she elaborated, "That you're not that guy yet."
"Baby, no." He took Tony's face into his hands, rubbing his thumbs across his cheeks. "I don't know what happened, but none of this is your fault."
Shaking his head, Tony doesn't answer. He physically can't; it's too overwhelming to think of the job he now has, and the mere thought of doing it without Rhodey is heart-wrenching. "I thought you were dead. I thought they killed you," he's finally able to say.
Tony was curled up on his side, his head tucked down, and Clint smiled sheepishly at Bruce, patting Tony's arm awkwardly. The genius made a soft sound, adjusting himself minutely. "Wouldn't want that." He kept his voice low but still filled with his usual brand of cheek. "And it was dangerous - though in the most fun of ways - which means we put the love of Steve's life in peril."
"So," he started with a lighter tone, knowing he was about to ask a lot, "Natasha kinda got Clint drunk. And Howard," he rushed through the words, wincing as he said them, "Clint and Howard. Smashed in the living room. They ate pizza. They drank vodka."
"I think Tony yelled at Steve for it though. He looked pissed when I saw him this morning." Placing her cup on the ground next to her, she folded her legs underneath her body and leaned on Clint. "Steve is being a bit, well,
Tony didn't even have a chance to answer. The train had stopped, doors opening, and Steve took the opportunity.
"And yet, you're still reserving your judgement of me." He trapped the counter, a look of begrudging respect dancing along his face.
"I cannot tell you. Don't ask me how I know that; I just do. You must step inside and find out for yourself. But," Yinsen holds a finger up, "I do believe that your answer will be different from mine."
"Smart woman," Clint grinned, taking the phone to wish her a happy birthday. Tony turned away from him to continue making idle chatter with the fans. They had moved to the curb as the sidewalks were filled with the lunchtime rush.
" She let her voice go annoyingly high as she imitated him, and when he grumbled in protest to the pitch, she bumped his shoulder, smiling sweetly at him. "It was kinda cute."
Steve had a predatory gleam in his eyes as he stalked closer to the couch. "Clinton, did you know Tony is ticklish?"
Closing his eyes, Tony let one hand drag down to his cock, his breath coming out in a wisp as he moaned. "Steve..."
He ate fruit, munched on raw vegetables, and ate soup. As much as he was growing bored with the lack of variation, he was feeling better than he had in awhile. Natasha got him a treat of vanilla ice cream and when he kept that down, she allowed him a bowl of Rice Chex the next morning, so he didn't have to eat soup for breakfast.
Thor hummed in agreement. "In which case, we have time to convince this Stark to change his - how do you say? Your colloquialisms confuse me - Ah yes, to change the tune of the song he is singing. Barton," he put his hand on the archer's shoulder, "take Romanoff somewhere so the two of you can quell your tempers. Return the day after tomorrow. I will handle Howard Stark."
They narrowed their eyes at each other and burst out laughing. "Whatever!" Steve grinned, "Luke and Lorelei forever, at least?"
He wakes again to lights that are too bright and the smell of antiseptic. There's a brief flash of Steve, concerned and talking to him, but he can't make out the words. His hand reaches up, fingers curled around something that isn't there, and he brushes his knuckles against Steve's cheek. The world whites out again.
Tony nodded, handing him a clean fork. "Salt and pepper are up there as well, uh, when you're done, just bring the plate back to my suite. It's the door at the far end. You can shower and I'll find something for you to wear."
Steve was looking at him curiously, so Tony did his best to grin in an attempt to ease the soldier's concern. "Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Happens all the time." He said truthfully to the man. You didn't look like he did and not get unwanted advances often.
"I think a unique situation requires a unique solution. Creating a brand new identity may be easier in the short term, but it comes with its own complications." He stood, lifting Mjölnir and studying it. "It is easier for me, sometimes, to take my hammer and swing out into the enemies and obstacles we face, but that only aids for that particular moment. Taking the time to charge the energy and strike with lightning is much more effective. In some situations, anyway."
They were independent. Jaded. Hurt so badly by the industry they loved that they just… took it all upon themselves; they had each other's backs. No one else's.
Steve had just sat up, too worn to care about clean-up, and was tugging the blankets over them when there was a knock. And the door swung open.
With the closure of this fic, I wonder if anyone is interested in a sequel? I do have another group chat pic that I created to help me plan the last chapter, I had no intention of using it, but I will post it as a one-shot to this story if anyone wants to read it.
With a sigh that could rival Tony's at his most annoyed, he sat up and swung his feet over the edge of his bed. It was a small price to pay for keeping the Other Guy at bay.
"We haven't written or sang songs for the Top 40 demographic in years," Thor added, interrupting Steve's memories, and leaning over the back of the couch, one of the contracts still on his hand. He gestured with it. "We're considered adult contemporary now."
"Let me finish. Please." Steve nodded, and Tony continued, his voice thick with emotion. "You should never have had to choose between me and Howard. You should never have felt the need to protect me like this." Steve moved to interrupt again, and Tony barreled on, cutting off whatever he was going to say. "This has put a lot of strain on both of us. And I-" He switched gears. Better to put the entirety of the blame on himself. It was his fault anyway. "-I can't handle the complications of a relationship right now. Not with Howard here for the foreseeable future, and not until I can give you what you need."
Though they both knew the needed to talk about everything was important for their moving forward together, neither made the jump to start. They lay there, Tony on Steve's chest, skin to skin, tired and sated, content. The silence twirled around their sleepy bodies, enveloping them in a warm cocoon. It was nice to just hear the other breathe, knowing he was back where he belonged: In the other's arms.
He held him hand up, silencing her. "Number one, fuck you and whatever horse you rode in on, number two, give me a second to get over this heart attack,
Tony stayed quiet for just a moment, weighing what he wanted to say. It didn't seem right to test Steve, but he needed to know. Tony always did have trouble with impulse control. "And you have no problem letting someone else decide?"
It was awkward the first few weeks as they all learned to live with each other when Howard took over and redecorated Steve's little efficiency apartment.  Meanwhile, Steve moved in with Tony, and Howard spent most of his time in their suite. There were hiccups, dark moments where Howard would find a picture of Maria or learn about how something ended that he had started. Steve had found him near tears several times, photo albums open in his lap and his hands in his hair, lamenting everything he’d missed.
"Oh, come on, I'm harmless! Come and have a drink with me!" He threw his arms around Bruce's shoulder and tugged him toward the bar, but Bruce violently shrugged him off.
Tony winced. So, he was Stark again. "I'm really sorry. Seriously!" Tony said, holding his hands up and knowing that the other man wouldn't believe him. "I didn't know that Natasha would bring you to the workshop. It's just, you know," he shrugged pathetically, "the stories are hot."
"Not gonna happen, Tones," he tugged the blanket away from his face, "so you might as well sit up and make this easier on yourself."
He paused, thinking, before the words fell out, tumbling from his fingertips. It was easy when it was something you really wanted. The professionals did say to write what you know, after all. They called that catharsis, didn't they?
It's chaos, but it needs to happen. Tony isn't ashamed that he did his best to try and protect their servicemen and women, but he'll be damned if any more die because his weapons end up in the wrong hands. There's more for him to do to keep them safe, and that's what he's going to focus on. He's already got jobs and positions lined up in his head for those in the departments he's shutting down, both lateral and upward movements. His fingers itch to get started on some of the ideas mulling around his brain. Technology is only as infinite as the creative mind allows, after all. There’re fifty years left in this life, and he plans to make every second count.
Steve swallowed. Tony was worried about him? Jeez, he needed to get his act together if he was going to properly care for him during this, and that sent a flare of anger up through his body.
"Off limits." He jerked his head, gesturing to Howard's bruised cheek. "How's your face?" It was said with mock sympathy, and Howard winced again.
Fury took his hand and shook it, firmly. It hurt, but Howard supposed he deserved that. He didn't wince. "A Howard Stark that actually takes responsibility for his actions. Never thought I'd see the day."
"He sounds just like him!" Howard exclaimed, his awe evident. "I mean you'd know better, you've known him longer, I'm guessing. Probably spent more time with him." He shrugged, a bit ashamed. "You obviously loved Jarvis quite a bit. And it shows. This," he pointed to the ceiling, "is absolutely astounding."
Pressing his forehead against Tony's, Steve shut his eyes. When he finally spoke, his voice was thick. "Tony, I'm sorry. I can't just let him hurt you again. Whatever the chance may be." He opened his eyes and licked his lips, bringing his hands up to cup Tony's face. "Can you accept that?"
Tony is pretty damn annoyed as well. If the weather was different and Howard had found that out, who could even guess how different Tony's childhood
"I thought, I don't know. I came to see if you needed help." Tony's voice was stiff, his eyes never leaving Howard.
His hand dropped, and he dragged it back up, leaning his forehead on it. "Feels so good, oh god, oh fuck, please please please!"
Clint looked away, out the back windows and across the horizon. Maybe he saw her safe house as well. They were too alike sometimes. "It's not good, if that's what you're asking."
The man who walked over wasn't at all what Tony was expecting. He was tall, broad, and gorgeous. Blond hair and blue eyes, built like a brick shithouse. If he agreed, he'd be perfect. Sammy Silver Feathers had said he'd find the perfect person to do the job. He was more right than he knew.
He smiled softly as he scooped Tony into his arms and turned him the right way on the bed, the blue pajama bottoms falling over Tony's bare feet as he was lifted.
It was Steve's turn to shrug. "I remember getting a letter about it, I think Miss Potts handled it on your end."
Bruce had texted her an hour before to say he was comparing the DNA and that he wasn't ready to see his best friend's monster up close and personal just yet. It was probably a good idea. They didn't need the Other Guy coming out and showing Howard just how protective he was of his Tin Man.
When it finished, he pulled the dildo from his ass and melted into the bed, his body still twitching in the aftermath.
When he returned, he kissed Tony again and lifted him into his arms like he weighed nothing at all. "Steve!" He protested, but it was all in show. To feel so cared for, so loved...he didn't think he could ever adequately elucidate what that was like.
and it was adorable. Their families loved the match. It was a power play, designed to up both family's stances, but it was also a match that
But the writing was making him delve back into the darker thoughts of that morning, something he didn't want. He wanted to escape the disapproving frowns of his teammates, the media speculation of just how much had been done to him in the past, and the posts on Twitter and Facebook from fans and others alike, horrified that Tony thought so little of himself.
"Help! I need an adult!" Tony yelled, hopping over a stack of newspapers and sprinting across the street.
"Chill. We're sorry, okay, man?" The one in the middle said, hastily shoving his phone in his pocket.
A few times the phone dropped, too intense was the pleasure, and his head thrashed. "Steve," he kept moaning, "fuck, Steve, please. Fucking eat me!"
"-He received that no one was very happy with him." It was another art form mastered: the art of ignoring Tony's interjections. "I didn't tell him," Steve reassured Tony, watching as his body tensed as he set out the plates, "that's up to you. But if magic got him here, it'll get him home most likely."
"Ah huh, and this is nothing too!" Tony may be smaller than Steve, but he can be almost as quick. Bending and scooping up a handful of snow, he launches it at Steve, hitting him square in the face. Steve only laughs and paws at the icy mixture, wiping his face clean. He doesn't retaliate, which is another annoyingly endearing quality he has that Tony adores. He can take as much as he gives when it comes to cheek.
Steve took a deep breath and blew it out through pursed lips. "Not entirely. Tony-" He stepped back, pressing his hands to the back of his head. "-Howard is from a different time. Like me. And how long did it take you to convince me
"I know," Tony relents, "but I think I can improve on it. Make it safe. I think...Phil, I'm onto something here. Something big. Something that can save a whole lot of lives, not just your charges, but everyone else's."
“I’ve been doing more research into arc reactor technology. Do you know what a power source like that is capable of doing? Well aside from being extremely destructive in the wrong hands? It can be used as a clean energy source. It can be used for so much and it doesn’t have to be weapons.”
“Yes and I’m glad. Tony has been horribly moody that he’s lucky I am even here with him tonight. He had a huge fight with his father after the fight he had with you and he’s been pretty angry ever since. It’s not so much at you. Well not anymore.” She sighed. “He misses you but he won’t say it to anyone. You have to read between the lines with Tony because he’s not capable of dealing with high emotional situations. He hasn’t called you because he’s angry at himself more than anything and believes he’s a monumental screw up. He’ll never stop believing that, but maybe you can prove otherwise to him.”
"We are in another era, Cap. The people of today are more civilized and aware that this is not a disease or something horrible. "
"You should do something against that," he said to Sharon stroking the blond. "I would not put up with that much.”
“You should be with me, Steve.  We are for each other.  I heard that old music to be with you and talk, I investigated those years, we talked about my aunt, your first love I should be the second! "His eyes shone full of tears." You should have loved me.”
Stark looked away, something told him that the soldier liked Thor, the two were always together when meetings were held and a while ago he had seen them talk happily, that did not concern him, in anything, but it was strange. Besides, he does not think that God likes Steve, he suspected a crush on Loki because of the melancholy story of a while ago and if so, the blonde he had in front of him would be sad-if Thor liked him, of course- but he could be wrong.
"It's time to let the Cap go," said Barton, giving him a smile that was more like a grimace. "He loves Tony."
"Is everything all right here?" He asked, leaning against the door frame. "They are too quiet since we arrived."
"Pepper left the company and she was the one who attended half of the meetings, now I have all the work."
Sharon moved from the door to see that Tony intended to make him move with a shove. He stared at it for a moment and then closed the door and followed him into the main room. She wondered where he had been dark, and why he left.
He saw the grimace that made him millionaire and squinted, was he saying with that grimace that this man was a fool or something? Wow, I was wrong interpreting things.
Carter grimaced knowingly looking back at Rogers, then the others were realizing, without more, he turned quickly.
"You're an idiot, Stark and no one loves idiots," he said making the brunette laugh. "The day your relationship fails for you, you'll regret it all your life and Steve will realize that it was a mistake to have met you.  You're nobody, Tony, just a famous millionaire who cares about interested people, nobody else.”
"Show me you love me, Rogers. Make me feel loved for the first time in my damn life. I give you that opportunity. You’ll do it?"
He looked askance at the distance of their bodies on the sofa, it was not much, his legs almost stuck but because he was stuck to the arms. Then he went to see the people present, everyone was ignoring the proximity, indeed, nobody paid attention to them, they were focused on laughing with the stories of the God of thunder. He gave one last look, he was going to do something he never imagined doing in front of so many people or his companions.
"No, Sharon, I’ll not leave and I'm sorry to disappoint you." Tony grimaced, pretending to think. "You know what? No, I'm not sorry to do it. "
Thor and Tony disappeared down the stairs, leaving the others in their places. Sharon snorted, she was fine without him and she had Steve at least 13 hours a day. He distracted him from jobs, they did missions together and they laughed the moment passed, but now with Stark, he would not listen to him. And he was right.
Rogers turned quickly and went to where Tony was by the arm and started up the stairs.  He did not put any resistance.  I wanted explanations.  Steve would give them to him, but first he had to get away from Sharon.  And she stayed in the same place, snorting furiously at Steve's words.  At least they would have problems that night.  What I did not know is that it is wrong, there will be no problems.
Tony bit his lower lip, something told him to continue with this, he wouldn’t deny that since he met Captain America an emotion slipped inside him. And as? His idol was he, since childhood, admired what he came to do for his nation and hid it perfectly. He admired him in secret from Germany, feigned displeasure at his good bearing before the rules and good deeds. But he followed, not to mention that he had a shirt with the Captain's shield.
Tony needed to take a breath, that had confirmed his recent suspicion. Really, he would not have imagined that, much less the Captain who comes from those years where that was seen badly. Still, Steve was a very understanding person and accepted / adapted everything new in these years.
Steve watched his boyfriend sleep, it was so tender to see him and so sexy with that sheet wrapped around his waist.  He smiled slightly.  He always thought that he had won the lottery with him, it was the most important thing in his life and no one would change that.  Tony was his fortune, his love, his love and his everything.  He no longer needed to ask for life, he had complemented it and if one day he lost it, there would be a huge void impossible to be filled again.
The Soldier's cheeks took on a crimson color and a smile left his lips. Tony bit his lip, that strange sensation returned to his stomach, how did they say? Oh, yes, butterflies. And all just to see him smile that way.
Tony had been sitting on a stool in his kitchen, working on a few notes he needed to use for a presentation he was going to give at the next board meeting, on his StarkPad. He of course knew that he’d remember every small detail without needing to even look at the notes, but he knew the board members would be lost and ask a lot more stupid questions if they didn’t have notes to look at. He hated it when they asked questions. His one goal in life was to make board meetings end as quickly as possible.
When the first movie ended, Steve began another though Tony ended up finishing his work about half way through. He lifted his goggles from his eyes and blinked a few times, gaze on the far wall before shaking his head and focusing on the two men sat before him. “Good as new. Well, new is a relative term. It shouldn’t have any more problems for awhile, but since it’s still basically a prototype, though a Stark prototype is basically a finished product years ahead of the game, I can’t say it won’t have problems in the future. We should do random tune ups from now on, to make sure everything stays in tip top shape.”
Steve watched as guards began dropping, the faint sound of arrows in the air and grunts drifting back to them in the stillness of the night.
Steve dressed like a punk rocker. How fucking hot was that? Of all the things Tony had been expecting to see that night, it was definitely not that. It took him a second to recognize the blond but when he did he realized it was pointless to try and let go of that little crush he had. Steve was in a band too and he had to say he never saw that one coming. This, of course, made him feel a desperate need to get to know Steve just a little more and he had to figure out how. He’d seen him standing in front of the stage during their performance and he tried not to smile too much because he’d caught Steve looking at him a few times, but it seemed they were mostly there for Natasha.
Both Pepper and Rhodey snorted. “No offense, Tones, but our lives and jobs were compromised the moment we became friends.”
Tony smirked. “You say that like you still don’t believe me.” He pet the bot again, fingers gentle along the metal. “He’s very curious, he’s practically a teenager in bot years. Don’t worry though. I told him that under absolutely no circumstances is he allowed to cat call you at any point or make a pass at your virtue.” He spoke to the bot then. “Isn’t that right, Sergeant? Uh huh, that’s daddy’s job.”
Tony shrugged and sipped at his coffee. “I haven’t been outside since HYDRA kidnapped me. I’m not counting my escape because I was half out of it, stumbling, and injured.”
Tony began eating his hot dog and rested comfortably next to Steve. They were both sitting in silence for a long while before Tony spoke up again.
He was cut off when his com made a buzzing in his hand; an incoming call. Steve placed the device back in his ear. “Rogers. Any news?”
He nodded, looking off toward one of his suits before meeting her gaze again with a tight smile. “I know, Pepper.”
He pushed open a door that lead to nothing but another dead end. “Stark’s gone after Stane, I’m in pursuit now. You guys handling things alright on the front lines?”
Pepper, on the other hand, told Tony he was under no circumstances allowed to leave until he made a point to talk to Steve. Tony whined, but only a little, and Pepper lightly patted the side of his face. “Be nice. You don’t want to lose any of your friends before college.” She tilted her head slightly to indicate Steve when she said “any of your friends.”
Steve laughed a little at that, but it sounded like it was forced and then the soldier grabbed his hand and rubbed circles over the back of it with his thumb. “Yeah it does.”
Tony made a face before taking another sip of his root beer. “There’s a lot of things people don’t seem to want to tell me,” he muttered, scratching at the can with his thumbnail.
Tony grumbled. His son Peter was bouncing on his bed at the ungodly hour of six in the morning. He was laying on his stomach, half of his face smooshed into his pillow and one arm dangling off the side of the bed.
“You know he does, Steve. He cares more than you probably realize, but that’s always been the problem with the two of you.”
Tony fidgeted. “It’s silly. Christmas traditions are silly. All of it is silly.” He held out his hand for the sweater anyway.
Steve spit out the coke he was drinking. “Wh-what?” He was now doing the blushing thing. “I don’t...what?”
“You’re right. You are stupid.” At Steve’s hurt look, he held up his hand. “But so am I. Honestly, I thought with all those muscles and whatnot that you wouldn’t need me anymore. That you wouldn’t want my help. That you’d go away. I can’t pretend that I know how relationships are supposed to work. I’ve always, more or less, made it up as I went. If we’re being truthful though, I’d be an idiot not to tell you that I’ve been secretly pining for you as Pepper likes to say. I don’t know why I was so scared to tell you that, but it sucks to know that we’ve seriously wasted this much time keeping it a secret.”
Once they were changed and Tony was resting against Steve in bed, the blond yawned. “I love you, Tony. Everything will be okay eventually. Just don’t push me out again.”
“Who do you think stepped up to the plate and helped me out when my parents died? Who do you think mentored me and helped me settle into my new role as CEO? Who do you think was the only family I had left? I looked up to him. I trusted him. He gave me years of his life, which I can only hopefully assume was an act of kindness on his part, but I know it’s enough for me to have problems with killing the man.” He looked at Bruce. “I’m already responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, just because of the weapons I’ve made. Bruce, my weapons have been getting sold under the table to terrorist organizations, dictators, Russia...and people are dying. Innocent people are dying because my weapons are so goddamn fucking effective. I thought I was protecting the good guys, but who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Who am I to decide that?”
Tony sighed as if this was the most inconvenient thing to ever happen to him and stomped away, but he was probably just going to tinker with Steve’s robot dog because he couldn’t seem to help himself in his quest to make it better than it already was.
Tony felt Steve as he trembled beneath him, felt his dick twitch in his hands and knew Steve was close. He continued to give Steve’s neck open mouthed kisses and small nips as his dexterous hands worked over Steve’s cock and balls.  Another twist of Tony’s fingers around the head of Steve’s cock and Steve was coming. His head thrown back, face in pure bliss and his lips shaping out a perfect O. Tony stroked him through it, milking his cock for all its worth.
Clint visibly gulped, trading one last look with Bruce before turning to his captain. "Because… we took such good care of Tony that he'll rather be with us!"
"Tony." Shaking his head, Steve kissed him. "I love you. Now hang tight, I'll be back soon. I need to go deal with your father."
Rolling her eyes, Natasha said, "He knows I think you're hot. You all are. But I'm not interested. I am, however, interested in the weight you've gained back. Looks good."
Tony's legs clamped around him as he came, a gurgled moan ripping from his throat, his fingers dragging down Steve's arms. "Fuck!"
"Sure, go ahead." She made no move to get up, or to turn around, so he made a face and went back into the bathroom. As he closed the door, she yelled out, "Spoilsport!"
He looked up as Tony entered, eyeing him warily. The plate slid across the marble surface like an olive branch extended between them.
"Oh, Jesus, fuck!" Clint was coming. His body almost convulsing as the streams jetted out of his cock, landing on Tony's firm and rotund ass, some dripping down the crevice and dipping over the rim. Steve pulled the vibrator out enough to gather the come, and pushed right back into Tony, coating his insides with drops of Barton's seed.
"Just shut up, Howard," Steve snapped, bullying his way in between them. Not like it was hard, Tony had kept the Grand Canyon between himself and Howard.
"First of all-" Steve quipped, kneeling on the floor in between Tony's legs, "-you and I both know you can't see anything through those glasses. We are definitely getting you contacts. No more hiding those beautiful eyes behind coke bottle lenses." He pushed Tony's glasses back up. "Secondly-" he flicked the top of the lube open, drizzling some onto the fingers of his right hand, "-I've been planning this for longer than I want to admit. And this isn't a one time thing for me." Leaning forward, he kissed the inside of Tony's thigh, his fingers, covered in lube, pressing against Tony's hole. "I'm going to come inside you, and you're going to beg for release. Then I'm taking the rest of the day off and taking you to dinner. How does that sound?"
"No, you don't know him as well as-" she stopped, slamming the book back on the shelf. "If he were to leave Steve, it would be because he thought it was for Cap's own good. That he was the reason behind the forcing of Steve's hand. He would find some way to
Jarvis said nothing, but did as he was asked. And Tony dropped the phone, unconcerned as he heard it hit the floor, and wrapped his hand around himself, jerking fast and in time with the dildo.
"Are you going to do a full body exam, Doctor?" Tony asked, stretching his arms up as Steve removed his shirt.
Steve feels pride in that. He presses his lips against Tony's forehead and continues until Tony's eyes flutter open, vastly more lucid than he has been.
"Come on, let's head back. I'm hungry again." Tony said instead, turning to look at Steve, who lifted his head quickly to view the sky.
It was softer, somehow, and sweeter. They were exhausted, the movements measured and slow, Steve sleepily fucking up into him, his hand around the genius' dick. Tony rolled his hips, bringing Steve in and out as he moved, the positioning perfect for direct stimulation to his prostate. His right arm up and cupping the back of Steve's head, his own pressed against the hard shoulder behind him.
"Yes and no. I don't think we should attach this Howard to anything the other did, do you?" He could have been raising both eyebrows in question, but Tony couldn't tell. For all he saw, Fury had perfectly quirked his right eyebrow, and that was that.
"I keep thinking it's a joke, like hey! Let's fuck with Tony Stark again! Because the universe hates me."
He threw his head back and laughed, deftly dodging a punch. "We were not banished, Nat. Thor is just working his magic. In fact-" he scooted his chair out of swinging reach, "-maybe we didn't really hear Howard out. Thor seemed to think he was redeemable, and-" he put his hands up to placate her, "-prior to the other night, you did too."
"And 39 cents." Clint cheeked. They combined their carts and left the other by the entrance, headed into the breakfast aisle to get cereal before meeting back up with Natasha. "So who's gonna cook all this?"
"It can. And I'm happy to hear that you're not actually a homophobic jerk. You're not, right?" He fixed Howard's with a heady stare, locking eyes with him as he sat. If he let a flash a green shoot across his pupils, well, there was nothing wrong with a bit of healthy fear.
The engraved silver platter was an heirloom as well, and Steve filled it with the cups, their saucers, and the matching sugar bowl and milk container. He filled the teapot with boiling water from the kettle and measured out the right amount of loose tea into the strainers, dropping them in and covering the pot. All done with a surgical precision honed from too many battles and too much need for detail.
"Let's just say that when you're in the game as long as I've been, you learn a few things." Stepping back, Coulson turns to the door. "And Tony? Don't be late."
Tony just chuckled and started typing out the intricate code to get Jarvis on the phone. Clint waited patiently until he was done, taking the phone back and swiping through it to get a feel. "Jarvis will walk you through set up now. Everything from your old phone should wirelessly transfer over."
"Tony!" Steve grabbed his arm, but what he wanted to say died on his lips. The alarm was still blaring. Every second wasted could mean a life lost. "Get in the armor. If you need to sit this one out, do it, do you understand me? We'll be all right. Just stay in the armor. I can't… I don't want anything to happen to you!"
"Tony!" Pepper answered after three rings, "just a sec," he heard the rustling of papers and a door closing. "Did you get the results?"
Thor tried to give his usual hearty laugh, but a choked moan interrupted it when Steve pulled the vibrator from Tony's ass again and slammed it back in. Tony's whole body jerked.
done her research. She knew that aside from a few other celebrity friends, they kept to themselves. Built a wall around their own little world and the tiny empire they established. Only encompassing what they trusted. Adult fangirls. The occasional fan
"You know," Tony starts, looking up at Steve's beautiful face, "I can't cook to save my life, but I can make a mean cup of hot cocoa."
It was a ploy to distract Tony, Steve really didn't have much more information without speaking to Howard again, and he didn't want Tony to feel overwhelmed with the situation. The logical response? Obviously to get and keep him laughing.
"Ah, yes. I've heard." It's somehow still unnerving to think of himself as favored by an archangel, and Tony adjusts his body on the cushion to hide his discomfort. "How old are you? Unless that's like asking a woman her age."
But forcibly learned habits die hard and Tony was in and out, rubbing his face, body, and hair with the same soap.
"Steve!" Tony moaned, his fingers digging into him, "oh god. Just like that!" His arms hooked under Steve's, coming up to wrap around his shoulders. "So close, Steve, right there! I'm so close!"
She smiles knowingly as if it's something she hears often enough that it's no longer a nuisance to her. "You are. Congratulations on your acceptance to Heaven and not, you know—" she lowers her voice, "—the other place."
"Some," Nat said, suddenly engrossed in the book in front of her. "Bruce would know more, but last I heard he hadn't made that much progress with it. He, uh, well we've been distracted. If you absolutely
"And?" Clint jumped up, grabbing the tome and waving it through the air, "This is something you should lead with, Hill! What happened? How did you send that person back?"
Nat slid off her jacket and hung out on the hook by the door. "We should get the others. JARVIS? Can you-"
, I know you're feeling a bit protective of your friend, but don't-" He moved to go around her, determination set on his face. She grabbed his arm and pulled him back, "-Don't go in there and antagonize him!"
Avery entered a few minutes later, sitting on the stool after shaking their hands, smiling openly at Natasha. "My daughter idolizes you."
"God yes, I'm starving." He spun on his feet, facing the opposite direction and towards the back of the wall with the Chitauri ship on it.
"That's not going to stop even when he's better. You're dating," she answered, a small grin dancing across her face. "It kind of goes with the program."
"You got out of the-did you guys even THINK for one second, just one measly second that I could have prevented this?"
getting exactly what the doctor ordered. Tony hung on tightly, his mouth slack and his eyes rolling, each thrust punctuating a breathy moan in time with Steve's cock hitting his prostate.
The app I used cut the header off, and yes that's a pic of Robert and CEvans I MEAN TONY AND STEVE that they used for the chat photo.
"I mean, I guess we can get the assassin twins on it. Or clue in someone from SHIELD that we can trust to keep their mouths shut," Steve supplied.
Tony jolted, his gasp coming out guttural and hoarse as he came, shuddering and jerking with the force of his climax. Feeling the wetness spread across his abdomen, Steve let go, relinquishing what little command he had over his body and letting his orgasm cascade over him, filling Tony again.
Taking the eggs before Tony could drop them, Bruce swung around to walk to the table. "What? The great Tony Stark? Ticklish?" He traded a loaded look with Steve, "Impossible!"
It wasn't that Tony didn't think Steve could handle it. On the contrary, he knew he could. It was that Steve didn't deserve to have to deal with the trauma that came with dating Tony Stark.
"A bit too much. If you ask me, trying to relax and drink my weight in tequila means the last thing I want to hear is a 37-minute off-key attempt at a Gregorian chant."
"We all play to our strengths." She flipped another page, "Isn't this attractive?" She showed him a picture of himself, heavily Photoshopped to look thinner than he was. "I didn't know you moonlit as a skeleton."
"And the other guy," Howard exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air, "Tony or Tommy, or whatever, he ran as soon as I came into the room. What am I? A leper?"
"But you won't, will you? Not until I tell you. Because good little whores follow directions, don't they?" He completed his answer by smacking Tony again and pressing his fingers hard into his prostate, jutting them back and forth. Tony's head lifted, throwing it back and yelling his moan, pushing back on his hands to drive Steve into him deeper. His thighs trembling around Steve's waist.
He kissed the back of Tony's neck and lifted him by his hips. Tony helped by bracing himself on the tub as Steve lined his cock up and slipped inside him once more.
It echoed through the room, washing over the guests and leaving them smiling and nodding, appreciative.
Steve just smiled and shook his head. "Point still stands. It's not about being worthy, Tony. It's about me loving you, and you loving me. And nothing else matters."
"I'm… adjusting," Howard answered, and Bruce was pleased to hear a note of honesty in his voice. "Where I come from, it's unacceptable. But if I've learned anything from my days here, it's that the future holds one thing we didn't think possible in my time."
"You brought him down here?! Why?" Tony snapped, flipping his shirt over his head and grabbing his pants.
He had no chance to finish as Steve finally skidded to a stop in front of Howard, screaming through his com, "Thor! Now!" He shoved Howard hard in the other direction. "RUN!" he yelled, dodging around him to lift Tony into his arms. "Thor's going to fry him!"
"Thank you. I know this has been crazy, I know everything is fucked up right now, but if there's going to be a mistake, let me be the one to make it."
"What's the retirement age?" Tony asks, genuinely curious. He's tempted to ask if they have a pension or a 401K as well.
Tony huffed, annoyed at the excitement he felt stirring in his pants. "I need the blood to flow to my brain, Banner. Not my dick."
After all the build up, Steve was already close. He draped himself over Tony, letting go of his hair to instead bite at his shoulder. "Oh, shit," he mouthed against Tony's skin, "oh, fuck, baby, I'm going to fucking come!" The game was dropped. He was too far gone to keep up appearances.
"Or," Tony began, tapping his chin, "maybe there's room on the Avengers floor after all." He smirked at Howard, leering, just a little. "I think it's about time I ask my boyfriend to move in."
"That's it, baby, oh god, you're so beautiful like this. So perfect." Steve's hips stuttered, and he let go of Tony's hand and length to hold him down as he came, filling him completely.
Tony wouldn't even look at him. And that hurt the most. Regardless of what had happened in the past, Tony was his present. His future. He had to make this right.
“I should never have treated her like a friend.  And I regret not being able to reciprocate feelings, mine have owner.”
Everyone present except Tony, they turned to see the blonde. His face was turning red, like a tomato and they could see the smoke coming out of his ears, nose and mouth. They examined her for a moment waiting for some reaction, but she did not arrive, she did some kind of witchcraft to stop feeling the anger in front of them or that's how the kids thought about it.
The millionaire rolled his eyes after looking at the newcomer coming down from the elevator, what was there wrong stained? He did not remember inviting her. He looked at her, and came to the conclusion that this blue dress did not favor him at all. He continued to criticize her in his mind, unaware of the presence of a person who looked at him mockingly.
I thought that Tony would not like it and he changed his mind when he darkly pulled him to the track where they all were. He took the Captain's hands to put them on his waist, he raised his hands to the pale neck and thus began a synchronized dance. The guests saw the couples, laughed, made sounds for the tenderness that caused them and others just watched without caring.
He thought darkly, Steve should go with that boy and tell him everything, take a chance. What did it matter? It was not as different as fighting with horrible monsters. I was going to tell her, but a certain redhead came to her side to interrupt the conversation, she looked at him with a raised eyebrow and she just smiled apologetically.
"It does not change anything, even if it was a woman and you would not like it, I would reject you."
This is an extra. The fic had finished in the previous chapter, but will continue with an extra second. Hope you like.
Sharon shrugged.  Unable to tell him more, he smiled again and looked him up and down.  He had that immense desire to kiss him and have him in his bed every night, he knew it was a very appropriate moment for his plan;  Stark was on the floors below and also, finding out about that he did not think possible.  He heard the soldier sigh looking at that strange device and in a hurry: he approached him snatching the device from his hands, finally took the back of his neck and pulled him to kiss him intensely.
"It was fine, it's very beautiful" he said looking up at the Captain's blue eyes. "I would have liked your company" he pouted.
The Soldier bit his lips, he realized that for Natasha, but he did not want anything else with that blonde. He liked another person ... maybe one he's seeing at that moment.
"Don’t you feel insecure? I mean, I just told you how I feel about you and I didn’t expect this, much less you. "
"Great" he smiled taking his suitcase. "I'll go to shower, I'll be down in a few moments to have dinner with you."
"I'm going for Sharon," he warned, pretending to go for her. He took her by the hand and looked at her reproachfully. "You already decided?"
Romanov gave him a little smack on the shoulder with a smile, Steve sighed resignedly and turned on his heels to go back to the brunette. Tony looked at him when he dropped on the bench, did not look back, was full of grief. How would you tell the man who has his feelings in front? No matter how much he gives, he has no idea.
Many thanks to those who gave my work an opportunity on this platform!  I promise to bring more of my stories!
He extended his arm slowly until he was blond, took a breath between cuts and touched Steve's pale hand. This looked at him at once, his brow was furrowed and Tony gave him a smile, interlaced his hands once, at first it felt weird, but after the second the feeling became good.
"I would, yes. But I don’t know that feeling that strong. I have loved the women who were my partner, and even there. "
"Just why am I your best friend, will I risk my friendship with Stark too?" He crossed his arms. "I can’t do it, Nat."
"Did you see everything?" Sharon asked. "It was great to kiss Captain America, I see why you still do not leave it, Stark.  I mean, you always do it in all your relationships.”
"Sharon used to consider her a cousin, yes, I know her enough" he took his glass of red wine. "You are defending her, then you like her."
The Captain was going to answer, but the others replied that he could not go with Tony to say hello. Steve laughed and released his boyfriend to free the way to Vision, Wanda, Rhodes and even Sam. Everyone embraced him. They said nice words, something he did not expect him to be dark.
The three fell silent when they saw the girl cross the room looking at a magazine carefully. And as? The cover don’t lack anything about the Avengers. They looked at each other and laughed softly. The blonde sat on the sofa on the left without paying attention to those present.
He didn’t know exactly the words to describe him because he fell in love with him, sometimes even he questioned that, why the most self-centered person in the world? And much more, why of a man? What was happening?
It was there that the world turned at an inexplicable speed and shouted in his face.  He opened his hazel eyes giving a long sigh with some nerves sneaking inside him.
Rogers kept paying attention to what Thor was saying, while Tony tried to calm the pulse of his heart by having the Soldier like that. His face turned when he felt a curious look on them, he discovered the pretty redhead see directly his hands and his position.
“I warned him about the drinks.” the redhead denied feigning discomfort.  They dropped them on the sofa, and the archer laughed at the abruptness.
"I know, amm ... Tony, I know this is very strange for you and for anyone, but I'm sorry, I didn’t have control over my feelings."
"Your hand is shaking," Steve said in a whisper. He watched their hands and realized that he was indeed trembling. "You don’t have to hold my hand, Tony. We can talk later."
Rogers thanked the disinterested people internally for not seeing them, he didn’t feel sorry for him, but he was afraid of what they would do or think. Yes, he was still affected by everything that happened in his time.
"You also noticed it" she smiled crossing her arms. "I had not noticed anything, I swear, but apparently everyone knew less about us.”
He saw suitcases on the side, while he took off his glasses to analyze the girl. The two looked at each other at the same time and Sharon was the one who spoke when he came out of his amazement.
He didn’t feel prepared for that and to the questions of his friends, what would he say? The two of them were nothing to formalize their friends.
"Yes, the party is about to end" he took off a bit from the other. "Where do you want to talk? My room or on the balcony? "
Sharon walked quickly to the door and left without looking back.  She deserved someone, but wanting someone to love you by force is something ... impossible.  Still, she deserved it.  And maybe I'll find love somewhere else.
“Clint did not want to tell me because I knew he was behind Bruce and you were not told so you would not destroy my illusions.”
“Oh, yes I did, stupid.” the voice of the brunette was also heard in the kitchen. “But I did not have to go to fix it.  Tony, yes.”
"But you do," he says, walking out the other side of the bar and sitting on the high bench facing Rogers. "Now tell me, Who stole your heart?"
"I'm not good at giving love advice, I have not fallen in love with someone and yet, I'm begging you to tell that person what you feel. Even if I just want you as a friend, you must know it and so you do not be excited about one day he will listen to you. Break free."
“I can not do anything.  I do not see you as the love of my life as the person who is right now in my bed, sleeping.”
The older one noticed the child's hazel orbs, his beautiful smile and his eagerness to know it. He looked tender, more than usual.
The blond took the cup of the tan, giving him a long drink and then left it in front of the other. Tony did not flinch because of that, they had shared many things before, what intrigued him was the lost look of Steve. Rogers turned to see him, he had made the decision.
Romanov on hearing that, turned to see the blonde with a raised eyebrow and half smile. Sharon rolled her eyes, it was exasperating to see the scene, besides that she was dying of jealousy and bile.
Stark clung to the slender body of the Captain, resting his cheek on his shoulder. Steve couldn’t be more blushed and with emotion in the air. What does that Tony action mean? I had no answer, but I would enjoy that moment.
"Do you like a boy?" He opens his eyes and mouth a little, he was not confirming it, but Steven brought many secrets with him.
"Nat, says the same thing" he raises his eyebrows in a mocking gesture. "I only invited her to go out once and I do not think anything else happens."
Steve left what will happen first to the room, took the opportunity to take a deep breath and be able to stand the words or the moment, he was encouraged a little and went completely to the room. He closed the door with his foot; watching Tony study the things he kept on the walls, the painted paintings, and especially the order of things. The younger smiled when he sat next to him, how the hell did you start a conversation with that issue in between?
The blonde took off completely from the tan, looked once again at his companions making sure they didn’t see them leave the small party. He started walking with Tony following him back, the excitement, the nerves, the happiness and all that was eating away inside him, it was difficult for him to accept that Tony liked him very much, but nothing he did to prevent it would make him forget him.
Without receiving an answer, he went to the couch sitting on the side of his best friend.  He still told the story, he paid attention to a few of the parties-where he "left" him-making fun of the dark man's lack of humor and emotion.  He got bored minutes later, he looked for his partner's eyes and soon found her.  Great was his surprise when he saw the blonde closer to Steve, his instincts told him to drag her across the floor, but he held back.
"That's enough, Carter," the spy spoke in a demanding but calm tone. "Accept reality because if you get to do something stupid, I'll make you regret it and much worse with Wanda."
In the end, he also interlaced his hand and they continued walking, they climbed the stairs slowly, not wanting to get to the room and die of nerves for talking about a very compromising topic. Tony was the less mortified of the two, if he felt a slight tingling, but he tried to show normal.
Clint, Thor and Bruce had fled to the main room when the blonde decided to ask about very important things about the Avengers. They only looked out when they couldn’t hear the voices, they thought that her friend had put the head of the blonde in the oven to be able to shut her up once and so she could leave there. But they didn’t see anyone, they shrugged and went back to the room to finish watching a series that the three of them had been seeing all along while they talked about Sharon's strange obsession with Cap.
To say that Tony was surprised was very little, he was in shock, he could not move any part of his body let alone talk, that had come as a surprise, a lot, he didn’t  expect to attract the Soldier and that is, who expected it? Nobody! Steve's gaze was on the brief movement of the glass that was in the dark man's hand, he looked up at Tony's perfect face and sighed deeply.
Tony stared at Carter, his words had drops of reality, but his intentions were not.  She would do everything to be with her boyfriend, everything necessary and everything that involved bad things.
Steve saw the joy that comment cultivated within Tony, and it hurt to see. Just one little bit of praise and Tony was leaning in closer to his father and chatting about his other accomplishments, like a few minutes of playing proud father would fix everything. He swallowed back his anger. It didn't matter that this Howard wasn't exactly a bad guy. He would turn into one. And he would hurt Tony. This was too little, too late as far as Steve was concerned.
Tony made a sound around Steve's cock as he pulled out again. He rasped, his abused throat fighting to make sound. "Me too,
Ah fuck. He'd said the wrong thing. "I mean, okay, not all the time, right? Or I'd never get any work done!" His attempt at humor fell flat. He flushed. "Look it's fine, all right? I'm rich, a genius, famous, and good looking," he said with his trademark media smile, "can't have all the luck, right?"
Tony looks torn. He glances at Steve's chest then over to the door and back to Steve's face. "I'll stay here. It'll take too long to get upstairs and it's only for a half hour, and I'm really hungry."
"And if Steve ever breaks your heart and you need a quick fuck to begin the healing process, I'm your man."
"That's what you took from that?" Pinching the bridge of her nose, Pepper sighed. "I count Natasha as one of my closest friends, but I hardly know you. Get a manicure with us, and maybe I'll call you by your first name."
Coming down, Tony removed his fingers and released himself, laying, for a moment, with his legs dropping to the cushions, hands splayed, and chest heaving.
Tony’s face was coloring, his elbows digging into the carpet and his arms covering his face. Steve never stopped moving within him, if anything, he went at it harder, the excitement at being caught thrilling.
Throwing his head back, he came. "Fuck! Yes! Steve!" He rode through his orgasm, loving the feel of his come coating his fingers and the velvet of his insides.
Natasha snorted at Clint's choice of words, "Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Howard."
Nipping at his jaw, Steve pulled back, again almost the whole way, and thrust forward hard, snapping his hips in and out, his balls slapping against Tony's skin,
"Opened in 1996, used to be a general store," Rhodey supplied and Tony made a face even though he knew his best friend couldn't see it. "Stop judging me," Rhodey huffed, "and don't deny it. You totally are."
"You'd be fine. You're the 'Man with the Plan.'" He spoke into Steve's chest, voice muffled, hands splayed across the firm muscles. His insecurity was showing again. Damn it.
He gives Joseph a loaded look, but the other angel just grins. "No," he says, turning back to Tony, "that was...shall I say unorthodox? We usually let mortals die as they will. But, if you remember, I did say that I had a special place in my heart for you."
it was overwhelming. His head dropped into his hands, and the sob that he let out had Natasha startled.
Steve was on the verge of giving in and Tony--Tony was gasping and rocking his hips, so close to coming that Steve knew at some point he wouldn't be able to stop him. "My little whore likes this." He grunted, his own hips starting to move up, trying to get the friction he so craved. "Then he can eat you out," he looked at Clint. "His tongue is wicked. Just like him."
"Semantics," Tony mumbled, flopping backwards on the bed and spreading his legs. He trailed a hand up his thigh and let a finger dip inside. "What do you want more? To discuss your sex life with Howard or to live it with me?"
Taking her arm again, he leads her away, his voice dimming with distance, but Steve can just pick up the trails of his conversation. "When I proposed to you, do you remember? Down by the water. And we fed the ducks! You were so worried the ring would fall off because I had bought the wrong size!"
He didn't get sick, not this time. Didn't have to run to the bathroom for one reason or another, but he did wake up clutching his stomach and head. The stabbing glass was back, and so was the migraine. He let Steve hold him--the only one allowed to when this happened--and rub soothing circles over the spot on his abdomen that hurt, the distended, bloated belly feeling almost foreign to Steve.
The look she gave him had better men running for the hills, but Tony was well adjusted to the Black Widow stare. "Just...you...both of you...UGH. Boys are stupid!"
"Yeah," Bruce was saying, he was comparing the ingredients on two packages of cookies. His cart already had the eggs and milk, and an obscenely large bag of shredded cheese. Two loaves of whole wheat bread, and a bag of bakery fresh bagels. "I just never realized exactly what's in these things."
"I'm not going to say it again, Steve," Tony responded dangerously. "I wasn't abused. Howard was a bastard, but I'm not some charity case. I don't
They get to work right away. Steve starts by packing a tight snowball and begins rolling it along the ground, gathering snow and girth; Tony starts the head. They cross paths a few times, laughing and kicking snow at each other like two teenagers without a care in the world. By the time Tony is satisfied with the smooth circumference of his snowman's head, Steve has already finished both the larger bottom of their creation and the slightly smaller midsection.
"Was it?" Tony did innocent almost too well. He reached up, on his tip toes, trying to pull the coffee out from the top shelf.
He stepped over to his team, his love, and his friends. Accepting the hugs and the pats on his back, accepting that it was okay to not be impervious to everything in the world.
"Now, listen here, honey, I'm doing all the work." Tony's hands pumped him slowly, spreading the lube evenly. "This is my show, Captain." Steve grinned, his fingers gathering some of the extra lube that had dribbled onto his groin without Tony seeing.
He doesn't remember the last time he cried this hard. Or rather, he doesn't remember the last time he allowed himself to cry this hard. It's a toss-up.
"So, what you're saying is that the good in me that traveled left the other me behind?" He glanced at Tony, "And the bad in me that-- that stayed." His eyes widened, fear overtaking them. "That stayed! Holy shit!
It had seemed so simple. It really did! Cast the spell, if Steve were alive, go and see him! Then embark on a fabulous adventure in getting Howard back with the knowledge of how to find Steve so he could bring him back earlier. Bing bang boom! A lovely time had by all.
Steve didn't have to be told twice. It wasn't often that Tony took him, both preferring the other way, but when it did, they shook with pleasure all the same.
"I was gloating because I knew you were both in love with each other!" She paused, "Also it was kinda fun watching you two suffer and flirt and not fucking realize it."
"We'd be lucky to have you, Stark," Clint says as he jogs to retrieve the arrow Tony shot. "Lord knows we need some competency with some of the shit we have to do. I trust the people, not the equipment. R&D here is a farce."
thinks Howard hates him, despite witnessing part of Steve and Howard's conversation, because he's Tony and that's what he does, and he's
That drew a laugh, and Tony let his head fall against Steve's chest. "I regret the day I ever introduced you to those movies."
They arrived just in time for the reservations, and made their way past faux cultured hipsters, more knowledgeable tourists who knew to eat off the beaten path, and locals raised on Gino's food. Natasha had requested a booth in the far corner, letting the hostess know in advance that a celebrity was coming to eat and wanted some peace. She was talking about Tony, because (it seemed) she tended to forget her face was almost just as well recognized these days.
God, it was so cliché. It was ridiculous. Pouring their hearts out when they should be fucking like rabbits. But it felt so good.
"What is it, Tony? Talk to me." He moved to step closer, but thought better of it, giving Tony a little bit of space, just for the moment.
They finished their breakfast in companionable silence, Howard taking it upon himself to wash the dishes. It was never something he did at home - he had staff for that - but it seemed the right thing to do for the woman who was offering friendship even though he would one day hurt her friend.
But Tony always did what he thought was right, regardless of how angry or upset he was. It was one of the reasons Steve fell so deeply in love with him. The media could spin things however they wanted, but Tony Stark had a moral compass that rivaled his own.
Steve stepped forward, gathering Tony into his arms. "I know it does. We have to hide in the public; we shouldn't have to hide here as well."
"You can't always protect me." He started to pull away, to escape from Steve's arms - his safety. But Steve just tugged him back easily, tucking him close to his chest.
Tony covered his face. "Jesus, Tash!" He plopped on the stool next to hers. "And does everyone know I like him?"
Clint blinked. "They make their drinks really strong, Nat. There is vodka in it." She just glared at him. "This is a Russian thing, isn't it?"
That perks Tony right up, miserable knowledge momentarily forgotten, "Big green guy? Stunning anger management issues? But also an absolutely brilliant scientist?! Really?"
"Anthony! Come, I am here to escort you inside, so that these parasites will leave you alone." Thor held out his hand, clapping it on Tony's back and guiding him. Natasha gave him a smirk.
"I'm sorry." Steve tried, stepping closer to Tony and trying to draw him into his arms. Tony scoffed and pushed away.
Except he had ended up fifty years into the future only to find out that he had a son who hated him - and rightly so! - because at some point in the next decade of his life he apparently made the decision to abuse his child.
"-You're going to find out anyway." Turning, so he was leaning against the dresser, Tony crossed his arms defensively. "It doesn't matter if it makes me- It just doesn't matter. I need to tell you."
And Tony chuckles good-naturedly. "Surveillance, equipment, computers, security, vehicles… Things like that."
Avery nodded in understanding. "You're at 137, with someone your height and previous build we'd normally recommend you to be at around 165 to 175."
Stepping back from the door, Howard gestured for Tony to enter. He felt a warmth flush up his face at being called
Maybe he shouldn't have toyed with it. Maybe he should have just walked away when he learned the conditions of the spell. That the time he was looking to go to depended on when the person next touched the enchanted object, or that there was no guaranteed way back home.
People were staring again and eavesdropping without shame. Somehow, Natasha had put him at ease enough that instead of feeling awful about it, he was indignant. Let them listen. Maybe they'd learn not to judge him so harshly!
He kissed Tony's head, moving past him to set the plates down. There were four in his hand, three in Howard's. The amount adjusted to welcome their new member, the seventh plate set down in front of the seventh chair that fit comfortably between the other six.
Steve had drawn that too. Tony's face was filled with a childlike joy that day as he had attempted to get past the break in the waves, failing over and over, never making it deeper than his thighs, laughing each time he got knocked down. Before he gave up, he threw his arms out and called to the ocean, "You win! But I'll be back!"
"Hey!" Tony stiffened and sat up, pulling from Steve's grasp harshly. "You're talking like I'm not here again!" Standing, he shrugged off Steve's attempt to tug him back down and moved away from them, his eyes hard and angry.
There was no way he was untangling himself without waking him, so: he took the easy way out. Natasha could stand to wait a few more minutes anyway.
"Oh, Tony," Rhodey lamented sadly, wrapping both arms tightly around him, "Just let it out, Tones. It's okay. I'm here now." And he wasn't leaving until Tony had both feet back on the ground.
"Tony! Let it cool a bit!" Steve admonished, taking the salt from the genius in one hand and trying to grab the mug with the other.
Steve hid his behind his beer. "This has been discussed at length, Tony hasn't had virtue in at least 30 years."
They took the stairs, jogging down to the common living room. Both sighed in unison as they watched Howard, pressed up against the glass windows like a kid staring into a department store at Christmas as Rhodey landed in the War Machine suit.
Too much to see Tony panting and gasping, chest heaving as he clung to Steve, riding out wave after wave of incredible delectation, as if the rapture had claimed him, lifting his soul high up above them as his body trembled against Steve's. Too much to feel him and his love swaying around him, enveloping Steve's entire body and soul. Too much and never enough. Steve could drink Tony like a fine red wine and never be drunk.
Tony's breaths were short, his diaphragm heaving, he was so incredibly aroused to begin with—filled with so much love already!—he didn't know how Steve could make him feel even more. But he did. When Steve pulled his fingers out and climbed up his body, Tony didn't even complain, just wrapped his arms around Steve's broad shoulders and allowed the same to be done to him.
And he was gone. Rhodey gathered Tony up, cleaned his face, tucked him into bed, and lay next to him, letting the trembling child cry on his chest until he fell asleep, exhausted and weary and still
"Why is this upsetting me?" he exploded. "Why do I even care that he's here? I didn't need him then, and I sure as fuck don't need him now!"
Pepper, who had remained silent, not wanting to interrupt the team's surprise, spoke up. "I've also got some information you may want." From the briefcase by her feet, she pulled out a pamphlet. "It's a celiac conference, in Boston. You'll need to make a statement to address all the rumors, but nothing says it has to be a press conference. I can get you in as a keynote speaker."
think you're doing what you believe is best for Tony. But that's not your decision to make." Picking at the edge of his napkin, Bruce balled it up and tossed it on the table. So much for a nice lunch. "I know what Natasha thinks is right - and that she has Clint on her side. I know that Rhodey is on the fence, but he's leaning in Nat's direction. Hell, I even know what Howard wants. All of that has been discussed
"Sir," Jarvis spoke up, about a half hour later, "Captain Rogers is in the foyer of the building. He will be in the common rooms in approximately seven minutes."
Tony relished the sound of the bed knocking against the wall, how Steve's grunts and moans picked up in volume as he neared his release, and how his own body tightened. So close, so desperate to feel himself filled, so
"I can't even be mad," Tony said around a mouth full of cookies, "I've been torturing him for years with the lascivious details of my
Steve was silent, contemplating what he was asked to do, weighing the morality of it, but also the man in front of him. He was gorgeous. Half-breed or not, Tony looked Italian, or Sicilian, he really didn't understand the difference. He had dark eyes framed by long lashes, a shorter but strong build, and lips he could pray to.
She places his file into a different container, and it pops away. "That's it! They'll have everything you need, even if you decline."
"I haven't been completely upfront with you," Coulson says, tugging Tony into a quiet corner. "Steve Rogers… Tony, Steve Rogers was one of my charges."
Bruce looked up sharply at her words, his head swinging around to look at Nat and Clint. "How did she-"
He feels Bruce's hands, gentle on his back, as he leads Steve to sit down. "It can't be true." A sniff beside him pulls Steve's attention from the television. Bruce is crying, and Steve feels his own eyes well up. "Please!" he's pleading, his voice cracking under the devastating emotions. "It
That's when he realizes that he loves Tony. It isn't lust like he had thought prior to this. Not just a schoolyard crush on the best looking kid in his class. Steve knows with a certainty that almost hurts that if Tony were the one to lose his mind - his genius! - Steve would still want to be with him. He would take care of him like the old man cares for his wife. Take him to feed the ducks. For a walk in Central Park. He'd wipe the spittle from his mouth without a second thought.
"Yeah, you are." Crossing her legs in front of her, she watched as a woman in scrubs hurried past, checking her watch. "How did you find me?"
Bruce laughed contritely at that. "No, no, the other guy is just relieved. Me too. It-- it's just a lot."
Physically turning him to face the doorway and pushing him in, she shot back, "I had to have been dumb enough to marry you in the first place for that to work."
"Thank you, JARVIS," Nat placated the AI. She didn't care if she was on anyone's bad side most of the time, but an all-knowing artificial intelligence was where she drew the damn line.
Had Rhodey known -- back then -- everything Tony would accomplish, everything he would become, all the trauma he would have to go through to get there… Well. If he were being completely honest with himself, he would have wrapped Tony up and run away with him. He would have done anything to keep him safe. Superheroes and world advancement could find someone else.
Barton didn't wait for an invitation, stepping up next to them on their right. "So pretty." His voice was strained, his hand moving quickly inside his boxers.
Tony made a face, grumbling into Steve's back, "I hate that thing. That's what we have J for," he whined.
"I can't let you do that." Sitting on the side of the bed, Steve reached out and brushed the hair from Tony's head. "A smoothie and a shower. That's all I ask. And then I'll leave you alone."
In the meantime, the incredible response I got to this fic is what made me update it so quickly. So you know. Keep going. Feed my ego like Tony's ass feeds Steve.
Laughing, Steve tugged Tony's arm. "Come on, up!" It was a testament to their relationship that Tony listened. He put his arm around the smaller man's waist, carefully guiding him to the elevator. Tony's skin felt cold to the touch. "Babe, you're
"No! I don't think you do!" She dropped her head to her hands. And here she spent years thinking she was the most damaged of all. But there were different types, weren't there? "I knew you put on a show for the media, I just didn't realize how bad it was. No wonder you refuse to see how much Steve is in love with you! You don't think you're good enough for him!"
Backing up, Steve turned and laid Tony out on his back, crawling up onto the bed with him. "I just need you right now, Tony. Please."
Howard's answering laugh was hollow. "You know me, I go in guns blazing. I don't usually have an exit strategy. I just hope something will come to me."
They were still grinning as they entered the park, no direction in mind, just headed north and enjoying each other's company. When they fell into silence, it was a comfortable one, walking side by side and taking in the beauty around them. Steve took out his phone and snapped a few pictures, awed still by the ability to do that.
"I can set you up with a nutritionist, unless you have your own, and I've printed out some information on CD for you to start with. Stay gluten free, watch the cross contamination, and you're going to be just fine."
"No can do, Howard," she answered, and before he could pester her, she said, "I'm going to wake Sleeping Beauty."
capacity. Nothing could replace the feelings he had when he was with his love. They could be homeless and living in the streets, and whatever box they lived in would still be
They looked around at each other, each more confused than the next. It was Thor, who hadn't spoken at all and Tony had almost forgotten about, who was the one to finally speak up.
Rhodey traded a loaded look with Thor, who was nearest to him, and resolutely moved behind the couch that Tony was seated on, offering silent solidarity with his best friend. Nat glanced at Clint, and seeing her own best friend looking afraid as well, she did the same, walking to stand near him. It did wonders to bolster her mood. She didn't know what she would do without them, any of them.
She sent him an appraising glance and walked first into the living room, sitting in the middle of the couch. As a female CEO of such a large company, she had to learn little ways of commanding respect and drawing attention to herself as a leader and not someone to trifle with. This was one of the ways she did that.
Leaning up, Steve reached over him to pull open one of the nightstand drawers, "Don't even try to tell me it's not in here." He sassed, grabbing the bottle of lube, He turned back to Tony, holding not only the bottle, but the dildo and the vibrator. "And what's this?"
"Like this one," flipping the book around, she showed Steve the sketch she was talking about. One of the many he had done of Tony. It was a cold day, the glass to the windows covered in the condensation from the heat of the apartment, and Tony sat against the back of his couch, head propped up with his arm, staring out through a circle he had cleared with the sleeve of his sweater. His eyes were focused on something far away, something no one else could see, and the beautiful deep mahogany of his irises was closed over with sadness.
and they've decided to amplify his fears of being alone as a punishment. The tacky white walls are just a bonus. But up ahead, the second to last door on the right is opening, and Yinsen is stepping out.
Steve's eyes light up, studying their creation, and he snaps his fingers. "I know!" He unwinds his scarf- "Poor guy looks cold. Let's warm him up," -and wraps it around the snowman's neck. "And maybe someone who needs it can come and take it."
"Well, that's just great." He stood, lifting out of the chair with an ease he didn't feel. "JARVIS, I don't suppose you didn't already warn Tony I was coming, did you?"
