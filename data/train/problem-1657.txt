"Jesus," John sighed.
Having never believed it was possible meant he'd never thought over whether it was something he would want. He felt foolish. He hadn't thought it through. He was imagining picking out plates and eating breakfast late on Saturdays and the little play fights over the table and he hadn't even thought it through.
Five harrowing hours later, and Sherlock and John were sitting on the kerb waiting for medical attention next to DI Hopkins. They were all a bit banged up, but their excitement after making the arrest wasn't dampened.
Sherlock grinned, goofy and too large, and John took that as a yes, leading Sherlock to turn around and wait with him for the lift.
John couldn't stay in the hospital any longer. He was only there because he'd been doing intensive physio, anyhow. He had to, he had to bloody leave.
Sherlock swallowed and looked at the floor. And...that was annoying.
Molly walked out after him, grin spreading across her face. "You're my hero, Sherlock Holmes. Ballads should be written about you!"
"Why?" Greg asked, suddenly very uneasy.
“Of course, I could take the sofa, if-“ Jane continued, nervously.
"You'll spend the night?" Sherlock asked.
That was the problem. He needed to be seen as uncaring, had developed the façade of indifference over so many years that when he realised he no longer wanted it he felt a fool. He couldn't just change his entire being. He couldn't change because of one man. The risk was too high.
Greg let himself be pulled close and lay against his chest barely breathing. He knew the realisation of the circumstance would come soon. And there it was. Mycroft stilled and his muscles tensed.
Mike stood at that, concern all but frothing out of him, and walked a bit closer to the door. He closed it behind Sherlock and spoke. “What do you mean, you’re off caffeine?”
Sherlock continued in and up the stairs, not even breaking pace as she spoke. "You could see that? Interesting."
"Smells like..." Sally said, confused, "yes, I know him. He's a pain in the arse. Don't know about the vanilla, though."
John.
"Take those expensive trousers off before you wrinkle them, you posh git," Greg said, tearing at the laces on Mycroft's shoes and pulling them off to fling across the room.
"I suppose you're as thrilled as I am to be here," John said, sipping his coffee.
_____
"Why?" Greg asked.
"But, that was...alright?" Sherlock asked, nervous smile making John want to kiss him again.
He was reminded of spring coming to Narnia in a book he read years before, and tried not to pay too much attention to how romantic a thought it was. 'You aren't a frozen land under an evil spell,' he reminded himself, 'you're just an idiot in an unhappy marriage. No one is coming to save you. There is no spell to break.'
"A jazz club," John said quickly, telling the closest thing to the truth that he could.
Sherlock's eyes went wide before he was able to school his appearance. "Why, Doctor. Is that any way to speak in public?" he asked, going for teasing humor but coming across more than a bit breathy.
It was overwhelming, like the second one realises they've tripped, right before they begin to fall. Like knowing things have taken a sudden turn and not being able to change that.
That sort of thing happens when you're preparing to go practice medicine in a war zone.
Sherlock massaged his back slowly.
Men never liked her countenance, wanting her to be softer around the edges, not so bloody masculine. The ones she had dated, before giving that up completely, needed to be comfortable enough in their masculinity to appreciate a woman with war stories and a lack of housekeeping skills. Unfortunately, those men tended to be army themselves, and took the whole 'be a man' thing a bit too seriously.
"You're the vicar," Sherlock said, and then when there was no light of recognition in John's eyes, "if anyone understands motive, it's you. What else is confession if not a study in that?"
John sat back in his seat and laughed. "How? With that thing you did? The bit where you could tell the bloke was cheating?"
_____
Jane opened it and smelled it, letting her eyes slide closed, and Sherlock watched as her eyelashes fluttered. It was, for a moment, as if she were dreaming.
Hope you guys liked this one. Somehow it turned out shorter than I'd first assumed it would, but this is the end. Hope to see you on the next one.
"Downstairs."
John was the first to laugh, it spilling out of him in giggles, but Sherlock joined soon after.
"Give me a chance to bugger it all up, won't you?" John asked.
"Would you like to be very good for me, now?" John asked, ignoring the voice in his head that told him this was much too pleasurable.
John closed his laptop and listened to see if he could tell of Sherlock was still awake. He couldn't hear anything so he slipped his laptop onto the bedside table and pulled the covers up, willing sleep to come.
"Mmm," Sherlock agreed. "Solved a case for her a year back. She was under the impression that I no longer enjoyed her cooking. The truth is, I hardly have time for anything other than delivery."
"And you," Sherlock murmured, eyes flitting back and forth between John's lips and eyes.
"Yeah, I know. What do you want?" Greg asked, shifting his hips and hating the way his cock always took interest when his boss used those leather clad hands of his to smooth down the front of his jacket.
John nodded.
"John," Sherlock asked, breaking the little bubble of self loathing John had stuck himself in.
COLD TEMPERATURES LOWER THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, YOU BERK. THAT COUPLED WITH YOUR HORRENDOUS SLEEPING HABITS, AND I'LL BE SURPRISED IF YOU AREN'T SNIFFLING AWAY BY MORNING.
"Hmm?" Sherlock asked.
He wanted to leave, he wanted-
Sherlock frowned at that, angry that his inner voice always took on his brother when it said what he really already knew.
"I know what I said," Sherlock hissed, nose scrunching up. "Still not fair of you to take the option off the table."
At dinner that night Sherlock interrogated the man and went about picking apart his alibi until the man sobbed and tried to apologise. The egg was returned the next day and Mr Tollance was more grateful than he could say.
"Detective Inspector Lestrade," Mycroft said, face void of any emotion, "would you be so kind as to join me for a drink?"
They didn't speak for the whole of the ride and John began to wonder again whether he'd ever see Sherlock after the conference.
I don't believe you'd be useless muscle. I could always use another pair of hands. Strangely enough, I don't believe I've ever said that to anyone in my life. You make me think such peculiar things.
Jane sighed sat back, crossing her legs and staring up at the woman. "And," she asked, "does there have to be a reason for everything?"
Sherlock settled with John's soft attention and they were soon brought back to kissing. It was slow and loving as John ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair. When he started giggling into Sherlock's mouth, the genius drew back to look at him questioningly, face mottled and streaked with tears.
'He's not the person you were in love with,' he told himself silently as he made his way up the stairs. 'You were in love with a lie. It doesn't matter that the lie was comfortable. You can't trust him.'
"We don't need your help," Anderson whinged, crossing his arms and leaning against one of the stalls.
"Fancy handkerchief?" Greg asked, holding a hand up.
"Ms Watson," Sherlock said, softer than before, but still with an edge of teeth, "I will endeavor to surprise you."
"I have a feeling you want me to imagine some sort of evil party," John said.
Sherlock appraised him, eyes narrowed, and disagreed. "I don't think so. I think we've just got to sneak into the kitchen and bring lunch back up here. The weather has cleared and we won't see another mild day like this for a while."
"Apparently, we don't need central heating. It's only a matter of keeping you happy," Sherlock teased, his voice closer to normal.
It had been a year to the day since he’d been sent back to London with nothing but a near-fatal bullet wound in his shoulder and the memory of the man who dragged him to the rescue copter playing on repeat in his head. A year spent working (fighting) with a slew of therapists to pick out all the other recurring memories and suffocate them, so that only the one moment remained. That moment, and only that moment.
"Do you reckon any of this is from you?" he asked, looking up to John's face to read his lips.
John wasn't in a good mood when he ran into Mike. He was leaning heavily on a cane, side still giving him trouble, and trying to get somewhere he could sit down so he could drink his bloody coffee.
"Therefore tremble, O man, at any power thou hast, except thou usesest it for God," John pressed.
"Suppose I leaned on my pruning shears," Sherlock explained.
"Strangely like-able. Sort of brilliant. Madman?" Sherlock asked, not looking up from his mobile.
Sherlock paced. The case was good, nearly a seven, and he wanted badly for John to be there with him. There was something he couldn't parse about it, something only a doctor would see. He didn't want Molly. He wanted John.
"I was going to meet everyone there. Christ, love, they're waiting on us. Let's wash that pretty face of yours and go," John said, relaxing a bit, which was always a mistake around an emotional Sherlock.
Sherlock wiggled his bum and smiled. John chuckled softly.
_____
Sherlock hummed and watched as Jane cleaned the small cut that was almost obscured by the angry skin, and applied some salve. The cream was cold and caused Sherlock to pull her hand back a bit at the touch, but she relaxed again and Jane was able to place a plaster over the area before letting go of her wrist.
"You seemed rather close just then," Sherlock countered, eyebrow raised.
"Catching robbers?" John asked as the tea and baijiu was brought their way.
The next morning Sherlock woke to a knock on the bedroom door. He got out of bed, grumbling, and opened it to find Mrs H standing on the other side.
He tailed John carefully all the way to the roof and watched him drinking whiskey straight from the bottle for a few long minutes before he made his move.
One box of tea, the kind his parents had liked when he was young
"What's rude?" John shot back, wishing more than ever that he could be heard. "Is that you just expect me to-"
He kissed back, hard, fingers clutching at John's arms as he was embraced. He let his arms wrap around John's waist and remove the pistol from its hiding place, dropping it on the small table by the door. John pulled back, out of breath, and looked to where it had been set.
"Well, it's a good thing I'm headed all the way up, or I'd miss the chance to see you go," the man replied.
Sherlock rocked against him and sucked on his bottom lip and soon they were coming in their pants and kissing more slowly. That thought, though, wouldn't come to fruition in Sherlock's mind.
Sherlock huffed and the man turned back to John with a slight nod, and left.
"Threatening my brother with a night under my roof? You knew he'd say no to it," Mycroft said, crossing his arms.
'Don't fret,' DoctorJohn said. 'We'll meet soon enough.'
"You've caught my attention, isn't that compliment enough?" Sherlock asked, looking completely certain it was.
Partway to the Yard, the skies broke and rain started to fall. It was rush hour, and even Sherlock couldn't seem to get a cab. By the time he made it to the front of the building his hair was soaked. He shook his whole body in an attempt to dry off, walked in, looking very much the wet kitten, and scowled at each glance he got.
Greg looked over his shoulder at a group of people leaving the office and Mycroft stiffened, wondering, not for the first time, if Greg might be a bit ashamed of him.
"Always interested to see what comes out in the rain," Sherlock replied. "I'll walk."
Sherlock looked him over, tried to parse out what was keeping the man so surprising. It was as if he was rolling a particularly good sweet around on his tongue, lips pursed and mouth working slightly as he tried for a response. John, urged on by that, raised an eyebrow.
He pushed John Watson and something in the man pushed back. Blasted. He'd been right on his first assessment; the man was interesting.
"Oh, left mine in my office, sorry," Mike answered. "But I've got someone here, who-"
"When did you get out of the military?" he asked, forgetting to be anyone other than himself.
"You out chasing down more baddies for us?" the man teased.
"Are you even watching the movie?" Sherlock asked with a nervous snort.
Sherlock’s mind was spinning like mad. Stringing together pieces of information so quickly that Sherlock honestly had no idea what sort of revelation he was about to have.
Four months into their relationship John told Sherlock something Sherlock thought he'd never hear.
Sherlock took a deep breath, and refused to hold anything back. John, and only John, had asked him months ago for his truth, so he would have it.
So, here goes. And tell me if you never want to hear from me again, yeah? Just so I know. So I'm not just waiting forever.
She watched Sherlock leave with the solvent in hand and slammed the milk down on the conveyor belt. The checker's eyes lingered on Sherlock's back for a second before he looked back. Jane sneered at him and he quickly rang up the milk and the packet of biscuits. Jane ran her card through too quickly, twice, and finally just pressed it into his hand, cursing under her breath.
Mycroft and Greg's dinner went well and by the time they were relaxing back in their seats and sharing a cannoli Mycroft had managed to gather enough courage to clarify things.
-Excerpt from John Watson's blog-
John pushed him back onto the sofa and started in on his trousers. Sherlock did his best to assist as his mind spun, lifting his hips and legs in turn so John could pull his trousers and pants off completely.
"I'm wholly unsuited to relationships, not to mention polite company," Sherlock added. "But I want to know you. I enjoy your company."
Angry at himself for stalling, he took a breath, and typed.
Sherlock sat up straight just then and looked at John, eyebrows knit. "But, surely you've felt this before. With Mary-"
"I didn't," Sherlock said, pulling a keycard from his pocket and sticking it into the door next to John's.
John stared at Sherlock.
"Change?" Sherlock asked.
John did indeed watch as the double doors closed behind Sherlock before turning back to Greg to continue speaking. "So I was wondering if I could just take one of his books from the display."
"I didn't pull away."
John cocked an eyebrow. "And you won't be leaving books all about, now, will you?"
"Maybe we'll save the onion for pudding," John said with a smirk, setting it aside.
John walked over and sat on the edge of one of the small beds. "It's not fashion week. No one will care that we're wearing the same shirt."
"I may be moving back in a few months," Sherlock said, smiling softly at their looks of joy and wondering what John would think of his gaggle of street children, "with a friend of mine."
"I, uh, think there are some stories that just need to be told," Jane choked out. "Your class looked like the most comprehensive."
They sat next to each other without saying a word for the whole day. Sherlock watched somewhat impatiently as a slow trickle of readers came up to greet John. They were all women, most around middle age, and acted as if John were some handsome man they were secretly dating. They watched Sherlock out of the corner of their eye as he glared at them. It only occurred to sherlock later on that they might have thought him jealous.
It was at that very moment that someone walked in the open door. A tall man with broad shoulders and a strong chin. A tall man whose eyes were glued to his mobile. Sherlock's own eyes rolled back in her head so hard her whole head bobbed for a moment.
"I'm sorry that you had to hear about my blog post like this-" John tried, moving from foot to foot and keeping his eyes on the ground.
Sherlock's face softened a bit and his hand hovered just next to John's shoulder. "What's wrong?"
“You have stories to tell,” Sherlock replied, going to the far cabinet and bringing out a bottle of amber liquid and mismatched shot glasses on a small tray. “So tell them, Watson.”
Victor had been the same way after the accident, needing sound at all times, even if he wasn't paying attention. Silence was suspicious to him, and Sherlock learned in that last few weeks how to properly tune out the radio while still picking up on interesting bits of information.
At lunch, to stop himself from calling Sherlock to see how he was doing, John logged on and checked his comment section. His story had been up for a while and there were the usual comments, the ones that kept him posting, and then one he hadn't expected. ANONYMOUS. And surely it wasn't his Anonymous, not the one he talked to, because he had stopped posting comments once they'd picked up correspondence through email.
"Good men," Mrs H replied. "Now, I'm going to get your things ready for the cab. Your man is on the phone."
Sherlock sighed. "What does a person have to do to get a cup of tea around here?"
"Okay, drama queen," John said, "I'll be right over."
The local spot was packed with people and John thought he felt his hackles rise as he stepped into the long line.
"Shit," John cursed, head falling forward and hand going to his brow. "It's at the bedsit. Is there time to stop by?"
“God’s hands,” he muttered to himself with a small grunt as he started to make his way to the cramped loo.
"Things only ever went downhill," he said, voice so soft he wasn't sure he'd spoken at all.
Sherlock waved her hand and sat back. "That was before I decided what to do with you."
He needed to go see Lestrade. There was nothing else for it.
John was sitting up in bed, the fresh sheets soft and cool against his skin. He sent the email seconds before and was waiting for a reply, mobile tight in his hand. It had only been a few days since he'd received the email with the request. 'Ruin me again,' anonymous had said.
It was a fair question, after all, even though she left off the word gay. The way she said it, Sherlock knew it wasn't meant as an insult. She was incompetent and didn't like Sherlock, but she wasn't homophobic.
Sherlock pressed in, chest tightening with the love he felt for John.
(Jane brushing her thumb across the edge of the plaster softy to make sure it had stuck, thumb pressing against her palm.)
Sherlock couldn't help the small sway of his hips, and soon found himself rushing forward to bury his face against John's neck. "You horrible man. Don't tell a soul."
Sherlock flushed and paid, scurrying to the back of the small shop and setting up his work. Which he would have started if he hadn't tasted the coffee. It was awful.
He paused after the last sentence, and added a bit more.
"Oh, come now, you know what I mean. They're unrealistic, and the acting is terrible," Sherlock replied, feeling a bit silly for asking. Of course John wouldn't want to watch a stupid movie with him, and he wouldn't even enjoy it, so-
"Rude," she stated, fluttering away, "simply rude."
"You've just met me," Sherlock said softly, "yet you seem so sure."
_____
"Nothing much," John said, pulling away and getting his coat.
"It was a truly idiotic move. My brother is one of John Watson's readers," Mycroft said, filling the word with vitriol, "and has what he won't admit is a small crush on the man. Putting them together will encourage that crush and giving into sentiment is the last thing my brother needs at this point. He's fragile enough as it is."
Jesus Christ, if I'm being forward, I've fallen in love with you. I'm in love with you and you're so far away and before I left, I barely knew you. Now I feel like I know the real you. Please don't take that away from me.
"The man was leaving the building and you just so happened to know that he was our killer? Without even seeing the case?" the tired man across from them said skeptically.
"Me?" John huffed, hating the warmth he now felt in his chest. Why he should feel pride over that, he didn't know.
"You can tell me anything," John said as he opened the door, the sound of nature's evening activity pulling him out along with Sherlock to stand awkwardly on the front porch.
"God, no," the man said, the blasphemy not missed by John. "The morgue attendant owed me a favor."
"It was more...hero worship than romance," Sherlock said, smiling a bit.
John laughed at that, the paper hospital shirt Sherlock was wearing billowing at it. When Sherlock finally looked up into his eyes he was sure he was going to die again from pure happiness.
The air was suddenly pulled from Jane's lungs, and before she could find the words to stop the whole charade, Sherlock was leaning over the counter and furrowing her brow and saying something in that husky voice that Jane couldn't make out through the rushing in her ears. The lunacy, the idiocy of it all, was that the flirting wasn't even near believable. It was too much, over the top in the way pornography portrays women's attraction.
"Oh, god. Oh, god," Sherlock repeated, leaning down to nuzzle John's neck and opening his mouth against it, breath warm and humid. "I can smell you and it's divine! Oh, John."
The air in the room was filled with energy as students looked back and forth to see what on earth was going to happen next.
"The hip. Can't seem to stay asleep," she explained.
"Last night was surprising," Sherlock said, hands shaking.
John brushed Sherlock's hair from his brow and let his hand settle in the short curls at Sherlock's nape. His eyes were so focused that Sherlock felt as if he couldn't breathe.
"Mmm," Sherlock replied, unable to even open her mouth properly.
"Not like that," Sherlock sighed, refusing the marker. "Write something bad. Cock, or arsehole. Write Sherlock is an arsehole."
"A percentage of every case we take," Sherlock agreed.
"The call can wait," William said, concerned expression on his face as he looked John up and down. "The injury is still giving you trouble, and-"
"What, together?" Greg asked, brow furrowed.
"Charming," he said, sipping his tea.
Sherlock let his eyes fall from those lips and to the table. "I'm a consulting detective. Only one in the world. When the police are out of their depths, which is always, they come to me."
'Hardly a legitimate diagnosis,' the patient replied, voice low and gravely.
The end of a perfect day for Sherlock and John and the beginning of a tense night for Greg and Mycroft.
"Between Mike and myself," Sherlock said, pushing his plate back and crossing his arms.
And, yes, that did it. Enough of a sigh out of Sherlock that he detached from John's neck. John managed to lean down and catch his lips, pulling his face up so he could kiss the man properly, and feeling him start to grind on his thigh.
"The Director?" she asked, wanting to drag it out as long as possible.
He had finished his drink and was running the edge of the glass slowly over his bottom lip when John finally walked up next to him. He smelled the man before he saw him and swayed in his direction.
"Stupidly," Sherlock added, giggling a little.
Jane pulled her hand back and tried to focus on her meal.
The woman looked up and stood a bit eagerly. "H-have you then?"
Everyone cheered and Mycroft rolled his eyes.
"But?" She pressed, taking a seat across from him and sipping primly.
Sometimes, horribly romantic things happen in public loos. Not often, of course, but sometimes, just sometimes, they do. Sherlock knew that, as knowing things about human behavior was of great importance to his job, but never in a million years did he suspect he might be involved in one of those situations.
John sighed and opened the crisps. "And now, you're here. Stuck with the rest of us poor fools. Don't worry, though, you're not the only one here who has to shoulder the blame."
'John,
And what an arse to be so jovial whilst Sherlock was aching for someone to touch him.
And that was when she came across it; a building painted an almost blinding black, and overflowing with plants. She tried to look through the front window of the shop, but leaves and vines and peculiar flowers clogged the view. The sign above the door, carefully printed gold on black, said open, so she hobbled her way in, stepping over plants along the way and cursing under her breath.
John finally looked him in the eye. He was...an arsehole. Yes, pretty, fine, but an arsehole. He got a sneer for his appraisal and John pulled the plastic chair out with a loud scrape.
Sherlock's eyelids fluttered closed and John turned to pour the water.
"Yours," Sherlock agreed. "Please, John."
"I'm well aware," Sherlock said, leaning forward and resting his arms on the desk. He let his legs slip as far apart as he could manage with his trousers around his ankles and waited.
The pain was everywhere. He was surrounded by flames, waist deep in burning sand. He smelled sulfur and heard them crying out, crying out for-
Greg woke first the next morning, his silent alarm buzzing next to him on the bed. He brushed his hand across Mycroft's back before he even realised what was going on. When he did his chest seemed to constrict and he grinned like a madman. He let his hand linger on Mycroft's skin for a moment before carefully extricating himself and turning his alarm off on the way to the loo.
Sherlock's mouth formed a shocked 'o' and John chuckled at it, reaching up to brush his hair from his brow.
The therapist that spoke with him at the hospital told him it would just take time to get used to it, it would take time to absorb it into his identity until it didn't stick out in his mind. Perhaps, he thought, he shouldn't have started a relationship this quickly after being discharged.
"Un-negotiable," Sherlock shot back, standing a bit taller and obviously feeling more himself.
"Just about, yeah," John said, pulling in a breath and lurching forward to slap the lid closed on the thing and grab his coat.
_____
If the sex had only been half as good he would have managed to stay awake a bit to regret things, but instead he was fast asleep within minutes, snoring softly into the curve of Sherlock's neck, and not dreaming of a damn thing.
"You're gorgeous," John said, rolling his hips. "Absolutely gorgeous."
"Wonderful," he murmured, hunger rolling through him as if often did after an orgasm.
Sherlock moved down the bed and bent to inspect John's prick closely. John steadied himself for his lips and instead saw him wave his hand in an agitated manner.
"Neighbor," Jane interrupted forcefully. She saw the small frown crawl it's way onto Sherlock's lips, but stood with the statement. Second person in one day that thought they were 'close' like that.
Sherlock shifted in his chair a bit. "Can't risk it. You know it's full of people who are leaking all manner of bodily fluids. If I get taken with something and end up in bed for a week, what do you think will happen to the criminal class?"
A lump grew in John's throat. His sister. Oh, shite, how had his sister got the phone number of the vicarage? He'd thought it was the best of lies.
"Deeply. Voraciously. Unendingly," John replied softly. "I love you more than I thought I could."
"I'm the first," Sherlock interrupted. "I'm the first person you've ever loved."
His lonely doctor ended up sitting in a coffee shop flirting with a nurse.
_____
Sherlock sighed and was happy that the bell chose that moment to ring. "Yes, Molly. That's you."
"F-five years," Sherlock said, and yes, now he could see it in his mind; Victor sitting across from him, smiling sweetly. Their first date, that Sherlock had planned. How lovesick he'd been, how foolishly romantic. "Married on Valentine's Day."
John nodded solemnly. "Mmm. Plenty. Enough for a lifetime."
It was raining again. Not on the forecast, but it was London after all. Greg walked at a brisk pace, that day's newspaper held over his head and coat collar up. What he really wanted was a smoke. Sherlock had been acting odd again, talking to someone who wasn't there, and no matter how Greg had tried to persuade his team into looking the other way, he met resistance.
"There's quite a bit of blood," Sherlock murmured, it seeped from between his fingers, hot and slick.
"It's, it's, physically impossible, sir," Sherlock giggled, obviously beyond using any sort of filter.
"Who's back together?" John asked, not following at all.
"So you were looking for someone pushy?" Sherlock snorted.
"Don't make me repeat myself," Sherlock sighed.
"Let me," Mycroft said, shaking a bit, "let me do this. I don't do enough for him. I can't be the confidant he needs, can't be the comfort. You do that quite well, so...let me be the purse. God knows he doesn't get paid for his little escapades with the police."
Sherlock chewed his lip and shrugged. "I'm almost always bored."
"I'm sorry?" Mycroft sputtered.
John rolled his eyes, embarrassment flowing through him. "Nothing."
Greg laughed and she ruffled his hair.
His thoughts came to a stumbling stop as John took his cock in hand and stroked it as he lipped at the head. John saw that happen, saw Sherlock's attention shift to him, and grinned, licking at his prick and taking the head into his mouth.
"So it was obvious who had done it," Sherlock said, slurring a bit now as sleep and champagne played keep away with his diction.
John snorted and ran a hand through his hair. "Online, actually. Had no clue we'd been working in the same building for two years."
Sherlock pulled back and looked him in the eye quite seriously. "I'd break you out."
Toby managed to get a good hold on the leather cover and Sherlock felt the two or three pages he could scramble for rip; just a pathetic few triangles of blank margin left in his hands as he stumbled out it Toby’s grip.
"You're going to be quiet for me now, aren't you? Be my gorgeous man, let me take you apart without anyone knowing. Do you need something to suck on? You rather liked my fingers."
John leaned back against the tree, unbuttoning the front of his shirt and waving the placards to get some air circulation against his hot skin. Sherlock looked at the bit of skin revealed at the neck of his vest as if it were a difficult task to not reach out and touch it.
"I suppose I just don't like reading about the Major," Sherlock replied, somehow forgetting that he was meant to be in trouble due to how painfully jealous he was.
Sherlock rummaged loudly through the cabinets and finally pulled out two mugs, setting them on the counter with a thunk. "Well, yes, but I was in charge. I was the one who knew how things were meant to happen. I KNEW there was a possibility of danger and I let him come anyway."
Sherlock admired the man, admired his choice to move into the middle of nowhere and fall off the map. If Sherlock himself were a better man, he thought, less bound to the entertainment of the city, he would do the same.
And so...he left. He made it to the car before breaking into sobs, and drove back to London with tears still rolling down his face.
"Nonsense," Sherlock countered. "You're a busy man, you have places to be."
By the time that John had made it back up the stairs, needing a few horrifying minutes to be able to control his limbs again, Sherlock was laying on his side in bed with his arms wrapped around his knees. He looked so small, folded in on himself.
Greg looked up, shocked, and Mycroft simply raised his eyebrows and waited for a response.
He was. He was incredibly jealous. He'd never even had a real friend. It occurred to him early on that his soulmate would have to be his friend, would possibly even want that.
"Goodnight, Dr Watson," he murmured, ringing off and walking starkers into the kitchen to do a little research on the good doctor.
John, full of adrenalin with nowhere to go, spoke loudly.
"I hate these things, you know," John said, wilting a bit at the admission.
The man was conflicted, shifting in his seat and trying to appear as if he wasn't looking out the window. Sherlock had seen this before, of course, but this time there was something different. He told Tommy he would speak with him about the case the next day and pushed his way to the front of the queue. There were a few disgruntled noises, but once they saw who was doing the pushing that all dropped away.
Two hours later, ties loose and tongues looser, Sherlock and John floated around the dance floor. DI Hopkins sidled up to her date and, never having seen Sherlock and John off a case, asked the question burning its way through her mind.
"Jesus," John said, panting against Sherlock's ear. "I haven't, that is, I didn't know I could, JESUS!"
"The bastard was about to hit you. You can't tell me you didn't see it coming," John huffed, somehow more amused than annoyed.
"Good," Sherlock sighed happily, closing his eyes.
All of the air had been sucked from Sherlock's lungs and he sat there barely breathing. John was in Kandahar. John was in danger.
"I didn't know what you wanted so I got-" Sherlock said, bursting in as John was just settling onto the bed. His eyes grew wide as he looked around the room. "What have you...why..."
"Just a few bites here, for you," Mrs H said, pointing to the sitting room table at a plate covered in foil before she grabbed the sopping coat.
"I know that now, you git," John said, pulling back and grinning up at him.
"I...I'm to blame as well," he said, pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes. "I can't be the man she wants, I can't..."
"Doesn't matter. Well, as long as my hypothesis is right," Sherlock replied, pushing the tea closer to John and watching him raptly.
Sarah was surprising, funny, and odd. That combination, along with what he remembered of her good looks, had him feeling like bragging. It was quite the turn of luck. Now all he had to do was interest her back. He looked at the last line, a simple request for another letter, and the sloppy 'S' she signed, and grinned anew.
"You're...sticking around?" John asked, reaching to the floor for his pants and standing on shaky legs.
'I thought you liked to be pushed, John,' the patient said, smile licking at the corners of his lips.
"Used to belong to the last vicar," the housekeeper, though she called herself something else, had said. "He left in a rush. Interesting fellow. Wouldn't have done well populating the world, if you know what I mean."
No, he really shouldn't.
"Do it for science," Sherlock insisted, pulling the stick from the water, "your long lost love."
"Actually, yes," John said, looking to the floor.
Mrs Hudson paused. "I apologise for frightening you away the other day. I can be a bit presumptuous."
"Um, no," John said sitting back down again.
John gave Greg a withering look and Greg held his hands up.
'It was very nice to get such a thorough list of questions, and while you deserve answers to them, I'm not sure I'm the person you should be asking. I know it's difficult to ask your parents about things like sex. I would suggest speaking to your doctor. You can ask to see them without your parents permission if you live in the UK. Although I would like to tell you to continue reading my work, this site is really meant for adults. Please don't take that as an insult.'

Sherlock stopped in front of the man and woman and smiled at them. He turned to look at the necklace that John assumed the man was trying to steal. It was elegant and studded with stones. John had a feeling they weren't paste.
The porter continued to speak but Sherlock's entire being was focused on John. He was good with his hands, very good, and was soothing the woman even as his instruments pulled at her skin. One of the boys sidled up to Sherlock and cocked his head. Sherlock glanced down at him for a moment and then back to John.
"I need to see him," John said, tears welling in his eyes. "He's my partner. I was there when he was shot! God, I need to see him!"
"Well, yes, but he was terrible back!" Sherlock replied.
That, of course, as is so often the way, was when Greg Lestrade entered the scene. He burst through the door, already speaking, and came upon a scene that could have been painted in oil, a scene brazenly speaking of seduction.
_____
(When she did drift back home, she was was rougher around the edges and no longer avoiding her father's fists.)
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sauntered over, taking the digestive from her once he'd removed one of his gloves and chewing it quickly. Mrs Hudson looked over his shoulder and seemed to see John watching them. She gave a little wave and John left, embarrassed and not sure why.
"Ah, yes," Sherlock said with a blubbering chuckle. "You are always so careful with your money. Avoiding any extravagance."
"Hey," John murmured, catching Sherlock's eye. "Hey, you alright?"
Freedom.
"You're always thinking," John replied.
John looked up at him. Pushy. Pushy and eager to truly know someone. It was something he feared he should discourage in the man, but found he couldn't. "On the contrary, I came back to God after living a life of vice. I'm not stupid, you know, it occurs to me that they will possibly engage in whatever I warn against. I simply believe, unlike others, that they should know the consequence before experiencing it, though sometimes that does nothing to deter the act that brings it."
He bit his lip and held his breath and tried as much as he could to not make a sound, still in the that post sleep adrenalin filled moment that most veterans know. He swore he could hear rough breathing from the other side of the wall. From where Sherlock's bed was situated.
"Ready?" John asked, leaning forward and rubbing himself against Sherlock's hole.
Jane had a half hour before she was to meet the solicitor at the flat. She decided to go ahead of time and spend a little while checking out the neighborhood. She got all the way down the street before she realised she'd forgot her cane.
"Tobacco ash," William blurted.
John hushed him again and held him close. "You're a little worked up. You get that way sometimes, don't you?"
It was much later than Mrs Hudson stayed up and the whole of the building was cast in shadow. John helped Sherlock up the stairs, his daypack over his shoulder and swaying as he did, and into the flat. It was crowded and lived in, something John never seemed to manage at any of his previous flats, including the bedsit.
Sherlock was sat on the floor, back leaned against the wall next to the door between his and John's rooms, with his laptop open. There were more civilized ways to do it, of course, but he found himself listening through the door and tapping the reload button over and over. It had been hours since they last spoke and Sherlock was beginning to wonder if John would write up his blog at all that night. He chewed his lip and pinned one last stray curl off his forehead and nearly jumped when the page reloaded with a new post.
The water sloshed around a bit as Sherlock turned over, and they ended up just listening to the other breathe for a while.

If Mycroft let himself feel, out in the open, let himself be SEEN feeling, and Greg changed his mind down the road he would be broken.

Sherlock did something particularly brilliant with his tongue and John heard his cane fall to the floor. He didn't even think, he just gripped Sherlock's shirt at the waist and pulled him closer, his thigh slotting between those gorgeously long legs and pressing.
But he'd sent the sketches. He'd sent the sketches and said he'd enjoyed the last description of a case.
"Everyone is interested in our relationship," Sherlock replied, face blank, "but no one has bothered you this much before."
"Yes, well, I suppose we can hold off on complete condemnation for now," Sherlock said, unfolding and towering above John, holding a hand out.
"That's, that's a question for another-" Sherlock tried.
Sherlock scoffed and stared resolutely at the ground. "No."
"I hate tuna. You know I hate tuna," Sherlock answered, picking at his sleeve as if embarrassed to admit it.
"I didn't mean for it to be...romantic," John said.
'This is it,' it seemed to say, 'He's the real deal. Don't bugger this up, Watson.'
“Mikey,” he ground out, wondering how long he had drifted for, “ta.”
"Why wouldn't I?" John asked, trying to cover the fact that he wasn't sure why he wanted to in the first place with verbal surety.
"I know you're there," Sherlock added, wiggling his fingers. "I honestly don't see why we can't just work together."
He only let himself look them over once he was comfortably secured in the back seat of a cab and on his way to Baker Street, and even then, only after he'd looked through all the cold cases. Interesting to look at all that text and not be able to read a single word.
"Good." The prior smiled apologetically. "Some people come here and don’t know what they are getting into or what it means to take a contemplative time out, so I rather put things straight from the beginning."
. John felt a shiver run down his spine.  The touched the transcript of the phone call and thought of the words he’d heard just before Sherlock jumped. His stomach clenched at the memory of standing on the pavement, being struck by the bicyclist, staggering up to try to reach Sherlock, fighting his way through the crowd, taking Sherlock’s wrist, looking into his lifeless eyes. He downed the rest his beer in a gulp, trying to summon the courage to pick up the pages.
The surgery had been short staffed that day. John’s scheduled four hour shift stretched into eight, then he’d offered to stay for the second shift - they could certainly use the money. He’d been so rushed all day, he hadn’t even had time to check in via text to see what Sherlock had gotten up to. Later, when John came home to a dark flat and missing flatmate, he wasn’t too concerned.  Sherlock had survived without him for two years in much more dangerous circumstances than London at eleven p.m. on a Tuesday. After a bite to eat, he settled into bed with his laptop and a cold beer.
Jonah ...
ghost pain of hands
He’d just finished preparing the veg slaw when he heard Sherlock go from the bathroom into the bedroom. John thought about calling out to him to not bother dressing in anything except pyjamas but the oven timer buzzed and John busied himself with finishing preparing the meal.
"Get your own life in order before you give advice to other people."
Frank picked up the cigar and took a few puffs, obviously considering his options.
"You shouldn’t be," he replied and immediately regained his familiar smile. "If this would not have happened, I would never know how much the love of God can change a person, if you are willing to indulge Him wholeheartedly. I had nothing to lose and have gained so much ... "
The day after his 18th birthday, Sherlock knocked on the clinic director’s office door. Without waiting for an invitation, he turned the knob and let himself in. Dr. Hines, the Director, stood in alarm.
“John?”
I was not sure if the friar wanted to make fun of me or whether he really wanted to help me.
Sherlock spoke at last. “John’s planning an attempt at reconciliation at Christmas.” He flicked his hand dismissively. “Holiday sentiment and all that will be on his side.”
He sighed.
“No!” Sherlock nearly screamed.  “No, I don't want to go home.” He sprang from the chair, staring around wildly for a method of egress. The locked door was the only exit from the windowless office. “Frank, don’t send me home. I can help you in your business. I can, I can help you with this Jim who’s after you. Just don’t send me home.”
When he finally got back home to England, he’d grown out his hair quite long to spite his tight-laced brother. Later it became a moot point when his family cut off his generous allowance and he drifted from one flop house to another, going where he could trade his skills for a fix, not caring what his hair looked like as long as he was high.
And afterward, walking home together, neither mentioned how they’d come to be in the same place, at the same time, on the first Sunday of Advent, when they both hated the Christmas season. They really didn’t say much at all.
a mating call…”
Sherlock was in a funk and John tried to cheer him up by leaning over his curled-up form on the sofa to kiss his forehead and gaily exclaim, “Cheer up, Sherlock! It’s almost Christmas!”
"You may be his brother but you don’t know anything about him."
"He wanted to ensure we didn’t have contact until all dangers were eliminated."
I looked at the young novice. "I can imagine your reaction didn’t necessarily please the gentlemen ..."
Lost in thought, I wandered along the cloister looking at the mosaic pattern of the floor slabs, the columns and arches of sandstone, and the garden behind with its colorful flowers which slowly and surely had to give way to autumn. At the other end of this idyllic spot I saw the beehives under the apple trees and I thought again of the time when I had tended these fascinating beings with Sherlock - brother William, I scolded myself again and again. It was only two days ago, but this episode seemed like a dream or the echo of another life.
“Watson, you simply must try these most excellent chocolate biscuits Mrs. Hudson brought up while you were out.” Holmes held out the plate of sphere-shaped sweets toward Watson, who eagerly took one.
"His condition is unchanged ... bad. I did not speak to a doctor, but ... the way it seems to be now ... "
- Sherlock made the most delicious sounds, panting and moaning softly, “ah” and “oh” and John’s name.
Father Andrew leaned back and put a finger to his lips thoughtfully.
The nurse gave me a compassionate look and finally I understood.
The unknown brother dragged me into the room and to the farthest corner, where usually only a few chairs were arranged around a glass table - now the glass plate of the table was broken and in the midst of the bloody shards lay Brother Francis - he did not move, while Father Andrew and two other brothers tried to free him without causing further injury. I made my way through the surrounding monks, helped the novice to straighten up first and then, as carefully as possible, free him from the layers of his habit and scanned his skin for splinters of glass. The black cloth showed some damp spots - but the undergarment was soaked to the waist with blood.
Each time Sherlock’s phone gave a soft
Making a fist, John growled, “I swear to god, Sherlock, I am going to throttle that brother of yours. First he didn’t tell me that you were alive. Now he knew something about Mary. And didn’t tell me.” He banged his fit on the table. “He uses me like a goddamn puppet!”
“I know. Don’t get used to it.”
“I like to hear you. I’m sure that we can manage the expense if we split it.”
I looked around, in search of the British Government, aka Mycroft Holmes, whom I discovered in conversation with the Prior. I glanced questioningly at Sherlock and Jonah.
“What about the one upstairs?”
Helpless, I shrugged and looked at Prior Lambert.
Mycroft gave them a pained smile. “You’re actually going to go through with this?”
“That’s a month away. I can’t eat tinsel for a month!”
I uttered the words without thinking that I could get Brother William into trouble. On the other hand, he could hardly have any more troubles than the ones he was currently in.
Straightening in his chair and unfolding his legs, Sherlock regarded his partner cooley. “People seek out Sherlock Holmes for my
"Are you going to visit Sherlock again today?"
He leaned back and crossed his legs while I leaned forward a bit, touching his knee by accident. I jerked back as if I had burned myself.
"No, John."
A little sound escaped John’s throat, startling him in the silent house. Sherlock had written this just two weeks ago. To him. Thinking he was sitting in his chair at Baker Street, praying for his lover’s safe return.
"John, you know that Brother William is not participating in the common meals?"
I unfolded the note, which by now had already yellowed slightly, and read the tiny, yet legible, handwritten words. According to his information, Francis had been mistreated as a child by his parents and housed by the youth welfare office in a children's home in Tralee. He had quickly adopted the prevailing Catholic moral teachings and had acted out - sometimes by force - against anyone who did not meet these values. He was a good student who passed his exams with top marks but he clearly lacked empathy. Nothing was known about the time between graduation and entry into the convent - he obviously had not said anything on his own and nobody had asked him either. Sherlock had speculated that he had to be in contact with one of the drug dealers during this time. He occasionally received mail from his old home, allegedly from his parents, to which, however, according to Sherlock's investigations, he had had no contact since early childhood. Shortly after Francis received the last letter, Jonah had sent the orange pips. A word on the note had been smeared to the edge and circled, making it difficult to decipher it.
"Where else would you have made the acquaintance of my brother when he has been hiding behind monastery walls for almost a year?"
John spoke his vows first in a voice that was strong and clear. And when Sherlock spoke his, to John’s amazement, his voice shook and eyes misted. John clasped Sherlock’s hands and squeezed and Sherlock calmed down enough to get through the brief sentences.
"Helps what?"
The scruff brings out a different side of Sherlock, which brings out a different side of John. Sex with his scruffy lover is darker, almost violent. Instead of their normal give and take, it’s take and take and take some more, both of them wringing pleasure from the other until they’re utterly spent.
I nodded approvingly, but deep inside I felt an unspeakable sadness that I would never be allowed to hear the voice of this remarkable man.
Starting at Sherlock’s waist, John ran his hands slowly up Sherlock’s sides as they kissed. He broke the kiss when he encountered a ropy scar on Sherlock’s right side, between his lowest and next higher ribs. Thumbing the scar lightly, John asked, “What’s this?”
"Oh yes?"
"And now you believe I would allow you to do this to other parts of my body?"
“Yes, ______, there is a Santa Claus.
“I don’t want to end it, Sherlock.”
Now it was time for a confession.
Following an inspiration, I glanced under the bed but found only an almost empty pack of nicotine patches in exactly the same spot where there was a box of adult magazines in my London apartment. With a slight smile, I shook my head. Every human being had some kind of vice, including the man who had always seemed to me as perfectly supernatural. I put the package back to where I found it and continued my search.
Before that, however, there was something I had to clarify urgently, so I directed my steps towards the library. And there he sat, hidden in an alcove at the far end of the room, frantically digging in a pile of closely-written papers, running his fingers along the lines, taking notes, picking up a book from the pile to his left, leafing through it, picking up another book, and writing something again. Apparently he had not heard me come, for he shrank violently when I spoke to him.
The front page, near the bottom, held a small picture. It had been taken with a cell phone and Greg wondered if he really recognised the back of the convention hall or if all large buildings tended to look the same. Either way the photo was compelling. As was the headline.
"Give me a case!" the man growled. "It's been a week since the Peter's murder and I'm bored out of my bloody skull!"
Sherlock shook his head.
"As much as you," Sherlock shot back with a small smile.
"You're...mad," Jane echoed, lost in Sherlock's eyes.
After a week of not being able to get his fix, and running low on fantasy wank material, he decided to search for gifs. Yes, they'd disabled the videos he wanted, but surely, a gif of some bloke fucking his fist would suffice in those difficult times. He'd found a trove of gifs along with links to short stories, fics, that played out exactly how he wished. Well, almost exactly.
. Sherlock looked down, and then back up to where John was still smiling softly. He cleared his throat and tried to think of what to say.
Much better to keep the man at arm's length.
He took another drag and reached over to his pile of records, pulling out the new Gloria Dee and slipping it from its sleeve. It was still a perfect, glossy black, only played once, and he moved it carefully to the player. The soft snick of the needle being placed was followed by static and then, finally, music.
John huffed and found himself up against the wall. He had never had to lay his feelings out so plainly before. He wasn't one for saying how he felt. That had to change, though, because he couldn't bugger this up. "I-I only want to be with you."
"Ignore her, John," Sherlock said, eyes rolling. "Special consultants don't have any legal standing."
It could have been a blow off. It could be that she was writing back to tell him that she never wanted to talk to him, that they'd had no chemistry. The second he got the envelope in his hands, though, he knew it wasn't true. It was thick, obviously filled with more that one piece of paper.
The flat was very, very nearly burned down, firefighters bursting through the door and everything, the third week of waiting for the response from John, and Sherlock had to pay out of pocket for the house to be cleaned of the smell of smoke, on top of putting Mrs Hudson up in a hotel for three days while it was being done. She was, as always, frighteningly forgiving. Sarah, much less so.
John rubbed his thumb in slow circles on Sherlock's neck and took another step closer, now having to look up to stare into Sherlock's eyes. "So warm."
Sherlock was dumbstruck, and barely put up a fight when the nurse told him only family was allowed at that time.
"Sherlock, can you hear me?" John asked again.
He felt...fond. Yes, that was right. He felt a fondness towards Sherlock and he'd spent so long not feeling anything but anger that the prospect of becoming more fond while still not being anything more than a ghost, a bit of smoke and dreadful magic, as it seemed, was horrifying.
Sherlock crossed his arms and closed his eyes, fingers twitching anxiously. He didn't notice when the dentist walked up and took his seat across from him.
"This is nice," he said, feeling strange about saying so.
And, not sure how to say this, I think you saved my life on my last mission in —redacted—. Just suppose I wanted to thank you, and possibly see if you live in London and wanted to get a pint. If you think this is you, or someone you know, please get back to me.
"I should paddle you two for worrying me so much!" she harped, not truly as angry as her words said. She had to admit secretly that she liked the quickly budding friendship between the two men. They both had trouble with self loathing and she knew they could use some kindness.
"Just had breakfast," Sherlock said, still watching John carefully.
"Who did you live with before me?" Sherlock asked, cocking his head like an owl and narrowing his eyes.
He ran up the stairs and stripped off his clothes, making a mental note to get his coat dry cleaned, and started up the shower. When it was near scalding he hopped in and scrubbed himself clean of the smell of the city. He had enough grime on his clothes to have soaked through to his skin, the rain not helping, and he was more fastidious than most thought when they spied him going through bins for clues.
He was soon joined by Sherlock, the man a bit curled in on himself and looking down at the floor.

"I could go for a cigarette," Sherlock said, sitting with a grunt.
"Sorry, what?" she asked, a bit out of breath.
"No use, gov," Greg said, taking the last drink from the bottle and setting it next to the other empty on the table, "we both know how this goes."
"Sorry, just thought-" he tried, weakly.
"Sure," Greg said, sighing and wondering why he'd got into the bloody sedan.
The case turned out to be such a disappointment that Sherlock had actually forgot about the text by the time he was home. He stomped up the stairs and pulled off his greatcoat, beads of water dripping onto the floor where he left it to hang. The fact that he'd been out in the rain for nothing enraged him.
Sorry this took so long to write. Life has been busy and I've had my mind somewhere else.
"That can't possibly be right," Sherlock complained. "They haven't used that medication to treat infections that bad in a decade. Don't the idiots that write this droll know how to make a simple Google-"
'I want to kiss those lips,' Sherlock thought. But, no, no matter how entrancing this woman was, that just wasn't going to happen. Sentiment, affection, all of it was too dangerous. Just look what happened to Mrs H.
Sherlock nodded and pressed his face back into John's neck, breathing roughly there instead of kissing.
"Sherlock Holmes," John started. "I won't wait outside a hospital room ever again." He held out a small box and opened it to reveal a simple gold band. "If you say yes."
And, oh, that did something to Sherlock. His mind went fuzzy and he felt out of breath, and for a second, just a second, mind you, he reckoned he might pass out. It was the closest to delirious he'd ever felt without chemical enhancement. Strange, how different John's hand felt from his own.
Two hours later, and with the rain at full force, Sherlock finally decided it was time to take his leave.
“The Peking duck is superb,” Sherlock said, sitting back in the booth and not bothering with a menu.
She shook her head fondly at him and gestured to the table. "I dried and folded the clothes in the washer, and made your favorite sticky buns. Tell your man he's welcome to milk if he needs it for his tea."
"God, you don't miss a thing, do you?" John asked, a bit of melancholy bleeding into his words.
John paused and looked up at him. The look was suspicious and his lips were now drawn into a tight line. "You don't have to say-"
"Do we get to leave now?" Sherlock asked, crossing his arms.
The screen came to life and Sherlock blinked at it. The clues were all there, the answer obvious, but how could...how could it be?
"Sherlock? Um, are you alright?" John asked from the other side, the soft sound of his hand on the wood pulling at something in Sherlock's chest.
"You really think reporting in London could be as exciting as Afghanistan?" she asked, watching as Sherlock scratched absently at her hand.
Sherlock allowed John to pull his coat closed and wrap his scarf around his neck. He hadn't even realised they'd gone outside, hadn't felt the cold. He looked behind them to try to find the building, and it was so far back they must have walked for several minutes.
Mycroft took a deep breath and Greg kissed his neck roughly.
"Balloons," Sherlock whimpered.
"You'll live through it," Mycroft said flatly.
As Greg spoke he kissed Mycroft neck and unbuttoned his shirt, tongue soothing where his teeth were too eager. Mycroft gripped Greg's waist and tried to remember to breathe, his first instinct to stay completely still so he could remember every touch.
The dental hygienist bent over and whispered to the receptionist. Dr Watson didn't usually do X-Rays himself. Doctor Watson only did X-Rays when he wanted to sleep with the patient. They agreed that this appointment would be an interesting one to watch.
There was his family outside his grandparents home, sun high in the sky and his hair wild. There was his first true experiment, a concoction of milk and other kitchen staples that was meant to yield rubber. There was his cousin's tenth birthday party, girls in brightly coloured outfits drinking tea in the yard behind their house. There was Mycroft, the day he left for Uni, ill-fitting suit and brand new luggage. And now, after reaching to the floor and picking them back up, there was John. John smiling at him. John impressed. John happy becuase of him, for all of time to see.
Three dots appeared, noting that John was writing back, and Sherlock held his breath.
"Not at all," John shot back. "Which is exactly why I believe we should continue this conversation in private."
"Look," the man sputtered. "I don't know what you think-"
“Quite a mouth on this one,” he shouted over his shoulder to his boss.
"It wasn't as if your password was difficult. You really should update that," Sherlock said, curling in on himself again.
It only took a few more thrusts into his hand, his ears not catching the way it made his bed whine beneath him, before he was quite literally choking and coming on his own chest.
John felt as though he was insulting the man's taste in art then, and wasn't that peculiar? He couldn't bring himself to glance over, so he kept his eyes on the wall, forcing them to stay between the frames.
They were both relieved when they pulled up to a small café. Sherlock hopped out and John sighed and paid the driver. He guessed he shouldn't have been annoyed, he had nothing to save up for, after all.
John shifted where he stood, unraveled by the softness in Sherlock's voice. "Yes?"
John turned to see Sherlock leaning out the back window and staring at where the shovel hovered in the air. Said shovel dropped to the ground with a thump and John swallowed and watched as Sherlock ducked out of the window.
Sherlock perked up at that. "Good, good. But I will sit there. I have questions."
"Please, God," he'd muttered, the pain feeling like fire, "let me live."
"Estranged," Mycroft explained flatly.
"I don't know," John answered, truthfully. "I suppose you just looked happy. I don't think I've ever seen you happy. It was...nice."
'So did I,' John signed. 'Before today I always ended up back on the property when I tried to step off the kerb.'
"And tell me, gorgeous, do you think she'll be able to smell it? How needy you are for me?"
Sherlock let his eyes open and John smiled softly to show him it was true. Sherlock took in a weak breath and nodded.
_____
"Well, I won't make you eat it, then," John said.
"How long has," Sherlock started. "-Oh, you hadn't realised."
"Well, I'll have to see if I can turn that one around," John said.
John swallowed and nodded. "Good, that's...that's good, then. Do we get to call the police now?"
"Alright, then," she said to herself as she walked down the stairs and out into the cold autumn air.
Thinking out of doors at that hour would have ended uncomfortably, the frost coming in without care for the time of year and nipping relentlessly at his nose, easy target that it was. He figured it wouldn't be too bad an idea to head to the pub to have a pint. Then he would feel less likely to bolt again.
And with that John sat on the toilet lid and kept himself from glancing up at Sherlock's naked form.
John hummed and smiled at him, raising his eyebrows sympathetically. "Good day sitting around doing nothing?"
"You don't have any idea where we're going, do you?" Greg asked, sitting back and running a hand through his hair.
"He broke your heart," Sherlock said, eyes sad.
Greg stared at him, hoping to catch a lie, because this was all honestly too damn much for him to process in the middle of the night. "But it wasn't about sex?"
"John," Sherlock said, obviously just as surprised.
CAN'T LEAVE.
"Tonight," John said, halfway between a question and a statement.
"Toxoplasmosis," William said, pulling John from his hateful thoughts and pointing to the small stream a few yards away. "Ever seen a case of it?"
Sherlock chuckled and remembered how mouthy they'd both been even at six. "By all means, lead the way."
Mycroft was overwhelmed with emotion, remembering so many years where he didn't believe that himself. "Thank you, daddy," he said, embarrassed by slipping into a childish manner of speaking.
"You aren't getting back in?" Greg asked.
"No," Mycroft lied resolutely.
"Go to A&E," John said, sighing.
John laughed brashly and fell back in his seat. Christ, he'd been wrong. Predictable might have been what he'd always gone after, and maybe a trick cyclist would have a few words on that, but he'd never been happy. Not like this, anyhow. This unapologetically bizarre woman, with all her rough edges and quirks, had him swooning.
"I've been set up on seventeen dates in the last year alone. Each one of them had promise. Each person said they would give me what I wanted. I suppose, I was just looking for someone with enough gall to ASK for what THEY wanted," John explained.
John stopped in his tracks and grinned. "You were keen on meeting me."
When no reply came, either in temperature change or written form, Sherlock cleared his throat and went on. "If I was stuck here all the time, I'd start digging holes too."
None was there.
Sherlock followed her, trailing behind even as she left the bedroom and started up the steps to her flat. Jane stopped her in the doorway.
My therapist suggested a write a blog. Up until this point I didn't see why I should, or even what I should write if I were to start it. That is, until today. Something has happened in the last two days that I feel like getting off my chest. Here goes.
"And," Mycroft went on, clearing his throat, "will you move in with me?"
His brother's voice chimed in to remind him how ridiculous that thought was, both that he had missed something and that reading this story would help in any way, but he pushed it away.
Real life, though, contained none of the romance. John was still unconscious when Sherlock walked into the room.
Sherlock grunted and stuffed the dossier into the front of his trousers, spinning to avoid the quick hands of Mycroft’s current assistant, Toby. The man almost nearly always gave Sherlock a run for his money, and this time was no different.
Sherlock blushed and looked down to the floor, his whole body feeling tingly.
"I know," Sherlock accepted another bite, and pointed at the screen. Peep was eating a worm out of an apple for breakfast. "Choc'ate be'dder," he said, cereal bites raining out of his mouth. "Oo'bs."
"Ah, no. I think I'll be holding on to this."
"I know, monkey. Once you have dinner, you can have some more medicine."
"Oh c'mon, Myc...you're not 'not-the-fun-one'. They both love you loads."
Sherlock dropped his cup and tried to reach down to cover his bottom, but the sides of his booster seat were in the way. "No," he pouted at Mycroft, his eyes turning glassy.
"Sherlock's going home," Greg replied as Sherlock walked right past him, one bottle of medication already opened and rattling pills out into his hand. "Don't take those dry."
Another full cup of tea and twenty minutes later, Mycroft was looking through his phone when he heard the tell-tale creak of footsteps in the hallway. “You," he said, "are supposed to be in bed, little boy.”
"Jawn, wait-!" Mycroft quickly took the fork and shoved the dripping bite of cake in his mouth before he could add black currant to the list of stains and smells on his bespoke suit.
"I'm sorry, I did not know you would react like that ... You don’t have to worry about me. Leave me alone if you want to, I'm used to it. "
She scratched the palm of her right hand and hissed, looking down to find a rash there. She did have sensitive skin, though, so it didn't raise any immediate red flags. The red flags that were raised had been raised the second she met Jane. She knew something about the woman was important, but she couldn't put her finger on it.
Sherlock was so focused on John that it was his turn to speak before he realised it. He cleared his throat several times and then blurted out 'trust' before quickly going silent again. Sally said 'comfort' in that sickly convincing tone she'd taken on, and the circle went on.
Mycroft nodded and dropped the facade. "I'm confused, Sherlock."
"I take it you saw something you liked?" John asked smoothly, though he did seem to be a bit out of breath.
Sherlock blushed and shrugged. "I don't know. What did you have in mind?"
The letter went on to tell her that she had inherited a flat in central London from her aunt, who had passed away that month. A flat. A free flat. The only problem was, she didn't have an aunt.
"Close. Seemed close. Bickering like an old couple and all."
"If you want to look over the case at the vicarage, I'm sure Mrs Hudson will make us tea," John added.
John could just see him pushing onto a crime scene. "And that doesn't pay the bills?"
John held in the smile pulling at his lips. "Man of action?"
"You look as though you're going to be sick," John said, somehow done with cooking and appraising Sherlock from the opposite side of the room.
"Vicar Watson," James said, removing his gardening gloves and going to open the gate surrounding his small churchyard. "Do come in."
The moment he was back in the cab headed towards Baker Street, the magical feeling had returned. Sherlock had set down his mobile and was speaking rapid-fire about life insurance and possible motives, and John's blood was singing in his ears.
John was there. Right there. A little more than black and white, and whole, and human looking, and HANDSOME.
They were at an impasse: John had no idea what to do next and Sherlock hadn't thought it would go this far.
Leaning against the wall to his left, wholly obscured by shadows, Mycroft held his umbrella and watched him exit and stand on the curb checking his mobile. Mycroft tapped out a message, his phone on silent as always, and sent it.
"Psychic. Obviously," Sherlock replied, watching Jane with a piercing gaze.
The second the door opened, it all went to hell. His only solace was that Doc and this John fellow were both looking away from him.
In what Sherlock felt was several hours, but was closer to twenty-three minutes, he was standing in his pants in his bedroom looking at the wall. In front of him, stuck on with a mismatched grouping of tacks, were ten different coloured strings going all about. He'd bought the string at a children's shop when it was on sale and had used it in enough cases to pay for it twentyfold.
Greg cleaned his hand off on the handkerchief and braced himself as Mycroft held his cock straight up for him. He sank down, fingers digging into the back of the chair, and let a loud moan tumble out.
"Told you so," she murmured, lit end of the cigarette bowing.
A look of surprise! Oh, she hadn't realised that Sherlock would look her up! Perfect, score 1/0. (It had taken less than five minutes to find out everything that her presence couldn't tell Sherlock about Jane, hence her late arrival.)
The second Sherlock had a hand around himself he was coming with a grunt, body pulled tight and back arching off the bed.
"Flowers!" she exclaimed, making John worry for a second that she misunderstood them as being for her. "Sherlock absolutely adores flowers! And look how handsome you are! Oh, I'll die happy now!"
"He needs guidance," John said, taking a long pull of his drink and already wanting another.
John, so filled with affection and fear, for once, didn't end up out of doors. That was the second, he knew, that it would have happened. That intense, warm rush. And yet, he was still there, weighted down by Sherlock's upper body, and apparently running his fingers through his hair. Sherlock had gone silent and was pushing into the caress like a cat.
He hit the delete button and tried again.
"Mycroft said we should get a maid. It occurred to me that we could insist that Mrs Hudson and her sister take the downstairs. The sister lives here in town. I'm sure she could be persuaded," Sherlock said, eyes flitting back and forth on the street.
"Just try it, love," she said.
John kissed his shoulder again. "As long as you'll have me," John answered, and god, it was true.
When it got to Mary, the woman looked right at Sherlock. He diverted his eyes and caught John's reaction just as she spoke.
Mike snorted at the way Sherlock scrunched up his nose. "You want the attic?"
The girls get closer.

He'd hated this process when he'd had to begin it, sure that God had cursed him in particular when he'd turned thirty and found himself getting spots like he never had as a teenager. Now he gave into it freely, letting the water rinse off the soap and drying his face before applying his weekly cleansing mask. He turned his nose up at the menthol scent and rubbed it in circles until it covered the whole of his face, then went to sit in bed.
They sat at the small table, fingers dangerously close together but for the small candle between them, and were asked for their order.

“It’s not a fling, Mary. I didn’t intend it to end this way but let’s try to handle it like adults. I’d like to be friends.” He smiled to disguise the fury still lapping at his jaw, making his teeth clench painfully. He had no desire to be friends - he just wanted to get his things and leave.
I began to ponder; maybe this was not a bad idea at all ... I hardly knew the blond novice, had only been in the kitchen once or twice with him and sat next to him during novice classes, but otherwise I did not know about the man whose room I had secretly searched. Maybe that was my only chance to get any indication that he really was the one behind the cowardly attack on William. The mere fact that, according to his dialect, he came from Northern Ireland, from where, according to William, the drug dealers that he and Jonah had flown was still no proof. Jonah himself sounded as if his roots were in the north of England, yet he had chosen this very place to spend his life - why should not it have been similar for Brother Francis? The fact that he had only entered the monastery after Jonah and William did not confirm the suspicions against him, but might be a mere coincidence. Conclusion: Everything that I knew so far about his possible involvement in these events, I had learned from Jonah and I lacked tangible evidence.
“Are you offering?”
"Why not?"
"Right, I have no idea what is upsetting you but I know where this binge can lead. One damages oneself to an extent which one can not estimate at all. And in the worst case, you harm others. "
The young man breathed deeply and straightened his shoulders. I often did this gesture myself and knew only too well what it meant. He wrestled with himself, fought an inner struggle, which he was afraid to lose. Now it was necessary to maintain as much attitude as possible.
"Sex was never important to him," he whispered.
By the way he nodded in silence, I realized - alas, way too late - that his enthusiasm was apparently due to the fact that he still worried about his friend. His visions of Sherlocks and my future helped him rid his thoughts of those worries. Unfortunately I knew all too well that nothing was easy.
John shook his head. “Not yet. I’ll finish my first note tomorrow. You can read it then.” He stretched his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and drew him close, savoring the warmth and vitality of Sherlock’s wiry body. “I can think of better things we can do tonight.”
When the laptop finished booting up, he double clicked the audio file and closed his eyes. Sherlock’s voice, strained and wavery, filled the room, followed by his own voice that sounded strangely flat to his ears. He held his breath while he listened to the conversation the first time through, not realizing he was doing so. Afterward he let it out in a loud gust, feeling like he’d been punched in the gut.
John felt a tinge of alarm in his chest. Something was definitely off about Mary.
from Frank Hudson!” Her hands fluttered outward in a helpless gesture. “Get those off. Right now! Hurry, Frank might come home.” She sprang to her feet and pulled at Sherlock’s shoulder. “Come on, there’s clothes upstairs. You can change.” Without waiting for a reply, Mrs. Hudson hurried out of the room and toward the foyer.
He shrugged. "It helps me."
"Now, please don’t say that you are keeping the prayer times despite your concussion."
"Not at all. Sometimes it happens that a patient survives, although all of us have given up hope. And this is a miracle for me every time. "
"See you again in two weeks - and besides," Jonah tried to cheer me up and smiled conspiratorially, "you have Sherlock now."
A unanimously murmured 'Amen' rang out from the ranks before the Prior continued.
while John ate in silence, face stony.
"Well, as calm as one can be in his presence..." I muttered, hoping at the same moment that he had not heard me.
But later, in John’s bed, they did finally acknowledge the painful past. And the comfort they shared went a long way toward healing it and restoring Christmas cheer.
The next morning after breakfast had finished, Prior Lambert rose from his seat and addressed the assembled brothers.
I sniffed softly, but then I finally managed to look at him.
"Don’t you think that would be unfair to the other brothers? Brother Jonah is not the only one here who likes Brother William and may wish to bid him farewell - even though, of course, we all hope and pray that the Lord will not call him just yet. Doctor, what’s wrong with you ...? "
"That's the title of the song. A voi che amate amare. A voi que siete amore. "
“Put it back up! Wait, problems? Like what?”
The morning I watched his neighbor bang on their door, I had been impersonating a runner in loose track pants, layered loose sweatshirts and trainers, earbuds seated in my ears but no actual music playing on my phone, jogging slowly down their street, up their alley, then a few block in either direction and back again.
Eventually he’d forgiven me. Of course he did, I was like a drug to him - he said so on his blog.
I looked questioningly at the blond, who now allowed himself a small smile, which did not seem exactly happy.
Jonah's voice brought me back to the present and made me turn towards him.
Not today. He’d think about that some other time.
- to each other.
"And what do you want to do now?" I asked cautiously.
It was mid morning - the neighbors on either side, and even on the storey above their flat, would all be at at work. Even if someone was at home they’d be unlikely hear the faint
"My novitiate ends next week and I want to continue in the Order. However, the other brothers and the Prior have to give their approval. The vote should have taken place long ago but all the chaos in recent weeks, everything was delayed, so they meet this afternoon and make their decision. If all goes well, they will tell me tonight. "
“How long …”
After a while, John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “I suppose we should get cleaned up.”
"Sorry," I muttered, but he waved my apologies aside.
He knew he couldn’t stay mad at Sherlock forever. He’d missed Sherlock so desperately, ached for him so badly, mourned him through countless sleepless nights and meaningless days. And, god help him, he knew that Mary could never fill the Sherlock-shaped hole in his heart. He’d known it when he fell into the easy relationship with Mary; he knew it even more now that Sherlock was back.
Brother Jonah took me to the part of the monastery church reserved for guests and then bid me farewell to go and sit with his brothers in the choir, which was separated from the public part of the church by an ornately carved wooden lattice. Fascinated, I gazed over the crowd of friars all dressed in black who were sitting in file as we sang the opening song. It somehow reminded me of my military training - everyone knew his place and did his duty for the community; like some kind of confraternity that seemed impressive and admirably to outsiders, although they didn’t know anything about this exclusive little club. Well, at least that was the impression I got, when I looked at the monks singing in unison.
The comfort of home
Hesitantly, he rose and helped me up, then bent down, picked up the candle and held it between us, looking deeply into my eyes. This time I held his gaze consciously. His lip twitched as if he wanted to say something but instead he sighed softly, shaking his head gently.
"I hope I didn’t scare you that much?" He asked and patted me on the shoulder, smiling. This man had an incredibly sympathetic way and even if I had imagined that my break from work would be a little more relaxed, I was still firmly convinced that I’d be able to gain valuable experience here.
One plate after another found its way into the holder, so that I hardly kept up with the drying. I tried to keep up with his pace, but the more I strained myself, the more erratically I grabbed the plates, without looking at all - and suddenly I no longer felt the wet porcelain under my fingers, but warm skin slightly softened by water and detergent. Startled, I jerked back and knocked the plate I’d been reaching for to the floor. It burst into two halves, a clean break directly through the center and with no chips.
“I just want what’s best for you. For us,” John murmured as he brushed his hands up and down Sherlock’s back. “You know I think you're brilliant. I just want everyone to have the chance to see it, too. So people need to recognize you when you go out.”
John’s never felt anything like it in his life. He’s wanted before, he’s lusted, he’s walked so close to the edge he thought he’d combust. But those times were all with soft, yielding, plump-in-all-the-right-places women. All of them.
"Can you imagine a reason why you feel that way?"
"You must be Dr. Watson." He greeted me with a friendly smile and held out his hand, "Father Lambert, I’m in charge of this convent."
And the flicker of irritation that flared at the thought of the money he’d spent and the time he’d invested? John tried to stifle that, too.
"Wouldn’t he have been able to accompany you as well then?"
After completing Mass, the brothers left the church as usual. Jonah could barely contain the radiance that graced his face since the Prior's handshake. He was so glad to finally be a Brother. Suddenly, however, he paused for a split second before an expression of incredulous astonishment crept over his face and he nodded, face shining, to someone in the church aisle. Curious, I looked around and saw - Sherlock! In a wheelchair and accompanied by his brother, he had come.
"Jonah, for God's sake, are you alright?"
I needed to look like I’d spent the night in the doss house so I swiped my palms over the dirty floor and scrubbed them over my face and neck, then wrung them together. My hands looked convincingly grimy and since I didn’t have a mirror to check, I’d have to trust that my face did, too. I wiped my hands over the floor again and ran them through my hair, scrubbing roughly to make knots and mat it together. Then I pulled up the hood on my loose sweatshirt and curled up on the disgusting mattress to wait. I bit at my lips and scrubbed them with the back of my hand to chap the thin skin. I also pinched the skin on my inner arms -
"There you are", he greeted me and held out his hand, "I was worried because ..."
I did not want the kiss to ever end, but eventually it did and I felt cold and empty all of a sudden. I did not even dare to look at him, fearing that all this would have been just a dream, triggered by the deep desire within me that this amazing man may return my feelings. Fearfully, I raised my eyes to Sherlock's, which shimmered as brightly as an opal in the mild afternoon sun. His gaze was so clear and hopeful that I could barely endure it. A single tear formed in the corner of my eye and fell into the cotton fabric of his blanket.
Our eyes met, but I could not read what he was thinking in his blue-gray eyes, as I usually did with my patients. Fractions of a second later, he took up his work again and dropped the plate he had just washed off with an obviously intentionally loud clatter in the dish drainer. Jonah, who had watched the whole thing, just shook his head and left the room to wipe the tables. Now I was alone with him.
Even before I could think about it, Jonah surprisingly signed with his hands and  formed silent words with his lips, changing his expression from time to time, never taking his eyes off Sherlock. Fascinated, I looked first to him and then to his dark-haired interlocutor, who then broke out into a strange-sounding, raucous laugh and then answered the same way.
"All right."
Sherlock was tired - the strain of acting as if he were okay, of restraining himself from throwing his arms around John and weeping, of trying to pretend that he wasn’t falling apart bit by bit wore on him. He’d slept more since John came home from hospital than he had in all the months combined of John’s second tour in Afghanistan. Sherlock rubbed his brow and waited for the click of the upstairs bedroom door - John’s door once again - to signal that John was turned in for the night.
"Why him? I mean ... with his vow of silence, that's ... I don’t know, but I imagine it to be quite difficult. "
He said nothing else, giving me time to clear my mind about his unusual emphasis on the word 'accident'. Then he looked me straight in the eye.
I snorted, a little sympathetic, but did not reply. I wanted him to be the one to make the first step and talk to me about the things that mattered - but it seemed he wasn’t willing or even able to do so. Now, however, he looked at me in the warm light of the candle, tilted his head slightly, and studied my expression as if he were dissecting a frog - but fortunately he did not use a scalpel in my case.
Sherlock was surprised by the man’s British accent. It didn’t fit with his looks - he looked more like a Mobster than an Englishman.
"I just wanted to help! If Brother Jonah is really threatened, then ... "
With the silence within the church, the fatigue returned. Again and again I began to yawn, but I tried as best as I could to hide it under the guise of singing. However, I noticed that it certainly was not just me, but also some of the friars. While I let my gaze wander over the assembled choir of men, it struck me for the first time that many of them seemed to be still quite young, maybe my age, but some also significantly younger. This fact surprised me; it wasn’t common these days to pursue a career as a clergyman, especially as a monk. I decided to spend the day trying to pick up on what might have possibly led them to this decision. On closer inspection, however, I had to put up with such a question, too - I had completed my medical studies as one of the best in my class, but instead of accepting a job at a posh private clinic and leading a largely carefree life I had decided to go to Afghanistan, knowing full well that I might not be able to return.
I focused on the prayers of the Book of Hours and did my best to join in the right places; yet I could do nothing to keep my eyes from constantly wandering, looking for a face that seemed so familiar already, as if it was an old friend's face. I thought I found the dark curly head in one of the back rows, but I could not say with certainty whether they were the curls I searched for due to the dim light.
Brother Elijah promptly informed the Prior of the latest news, who announced the good news during the Vigil, with a request to continue praying for Brother William’s quick recovery from his injuries and recover fully. On the other hand, he never mentioned Brother Francis. Had he got word that Brother Francis had attempted to murder his brother and probably was behind the poisoned chocolates? Unobtrusively, I glanced around and spotted Jonah in one of the back rows of the choir stalls. Sitting back in his original place could only mean that suspicions had been dropped against him. Relieved, I breathed out. In the few hours of my absence a lot seemed to have happened. Briefly, I thought about speaking to Jonah at the end of the nightly prayer, but he seemed to have already guessed my thoughts and whispered to me as he passed, a quiet "morning" accompanied by a smile. I went back to my room, firmly convinced that after the events of the day I would not sleep a wink - but as soon as my head touched the pillow, I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
If I told him the truth, I would probably get Sher ...- brother William, I corrected myself hastily in thought - into trouble, so I gave him a simple 'No'.
Curious, I studied him as he tried to make himself comfortable without straining his injured leg, smoothing the fabric of his habit so as not to further enlarge the rip it received when he left the monastery and straightening his glasses. He took a deep breath, then looked me straight in the eye.
John visits Sherlock alone after Sherlock saved him from being burned in the bonfire.
He denied in a weak voice, but I didn’t have to be a trained medical practitioner to realize that he was lying. He coughed and I had trouble understanding him. His breathing was heavy and every word seemed to take an incredible effort, as if with every drop of blood a small piece of his vitality had left his body. What if he died in my arms before the ambulance arrived? I bit my lower lip to suppress my tears and dug my hand even harder into his upper arm.
! He doesn’t love you, not like I do.”
John attributed the slight fever he began to feel just after arriving in Helmand Province to dehydration. He’d been so busy patching up soldiers enough to transfer them to Royal Army hospital back home that he rarely had time to worry about his water intake.
With a swallow, John replied.
"I don’t know ... it's all so blurry, I can’t see clearly..."
, wanting more contact. Again Sherlock took John’s wrist, this time guiding his hand to Sherlock’s arse. Only too happy to oblige, John threaded both hands up the legs of Sherlock’s pants and squeezed handsful of firm flesh. Sherlock groaned and ground against John, hips dipping to press in all the right places, his eyes locked on John’s.
you bang the headboard into the wall when you’re…”
"In the coming weeks, you’ll live as our religious brothers live. This means that you’ll participate in the religious life here, celebrate mass with us and attend the Liturgy of the Hours. We want to be clear that this will be a big change for you, especially when it comes to prayer times, so you are exempted from participating in the nighttime vigil. Which of course does not mean that we would not be happy if you still participate. "
His strange reaction during our conversation came back to my mind. What could he have seen in me that had caused his suspicions to disappear? Was it ... oh no. I could feel the blush of fire throbbing in my cheeks and then my whole body broke out in sweat. He could not possibly have realized that I.... On the other hand, I had presumably made him think that by speaking of the very intimate moments we had shared.
"Good luck! But you may also give it to me, I’d be pleased to pass it on to Brother William, if he has retired to his cell. You know I can't give you access to that part of the monastery."
The conversation became more and more of a battle between me and the young clergyman, but I was sure that I could emerge victorious.
"No, what's that?"
"The police ... As if they could help me. They haven’t even managed to arrest my mother’s murderer, when there were several witnesses who have the license tag of the perpetrators’ car ... "
"For you who love to love. For you who are love. "
“What about me?” Sherlock’s brows knitted in confusion.”
The ceremony took less than ten minutes. It was a slow day at the registry so there was no delay. The officiant asked if they’d like to add anything to the brief vows. They looked at each other. Sherlock shrugged, his body language telling John the decision was his. John said that the regular vows were good enough for them - the less fuss, the better.
"A hitchhiking monk?"
"Someone who by an unlikely coincidence bears exactly the same name as you. Come on, Doctor, let's go for a little walk. "
"May I take your pulse?"
I glanced at my alarm clock and realized that I had to hurry; I did not want to arrive late for morning praise and thereby draw unwanted attention to myself. Actually, I was coming here to get away from my everyday stress for a while - and now the exact opposite came to pass. I felt completely stressed out, both on a physical, as well as on the spiritual level since my thoughts only seemed to revolve around William. I knew it had to stop right away - but since the nocturnal encounter I was even more confused than ever. How could this go on when we regularly ran into each other during the day? Assuming that he was not avoiding me after I had affronted him in such overbearing manner. Now that I was alone and my mind seemed to function normally again, I was ashamed to the depths of my soul for my foolish infatuation. The fact that I had meant no harm and just wanted to tease him did not make things better. Even as I walked down the hallway to the church, I made a decision: I would apologize to Brother William at the next available opportunity. It was up to him whether he was willing to forgive me or not …
"I do not understand?"
I leaned back to take a closer look, but his hand slid back onto the blanket and lay there as if nothing had happened. I almost feared I had imagined all this, but I knew that wasn’t the case. His hand had been on my head and no one else could have put it there. I held that hand in mine and spoke.
"I need my medication. And to get out of this wet nappy." Sherlock steadfastly avoided looking at Gregs' face as they slowly started out of the kitchen.
Mycroft held the ducks aloft, then cleared his throat loudly until they’d shut their squawking mouths. “Since Jawn was the last one to pop his duck, Sherlock goes next.”
“No more ‘panks. Jus’ co'ders,” Sherlock mumbled into the floor.
Mycroft made a face. "No, thank you."
"G'eg!"
Now that Jawn was out of his sight, Sherlock began to squirm. “Down, down My?” he pleaded, trying to crane his neck to see…he was eager to get there before Jawn usurped every single green crayon in the box. “Down, p’ease?!”
"Yes, Daddy." Sherlock leans up and kisses his cheek, "Love you, Daddy."
There was still no answer. And Jawn was nowhere to be seen.
"Yes, waste; that was far too much color...I hope it doesn't hurt the flower."
"Ca'h we ma'ge some ya'der?" Sherlock asked as he took Greg's hand and began to slide bracelets on his wrist.
"I did come to your birthday, earlier this evening" Mycroft said, steely eyes on Greg.
"Oh, it's not, is it?" Mycroft said, eyeing what was obviously supposed to be the trunk.
“I y’ike games!” Jawn peeped, shoving his green crayon into the pocket of his onesie. “Pit’cher is done, now fw’idge!!!” He bounded to his feet and skittered out of the sitting room, picture in hand.
"So'gs?"
Sherlock chewed the stick of his ice lolly as he thought; "Fi'be. This one maked six," he said with a cheeky grin.
"My'cobb try a' tri'g me." Sherlock pulled his hand out of Mycroft's and took hold of the railing. "I'm no'd stoo'bid."
"I know that, but getting there is the good bit," Greg shuffled his feet and looked bashful.
When they reached the front stoop, Mycroft put a hand on Sherlock’s chest to stop him and told Jawn to wait at the top of the steps. “When we get inside, Sherlock is going to go to his room and wait, and Jawn is going to sit at the table and eat until we join him…does everyone understand?”
"Whoops, sorry..." Sherlock's apology was cut off by John's deep chested laughter. John kissed his cheek, avoiding the patch of glue.
Sherlock gave him a wobbly smile.
"You can't come along because they only allow blood relatives."
"Dir'd?"
"So'gs now," Sherlock said, plopping his bum down on the last step and unrolling his pair of socks.
“I don’t need to watch a pirate film, cause Ima real pirate.”
"N'nnnnn."
Sherlock's mouth falls open, each thrust forcing the air out of his lungs as his head lulls back in pleasure.
Sherlock nodded, plopping his bum on the bench. "F'yowers."
"Sherlock, it's me, John! I'm with you. Come back, I'll keep you safe. Nobody can hurt you now. Come on, wake up! "
“It’s either this, or invite her to your folks’ house for Christmas.” John’s tone was no more merry than Sherlock’s.
I looked at him and realized that it was far from over.
Alarmed, I reached for his arm, pushed the sleeve of his robe up and took his pulse while I put a hand on his forehead. His skin was warm, but not hot, the pulse slightly elevated, and he still held his head.
And that was what I believed. Why should it be impossible that someone just wanted to make Jonah happy on his birthday? Just now, when he was actually injured? It might as well be a gift from one of the other friars that had been deposited on his night stand, so as not to arouse the appearance that the novice was getting favors. Despite the threatening situation, I simply did not want to believe that someone wanted to kill him with poisoned chocolates - that just sounded too much like a bad crime, something that just did not happen in real life. I turned to Brother William for confirmation.
Soldiering through, as he always did, John forced a smile. “I made dinner. I even came up with a new veg slaw.”
The Prior shook his head vigorously.
you? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Sherlock does not need anyone, the only person important to him is himself. "
Brother Jonah?"
"No! He probably has a concussion."
"Three, maybe four hours."
“And he stops under the parasitic plant hung from the foyer light fixture.”
Holmes wrinkled his brow and replied. “Yes, that’s what Mrs. Hudson mentioned. She was chattering on as is her wont, and I, of course, kept my mind occupied on other matters, paying her only peripheral attention, as is my habit. But she most definitely called out the name ‘twiddle diddles’.”
It was later that evening, back at Baker Street, still wearing his best suit from Sherlock’s funeral. He’d lit the fire and spent a long time just standing with his hands on the mantle, looking at the flames and letting tears flow. He’d realized then that what he’d had with Sherlock was more than friendship, more than sex, more than companionship. He’d loved Sherlock, probably from the first chase over the rooftops of London - the evening Sherlock had cured his limp and brought him back to life.
