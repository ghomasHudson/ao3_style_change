Being held like that, without Steve giving any indication that keeping Tony’s 200-and-change pound body suspended in mid-air was even costing him much in the way of effort or energy, was so suddenly and intensely erotic that it hurt, like a charge that shot all the way through every one of his nerve endings. He whined into Steve’s open mouth as he carried Tony down the hall with singular, focused purpose.
came up to the penthouse with something. Bruce brought a box of Hulk-themed bandages, glancing at Tony’s abdomen long long enough to convey a reminder to clean and re-bandage it today as he’d been instructed. But he didn’t bring up the injury in front of any of the others, which was a second gift in its own way.
Now, traditionally this universe has ten cateogrizations:
Other than the actual timeline, perhaps the most significant divergence between this Tony’s life and that of the MCU took place during the so-called Time Heist. Stark and Captain Rogers did end up visiting the 1970s, but they were prevented from leaving immediately due primarily to their utter incompetence as spies. As a result, Stark discovered his father’s use of the time stone. He also spent more a significant amount of time with Steve Rogers, which seemed to all their relationship to recover somewhat from the events of the Civil War.
As to Ms. Potts’ conversation with Stark, I believe I can offer a quick view, yes.
While Tony was still struggling for purchase against the fluffy, encompassing grasp of the couch and yelling complaints at Dummy, Steve hauled him upright and into a seated position, then took a long breath and spoke.
“You—this—I don’t understand you at all! You never do what I think you’re going to! And it makes me fucking crazy Steve, it makes me clumsy and foolish and totally incapable, and I am not any of those things. Stop making me like this you asshole, and go back to being predictable and simple!”
“I…require disciplinary attention, and I had hoped you would be the one to deliver it.”
The orgasm tore through him, powerful and instantaneous, and it didn’t matter that it left Tony absolutely shattered in its wake, not when the rest of the team was already moving to crowd around them, to hold all of those broken pieces and eventually put them back together, stronger than before.
Pepper seemed to recognize the signs just as well as Tony, and made to step in front of him. But Natasha spoke first.
“Did your guys get him? Maximoff?” Tony sighed, running a frustrated hand through his hair and then letting his hand fall, as if out of impulse or habit, to the lock on his collar. Now that Peter was looking at him without the distorting haze of anger, it was impossible to miss how utterly exhausted his mentor appeared. His hair showed all the signs of frequent application of dry shampoo in lieu of actual showers, and Peter would be damn surprised if the man had slept more than a few hours a night since this whole thing with Maximoff had started. (And why did that name sound so familiar, anyway?)
“This isn’t a punishment,” Steve added anyway, just to be safe. “I’m going to warm you up with my hand and then use my belt on your gorgeous ass and thighs, not because you’ve done anything wrong, but because it makes me feel good. It makes me feel so good to see you covered in my marks and desperate to come, Phil.” The submissive wriggled impatiently against the bench, and Steve wasted no time in laying down a heavy smack with his right hand. “You’re going to count for me. You may come in the sleeve any time you’d like. Or, if you’re very good and wait for me, I’ll fuck you nice and hard after and you can come in my hand.”
But this? This was something that he never would have expected. I mean, sure, he’s thought about what it would be like, being with Steve. He’s a handsome guy, okay an insanely hot, sculpted, breathtakingly handsome guy, so you can’t really blame him for thinking about what it would be like having a go at him, sometimes. Okay a lot. But that’s as far as he’s ever gone with entertaining thoughts about Steve. Because, really? Steve liking him as a person and wanting to have a relationship with him?  Yeah, does not compute. Error. Mission abort.
He quickly straddled Steve and spoke, “Fuck Steve, I’m still so fucking pissed at you -” He ground his ass along Steve’s growing bulge, while Steve let out a hiss at the sensation, and continued, “but fuck, if I don’t have you inside me in the next couple minutes -”
But as Tony’s admiration of Captain America grew, so did his curiosity towards the man himself—not just his heroic alter ego. And Tony found that Steve Rogers was every bit as heroic as Captain America. He couldn’t believe all the details the history books left out. Sure, they got the gist of it—a sickly man who wanted to be of service to his country despite all his ailments—but he was so much more than that.
Tony could not believe he was about to do this. He should have put up a better fight when Rhodey was trying to convince him.
He rubbed his cock along the path of Tony’s parted cheeks, his dick catching a few times at the hole, but never quite going in. “Maybe I should rub one off like this, covering your ass in my come until your nice and wet, and then sticking it in you as you get me hard again.”
"Thanos.” Steve corrected. “And yes. An overly simple way of putting it, but essentially yes."
I hope this is what people were looking for in the sequel. I'm think of continuing for a couple more chapters. Here is a sneak peak for Chapter 3. Also I'm open to requests. If anyone wants this fic to include something, mention it in the comments and I might be able to work it in (I'm pretty open to ideas or desires). As my first fic I'm using this whole thing as a learning process and I would love the challenge and engagement of the readers.
It was his fault really, Tony hadn’t been to the room in a long while—what was the point when you had the real thing right in front of you? So, when Tony had brought Steve over to the mansion with the intention of showing him around, the collection had completely slipped his mind.
"-ngers, yeah. Their lead singer Sharon Carter just dropped out. Apparently her and Cap had a huge falling out and she quit the band. Needless to say, they're pretty screwed at the moment. So they're holding auditions for a replacement."
Emboldened, Steve got up from the couch and lifted Tony’s chin so he could look him in the eyes.
“The good Captain is presently on the training grounds with Miss Romanoff and Master Barton.”
The extantant looks from everyone's faces, especially Thor's (the man could rival a golden retriever for god's sake) must have weighed him down, cause after a moment, he too agreed that Future Steve should stay a while. Or at least until they had more of a solid plan figured out.
. . .
Steve had returned all mopey, sad, and pathetic. Tony had been prepared to rip him a new one,  but then he had shown up. In. That. Mother. Fucking. Beard. And Tony had just about lost it.
He hadn’t told anybody about his secret collection; it was embarrassing enough to him how far he took his admiration, he didn’t need others knowing about it too. Especially not after all the times he made fun of Rhodey for his Captain America fanboy tendencies—he’d never live it down if Rhodey found out just how bad Tony himself had it for the Star Spangled Man.
"Wearing this. Wearing only this." Tony had then continued. He wore the confidence of a man used to playing a certain role, but Steve felt he still saw a bit of hesitancy in his dark brown eyes.
“Ah, yeah.”
“Well, because you deserve it.” Tony said. So simply, like it was just a matter of fact that Steve deserved all that Tony had to offer. Like he somehow was worthy of receiving everything that Tony had given him. Like he was worth all that and so much more.
Furry looked taken aback by Steve's comment: his brows raised high and his head tilted back in clear astoundment.
“Surveillance did reveal an unauthorized man in standard SHIELD uniform at the scene.” Natasha confirmed for them.
Half the population.
Things had been going well, as far as his relationship with Steve that is. They’d been dating for three months now and Tony honestly had no idea how Steve still hadn’t dumped his sorry ass. He was still notorious for getting into creative binges, working on a project for days on end. People still could only tolerate him in small doses, but apparently none of that mattered nor applied to Steve.
He had stared dumbfounded at the picture the young man presented: wrapped in a fluffy white bathrobe, Tony had lounged on a black leather sofa, red wine glass in hand, while he twirled a familiar necklace in the other.
So bring it on, I've been bruised
“Ya and the guy also came ready to sing, if you wanted me to get started on that anytime soon, instead of asking pointless questions.” Tony drawled, the epitome of cockiness. That pulled at something in Steve. He was never good at listen to authority himself, but people seldom went up against them; Tony’s attitude was quite intriguing.
Though they got along swimmingly, they didn't have much in common so Steve could find no further excuse as to how he could continue further interaction with Tony.
“Steve, up... fuck, get up here.” He made grabby hands towards Steve, and getting the hint, Steve sat up, kissing him again as they fucked.
They were to be called up one at a time to the centre stage, where they would first introduce themselves and then be asked a couple of questions before they had to sing a song of their choosing. After going over the candidates, Phil would later get in touch with whomever they selected.
He is about to say as much, but then what comes out of his mouth is “yes.” And what? That is not what he wanted to say. At all. Stupid brain. He goes to correct his mistake, but Steve is now picking him up and spinning him around talking about how happy he is, and how it’ll be a date that Tony will never forget. So Tony feels himself cave, and gives a mental shrug thinking ‘Ah what the hell, it’s only one date, he’ll figure out I’m not worth it soon enough’. With that, he gives into his urge, and proceeds to wrap his arms around Steve’s neck, hugging him back.
He had thought that they would have found something at least remotely unique enough to work with, but so far they had practically gone through the entire list of hopeful lead singers and had nothing to show for it.
The dinner is fantastic, and they talk all night until closing about anything and everything. Tony tells him about his latest projects and the specs on them. Steve listens attentively and even gives him some notable suggestions. However, there are times that Tony can tell that whatever he is rambling about is clearly flying over Steve’s head, but in these cases Steve just puts his chin on his hand and smiles, smitten with the way Tony animatedly talks.
In the aftermath of truly deep subspace, Tony’s mind was a remarkable thing. In the slightly-less-than 48 hours since his correction from Bruce he’d vacillated sharply between the sweet and nearly wordless state he’d been in when Steve and the others had first arrived and something far closer to lucidity, often involving  highly technical remarks on everything from potential upgrades to the team’s tech to notes he wanted to give to one of the kids who snuck into the lab to work on their projects.
“Absolutely not. It is ass o’clock in the morning, and for the first time in days I’m not waking up to the eardrum-splitting wale that is the alarm to assemble. Which, by the way, I’ve been meaning to have a word with you about that. Could there not be some kind of dampener based on the threat level? Like, did those creepy mannequin things that group of Dr. Who fans made really require the same volume as that Taskmaster guy? I was having a really good dream that morning.”
“This was only partly a scene, really. There’s still so much of the contract you couldn’t or didn’t want to fill out yet. I nearly cancelled altogether. But I talked to Nat, and she helped me realize I could turn some of the negotiation and conversation into something fun and sexy, that it was possible to do that without manipulating you into thinking there were right and wrong answers. We can also talk later about some options for more 24/7 kinds of things that you and I can experiment with between scenes. More of the kind of daily stuff that you seemed pretty interested in based on your notes from the contract.” This sounded damn intriguing, and Tony had at least eight follow-up questions, but they also didn’t feel particularly urgent when he was still deeply in subspace. Nothing felt urgent, really, nothing but Clint’s hands and his praise and the fact that he was already alluding to wanting to be with Tony like this again.
“It just…none of it makes any
“Because you were already struggling enough to adjust to the idea of him being gone involuntarily, let alone…well, something more complicated. I know you and Tony have had your ups and downs over the years, but I genuinely believe that he was trying to do you a kindness here.”
“I—maybe I wish that too a little bit. Christ knows why, all you'n I have ever done is break each other into pieces. But when everything falls apart there's still some part of me that always looks for you. God I hope I don't remember saying any of this in the morning... g’night, Cap.”
She’d been on the mission last night, he recalled vaguely, though the tension in her frame seemed to speak to something beyond tiredness. As the gathering concluded (one of Steve’s favourite things about the Wakandan army was how little patience they had for bureaucracy for its own sake—they were efficient in the extreme) Steve wound his way through the crowd toward his Agent.
“You still can’t afford me, Director.” Steve held up a garlic fry, thick cut and dripping with mayo and who knew what else in answer. “Alright, I’m listening.”
After that, it started coming back in bursts. Some of it he was positive happened—he definitely sang a song, and yelled at MJ about Tony, and threw up. (That last one he’d known just from the fact that his throat was still raw.) Other bits, like talking to Doctor Banner on the phone, were a little iffy, and could just as easily be some kind of dream sequence generated by his drunk, depressed brain. Some, like having an asthma attack, would have to be outright fictions. Peter hasn’t had an asthma attack in years.
Pepper is forced to play detective at the Tower when an unexpected visitor shows up in her office (and refuses to leave.)
This Stark’s issues with food are certainly a major distinction, as Bruce Banner has alluded to. James Barnes has also noted that the previous version of Stark was more inclined towards anger and an occasionally vicious temper than the one from the so-called MCU.
It was not really a tradition Phil’s proud of. Hell, it wasn't something he intended to become a tradition at all. It started out as just he and Clint poring over the data they’d collected about Tony’s universe one evening. It was shortly after the archer’s first date with Tony, and Clint was still reeling about the news that his counterpart had a wife and kids.
“Captain Rogers.”
Jana Knox, author of
“Well, I’m back.” Everyone in the room laughed, or rather they made that empty, hollow noise that was supposed to be laughter in near unison. (And of course, he was positive none of them even got the reference.)  “I won’t keep everyone for long today. I know it’s been a…trying week. Hell, I’m still remembering which way all the doors in this place open. But I do want to make one thing imminently clear: It’s a rare and odd feeling to bear witness to your own legacy. It’s not an opportunity many people get. And I am nothing but proud and grateful for how well you all have kept Stark Industries running in my absence. You’ve stayed true to our vision and our mission; you’ve continued to prioritize keeping the world clean, safe, and accessible over taking the easier and immediately profitable path. You’ve faced intense pressure, made decisions that must have been agonizing in the moment, and found yourselves more than equal to the challenges in front of you. I know not all of us have seen eye to eye in the past, but I want to truly and genuinely thank you for all that you’ve done over the past couple of years.”
Another author interjection: this one also takes place in the past from where the main story is now, in the few days between Chapters 35 and 36.
First, I must note that if Agent Romanov ever learns I have shared this with others, I will likely go missing under suspicious circumstances. Do not believe any communications which allege to come from myself, no matter how convincing they seem.
(and help you apply for college and give a horrible embarrassing speech at your graduation and)
“I’m afraid so, Mr. Stark. It’s an acronym, one your counterpart coined, even. It stands for Sentient World Observation and Response Department.”
“Uh…I guess I’d rank thudding a little higher than the other options.” (Steve’s mind helpfully supplied several mental images of both his own Tony and the one in front of him sprawled over Steve’s lap taking a paddle. He took another swig of juice, this time right out of the container.)
“You’re allowed to be needy after a scene, Sugar, but I think we need to get some food into you before we consider anything physically active. Lotsa folks got married when Steve and I were young, but I think it’s sort of fallen out of fashion now except with real religious folks. I’d be thrilled to pick out your clothes for tonight, with the caveat that you tell James that you lied to him and accept the inevitable coupla smacks on the ass that’s probably gonna earn you. And yes, to answer your original question, Sam is coming out tonight.”
“This isn’t quite working for you, is it?” Clint’s kiss-swollen lips were tilted up in a slight smile, so at least he didn’t seem to be angered by this astute observation. He actually seemed…almost intrigued? (Tony had to be reading that one wrong.) “Want to go watch a movie or something?”
Now Tony had claimed the couch in Steve’s office as his own, sprawling across it for hours at a time to the point where it had already become common practice for anyone who entered the room to check for his presence before they started talking. (God help him, Steve loved it. He found himself leaving early for work most days just so that he’d get a couple extra hours in with Tony. Even Dr. Domen was onto this scheme of Steve’s, and she had seemed heartily amused by it during their last session despite his insistence that their relationship was solely professional and friendly.)
He’d never much gone in for baths before. And he still could anticipate wishing to be brought down harder and faster on another day, when he wanted something like the surge of excited fear that Clint’s approach had provoked, for instance. This week, though, had felt endlessly taxing, full of press and corporate dramas and so many aspects of life that had become suddenly, traumatically irrelevant in his own universe. He experienced Natasha’s soft cloth and gentle hands methodically scrubbing every inch of his skin with the same relief that he'd felt removing Mark II’s clothes, only
Phil set the stack of paperwork he was filling out onto the couch next to him. Even this simple act was done with the kind of precision and care than most people took with far more delicate procedures. Though its mechanisms were unclear to anyone but Phil himself, there was a definite logic in the order he put each sheet of paper down, patiently and all without a single bend or crease; there were no flags or post-its to serve as visual organizational cues, but Tony doubted the other man needed them. He didn’t even seem to need to look at the pages themselves to confirm their content. The pages themselves were probably for someone else’s benefit, Tony mused, not Coulson’s. When he arrived at the last collection of documents, Coulson kept it in his hand and looked at Tony for the first time.
Like usual, his friend came to, surprisingly alert. He did, however, blink down at Peter several times. (Was it egotistical of Peter to wonder if Ned was checking that Peter was really there?) The Spider-Man suit was sticking out from the inch or so of Peter’s backpack that he hadn’t finished zipping before they’d fallen asleep in the wee hours of the morning. Ned hadn’t dared to touch it then, treating the suit with an exaggerated hero-worship that Peter suspects was masking a more complicated reaction. Even if he hadn’t understood at the time, Ned had seen Peter after some of the worst of his nights as Spider-Man. Undoubtedly he’d been remembering them all, and the more gradual way that there had been almost nothing left of Peter himself in the weeks before Tony had come into his life. Before either of them could change their minds, Peter unzipped his bag, grabbed the suit, and pushed it into Ned’s hands.
“I shall look most forward to it.”
Ah yes. Glad
“I know the perfect spot.”
“I got that postcolonial question right!”
you. There’s a twelve foot high memorial, they tossed around the idea of a national holiday until Rhodey reminded them that you would’ve insisted on some kind of law that everyone observing it get hammered and make insulting phone calls to their elected officials. You cannot just go strolling out the front door of Avengers Tower, not without setting off a chain reaction that could, among other things, cripple SI and ground the Avengers Initiative. Not to mention that from the sounds of it there are some major differences between your world and ours that we need to discuss how to manage.” He’s never been good at apologies, and apparently her Tony never had been either, because Pepper took his silence as precisely that. Her expression softened and she sighed that exasperated ‘Tony’s-giving-me-a-migraine’ sigh that usually ended in him sending someone out to buy her something sparkly. “Come upstairs. The others are just about losing their minds, and we need…we have to talk this out.”
“Noooo Dummy not now, ’s the middle of the night.” A soft, musical laugh informed him that this was decidedly not his bot playing wake-up attendant again. “Pep?” And damn if this wasn’t the most bizarre thing that had happened to him in ages, portal included; when was the last time he’d woken to Pepper Potts in his bed? Before Thanos and the War, definitely; maybe even before Ultron—Pep had been gone a lot back then, even before they’d officially called it quits. Yet here she was, sitting cross-legged on the bed in patched, fraying jeans and a Stark Industries hoodie, her hair tied back in a messy ponytail. For the briefest of moments Tony entertained the notion that this was some kind of misguided ‘thank-god-you’re-sorta-not-dead’ bootycall. (He’d say no, of course, even if the thought of being touched positively by anyone right now felt like a lifeline he was tempted to cling to with everything he had left.)
With one more guilty look around the room, Tony sank down to his knees. His nerves led him to drop a bit too quickly, and he winced as his joints protested vigorously. And even once the pain of that faded, it took some fidgeting and adjusting to make it comfortable; he had to figure out how much space to leave between his knees, and how to distribute his weight, and what to do with his hands. The whole thing was rather more complicated than the rest of the team made it look when they did this. Eventually, though, after some pretty undignified wiggling and grunting and shuffling, he settled into a comfortable position and allowed his eyes to drift shut.
Cooking with Rhodey, it transpired, was not all that different from building with Rhodey. He was laser-focused but calm, meeting Tony’s occasional mistakes and frequent complaints with his usual cocktail of teasing and no-nonsense correction. At Steve’s prompting he started assigning the rest of the team jobs, too, which turned the kitchen into a site of loud, chaotic energy as tools and ingredients moved about the space and recipes, both real and imagined (at least, Tony hoped Clint’s suggestion of a gummy-worm based filling for their burritos was not a serious one), were shared. Caramelizing onions, Tony’s primary job, turned out to be a frustrating exercise in waiting around, though Rhodey also gave him custody of one of the sharper knives and allowed him to cut up bell peppers and tomatoes. Tony was munching on a stolen piece of the former when Bruce made a thoughtful noise.
“I know what you’re doin’, brat,” Bucky told him, though his knowledge of Tony’s entirely unsubtle attempts at edging Bucky somewhere at least Dominant-adjacent did not prevent him from sliding his arms around Tony’s waist. He didn’t seem to run quite as hot as Steve did (probably owing to the bastardized version of the super-soldier serum he’d been given), but it still felt extremely pleasant, and less weird than it should have given their relative lack of interactions like this, to snuggle in against the planes of Bucky’s toned chest.
“After you thought James Barnes had died, both times, how did you cope? What were your responses?” A knot of unease formed in Steve’s belly.
He meant for Tony to fetch a cloth, but Phil should not have been surprised that Tony opted for a different method, nuzzling his way between Phil’s legs and beginning to lick at the slick patches of spend (his own and Clint’s) on his thighs. He spared a lazy thought for whether their sweet, orally-fixated submissive might go in for full-on cock nursing, but if that worked he suspected it would
“I think the context doesn’t fit. You would have asked about the status of a lover before now, would have been concerned about how the little charade we’re going to have to put on would impact him. And I think…even despite whatever your version of the team did, I don’t think you would have let us cling to any hope about a future with you if there wasn’t any. She also told me where you guys had gone when all this happened, and I don’t see any way that what you saw would have triggered that response. We’re talking…we’re talking about someone young, I think. So I started trying to find any references I could to someone under 21 named Peter that you might have had any meaningful contact with. The only lead I could track down was a kid in Queens who may or may not be moonlighting in a pair of what I can only describe as souped-up pyjamas.” What Natasha chose
Talia Avelino was undoubtedly been the most troublesome agent in SHIELD history. She was brilliant, there was no disputing that: off-the-charts IQ, frightening competence with every weapon SHIELD had, and the instincts for deception and manipulation of a young Natasha Romanov. (It was Steve’s sincerest hope that the two of them would never, ever meet.) She was also a category two submissive with a huge chip on her shoulder, and a near-complete disregard for orders, authority, or in today’s case, military property.
Content Notes: First response contains a brief, mild, and 100% unintentional moment of non-consensual Domination of D/s Tony by D/s Steve. (He does not know that Tony is a sub yet, and as such is unaware that exhausted post-battle Tony will feel more compelled to listen to his orders.) If this is a trigger area for you, it's probably worth skipping.
“Hulk want to see Tin Man smash team,” he informed them, then sat down on the floor with a ground-shaking thud.
Thank you so much for your continued kudos and comments on this story. I absolutely love hearing from you, and am eager to find out what you thought of this chapter. Fave moments/lines? Questions? Rants? I love them all!
“Infinity for stop. Yellow for slow down. Green for go.”
“So what do we do?”
like that, he hadn’t come since the milking episode with Bruce (a procedure Bruce had recently begun threatening to repeat if Tony didn’t take matters into his own hands), but right now he also hated it. His dick was throbbing between his legs, and god even the pillow underneath him was starting to seem like a viable option to rut into to get some relief.
“It’s not just…we were in the middle of aftercare, and she just burst in here. I finally had the chance to take Tony through an entire scene from start to finish, without the awful come-down he had with Bruce, and then she just strolls in like she owns the damn place. Having work to focus on is helping him through the worst of the drop, but he’s still showing some minor symptoms, and I can’t, he won’t let me—I fucking
“JARVIS, turn the TV off. Actually, is it possible for you to cut  the wifi and cellular data to the floor entirely, along with any non-essential power outlets? With allowances for any emergent communications?” His first instruction to the team had gone entirely ignored, but the loss of the trash TV they were watching and their suddenly useless phones finally got their attention. Phil looked up, glassy-eyed, from the game he’d been playing on his phone that seemed to involve giving people virtual haircuts.
All other members of the team are switches. Clint Barton, as you know, was classified as a switch at category 6. Natasha Romanov and James Barnes are both officially classified as 5s, though Captain Rogers had voiced a suspicion that his experiences with HYDRA may have forced Barnes down a level. He has never been tested to confirm. Phil Coulson is ranked at a category 4, and was the closest the team had to a submissive after their Stark’s death.
It was Natasha (of course it was) who seemed to realize how quickly things were edging toward too much. She reached for Tony, pressing a kiss to his lips that refused simple categorization. It was soft and reassuring, her mouth open and seeming to yield against his own, but he could feel the subtle ways she directed the entire exchange. Tony didn’t take so much as a breath that he didn’t think she intended, and when they broke apart he let himself stare at her in wonder for just a moment. He’d called another version of her an imposter once, but the more he got to know Natasha, the more he felt like what made her so good at her job was exactly what she’d told him made her a unique Dominant: every version of herself that she presented was always true at some basic, core level. The self she produced in response to the desires of those around her no less honest for the fact that they often involved some kind of manipulation.
It’s almost a relief when Rhodes gets there. At long last, he can turn his attention back to other people’s problems.
Much of the emphasis in public discussion of Tony Stark’s recent press conference has been on his father, Howard Stark. And I’m not arguing that Howard’s actions are excusable, or that we shouldn’t be talking about them! But I’m more interested in using this space to think about his son, and how his actions today as well as over the past few months since his return seem to suggest that Tony Stark is stepping up as a crucial public figure in the fight for more progressive orientational politics.
"Essentially, yes." Steve said. Desperation and contempt fueled his next words. "Look, I was going over the battle and what I could have done differently so that none of this would have happened and -"
"Rhodey, when you say my favourite rock band, you don't mean to say the Ave-"
"Yeah huh." Tony countered.
But, staying a couple more minutes couldn’t hurt. Plus, he needed the rest, and slowly he too found himself drifting off, joining Steve in his quiet slumber.
“Can’t keep me under you forever Rogers, I’m not that easy.” Using the element of surprise, he flipped Steve over, all the while still staying connected.
"I am not going back to take the Aether out of Jane again. Putting it back in was awkward enough."
“I - what? Tony, I don't -” Steve confusedly let out, but the rest was cut off when Tony’s lips met his.
"Welcome back to the land of the living, Stark." Strange offered a hand to help pull him up, and he followed, feeling unsteady once he was on his feet.
That being said, Tony had no clue how to break that all to Steve.
See the thing was, Tony didn’t just admire Captain America, he also admired the man, Steve Rogers as well. Okay, at first, he had, of course, been drawn in by the notion of an awe inspiring hero, but who hadn’t? It was pretty much guaranteed if you were an American that Captain america was your favourite hero. Heck, even if you weren’t, everyone loved him, even villains!
"Steve, I.. thank you." Nat whispered into his neck. Steve's arms tightened, before clasping her shoulders and bringing her back up, so he could wipe the tears from her eyes.
A little less disoriented Tony then took a look around him, taking note of the scene.
"Not exactly. What I'm suggesting isn't to change our future but our present." Bruce scratched at the stubble on his cheek, he  appeared not to understand what Steve was saying.
"Yes, well, I believe it’s worth a shot.” Steve stated. But then he looked at the flicker of doubt that had come across Bruce’s face, Steve leaned over the table and placed a hand on Bruce’s arm. “We owe it to them to try, Bruce."
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
ugh I really hate how I ended the chapter and I wanted it to be longer, but It was driving me crazy so I just had to post it. Sorry. Hopefully it's ok enough. I'll definitely come back and fix some stuff up at some point.
“Fuck, Steve, just fuck me already, I’m ready.” Tony finally said, having reached his limit ages ago. He needed to be fucked by this man already.
“I’m also hoping that you’ll also do me the honour of continuing to see you.” Steve ducks his head with the sames sheepish look that he had when he first asked him out.
Steve thought he had finally come to learn to accept the loss of the people he had left behind. And really for the most part he had: he now accepted Peggy and the Howling Commandos as a part of his past. The lives they had lived without him were good ones, he had come to realize that and find comfort in it. But, Tony and Nat? God, that was too new. Too fresh... Too much.
"Is this one of those gotcha film things that have been going around the internet?" Steve had said. He had remembered Bucky talking about a recent online trend where people filmed ordinary folks walking into the most absurd orchestrated scenarios, for some kicks.
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Tony himself was shocked at first, but when he felt Steve’s lips pressed up against his he couldn’t help but melt into it. The feel of Steve’s warm hand as it slid from his waist to the small of his back had Tony in a slight shiver and a small gasp at his mouth. Steve used the opening to further deepen the kiss with a brief touch from his tongue. When Tony gave a moan in response, Steve finally pulled back.
Steve barely had time to blink, before Tony had him shoved up against the wall while he said for further emphasis, “You fucking don’t Rogers.”
Nat seemed to bristle at the response, so Steve had cut in.
But it seemed he had no need for worry, as Tony had asked Steve if he was willing to sketch a handful of drawings for some of the upcoming projects he was working on.
This was further cemented the day Howard brought Tony to an auction. The proceeds were to go to charity, and Howard had spent a good portion of the time trying to impart to Tony that as an influential person of wealth, it was necessary to go to events like these in order to earn the goodwill of the general public. It was also supposedly a great way to  network and build relationships too. Never say Howard didn’t know how to work the business game. Tony figured that his own love and interest for charity work came more from his mother than his father. It was also one of the reasons why he seldom went to these charity functions, preferring instead to donate the money or send a representative—anything to separate himself from his father.
Before he could make a quiet retreat, Dummy squealed and raced over to join in the fun. Barnes greeted him with a wave, then blinked and peered around at Tony.

“Steve I swear to—” An admittedly masochistic part of Steve wanted Natasha to have the chance to finish her threat, because he was morbidly curious who or what, precisely, she would swear to; God definitely wouldn’t make the list. What happened next, though, was better.
“I’m thinking about keeping you in that harness and taking you out for breakfast,” he said impulsively. “Any interest?”
Phil was still shuddering through the aftershocks of an intense climax when he felt a hand on his leg that could not belong to either of his current partners, not even with Natasha’s hyper flexibility taken into account. He looked down to find Tony in a cross-legged pose at his feet. Both Steve and Bruce were keeping careful, attentive eyes on him, but as neither seemed inclined to interfere, Phil reached down and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair; his curls were even more dishevelled than usual, and it was surprisingly difficult even in the immediate aftermath of orgasm to keep his grip light, not turn it into something demanding or inviting.
“Just a ton of reading that I barely understand for the new program. I don’t know, Tony, I’m starting to wonder if I really was right to stir all this up. It’s made so many problems already, and not just for me.”
First, apologies that this is getting posted a bit late. My partner and I are house-hunting, and the stress of that combined with some heightened general posting anxiety and the fact that some of the themes in this chapter hit very close to the bone for me personally made it challenging for me to actually hit publish. Thank you for your patience.
“Not sure I want your cast-off breakfast,” he stalled for time. Tony grinned and pulled a cloth from the top of a basket of homemade mini blueberry bran muffins. Steve's stomach growled.
“Plausible deniability, baby. If this ends up hurting us on the market tomorrow, the Board has no cause to say you knowingly did something to endanger the company.” As a peace offering, he took her foot into his lap and began massaging it just the way he knew she liked after a long day in towering heels. She groaned and tipped her head back even as she muttered discontentedly about how she’d had to put up with Rescue hovering in her window all day like a ‘damn Iron Bat.’ (Tony was so copywriting that.)
“I’m sorry, JARVIS. I didn’t think about the fact that that would have been upsetting for you, too.”
“Want to take a walk, go check out the shop?” Natasha slipped her arm through the loop of his elbow, deftly guiding him down the stairs as the others made pleasant conversation about the challenges of cliffside architecture; Rhodey, who had helped him build and design the place in this universe as well as Tony’s own, was a font of useful insight on this front.
“You can’t seriously be planning to execute Clint’s plan?” Clint’s outrage doubled at that, and he vowed to refuse to put out for Steve for at least two weeks. Phil rolled his eyes.
“Rhodey, that’s, when did you—”
“Aunt May kicked me out.”
“Explain it to me anyway.” This was enough to stop Tony briefly in his tracks. His own team had never really shown much interest in
in moments of crisis, sat with a stiffness that was entirely at odds with his sprawling posture. A rumbling noise from outside was enough to confirm Thor’s mood without looking at him at all (and damn this meant Steve was going to have to make yet another apology to the meteorological society for his teammate’s unpredictable effects on weather pattens.) Bruce’s head was buried in his hands while he took the long, deep and measured breaths that meant he was trying to avoid an unplanned transformation.
This babbled confession/rant was greeted with a silence so thick and extended that it seemed to swallow the room whole. Even Tony’s breathing, which he knew was loud from agitation, and from the tightness in his chest, seemed absorbed by the vacuum it created. When Steve finally spoke it should have come as a relief, except that his voice came out cold and ravaged and nothing at all like how Steve was supposed to sound.
“Whatever your brother’s motivations are, ours don’t come from overprotection. They come from strategy. And there’s just no strategic value to using you as bait this early in the op. If these guys turn out to be nothing but low-level terrorists getting by on a half-baked plan and some luck, then it’s beneath you to be involved.” Shuri appeared to take this analysis seriously; the nearly half a minute she took to consider it was the longest Steve had seen her quiet during the course of the conversation.
“Sorry. I. Sorry. This is…it’s a little weird for me.” Clint shrugged.
“Well I mean right this second I’m thinking a lot about that voice, because damn, Barnes. I’m betting there isn’t much you couldn’t talk me into—or out of, for that matter.” After the strength of his earlier display, Bucky barely reacted to this at all, features schooled into something neutral. He stayed quiet, though, which Tony could only read as an invite to continue. That was pretty nervewracking; he had once been a pro at dirty talk, but Tony was the novice in this universe, especially with the kinky stuff. All he had to work with was honesty, which was way harder than just spouting off random words designed to get his partner off as quickly as possible. “Well I used to have this—this thing. For Captain America, and his, um. Sidekick.” Bucky stayed silent, though his steely expression gave way to something more heated, and a little amused if the very slight crinkles near his eyes were anything to go by.  (Oh God this was humiliating, why had Tony picked
“Tell me about your week?” he asked, finding himself meaning it just as sincerely as if he really hadn’t seen Steve for days.
“Would you like to talk about some of the plans I have to help us move forward on this issue? Or do you wish to drop it for now?” Tony chose the former. Loathe as he was to return to this topic, he was even less inclined to let his curiosity keep feeding his anxiety. (Those two were old and terrible pals.) “It was pushing too fast to put you in front of something as fraught as a mirror, and to be mixing the dynamics of a scene in there as well. I can see that now. But I meant what I said about lying, and about the fact that it’s not something I’ll accept from you. I especially will not accept it when it’s the kind of lie where the purpose is to diminish you, in my eyes or in your own. I think it’s fair, then, to say that we need to get you working on being honest, yes?”
“And I…he, I mean, wouldn’t do it. The other me wouldn’t sign, wouldn’t even discuss it. He left, and somehow he, their Bucky, and Tony ended up in Siberia. Where—” Steve halted, and Bruce smoothly took over.
The phrasing was very old-world, having fallen out of fashion while Steve was in the ice. And it wasn’t something they generally used anyway given their poly dynamics. Every once in a while, though, usually when a one-on-one scene was particularly intense, the Dominants could still be prone to short bursts of possessiveness. Bruce hadn’t let this stop him from caring for Tony, but he acknowledged it now with a warm, understanding smile.
thing, Steve. It means that you have met the goal you established in one of our earliest sessions: you have learned to honour the memory of Tony Stark without being consumed by it. I am, if you’ll permit me to say so, immensely proud of everything you have accomplished in these sessions.”
An unexpected jealousy flared at the mention of Rhodes and Pepper. It wasn’t that Steve had ever had a problem with either of them before, but once Tony had gotten together with the team, they’d ended up growing apart. With this Tony, they were something essential, relationships that far exceeded that of an old college buddy or a brief flirtation-turned-CEO. Nat had reported that Tony had permitted them, and only them, to be with him when he’d broken down during Steve’s absence, and now he was turning to them for advice about sex and submission…
“Uh…hey. Bad time?” Tony. Tony was
“Okay, so we’ve decided then? We’re going with the independent leatherworker, Kala Ipo. Everyone raise your hands one time so that we can make this official and close this tumultuous chapter please.”
After watching fondly as the large green figure ambled out of sight, Tony turned his attention back on the living room. There were two piles of paper, one lined and one unlined, on the coffee table, alongside a small selection of pens ranging from a simple ballpoint to one of Tony’s most expensive fountain pens. Coulson’s intent was more than clear, and while Tony had kind of brought the apparent ban on tech during ‘homework’ time on himself by using it to cheat on the last round, that didn’t mean he couldn’t be grumpy about having to return to the stone age.
Several hours later, he was feeling much less charitable in his assessment of Steve Rogers. Initially, Peter had retreated to his room after greeting Bucky and Sam in an attempt to give them time to catch up. But his near-constant isolation over the past several weeks meant he was on top of all of his homework, and the prospect of spending his first full day living in a superhero compound alone and brooding felt a little too bleak, even for him.
“Yes, Clint.” The hand dropped back to his cock at once, that same loose, possessive hold from before. In seconds, Tony was on his way to more than half hard.
They were just words. Pretty words, words Tony was familiar enough with the aftermath of subspace to have expected to have
“Natasha—”
“I mean…look, when the Soldier persona came out right after you surrendered, it seemed a clear enough manifestation of trauma that you and I both talked about him as a relatively separate entity, someone who had been created against your will and who you unfortunately had to share a body with on occasion. Not quite an enemy, but definitely not someone we wanted to stick around either.”
“No Phil? Or Bruce?” he asked, wanting to at least give them a fighting chance.
He gave Steve another slow grind of his hips, and Steve let out a groan letting his head fall back on the bed. Looking at Steve then - his pupils blown wide with lust and his dick straining the tight material of his pants - Tony decided he needed to speed up the process and get this man’s dick out.
Tony let out a sigh and ran his fingers through his hair, when a thought occurred to him.
Finish the mission, report it, and on to the next.
Within the year, Tony had pretty much everything he could find that once belonged to Steven Grant Rogers. It wasn’t too hard: Steve didn’t actually posses much to begin with. Since Steve didn’t have a next of kin, all of his belongings had been seized by the government. They didn’t much care for the more personal belongings of Steve, so most of it had been sold off. Tony had managed to track down most of it by going through their records of sales. Anything associated with the Captain himself was easily found through auctions or by the people themselves boasting about them.
“My name is Steve Rogers, and I’m from the future.” Steve blinked. Well that was not what he was expecting.
. . .
Tony felt the pressure slowly start to build and he warned Steve that he was close.
This could not be happening. Tony couldn’t possibly be able to something so absurd. Okay sure, he could sing, his mother had honed his talent for it at a young age much to his father's displeasure. But his father had managed to finally put a stop to it when he had reached an age where it had been deemed inappropriate to continue with such frivolous activities. His mother had always supported him in his talents, but it was always cancelled out by his father's disdain for them. He had gotten better about it now, but he still didn't think he could imagine singing again in front of an audience after so long. And for his favourite rock band no less- wait.
“God, Tony... I, It’s been so long. I thought...” Steve murmured into his neck, his hold on Tony tightening just a tad as he spoke.
"So let me get this straight. You're saying there's this Thermos dude who comes in and wipes half the universe, and then five years later, Tony invents time travel so that we can find some magical stones, kick his ass, and get everyone back?" Clint  said after the few seconds of stretched silence that occurred when Future Steve was done.
“ What’s the report?” Steve asked Nat. He was in full Captain mode now.
The assembled team before Steve had all turned to look at him then, giving him looks that varied from confusion and empathy to snarky amusement. The later had come from Clint, who Bruce had contacted earlier when they received confirmation of the plan. Clint, upon hearing that they had come across a chance to save Nat, had immediately dropped everything and showed up a half hour later at the compound insisting that he was to be going along with them.
With his decision made, Tony went back to work on his latest project. He had been thinking about it for a while. The would be to end it all—Ultron. Talking it over with Bruce had gone over well enough, but it had been in a purely hypothetical sense. Tony had ideas for Ultron and he had secretly been going over the specs in his lab for a while now.
It was easy tracking the man down, as he often hung out in the same places day in and out. Steve knew that it was the semblance of normalcy Bruce had craved for all these years that drove him to do so.
All of a sudden, Tony let out a startled moan: he had felt a hot liquid suction on his right nipple. He looked down to see that Steve had started sucking on it and the burn of his beard was doing wonderous things to his libido.
After the collection was in his possession, Tony made sure to curate it with as much care and dedication as Pepper did with the art pieces he “owned”.
This was his chance to do better. Ensure that this time they didn't leave anything unsaid: didn't brush things over, choosing to ignore the hurt between them that they still so clearly felt. He had done that once, thinking that it would be easier,
Just when Tony was about to break the silence, Steve beat him to it again by pulling away just a bit from the embrace so that he could give Tony a quick kiss on the lips. He then let his head fall so that he could rest his forehead on Tony’s.
Bruce might have sensed the odd tension, for he quickly jumped in to elaborate on Steve’s remark.
"Uh, not that it isn't great seeing Cap now totally living up Stark's ass, but I for on would still prefer if we had your future experience to guide us."
This reality had already changed, the whole mess with Loki escaping with the tesseract ensured that. So what was there to stop him from changing it a little for the better?
The silence had grown with every second left unanswered, and Tony felt himself continue to grow warmer under Steve’s gaze.
Steve watched as Tony's chest rose and fell, in and out, in the slow and steady rhythm that signaled a deep sleep.
“You took over,” Steve repeated, giving Tony a deadpan look.
Nat was someone who had been with Steve during his toughest times. She was right there with him after Ultron, even when everyone else had left. She was the one who knew him best when it came to the toughest calls; how he would never back down once he had made up his mind.
Last week!? Okay, clearly he'd fallen behind on Avengers' updates, but hey, it had been a trying week. What with Obie breathing down his neck to get the latest tech designs in, while also keeping up with his classes and trying to get time in to work on his A.I. project. Either way he'd barely had a moment to get some proper sleep in, let alone some leisure time.
“Uh, okay. Thanks, I guess.” and with that Tony left the stage and headed out.
It’s more than one date. It’s multiple. Their first date (and doesn’t that send a thrill up Tony’s spine), is at an Italian Pizzeria that Steve found when he was busy soul searching or whatever, during his trip across the country. Surprisingly, it’s only a few blocks down from the Tower. Apparently, Steve found it on his way back and now frequently visits it on their days off.
"He was a good man, and he cared about making sure everyone was safe. I can't speak for your other teammate, I'm sure she too did a lot of good for the world, but going back in time to prevent their deaths will only create further chaos."
"I, Nat - what? You're -" Was all that Tony managed to get out, as he focused on Nat. She was here and alive, and he just couldn't think straight.
The last thing Tony remembered was placing his hand atop Pepper's heart as she told him to rest. His head fell to the side and he saw the blurry face of Steve looking at him from afar before his vision faded and he fell into a deep sleep.
"We came to you, to figure out how to use the stone to isolate the effect of the time reversal, to concentrate a singularity of time on the body, without affecting the present reality." And for good measure Bruce added, "Since, you know, you are the current expert on all things magical."
“...”
.” He said, and wow Steve never thought his voice could ever sound so raw.
Steve wasn’t too familiar with the man, but judging from they way he dressed and held himself, he could tell that he was quite the proud character.
It isn’t until later that night, when Steve walks him to his room and gives him a quick kiss goodnight before walking back to his room, that Tony allows himself to think. He’s fucked. He’s super fucked. Since, now he can definitely imagine what it would be like dating Steve, and he knows that if he continues to go down this path he’s going to have his heart completely broken. Because how could anyone possibly recover after they’ve had the chance of dating Steve Rogers?
“J.A.R.V.I.S., where is Steve right now?”
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
Tony knew that he should take this opportunity to get up and leave, after all he had gotten it out of his system, right? And either way, Steve was no good for him, there was no point in him prolonging their inevitable ruin.
“...uh, ya that’s way to weird for Loki to pull off, I think I’ll go with believing this guy now.” Clint said,, and Steve found himself inclined to agree.
“What?” Tony blinked, clearly not having understood what he was hearing.
Utterly spent, Tony watched as Steve slowly started to drift off, the rigorous activity on his end entirely tiring the man out.
A  stabilizing hand centred him at the small of his back and turned to see it belonged to a rugged and weary Steve. He had a bit of stubble growing which for some reason was a bit of a shock to Tony. He didn’t even think the man was capable of growing one - well, not really but it was still a bit weird seeing the always put together Steve looking anything but.
The kiss itself didn’t last that long, but the passion Steve put into it did get the message through. Steve honestly seemed to like him too. Tony was pulled from his thoughts of the kiss when Steve spoke up.
“Join the club,” Steve commiserated, taking a swig of the liquor for himself. “Remember the part where I didn’t tell him that Bucky killed his parents, and then beat the crap out of him for being upset about it? It’s kind of unbelievable I ever thought it work between he and I, really. There’s way too much baggage.”
And I just want to be an idiot, your idiot, well, not yours because we broke up, but the person you knew. But on the upside there are chips here. Really good chips. I should have brought them. Maybe I should go get them now, I bet I can sneak back into the kitchen no problem.”
“Then
Steve.”
“Uh—check in with the kid. If he wants to talk alone tell him I’ll meet him down in the shop. If he comes up here I’ll assume he’s fine with company.”
Bruce padded into the room somewhere around Tony’s fourth cup. He wore a pair of faded, soft-looking jeans with a black and white striped v-neck. The latter was more stylish and playful than anything Tony had ever seen either version of Bruce wear. He watched appreciatively as Bruce went through the motions of making himself a cup of tea.
Privately, Tony thought that knowing what was going on his own damn head was a pretty low bar he was struggling to meet, but as all previous experience suggested Bruce would not be pleased by this assessment, he held his tongue and took an overlarge bite of his banana. He very nearly choked, and Bruce kindly restrained the laugh that was trying desperately to escape.
because it was a good bet that he might need one at any given moment. So he stayed right where he was and let Dummy look his fill. Eventually, the bot’s focus seemed to settle on Tony’s chest, and he reached his arm out, much more slowly and cautiously this time, to rest lightly atop the arc reactor. “Is it different from his? I guess that would make sense. I don’t really need mine anymore, it’s mainly just a housing unit for nanoparticles.” Dummy’s arm didn’t move. When Tony shifted experimentally in the bed, the arm remained planted, unmoving. (Oh. Oh. Dummy didn’t care about the tech. To Dummy, familiar only with the older models, the glow of the arc was proof of life.) “Aww buddy. Yeah, I’m alright, I promise. But it’s been a long, I don’t know, decade, and I could really use some coffee. Can we continue this in the kitchen?”
Tired, alone, and scared, Tony leans on some of his oldest friends. Meanwhile, the team struggles to piece together what happened in the MCU-verse and where they go from here.
I have to admit my own role has left me more conflicted than I had anticipated. I have done precisely as I should have, protecting the Stones, reality, and the greatest number of people possible. Yet I wish there had been another option. Stark’s sacrifice should not have been necessary, and many of those he sought assistance from in the early days of Thanos’s efforts know this, and have no choice but to live with that regret.
“They’re just about ready for you.”
Tony didn’t speak, but he rose to his feet and started undoing his belt buckle. Rhodes quickly engaged Steve in a conversation about several pieces of art hanging throughout the house, undoubtedly to make the moment seem as low-stakes as possible.
am very much aware that you’re a submissive, Tony. I think it’s you who needs some clarification,” he said. “Kneeling is nice, and you look gorgeous on your knees for me, but it’s not like the posture itself is somehow magic or some shit. It’s the message behind it that matters, the surrender. You can give a Dominant all of that just as easily in ways that won’t leave you in pain for days afterward. Understand me?”
“Believe it or not, it creates short-term telepathy. It’s come in handy a few times when we haven’t had access to the comms, or when I’m treating someone who’s unable to speak but can open their mouth.”
“Earthiness is next to coffee godliness, Barton,” he snapped back. Even though he suspected he was filling in some well-worn lines of Mark II’s, it was damn true; nothing lingered on the tongue and paired perfectly with almost every breakfast food as the Sumatran roast he knew Clint was talking about.
“We’re already on step one of the plan for the day, Tony; we’re watching television. Admittedly, it would be a lot more useful as an exercise if these fools had explained, and if they would kindly desist with the chatter before I’m forced to write them both up.” Clint grinned and mimed zipping his mouth closed, but Natasha cocked her head and stared at Coulson, who cleared his throat and stood, beginning to clear their dishes.
“Good.” With hands that appeared to be very slightly shaking, Bruce opened the fridge and unearthed several plates of food. In addition to threatening post-its directed at Thor and Clint, each of them was covered in clear cling wrap, and contained all manner of small, bite-sized portions of food. One was a mix of fruit, cheese and meat; another contained a colourful variety of vegetables with several kinds of dip in the centre. The third was a selection of desserts including bite-sized brownies, mini-cakes and bright macarons.
Edited 3 May, because somehow in copy-pasting I deleted two responses! D'oh.
"Damn, of course you are. I’m sorry, Tony. I think after everything you had been through we were all focused on trying to make sure you got a break. But I should have realized…” He shook his head. “Did you have something in mind?”
“Not unless you know something about your recent activities that I don’t. I actually just wanted to make contact with you, maybe set up a meeting.”
“They can’t have him back,” Clint vowed suddenly, shrugging when all the eyes of the room were sharply on him. “I’m just saying. I know he has no intention of going anyway since he thinks it could risk undoing things, but even if somehow it turns out that that’s not the case, I’m going to fight for him. They don’t fucking deserve him, they never did.”
Clint’s hand darted out to encircle Tony’s wrist. (He wondered if Clint was even conscious of the way that his fingers automatically found Tony’s pulse point, or if after so many years at SHIELD it was more an involuntary reflex than anything.)
, who prefers not to use her royal title.
“In the later years of his life, probably fueled by his failed efforts to ensure his son would never be oriented, Howard became obsessed with the idea that work could be a longer term cure for orientation. He funded a study, which wasn’t completed until after he died, trying to prove that extending the workday and making minimal allowances for orientational absences or delays would eventually lead subjects to be able to self-stabilize their cortisol and Dominin or subtonin levels. Instead, the study found that even the standard workday was enough to have a substantially negative impact on levels. Most people who don’t engage in any orientational activities after they leave home are actually in moderate dep by the time the workday ends. Stark Industries has known for decades that either shortening the workday or providing some kind of program like Wakanda’s is important and necessary for people’s health, and they suppressed that knowledge. Or at least the person who signed off on the report after Howard’s death and subsequently buried its findings has.”
They remained there in a kind of standoff, Natasha offering no more than she had to, and Steve trying not to feel hurt by how secretive she was being. This had once been her MO, of course, but he’d thought they were long past that, had assumed that Natasha knew she could trust them with anything at this point.
The subject doing the suggesting seems to be curiously absent.” Before Tony could muster a response to this, Phil turned the page and continued reading. “
Clint did hear it, and the playful smirk evaporated from his face as if it had never been there at all, morphing into warm concern. That sight in itself was reassuring enough that Tony probably could have continued the scene and been fine, but Clint wasn’t having it. He got them set up in the living room and had JARVIS put together a streaming menu of all of Tony’s favourite shows, even the embarrassing ones he would never have confessed to liking in the first place. He wrapped Tony in his heavy blanket, and held him close, and told him over and over again how good he was. When the others started trickling into the penthouse, Clint told them too, practically
As he tried to balance his body’s need for food with its growing desire for sleep, Steve looked around at his team. Clint and Nat sat with their chairs facing one another, their relief at being reunited palpable. (The sight made Steve positively ache with loneliness.) Bruce and Thor, the other two enhanced members of the team, were eating with decent appetites; Bruce, though, retained enough of his usual anxious, twitchy energy that he couldn’t seem to decide what or who to look at. They all appeared at least as exhausted as Steve felt…well, all of them except Stark, who kept jogging over to the counter to refresh condiments, napkins, and drinks for the rest of the team.
“For now it’s an extension of the original contract. She wanted to make sure that what we had still worked for us outside of Wakanda since we’ll be going back and forth so much. But she said that no matter what happened going forward, our time together had been important to her and she wanted to honour that. You put one back around Stark’s neck yet, Sir?”
“I’m not going anywhere. None of us are going anywhere.” Tony’s voice was rasping and ravaged, but none the less decisive for all the pain bleeding into it. Steve glanced around the room, practically begging someone else to speak. He’d seen two versions of Tony under nearly every imaginable (and several un-imaginable) form of stress, but never before had he run into the issue of Tony choosing not to act. ‘Tony Stark’ and ‘retreat’ were laughable concepts to try to put together, and even without the bigger picture of who Spiderman—Peter—was to Tony, it just didn’t fit. No one else seemed to know what to do with the idea either, with the sole exception of maybe Natasha. (Was she keeping things back, even now, protecting whatever secrets Tony had given her and only her about the other Peter Parker?)
“That’s pretty standard. Most Dominants prefer to administer discipline as close to the actual infraction as possible. It makes the causal link between the behaviour and the punishment a lot clearer. More importantly, it prevents the submissive from making bigger mistakes out of guilt. That last one becomes a bigger issue when we’re talking about someone with subtonin in their system, because most subs and switches are wired to seek out punishment when they know they deserve it, and to escalate if they don’t receive it quickly. How did you feel after the spankings were over?”
a feint, it was both genius and slightly unfair of Bucky. Tony had only been around other people in submissive headspace in small doses, and never when he was this deep in ‘space himself; he had no real concept of the strong bonds that could form between subs and other subs or switches in submissive headspace. They still looked to their Dominants for comfort and guidance, of course, but with the corresponding desires to please their Dom (and anxieties about disappointing them) absent, submissives that trusted one another were known for an unfiltered, almost giddy camaraderie. If anything in Tony, biological or otherwise, reached out and recognized Bucky in that same way, then he might be the only one capable of drawing this information out of Tony without spoiling the relaxed post-scene mood they’d all worked hard to set. Steve couldn’t quite bring himself to reprimand his partner, though, not with his Dominant instincts to protect mixing with his sheer frustration at learning there was yet another aspect of Tony’s life they were ignorant of. This couldn’t go on.
“Tony is being taken care of. I promise.”
“I…don’t know, Clint. I didn’t have time, the last few years, to—” Clint’s hand shifted, pressing down on a knotted muscle near Tony’s left shoulder blade. He yelped, though by the time the noise had escaped him, the touch had already turned into more of a massage, Clint working some of the tension out of the same muscle he’d just punished with clever, confident fingers.
Bucky Barnes: always good for the kill-shot, Steve thought. He’d inserted himself in Tony’s relationship with the team, on both sides of the equation, from almost the very beginning. No wonder things were so confused between them all, no wonder Steve couldn’t seem to stop loving Tony no matter how hard he tried.
what I need, Tony, don’t you see? What helps a Dom in drop more than anything else is to know that their submissive is safe and happy, that they’re still allowed the honour of caring for them. You are everything I could possibly want right now, my good, good boy. No more apologies, hmm?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because I figured you’d have started to regret kicking him out about five minutes after it actually happened, and I didn’t want you to be any more worried than you had to be.”

“No. Let them see it. Hell, let ‘em project it on every screen in the Tower if they want. Just, no incoming communications, alright, J?”
The sixth response also contains a vision that is somewhat spoilery for a future event. A previous reply from Dr. Strange has actually already hinted at it, but this one is a lot more overt, so if you don't want to know anything about what night be coming down the road, steer clear!
A yell from down the hallway was followed by a loud crash, and a piece of colourful plastic skidded to a stop at Peter’s feet. He picked it up to find a bright purple Lego brick. Its owner stood several feet away, hovering over the remains of what Peter was fairly sure had been the Knight Bus. After a few moments of painful hesitation, he picked the Lego up and crossed the space between him and Ned to hold it out to the boy who had once been his closest friend. Ned barely glanced at him as he snatched the piece from his hand.
“I’m, I appreciate that Tony. I really do. But I’m just not ready to hear it yet. I need to go down to the gym or something—I—I can’t do this right now.” Steve nodded at Pepper, then half-stumbled to his feet and departed the room. Pepper stood and crossed the room, pulling Tony’s head against the taut skin of her stomach and stroking his hair while he tried with everything he had not to wonder if he’d ruined the best thing that had ever happened to him.
“I had thoughts along pretty similar lines,” Pepper confided. “And now he might leave.  We might lose him all over again, and the cruelest thing we could do in this instance is fight for him. This whole superhero gig, I just don’t see what any of you see in it. Seems like a big cosmic joke to me.”
The ID of Tony's killer might also be an issue for some of you. (This is an even more spoilery note than usual, so skip it if you want to be surprised.) I want to be clear that I don't see Wanda as a one-dimensional villain, and that while I have major problems with her characterization in the MCU, I consider that a fundamental problem with the writing, not with the character herself. My depiction of her here is based on a kind of blend between the intense desire for revenge on Tony that we see in the movies, and the comics' rather more compassionate and nuanced depiction of her as someone who desperately wants to be a good person, but whose powers and mental state are also deeply unstable.
John Searle. “What Your Computer Can’t Know.”
. Nevermind dating Peter again, would she ever even want to catch a glimpse of him after all she had heard and witnessed last night? And what were the chances that suffocating himself with a pillow would actually be successful? “The first time I ever really had a crush on someone, I accused them of sleeping with another guy based entirely on a misunderstanding of what the word fondue meant.”
So, good news! The fact that I am kind of living and breathing this verse at the moment combined with my having recently completed the other major story I was working on means I'm able to commit to updating this story every Friday for the foreseeable future. Yay!
But the further away they got from the scene, the worse the feeling in Steve’s gut became. He still couldn’t put a precise finger on what was concerning him, but his mind kept returning to the way Tony had fought him at the beginning of their scene, and to the team’s descriptions of what they had taken to calling his ‘dark days,’ when Tony would wake up withdrawn and angry, resisting the Dominance for all he was worth. Not only was this complete shift too sudden, but it just plain wasn’t Tony. He might not face the same degree of resentment toward submission that his counterpart from this universe had, but it would never be an easy or a simple thing for him.
"I want you to draw me like one of your french girls." Tony had said, the very first time he had walked through his door.
The next person sitting at the table was the person known as the WINTER Soldier. Tony wasn’t sure where he got the name from, but fans mostly just referred to him as WINTER. He was well known amongst the fans for his wicked metal arm. Tony found himself salivating at the thought of getting a chance to take a look at it and improve upon it. It was an intriguing piece of work, and something tony had never seen on any other amputee. WINTER himself was very secretive about both it as well as himself, so not much was known about either the arm or him. He was however, known for being the bass player and musical genius behind the band. He along with Black Widow, who was sitting at the far end of the table, were both the creative forces behind composing the music. Widow herself was also a popular DJ. But in the band she either played electric violin or electric guitar.
Tony was still furious at Steve. Which completely justified why he currently had him pushed up against the wall, while he desperately kissed him.
”I...” But Tony just looked at the ground.
“Steve, wait! Don’t go—” But by then it was too late, and Steve had already opened the door. “...there.”
Other men feel liberated
At the question, Tony felt himself flush. He didn’t know if Steve was trying to imply anything, but it was mortifying to think that Steve might have an inclination that it wasn’t just admiration that Tony had towards the man.
“That’s interesting, that he’d be so open to exploring submission and so sure that Domination isn’t for him.” Phil was fairly sure he knew where his partner’s mind was taking him, and he wondered the same thing. But Tony had made his position on having any blood taken extremely clear, and without proof that their universe might be impacting him on a physiological level, there simply was no point in wondering too much.
Thankfully, Jordan got his feet back under him fairly quickly after that, speaking confidently and passionately about his experience in the SHIELD scholarship program and his goals for future projects; he showed a particular interest in the communications side of things, and happily shared several compelling thoughts about future public outreach programs. To Steve’s mind, what was equally impressive was Jordan’s complete absence of shame about the fact that he wanted to use his mind to SHIELD’s benefit rather than weaponizing his fit, muscular frame toward the spying end of things. For all that the old bravado had long since fallen to the wayside, there was still something about Captain America that brought it out in some Doms. (Yet another reason it was important that he meet all their potential incoming agents.)
“JARVIS you devious little shit. You’re seriously going to make me reverse the polarity on this thing?”
“I have to hope that he would have at least tried,” Phil said eventually, after giving the matter a great deal of quiet deliberation. “That’s part of what a handler’s job is supposed to be, anyway; not just making sure you’ll all be in fighting shape, but ensuring your health and wellness of the battlefield as well. It’s…I find it almost criminal that the lot of you weren’t assigned another handler after his passing. From the sounds of it your Captain Rogers was in no position to lead the team on his own. Whether intentionally or not, I think all of you were set up to fail. And I’m very sorry for that.”
In the weeks since the press conference, the team had developed somewhat of a truce with one Virginia Potts. If Tony wasn’t available, Pepper made sure to get the all-clear from at least one other member of the Avengers before showing up in the Tower; in exchange, one of them (usually Phil, but sometimes Natasha) called her once a week to keep her updated about how things were progressing with Tony. It was still a bit awkward sometimes, on both sides; Pepper still harboured some resentment about being unintentionally pushed out of the other Tony’s life, and the team still wrestled with the occasional bout of jealousy over the seemingly unconditional trust the new version of the man displayed toward her.
Bucky had thrown the bedroom window open wide first thing; a light breeze carried with it the sounds of lapping waves, seagull cries, and the rustle of palm-tree leaves. Tony had drifted in and out of a contented half-consciousness for most of the morning. This time, though, he was pretty certain he was awake for good, the need for caffeine and food (in that order) finally overcoming his desire to stay for as long as possible in this suspended space between waking and dreaming. He started to make experimental movements, checking in with his body in a way that was practically instinct by this point.
“Gift from Sam. I had this book where I kept track of all the things people told me I needed to look up about the future. He was horrified to find out I didn’t know the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek, and immediately took to trying to get me on his side about which one was better.” There was an awkward pause that lasted several beats where Peter tried and failed to come up with anything to say. This was absurd, because he had THOUGHTS about both Star Wars and Star Trek. Unfortunately, he was distracted by the way that the smile Steve wore now made him look several years younger than Peter had ever remembered. Even in old footage from the war, he’d always seemed older than his age. It was one of few things he’d felt the two of them had in common. (Was it weird to be upset that his mentor-frenemy sometimes seemed like he was doing better?) Steve cleared his throat and turned back to face the rapidly-darkening bacon. “Anyway I’m glad you’re up.”
"Well I kind of have to, don't I? You are Captain America after all."
Call for Participants: Study on Orientation and the Workplace
on these ridiculously expensive floors?” she’d pleaded.
“None of that, Jolly Green. You were really close. They
“I, uh, that won’t be a problem. That is, I’m not seein’ anybody at the moment, and even when I have in the past, it’s a standard part of any contracts that I offer that there will be a single exception even to strictly monogamous relationships. I wasn’t trying to be presumptuous, and I never named Tony specifically, but I was his first Dom. I couldn’t handle the idea of him needing me somewhere down the line and me having to say no.”
fell asleep listening to me complain about my bullshit once.” Out of nowhere, the skin near Bruce’s eyes flashed green. It was sudden, over in an instant, and accompanied by none of the other dozen or so signals that Tony needed to be getting the hell out of dodge. But it was unmistakable. “I wasn’t—it’s not like I blame you man, you’re definitely not
All of his admirably strategic thoughts were put rather on hold when Hulk leaned down, stuck his nose in Tony’s hair and sniffed. Audibly. Then a large green hand was reaching out, hovering near Tony’s arc reactor without touching it directly, followed by sound somewhere between a moan and a growl. It was quiet in a way that the Hulk so rarely managed to be, but all the more devastating a sound of pain for that.
And sort of relatedly, the last one contains some insecurity on the part of the Switches in the Tower about the Dominants having time/interest for them with a full-time sub around. This involves reference to a past event in which two of the Switches attempted to Dom for one another while not in the right headspace, which is not considered safe in this universe. No one is hurt beyond a tweaked muscle, but it's a serious issue that is taken seriously by the Dominant who is hearing about it.
“It isn’t his blood,” Tony concluded grimly.
This rather provocative comment spurred a debate that lasted nearly an hour. Through it all, the girl in the spider suit never made noise beyond the occasional grunt or chuckle. She never even took off her mask to eat or drink, even as the others demolished the small mountain of food that sat between them. Peter tried to ignore her, focus on the others. So what if the only other spider-enhanced person he knew was apparently kind of standoffish? However, this proved to be nearly impossible. His eyes kept trailing back toward her. She wasn’t setting off his Spidey Senses, so chances that she was an immediate threat were low, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was missing something. And Spider-Girl didn’t appear to be in a hurry to provide any answers.
“We shall send another team out at nightfall, then. The King has made it our upmost priority to ensure the safety of the Princess is secured prior to the exhibition.” Okoye was just as fierce and focused as Steve had remembered, though he suspected she was smiling just slightly when she added, “He does not wish to have to refuse her plan outright. He muttered something about incriminating weapons testing footage.” None of the highly disciplined women in the room laughed, but their amusement at the King’s fear of his sister’s reprisal was still plain. The only one who wasn’t smiling, he realized when he finally found her near the front, was Talia.
“Mine lover. Sleep still eludes you?” His own version of Thor had mostly grown out of speaking like he came out of an eighteenth century novel, and while hearing the guy talk about yeeting his hammer had been charming in its own way, it always felt weirdly nostalgic to hear the Thor of this universe. It also made it hard to be bitingly sarcastic toward the guy, even when he was managing it with the rest of the team just fine. He nodded, gesturing to the holographic screen floating near his left hand.
Steve looked…awful. Drawn and defeated and so painfully young. It was all wrong, the way Steve’s shoulders were slumped, the effort every simple movement seemed to cost him. The sight of Steve staring down at his boots like bending down to untie them would be his undoing set something prickling all along Tony’s skin.
Steve and Tony date. That's it. That's the chapter.
“The bloodwork,” Bruce agreed. “Why would he have reacted so strongly? He let me provide aftercare the other night so I don’t think, I mean, I hope it isn’t just a matter of trust.” Phil shook his head, enlarging several of the points on the chart.
It was, it transpired, a trap. Just not the kind Tony was expecting. Coulson didn’t strip him down and punish him for lying, or use some kind of sexual torture to force answers from him. He stood Tony, fully-dressed and bewildered, in front of a full-length mirror. For several long seconds Coulson said nothing, he just watched as Tony grew more and more uneasy at the sight of his own reflection.
“What. Happened.”
“I really liked London. One of my only missions to go absolutely perfect from top to bottom was there. I ended up with about an extra week to just hang around with Nat. We did the whole cultured thing, went to a bunch of museums and shit. I hadn’t told her, yet, that I had hearing issues and problems with reading, but she’d already figured it out, and she made sure to take us to the museums on days when there were ASL guides taking groups through. It was the first time I'd ever gotten to do something like that and actually understand what was happening.” Clint stopped speaking abruptly, as if the memory made him a bit more emotional than he’d wanted to get. Tony made a point of turning away for a moment under the guise of finding a different coloured pencil for Clint to use to chart the coordinates.
“I’ll get your coffee, and I’ll even text Phil to bring up the gluten-free bagels I’m positive he snuck out of the Tower for this morning, if you tell me us why you’re limping and what it is you’re looking for.” So Natasha was still annoyingly observant—the consistency was oddly comforting in the face of so many upsets of his expectations. Though his version never would have offered Tony a trade; she would have continued watching and learning in silence until she had the intel she need, then clobbered him with it. (Fuck, it was so much harder being around these two than it had been to be with Bruce the day before. The latter’s only real crime had been his absence. These two…how was he supposed to stop seeing their uncanny counterparts with the same faces, the same mannerisms, who had lived with him and fought with him and still never really cared for Tony at all, not until the end when it had been too damn late…)
“Okay. So if the contract is overwhelming you then we need to start by making it a bit more manageable. You’ve put a lot of question marks and notes around the stuff on pain. Not something you’ve done much before, right?” Tony shook his head. “One way to think about it is by type—the big ones are stinging, cutting, and thudding. JARVIS, sort all relevant tools and acts under those categories please?” The document was reorganized in seconds, and was already several pages shorter. “Any Dom worth your time will help you experiment with all of them anyway, so this isn’t supposed to be a definitive thing. Exploratory contracts are there to help your Dom get a clear sense of what your limits are and what you’re particularly interested in. They know things will evolve as you get more experience. That said, any initial thoughts on which of those styles might appeal more?”
As Steve and Tony began to hang out more often, Tony gradually began to spend a significant amount of time at Steve and Bucky’s place as well. And since he loved spending time there - “there’s so many things to fix Steve!” Tony would often say in explanation whenever Steve asked him why he liked his shitty apartment so much - Tony also spent a lot on making sure the place was properly stocked.
“Okay then Ironman, show us what you got.” Steve said. Let us hope his talent matches his attitude.
Steve blinked, and looked back up at him, clearly taken aback by the sudden change.
Steve sat on his bed in contemplative silence and mourning, when an odd thought occurred to him. Something that he hadn’t even questioned but now found himself pondering over. It was a long shot but it was worth talking over. With a decision made, he got up and went to see the one person left he could share this idea with.
The time stone was easy: he simply had to return it to the Ancient One, but the mind stone posed more of a challenge. He couldn’t return it back to SHIELD in good conscience knowing that he they'd been infiltrated by Hydra. The stone would end up back in the hands of Wolfgang von Strucker, and despite knowing that they would eventually end up retrieving it, there was still a whole lot of bad that could be prevented by not turning it over.
Steve shifted then, the angle changing just enough that Steve’s movements now caused a repeated onslaught against his prostate.
Clint was already sitting at the helm, getting the jet booted up and the others were dispersed throughout.
“Yes!” Tony replied as he scrambled up from his seat and quickly got up the stage, proceeding towards the mike.
He had been trying to apologize, and was spewing some crap about how he should have come to Tony sooner, should have worked out their problems and blah, blah, blah - he didn't care.
"It was Pepper’s idea wasn't it?"
Tony who was staring at the screen frozen with his mouth perfectly agape, while he blinked profusely. It had seemed he had finally broken Tony Stark.
Tony grabbed Steve’s dick, giving it a few generous pumps - the wet sound obscene to the ears -  that had Steve groaning, before lining it up with his entrance while he gradually lowered himself back onto it. Rolling his hips, he started to build up a rhythm.
"Well clearly not all of us, since your here." Tony quipped, giving Nat a bit of a side eye.
Steve honestly didn’t notice at first. He had acquired quite a significant amount of art supplies courtesy of Tony, but that had been upon Tony’s instance of wanting the best. Steve, who was seemingly always running low on supplies saw no reason to argue the matter and now even had his own art set up at Tony’s place.
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
“Um, Tony Stark? Can you please head up to the stage to begin your audition?”  said the manager, Phil.
The words however, snapped Tony back into the present, and reminded him, that this was still Steve... the man who had fucked off and left him alone for three years.
However, Rhodey finding out wasn’t nearly as bad as the moment when Steve himself walked into the room Tony had dedicated to him.
Steve brought him into his arms, and that caused the dam to burst. He was sobbing now. It was as if all his feelings were just now being allowed to come out after holding them in for so long.
So the next time Steve was at Tony’s place - watching some film that they had stopped to watch, after Steve made the mistake of not knowing a specific reference Tony had made - it had slipped out all too easily.
Steve just stood there in front of the room, completely at a loss.
"Rhodey, I can't possibly join a rock band. I mean I'm being swamped by S.I., my professors and my thesis projects! I don't have the time to start singing in a band. Besides, their lead singer was a woman! Wouldn't they be looking for somebody with a similar sound?"
. . .
Tony’s heart clenches hard in his chest and he feels his throat dry out, but he manages to look at Steve and breathes out,“If you’re sure.” And because he really is a little shit that needs to get his brain checked, he bites his lower lip and looks up at Steve under his eyelashes.
Despite all his faults, his father was a smart man and he had good intuition; he must have always known that there was a chance that the serum would have allowed for Steve to survive the ice.
“Sir, we are receiving an Avengers Alert.”
Bucky had whistled at the sight before saying, “Is that the latest gift from our resident Sugar Daddy?”
“You don’t fucking get to come down here, spewing all that apologetic crap, looking like fucking that!”
“You sure you all right now Stark? It sounded pretty bad there for a while.” Steve said aloud to Stark where he sat on a stool nursing a scotch.
“God, Tony, your so beautiful.” Steve said, looking shattered at the sight of Tony. Tony swallowed around the lump that formed in his throat at the way Steve was looking at him. It reminded him of - he shook his head trying to stop himself from going down that road again.
Tony, who had for the most part been a passive player so far had decided that he needed to remind Steve that he wasn’t the one to always lay down.
When the silence started to reach an unbearable length, Tony knew he had to say something. Gathering up courage he tried to speak, “Steve, I—I...” His throat felt dry, and he couldn’t seem to get the words out, but Steve deserved an answer, so he wet his lips, looked Steve in the eyes, and tried again. “It started off as just something to do, you know, another thing to pick up that my father abandoned—it didn’t hurt that I was a huge fan either. But, the thing is...the more I collected, the more I learned and... the more...invested I became. With every item I added, the more I learned about you, and it was just...You—” Tony felt his voice crack. He was mortified when he realized he was crying.
Clint raised a brow and made a face of obvious disbelief, but relented. "Sounds sus but, whatever you say Jolly Green."
With that said, Tony resigned himself to his fate and proceeded to start preparing for his audition.
"Yeah, and then Thanos brought him back to - ” Bruce started off nonchalantly, and then as if he had come to the same line of thought Steve had “ - no. You can't possibly - you think?"
On the way back, they decide to take a short stroll through the park before calling it a night. Despite it being dark, they both enjoy the midnight stroll. It’s as they are walking, simply basking in each other’s company, that Tony feels Steve’s hand brush against his. He holds his breath and lets it out slowly when Steve slowly entwines’ their hands. They both don’t say anything for a while. Tony’s heart beating a mile a minute while Steve holds his hand as they walk through the parks path. Finally, Steve speaks.
"Why can't we just take the stone from past you, when you come back to return it?" Clint clearly did not understand the need to involve Jane a second time, and Steve who still remembered his last encounter with Jane, found himself shuddering and feeling the same.
Tony was also shy to admit that his admiration of Steve didn’t end there. Tony had always had a crush on Captain America, but somewhere along the way of Tony’s research into Steve Rogers’ life had led the way to honest to god feelings for the man himself. Tony would deny it to his dying breath, but he had completely fallen in love with Steve Rogers; the soldier was everything Tony could ever hope to be, to want.
“I—I... It’s just... things... my father... collected...” Tony stammered out.
“This is...I can’t believe it!”
The words struck Steve, he couldn't speak for the rest of the world like Bruce, but he could speak for himself, and he could say without a shadow of doubt, that he definitely was not ready for a world without Tony Stark.
Howard had brought Tony a lot of Captain America merchandise too. From action figures to themed bedspreads, he made sure Tony had it all. Perhaps, in his own way, he was trying to connect his past with his future, or maybe he was trying to make sure the memory of his dear friend would live on with his family. Either way, there was no chance for Tony to grow up without becoming the biggest Cap fanboy ever.
“Yes, Tony. I - okay.” His voice may have quivered, but he looked Tony in the eyes as he spoke. Tony pushed back the feeling of sympathy that was trying to rear it's way. He couldn't give in. Not this time.
Also you guys should check out the song, RDJ stars in the music video!
Steve now sat at his old bed in the Avengers Compound contemplating all that he had lost. It had been partially destroyed during the fight with past Thanos, but the housing quarters had remained fairly intact. Pepper had vowed to get it rebuilt in Tony's honour, saying that it was what Tony would have wanted. For the Avengers to always have a home to come back to.
Tony quickly got off Steve then, leaving a confused Steve in his wake, but it only took him a moment before he was back to sitting on top of Seve, having left to grab the lube from the bedside drawer.
"That poor lady," Clint said, just as they had arrived at Vormir, "I am not looking forward to putting that Stone back into her."
Future Steve got up then, "Speaking of, I still have to head back there to return it."
"They're all fine, only suspended in time for the moment."
“Don’t you dare say that’s not true Steve. You are worth it. You’ve been worth it to me since the beginning! So don’t you-” But Steve cut him off before he could continue.
. . .
The words immediately brought a strong flush to his face, but the silence that ensued gave Steve courage to meet Tony’s eyes.
Now that he's returned, he finds himself at a loss.
“Steve,” He finally managed to gasp out, “I can’t, just please... I need you, now...” He broke off as a sob escaped him. He’d never felt so desperate in his life.
A man like me is dead in places
Easier said than done though.
“It’s obviously his stage name Clint, Phil just said it was Tony.” Nat said. Steve saw her roll her eyes at Clint in fondness, before directing her narrowed gaze towards Tony. “It seems the guy came prepared.”
He was shocked to see himself seated in the same position that Strange had just helped him up from. He took a step back to analyze the scene. All around him were the Avengers that he had fought with, surrounding a replica of himself in a slumped state. His comrades were all frozen, as if time had stopped for everyone except Tony and the ones who had rescued him.
Fuck, just his luck. He would be the one go and get embarrassed when it was the least convenient for him.
Despite Nat's whole debacle with the Soul stone, getting her back was a lot simpler than getting Tony back. Vormir was an isolated planet, so there wasn't much to affect timeline wise. Tony on the other hand, required more delicacy.
Strange finally looked at him then and paused a moment to take him in. His eyes gave him a once over before he dismissed him and looked back over towards Bruce. The action had caused Steve to prickle up and he found himself drawing up to stand at his full height.
“Yes, I did.” Rhodey simply replied.
Tony avoided Natasha’s eyes, which got a lifted eyebrow. Steve chose to ignore the smart comments and instead asked about the situation at hand.
“Huh. Little dude’s got a little bit of spunk to him. ” Bucky raised his pen towards Tony, “Gotta give him some points for that.”  he finished as he leaned back in his chair. It seemed Tony had piqued the interest of the rest of his band mates as well. That was why they worked so well together, Steve and his team had gone through a lot together and in terms of people they were often wary but when they weren’t, they always seemed to be drawn to similar people.
Tony, upon immediately hearing the words had shot up from the sofa.
And now that he’d returned the damn stones, all Steve could think of was all that he -  that they had lost. And wasn't that something? No matter how far Steve had thought he'd come, it always came back to those people that he had outlived, had left behind.
Contrary to popular belief, Tony didn’t have much experience dating. Sure he had gone out with a ton of people, but that was more for having a ‘fun’ night then it was for trying to get to know the person he was with. To be honest the only experience he had had, was when he was with Pepper, and look at how that turned out. First he was dying during the beginning of their relationship, and then he was staying up 72 hours at a time and having anxiety attacks left, right, and centre. Don’t get him wrong, dating Pepper was probably the best thing that had happened to him; right up there with his bots and JARVIS of course, but he could only put her through so much before she couldn’t take it any longer.
But Tony couldn’t say that all to Steve. He didn’t think he would ever know how.
Steve picked Tony up then, turning around so that he could better lay him on top the bed. He climbed up, fitting himself in between Tony’s legs.
“Only those that are worthy can wield Mjolnir, so what this man is saying must be true.”
He blinked his eyes, and put a hand up to block the light. Through his fingers he saw a black figure standing before him.
“Tony, I didn’t really mean an actual... you know. That would imply I’ve been... and we both know that hasn’t been happening. It was just something Bucky mentioned the other day, and well, it got me realizing. Why do you spend so much on me? You buy me all these things, you fix the things I won’t let you buy, and you just spend so much of your time that I know cost so much... on me. Why?”
“Howard collected all this?” Steve asked while he raised an eyebrow to Tony.
Ever so slowly, his vision started to clear.  Once he blinked back the tears that had formed upon the onslaught of bright light, he was shocked to see that the figure had been Strange. Why would he be seeing the sorcerer now?
Just before Tony’s knees hit the bed, he broke the kiss, and turned Steve around, pushing him to sit on the bed.
“Ironman, 19, and uh... student? That counts as an occupation right?” Tony replied with minimal hesitation.
After the first initial little kisses, the kiss starts getting heated. Steve grabs Tony’s waist tightly and pulls him that much closer. He bites tony’s lower lip and when Tony opens his mouth due to the slight twinge, Steve licks into his mouth and Tony can’t help but let out a little whimper. Steve pulls back a bit, and Tony brings himself forward chases for more of his taste.
"Steve, that, that might just work. We might be able to bring them to life but what then?"
He feels, rather then sees the moment where Steve gives a little jerk as if to stop himself from sudden movement. But Steve starts reaching out anyway, and now Tony definitely sees Steve as his hand lightly cups the side of Tony’s face, with his fingers curling into the back of Tony’s hair. His heart is thumping rapid fast; he wouldn’t be surprised if Steve could hear it with how loud it sounds in Tony’s ears.
“No, buddy, you’ve been perfect. Amazing. Way more than I deserve, honestly—” This garnered several energetic protests that Tony waved away. “Look, Steve’s right. It’s not you guys at all, it’s me. This, you all—it’s a lot. And you didn’t make me get swept up in it, none of you; I dove in head fucking first because that’s that I wanted. I wanted to just enjoy you and this universe and not think too hard about any of the rest of it. But now everything is so—well, I can’t
“Clint? Are you seriously in the vents with a broken ankle? Get outta there right now.” There was a bang, followed by a curse, and then a muttered ‘thanks for the heads up, JARVIS.’ Then Clint was crawling down out of the vents in his air boot, landing on Tony’s island with his hair covered in dust. “What were you doing?”
Steve was the first to come in. He still wouldn’t reveal how he’d managed to gather any background at all about Tony while he’d been on the other side of the world, but he reported that the development of Ultron (which all of them had been able to gather from Tony’s rather extreme reaction had ended rather badly) had coincided with mental attacks from the Scarlet Witch that Tony had never been asked about and had never elected to share with his team. Tony had also revealed that the wound on his abdomen, which Bruce had reported to all of them, had been caused by Thanos stabbing Tony with a piece of his own armour.
“Much like you, I specialize in those initial stages, the building up after the wreckage caused by loss. I am more than you need, now, and that is a
And to top off the truly horrible day he’d had trying to put fires out at SHIELD all day over the Wakandan orientation program, his therapist had given him
Which was how Steve had found himself inside one of the numerous Iron Man armours that dotted the penthouse. Each member of the team had allowed themselves to be spotted outside the armour a few times (none of Taskmaster’s people would have been foolish enough to believe the team would abandon Tony when they were facing a threat like this.) They also made sure to let several of the suits be taken out early, so that the invading forces could find them empty and assume all the suits were unmanned. Meanwhile, the team spent the majority of the battle hopping in and out of different suits. To avoid tipping their hand by having Taskmaster recognize any of their fighting styles, JARVIS mostly controlled the actual actions of the suits. He was just as vicious as Steve had seen him be on the day the other Tony had died, if slightly more restrained.
There are a host of potential reasons for this, but I would assume that much of it came down to the complicity of several members of the company in covering-up the study Howard had conducted. The combination of these actions on top of Stave’s betrayal made him deeply distrustful of the senior members of Stark Industries, and less able or willing to remember that there were others at the company who wanted and perhaps needed his time and attention.
“We’re lower on graphite than I’d like.
