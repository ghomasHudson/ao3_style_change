“I hope the extra wait wasn’t too boring on your end,” John said. “It was on mine. I finished my book with over forty minutes left on the train. But Sherlock says that he played that composition he’s working on for you. It’s nice, right? I’ve always been interested in selkies and the like. Sherlock’s been indulging me.”
“But I want to.”
“Never mind all that. I doubt that you’re calling only to annoy me.”
Mycroft didn’t bother refuting that.
It did Mycroft no good to hear that. His being out of tune with society at large so often did him ill, yet it had rarely cut as sharply as this.
“It’s going to take some time for all this to settle. You can’t expect me to process it and be completely fine from one day to the next. But I’m not going to run out. I can’t even run, anyway. So put that stupid idea out of your head. I already told you I’m not going to change my mind.”
“Sure. Help yourself.”
Mycroft narrowed his eyes, sitting up straighter in his chair.
This case really was a 3. So elementary.
“Are you sure? You used to mind immensely. I don’t want to upset you further.”
Irritation flashed in Mycroft’s eyes.
One of these boyfriends took him away to Canada. He had been the one to get transferred to the Vancouver office, not Victor. But they didn’t want to separate. Would have even gotten married if it had been possible. They were now. Victor had sent him the wedding invitation, which Sherlock had been forced to decline due to a pressing case he could not abandon.
“What do you want, Sherlock?”
“Sure, if nothing comes up. Why? What’s up?”
Lestrade scoffed.
Mycroft replied with the same excuse about not considering the impossible that Mrs. Hudson had mentioned. Sherlock refused to leave him off the hook. Greg, for his part, was astonished and embarrassed that he hadn’t caught on that Mrs. Hudson had noticed. Normally, Sherlock wouldn’t derive any comfort from being equally as bewildered as Greg, but it did provide some relief this time. Everyone was in bad form today, including John. But Sherlock was over it. He was too busy being fascinated by Mrs. Hudson’s tales of riding kelpies, befriending a wood sprite, and having escapades with no less than a werewolf and a selkie.
John renewed the pressure. Sherlock laid his head back, eyes sliding shut, letting the sensations wash over him in pleasant waves.
Sherlock texted.
“That is a seal skin,” he said with a terse note of finality, meeting Sherlock’s gaze head on. “It’s mine. But that’s not important right now. Your wound is. Are you dizzy? Any blurred vision?”
The sweetest blush heated Greg’s cheeks even as he grinned in delight.
“I know, but I couldn’t help it. You were taking too long.”
“Then use your bloody key.”
Greg responded with a soft “woof” and poked Sherlock’s cheek with his snout, giving him a soft lick. Sherlock giggled and sank his hands into Greg’s abundant and surprisingly soft fur, petting his muzzle. John came up beside them and scratched behind Greg’s ears.
But it didn’t last. Soon, John was sad again and Sherlock didn’t know what to do about it. One evening, while they were strolling beside the Thames by Tower Bridge, John stopped by the railing and leaned on it to gaze across the water. His face had that same pensive expression of sorrow that had been driving Sherlock mad for days. He stood next to John, biting his bottom lip. This ended now.
“We’ve become partners. We’re not really labeling it, but John is okay calling it a QPR, if need be. He has romantic feelings for me, and the other ones, too, but we talked it all through.”
“Well played.”
“I needed to think. Eating slows me down.”
The faintest smile of amusement raised the right corner of Mycroft’s lips.
“You didn’t ask me if I minded,” he said.
Great. A creature of legend, who had been said to enchant men for centuries, found Sherlock’s music beautiful. Sherlock should be flattered. He was flattered. The praise of strangers never mattered to him, but John had saved him from a humiliating death, so “stranger” felt like the wrong term to use with him. Acquaintance fell far short, too. Never mind that Sherlock was supposed to forget about him altogether. He could fabricate a false memory in his place. That was possible. He’d never accomplished it, but he’d heard of it. Then he wouldn’t mentally flinch every time that his wounds hurt or he had to change a bandage or Mr. Hudson cooed over him getting hurt.
“So, my quiet acceptance of your admonishment has earned me a reprieve, then?”
Mrs. Hudson shook her head.
Sherlock texted Mycroft at 7pm Monday night.
“What is it, darling?”
“Not at all.” A warm feeling had joined the awkwardness in Mycroft’s chest. Interesting. “I am pleased to consider you as such. I am very grateful for how much you care for Sherlock, and I apologize for my earlier doubts about you two moving ahead too quickly.”
“That’s hardly dinner table conversation,” Mycroft said, looking down at his plate while a blush threatened to redden his cheeks.
“It’s high time for me to bandage your ankle,” John said, putting his mug on the table.
“I am grateful for the medical attention, but I wish you’d tell me the truth instead of insisting that my hallucination was real.”
“But my chances of being a father aren’t great. We covered that. Not unless I started now, alone, but I can’t. Not with my job. I just can’t. So why keep beating that dead horse, huh? Let’s just get rid of it. I officially declare that no longer an obstacle between us. If we decided to renew things, that is. Which I can’t… Fuck, I can’t do right now.”
The seal let him go. Sherlock shrank back, crawling across the floor, wide eyes on the seal, which was rippling again, its skin peeling away just like it had on the beach to reveal a human form once more. No trick. It was no trick. Not even Houdini could have pulled this one off. But how? How?!
“I’m sorry.”
All the air had been sucked out of Mycroft’s lungs.
“Rather well. She asked what the terms meant. I explained. She hugged me. Then she went online and bought me aro and ace flags.”
“Can you come by my flat tonight?” Sherlock asked.
“Wasn’t that exit a little abrupt?” John whispered once they were out in the landing.
“There’s no shift in intelligence from one form to another,” John said. “It’s more like our priorities change. Certain needs and desires that are more important in one shape become muted in the other. I don’t think much about art and hiking when I’m in seal form. And when I’m in human form, I’m not constantly thinking about hunting for fish, although I still eat a lot of it.
“We don’t have sex. I don’t want to. He respects that.” And Sherlock had no reason to believe that he wouldn’t continue respecting that. “We show affection in other ways. Hold hands. Cuddle. It works. It’s only been two weeks since we got together like this and three weeks since we even met, but it is working.”
“Haven’t I done so before?” he asked, only half paying attention to Lestrade.
“Not dating,” John added quickly, eyes wide. “Um, seeing? Being in a relationship with?”
“For fuck’s sake.” The man sank back, frustration oozing from every pore. “You are absolutely impossible. Why can’t you just trust the evidence of your own eyes?”
Greg looked at him beseechingly.
Sherlock obliged his request for attention, yet he didn’t delight in Mycroft’s affront this time. Had Sherlock himself not been any less cynical? They were about to implode Mycroft’s world view around his ears. Sherlock should probably apologize. He almost did.
John chuckled.
“I’m not. I’ve thought about this, long and hard. Let’s face it. Having kids might not be in the cards for me. Not everyone who wants them gets to have them. Maybe I’m one of those.”
“You have Mrs. Hudson, though.”
“I really hate to break this up but I’m pretty hungry.”
Mycroft pursed his lips.
Buoyed by the cadence of John’s breath, Sherlock let his mind drift in the hope of sleep. When he next opened his eyes, a dream of chasing a murderer through an aquarium faded from his memory. Huh. He had managed to sleep more, after all. John snored away. Smiling, Sherlock grabbed his mobile from the side table and checked his messages. Mrs. Hudson had sent him a picture of a puppy done up as a pop culture character Sherlock couldn’t be bothered to know about. Why people enjoyed dressing up their pets was beyond him, but the beagle did look adorable in his blue cape, so Sherlock replied with a smiling emoji.
“My lips are sealed.”
“You are. It may not be an objective opinion, but who cares about that?
“Yes. But why can’t he do it now?”
“See?” Sherlock told Mycroft. “Nothing to be scared of.”
Sherlock huffed.
John scooched back and grabbed Sherlock’s leg by the shin, gently placing it in his lap. It ached at the motion, but not as much as when John removed his shoe and sock. Sherlock bit down on a wince. It was certainly a sprain. His entire foot was swelling up, his ankle blooming red.
“We didn’t say much at first. Then he asked what kind of wine Mrs. Hudson likes. I told him that if he didn’t bring the most expensive rosé, I’d kick him out. Then he started going on about wines, knowing full well that I don’t know a damn thing about it. He shut up after I glared at him for long enough. To make him suffer, I started talking about the Marvel movies. His look of horror that I even know anything about them made up for trying to show me up earlier.”
“We strayed off topic, didn’t we?” he said, weary. “On purpose.”
“You do that. I’ll let you go then. Take care of yourself.”
“There’s nothing at all the matter with me except for Mycroft and Greg being impossible and the wretched criminals in this city being boring and not doing anything remotely interesting for ages and my brain rotting out of lack of stimulation and John’s train being late. It’s late. Trains aren’t supposed to be late. Don’t they have some precious timetable to adhere to? And while he thinks it’s sweet that I want to pick him up at the station, he wants to come here on his own this time. To normalize our comings and goings, he says. Sure. Fine. I can see his point. But that leaves me waiting here for an extra John-less half hour, except now it’s a John-less hour and twenty minutes because the bloody train is late.”
“I don’t know anything,” John protested, looking at Greg with chagrin. “Besides, it’s none of our business.”
Mycroft tried to disguise the shock in his voice, and did a horrible job of it, as usual.
“I’m not the only one,” Greg said, glancing at John, who coughed guiltily into his hand.
“Good point,” Sherlock said. “It was immensely stupid to trust a stranger like that. Think better of it next time.”
“I told him that I know about Victor. He just sounded concerned.”
“Wrong.”
“Maybe.  But what if the person I’m with doesn’t want to? How viable is it really? Look, I appreciate you trying to find solutions, but I don’t want false hope. Or to give you any.” Greg squeezed his eyes shut in distress. “Shit, I’m talking about what I want with you without taking your feedings into account. I’m s—”
Mycroft frowned.
“I have noticed that, yes. So you don’t have other friends?”
“I have the same issue with my sister,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Cats and dogs we are. But at least you are sharing a table. That’s what counts.”
Oh. This was the sort of thing a friend would show sympathy over. Not that this was anything new. Greg and his wife had been separated for ages, so he didn’t require fresh condolences. Mrs. Hudson would probably tell him to say something, though.
Mycroft had wisely ignored John’s exhortations to leave him to find his own employment. Sherlock hadn’t even needed to request him to do so. As soon as Sherlock told him that John was moving in, Mycroft had volunteered to look into acceptable positions so that John didn’t have to waste his time with the drudgery of it. John had resisted, even though there was absolutely no point. It must have to do with pride or something. But he had caved in the end when an email filled with available positions arrived in his inbox on Sunday afternoon. John had rolled his eyes but gave the go-ahead for Mycroft to forward his CV. It was either that, or do it himself without the impetus of a minister official backing him, while missing out on valuable cuddling time on the sofa, so it was a simple decision, really. By noon on Monday, he had five interviews lined up on Friday, which he was taking off to come in that morning.
“You’re a GP. That’s the minimum amount of time it would have taken you to get your license and live here. Some of your furniture was new when you bought it. There’s some light wear to it. You’re organized, but not pristine. You take care of your things, but not to an excessive level. That indicates to me one or two years, with two being most likely. You picked a post next to the ocean and an isolated house, which you would need. No one’s suspicion would be aroused by the isolation since you’re a lonely man who doesn’t socialize. You never have visitors here. The sofa is only worn on one particular spot. Yours. There’s only one coaster on the side table. One tea cup. One chair. You live among humans, you take care of them, but you don’t intermingle with them outside of work. Why is that? Afraid that if you got too close to someone they’d figure out your secret? But you showed me. You insisted that I know. Why am I the exception?”
“I don’t mind.” John crouched down beside the bag and reached in to flip through the books. “Well, I would like a break now and then, but I don’t want you to not ask questions. Most of the information in these should be accurate as far as most marine animals are concerned, but I don’t want you to get things wrong if I can help it.”
“Thank you.”
As much as the idea terrified Mycroft.
“Pleasure to meet you, Sherlock. I’m John Watson. Are you going to tell them what happened?” John asked.
John rushed forward and took Sherlock’s hands in his, squeezing gently, looking intensely into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Yeah. They are boring, aren’t they?”
“The feeling is mutual.”
Mycroft’s face pinched at the ridiculousness of having to consider a fairy’s feelings.
“No need. I’m at the office, but I’ll give you the security codes so you can get in. Please make yourself at home. Take anything you want from the fridge.”
Mycroft glanced over his shoulder. Greg regarded with a soft, grateful expression. Mycroft’s breath stilled in his throat. The sudden urge to kiss Greg and hold him until he laughed in joy seized him like a noose around his throat.
“Was Sherlock’s reaction worse?” Mycroft asked.
John plucked at his shirt for emphasis.
“We are friends and I really appreciate that. But we’ve only known each other a week. You don’t have to promise me anything.”
“Nothing,” Sherlock said.
An intrigued grin appeared on John’s face.
“Shortness and tallness are relative terms.”
But getting involved with someone connected to Sherlock would be complicated, to say the least. Best not.
Did he, though?
“Safe? Because it’s me or just the pressure?”
Sherlock scratched at his right palm with his left thumbnail, glancing out the window at the grey sky.
“They’ll be here in fifteen minutes,” Sherlock informed John.
He ducked out the door, rushing up the stairs. Sherlock’s grin widened. Oh, this was perfect. So perfect. He met Greg’s eyes, as dark brown as they had ever been. He’d like to think that he would be able to recognize them even if he hadn’t known this was Greg, but he couldn’t be sure. Although, the distribution of brown and white strands on his coat matched his human form’s coloring perfectly. And there was no mistaking Greg’s friendly, ingratiating gaze, which remained unchanged from a few minutes ago, still begging for forgiveness for his transgression.
“No bother,” Sherlock said, reaching behind him to grab John’s right arm and wrap it around his torso like a blanket. “I was barely sleeping, anyway.”
“A negotiation, then?” he said, looking between the two of them. “What do you propose I give you in exchange for telling me the truth?”
John followed without protest. Sherlock only let go of his hand when they reached his bedroom to yank off his dressing gown and t-shirt before jumping into bed and staring up at John, who was being much too slow with his own garments.
“Yes.”
“I’m allowed to change my mind. Just do it.”
“All the siblings I know tease each other. Me and Harry were always at each others’ throats. We drove our parents round the bend.” John tensed under Sherlock. “But maybe we’re not the best example.”
“Let’s get back on track, shall we?” Sherlock said, kissing John’s knuckles before letting go and clapping his hands together. He regretted it immediately. That was too much. Too forced. But he didn’t know what else to do. “You two have met. That’s great. Forget Mycroft. I don’t see the need to bring him up again for the rest of the day. So…”
“How did you know that?” John asked, retracting his hand.
Mycroft had smiled at that. He hesitated over his reply, certain that he should not be suggesting this, but it wasn’t like he would be developing a romantic entanglement with Greg, anyway. That wasn’t in his nature. He should make that clear.
“Biscuits, too, please.”
“Sorry,” John said, ceasing to touch him full stop, the suddenness of his retreat leaving Sherlock cold. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“I can’t believe this,” he said, turning away, jaw clenched, breath tight. “You’re the smartest person I’ve ever met. How can you be so monumentally stupid?”
“No, I know that that… sex… isn’t what you mean by it. I’m not adverse to you using that phrasing to mean what we do. It actually sounds kind of fun, now that I think about it. Like a fuck you to the system. No offence.”
“I’ve never been gone for this long before,” Sherlock continued. “As I was talking to Mrs. Hudson, I realized that I may have left her alone for a little too long.”
Mycroft sighed.
Mycroft explained what had happened that day from when he’d first had John brought to him to when John changed into a sea creature before his disbelieving eyes.
John closed his mouth, looking awkward.
“You did not.”
While no baby pictures were present, Mrs. Hudson did regale John with a large amount of anecdotes about her time knowing Sherlock, including the time when he came home covered in pig’s blood with the harpoon that he had been spearing the dead swine with to prove that it couldn’t be the murder weapon. Not the most flattering story, but John looked at him with more amusement than horror. If he were the type to be turned off by that sort of thing, he wouldn’t be here, after all. John, for his part, told his own edited version of Sherlock’s stay at his house. No mention of turning into a seal and playing in the ocean, of course. There was no reason to shatter Mrs. Hudson’s magic-free view of the universe.
John’s face filled with panic.
Mycroft’s jaw clenched. He gripped his umbrella.
“We’re not skipping it. I’ve been looking forward to it. I haven’t seen a symphony in ages.”
“I’m not afraid of that. It’s just a bit awkward. When Sherlock asked why I was nervous about you knowing, I kinda…” Greg’s hands shifted at his sides. “Sometimes reactions just happen, you know, when thoughts just come into your head. You know how that is. And the body reacts. Humans can’t tell. I hate to burst your bubble, but I am just as observant as you are. My senses are a lot more acute than yours. Selkies’, too. So I was thinking of you and I thought of… years ago and… I wasn’t keeping track of what my body was doing, but it reacted. The way that bodies react when they’re thinking of…”
They smiled at each other, a comfortable silence falling around them.
“Not always. You promised you wouldn’t ask for any changes that interfered with my research.”
“Well, I can’t say I don’t appreciate the visual.”
Sherlock turned on his heel, yet he couldn’t look John in the eyes, not with him looking so remorseful and imploring while discomfort crawled in Sherlock’s treacherous skin.
“I see your point.”
“Yeah, sure.”
Guilt twisted in Sherlock’s gut at the remembrance. However much Mycroft had violated his privacy since, Sherlock had fucked up that day.
“Well, a hello is nice. The one you gave me when I got here today was very nice. I’m not going to complain about a missing hello here and there.”
Mycroft pressed his hand flat against the armrest.
Greg nodded, tapping Mycroft’s foot with his paw.
Alarm appeared on John’s face.
“How exactly did Mycroft get involved in this?” Greg asked.
“You just want me to feed your ego.”
“It’s so good to see you again,” Mrs. Hudson said as she emerged, all smiles at John, who smiled back. “Poor Sherlock has been so eager for you to get here.”
“I think you’re the most magnificent being I have ever seen.”
The weekend passed much too quickly. Sherlock returned to London on Monday morning in the midst of commuter traffic, but no way was he wasting an extra night by coming back early. Mrs. Hudson received him with crumpets from his favorite bakery and tickets to another concert on Tuesday. Leaving John still stung. The flat felt much too empty. Mrs. Hudson might be there, but she wasn’t John.
“Here,” he said, handing John the phone. “Pick whatever you like. It’s on the house. I’ll text the owner our order so they’ll have it ready as soon as possible.”
“Hey, someone needs to check your ego every once in a while, else one day, your head is going to swell up like a balloon and you’re going to float out of this room.”
“Oh, there’s no rush. You two have a lot of catching up to do.”
“You know why.”
Sherlock instinctively clutched it tighter, but shook off Mycroft’s attempt to turn this on him. He wasn’t the one being investigated here.
“I don’t know yet. And it’s not a mess. It’s essential equipment.”
“No, I would not.”
Sherlock signed, swallowing a frustrated scream.
John’s lips pursed, but he nodded.
Indulging another of the forms of touch that he had become so curious about in the last few days, Sherlock hugged John from behind, wrapping his arms firmly around his torso and sinking his face into John’s hair, inhaling his distinctive scent.
Sherlock shifted his healthy foot on the floor.
“You’re going to come out to him.”
“Plenty of time for me to jump in the cab. But I didn’t.”
Shit, he was babbling.
That was it.
“I just showered. Are you able to smell my sweat despite that?”
“Well, yeah.”
“I knew he was baiting me. Why is everyone acting like I’ve lost my capacity for reason? I wasn’t some hapless hare willfully hopping off into slaughter. I can see it in your faces that you think I was being stupid. You don’t understand. I need to know. I can’t just go through life with half- answered questions. I need clearcut, complete knowledge. And I’ll never get it now. The man won’t talk. He meant it. He won’t give me any more information. But I’m safe. That’s the important thing, right? The thing in Dover was a blip. Bad luck. You know my record.”
“Please tell me,” Sherlock said as soon as John popped up behind a bookcase, “that there’s no such thing as magical islands. There’s only so much irrationality I can handle.”
“Has John shown any sign of being unhappy with the situation?”
“Very much so.”
“I think I should try it in this one,” he said. “I don’t want to accidentally crush you in the middle of the night as a seal if I roll over.”
“So unnecessary. It’s torture having to wait this long.”
“You can choose to trust me, but you won’t, so fine. You win. But I won’t tell you anything until he allows me to.”
“The one you keep getting angry at me for having and keep stealing from my pocket?”
“I should probably call him now and get it over with,” Sherlock said. “I’ll let you know when I’m heading back.”
Sherlock’s stomach had begun protesting painfully since John had first broached the subject.
“May I?” John asked even as he started unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt.
“I haven’t had you as a chauffeur in ages,” Sherlock mused to Mycroft as they drove off. “You’re not still climbing on the pavement, are you? Getting jostled is quite unpleasant.”
John’s voice rose sharply as his patience neared its breaking point. Why was it so important for him to uphold this fantasy?
Mycroft’s phone announced that Greg had driven through the front gate. Quickly donning a pair of slacks and a pale blue dress shirt, Mycroft hurried downstairs and met Greg at the door. Greg entered with a warm smile, even if it was tarnished by weariness and preoccupation.
“It is weird,” John said, rubbing Sherlock’s sagging shoulder. “No lab experimentation, remember?”
“Tea, please. Thanks.”
“I didn’t want to move. I figured my stomach could wait, but it’s a little much now. I can just grab a sandwich from the café downstairs if you’re not hungry.”
Mycroft grinned despite himself. John was quite amusing sometimes.
“You were bleeding,” John said, stumbling over the words, looking to the side instead of at Sherlock. “You had a head wound. You needed immediate attention. I couldn’t take care of you in my seal form. Speaking of, you really shouldn’t be sitting on the floor. Let me help you up.”
The queasy look on John’s face screamed exactly the opposite.
Mrs. Hudson took the bottle with a knowing grin.
“Yes. It’s a cross I have to bear.”
Greg glanced knowingly at John.
They didn’t have sex that night, but a very satisfying snogging session was in order. It thoroughly sabotaged Mycroft’s determination that this should be a one time thing. Greg asked him out on another date. Due to their hectic schedules, they weren’t able to get together again for two weeks, but the passage of time only strengthened Mycroft’s attraction towards Greg, who didn’t cease to text him throughout. Even something as simple as Greg inquiring after his wellbeing touched him more deeply than he’d ever thought possible. His parents were the only ones who ever asked about his health. It was rare for Sherlock to do so these days, and mostly when he needed something. The phrase “How are you?” was such a staple of small talk that it often had no meaning at all. Yet Greg meant it. He genuinely cared. They had shared one day together, one snog. Not much at all. Yet it hardly felt like little.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have.”
“Not all of them, but some. Romantic partners, too, for full disclosure, but I’m not thinking of this like that.”
The doorbell rang. Sherlock jerked, ignoring the podcast to listen for Mrs. Hudson opening the front door and letting Greg in. They exchanged a short greeting, the usual small talk, then Greg began coming upstairs. Sherlock turned off the podcast, but he remained lying down. He didn’t want Greg to know how expectantly he’d been waiting for him or make it seem like he was nervous, which he was not. Mycroft was wrong. As was Mrs. Hudson, when he told her. And John, who he’d exchanged a sadly short text conversation with earlier. He felt eager anticipation, not nerves. Greg knocked before stepping inside. Sherlock had left the door open a crack to indicate that he could come straight in.
Sherlock stretched out his arms.
“Likewise.”
“That’s alright, Mrs. Hudson,” John said, all charm and smiles as he stood up. “It’s been wonderful having the time to know you better. And Sherlock through your stories. I’d love to have another chat before I leave tomorrow.”
“I can tell that your concern is genuine. It is appreciated.”
“I didn’t want to crowd you, either. So.” Sherlock rubbed his hands together, feet bouncing. “Bed, then? Either form is fine.”
“Visiting his house was weird and awkward. Mycroft has always been simple. Now he’s difficult and complicated. I don’t know what the rules are with him anymore. Am I not allowed to insult him now? That’s too much to ask. I can’t do it.”
Greg turned back toward him, surprised.
“Oh, forget all that,” Mrs. Hudson said, waving her hand. “I’m sure John doesn’t truly mind in the end.”
“What conversation topics were these?” Mycroft asked.
“You could have gone off and transformed where I couldn’t see you. You didn’t have to do it right in front of me. And you certainly didn’t have to show me again after I’d already convinced myself that it was merely a hallucination. I could have gone on being blissfully unaware that impossible creatures exist, without my entire worldview being utterly wrecked. Why was it so damn important for you to flip my world upside down? Why?”
“Never mind John. Why did you hide the fact that you have been sleeping with Greg?”
The creature that had executed such murderous violence yesterday peered at him with such concern, his hold soft and cautious on Sherlock’s ankle, his motions deliberate as he peeled back the bandage, careful to cause as little distress upon the injured tissue as possible. Sherlock’s ankle was a big, purple bruise in John’s hands, which stroked lightly atop his foot, checking that he hadn’t missed anything in his examination yesterday. Did selkies have doctors? Or was this discipline another human activity that John had wished to submerge himself in?
“Alright, a lot,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock hesitated for a second, though he wasn’t sure why.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” John said hastily, seeking to rectify his error. “It really is interesting. And thorough. Studying two-hundred-and-forty-three varieties of tobacco ash is very detailed work. It’s impressive.”
John’s left hand was shaking. His eyes shone, blinking too rapidly not to be holding back tears, his lips pressed in a firm, weary line as he hunched forward. He hadn’t glanced at Sherlock once as he spoke, as if he couldn’t face him through the depths of his shame. Sherlock gaped uselessly at him. He never knew what to do in these situations. Should he remain silent like when John had been shaken by the sharks in the documentary? Or should he touch his shoulder in comfort like in the car? He should do something. Standing here mute felt wrong. Cruel. He would have comforted Victor in this situation, and John had just said that he liked touching his friends.
“You are right,” Mycroft corrected himself. “I haven’t granted Greg the freedom to choose what he wants. I’ll endeavor to do better in the future. For both of you.”
“I snuck out, went to my dealer, and came back. There was no way to ensure that Mycroft’s security system wouldn’t catch my coming and going, but there was no helping it. I made it look like I’d gone out for a pack of cigarettes, which he only allowed me the first day before cutting me off for health reasons. As if he doesn’t smoke himself when his emotions are compromised, the hypocrite. I lit up the first cigarette in full view of his front security camera, blowing a plume of smoke straight at it to mock him. There was a fifty-fifty chance that he would know that it was a ruse, but he would already have people checking my flat and I couldn’t stomach shooting up at some den. I’d told myself that I’d left that part behind me, at least. So I did it in Mycroft’s guest room. I just wanted to feel peace, just for a little bit. Nothing else.”
“Of course you’re not.”
Sherlock released him so that Greg could go to John. Despite having been introduced before, another introduction was required, it seemed, for they stopped before each other and sniffed. Greg bent his head, thrusting his snout eagerly at John, who rubbed his cheek against his and hopped eagerly. Greg wagged his tail in joy. Both made happy sounds in their own respective languages. Sherlock’s heart warmed at the sight, and not only because it was one of the cutest things that he had ever seen. He hadn’t had a chance to enjoy them meeting each other before with all the Mycroft business, but now he felt a gooey, ecstatic feeling. It was startling. He never felt like this. Never had reason to. Is this what it was like having a partner? A friend? A partner and a friend? If only Mrs. Hudson were here, too, the picture would be complete, but it would be selfish to wreck her rational worldview, too.
“No, you can stay. I’m not that tired. Please, continue.”
“Best get a move on, then.”
“I meant that.”
Sherlock smirked.
Or he might figure out the obvious himself. Sherlock ceased his study of John’s hand and rested it back against his chest.
“I think I do. Even if you know it, I think part of you might need to hear it. You looked scared. The way you jumped back.”
Sherlock nodded. He slipped into the bed first, pushing back the covers and sliding his legs in, his toes suddenly cold, a nervous reaction, perhaps. But he didn’t regret this decision despite the nerves fluttering in his belly. He wanted John to scooch in beside him like he was doing now, to reach out and encircle him in his arms like he had downstairs, to sink into his warmth and breathe him in. It would be a cliché to say that John smelled like the sea, but it was true. Sweat removed salt from the body, so the scent of it in John’s might be no more than that, yet Sherlock couldn’t escape the fanciful notion that John smelled like the breeze coming in from the ocean, bright and crisp and beguiling. They faced each other at first, gazes meeting tentatively as knees stroked knees and arms wrapped around torsos. John moved forward so that their chests met, pushing against each other as they breathed. Sherlock’s right hand brushed John’s on the bed between them, so close to the handholding that he desired to try, yet he still shied from taking the extra plunge.
“I’ve decided to show you, anyway,” John said once Mycroft had returned, every bit as curious as before. He frowned in puzzlement at John’s announcement.
Guilt shuddered in Greg’s eyes.
Speaking of fussing, Sherlock’s ridiculous worrying was interrupted by Mrs. Hudson calling. She had been in contact every day since Sherlock had informed her that he was injured and would tarry getting back to London, as if her constant hovering might prompt him into returning sooner. Lestrade snitching that he had almost been murdered only made her nagging worse. Sometimes she called, which he ignored, then she texted, asking how he was doing, if he wasn’t working his ankle too hard, drinking enough water, all the usual Mrs. Hudson stuff that he complained about to her face but secretly appreciated, not that he would ever admit that to her. If he did, it would only get worse and he’d never get her out of his flat.
“It must have been something really bad for this kind of overreaction. You don’t have to tell me what it is,” John added quickly.
“Alright,” he said begrudgingly. “My unofficial post is a bit more involved, but I’m afraid that I can’t give out any details as to what that is.”
Sherlock perked up.
“Well, then. Would you kindly continue educating me on all the beings I’m woefully ignorant of?”
“Well, I’m not telepathic. Take your cup.”
“I won’t. I promise.”
He was still grinning when John returned, fully dressed in jeans and a faded Star Wars t-shirt.
“Please sit down,” Mycroft said. “You shouldn’t be standing for so long with that sprained ankle. Which you didn’t even deign to inform me of.”
Greg narrowed his eyes at him and said something irrelevant. Everyone was saying irrelevant things. It was making him dizzy and his thoughts choke. He was so close to figuring out who the killer was. So damn close, but no one would let him think. Even Mrs. Hudson was whining about some cab that Sherlock hadn’t even called for.
“Did you OD?” he asked.
, John texted.
Understanding softened John’s face.
“I told him to cut it out.”
“That’s rather restrained coming from someone who, as Sherlock loves to put it, I kidnapped.”
“I’m sure that John would love to play his first mate,” Greg said.
“I had ignored how insistent her asking about when I was returning was. Stupid of me. She has been quieter about it since I told her that I’d be staying with you, but I need to go back soon.”
Until that satisfaction turned sour, that is, for only a year and a half passed before the promise of future joy was under threat. Children, the reason above all others why Greg had been compelled to look elsewhere for companionship, might not be in the picture. Greg tried to stay hopeful as he confessed that they were seeing fertility doctors, yet his dread that it might not work loomed large in his anxious eyes. Mycroft acutely felt his pain. While he was not a fan of children, the thought of small versions of his kind and noble detective wasn’t disagreeable. And if Greg couldn’t have children, what had been the point of all this? But Mycroft mustn’t be so selfish. There might have been other reasons why Greg preferred not to keep him as a primary companion. Susan was certainty more suited to him in more respects than just this. As to his own feelings, Mycroft concluded that they weren’t so romantic, after all, and that he had only been confused because his particular dynamic with Greg had been so new to him. That was all. He hoped, both in word and thought, that the difficulties that Greg and Susan faced weren’t insurmountable.
Mycroft narrowed his eyes.
“Tell him what you told me,” he said. “That I shouldn’t hide who I am.”
Sherlock shut his eyes and dropped his head against the backrest.
“Can I trust him with this?” he asked, meeting Sherlock’s eyes again. “He’s not going to drag me away to some government facility and experiment on me, is he?”
“Last night.” Sherlock tapped restlessly on his leg. “He had admitted to being attracted to me when we first met, for lack of a better word, but I made it clear that I wasn’t interested.”
“You never know. I might need it to infiltrate a fancy dress party.”
“Mm. A bit.”
“You mean, that no one’s disrespecting him and that he isn’t getting himself into danger?”
Mycroft sighed.
Sherlock’s jaw clenched so hard that it hurt.
Mycroft huffed, fingers flexing on his umbrella in irritation.
“They were required to give the proper impression. I could just say that they’re dark blue and that you have central heterochromia, but that description would fall far short.”
hand. Why was Sherlock being so stupid? John had already carried and bandaged him. Sherlock should be used to his touch by now, to the terrifying yet exhilarating reality of it. Once Sherlock had his left foot and crutches securely under him, John stood back to let him hobble outside on his own, yet kept a watchful eye on him, examining him with a medical eye.
An enticing grin grew on John’s face.
Mrs. Hudson waved a hand, looking only slightly sorry.
“I know what I said,” Mrs. Hudson said, going straight for the kettle on the counter. “But I really don’t know what to do with that boy sometimes. I really don’t.”
“I’m not.” Greg stepped closer to him, begging with his gaze. “I swear, I’m not. I mean it. Today, with you, cuddling on the sofa, you accepting who I am, all of me… I haven’t felt so at peace since… Shit, I can’t remember since when. You make me feel good. Through this whole thing with Susan, everyone else has been smothering me with platitudes. They mean well, but it’s exhausting. You don’t do that. You just ask me what I need and then give it to me. You have no idea how much you help me. You’ve always helped me. You never pushed me away. I love you for that. I… I love you.”
“Really? You’ll drop this? This isn’t a trick? If it is, Mycroft, I swear--”
“He’s not going to judge you. Not if I have anything to say about it.”
“Excuse me?”
“Of course Sherlock would have,” Greg said. “You wanted to get some alone time with him, didn’t you? Play some mind games?”
They grabbed a cab to Angelo’s, where they were seated by the window with an unnecessary, small candle for ambiance. Angelo kept referring to John as his date, but Sherlock was having too good a day to be bothered by incorrect nomenclature. They had a lovely meal, followed by an equally lovely walk down Soho and into St James’s Park. They didn’t return to the flat until after five thirty so that John could change into nicer clothes for the symphony. Sherlock, of course, was already properly dressed in a suit.
John looked at him now, properly, eyes wide with confusion, then saddened by understanding. He sighed, a leaden breath, and grabbed Sherlock’s hand again, interlacing their fingers.
“Yeah, right. Fine. Just for five minutes, okay? That’s it.”
“I’m not afraid of Mycroft.”
“What for? There’s plenty of space in this one. I don’t need another fridge taking up space.”
Mycroft smiled. Poor John was tying himself into knots with all that rambling. Yet what he said was oddly touching. Mycroft had certainly not received any similar declaration from Victor, although they hadn’t interacted anywhere near as much, or as intimately, even after years of Victor being in Sherlock’s life. Mycroft had referred to John as his brother-in-law earlier, but that had been to tease Sherlock, not as any sort of serious declaration. However, family relationships were very close in John’s culture. He might have considered Mycroft to be just that since he got together with Sherlock. For the second time in as many days, Mycroft found himself oddly at a loss as to what to say.
“A pompous arse with no respect for other people’s privacy?”
It was Mycroft’s turn to be embarrassed.
Sherlock pointed at the dark pile that had been a seal a moment ago. John’s brows rose, scrunching in a frown of surprise and indecision.
Greg smiled, gentle, so eager to please and silently asking forgiveness.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“Oh.” John looked down at the table, voice soft and crestfallen. “So you have to go back to London, then?”
Sherlock put the slipper down, scowling daggers at his intrusive brother. Why did he have to be so damn superior all the time?
“He did.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him, but let it go.
“I’m afraid that John has to head off to work now,” he said. “So this lovely discussion will have to be cut short.”
“I guess that’s true,” Greg said, tugging on his coat with a lopsided, fond smile that put all sorts of unpleasant mental pictures in Sherlock’s mind. He most certainly did not want to know what his brother and Greg got up to.
Sherlock’s smile fluttered.
“Yes. Is that truly so difficult to fathom?”
Oh. There had been one time when Mycroft had confessed to him that his attachment to one of his former bedmates may have strayed into the romantic sphere. The timing worked. That man had been Greg. Of course. How could Sherlock not have seen that?
“You’re not, I assure you. Very well. Consider me if you must, but do not prioritize me over yourself. And take all the time that you need.”
“Yes, of course. That’s why I’m here.”
“I am not fretting,” Mycroft said some seconds later. “You would have begun speaking immediately were that the case.”
Mycroft scrutinized Greg’s face, but found nothing to worry about. He smiled.
“I think Sherlock wants to go upstairs,” Mrs. Hudson said.
“I know,” Greg said with an apologetic grimace as he hung up his coat. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have just told him like that. But, in my defense, it was actually John’s fault. Sort of. Okay, it was still my fault, but Sherlock picked it up from his reaction.”
Mrs. Hudson shook her head at him, smiling in amusement.
None of them were holding back now. John was free to transform whenever he wanted without worry, and he did to Mrs. Hudson’s delight. John thoroughly acquainted himself with Mrs. Hudson’s flat in seal form, cheerfully hopping about and snuggling up to the two of them on the sofa while Sherlock filled her in about the aspects of his month-long stay in Dover that he couldn’t get into before. Sherlock and John had planned on going to the National Gallery, but they stayed in all day enjoying their newfound freedom, postponing it for the next day. They did go on Sunday morning, but cut it short because Greg came over to the flat. Now that Sherlock was over (almost over) not being able to see the obvious, he could enjoy Greg’s lingering amazement that he hadn’t been able to keep his closely guarded secret from Mrs. Hudson for more than two months. Really quite embarrassing when you thought about it. A repeat of two weekends before ensued with the addition of Mrs. Hudson. John and Greg shifted into their animal forms and snuggled together, as well as with everyone else. Sherlock curled up with John on the floor for a while, since John’s seal form was too bulky for the two of them to be on the sofa. Sherlock wrapped himself around him, John’s snout resting on his collarbone, and closed his eyes, listening to Mrs. Hudson coo over Greg’s cuter form as she pet him on the sofa. Contentment washed over Sherlock, a smile growing on his face.
Sherlock’s hands slowed on Greg’s head. Greg had shown him trust and friendship by showing all of himself to Sherlock. Sherlock should do something in return to make it clear that he accepted it and forgave him, which he already had. Of course he had. Mycroft was the one who was most at fault here. What did Greg’s one deception count against Mycroft’s dozens?
There was only one potential solution. Sherlock despised himself for even considering it. Mycroft would never accept it, not without proof, but it was not in Sherlock’s right to give him that proof.
Sherlock smiled all the way to the sofa.
“It’s not like you to be so selfless.”
“If it’s not going to be accurate, what’s the point?”
“You’re not interrupting,” Sherlock said, holding a hand out. “Come on.”
There was nothing bloody dramatic about it, but Sherlock let the matter go as John deposited him on the seat. It had sped up things considerably, not that he would be admitting that out loud. He scooched back on the seat so he could stretch out his legs and keep his injured ankle elevated. Once he was settled, John fetched Sherlock’s discarded shoe and sock and got into the driver’s seat and turned on the car. As he drove off, Sherlock pulled his phone out of his pocket and called Gregson, informing him about what had become of his thief. He left out the part where he had hallucinated John emerging from a seal. He hardly needed to become a laughing stock simply because his jarred brain had decided to malfunction for a moment. Gregson wanted to know John’s address straightaway to look for him, but Sherlock held off on giving it to him, shushing John when he supplied it after Sherlock told Gregson that he didn’t know it. Gregson’s interference could wait until after Sherlock had gotten a chance to learn more about John.
“Sudden. I realized I need to get out for a bit. Take a break and do something with no relation to Susan or work or Sherlock assuring me that he’s not going to do something stupid at the next case.” Greg snorted. “Which he will, let’s be honest.”
“No.”
“Hello,” he said. “I didn’t know everyone would be here. Is there something going on that I don’t know about?”
“He discovered his wife’s infidelity only four months ago.”
Sherlock grabbed his crutch and pushed himself upright with John’s help.
“I’m very sorry,” Sherlock said.
“Congratulations, mate,” he said.
Sherlock stroked light fingers over his chest.
“Thank you.”
“I should have told you earlier.” John glanced at Sherlock in apology before looking back down. “I’m sorry for worrying you. I didn’t want to make a fuss. My birthdays haven’t been the same since I left.” His voice grew strangled for a second. “Since I left home. My family always made a big thing over someone’s birthday. If we were near a human settlement, we would go into town, find something fun to do. A park or a festival of some sort. They always made sure to be near Ireland for my birthday. The music festival in Galway I told you about? It was in on my birthday. It’s on now. Harry got to go to New Orleans for hers. I loved it. I knew I’d be giving that up, yet I still…”
“Speaking of the sea, I want to go on a swim today. You can’t get in the water yet, but do you want to join me on the beach? Unless it’s too cold for you, although it’s warmed up today. I’m going to be swimming for a while, so it might get boring for you, now that I think about it.”
Sherlock hung up the phone and turned back to Greg and John, both of whom had their arms crossed over their chests and looked as awkward and weird abut all this as Sherlock felt.
“I apologize for not warning you about him.”
Greg’s expression turned wry. He crossed his arms and shook his head slowly, as if it were amusing. What exactly was funny about what Sherlock had just said?
“That’s what I’m saying. I don’t want to get it wrong. Not if this is as important as I think it is.”
Sherlock opened his mouth but forgot how to speak. John shook his head.
“Thanks,” he said. “I trust you.” He took another deep breath. “Okay, let’s do this.”
“I’ll have a word with him if he does. Mycroft has been allowed to get away with that for far too long.”
“I’m not comfortable not knowing why Dr. Watson’s past is such a blank,” Mycroft said. “But I always do try to act for your good, Sherlock, as much as you push back against me. This time, however, I think I would be doing you harm by forcing your friend to reveal his secret.”
It took only a few moments in Google to find a John Watson, MD in Dover. He was a GP at a surgery not far from Sherlock’s hotel. If it weren’t for the aching inconvenience of his ankle, Sherlock would have gone to see him first thing the next morning, but he found himself forced to call his office instead. He had already informed the front desk of his hotel that he, and not the police department, would be paying for the rest of his stay, the length of which remained undetermined. It was easy to convince John’s receptionist that he was a friend who had lost all his contacts after having his phone stolen, so could John please ring him back when he got the chance?
What horrid torture to have to separate himself from John for even a moment after so much waiting, but they would be much better off continuing this elsewhere. Pulling back, he grabbed John’s hand and tugged him inside.
“I am being honest. I’m not saying I would have done the same thing, but I understand the urge. Besides, I think Sherlock covered the yelling part yesterday.”
“Okay. Just don’t look in my fridge. That’s easy enough.”
“No. You?”
“Nonsense,” Mrs. Hudson said. “You would have been right to be cautious in most cases.” She turned toward Sherlock with a soft, compassionate look bordering on pity. “You had a rough time accepting that the world isn’t the way you thought, didn’t you, dear?”
“Even when he moved it himself and simply forgot.”
Sherlock flopped unceremoniously onto the seat, his ankle aching as he pulled it inside, but he refused to let so much as a wince show on his face as he set the crutches beside him. No other minion sat in the car, thank God. Mycroft knew better than to subject him to the grating company of that personal assistant of his who didn’t realize that a world outside of her mobile even existed. He pulled out his own mobile and called John. Mycroft would let him take the call. There was no reason for him not to since Sherlock was on his way, anyway.
“Not on purpose,” Sherlock whined, gasping. “I wasn’t trying to do anything permanent. I just wanted a high. To forget. To feel good, and being sober felt bloody awful. It was only a little bit of an overdose. Stupid, yes, but not anywhere near as dramatic as Mycroft made it seem. It had been over a year since I’d taken drugs. I miscalculated. I wasn’t thinking straight. I didn’t mean to do it. But it was good that Mycroft didn’t buy my ruse. He found me passed out on the bed. I barely remember a second of it. Him shaking me, shouting my name, telling me to wake up. He looked scared.”
God, he really was a fucking idiot. He ripped off the clothes and put on pajamas instead. A dressing gown served just as well as a layer to hug around himself. Typical, household garb. Nothing suspicious about it at all.
The suddenness of John’s voice startled Sherlock.
It still felt like the most amazing, incredible thing. Too longed for and happy to be real.
His mobile rang, but instead of the soothing melody that Sherlock had composed for John, the dissonant chords of “God Save the Queen” rang out. Sherlock groaned. Must he really be obligated to speak to Mycroft twice in one day?
“Of course I know it. It’s Graham.”
“Boys, let’s focus up, please,” John said firmly.
Was that preoccupation in Mycroft’s tone?
“I don’t deserve you, Mrs. Hudson,” he said, voice struggling past the tears he didn’t want to let fall.
“I’m a doctor. I don’t just leave people bleeding on the sand.”
“I know what I said, but you like pub quizzes and I thought maybe we could do something different for a change.”
“Oh, yes, that he was.”
“We need to give him something.”
“Well, no, but would that make you uncomfortable? I don’t mind having clothes on.”
“No, you just seem like the kind of person who always thinks they’re the smartest person in the room.”
“I told you the skin is mine,” John said.
“How did it go?” he asked.
“Oh.” A smile jerked on Sherlock’s lips. “Okay.”
“Okay. Good. Um, are you thirsty? Hungry? I’m going to grab myself something to eat. I’m starving. You’re welcome to join me. I have spaghetti and meatballs and Tikka Masala in the fridge.”
“I know. But I only thought about it. I didn’t actually go through with it. “
John narrowed his eyes at him.
John brushed his fingers through said hair, pressing it flat as well as he could.
“Let’s go to a pub quiz.”
“I would hope not. Let’s lie here for a bit, then we can go to the beach.”
No. He couldn’t do this. He had to remember. Had to face the truth, as horrible and nonsensical and agonizing as it was. He had no choice. His breath shuddered as he pressed Cancel on the train ticket order form. He dropped his head on the keyboard, gasping, sucking in stubborn breaths, an invisible fist crushing his throat. His cuts and ankle ached, screaming at him despite the painkiller that John had given him. Such a caring doctor for someone so selfish. Why did Sherlock have to bear the burden of his secret? Why couldn’t John have chosen someone else? Sherlock didn’t even live here, for fuck’s sake. He couldn’t be John’s friend. He didn’t want to be John’s friend. He wanted to go home to a world were selkies weren’t real. But that wasn’t possible, was it?
“Don’t get soppy on me. I’m just saying. Besides, you don’t need my approval.”
“She’s known Greg for years and hasn’t suspected. I don’t mind her knowing, really. We can ease her into the subject if you’re worried about her reaction. I won’t just spring it on her like I did with you, I promise.”
“I know that. You don’t need to say it.”
“Your heartbeat is elevated,” John said, hand pressed to the pulse point in Sherlock’s ankle, the bandage half unrolled. He frowned up at Sherlock, worry in his eyes. “Are you okay? Are you in pain?”
“That is certainly a good reaction. Did you keep them?”
“I’m so glad to see you,” Sherlock drawled, stroking John’s nape, fingers slipping beneath his collar to soak up as much of John’s warmth as possible.
Besides, his current chances were decidedly male inclined courtesy of Greg, who interrupted his bleak musings by calling him. Smiling at his name on his mobile screen, Mycroft stood up and walked out of the screening room, leaving the beach scene playing behind him. They had been in communication since their talk, but in a limited fashion, reminiscent of when Greg had first gotten together with Susan. Greg needed the distance, yet it ached nonetheless.
Mycroft startled, snapping out of his observational haze, a coping mechanism he used to calm down. Greg sat beside him. The weight of his body mere inches away made Mycroft gasp. What was happening to him? He shut his eyes, sucking in a breath. It did nothing to fortify him.
Greg thought for a second.
“And then we spent half an hour complaining about Mycroft,” Sherlock told Mrs. Hudson the next day, grinning from ear to ear. “God it was glorious.”
“You have sex with people after knowing them for an hour.”
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
Greg stepped back away from Sherlock, who was inches from his face, and pulled the open edges of his coat tighter around him, as if to block Sherlock’s gaze or to protect himself, but his apprehension was lifting in favor of his usual annoyance with half the things that Sherlock did. Finally. He didn’t honestly think that Sherlock was going to hurt him, did he?
“It’s okay,” the man said in a soft, reassuring voice. “I’m a doctor. My name is John. What’s yours?”
“Forget I asked that,” Sherlock said. “I was only teasing.”
“I know Lestrade’s first name,” Sherlock said, testy.
“I wasn’t wearing it like a garment. I was…” He stopped himself, pressing his lips tightly together, looking uncertain as to whether he should continue speaking. “You weren’t hallucinating, alright?”
“Please stop,” Sherlock said, placing his hands on John’s shoulders and neck. “I don’t need that. I understand you didn’t mean to. It’s how you’re built. How your mind works. I overreacted. I don’t know why I left the room like that. I know you would never demand anything of me.”
“Oh, God,” John said, dropping Sherlock’s hand to rub his forehead. “You were going to go.”
“Oh. Okay. But then… But you’re still interested in relationships, then?”
“I think if I were romantically inclined towards him, I wouldn’t be so unenthused by some of the romantically coded things Greg likes to do. Or perhaps that doesn’t matter. In any case, I don’t think that’s what’s happening here, but what I do feel toward him is new. Well, not new anymore. But specific to him nonetheless. And intense. It’s hard to describe. No term seems to fit properly.”
“Shit,” he cursed under his breath, reaching out to shut it off.
John looked down at Sherlock’s foot, which still rested on his lap, and bit his lip.
“Maybe. I can’t remember it happening, though. What happened to you in Dover? You stayed for three weeks after the case was over. Then you come back suddenly calling me by my first name. You made friends with the doctor who helped you, and you clammed up when I asked about him and asked me to come here to catch up on specific things. What are these specific things?”
John’s forehead smoothed out.
John frowned.
“Do we even want to know what by?” Greg asked, dubiously raised brows indicating that he didn’t actually want an answer.
“It’s okay,” he told Greg. “There’s no point trying to lie about it now. Sherlock knows about me, anyway. I told him all about it.”
John covered his face with both hands, groaning.
“I’m not just here because of what you are.”
“It’s far too late for that. I had to endure a heart to heart with Mycroft. It was unbearable.”
He startled, gasping at the sensation beneath his palm.
He smiled fondly at Sherlock, who grinned back, kneading his palm under his fingertips.
