I wish it had been this simple weeks ago.
There should not be a spiderweb there.
************************************************
He needed......
“I'm fine”, he says. He doesn't sound fine.
Of course he had already told John he had never been in a relationship before but John had just assumed that maybe he had had dalliances before.
, Sherlock had said.
But if he truly cared for John.
Hooper.
He has been so good at staying away.
There is something about her.
John let's out another small laugh.
There was an inscrutable look on Holmes' face now. John wanted to both punch and kiss it at the same time and since he didn't seem to be capable of doing either of those things he decided to lash out with words instead.
“Hey”, he says. His voice is deep and drenched in the remnants of sleep and I want him to be like this all the time. Soft and unguarded and close and....mine.
Just beyond the edges of their vision.
John did not even see Holmes leave in the morning. By the time he got up both the black  horse and its master were already gone.
Warm and comforting.
“We're talking now.”
He zips up his bag and hoists it on his shoulders. He makes a point of not looking at Mycroft as he does so.
He walked along the field aimlessly.
There seems to be more magic in the world than there has any right to be.
Hunched over his desk, his face and arms resting on a large book.
John looks gorgeous in dark jeans and a light blue button down shirt that does wonders for his eyes while I just look cold and awkward and Patrick just referred to me as 'The Fairy'.
Sherlock is shifting on the couch.
It had been Mary then.
After a sleepless night spent riding his horse as fast as he could while the winter-night slid its cold, harsh fingers beneath his clothes and under his skin.
Who knows.....maybe he's got a whole string of boys he's secretly dating.”
And, honestly, it's all fine by him.
“We should get you back inside”, Sherlock says then, “you've been through quite enough tonight.”
Thank God.
This chapter is inspired by "the Sun and the Moon" by  Annalise Emerick.
The door is opened slowly and reluctantly and it does nothing to improve his mood.
But this time he thinks he recognizes the voice.
“Mr. Watson”, Holmes' loud baritone can almost be felt as he speaks to Mary loud and clear, “will come to Mrs. Hudson when he is done assisting me. You can tell her that. And you, Miss Morstan, should go back to your own chores. It is what I pay you for after all.....isn't it.”
He'd rather think of John Watson.
He still spends his lunch-breaks at the rugby-table.
Apparently something had still been clearly visibly on his face because Finn sighed and rolled his eyes in a way that reminded him very much of Holmes and once again something very like jealousy roused inside of him.
John can't really help it. These seats are just so narrow. He's flying coach after all.
I apologize.
Why he decided to go watch a movie.
“You're not going to tell anyone about my dad are you?”
“Yes?”, Mycroft Holmes says. One eyebrow raised as he looks down on John and gives him a haughty, questioning look.
And so he waits patiently for news from Finn.
I still feel the same way about John as I did when it was just the two of us on a beach in the summer sun.
Sherlock gives a small nod again.
Everybody around him is talking, laughing, dancing......he doesn't quite know what to do with himself.
“Is he
His horse was having a difficult time as well. Its head low to the ground and every breath it took just as labored as the next as its hooves scraped the ground with every pace.
“We need to talk”, the Elf says.
“Agatha....”, is all she says before she bursts out crying once again.
“Very mature, Sherlock”, Mycroft says as he sighs and steps back.
He's probably not a man at all.
And as the sky around them darkened, so did the expression on Sherlock's face.
But I also don't want to disappoint Molly.
That Sherlock did not want him.
“It's alright.....we'll be alright”.
At first I could not believe my eyes.
John is still not speaking.
John has been asking him this exact question a lot ever since they started talking to each other again.
He really likes this play. He likes the simplicity of how love is portrayed in it. How nice would it be if there really was a flower that would just make people fall in love with you.
That's another 21.600 seconds.
John is so proper when he's talking to my mother. He's being polite but he's almost being polite to a fault. As if it's a shield he wears to hide something else. Something hidden. Something.....
Her face falls as she covers her mouth carefully with the fingers of her right hand.
He needs to think on what to do next.
It's not fair and it's not right and maybe having Molly as a friend is just what I need right now.
He feels he will most likely fail.
There is steam coming out from under it and the skin of her face and neck is flushed.
John actually laughs then. The sound once again sincere and
“Hello! Looo......”
****************************
“You have not yet done great things”, the voice seems to come from inside his head now. A whisper that sends chills down the back of his neck, “because you have not paid the price yet.”
At first John isn't sure what's happening. It all seems to go so fast. But then Holmes suddenly goes down to his knees and the medallion rolls away from his limp fingers only to come to a halt somewhere underneath the sofa.
There's a moment of silence between them where Greg seems to think things over again while Sherlock contemplates leaving before he does figure it all out.
John's hands always stay above the waist however and he keeps his pelvis turned away purposefully.
Silently he thanked his lucky stars that he was still in the early stages of heat and it was still so early in the morning that everybody else was fast asleep.
He could still go back home. Forget his deal with Sebastian. Leave Sebastian waiting for him in vain. Waste his time. That'll show him.
He is tired.
Trying to become the man he thinks is deserving of someone like John.
“I've missed you too”, John says. And then: “can I touch you?”
They both end up laughing then.
The look on her face turns from surprised to apologetic as she moves the iron away from the sheet she's been working on and back to the fire-place behind her to heat it up again. The obstinate wrinkle she had been pressing it to seems to have been smoothed out as she flattens the fabric even further with her delicate hands but John can still see plenty more imperfections just beyond her reach.
John has no idea how he does it but he wishes he could sleep too.
(but I'm pretty sure a lot of you had already guessed this particular plot point).
John looks at him and squints his eyes but says nothing. Sherlock is pretty sure his wonderful, but sometimes pretty dimwitted, husband might be more than slightly drunk.
This longing.
“It's only been a couple of hours”, he says.
Miss Hooper glances at her dancing aunt once again before she leans herself over the table in order to whisper to Holmes conspiratorially.
He was alone.
She just needed an excuse to enter my room without making it look as if she is snooping on us.
Sherlock hasn't heard it in a very long time.
And, even though it should not be possible in this light from the distance he was standing at, John could clearly make out  the look of sadness and concern he still bore on his face.
'How can you possibly drink that', he said.
“You want to come and play in our backyard?”, John had asked, “I found a lizard there yesterday!”
He'd like to know but he sees no viable way in which to ask her about it.
It doesn't appear to be a particularly bad neighborhood.
Something....or someone?
If that happens the fine tears that have already been steadily forming across Sherlock's heart will rend all the way through. Tear him apart from the inside out and he will surely die.
He knows he should stop and apologize to her but he's got more pressing matters to concern himself with at the moment.
Lords and ladies alike.
I feel relieved, I feel comfortably warm instead of this sweaty nervous heat for the first time that day and maybe my guard is slipping just a little bit too early because I don't see the two boys coming from the other direction until I bump in to them.
Even-though she is young she has lived with this.....whatever this is.....for far too long.
His sentences flow so freely now. Now that he is calm and happy and himself. I wish he could just trust me enough to be like this all the time.
“Your aunt who is sick”, John explains to Molly.
I just wish I could see John.
That he would corner me again in an empty broom-closet and interlace our fingers again while he kissed me softly and whispered words in the breaths between us.
He had almost forgotten John was still in the room with him.
Now that all they have left to do is wait for Finn to get in touch he finds he quite enjoys spending time alone with Holmes.
“.....I've been thinking about you all week......”, breathed into the skin just behind my ear.
Holmes might not see him as an equal....as something special.....but that is how he sees Holmes.
'Good.' Holmes looked downright smug. 'You can have it if you want.'
“- and I've got you, I've got years and years of happiness and happy memories behind me and yes, I am sad that it's over but I will never be sad that I had it. And I'm so,
Sometimes the voice is so loud that it drowns out what people are saying to him.
“Ehm....I don't think the coffee-place is still open”, he replies.
Could she mean the medallion? He hadn't thought anyone had even noticed him wearing it.
If John can't reach Sherlock with words he'll try something else.
He throws his sheets to the floor one final time and, in nothing but his boxers, he makes his way to the window where he gingerly pulls the curtains to the side.
He needs answers and, if not now, he's afraid they'll be in this dance for the rest of eternity.
Even now that he knows why that is and that he'll never have what he wants.
A dark king only wearing the face of a man because, for the time being, it amuses him.
Her hand in his hair.
“I'm always careful”, Sherlock says.
But no, that can't be it, Sherlock has been observing John during chemistry.
(See the end of the chapter for
But, bit by bit, like flashes of a camera in a darkened room fragments of it had started coming back to him.
should try not eating for once”, he says, “might help with your diet.”
The voice stays quiet as if it knows Sherlock is not done talking yet. Somehow this angers him even more.
With soft touches, manipulating his body and arms gently John searched him for any wounds, but, just as that cold night oh so long ago, none could be found.
Only in his dream he doesn't call him that.
Sherlock wonders if he'll ever see her again.
John was grinning from ear to ear when he walked into the library the next Thursday. As soon as Sherlock saw him he just sighed and shook his head.
One of a kind.
He climbs down the carriage and tries rolling his shoulder to get it to unlock but it doesn't seem to help. The muscles are tense and hard and unwilling the release the tension built up during the day no matter how hard he tries.
John sits by his side on Sherlock's old sofa and watches the movie.
I feel like such a fool.
'Is everything alright?' John had to know.
For the life of him he can't figure out why John would do such a thing.
“Should have told you what?”, he spits out, “that I couldn't get in touch with you for a week because my father took my phone away because there was a number in there he didn't recognize? That he tends to drink too much when he's home and when he does he can get mad about literally anything? And when I think I've figured out what makes him mad he comes up with something new to call me a failure and a disappointment over? That for our second date I had to climb out of my bedroom-window to get to your house because he had decided to lock me in my room that day? That I sometimes end up bruised because my father believes in a strict upbringing? That I told him I, maybe, am in love with a boy and he got so mad about that that he decided to try and break my nose? Is that what I should have told you, Sherlock? Because that's usually not what people want to hear me say and when I do they generally leave me behind and I can deal with people leaving me but not you......not you.......I just can't.........I......”
There is a bus he needs to catch.
Once again the words cut through the darkness uncomfortably as they seemed to remain where Sherlock had dropped them. Smothering John like a dark shroud. This time it was his turn to tense up.
At this point there is no difference anymore.
The spider thinks he is speaking to her.
I am still trying to wrap my head around it myself.
send Watson away. For his own good. Although he can't explain any of this to him. Knowledge is dangerous and if Watson thinks he can help....be of use.....if he so much as thinks Sherlock wants him by his side......he will not leave. And he will put himself in danger. Because Watson is selfless like that.
The creature growled again. Louder this time. For a second John thought he could hear words in the growls and barks the wolf produced, but all too soon the fairy-queen lifted her hands to the moon and sent a different spell their way.
This time the smile on John's face is still incredulous but more sincere.
John wonders what kind of secrets both these men are keeping from each other.
He sleeps a little bit but when he is awake all he can think about is Sherlock.
Sherlock extended his hand towards Mrs. Watson, but she kept her arms firmly crossed as she looked him up and down, both eyebrows raised and her lips squeezed tightly together as if she was tasting a lemon as she took in his appearance. How Sherlock was not flinching under her gaze John had no idea. He himself was busy willing the ground to swallow them whole.
He spots a table close to the one that John is sitting at that has a couple of empty chairs at the end of it.
Behind them the door to the house opens and closes again. There are footsteps on the gravel and before Sherlock realizes what is happening John is moving away from him again.
They deserve it.
John's worried face comes into view, eyes stern, brow creased and lips a tight line, but that might be a memory from before.
The light filtering in through the windows now more orange than gold as the sun sinks beneath the horizon and sets the world aflame with its dying light.
The look of concern on Mary's face makes way for one of hurt and wounded pride.
He should have thought this through more.
But then there are words.
And with every second that passes he can feel John and his warm smiles slip away from between his fingers like sand.
It must have been a dream after all. Surely something so horrid could not possibly be real.
Suddenly the stranger turns around again. Perfectly timed to beat and nothing but elegant of course. John almost chokes on his own tongue as suddenly their eyes meet.
Through the vastness of space and time that inhabits his living-room.
Neither of them are the same.
He really hopes Holmes hasn't just left again.
“Sherlock....”, Finn had tried but one fiery look from Holmes in his direction had told him it was best to pick his battles and try again some other day.
It has been a long time since he has found himself actually looking forward to a ball but tonight he most definitely is.
Fear that, one day, one of Mycroft's elegant feet might slip or his grip might be just a little bit too loose.......he fears Mycroft will get hurt.....or.......
He's been tossing and turning right up until his alarm goes off and when he looks at himself in the mirror in the morning his hair is a downright mess.
*********************
Well....the words
I have a feeling he's just using me to take care of chores he doesn't like doing himself but I don't really mind.
Sherlock gives him a weak smile.
It is large and heavy, the sheets feel like satin and the boards and posts are decorated with delicately carved images of different celestial bodies. In the center of the headboard is a representation of the moon-goddess herself. Her features soft, her hair flowing in an unseen breeze and her eyes, inlaid with silver thread, shine like stars as the light of the sun hits them.
“Will you be alright.”
Empty husks.
He cannot quite figure out if what he plans to do is in Watson's best interest or purely his own. Right now he doesn't care.
'He said it would protect me.....'
The honeyed tones of John's voice reach his ears.
John likes me.
There is a forest in the distance. The trees a dark, massive wall against the night sky.
It didn't really seem to fit her style. She usually liked to play with Sherlock personally. She hardly ever sent her “minions” out.
'I was so close.'
John wasn't really sure what to do now. Was he supposed to leave master Holmes here, get someone from the household, escort him in the house himself....he wasn't sure if any more touching was appropriate at this point. He was pondering over the possibilities in his head when suddenly he noticed the blood. Dripping from underneath master Holmes sleeve from his fingers to the barn floor. There was quite a lot of it.
“I'd be eternally grateful to you, Miss Huntington.”
For a moment he forgets his damaged face and bites his lip only to grimace when a fresh drop of blood wells up again.
He's actually relieved he doesn't.
And that makes him doubt just the tiniest of fractions. And maybe Mary sees he is starting to doubt because she takes another step forward.
'I do not believe these flowers belong to you either, sir', he replied lifting his chin defiantly.
“And you're not going.”
Sherlock still doesn't reply.
The same bed where, just last night, John had had that strange and very intimate dream about his master.
“Everybody is talking about it”, she says, “there's this rumor that one of the rugby-guys is secretly gay.”
Only now do I realize one of them is Greg.
The relationship between Sherlock and John deepens.
John thinks he is here for, for lack of a better word, “business”. He thinks that is why Sherlock has called for him. To discuss matters about the medallion, Morgana, the Magpie King......and perhaps that is what they should be doing.
He looked at Holmes one last time. Now that the adrenaline was leaving his body he was a bit unsure about what to do next.
John just smiles at him.....John looks so happy......why......
John sighs and he sounds pained and utterly exhausted and.....sad.
At the moment he is scrubbing away at his bare chest. The scar on his left shoulder sings when he splashes it with cold water.
The room behind the door still looks exactly the same. The marble of the floors and walls kept pristine and shining, the incense still burning away stinging his eyes and throat, the high windows still letting in hardly any light and the seven robed and hooded figures in gray kneeling on the floor.
Mary.
All my hopes are dashed when I see Molly's face light up when I tell her about the party.
Sherlock is quiet for a while.
With the knowing....
“Yeah, me”, John says, “and you are?”
And then John is back to kissing him again.
But every single time he's close to him, John leaves him tongue-tied and flustered......and for the first time in his life.......he thinks he likes it.
“A good thing I speak Italian too then.”
“Rugby”, I say. But it comes out a bit hesitant. As if I'm the one being caught in a lie. As if, deep down, I don't really believe John when he tells me things like that. And that makes me feel guilty too. The fact that I think he lies to me and the fact that I've also been too scared and weak to really ask him about it. I am a confused mess bubbling over with guilt that might not even be my own.
I sigh.
It is time to get Holmes and Watson involved.
If he were to leave, then why not now.
Sherlock nods again. His eyes big, mesmerizing pools in his face as his curls bob along.
It had all been too soon.
“Wanna go and catch lizards tomorrow?” John had said.
“Dancing”, he says, “dancing's not a crime last time I checked.”
“So, a lot then”, not even a question anymore. Finn knows he's right. He's like that older, more experienced brother who always knows what kind of embarrassing secrets you're hiding and enjoys them far too much.
Oh, how he wants.
Sunlight, a warm touch and a breathing, living body to hold.
“Once given I can not give this back to you”, she says.
Because that's the reality she prefers.
When John is not here.
“Yes, I am an actual cop so I'm not going to rob the place. No, you're not in trouble. And I have seen you before although you might have forgotten me. My name is Greg Lestrade but you can call me Greg and I need to introduce you to someone.”
“Nothing”, he says again.
Not holding.
Mycroft sighs.
Once again gentle, oh so gentle, and he loses his train of thought again.
But things like that....magical things.....were so easy to believe when you found yourself in the middle of them.
First things first.
Things between them are usually very different in the light of day.
A couple of teachers notice me as they pass by but none of them seem to care enough to actually say anything or send me away.
I want to be able to have this in public. Holding his hand like this. His sturdy fingers between the dark galaxy on my nails under the open sky and the light of the sun instead of the sickly yellow of a bare bulb.
He looks down at the young boy desperately trying not to cry as he hides his face in the folds of Mycroft's shirt. His heart barely able to contain all the love he feels for his little brother.
I only just manage to throw up inside of the toilet instead of the floor in front of it.
I want to see John. I have to see John.
“Everybody has a thing.”
When Mrs. Hudson finally finished with the tea she put down a cup in front of John and placed one for herself in front of the chair at the opposite side of the desk.
*************************************************************************************
It took him a moment to realize the boy was looking at him expectantly.
'You'll never get better if you don't eat, John', his mother said while she patted the back of the hacking ball of misery that seemed to have currently replaced her son.
“Please”, John says and a tiny piece of Sherlock's heart starts to crack, breaks off and wedges itself in between his lungs, making it hard for him to breathe, “it won't be any fun without you. You'll have a good time....I promise!”
Until she realized that what she wanted and what Sherlock wanted were two entirely different things.
John just nodded. The distance between them, however small, was beginning to become unbearable. The heat that was roaring inside him starting to make him insecure. Not understanding why the alpha of his choice was denying him.
Sherlock says.
He still doesn't recognize himself.
***************************************************
Today will be the last time you will ever see me. If there is something you wish to say to me still I suggest you do it now, because this will be the last chance you'll ever get.'
'Yes....god....yes.'
It's large. About the size of a fist and the skin is twisted and uneven where scar-tissue has attempted to close the gaping wound as well as it could.
Electrifying.
It's not as if John hasn't seen what's underneath them before.
He quickly stomps those feelings down.
They had somewhere to go first.
“I.....erm.....”, Greg says. He rubs the back of his neck again, is silent for a couple of seconds, clears his throat and then tries again, “you look nice today....I.....erm....I like your hair like that.”
Somehow he felt as if he didn't belong there anymore.
Anything.
I have a vintage poster of Audrey Hepburn because I'm still maybe a little bit of a gay stereotype, a poster with the table of periodic elements because it comes in handy when I'm doing my chemistry homework but it has 'Ah! -The element of surprise' tagged on at the end as a joke.
There will probably be a couple of other members of the household there.
He needs to prove to the both of them that he is even worthy of the possible future that sleeps with them in this hospital bed.
I try to smile at her but my face still doesn't seem to be my own.
“John....”, Greg says again as he sits down beside him. John turns his head to look at him and the expression he finds on his friends face can only be described as one of sympathetic concern.
Granted, it's not a very good plan but after laying awake for almost the entire night it's all he has and he's tired and groggy and if this is what he's got to work with then so be it.
John's hand on his and his head on John's shoulder.
“Good morning, Sir”, he says. More out of habit than anything else.
I give her the barest hint of a smile. Just the tense pursing together of my lips. I silently plead for her to drop the subject but of course she doesn't.
Commanding.
He looks at his text. He always signs with his initials so he's done so this time as well....without even thinking....will John think it's stupid?
“How?” all John ended up saying.
'No.' all he said.
Sherlock doesn't even need to lift his hands this time.
And in a way it did.
What....
“No! No! I like it!”, John says. Perfect John who will never see all the faults in him no matter how hard he tries apparently, “Of course I like it.....it's just.....different.....less “you”. Well.....it is “you”. Obviously it's you. Just...”you” but......tamed.”
Watson was a pragmatic man. A soldier. A doctor. And loyal to a fault. He cared for Holmes. That much he was certain of and Holmes himself, although he would never admit it, believed the man was the bloody sun and moon and all the stars combined.
It doesn't help that at night he still sees things that aren't there.
He felt the alpha empty. A rush of warm fluid in his most private of parts. It felt wonderful. The fire inside of him finally quenched. It felt right. The world felt right. It was perfection.
She doesn't understand.
at the same time as John says:  “I like it.”
John was sitting in his room when his father suddenly burst in. He had a smile on his face and a piece of paper in his hand.
The spell looks like a small cloud made out of gas and fireflies. John's not entirely sure what it's for. Holmes explanation had been a bit too hasty and, to be completely honest, John's mind had still been a bit dulled down by post-orgasmic haze.
Destined to end up like this.
Sadly though they did not have 10 more minutes. Turned out they didn't even have 10 minutes to begin with, because as they left the confines of the tool shed they had used to spend time together, John still sporting an awkward erection, he heard a familiar, shrill voice and immediately froze.
“Sure.”
Faint, blue and incredibly fragile and......it is calling to him.
Sure there were no stairs here, but the last time he had carried Holmes in a similar fashion there most decidedly had been. He had carried Holmes up the stairs to his small bedroom that night. At the time he had assumed his master had been unconscious for all of it. Now he wondered how much of it he actually remembered.
I turn him around and push him backwards so his back hits the wall of the house. He goes willingly.
He does not look at John and he does not reply.
As they ascend the stairs, Holmes in front and John behind - some traditions are hard to break with - John once again feels as if he can't breathe.
Just his own stupidity and insecurities.
She can wait.
Maybe, in his mind, the latter has won out after all.
Sherlock has never flirted in his life.....he has no idea how people do it......
“That I did........John......”
Is his new theory going to be disproved this early in the process?
Sherlock was getting closer and closer to his destination. The sound of his feet on the floor now incredibly loud in the darkness that surrounded him as he made his way to a relatively new part of his mind palace.
It's nothing short of a miracle that John is even still here now that he knows even a little bit about the drugs.
It is deadly serious now.
Words in the silence.
“What are you two doing here?”
Not knowing had, at that moment, seemed a better option than finding out that this was all he was ever going to get.
In his dream the sun is just starting to rise and a soft beam of light filters through a crack in the curtains. Just as it is doing right now, in the waking world.
The visitor does not say anything. They just close the door behind them and wait.
At least she's not screaming anymore.
She isn't even allowed to play with Holmes. The King has ordered her not to.
Today is a Thursday and on top of that it's fairly early in the morning still so that means that  the place, not the most popular of coffee-bars to begin with, is pretty much deserted.
The screen still says:
Trying to make sense of the sparse information Sherlock has given him so far in his head.
Knee high grass waved at him invitingly in a soft breeze and flowers in every color imaginable were dotted across the landscape in mesmerizing patterns.
“I might have had one beer too many”
I type back:
The calm before the storm.
“I'm sorry”, I say, my tongue stumbles slightly over the 's', “I need to get home.”
It's all this magic in the air.
He stares ahead again. The hood has almost completely fallen back from his face and I can see his cheeks are slightly flushed.
He just looks at him and John feels laid bare and nervous and guilty once again.
Kind of the downside of not really having a lot of friends at school. I can't really go up to anyone and ask them. So I make due with the snippets I catch here and there and wait impatiently for lunch-break to arrive so I can ask Molly.
purpose an omega serves. Striking a fortuitous bond and bringing your family honor, riches and power would be the only useful thing you have ever done for this family.
“Hmmmm?”, John's reply as his eyes quickly glance over to Sherlock where he is standing, dejectedly, by the door, only to return to the page that he
Holmes just nodded and an uncomfortable silence filled the air.
Not anymore.
Sherlock always seems to be so at ease.
he had asked
“What are you thinking about?”
He had only himself to blame.
Long brown hair tied together in a simple pony tail, eyes that are just a bit too small, a knitted sweater with a colorful pattern, her knuckles too white as she grasps onto the strap of her backpack just a little bit too tightly.
The number looked real enough.....
John feels himself starting to panic now. He doesn't know any of these dances. If, somehow, his abhorrent conversation skills have not given away his true identity, his dancing skills certainly will.
“He's.......nice....”, I try because, at this point, I feel I should at least try and contribute somewhat to the conversation. Partially because that's how conversations work but also because I find myself becoming slightly intrigued by Molly.
He still doesn't know the full story.
I look up.
“You're leaving tonight”, John says. Not a question. Just stating the obvious. John's voice is not shaky or insecure. It rings out like a bell in the quiet of the hall around them.
He feels his anger rise.
“Mary, go back to your room. There are dangerous things about. You shouldn't just be roaming the halls.”
She'll kill him first so Holmes can watch him die.
We get shushed by the elderly couple quite a couple of times.
“Now will you tell me where we are going?”
“Either you like someone or you don't”, I say.
I gently clean his face but he flinches every time I get close to his lip.
I don't know.....
So now here they found themselves. Sherlock panting heavily, producing the occasional groan or broken off word, his pants just opened far enough so John could access his now achingly hard cock and John on his knees in front of him.
John let her kiss him. A lie for a lie, he thought.
John doesn't want to hurt him. Doesn't want to see him hurt.
Sherlock had been ten. John had been twelve.
So John just stayed on friendly terms with most of the household staff and he even met Mrs. Holmes and her daughters on the odd occasion they needed a carriage provided for them for a trip into the neighboring town or to visit friends.
Sherlock can't do this.
They haven't even discussed where John will sleep tonight.
“Did you like him?”, she asks, “did he give you his number?”. Her accompanying smile far more sincere than my own. And then I notice her lips. Molly is wearing lipstick again. The same red shade she had worn to the party and had made her look like a new girl entirely.
Like going to house-parties.
“What do we do now?” he asks.
“Am I really, John? I'm not the one cheating on my girlfriend.”
Nothing but silence on the other end of the line.
The landscape is draped in perpetual joyless night.
He tells me things.
It had appeared as if Sherlock had vanished from the face of the earth.
It will get finished....I just don't know when yet.
The closer Sherlock got to John the more uncomfortable he felt. The wrongness seemed to cling to John still. His head hung low, his arms limp and useless at his sides as his shoulders gently shook. Was John crying?
Slowly he ran the tip of it along the shell of John's ear and, breath hot, heavy and rank, he whispered into it: 'Maybe I should check just how hot you actually are.'
In the early hours of the morning a letter finally arrives at the Hooper estate.
It had started with a sudden darkening of the sky. Then a rumbling in the distance accompanied by the sporadic faint flash of lightning.
The mattress of the bed he is in is way too soft to be his own, the bed is on the wrong side of the room entirely and the early morning sunlight filtering in through a gap between the  dark red – instead of blue, why aren't they blue- curtains forces him to squint his eyes, making it hard to see in general.
In one swift move he took Sherlock as far in his mouth as he dared. Making sure his teeth were covered and gliding his tongue along the underside of Sherlocks shaft. He had moved both hands to Sherlocks hips now which was just as well, because Sherlocks legs were shaking so much at this point that John was afraid he might collapse without his hands there to help keep him anchored against the wall.
“I'd love that!” she exclaims.
His eyes drifted towards the house. None of the lights were on. Making the windows seem like large black eyes, staring back at him.
Sherlock had been quite pleased to find John Watson still in his bed when he woke up.
It's what keeps her going when she's having a particularly tough day. That there is an end to all of this....or.....a point....a reason....something....anything.....nothing.
Not tonight.
They needed the rest. Both of them.
He looked at his bed. With the cold weather of the last few days he had been given a couple of extra blankets to stay warm.
And there is a blinding flash of light.
More like myself.
“Sei un idiota”, Sherlock says.
Intimate.
The dapple gray horse was a docile creature. Going willingly with John as he had one hand on the bridle and the other on the reins as he led it to a free stable. With this gentleman arriving so late he figured he would probably be amongst the guests staying the night at Holmes manor. There would be plenty of time to get the horse brushed down properly, but with the stables being so drafty and the night being so cold he should probably still get the horse dried off relatively quickly.
“It didn't go well?”
'I'll tell Philip you'll be there', she continued in a loud mock whisper and winked at him.
What he's setting himself up for.
But then John lets out a long and shaky breath and he slightly loosens his death-grip on the wheel as his shoulders sag.
Sherlock had nodded and had followed after John. The sun had shone on his hair then just as it does today. To Sherlock it had seemed as if a piece of the sun itself had found its way down to earth and had manifested itself in the form of one John Watson.
But nothing gives.
He feels his strength returning with every day that passes.
There still was a faint scar behind his left ear from where his father's ring had made contact.
“Holmes had been out on a gambling spree and had lost what was left of the family fortune.”
“I beg to differ”, she says, “he's been pining over you ever since we got here.”
He wants to.....
“You don't get much time alone.” There is a smile on Sherlock's face.
He sighs and, this time, adds the proper amount of coffee before turning it on again.
They've already got enough wood to last them through the next three months at least.
Should he have known?
Confused he squints his eyes as he looks at the brightly lit screen in the darkness of his bedroom.
'So? I get to see all the ladies in their pretty dresses and I bet there'll be music.' a dreamy smile had been on her face as she gazed off into the distance and let out an exaggerated sigh.
Their small blue petals sticking out defiantly amidst the white frost tipped vegetation around them.
The next thing he feels is John's breath on his face as their foreheads make contact.
“Apparently”, he continues, “my sister fell in love with a girl and that's why my parents sent her to the other side of the country. To keep them as far away from each other as they could. To try and 'cure' my sister........they told me..........they told me to stay away from you so I wouldn't fall for the same tricks as her........”
He doesn't want to be here.
John is standing outside of Sherlock's house.
It's something he has apparently been carrying with him for a long time.
Far more creatures have been pouring through than usual in the last couple of months.
John is a force of nature that he is utterly and completely helpless to.
Sherlock just nods again.
He's not even wearing shoes at the moment.
This was real.
Over time these now so vibrant blues and purples dotted across my arms and thighs will turn ugly and fade, just as John's feelings for me might have already done.
And maybe it's the cold that's giving me unwanted thoughts but deep within my heart there's a small icy part that's jealous of Molly.
He wonders if she would be considered attractive.
“He talks about a nightmare that keeps him awake. A dark dream that whispers his name  with sharp teeth from behind the walls of a room that doesn't exist.....there's more here.....but....it's illegible.....there's a dark ink-stain on it....or.....something....”
“I'm not the same person”, Sherlock interjects and John gives him a puzzled look.
But I did decide that I'm going to give John space.
I mean....the way he looks at you......I used to look at Mrs. Watson like that too.....when we were still young and had just started dating.”
He remembers John apologizing for....he doesn't know what for.
Morgana weaves another thread to her spell as she waits. It wraps itself around her chest before it shoots off into the darkness around her. It's trying to find a soft spot in the veil. Trying to find a spark of magic from the other side to help it slide through.
And he's right.
“Oh....okay”, Sherlock is  not quite sure how to respond. For weeks now he had assumed that John's girlfriend was on the list of subjects they did not talk about.
'I really hope you're a good doctor.'
In his heart.
“Just getting some fresh air”, she says.
“Don't read that yet!” John says, “I've got something to say first.”
He's not expecting them to.
The stars still twinkle on. None of them turn into bombs. Nothing explodes.
Wonderful, perfect John who always knows just what to say or do.
There is one window with drawn curtains on the far wall.
“Oh!”, she says as she puts her tea down on the table and lifts a chain that hangs around her thin neck delicately, “of course, I haven't taken it off since I got it.”
That they would have this again.
It's 5:11pm by now.
At first he sees nothing out of the ordinary. The outside is vast and he's not sure where to look but then another sound reaches him.
His collar still feels as if it's trying to choke him and the fabric of his new suit itches on his skin. He puts his hands in his pockets to keep himself from scratching and then he takes them back out again.
It is honestly because of the interest this little story seemed to have garnered that I kept on writing on it.
And, after Mycroft had gone, he had imagined that would be how he'd do it. Drown himself in ice. An ironic and yet poetic end indeed.
Has he ever really known her at all?
“This?”
Damn.
“You can't tell people that you don't know me or that I'm not worth it”, I say.
'Wait!', John said, 'where are you going.'
And just as well, he is not supposed to be here.
I'll be totally alone then.
Sherlock feels as if he and John are speaking two different languages entirely. His confusion must show on his face because John sighs and points to an object on the coffee table. The whiskey in his hand sloshes against the sides of the glass as he does so.
A different part of his life.
There is an ashtray in the windowsill.
He can feel his own heart beat in his throat in time with the gentle raps on the door.
His head feels heavy and his thoughts seem to be fragmented and all over the place.
Who is he kidding......what one does in one's sleep means nothing at all.
John shakes his head and shrugs helplessly.
There is a soft and sweet scent that permeates everything in this room and that reminds him of.....magic.....Holmes' magic.
Smug bastard.
But the wanting is different this time.
“Come find me again someday”, she says.
“You know what”, he says, “I don't need this”, and without looking back he leaves the library.
It'll hurt too much.
Especially if he's not openly out yet.
“Because I want you on the rugby team! You're a great captain!”
And she went with him pretty much everywhere.
So far he has avoided thinking about this outcome entirely. He just cannot go back to Sherlock....he can't.
“Got any chocolate on you?”
Finn knew why Holmes had said it though.
One gasp at a time I feel my breath returning to me and finally,
He is well aware that his days with Watson are numbered. When they inevitably go back to Holmes mansion in about a weeks time Watson will probably insist on treating each other as Master and servant again.
The lanterns on the walls had thrown strange shadows on his face. Making the sharp features, that Sherlock had also inherited and would grow into once his face lost its boyish roundness, appear like the sunken bones of a skull.
“Is there someone in your life? Someone you....like?”
She is wearing a long dress the same colour as her skin and hair.
She doesn't deserve it.
I am sad but not surprised.
to do anything and I am certainly not going anywhere with you, sir.....my colleague will be back any minute and.....”
John is looking at Master Holmes where he lays sleeping in the bed next to him.
Not like this.
She blushes again. It's a good look on her. The girl is quite beautiful. In another life he might have pursued her.
I am already burning up underneath just the faintest of his touches but it still doesn't feel like enough.
He had sort of figured that flirting with John would be easy....that he'd know what to do when an appropriate situation presented itself.
'Are you John's alpha?' he asked.
*******************************
Only Finn remains. The only constant in his life so far. The elf wears a worried expression now.
There are too many people here.
Kissing him.
“I bet you would be great at it.”
“Sorry”, he says to Sherlock. Or maybe to himself. Or Mary. Or no one in particular. “It's my girlfriend.”
I just shrug. I don't know. I'm new to all of this. Friends. Relationships. Pretend relationships. All these feelings that come with it. I don't know how to act and so I just act out and I hurt people but I don't know how to tell her any of this. How to tell her that I didn't mean what I said to her and that she's fine the way she is and she's the best friend I've ever had and I really don't want to let her down.
It pierces the night like ice.
Currently they are on a mission behind the Veil to find out where a current “leak” is coming from.
ps: Comments are always appreciated.
John had remained just as cold and aloof towards him as he had always been.
This time he does take another sip from his glass.
The knock on the door is hesitant and soft but Sherlock does not have a moment's doubt who it belongs to.
All he's gotten so far are more questions and he feels like it is high time these two men start giving him answers.
She frowns at me:
young and Mycroft....well....I don't think he's every really been young....and our world had not turned itself upside down yet.
'I was hoping you would say that. You're going to have to come with me.'
And so Sherlock spends another night tossing and turning and trying to make heads or tails of the situation.
'On this particular trip', Holmes continued, 'I am in need of an assistant and I was wondering if you would care to join me. You can take the gray horse of course.'
'I could', John replied, 'but it's going to take me a couple of months.'
“I.....erm.....”, he says and then just stops talking again.
John is gone and Sherlock finds himself sitting alone at the breakfast table.
“What do your parents do?”, I ask him.
He wants fast days and lazy days.
“I'm sorry”, Sherlock says again. More to himself than anyone else.
When Sherlock wakes he feels well rested. He feels energized again. The sunlight filtering through the curtains tells him it's late in the morning. Close to 11 am probably.
Mrs. Hudson's eyebrows raise once again.
Something for the both of them. Something solely theirs.
Sherlock wants to say something else but the sound of shouting voices returns in the background. They grow louder and louder by the second.
The jacket was warm and comforting and smelled like John and the warmth of it seemed to make its way into the depths of Sherlock's chest.
“Come back to bed”, he says.
Seeing him like this quickly made an end to the warm glow that had been spreading through Johns body and a sudden and cold fear was quickly taking its place. Having said what he had set out to say Holmes was evidently getting ready to leave and John couldn't let him. Not before he had had a chance to say what he had been wanting to say for the last three weeks. Not before he had had a chance to unload the weight that had been weighing down his heart and had made him worry about Holmes' absence so.
Mycroft always knew everything.
He truly must be desperate.
He kissed Victor on that bed.
Slowly John got up. It was hard to move when your limbs felt as if they were moving through water. He had heard enough. He felt like throwing up.
The screen remains dark and I fall asleep as the battery slowly drains.
John, in return, had not dared to ask about it. He knew how he got when he was drunk. Mary had told him on several occasions how silly, stupid and sometimes down-right flirty he got when he had had a couple of drinks too many.
Holmes looks tired as the family once again embarks. This time around he is the first to get into the carriage, followed by his step-mother and eventually his two step-sisters.
“I told you!”, John shouts to them once again, “it's my cousin okay?....none of your damn business.......Just go ahead alright? I'll be right there.”
The area inside the cave was small. The roof overhead so low that neither of them could stand up without hitting their heads. The floor was covered with soft moss and in one corner a small oil lamp stood that Sherlock lit as they entered.
He isn't really sure he even knows where
It's all a bit “too good to be true” and there's this nagging voice at the back of his mind that keeps telling him he's going to lose it all.
There are shapes there.
“Oh.”
*************************************************************
There is hurt in his words. A pain he has carried with him for years now. Sherlock doesn't want John to hurt. Not now. Not ever. And he certainly doesn't want to be the cause of it.
So instead Sherlock tries to focus on the sound the wheels make as they come in contact with the uneven road below, the labored rumbling of the engine and the high pitched squeak every time John makes a right hand turn.
Mary huffed out a laugh. 'I know.'
Always.
“You cannot be serious....”
“Begging your pardon, Sir. …..'Mr. Watson' is what I mean of course, Sir.....she said it was urgent.”
'I deal with the dark side of it. It is my job to keep the monsters at bay', Holmes had continued and John had felt the pieces falling into place. During his time in the army he of course had heard the stories too. Stories of unnatural armies. Dark creatures that would only come out at night. Wiping out entire battalions under the cover of darkness. Descriptions of strange creatures that resembled humans, but only in a grotesque mocking way with wide mouths filled with black slime and razor teeth, limbs just a bit too long for their bodies, sharp claws where fingers should be and an almost animal-like speed had been known to almost every soldier. Especially the ones who had been stationed to the North.
His insecurity and doubts temporarily make way for honest curiosity. Sherlock always likes learning new things about John.
Her long and thin, almost white, blond hair. How it hangs neatly braided over her slim shoulders. The oval shape of her face and the sharpness of her nose.
A small traitorous corner of my heart warms itself at John admitting he loves something about me but I quickly stomp it out before it is able to set the rest of me ablaze.
Either The All took an inconsequential day out of his life or they didn't take a day as payment at all.
And anxious.
John handed over the reins silently. His eyes were fixed on Finn.
What if, yesterday, I pushed John so hard I pushed him right into the arms of a woman.....what if.......he wouldn't do that to me though.....would he......
Sherlock just sighed again and gave his signature eye roll. John realized he was starting to grow rather fond of Sherlock's eye roll. Like his strange collection of features it was something so particular to Sherlock. Something that shouldn't possibly evoke positive feelings, but somehow it did and upon seeing it once again John felt as if he was filled with warm light.
Watson wasn't magical. Sherlock was certain of that. But magic seemed to gravitate towards him naturally. So of course he had heard every single story about the supernatural armies when he had still been a soldier. He had not gone looking for these stories, but somehow they had found him.
So far he's found out that John is left handed, hates peanuts in his food, loves the James Bond movies, used to have a dog when he was younger and, apparently, has a sister.
I really, really, really would like to thank everyone who has read, given kudos, commented, bookmarked or subscribed. I had not even expected to have one person reading this.
I finally reach what I believe is the door to the closet. At this time of day there is nobody around. For a moment I wonder if I should knock but in the end I decide to just go in.
Greg is silent.
Maybe....
A day does not go by where Sherlock does not think back on their nights spent together at the inn.
He looked back at the silent house again with its soulless black window-eyes and then back to Sherlock.
Sherlock turns his back to John and the window and turns left because he knows that John will take a right when he leaves. He always does. The nearest bus-stop is in that direction.
Apparently only four minutes have passed since he last looked.
He doesn't.
Why does everything about him have to be elegant and dark and tall and.....John stops himself from finishing that thought.
I knew he wouldn't.
He pretends that, after the game is over, John will come running up to him once more and he'll throw his arms around him and bury his face in the crook of John's neck while John is still out of breath and he will be allowed to do so. Because John will be his and he will be John's.
Mycroft picks up his cup of tea again.
Sherlock didn't think it was possible, but Finn's smile got even bigger. 'I feel there's a “yes” in there somewhere', he said.
I squeeze John's hand again and he squeezes back.
Not so much at the keeping things.
What Holmes had said about the moon and the prophecy had been uncalled for.
John gives the lady in question a scrutinizing look. At the moment she's dancing with her husband. She's wearing a long white dress with lace along the borders. Her neck is positively covered in pearls and she's wearing a hat made out of ostrich feathers. She's quite young still and quite beautiful too but there is something odd about the expression on her face as she takes her husband's hand so he can lead her into the next steps of the dance.
“Greg invited me”, he says. There's just a small bit of him that still thinks John doesn't want him here and he wants to make it absolutely clear that he did not come against John's wishes.
Finn laughs even louder and the flames jump and dance and a couple of embers even shoot out of the fireplace and land on the floor in front of it. John has to move his feet out of the way in order to not get burned.
I wish lunch-break would hurry up and come so I can talk to Molly.
*******************************************************************************
This might not have been such a good idea after all.
They still found themselves in the middle of the fields. They were no where near any village or settlement as far as John could see. The only thing out of the ordinary were two piles of bricks that lay a couple of feet away from each other. It seemed that years ago a small brick wall must have been built here, dividing the field into two parts, but it appeared to have been broken down a long time ago. Two piles of moss grown shattered bricks all that remained now.
He wanted me......
I groan and try to sit up. My brain sloshes around in my skull precariously as I do so.
Hell.....all
He gives her a small, almost imperceptible nod.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
He never says what he means.
John.
At least not anymore after those first awkward questions John had posed him on his very first visit to the hospital.
John wondered if this was where Sherlock slept.
John grips his cards a little bit tighter.
Pleasure is rolling over him like blinding waves and he decides to just close his eyes and give into it. Let himself drown in pleasure.
His eyes were closed and he was not moving. His face was too pale.
There are no words in the English language or, indeed, any language, that can describe all the wonders and intricate details that I adore about your face.
“Sssssh”, John grits out between clenched teeth, he finds it hard to talk and fuck like an animal at the same time. Too many stimuli. Too much pleasure. Too much Sherlock. Too much of everything.
John takes a sip of his new beer.
He doesn't think he could bear it.
Whenever they did talk the conversation could be about anything and nothing.
They must have spoken that afternoon. They often talked.
“I need to find out if there are any clues to be found where I found him.”
He tries to stealthily make eye-contact with Holmes at least but the other man is resolutely looking away at something outside of the stable-complex.
Suddenly I'm all nerves again.
His chest feels too big for his body and he finds he cannot stop himself from smiling.
I move my shaking hands down to the belt and zip of his jeans and I undo them and he lets me. He seems to want it as much as I do.
The nameless hands and faces that just took and never gave.
This is probably still not a date.
Sherlock also only half understands John's meaning.
He feels awful because he knows John is at a party putting the moves on Molly and when they come back tomorrow as girlfriend and boyfriend John will most likely not want to spend as much time with Sherlock anymore....or any time at all.
Holmes stretches out his hand towards him but then stops. His outstretched fingers hover useless in the air.
You would just run your fingers through my curls, sigh, and place a gentle kiss upon them.
The fabric of his jeans still a little bit too course for his tender skin but he'll gladly endure it if it means he can at least feel a little bit like a human being again.
Just them.
“Are you asking me out on a date?”, I ask.
“It's fine”, he says as he gives Holmes a weak smile, “are we going to visit another field then?”
It's late. Well past midnight. They are in John's backyard. Mr. Watson had let them light a fire in the Watson's fire pit and the dancing flames are currently casting a spectacle of flickering lights over the planes of John's face.
Just great.
Holmes nods.
Hot damn.
I really hope you all like this chapter. I hope I got across with it what I wanted to say.
He leans slightly forward to get a better look at the man's face.
Sherlock opened his mouth, seemingly about to speak, but before he could get a single word out the spell reached them, descending upon them like a black rain, and the body in John's arms started changing.
“A little bit....yeah.....”
At the back of the ghostly crowd is her own death.
Maybe he had looked like he needed it.
So pretty it should be illegal.
He had a casual air about him. His hands loosely clasped behind his back, his feet slightly apart as he took in the stables with a sort of half smile on his face.
And yet: here it is.
He doesn't know.
But if these dreams have been omens of pleasant things to come then he shudders to think what kind of events his nightmares prophecy.
Even with all the damning evidence laid before him that would drive any sensible person away.....John had stayed and had offered him.....everything.
At first he thinks he's dreaming, only.....he can't be.....he can't sleep after all.
Maybe she'll be able to give him some answers.
'Oh, sounds fun', John had said. Trying to hide his disappointment behind a polite smile and failing miserably.
But back then he had not known what he knows now.
It's late in the afternoon and they are back at the inn. Back in the privacy of their small room. They are both sitting in chairs by the fireplace but Holmes has not lit it yet.
His father just looked at his sons hands and smirked. Suddenly reminding John of a shark. All teeth and cold, unfeeling calculation. Not a bear at all then, but another predator entirely that had slowly been circling him, hidden beneath the sea of false security that had been drawn up around him. Trying to find his weak spot. And now that it seemed to have found it, it sunk its teeth in deeper and deeper.
He finds himself lying face down sprawled diagonally on a bed far larger than any bed he's ever slept in.
She had said it with such certainty John had not dared to ask her anything else.
And so he decides to keep what he knows to himself. For the time being at least.
Holmes had been standing by the side of his bed. Once again that sad look had been on his face as he gingerly had stretched out his hand and oh so carefully had run his fingers across Johns cheek.
'Boring', Holmes' swift reply, 'what else?'
Oh no.
“I forgive you”, Sherlock says, because a part of him truly does understand.
“Can I kiss you again?”,John asks.
Hard to concentrate when those are burning a hole right through your soul.
*********************************************
**********
Her moment of happiness has been short lived but at least she's had it.
A few more uttered incantations, a wave of his hand and the message lifts off into the air to find Holmes manor and within it Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
'After our little conversation of last week I realized that, being the omega that you are, you would never be able to make a decision like this for yourself.....so I have made it for you.'
John's not entirely sure how he even ended up at this party.
“Well, if that's the criteria we're using whether we start a conversation or not”, he spits out, “I'm amazed I ever get to talk to you at all.”
He coughs and looks away as Holmes gives him a questioning look.
It seems to be all the reassurance she needs.
Licking the sweat from John's neck and chest.
He hopes Mycroft knows he hasn't done that in a long time.
Nobody has even greeted her.
Sherlock goes about the room putting everything new away that he has learned about John and then gets ready to leave again.
For a moment he lets himself pretend they are the only two people left in the world and there are no places they have to be later or people who think they owe them some form of explanation of any kind.
John drags me inside some kind of storeroom and he locks the door behind us because, apparently he has a key to this place.
He had his eyes closed once again. They were both still trying to catch their breath from their mutual laughing fit combined with a lot of shushing because it was the middle of the night and John's mother tended to be a light sleeper.
“There are letters.....words.....in the rain.” Watson says.
“So....what do you think?”
While Mycroft reads, his brow creased, faint lines drawn in the fair skin of his face, flipping pages back and forth, making notes every couple of minutes, Finn sits underneath a large birch tree.
Neither of us really knows what to say or how to say what we really want to say and so we just stand there in the cold shuffling our feet while we are decidedly not touching each other.
team and at least he has the decency to awkwardly cough and look away.
An almost predatory bite that had drawn blood.
If such a thing makes sense.
Holmes looks so defeated. John gathers up some of the magical dust trapped between strands of raven-dark hair and rubs it between his fingers. It immediately starts to glow with a faint ethereal light. They've been practicing magic together over the last week and John finds that the manipulation of Holmes' magic comes easier and easier to him the more he tries it.
Beside him somebody sighs.
- and the shock causes me to drop my bag on the pavement below my feet. Books and papers spill out and I quickly kneel down to stop the September wind from abducting my notes.
And we never said goodbye exactly but all the tiny ways in which he keeps showing me that we actually did hurt way more and....
The tailor had not even batted an eye.
He always feels this way when he's been spending time with his brother.
“Lunch-break was torture....”
Coming home feels like two strong hands that are able to hold him ever so gently and ease his troubled mind with just the lightest of touches.
****************************
Not in the school cafeteria at least.
He remembers John's eyes briefly glancing down as he did so......he remembers John swallowing.
I cry into his shirt and he gently strokes my hair and the back of my neck.
'Watson' he said again. Slightly louder this time as his hand started pulling John along.
The first words the calming voice spoke that Sherlock could actually understand.
She never answers me anyway.
Sherlock laughs too now.
As I lay in my bed with the darkness and silence of my bedroom after midnight all around me I can't help but wonder whether I made the right decision.
John just gives him a soft smile and all too soon John's fingers are gone and John walks away.
He finds himself nodding and as he does so John seems to relax just a little bit more.
, he thinks.
“You promised I wouldn't be your dirty little secret”, I say.
It's just all so absurd and new and terrifying.
“I....”, he says but then stops talking. He has no idea what he wants to say.
Sherlock is even more confused now.
The only relief he found was in the fact that there was no one around to see it.
And looks at himself in the mirror.
There are bruises there.
“Very funny”, John says, “if I'm so good then why are they looking at me like that?”
“You're perfect”, John says. And he doesn't know why he says it or why he says it now or where this is all coming from and somehow he feels that what he says is not quite what he means. He means something deeper. Something with more meaning. But he also knows that this is all so new to Sherlock and he doesn't want to scare him away by telling him absolutely everything that's in his heart.
Sherlock happily complies.
A little angst never hurt anybody, right?
Serene and quiet.
He hated John too, he reminded himself.
John has locked the door and has hidden the key.......
The sun has been heating up the room during the day and the heat still lingers.
And as he grows more aware of his surroundings he silently thanks all the gods that might possibly exist for the fact that Holmes still seems to be fast asleep.
Who is he kidding....of course he has......nosy bastard.
“I doubt it”, he laughs nervously.
He's wearing one of his purple silk shirts again with a matching necktie and dark blue jacket and trousers.
“Yup.”
He thought about calling out for Sherlock, but something about the fog made him feel uneasy. Made him feel like he probably shouldn't make too much noise or draw attention to himself.
His father had explained to him that being able to do magic ran in their family and was passed down from father to son. He had hoped Sherlock would have been spared this fate. Sometimes a son turned out “normal”.
Behind him he heard an enraged scream. The sound of it reminding him of shattering glass, lightning striking and hearts breaking all at once.
Sherlock sighed, relieved, and finally turned his eyes towards John again. This time a spark of hope could be seen in them.
His eyes drifted to the bandage on Holmes arm again. He had to ask: 'are you hurt, sir?'
He decides to be a bit dramatic about it.
Leave a comment if you feel so inclined.
He felt she deserved better.
Asking questions about what he liked to do......genuine interest in Sherlock.
As if there's some sort of living entity.
Now that he has Holmes back by his side John finds the entire situation a lot easier to bear.
“Besides magic”, he ends up saying.
Even now that all his cards are on the table and it turns out he was not holding any aces at all.
And once he makes a decision he's going to have to stick to it.
“Is he not out yet?”, he whispers.
Maybe the struggles and hardships that come before is what makes you actually appreciate it.
The idiot.
I could always call him or send him a text but I think I need to do this personally.
The sun hasn't shown itself in days.
Take him in my hand and watch him come undone before me and
***********************
John's hand softly resting on Sherlock's cheek. The skin underneath getting warmer by the second.
So he just takes another sip of tea.
And then someone had stirred next to him. And he had recognized him immediately. John's messy blond hair softly glowing in the moonlight like a halo. Softly sighing as Sherlock's tossing and turning reached him in his sleep but was not quite enough to wake him up.
The fact that all three of them have walked away tonight virtually unscathed defies all logic.
He will bring him to Molly Hooper, confirm his suspicions and then hide him away as far from the Order as he possibly can.
And another.
Outside a couple of birds titter as the wind rustles the trees.
The scarring not as prominent on the back but still noticeable nonetheless.
My lips find his just as easily as they have ever done and I moan into his mouth as he gently bites my lower lip.
John snorts out a laugh.
"Goodbye's are not forever, goodbye's are not the end. They simply mean I'll miss you until we meet again."
The sound of one set of feet had gradually disappeared into the distance. John had remained by his side. His hand still on his shoulder.
And however much he has been trying to forget them ever since they started, now.....now he suspects that maybe.....they have been trying to tell him something.
From his new vantage point Sherlock suddenly spots something else in the sky streaked with oranges and reds and pinks and purples.
She's talking about her brother. Apparently he's got a new boyfriend but he's constantly complaining to her about him because said boyfriend has a mustache which makes kissing uncomfortable...apparently.
His eyes drift down to the small section of John's abdomen that is still showing and he finds he wants to put his lips there too.
“I'm going to go inside to get some water”, he says, “I'll get you boys something to drink too.”
I pass her by in the hallway between classes a couple of hours later.
getting up again.
Carefully he tapped the surface he was standing on with the toe of his boot.
John just hopes its a good one.
Now he understands why he had believed Holmes' tales about magic, the Veil and the Order all so willingly.
Finn has also never told Sherlock about his relationship with his older brother.
They never turn on any  lights.
John was completely out of breath when he closed the stable-doors behind him. Barely able to stay upright any longer he made it just a couple of steps further until he sank down on the ground. His back against a large wooden crate used to store hay. His lungs felt as if they were on fire as he struggled for air in big, gasping breaths and his leg felt as if someone had stabbed it with a knife. With the way his leg had been acting up today he should definitely not have been running in the cold winter air. But he was almost positive Holmes had seen him. Had looked right at him. It didn't seem possible, and yet....
Sherlock does not want to sleep. He plans to spend the rest of the night memorizing the sound and pattern of John's heartbeat. He finds that the longer he listens to it the more he is convinced he can hear words echoing in between the beats.
John got them all coffee.
'Oh Locky, of course I can. What are you doing all the way out here.....and without your shoes.......you gave us all quite a fright.'
Sherlock flips a page and continues reading. “Less nice” he says.
I make a grab for my phone.
Within the rain he forms words and into them he whispers a sense of direction and purpose.
“I would never lie to you. I withheld information. A completely different thing.”
Whenever John remembered his father, something he tried to do as little as possible, there were always two versions of him. There was the smiling, loving husband and father who gave the best hugs in the world and then there was the version of him John had seen last. His eyes wide and unblinking, his mouth opened in a soundless scream and his face white as the rope he had used to hang himself with cut horrible red lines into the soft flesh of his neck.
John reads the note a second time just to make sure he's not imagining things.
I manage to laugh a little bit too this time.
Will things be awkward and weird if he does join them?
At the moment Sherlock feels like a child. Is this what John wanted to tell him? That Mary and he are an item again? Part of him thinks that Mary is lying. This cannot be true.....during these last couple of weeks John has never once said anything that....
John is taken aback. Has Holmes told her about him? Is it so obvious that he once served in the army? Holmes had known right away....maybe Miss Hooper shares his skills of observation.
O God no.
Sherlock has moved back towards the bathroom door, his hand outstretched towards the lock in order to open the door and let himself out.
The world chaotic and loud as it ever was but right here.....right now.....where they both stand he finds himself in a bubble of tranquil silence and serenity.
Maybe.....
She squeals quietly.
Sherlock felt like throwing up. His insides were too hot and seemingly moving around all on their own accord. He felt as if his skin was made out of fire ants.
As he stares out of the window he notices there are large clouds covering the sun again, casting long shadows in the room and on his mood.
“I do not want to find you around or in Mr. Holmes' room again, John.”
I have fond memories of those days although I have not gone back to reminisce on them in a very long time.
“Is he very mad at you?”
“Where's he?”, John asks.
I tell them here and now and I tell them later too.
Is that what boyfriends do?
“I'm sorry”, she says, “I'm so sorry.”
'That photo doesn't even look like you.'
Sherlock sighs as he dunks his brush back in his bucket.
This time it's Sherlock's turn to laugh although it end up coming out more as a snort than a laugh.
It is drawn to him.
John tries to shrug again, he tries to come off as aloof and unfazed but her words have struck a chord in him. Is he that transparent? Is everyone able to read him just like that?
“He can stay.”
“And? What else?”
“I just feel that....something like this”, John continues talking. His hands weave in different directions only to come back together in front of his chest, “something like this should be private. This is something that belongs to me.....and you......straight people don't have to announce to the world that they're straight.....why should we.....it's just.......”
Can't take his eyes off of Sherlock.
He feels the way he used to feel when he first joined the army. When purpose and meaning once again entered his life. When he thought himself to be happy.....
She has never passed judgment or questioned any of his outlandish plans.
“School ended hours ago.”
John throws him a look that Holmes chooses to ignore.
Like now.
'Are you alright?' he asked.
Well...apart from the fact that a dark power will rise.....apparently.
Finally the cat's out of the bag now.
“The bed is big. Far too big for one person alone. We will both take half of it.”
I give him time.
A smile formed on Mary's lips, but it was a tight, bitter thing and John didn't like seeing it there one bit.
A brief smile formed on his lips at the memory. It all seemed ages ago now.
John gives him another kiss.
That's not how Sherlock remembers it.
“A pity you never got to dance”, Holmes ends up saying.
When they both finally regain their composures, slightly out of breath and lightheaded, it is Holmes who carries on the conversation.
He is a soldier once more.
************************
There's a pretty exciting scene going on at the moment.
He is walking down the street towards the movie-theater and towards me.
He will discover it eventually. She knows he will.
Since I've apparently become invisible to John I don't want to be invisible to the rest of the world too.
This time Finn actually laughs and the flames roar up high.
No marks.
“You're here”, John says.
What if they suddenly had nothing else to say to each other anymore....
I can no longer feel John beside me. Every last part of him has turned to sand and the waves are carrying him away from me slowly but surely.
To feel those short and sturdy but surprisingly tender fingers draw lines on his skin.
Sherlock had spelled the word out for John and John had repeated after him. He had not mocked Sherlock. Had not made fun of him. He had just been honestly impressed.
John concludes his tour of my bedroom and sits down on the bed beside me.
He's good at secretly watching John after all. He's got over a year of experience of it already.
John swallows away a sudden lump in his throat as he hoists his bag in the, already overstuffed, overhead compartment.
She reminds Molly of her own death.
'Indeed, Mrs. Watson', Sherlock replied, 'your John is quite something.'
It makes him feel elated.
There is not even a hint of a smile left now. Holmes looks once again aloof and untouchable. Given John's fears and worries of the day he should like this version better but.....he finds he doesn't.
Things you can not possibly fake.
And again.
I still have lunch at my regular table.
“I mean with that guy”, Greg says, “I was watching you two for a bit this morning and.....”
But John doesn't know.
Please.
“Can we not talk in front of your brother though.....”, John says. He rubs the back of his neck as an apologetic smile is on his face “he kind of creeps me out.”
Needs John.
And so, 15 minutes later, after having given a quick explanation to his mother and quickly making his way up the stairs and into his room, John found himself helping Sherlock climb through his bedroom window. All the while trying his very best not to giggle.
Apparently that's the effect John has on me. Every time he gives me the least bit of attention I feel all hot and moist and I can't keep my hands from shaking.
He doesn't have to look back to know that.
Once again I remind myself that I might not have known him as well as I thought I did.
As he makes his way down the stairs that lead to the stables there is a constant, faint humming sound in his ears and his skull feels several sizes too small for his brain.
“Oh?”, once again there is surprise written all over her face but this time John
He will be here around 7pm.
If he even was a man.
The words form in his brain but skip past his tongue and fall out of his mouth uselessly as sentences and words he never meant to utter and he doesn't mean.
They're about an hour into their session when John suddenly, and completely out of nowhere, says:
“Chocolate?”, she asks.
He has never been here before although she tells him he has been here for a very long time.
Worried that John will send him away.
“Are you sure this is what you want to talk about now”, Sherlock says, “pick your battles wisely, John.'
His own voice sounds unsteady and unnatural to his ears.
He thinks for a moment and then comes to the conclusion that he probably looks sillier being the only one not dancing than being seen dancing poorly.
It is 10:47pm.
His riotous curls tamed for once.
Maybe he'll go and have breakfast in the staff-kitchen first.
John frowned. Uncertain what to think.
He closes his eyes again.
“Sherlock....”
*************************************************************
The blond maid laughed again as she now pressed herself playfully against John.
John gives him a questioning look.
“I'm sorry”, he says. He doesn't mean it.
Sherlock does still get to spend time with John though.
“Are you sure?”
As Holmes exits the carriage he, once again, gives John a small smile but no more than that.
His eyes are itchy and dry and he's got a pounding headache but he finds he'd rather be literally anywhere else than in this room right now. In here, if he closes his eyes, he can still faintly hear the voices whisper to him.
Suddenly the stars overhead have lost their appeal. No longer are they gentle lights blinking at them harmlessly but giant, flaming balls of gas. Or bombs. Ready to drop down and kill either one of them in an instant.
To actually be wanted like that.
He needs time.
Make one small mistake and make him pay for it dearly.
But after the way I left him, he has every right to not entirely trust me, to be confused by me.
I really should try and get some sleep.
The hidden meaning of the words was abundantly clear. For the last two days Wallace had been like a predator in waiting. Waiting for John's heat to begin.
Just “young Miss Hooper”.
I underline it for good measure.
John just takes another bite.
The whole point in sneaking out was to find some kind of escape from them. If only for a little while.
If they are still alright.
I have come to the realization that, like me, Molly has no friends.
“I know.......but you know what you can do?”
Unbelievable.
mage?'
I've already got the messenger app opened before I start second guessing myself again.
He wracks his brain for the most “normal” hobby he has.
Even-though it's November he's not wearing a coat. He's just got a hoodie on that he's got zipped up all the way to the top. He's got his hands stuck firmly in the pockets and he's shivering slightly.
“I feel like you're just making stuff up as we go along”, Finn says.
The kiss had both seemed to last forever and not nearly long enough at the same time.
He's met John in six different hotel-rooms so far.
He has a girlfriend after all.
There is a moment of silence between them then that feels companionable and for a moment John thinks he's being let off the hook as far as the other incident of this evening is concerned but.....this is Mrs. Hudson he's dealing with....nothing gets by her and so their comfortable silence is broken once more when Mrs. Hudson says:
And for tonight I choose to believe her.
And if, maybe, today he has put a little more effort into getting his wardrobe and hair just right he will not call himself vain or apologize for it.
He couldn't seem to be able to figure him out and Sherlock usually hated not being able to figure something out. So he had observed Watson closely in an attempt to find out what made him so singular, but everything he had been able to learn about the man had just added to the enigma.
There will probably be one more chapter after this and I am both happy and sad about this.
And a proper one this time.
'Good to see you're finally standing up for yourself, dear', his mother said, turning towards him. Her tone far too friendly for what John was expecting. He had thought that at this point they would have reached curse word territory at least.
I really don't have to use the bathroom but I need a moment to myself.
Sherlock had allowed him to stay.
At this specific point in time Mycroft had been convinced that his father was not dead but merely lost and hidden within his journals would be some secret clue to his whereabouts that only Mycroft would be able to decipher.
'That's a crap excuse', she responded.
Looking at them now he wondered how he could ever have seen anything besides what it truly was. Just a pile of old stones. A warm orange glow over them as the sun steadily rose from behind the horizon.
“Look”, Finn says, “I made a promise and besides.....he has a right to know. He knows part of it already. You told him yourself. After all he's been through he deserves to know the truth. He's proven himself to be a worthy ally.......saved your life.”
Why is he so nervous.
Ah, now this is more familiar territory at least. Sherlock takes a sip from his tea. The liquid is only lukewarm. Evidently his step-mother has been waiting here for him for quite a while.
it's Holmes' magic calling out to him.
“Have you ever been in a relationship before?”, he says.
The man had been pretty much chomping at the bit.
I don't know what to say.
“You'll be fine”, Sherlock says. And he means it. John has made great progress. He's gone from butchering Shakespeare to being perfectly adequate. Sherlock is actually a bit proud of him.
He is looking at me again with his signature toothy grin. As if nothing has happened. As if my whole world hasn't just shifted into new and unfamiliar territory.
Neither of them has spoken for what feels like a very long time.
What John will do then.
As he reaches him John stretches out his hand and runs his fingers through Holmes' curls. His hair is a mess and slightly sweaty.
John giggles again and Sherlock actually chuckles.
For a moment I think he is going to touch me but he doesn't. He just stands there looking forlorn and lost....It takes my hazy mind an embarrassingly long time to give meaning to these strings of words he offers up to me but then I think I get it.
But we got there in the end.
He looks out at the quickly darkening night around them and for a long moment she thinks he is not going to say anything else. That he is going to leave it like that.
Sherlock exhales.
She smiles and blushes a bit as she twists the end of her braid between her fingers.
There is a trail of strange, now luminious, footsteps that leads away from the body and towards the stuffy darkness of the house ahead.
As my mother closes the door behind him I manage to get a good look at him:
John gives a small chuckle and Sherlock feels as if he is on fire once more.
If he really does plan on doing this.
***********************************************************************************************
Patrick's house is a rather unimpressive house in the middle of the street.
To be honest: I'm not really sure if I like this chapter or not. It kept changing as I was writing it. I'm not sure what happened. But...it is what it is.....
Master Holmes had said “first thing in the morning”, hadn't he? Confused, John took in the darkness around him. It was decidedly not morning yet.
For now I will let the chapters unfold the way they are supposed to until the story reaches its inevitable end.
He is waiting until he can either use it for his own or make sure that nobody else can.
Should he still walk up to their table and sit down as he usually does?
“Can I sit with you?”, she asks.
The sound of the fire dying out behind them the last thing they heard before an otherworldly mist swallowed them.
This was not a story in a book.
# In the ballad Janet and Tam Lin sleep together on their first meeting. This is kind of Tam Lin's thing:
I just want to go, hide my head underneath the covers and cry.
There is something that's holding him back.
It never felt the way it felt when he was with Sherlock.
Watson seems to be able to pull the magic out of everything around him and make it do extraordinary things.
I cast my eyes down again guiltily.
Who even would be?
“I find that very hard to believe, Sherlock.”
“can I sit here?”
Actually making him feel lighter....relieved......good?
One moment he seemed to be the proper lord most people took him for, on another occasion he came across as a daring adventurer or a faerie prince, as it turned out he also seemed to be a mysterious magician, but then there were also these moments where he seemed frail and unsure.
He's silent for a while before he answers.
He can almost feel the sun on his face and he can almost smell the wildflowers around him.
From the corner of his eye he can still see the dark and handsome stranger. He's got his back towards John now. The view is spectacular. The muscles of his back in full view as his t-shirt is pulled tight as he rolls his shoulders to the rhythm. And then there's his backside....enveloped in dark, tight jeans...... John wishes he could look at him more directly. He wishes he didn't feel like such a creep doing it.
Evidently John is picking up a habit of swearing in the army.
He seems relieved.
All they need to do is take the next step, the correct step, only....Sherlock doesn't know what that step is. He doesn't even know if John knows.....if John even wants what he wants......he wishes he knew what John wants....but.....he is afraid to ask.
They were all lowly magical creatures. Creatures held at bay easily if you wore the right protection.
But right now it is still the dead of night.
Sherlock flops himself down in the chair opposite Finn with a heavy sigh. If he's sitting down at least he'll stop himself from packing anything else. Finn will keep on talking to him regardless of what he's doing. He has come to terms with that fact many, many years ago.
He silently wishes for Finn to come back soon and explain this whole mess.
Sherlock sighs. Audibly. He doesn't care if John hears it. John sighs as well.
Well then.....that's that.....he supposes.....
Of what John is willing to offer him.
But also something else.
The first thing he did then was close and secure the barn doors to keep the wintery cold out once again. After that he retrieved a pitcher of water from his room and some pieces of cloth and set to work.
“You're completely dry”, he says.
She blinks a couple of times in rapid succession again before she replies.
His grip onto Sherlock where they still lay on the frozen soil so tight that that his knuckles turned white and he could feel the firm and familiar muscles underneath the layers of clothing.
Let's hope it will be a satisfying one.....
That would be nice.
There's a warning in his voice. A warning not to push the matter any further. Not to make him go somewhere where he doesn't want to go. And I understand that, I do......Lord knows I do.....but I also worry. And I just need to know what happened so that maybe....I can worry a little bit less.
Maybe one of them would have finally said something had Sebastian not come along, but, honestly, John wasn't even sure what that “something” was.
'So you said.'
And there are still things that hang in the balance.
When he wakes up again the room is flooded with the light of day, outside the window he can hear the chattering of birds, the bed beside him is empty and cold. On the pillow is a note in familiar handwriting.
He wouldn't put it past him at this point.
“And that's precisely why you're losing at cards.”
John laughed again. Softer this time, so as not to frighten it again.
'Somewhere that's not hanging out with us? Must be a girl, right?' Gregs comment was met with some chuckles from their teammates that were close enough to overhear their conversation and Johns face turned just a tiny bit red as he zipped up his bag.
Gently waking up beside him.
It seems to do the trick.
Magic tonight is a beautiful contradiction with hair like the sun and eyes like the sea at night.
“If you need my help with anything..... “
What was he thinking....agreeing to Holmes' request to get him new clothes....
To John it had always seemed as if his mother blamed him for his father's death. Maybe it had been because he had been the one to find him. The one to break the news. As if, if he hadn't screamed and cried, if he hadn't seen, nobody would have and so, in a way, it would not have been true.
John waited for another reply, but nothing came. Eventually he got tired of waiting and realizing he could no longer delay the inevitable he placed his phone underneath his pillow, that way the vibration would wake him up if Sherlock did text back, and tried to sleep.
Or hallucinating.
Of who he is.
I just wish the route towards this point had been an easier one.
'Congratulations.'
The answer had been soft but resolute. Leaving no room for doubt.
Keeping his eyes on Miss Astley and her group he leans in closer to Holmes still.
Little does she know...
This question was not the true question. It was leading up to the question his father really wanted to ask and John was pretty sure he wasn't going to like it.
He kisses me again.
Could Sherlock be any more adorable right now.
That day will always be a sad day. Whenever Sherlock visits it in his mind there is a hint of blue covering the memory like a shroud.
Sherlock feels his muscles tensing up as Watson cleverly strokes them both at the same time.
I can't see that sad smile return to her face.
Mary's eyes are firmly fixed on the floor and John actually feels a bit sorry for her.
“Possibly”, he says.
Once Molly's aunt receives the letter he expects her to leave within a day. Once he's sure she has left Molly Hooper behind he will send for Holmes and Watson to join him here.
He gagged again.
He knows his heart has been breaking for a long time. Because, why else would it hurt so bad.
For a moment Sherlock is puzzled as to what he is supposed to feel. There are so many sensations there. The texture of John's skin, the soft dusting of hairs that covers it, the warmth of the living body underneath that he so adores....the.......and then he does feel it:
John.
“Now what makes you think that, darling?”
Never dying, never aging. Always alone.
He has his ways of seducing gullible men to sleep with him.
And then there were his lips. Full lips shaped into a lovely Cupid's bow, slightly parted as Holmes breathed calmly through them. He appeared to be fast asleep now. He had an elegant but otherworldly fairy-like grace to his features. The effect only slightly ruined by the unkempt mop of dark curls that grew on top of his head and framed his face.
'No.'
His hard cock brushes against mine and it's like nothing I've ever felt before.
I appreciate him trying to help me but I'm afraid I am probably beyond help at this point.
The look on Sherlock's face softened instantly upon hearing John's words.
John put his name in his phone. Last name and all. And looking at the number it doesn't even seem to be a fake number either.
Not when they were both drunk and Watson was still under his employment.
John just raises an eyebrow as he crosses his arms and the pose makes him look so authoritarian that Sherlock temporarily forgets his own name.
When I hazard a glance at Andrew the mirth on his face has made way for concern.
John tastes like a future....
John remembers that same innocent looking curve as it had stretched around his cock last night.
Cooling him down.
Sherlock squints his eyes at him. Willing him to leave.
Who is he even to Sherlock.
Sherlock feels warm. Too warm. He feels as if he needs a shower too. And then he thinks about John and showers. And feels even warmer. He can't look John in the eyes anymore. He just can't. He stares down at his feet. At the grass beneath them.
Greg is smiling.
And then, suddenly, a warm and gentle hand is on her free arm. The soldier is standing beside her. He has used the spectacle of Sherlock's magic to get close unnoticed. The sheer look of horror on Sherlock's face tells her this is not a plan they discussed beforehand.
I find I really don't care because John's hand that's not currently already wrapped around me finds its way to where my own arm lays on the armrest between our seats.
Slowly John turns himself around to see who this late visitor is. He has no control over his movements. It's as if a force outside of himself is moving him. Turning him around. The pull of a magnet. A force of nature. The eye of the storm.
I need him to be gentle and sure and full of light and I need him to tell me that everything will be alright.
'Thank you', he said and it truly sounded like he meant it, 'I will cherish it forever.'
A  moment of silence. 'Just Sherlock?'
He just sighed again and followed his mother to the car.
A very old map. One of the last maps Mycroft had been looking at before he disappeared.
Her face is pale and she looks.....scared......beneath the worried lines of her features John thinks he still sees something he hasn't seen there in a long time.
The one that reaches his eyes and lights them up like stars in a private galaxy.
“Are you coming to read lines again after our next class?” John asks and the weight on Sherlock's chest lifts even further. Not the end after all then.
This new room looks very, very interesting.
ever think this was a good idea?
The flames crackle and dance just as they have been doing all evening.
He had been sure then.
What use is immortality if one must go it alone?
Sherlock doesn't seem to care.
She probably is.
There's the sound of shoes on linoleum floors.
“God...missed you so much.....”
“Come on, John!”, he says and then he is moving again.
So in the end he just opts for the truth and hopes it'll satiate his brother for the time being.
He can sense it.
It's better this way.
This time the smile Watson gives him is more sincere. He leans down over the bed and gives Sherlock one last, far too chaste, kiss.
He must look a mess.
But he hadn't been able to even catch so much as a glimpse of Holmes all morning. And then morning turned into afternoon and still.....no Holmes.
************************************************************************************
****************************
Rugby John is, at the moment, talking to Molly and Shaun. His smile one he wears oh so easily. His stance calm and relaxed as his hips are slightly tilted to the left and his hands gesture wildly as he tells some kind of riveting story that seems to have Molly enthralled.
Morgana is ecstatic.
It seems to calm him down just a bit.
Like.....insanely pretty.
The movie is already halfway over and Sherlock realizes he's not really been paying attention to any of it.
And now with John out of his life.....
I realize I should have done a better job at letting him know there is not a world where he will ever lose me, not unless that's something he wants.
As it turns out Lord Huntington also has five sons. Two of them are unmarried and one of those unmarried sons will also be attending today.
She thinks she hides it well but she does not know who she is trying to hide it from.
“Because you kissed another girl and I didn't get mad at you for it.”
He hasn't seen John in a little bit over a year either. The last time they actually spoke even longer ago.
A yearning in the pit of his stomach.
“He died of cancer”, I say, “and in the end, when he got really really sick he was in the hospital. At that point he had lost all of his hair and most of his weight. I'd never seen him that skinny....or pale. They had him hooked up to all kinds of machines to help him breathe and to give him pain medication. He knew he was dying and he had asked for us all so he would be able to say goodbye......but I......I couldn't......I was scared........I hid so nobody could find me.......I didn't want that to be the last memory I had of him.....I just couldn't.....I....I don't do well with endings......or goodbye's.....and I never let my dad say goodbye to me and I will never be able to go back and change it......I......”
If John was just here to clear his conscience he's pretty sure he would have caught on by now.
“I'm glad you came”, he says, “I wasn't sure if you'd seen my text and.....”
“I was thinking”, he says again, “that I might join the army.”
No........
He wasn't quite ready yet for their story to end.
“Well....we can't all be Lords....lounging around all day long.”
So he had been sure sleep would descend upon him quickly when he crawled into his bed shortly after.
He doesn't want to be here. He  needs air. He can't breathe.
He finds he doesn't really care at the moment.
'I know a man who lives a small bit to the north', the shark said, smirk widening, 'he knows how to get rid of unwanted pregnancies.
Carefully Sherlock sat down again and without hesitation John put his head back on his shoulder. Sherlock didn't seem to mind.
Once again his hand is in John's. The first two fingers of John's right hand have softly wrapped themselves around the first two fingers of his left.
It had been awkward and strange and yet also......
The night-nurse visits him again.
But after a quick wipe-down John does pull me back into bed and I follow him willingly.
He can't think of a single thing to say to these boys.
“Now, was that so hard?” Watson says.
I gasp for breath as he flops down on the bed beside me rather unelegantly. He drapes his arm across my chest and kisses the corner of my mouth.
He wants to do it again.
“None of your business”, he just says and tries to leave again but finds he can't because Sebastian is holding the door closed.
He wants to kiss John.
By the age of eighteen Mycroft had already had several job opportunities lined up for him and so he had picked the one that seemed the most profitable. It just so happened to bring them from London to rural Indiana.
And now, whenever I close my eyes, all I can see is that last look he gave me.
It's just jeans and a black shirt but it somehow feels like a victory.
Social interactions come so easy to him.
Mycroft had smiled a little bit more sincerely then as he ruffled Sherlock's hair.
'I highly doubt that's the correct answer either', Sherlock was smirking and John felt his face getting warmer still, 'something on your mind, John?'
Sherlock's lips are already parted slightly and John kisses them both separately. First the top and then the bottom lip.
I give Molly a sort of shrug and a groan.
I feel the corners of my mouth curl up involuntarily.
It was the only place he felt safe.
“Finn isn't here right now”, Holmes says.
I just nod and give her a stammered reply:
Slowly Wallace lent forward and as he placed his too big and too wet hands on the armrests on either side of John's body he felt as if he was being smothered.
Maybe he should go to Molly Hooper first......but.....then again......he's never shied away from a challenge and......if he's being honest with himself, angry or not, he would very much like to see John Watson again.
He shakes his head to rid himself of the memories of that night.
He just can't do that again.
Things had been better at this new school. Keeping his fathers death a secret he had just been “
Magic gravitates towards him.
He kisses Sherlock again.
“I couldn't find you this morning. Where were you?”
Had told him that this had been what I had wanted with him from the moment he first said hello to me. From the moment he gave me my first awkward kiss. From the moment we spent an entire night on the beach star-gazing and swam out into the sea in the dark only to return out of breath but very much in love.
Why has Rugby John just waltzed into Drama Club like he owns the place?
John just shrugs as his smile widens.
'We had a bit of a falling out', was what he ended up saying.
John was silent for a while, his mouth still opened in disbelief as Holmes cleared his throat and peered into the oncoming dawn surrounding them now, his breath forming small clouds in the early morning air.
And John will never feel the same. John is straight. Very straight.
“Good morning, John.”
Watson lights the candles in the room and the fire in the fireplace.
'Just see that it doesn't happen again', Holmes' haughty reply, but there was a definite teasing tone underneath.
Time and time again.
Yet another thing that reminds him of Sherlock.
“There's a rumor.....”
Sherlock brushes past his brother, up the stairs and to his room. Mycroft lets him go.
They have an armour around them built up out of years of sarcasm and spite. If it were to crack now who knows what kind of emotions would come flooding back out.
I want to be happy that he's here but it doesn't feel right.
She shakes her head wistfully.
'Jesus Christ!' John exclaimed. The shock of the encounter temporarily making him forget his place and who he was talking to.
Enough magic to fill the world outside and overflow into this prison that She made for him.
John is on top of him now.
Sherlock is pretty sure he would have died too if he had been placed in foster care.
And so I untangle our hands and place myself in his lap. My knees on the bed on either side of his thighs. Our chests pressed together. I wrap him up in my arms and I kiss him.
They reach Holmes Manor a little after midnight and while John tends to the horses Holmes stands in the corner of the stables and just looks at him.
He hopes it will arrive soon.
Fading watermarks that serve as proof of John's wanting for me.
The wallpaper not inanimate, as it had first appeared, but soft flesh lining the body of a living creature. Torn in several places, made visible as a gentle glow illuminated the hallway he apparently found himself in.
'Don't I always?'
******************************************************
In the end he only takes off his boots and jacket and lays himself down on his bed on his right side, his body facing the wall.
And as the baritone rumble of Sherlocks chuckles reached him, for the briefest of moments, Johns stomach did that strange, unknown thing again.
“What......like what?”
Once again he focuses all his attention on the slippery fog veiling what he is desperately trying to recall.
But I have no idea what he wants. If he sees any future in this 'thing' we've got going on.
John shrugs.
He cannot deny John anything. Being with John will hurt him but he is also weak. Now that he has John close-by again he finds he suddenly craves him. It's as if he has been lost in a desert for years and now that he has finally found water he cannot stop drinking. Even knowing full well that the pond is poisoned.
Seeing what he wants and can't possibly ever have on a daily basis is slowly killing him from the inside out.
Watson is still wearing the medallion. He can see a small part of the chain peaking out above the collar of his shirt.
“Boys.....”, she mutters under her breath, “you need to tell me more, Sherlock. You know I live vicariously through you now that Greg is still ignoring me. Did he kiss you again?”
A world without John Watson is not one he wants to live in.
Whenever John caught it a warmth completely unrelated to the fire ignited inside his chest.
They stood like this for quite some time. Neither of them speaking. It was Mary who finally broke the silence, her voice slightly muffled as she still had her face buried in Johns chest.
If only he had just had the courage to ask him.....if only.......
There are two empty seats at the rugby-table this time.
The next morning John did not feel any better. The events of the night before plagued his mind and when he recalled the look on Mary's face after he pulled away from their kiss he was once again filled with red, hot shame.
“It sounded like a scream”, Holmes says. His voice hoarse and gruff and still full of sleep.
He hoped his father had finally given in to his sons desperate pleas out of some shred of human decency, but he rather suspected the man was just trying a different tactic on him. After over two months of incarceration and detachment maybe he had realized this was getting him nowhere and now he was trying to see how far flattery and bribery were going to get him.
The jacket is formfitting, showing of the muscles in his chest and shoulders and the shape of his waist, and the colour complements the blue of his eyes. He has never seen himself looking quite like this before.
For a second my heart and chest heat up with unfounded hope but then I realize Andrew now has my number too.
Also: comments are always appreciated.
“What?” he says.
Slowly Sherlock lent down and as his tongue now traced the lines where his fingers had been moments before John closed his eyes and sighed. The uncomfortable and near painful feeling from before now subsiding and being replaced by another warmth. A lustful fire of pure want. He wanted Sherlock. He wanted every inch of him. All around him. Inside him. He wanted their bodies to melt together and never be apart again. He wanted to say this, but the feeling of Sherlock's tongue tracing a languid path along his skin clouded over his mind and tore any coherent thought to shreds so instead he just placed his hands on the alpha's face. Softly. Gently.
He finds himself smiling at the memories of happier times but when he realizes what he's doing he just groans and rubs his eyes.
As John seems to reach the natural conclusion of his tale Molly giggles, Shaun claps him on the shoulder.
Molly is happy for them.
I have no desire to be alone with my thoughts right now.
John is sitting down at the side-line of the rugby-field and he has taken a picture of his legs as he stretches them out in front of him. The sky is dark and it's raining. You can just barely see a hint of his rugby-shorts and his skin is stained with mud and grass as the strong muscles of his thighs and calves positively glisten.
He didn't know.
The air smells like a lake and John has trouble seeing past the next pair of trees as heavenly water streams from his hair and lashes into his eyes.
That sense of purpose.
This.......
They seem to enjoy each others company no matter what.
And it's all John's fault.
This chapter just practically wrote itself.
They make it look so easy.
John had thought long and hard about asking Sherlock to come with him to this party. He knew how Sherlock felt about parties and about the people who went to them. But after finding out he was quite probably Sherlock's only friend his heart had broken just a little bit and he had vowed to himself to try and make his other friends see how amazing Sherlock actually was once you got to know him.
And then John Watson had come along.
Blue skies on a summer's day.
As long as he is in here and she is out there.
Both girls giggle and bat their eyes while he nods at them politely.
This is an outcome neither of them had thought of as even remotely possible.
