Dean looks furious, steam practically trailing from his ears, “What the hell are you-“
“Hey, can we -uh – take five?” Dean interrupts Cas’ train of thought and flashes a fake smile. He glares at Cas and Sam. Gestures to the library, he grits his teeth, “Over there. Now.”
Cas creases his brows in confusion, “Dean?”
“Dean I warned you not to go on a case, you could have hurt yourself or the baby.” Cas’ voice cuts in, gravely with restrained anger. Great, he’s on speaker.
Sam sighs, “What are you going to do with it?”
The unhappy churning starts to rise in Dean’s throat causing him to hold back a gag. He pulls away, making Cas stir.
“I’ve been researching a case.” Sam replies as Dean carefully slices his banana. The younger Winchester squints, “What are you making?”
He finally blinks, “At 2am?”
Dean walks far enough away from the kitchen that he is sure that Sam can’t hear the two of them. His hands bawl into tight fists and he pants, trying to conjure the words. Cas’ eyes squint, calculating.
“For now?” How do they not realise how insane they sound? “But what happens when he-what if he-“ This is too much, Dean can feel panic ebb in his chest. What if lucifer gets to the Nephilim? Will he hurt it? Kill it? He pales slightly at the thought. Cas places a hand on the small of his back. He hovers his head over Dean’s shoulder.
“I haven’t tried to hide my love from you Dean. I thought you had known, hence the advancing of our relationship 2 months ago. I consented.” He faces Dean fully, his voice holding the same tone as always, but a smile is present on his features.
.” The word sounds poisonous.
And with that, the phone goes dead. He and Cas aren’t really the type of couple to talk over the phone for hours on end. Before everything happened, phone calls were only in the case of emergency. His partner is an angel for God’s sake. When you’ve got someone who can fly, you don’t need to be using up your minutes.
Cas sighs heavily. Humanity is a very complex concept to wrap one’s head around.
Sam nods and promptly heads out of the room, noticing the longing looks being exchanged, “I’m gonna go check on where Rowena’s at.” He adds weakly as he walks out the door.
“No problem.” Cas talks for the first time, beaming at her.
They stay like that for moment. Cas rubbing Dean back with one hand while the other stays firmly on his stomach. He mutters some kind words of sympathy as Dean just melts further into the stool. Which is growing increasingly more uncomfortable.
Sam looks over to Lucifer, and then back to Dean with a sigh, “We can find a loop hole Dean, we always have. We have a chance to keep you safe and Cas won’t have to go. It’s a win at least for now.”
Cas crosses the room to Dean’s side, placing a hand on his shoulder, “I will do everything in my power to protect them.” He takes a beat, “The angels can’t detect you. We just need to be more careful now that they are taking more notice.”
After the initial shock and insanity of it all blew over somewhat, Sam had started to pace the length of the infirmary. Mumbling his incoherent thoughts under his breath while pinching the bridge of his nose.
Dean pales at that.
“Dean? Are you alright?” Dean doesn’t answer as Cas’ grip loosens and he is free to run to the bathroom. He kneels over the toilet seat and heaves what little food he has had in the last 24 hours. Moments pass and he hears a set of footsteps approaching. The footsteps stop as a figure silently kneels beside him. Cas rubs circles on the small of Dean’s back and hums lowly.
“I gotta tap a kidney first and then I’ll help. Kid’s jacking up my bladder.” Dean grumbles, getting up with a wince.  Sam cringes in sympathy as he watches his brother walk – well, it’s evolving into a heavy plod - out the entrance. “Don’t have too much fun without me!” He calls out behind him.
That is all. Happy reading!
“I’m glad.” Cas’ sincerity makes Dean’s stomach drop a little. The same sinking feeling when he would sneak out at night and John would ask questions about where he had been. His cheeks flush hot before Cas speaks again, “What are you doing?”
“God damn it.” Dean huffs, pulling his shirt down, “I’ve found a case.” He says to the empty room. His thoughts are fractured, torn between whether he should go on the case he had found that morning. A string of disappearances after multiple people reporting a ghost at a shipping warehouse in Lexington, Nebraska. It’s a simple case: find the body, salt, and burn it. Dean would be in and out of the warehouse by the end of the day. But that’s why he is standing in the mirror in the first place. To persuade himself to
Cas nods slowly and gestures for Sam to take him to Dean.
Dean sighs, “Son of a bitch.”
“Thank you so much for your help ma’am.” Dean promptly nods her off and heads out the door with a huff.
“Unfortunately it is one of the “joys of pregnancy”.” Cas uses air quotes, cracking a weak smile from Dean, “Although I don’t understand what could possibly be joyous about morning sickness.”
“Hey hot stuff.” He tries to sound smooth, but it comes out breathless from the short walk.
Standing in the library, Cas can’t will himself to move any further. A person he knows all too well stands confidently at the base of the stairs, considering their surroundings. Her back is to Cas, but he knows she can sense his presence in the room. His face furrows into a deep frown.
Dean’s face warms but his heart wrenches at the thought of how he left Cas the morning after. He was cold and unrelenting, pushing his fear and repression onto Cas. “I’m sorry for making you go.”
“Looks like you got your appetite back?”
“I’m fine,” Dean waves him off and heads towards the counter, “here, let me help.”
Dean eyes Sam’s beer enviously, as he brings it to his lips. Sam just offers a cheeky wink.
“That’s good. We’ve still got an hour left, if you wanna leave man-“
As quickly as the voices had entered, they fled. Leaving the angel defenceless on a park bench. He sighed heavily, “Damn it.”
He wasn’t in the bathroom long and soon is waddling his way back to the dean cave. The movie is still playing, Cas watching intently. He then looks up as he hears him enter the room. “Are you still in pain?”
“Thank you for your time sheriff. And we were also wondering if-“
Sam can’t help but smile at the weird family that they’ve become. With Dean so close to his due date, it won’t just be the three of them soon. They will have a baby to look after. Sam can picture a little version of both Dean and Cas running wildly around the bunker. Although, they haven’t found out the gender of the child, Sam hopes it’s a little girl. Then they would really have the whole ‘three men and a baby’ vibe going on. But, whatever those two dorks have he’ll be happy. Happy to be an uncle to his niece or nephew and definitely spoil them rotten.
“Agent. I think we better get a move on to the morgue.” Sam quickly interjects, clapping Cas’ back. “Thank you so much for your time Sheriff.” The two of them get up from their chairs. The sheriff nods them off. “And congratulations by the way!” He calls out awkwardly over his shoulder.
“No, you didn’t.” Dean sighs, “It’s been 8 years since we first met you and you think I hadn’t thought about it? I just finally had the guts to say something, and you… did it.” Dean’s gaze hasn’t left’s Cas’ as the angel considers the comment.
“It takes pretty damn good too.” Dean muses, after taking a spoonful to his lips. Sam shakes his head with a small chuckle. “But -uh- what kinda case are you looking at?”
“I find it very interesting.” His breath gently touching Dean’s neck as he speaks. Dean can barely handle it. His whole-body melts against the warmth of the embrace. It’s comforting and insatiable. He rolls his eyes,
happening.” He echoes, his other hand absently pulling the hem of Dean’s shirt up to rest on his abdomen. It’s only a small bump that cups perfectly in his palm. Dean groans in protest at the sentiment, but, feeling too defeated, he just leaves the angel be.
Sam clears his throat, “You’re -uh- starting to look
find the angel that caused this earthly disruption Castiel?” Naomi warns, “Or has your time here clouded your judgement?”
Dean is only getting closer to his due date, meaning that their Winchester luck is kicking back in with a vengeance. But first, a pregnant Dean has to have a few cute moments.
Rowena’s face softens into a saddened sympathy, “There you are. Was that so hard Dean?”
Lucifer lets out a contented breath, “Awesome. You know, this is just-“
Boy this is taking a long time to write! I'm trying to get a bit quicker, but life is wriggling it's way in between. Sorry for the long wait, but I hope you enjoyed this very cracky chapter!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who is Juno?” Cas tilts his head to the side, squinting.
Cas leans down closer to Dean, “You alright?” He whispers against his temple, as not to disturb Sam and Rowena’s chattering.
“Nebraska.” Dean tries to reply coolly, but the pain in his lower stomach is wrenching him.
That night, although blurry, still flashes harshly in his mind and only made him dizzy when he thought about it. Did he like Cas? Sure, he was Dean’s best friend, and they know each other better than anyone. But the feelings that bloom in his chest when thinking about Cas are.
Cas’ stance narrows into Dean’s frame, he places a hand on his abdomen silently. Propping his hunter up on the wall, Cas makes sure he is safe. There is an element of softness and calm to his movements. Eyes closing and light emitting from his palm. He moves them closer together by cupping the back of Dean’s head to touch their foreheads. Dean leans into the familiar warmth of skin. He pants heavily, tears feely flowing down his cheeks. It takes a beat, but Dean realises that he can
Dean slowly walks back into the kitchen and is met with a confused Sam, “What was that about? Where’s Cas?”
As calm as he can, Sam pulls out his phone to press Dean’s contact. With Cas’ curious gaze, Sam rings Dean.
I'm too excited with this story! So I'm posting another chapter! Don't expect this kind of upload schedule for the rest of the fic, but I'll try the best I can. I'm really enjoying writing this and I hope y'all enjoy this chapter! (because I had a lot of fun writing it!) :)
Dean walks into the kitchen slowly, the dizziness of his previous battle against his stomach still making his vision swim. Sam squints at the older Winchester brother, he looks pale and clammy as he slowly brews his coffee.
“About that the three of us have your back but how are you going to explain Mom not knowing she has been back for a couple of years.” Sam tried to be the voice of reason.
Which was almost the same thing and yet not at all. The next screw up was when Cas started speaking about how he hadn’t repaid Jack and how he felt like he had failed him. When he decided he was probably brought back to help prepare for war.
The salt and burn went off perfectly and they stuck  around another half a day to make sure everything was good before they headed back to the bunker.
“Dean I meant every word. Trust me when I say I know you better than Sam, I’ve seen your memories, I’ve seen your soul, I rebuilt you. I know every mistake you’ve made and all the good. I love you and I will always love you.”  Cas looked so earnest, Dean could think of nothing to say in return.
Which was why John had gotten up early this morning and was making his way through the bunker to Dean’s room.
What was necessary was protecting family no matter what and hunting all creatures and demons.
Now I had the easy option were I just let him go on his soldier warpath and it probably wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing there was no place for feeling in war but it would most certainly end with either him Sam or me making some stupid decision or sacrifice because that was exactly what always happened every damn freaking time.
”But why lie and say we are together. Why not tell the truth and tell him about the “Monsters” you have slept with?” Cas questioned confused, and bringing up a valid point. It wasn’t like Dean would have to lie, he had slept with ‘monsters’
And yet did you tell any of this to Castiel when he was suffering to work out why he was brought back. When he decided the reason must be to be another player in this new mess the Winchester’s have landed them in.
“Excuse me this room is a masterpiece.” Dean defended, turning around in his chair to see that Sam had brought Jack and Rowena with him. “Is there a reason why you are all here?”
“Of course not, but no one said you had to fake date Cas, no one said you have to kiss him. Those ideas were all yours Dean, ever think why that’s where your brain keeps going?:” Teased Sam.
But sliding in behind the wheel and taking Baby out on the open road, was healthier than drinking until he passed out.
Which meant he needed to think.
He has chosen you time and time again over all of his brothers and sisters.
Dean couldn’t help himself from commenting after all that “If you think all that is truly unbelievable and a lot for three humans and an Angel and a Demon to go through.I  don’t want to burst your bubbles but this is really just the beginning it get’s a lot more unbelievable from here.”
Idiots who hide behind labels that don’t do you justice, brothers you certainly aren't that are you. Buddies, best friends, don’t cover it not even ‘profound bond’ like you say Castiel. No none of those quite sum up the two of you.
“Remind me to never ask you to help me decorate a room Dean.” Rowena was appalled as she took in the room, though she didn’t know what else she could have expected from Dean.
“You nothing, I need to talk to my Son.”
“Because what if Dad doesn’t come around Dean what if this is a deal breaker. Could you live with knowing that you destroyed your relationship with him over something fake. If you truly think it through and you are ready to face the consequences. I'll have you back I always will. But you have to promise me you know this is going to be worth it no matter the outcome.” Sam was incredibly serious and honestly as he spoke it felt like Jack, Rowena and Cas faded from the room and it was just Sam and Dean.
Cas decided not to push and let Dean show him what shows had new episodes and picked something for them to watch.
When they eventually got to Amara, Dean tried to get through that in as few days as possible and happily letting Sam and Rowena tell their parts when possible. Except for Cas letting Lucifer take control,  Dean made sure to tell that part so he could explain Cas's reasoning and defend him.
A simple salt and burn case popped up on their radar and Dean was itching for a hunt so he offered to go, Sam deciding to go with him.
“It’s nice to meet you Mr Winchester.” Greeted Jack happily offering his hand for John to shake.
I would like to really stress I hate this ending or the show. I think Dean ending up in Heaven is terrible. I think he could have easily found happiness on earth. But I am just trying to make a better ending with what we were given.
Before John could when really process what Dean was saying, he had stood up grabbing Cas arm as he went to drag him along so they could disappear again.
“Like you would have shot me Dean, but I am glad to see you haven’t forgotten everything I taught you.” Dean just rolled his eyes at his father's cockiness. It would have served him right if Dean had shot at him. .
Positive - He went out doing what he knew.
Dean turned the volume up and just drove trying to focus on the music. Before he let the anger fully overtake him. He didn’t know how much time had passed but eventually, he was able to breathe slightly.
Rowena and Sam were a perfect pair. They both loved knowledge, they both felt more in control with the more knowledge they had. So it was no surprise they were often hauled up together in the library.
“Don’t tempt me. But it’s probably better to just get it over with.” Years of dealing with his father told Dean that it was worse in the long run if he tried to delay it.
Once Sam had gotten the green light from Dean on the headquarter plans, he had gotten Rowena to fill Cas in and get his go ahead. So as soon as they got back to the bunker Sam shut himself away with half a dozen notebooks saying he wanted to finish working everything out so they could get it up and running. All this organising and notes were right up Sam’s lane and Dean was perfectly happy to leave him to it himself.
But Cas, Cas not only didn’t seem to mind, he welcomed it he never seemed put out by Dean and his neediness.
Dean had understood Cas’ reason, he understood why it was so important to him. That it meant Cas would finally feel like he could start to forgive himself for his mistakes that had helped lead to the almost extinction of Angels. Something Dean had been aware weighed heavily on Cas every day. Plus for extra bonus points Cas had actually let Dean know in advance his plan for once, not just taking off without notice.
Yet all he has ever done since he raised you from perdition, has been done to keep you safe or to keep you happy. I know he never told you that when Naomi was controlling him that he had to kill hundreds of you and I’m not exaggerating here Dean remember I've seen into both your memories.I'm only speaking the truth as you both think it. Naomi, she tortured and reprogrammed Castiel until he eventually gave in and was able to do it effortlessly kill each copy of you quicker and withstand whatever it said to him.
“Believe me Rowena I know my father it isn’t going to take anything more than the way Cas and I are usually, and us saying we are a couple for him to believe us. Plus with you Sam and Jack backing us up it will all be good.” Dean knew John he would even see things that weren’t there to believe what he wanted to believe.
This couldn’t be it. He may have been accepting in front of Sam. But how is this how it ends No it can’t be? The bloodsuckers knocked him out and he hallucinated his death and his goodbye with Sammy as he was dying.
And enough is enough there is a point were amusing turns into just plain old sad.  The point where there is no other ending than a tragedy.
Now he just needed to try and come up with positives about his stupid death.
“If your father doesn’t realise what an amazing man you are Dean and respect you for the man you have become. That’s his problem and it will be him that will suffer without you in his life. Because you have proven time and time again that you don’t need him. In fact you have become a better man without him in your life.” Cas had reached out and rested his hand on Dean’s arm as he spoke. Causing Dean to look up at Cas  and look him in the eye. So that Cas could clearly get across to Dean that he truly meant every word he was saying. . Even after finishing what he was saying he maintained eye contact with Dean. With Dean being the first to break the eye contact what felt like minutes later.
“Everyone is in agreement then, would you three like to stay and watch Brooklyn NineNine I don’t mind going back to the start of the season do you Dean?” Asked Cas.
The choice is yours.”
He got to just stay in the bunker and coordinate and offer advice and research. Which his body was certainly thankful for.
It wasn’t  just the  hunters from the apocalypse world either. Sam had started to contact and get hunters from their own world to come and mingle and team up to help everyone adjust.
“Sorry Dad can’t do that.” Dean answers standing his ground.
Positive - He saved two young kids' lives.
The two of them had it sorted, and Jack was busy socialising. John and the others were still on their hunt, but making good progress.
“Dean, you don’t have to…” Started Cas.
“I see no reason I wouldn’t be Dean assures me that really we won’t have to act any different to normal as John wouldn’t know any better so I am happy to help Dean.” Casa was quite aware of only some of the horrible things John had put Dean through and yet that was enough to make Cas hate him.
Yet it was certainly easier than the hard option. The one were I go and find Cas right now and be honest with him. Sit down and for the first time in ten years say exactly what I mean to him let everything out and see where that leads. It would be hard and awkward and yet maybe if we were honest with each other and then were honest with Sam and everyone was on the same page for once maybe just maybe we would all make it out of this without screwing up completely without us having to sacrifice ourselves.
Dean was lounging on his bed flicking through the tv channels, while Sam was hunched over a book, with a notebook next to him making notes. And looking up at Dean every few  moments before shaking his head and going back to his writing.  Dean was trying to be patient, but it had been going on for almost half an hour and it was slowly driving him insane.
“So, boys, you’ve been pretty tight lipped about things so I’m looking forward to you finally telling me what’s been happening for the last decade” John started
On one hand he was happy they had helped validate what he had said. On the other sleeping with an Angel was one thing wanting to marry said Angel was another entirely.
The only thing that stopped him admitting the truth was the less  people who knew the better. All he could do was try and reassure her that her guilt was completely misguided and she need not feel it.
While they still had the network of hunters coming and going. Without John there Dean got to actually enjoy being in his home.  The other seemed to feel the same way.
Cas didn’t think it was weird, it wasn’t like it was completely out of the ordinary. Cas was more likely to relax properly when they watched movies in Dean’s room anyway. Because Dean refused to allow Cas to get on his bed in his full get up shoes and all. It didn’t hurt Cas to put on some comfier clothes occasionally and just vegout. So really it was for Cas benefit.
“Sorry Dad it’s just we have some catching up to do with Jack and Cas as well.” Sam answered, trying to keep the peace. Which was weird for Dean to here, it had always been him trying to keep the peace between Sam and Dad.
Dean hadn't actually realised how long they had gone without hunting until John had realised it, which had shocked him. Not that Sam hadn’t wanted to go, he had managed to give up hunting in the past. But that he was able to pass it up.That he didn't feel he hadn’t felt like he needed to be out there protecting innocent lives.
The only person who Dean knew would be in his corner besides Sam was Cas. Cas, who would not be here while they were telling the stories of their past. Cas, who was finally having an opportunity to feel like he was redeeming himself. So, even though Dean knew that if he prayed to Cas, if he told Cas that he truly needed him here. Cas would be there for Dean without hesitation. He couldn’t do that, he couldn't take this opportunity away from his friend. He was just going to have to suck it up and deal with it. It couldn’t be any worse than the other stuff he had gone through in the last thirteen years.
For starters, there was the whole situation with Mary and John.  2018 Mary and John were practically entirely different people to the two young, Cupid-struck, completely in love pair they had been the last time they had been on Earth together. So, it was putting it lightly to say they had some reconnecting to do. It was made even harder to navigate, because it wasn’t like there were self help books, or couples therapy you could go to that deal with, Cupid’s meddling, death, and resurrection. So it had been a bumpy start reintroducing them to each other. Luckily even without a Cupid interfering they had changed enough, in their time alive without each other, that they were actually getting somewhat along, not madly in love or anything, but forming a mutual respect kind of friendship. For Dean and Sam it was just an incredibly weird situation that neither really wanted to get involved with.
So he was happy to follow Deans lead and go back to their Brooklyn NineNine marathon. At least that was what Dean had wanted to do.
He would have been so disappointed in us for even begrudgingly working with Crowley once. He wouldn’t have understood even though we didn’t trust him it was better the devil you know. Same with Rowena I hated bloody witches and I didn’t trust her for a second but at least we knew her and we knew she was going to backstab us more often then than not we could work with that.
Cas was a bit more subdued not quite knowing what to make of John,  knowing all  the pain he had caused Dean over the years. But still smiled politely and held out his hand to shake following Jacks lead. “Good to meet you John.”
Dean you think that Castiel cares more about the mission and the cause, more about Jack and redeeming himself than he cares about you.
Of course the fact that neither Dean or Sam had gone on a hunt since John had come back, had been just another reason for John to insult his boys. He had tried to force/guilt them into joining him with the vampire nest. But they would rather he think less of them, than be forced to spend any extra time with him.
The more acceptance he got the more he let himself just enjoy life.The more he was willing to help Sam with the hunters and hang out in the main parts of the bunker. He was able to be himself and not have to worry about keeping up the ladies man appearance that had been truthfully unfulfilling  these last few years.
“Easy when she asks I'll just explain we haven’t exactly had a moment without a massive problem until now and I didn’t exactly think it was a big deal and as I didn’t know how she would take it, I was just waiting until we had a moment to actually have a conversation about it.” Dean reasoned back
I heard Cas say to Donatello that he was sorry but he wasn’t going to let Donatello hurt the people Cas loved again.
Dean was kind of glad that Sam had brought the two of them with him, forget what Dad would do to them. Dean didn’t want to imagine what else they would have said to John.
Which did make Dean pause for a second when exactly should this fake relationship have started. It had to be before Mom got resurrected but not too early that it just didn’t make sense with what had happened.
“You deserve a break as well, Yet you don’t seem as relieved and happy as Sam is, with having your Father alive again.” Dean wondered if it was wrong of him to wish that Cas hadn’t learned to read him so well.
“Damn Cas, next time pick a shortcut with a little less thorns, babe” the hunter teased, pushing aside a branch.
There was a loud thud followed by a muted curse and rustling before the door swung violently from its hinges, and a frantic Dean emerged to hold a gun up to the former angel’s face. “Who the hell do you think you are? Cas is-” his voice trembled, even after two weeks he still couldn’t voice it out loud, “Cas is gone.”
Time worked differently in the Empty, he had no way of knowing how long he had been gone on Earth. It could be seconds, days, months, years or eons. So, Cas did the only thing he could to keep himself sane. He thought about that night. Replayed it entirely in his head, using his grace to make sure time in his memory passed just as it had on Earth. It wasn’t perfect, but it allowed him to at least grasp the passage of hours among the dark, bleeding walls of nothing that surrounded him. The mere thought of Jack’s laughter, Dean’s smile or Sam’s brotherly teasing was enough to keep him sane. Enough for now.
“Oh, well I saw them sleeping together yesterday.” Jack quipped. “Dean was on top of Cas and he looked very happy.”
The foliage in front of them was dense, making it harder to walk through. Cas’s shortcut had saved them nearly an hour of walking, but it hadn’t made the trip any easier. A fact that Dean made sure was not lost on his friend.
"Woah, okay I'm guessing Garth had you in another party last night?" She, however, did not wait for an answer as she kept talking, excited about the news she had to bring Dean. "Whatever, so yeah okay Dean. Do you remember that weird guy Lucifer that owned basically a private stadium for car races??"
Dean was hastily rummaging through his wallet when he heard Jack speak up. “What does
“You should get some rest Jack, I can keep looking into this,” Sam said, concern in his eyes.
“What the hell are you?” Dean demanded as he stared at the monster’s glowing blood. She grinned, and tried to take a few steps forward, but hesitated when Dean raised the blade in her direction once again.
’ on TV and thought that the M.O. seemed similar to our case. I decided to see if it was based on any actual legends. Turns out, I was right.” He flips through the tabs in his computer excitedly, showing them the different legends he had found.
poured into a single kiss. The angel sighed into the kiss and the entire moment felt like coming home for the very first time. Every nerve ending collapsed in that moment, short-circuiting Dean’s brain to only register this moment. He felt Cas’s hands caress his back, pulling their bodies closer. There were eleven years worth of words said in just this one moment.
Dean saw the words on the angel’s arm and quickly pulled up his own sleeve. There was an identical set of words underneath his skin. Their eyes met, and silence fell over them. Sam was the first to break it. “Uh, Cas any idea of what that means?” He asked pointing at the words.
Thank you to everyone for finishing this fic with me! This story meant the world to me, and got me through some dark times.
On the other side of the river stood a ghastly woman dressed in white. Her eyes were sunken, framed by ghostly pale skin that was tinged with what looked to be glimmering tears. Her mouth was wide open as she screamed, and she had her arms outstretched around the four remaining children. The children stood perfectly still with their eyes glossed over, seemingly taken over by a trance.
While he walked, he looked up to the night sky and relished at how the stars shone so bright. Science told him that they were simply just giant balls of gas being consumed slowly through space but he always liked his mother's version more. His mother had always insisted that the stars were actually angels watching over him, protecting him. When he had learned in the 6th grade that stars could very much burn out, he couldn't help but wonder if the so called Angels could burn out too.
He remembers that before passing out and hearing the start of their new alliance, the start of Team Free Will, Sam had asked him if he was okay. Cas chuckled. At the time, he had drunkenly responded "Don't ask stupid questions". Banter aside, Sam had always cared - even if he wasn’t particularly open about it -  and he taught Cas many of the emotional things he now knows.
Castiel's eyes widened at the recognition. He struggled to try and understand what the man before him was. As if noticing his inner struggle, the man continued: "Before you go all crazy at me with questions, Yes I am an angel. No, I am not a Cupid but yes, I have your mission"
"Of course you have a place here Cas! You have us! Unless... that's not what you want." Sam's voice got lower as he spoke, almost afraid of the answer.
However, the decision was made for him when the stranger-a tall, slender man sporting a black V-neck and a smirk- wrapped an arm around him and pulled him towards a booth in the back of the bar.
Their monster takes the shape of a woman, has an obsession with children, which she abducts using water-powered mind control… He has ruled out pretty much every monster in his father’s journal and his personal experience.
Tears ran down the sides of his face, his anger slowly leaking out of him along with them. “What have you done, Cas?” he muttered, “what have you fucking done…”
Chapter 1: Coincidence
Cas came up behind them holding their picnic blanket and some of the snacks they had bought. He was currently wrestling against the wind to try and flatten their blanket out over the grass. Dean doubled over laughing at the sight.
He smiled at his memories of his mother, always so fond in his heart. John had not taken her death lightly, consuming his time by hunting and teaching him and Sam how to hunt. Whether it be rabbits or demons, he could kill them all.
As he sped through the dark road, a call came through his phone. Taking his eyes of the road, he never saw the round head lights of the truck approach him. He never saw the impact, only snapping his head up at the sound of a loud crash, shock, pain and then... Silence.
character.  A small part of him expected Cas to be gone by now. He chose to ignore that side.
The former angel had taken off his trenchcoat earlier, complaining that it was too warm. Which meant that he was walking around with a partially unbuttoned, white, dress shirt that was a size too small for him, and black slacks to match. Neither left any room for Dean’s imagination, and soon the sight of his boyfriend walking in front of him had him blushing like a teenager at the prom.
“I know that I am an angel ornament. I have all the power I could ever want or need. But my station at the top is incredibly lonely, Dean.” The angel’s eyes settle in his lap, apparently unable to meet his friend’s eyes anymore. “The only moments that brought me some semblance of true happiness, were the ones when I caught a glimpse of you down below.”
Support Me:
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas grinned, thinking fondly of Dean as he chose his next words carefully, “Then finish this. Make me human, keep my grace here and send everything else back. Send my soul back and be done with me, forever.” He paused, making sure he could meet the entity’s eyes, “Make me someone else’s problem”.
Cas chuckles, “Well, it seems you do know me well enough.”
"Garth, how many times have I told you not to call me th-"
“Call me Mirna, dear,” she quipped as she turned back to work, more coffee orders coming in.
''Hello?" Dean said grogily to his brother but frowned when he heard his brother crying. ''Sammy what happened?'' The silence made him tense and a number of things passed through his mind. His father, had he finally drowned himself alchohol? Or had Jess... His brother interrupted him with a laugh.
The Winchesters spent the rest of the day together and at peace. An experience they hadn’t shared for a long time, and never thought they would have again. After their family hug, and after Dean had showered, they decided to go out for breakfast at a nearby diner. As they sat at the round table near the back of the establishment, Cas found himself unable to stop smiling. Jack was fighting with Sam about how many pancakes he should order, trying to convince him that his nephilim state meant that he could order enough for two people. So far, his logic had not been able to convince the long-haired, health-conscious hunter.
Dean and Cas were bickering over who got to carry what out of the car. Sam simply rolled his eyes and started looking for a spot in the grass that they could claim as their own. He patted Jack on the shoulder and led him down the green slope, towards a patch of grass near the middle that was far enough away from the rest of the families. Jack had never seen the ocean so close before. The ancient walls of the Spanish fort had slowly eroded away and created a makeshift horizon that separated the sky from the sea. The boy could smell the sea salt in the air, and he took a deep breath. He hoped that it would stay in his lungs forever.
Jack sits opposite his father, cradling the pajamas in his lap. “When was the last time?” He is staring at his lap, pensive. “The last time he was happy with someone?”
Dean looked nervously towards where the young guy had disappeared. He was a little on edge after hearing her scream, but when nothing exploded, he decided to ignore that part of his brain. He shook his head, and she went back to preparing the cups of coffee.
“It can only be killed with a sword dipped in the blood of pure devotion.” Sam finishes, leaning back in his chair, running his hands through his hair.
Cas hesitated, playing with the frayed end of his trench coat. The brothers did not know about the deal he had made, not entirely. He didn’t want to worry his family, especially not after they had just gotten their son back with ‘no strings attached’. It was best if they continued to see it that way. The angel took a deep breath  and met the hunter’s eyes as he reached for his hand.
“This doesn’t seem fair,” Cas teased as he flattened his palms against Dean’s chest, “you still have too many clothes on” he practically purred into Dean’s ear, sending a pleased shiver down the hunter’s spine. Dean nodded and pulled his Zeppelin t-shirt over his head and tossed it haphazardly to the side.
'' Jess is pregnant, Dean. Im going to be a father.''
They parted from the kiss briefly just to catch their breath as their eyes met. Cas noticed that Dean’s pupils had been blown wide, leaving only a thin ring of green around them. His face was flushed, which only made those tempting freckles across the bridge of his nose and cheeks standout even more. Cas found himself wondering how far down those freckles went. Did his hunter have any secret constellations on his skin, simply begging to be explored? The mere thought of them makes Cas want to explore every inch of Dean with his tongue, and then he remembers that
Before him, about 5 rows in front, was the golden stage on which the Council now stood, or at least they would if they were not currently represented by giant statues of marble and gold. The walls and high ceiling of the room looked just as he remembered them from the last time he was here. The other stone statues and velvet curtains stood proudly around the Hall, much like the angels who now housed it.Thinking back, it had been fairly recently, about 100 years.
Cas sighed, easing back once he felt confident Dean wouldn’t run away. “Yes. In order to break the deal, the entity insisted I could never go back there, and the only way to ensure that was-”
It was well past midday by the time they reached the threshold of the window that was close to the top of the tree. A couple branches extended long enough that they were able to reach the windowsill. This was as far up the tree that Dean was allowed to go as a middle ornament. They had decided to take a break on the windowsill, both of their arms sore from the constant climbing.
“Alright, so the freaks that grabbed them had a thing for branding?” Dean said as a knock came from the door. He stood up to answer it, and let Cas in.
Cas made his way to the bed hesitantly. He placed one hand on Dean’s shoulder and sat next to him, their thighs touching. “I know this must be difficult for you. Especially now that-” Cas looks briefly at Jack over Dean’s shoulder, “now that you understand what it means to be a father. We will find whoever or whatever is responsible. I promise.”
It was dark, raining, the road slippery. The windshield barely visible, headlights of the car shining uselessly through the night. Castiel was driving, no, he was speeding on trying to get to his job as a museum inspector. He would identify all the new arrivals and authenticate them. A new shipment had arrived early in the night and he couldnt wait until morning so he caught himself driving in this late night storm.
Dean Winchester was nothing like Zachariah had made him up to be. In Heaven, everyone fiercely believed Dean was their ticket to saving the world, but nothing more than that. Castiel, however, knew the truth. As he stood there in that barn, exploring the human's equipment, guns, books, he saw Dean's true potential, he saw the pureness of his soul, his righteousness. Castiel knew that Heaven would change him, being different was never something they celebrated. His entire being was telling him to help Dean, save him from what was to come, but he did not listen. For disobeying orders meant showing Free Will, a crime punishable by death. Still, he did as he was told, he followed orders.
Sam brings his laptop over to them and shows them the trailer he saw. “I saw this movie trailer for ‘
“Well then, it’s settled!” Sam interjects, putting the remnants of their snack break back in his bag. “Let’s go, we need to make it to the cave before dark.”
. This memory was a subtle ache that intensified with every step he tried to take. Once Jack had lost his grace, his body had decayed slowly too. It had gone from a mild ache to an incurable illness that not even Rowena could stop. Losing Jack to something he had no control over, that felt like drowning. The more he struggled to rise, the deeper he sank.
Tell me what to do:
Cas follows the hunter’s gaze and hums in agreement. “We should keep an eye on them, the rest of the children in this parlor are not the right age.”
"The one on the left" said Zachariah, pointing to the pictures behind him. "That one is Samuel Winchester. Sufficiently smart, trained as a hunter, blindly faithful in Heaven’s work, plus disgustingly, yet conveniently loyal to his brother, which is the one on the right, Dean." As he reached the end of the stage, the angel lingered in his spot, his vision to the floor, almost like he was considering his next words carefully. "Dean Winchester is a difficult sort of human. Our intel suggests that he is not quick to trust, he is suspicious by nature, and a very powerful hunter, just like his brother. Unlike his brother, however, he is detrimentally loyal. He is capable of killing himself, just to save another, and though that quality should be useful to us, for reasons I am about to disclose, it could also jeopardise our entire operation."
“This rain forest was nominated to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World." Cas beamed, his eyes scanning the canopy above them as they walk. "Even though it didn't win, I believe it still holds its own small wonders." The angel adds as he caresses the leaves hanging closest to him. Dean stares at his friend and smiles quietly to himself, content for the first time in years. "We have our own wonders too.”
That is when the real trouble started. Dean failed to notice the strand of cheese before he took the bite he promised he would. Which is how he found himself inches from the angel with a literal cheesy smile plastered over both of their faces. It was like some twisted version of Lady and the Tramp. Dean didn’t need a map to figure out he was definitely the tramp in this situation. Cas was too perfect to be anything other than the lady.
Dean stood quickly and picked up the empty box along with some bottles. “I’m gonna take these back to the kitchen,” he explained in a hurried tone, before he chanced one last glance at the angel’s puzzled face.
“Sorry Dean, I just don’t want to mess anything up with Baby.” Jack smiled, but still kept his eyes firmly on the road ahead.
Dean nodded and reached for the lore books that Cas had temporarily stolen from the local library. “Well, okay we can do that in the morning. For now, who or what the hell bonds children into an army?”
The angel grumbled something either unintelligible or in Enochian. Either way, Dean had no idea what it was. He kept shaking him slightly. “Wake up buddy. We gotta start getting ready.” The hunter’s voice was soft, cautiously trying to avoid startling his friend. After a few moments, Cas stirred and his blue eyes opened to find shining green ones staring back at him, mirth swimming in their gaze.
and left Cas with a permanent smile that made every moment of the last 10 years worth it.
Sam came running down the hall, his hair dripping water from his recent shower, making his clothes stick to his body. “Jack, I heard a commotion, what’s go-
“What do you mean ‘Empty’?” Dean grounded out towards Jack, trying his best to keep himself from imploding. He knew exactly what his son meant, but he didn’t want to believe it was true.
Cas stood his ground, trying to meet the entity’s absent gaze with an impassive one of his own. “I have to agree with you there,” the angel replied.
“You sure have gotten into the local coffee.” Sam chuckled, slightly startling the nephilim who had not noticed the hunter had woken up.
---------------------------------------------------
, they were all gone. No one really needed him around anymore. However, he didn't want to face Billie again, which might have been the only reason he didn’t try anything. Still, just because he didn’t want to die, it didn’t mean that he wanted to carry on living either.
Dean used the hair was holding onto to get Cas to stop. The angel pulled off his dick with an obscene ‘pop’, his lips shining and slightly red with exertion. The hunter looked down at his lover who was flushed red, panting slightly and looking up at him with that same adorable head tilt he always did. Dean felt his heart clench with the pure love and adoration he had for this gorgeous man sent from heaven. A lame pick-up line flashed through his head briefly, but he quickly dismissed it to focus on much more important matters: Cas’s cock. He pushed the angel back onto the bed, and let him settle in the middle of it. The hunter then straddled Cas’s legs, leaving his head close to the angel’s dick. He was practically salivating as he grabbed it with his left hand before mirroring Cas’s teasing lick from base to tip. He smirked at the angel’s slight indignation as he realized what he was doing.
Castiel nearly fell off his chair, his soul was altered? He didnt necessarily feel too different though he had a better vision than he had in years and he felt somewhat.. Stronger? But he thought it was because of his new "vessel" as Gabriel called it not his soul. Still he steeled himself and looked at Gabriel in the eye. "What did you do?"
Castiel's eyes snapped open, fear evident within them. Turning, he ran as fast as he could. He cursed at the halls and  their seemingly infinite length. Though beautiful, they made it extremely difficult for him to rush to the Grand Hall.
“I recognize this Weeping Woman lore.” Cas interrupts, adding air quotes. “She is normally a very powerful, vengeful ghost. She would often cause trouble for our reapers by taking children that weren’t hers. However, I have never seen one use mind-control before?”
'' So, Gabriel was it?, how is it... how am I... what?''
The paint on the ceiling of his room was chipped, and a single flake fell on top of his chest. He picked it up and held it between his thumb and index as he examined it. The front was white, once a pristine piece of a glossy whole. Yet, now it had fallen from its initial purpose, exposing the dark edges that had never seen the light of day before.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I want- I
The questions poured from him not seeming to have an end until the man silenced him.
Right next to Castiel, she had placed the figurine that looked suspiciously like Dean dressed in some festive clothing. “Why did you put Dean there?” Chuck asked, the first words he had uttered to Becky since the tree had been set up. She smiled as she looked at the tree and shrugged nonchalantly. “I don’t know, it just seems like that is where he belongs, don’t you think?” No, he did not think that at all. Dean was supposed to be his perfect, all-American, red-blooded male protagonist. No one was ever supposed to share a spot by his side. Chuck soured at the thought that his own creations plotted against him, even if it was subconsciously.
“Did you run into her?” Jack asked, his voice sounding impossibly small through the speakerphone. “Are you alright?”
Perhaps that is the reason that he now sits on his couch, watching his favorite show obsessively and drinking bottle after bottle of nameless liquor. Chuck is just trying to figure out where he had gone wrong. What had been different about this Castiel, this Dean, and this Sam. They opposed the thousands of worlds he had created before them and instilled fear in the most precious part of himself: his mind.
“I want to talk about what happened to you. You can say it and I can translate, okay?” Cas waits for her to break the silence. Always letting her make the first move.
“We can go to a museum,” Sam suggested without taking his eyes off the TV. “These are really good by the way. Thanks” He raised the half-eaten
Cas met the hunter’s eyes and shook his head. “The quote that is decorating our table, I feel that it is very fitting.”
Cas stole a couple of glances towards Dean, trying to make up his mind to mention
Cas and Dean knock on his hotel room door 5 minutes later, both of them fully dressed in the clothes they had been wearing when they left. Sam eyes them curiously but lets them pass regardless.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
His keys skitter across the parking lot towards the entrance as a young boy runs past him, pushing him in the process.
They sit together, closer than they had been nearly all day. The silence between them was companionable, like this had always been their routine. Dean turned to stare at the angel, savoring what he suspected may be his last moments close to his side. Cas looks holy in the daylight, the sun falls delicately over his cheeks and shines in his eyes, making them reflect a brilliant blue.
The tugging became insistent, trying to pull him further in, but his grace prevented him from falling.
TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!!!!!
He stands in front of his brother’s room and bangs on the door. “DEAN!” he screams at the top of his lungs, his voice strained from the exertion. As he prepares to bang on the door again, it suddenly swings open in front of him. Sam releases his grip on his gun when he sees his brother standing in the doorway. He is still wearing his sleep clothes, hair slightly tousled and eyes barely open. He definitely just woke up.
” Cas says in a gentle voice that surprises Sam. He prompts Sam to flash his badge. The woman hesitates before she nods and steps aside to welcome them inside.
“I know what you are doing” Cas spoke in a smooth, teasing voice that went straight to Dean’s groin.
Sam took out some gauze, cotton balls and alcohol and started to tend to his brother’s wound. He worked in silence for a while, only the occasional hiss from Dean between them. As he was wrapping the gauze around Dean’s foot, Sam paused. “Look, I know that with Cas gon-”
” With a smile, he stepped on the gas and felt the wind rustle his hair. This vacation was going to be great.
As they neared the waterfall, the sound of roaring water became louder and louder. By the time they were able to make their way behind the stream, the sound was practically deafening. A perfect hiding spot for a monster hiding scared children.
He loved Cas (still did) and they were so close to having everything they ever wanted. Everything Dean had only dreamed of.  How could he carry on after he knew what he had truly lost?
, just so you could stand there and-” his voice was steadily rising, unable to keep the emotion out of his words, “-and doubt me? No, I don’t think so Dean Winchester.”
As Dean and Cas walked into their room, the angel hesitated by the door. The events of the morning still weighed heavily on his mind. In just a few days, he had come closer to Dean than he ever had in the past. Yet, something still didn’t feel right. He had poured his heart into everything he did for the hunter. Into every hopeful glance, and every hug that lasted a little too long. Something seemed to be weighing Dean down as well. He stood by his bed, ruffling through his bag a little to mechanically, shoulders tensed. Going through the motions. There was a feeling inside of the hunter, that he wasn’t sure if he was ready to address.
THE END
Jack closed his eyes and waited for Dean to explode. He knew he would, that was what he did every single time Cas did something “stupid”. Yet, the screams didn’t come. He opened his eyes hesitantly and found both hunters staring at him. Sam looked concerned, but a wave of understanding came over him. He knew.
The cashier took one cursory glance at the paper on the window and sighed. “It’s been there for nearly a month now. There’s other kids too. This whole place has really turned into a craphole lately.”
Cas shrugged, “I’m not entirely sure, something seemed to break or bypass her connection.”
He still remembers the feeling of Dean’s lips against his own. The small, electrifying touch that made all of his synapses fire at once. An implosion of warmth and love that he had never felt before, and could do little against. It wasn’t like he wanted to resist anyway. He remembers giving as good as he got. The feeling of Dean’s hitched breaths against his vessel’s skin as they parted. Heaven could rarely grant him such peace, even during the good days.
“Common Cas, like right now! When have you ever willingly put space between us?” Dean demands, one brow raised. He turns to face his friend fully, sunset temporarily forgotten. The angel keeps staring at the horizon in silence.
Cas blushed as he reached for the menu that Sam was handing him and took his time reading it. It had been years since he was human, so he wanted to enjoy the best perk of mortality at its fullest: food. Yet, after reading the menu three times he still couldn’t decide on what to order. Even as the others started giving their orders to the nice waitress, Cas struggled to make a decision. However, when he heard Dean order, a sudden clarity came over him. Once the waitress turned to him, he just gave her a cheerful smile and said, “I’ll have the same thing my boyfriend ordered.”
The hunter side-eyes at his son before raising one hand in defeat. “Shoot.”
"Great, so this is it. One ex-blood junkie, one drop-out with 6 bucks to his name and Mr. Comatose over there. Team Free Will."
Sam fought back the tears that threatened to fall as he tried to comfort his brother who, for the first time in a very long time, had started openly sobbing in front of him. He smoothed his palm in slow circles against Dean’s back and just let him let go. Painful sobs stuttered through the hunter’s body, almost like the act of emotional release was foreign to him. As if once shed, his tears had no idea where to go.
“Yeah, my money is also on witch, but we won’t know more until we interview the victims.” Sam sighed and closed his laptop. “Either way, we are not doing anyone any good by staying up. I’m gonna hit the hay.” He picked up the rest of his things and left for his room leaving Jack behind. There was no use in waking him now.
I am also the Goddess of wisdom, courage, and inspiration. So I am going to give you two some much needed wisdom, miscommunication is the main evil in your life. You are probably wondering what I’m talking about how is miscommunication the main evil.
“Hello, Dean.” Greeted Cas he had settled on the bonnet next to Dean, in his typical suit and trench coat.
But Dean, you were a wreck weren’t you. Mean to poor little Jack because you blamed him. Depressed and despondent. You even prayed to God to bring Castiel back didn’t you. You were desperate and struggling and when you were given the perfect opportunity to set those ghosts free by temporarily killing yourself. You didn’t care that it was dangerous that this may be the time it didn’t work and Sam wouldn't be able to restart your heart in time because you just didn’t care.
Dean started it back at the beginning of the Season before taking Jack’s lead and relaxing back into the couch.
“Ok and you are fine pretending to be in a relationship with my brother Cas?” Queried Sam.
It was completely platonic and innocent. So Dean found It hilarious that when John walked in he immediately started grumbling and gave Dean his patented you’ve screwed up and I’m incredibly disappointed in you glare.
“Son you are being stupid, you’ve proved your point.” John demanded again angrier this time.
It was why, even though Dean had missed Cas over this last month, he understood why Cas needed to be up in heaven that this was Cas way of redeeming himself. But the last time they had spoken a couple of days ago, Cas had let Dean know that it was all sorted for now, that he and Jack had done all they could up in Heaven at the moment and that they would be coming home to the bunker in the next couple of days.
Which was harder than John had thought, his boys had created quite a network and they were never alone. So John had figured if he wanted to get him one on one his only chance was to approach him in his bedroom before Dean started his morning.
And while I was angry that Cas was going crazy Cas I understood were he was coming from we had all done crazy things for those we love. Not that I had ever told Cas I loved him back. Again no chick flick moments for me.
Which was something Dean was grateful for but it meant they   didn’t just have to act around John, Mary and Bobby. But all the hunters coming in and out of the bunker just in case anyone  mentioned anything to John. Because unsurprisingly with the way John had acted before he left. Everyone had quickly come to the realisation that Dean and Cas were a couple. . And thanks to the bunker being headquarters really that meant that they had to be a couple at all timed.
“You deserve to be happy Dean, it’s all I ever wanted for my children  so I’m glad you have the time now to just be happy. I’m also glad that it wasn’t because you didn’t feel like you could trust me. Because your my son Dean and I’ll always love you no matter what. I’m incredibly sorry about your father, I’ll try to talk to him and make him see reason. We may have become friends of some sort but he isn’t the John I knew before or after the Cupid’s interference. So I don’t know how much luck I’ll have but I promise I’ll try.” With that Mary stood up and came around the bed to give Dean a kiss on the cheek before leaving him to think about what just happened.
Dean couldn’t hide his smile when Cas said he planned to stay at the bunker for a while if that was okay. Dean made sure Cas understood just how okay it was.
Soon It was time for Crowley to start making appearances in the story and  that was when Rowena really started to pay attention as they spoke about their first real meeting with Crowley when he was just King of the crossroads before he was the King of Hell.
Do you realise how much could have been solved if you had simply asked Cas to stay and told him he was important because of who he is and not as a weapon. Stressed that you needed him because of him and not to fight your battles
Are the two of you understanding what I'm saying here do you understand how if you were actually honest with each other so much would be different.
He wasn’t prepared to see how people treated him when they were assuming something completely different.
“Sorry about what Mom?” This wasn’t how Dean was expecting the conversation to go.
Could being Dead be positive? Could being in Heaven be positive.
Dean hoped Cas could read in his eyes that he was sorry for what he was about to do. Just as their lips touched Dean closed his eyes, not wanting to see the look on Cas's face.
Dean felt guilty and almost came clean then and there. John was the only parent that Dean was trying to prove a point to. He had no intention of causing Mary to feel so much guilt, when she really had no reason to feel it.
That left him all caught up. Knowing every dumb, stupid, decision his boys had made since his death.
Dean would admit he had an ego, and how was he meant to admit how he actually died. It was embarrassing and really a worse ending than if Chuck had written it himself.
Just Sam trying to make sure his big brother wasn’t making a stupid mistake. But Dean had thought about this, what he said may have been spur of the moment. But he knew he was prepared to deal with whatever the outcome was.
Life couldn’t stop just because John wanted to hear the story, so it was a couple of days before they were able to all meet back up in the map room.  Dean let Sam take over a lot of the explanation with Ruby and Lilith, jumping in only when needed, .
Over the rest of the time they covered Sam returning from hell and them realising he was soulless. Sam working with Samuel Campbell yes Mom your father. How Crowley had them hunting Alpha monsters as in the very first of the monsters.
They explained meeting Rowena and Sam spoke about the ‘alliance’ he made with her to try and cure Dean from the mark of Cain getting Crowley and Charlie to help as well.
Cas got up to leave when he noticed Dean falling asleep. But Dean reached out wrapping his arm around Cas wrist and asking him to stay. In Dean’s tired state he really had just meant till the end of the move. There was no need for Cas to miss out on the rest of it just because Dean was falling asleep. But there may have also been the fact that he didn’t want Cas to go, he was comfy and warm. Two words he would never admit out loud.
Dean wasn’t in the kitchen long before he was joined by Cas. Cas was merely leaning against the counter across from Dean. Dean was frying up some bacon as Cas told him about the book he had been reading while they all slept.
“Your right and really I should have expected it from you, you always did let me down. Dean on the other hand you always did what was right and beside for a weakness when it came to Sam, I could always trust you to make the right decisions. Yet apparently that was only when I was here to keep an eye on you. I'm still struggling to comprehend exactly how you are the boy I raised. The only thing I can say I’m proud of you about is not having a relationship with  a monster like Sam here.”
Cas brushed  it off like it was nothing. Like he was fine with the impromptu kiss. The only thing about it that concerned him was if Dean was okay with what John had said.
I would love to know what you guys are thinking so far? Do you think Cas is in denial as much as Dean? Who do you think is going to break first?
But growing up as hunters and living the life they had for the last thirteen years, neither Dean or Sam had been able to relax and just enjoy life. This wasn’t how life worked for a Winchester, you didn’t defeat the big bad and suddenly have everything be okay. There was always something around the corner to look out for.
No surprise it was Sam asking where he and Cas had gotten off to and if they were going to reappear anything soon. Apparently Dad had questions for them both.
That was the big part of why he was okay with not hunting, he wasn’t feeling the call, before he had always felt like if he didn’t hunt and someone got killed that was on him. But now because they had a proper network now they had other people who were able to tackle the hunts.
To no surprise Sam, Mom, Dad, Jack, Bobby and Rowena were all already sitting and waiting when they finally joined the group.
Dean decided though he was going to be a little bit defiant though and wasn’t going to jump as soon as Dad wanted him though so they did finish the last five minutes of the episode they were on before wandering out to the main area.
It turned out they both realised neither of them actually knew what they wanted to do. They both may have been big believers in free will.  But they hadn’t exactly had complete free will ever in either of their lives.
“Look Sam things have changed we aren’t who we were when Dad died and he needed to realise that I wasn’t going to sit there and let him tell me the only thing I have done right in the last twelve years was not sleep with a monster.
Can give a guy a false sense of security.
“You deserve a break Cas I’m happy for you.”  They had all deserved a break for years, and it was about time they were finally getting one.
Dean admitted he was drowning in grief over Cas and couldn’t help but blame Jack fully. Deciding he had already admitted enough embarrassing, stupid choices and everything along those lines that one more wasn’t going to make a difference. He certainly couldn’t disappoint John anymore than he already had.
“So Rowena tried to explain to me why you said what you said and how it was a perfect plan but I really don’t get it why would you want Dad to be angry at you Dean?” Even with Rowena explaining what she thought was Dean’s reasoning Sam was still confused and wanted to hear it from Dean.
Positive - Michael and Lucifer may not have been problems for years but at least he could say they were officially off the playing board now.
Positive -  God wasn’t using humans as chess pieces, or trying to destroy their earth. If he couldn’t be proud of that what could he be proud of? Thanks to him and his family they had saved literally the whole world from the ultimate threat.
Sam had people who had his back. Bobby and Rowena and Mom may judge Sam when they found out the truth about everything but Dean knew they would understand in the end. They had all made tough choices in their life and respected or loved Sam for who he was now. Sam had people in his corner besides Dean.
“Well, obviously you and Cas aren’t a couple because please like you could have hidden that from us. You obviously just wanted to piss your father off, and I know all about saying things just to make family angry, and your father was already insulting me so I figured I would help you with your plan.” Dean was speechless processing what Rowena had said.
Dean really struggled to talk about Cas death with Mary noticing and quickly jumping back into the conversation,  talking about dragging Lucifer into the apocalypse world.
Positive - Sam was Alive.
I knew I needed to have a proper conversation with Cas. I had known since he had come back I needed to… well I should tell him about what losing him did to me.
Dean seemed confident and passionate enough, that Cas was happy to follow his lead. He wasn't a hundred percent certain it wasn't going to backfire on them. But if this was what Dean needed to do, to step out from his father's shadows. He was going to do whatever it took yo have Deans back.
Sam must have sensed that a conflict was about to break out though and quickly asked Jack how it had gone in heaven. Jack was happy to fill Sam in on everything he had been up to. With John listening attentively and asking questions.
In John’s opinion he was the monster, yet to him John was the monster.  Because anyone who treated their children the way John does is a monster. Claire and Jack may not be his children but he thought of them both that way especially Jack. And there is nothing they could do that would make him stop loving them.
Or Cas if you had been honest when you wanted to stay. Simply told Dean you didn’t want to leave him that you had to but you would much rather stay with him.
“I wanted to talk to you and I wasn’t exactly keen to leave Rowena and Jack with Dad, who is still ranting to Mom and Bobby about your little bombshell you dropped by the way.” Sam answered explaining he had brought the other two into the room, closing the door properly at least behind giving them all privacy from the other occupants of the bunker.
It was when they had almost finished all of everything leading up to the apocalypse that wasn’t, when both Sam and Dean looked at each other and realised they had completely and utterly forgotten to mention Adam so that was a necessary quick back track.
Cas obviously needed the hug too because he relaxed straight into Dean's arms hugging him back just as tightly. The fact that Cas was hugging just as tightly meant Dean was in no rush to let go, letting it last for a couple of seconds longer than was really necessary before he pulled back and gave Jack a one arm hug slap on the back  before leading them both over to the table and telling them to help themselves.
Dean knew his life was messed up, that he had been through some pretty messed up shit in his life, but he was a master at repressing. It wasn’t until he was laying everything out factually in order for John.  That it really struck him how messed up his life was, to even make it through one of these events was against all odds. Dean truly struggled to comprehend how he was even sitting here alive to tell this story.
Dean couldn’t help smiling behind his coffee mug as John looked annoyed at the side track this conversation had taken.
“Technically I think the term for Dean would be bisexual and while I have a male vessel I don’t necessarily consider myself male. And while I have only been with woman I couldn’t care less if they are male or female and I believe the term for that is pansexual. So the question you should ask Jack is if Sam has a problem with me being pansexual and Dean pretending to be bisexual.”  Cas explained as if it was no surprise that he was knowledgeable on different sexualities.
So I wanted to make him angry and think I had actually done that as well. Sure I could have used Anna if I was determined it had to be an Angel, or even a couple of other ‘monsters’ but I knew he would be most angry if I was currently in a relationship with them plus you know how he feels about ‘fags’ as he would call them so Cas made the most sense.” Dean explained to Sam without getting into the real emotional reasons behind his choices.
Dean wondered when they were going to admit they had a thing for each other. It may not be incredibly obvious for others, and it had all only really clicked for Dean a couple of days ago.
John was on a much larger hunt with Bobby and Mary chasing down a vampire nest, which was the only reason Sam and Dean both felt comfortable leaving Cas, Rowena and Jack at the bunker.
They were hunters but they didn’t care that he was with Cas. They didn’t treat him any differently than they treated Sam. It was a weird relief to find out that people still treated him like the badass he was even if they thought he was sleeping with a guy.
I was angry at Cas I was completely furious at what he did but I was angry at myself as well especially when we spoke to him about it after we got back from visiting Donatello when I asked him what gave him the right.
They spoke about their quest to open another riff into the apocalypse world and the steps they took, including Jack ending up getting stuck in the apocalypse world all by himself. Which is when Mary was able to explain what they got up to over there.
”Because all I ever wanted was to make him proud Cas. For so long I only did what I knew he would approve of even if I disagreed. And if I couldn't go through with what he wanted I felt incredible guilt. But now I can finally admit he screwed up my childhood WhenI walked out of our burning house at four with Sammy in my arms, my childhood was officially over I was forced to become a Mom and Dad to Sam as well as be his big brother. I was forced to hunt and take on responsibilities at such a young age that should never have been forced on me.”
I wasn't stupid though I knew a big part of my issue of all our issues me, Sam, Cas even Mom was communication. I hated ”chick flick moments” Dad raised me to believe they weren't necessary.
Especially if he had found out everything Cas had done ‘wrong’ over the years. He would use that as proof to have him gone. Even though Sam and I had screwed up just as much we were human he could forgive that.
“Thanks Mom.” Mary let Dean enjoy his coffee and wake up slowly, which Dean was grateful for because he was going to need the caffeine to hit,  before what was bound to be an uncomfortable conversation started.
How it was hard for Dean when he realised exactly what Cas was up to and his deal with Crowley to open Purgatory yes Purgatory, it’s a thing as well. How now he understood but at the time felt completely betrayed.
“Is the new season on Netflix?” Jack asked.
He had been trying to be more than his anger. It had been something he had been trying to work on and he wasn’t going to let his anger beat him now.
But of course, I Dean Winchesterered the whole thing and screwed the conversation up. He gave me a perfect opportunity when he said ‘he believed he was brought back for a reason.’  I should have said yes I was so depressed and angry that we are pretty sure I scared Jack into subconsciously using his powers to bring you back. The timeline just fits with when Cas said he came back and the conversation Jack overhead between Sam and I.
Not to say he wouldn’t hunt occasionally he had been itching after all and that was why he came on the salt and burn. But he really had no desire to go on the more dangerous hunts not after all they had been through in their lives. If anyone deserved a break it was them.
We are officially into the second half of my outline which is scary in away. Because when I originally planed this fic the whole thing was going to be 20,000 ish words and it's already almost up that point and I haven't finished writing it.
John had had enough of putting up with Dean. He was sick of the charade. He didn’t understand exactly why Dean was so pissed off with him but enough was enough. He knew his son better than anyone, he knew he just needed to get Dean one on one and remind him of the importance of family.
When Dean had thought of retiring it was on a beach beer in hand with Cas and Sam. And that really wasn’t possible. Not just because he couldn’t imagine doing it now without Cas by his side.
Dean may have not had the best “healthy coping mechanisms.” Emotionally stunted was a favourite phrase of Sams.
“The kiss that was necessary because our Father was being a jerk, what is there to talk about?”
That thought startled Dean. The bunker was his first ever home, how would he even buy a house.
Dean really hoped John had headed to the kitchen, because it would be so worth whatever teasing Sam and Rowena came up with when they found out,  for John to see Cas walk through the bunker in a pair of Dean’s sweats, an old shirt of Dean and barefoot.
Dean also came to realise that he had underestimated saying him and Cas were a couple not affecting everything in his life . But he was too stubborn to back down. He was just going to have to deal with all the consequences and Cas was a saint for putting up with him.
It wasn’t for the first time since the Angels had given them their father back that Dean had wished instead they had given them back their Bobby. Apocalypse Bobby may look and sound like their Bobby but he just wasn’t theirs. He wasn’t the man who was more their father than John.
Why couldn’t he drive recklessly, he was already dead, though if he was being honest with himself he would have rather gone out crashing Baby. It would have been sad to wreck Baby. But would have been a better way to go and at least something he could admit to others.
Really he had just kept putting it out of his mind besides thinking it was a weird dynamic they had and how close they had gotten. Dean was aware they had both bonded over shared trauma.
Dean was going to have to show some faith and hope prayer worked up here and Cas had his ears on. Otherwise, he would retrace his route and get back to Bobby. But he would rather solve the problem himself first. So prayer it was.
In Winchester timing it was the morning after they had finished explaining the last of their past that Cas and Jack finally arrived home. As soon as they walked into the kitchen where everyone was having breakfast. Dean found himself standing up and pulling Cas into a bone tight hug.
(See the end of the chapter for
The more monsters he defeated, the more impossible situations he got out of, literally coming back from the dead multiple times.
Between Sharing the workload with their new hunter network, the acceptance he was getting from everyone, the feeling of having his whole family back and everyone safe. Dean was able to just enjoy life and go as domestic as he wanted to without worrying about his image.
Though Dean did enjoy the look on Bobby and Dads face when they mentioned that prophet Chuck  they had mentioned way back was actually God and Amara was God's sister, and how that all went down. How Amara thanked Dean by resurrecting Mary. It was one of those moments where they actually got enjoyment from sharing their past.
And they were finally utilizing the bunker for what it was made for with it becoming home base.
The simple salt and burn was just what Dean needed, it was simple muscle memory, they could have done it in their sleep. It was just what he needed to get rid of pent up energy.
“Some of your Netflix shows have new episodes do you want to watch anything?” Dean asked trying to change the topic to an easier conversation.
“I don’t know if I would say this is the happiest I have ever been but I would agree it’s the most relaxed I’ve ever been if that is the word you want to use. For the first time I not only feel good in my decision and actions but they have actually led to things being good.”  Dean could tell Cas meant every word as he was fully relaxed into his end of the couch.
Probably yes to all. But was he going to not yet?
Cas couldn’t help but stare at Dean as he spoke, he was confused because Dean wasn’t lying he truly did look relaxed and like he was in a good mood. Even with how their morning had started. Maybe he was choosing to just ignore John like Sam had suggested.
“That you didn’t think you could trust me with this, I know it was rough at first as I transitioned to being alive and my babies being adults. That I wasn’t exactly here for you both and we had a hard time transitioning. I also  know the time I grew up in wasn’t exactly known for being accepting of gays. But I never really had an issue and since coming back I’ve realised that it really isn’t an issue at all. And I should have made that clear. Especially when I started to suspect there was something with you and Cas but there was never exactly the time to talk to you about it. I’ve let you down as your Mom so yes I’m sorry.”
Then Sam tried to ever so casually like it was no big deal slip into conversation that, Rowena had permanently moved into the bunker. It had been during a conversation about one of the hunts they had hunters on, he just casually tried to slip it, before attempting to distract Dean with the way the hunters had killed a vamps nest.
“You can’t hold some dumb decision I made over ten years ago over my head dad. It was stupid and dumb of me and I have spent a long time trying to making up for it. But it is something I have been able to move and forgive myself for. I literally was tortured by the devil because of it, I’ve had to help save the world several times. Judge me all you want Dad I honestly don’t care.” This was by far not the first time Sam had stood up to their father but every time he did, Dean was amazed he had the courage to.
Jack turns to smile at his father. “I rather like it, it feels like we are driving in a trampoline.”
“I know that my lack of powers will be inconvenient when we are hunting, but I can train and get bett-” Cas had rushedly tried to assure the hunters he wouldn’t be a deadweight, but stopped when he felt Dean’s arms wrap around his body, pulling him in for the first time since he arrived. His breath caught in his chest, a small gasp leaving him before he embraced the hunter back.
Dean scoffed. “A museum? No way, Sammy. Vacations aren’t for learning.” He takes a swig of his coffee, taking a moment to savor the bitterness. He was pleasantly surprised by the richness of the coffee and decides it's probably the best he has ever had.
For a moment, Cas looked up at his normal spot on the tree before turning to stare out the window. “It seems that we are” he finally responded, his voice small.
A shadow came over the boy’s eyes as he chose his next words carefully. “Dean hasn’t been the same since we lost you,” he muttered with a hint of sadness.
Sam stares at his son, wondering where the boy got his intuition from.
Castiel had known none of his new abilities would come without a price, however he didn't expect it to be so soon. He wondered what would he be tasked. He realized he knew very little about angels even though he studied them throughout his whole life. As a museum curator he was always especially interested in angelic exhibits without really knowing why. The cherub paintings and halos were nothing like what stood before him. Gabriel was a normal-looking man, a vessel, his mind supplied. His golden eyes and apparently permanent smirk gave him an almost sinister look, nothing like what he imagined the servants of God to be.
“Heads up, one of the gremlins is on the move.” Dean tenses, keeping an eye on the bathroom as the kid keeps walking steadily towards it. The tension broken, they both spring back into action.
“Hi, Dean” Jack managed to say through a yawn, as he stretched his arms over his head. His face broke into a soft, dopey smile once he laid eyes on the coffee sitting on the table. He made his way over as well and grabbed a cup of coffee with both hands. He relished the warmth on his fingertips and took a deep breath. In spite of his sweet tooth, he loved coffee. Dean smiled at the kid and reached out to ruffle his blonde hair while a small warmth bloomed in his chest.
Dean calls to check in with Cas and Sam. They agree to meet at a diner close to their hotel to compare case notes. A quick Google Maps check lets him know that they are only 20 minutes out.
The darkness he sank into gave way to a familiar weight. As he felt the warm energy pulling him forward, Cas couldn’t help but enjoy the feelings of guilt melting away around him. It was as if the farther away he got from the center of the Empty, the lighter he felt. Leaving behind his regrets and surfing on his hopes for a future he could almost reach.
She stares at both men for what feels like a long time. She meets Cas’s eyes and the tension in her shoulders melts. There’s something about him that she knows she can trust. “Okay, but you will have to translate.” She points at Cas. “She doesn’t know how to speak in English yet, but she does understand it. I would translate but I… can’t bear hearing her go through everything again.”
Humans could be fragile creatures, especially the ones that thought they weren't.
It was easier not to care. His toothpaste had run out three days ago, but he didn’t bother replacing it. His last shower had been 2 days ago, and he hadn’t bothered to wash or brush his hair since
Dean’s mouth went dry, the tell-tale warmth in his chest returned and he could feel his heart pounding against his ribcage. “Uh, what do you mean Cas?” he asked dumbly. Barely able to maintain a straight face once the angel was close enough to smell his cologne.
“Yes, a bonding ritual.” Cas agreed, before continuing “I presume that the monster was trying to finish her spell on the children before you killed her, but it backfired somehow.”
Gabriel started eating a new lolipop. "Well you sure dont dance around the point do you? Well to be able to bring yoj back into a vessel on Earth without your soul burning to a crisp in the fall I had to alter it a bit."
Dean followed Cas’s gaze as he nodded. “Yeah, I figured as much. Should be easy enough for you.”
There was no doubt in his mind, that was the day he became "Cas."
night. His efforts to get out of bed this time were somewhat fruitful, he was able to place his feet against the floor as he sat at the edge of his mattress.
“I just wanted to know that I wasn't the only one that could see it. I think they could make each other very happy.” Jack’s eyes were hopeful, and with a snap of his fingers, he changed into his pajamas.
Sam huffs, impressed. “Goodnight Jack.” he chuckles and heads back to the table. Personally, he thinks the matchmaker scheme will have to wait until after the case was done.
“Why would this place serve such dangerous soft serve?” The angel questions, his voice deep and conspiratory.
Cas turned towards Dean, with mirth swimming in his eyes. “You were saying,
“Don’t worry yourself too much kid, we already survived the trip to the pizza place.” Dean pointed at the warm stack of pies that sat in the backseat, forcing both hunters to take in their tantalizing smell.
A little while later, Mirna came out from behind the counter with a tray full of their orders and started walking towards them. She set the huge tray of food on the empty table next to them as she started to distribute their orders
The entity sighed, returning to its normal size. “Tragic part about that, Cassie, is that you are right,” It walked behind the angel to where a makeshift throne had materialized out of thin air. It sprawled across the throne, its legs draping off the side, making it look more like some ice cream which had melted over a chair, than a fearsome celestial being.
“I wasn’t aware that was considered a flirtation,” Cas finally said after Dean had settled down.
Dean smiled, he did miss Charlie and he had some free time after training so "Yeah sure I would love that Charlie! See you after training."
“Cas...” his voice betrayed him, the awe practically dripping from that one syllable, “you’re so… wow,” he added lamely. As soon as the words left his mind, they were suddenly replaced by all the different ways he wanted to ravage the man in front of him.
“Morning, sunshine.” Dean chuckled. There was something funny about having an angel welcome him home like an
In spite of every tragedy, loss and apocalypse that came his way, Castiel was finally home.
Gabriel, seemingly unaware of the other angel's inner struggle, took the lollipop he was eating out of his mouth long enough to say: ''Love" The word confused Castiel, he wasn't sure what the angel meant by that. Gabriel sighed almost annoyed at having to explain it so thoroughly. "Love is yr mission little bro. You gotta get your little trench-coated wings and work as a cupid. They are a bit short on staff and well the big man thinks you would be a great fit. You see, cupids can be a bit too lenient sometimes and not really achieved their goals in the more troublesome cases. That's where you and your new angel mojo come in, help the cupids with some cases and then you are home-free."
Castiel had always been aware of his preference. He had never acted upon it in life and was therefore out of touch with his "romantic" side. However, now he somehow walked on the side of the road aimlessly holding on to the picture of a man he found to be gorgeous and an envelope telling him exactly who he had to make sure the man ended up with. He sighed and put the picture back and closed the envelope. He knew it would not be easy to do this but it was well worth coming back to life for.
Her room is bright purple with flowers painted all over the walls. Her toys are neatly piled in a bin at the far end of her room. Maria is sitting on the floor drawing when they come in. She doesn’t acknowledge any of them as they walk in. Crystal gives one last glance at the men and gestures for them to go ahead. Cas walks in first, dropping to sit on the floor next to the child. Maria stops drawing and looks up to the angel expectantly. She has beautiful curly hair and big, brown eyes. For a moment, she reminds Cas of the children’s movie Dean made him watch about a small doe.
“Alright, I’m thinking we can say that I am FBI here to look into the disappearances, and you are the child psychologist. Maybe that way they feel a bit better about letting us talk to her?” Sam says looking through his backpack for his badge.
Dean handed over the money and looked down at the silver band on his left hand. His eyes softened. “It was a gift from my mom.”
Dean and Sam continued to writhe in pain next to him. Cas ached to be able to help them and frantically searched for a way to stop her. In a second, the angel knew he had to find a way to stop the source of the water, just like he had done before. The river flowed into the cavern from an opening on the far right side. He scanned the floor around him, looking for anything that might help him. He found a solution that weighed approximately 234 lbs: a small, stone boulder. As the angel made his way towards the rock, the spirit followed his movements and started shrieking louder. She raised one of her hands and quickly dropped it to her side, which caused a large stalagmite to fall from the ceiling a few inches away from the angel. Cas evaded the sudden rainstorm of rocks she sent in his direction by zig-zagging across the cavern floor. Quickly, he picked up the stone with ease and used it to block the river’s flow. The water slowly stopped trickling down the cavernous space, and the screeching stopped.
Even after Charlie quit, her and Dean remained good friends. She didn't always call and certainly not that early, so Dean worried and immediately called her back.
Dean stilled and a smile slowly crept its way onto his face. His baby brother was having a baby. A gush of pride went through him. He remembered going to Sam's graduation from Harvard Law, listening to his brother explain to him his new job at the museum. It never made sense to Dean what could make a person literally devote their life to dusty books but that was Sam did and he was happy, so Dean was too. Now he was going to be a father, he was going to have a child to protect, just ike Dean did when his mother died and his father gave up on them.
Dean gave Charlie a questioning look and she smiled. "I had a friend named Cas. He used to work at the museum but he.. He had an accident and he didn't make it. That was his brother, Jimmy." Dean looked at her with an even more confused expression.
Attractive
“I don’t, but judging by your expression for the past hour, it looks like you could use a break.” Cas challenged as he held the hunter’s gaze.
“I can definitely feel it.” Cas rasped, enjoying the sweet scent of flowers tickling his face as they drove by mountain after mountain. “Shut the AC off, we don’t need it here.” He spoke in Dean’s direction, and the hunter obliged. They drove for 15 more minutes, content to enjoy the sweet-scented breeze and the cool temperature that felt like a respite from the harsh, hot temperatures of the city. They came up to what could be loosely referred to as a parking lot but was, in reality, a small plot of land that people left their cars in. Since it was a Tuesday morning, the plot was empty save for them.
IT IS FINISHED!! I am sorry I didn't go Explicit with the reunion, it just didn't feel quite right with how everything turned out. Sorry, I am a fluff monster rn. Still, I hope you enjoyed!! Thank you to everyone that asked for this fic, I hope that it lived up to your expectations. Leave comments and kudos, I love hearing from you!
“Cas” the hunter muttered breathlessly before he leaned in to steal a chaste kiss. The moment their lips touched, they became a black hole at the center of the universe. There was only them, and for a brief moment no other sound or feeling existed outside of them. They were everything and nothing at the same time.
Cas opened the bottle and poured some of the lube on his fingers, rubbing them against each other to warm the sticky liquid. Dean rose up to straddle the angel’s hips and bent down to kiss him again. This time the kiss was deeper, hungrier. As they kissed, Cas reached down to Dean’s ass and started to spread him open. The hunter flinched at the first finger, surprised at the sudden intrusion. Cas started rubbing slow circles on his lover’s back to soothe him. Their kiss went from hungry to soothing, their mouths just close enough to each other to bring comfort. Sharing the same breath. Their skin burned everywhere that they touched, a strong warmth coursing through their veins. They stayed that way until Cas managed to go all the way up to three fingers, Dean starting to moan at the pleasant burn.
Castiel, Angel of Thursday, who only a couple days earlier had waltzed into his life and challenged everything that Chuck had ever known. This rebel angel, the one that came with a crack in his chassis, unwittingly stared straight into the eyes of his creator and said: “Well, we are making it up as we go.” That was the day that Chuck had lost for the first time in his very long life, and now he had a Christmas tree with his insubordinate creation smiling benevolently at him from the place of honor.
Cas hesitated, his eyes fixating on a dirty spot on the kitchen floor. He rubbed at it with his shoe absentmindedly, as he mulled his words over carefully in his head.
Cas’s face brightens at the suggestion, “That sounds like a great idea. Should we leave now Dean?” He turns to face the hunter, a hopeful look on his face. Both the angel and his son looked like two freaking puppies begging for treats. Dean could never say no to that.
The angel reached out to touch Dean, intent on using his weakened grace to check him for injuries. Sam and Jack shared a look, but otherwise, let the angel try to help. They both knew how much Dean meant to him. To all of them. The moment Cas’s fingers came into contact with the hunter’s arm, he felt an electric shock come from the hunter and go straight to the burning in his arm. He flinched and his face contorted in pain.
“Yeah, it’s pretty great.” Dean meets the angel’s eyes briefly and clears his throat. “I have an idea of where to stop. How long has it been since you’ve seen a sunset?” The hunter grins and steps on the gas.
"Congratulations, Castiel. You are now an Angel of the Lord"
blood, but soon they will be
“No,” Cas began, “I am not leaving. I didn’t crawl myself out of that empty wasteland just so you could push me away”. The former angel crept closer to the hunter, forcing him to step backwards until he was pinned against the edge of his bed. “I didn’t give up my grace,
*Some hours earlier* Castiel was still slightly off-centered by the time Gabriel left him outside a seemingly normal bar in Topeka, Kansas. His instructions were to go inside. That was it, all the archangel had said before smirking and leaving.
Dean doubled over laughing at the angel’s awkward retort, much to Cas’s chagrin. He walked towards the angel and wrapped his arm around his shoulders as he breathed in “Oh buddy,” Dean said between laugh-filled breaths “we need to work on your flirting.”
Castiel saw Dean, felt his longing calling out to him, and dragged him back from the dark reality Zachariah had sent him to. The false future that he claimed was the inevitable result of Dean’s continued resistance.
Cas’s face settled into a frown, his eyes darkened as tears started flowing freely down his face. This couldn’t be happening. He was home now, he was safe. Yet, Dean’s words had made him feel like he was back in the Empty’s depths, left at Its mercy. He could hear the entity’s harsh words clear as day:
"Daring
One leaf falls delicately on Cas’s head. The angel grabs it and stares at it with a small smile on his face. At that moment, fleeting rays of sunlight cut through the canopy and fall on the angel’s face. For a brief moment, Cas looks downright angelic, shiny halos and all. The last of Dean’s hesitation is gone then. “Cas, can I ask you a question?”
“I simply turned off the water source, the faucet. The noise stopped after that and the child returned to normal.” Cas’s voice was nonchalant like he hadn’t described the easiest way to stop a monster in history.
His grace layered over him, like an ethereal shield against the pain the Empty tried to inflict. He was stronger than his suffering now. He was stronger because he had something that could make even the sharpest, cutting words shatter. Cas had love. He had love for his son, for Dean and for Sam. Something worth fighting for, and a family worth returning to. His grace was interwoven with every single positive memory Cas had in his possession. A small smile escaped him as he realized that they significantly outweighed the bad ones. Which is why the Empty had tried so hard to make him forget. But, you can never truly forget the good, not if it was the only times you ever felt truly alive. The Empty wouldn’t be able to touch him anymore. At least, hopefully, long enough for him to escape.
In the background, visual aides had been raised to help with the mission assignments. Even though that in itself was standard procedure, what Castiel found odd was the images they had chosen. There were two pictures of two human males. They seemed ordinary enough, and Castiel did not understand how they could possibly be as important as Zachariah stated.
And that was all the hunter needed.
“You need to use my blood. Only you can kill her, Dean.” Cas deadpans without further explanation. Sam and Dean share a look before turning back to their friend, concern evident on their features.
Cas pressed his lips against Dean’s neck, aiming for a strategically placed freckle he had seen there. He took soft nips at the skin and revelled when Dean tilted his head to the side to allow him better access. The hunter’s hands had found their way to Cas’s hips, and were urgently trying to untuck his lover’s shirt.
"My name is Gabriel. I am an Archangel of the Lord. I heard your pleas while you were rising and evaluated your soul. I deemed it worthy and found you a vessel. Though at a price of course."
“Are we there yet?” Jack asked cheerfully. He didn’t take his eyes off the window and had his nose nearly pressed to the glass.
“Has Dean ever been in love?”
Castiel had never cared for alcohol, sex or drugs since he was young. This mostly made him an outcast seeing as everyone around him was obsessed by these. He had been fine to just live his days until he found someone worth getting to know better. Even if that moment never came.
“Jesus, Cas, could you have any more layers on?” Dean groaned when he noticed the former angel’s undershirt beneath his dress shirt, making a point of tugging against it dramatically, almost as if he could will it away with one thought. When Cas was still an angel, he could have, but he pointedly ignores that thought.
Jack nodded slowly, his gaze drifting back down to where Cas had been standing. “I wasn’t supposed to come back. The Empty didn’t want me to come back,” a chill went down the nephilim’s spine as he thought of the horrible entity. The cold chill reminded him of the darkness that had enveloped him for months in the Empty. All of the months he had spent standing in place, unsure of what to do, and waiting for Billie to come back for him. He never wanted to go back, but now….
"That's it? Just keep my identity a secret? No tricks?"
The words resonated through his new celestial being. ''Congratulations... You are now an Angel of the Lord." The reality of the situation came crashing down on Castiel. A part of him could not believe his ears but certainly there was no denying this information. It came straight from his new angel friend? Brother? He didn't know WHAT to call him. So he stuck to his name.
. It didn’t make sense. He wasn’t all that great to look at up close, even less from all the way at the top. Did Cas have some strange hyper vision powers that he didn’t know about?
“Don’t you dare leave me again” Dean muttered into his best friend’s shoulder, his body trembling in their embrace.
Invenire se ante epulari die fines et sigilli vestri vinculum in serenitatem
“Good morning Dean,” Cas said with a small smile as he stepped aside to let Dean come into their shared hotel room.
Sam reached for the pizza box closest to him, grabbing a slice for himself before pointing it towards Cas and asking: “Cas, do you want some of this?” And just like that, his plan was set into motion. Now he just needed to wait and see if his brother would take the bait.
Cas took a moment to really listen, his head tilting slightly to the side as he concentrated. His grace was weaker than it used to be eons ago, but every day he was slowly gaining a bit of his strength back. Regardless, he couldn’t sense a presence, or hear the screeching that he had come in contact with the day before. Just as he was about to tell Dean, he heard it. A small, fragile voice asking for help. It was far away still, but Cas could hear them clear as day.
As they kissed, the buttons on Cas’s shirt found themselves undone and the shirt was frantically discarded in its entirety, along with the offensive undershirt.
Dean snorted before grabbing hold of the angel’s outstretched hand. “Never change, Cas. Never change.”
Zachariah, the representative leader of the Great Council, finished greeting everyone and welcoming them to the meeting. He stated their agenda for the day’s meeting: as usual, mission distribution, a few announcements and nothing much more. Castiel observed his superior. Zachariah stood tall and spoke with more arrogance and confidence that an angel with zero battlefield experience had any right to. No one particularly liked  him, but questioning his authority was not a thought that could ever go through their minds.
Castiel turned towards the beat up doors of the bar and took a steadying breath. As he pushed in the bar, he was surprised by what he found inside. There seemed to be just a normal crowd, drinking, playing pool, talking, etc. He had expected something a bit more... Angelic? He shook his head as if to clear his thoughts.
“Damn Cas, not for nothing but Ronny’s isn’t necessarily a revelation” Dean teased through a nervous chuckle.
"I'll do it" Castiel's voice rang across the room as everyone else became quiet. He made his way out of his seat, walking slowly to report in front of Zachariah. He looked the other angel in the eye and spoke.
"Alright, alright keep it in your pants you have a mission"
“Maybe I could join you?” the angel asked, his voice rough with obvious arousal, but still with a hint of hesitation. The suggestion made Dean’s thoughts stop in their tracks. His mouth was suddenly suspiciously dry, and the warmth he had felt in his heart was starting to spread… elsewhere. There were about a million words he would have loved to say in that moment, but the first one that came out of his mouth was certainly the last one he thought he would say.
Gabriel smirked and snapped his fingers. Castiel felt an unidentifiable tug at his back and a sudden burst of wind behind him, though when he looked back all he saw was black. Midnight black feathers covering the wings that portruded from his shoulder blades. A strangled gasp almost whimper fell from his throat and he looked back at Gabriel in an expression of horror as the archangel smirked and spoke again. His voice was merely a rumble in the white noise Castiel was hearing but he still caught the archangel's words.
“My favorite toy Hummu was taken by the waves, so I went to grab her but-” Maria stops and curls into herself, hugging her knees to her chest. Tears start to stream down her face.
“The ones that Cortez took from me.” Her voice broke as soon as she uttered Cortez’s name, as if the mere mention of the Spanish conquistador’s name brought her back to her living days. “These children may not be
“Morning kid. Make sure you grab some of these uh
-----------------
“In 400 meters turn right.” the screeching voice of the GPS cut through the car’s silence. It felt like a sign if Dean had ever seen one. For the first time in his life, he did as the universe told him to do, and turned right. They all stared in wonder as the hot asphalt road turned into gravel paths that ground against the wheels. A canopy of giant trees slowly enveloped the sky above them until their bright sunny day turned cloudy and full of fog. Cas lowered his car window and felt the fresh breeze hit his face.
“Yes…” Cas adds hesitantly. “I did enjoy kite flying in my favorite Heaven. I can’t believe you remember that Dean.” Cas adds breathlessly and smiles softly at the hunter. Dean can’t meet his eyes, a warm blush spreading through his face.
Castiel pondered for a moment. He finally spoke a bit stronger this time. "Alright. What was the price?"
Today, as he had many times before, Castiel found himself patrolling through the corridors, wishing with all his grace to take a glimpse inside the mysterious and alluring doors.
"Why don't we just kill them both?" Balthazar, a long time friend of Castiel, suggested. It made sense he would make this suggestion, he was known for being a good, yet carefree fighter. Many angels held some respect for him. For this reason, some angels nodded in agreement, with murmurs being heard around the room.
“Back when I lived in Heaven, there was one human’s heaven I particularly enjoyed visiting. An autistic man and his perfect Tuesday afternoon. He would fly kites and enjoy the summer breeze. I enjoyed watching him at peace.”
Yet, that is exactly what he did. As kept going deeper into the dark realm, he felt his grace start to burn within him. It wasn't a painful burn, more like it was sensing something around him, something powerful. The more his grace burned, the easier it was to fight off that creatures that came to him like moths attracted to light.
Sam hums. “Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Those are the ‘Cuevas de Arenales’ they are normally a tourist spot, but there’s some areas that have been closed off for safety reasons.”
That was what he, wasn’t he? He was a problem to the Empty. He was a problem to Heaven and Hell. There was only one place in the universe Cas didn’t feel like an issue in. Unsurprisingly, that place seemed to be Winchester-shaped. He would always choose them because they were the first to have ever truly chosen him back. The hope that blossomed in his chest was dangerous, but he needed to succeed. He needed to go back, there was still so much he wanted to do.
It was as he stood there, within his favorite Human Heaven, watching the waving of the autistic man's kite on a sunny Thursday afternoon, that Cas realized just how much he needed to sacrifice in order to save his family. Dean and Sam were everything that he needed to protect, vessels that could mean the end or the safety of the entire universe. No, more than that - they were his brothers in arms. His leaders in the endless fight for the safety and protection of his one true love: Humanity.
Sam looks at his son and finds his face full of curiosity. “Of course Jack, what’s up?”
“Yeah well, uh no biggie.” Dean stands quickly, rubbing the back of his neck. He seems to need some distance between himself and Cas suddenly. Sam rolls his eyes and chuckles.
He looked around himself once more. Trees seemed greener, grass softer under him, leaves flowed slower in the wind which rasped an amazing chill down his spine. He was alive. He was given his second chance. As he stood to bask in the mid-morning sun, a figure appeared in front of him as if from thin air, he had heard a strange ruffle before almost like the sound a bird makes when it lands.
“Empty.”
“Well,” Dean clears his throat and turns on the ignition. “Let’s go gank a bitch and eat some ice cream.”
“Night Dean,” Jack said sweetly, which made Dean smile and hug his son back before his teary-eyed gaze could give him away. He cleared his throat and gave Jack a pat on the back “Night, kid,” he answered.
Support Me:
To this day, that has been Castiel's easiest order to follow. He knew that was the moment he had begun to see Dean in a whole new light. It was a while before he could say the same for Sam, but he did have some fond recollections from that earlier time.
The hunter pushed Cas backwards until he was pinned against the countertop, his legs spreading slightly so that Dean could slot between them. He was very pleased to find that Cas shared his enthusiasm for their kisses as he pressed his hips a little harder against the former angel and received an equally frantic grind back.
“Goodnight, Sam.”
The first fight: “
“Yeah, trust me I’ve been trying to fix that for years.” Sam chuckles.
He was in the middle of getting dressed for his 9th party in 2 months. He looked in the mirror, big green orbs staring at him back from a sea of freckles lightly dusted all over his body. He had lost some of his tan he noted. 'Gotta get back to the beach soon, too much work not enough play'
He was interrupted from his thoughts by a new set of double doors appearing seemingly out of thin air. They were big, tall brown wooden doors and Gabriel was inviting him through them. As he stepped through he was greeted by the warm sunlight and breeze hitting his face. He felt a hint of nostalgia ghost around in the back of his mind but he pushed it away he was still alive, just in a different way. He looked around, they seemed to be in a park of some kind, right in the middle of the sandbox. The trees looked nice and green and the force of the truth hit him once more. He was alive.
“It’s me Dean, it’s really me,” his voice broke as he let his tears flow freely. He was so close to his happy ending, he wouldn’t let Dean’s paranoia ruin this for them. He offered himself up to the hunter’s tests of silver and holy water and passed each with flying colors. Once Dean saw the tests had passed, he hesitated in front of Cas, unsure of what to do next. The hunter within him wanted to throw this imposter out of their home before it could hurt them. Yet, the hopeful part of his soul, the one that had been badly beaten and bruised when Cas disappeared, desperately ached to collapse into his friend’s arms.
“No, they were close but never in the water. All of the parents say that they saw them one moment and the next they were just gone. No sign of them anywhere.” Carlos added, taking a swig from the cup of coffee he had left on the table.
“It is nice to see him enjoying himself,” Cas muttered as he stared at their son, smiling as Jack struggled to keep his grip on the kite against the strength of the wind. The kid snapped his fingers and the string became firmly attached to the plastic holder, which made it easier to fly. Jack grinned, pleased with himself. Sometimes it paid off to have some power-ups.
Cas didn’t know how much longer he would be able to take. The eternal darkness that surrounded him never seemed to end. He was sure he had been walking for days now. No idea if he was heading in the right direction, or just aimlessly walking around in circles.
Cas blushed even further as he slowly brought his hands up to cup Dean’s jaw. He stared into those earthy-green eyes and smiled before pressing a chaste kiss against the hunter’s lips. “You are a work of art Dean,” he murmured softly as he slowly caressed the hunter’s cheek with his thumb, “the only thing I will miss about being an angel is being able to bask in the glory that was your soul. Nothing will ever shine as bright for me.”
“Alright, let’s go fly some kites.” Dean finished the rest of his breakfast and grabbed his keys to go.
“Cas can be really handy sometimes, right Dean?” Sam teased, his joyful eyes shining mischievously. Cas nodded and cleared his throat as he rubbed the back of his neck to hide the blush spreading across it.
''I think i kind of owe you anyway Gabriel. What do you want me to do?''
Dean managed to give Jimmy his manager's number so they could work out details.
“Think about it” Cas pleaded, “with me gone, you could have your peace again. I would never come back here”.
Dean never told him about his time over there. He didn't need to. As soon as Dean reappeared in front of him, Castiel saw everything he would ever need to right there in that cold and dark street, Dean's soul reading just like an open book.
Cas stood and started to remove his shoes and dress shirt as well. Dean turned around under the guise of modesty. In reality, he didn’t trust himself around a semi-naked Cas. Which is why he had bitched and moaned when Jack had called dibs on bunking with Sam. But, everyone knows you can’t mess with dibs, so he ended up having to room with his (not that he would admit it outloud, but devastatingly handsome) friend. When the hunter finished changing into his sleep clothes, he turned to find the angel already laying down on the bed.
Charlie noticed the change but didn't press any further knowing the news would make Dean happy anyway. "So get this, word around work this morning is that he's in prison!! Got caught being inappropriate with one of his party guests and they sued. More victims came up and he's going to be locked up for a long t-"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balthazar's smirk only widened. Castiel has begun to think this is a normal thing among Angels. Something which makes them oddly.. Human. "Darling you can't be serious. I'm sure Gabriel explained to you that you will be taking the harder jobs yes? Why do you think they are harder?"
The Winchesters were the highlights of his life, and that would never change. Yet, it was time he let them live on. If he stayed, he would only drag them into more issues and problems that they didn't deserve.
“So, Cas, what are you gonna eat?” Sam asked him over his menu. He was confused by the question, but right as he was about to answer, he felt it. A strong rumbling in his stomach that made him feel hollow and weak.
It was as he kicked the soul of a chained headless man off his shoulders, that he felt it. The intensity of the burning went beyond anything he had ever felt, yet it did not harm him. He felt a strange, ethereal pull pulsate through his entire being and just mindlessly followed its origin. There, in the midst of horrible darkness and despair, he saw it. The brightest soul he had ever laid eyes upon, the soul of Dean Winchester.
The first proclamation: “
Jack’s head tilts in confusion again. “Of course they were sleeping, what else would they be doing?
Cas reached to take the hunter’s hand underneath the table, and it made Dean jump out of his reverie. He turned to look at the former angel and then down at their joined hands. He hesitated for a moment, simply staring at their clasped hands. Cas felt the familiar rumble of nervousness settle in his gut, but it was washed away by pure happiness when he felt Dean squeeze his hand back. The hunter looked up to meet his eyes and his small smile widened and brightened his face. Cas returned the smile, along with a small squeeze of his hand and the warmth within him blossomed even more.
There seemed to be only one answer.
“Others? How long has this been going on?” Cas interrogated as he came up to join them at the register.
Dean’s hands tightened around Baby’s wheel, his knuckles turning white from the force.  “Look Cas, I know that when you...
“Can I drive?”
The angel met his gaze and they both descended into unconsciousness.
At the mention of volunteers, the room visibly stilled. No one dared move, less it be mistaken as interest. Angels knew their place, they had heard the stories of angels sent to Hell who never returned. None dared to risk it, not for some lowly human they knew little about.
Cas tensed, wishing he had his angel blade, anything to defend himself. He wanted to run, he never wanted to see this monster again. But, there had to be another way, another deal, a way out. If not, the entity would have fulfilled that wish of killing him already. Cas told It as much.
Sam huffs “Yeah buddy, I am sure you can. But you don’t have to. Come on.” Sam stood and closed Jack’s laptop. The kid relents and let himself be led over to his bed.
Still, Castiel was a dreamer. He longed for something different, something more. He longed to spend time with Dean. To truly know him, not just the Dean he had come to observe from afar. Castiel waited for the upper ornaments to leave him alone to perform their duties, as he usually did, before moving to the far end of his perch. This was his routine every year. Take care of the ornament’s troubles, look after the tree’s health, give some orders and then just sit and wait until he could catch another glimpse of Dean again. Maybe that is why, when he saw Dean hesitate by his branch instead of leaving to visit family, Castiel made the first mistake of his whole existence. He leaned too close to the edge.
Dean thought to himself as he threw the keys at his son. Cas’s eyes went wide at the exchange, but he still managed to break into a goofy smile that Dean could not quite look at without a sudden warmth rising in his cheeks. Sam smiled knowingly at his brother, and gave him their hacked credit card. Dean decided to ignore his brother’s smartass grin.
Dean sighed before he continued, “I guess I just want to let you know that I want to pick up where we left off. You know, if you want to.” The hunter cleared his throat nervously, trying to keep his eyes on the road, and squeezing the steering wheel a bit harder than he needed to. The silence was killing him, he needed to know if Cas was on the same page. What if-
Dean’s eyes widen, an electric pulse coming from where the angel was touching him. The hunter tries to lie to himself. “Yeah, uh good cover.” He fails.
“We barely know each other” Dean murmurs, his gaze fixed on the impossible angel before him.
“Here,” Dean said as he held the slice between them, “I’ll even take a bite out of it too, as an act of solidarity.” His brow wiggled suggestively in his most ridiculous attempt to make the angel try the pizza.
Castiel pleaded with them, trying to make them understand that they were only making this goodbye harder. He was interrupted as Dean finally spoke up.
“Oh, SPARE ME” the entity screamed, its voice crackling like static in Cas’s ears. “I don’t care about that, I care about getting rid of you so I can enjoy my peaceful sleep,” It added as It began to rise from the throne, coming to stand right in front of the angel.
Once they reached the wall, Dean decided to throw caution to the wind and asked the question that had been running through his mind, “So, are we going to talk about how you ended up like a floor pancake?”
Just as Dean was about to ask him about it, there was a knock at the door. Cas got up to answer it, and let Sam and Jack walk inside with a small nod. Sam had a warm, post-workout glow, and Jack was still rubbing the sleep from his eyes. Dean smiled and waved at both of them. Sam nodded at both of them and made his way to the table, following the delicious smell.
. Sam and Jack tried to calm the hunter down, but he kept pushing them all away.
“I’m sorry, he’s uh still in training.” Dean intervenes and everyone seems to settle down, but not without reluctance.
Charlie closed the door and turned back to Dean with a smirk. She saw how the two men looked at each other and oh this was going to be fun.
The voice was a smooth sound with a thick British accent straight out of the 1800s. He stood back from the man in front of him in shock. Castiel had never been... Flirted with before. He wasn't sure if to fight or run in horror.
“Okay, maybe you’re right. I should get some rest. My vision is getting blurry.” The boy grabs his bag from under the bed and gets his pajamas out. They’re the fluffy cowboy pajamas that Dean picked out for him. He smiles. “But first, I have a question!”
“I don’t think you came to the kitchen just to wash some dishes.” Cas stated, his voice barely above a whisper as he got closer to the hunter.
They spent a long while talking and catching up until Charlie's phone rang. She answered with a bright smile. "Thanks for calling LARP Supplies and Beyond, this is Charlie speaking"
“Google Maps says we should be there in fifteen” replied Sam as he turned to look at their son. “Maybe we should stop and get some snacks first. We are gonna be there a while.”
be happy, he was dragged back here. Only to be left in the darkest depths of the Empty, completely and utterly alone. He had been shoved into his own prison, and the entity had thrown away the key. It was during moments like these that Cas wished for the comfort of sleep. But, he knew that being awake was a blessing in disguise.
Castiel blinked, he seemed shocked for some reason that Dean couldn’t quite place. He cleared his throat, “Yes,” He jumped up and started dusting off his coat, his hands shaking “-I am alright… I think. Where are we?” he asked, looking up towards the tree.
A tense silence overcomes the room. Edgar cuts through the silence as he clears his throat and shifts towards his computer. “The batteries are for the nanny cam that was installed inside. The bear belonged to the third victim. His parents set up a couple of them around their house to keep an eye on the kids.” He pulled up a video and turned the laptop to face the hunters.
The sky was tinged a light blue, with the sun shining softly over its tropical domain. Out the window, the trees swayed in the warm breeze as he passed them by. The thrum of the engine beating at once with his heartbeat. Both his mechanical and physical selves becoming one. All the while, he is tapping the steering wheel in a cruel mockery of rhythm. The song is not important now, only the feeling it evokes. There’s a breeze that softly tickles at each of his senses. He can feel the sand rasping delicately across his fingers as he places his hand out the car window. He can smell the sea salt coming from the coast. The water is so close to the road that he can almost taste it.
“Yeah, you’re right. Something just doesn’t sit right with this case.” Dean muttered, sitting on the remaining bed and untying his shoes. He sat there for a while, his elbows resting on his knees staring at the laces of his shoes. “Those marks didn’t look written on, they were
Later that Christmas day, Chuck would walk into his living room once more, and find the Dean and Cas ornaments sitting proudly upon Castiel’s perch wrapped in each other's arms. As it was meant to be.
The dirt path wound around the entire rainforest and was frequented by many spelunkers and tourists. It was a popular path because of how closely the canopy covered the road. Large, oak-like trees towered over everyone that walked in the path, even over a giant moose like Sam. Gigantic spade-shaped leaves bent down from the weight of the morning dew collecting on their surface. Drops of water falling could be heard all around them and gave the whole space a constant illusion of rainfall. The air was crisp and cool, which only served to refresh them as they walked. The sun glimmered against every raindrop and made the entire forest seem resplendent.
"Hell Cas, I need- no... Dammit I.. I love you Cas. So, I am begging you here, don't leave us just like every other godforsaken person I have ever loved. Don't you dare leave."
''Look, just in case, you do know that you cant go back to any family you might have had right? You can keep your name and that's about it. You are not Castiel Novak any more though, from now on you are just Castiel." Gabriel was now looking at the new angel, sizing him up, wondering if he had done the right thing saving him.
And then Dean moved. The soft love and longing quickly turned into pure lust with that first thrust. All of their poetic thoughts thrown out the window and replaced by a grueling need to just get impossibly closer. A guttural need for Dean to feel every inch of Cas inside him. A need for Cas to do everything in his power to worship Dean. The sound of skin hitting skin flooded the entire room as Dean bounced harder and harder on top of Cas, the angel gripping his hips tightly. He pushed up into every one of Dean’s thrusts, relishing the moans he managed to rip out of his lover’s throat. He catalogued every whimper, moan and scream and committed them to memory, for future reference.
He arrived at Charlie's office a little after 5pm. It was a nice building in town with lots of 'nerd stuff' as decoration in the lobby. He smiled and thought how much this was fitting for Charlie. He arrived at the door to Charlie's office after being led by a very hot young woman. When Charlie came to greet him he raised his brow at how Charlie looked at the woman. She blushed and muttered something about 'a new assistant from upstairs.'
She waved her hand dismissively and shushed him as she gave him a warm smile that left small crinkles next to her eyes. “Don’t you worry, just make sure to stop by again before your little vacation ends.” And with that, she stepped back and started gesturing for the next customer to come over. “Now go, you don’t want to be the reason Don Jose here doesn’t get his morning
Chapter 5: Strings
The first Us vs. the world: “
There is something on Cas’s face, a feeling, that Dean can’t quite place. He walks up and joins the angel on the windowsill. There is a bit of snow covering the soil outside. There are a few families enjoying the light snowfall on their front lawns, the kids playing with their new Christmas toys. The world is peaceful, beyond the confines of their tree. Dean wishes he could take Cas out there someday. Have their own adventure without worrying about a cursed deadline.
They had fought tooth and nail to get here. To their happy ending, their curtain drop, their peaceful retirement. Even as Dean placed Cas back on the ground and led him by the hand all the way back to Cas’s room, he found himself thinking of everything they had gone through together. Every fight, death, apocalypse, and betrayal that should have separated them forever, only found a way to bring them closer than before. As the door to his bedroom shuts and Cas makes his way towards the bed, Dean counts himself lucky. Not every hunter gets a good ending, yet here he was. The righteous man that never thought he deserved to be saved, making his way to praise at the altar of the angel that had pulled him out of Hell several lifetimes ago.
Dean turns the keys in the ignition of his rental car and parks it. He takes a moment to check his phone: 7:15 am and still nothing. If he can get their damn breakfast before Sammy gets back from his run he should be in the clear. Grabbing his wallet, he steps out of the car and flinches at the loud sound the alarm makes. This is why he hates new cars, he would take his Baby over this pile of-
After they had finished putting away the trash and washing the few dishes that were left in the sink, Dean came up behind Cas and wrapped his arms around his waist, resting his chin on his shoulder. Cas smiled and finished drying off the last plate in his hands before turning to face the hunter.
How could Dean forget? Just the name sent an unwanted shiver down his spine. "yeah" he said trying to control the disgust in his voice.
Cas’s gaze fell to his feet, which were half-covered by slithering, black goo. The Empty was right. No matter what he did, he would always end up here. Much like Lucifer had promised Dean all those years ago. Everything would always lead him here. Unless…
“What do you mean It didn't
“Where are you going?” The nephilim asked over a sip from his ceramic cup.
Dean nodded, taking in the information. “Well then, let’s find the bastard that is doing this and bring the fight to them.”
Cas stood and made his way to the window. The sky was a beautiful, yet clouded blue outside. The view from their room was limited, but it did have one feature that the angel liked. A huge
“What the hell are you talking about Cas?” Dean demands, getting closer to the angel. Their eyes meet in an impromptu staring contest. Cas breaks their silence first by reaching out to grab the hunter’s hand. He tries to communicate what he means without words, unable to utter them again out loud. Sam is the first to understand.
"Castiel! Where are you? The meeting in the Hall is about to start! The council is getting restless, please hurry!"
“Dean, I think I have something,” Sam announced as he stood and made his way over to the couch his brother was sitting on. “Apparently they found two of the children a couple of hours ago. Alive.” He turned his laptop to face his brother.
He decided to channel his nervous energy into something productive and walked towards the sink and started to wash anything in sight. Just as Dean had started to anxiously wash the few dishes that had been left in the sink, he heard footsteps come up behind him. The soft clack of dress shoes against the bunker floor had become a characteristic sound for the hunter. It could only mean one thing.
Dean assured Edgar he would stay in touch and faced Jack as he tilted his head towards the exit indicating it was time to go. Jack left with a small salute to the detectives, which they returned hesitantly.
Cas peers over Dean’s shoulder to glance at the map and then looks forward on their path. “Yes, there’s a shortcut if we veer off the path further ahead.” The angel adds while standing up. “Once we reach the cave, we can track her down from there. I’ll try to sense her presence with my grace.” Cas holds out a hand to Jack with a reassuring smile. “Maybe you can help me with that?” Jack takes his father’s hand and nods, a stern look on his features. “Of course, I will try my best.”
Cas walked over to Jack and gingerly took the book from his lap and set it aside on the nightstand. The angel removed his trenchcoat and draped it over his son’s sleeping form. There was a peaceful smile on his face, even as he slept.
, Castiel thought, but something within him recoiled at the idea of lying to Dean. With one last look to ensure that they were as alone as they could get, Castiel spoke.
"I know we won. I’m glad, but I have no place here on Earth. I am an angel," Cas tried, begging the universe that  they would understand why he needed to do this.
Charlie recognized that Dean wanted the subject to be left alone so she did. "Yeah I don't have much else to say but listen Dean, I would love it if you could come by today? I want to see you, it's been too long man."
Dean smiled at her and thanked her for the food before replying. “Yeah, well I made a promise to come back before we left. I couldn’t break a sacred promise with such a beautiful woman” he added, the smooth flirtation coming easily to the hunter. She tapped him lightly on his shoulder, with a blush.
They all made their way through the small store, grabbing snacks and drinks for the road. Dean went straight for the cheap beer, and Cas was thoughtfully regarding some honey-flavored candy in the back. Jack followed Dean around the store like a small puppy, grabbing all the nougat candy bars he could find.
son. After all, bringing everyone together was the entire purpose of this family vacation. Speaking of which, judging by the time, Sam suspected that Cas and Dean might have gone back to vacation mode. The sun had already set, yet still no word from them. He decided to shoot them a follow-up text just to make sure they were okay. With a frown forming on his face, Jack closed yet another lore book that was fruitless in their search. He rubbed his eyes and tried to hold back a yawn.
Jimmy arrived an hour later. Charlie went out to say hi and introduce herself. When they came back into the office Dean jumped up from his chair and gasped.
Cas and Dean watched as Sam and Jack disappeared towards their respective rooms, a tense silence blooming between them. They were alone now. Sure, they had been alone in the car, but somehow this felt different. It felt almost intimate, sitting next to each other at the war room table, only the low grumble of the bunker’s air conditioning between them.
“Dean? Are you still awake?” Sam’s voice came through the wooden door, destroying the frail hope Dean had held in his heart.
“We have the kids the bastard let go. They are not talking much though.” Carlos supplies.
“Well, he is still an angel, Dean, but he is way stronger than you give him credit for. You should have seen him fight for me in that abandoned church!” Jack replied. Yet, even as he smiled at the fond memory, he remembered what Sam had said to him a couple weeks after he was back. He had asked him exactly the same question Dean had now, only Sam had already known the true answer. Jack paused, unsure if he should confess what he knew to Dean. Some forbidden knowledge that he was certain not even Dean himself quite knew yet. From the corner of his eye he saw Dean’s worried face and decided he couldn’t keep quiet. He had to at least try.
“You should write a book Cas. You are downright poetic.” Dean chuckled, breaking away from their trance.
“I-, I did” Castiel confirmed, looking at his shoes with an unreadable expression. He didn’t seem to want to elaborate on what had gone wrong and Dean certainly wasn’t going to push him. Dean didn’t know what he should say, so he kept quiet and waited for the angel to give him instructions. Or whatever it was that Castiel usually did.
"What's up Deanny-O!! You ready for this awesome party??"
Once they returned to the car, Dean called Sam and filled him in on what he had seen. They agreed to meet up either at the hotel or a diner to get something to eat once they had finished interviewing the victims. They could decide later, per Sam’s request. Dean hung up the phone, looked at Jack sitting in the passenger seat and grinned.
, I’m kinda new ‘round here.” He gestured at the beginning of a sunburn forming on the bridge of his nose from falling asleep on the beach the day before.
“We already ate ice cream, Dean. I am not sure I am in the mood for more food?” Cas says as his brow furrows in confusion. He stares at the seafood shack in front of them.
Sam hesitated, before gently asking: “Well, if he made that deal, then why did the Empty wait until now to collect?”
tree that was in full bloom. Its bright red flowers seemed like something taken straight from Heaven.
“I wasn’t going to mention it,” Castiel continued lamely, his intense gaze resting on the hunter’s blushing face. The freckles were even more obvious under his quickly reddening cheeks. Cas tried fruitlessly to remedy what was quickly becoming an awkward situation. Dean simply cleared his throat and nodded before quickly continuing on their path up the tree.
“Well, Jack there’s many reasons for why someone would do it. It’s our job to find the monsters that do.” Sam offered as an explanation and a hopeful escape to the actual scarier answers.
“Heh, yeah didn’t want Sammy to start naggin’ me again” Dean chuckled nervously, his hands washing the plate in a steady circle over and over again. A small smile appeared on Cas’s face as he came up to join Dean at the sink.
The entity stared at him for what felt like eons. There was an intense hatred burning in its eyes, yet there was something else there too. It almost seemed like it wanted to take him up on his offer. The air between them was tense, Cas could practically feel It thinking. The entity rolled its eyes and set Cas back down on the floor.
That was all it took. With just those words, Cas knew he had gained so much more than a friend. So much more than a life and a family. He had always had brothers and sisters, but now he knew, he had a home.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas kissed back with every bit of ferocity that he had stored within himself for all the years that he had been in existence. Dean couldn’t help but smile into their kiss, his hands roaming across the former angel’s back, moving downwards slowly, but deliberately. The uncut tension radiated from both of them, fueled by the soft whimpers that Cas was letting out as Dean bit his lip softly.
A smell that was currently overwhelming, enveloping the air around him. That was enough to snap Cas out of his thoughts and realize his daydream had resulted in said hunter hurling a t-shirt at his face. He smiled to himself, it seemed like their own kind of an inside joke. Cas held the shirt against his chest and looked at Dean questioningly.
After an eternity, Dean sighed and a small smile decorated his features. Cas angled his head to look at him and felt his heart stop. The hunter was flushed, his hair messed up every which way and his eyes were barely open. He was the most gorgeous man Cas had ever seen.
“And here I was thinking that you had a thing for that pizza man,” Dean teased as he wriggled his brow.
The realization hit him like a freight train at full speed. In a second, their entire friendship flashed through his mind.
. A single look at the pure hunger in Dean’s face told him that he wasn’t the only one that felt that way.
(See the end of the chapter for
. He walked slowly back to lean against the counter, slowly slid down until he was sitting right next to where Cas had disappeared from. He wasn’t looking at anyone anymore. His forest green eyes were unfocused, tears fighting to make their way to the surface. His hands shifted towards the floor, as if touching the black stain left behind would let him be closer to Cas.
Dean’s gaze dropped to the floor, the stark reminder of everything Cas had lost suddenly forcing its way to the forefront of his mind. “I'm sorry you had to give that up Cas,” he whispered earnestly.
With all the effort he could muster, he put some distance between them. “Cas, I need to stop man, I really fucking need a shower,” Dean grumbled, as he tried to ignore the angel’s soft whimper in protest. His heart clenched, but he still managed to grab the clothes he had been looking for and headed towards the bathroom. It wasn’t until he almost reached the bathroom door that he realized there were steps following him. He turned to find Cas staring at him, his pupils blown wide. There was an adorable blush delicately frosting his cheeks and nose. He looked like he was mulling over a specific question in his head. Dean wanted to kiss him again.
They both sat down in chairs facing each other and the man spoke.
Jack is sitting in the passenger seat, contently looking out the window. “I enjoy watching the palm trees go by. There’s something different about driving here.” His voice is pure awe.
Excitare et gaudere
“Are you getting anything from angel radio?” Dean whispered as he neared Cas, trying to keep the noises they made to a minimum. Considering they were dealing with a vengeful spirit, they wanted to try and maintain some form of the element of surprise.
A single ray of sunlight peered through the window, landing on Dean’s face. He stirred and a small grumble erupted from his chest. He felt warm. Perhaps a little too warm. Weird, he didn’t remember the bed being this soft…. He certainly didn’t remember the bed
Garth was really going to pay.
for Dean. His job as an ornament was simple. All he had to do was look pretty and keep order in his portion of the tree until the clock struck 12 again and Christmas was over. The ornaments were free to roam around the tree and visit each other, as long as the humans were not around and they returned to their respective spots in time. The younger ornaments would run and play while the older ornaments, like Dean, made sure that nothing fell too far out of place. If he did his part to keep the tree alive and ordered just as he had found it when he woke, then all the ornaments would live to see another Christmas.
“Yeah, we are okay. She was about to take another poor kid, but I think Cas stopped her.” Dean added, sparing a glance in Cas’s direction.
The angel met Dean’s gaze once more, seemingly transfixed by what he found there. His gaze seemed puzzled, yet intrigued. He also had a total disregard of the limits of Dean’s personal space. Dean shifted from one leg to another under the angel’s intense gaze.
“No, I’m not tired. I can help, I can be-”  Jack trailed off into yet another yawn, his arms stretching over his head, “-useful.”
The angel shakes his head, feeling his cheeks burn with what he now understood was blush. They sat in companionable silence for a while, nothing but the warm sun and soft breeze hitting their backs.
Hey guys! Sorry for taking so long to update! Finals have been busy! I'm going on a trip so I might delay a bit again but this story definitely continues. I'm taking a break from My Dearest Blogger because of some writer's block. But feel free to check out the content I have so far! Thanks and Happy Holidays!
He quickly looked towards his hands and realized the uneven ground wasn’t goo, but hard, grass-covered dirt. The darkness around him wasn’t as empty as he thought at first. A dangerous ray of hope went through him as he dared glance up above him.
“Don’t” his brother snapped, his voice breaking slightly and making it come out less intimidating than he had hoped.
That was his breaking point. When God had burned his son’s soul away to the Empty, he had burned every shred of hope left within Cas. That pain had seared into his vessel and had left a permanent scar. The same scar that had made Cas wake up to check on Jack as he slept at night, and the one that made him wrap a hundred scarves around Jack’s neck if it was chilly outside. This memory seared off what was left of his body, igniting the pitch black walls of the Empty around him. The Empty was an oil drum and he was the match.
Even as that thought went through his head, another voice (one that sounded suspiciously like Sam) argued back:
He gestured to the brothers and silently asked them to follow him. The angel used his grace to sense further down their path, trying to pinpoint the source of the cry.
how Chuck had designed the story to go. Those were not the actions of an angel under his control. An angel with its own mission could prove to be his downfall one day if he wasn’t careful. Chuck knew this. This world had gone rogue and nearly slipped past his fingertips. He was no longer its sole writer.
“Is that blood?” he questioned frantically before leaning to inspect Dean’s foot. He forced Dean to show him the wound, which had started bleeding more than the hunter had realized. “What the fuck Dean, what did you do?” Sam demanded, as he tore one of the bedsheets to start wrapping around his brother’s foot.
. “Yes, its Cas. How did you know?”
“We’re pretty much under the tree. You, uh, fell?” Dean answered hesitantly, terrified that he might anger Castiel.
“Cas, we can’t-” Dean starts, but the words fall flat in the space between them. He knows there are reasons why they shouldn’t, but somehow none of them come to mind.
