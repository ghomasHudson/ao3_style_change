Did anyone see Dean's plan coming? If so, leave a comment about when you first got suspicious he was preparing to pop the question; I'd love to know what you picked up on! (I asked all my editors this and they all had different answers)
“She already gets mad enough when I do something that doesn’t fit into her perfect vision of me, I don’t want to know what she would do if Michael told her,” Castiel confided.
Dean quietly got out of bed and padded over to the kitchen. The coast was clear and he got to work making a sandwich. He didn't notice the door open and a red head slip in. He reached up to grab a plate out of the cupboard and his sleeves fell a few inches.
Dean returned his lips to Cas’s and Cas instinctively started rocking his hips down onto Dean’s. He could feel the blond man’s erection pressed against his own.
The school day seemed to drag on for Castiel. He was still pretty bitter about having to change schools, so he kept to himself and didn't survey his classmates like he ordinarily would. As he walked down the hallway, he would get weird looks from other students. Being the new kid sucked. At least the day was almost over.
“Aww, Cas, that is so cute!” Charlie squealed. He rolled his eyes and opened the front door. What he didn’t notice was Charlie switching to the camera app on her phone. He hung Charlie and his jackets up in the closet. On the broom handle was another note.
"Consider them payback for awkward family movie night," Dean said in reference to the hickeys before silencing them both with a kiss. One of Cas' hands remained in Dean's hair while the other travelled down to grope his ass. Cas loved Dean's ass, and Dean knew it.
, no less! - to find out my son is in the hospital. And now you’re telling me I’m not allowed to know what happened?”
His father had bought him a brand new suit for the occasion. It was fairly run-of-the-mill: all black, single-breasted, with a blue silk tie. Nothing super fancy. He slowly put in on, dreading the upcoming events of the day. He really didn’t want to see Naomi. Not now...probably not ever again.
“Aww, Dean-o. Are you scared you’re gonna lose and prove that you’re the worst player here? I mean, I wasn’t sure about Charlie inviting you and Cassie, but at least
“Dean,” Castiel started. One cold look his way caused Castiel to stop in his tracks. Dean slowly looked back towards his task as he threw in dirty clothes. The older man sighed and looked towards the kitchen, noticing a bunch of grocery bags strewn across the floor. He got to work putting everything away, trying desperately to think of something - anything - to say to Dean.
When he woke up, his room was darker than normal. He checked his phone and was shocked that it was already past noon. He checked the weather app and understood why he’d been able to sleep for so long. It was overcast, the threat of snow very prominent. The sun was completely blocked by heavy clouds, casting everything in a gloomy light.
Dean sighed once more. They really had been dragging this out for quite some time. He had an idea on how to end it so that everyone who had bet on them (for or against) would eat their words. He just needed a little extra time. And he couldn’t have Balthazar flirting with his boyfriend.
better way to wake up.” They grinned at each other and continued trading slow kisses on the bed. When Cas wasn’t as sensitive, he rolled Dean onto his back and seated himself in Dean’s lap.
At her coworkers’ hums of approval, she pressed on, “ok, so instead of picking teams like we usually do, I thought it would be a bit more fair to our new-comers if we played one round as a sort of free-for-all. Then, the top two players can be, like, team captains and pick the teams we’ll have for the rest of the night,” she suggested. When she heard no protests, she went to grab the supplies they’d need for the first game.
Dean smiled wide and kissed Cas one last time. He backed towards the bar as Castiel drove off the lot. Once he got inside, he found Benny and walked up next to him.
The ceremony passed by in a blur, and all at once, Castiel was hosting his graduation party at his new house. After his father’s divorce, Naomi sold the house and the Novaks were forced to move. If Castiel were being honest, he liked this place a lot better than the old one.
“Yeah, you guys totally acted like you hated each other in the beginning!” Jo added, “what with the whole ‘Cas is stuck up’ and ‘Dean is the messiest eater alive’.”
“Woah, slow down there, mate,” Balthazar cautioned. Dean sighed and started staring out the window again.
The next day, Castiel practically ran out of the school building after the final bell rang. He hadn’t paid attention to a single word any of his teachers had said all day. He was too busy playing out his mastermind plan in his head. He didn’t know how he was going to survive tomorrow. Balthazar was arriving tonight, his favorite holiday was tomorrow, and he was hosting the party of the year. It was shaping up to be one of the best days of his life.
“Did Dean Winchester just use the phrase ‘throw me for a loop’?” Cas teased. He was shut up in the form of kisses.
An hour later proved that the two were an even match. With their spirits –and their wallets – a little lighter, they went to the local bar for some dinner and a round of drinks. Long after their meals had been consumed, the pair still hogged the booth, catching up on the past few months.
“You’ve been through a hell of a lot, but you handled everything with grace I haven’t seen since…” he trailed off, thinking of his first wife. “All that and you still graduated with honors. Keep up like that, and the world is yours for the taking.”
Balthazar had kept himself around the bar. A self-proclaimed heavy-weight, Balthazar needed a few more drinks to ‘feel something’ than his peers. Castiel and Balthazar usually had a pre-party tradition before they went out, but Castiel had been a bit too busy with Dean to complete it before the guests had started pouring in. Since then, Cas had been too busy playing host and putting out fires to pay too much attention to the Brit. Balthazar was a little disappointed, but understood the duties of a host. Afterall, at his own graduation party, he hadn’t even been able to talk to Castiel until the party was over and a majority of the guests had left.
“What did I say about the kitchen?” she started. Castiel rolled his eyes and put his phone in his pocket.
"If Aiden's eating with us then I'm assuming there are meatballs involved as well," Castiel asked knowingly. Aiden wouldn't eat spaghetti unless there were meatballs.
"Fuck," he said to himself. He grabbed a towel and patted his face until it was dry, walked to the foyer to put on his boots and a jacket, grabbed his keys and left the house. He drove around the block a few times, drowning out his thoughts with classic rock. About twenty minutes later, feeling a lot calmer, he pulled into the driveway and turned off his car. He rested his head in the steering wheel and let out a slow breath. That was one of the worst fights Cas and he had ever gotten into. And he was the asshat who took it too far. God, Dean hoped this wouldn't escalate into something bigger than him sleeping on the couch for a few nights.
Dean orders a cheese burger and a beer and Cas orders the same. They make small talk about their backgrounds, Dean mostly talking about his younger brother, Sam.
Castiel rolled his eyes as he shifted so he could get his pants all the way off. He chucked them to the side as Dean crawled onto the bed next to him. Cas reached out and thumbed over Dean’s lips. The physics teacher swung a leg over his partner’s to sit in his lap. They made out for another few long, heated minutes.
“Dean Winchester, do not speak with food in your mouth. I raised you better,” Mary admonished. Dean lowered his gaze, squeaking out a small apology.
“Clothes off,” he instructed, stepping out of his pants and unbuttoning his shirt completely. He took his godforsaken tie that he could
I was listening to Kick It To Me by Sammy Rae (hence the chapter title), so if you wanted the vibe I would recommend giving it a listen!
“So, this is basically like charades, but it’s an app on your phone. The guesser holds it up on their forehead as it displays the word they have to guess. The rest of the team has to make that person say whatever is on the screen. If you get it right, just tilt the phone down quickly. If the guesser would like to pass the word, they just tilt the phone up,” she explained. They all nodded; the game was pretty easy to understand.
“Yeah,” he said, “just...remembering my early twenties.” They walked into the building and had to push their way through the crowd to the bar. Apparently, this band was a local favorite.
After a moment, Cas started rolling his hips. He pulled back slightly to look at Dean’s face. His eyes were closed, his mouth was slightly parted, and his hair was far messier than Cas had ever seen it.
“I swear, these two are blind,” Charlie complained to Gabriel one morning before school started. He laughed and pulled the sucker out of his mouth with a pop.
in my son’s phone?” he whispered sharply. Naomi brushed him off with a wave of her hand. Sam could not believe what he was hearing. He knew Cas’ mom...step-mom was strict. But a
"I said nothing about nailing him. But, yeah...no we haven't really talked about much in our person lives. I guess it just hasn't come up. And there is no way in hell you're sending him anything."
"I'm gonna have to wear a long sleeve shirt tomorrow," Dean complained."Do you know how much shit I'm gonna get from Charlie?" He asked. Cas just laughed and snuggled closer into Dean.
“Uh, yeah, they did a little more than that,” Alfie said, a laugh evident in his voice. Dean pulled his eyebrows together in confusion.
“No, Bart,” Anna checked to make sure they were alone and lowered her voice for good measure, “Castiel is in the hospital.”
“Dean,” she prompted gently, bringing his mind to join them at the dinner table. He looked up from his phone and sheepishly pocketed it, knowing Mary’s rule about cell phones at the table.
“That was great,” Castiel said, body completely relaxed. Dean agreed wholeheartedly. After a moment, he pulled out of Cas and carefully disposed of the condom. He’d have to remember to take out the trash before his mom got home. Dean leaned off the bed and reached for a piece of clothing to wipe off their chests. Once that task had been completed, Castiel pulled back the covers and settled into Dean’s bed.
“I’m not really mad about the birthday,” Dean grumbled, eyes still trained on the snow falling outside. A long stretch of silence fell upon them as Balthazar waited patiently for Dean to elaborate. It took draining the rest of his drink, but he did elaborate.
Castiel nodded solemnly. He honestly had no idea why he brought up Dean’s father. Maybe his subconscious was trying to lash out and hurt someone so he wouldn’t be so lonely, and Dean was unfortunately the easiest for him to hurt. Maybe it was some whiny bullshit about pushing Dean away before he got too close to hurt Cas. Although, it was probably a little too late for that. Either way, he was extremely ashamed of his own actions.
“We can go inside,” Castiel said through a laugh. They carefully extracted themselves from the hammock, only coming close to tipping over the whole thing twice. Once safely on solid ground, Castiel took Dean’s hand and led them to his bedroom. He was sure to shut the backdoor and turn off all the lights as they made their way to his room. Once inside, they closed the door and Dean pushed Castiel up against it.
"Top floor, second door on the left," Balthazar said, managing to look a tad bit empathetic. Castiel sloshed to the aforementioned room, apathetic towards the mess he was making. He pulled his soaked wallet and ruined phone. He needed to replace the cell, and fast.
“Cas?” he called out. The blue eyed teen looked up from his phone to find his new friend looking back at him in confusion. Dean took a seat in the unoccupied stool next to Cas.
” She asked incredulously. At that, she and Dean broke into uproarious laughter. Castiel’s features went from furious to confused to embarrassed in all of three seconds.
“Of course, dear,” Castiel replied over his shoulder, shaking his head as he completed the task. He cleaned Dean and himself up, and dutifully put the panties in the sink. He climbed back into bed, where immediately Dean latched onto his neck. Castiel chuckled, but let Dean continue, figuring he did sort of deserve it with this little costume trick.
They didn’t have to chat too much longer, as Charlie walked in with chopsticks and what appeared to be a bag of hex nuts.
“Child abuse!” Naomi exclaimed, “that is preposterous! I will not stand here and be accused of such nonsensical things.”
Cas hung up and emerged from the bathroom. He pointedly avoided the living room, where a rather spirited political debate was taking place. And by “spirited” he meant “loud” and by “debate” he meant “echochamber”. He quietly snuck into the kitchen to grab something to drink. He’d successfully poured himself a glass of water when Anna walked up to him.
"Wasn't bad. Had a little trouble with one of the engines, but I got it all sorted out. How was your day?" Dean asked in turn.
“Uh, no,” Sam said. Dean could see a blush forming in his younger brother’s cheeks. Realization dawned on the older Winchester.
“Don’t mention it,” she said, “on second thought, mention it as much as you want,” she added with a wink. Cas smiled and took another bite of his burger. “So what even happened?” she asked, wanting to hear his side of the story. Castiel rolled his eyes.
On the other side of the wall, Gabriel shook his head. This had to be cheating, right? The bet was whether or not they would get together, not if Charlie could set them up. He thought about what might happen if Charlie got them together for their game night this weekend. Gabriel knew the effects of alcohol intimately, and he wasn’t about to lose his money on this. He decided if Charlie could ruin the sanctity of game night just to get them together, then he needed an alliance to help keep them apart.
“It was alright,” he said noncommittally, putting more focus into his task than was probably necessary.
After a rather uncomfortable meal, Sam was sent down to the den and Dean was left to clean up with Mary. They cleared the table in a loaded silence, Dean wishing with all his might that he was anywhere but in his kitchen right now. They filled the dishwasher and Mary motioned for Dean to take a seat at the dining table.
“Ah, Mary,” he greeted one of the nurses as she rounded the corner, “will you take this, please,” he asked, handing her his patient’s file. She glanced it over, and they made eye contact. She glanced at Naomi questioningly and he nodded subtly. Mary clutched the clipboard and made her way towards the nurse’s station.
“I mean, it’s her house, so I think she should get the armchair,” Dean reasoned, scratching the back of his neck. Castiel agreed and the two boys sat down on the loveseat. Charlie walked in with two bowls of popcorn; one for herself, and one for the boys to share. She smiled when she saw that they had decided to sit next to each other.
“They said we were welcome back to game night anytime,” Castiel said. Dean looked over at him and nodded, a small smile on his lips.
Naomi huffed and started walking. One officer escorted her to the front while the other hung back to get Castiel’s statement.
“Poke me again, I fucking dare you,” he taunted. Castiel couldn’t believe his eyes. He had just been punched in the face and that
“When I saw you go into the room with Amara, I went upstairs to deliberately find Balthazar. I was dancing with him like that out of...revenge? God, I’m an idiot.”
"Good morning, Dean." Castiel sits up and stretches his arms above his head. Dean can't tear his eyes away from the small strip of Cas's stomach that's exposed.
“Yeah,” Dean said distractedly, “I love you,” he tacked on, the impulse to remind Castiel of that crashing over him.
They spent a few minutes just kissing, licking into each other’s mouths as they’ve done so many times before. Dean could live until he was 130 and never get tired of kissing Cas like this.
Right before she reached out to open the front door, she noticed she was still in pajamas. She cursed and slipped back into the guest room to put on more weather-appropriate attire. After pulling on her boots, she grabbed Michael’s keys out of the bowl in the entryway and made her way towards Lawrence High.
“No,” Dean said dismally, “and Cas is-” Dean stopped himself, not sure if he wanted to get into this with Charlie.
“Did you really come twice?” Castiel asked, dragging the cloth lower to run it between Dean’s cheeks. Dean nodded, humming the affirmative. “Fuck, babe. Maybe we should use the belt more often.” Dean huffed a laugh as Castiel threw the washcloth in the hamper, going to turn off the lights before crawling into bed for the night. Cas basically had to manhandle Dean under the covers, but once he did, the man rolled onto his side and cuddled up to Cas.
-in-us’?” Dean asked, annunciating each syllable. That place sounded fancy as hell. And ridiculously snobby.
The physics teacher was the first one to make it home, after all, he was famous for his lead foot. Castiel parked his car next to Dean’s, got out, and headed up to their apartment. He took a deep breath before he pushed open the door. Besides the wet boots in the entryway, there seemed to be no sign of Dean in the apartment. The only light on being the one right above the front door. Castiel took his own shoes and jacket off before entering further.
They gathered in the living room where the youngest Winchester and his boyfriend had the game all set up and ready to go. Dean shrugged and thought that this was as good a distraction as any. He still hadn’t heard anything from Castiel. He sent off a quick text before they started just to be sure.
The alarm went off and the boys both groaned in protest. Cas turned it off and rubbed his eyes. Dean stretched a little bit, but kept his arms around his boyfriend. Castiel smiled and kissed the top of Dean’s head. He noticed they had been covered in a blanket and smiled, figuring Mary must’ve thrown it over them.
“Well, if you want to get this out of the way as much as I do, let’s get started. I think we need to be completely honest with each other if one of us is acting like a child.” He suggested.
“You know, he keeps asking me where I got my hickey,” Castiel revealed. They took slow steps, circling each other around the couch.
After spending most of the day on Charlie’s lake, she suggested they all stay and watch a movie until the firework show began. Cas usually spent his Fourth of Julys with Balthazar, but hanging out with Dean and Charlie made Castiel feel a lot less lonely. He followed his two friends inside and helped pick out a movie.
Dean glanced sideways to make sure Cas hadn’t been reading his texts over his shoulder. How embarrassing would
“You wanna know why I am so mad about Saturday night?” he asked rhetorically, “you risked...so much by going to that party,” Castiel could almost hear a quiver in Dean’s voice. “And for what? So many things could’ve gone wrong. You could’ve gotten drugged. You could’ve taken a ride from someone as plastered as you. You could’ve-” Dean had to cut himself off. He swallowed thickly and composed himself. Castiel turned his body to look at Dean. “What if Naomi would’ve caught you, huh? Do you know how hard it is for me when she takes your
Sorry for the wait, this chapter isn't quite as long, but I promise next chapter will be fantastic! Enjoy!
The teen could smell the aroma of dinner wafting through his bedroom door once his father opened it. He cursed himself for not grabbing a snack earlier. His stomach also scolded him, and he willed it to shut up. He was not about to sit down with Naomi and share a meal. He’d simply wait until she went to bed before sneaking downstairs and reheating the leftovers.
Plus, Castiel didn’t have a clue what the legal process would look like if he decided to tell the truth. Would there be a trial? What if he lost? What if they sent him back to live with Naomi and she did something
“Can’t you just leave me alone?” Dean asked, irritated with his friend. Gabe stared a hole into the side of his fellow fireman’s face.
“How the hell was I supposed to guess ‘Grape Stomping’ when it looked like you were doing an Irish jig?” the host complained. Gabriel shrugged his shoulders as Castiel was laughing too hard to give her an answer. She wasn’t wrong; they had looked ridiculous.
He opened his eyes and scanned the audience. Castiel’s breath hitched when Dean’s eyes locked with his.
He pulled out his calculus book and half heartedly went through the problems he was assigned. After about an hour, he finished the last one and shoved his book off of his bed. He took his phone off the charger and opened up his laptop.
“Umm, wait,” Cas said, halting Dean’s movements. The boy looked at Cas from above, silently asking what was wrong. Castiel swallowed and cupped the side of Dean’s face in his hand.
Cas sighed heavily and sat back in his chair. Thoughts of Dean flashed through his mind as he continued throughout his day. Part one of his road back to normalcy was complete, now he just needed to find a way to make it up to Dean.
“Don’t you fucking do that to me,” Dean said, exasperated with Cas’s recent behavior. They hadn’t had a real conversation in about a week.
“Really?” Dean asked flatly, “And my mom’s home for the whole night. Pleeeaaaasse,” Dean begged, deciding to switch tactics.
to Cas. Mary tried to protest, given that it was Christmas Eve, but she really couldn’t muster up the energy to argue. It was completely plausible something happened to Cas, and she was proud of her son for being concerned and so willing to help.
“Who is it?” Filtered a (barely) falsetto voice through the door. Cas swung open the door to reveal Dean.
He finished cleaning himself and stepped out of the shower. He walked over to the sink and wiped the fog off the mirror. As he shaved what little hair was on his face, he examined his cheek. The bruise was changing from black to that gross greenish-yellow color. He gingerly poked at it, wincing slightly when he poked too hard. He sighed and exited the bathroom to get dressed.
“Don’t be unrealistic, Balthazar. She’d never call me ‘honey’,” he quipped. They laughed at the thought of that conversation.
“Be careful, Winchester,” Gabriel warned, “wouldn’t want to see you choke.” Dean narrowed his eyes at his coworker, hardly biting back an
Balthazar took a sip of his and started, “Can I assume this has something to do with yesterday?” Dean looked at his coworker for the first time since he entered the place and sighed.
Of course, it just so happened that Dean took a seat directly across from Castiel. And that Charlie was seated at one head of the table between himself and Dean. Alfie took a seat next to Cas, and Sam sat across from Alfie. After placing the last dish on the table, Mary took her spot at the opposite head of the table.
“What are people gonna think?” Mary continued, “That I just let my teenage son be unsupervised around his significant other?”
“Oh, it’s not? Because last I remember, he was the one calling me and coming to my apartment to try to explain things for you,” Castiel said. Dean just remained silent. “Fuck you, Dean Winchester,” Castiel turned to head back towards his car.
Dean led Anna to Castiel’s room and took a deep breath before he opened the door. He sure hoped this was the right call. Cas had said that Anna was a possibility as a safe person to contact, but he wasn’t sure if that extended as a safe person to come see Cas face-to-face.
Dean was obviously just being nice, there was no reason for him to point that out. And now Dean looked a little crestfallen and slightly embarrassed. Great. Before Castiel could stammer out an apology, the teacher addressed the class.
,” Alfie comforted, “I promise, once tomorrow passes, he’ll calm down, realize how he’s been acting, and apologize. It happens every year.”
“I know that, I really regret saying it. I didn’t mean it to hurt you,” Dean avowed. “Please come back and watch the movie,” Dean begged. After a moment of consideration, Castiel returned to the couch with Dean.
"Oh, honey. He's not going anywhere. And do you really think he'd want to wake up to find you sitting there, looking and smelling like a homeless man?" She asked, hands on her hips.
Dean nodded and they stayed on the line for a few heavy, silent moments. Neither of them quite sure what to say. There were millions of things swimming around in both of their heads, but they didn’t want to freak the other one out.
“So anyway, the fugitives are on foot. They get a one minute head start before the cops can go after them. The fugitives have to get to point B without being caught by the cops. The first fugitive to reach point B wins. If you get caught by the police, you have to go back to the starting point. The cops can drive you back if they’re feeling generous, but often times you have to walk. We work on the honor system and cheaters are shunned. Make sure you go all the way back to the start. If you’re caught cheating, you don’t get to be in the next round. We usually combat cheating by making the fugitive take a selfie by the start point and send it in a group chat to the cops. It’s kinda fun,” Dean said.
"If you're so secret with names, why did you tell me yours when you were thrown in the car?" Castiel inquires.
After some persuasion, Castiel was convinced to go out with Balthazar. First, they stopped at Cas' favorite burger place, and Balthazar insisted that he pay for them both. Knowing that his friend wasn’t going to take no for an answer, Castiel acquiesced.
It was Monday in every sense of the word. Dean woke up on the wrong side of the bed. He fumbled around blindly until he found that awful alarm clock. He slammed the snooze button and dragged himself out of bed. Oh how he wished he could burrow back under the covers and continue his blissful unconsciousness.
“Every year around this time I get super defensive and angry and just...rude.” Dean huffed a small laugh through his nose.
“I thought we had a ‘no phones at the table’ rule,” Sam complained, earning a dirty look from his brother. Mary gave Dean a pointed look, obviously agreeing with her youngest. Dean had the decency to blush, and excused himself from the table when he read the caller I.D.
“I’m proud of you, Castiel,” he said. After Naomi’s hearing, Castiel had started going back to therapy. Bartholomew even joined him a few times to properly talk about what had happened. Castiel didn’t know how much resentment he was holding towards his father until those sessions. It took a couple weeks, but soon enough, Bart was able to explain himself completely, and Castiel - as stubborn as he could be - started thinking about it from his father’s perspective. The teen was still hurt, but he was starting to understand how everything escalated. Things were a bit tense between them, but they were far better than they were in January.
It was modest, comparatively to the one Naomi had bought. Only one master bedroom in this one. That was on the ground floor along with the kitchen, dining room, living room, and office. They had a walk-out basement with two bedrooms, Castiel choosing the one with the bigger closet (he had gotten used to having two walk-ins to himself).
the burgers Dean made them just because they had mustard on them! Eventually, they reached an agreement, and Dean was more conscious of his mess, while Castiel made an effort to remain open to trying new things.
“Please! It’s Christmas!” Dean begged, lifting his arms up to protect his face from his boyfriend's wrath.
didn’t want to do that. If he explained things to Dean, that would put him in such a vulnerable position, and he was not up for being exposed like that. He didn’t want to have to tell Dean these things while they were in a fight; he wanted to tell Dean when he knew he would be supported. That’s not to say that Castiel believed Dean wouldn’t support him - even in the midst of a fight - but he just wasn’t willing to go out on this particular limb. Not right now. There were a lot of things surrounding his mother’s death - and his subsequent actions - that were holding him back.
Castiel brought his hand up to examine the injury. He remembered Naomi hitting him with a...something. His head was tender, and he groaned when he put too much pressure on it. Mary gently took his hand away from his head.
“Y-yes, Dean. Fuck you make me feel amazing,” Cas encouraged, clenching around Dean’s cock as he continued to pound into him, seeking his own release. With a few more swift thrusts, Dean was stalling his hips, spilling into Cas’ tight hole.
"You keep this up, I'm not gonna last too much longer," Dean warned. Cas pulled off and wiped his chin.
“Are you sure?” he asked. Castiel nodded his head, picking at a loose thread on his blanket. Bart scanned his son’s face and rose from his chair.
Castiel grabbed her hand and squeezed gently, “Hey, it’s the thought that counts, right?” Anna smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes.
As soon as they stepped through the front door, Sam led Alfie upstairs and Charlie dragged Dean downstairs. The boys went to their rooms without so much as a hello to their mother.
“I went for a walk this morning. I woke up early and couldn’t get back to sleep,” he lied. Naomi stabbed another chunk out of her half of a grapefruit with her fork and popped it into her mouth. She finished chewing before speaking.
. Was his boyfriend actually playing a game in which the entire purpose was to make out and do other sexual acts uninterrupted for seven minutes while your peers gossiped about you?
Finally, Dean removed his fingers and slowly slid into Cas. The dark haired man moaned Dean's name and wantonly pushed himself back onto Dean.
“That Mr. Novak guy?” Dean started as if he were shooting the shit in the teachers’ lounge, “you know, he’s kind of a dick.”
“Hey, babe, guess what!” Dean started excitedly as he entered their shared apartment. He kicked off his shoes and hung up his jacket. As he walked into the living room where his boyfriend was sitting, he answered his own question, “I got the job at Middlefield High School!”
“That’s ridiculous. But, still, can’t you shove the paperwork on someone lower on the food chain?” Dean suggested, kneading into Cas’s shoulders.
"Holy shit, Dean! Right there! Don't stop! Don't fucking STOP!" Cas shouts. A few more thrusts and Cas is gone, painting his chest and Dean's hand with come. It only takes a few more thrusts until Dean is buried as deep as possible in his boyfriend, emptying his load into Cas. Dean slumps half-on Cas's chest; both of them breathing heavily.
“So,” Dean said, walking into Cas’s living room, “got any apple juice left for me?” Cas laughed and smiled at the ground.
“Mhmm,” Dean said, squeezing tighter. It had been a long time since Dean was in this sort of mood. The man was, at his core, a very loving person, but he felt this need to keep that part locked up tight and hidden behind several layers of bravado and masculinity. Castiel treasured the moments where Dean let himself be vulnerable.
“Sounds great. So if one of us throws a tantrum, just bring up this conversation and hopefully it’ll stop.” Dean nodded to himself and flashed a grin at Castiel. “Now, I don’t have to be anywhere until five a.m.” Dean said with a wink.
“You’re gonna rot your teeth out,” he said. Cas just rolled his eyes fondly and pressed the red button to place their orders. Not too long after, the carhop was coming towards them.
Dean raises his hands in defeat and smiles. "Touché." Dean's eyes drift to Castiel's lips as the man's tongue darted out to skim over his chapped lips.
not the fight he and Dean had just gotten into. The worst part was that he knew he was wrong. He knew he should’ve cleaned up the kitchen. He knew his father was just trying to help. He knew Naomi’s punishment lined up pretty well with the way he’d been acting.
“Maybe she just wants to see more of you. You know that Michael left for college pretty quickly after she arrived, so maybe she’s trying to get closer with you.”
"Bite me." Dean said with a smile, taking a mental note to do something for Charlie in thanks of helping him out.
a school night. You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here,” she joked, “except you, Dean. You have to stay here.”
As always kudos and comments are greatly appreciated. If you feel so inclined, my tumblr is satansass666 if the spirit moves you to give me a follow. :)
“Thank you for cleaning up the kitchen and vacuuming the living room,” she started, “it should have never taken that long, but a deal is a deal. You cleaned up and apologized for your actions, so you’ve earned your privileges back.”
“Oh, you don’t have to apologize for him. I’ve known him a lot longer than you have, I’m used to him,” she assured. Castiel shrugged in agreement and rubbed at his eyes, careful to be gentle around his bruised cheek. Charlie reached out and grabbed his chin, leaning his head this way and that to more closely examine him. “Damn,” she remarked. Castiel nodded solemnly.
was wrong with him, and he just got super defensive and left,” Dean said, punctuating his expletive with an especially harsh stab into his side dish. “It was barely even a talk. I saw that he was getting defensive, so I backed off and tried to tell him that I couldn’t control what went on between Naomi and him, but that I was there for him, but he just interrupted me and stormed out,” Dean disclosed.
Dean gave Castiel a questioning look. “My dad? Why would I be talking to him?” Castiel’s jaw tensed. He took a deep breath.
“That is certainly not the reason you placed your bet against them. I recall something closer to ‘we can’t let the girls win, they’ll never let us hear the end of it’,” Balthazar recounted.
home when I was his age. At least he’s not getting into any trouble. You’re not, are you?” he double-checked with Cas. The boy gave another shake of his head.
She cleared her throat in a way that reminded Castiel of Professor Umbridge from Harry Potter. He closed his eyes and tried not to get too heated before the conversation even started.
“What?” Castiel asked. Was she seriously insinuating that she would hit him with a ruler? Was he enrolled in a Catholic school, and he just failed to notice?
“Speaking of bad decisions,” Charlie said, “Jo and Castiel have to compete to see who picks first for teams.” The two took their spots and placed the oreo on their foreheads. At Charlie’s countoff, they contorted their faces in hopes of winning the inaugural game. The others were all cheering from their seats, enjoying the show of their coworkers pushing an oreo down their faces.
"Fuck, Cas," Dean moaned. Cas quickly removed Dean's underwear and got straight back to work, licking a long stripe up the underside of Dean's cock. He quickly swallowed him down, not stopping until his nose hit wiry hair.
Balthazar ordered. Castiel rattled off the number obediently. Memorizing telephone numbers had become somewhat of a lost art with his generation, but ever since Naomi started taking his phone away, he started committing them to memory. It made him feel less isolated during his groundings.
“Balthazar didn’t help me clean up. Charlie did. Balthazar left sometime last night,” Castiel informed him. Dean looked up at him, puzzled.
racing up his spine. Just then, he heard the distinct sound of whistling coming from the hallway outside Dean’s room. He jumped off of Dean’s desk and pointed an accusatory finger at him.
“We haven’t even talked since Halloween,” Castiel said, muffled behind his hands. He let them drop as he continued, “How the hell am I gonna tell him all this?”
Cas changed his position one last time, crowding his body against Dean, shooting sparks of pleasure everywhere for both men.
“Did you get that homework done?” Dean asked, trying anything to just start some dialogue. Castiel didn’t seem to hear him, or maybe he was ignoring him. When Dean realized Castiel wasn’t going to reply, he tried a different conversation starter. He tapped Cas on the shoulder to ensure he got his attention.
he hadn’t, which had Dean in a bad mood not ten seconds after waking up. He grumbled as he pulled himself out of bed and got ready for another day of work.
"Well, Dean has you put down as one of his emergency contacts, but we couldn't reach you. I take it you found out just as well. Right this way, he's in recovery," the doctor informed him.
“And what’s that, Freckles?” Cas asked, bringing back a nickname from their college days. Dean narrowed his eyes at his lover, obviously not impressed. He eyed Cas, then flicked his gaze to the belt, then back to Cas.
Balthazar joined him at the table with two steaming cups of...something. Dean thanked the man and wrapped his hands around the mug, letting it warm him up.
Castiel was lounging on his bed, wasting time on his laptop. He’d made himself a nutritious supper of a hot pocket with a side of cheez-its. He was still snacking on the little squares when his phone started to ring.
“I am now,” he said in a low register, propping himself up to kiss Dean on the lips. He meant it to be chaste, but Dean’s hand snaked its way into Cas’s hair and kept him there. “Mm, ambitious this morning, are we?” Cas teased.
He would admit that even though he despised Naomi for making him move, he had to give her props for buying a house with two master bedrooms. While his parents’ was at the top of the stairs directly to the left, his was down at the end of the hallway. There was a nook with a lower ceiling that sort of acted like its own hallway right in front of the door. The rest of the room opened up slightly to the left. They didn’t have an attic, so all the upstairs rooms had pitched ceilings. His room was directly above the garage, so it stuck out on its own.
“The...other shit. Like, I made a jab at him over the socks at Charlie’s, and he looked guilty about it. And like...I’m really not even mad about the socks. I’m not! He needed them more. It was just everything else. The breakfast, and the shopping, and the not doing laundry, and forgetting my birthday! Who forgets their boyfriend’s fucking
“Uh, well…” Alfie/Samandriel looked quite uncomfortable at this point, “my real name is Samandriel, but when I moved here I started going by Alfie,” he explained. After that revelation came uproarious laughter from the attractive boy. Castiel just melted at his laugh. He almost wanted to join in, but he quickly collected himself before he could do anything embarrassing.
Did Cas really just say yes to this? He just met the guy last night, in the back if a cop car, for God's sake! There was just something about Dean that Cas couldn't say no to. He heard a thump behind him and turned to face Dean. Cas looked at him for the first time in proper lighting and couldn't believe this man was more beautiful than he had been before. Cas couldn't take his eyes off of him, from his messy hair to his work boots.
Dean decided to check Cas' other social media, just wanting to know whether or not Cas had been active lately. After cycling through multiple apps, Dean concluded that Castiel must not have gotten his phone back. He also entertained the notion that Castiel was just busy doing something else, but even if Castiel were busy, he would’ve told Dean beforehand if he was going to be away from his phone for a long period of time.
,” Anna pointed out, challenging her boyfriend with the raise of her eyebrows. Michael returned his gaze to his girlfriend and gave a bit of a reluctant smile.
“Come inside. Your nose looks almost frostbitten,” he offered. Dean complied, finally noticing the chill that started to seep through his jacket and into his bones.
As the couple drifted off into sleep, they lived - briefly - in a world where only the two of them existed. No step-parents, no curfews, just Cas and Dean in the bed, pressed as close together as two people could be. Dean kissed Castiel’s forehead, and Cas knew from that moment on, no matter what happened, he could get through anything as long as Dean was by his side.
Dean truly didn’t think he had it in him to go another round so soon, but when Castiel touched him like that, he couldn’t help but respond eagerly. He ended up fucking into Castiel against the shower wall from behind. It didn’t take too long for him to reach completion again, his cum dripping out of Castiel and being washed down the drain under the spray. He noticed Cas still pumping into his own hand, and reached around to do it for him. He bit down on Castiel’s shoulder as he watched his lover paint the shower wall.
“What if, uh...Oh! What if one of us faked an injury and...and, uh...no,” he thought out loud, grabbing the back of his neck as he searched for a solution.
“No, Cas, I haven’t talked to my dad,” Dean insisted, “why do you even think I would?” Castiel looked off to the side, piecing together his next sentence. Dean took another bite of his cold food.
In no time, they parked in the driveway of the Winchester house and the boys propped Cas up between them.
A couple hours later, and the credits rolled on the movie. Sam went to bed and Dean gently shook his mother awake.
“I thought you’d grown out of this. Castiel, please. I know dad said that this dinner was optional, but it’s not. Come downstairs and eat; it’s Christmas Eve for God’s sake!” He looked at Anna, and she stood up from the bed and walked towards him.
“You mean Balthazar? No, we’re just friends,” Castiel told her. She pursed her lips in thought and turned to rummage through the pantry. She pulled out two bags of popcorn and opened one to put in the microwave. “Why do you assume we’re dating?” Castiel asked rather timidly.
“If that dickbag thinks he can just get away with degrading our lives, he has another thing coming.” Gabe warned. “I mean, who the hell does he think pulled his sorry ass out of his burning building? It sure as hell wasn’t the tooth fairy!”
He had and about two hours before Cas said he'd be home. He cleared off the counters and put everything in the dishwasher that would fit, then took the rest and hand washed them while the machine ran. After that he dried and put all of the dishes away, then started on the table. It was filled with newspapers and junk. After clearing all of that up, he went to the closet and pulled out the swiffer jet mop and cleaned the floors. Once that was done, he went to the hall closet and pulled out the vacuum cleaner, making sure the carpet in the living room was spotless.
“If he was onto you, why didn’t he come to us about it?” Jo asked. Balthazar raised his hands in front of himself and pointed at Dean.
“Uhhh, tha-thank you,” he stammered. Naomi acting nice always caught him off guard. She gave a tight smile and nodded once before turning around and leaving Castiel’s room. As soon as the door closed, Castiel lunged at his belongings, quickly turning on his phone. He waited anxiously as it started up. When it finally did reboot, there was an onslaught of messages and notifications, many of them from Dean over the past few days. Castiel’s heart was heavy as he opened his texts from Dean. Many of them asked what Castiel was doing, if he was free that weekend, if Naomi had taken his phone. Once Cas had read all of those, he fired up snapchat. To no one’s surprise, there were quite a few pictures sent from Dean asking the same type of questions as Dean’s texts. Castiel quickly sent a picture of his ‘privileges’ sitting on his desk. He wanted Dean to know he had his phone back.
Cas let himself into Dean’s place by using the spare key hidden above the doorframe. The fireman said he’d move it, but never actually followed through. Cas was grateful for his boyfriend’s fluctuating laziness.
Castiel rolled his eyes. Nonetheless, he pulled up Netflix on his computer and searched for her suggestion.
want apple juice or would you prefer something more….spirituous? How about…my signature Apple Pie #2 cocktail?”
“It was fine, nothing too exciting. Well, there was one thing,” Balthazar replied as he grabbed a duffle bag out of the back seat.
Castiel almost agreed before he remembered that he and Dean lived together. “Uhh, actually. I’m sort of out-of-the-way. I’ll just crash here tonight and drive home tomorrow,” he said.
The next morning, Castiel practically shot out of bed when his alarm went off. Usually, he’d groan and rotate through social media on his phone, but today, he had extra energy.
A pool of warmth just above Dean’s groin becomes unbearably hot as his toes curl, his cock twitches in Castiel’s fist signaling his impending release. “Are you close?”
Did I spend half of this chapter writing about two people making out? Yes. Do I regret anything? No.
“I don’t want to grow up!” Claire bemoans, “if growing up means being this tired, I’d rather stay five forever.”
Dinner quickly arrives and everyone moves to the dining room. It’s a beautiful spread of roasted chicken and vegetables, fluffy mashed potatoes, and a quick salad. Once they’re all seated at the table, Dean asks Crowley how he and his wife met. Crowley tells him that they met at Bats Day in the Fun Park; a festival held at the Disney Resort in Anaheim. It’s a gothic festival that Crowley attended because he was...Crowley and Celeste ended up going to with some friends of hers because they thought the “energy” of the festival seemed interesting. Whatever that meant. Crowley went on to explain that the festival was a three-day event with a goth market, food, costumes, music, and a trip to Disneyland.
“She’s not—?” Castiel wildly gestures at Dean, “she’s not, what? She doesn’t have a dick is that it? Is that it, huh? She’s different because she has a pussy?”
“That’s a pretty unique name,” Dean tells her, but from the way Crowley’s nose wrinkles slightly he can tell the man doesn’t share the same sentiment.
Lips parted with soft moans curling past them, Dean threw an arm over his eyes as his brain focused on the feeling of Castiel’s hand sliding up and down his dick. There was a door in the back of his mind, wrapped up in chains that pounded against his skull, threatening to throw itself wide open as Dean mentally forced himself—forced his thoughts—to stay in the present. In the here and now and not throw himself mentally back in the past. Back to a different time and a different situation where someone else’s hand had also been down his pants.
“Alright, this is enough talk about my baby,” Celeste waves the conversation away with a sharp movement of her hand, “I can feel her kicking me in the ribs. Instead,” she dark brown eyes that seem weighted with years of experience glance between Dean and Castiel, “how did you two meet? I’ve always been interested since my attentive husband here always comes home and complains about having to see you two make out at work.”
Sam, however, doesn’t seem to fear such a notion. “Rufus loves us like nephews, he's not going to do anything.”
Felt a little bad that I've been treating you guys to some short chapters lately, so this one is a little longer with a lot more feels to it.
“Hmm,” Dean hums, turning his head slightly so he can press a kiss against the man’s temple. “It was aside from watching those two flirt.”
“I may not look like I’m married since some of us like to not witness unnecessary displays of PDA at work, but I can say that unlike some my marriage is healthy because I enjoy a good bit of
Dean’s shuddering, losing himself into his own headspace as Castiel licks his lips, his grip on Dean’s cock tightening as he drags his hand up and down the shaft. “Dean,” he all but moans his name as he resumes kissing and sucking on his neck like he can’t get enough of the Winchester. If Dean was a whiskey, Castiel might as well have been an alcoholic at the rate he was going.
His head tips back, a soft moan slicing through the air as Dean squeezes his eyes shut and shudders, his teeth sinking into his lower lip as he can’t help but smile. The pleasure sends a jolt from the base of his spine down to the tips of his toes and the top of his head, a single hand moves up from Castiel’s back to fist into the back of his head and tug on his hair. Moaning at the harsh treatment, Castiel gives the skin caught in his mouth a particularly hard suck that has Dean moaning as he mentally swears that that particular spot of skin is turning into an erogenous zone of its own.
There’s a rough, calloused hand in his pants that he knows doesn’t belong to Cas, but his brain can’t make that distinction. Refuses to make it almost.
“Well,” Castiel smiles, “Raphe, offered to watch Claire this weekend, so I could get a break and Claire gets to hang out with her cousins,” Castiel’s voice drops by a couple of decibels until its a husky whisper, “so...I was wondering if you’d like to spend the weekend? With me...on a date.”
“Just relax,” Castiel whispers against Dean’s ear, his lips brushing against the sensitive flesh as he reaches down and unbuttons Dean’s jeans, pulls down the fly and hooks his thumbs into the waistband of his jeans and boxer briefs below, he pulls them down, just enough so that Dean lets out a hiss of pleasure once his cock is free of its confines.
“Then why?” Castiel hisses, “why the fuck are you so afraid every time I touch you? Every time I kiss you? Every time I want to get intimate with you? Don’t think I haven’t been noticing either.” His eyes narrow to mere slits. “I notice the way you tremble every time I do anything to you,” he scoffs, a bitterness to his voice that has Dean pisses, “it’s only ever with
“You know what I mean. I’m not like you. I’m not some dude that can just show up at pride and act like there’s nothing wrong with the world. I’m not some dude that fucking prowls gay bars for the next best thing—” Dean can feel the snake slithering in its chest, his tongue flitting out to taste the air; taste the scent of blood and pain ready to come out. “—I’m not like you; I’m not a fag—”
?” He hisses, his temper a slowly boiling pot that threatens to explode. “ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!?” The lid blows off the pot and chucks itself into the ceiling. “You never want to talk! That’s all I want from you is to talk about what the fuck is going on! What made you fucking leave my house and not talk to me for hours!”
So it's my own personal headcanon that Castiel is mixed (because come on realistically there's only so many ways to explain the angel's different vessels in canon through a fic), but he's also half-Jamaican so there's that.
Castiel just blinks at her, a grin stretching across his face as his gaze briefly flickers to her stomach. “Are you pregnant?”
“Raphe—” his lips tremble, the tears falling freely from his eyes now as he pitches forward to press his face against her shoulder. He sobs loudly as he wraps her arms around him.
“Yes,” the male nurse hisses, “I’ll make sure to have my wife also bring a butcher’s knife so I can slit my throat with it when you two start getting lovey-dovey at the dinner table.”
But anyway, arc 1 of this fic is finally wrapped up! Only 2 more arcs to go with arc 2 being the longest...mostly because I love to torture myself it seems. So for now, I'm going to be taking a break so I can plan out arc 2 and work on some other projects. See you then!
Dean doesn’t even have time to take one good glance around the room before Castiel pushes him back onto the bed. Instead, Dean takes in Castiel’s visage, his mouth going dry as he stares up at his lover? Boyfriend? Paramour? Dean doesn’t know what word is best in this situation; what word is best to describe his situation and relationship with Castiel, but right now in his lust addled brain, he could care less. To him, in this particular situation, Castiel might as well be his god. The soft orange glow of bedside lamps chase away the shadows of the room, but also provide a bit of an orange outline for Castiel’s entire body. His blue eyes are dark with lust, two pools of dark seawater churning amidst a turbulent storm. He can’t help the sharp twitch that his cock does as he stares up at Castiel like he’s some Grecian god that came down from the heavens to bless Dean with a boon, luck, a fucking baby—Dean really didn’t pay attention to mythology when Sam had that period when he was 12 when Greek mythology was the biggest thing to be into at the time and Sam would never shut up about it. But the fact of the matter is is that he doesn’t care. Castiel could knock him up from his heavenly gaze alone and Dean would spread himself out on the bed and be ready to push out another one in nine months.
And like that, Dean can’t hold back the door in his mind. It throws itself open, bursting the chains off of the door and half of Dean is thrust into the past of his mind, the other half of him in the present. The musky scent of cheap cologne slams into his senses, he shakes, pleading with his brain to stop. He knows Cas’ scent by now; nows the tropical coconut and citrus blend that always seems to cling to his skin. But there’s the scent of that cheap cologne colliding with the scent of mildew and stale alcohol.
so like again, totally understandable if anyone needs a break after reading this chapter or wants to skip over it.
His orgasm is like the waves of a sea, his heart beating wildly in his chest and all the muscles inside of his body tense until the laps of water recede away from the shore leaving Dean’s body in a relaxed state. His mind was clear, quiet, and calm for the first time for a long while.
Castiel’s eyes narrow at Dean. “Are you trying to convince me...or are you trying to convince yourself?” His words are like a punch to Dean’s chest. His voice drops to a whisper, “I know the signs, Dean…” his tongue flickers out to wet parched lips, “...I...I should have stopped last night...I should have stopped when I felt you go rigid. I thought you were enjoying it, but—” he shakes his head.
Brows creasing together, Castiel lifts his hand to pinch at the bridge of his nose. “That was ‘nothing?’ That was clearly something; something that bothered you so bad you freaked out like that. Seriously, Dean, I’m worried about you. Just tell me what happened.”
Both of them walk through the house and go out to the back porch where the grill is smoking hot. Castiel lifts the hood of the grill, causing citrus and steak smelling smoke to billow out. He grabs a pair of tongs on the side and flips the steaks over on the grill, causing the juices to slither out of the meat and sizzle onto the coals below. Dean leans in close to him, eyeing the steaks like a ravenous man who’d never seen a delicious delicacy such as this before. “What are you making?”
Sam just blinks at Dean, “Rufus wouldn’t do that...right?” He just shakes his head, disappointed at his brother’s death wish. “Well enough about me, how have you been?”
This chapter is one of my faves since we properly get some dialogue between Cas and Crowley. I loved their dynamic in the show and really wanted to replicate it here. Also updated the last chapter with a title, for some reason I thought I had put on in but I guess it didn't stick for some reason?
But Castiel doesn’t dwell on it—he does, even when he tries and forces himself not to. He’s driving and wonders for a split second if it’s raining when tears well up in his eyes. He begs them not to fall; not to fall in the deafening silence of his own car as he drives aimlessly and doesn’t realize where he’s going until he pulls up in the suburb half an hour away from San Franciso where his sister lives.
Dean’s mouth slightly parts open as he realizes he and Castiel haven’t done much aside from him coming over to fix things or both men hanging out with Claire involved in some manner. “Sure,” he says, cracking a smile, “I’ll be here.”
Castiel squints his eyes at Dean and laughs the hardest he’s ever laughed before, “That’s what you told him? I wonder how you’ve ever managed to land a date in the past before.”
Castiel’s eyes are blown wide after staring at the both of them, “Seriously? Dean, how are you more similar to my daughter than I am?”
“You’re so special, Dean,” Castiel whispers, pressing a kiss along the edge of Dean’s jaw as his fist becomes slicker in Dean’s pants.
I'm a day late! Weirdly had days of the week mixed up, but here's the new chapter. Again, it's not really long, but there is a lot of heart-wrenching fluff in it!
“Hmm,” Dean hummed as he snorted softly, “can’t relate. Cas’ hotness blinds me to all other things.”
“Gross!” Both men pull apart to glance at Claire whose eyes are narrowed as she stares at Dean and her father. “Are you and Daddy swapping cooties?”
“Cas.” Castiel turns to give him the most gentle smile ever; one that makes Dean's heart flutter inside of his chest as he hopes to make Castiel smile at him that gently forever. “I brought you lunch.”
Celeste smiles at him, she lifts her hand to scratch at the stubble gracing his jaw. “It also didn’t help that you have an amazing accent as well.” The two of them put their forehead together and rub their noses against one another. Gavin makes fake retching noses at his parents' display of affection, Dean can’t help but smile at that as he doesn’t blame the kid for his reaction.
Castiel’s lips attach themselves to the lobe of Dean’s ear, his lips tugging on the flesh, his teeth lightly nipping and scraping it causing Dean’s brain to melt as he struggles to piece together words in a coherent sentence.
.” Dean’s eyes aren’t the only one who bugs at such a joke; Crowley snorts as he takes a sip of his tea, satisfied that he has some momentary peace and quiet aside from the Doctor’s monologue on screen.
Dean can hardly push together letters to form a response, his brain is mush inside of him as he gives a jerking motion of his head. Castiel’s arm slides down to press his hand firmly against Dean’s stomach, the other man crying as the corners of his vision go fuzzy, his back arching almost painfully, the muscles in his thigh quivering as he babbles out a string of curses intermixed with Castiel’s name. His orgasm hits him like a punch to the chest; his cock twitches as the first rope of cum shoots out of him, arching in the air until it splatters on Dean’s groin and the back of Castiel’s hand. Dean’s face is burning as the rest of his release pumps out of him with each twitch, dribbling over the back of Castiel’s hand that’s still gripping him, still milking him for the rest of the cum that’s still churning inside of him.
Tears spring to Celeste’s eyes, raising a single hand to press against her mouth, she gushes out, “That’s so romantic.”
“Well if Sam’s plans change for Christmas he’s more than welcome to join us, or the Christmas Eve dinner my family is hosting.”
Dean murmurs that he knows as he shifts his head so that Castiel’s right hand is pressed against his cheek, he shakes his head slightly so that Castiel’s palm is rubbing against him. “I just want to be intimate with you even if we don’t have sex tonight.”
Just to reiterate, there's some heavy content in this chapter (allusions to child abuse, panic attacks, etc) so if this is something you know is going to be triggering to you, please turn back now. Especially since the next chapter does contain child abuse.
She gets up and sits next to Dean at the kitchen island as Castiel grabs a cold bottle of beer from the fridge and the bottle of apple juice. He pours the juice and beer out in separate glasses and places them before his daughter and Dean. Claire and Dean pick up their glasses at the same time—with Claire wrapping her hands around her glass—and bring the glasses to their lips to take a long, steady sip from. They jerk the glasses away from their lips, letting out a long, satisfied sigh as their lips smack together. They place their glasses back down and drag the back of their hands across their mouths.
He shakes his head, his brows arching slightly as a flash of disappointment flits across Dean’s face. “Hey, Dean,” Castiel tosses the used tissues into the trashcan next to the left hand nightstand so that he can grab Dean’s face between his hands. “I’m not saying I don’t want you, I do, but,” he kisses Dean on the lips as he pulls away he brushes his thumb over them, “I’m good. I don’t need you to get me off because I did the same for you. I’m good enough knowing that you had fun and that’s enough for me.”
“It’s a miso and yuzu marinated steak, with baked potatoes and grilled peppers.” Castiel turns to see a bug-eyed Dean staring at him as if he’s the most beautiful thing on this planet. He swears he can see tears in the corner of Dean’s eyes which causes him to burst out laughing.
Instead, he shakes his head, grabs up the backpack he’d tossed into the corner of the living room earlier, and all but runs out of the house.
Castiel seems to weigh Dean’s words in his head, giving him a sharp nod. “I can do that.” Dean doesn’t know what he means by that as Castiel climbs into bed behind Dean, his back pressed flush against the pillows lined up at the headboard. He wraps a single arm around Dean’s midsection and pulls the man toward him so that Dean’s clothed back is pressed against his bare chest.
There’s a flicker of light in Castiel’s eyes as he shifts off of the couch and holds his hand out for Dean to take. A thousand emotions flit across Dean’s face; a war of confusion, hesitancy, and lust that form a three-way battle until trust and love come to provide support for lust. A smile flits across Dean’s face as he takes Castiel’s hand and allows himself to be led up to the master bedroom. Castiel’s lips are on him as he guides Dean back into the room and toward the bed as he kicks the bedroom door shut.
“No, I get what you mean...have you...heard from him?” Sam stares down at the container of food he’s holding as if his veggie and cashew chicken stir fry will hold the answers he’s seeking.
She huffs, her plump lips pushing outward into a pout. “This is why it’s aggravating that my husband is friends with a bunch of nurses and doctors.” She pats her stomach, her pout dissolving into a grin. “But, yep, five months along tomorrow.”
Dean pauses over the meat he’s currently browning in a skillet to use for the tacos he’s helping Castiel make. Claire is drumming her feet against the kitchen stool as she shades in the ladybug in the coloring book she’s working on.
“Oh god!” Dean cries out in a broken, stuttered moan; his back arches slightly against Castiel’s touch as he’s given a particularly firm tug as Castiel’s movements sped up, an almost stream-like quantity of precum dribbled from Dean’s cock. His cheeks have flushed a shade of autumn red as he turns and captures Castiel’s lips for a heated kiss. Castiel’s hands are almost flying over Dean’s shaft as he seeks to drown him in pleasure; a pleasure that’s almost euphoric, like watching ancient Egyptians build their first pyramid or watching a freshly baked apple pie being pulled out of the oven.
They end up on the couch, Bruce Almighty playing on the screen, but neither man is paying attention to the movie playing. Instead, Dean is reclined on the couch, his hands pressed against Castiel’s back as the man above him slips his tongue into his mouth. A choked moan rumbles in Dean’s throat as Castiel presses their bodies flush together, their tongues are slick and wet as they slide and twist together; a chaotic dance that has Dean shivering as the dopamine floods his brain. Castiel pulls away from him, breaking their kiss even as he plunges back down to pepper the exposed parts of Dean’s neck with kisses until he’s kissing, licking, and sucking on a junction of skin underneath Dean’s jawline and the juncture of his neck.
The day of Thanksgiving finally rolls around, Dean’s in the kitchen helping Castiel prepare dinner while Claire is sitting on the couch in the living room watching cartoons. It’s 15 minutes to 6 when the doorbell rings and Dean opens it to find Crowley dressed in a black button-up shirt and dark jeans with a bottle of wine in his right hand and his left resting on the shoulder of his five-year-old son, Gavin. Crowley’s wife Celeste beams at him with the most radiant smile on this planet.
Those words are like ice-cold water being added to fire as Castiel pulls back, his hands flying up to cup Dean’s face so that he can stare at him. “Are you...are you sure?” He asks hesitantly, knowing that Dean’s words carry more weight with them than anyone else. “We can take this slow, Dean, we don’t have to do that tonight.”
The pain blooms hot and wild in his chest. It spreads across his face from the handprint marring his cheek. Castiel’s eyes are so dark he can barely see the irises, all he sees his anger, hurt, and pain. All Dean can feel is the heat of Castiel’s palm against his cheek. All he can feel is the hurt and pain in his own chest shattering into remorse.
“I would.” Dean turns around in Castiel’s grasp to stare at him, a smirk pulling on his lips as he brushes his thumb against the man’s cheeks
Humming, Castiel reaches out and grasps Dean’s cock in his hand, the tip an angry shade of red and dripping wet from precum. “Jesus,” Castiel murmurs even as Dean gives him a look with a cocked brow.
He can feel the way Castiel’s skin heats up with the kiss, the way his heartbeat sounds loud in his own ears. Tilting his head to the side, Castiel’s soft lips part open like a flower unfurling its petals. There’s a soft gasp and a shiver that Dean’s brain can’t process if it’s from him or the man before him. But it doesn’t matter to Dean as he snakes his tongue into Castiel’s mouth; the interior of his mouth is wet, hot, and slick like a furnace that had been covered in a layer of ice that was melting.
Castiel shudders as he lifts his hips just enough, that he can unbutton Dean’s jeans, lower the zipper, and slip his hand into Dean’s boxers where his fingers wrap around Dean’s dick. It’s already slick with precum, way slicker than Castiel thought it would be as he gives the organ a few experimental tugs.
“A girl,” she answers, her grin so infectious that Dean can’t help but smile too, “at least this time I can name her unlike we did with Gavin.” She stares pointedly at her husband who rolls his eyes in response and presses a peck against his wife’s cheek.
“Fuck, that feels good,” Dean moans, his words soft enough and thick with lust that it has Castiel smirking. His brows are scrunched up together as Castiel presses his hand a little firmer against his bulge as if to remind Dean that he hasn’t exactly answered his question. “I want you to just….just touch me.”
“Maybe?” There’s a lilting, joking tone that wraps around Castiel’s question. He’s grinning widely as he leans in closer, narrowing the distance between both men until…
“I’m not—!” Castiel’s brows push together, his forehead wrinkling as his mouth worms itself into a thin line, “that’s not—Dean, just—” he groans, his hands flying to his hair, “—can you fucking stop for one second! Just stop being so fucking stubborn for once and tell me what’s wrong!”
?” His bluejay colored eyes search Dean’s face. “You’re seriously going to call that an overreaction?” His lips press together.
Dean shrugs as he stabs one of his chicken pieces with the end of his chopsticks. “‘S been alright. Therapy’s been going fine even if I have to dig up things I wish I could forget.”
Also, it seems Destiel became canon (?) last night and while this definitely might be an unpopular opinion, I've lived through enough canon gays and disappointment to feel well...disappointed by the latest episode. Felt more let down than the time The Magicians stamped down on the gas pedal and pissed off every bit of the fandom. But that's enough about my feelings, here's the latest chapter!
“Oh shut up,” Dean mutters, turning his head slightly so that he’s obscuring the smile that flits across his face into the crook of Castiel’s shoulder and neck.
“I’d have to look at my schedule, but Sunday’s are a no go since that’s when my group meets up….so...you’re single now...I think I know the perfect person to set you up with.”
A flush crept its way from up Dean’s neck to his cheeks as he confirmed that he will. Something that caused Crowley to groan in disgust. “Why don’t you two just shag already?”
Both Dean and Castiel wrapped themselves in laughter as Claire shook her head and went back to her coloring.
His other arm is pressed against Dean’s chest, keeping him taught against him, but it may as well be a physical barrier that brings the man some comfort to squirm against his hold. “Oh god,” Dean hums as Castiel’s grip tightens slightly, his cock twitching in the palm of his hand, a bead of precum pearling on the head that Castiel breaks with a flick of his thumb to smear the liquid around on the head of his cock with the pad of his digit. “Oh!” Dean cries out, his mouth open in a wide oval, he tips his head back, exposing his neck for Castiel to pepper kisses against.
“Dean,” Sam chastises him, “you better than anyone should know that there’s a lot more to a relationship that someone being smoking hot.”
“I almost died getting you your lunch,” Dean snorts as he places the bag down onto the table and watches Castiel undo the knot to reveal a bowl of salad with about a dozen toppings and a small sandwich.
Shock sweeps over Dean’s face as he places his phone down on the kitchen counter, “Hey, I’m notorious for landing chicks. I’m certain I can give my little bro a pointer or two.”
Dean thinks he’s going to barf as he watches Celeste and Crowley Eskimo kiss at the kitchen island. From the quick glance he gives Castiel, the doctor looks about ready to do the same.
I too wish I could have a small child so we could both shout "rob a bank" to the consternation of my SO
He comes in anyway and whirls around to stare at Dean who’s standing a good distance away from him, he’s leaned up against the kitchen island, his gaze focused on his feet.
“Is that your way of saying you want me to go?” Dean leans in close toward Castiel, his eyes flickering briefly at his lips.
“I’m seeing someone new,” Sam remarks as he watches Dean put his mouth near the container and try to shovel the food into his mouth. “Here,” he shakes his head as he grabs Dean’s chopsticks, pulls a rubber band from his pocket and ties the two chopsticks together with them before he gives them back to his brother.
“Oh,” Celeste laughs as she sets down her fork. Castiel is up and clearing away the plates to make room for dessert, “I saw him dressed up and he reminded me of a vampire, not any of this new-fangled stuff but like Bela Lugosi’s Dracula and there was something about his energy that was so infectious.”
Dean nearly chokes on his food as he whips his head to stare at his brother, his eyes are blown so wide in his head that they nearly resemble saucer cups. “What is wrong with you!?” Dean cries out, rice flying from the corner of his lips. There’s only one woman on this planet with that name that he and Sam know of; one woman that the two of them grew up with closely enough that she was like a cousin to them. “Do you want Rufus to kill you?”
Title of the chapter is from a Led Zepplin song. So this chapter has....a lot going on it, enough so that I understand if anyone needs to take a break from the fic in the coming weeks. Just a fair bit of warning, but this chapter contains
Castiel gives him an amused look that has his right brow arched, “My mom always said the way to a man’s heart is his stomach.”
He wraps an arm around Dean’s shoulder as he scoots down so that he can recline against the absurd number of pillows on his bed. Who even needs this many pillows? Dean thinks to himself as he rests his head against Castiel’s chest.
Dean shrugs as he reaches out to ruffle Claire’s already messy hair, “What can I say? I have a way with kids.”
“God, I want you,” Castiel all but hums as he lifts his head from the crook of Dean’s neck and stares down at his face and into his eyes. He expects to see desire there; love, lust, and want twisted into one. He expects to see the very definition of all eight types of love in Greek painted across Dean’s face, sweltering in his eyes for him as he continues to move his hand up and down Dean’s dick, but stops when he doesn’t find it there.
“Gavin is a perfectly suitable name,” Crowley sniffs, indignation rife in the way he upturns his nose at such an affront; as if his wife saying Gavin was an
“Dean, come on. I know you’re in there.” Castiel knocks against Dean’s apartment door, his mouth set into a deep frown at the fact that all his calls and texts had went ignored. “Please, we need to talk.” He raises his fist to knock again. Only for the door to be thrown open.
“Shut up!” Dean groans with frustration, lets his head drop into his hands. “Just stop!” He hisses, “I’m not some kid at your hospital alright! I’m not some kid or some teen you see when you check their heart and notice their parents, their guardians, their whatever is touching them the wrong way.”
“Would anyone like some wine as we wait?” Castiel shakes the bottle of white in his hand. Celeste is the only one to decline and ask for a glass of water instead.
We're back to a regular semi-painful chapter. This chapter includes Dean talking about his trauma, so if you feel want to skip where it starts to say Raiders of the Lost Ark and it'll be safe to read again when you see "do I remind you of him?"
Dean’s upper lip is curling into a snarl at the mention of Cassie. A sore wound that Castiel had picked without even realizing it. “Don’t mention her,” he all but spits, “she’s different—she’s not—”
But his brain doesn’t recognize that distinction for him. For some sick part of him, his past and present are steadily blending into one.
The door to the Novak home opens revealing Castiel standing in the doorway, he smiles when he spots the backpack hanging from Dean’s fist that contains two days worth of clothes and toiletries. “You pack any lube in there too?”
“Mmm,” Castiel hums, reaching out to wrap his arm around Dean’s waist and tug him toward him so that their bodies were pressed against one another, “that you are.” He rumbles, cocking his head to the side so that he can press his lips against Dean’s own, his lips part to snake his tongue into Dean’s mouth, but he groans in annoyance when the horn of the schoolbus cries outside. “Got to go get Claire,” he grumbles, pressing his forward against Dean’s as he reluctantly unglues himself from the other man.
That’s a weighted question, Dean thinks to himself, knowing full well his story of meeting Castiel in the park because his daughter got lost and he was there that day contemplating downing a bottle of pills wouldn’t make it in the Disney book of romantic “this is how we met” stories.
Dean’s rarely ever heard Castiel crack jokes, let alone sexual ones so he stands on the porch as frozen like a statue which causes Castiel to snort.
Dessert passes by fairly quickly with Celeste, Crowley, and Gavin bidding goodbye to everyone as Dean and the Novak family see them out the door. Claire’s already in bed by the time that Castiel comes down to help Dean dry the dishes that he’s washed. “Well that was fun,” Castiel murmurs as he rests his chin on Dean’s shoulder, his hands press against Dean’s side tentatively until his hands shift so that he can wrap his arms around Dean’s waist.
“We broke up,” Dean can almost hear the shrug Sam gives him, “we both realized that we just weren’t going to be compatible in the long run.”
Dean lifts his shoulders and lets them droop in such a way that Castiel isn’t certain it could pass for a shrug. “It was nothin’. It won’t happen again.”
There’s a tenderness to Crowley’s action as he leans closer to his wife to brush a stray tear off of her cheek and kiss the skin. “I don’t need you balling your eyes out at dinner, dear.”
“No,” Castiel shakes his head, his hands remaining on Dean’s chest, “just...if you keep kissing me I’m going to get hard.”
name for common American society, despite its blending pot nature. “It has Celtic roots and it means white hawk, anyway.”
Dean’s eyes are puffy and bloodshot as if he’s been crying all night. His clothes are the ones he wore yesterday to Castiel’s house and are severely wrinkled. “Can I come in?” Dean holds the door open a little wider, doesn’t say anything which concerns Castiel.
Whoo, okay, so this chapter was supposed to go up on Christmas (as many of you guessed) but I realized the ending I had planned for this chapter/arc, was going to be thrown off if I uploaded it then. Didn't help that I ended up getting distracted by so many other things (mostly taking a break, mostly playing that new Stardew Valley update, youtube randomly recommending me Astarion romance videos as if it knows I am an absolute simp for hot, deep-voiced, white-haired elves who could murder me....)
“Boy or girl?” Castiel asks as he gathers three wine glasses and a single glass and fills them up with the requested drinks.
Castiel must have caught him staring because he turns his gaze on Dean, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly. “Hey,” he says to Dean softly.
This week's chapter is a little short since not too much happens in it besides a mountain of fluff and some bitter memories. And the next couple of chapters are going to be short too until we're back to our regularly scheduled angst, comfort, and other feelings by chapter 23! So please hold on until then!
His stomach lurching with fear, disgust; a million sickening emotions he couldn’t properly put a name too as his mind thrust itself into hyperdrive.
“Cas, get off my back,” Dean growls, his eyes darkening and his lips widening to show off his teeth, “seriously, get off my back and pretend this never happened, alright?”
“Fuck,” Dean mutters, the only word he seems capable of saying tonight. Castiel pulls away from him, reaching for the box of tissues on the nightstand beside the bed. He plucks a couple out and starts cleaning the both of them up and it isn’t until the soft tissue is swiping over the head of his cock that he realizes something. He turns slightly to peer at Castiel’s face. “Do you want me to…”
A sharp bark of laughter tumbles from Dean’s throat as he puts away the last dish. “Maybe we should have flirted as equally as hard as they were.”
“Ooh,” Meg cooed, “how romantic.” By the sharp roll of her eyes that she gave him, he could tell in her mind that it wasn’t. “Castiel is already in the break room, I’m sure you know where it is by now.”
Brain addled with lust, Castiel doesn’t even realize he’s grinding his hips against Dean’s own like he’s a horny teenager all over again until Dean’s fingers are gripping his waist so hard, his curses becoming filthier and unintelligible by the second that Dean’s gasping out his name like a prayer, “Cas. Fuck. Cas. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”
Crowley shrugs, “What can I say, opposites do seem to attract each other. Celeste has always been a bit of a free spirit just like her parents, but growing up I was always taught by my mum and dad to never look at someone’s surface but beyond it...didn’t help that mum was a practicing pagan and dad was a protestant, either.”
“Hmmm,” he taps his chin contemplatively, “I’d be single if my current boyfriend breaks up with me, but—” he shrugs his shoulders, “—I think he’s pretty smitten with me, but I’ll let you know when I’m single again Mr. Winchester.”
And in Dean’s opinion, he’s equally intrigued by her as much as she is with him. Celeste, in no simpler terms, look like she walked straight out of Woodstock in her long maroon pants, a white and yellow top knotted at one end near her hip, a jacket thrown over it and a silk scarf keeping her braids carefully tucked back in the messy ponytail she kept them in. Dean glances at Gavin who is dressed in some jeans and a black shirt with a skeletal torso on it. He takes one sweeping look at this mismatched family, just as Castiel rushes out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on a kitchen towel.
” he half moans, “you’re literally the fucking tempestuous apple hanging from the tree.” He surges forward, pushing Dean onto his back. There’s a sound of protest that flitters out past Dean’s lips, only to be swallowed down as Castiel smashes their lips together. Their bodies are pressed flush against one another, causing Dean to feel the heavy throb of Castiel’s erection against his thigh. His eyes flutter closed, mouth open in a silent gasp as Castiel trails his lips along Dean’s jaw and kisses at the skin where his neck and jaw meet. It’s a spot that has Dean’s hands flying to Castiel’s hips, gripping them so tightly that the surgeon might as well have bruises in the morning.
Or as I like to call this chapter: the one where I went really ham on the smut in this that I contemplated becoming a nun.
A stream of moans tumble from Dean’s lips as Castiel’s grip on his cock turns into a slow, easy rhythm that’s almost torturous for Dean. It’s drawn out and slow, meant to prolong this erotic moment into one long symphony. In time when Dean would reflect back on this single night, reflect back on the warmth of Castiel’s body against his own and the pleasure that curled through him like a slow campfire flame, he would never be sure exactly of the babble of words that fell from his lips that night like a forgotten hymn.
Dean shoves Sam’s feet off of the couch as he plops down with his container of fried rice and general tso chicken. A pair of chopsticks stick up from the mound of food, Dean grasps the chopsticks between his fingers as he picks up a piece of chicken that slips from between the wooden instruments and tumbles back down into the container. He frowns at it despite Sam laughing at his struggle.
“I think he can forgive me for my transgressions for a little bit.” Castiel presses his lips against Dean’s cheek to hide the smile that’s worming its way across his face. His hand is hot around Dean’s cock as he tugs on the skin, the foreskin slipping back over the head as Castiel jerks it up and watches it get pulled down when he jerks downward. The heat from his hand and the sensation eat at Dean’s senses as he whimpers against Castiel.
“Besides,” Castiel sighs as he rubs small circles into Dean’s shoulder, “I think I nearly came from how hot you sounded just moaning my name.”
Dean bites into his lower lip as Castiel undoes the last two buttons and then lets his shirt slide off of him and pool around his feet. Castiel leans forward, his lips brushing against Dean’s own, “What do you want me to do to you?” He asks his palm pressing firmly against Dean’s crotch. Experimentally he gives a firm rub causing Dean’s eyes to flutter shut.
Claire finishes the rest of her juice as she climbs down from the stool, “If you need me, I’ll be in the living room doing homework.”
Making his way through the hospital, Dean gave a small wave at Meg as he sauntered over to the nurses’ station with a carefully tied plastic bag in his hand. Meg pointed at the bag with the tip of her pen. “Is that for lover boy?”
“You’re not,” Castiel whispers, his voice raw, tired and broken, “you’re fucking not. Part of you is sorry, but not the part that wanted to fucking hurt me.” His lips flap open and shut like a fish that’d been plucked out of the water. His eyes are shimmering and his hand is shaking. He shakes his head, his throat so impossibly tight as he rushes to the front door, throws it open, and slams it shut as he runs out into the hallway.
“Isn’t it a little bad to be saying his name in vain especially when you have my dick in your hand?” He asks with a chuckle that’s quickly cut off and forced into a deep, throaty moan as Castiel’s grip on his dick tightens, his fist giving Dean’s member a few, sturdy tugs that have the muscles in his stomach doing flips and twists in him.
"Well, whose fault is that? I'm not the one who couldn't keep their hands to themselves in the car." Dean pointed out.
“Um, both? I’ve done it a couple times on my own and a few times with other guys. Well, just one other guy, but I enjoyed it,” Dean rambled.
“That's my name. I thought we covered this at the school,” Alfie said with an amused smile, never looking up from his paper.
“Eh, she can have her space, though. Right, Cassie?” the Brit said with a smile. Cas smiled back in response. Although, it wasn’t too much of a smile.
talk to Cas, Dean knew Balthazar would be the last thing on Cas' list to talk about. And heaven forbid Dean ‘control’ the conversation.
now!” Naomi yelled twenty minutes later as she walked up the stairs yet again. She pushed open his door and found him lying on his bed, consumed entirely by his laptop. She marched over to him and yanked out the earbuds.
The fireman started with feather light kisses to Cas’s collar bone. From there, he traveled down and took one of Cas’s nipples into his mouth. Cas reacted slightly but remained asleep. Dean moved over to the other one, flicking out his tongue to make it stand upright. Cas let out a breathy sigh, but still remained asleep.
“One second,” Dean said, reaching into his own pants (still tightly secured to his body...a little too tightly) and pulling out his phone.
Dean stripped Castiel of his underwear, leaving his ass out in the open. Dean knelt down, kneading Cas’ cheeks in his hands. Without warning, Dean bit the flesh of Cas’ ass, sucking the soft skin and running his tongue over the teeth marks. Cas yelped, but it turned into a groan as Dean worked a hickey onto his ass.
Castiel woke up Friday morning with a knot already in his stomach. Today, the principal was sitting in on his class for his teaching assessment. Castiel had been stressing about it all week, throwing himself into his lesson plans to make sure they were absolutely perfect. He went over them as he cooked himself an omelet.
“Gross, stinky, smelly...Gabriel?” Dean guessed, earning a laugh from everyone but the biology teacher. “Um...dirty? Quick and Dirty?” Dean guessed. Castiel nodded his head.
"Go pay for these." He said and he thrust the bag into her arms. Before she could say anything, he was off in the direction of condom man.
Dean was furious. How could you treat a child like that? How could Cas' father stand around and not say anything about the way Naomi was talking about his deceased wife? How could he stand there and watch Naomi slap his son, and say nothing about it? Dean also felt bad for Cas. Dean had always had a supportive family. When his father died, their friends and family all got closer and helped them through it. He couldn't imagine how alone Castiel would be feeling.
"Have fun, don't get too drunk," Cas advised him. Dean laughed and said he wouldn't before heading out the door.
“It might be about the crumbs on the kitchen counter, or maybe the throw pillows on the couch weren’t fluffed properly,” Castiel joked back. He asked Balthazar to wait a few minutes while he did as his father asked.
“No!” Castiel said firmly. He winced at the volume and controlled himself before speaking again. “It’ll be worse if I stay than if I get home as soon as possible,” Castiel said, pacing towards the hallway and bounding up the stairs. Dean followed him to the front door.
“Yeah, what’s up?” Charlie said, furiously typing at one of the computers towards the front of the room.
“And Naomi told me that they got into another argument. Castiel picked up the plate and smashed it. She wasn’t going to be around him if he was smashing things, so she went upstairs. Look, I told you that those two go at it all the time. Castiel just needed some time to cool off. I’m sure he’s fine now, wherever he is,” Michael assured her.
Dean walked in a moment later but didn’t join them on the couch. He decided to take a nap, he only got about three hours of sleep last night, after all. When he laid down on his cot, he realized how tired he actually was. Within minutes he was out like a light.
"You're in big trouble, Mister," Dean said, closing the door before slowly taking off his shirt. Cas smirked and did the same, daring Dean with one look and a raise of the eyebrows to come and get him. Dean did just that.
