"No, not quite," Sherlock said softly. "You've been one of my favourite people since everything at school, driving Atlas to see John, taking her to Mr Fraggerty's office, trying to stop her getting suspended. You care about people. And when I came with you to your house, you were so, so impressive."
"I don't generally do well." Atlas said before adding. "One time the supply teacher announced that our teacher was off due to illness. I answered back that it was actually due to her having an affair with the janitor and she was currently packing her stuff from the house she was living in and moving to Denmark to be with her beloved...The head teacher didn't like that much." Atlas began as she got up and moved around the room. She picked up stuff on several surfaces around the room. "There were a lot of incidents like that and I was right everytime, but in the end it didn't matter 'cause I would still move school."
Silence descended upon them all before Mycroft spoke again. "His mission, should you call it that, did have an element of predictability within in it and we
"Yep," Atlas hummed before she let go of his arm and ate some more food. Perking up suddenly and starting to joke with Sammy.
"Your alright," John said as he saw Atlas sitting opposite her dad, Isla on a stool as they poured over case file after case file. "Well, not alright but awake. That's good."
"John!" Sherlock called downstairs after exiting her room and then he saw the mans head appear. "Come on."
"Hey, hey, hey." Sherlock said rubbing her back soothingly. Rosie pulled away and looked at her dad, Sherlock tucking a strand of lost hair behind her ear.
"Where'd all this come from?" Atlas asked, looking at Sherlock as he stepped inside and flicked on a switch.
"Dad," Atlas said sharply before hugging him tightly. "Its not." Sammy came over and joined the hug, Sherlock thankful for the bodies to hide in as tears fell from his eyes. "Dad."
Once Atlas was out of the house John stood at the door to the flat. "Sherlock. Move your ass." Eventually with another 'hmph' Sherlock moved away from the sofa and joined John before they descended the stairs. Once they reached the room where they were holding all the sheet music, piano and the violin, Sherlock taking a moment as he sighed. This was going to be a big job.
"This isn't a bloody murder investigation." Sherlock snarled, John reaching out a hand and putting it comfortingly on his leg.
"Can we stay? Just another five minutes?" Sherlock asked, looking at the clock which was blinking 3:17am. The urgency in his eyes must've pulled John back because he sat back down and rested a hand on Sherlock's knee. "I don't want to leave yet, the last time she was panicked and we left her alone...well...you know..." His fingers pulled back the head of dark curls that were so like her own.
The house was beautiful, big wooden hut with a balcony. Walking inside they looked into the kitchen.
"You've spread the ashes of your mother who died because your dad had to shoot her to stop you dying. You got adopted, you found your family, moved house." May also added.
"I believe there's hope for Eurus and Mycroft." Atlas piped up, jumping onto the counter and smiling Sherlock's goofy smile. "They just haven't found them yet." There was a pause. "Although, Eurus seems to suit being alone, she seems to enjoy it."
SHERLOCK and his mother had been walking in thoughtful silence for quarter of an hour now. Moonlit ground paved a pathway for absent torches. Trees smiled gayly at the once common trespasser through the woods upon his return.
"Atlas Holmes." She said gracefully as she pushed her glasses up her nose some more. Her red jacket only had one patch of blood on it, which was remarkable considering she had slit a man's throat while wearing it.
"I'm sorry, Ro," Atlas said. "It's just, something really bad happened and I'm not coping as well with it as I thought I would be able to."
"Nice to meet you Inspector Lestrade." She announced, finding it funny as he left a confused expression yet again. He realised he never actually said that he was an Inspector and it wasn't obvious that he was one. Unless...No. He couldn't be right. Greg stood looking dumbfounded before his mind made him look back at where the girl in question was following on to the murder site.
"Could I photograph her?" The woman asked. "The dog, her and the view is a good shot and I'll give you a free print by email."
The chords then changed, surprising John as the melody turned brighter and happier (in musical terms major.)
"No. I think I'll take a walk home. It's not far." Atlas lied knowing that there was more to the case than met the eye. She also knew that there was more than one mind who had plotted the murder, they just had to find them. She'd sent the police to go looking for the adult, but she now had to go looking for the kid. Or, she should say all the kids. The shooter was a human trafficker and she assumed that the person had shot the victim due to them knowing the truth about their plans.
"Nice to meet you." Sherlock said, somewhat uncertain of himself. He did not produce a hand, but instead went off into the kitchen. Desperately he tried to clear any evidence that he may on occasion burn hair or worse body parts at the table.
"I can't." Atlas sighed and held up her hands to show them shaking. "They took me off my seizure medication because they're running some tests for what may actually be causing the seizures and tremors and my terrible short term memory." Atlas chuckled at that last part before it died in her throat.
"She's trying to be Atlas. So that she doesn't make any of us sad. It's so infuriating but it's so-so
"Sorry about that, she has a medical thing, she appears well but she's actually not. That's why I'm here. She needed to forget it all," Sherlock smiled.
"Really, I should be thanking you dad." Atlas smiled before tentatively adding on. "For actually saying yes when I turned up at 221. Most men would've turned me away."
"It's alright, sweetheart, it's okay," John said, smiling down at her bleary eyed. "Just take some deep breaths." He then kissed her temple gently before tucking her head beneath his chin.
"Costco...when it opens." Atlas said to him, Sherlock furrowing his brows. He had a serious distaste for
Sherlock raised his eyebrows before John felt the urge to ask a question he'd been meaning to bring up for weeks.
"What happened?" Wanda asked coming into the living room to see John reading with Rosie. John sighed but before he could answer Sherlock interrupted.
"Oh, duck, I missed you too," Sherlock smiled at her. "I really, really missed you. My baby, my little baby. You were and always will be the best thing that ever happened to me."
"Well I need to change and get my phone. We could go with each other or split up?" Atlas asked, tilting her head at him.
"Christ Sherlock. I love you. I love you." John said before Sherlock snapped his head up to him and they hugged each other tightly.
"It's a tremor," Dr Young said as she came near Atlas. "Violent at that and affecting a large part of her body which is unusual, but as is the way with FND, you never quite know what the symptoms are going to be because it's so vast and complex. Alright, Atlas. I want you to try lifting your arms above your head." Dr Young smiled as Atlas, through eyes blurred with frightened tears, pulled her arms up but to no result. "Has she ever experienced a tremor like this?"
"Yeah, sure." Atlas replied, looking over to where the dog was lying in the centre of the living room floor, a rope dog chew in his mouth.
"Fixing. Overdid it with the acid. Trying to see what I can do to change it." Atlas frowned before she straightened up and looked at him. "How was it?"
"Yup," Sherlock said with a smile. "Her mother wasn't going to do it and so I did. My mum's first name is Ida too."
"Come on then," Sherlock said as he lifted her into his lap, her back to John, her feet on Sammy.  He kissed her temple as he pulled her to his chest and she rested there, not looking at the sky anymore.
"Well that's good then isn't it?" Sammy smiled as Rosie put her hands into his curls. The rest of the family watched the exchange with new found curiosity.
"Yeah." Sherlock sighed from John's lap. "I'd noticed. She'd covering in it with a facade. She's trying to be happy."
"I don't know. Dad likes Greek mythology, more than he'd care to acknowledge," Atlas smirked. "Atlas is a titan. A strong person both physically and mentally. I'm not strong physically, I'm pretty weak but I like to think I'm pretty strong mentally."
"I have my ways," Sherlock smiled before Sammy tucked the picture away in one of the side pockets. Sherlock squeezed his shoulder as Sammy went into the living room with his permanent frown stained face. He walked in, glanced around, before he exited and began to climb the stairs.
"Sweetheart," Sherlock grinned at her. "I have never been mad at you when things like this have happened. I never was. And I never will be. And not only for this. Me and papa, no matter what it is will always be able to help. Both of you," Sherlock put a hand to Sammy's knee too. "Now I know we go away in two days and you'd probably rather you were packing and getting ready, but anything. Truly, anything, from if your somewhere and your drunk and you need picking up, if your in trouble. If you just need to talk, either of us or both of us, will come and see you. Okay?"
"It's not a problem. According to Rosie, your family now. Your welcome to whatever you need." John smiled as he took a duffel bag from Sammy then the other and began to ascend the stairs.
"I fell over, but Atlas sorted it." She laughed as Sherlock laughed too. Atlas let out a breath she didn't know she had been holding in.
"Okay then. And your short term memory. Can you remember the three things I told you at the beginning?" Dr Young asked. "I showed you pictures of them aswell."
"Hello," Sherlock chirped as he set the case down on the floor. "Alright?" He asked, looking to his partner with a gentle smile and nodding.
"Yes, it's Sammy." He said as he plonked himself down beside her. "I'm sorry, I should've kept an eye on you."
"Because it is one!" Atlas exclaimed with an underlying laugh. "Although, I'll admit, mine is more like a library."
"Please come home this time dad. Please." Atlas whispered before she just looked at him. He frowned, kissed all of their cheeks again and went off to board his plane, throwing a last minute wave over his shoulder before disappearing.
"Because." Atlas said before realising just because wasn't going to work. "I can tell you that currently you are living in a two story flat, have three cats, a daughter who doesn't have a father that lives with you but believes the man you are married to is. You are filing for a second divorce in your thirty two, four months and six days of life, you have already been shopping today, been to an ice hockey game and...well...fucked the intern at the station." Atlas said growing slightly out of breath by the end. She stopped studied the woman's expression before being allowed closer to the body. The woman was sincere in her apologies and Lestrade shot her a look. "Holmes. Atlas Holmes."
"Can't what? Tolerate the behaviour of an inexplicably smart sixteen year old. Who isn't even the right age to be in Upper Sixth?" He asked, the ball being thrown to him by Xerxes again. The teachers remained quiet. "I did not know all that about the appendix. I also did not know that about human tissue. Now, so long as..." He paused, made it obvious he couldn't place her name. Atlas sighed before adding.
TIMOTHY and Wanda made the short drive over around about a week after Atlas was rushed into hospitak and arrived late one evening. The family were tired and were glad of the company . The pair snaked in with armfuls of Wanda and Timothy cooked meals but were told to keep back to the family room. There they lay it all out, with permission from the staff, with plastic cutlery and prepared the table. They pushed chairs around and lay for six.
"I'm not telling my dad or Rosie about it. So could you? You know." Atlas said, Mrs Hudson smiling before nodding allowing Atlas to go up the stairs. Sammy hot on her heels.
He got to his feet when he heard the ambulance arrive and Atlas could hear him beckoning the pair inside.
"Fair enough," Sherlock smiled before she looked at him bright eyed. "Come on. We'll take Red and save Papa from having to walk him this morning."
"Have you thought about adopting her?" Wanda asked, only prompting John to create a face and move away from the door an little more. Their voice reduced to barely a hushed whisper.
"Won't be necessary." Sherlock said, returning with a water bottle and a blanket. He plonked himself down in the chair by her bed - it was a sort of armchair - and covered himself in a blanket.
"Samuel, don't be silly. You don't have friends." His mum joked from what Atlas assumed from the kitchen before she appeared and took in the girl. His mother somewhat frowned before suddenly smiling, Atlas producing a hand.
"I've got some money put to the side. You know, for this." Sherlock said. "For family, for a house, to get a car."
"Yes." He choked out before he knelt down on the grass, Atlas remaining standing. "You know, she might have been insane but she knew what she wanted. She wanted to lie with Robert and Elizabeth."
"Rosie..." Sherlock began but stopped himself, before looking over to the other side of the room. "Rosie claims she doesn't like them."
"Sam, love?" John asked kindly. "Go help Sherlock and then come back here with him and we'll have a chat. The moon's putting a little bit of light over us all."
"But you have an opportunity to fix it." John added, his normal 'don't-mess-this-up' tone being applied. Not long after Mary had died he lived in a pool of regret whilst he held back the whole 'cheating' idea. And he wished he'd made it up to her before it was too late. "So for god sake Sherlock get your coat on, we need to go see her."
"I didn't know if I should wake you or Sherlock but Atlas' is acting weird, like really weird," Sammy said urgently as John threw off the blankets, waking a one Sherlock Holmes who grumbled to his feet and followed a minute later.
Sherlock didn't stir and she willed him to wake up and remember. Even if he could remember just enough to know who she was to him. It was as if he couldn't even join the dots to her in her younger years. As if any memory of her had been lost.
"ATLAS." Mycroft said, his voice scraping against her skull. "Are you ok?" It scraped again and Atlas blinked her eyes open. "You've got some blood around your mouth and your shivering."
"It's not a bug, it's the new meds," John sighed. "I also had to give you lorazepam so it could be that."
Due to the relaxation of muscles post seizure, someone wetting themselves is an occurrence that is normal.
Begrudgingly, Sherlock did as asked and stood, looking at Mycroft incredulously. Tears still streamed down his lost looking face. Mycroft then put a hand to Sherlock's back and pulled him towards him. Initially, Sherlock didn't react but soon enough he had his face in Mycroft's shoulder and his shaky hands wrapped around his torso.
"It doesn't matter! Me and Sherlock had agreed that there would be no more of this!" John was standing opposite Mycroft. "No more of this threat!"
"I should've guessed. You'll have been dictated to," Sherlock smirked as Atlas smirked back. "Also, fiddle lesson today."
"I do normally but it's good to be reminded on days when I get up before I normally take them," Atlas said with a smile before looking up at Mycroft. "Thank you, Uncle Myc."
"Speaking to her at the front of the classroom." Mrs Pertwee sighed, before nodding over to Mrs Frobisher who's glasses were sliding down her nose. Mrs Pertwee was winning. The head teacher looked at her computer sourcing an email that had been sent through by Mr Ingram - the head for Upper Sixth who was interviewing the students in the room at the time, discluding Sammy and Abayomi as for A) they were a friend of Atlas and B) because they had disappeared from their schedule in the library.
"Even dog food, Rebeard." Atlas said to the dog who looked up at her and she gave a little smile. "Your
"Redbeard, this is loads of warning," She whispered before she got to her feet and made her way over to the stairs but he stood on the bottom step and then sat down again.
"She's visiting." Sherlock announced to Lestrade who looked at him disbelieving anything Sherlock says.
Sherlock looked at her gently. "It's alright, sweetheart." He reached out a hand and placed it on her knee. "Do I need to get out?"
"Yeah," Atlas grinned at him. "I haven't been to see her since I went into hospital." Her face fell fast and she just stared at him quietly.
"Yeah, papa." Atlas smiled softly as Sherlock tugged again, without causing her any pain. "I want to go home."
"I'm sorry," Atlas replied swiftly, looking at him. "I didn't mean it, dad, I didn't mean to say what I said. I promise. I didn't mean it. I love you. I didn't...I'm sorry dad."
"Oh." Atlas said shortly, Sammy signing out to Xerxes what she had said. Atlas watching, she'd picked up quite a lot in the past week and was starting to really enjoy being able to talk to Xerxes properly.
"I don't care. I hate them, I hate them. Go away!" She screamed before turning around showing her face to them. The dark circles under eyes, the trembling hands, the pale complexion. "Go away!" She screamed again putting all her energy into it, gripping her duvet and sustaining the note.
"Mary! My mother was called Mary too!" Rosie exclaimed, Sherlock giving a fond little smile before looking up to John.
"What's wrong? What's happened?" Sherlock said urgently, scanning John's face for information before following his eyeline to Atlas who was very obviously either dissociating or experiencing an absence seizure.
"Yeah." Atlas lied, having just experienced another heard day with none other than Mrs Pertwee. Sammy shot her a look as if to say
Sherlock removed his blazer and slung it over the arm of her chair before beginning to pull away the duvet. A full change of bedding would be necessary so everything could match and a change of duvet, he noted, would also be required. Collecting all the dirty sheets and duvet he began to descend the stairs and he stopped at the foot. Next to the stairs was a little crevice, where, they had a washer, dryer, iron and ironing board that all fit perfectly. (Entirely thanks to Sherlock's meticulous measuring skills, but not thanks to his blatant disregard for anything slightly humane as he had overlooked the need for such items completely.) Opening the door to the washing machine, he tossed the bedding in before setting it to wash and just as he was about to get up from his squatting position he felt eyes on him.
"I'll be home. I should probably go get ready to get on the train." Sammy said, his voice hinting in excitement. "And my mum has said yes but...I think we'll need to speak to social services."
"Yes." Rosie replied, pouting as she looked at Sherlock. Sherlock looked up at John for guidance who just nodded his head once. The adoption papers for Rosie were in the bedside table drawer, awaiting signature and sending. They were going to speak with her about it, but it seems it had already been decided.
"I'm going to have a nap," Atlas said before she leaned against the window, only to have her body pulled into Sam's right side instead. Rosie leaning forward to watch him.
"You got your phone and music Atlas?" John called back but there was no response, she was already listening to the music. "We'll take that as a yes." John had finally let Sherlock drive the car after much debate. Then, Redbeard began snuffling in Rosie's ear making her giggle.
"Drawing you!" She said holding up the image and smiling. She giggled as Sherlock looked at the picture. "It's not finished." She said taking it back and colouring in the rest of the drawing.
"I dreamt I was here." Atlas whispered. "But the man, was here too. The man who I couldn't see and it was just a voice. And it grated in my ears. I was calling for you and papa but you didn't come. He did. And he said things to me. About..." She paused. "Sex. And I don't know where it came from and I didn't know what to do."
"Alright." John said before getting to his feet and kissing Sherlock lightly. "Love you." Sherlock gave a goofy smile up at him.
"Papa!" Rosie exclaimed, looking at him pointedly. She liked granola, Sherlock putting a hand on top of her head.
Timothy smiled at the couple and their children who were happy. All of them surrounded by each other, they seemed love.
"Atlas." John said on the other side of the line. "We're running late, but Sherlock's gotten better." His voice broke and he sounded like he was crying. "Atlas. He remembers the last three months. "
"Right, we'll grab our rucksacks and the dog and head in, yeah?" Sherlock asked as Atlas nodded and got out into the dimly lit car parking block. Herself, Rosie and Sammy had squeezed all their Edinburgh stuff into one rucksack with John and Sherlock doing the same with their belongings. Collecting the dog and the little plastic bag of dog food, bowl, toys, lead and harness they began to walk to the doors.
"Wow!" Atlas signed and spoke as Rosie nodded with a giggle and reached out her hand to Atlas as she took it.
He was singing now, in his pretty singing voice that could light up a whole room and Atlas, her mind a whirlwind, found herself calmed. Safe.
"It was a little weird," Atlas smiled gently. "My teacher in my house. Over on weekends." The she giggled. "But it helped, a lot."
"Of course it's alright, we're going to that Zizzi's next to that shopping centre that's near the London library , will you meet us there?" Harry said.
"Atlas." Sherlock said quietly. His voice sounded hoarse as if he was battling a rising frog in his throat. She assumed that John had mentioned her name more than once to try and jog his unaccounted for memories. Atlas looked back at him. "I really do wish I could remember you."
"No, no it's fine. It's only pyjamas." He laughed before Atlas gave a little chuckle. Sherlock sitting back against the headboard, the book back on his lap. Atlas' face fell to her lap, John placing a careful hand on her shoulder.
"I don't know," Sammy started but then, he went around the corner into the kitchen with a sigh. He looked at it all, the cupboards, the table, the cookie jar where himself and Georgia would put cookies. Then with shoulders high and hunched he plucked a picture Georgia had drawn off the fridge with a frown, Sherlock hanging back at the door. "I should get a bag to put various things in."
"It's alright." Atlas said. "It's not that. Just something happened at school. It's sorted, I'm just tired, that's all." Sherlock just rubbed her back, kissing her hair. He rested his cheek on her head.
"Alright, miss, sandwich," John smiled as Rosie bit into it happily and tilted her head side to side.
"That's nice," John smiled as Sherlock came in with the mint and dropped it into two mugs and brought them to the table. "Thank you, love."
LATER that evening Wanda went upstairs, more concerned than she felt she needed to be. Atlas had only appeared for lunch throughout the whole day and herself and Sammy had professed to binge-watching "Glee" all evening.
"Of course you can come with us, Rosie," May smiled at her. Atlas pulling Rosie into her side as the young girl nodded.
"Well, seems they're rubbing off on me," John smiled as Atlas looked up at him, tears in her eyes. She sniffed a little before looking down again. "Love."
Atlas and Rosie arrived home to see an ambulance outside. They rushed up the stairs, the dog bounding ahead of them as they ascended. Before them an unconscious John was being loaded onto a stretcher, Sherlock looking flustered and concerned. Atlas analysed the cold tea and realised this may have happened some time ago.
"It was so real and I didn't know, I'm-" Atlas sobbed as John rubbed her arms. Sammy sitting on the floor near her bed, reaching out to take one of her hands.
The piano, set up in the corner of the restaurant was on a little platform, intended for open mic nights and such.
going to give up on you." The doctor stopped and looked over to his left, then craned his neck to look behind him. He saw that her dads had woken up and were seemingly waiting to come in. Catching the nurse's eyeline he beckoned for them to come in with his arm.
"You've done such a good job dad." Atlas said smiling at him as she looked over the banister, down to what was about to be their kitchen area.
"You know what it means." Atlas threw at him. John knew what it meant. It meant that he didn't have the gift, it meant that he wasn't entitled to things and it meant that he was an outsider.
"I love you too," John said, an arm wrapped around the boy's shoulder. "Atlas said you needed a chat?"
"No. No, Georgia's fate is sealed. Atlas's isn't." Sammy frowned before instinctively leaning back against John. As John continued to hug him.
"No. I think I'd rather see how Sherlock's doing." Lestrade said kindly. "Do you want a lift there?"
"I told your papa's Aunt Isla that there would be five of you plus Redbeard," Jo said before she looked to John. "I hope I was correct with that."
"So, nuclear weapons then." Eurus laughed before Mycroft shot her a look and they stepped through. The Vault door shut behind them as they went in.
"Put the cloth in there." Atlas said pointing to the big waste bin on the screen. Sherlock tapped it and in went the cloth and the quiet noise of what happened made them chuckle.
"I was just looking at some cases. What are you up to?" Sherlock asked as he watched her play on this weird Easter egg site.
And then Mycroft realised that, within his shallow, insufferable being, he had sent his brother on a mission that was only going to worsen his mental health. Mycroft then vowed to never place another person in a situation like that without thoroughly checking mental and hospital medical records.
"No, no, stop." Sherlock pleaded his hands going out along with Atlas in a gesture to calm down. "Don't do this."
"I have an inheritance." Atlas paused and watched as her words sunk in. "Me and Rosie, we both have an inheritance. Dad said not to talk about it, not to tell you, I mean. But your my pa. My other dad. I can't not tell you about it. So like, it consists of various furniture and quite a lot of money." Her face drops, an uncomfortable pause of silence. "Just don't get mad Papa. Please." She took a deep breath and looked at John again, who seemed to be willing her to go on. "I get more than Rosie. A lot more...because I'm a blood relation." John sighed. "I don't expect you to say anything. Just don't get mad at dad either. He doesn't have a say in where the items actually go." Pause as she looked up and John looked mildly pissed off. She shook. " Grandma and Grandad's things are split between the two of us. But my great grandmother Olive's, my great grandfather George, my great grandmother Josie and my great grandfather William. All their things go to me. Money, paintings, instruments. All because I'm a blood relation." She gave a short laugh at that and brushed away a single tear. "But Rosie's his daughter just as much as I am. As much as I hope I am just as much of a daughter to you. And you know, I hate it. I hate having all this secret, family wealth. I hate it." Another pause of contemplation. "'Spose dad didn't want to hurt your feelings.
"Let me go." Atlas said sternly. "Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Please, let me go. Let me go. Let me go." She said into the darkness before the world, if it were at all possible, when darker than the room around her.
"Ah yes," John sighed. "And as I've been told, a tangle teaser is the worst thing to use on a combination of thick
"You know, I don't mind it." Atlas said after their laughter had died down. "Just don't go calling me something weird like pumpkin pie or honey. Definately not honey."
"CAN we take Redbeard for a walk while we're out?" Atlas asked as she looked up at her papa with a smile.
"I have assembled you together today for several reasons," Mycroft smiled before it dropped and he looked around the room, his eyes flitting to the ceiling. "Firstly, it has come to my attention that my dear niece, Ida, might appreciate a family gathering considering the most recent circumstances. The loss of a friend is never an easy one. And there is sure to have been an air of great saddness shrouding the house for a while following John Senior's death. I have also heard about Georgia Walters and from my understanding Samuel Walters is to be staying within this household for a few weeks starting tommorow morning." Mycroft stopped, gestured with his hands, opened his mouth and then shut it again. "Secondly, it has been a while since we have gathered altogether and as my brother and sister have repeatedly told me, sentiment is found in the winning side." He paced a few moments more before he stopped and looked to the awaiting faces. "And finally, Sherlock has, unfortunately, dropped off our radar."
ATLAS woke with a start, sweat pouring down her face, hair matted and she immediately looked for Sherlock. Who was alone in the room and sitting on the couch. Mindful of her stitches she looked at him, rolled over and sat up.
"Atlas." John said taking her face between his two hands. "Atlas, look at me." The girl turned to look at him as she looked afraid. "It's alright. Your safe." Atlas looked at him before looking at the body.
John walked over to Sherlock and reached a hand up to touch his cheek but the sharp snap of his head away, from John's hand asserted the mood. They weren't
"Yep, well remembered," Sherlock smiled at her as they pulled into the driveway, Atlas spotting the for sale sign. "Hello!" He exclaimed to a lady as he hopped out.
Eventually, they managed to make the end of the hallway as they stepped into Mycroft's office. As usual Sherlock didn't so much as look at him, however Atlas smiled at him nervously.
"Everyone keeps saying that to me," John sighed with a small smile before Sherlock kissed him some more. "Not tonight." John said and Sherlock withdrew, nodding before kissing John's cheek.
"She died, Rosie." Sherlock said looking down at her. Always so blunt, so harsh but Rosie lapped it up. Atlas shifted in her chair uncomfortably, eyes still trained on the book.
"You don't have to. You can still do your jobs and go to work and I don't know, see me on weekends." Atlas said, retracting her hand. "I want you to."
"Alright then." John sighed as they approached the land rover and hopped in, not before John had fastened Rosie into her carseat however.
"Because, they're at threat just from being our children. Rosie's at threat because her mother was a secret agent, Sam's at risk...because well he's Sam and Atlas..." John frowned.
"Papa what?" Atlas asked putting an arm around his back and leaning her temple against his shoulder.
"Fuck you!" He screamed as he picked up another book and threw it again. "Fuck you! Why'd you do that!? I needed you! Fuck you! Fuck you!"
"It was nice to meet you." John smiled before showing her out as Sammy packed up his guitar, leaving the room.
"Stop," A voice whispered. "I know how much you need to break things and destroy everything but it's okay. It's okay, Ida. I've got you."
"Your never lost for words." John laughed, and then his eyes caught Sherlock's and he held the other's man gaze for a moment.
"Thank you, Ro," Atlas said quietly and then she pulled away and looked at her. "Promise you won't say it again?"
"You can," John said as he stroked her cheek with his unplastered hand and she clamped a hand beside his ear.
"Atlas, sweetheart," Sherlock said as he wrapped an arm around her back in comfort. "What does my beautiful, wonderful, clever little girl require of her amazing, brilliant incredible father?"
"Papa," Atlas frowned. "I should know and I'm telling you now, I don't need a mum your my mum and my dad. You make me so happy and loved and I just-" She paused. "Your crying, you always cry when I speak."
"Dad!" Atlas shouted down the hallway, wrapped in a towel to cover herself. Only her head was visible in the doorway.
"Ah." Mrs Frobisher sighed before she thought about her next action. "I still feel we need to suspend her as for she reportedly spoke to Mrs Pertwee afterwards. Heated words."
Second was Redbeard. Hit by a car. She watched it happen. Tried to run into the road and see him but no-one would let her. She started to run, running and running until she ended up in a hospital ward. The sound of a flatline filling her ears as she screamed out in pain. And she ran some more.
"Hold on, I'm just getting to the good part." Sherlock said smiling to himself as he opened his mouth to speak.
"Maybe because I'm on my own side." She said before heading off down another corridor, Mycroft following on interestedly.
"Of course we know that," John said before he stood and sat on the bed near her. "Atlas, you need to go to sleep."
And then she held the sink again and looked around the room before back to the mirror. She put her eyes on the eyes in the mirror and she frowned. How tired she looked? How upset? And then she saw her dad in the mirror behind her.
"What if he leaves me and dad now? What if they leave me? I...can't...I've hurt dad before and he's okay but John's harder. What if they put me in psych...what if...what if?" Atlas asked before Mycroft sat her down on the bed, turned over a plastic chair and sat by her bedside.
hurt. Dislocated. Not sure when that happened. Heart rate: erratic. Not good for the seizures. Medication: not working. Rosie: screamed. Where? The lodge. John. Sherlock. Eurus. Mycroft. Wanda. Timothy. Redbeard. Atlas. Atlas. Breathe. Not too much. About that. It'll be okay. It'll be okay. It'll be o-
"A Redbeard dog. The dog he could never have but always wanted." Atlas explained. "I want to try get a rehomed dog. I don't think we could handle a puppy."
EACH paint tin was in the appropriate rooms as everyone got their painting overalls on - well that group literally consisted of Sally, Atlas, Molly and Greg whilst Sherlock said that he would just do it in what he was wearing. He didn't seem to care.
"It's strange to find walking down the street a game." Atlas began her mouth speaking what her brain thought without a filter. "Do you ever find it get's to be too much sometimes?"
"No your not," Sherlock reassured. "I promise you-" He paused. "Atlas, look at me." He clamped his hands either side of her face. "You are not her. Your my baby. My little girl and you are
"Oh, okay." Atlas said hopping off her counter and going upstairs. When she got in her new room she saw an A4 cardboard box on her bed. Walking over, she picked up the box and opened it up. Her eyes stung and went blurry as she saw what it was.
brought the arrival of sheet music, the piano and both of the violins, along with some of Atlas' personal items from her room. They'd conveniently arranged for the stuff to move over whilst John was working and Rosie was at nursery - Mrs Hudson said she would pop by later that afternoon to have a little look as it was Molly and Andrew's turn to take Rosie. The music landing was starting to take shape, the piano up against the back wall, sofas with a coffee table. A writing desk on the side of the staircase. Drawers in various spots across the landing containing sheet music that Sherlock and Atlas shared. They also took that moment to sort through it and put them in appropriate drawers which were later labelled - Sherlock and Atlas having a whole drawer each for personal compositions. A coloured rug on the floor for purchase against the wood.
"Yep," Sherlock smiled, his face gentle. "Come on, I'll grab your weighted blanket." He lifted it up and then went to the door. "I love you." He said to Atlas who was hot on his heels.
ONCE Sherlock and John had left the house, Timothy let out a sigh and got up and moved into the kitchen. There Mycroft followed him into the kitchen.
They had been called to the case late last night and returned this morning when a second murder had happened. It was as if they were playing a real life game of winky murder. Atlas was preoccupied elsewhere looking after Rosie. It wasn't a common occurrence as for Rosie would normally stay with Mrs Hudson or maybe Molly if she was free. However, Atlas would normally join them and help complete the investigation.
She already had tears streaming down her face and she felt herself slowly starting to lose all control.
"I can't dad," Atlas said quietly as she shut her eyes tight. John entered, placed the shopping on the floor and watched, Sammy hot on his heels.
He thought of her playing duets with Sherlock, the songs she wrote becoming the melody's of her heart. The way she waltzed round the room with Rosie at christmas, the lights in the background. How funny she was and how much of a brilliant mind she had. How quick she was to pick things up, to love. And oh how she loved people. Another sob came out his throat as he just clutched at her cheek, a tear falling onto her blue face. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." He choked, thinking of all the times again and more. Books & Beans.
"Because they are a different type." Atlas smiled quietly looking at her. "And I know it was scary..."
"Seems like they have more to do. Would you like some tea?" John offered, Mrs Hudson looked him up and down as if to say
"It's alright, John," Sherlock whispered, barely holding the tears in himself as he hugged John's legs. "Whilst not practical, I'm not sure how else to comfort you."
"Why are you so cool?" Sammy asked as he followed Rosie up the folding ladder. It resembled a loft ladder as an oppose to a rope ladder, for it to be more sturdy.
"There you go!" Atlas exclaimed laughing before Mycroft got the hint and reluctantly pulled on his dark blue one. Then they started their food.
"They're bringing Basa Kejeree and some other things and then we're going to have a get together with May and Xerxes and-" Sherlock stopped and looked at the two women. "Would you two like to stay for tea? Your welcome to?"
"Tea? Coffee?" Greg said in the dim lit hotel room. He'd been staying there since he'd split with his wife. His face unshaven, a beard seriously threatening to grow in an aging grey. Both his daughters, Amy and Louise, had stayed with their mother who basically owned the house they had been living in. Though she was in the wrong, Greg was the one living in a hotel room. Alone. And now, just that morning he'd been sent a message from his ex-wife saying she was moving to France with her new partner Tomaz and they were taking the girls. His little girls. He was going to lose them.
ATLAS sat in the window reading a book, Rosie sitting near her feet colouring in her map again. The dog had lain down next to Rosie, his nose putting snot on her map. This was normal for people based case days. There they couldn't be seen, Rosie was largely self sufficient as commonly she would nap against the dog.
"Seizures." Sherlock said quietly as John took the young girl's hands into his own. "Petit and Grand Mal, if I remember correctly. They weren't bad when you were younger, usually just the absence seizures." His head directed towards her.
Atlas stuttered a nod. "So take some deep breaths." Sherlock reassured, rubbing her knees again. "And we're going to sit with you."
Disclaimer: I am a Scottish student in a Scottish school. Therefore my knowledge on schools in England is INCREDIBLY poor. Therefore I just want to say that I may not be the best at writing and understanding Atlas in school/college. I have researched but with the whole age thing...
"You wish you were back out there sometimes, don't you?" Sherlock asked as he came over and slid under the covers next to John, his head resting on his shoulder.
"Different book genre to normal?" Timothy said sitting on the sofa near Atlas. She looked up momentarily and nodded.
"I'm not as scared as I was. But I sort of am." Atlas muttered. "I'm scared of a lot of things that I really don't want to admit to if I'm honest. I'm scared of the usual things like going blind and have a slight problem with dolls. But I'm also scared of the future, mainly my future. All these people know what they want to do and who they want to be and I...well I just don't. I know, I know you've both said that I'm smart enough to do what I want but I don't want that. I don't want something that is accumulated through a mass of academic qualifications like you guys. I don't - I don't want that."
I know, I know, I continued this story and STILL haven't managed to write anything explicit yet. This Sherlock just seems to have so many thoughts and feelings (and hunger) that insist on being addressed. I've already started the next chapter, though, so with hope and help from sexy muses, I will - for lack of a better metaphor - 'pop my smut cherry' in the next update. (That sounds gross...)
“I... Wh-” John stammers. It’s all too much, the horrid day, this Twilight Zone version of his friend. He’s speechless. He can only scoff and stare incredulously.
The way your skin feels taut as you surface from sleep makes it seem as though you really had taken a nap on the leather couch and gotten stuck. Maybe all of this morning had been an elaborate dream brought on by
You want to be angry, to curse your transport for making you seem like a frail, swooning maiden, but the thought is dashed away by a shove to your hips hard enough to send you sprawling back on the mattress again. Dazed, missing the warmth of him, you watch John make short work of his trouser button and zip. Your own straining cock practically lifts you off the bed in its enthusiastic response to this turn of events. You blink at the sensation of a hand resting on your shin. John has balanced himself there as he bends forward, pulling at socks and the legs of his jeans. When he stands again, he is fully nude and
Judging by the widening of his eyes, John is just as surprised as you are. The entire world holds its breath.
“You’re so handsome.” He breathes, rubbing a thumb over your right cheekbone. It’s your turn to laugh, a low, self-deprecating chuckle. You try to turn your face down, away from the praise, but John holds fast. “Seriously, Sherlock. You’re stunning.”
“I am not!” You protest, but a few more barely-there kisses in a similar spot have you flinching against your will. John’s look of self-satisfaction is barely tolerable. “Ok - Ah! Stop!
2) Sorry about the really short chapter. I hit a bit of a mental block and work decided to be horrid this week. One may have caused the other?
And yet... here he was plodding through the whys of the warm bloom that spreads in his chest at the sight of stale biscuits.
When he is finally home, John hangs his sodden jacket and worthless umbrella, and runs his hands through his hair to stop it dripping down his forehead. His plan is to go upstairs to his room, change out of his cold, wet clothes and maybe get a hot shower, but only a couple of stairs up he hears his name called. He takes a shuddering breath and turns, carefully resisting the rising pressure to absolutely unload how bad his day was if Sherlock so much as hints that something around the house needs done. The very last thing he needs after this wretched day is a shouting match.
A warm shower followed by dry, comfortable clothes later, and John is back in the (clean!) sitting room on the sofa enjoying still hot take-out Sherlock had ordered while he was in the bathroom. The other man wasn’t sitting, however. Honestly, he still seemed a bit on edge. John watches him set his shoulders and reach for the violin case, and smiles. He nearly always enjoys his personal mini violin concerts. The few exceptions are when Sherlock is in a foul mood and tends to elicit noises more like an angry, tortured cat.
“Amenable to what, exactly?” John wasn’t quite falling for it. He knew Sherlock too well, and right now, his flatmate was acting downright odd - even for the world’s only consulting detective. Clearly his comfort level with all things emotion-based was shaky at best, but this was a bit beyond even that.
“Something she said in there made me start thinking. And the more I did, the more I realized what an idiotic prick I was. Her whole job was sex and attraction, and she could see what I’d been trying to hide for the sake of my... I don’t know... Pride? Identity? It was stupid, and I’m sorry. I don’t have to be gay to find you utterly gorgeous.” John sighs, brushing a thumb over your jaw softly. “It doesn’t matter what I am, what matters is that I think you are amazing.”
The cab ride was taking longer than expected as the traffic decided to be hateful. Even John’s rather remarkable well of patience was beginning to flag and Sherlock could see the tension around the doctor’s eyes. He growls both from his own patience was completely spent, and because this might actually be a bad idea. Was his experiment ruined already?
I think I've hit a little bit of a stride with writing? That being said, I know there are probably changes in tense or weird typos.
Riding the high of the previous day’s success, Sherlock decides to plough forward with the more difficult of his experiments. “Quality Time”. After some additional research, he develops a plan. John had expressed interest some months ago about doing an activity outside the flat (thank you, Mind Palace for saving that nugget) so he purchases them two tickets to the SEA LIFE Aquarium online. It’s suitably out of the flat, as requested, and thankfully it is a weekday so it will hopefully not be crawling with shrieking children in a confined, acoustic space. The thought makes Sherlock shudder.
One or both of you groan into the shared space of your mouths. It’s hard to tell which, all brain function is focused intently on the sense of touch. Though you don’t remember moving or even opening your eyes, the next thing you feel (besides wet kisses and warm, roaming hands) is the edge of a mattress knocking into the back of your knees. You tilt back, flailing your arms in a less-than-graceful attempt to remain standing, fail, and sit down hard. Cheeks hot, you wait for John to laugh at you for a third time but it doesn’t come. Instead, he crowds into your space. His hands hold your jaw and more kisses appear on your forehead, nose, cheeks. Every square centimetre of skin available on your face is covered with John’s lips.
Questions flood into your mind with bright chasers of panic because you can’t answer any of them. How long? When? How? Why me? Why? How did I miss it? Me?
This is not a song fic, buuuut since the last chapter had a song to go with it, I decided to include this for your listening pleasure because it made me giggle while I wrote this:
“It’s fine.” Came John’s quiet response. “I’d be happy to help.” This was more gentle than the detective anticipated, which, frankly, did nothing to alleviate the twist in his chest. Hope, however, did rush through him that this experiment may work after all.
And so, you both stand there, hip to hip, looking in each other's eyes as a bubble of ‘What now?’ expands into the space. Before the hesitation can grow awkward, you lean to press a soft chaste kiss to John’s mouth and murmur softly against his lips, intentionally dropping your voice low so he can feel it as well as hear it.
Not Beta-Read, but I did change my writing program to "English - UK" so it would update the spelling of certain words. If you find any glaring grammatical errors please let me know, I would very much like it to read smoothly.
He hears John’s scoff before turning to look at his face flip through expressions. Was this the right thing? Soon the knot of worry dissolves as he watches his blogger scoot over to an exhibit entirely filled with clown fish and stares with his mouth slightly open. Sherlock lets out a breath, and wonders why he had been holding it. Nevermind that. His experiment is working!
“I...” He stops, the words catch in his throat. Your blood is immediately infused with ice water. Before you can wriggle away and curl into a ball – protect the soft, exposed parts both mentally and physically –John's arms clamp around under your arms and grab at the back of your neck, holding firm.
Since his gaze is elsewhere, you are forced to speak aloud. “John...” You try to pour a lot into that one syllable: It’s okay; Don’t be scared; Please don’t leave; How exactly did you expect to keep this a secret forever?; What do we do now?
Sherlock says nothing, but taps his cheekbone, just underneath his left eye, which twinkles with mischief. He isn’t certain John will suss out his meaning immediately, but he has faith he will grasp it once they get there. If they get there. He scans the outside of the cab grimly, internally cursing London traffic.
As he sets the tea cup and plate on the kitchen table and continues down the hall to his bedroom, another thought slides by. This one dimmer and nearly missed in his increasingly fatigued state: Did John feel this warmth when he thought of Sherlock? Is that why he set out tea despite knowing Sherlock would not drink it? The detective falters in his stride, a tightness in his throat that he recognizes as anxiety makes him take an involuntary deep breath. Sherlock mimics the face-first fall back into viscous emotions by tipping himself fully clothed face-first into bed. It was too much to contemplate right now, and sincerely hopes sleep will come soon.
A dark chuckle is your only reply. Thankfully, John doesn’t appear to be mean spirited enough to tickle further, but somehow you know this information will be used against you at some point in the future. You open your mouth to lay out, in no uncertain terms, that this is to be kept in absolute confidence but fingertips hook under the elastic band of your pants and the only sound you manage to make is a quiet gasp. Dark blue eyes, mostly black, look up into yours, searching. You raise your jaw minutely, taking in a deep breath, and then nod. John grips the fabric more firmly and steps onto the floor, pulling as he goes. He kisses down your left hip, over your thigh and suckles gently at the inside of your knee when the boxers fall to the floor.
“Of course, I remember.” Your voice is a bit more clipped than you meant it. You had been annoyed about being wrong about Irene’s body and John had shouted about being ‘Not Gay’. Not exactly a great memory, given the current circumstances.
I wanted to make a longer(ish) chapter to make up for the last one being so short. Please let me know what you think?
The flat was quiet and dark, so he makes to grab himself a bite of something before turning in for good. Before he is able to leave the threshold of his door, though, his foot catches on something in the dark. The noise of the plate upending sounds more like an explosion in the quiet, and Sherlock leaps back a few feet like a startled cat. He gropes at the wall to flip on the light, and is met with the sight of what used to be a plate of biscuits, now scattered on the floor and a (thankfully unharmed) cup of tea.
“Forgive me, my manners have been terrible.” John pulls the last two buttons free of his shirt between your bodies. You can feel his knuckles graze your abdomen and the muscles there flutter in response. In a series of smooth, efficient movements, John pulls the sleeves of his button-down shirt down and off, and yanks the vest over his head so he is naked from the waist up. Your jaw falls open, pulling your bottom lip free of your teeth. Before you have a chance to fully
“Fuck! Fuck yes, Sherlock, oh my god.” He thrusts into your roiling spasms, prolonging it until you wonder if you may suffocate. John lets out a strangled groan above you and the feeling of his release inside you forces a gasping breath so you can shout his name. Time stops moving for a while. All there is now is swimming in warm, damp light...
After a while, John’s arms slither back to press himself up. He sniffs with a mixture of finality and chagrin.
He sets his teeth when it is so obvious the second it snaps into place; John. Of course, it’s John. That particular warmth accompanies his flatmate often lately. He sighs quietly again, reaching to pick up the dishes. If the intention behind John leaving them there was that of beneficence, then it’s only fair he clean them up... Right? Had he ever done this before? Likely not, the motion was unfamiliar.
“No.” Sherlock interrupts, using his best playful voice. He stands, setting the computer aside. Sliding his hand into his pockets, he gives his blogger a smirk. “Boring. Let’s go out.”
The differences are really quite obvious, but that’s not the point of this excursion. He reminds himself with a determined frown. Instead, he comments on the bright colors and makes a joke about the animal wearing one of John’s jumpers.
That new room in the Palace is going to be a whole wing to itself before too long. The eye contact is nearly tactile, centering your thoughts down to a tight focus. You drop the sliver of toast on the plate and rub your fingers on the pad of your thumb to dislodge any clinging crumbs. John takes the hint beautifully and rises to his feet, holding out his right hand in an offer to help you stand with him.
A thought pulls at John’s subconscious. Why? And the more he tugged at the thread of this thought, the more thoughts and feelings came loose. He starts to recognize patterns in Sherlock’s behavior the last week or so that he hadn’t pieced together before. Before long, there is a tightness in his chest when he looks up at the tall, dark violinist and he is adrift in more than just the sea of the music.
It doesn’t take long for the contact to become heated again. John pushes forward as to be partially on top of you, sliding his hand up to your shoulder blade and back down over your lower back, hip and thigh until he hooks his fingers around your knee and pulls it over his hip. Your groins connect and you feel the blood-hot skin of his cock directly on yours for the first time. You break the kiss with a gasp and press your forehead to his to take panting breaths.
that trip him up as if wading through molasses and it’s statistically a painful process. Honestly, best to avoid it as much as possible.
Written in 1995, Dr. Chapman’s work was practically ancient in terms of scientific writing, but he figures it is a good place to start none-the-less as he begins to read...
Emotion threatens to overwhelm you. Your vision wavers and you close your eyes to shutter up any tears. Not again. That was enough for today. Clearing your throat, you fall into being playful instead. When you open your eyes again, you adopt the most obnoxiously regal accent you can muster.
He finishes with a tilt of his head and toothy smile, trying to make his inquiry look innocent. Though, in retrospect he’s been told that comes across as creepy. He keeps his pale eyes steady on John’s, hoping the eye contact will solidify his trustworthiness. Somewhere behind his facade, he hears himself think
When John’s eyes find yours again, you notice they are shiny with unfallen tears, but his face is set and stubborn. You like that face, it means he’s made up his mind about something. A spark of excitement flash through your mind and travel down your spine, not even remembering that barely an hour ago you were bored to the point of trying to melt into the sofa. How is it possible for John Watson to get even more fascin-
Rosie settled back in his lap as he began reading, the young girl clutching the dinosaur to her chest.
"I'll take her up to bed." Sherlock smiled, allowing John to plant a kiss on her forehead and Atlas to ruffle her hair slightly before going up. John watched as Sherlock negotiated the steps and entered the small room.
"You knew that I was with Mary." John said quietly. "And that you'd made the vow. God, I'm sorry Sherlock. If I'd known..."
"I adopted her." John smiled and the way he said it mad him sound like he wanted to burst. "And I know you maybe think that's biza-"
"She's got blood in her vomit." Mycroft said concerned as the doctor instantly came over. The man frowned, before putting a stethoscope to her chest.
Walking up to it her feet felt like lead, mind racing, heart thumping, mouth gone dry. Standing there, she felt....well lonely and suddenly she wanted her dad. This was all too much, too much to think about too much to, to, to, to cope with. How did people do this? How did people manage to visit people to love? She was halfway there and she just kept walking, mechanically, robotically. And there, James Buchannnan. The name etched on the stone as if it were yesterday.
"Some wasberries," she answered. The favourite fruit seemingly much more appetising as Sherlock took them out the bag, and then filled a plastic container he had brought with some of the fruit. "Thank you, dad." Rosie said before she walked over to John and climbed into his lab.
"Brave to have only the two of you and the children." Jo said, however, she did not come across annoyed but as if she was fully accepting of the decision.
"They were probably up late last night," John said, smiling into his rear view mirror. "Thank god, we have a moments peace."
They continued like that, for hours, laughing about names that Sherlock couldn't remember and names that Mycroft got wrong.
"Waiting for you to put your mug of tea down." Atlas huffed before John removed the mug from his lips and looked at her.
He kneeled next to Sherlock, squeezing his shoulder tightly. Sherlock looked at him once, with that look in his eyes. The one he couldn't quite place. And that scared him.
"Always. Now, I need to ask you something. I can get you a GP appointment or, because I am one, I can refer you to an epilepsy specialist who will look into whether it's epilepsy or just non-epileptic seizures. I know that that's where a GP would be heading you for." John said before she pulled away and looked at him.
"Yeah." Atlas sighed before she rubbed her nose against his shoulder. "I just put snot on your t-shirt by accident..." Atlas giggled. "Sorry."
Sherlock silently nodded taking a sip of his tea. He reached a hand over and took her own and in a moment she felt happy. It was strange that her father could do that but she seemed relaxed. "And then sometimes my brain works to fast and I can't get the words out my mouth fast enough." Sherlock laughed, Atlas joining in.
"What did I say to you, Atlas?" Sherlock asked her but she just shook her head and clamped her hands harder over her eyes. Sherlock moved then to let John in who pulled her despite protests to his chest.
"I know you said I didn't hurt him but I can't help thinking I did. When I had the second seizure," Atlas said quietly.
"Dad?" Atlas asked, approaching her father from behind. "Will you come with me to walk the dog?" Sherlock looked behind him at his daughter walked towards him. Her eyes were soft - as normal, he had noted, around family.
"Unfortunately it would seem that way." Atlas whispered, John being the only person to hear. He put a hand on her not painful shoulder gave a gentle squeeze before she looked up again. "So what do you want us to do?"
There was silence, no applause as each individual looked at another, before coming to their own conclusion.
The dog had been sad seeing as he hadn't seen him and Atlas was even more depressed. Sherlock was due home at the end of the day and she had done very little. To her surprise Mrs Hudson had returned home momentarily, spoken to Atlas before departing the building.
"Opus.3. No.45." Sherlock said as Atlas took up her violin and played along with him. Some of it she made up into a duet and other parts she just played other things. She didn't need to know the tune or the composer or whether it was a symphony or not, she would always know this song. The one he played before she was put into care. Slowly, they started another piece however Atlas stopped and looked at Sherlock.
"Oh," John replied shortly before sighing. "If I'd known I would have been able to get to you sooner."
"She's going to be upset for a while but going to Scotland, that'll be a bit of a drag away. She has lots to make her sad." John said before Sherlock disappeared into their en suite.
"Oh, love." John said slipping an arm around her shoulder and reading some of what she had written so far. "That's not too far, you can still speak to her."
"Ouch." Sherlock said as he peeled back her hair to look at the cut across her head. "That's going to sting..." Sherlock got up and raked around in the cupboard for some plasters and gauze tape, collecting some antiseptic wipes while he was at it. "I'm not as good as papa...but it needs looking at." He sat back down and laughed when Atlas handed him her glasses to help him see it better.
"LET'S see how you two work as a team, shall we?" The speaker said to the room containing Eurus and Mycroft together. They looked each other before the floor disappeared into a maze of steps and stairways.
"Once upon a time yes but I'm not fit enough, not anymore," John frowned before he looked at Sherlock. "Are you happy? With this?"
"Okay." He said before saying it to her, Atlas storing it in the appropriate places in her mind palace.
Little did she know, but Sherlock had also expressed an interest in a little second hand citygo by Skoda. He was well aware they were little bit off time for Atlas learning to drive. Yet, he wanted to be prepared. He'd already spoken to John about it.
"No, I'm going to do it." Sherlock said as he held a pair of scissors in his hand. Slowly he held the scissors above the wire until he paused. His gut was telling him something and he couldn't snip the wire. So in quick thought as the ten second count down began he snipped a different wire. Nothing happened. Then he came to the realisation it was a hoax, someone wanted to get under his skin.
"Oh. I don't know. I'd maybe see some friends." Mrs Hudson lied, unaware that three people were keen eyed watching her.
"Keep it down." He scolded before going over to see why she was making such a fuss. "Why are you up so early anyway?"
"But I don't. I look like you. I looked like you when I was seven years old." Atlas announced her heart pounding loudly in her ears. Did this mean that Sherlock was admitting it? Saying it was true?
"There's a text from Sherlock," John said. "They got there and he's sitting with her now. They're going to run all the tests and...oh for fucks sake...there doing a spinal tap."
"You had another one," Rosie said quietly before putting both hands on the bed and attempting to climb but when she couldn't quite get up, Sammy lifted her instead. "Thank you, Sam." She then wriggled under the covers next to Atlas. "Atlas?"
"Oh, thank you!" He smiled. "I was experimenting with more colours and I wasn't sure it was working. Of course, I like green eyes and blonde hair but it's hard to colour match with it right."
"Yeah, work was okay. But I hear you weren't." John said with a sad smile as Atlas approached him again after stopping.
"And John, John was just giggling away," Sherlock said patting his thigh with a grin and dazzled eyes.
"You are distributing them!" She exclaimed, looking at her Uncle, then back to the pile of books. They were the new copies of the book she had helped her grandfather edit. She didn't think Mycroft had enough of a heart to do so. Then again she shouldn't be surprised, he was part of the reason her little sister was still walking. Her eyes then went to Eurus who was playing chess with herself in the window seat.
"The doctor's don't know yet. But they believe she has been poisoned." Sherlock said, trying his best to sound collected.
"Yeah," Atlas sighed before she got to her feet looked and Sammy and flopped onto the bed before sitting up. "I'm so bored though."
alone? With a small smiled he made is way around the room, collecting her perfume and holding it up to his nose he took a gentle sniff and looked back around the room. And then, with a frown, he put it down and looked back. Her scarf, her
"Dear brother." Mycroft said to Sherlock a his brother simply frowned at him before removing his goggles. Quietly Atlas moved the book higher to obscure her face a little bit more, however the dark curls were highly likely to give the game away. John frowned getting to his feet to stop anything from happening between the often unhappy siblings.
"John," Sherlock said again before he leaned forward and hugged him, his hand still tucked between them.
"I have to go see Georgia." Sammy frowned and Atlas nodded, her hand reaching out to take his. The oxygen mask sat a little wonky on her face and reaching out a kind, gentle hand to right it. "How long have you had the mask on for?"
"It is," Atlas smiled, scanning her eyes over the map. "Can we...I don't...could we just go sit by the edge of this loch? I think I remember it and I think I just want to sit with you."
"It's not important because it's in the past!" Sherlock shouted back at her. John was obviously going to have to be the peace keeper in the shouting match that was about to ensue.
"And I've made you a special one. The biggest cupcake is for you!" Rosie exclaimed, looking at Atlas with a wide grin. "And it's the best one! It's the biggest and best bestest one!"
She then looked to her dad who was lying on his front, the way she liked to lie, his arm stretched over to touch John's shoulder.
"It is probably terminal. If you want to try to fight it, the best hospital is Manchester and I can get you a spot there in two days."
"Ida." Sherlock answered as he continued studying the file he was looking at. John gave him a pointed look causing him to look up. "Her name is Ida Atlas Elizabeth Holmes. I suppose she thought Ida and Elizabeth were too boring."
"She needed a laptop too." Sherlock said as John looked over to it. He smiled at the yellow bedding and curtains, bright colours laced throughout. Yellow cushions and striped cushions on the window seat.
"Take a guess," Sherlock said as a tear fell from his eye. "My fault really, I forgot about your-your me-medic-ine."
John was gesturing to Sherlock who had been dead to the world for forty minutes solid. It wasn't surprising seeing as the man hardly slept. However the man did sleep more now that Atlas was living with them and now that Rosie was starting to get a little older.
JOHN stood in the doorway to Atlas's room and looked over to where she was sitting crossed legged on her bed. When he entered and carefully shut the door with a slow and gentle click, she looked up.
"Eight." John said excitedly. "That's the most she's said that isn't a quote from a book or a fact. It's her minds independent thought." John smiled as his partner, who smiled in return. Sherlock looked mildly excited by this fact, only for his face to fall humorously again. John didn't notice, intact no-one did, but the fact was that while yes eight words was a lot, she'd said it in a room full of people she could trust. And no doubt she would say more in time. What worried Sherlock most was that she wouldn't speak in public. She still after two years of being able to speak infront of John and Sherlock, she was still timid. She was late to develop some form of noise that mildly resembles speech at two and both he and John knew this. Rosie wasn't simply shy, she was anxious to speak infront of people. Sherlock still couldn't get his head around the thought of her having anxiety at four. Still a young and tender age, yet what could he do. Her birthday was in two days, so on Wednesday. Maybe she would speak more then.
"Yeah Ro?" Atlas asked the younger girl who looked up at her. They were nearing the main path now where Rosie started spotting ladybugs and butterflies on the just lit footpath.
"Not good," John sighed rubbing his face with the palms of his hands. "She's started getting flashbacks and fainting episodes and the seizures, while slowly becoming less are becoming longer, more sustained and quite violent."
"You'll learn what's wrong with her tonight in time." John smiled, Atlas smiling too. However, when the five year old looked at him like it was the most stupidest thing he had ever said, he changed what he was saying. "She's got a headache and it's making her feel sick."
"Your the only one without patients that day. That's why we have you on four appointment days and one "free" day." The man said, over his lunch box, his hands out. He was the man in charge of everything from timetabling and when certain people did what. Oversaw all the doctors and things like that. "Your the only one."
"But not the photos," Sammy whispered as he picked up a photo of himself, his mother, Georgia and his dad and his....CAT!!! "Mou? Mou!"
"I can see that," John said, reappearing and handing Sherlock the coffee before sitting down on the bed on the other side of Atlas.
"Yup," Atlas smiled. "Sammy had a cat called Mou so she's living with us and Aunty Eurus is looking after her while we're away."
"Sammy's dad died just a few weeks back." Atlas quipped as they continued along the pavement. Everyone went quiet before they kept going, nearly at the cafe. When they got there, they all sat around the table. It was a large table to best accommodate the group of 9.
"Bloody clarinets," Atlas answered and John chuckled as Rosie pulled him to the floor to show him her practising of drawing a treble, bass, tenor and alto clef.
"Is it a land rover?" John asked, before Sherlock gave a smile and pulled up outside the house. "That was quite quick."
"You'll get out when I say." Mrs Pertwee said, before gesturing for Atlas to come inside. She stepped into the small room, glancing at the wallpaper, the photos, the shoes, the phone number scrawled on a post-it next to the phone, the metal filing cabinet, the yellow handbag. Now she turned her attention to Mrs Pertwee. The tied back hair in a clip, the cold brown eyes, the harsh makeup that did nothing to flatter her old age wrinkles. "Sit." Mrs Pertwee instructed and Atlas did so, the minutes of lunchtime running away. Silence filled the room as Mrs Pertwee pulled out her pasta and began to eat, Atlas shuffling in her seat in nervous habit. "Holmes."
Atlas went up to bed early, going to sleep once changed. She had been tired all day and so was glad of the opportunity to sleep. Rosie was still downstairs, playing with Redbeard now though until Sherlock told her it was time she went to bed.
"We'll go to bed," Atlas said before kissing both her parents on the cheek, smiling at her dad before leaving. Sammy doing similar.
"Sherlock," John heaved before he looked up and reached out his hands to take Sherlock's, the younger man almost sitting on his feet.
A jab in her back and she was out. Cold. The world seeping to a blacker black than the one she was in.
"Was it too tight?" Sherlock asked bewildered, looking like a deer in headlights as he looked at her concerned.
"Hello." Sherlock said stroking the dog's head. John shared a happy look with Atlas who just smiled wildly. "Hello." The dog licked his face making the childish adult laugh. Then he opened his package to reveal the collar as he tied it around the dogs neck.
"Yes finally, that's what your dad was saying all of last night." John huffed before Atlas slowly walked over and slipped her arms around his waist.
"Yeah, my cheek is just tingling a little." Atlas laughed before Doctor Aduba came around and touched it.
"Oh." Was all Atlas said before she went back to typing something in the notes of the new book she was planning to write with Timothy.
The talk continued, Atlas sitting back down, whilst the gaze of her peers and teachers lingered on. And Atlas thanked her lucky stars that her pa, was one hell of a father.
THURSDAY brought a day of study period's and free periods to an emotionally defeated Atlas. Gathering her things the next morning, she collected her stuff and left before anyone could see her. Before Sherlock could deduce. Before John could ask.
"Rosewood Cottage." Molly replied, smiling to herself before she looked over to Greg. "I've got the directions too." He was smiling.
"Mycroft, before you say anything, don't be such a dick. Showing emotion is courageous. You, my dear
"Yeah." John replied. "I've never told you, only your dad. But there was a room I went to before I found you. One with a deep hole filled with dirt, coffin near the bottom." John sighed. "You weren't in it. But...Mr Peterson led me to believe that your were. And indeed when I dug it up...yeah." He said a lump in his throat. Atlas continued to watch him intently. "There was a dead body, not yours..."
"I'm just tired." Atlas replied. "I'm as good as I can be for waking up next to a dead body." Atlas chuckled looking at her father. He looked at her skeptically before putting the kettle on. "I'm assuming Greg will be around today."
"I'm sorry I did that to you." He said into her hair, before looking at John. "I'm sorry that I left the needle out. I'm sorry I did that. I'm sorry I didn't think about you."
"No." John said, Sherlock making another sound. "Of course I didn't. I have you." Sherlock rolled onto his back, John shifting to allow for it. "Was that what you were worrying about all day?"
"Of course I'm upset." Sherlock hissed at Mycroft. "But I don't suppose you'd understand that. You've never cared about anyone."
IT was around 11:50am when the group arrived at Timothy and Wanda's beating Mycroft, Mrs Hudson and the dog. Sherlock smirked upon seeing that they were indeed first and when his laughing became rather hysterical everyone made it their cue to depart the car.
Now she could see the body and it wasn't as bad as she initially thought it was going to be, yet she squeezed John's hand tighter.
"What do you think?" Sherlock asked, handing it over to Atlas who looked at it before realising there was something she had meant to say to him.
"Right," John said, getting to his feet and putting his hand out for Sherlock. But the younger man didn't move, just stood. Feet firmly planted on the ground. "Sherlock, she's distressed, come on," John whispered nodding as he took his hand and broke his gaze with Atlas.
AS the afternoon arrived so did Mycroft, looking very sullen to say the least. Sherlock had mentioned once in the month prior that Mycroft may seem mentally strong but he's not as strong as he thinks that he is. Slowly he approached the bed, Rosie sleeping peacefully with John, Mrs Hudson sitting in a chair on the other side of the bed and Sherlock looking out a window. It was now that Mycroft approached the bed, each step taking more time than the last.
Five toasties later and three cups of coffee later - Atlas was not allowed coffee because they knew how crazy it would make her.
"About them being together. It's not exactly a match made in heaven." Jo replied looking over somewhat bitterly as Sherlock and Rosie squatted down looking at bugs and Atlas was trying to chicken leg John.
"Oh Ida." Mycroft said again, tucking a loose strand of hair, neatly behind her ear. She retched again and this time, this time she threw up some food particles and there was red. Red in her sick and she felt chills fight their way through his body.
"That sounds like him." Timothy laughed, before Rosie insisted that she show him Billy the skull in more detail. Mrs Hudson sighed as she poured out some cups of tea before handing one to each party - except Wanda who put up her hand.
"Those are seizures." John sighed. They had just said that it was something Atlas might do from time to time but they were becoming more frequent. She had an appointment booked at his surgery in the next week or so, so they should hopefully move her onto some new medication.
"Who's this?" Ruth asked stretching out a finger to the green dinosaur that Sherlock was sewing, and tapping his head.
ATLAS and Rosie had already seen to putting their stockings by the feet of their beds. Rosie was awake and she knew she shouldn't be. Slowly she creeped out of her bed and nudged Atlas who was sleeping on a mattress on the floor.
"Thank you," Sammy said as they went into her room and as soon as saw them she was kneeling on the bed her arms clamped around John's shoulders, her temple resting.
"Yes." Atlas said as she looked at Sherlock who leant forward placing his elbows on his knees. "How are you?"
"Travel arrangements are often a reluctant discussion that I have with my brother every year." Mycroft explained somewhat solemnly, as if he wished it to be another way.
"She wanted to. You changed her life and you saved my daughter. So stop saying thank you. Now, I have an important question to ask you." John grinned, Sammy's green eyes sparkling lightly. The young boy nodded once. "How do you feel about pizza? In particular, homemade pizza."
"No. I'm not sure that I 100% am, however, it's important to you." John smiled. "And I trust you a hell of a lot."
"Together. Let's go together." Sammy smiled before collecting his jacket, Atlas doing likewise as they left.
"Fine." John said. "But we have to find a way to help her make friends." Sherlock nodded in appreciation to what he had said before resting back against his shoulder. Sherlock sighed before wrapping an arm around John's torso and hugging him, creating another level of surprise. Of course they'd hugged before, but it was hardly ever Sherlock who initiated it. It was more common for the younger man to hug their children than his partner, that was the way it's always been.
It wasn't even 10 minutes after that man got done with him that his mouth was forced open and a pill was shoved down his throat.
He just nodded and his breath hitched, causing a burning feeling in his chest. Sherlock lifted his good wrist to his chest and held it there.
Sherlock knew he must lok horribe, the pain was enough to assure him of that but despite John's words, the omega inside him found it hard to stop panicking at the thought his pup could have been harmed tonight.
She walked up to him with a smirk and flicked his sensitive cock. Sherlock sucked in a breath and winced, breathing heavily.
Sherlock stopped shaking and crying, his hitched breathing being the only sounds he was still making. John worked the soap all around his body, careful not to irritate any of Sherlock's wounds. The things is: it's not going to help. Both men know this. Even the strongest scent-concealer won't be able to help rid the smell.
It's a well known fact that when an Alpha bites another Alpha, a poison gets injected into their system. This poison causes temporary paralysis and, in extreme cases, death. Sex between the two is agony for both parties, usually causing a slow and painful death. Sherlock has no doubt that that's exactly what they have in store.
"Look at the mirror!" The man commanded. "I said look!" He jerked Sherlock's head again when the detective disobeyed him until his watery eyes finally opened and landed on his own face in the dirty mirror. His already pale face had a sickly sallowness, colored only by blossoming bruises, and was contorted with pain that he couldn't remember having ever seen on his own face before. His normally piercing blue eyes were bloodshot with frustration and wet from the tears that threatened to spill over his lashes if he didn't focus on reining them in.
Sherlock blocked out the rest of what John was saying, he didn't need to be told what he already knew. That he should see a psychiatrist or a therapist, go to the hospital, probably even all three.
The alpha peaked his head into the bedroom. "Sherlock, you haven't eaten in ages. It's not healthy for you or the pup."
"I....don't know" Sherlock admitted with another sob, hand covering his stomach as a gut wrenching thought tore through him, destroying him more even than what they'd done. "What if....God John I don't...I can't..." He was starting to panic and he couldn't breathe, more tears, chest heaving, ears ringing so loudly as horrible waves of anxiety and panic washed over him.
Sherlock fought back the tears that threatened to fall. Oh, how he wants to tell John everything. Tell him all about the rape, the fear he has that he may be carrying another man's pup, the phone call...but he can't. He can't because of the cameras. The cameras that are supposedly watching them. The cameras that he hadn't been able to find.
A male voice, the first man to rape him, spoke up, "Or your little Johnny is gonna get it. And nothing in your little Omega power will be able to stop us from killing him."
“Good.” He left her go and she rubbed her throat. “I’ll ring you when I need you.” With that, he left.
You could practically hear her smile, "Good. Now, I expect you to play along with our game, you hear me?"
Seconds felt like minutes and minutes felt like hours for the alpha male. He spent a good part of the night watching over his mate, comforting him whenever he awoke in a panic. John could tell that this would be hard on both of them.
The sudden sharp burn of a fingertip intruded inside his dry hole. A strong alpha body held him and the finger pushed deeper, burning as it went, his passage far too dry. His breath hissed as he was violated and the man laughed behind him with a malicious tone, "You'll like it if you just relax. We still have a long way to go."
"Sherlock. Look at me." John forced himself to pay close attention to his omega, no matter how much it pained him to see Sherlock in so much pain. Especially with such a strong smell radiating off of him.
"Anytime you disobey us, I will press this button." She got close to his face and smirked, "That wasn't even the highest setting."
“Good, good.” John held his omega closer to him, feeling an overwhelming need to protect him. He closed his eyes and listened to the heartbeat of his pup and mate, but frowned when he heard a third heartbeat.
The man pressed a rather violent thrust into the detective causing him to moan in discomfort. Unfortunately, this only pleased the man, "Oh, you want it! You pretty little whore!"
"Oh," he sighed quietly upon seeing the detective's thin frame dry heaving into the toilet, his pale skin somehow seeming almost translucent in the dim light as he grasped onto the side of the bowl.
Sherlock nodded silently, in defeat. He was in so much pain but what he needed right now was to curl up in his alphas arms. To know that everything was ok, and that he was safe now because john would never let anyone hurt him. He got to his feet, swaying slightly and taking john's hand, tears slowly falling.
John holds Sherlock securely and speaks softly, "Shhh...just think Sherlock. Do you remember anything about them? And remember, I won't let them get you again. You're safe with me." John breathes in Sherlock's scent and smells a slight hint of his own omega. One untouched by the other alphas.
John carefully wiped Sherlock's tears away, "I'm not mad at you. But I need to know that you're okay. I wish you would've told me, but we can't change that." He offers a hand, "Come with me to the bedroom, it's much more comfortable there." He spoke in a soft and kind, yet slightly commanding tone.
With a few moment's hesitation, the doctor turned, and headed into the sitting room. Sherlock watched as John left and moved to the sink, bracing himself with his shaky hands as he bowed his head, brow furrowing in discomfort. Quirking his lips as he tried to ignore a new wave of nausea, Sherlock looked up, assessing himself in the mirror. He frowned slightly upon seeing how pale he truly seemed, how hollow his cheeks appeared.
"Oh come on, Sherly." She turned the power onto the lowest setting and pre cum began dripping from his cock, "Oh, you like that huh? We're gonna have fun then."
"Is it alright if I start cleaning your wounds?" John thought for a second, "And get you some painkillers?"
Sherlock sucked in a small, nervous breath when he saw John. He knew what alpha instincts did to people, and he wanted to be in his arms so terribly right now, but the smell of so many other alpha's on his mate could easily drive him crazy, and he'd want to mark Sherlock as his own. And Sherlock just didn't think he could take that right now. "John" He breathed, his nervous, terrified eyes are watching John, waiting.
"God..." John had to look away, gripping the bed sheet tightly. Of all the things they had done to Sherlock, this had to be the worst. It sickens him to think about it. He looked back at it with tears in his eyes and ran his fingertips over the bond bite, "I...I should've been there..."
Sherlock let out a small breath, both releived and hating this. "i didn't want to tell you this way" He said quietly, tears starting to fall again. "I was going to take you out to dinner...buy you a presen I...I wanted it to be perfect."
Sherlock is pregnant with not only his pup, but also the pup of whoever did this to him. Twins, each with different parents.
Alrighty, guys. Sorry this took me so long to update and it's only with a short chapter. School has gotten in the way and I am hoping on updating more frequently now that benchmarks are coming to a close. Please, just hang in there a little longer
He nodded, looking back up into the detective's eyes, "This is going to hurt, love." He kissed his head and started wiping down his wounds with several different creams and medicines. Every so often, John heard Sherlock wince and suck in a breath. He left the bite mark untouched, it's too soon to try and get rid of it. He'd risk the lives of both Sherlock and the pup and that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. So, he went to work on setting his wrist and icing the bruises on the man's body.
He carefully helps the omega to the bed and gets comfortable with him in his arms, "Please, tell me who did this..."
It's been about a week since Sherlock had returned home and his broken wrist has finally begun to heal. John's in the bedroom getting some well deserved rest after staying up for his mate these past few nights. The detective is sitting on his chair and staring at the wall, subconsciously holding his stomach. He hasn't eaten in a few days, but he also hasn't had the motivation to fix that.  His mind is dull, he hasn't really been able to use it. I mean, why should he? It wasn't useful when he needed it most so what's the point?
"Well, I don't. Just leave me alone." John left the room, sad and upset. And Sherlock felt bad. He wished that he could run up to him and hug him and tell him all about it. It might be out of character for him, but that's really all that he needs. All that he wants. He knew where John was going, that's really what hurt him the most.
"I'm fine. Thank you. I'll uhh... Be out in a moment." John stared at his omega, eyeing him with a skeptical gaze.
"I...I don't know" Sherlock whimpered, burying his face in John's neck and curling up as tight as he could, breathing deeply in the scent of John. "It...it was so dark....I couldn't see them...."
Without warning the man gripped Sherlock's curls and jerked his head up, causing a sharp yelp to rip out of his throat.
"I...i tried to stop them John" He said quietly, voice hoarse and pained from the night. "I'm sorry...I'm so sorry" he whispered, curling himself up in his armchiar, not caring how much it hurt him. He'd betrayed his alpha, he'd let someone else do this to him, how could John even stand to look at him? He could sure smell the distress and pain, and overhwelming smell of the other alphas. It was making Sherlock feel sick.
Roughly 30 minutes passed before he was turned onto his back and held down by straps. A naked woman, definitely alpha, made her way to the helpless man, "Sherly, it's nice to finally meet you."
"N-no...it's not coming off..." his eyes are red and puffy, "The smell...i smell like them...it won't come off..." He broke down crying and scrubbed harder at his skin, causing it to bleed.
