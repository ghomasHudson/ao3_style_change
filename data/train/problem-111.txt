Sherlock stood up a bit taller and held his chin a tad higher, as if he was about to recite a prepared speech. “We must infiltrate the club known as Cities in Dust. I am familiar with the owner and several of the patrons. The victims were all patrons of the goth clubs in the Soho district, and while both men and women appear as victims, many of the men were homosexuals. Most resembled me in stature and appearance. In order to draw out the killers, John, I will be bait and you will be my ‘secret’ lover. It's too late and too difficult to establish a backstory that we're an 'out' couple, but we'll have an easier time explaining why we are there together if we have some sort of relationship. Clubs such as these are a place where people are able to express themselves without fear of public retribution. My public persona as a police consultant, and your frequent outbursts that you are ‘not gay’ will add believability to our ‘closeted’ relationship."
“John-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Under blue moon I saw you
“One day, Dru, I’ll do just that. Just for you. But we’re not going to kill him tonight, so let’s GO.” He tugged at the woman’s arm. “Until next time, gents,” he called over his shoulder as they pushed their way through the crowd.
“As far as I can tell…” He trailed off, pausing long enough that John thought maybe he’d vanished into his mind palace. But when it looked like Lestrade was about to give up waiting for his revelation, Sherlock said thoughtfully, “There is no mundane explanation for anything we’ve seen here tonight.”
“Of course I do, you prat. How can you honestly ask me that after all we’ve been through? Don’t I follow you blindly- into all sorts of questionable situations? And sometimes even dressed like a perverted cowboy?”
“Spread your legs, John,” Sherlock said, using the whip to press John’s leg outward.
Sherlock sighed. “I received a package earlier. It was a doll fashioned to look like you, John. It bore the same marks on its neck as all of the victims. It was a warning- a summons. I considered leaving you out of this, but eventually determined that we were more likely to survive this together.”
Strength and beauty destined to decay
“Not people, John. Just you. But I will ask you, this once, would you like me to leave?” There was such confidence in his voice. Sherlock knew John was not going to tell him to stop. And damn it, he really wasn’t. “Good. Turn over. I can make you enjoy this, John. But you’ll have to cooperate.”
“As if you could.”
“Of course,” She turned her attention fully to John and he swore he could feel her mentally undressing him both physically and psychologically. “Oh, and aren’t you just delicious. I can see why he keeps you. You know, Sherlock, I have a couples’ special for my… other services. I wonder if your John would enjoy spicing things up a touch?” She ran a long, pointed fingernail down John’s blushing cheek.
“Please, sir, may I have another?”
When they arrived at 221B, Sherlock sighed and squeezed John’s hand before pulling out his wallet and calmly paying the fare. As soon as they entered the apartment, Sherlock went into the bathroom. John heard him turn on the shower and debated briefly whether to go check on him, but decided that if he’d wanted company then he would have given some indication. Instead, he went into the kitchen and put on the kettle, thinking tea would help. When it was ready he brought the two mugs into the living room, but found Sherlock already draped dramatically over the sofa, eyes far away and hands steepled in front of his face. John sighed and set the mug down next to Sherlock’s head in the slim chance that he would wake and want it before it went cold. Figuring that there was no sense in wasting his own cuppa, he sat in his chair and watched Sherlock thoughtfully, wondering what was going through that enigmatic mind right now and regretting that they weren’t enjoying the post-case activities he’d so been looking forward to. Eventually, though, all cups of tea end. John didn’t even bother putting his empty mug in the kitchen before climbing heavily up the stairs to his cold and empty bed.
“Yes, you are, Dru. We can come back for them another time.”
Sure enough, the thought hadn’t even crossed John’s mind. Sherlock wasn’t finished trying to invoke John’s jealousy, though. He lowered his eyelids seductively and in his most velvet voice said, “Also many of them seem to be obsessed with the- quote- ‘absolute edibility of my ass’.  I must admit, I couldn’t have asked for better fake-vampire bait had I written it myself.” Sherlock paused, then smirked. “Frankly, John, I’m disappointed in you. You’ve got a wide readership. You could have been lauding the merits of my backside for months.”
John’s resolve faltered once they entered the first room. He had truly thought he was ready- he had, in fact, been to a drag bar or two. But this was unlike any place he’d ever seen. It was enormous, and completely packed with men in various states of dress and undress. Some were in full drag and other, incredibly youthful looking men were only dressed in gold bathing thongs. John eventually registered that the latter were waiters handing out trays of colorful shots to whomever was willing to put a tenner in their pants. A performer was on stage doing a bawdy rendition of It’s Raining Men, and this number seemed to be a full participation event. Yet even amid the shouting, singing, and writhing men around them, their entrance created a stir. He wasn’t sure if it was because of their fame in the papers, or because of Sherlock’s past here, but they were definitely noticed. A few people were practically salivating at Sherlock’s arse as he walked by, and John bit down his feelings of jealousy as he noticed Sherlock nodding a bit too familiarly back at a few of them. Men surrounded John too, and they were grabbing at his dog tags, belt, and anything else they could reasonably lay their hands on, trying to draw him into the fray. He’d never been the recipient of such unabashed groping by strangers, and through the haze of his indignation and shame he couldn’t help but wonder if this is how women felt all of the time. He found himself wishing desperately that they had never left 221B, their armchairs by the quietly crackling fireplace, and his cozy and conservative jumpers. He was trying to figure out how the character he was supposed to be playing would respond to being treated like a piece of meat- should he act like this was natural, fine even?- when Sherlock once again came to the rescue. Of course he had noticed John’s discomfort- likely when John had unconsciously released his waist and stood staring like a terrified hare surrounded by foxen- and he took swift charge of the situation. Sherlock took John’s hand and began pulling him toward another door in the back of the room with determination. He leaned close to John to be heard over the din, and John felt his warm breath brush over his neck as Sherlock told him, “You don’t have to pretend to be altogether comfortable with this, John. Remember, you’re not supposed to have much exposure in this environment, and it is definitely not something that everyone would be comfortable with. For most people, entrance to this club is automatically considered consent, but it probably shouldn’t be. We’re headed to the other room where it will be much more sedate.” He pulled John closer and began to glare at anyone who came near them, for all appearances looking the jealous lover. For once John found himself grateful instead of resentful for Sherlock’s sharp intuition as to his state of mind, and of their assumed relationship, and they fought their way through the rest of the club to the door beyond.
“I mean it. If we’re going to do this thing, no more secrets. No more running off into danger alone. It’s both of us together, or not at all.”
John regarded the picture. Why was he so angry? The picture was lovely. The photographer had caught them in an intimate moment. The were looking at each other like it was- like it was real. And no one had the right to be part of that, to be a voyeur to their intimacy. Especially since it wasn’t real yet. John didn’t even have it for himself and here everyone else got to be involved.
“Yeah, I saw that guy. Real broody, disappeared quick too. I didn’t get a good look at him from where I was standing. I’m sure you deduced his entire life story, though, yeah?”
Eventually Sherlock pulled back, still holding John’s face reverently but out of reach of his kisses. Maintaining heated eye contact, he curled his fingers and ran his nails back along John’s temples, carding through his short hair until long fingers were wrapped around the nape of John’s neck. Sherlock arched up, stretching his long torso as tall as he could while remaining planted in John’s lap, pulling John’s head to his abdomen when he reached his full height. John breathed deeply, drowning in scent and sensation, rubbing his cheek against the downy hair that he found peeking out of the unfastened trousers. Unable to help himself, John took the zipper in his teeth and pulled it down, finally getting to appreciate a part of Sherlock’s anatomy that had been haunting him day and night. He ran his hands up Sherlock’s hips and pulled the obstructing fabric down as far as he could manage with Sherlock still straddling his lap. He ran his nose up the side of Sherlock’s cock, memorizing the heady perfume and reveling in the sensation of Sherlock’s pulse beating through the dorsal vein, noting that it sped up considerably when he reached out with his tongue and licked.
He does not expect that when the picture loads he will see blood. He is not expecting the image to contain a smooth expanse of skin, marred by a long, open wound from the bottom of the girl’s right shoulder blade to her left hip. Red is welling out across the paleness of her spine, which is hunched over, a collar of chain wrapped around her neck, no doubt pulling her down.  The gash itself is clean, precise, and John has seen enough in his time by Sherlock’s side to know that this is a knife wound. He knows, from his time as a doctor, that it is deep, and that it will hurt.
“You not sleeping in bed?”
“The number plate,” replied Mycroft, “it’s the same. It goes up the street and then comes back within five minutes.”
Something in the flat shifts.
Mycroft’s face was illuminated from below with a silver-blue light, highlighting the blue in his eyes that was so similar to his siblings. He hesitated a moment, before turning the screen towards the others, displaying the postcode in the screen.
All the best my lovelies.
They stand in the porch of the compressed house, squinting through the rippled glass at the hallway beyond. Lestrade stood in front of the light wooden door, turning the key against the resistance of the lock. As the hinges creak open, light crowds in through the frame, illuminating the scattered possessions that clutter the narrow hallway. Sherlock surges forward like a greyhound released from the gates to poke around amongst the shoes that are tucked into shelves in the wall under the stairs. John waits for him to spot something, but instead the detective whirls in his coat and tramples up the stairs.
“Right, so where do we go from here?” Asked Lestrade, exasperated.
John turned to face him, gesturing for him to continue.
He knows what’s about to happen. He fucking
“I don’t see anything,” muttered John; it was an ordinary taxi.
The twisted and tortured wood of the violin screamed a tuneful melody, echoing the internal noise that reverberated inside Sherlock’s skull, deafeningly silent. As the bow lifted from the nerves of the instrument with one, final screech of symphony, tormented eyes opened, determinedly dry. Dust motes fled as he spun, blue silk dressing gown swirling around, in an impromptu cape, like the ones he used to have as a child.
A turn of his head revealed that it was Mycroft that had done so, remaining crouched beside him with fear evident in his eyes. Now able to move more freely, he reached up to tangle his fingers into John’s jumper, grounding himself as he struggled to look around himself.
He hadn’t spoken much either, ignoring John almost continuously. Nevertheless, he sought out his presence, trailing after him whenever he moved into another room. John had learned not to initiate conversation, lest he shy away.
Sherlock just nods gratefully, expecting John t leave, now that his doctorly duty is complete. Instead,  he hesitates.
“It’s Sherlock,” says the voice over the telephone.
That’s all it takes.
He closes his eyes, and lets the pain of the morning crush him, just for a little while. His phone buzzes, and he knows, he
She means do they want assistance, but of course Sherlock simply responds with an impatient demand for coffee, which then leads to both John and Lestrade shrugging and admitting it wasn’t a bad thought, leaving the tiny brunette to ferry back their beverages, whilst they turned back to the tall man and the body.
Laying it down on the bed, Sherlock shrugged of the robe of his dressing down, letting it pool like water at his feet, liquid silk. Reaching down to grasp the hem of his t-shirt, soft through years of use and wash, he pulled it over his head in one, fluid motion. He stood there, bare from the waist up and let his eyes close briefly.
By the time he had done so, returning to brush his teeth downstairs, Sherlock had once again settled in his chair, resting his cheek on the plaid material. John watched him for a moment, before padding over to him, waiting for him to turn before addressing him.
It’s not what John wants to hear. He wants answers, but he nods anyway and lets the man download the file.
The bed creaked as John pulled himself up, protesting his movements. Sliding his feet into a pair of well worn slippers, he padded downstairs, not bothering to avoid the step that squealed, because it was only him that heard it.
Once downstairs, John got Lestrade’s attention before turning to face Sherlock, whose hands began moving with practised ease.
Mycroft looks older than Sherlock remembers him looking. He can't quite put his finger on in what it is, but suddenly Mycroft looks ancient.
Lestrade conceded the point with a tilt of his head. “So you think he was killed by a prostitute? Can I just point out that she doesn’t leave.”
“Shall we?” John gestured to the door.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, before moving around the bed and doing the same to the other side. John howled. It was nice to hear that laughter. It was a sound that Sherlock had sorely missed since he’d been living alone. It lightened the dingy room considerably.
There was a sound further down the corridor, towards Sherlock’s room, and John heaved himself up in order to check on him. When he rounded the corner however, it appeared to have been Sherlock himself that had woken John. He was now hovering half in, half out of his bedroom, looking as if he had intended to emerge, but had been caught at unawares, and was now unsure of what to do.
Sherlock fast forwarded the tape, eyes flicking over the pixelated screen, until the same blue Honda drove past again, the driver clearly the woman from the passenger seat, although now she was wearing a coat. A man’s coat, no less. However, true enough, less than fifteen minutes later, the car returned, with woman still in it, and a convenience store bag on the seat.
“What for?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes; there was a careful composure in Mycroft’s words and posture, something that would usually be substituted for frustration.
“I got a text,” he grits out, “a picture, of someone, a girl, I think, with this – this cut up her back. Looked like someone had y’know, just slashed at her with a knife.”
Not this – Oh.
John rolls him over. On his back, from under his right shoulder blade to his left hip is a scar. Once a deep wound.
Over a week after his last encounter with Sherlock, John is standing in the kitchen, watching his tea brew. His phone vibrates and he hates how his hand moves to his pocket to free it. He hate that he presses play and he hates that he stands there and watches.
With that he storms past the yellow police tape, not stopping to hear Lestrade calling out after him.
“Do we have a number plate for the car?”
Next chapter will hopefully be up by next weekend, if not sooner!
“This okay?”
“As you wish.”
“John.” Sherlock nodded at the floor.
John loosely cradled the hand without the IV, as the blonde nurse changed the dressing on Sherlock's chest, wiping the dried blood away with antiseptic wipes. He let his fingers weave their way between Sherlock's, tethering himself to the bedside.
“Yeah.”
Lestrade stands uncertainly between them, gaze flickering back and forth over them. A tense moment passed, a stalemate during which neither moved, until a throat was cleared somewhere in the vicinity of the body.
The London streetlights shine through the curtains, playing in shadows on the ceiling. The sodium glow reminds Sherlock of flames and he sighs restlessly, air brushing his chapped lips in a rush. The clock read 1:03am, a full five hours until sunrise. In the darkness, it is almost impossible to think of anything but the pain, which burns up his spine and sits heavy in the back of his skull. John suggested he lie on his side or front, rather than his back, but the front is too... reminiscent, whilst his side would prevent Sherlock from being able to quickly scan the room. Like this, he is hyperaware of every dust mote, every breath he takes stirring the air and creating terrifying nothings in the dingy room.
“It was unimportant.” He sounds almost bored, and suddenly John is livid, and beyond all rationality.
“They found the car.”
The others muttered in agreement. “Hang on, let me check that plate, I can trace it to the company, see if they know anything,” said Lestrade, already typing the numbers into the database.
His thumb moves to Sherlock’s lower lip, gently pulling it down in an expression of mock compassion, and Sherlock wants to bite down until his bones break in his mouth. But he doesn’t have the energy. The man steps forward, into what little space there was, positioning himself between Sherlock’s splayed legs. Helpless to move, Sherlock feels panic unfurl in his chest as knees brush against the delicate skin of his inner thighs through his thin pajamas. The man bends down, and presses his lips against Sherlock’s neck, sucking there until the blood rushes to the skin.
Lestrade refused to take the bait. “Alright. You head down, I’ll meet you there.”
It takes a second for the response to come. When it does, it cuts John deeper than any murder he’s seen before. One by one, he sees the days of friendship undo themselves. Sherlock’s mouth become a straight line, his eyes become flat and lifeless, and his posture changes from frustrated to formal.
It couldn’t be – It could. It really could.
Upon seeing John, his eyes widened and he took another gasping breath, immediately trying to push himself into a sitting position to face him. John clambered up, holding his hands out pleadingly.
“Look, I... I get it, if you don’t want me here, that fine, but please, just lie down,” John implored, “you’re only going to hurt yourself more.”
), and, if Sherlock had conceded on more than one occasion, no one outside these four walls was any the wiser.
John twitches awake, pushing himself up, off the side of the bed where he has been resting his head. The pattern of the rough hospital blanket is no doubt temporarily printed on his cheek as he looks up.
He looks so genuinely upset that Sherlock hates himself a little, because why didn't he just notice the floorboards? He's been doing it for years but he was to caught up in the terror of his vulnerability to even notice that someone was coming. And John, of all people, is blaming himself.
“John? What is it?”
The assembly murmured its indifference to Lestrade’s statement, and then spilt like water around an obstacle. John and Sherlock walked deeper into the darkness that welcomed them with a predatory smile.
It was a warehouse, by the looks of it. Disused and small, it could have once been privately owned and fallen into neglect. Now, the floor was slick with water, stemming from a crack that ran across the ceiling. It looked as if the rain had found its way through, collecting on the floor, but was unable to evaporate since the sun could not do the same. There was about fifteen metres of space in front of Sherlock, but it was impossible to work out how far behind him the next wall was without being able to hear the echoes.
His nails are leaving indents in his palms, John realises, as he watches his friend hail a cab, without so much as looking back. His breath in coming in gasps and he has to forcibly regain control of himself, fighting the urge to go after him and smack the look of dismissal right off his goddamn face.
“John what the hell are you doing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock shook his head minutely, accepting the water and taking several, small sips. Both men stood awkwardly for a second, before John moved to go upstairs, going to change into a pair of pajamas.
A hand brushed his, fingertips fluttering against his palm, trying to close themselves around his wrist. John flinched, looking down to see Sherlock gazing up at him, mercurial eyes tired. He let him hand be held for a moment, before frowning.
Outside seemed dazzlingly bright after the muted tones of the cramped house, and the three men let out unconscious sighs of relief as the claustrophobia lifted. Sherlock didn’t bother addressing any of the collected officers before he ducked under the tape once again, trusting that his companion would be by his side.
John woke up sluggishly, light dancing over his face. He was drape awkwardly on the sofa, one arm hanging off, and the other thrown backwards over the arm. The television played colours throughout the room, causing the shadows to flicker on the floor.
A love like blood
“Oh, you are a good little cock slut, aren’t you?” Sherlock fucked John’s mouth with the riding crop while he talked. “I should have deduced sooner how much you wanted me to take you into my control- all the evidence was there. You’ve been staring at me for months. You enjoy it when I order you around. I see how you struggle, pretending that you’re put out. But what you really struggle with is how much you desire to completely submit.” Sherlock pulled the crop out  and wiped the saliva onto John’s cheek, already wet with sweat and tears of frustration. “Well, John. Here you are. Mine. I can see how badly you’d like to come. But you need to make it to twenty, John, or else I’ll have to start over. And it won’t be as nice if you’ve already ejaculated. I’m going to hit you again, now, and you won’t come.” Three lashes again.
“Indeed.” Sherlock scanned the room. “We should dance. Although we’re doing a fair job of attracting attention as we are, we’ll be more exposed if we’re on the dance floor, and I want to be able to have the advantage of as many pairs of eyes on us as possible.”
John’s face was flushed, and his jeans were tight again from just listening to Sherlock talk about sex. He mentally added Sherlock’s voice to his list of kinks. “You’re trying to kill me, aren’t you?”
“Well, I guess that’s my cue too,” John shrugged and followed him out, assuming Molly and Lestrade were accustomed by now to Sherlock’s poor manners. He caught up to Sherlock about halfway down the hall and grabbed his sleeve. “Hey-”
John burst out laughing. He’d never heard Sherlock stuck on one word before. Now he knew Sherlock was distracted. Also, he was developing a theory that Sherlock had been hiding a deeply sensual nature. For instance, if John were to, say, use Sherlock’s own methods of deduction, he might notice that those leather trousers looked worn and fit extremely well. One might argue that Sherlock had worn them before. Perhaps a lot. Oh, he was going to have fun testing this new hypothesis.
“Right, yeah- Eli seems to be Drusilla’s victim, so now it’ll be Spike’s turn.”
A little too quickly, Lestrade reappeared. “That’s interesting. Only one?”
John roused himself, knowing that Sherlock was opening his heart to him now and cherishing the intimacy. And something had been weighing on his mind since last night. He wasn’t completely convinced that the vamps were real, but it was obvious that Sherlock did, and that was almost enough for him to believe too.
“Oh.”
“JOHN, I REQUIRE-” Abruptly, Sherlock ceased his petulant tantrum and stared at John. “Oh. You find me attractive in this outfit. Good, it will help you to be more convincing in your role as my secret lover. Now please hurry up and work through your crisis of identity and help me with this lacing.”
“Shit.”
“Indeed. So tell me, John, what makes you so angry?”
“It is two individuals working together but trying to satisfy each other’s interests. Probably a long-time couple.”
“No, John. Do not finish that thought. I refuse to allow you to sacrifice your decency. Your humanity. I would kill us both before I allowed you to turn into one of them. And since I can’t let you become a monster, and I can’t live an eternity without you, we shall just have to kill the vampires and live out our mundane, human lives solving crimes and having as much sex as possible until we are unable to do so any longer. Then we will die, hopefully in each other’s arms, and be buried somewhere to rot away. Now please stop fretting. I find myself unusually tired, for some reason, and you know how much you pressure me to sleep.” Sherlock smiled gently, pulling John into a tight embrace. John did not fall asleep quickly. There was too much to worry about. In a few short hours, they would have to leave this haven and face a threat that he wasn't even certain they could beat, even if Sherlock was sincerely uninterested in joining them. But his mind eventually stilled and he drifted off, lulled by the steady rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest and the sound of his living, beating heart.
So cruelly you kissed me
Hold the secret close
“I’ve been busy.”
“John,” he gasped.
“Oh, he means what he always means. It’s fine, I’m tired of watching you two flirt. And anyway we should really get this operation started. I’ll catch you two inside. Be safe.”
John sighed resignedly. “Not necessary. What’s the case?”
“Mmm,” John had relocated his efforts, and was busy teasing his way down Sherlock’s pectoral muscle, leaving a trail of reddening marks in his wake.
“Bollocks,” Spike spat as he glared at the brooding man in the corner who was silently watching them. “Dru, we’ve got to go now.”
“Care to share with the dummy?”
Crashing hard into the secret wind…
“You mean aside from the fact that they’re pretending to be vampires and bleeding people dry?”
wham! bam! i made you wait long enough for a little smutty smut, sorry it wasn’t real! but what is real anyway? lol
“Yes, turn me,” Sherlock pleaded, interrupting John’s thoughts. “I’ve been waiting my whole life for this, for you.” John looked over and saw such sincerity in Sherlock’s face that even he believed that Sherlock was buying this whole ruse, and that he was yearning for an opportunity to become one of the undead. John wasn’t sure whether to laugh or to try to grab Sherlock and get out of here before something terrible happened. Before he could decide, though, Drusilla nodded her head once and smiled.
Up against your will
John prepared himself to leap into action, as it seemed things were really coming to a head now. There’s no way Drusilla would be able to resist Spike’s goading for much longer, given her earlier displays of impulsive and reactive behaviour. He tried to catch Sherlock’s eye to establish contact and let the detective know that he was ready to act, but Sherlock was still fixated on Drusilla, looking a bit too eager for John’s liking.
John lost the battle to keep his hands to himself. He unclenched his fists and began running his hands up Sherlock’s legs, slowly, mapping every tendon and muscle of the detective’s sinewy thighs as he contorted and writhed, somehow still dancing. Sherlock ground his hips down, encouraging John’s hands farther toward his hips, which John found he had absolutely no objection to. Groaning, he took John’s face in his hands, leaned down, and began feasting on the doctor’s mouth, drinking John’s kisses and moans as if they were ambrosia and he was dying of thirst. John thought that he could stay like this forever, being consumed by Sherlock until he ceased to be. Then he stopped thinking altogether.
Cuts you up
“John, case,” he said breathlessly.
"Yes, I’ve known him since he came into the scene. He was very naive- I felt it necessary to help him acclimate. It was obvious that he had nowhere else to go, so he needed a helping hand. It’s not a very safe world for the very young, especially when they look like he did. Most people are not predators but the few that are can be rather persistent.”
“Right, where he goes, I go,” John added, really not finding it much of a stretch to play the jealous lover.
“There’s something about them, Sherlock. Something off.”
All of a sudden, the tempo increased. Everyone dancing broke into a frenzy. John noticed that the dance looked almost choreographed. It seemed like there was a pattern to it all, and that everyone knew their place in it. Sherlock looked so right here, practically floating through the twirling bodies with a nearly preternatural grace.
“Damn right, Sherlock. How could you even think that I’d be okay with being left behind?”
“I’ve missed you terribly. A girl could think you were avoiding her.”
“Oh? And what, exactly, does she need to be talking to my boyfriend about?” John thought he could see Sherlock preening a bit at his terminology.
“Drusilla was right. You deserve immortality.”
“It probably wasn’t so nice for him, being who he looks like he was.” Molly sounded sincerely sad.
John took a few deep breaths. “You did tell me to act possessive,” he laughed, studying his handiwork.
once again, thank you for all your support! xo
“Yes!” Sherlock snapped into the receiver. He listened for a moment before yelling, “Lestrade, there’s another one.”
Lestrade looked at the paper, then at John’s face, and said, “I’m gonna use the loo, boys. Be right back.” No one noticed.
Sherlock scoffed, obviously sharing his observation. “Don’t tell me you’ve become superstitious, Irene.”
John glanced at Sherlock with an incredulous look on his face. “We’re going after them, yeah?”
“Quit trying to distract me. How exactly are we going to capture Spike and Drusilla?”
In starlit nights I saw you
Sherlock gave a longing look at the cigarette before tucking it behind his ear. “They’re here. Second floor. That’s a lounge area- dark, with a lot of nooks and alcoves. It’s too dangerous to confront them there. Let’s make them come to us, somewhere a bit more public. While I want them to feel as though they have control over the situation, I don’t want to actually give them the advantage. Let’s stop here at the first level and dance a while, John. They’ll hear of our arrival soon enough, if they haven’t already. But the longer we make them wait, the more time Lestrade will have to position his people.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fourteen,” John managed to utter around the leather shaft before closing his mouth around it.
“Prat,” he called affectionately over his shoulder as he turned toward the kitchen.
Sherlock continued moving upward, one stroke at a time, as John counted to ten. Once Sherlock reached John's lower back, he stopped lashing and gently ran the tip of the crop around John’s now striped arse, admiring his handiwork. Without warning, he snapped the whip down three times in rapid succession, directly on top of his first target. John gasped for breath, hovering in a euphoric haze somewhere between pain and pleasure.
“I washed the sheets for you, John.”
“You said you trusted me. Please, John. I can’t sit around waiting for them to act again, and if I’m certain of anything they will. Eli was a warning and a taunt. I can’t let any more of my associates get hurt.”
John hesitated, hating that he needed to ask the next question. “Do you want to accept her offer?”
“Ohhh. I see now. You think they’re going to target me.”
“Nineteen.” John was beyond desperate. He was panting. He was drenched in sweat. His dick throbbed beneath him. Every bit of his awareness was concentrated on the buzzing warmth of his battered haunches. He existed solely in a timeless fog of desire. And he waited… and waited. It seemed Sherlock was never going to give him what he needed. He was a desperate, writhing mess. Finally, he couldn’t stop himself from begging. “Please- please, sir.”
The next several hours were a veritable circus of the comings and goings of Scotland Yard’s crime scene investigators. It looked like the two killers had been holed up here for some time, and John imagined that they’d probably be really irritable now that their home had been discovered and dismantled into hundreds of tiny evidence bags. He glanced over at the pile of dolls nearest to him and shivered as he noticed details that he hadn’t before. He’d already noted that they all bore the signs of Drusilla’s rage. Some were missing their heads. Some had been gutted. Most of them were covered in blood. But what John found really eerie was that they all bore resemblance to the victims, though he hadn’t put that together until he saw a uniformed woman holding a dark-haired male doll wearing a trench coat.
The “lair” turned out to be an empty hotel, hidden deep inside several blocks of abandoned buildings. John was beginning to think that the Yard wouldn’t actually be able to find them, and that they might die here after all. But by the looks of things, though, at least they’d be going out in style. Abandoned or no, this was the poshest hotel John had ever been in. Only the piles of mutilated dolls, the telltale rust colored stains on the upholstery, and the faint coppery odor in the air gave any indication that this was the scene of violent murders and not just the passive crime of excessive wealth and luxury.
The tempo increased again. The crowd began circling the dark-haired woman, who had positioned herself in the center of the floor.  There was no trace of her previous demure persona. Instead, she was a siren, a succubus, commanding everyone’s attention with pure seduction and the aura of raw power. John watched as Sherlock deftly used the movements of his dance to observe those dancing around her like worshipers, breathing a sigh of relief that Sherlock hadn’t been sucked into the mass hysteria that seemed to be unfolding around him.
“Indeed, one day yet you might even become one of the great minds of history.” John glared and pantomimed that he was about to leave.
“Mmm, Spike. Little tiger kitten is clever. But he thinks his teeth are so big. They could be, though, right Spike? We can give him fangs and we can give him claws. Give him all his lives back. Make him a proper tiger. Do you think he deserves it, Spike?”
With this last statement, Sherlock’s face had become unreadable. But John was learning that the detective used emotional distance as armor and that his words belied a vulnerability that ran right through to his core. John stood up taller and looked directly into Sherlock’s warily guarded eyes.
“What would I need that for? Like I said, I’ve figured something out.”
“Hmmm, I don’t think so, love. Sherlock will be ever so fun when we turn him. The other one will be gloomy if we take away his humanity. Look at him, Spike. He loves it so much; wears it like armor. Sherlock, though. He’s already half-way here. And when he wakes up hungry and eats his boyfriend, oh now that will be something to see. My tiger will be the best pet a girl could hope for.” She looked at him approvingly. John felt like maybe they were trying to be insulting, but somehow instead felt a welling-up of pride that his humanity was so palpable that even- wait. He stopped as he realized he was actually entertaining the notion that these psychopaths were actually vampires.
“Oh, that’s cute, ain’t it Dru? He thinks he's so clever.”
“So maybe there are other people? Are you sure it’s a good idea to let them take us to where there might be an ambush lurking?”
“Yes, in general the Rude Boys aren’t big fans of the goths or the gays, and the punks don’t really like anyone, but here there’s a sort of unspoken truce. Conflict is kept to a minimum on club grounds, else you aren’t invited back. And everyone wants to keep their welcome at Kali.”
John awoke violently, still feeling the aftershocks of his orgasm. He wasn’t sure if he’d been actually vocalizing, but his sore throat led him to believe that he had. Sweating and feeling filthy in more ways than one, he grasped desperately at the last tendrils of his dream. He wanted to just go back and finish dream Sherlock off, and to have time to decompress from the most intense session of his life. The mind-shattering orgasm he’d just had left him feeling completely discombobulated. Even if it hadn’t been real, the emotions he was feeling as a result of what he just experienced definitely were.  As he calmed down and got his heart rate and breathing back into normal parameters he realized that there were raised voices coming from downstairs and prayed they hadn't heard him. He’d hoped for more time to process, but since they had company he decided despondently that he wasn’t going to get the time he needed to fully recover.  He listened for clues as to what he was going to walk into when he finally made it downstairs. The lack of real anger in Sherlock’s raised voice told John that it wasn’t Mycroft who was the recipient of his scorn. Probably Lestrade, then. Mustering the willpower to get up and go see what was happening, he groaned as he pulled the covers back, seeing the extent of the mess he’d made. A shower first, then.
(See the end of the chapter for
Irene traced one last caress down John’s cheek, then she turned back toward Sherlock. Her demeanor shifted abruptly into something much more businesslike.
It twists away
Sherlock didn't seem to notice John's awkwardness. He turned to face John, smiling a predatory smile as he retorted, "Save it for the club, dear.” Sherlock then winked and strode off to get his coat. John realized two things.: one, that Sherlock had (thankfully? unfortunately?) forgotten his threats about doing John's hair; and two, that whether or not Sherlock was sincere, he was in deep.
On a personal note, Kali is loosely based on Medusa, an all-ages, multi-story club in chicago that I was fortunate enough to get to experience a few times before it closed. At 16, I was probably much too young to be there- and have a couple of stories that might support that claim- but I was much too young for a lot of the things I would do in my life and I have no regrets at all. I doubt that any place will ever be like it again. The world has changed so significantly. The internet is wonderful and wild but it also means the death of the real underground- or maybe I’m just old and out of the loop. In 1997, a new version of Medusa opened up. I was long gone from chicago by then, so I don’t know how it compared, but anecdotal stories tell me that it wasn’t what it was. Nothing ever is. Anyway, this chapter is an homage to this place out of time, for all its wonder and flaws.
With John by his side, it's suddenly easy for Sherlock to let his eyes slide closed and his mind slip under. He's almost fully asleep when John's fingers start to comb his hair off his face.
Typical John; thinks rest is important, hates disturbing Sherlock on the few occasions he actually sleeps. He shakes his head and John lifts his hands, drops them, lifts them again.
It was cold by the time they reached the old warehouse. The night was bleaching the sky black, and the streetlights fought to keep the dark at bay. John shivered inside his coat as he watched several armed policemen size up the building.
whispers a tiny part of John, somewhere at the back of his head, reaching for any possibility of self-absolution. But this too only serves to show how he has failed Sherlock; how he tries to displace his anger.
!” he screams.
On Sherlock’s chest are four lines. One vertical, three horizontal.
Wordlessly, Sherlock shifts to the left, leaving enough space for John to sit next to his prone figure, propping himself up on the headboard. From where Sherlock is lying, it's not a flattering angle for John, but still, Sherlock feels a calm warmth spread over his chest, and he doubts the blanket is responsible. He looks up, and John is looking down at him.
“How?” Lestrade seemed incredulous, “they could be anywhere.”
John stands by as the detective crouches by the body of what had once been a dancer in the West End. It’s a cold March morning, and the frost still clings to the ground, giving it a silver sheen. It looks beautiful, John thinks absently, and the day is filled with potential. After the case, he and Sherlock will head over to Angelo’s for breakfast. John will have a full English and tea, and Sherlock will have his own tea, but won’t order breakfast. John will pretend not to notice as Sherlock steals his toast and a rasher of bacon, because really, Sherlock needs the calories more than he does. Once they’ve had breakfast, they’ll go home, and John will have a shower and update his blog, and Sherlock will alternate between playing violent symphonies on the violin and throwing things at the wall. It promises to be a good day.
John nodded absently as he listened, the intelligence behind his eyes flickering as he fought to match Sherlock’s deductions. “There’s a warehouse that stores frozen meat for the local butchers, I think? It’s only small but..”
“As much as the idea of acquiring whatever sordid blackmail you have on my brother appeals, I’ll spare you the humiliation of defeat.”
“Mmm, yes. Very good, John.” Sherlock lashed him again, this time just above the last mark.
It goes this way
“Obviously that cannot be true. I will get to the bottom of it, John. Hopefully before we arrive at their ‘lair’.”
“Mmm. Well, Irene Adler lives up to her image. She is tall, authoritative, and sharp. She emulates Siouxie Sioux’s look, if you know who that is. One of her trademark features is her Egyptian-like eyeliner. Irene claims Siouxie stole it from her. In ‘retribution’, Irene appropriated of one of the singer’s songs as the name for her nightclub. Personally, I believe their rivalry is a put-on for publicity, and it seems to work out well for them. Do try to not be intimidated by her, John. She is quite unlike the women you are accustomed to dealing with.”
“You’re making a lot of assumptions tonight about what I’m ‘accustomed to dealing with’, Sherlock.”
“Good, John. Very good.” Sherlock sounded sincerely pleased with him, and John realized that he wasn’t even embarrassed at how he preened at Sherlock’s praise. “Now, John. I’m going to need you to count for me. Can you do that?”
“The better term would be ‘puerile’.”
Sherlock didn’t bother to reply. Instead, he leaned in closer to John. “With so few patrons here, we’ll have to find a way to blend in, darling,” Sherlock rumbled into his ear, catching him off-guard again and sending a tremor straight to his cock. “We’d better go get settled in on the dance floor.”
John wasn’t sure how to start. “So, you knew him?”
By this point, John was nearly drowning in sensation and nearly forgot that he was supposed to answer. He felt Sherlock lift the crop, ready to strike.
“Exactly, love. We’re not going with him but we need to go, right now. We won’t have any more fun tonight.”
“In due time, John.”
When the man finally steps away, water runs down Sherlock’s face, dripping onto his chest and following the marred contours of his body. He’s panting now, he thinks, and his skin burns with each expansion of his chest. The man crouches in front of the chair, expression of mock innocence on his face, and speaks again. Sherlock closes his eyes and focuses on breathing.
But he was normally up by this time, and John was entitled to a hot shower; by the time they had got in last night he had been too tired to make the effort of showering. Perhaps he would just wake him up, John thought. He was much less likely to sulk all day if he woke him as opposed to the pipes waking him. Besides, it was approaching eleven o’clock, and he still had a mouldy pancreas to clear out of the fridge before John’s date tonight.
“ ’friad not. We thought girlfriend maybe?”
John yawned. “We good then?”
Out on the pavement, he raised a hand to hail a cab, sliding in as soon as one appeared and reciting the address Lestrade had given him. He was staring at the cabbie’s left shoulder, trying to work out who he was having an affair with, when his phone vibrated in his pocket, catching his attention.
Sherlock was staring daggers at him. If John hadn’t known it was impossible, he’d have sworn that Sherlock looked hurt. Before he could be sure of what he saw, Sherlock resumed his neutral face.
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.”
“What in the holy hell was that?” Lestrade shouted into the silence that filled the room after Drusilla and Spike’s vanishing act. “Sherlock? I know you’ve got to have some good story to tell here, mate. It’s drugs, right? It’s always drugs…”
“You do tonight, John. Just follow my lead. One of the nicer things about these clubs is that there is no wrong way to dance. You just listen to the music and move your body however it feels right.”
“Wait, what?” John couldn’t believe it. “You didn’t get anything? Too busy dancing with our ‘vampires’, then?” John tried very hard not to sound jealous. He wasn’t entirely successful.
Begrudgingly, Sherlock conceded, “I only had a moment to observe him.”
John sobered at the tone of the question. He sounded- worried? Hesitant? John wasn’t sure where this uncertainty was coming from, but it was totally out of character for the detective. He took Sherlock’s hand, saying solemnly, “I trust you more than I’ve ever trusted anyone in my life.”
“You’re not helping me focus on the case.”
It turned out that two days was as long as Sherlock’s patience could hold out. Late Wednesday morning, after hours of cursing at John for having the nerve to breathe in the same room as him, he erupted off of the couch and flew into his room. John heard him throwing things about for a few minutes before he stormed back out, thrusting a black paper bag at John. “We’re going out tonight. Here are appropriate clothes, “ he barked
John fell into a rhythm, sliding up and down with mounting intensity, rotating his hips at different angles with each pass to maximize sensation. Sherlock was keening, thrusting up to meet John each time. Just as John thought he’d reached the peak of corporeal pleasure, Sherlock reached out with still-slick hands and began stroking his cock in time with their increasingly erratic thrusts.
“The longer we wait, the more people will die. We will act tonight. I have three possible theories and one of them must be true. I’ve prepared for each potentiality. We will escape, unscathed.”
“Yes. We need your ‘superior deductive skills’, Mister Egomaniac. Happy?”
Spellbound
John looked up at Sherlock and decided that maybe he did, in fact, need to get his point across a bit more firmly. He began slowly tugging the chain, hand over hand, reeling the detective in close, until they were pressed close together. John reached up and pulled Sherlock’s mouth down onto his, kissing him deeply, possessively. Sherlock didn’t struggle, but neither did it seem like his mind was on their kiss. John pressed in tighter, opening his mouth wider and practically devouring Sherlock’s lips, sucking them into his insistent mouth one at a time, pushing in with his tongue provocatively.  When Sherlock began to whimper, and John had to give in to mundane necessities like breathing, he pulled back and pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s. “Promise that you’ll never leave me behind, Sherlock,” he murmured.
Spellbound
“So, Sherlock, what’s the plan then?”
'Til the fearless come and the act is done
“My impatient Spike, always in a hurry.”
“That’s why I need my soldier to protect me.” Sherlock smiled, a rare vulnerable smile that John knew was only ever for him,. Though John knew that Sherlock used it from time to time as a method of manipulation, it always worked.
“John. I need you to hear me. I will not accept their offer. In addition to concerns of the restrictions of nocturnal living and the ethics of murder, the truth of the matter is that I could not bear to watch you grow old and die, only to live forever missing you.”
“What if they’re really vampires?” Sherlock completed the question for him without a hint of laughter.
"Oh?" Sherlock raised his eyebrows, almost imperceptibly. “Excellent. A rash of multiple murders has occurred in Soho over the last two months. Each was elaborately staged to resemble the work of vampires. Many of the victims were a part of the gothic subculture. Others were drawn randomly from the public at large, it seems, which led the police to believe that these events were unrelated.  Until recently the police were happy to ignore the incidents which involved goths, or dismissed them as cultish mass suicides, because they assume the subculture is essentially comprised of rebel youth with death wishes and anathema to society."
“And if you run off again without backup I will take you off this case, Sherlock. I mean it.”
“Whatever the hell she wants to,” he leered at John. “But I bet she’d be glad to talk to you too, right love?” His face softened as he reached over and delicately took her hand. She stepped forward, eyes still boring into John’s. He wondered if she really thought she was hypnotizing him, or if she just thought they were really gullible. He decided he wouldn’t put money on either scenario.
“You’re a right prat, you know?”
“You’re not that person any more, Sherlock. And I don’t believe you ever were a monster. I think you were convinced of it by people who neither understood nor cared for you.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
John rubbed his hands on his thighs and sighed. “Okay, okay. I’d better go get the shopping done then, if we’re to be on a case for the next however long. And the washing up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John too overwhelmed to move. He must have hesitated too long, though, because Sherlock was studying his face with a look of uncertainty and vulnerability that nearly broke John’s heart. He desperately wanted to allay Sherlock’s fears by storming over and claiming what was his. But he waited to move, giving himself time to first show Sherlock what he was thinking, dropping all of his defenses and hiding nothing from Sherlock’s penetrating scrutiny. He let Sherlock see everything- everything that he needed, everything that he felt, everything that he was desperate- but afraid- to say and do. The moment drew on as they regarded each other silently, mutually recognizing that this thing that was about to happen- that needed to happen- was too important to be taken lightly. This was more than just casual sex. This was more than mutual physical attraction, gratification. This was Them.
“No, John. I no longer wish for living death.”
“Great, I’ll just use my adequate intelligence to just make the tea, shall I?” Sherlock ignored him.
“What do you need from us?” asked Lestrade.
“Yes, exsanguinated but not staged.”
“Did you- were you and he… never mind.”
“I’d have thought you’d have done by now?”
Here’s a link to read about it. I love primary source accounts of things, and this is a really great one-
“There is a BLOODY PICTURE OF US, SHERLOCK. From last night. DANCING.”
Spellbound
You have no choice
Sherlock was silent for a long time. John was beginning to get nervous. If he said yes, would John be able to let him go? Would this be all they had?
Drusilla looked at him with surprised interest. “Oh, you want to be my little disco dolly, don’t you? Hmmm,” she purred, looking him over thoughtfully. “You might even be more fun to turn than my tiger.” Before she’d even finished her thought, though, her attention faltered and her gaze returned to Sherlock. John thought he was relieved to be not worthy of her scrutiny, until he realized it wasn’t much better that she had Sherlock so firmly in her sights.
A love like blood
“I had backup. I had John.”
John knew Sherlock’s tells well enough to see that he’d managed once again to render Sherlock genuinely shocked. Deciding to have a little fun with this rare advantage, he pressed on. “Yeah, and not just from daytime telly either, before you jump to that conclusion. I’ve been to my fair share of gay bars.”
“Of course. But remember, staring at women’s breasts will not only likely be entirely unwelcome, it will potentially hurt our cover story, which if you’ll remember is that we are intimate and ‘exclusive’.”
John gave him a half-hearted glare. Of course he was supposed to have somehow known that now they were investigating other locations.
“Dru-“
“Oh Sherlock, I can’t wait to see what you look like when you have to admit that you’re wrong.” John couldn’t help but laugh at the idea, drawing Irene’s attention back to him. “You should consider the wager, darling.  I’m quite sure John would thank you for it.”
The sun’s rays were just becoming visible when Sherlock snapped out of his trance and announced that he would be taking John home now. John flirted with the idea of being annoyed at Sherlock’s bossiness, but decided that they probably should be getting home. They had a few things to talk about.
When all the doubts are crystal clear
“John, we must go to the morgue now. Be angry later.” Before John could respond that he wasn’t angry any more anyway, Sherlock was flying out of the kitchen. He grabbed his coat shouting at John and Lestrade to hurry up already. John smiled wistfully at his untouched tea. Before following Sherlock and Lestrade out of the door, he carefully folded the newspaper and tucked it into a safe place on the bookshelf. Despite his mixed feelings about the public exposure, he’d definitely be cutting that one out for his scrapbook.
I absolutely know that in our story, we’re two years early for Mr Peter Murphy’s Cuts You Up. Don’t care. I just love it too much to not have our boys dance to it.
“Okay, then. Let’s go get the bad guys.”
Sherlock affected the face he made when he wasn’t planning on answering, but then he surprised John. “Yes, one of the places. But this is also the club where I decided to get clean. In part, I owe Irene for that, actually. She and Lestrade ganged up on me after a particularly embarrassing incident here one night. Please don’t ask me for further details.”
“John-” Sherlock tried again to get his attention, but John was decidedly distracted, pressing Sherlock against the bar and nudging his own growing cock into Sherlock’s thigh. He was beginning to formulate a military-grade strategy for how they could probably find a moment to dip into the nearest bathroom, or even an alley, when Sherlock roared and pushed him away firmly.
John chuckled, “Damn straight. And it appears once again that I’m not the only one.”
The life is short
“Mm, look at him, Spike, he’s all bristly. He thinks he’s a lion. RAWR!” She bared and snapped her teeth at him. Despite the absurdity of it, John found himself a little terrified. “The other one, though, he’s a tiger. Mmm, sleek and cunning. Or maybe he’s a sphinx. So many answers, yet still so curious. Curiosity killed the kitty, though, again and again, and now he’s only got one more life left.”
Sherlock cocked his head. “What aren’t you telling me?”
The floor was hard under Sherlock’s cheek. The damp soaked through his clothes, chilling him through. He was exhausted. The continual pain and punishment had drained him of what little energy he had, and he retreated into his mind as metal met flesh, and hands skimmed his thighs.
Long fingers tapped out a repeating rhythm on dark slate worktops, hopping and flying over Petri dishes and discarded test tubes. Reaching for the kettle, Sherlock let his eyes flicker upwards, over the tiled wall, the small window, the patch of stain on the ceiling from the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide; a simple trick, but one that had been an empty fulfillment of his need to tear apart his own headspace.
“Never know, could have been a bra or two under all that crap upstairs,” he quipped.
Pressing the bag against the warming side of the mug, Sherlock pulled the sugar jar forward, out of alignment with the rest of the containers. Picking up a teaspoon that had been left on the counter, he loaded it with granules, heaping them in the scoop and depositing them in the stained water. A layer of translucent crystals clung to the damp metal like old chewing gum on the underside of a bus seat. Sherlock watched the light tangle in the grains, diffraction and refraction, over and around. Dipping the utensil into the dark tea, he swirled it, scraping off the excess sugar with the flow of water. Releasing it suddenly, he watched it dance, twisting in aborted pirouettes.
was a very specific, very definite man, on which trust could be placed, and to whom secrets could be bared, and one whose absence tore a hole in the very skin of the one who remained.
“I like this tradition.”
“Hmm, what?”
John nodded. “Drug mules,” he said aloud, watching as Lestrade nodded. “They were kidnapped for doing something that they weren’t supposed to.”
“Yes, yes, okay.” He sighed again, in defeat. “Mummy… Well, she’s ill. Cancer. We don’t know how developed it is, or how treatable it’s going to be.”
And that's that!
Hurt. Miserable. Lonely. “Fine.”
Sherlock barely even noticed the movement of the chain until it had already lashed down, causing him to buck away frantically, shuffling further back into the chair, pulling on his already sore shoulders. Tears rushed to his eyes and the man laughed, chest heaving with it, and continues to kiss Sherlock’s skin with brutal lips of rusting iron.
“Obviously.”
So come back to me, Sherlock screamed, the words echoing inside his head. Come back where you belong.
He had found himself playing more and more frequently these days. The music was an anchor that could both tether him and set him adrift. The instrument came alive in his hands, giving him purpose and yet as he played, the notes seemed to bleed the loneliness Sherlock was feeling. It was a feeling Sherlock had grown accustomed to in the past few years. At first he had resented it, but he soon came to realize that it was the same feeling he had felt in the playground as a child, in the pubs at university and during the first year or so of working with the Yard as an adult. Only now it was amplified, because Sherlock could recognize it in himself. He knew how companionship felt. And he missed it. Not that he would ever admit it aloud. Then again, he didn’t have to. Anyone who knew him already knew.
John retches into the sink.
He bucked suddenly, almost dislodging the man on top of him, wriggling in a futile attempt to get away. In response, he felt fingers weave into his hair, forcing his head up briefly, before slamming it back down, leaving him disorientated and confused as the pain continued to cut through him, again and again, as tears leaked over him face from behind the blindfold.
He was shouting now, and he didn’t care. He raised the phone to illustrate his point, only to see that the message had been deleted. Sherlock, for his part merely shrugged.
And, in the end, he had been taken. He had died, he was no more. Like everyone else, he had ceased to exist, had become part of the billions of dead rather than the billions of living. And he made the transition with the same ease that the rest of the population. How extraordinarily ordinary after all.
Okay, I'm sorry there was such a delay, and I know that it's pretty short and not all that interesting, but I've currently got a heap of exams, and stuff going on with family.
When he next opens them, it is another figure that stands in front of him. This one is smaller, slightly less compact, but he looks young, and battling to prove himself. He holds a knife with the same familiarity that Sherlock wields a bow. Now, Sherlock thinks, he may be in trouble.
“What?” John screeches, shocked at the total lack of consideration displayed by his flatmate. It is not often these days that Sherlock will ignore something like this. Since John had moved back home, he had become softer, more accepting and certainly more sympathetic, even if he preferred not to show it outwardly. “How can you do that? How can you look at that and think it’s okay to just ignore it.”
“She left to get the bleach.”
The shadows grew long against the walls of the office, and subordinate after subordinate brought them cup after cup of coffee, but still nothing came to show them the way to Sherlock. At least, not until the day staff began to trickle out of the building.
It took three long strides for Sherlock to reach the steel covered fridge, and another, short step the side to allow the door to swing open, revealing a bare inside. Every item was neatly put in its place, the leftover pasta Mrs Hudson had left on Tuesday on the third shelf, the milk that had accompanied it in the door. It was this that he took, moving swiftly back to the worktop, and pouring the last of it into the cup.
“Not this time,” John smirks.
Sherlock feels the man’s groan through his mouth, and sobs, the sound swallowed with a grin. He crowds closer, and Sherlock feels his erection pressed against his chest. He starts moving then, even as he continues to kiss Sherlock, even as Sherlock continues to struggle, undulating against him, rubbing himself against his captive. The grunts of stale air into Sherlock’s mouth get more and more frequent as he moves, and Sherlock cries soundlessly.
John grinned at that. “Not my job, mate.”
The sound of the front door closing dragged Sherlock out of the thoughts that devoured him each time he closed his eyes. Footsteps on the stairs, followed by the tap of an umbrella every third step meant only one thing. Sherlock sighed as the door opened noiselessly.
He takes the case, not questioning how Mycroft managed to pick the one jumper the Sherlock had once complimented, and walks to the bathroom.
The third man is between his two predecessors in build. Muscular enough to be visible through a shirt, should he deign to wear one, but slight enough to be agile, should he have to be. His head is shaved, leaving dark stubble covering his scalp, and tattoos are inked onto the side of his face. Abstract patterns along the left, and a tear under the right eye. There are piercings too, in his eyebrows and his lip; little studs of metal that reflect the light like a disorientating illusion. As he raises his hands, Sherlock notices a series of five dots on the base of his right thumb.
No. “Yes, of course.”
Sherlock laughed, stretching languidly. “It’s hardly my fault your balance is poor.”
Sherlock doesn't sleep much at night these days. The sheets are too heavy and too light at the same time. They whisper and they press against his skin, holding him to the mattress, and Sherlock can't bring himself to close his eyes, to cut off his most reliable sense. He knows, logically, that John is only just outside his door, is sat on the sofa, mindlessly watching some god awful television show with the subtitles on, because he knows sometimes Sherlock will watch even when he pretends he isn't, and its just too much fucking effort to turn them on and off every time. In all honesty, this should be enough, Sherlock thinks. It's late, John is here, and Mycroft texted earlier to say that all three men involved have been 'dealt with'. Sherlock prefers not to linger on what that might entail. He is as safe as he has ever been. John helped him to fix a metal grate over his window this afternoon, so he know that there's one less entry point to worry about. Sat in the living room, John is currently between him and the other two. The probability of attack is low. But in Sherlock's gut there is a gnawing, uncomfortable feeling, stemming from the knowledge that, despite his virtues, John is only human, and sooner or later he will fall asleep. Should he retreat to his room, Sherlock will be left totally alone. So he lies there, awake, and waits for the morning to come.
“There.”
It was times like this that he needed the steadfast reassurance that John could provide. The comfort of adrenaline, the peace in a narrowly missing bullet, the sanctuary in the blood welling from a cut. Nothing replaced the feeling of cold concrete kissing the soles of his feet as he ran, dodging pedestrians, jumping fences. But it was all void without John. He wouldn’t have mattered before, if Sherlock hadn’t let himself grow so attached. So sentimental.
This time the angle is different. It’s been taken from the front this time, and John realises that his initial assumption had been wrong. This is not the body of a woman. The muscles that are tightly wound beneath the skin are that of a man, and his chest is flat. Though his hair reaches past his shoulders, his head is pulled pack, and John cannot garner anything that might indicate his identity. A mark is etched into his skin. Four lines, one vertical, the others horizontal and bisecting the other at the same angle. The one in the middle is shorter than the others, but looks the deepest. John takes a deep breath and phone Lestrade.
At Sherlock's raised eyebrows he hastily adds,
Back at the flat, John types up the case absently, listening as Sherlock bangs the doors of the cupboards in the bathroom.  Footsteps patter down the hallway as Sherlock reappears to say goodnight, before he disappears into his room for the night. John yawns and follows Sherlock example, trudging up the stairs wearily. He falls asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow.
Please heed tags. This is potentially very triggering.
“Please,” John begs, “please, Sherlock, you’re bleeding out.”
The man, whoever he may be, is lying naked on a thin mattress. It’s dirty and crusted with drying blood. John can see the month old, original wound on his back, along with others, infected and oozing. As he watches, he notices that hands are holding him down, pinning his limbs. He waits for the crack of bone, or the gleam of a knife, but it does not come. Instead, another bare body enters the frame, face carefully pixilated, and positions himself behind the man on the mattress.
“You alright?”
This time, when he pulls out his mobile, it is a video. John’s stomach twists as he imagines what he will see upon opening it. The screen goes momentarily black as it starts, and John can see his reflection, and feel cold mercurial eyes lingering on him. It’s a short clip, blessedly, but John winces.
John glanced down at the device in his hand. It’s a picture message, from an unknown number that is hidden. Turning his back to the crime scene to give himself the illusion of privacy, he slides his thumb across the screen to view the message. The picture doesn’t load at first, so he presses it absently, wondering if some poor girl has accidently send nudes to the wrong guy (if so, he will delete them immediately, he tells himself), or if someone is deliberately sending him pictures of something, as a practical joke or whatnot.
Aside from being stretched out on the bed in a pool of his own blood, the man had clearly been mutilated post mortem. Mutilated may have been the wrong word; if anything it was surgical, clear and careful. This was no heat of the moment decision. Whoever came in here did so with the intention to do exactly this.
“Delete that.”
He raised his hands in mock surrender. “Well alright, but just being here, it’s... nice.”
John doesn’t miss the way Sherlock flinches, and it surprises a small part of himself, just under his sternum, that he doesn’t care right now.
The ache that radiated through his chest was horribly familiar. It washed through him like scalding water, leaving invisible, yet no less painful scars. But nothing else would ever hurt like this. Because what can you take from a broken man?
Returning to the relative safety of his bedroom, Sherlock slipped out of his pajama trousers and tugged a pair of pants from the drawer. Drawing on a plain white shirt and tucking it into the dark suit trousers as he pulled them on was routine, something he’d been doing for years, a failsafe. As he reached into the wardrobe for the jacket however, his phone buzzed from the kitchen. Leaving the door open, Sherlock back into the kitchen, scooping up the phone with his right hand, trailing the left along the battered surface as he tapped the four digit passcode onto the screen.
“Please, John. Harder.”
Drusilla started giggling, though her eyes remained cold and piercing, boring into Sherlock with a greedy stare that made John’s blood run cold. She twirled around with delight several times, then took Sherlock and John each by the hand, leading them toward the exit. John still wasn’t entirely sure what exactly he was supposed to be doing in this charade but decided that he should just keep following Sherlock, who was effortlessly maintaining his glamoured affectation and following Drusilla like a love-struck puppy. John was looking forward to the fact that half of the Yard was waiting outside to back them up, but as soon as they got out of the door Drusilla yanked them into an alley and began pulling them almost inhumanly quickly down the narrow twists and turns of the London streets. John quickly lost hope that anyone would be able to keep up, or even find them. John could barely keep up with her himself, and only could because her grip on them was so strong that he had no choice but to strain his legs as far as he could while desperately trying not to trip and fall. John was almost certain that he was going to asphyxiate by the time she pulled them into one last alley, deep in a desolate area of town that he was unfamiliar with, when she finally stopped and released them, tossing them with an impressive amount of force against a wall. She spun around and hissed at them.
He moved to crouch down in front of Sherlock, running his hand through his hair  in the motion. His face was drawn, and he looked years older than he had last week. Looking at him now, closer, and with more intensity than was normally permitted, Sherlock could see the peeling skin on John’s lips, chapped from the worried pulling of his teeth and his inability to resist the urge to pull at the torn skin. Part of him wanted to reach out, to physically reassure him, provide evidence that he was here, under John's care, no longer under the instruction of the overbearing doctors in hospital, but here, under his own, more trusted care. And yet, Sherlock no longer knew where the boundary was. John had seen him at his most vulnerable, but now, even in the safety of 221, he was distant, and each move seemed planned. At the hospital he had understood: John would not want to be seen to be touching him, the medical staff in care of Sherlock's care had been very adamant about separating John's hand from its rest on his arm. He had been too far gone on morphine to understand quite what had happened, only suddenly John hadn't been offering the warmth he had previously.
“Alright?”
The walls of this room were painted black, as was the ceiling, and had clearly been done by an amateur. Drops of paint had run down the wall, giving it an odd, rippled looking texture, and the skirting board was stained with it. On top of the black was white shapes, clearly designed to replicate a pentagram, but the lines wobbled inside the circle, extended outside it and crossed over at all the wrong points. Glancing around the room, John saw a plethora of chokers and wicked looking earrings.
Never before has he felt more alone.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but closed it again, colour rising to his face. He stood, pivoting on his feet unstably, as if to return to his room, before John’s hand on his arm stopped him.
When the hands came, they were rough. They pulled his trousers off his legs, taking hold of the hems and tugging before Sherlock had even had a chance to fight back. Now naked, he writhed, desperately trying to displace the hands that parted his legs.
On this particular day, as the horsehair strings of the bow danced with the taut lines of the violin, Sherlock stood in the window, framed by light, casting a darkness over anything stood behind him. As is the way with Sherlock Holmes. Blocking the light. It’s what he does best. As the notes leaped and glided over and around him, Sherlock let his eyes drift shut. The light seeped through his thin eyelids, leaving greyness behind them.
An evidence bag appeared by Sherlock’s shoulder. He ignored in it favour of standing and surveying the room once more, prompting a sigh from the other detective in the room, who began depositing bottles in the bag wearily.
There was weight on his shoulders that pinned him to the concrete, and knees between his own that prevented them from closing. The skin that touched his was bare, and, Sherlock realized belatedly as a crotch was pressed against his buttock, hard. It took him just a moment too long to react as the pain filled his senses.
A simple message from John :
It was small, but menacing. The brickwork was exposed, the windows boarded up. As they went around the back, John saw the taxi cab, innocently hidden behind the back wall, invisible from the street. The sound of the Thames trickling by masked their footsteps as they crunched on the gravel, swinging open the rusty metal gate as they went.
The group came together in front of a pair of rotting wooden doors, giving John the time to pull his Sig from where it rested in the waistband of his jeans. There was a small murmur as Lestrade counted down from three. As one, they swarmed through the door.
Despite himself, Sherlock felt a soft sigh of relief whisper past his lips. Thinking was so much easier when John was around. Christ, breathing was easier when John was around. He sent a simple reply to confirm, before carefully steering his thoughts away from the possibilities opened up by a case like this. Sherlock let his head rest on the back of the seat, watching the brickwork as the cab weaved through the streets en route to his destination.
“Alright, show me.”
John didn’t reply, only stroked his thumb across his hand in an attempt to reassure him.
He gently nudged him back down to the bed, supporting his back in an attempt to take some of the strain off Sherlock’s muscles. When he was resituated on his bed, John gingerly straightened the cannula  under his nose and stood, with the intent to leave, and possibly alert Sherlock’s family to his awakening.
He felt the moment that he began to wake, stretching against his body, a faint noise of content escaping him. Sherlock stiffened as he came to, his breath stuttering until John touched a hand to his shoulder.
“Question is; where was he killed?”
There is a man, speaking a language that John does not recognise. He is repeating something, over and over, and the other, the victim is sobbing, pleading it sounds like. Without warning, the first takes hold of the man’s leg, repeats his part once more and twists. The scream that follows is almost enough to drown out the grind and crunch as breaking bone twists under the skin.
“Breast cancer.”
A long cut ran from the underside of each collarbone to the groin, classic post-mortem incision which exposed the soft tissues underneath. In the chest cavity, the attacker had clearly used great force: the sternum had been cracked, a jagged line like two tectonic plates meeting had woven its way over the bone. This had allowed the heart and lungs to be removed with a gentle touch. The story was much the same further down the body. Each organ had been meticulously removed, without so much as disturbing the muscular walls of the abdominals (with the exception of the initial incision). Every vital organ that could possibly be profited from had been taken. Black market trade then.
He grinned. “I know.”
He hesitates again. The look of frustration on Sherlock's face drives him to sign.
Sherlock nodded, already stepping away from his only companion to venture along the dark stretch, the beam of his torch sweeping across the shelving. Walk past each box, check its contents, assess as merely off cuts from a wide assortment of animals, move on. An indeterminable amount of time. Around him, Sherlock could hear the whispers of other pairs of hands repeating his motions over and over, hundreds of times over hundreds of boxes, to find the prize: human remains.
Lestrade paused outside a nondescript pine door and nodded towards it. “In there. Fair warning – it’s gruesome.”
The man raises his arm again, but a large hand catches it on the down stroke. A few words pass between the two men, and the younger steps away dejectedly, still glaring at Sherlock as he moves behind the chair.
The image was grainy and discoloured from the weak streetlights, distorting colours into blurry smudges against dull backgrounds. The time on the bottom left corner read 23:47 as the tape started, the seconds slowly ticking past as cars flowed through the display. There were few pedestrians on the pavements, and shops were closed, steel shutters down.
With his usual method of communication tied behind his back, there was little that Sherlock could do, aside from glare at the man and blink stubbornly. Seemingly unaware that he was deaf, the man brought the piping back down with force. Sherlock winced as he felt his cheek split open, warmth flowing down his face and staining his bare chest with crimson.
“Any idea what?” Lestrade pressed.
“Oh, alright,” Sherlock rolled his eyes in the most dramatic fashion he could manage, “I eat frequently enough to sustain myself.”
John nodded, unable to reply whilst his hands were full of cocaine. “Lestrade?” he asked, trusting Sherlock to recognise the name without hearing it.
“Unlikely to pick up another client right outside the previous one’s house, but I suppose it’s a possibility.”
Sherlock turned to face him as fully as the confined space in the cab would allow, letting his eyes flit over John’s comforting frame, partly hidden by the bulk of knitwear that wrapped around him in a way that Sherlock envied. He revelled briefly in the blueness of John’s eye, the simplicity of his features that somehow culminated in a being that was, in all ways extraordinary. His hair was slightly longer too, growing out of its close military style. It suited him; took the years from his forehead.
Turning to face his brother, Sherlock lent on the edge of the table, the rim digging into his hipbone, leaving an indentation on the scant flesh there. He raised his eyebrows, waiting, unwilling to be the first to break the gossamer silence that cocooned the flat.
He felt rather than heard Mycroft sit behind him in John’s old chair, placing his black tea by Sherlock’s. He let his fingers wander for a few seconds longer, before moving to the desk, placing the violin in its padded black case. Something in the back of Sherlock’s mind chuckled darkly at the resemblance to a coffin, closing around his only comfort.
Less interesting, more foolish.  “Burnt out?”
John follows him out of habit, not needed, but appreciated nevertheless, to find Sherlock pulling all manner of things out of the medicine cabinet over the sink. He frowns when feminine hygiene products are tossed across the floor, landing at his feet, the open box spilling its contents. Painkillers and cough syrups were next, although the latter were placed down onto the rim of the bathtub. Sherlock froze suddenly, and John was about to reach for him when he spun on his heel, jerking backwards into the sink when he saw John standing motionless in the doorway.
“They took some of the drugs themselves,” John translated.
They all turned to watch the screen again. Sure enough, the black cab traveled past in one direction, only to return in the same direction a few fast-forwarded minutes later. John frowned.
The battered pages of the notebook remained open on the pages, waiting, like a trained dog told to stay. The crudely elegant scrawl of handwriting enclosed a simple sketch of the atoms in sodium thiosulfate, making it look almost like a work of effortless art.
John stepped into the kitchen, taking a glass from the cupboard and filling it with tap water. “You need anything else?”
The rage that paints across his adversary’s expression is almost worth the second agonising slash, from shoulder to armpit across the expanse of his chest, over the sensitive areole. Sherlock contorts into the pain, and chokes out a desperate sob.
The three men stood in Lestrade’s stuffy office, as late afternoon burned in the sky. Thanks to Mycroft, they had been able to get their hands on the tape from the CCTV camera closest to Baker Street, but it had been near futile. The footage was of the corner down from 221, meaning that there was nowhere in the shot that showed the black door, or the bedroom window of either occupants.
“Bloody drama queen,” John muttered, following.
When the doors slid open, it was to expose the length of corridor that lead to the mortuary. Sherlock walked it with the sense of a man greeting a dear friend, with Lestrade and John falling into step behind. The short hall was bright, the false light from the ceiling lights casting an off white glow to the plain walls and tiled floor; the three men the only dark spaces as they paced towards their destination.
“What?”
Concern growing, John flicked through his contacts and pressed dial. Although Sherlock would not be able to answer the phone, the vibrations would get his attention. This technique had been proven useful many times when Sherlock was so focused on a case or an experiment that a single buzz didn’t register.
, he says,
As it turns out, Sherlock had been right. They tracked the two girls’ bank transactions and, sure enough, an anonymous source fed several hundred pounds into each account at least once a month. More to the point, they had found the donor, linked him to several large drug rings and arrested him. He went down kicking and screaming that he would get his revenge, and Sherlock shared a smile with John, after John translated the threat with mock seriousness, before raising a hand to summon a cab.
“Uh, yeah, somewhere.” Lestrade fumbled with the keyboard for a moment. “Here. While I remember, we also found the licence in there. George Borjo.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Woman in the passenger seat. Any leads on her?”
Despite his consciousness, when Sherlock moved away to search for more drugs in the room, John open the chest of drawers. He snorted. All black clothes with various satanic or anarchic symbols on. Except one flowery silk shirt that stuck out like a sore thumb; the crow among the doves.
Lestrade nodded, rewinding the footage. John hovered over his shoulder, tension stiff in his shoulders. It had been six hours since he had noticed Sherlock was missing, and a search of the flat had turned up nothing but a few potentially illegal experiments.
John turns to the man who peers over their shoulders. “Is there nothing else we can do?”
John knows he won’t make it until the ambulance arrives. Surely he must too.
Sherlock shook he head, already moving around the room. “There’s always something.”
He holds no weapon, for which Sherlock is warily thankful. Instead, his hands come up to frame Sherlock’s face almost tenderly. He holds him there for a second, before shifting slightly.
Curled in John’s chair, Sherlock watched the conversation unfolding before him. Mycroft was trembling, tiny little shocks that twitched his fingers against his trouser leg as he spoke, very visibly fighting to remain under control and he sat across from Sherlock, in the black leather chair. John, by contrast, was a sentinel; he was totally still, guarded but clearly agitated. His hand did not shake.
“Is it so hard to believe that she wants to spend time with her sons?”
He is sat in his chair, pointedly ignoring Sherlock’s presence at the desk. He has yet to replace his science equipment, or if he has, he has hidden them well. They’ve barely spoken in the past few weeks, and John hates it. He hate that he feels as if every message drives them apart. He hates that Sherlock refuses to have any part in the investigation, and he hates that the lump of betrayal that sit heavily on his chest grow with each day that passes without an exchange of words.
, John signs,
Checking each screw for blood was something Sherlock had learned a long time ago could prove vital, and this was no exception. It took less than a minute to find a hinge with blood caught in it. Digging out his pocket knife, Sherlock unfixed the component from the door, leaving it hanging at an odd angle. He turned to find John holding out a bag, already open. Slipping the rust coloured hinge into the clear plastic, he smiled. He’d missed this; having someone who knew what he needed, when he needed it.
But now Sherlock could see the hurt in John's eyes. The sadness in his brother's. And the constant wariness. As if he would break. helpless anger set heavily on his stomach, twisting his insides with guilt and rage and defeat.
Please take a look at these and check you're okay with them because it's only going to get worse from here on in.
John moved to stand behind him, looking down. “Um… It’s dirty?” He looked back up at Sherlock, unsure of what he was looking for.
Sighing Sherlock closed his eyes letting his toes press against the dark wood floorboards. He needed grounding. Something to hold him in place as events spun around him, wildly out of control. Control. Anything that can be controlled is good. There’s a certain safety in it, a protection from the impulsive. Whether it was preserving order in the flat, or commanding those around him, Sherlock’s need for control grew, screaming its uncertainty.
“You start from here, I’ll start from the other end?”
“It was him. This whole time. It was him.”
“I’d rather you were there.” It was said harshly, blurted out almost unintentionally. “I mean – it’s fine if – you wanted to... stay?”
John winced in sympathy as he heard the dull thud of Sherlock’s, back hitting the porcelain. He raised his hand to his chest.
“Where else?”
It takes a second for his mind to catch up with what he is seeing. When he does, his eyes slam shut of his own violation, attempting to block out the gruesome sight that is flashing across his irises. Blindly, he shouts for Sherlock, hearing him stride over to where John stands.
Sherlock sighed in mock defeat, stooping to collect a sample of the dirt surrounding the impression, before stepping into the kitchen, still able to hear John muttering to himself about ladies clothing and slobs.
A week passes, then another. There is no response from ‘the office’, and John continues to receive picture after picture of torture. As the third week anniversary of the first picture arrives, John’s phone beeps a message at him.
Not ten paces ahead of him, blood gathered in a sticky sweet pool, steaming in the cool temperatures of the warehouse. The body that lay on the hard floor was dark with blood, and it smeared upwards across his face from where it leaked out of the chasm of his windpipe. A valley was open between the two sides of his abdomen, split wide to expose the naked organs. His eyes were open, though they looked black in the lightlessness of the room. Lestrade and his team shouted to one other, but Sherlock heard them with deaf ears. Deductions flooded over him, and he blinked through them, seeing them through muddy water. Then, he did the only thing that made sense. He left.
He rolled his eyes.
Not dignifying this with a response, Sherlock strode back towards the door, trying to ignore the way the carpet crunched slightly under his heels, sending small puffs of dust into the surrounding area.
“John.”
Lestrade’s face pales. “Can I see?”
Jogging back down the stairs, he walked into the bathroom, turning the shower on. Might as well get showered and dressed while he waited for a response, he reasoned. He let the water warm up before stepping in, letting it drench him and rubbing shampoo into his hair.
John’s eyes crunched in sympathy, as he looked over his should to the clock on the microwave door.
Mycroft too, had withdrawn after that first week of hospital beds and starched linen, no longer a constant by Sherlock, but flitting back and forth, on the phone and uncomfortable wherever he stood. Despite himself, Sherlock craved the carelessness of touch. Not the deliberate, searching touches that haunted him, but a soft brush of a hand on his shoulder, a whisper of breath as they fought over the newspaper (
“About the stabbing? Or – the other stuff?” John winced inwardly at the implications of his words.
Sherlock is not home when John ascends the stairs, and for that small mercy, he is grateful. He has no desire to deal with a sociopathic flatmate at the present, and he needs tea. The kitchen however, is cluttered with science equipment. Beakers and test tubes and a Bunsen burner all fill the space that John needs. He sees red.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmm? Oh, yes, of course, I just – I was worried, I suppose.”
All the best.
As the nurse left, he let his eyes trace the paper-thin skin of his face. By the time John had reached him, he had lost nearly three pints of blood, and now it was clearly visible. The knife had narrowly missed both his heart and lungs, leaving him in shock and gasping, even as he bled out. Now, nearly 48 hours, and several transfusions later, he was stable, and the risk of cardiac arrest had dropped significantly. Still, John was loathe to leave him. He wouldn’t abandon him again, he told himself.
John spells. He doesn't know the sign for it. Neither does Sherlock, but it's not something he'll admit to anyone but John.
Valleys opened up on the skin of Sherlock’s chest as the warped metal met flesh again and again; rivers of red flowing freely, pooling in the crease of his lap, soaking through his thin pajama trousers until he sits in a congealing pile of his own blood. They continued like this, in their dispassionate dance for in indeterminate amount of time.
Watching the street below proved to be grounding. The world kept rotating on its axis, the news kept reporting the financial issues with the EU, and cyclists kept getting knocked off their bikes. Nothing would ever change, ultimately.
The thin steel glinted happily up at him as it rested benignly in his palm, the fingertips curled towards the wrist slightly as if to protect it. Sherlock sat slowly against the bath, its cold edge digging into the vertebrae of his spine. Letting his arm rest across folded knees, he etched more tally marks into the soft skin of his inner forearm. Safety ran down his fingers, leaving carmine trails behind. Furrows in the skin marked the heartbreak of the heartless.
Mycroft didn’t hesitate for long. “Sit,” he gestured to the chair opposite himself with an open palm. Sherlock faltered for only a second, before settling himself with strained nonchalance. The position reminded him of chastisement as a child, when he’d insulted one of the teachers or imbeciles in his class. It was clear that Mycroft was not deceived, but had the good grace to overlook it.
Sherlock shakes his head dismissively and pushes past John to slip into the bedroom that is opposite the bathroom. The walls are pink, and covered with posters that cling to every wall, and even the ceiling above the bed. Members of bands that John has never heard of stare down at him, making him feel exposed and uncomfortable. Sherlock is shuffling things around on the stained wood of the desk, pulling pieces of coloured paper and art supplies out from shelves that are hidden beneath the tabletop. He deposits boxes onto the darkened wood with loud thumps, unaware of the racket he’s making. John moves around him, grabbing a box that Sherlock shakes in his direction. He almost drops it again as soon as he opens it. Inside the innocent looking box, invisible amongst its peers, was a handful of tiny parcels. Each was no bigger than a large tablet, wrapped in cellophane. John didn’t have to open them to know what they were. Drugs of some description, smuggled across the world inside this girl’s body.
He felt Mycroft’s hand close around his own, and John gently massaging his shoulders, coaxing the blood to flow back into his arms. Something was draped over him, and the hands moved to turn him over. Sherlock easily recognised them as John’s as he cradled him against his chest, tucking his head against the crook of his neck as he stood.
John snorted at the remark. “Doesn’t look like she’s left much though.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes but what else do you see?”
But the hands that touched him next were gentle, tugging the blindfold from his eyes, and stroking his matted hair from his forehead. Sherlock opened his eyes slowly, blinking in the harsh light that spilled in from the open doors on the far end of the building. Looking up, he saw John’s face, contorted with worry and anger. The moment that John saw him register his presence, he twitched the corner of his mouth up in recognition, something that vaguely resembled a smile of reassurance. As he pushed his head into John’s palm, taking comfort in the small motion of his hands, someone cut the ties that bound his own hands behind his back.
The cause of death was clear. Bullet shot straight through the left eye socket. Precise. Possibly the perpetrator had experience. Sherlock took a second to identify the expression on the victim’s face. Not surprise – anger perhaps? Regardless, this was not the interesting part.
The walls were painted slate grey, making the room look dark, despite the large windows in the wall facing the road, which spilt light like liquid gold onto the floor. The corners of the room were gloomy with thick cobwebs, stuck to the wall like old blu-tack. Although no spiders perched among the greyness, the evidence of their existence was left behind in old carcasses of their previous skins.
“You’ll find the killer in the audience tonight. Ginger, navy blue suit.”
Light spills into the room all of a sudden, and Sherlock is temporarily blinded, his eyes struggling to adapt fast enough. He can feel his heart leaping in his chest as he bolts upright to face the figure in the doorway. The sudden surge of adrenaline numbs his body, leaving him on edge and ready to flee in the confines of his room. The figure is short, but wide enough that Sherlock can't immediately make it out as John until he's already standing by the edge of the bed, tense. John exclaims something, casting about for a place to put down the objects he's carrying, switching on the light as he does. He settles for placing them mostly on Sherlock's dresser before he turns back to Sherlock, raising his hands placatingly.
He left Sherlock’s on the table beside the chair, taking his own and settling across the room, on the sofa. Though he opened the newspaper over his lap, he remained focused on Sherlock. Despite having been out of hospital for almost a week now, there was little to no improvement. He ate infrequently, often claiming nausea, and the bruise-like shading under his eyes did not fade, no matter how early he went to bed.
Suddenly, all the weight was on top of him, crushing him against the floor. There was no movement for a long while, and it took several long seconds for him to detect tiny vibrations in the floor against which he lay. There was something wet running down the side of his neck, warm and tacky. Sherlock struggled for breath, the hair of his attacker filling his mouth and nose, even as his body compressed his lungs, making it difficult to get air.
Mycroft rose to his feet in one, coordinated movement, coming to crouch at the arm of Sherlock’s chair. “She’s not going to live forever Sherlock. Everything ends eventually.” It was the closest his voice got to soothing. The age gap had never seemed so poignant.
Sherlock waves his index finger in front of John's face;
Sherlock smirked. “Actually,
He's close, Sherlock supposes, and it's something John himself is all too familiar with. He knows that sometimes John will scream in his sleep, has seen him jump up from his lax position in his chair, coiled in terror. Clearly he debates lying just long enough that John latches onto the truth.
A long inhale through this nose and a nod. “Well, that’s probably for the best. Statistically speaking at least. It’s got the best funding and awareness campaigns.”
“You sure?”
, I think you’ll find she does, albeit not in the same car. See here,” he pointed, allowing both Lestrade and John to crowd him, “it’s clearly the same woman, but now she’s a passenger in a black BMW. Possibly an accomplice or getaway driver.”
The sound of the door closing roused him enough to turn and survey the room. Mycroft had put his cup in the sink before leaving, maintaining the order in the room.
In jeans and a hoodie, the man is hardly what John pictured when the superintendent had said ‘expert’, but then who is he to argue with experience?  He shrugs. “I’ll take the file, see what I can do back at the office.”
friend might not wake up. And it was likely his fault.
“You’re right. You’re not normal. You’re a bloody freak.” He snarls, letting the superficial hatred he feels flow into his words.
you eat?”
The morning tea sat by the deserted armchair, the steam dancing and twisting in the light above the fading red plaid  pattern of the chair. Light streamed in through the tall windows, drenching the room in the cold, clinical light of early December. The hollow sound of a melancholy violin soaked the walls, oozing heartbreak and sorrow. The dry wallpaper looked out into the room sadly, reminiscing of times long gone, when the room would be filled with sly glances and unspoken words. The bookshelves stood proudly in the corner; they at least were able to offer escape, even for a short while. The volumes themselves had been organised to the point of ritual. Every individual stood to attention, spine straight, each shelf colour-coded, with the darkest at the bottom; layers of soil in reverse.
When Lestrade calls him the following afternoon, he thinks that maybe they’ve found something, something that will stop this, stop the pictures, the hell. He hopes, however childishly that if this goes away, Sherlock will come back to him, as if he hasn’t hurt him worst of all.
Standing there in the kitchen, crumbs decorating the front of his oatmeal jumper, he felt oddly lonely. There were often moments when Sherlock’s inability to communicate in the same way as others frustrated John, but he made up for it with his presence and his character. Besides, it was the best he could do, and John always felt awful for even thinking it. But this, this was different. Sherlock took his phone everywhere, always had it in his hand – and how could he not? It was his method of talking to those who couldn’t read the complex motions of his hands.
