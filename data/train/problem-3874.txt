Castiel wakes up to Sam curled up against the feathers of his wing and Dean staring him down from behind the small child. It is strange, and his wings are feeling cramped, along with the rest of him, as Dean continues to stare and Sam lets out a small snore.
"Well that is a relief…" Dean sighs, "I'm sorry about this, though, you were very adamant about not doing that yesterday."
"Hey, what stick got lodged up your ass?" Dean asks from beside him and Castiel turns to stare at the man.
"Sammy! What are you up to, kiddo?" Dean asks and Castiel can hear the small child saying he has to go to bed. "Ohh, well goodnight, Sammy. We'll come get you tomorrow morning. Yes, I promise." His smile quickly drops after that when Sam says something Castiel doesn't catch. "Yeah, I'll give him the damn phone." He grumbles, shoving his cell phone against Castiel's chest.
Castiel shrinks in his seat and looks away from the young man gawking at him, "War and sex do not go hand in hand, Dean." He stares at his beer bottle, wishing it would actually affect him so he could feel at least marginally less awkward right now. "I wished to save people, not to partake in lust."
"Dean only keeps secrets you would not want or need to know." Castiel points out, "If he will not tell you, chances are neither of us need worry about such things."
"He's still in those teen years. His body is only that of someone in his very early twenties. Outside of the hardships of war, he is basically mentally the equivalent of a twenty year old."
Dean's thrusts lose their rhythm and become more erratic as the two grow closer to reaching their limit. Castiel tenses up, his fingers and toes digging into Dean as he reaches the edge, toppling over it when Dean leans forward and lightly bites his wing. Dean finishes soon after and the two take a shower together before collapsing onto the bed.
Dean scowls, "Of course I know that. I don't want him here forever, he's just another child I have to take care of."
"This is getting weird, we're just gonna go." He says, grabbing Benny's shoulder to turn him away from his stare down with Castiel. "Thanks for watching Sammy last night."
"Thank you so much, Castiel, and Gabriel, to a far lesser extent, for sending Castiel to us. I wish I could have realized I loved you sooner, that I would have stopped being so damn stubborn for five seconds to realize it at a time where we could have been together longer, because I am pretty damn sure you were in love with me too. It's alright, though, because in reality I probably would have just relied on you more if we had become an actual couple. Then I would have been completely lost when you left. So it's alright, I will still always have that last day."
"Oh great, more angels giving vague fucking answers to shit," Dean grumbles, heading to the kitchen. "Well, I have the pizza and wings, so everyone just come eat."
"I am indifferent to a person's gender." Castiel responds, confused as to why she would assume he would care more about men than women. All of god's children are important to him, after all.
Dean blushes a little and looks to Castiel questioningly. Wordlessly, Castiel simply gestures toward Sam. "Sam, what weird shit are you spouting now?"
"Blankets! Pillows!" Sam exclaims, dragging Castiel out of the room and through a hallway to a large closet, "Grab all of them!"
"Do not be stupid, Dean." Castiel scolds, "You're young, and to just give up because of one person you can never get back is foolish."
"I have no interest in dating," Castiel explains, "But Dean needs someone. He likes brunettes in their twenties, you seem to fit that."
Dean stares at him for a moment before shooting Kevin another dirty look, "Seriously? You've got the angel saying it, too?"
The food comes shortly after this and the three eat, Kevin showing Castiel how to 'properly eat a pizza', an act which apparently does not entail eating different pieces first. Castiel uses this for one slice, but quickly returns to eating it in the order he prefers; peperoni, cheese, sauce, bread. He ignores the looks Kevin gives him. By the time they are done eating, Sam is covered in sauce and cheese.
Dean stares at him for a moment, as if figuring something out, "…You say that as if you accidentally destroy things a lot."
Castiel looks at her in horror. She knows not to tell anyone, does that mean she is aware he is an angel just from that small amount Sam said? Teachers are far more intelligent than he had imagined.
It struck him that maybe this whole thing had been a mistake and that these were meant for some beautiful woman living in the building. All of the gifts made so much more sense—the coffee, the scotch, the lingerie, it was all for some tasteful lady. He almost wanted to laugh. All this time he’d been so confused, so concerned. Feeling relieved, he bent down to pick up the note that had fallen, hoping for some clue as to who the packages really belong to.
Standing in the hall he was reminded of what a perfect spot this was for a carrel. Behind the stacks, just out of the way of any other study spaces so no students congregated nearby. It was even in the boring section of the library, with nothing but dusty old manuscripts no one ever checked out or came by to pick through. Perfectly secluded, the best spot to study—or kill the guy you shared a wall with.
“Dean,” the sound of his name pulled his attention up and suddenly he was staring into warm blue eyes. “What’s the matter?” Cas spoke softly in a way that was hard to reconcile with what they were doing. It made him feel vulnerable.
“We’re going to make Michael believe he’s been terminated—to ‘fake his death’.” He said, using air quotes over the colloquialism.
Cas chuckled. “You can have one kiss, gorgeous. Since you were so good, did just what I said.” He leaned in, closing the small space between them to capture Dean’s lips in a kiss that was almost chaste. It was awkward because of the bars, neither one of them could move much, but it still felt perfect to Dean.
Instead of licking him again, Cas slid his thumb inside and used it to pull out some of the come, rubbing the slick around the outside of his rim. “Wanted to fuck you properly, baby. Wanted to give you what you needed.” He slid the finger in and out slowly, setting a rhythm that had Dean making desperate noises.
“I see.” Castiel’s voice was cool, detached but his heart pounded so hard that he was almost sure Michael could hear it. The dark, evil quiet of the house seeped into him, filling him with guilt. No, no, no, his mind chanted over and over. This was his fault; their deaths were on him. He felt sick.
“Alright,” Dean grabbed a flutter board and jumped in, the cool water making his nipples stand up—this man was going to be the death of him. “How ‘bout you do a lap for me, so I can see where you’re at?”
Castiel hummed, playing with their fingers—twining and touching and holding them together. “I sent you all those poems. Before we met, that is.”
“Somebody’s feeling bold.” Castiel murmured, digging his nails into a bruise and making the detective whimper with the pleasure-pain of it.
Steeling himself, he stood up straight, took a deep breath, then banged on the door. He waited, tense and trying to remind himself that Charlie was probably right:
If anything, Benny only looked more concerned. “Ben, I’m fine, really. We’ve all been here longer than we’d like. Cas—tiel is, uh, is in custody already so I doubt we’ll have anymore trouble tonight.”
“I require the use of your skills. I realize this is not an ideal time, considering your visibility, but it has become quite urgent and I would have no one other than you.”
He eventually pulled back, noticing that Castiel’s eyes were nearly black the pupils were so dilated. “I—I want to please you. Tell me how, Cas, direct me.” He said as desperately as possible, eyes wide and innocent as he leaned in to peck small needy kisses up the other man’s neck. A small strangled sound escaped Cas but that was it, the only indication that he was enjoying this.
But they weren’t going to get a happy ending. When all this was over, Castiel would leave and Dean would go back to his normal life—doing good, righteous acts. It wasn’t fair to drag him into the shadows, Dean deserved to shine in the light, to be admired and worshiped for his goodness. Castiel could never give him that and even this stolen time was selfish.
The sensations were too much, almost unbearably good after being so desperate all day. The way Cas’ fingers moved expertly up and down his shaft, the way the silk of the panty dragged along with his hand, his debauched reflection. He couldn’t take it. With a shout of Cas he came, filling the underwear with his come, groaning at the way the warm liquid covered his cock.
“Cas, I—I can’t.” He was crying now, the pressure building up in his body to the point where it actually hurt not to come.
It felt so much better now without the bars separating them, in the comfort of Dean’s home, his bed. The way Castiel’s hands ran reverently up and down the sides of his body, the heat of him, the taste. Dean was so lost in sensation he barely even registered that Cas was flipping him over, pushing him onto his stomach.
“Thank you,” he muttered, fumbling with the tie before she batted his hands away and did it up for him.
“No, I, I wanted to but I didn’t. I swear.” Dean stuttered out a second later, each nervous word more exciting than the last.
“I’m not in love with Dean. That’s not what this is, Balth.” He mumbled, eyes flicking back to the man sleeping peacefully in the backseat. The image made his heart swell inconveniently, like it was trying to prove the truth in Balthazar’s words.
He was gasping and choking on air as tears streamed down his face, tired body sagging against the floor. Cas swallowed every drop, then sat up on his haunches and deftly freed his own leaking cock from his pants. With one hand on Dean’s chest, he held himself up right while the other wrapped tightly around his dick. Through blurry eyes Dean watched Castiel jerk himself off quickly and efficiently, hand sliding up and down the thick length. It only took another minute or so before he was coming in hot wet ropes across Dean’s chest.
Things were even worse at the hospital. They waited for hours, not saying anything to each other, Dean putting as much physical distance between them as possible. The man wouldn’t even look him the eye. In the end, the whole thing was for nothing—he didn’t even have a concussion. “Sorry,” Castiel mumbled as they headed back to the car. They’d been in there so long it was getting pretty dark out. Dean didn’t even say anything, just grabbed his jacket out of the backseat and handed it to him. For a split second he thought about just giving it back, he didn’t exactly deserve this kind of kindness after running out on him last week.
It is not a big fall, and the car doesn't get hurt from it, but Dean would have been. At the sound of the ruckus, Bobby and Rufus run over from their spots to see Dean still lying on the creeper with his legs in the air, firmly held by Castiel.
"This boy here would like to go with you into a backroom." Dean explains, handing her some money, "Be gentle, the kid is a virgin."
"Oh my god, are you scared of trying food?" Dean asks, making Castiel tense up, "Holy shit I'm right."
"Well, Sam is playing so now is the time to sneak out." Dean pushes on Castiel's back and leads him to the door, the angel's gaze never leaving Benny's until he had no choice.
"He wished to help his brother. Both of you are selfless." Castiel says and Dean shakes his head no.
"Angels are allowed to have sex, Dean, carnal pleasure is enjoyed by all beings." Castiel explains, trying to hide his nervousness. Just because angels can doesn't mean he wants to. Sex seems messy and cumbersome.
"Yes, well, most people do not have angel taxis so we're walking." Dean huffs. Why was he going to miss this guy again?
"So you're still around." Castiel huffs, staring down Benny before going up to him and whispering. "I suppose I owe you a sort of apology."
Castiel stares at the small bed with turtles who seemingly perform martial arts on it, "I cannot fit on this." He says and looks down at Sam, "And human rules dictate that a strange man in a little child's room is cause for panic."
"SAM!" A tall brunette whom Castiel recognized to be the twenty-one year old Dean, screams. He pulls out a pocket knife and charges at the angel, ramming the knife into his chest.
"Dean's not mad at you, he's mad at Kevin for meeting you. Now Kevin will be talking about you to everyone." Sam mumbles, his face now buried in Castiel's shoulder. "Which means he will be teased a lot about living with another man. He's simply embarrassed. When Dean is embarrassed he gets mean towards the person embarrassing him."
"Angels will always watch over you, Dean." A beautiful blonde woman tells her baby boy in the privacy of their home. It is not as private as they would believe, however, the blue eyed angel looking down at them muses.
"That is not the manner of our relationship." Castiel replies before looking down at Dean, "You should be more careful, Dean."
"That is not-" Castiel begins before Dean takes a forkful of the pancake and holds up the food to the confused angel. "What…are you doing?"
Castiel turns to him, "I will help you through this, Dean, but I now know that will require a bit of toughness. From here on out, I promise I will not let you down."
They pick up Sam, who tells them about his day on the car ride home. Once inside Sam takes Castiel's hand and runs him to the living room so they can watch some children's show as Dean makes dinner. He should be watching Dean make dinner, but the man said to go with the boy, so watching the cartoon will be his priority today.
"Allow me to show you a few tricks, sir." She teases and Castiel, for once in all his years, curses his youthful appearance. Had his body looked more grown up he would no doubt be receiving far more respect right now, rather than being treated like an awkward little child.
The little boy pulls away from Castiel's wings and looks up at him sadly, "Can you wait until tomorrow? You can sleep in here," Sam smiles, pointing to his bed, "With me!"
Luckily in the past few weeks, Dean's anger has died down and they have moved on from the subject. Of course what Dean doesn't know is Castiel would gladly break a rule of heaven if he could make the man happy from it. Not just for his job, either. Which is the scary part. He would willingly break a rule if it would make Dean, or Sam, happy. Not to mention going back to heaven would be good.
"Do not use that name in vain, Dean." Castiel warns, "Angels are not supposed to interact with humans. We help from heaven. Being sent down here is a first that I did not want to do."
The smile Dean gives him actually reaches his eyes this time and makes Castiel unable to resist returning it. "Did you just make a joke, Castiel?" He asks and Castiel wants to say yes, that it was on purpose, but that would be a lie and he cannot lie to Dean.
"Aahhh, a history nerd. Well, you can stick around the garage today, Dean here will keep you out of trouble." Bobby says, looking to Dean, "Isn't that right?"
Dean raises a brow before his gaze follows Castiel's to the stairs where Sam and Gabriel are standing. "Oh god, why couldn't it have been a date?" He groans.
"Given up on talking to Castiel about whatever if going on, huh?" Dean closes the door behind himself and slides off his shoes, "Alright," He begins, going to sit on the recliner across from Gabriel in the living room. "Let's talk."
"Gabriel is on his way, I can feel him. I can't move from this spot though so they will have to come up here." Castiel mumbles as feathers begin to fall off of his wings.
"Oh shit!" Dean hisses. "Oh Cas, oh shit sun of a bitch what can I do?" He asks, his voice pained, "You're falling apart."
Castiel watches Dean lie back in his bed, muttering curses about chick flick moments, and for a moment he feels relief. Followed by immeasurable disgust in himself. He's actually relieved Dean needs him, and can't be happy. Does he want to stay that badly? Yes, he already knows he does. Logically, he should pull back from them and approach this all from a distance, but instead he sits down on the opposite side of the bed, lying back to his head meets with Dean's in the middle.
Castiel frowns, quickly leaving Sam and Gabriel to see Dean. "Um…Dean…I have something to tell you…we have a visitor…"
"Castiel lie down next to me!" Sam says excitedly and Castiel obeys, lying down beside him. "Can you take out your wings?" He asks, looking to Castiel with those brown eyes even he is finding a hard time saying no to. "I made sure it was big enough for them!"
"I happen to like him better this way!" The man huffs, crossing his arms, "He's slightly less of a dick like this."
Castiel smiles at him, "I'm glad you have realized this, although it took my personal failures to bring it about."
"Just who exactly is the awkward one?" Dean grumbles as he comes to stand on the other side of Sam. "At least I can be alone in a house without needing some nosy little high schooler to help me." He points out and Castiel goes to say something, "If you mention his advanced placement one more time I swear to god I am leaving you at Benny's as well."
Now that he thinks about it, Gabriel has had many human lovers, among other creatures. Has he ever fallen for one? No, Gabriel has never fallen in love. He understands it, but nothing more than that, just as most angels do. Perhaps angels do not have the capacity to fall in love. Angels are meant to love all humans equally, so perhaps sex with them is not a matter of that human being special, but it is a matter of giving them what they want.
"This is very well made." Castiel admits, looking around the large fort, "You would have been a worthy ally in a battle."
"You have been doing well on your own, I see." Castiel smiles at Dean, "I suppose I should give you some credit."
"Gabriel…" Castiel warns, giving his brother a dark look. "Dean will be home soon, you should make yourself scarce for that."
"Dean…I am uncomfortable with this…" Castiel leans over towards the man next to him and whispers, "Den of iniquity."
Dean rises from his seat and punches Castiel. "What would you know?" He yells before an older blonde woman, who Castiel has learned is Ellen in their hours here, comes and kicks them out. Standing outside, Dean paces in the alley they were forced into. "You have ruined everything! Sammy is my brother! Why does he turn to you when upset now?"
"I'll be back later, help Castiel out when he needs it." He says before leaning forward and awkwardly hugging the boy in Castiel's arms. "W-well…on that note…don't burn down my house, make sure he stays in one piece, and the take-out menus are on the fridge."
Castiel thinks for a moment and then remembers illustrations humans have made of his brothers with strange circles of light over their head, "Halos do not exist. When archangels come down a holy light surrounds them momentarily. Warrior angels tend to make electricity go haywire, but there is now a spell to keep that from happening so we do not wreck your homes."
"That was not my concern. I was wondering…how to make a man happy." He mumbles, causing her to freeze in front of him.
"Well then at least I would know we'd be meeting up after I die." He jokes as he rounds the corner into the kitchen.
Castiel takes a sip of his beer and winces. He never liked alcohol and it would never make sense to him as to why people get so attached to it. Deciding against it he chugs the alcohol as fast as possible. "This is awful."
Dean deflates, he wasn't going to stay as he is now if Castiel continued to come back. He was going to show Castiel each month just how much he could accomplish on his own. No alcohol, no angrily lashing out at people, no self-blaming and none of the other stuff that had been messing his life up. No more sleeping around, either. In fact, Dean doesn't really want anyone. The only person he could imagine spending his life with is Castiel; raising Sam and cooking dinner and even just curling up on the couch toge-
The break doesn't last long as Dean's fingers go back to his wings, gently running them through his feathers and Castiel loses it. Within the blink of an eye he has brought them to Dean's bedroom. He pulls Dean back into another kiss almost immediately, allowing the man to inch them onto the bed.
"You should spend the day together!" Sam offers, making Castiel light up. It's perfect, really. Today is Dean's day off and getting to spend time with him would help Castiel figure out better ways to make him happy.
"Pretty angels in the sky," The small voice calls, catching Castiel's attention, "Please help my big brother. He is so scared and overwhelmed." Sam explains in his prayer, earning Castiel's respect. This child is smart. Insanely smart for a three year old. "Please find a way to help him." As Castiel watches the little boy pray over his little bed, his tiny hands laced together and his eyes tightly shut, a hand comes and lands on the angel's shoulder.
It feels good, but it's odd, and rather than losing himself to the pleasure Castiel is watching everything. He's staring at Dean and presumably freaking him out because all of a sudden he reaches out and begins digging his fingers into Castiel's wings, using that as leverage for his thrusts.
"My mind is very much still intact." Castiel assures him as he takes the plate and goes to sit next to Sam.
Castiel follows Dean into a bar down the road from the strip club they had just been in. He looks around confused, because while he doesn't know much about human customs, he is fairly certain places like this do not usually open until night. Once inside Dean ushers him to the counter to sit on an uncomfortable stool next to him.
Castiel watches Rufus go to one of the cars before turning to Dean, "What does he mean 'switching things up'?"
"Yeah, um," Dean's eyes look everywhere but Castiel's face until they find something in his wings, "Your wings look a little weird." He observes before going behind Castiel. "Here, I'll straighten them out…or something?"
Castiel nods, following as Dean stands up. "I am sorry, Dean." The angel mumbles, catching Dean's attention.
"Going to a family friend's bar." Dean corrects, heading out of the alley. "Come on, Cas, I'm taking you to meet Ellen and Jo."
Being on earth is fun, but angels are not meant to stay here for long periods of time. The air is polluted, which has given Castiel a cough recently, and all of the gravity, not to mention hiding of his wings, is putting a toll on his body. He'll never let the brothers know this, though. Earth was specifically not made for angels, and Castiel was experiencing this fact first hand.
Gabriel laughs, "That is exactly our job now. We have nothing to fight anymore, Castiel, you are simply an angel here to guide and help the humans. It is our father's wish."
He can't help but contemplate the idea of falling in love with a human himself. Certainly Castiel loves humans. There is no doubt in that. They live for such a short time, yet in that lifetime they live far more than angels do in their however many millennia in heaven. Lives filled with such joy and pain, triumphs and losses. They know true sorrow and true joy, whereas angels tend to live on mere indifference for the most part.
Gabriel smiles, holding both of Castiel's shoulders firmly, "You will do this. Not only will you do this, you will do this well."
Dean nods, "Yeah, it's recent, about three weeks ago her ex knocked her up! Before breaking up with her because of it! So tonight I had to be an asshole as well and turn her down, a pregnant woman, in public! Luckily she is a classy woman who didn't throw a fit, but I still feel like an ass, you son of a bitch!"
"Of course you don't." He mumbles something under his breath that Castiel decides not to listen in on as he heads into the kitchen to get cereal for everyone. "We're eating and then you're leaving Sammy."
"The guy can't function like a normal human being. When he learns to cook and whatnot, maybe." Dean mumbles, "Until then he is coming with me to work."
Sam grins at him, "Is that your way of saying you like me and Dean?" He asks, now moving from his spot on Castiel's wings.
Castiel looks at him curiously and goes to inquire as to the meaning of his words when someone interrupts.
Dean rolls his eyes and motions for Castiel to cover Sam's ears, which he does. "Drinking and strip clubs, Castiel. I'm getting drunk and you're seeing boobs."
"You are both making me quite upset at the moment." Castiel mumbles, causing all movement on the floor to stop. "Oh. I did not mean to say that out loud. My apologies."
"Anyways, Cas, if you can hear this…thanks. You didn't exactly go about it in a way most people, and probably angels, would have…but you helped me and Sammy out so much. I have redeemed myself in his eyes, and my own, and I have been able to stop dwelling on our parents' death." He sighs heavily, "Of course I haven't been able to stop dwelling on you yet, but I'm sure it'll happen. Someday. No, actually, since god can probably hear this and tell you if I'm lying or not, fuck it. I'm sorry Cas, but I won't be able to move on. I fell in love with you so fully, I can't imagine being with someone else, ever.
"How big of you." Benny smiles, "Humans are pretty impressive, aren't they?" He asks and Castiel nods.
"Dean, does this car make you happy?" He asks, having noticed a sort of joy in the man since they entered the vehicle. It's nothing compared to normal happiness, but it's a sort of nostalgia that makes the man's heavy heart seem lighter. Of course Castiel sees no perks in the oversized slow box on wheels, but he would never say that to Dean or Sam.
"Angels do not get drunk." Castiel points out, eying Jo as she brings Dean another beer. "You are the one who will be getting drunk."
Holding Sam in his arms he watches as Dean gets ready before coming up to them and smiling at his little brother.
"The Winchester boys are quite selfless," Castiel muses, "I very much want to keep you both happy. Selflessness should be rewarded."
"Thank you, miss. It would cause quite the uproar if anyone knew." The angel says, "Dean does not need that sort of trouble."
"I didn't for the longest time," Castiel admits, "but since Gabriel has come I have had more time to notice things and yes, I've known for a couple of days." He sits up straight and looks away, "But I am an angel and you should not entertain any thoughts of it. I was hoping you wouldn't realize it at all. It would be easier to leave if you hadn't said it out loud…"
Castiel stares at the man incredulously, "A drunken man passed out in an alley sounds awfully cliché, if movies are anything to go off of." He points out, trying to get a rise out of Dean, but is rewarded with nothing. "I suppose I can bring us home." Sighing, Castiel gets them home quickly and lays the man in bed.
Dean goes to yell at him, or maybe kick his ass as previously promised, but he sees the truly guilt ridden look on Castiel's face and it stops him. He's not that big of an ass. "Look, I would have liked this all to of gone much different…" He admits, "But I…I'mgladImetyou…and stuff."
“Dreamt about you,” Castiel breathed into his ear, rubbing himself against Dean’s body the friction so good he couldn’t help the moan that escaped him.
They locked eyes, staring intently. “I want you to pull my hair, to touch me while I suck your dick.” Castiel said seriously.
“I imagine so. We had an arrangement but lately I’ve been,” he paused, searching for words, “otherwise engaged.”
“I can’t do that! I—I haven’t even kissed before!” He hissed, eyes darting around to make sure no one had heard.
Suddenly Dean felt angry. He felt very, very angry. How dare Cas just show up like this unwelcome and unwanted, just when everything was starting to make sense again. Dean felt his body move without his permission, reaching up to push the other man away from him. Not expecting such a violent reaction, Cas hadn’t braced himself properly and ended up falling to the floor. Dean scrambled up the bed, drawing his knees in tight to hide his body. “No.” He hissed, glaring at the startled man on the floor. “You don’t get to do that.”
"That's really good of you, baby," he purred, "thinking about my needs like that.” He took a step closer, crowding in as close as he could without their bodies touching. “You deserve a reward for being so good. What would like, Dean?" He said, thinking: please ask me to kiss you, please ask me to kiss you, please ask me to kiss you.
“Even if he were into guys,” he had to scramble to catch all the shirts she was throwing in his direction, “I don’t think I’d be his type.”
At some point between resurfacing and being set down on the pool deck, he must have passed out. When his eyes finally shot open he was choking and coughing up a lung full of water, Dean’s concerned face inches from his, hands steadying his shoulders.
Castiel’s glare darkened as he ran a hand through his messy black hair. “You interrupted me because my music is too loud?”
“Dean could be useful.” He offered weakly, refusing to acknowledge the part of him that filled with giddiness at the mention of loving Dean.
Introductions were awkward to say the least. Sam regarded him with a strange mix of apprehension and reluctant interest while Jessica stared unrelentingly, smiling knowingly every time they occasioned to share a glance. The third person, a lanky, loud, obnoxious man named Garth was simply irritating and his constant outbursts slowed their progress considerably.
Cas looked genuinely shocked for a moment but schooled his face quickly, making it as cold and emotionless as ever. Dean wondered if that was how he dealt with emotional situations, by just shutting down. “You said you never wished to see me again.”
Dean stepped closer inside, his eyes roving over the small space. The basics were the same as his own: the standard desk, bookcase, and chair provided by the university. The guy, Castiel, sat with his back to the door, hunched over the desk as he typed furiously on a laptop. There was a stone gargoyle perched by the window, piles of old books and scattered papers stacked haphazardly with coffee cups and mugs of tea on top of the books. There was a kettle plugged in in the corner opposite the gargoyle, and he’d even brought his own floor lamp, which cast a warm glow around the room. And fuck, Dean should get his own lamp because it was nice like that.
A series of irritated quips were on his tongue in an instant but that’s not what came out of his mouth. Instead he asked, “Why do you assume it’s a him?” blushing a little as he spoke.
He only barely managed to nod before turning around quickly and muttering, “Goodnight, Anna,” as he rushed up the stairs. It wasn’t his intention to be rude but the blush her words had provoked was not something he wished Dean to see.
Castiel smiled apologetically, taking the comment for what it was, an acknowledgement that he’d caused Dean a lot of turmoil ever since their meeting. Guilt overwhelmed him and he tried to pull his hand free but Dean only tighten his grip, dropping his voice and staring directly at Castiel, “That’s not what I meant.”
“Good.” Castiel said, abruptly letting go to cover another yawn. He walked toward the bathroom, brushing his teeth quickly while staring at Dean through the mirror, who remained standing awkwardly in the middle of the room concentrating on not touching himself. The sight made him a giddy kind of laughter bubble up, thrilled by the man’s obedience, his willingness to deny pleasure without needing to be told.
The words sent sparks through Castiel’s veins like he a livewire. They seemed to ignite his entire body with an urgent, boundless kind of need that he never dared imagine possible. He wasn’t built for this; it was feeling stolen from another’s life.
He stood in front of the bed, watching Cas sip the coffee. The man made a face, meeting Dean’s gaze coldly. “This the best coffee you have, baby? I can’t say I’m impressed.” He shook his head, taking another long sip. Dean rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet, waiting for Cas to let him touch. “Not impressed at all.” He set the cup down and leaned back against the headboard, pumping his fist a little faster.
“Yeah. But, look Cas.” Dean ran his hand along the curve of Castiel’s jaw, tangling his fingers in the soft hair behind his ear. He looked up, confused frown already in place. “Trust goes both ways. I can’t expect you to trust me if I don’t, you know, reciprocate.”
The sight of such unfettered submission made him moan, using his thumb to smear come across those freckled cheeks. Dean’s tongue darted out, asking permission, and Castiel complied, letting the man suck the come from his fingers. They sat like that for a minute just breathing heavily, eventually he pressed their foreheads together and smiled. A small laugh escaped his lips, the sound making Dean flush. He pulled his thumb free to kiss the sweet man beneath him, hand finding its way into his hair as he pushed their sweat slicked bodies together again.
From the bathroom, Dean made a strangled sound as the second lotion-covered finger stretched his hole wider. His hand thrust frantically, driving the fingers into his body as deep and hard as possible. Even from this distance Castiel could see the muscle clenching tightly on each delicious drag, clearly trying to make himself feel fuller.
Shortly after that plan failed, while wallowing in self-pity, he realized that he had something the department never did—he knew that Cas needed something from evidence. Clearly he’d given up thinking Dean would fetch it for him which meant that he’d have to come get it himself, or at least send a crony Dean could beat down for a phone number or something.
“Cas, you’ll be fine. This is like a dream come true, just don’t let him force you into anything.” She gently pulled her arm free, gathering up all their stuff except for his towel. “I’ll be at your place waiting to hear all the dirty details.”
“To stop pretending.” He sighed and finally looked up, holding Dean’s gaze as he tried to convey a million unspeakable yearnings. “I would very much like to be this person a little while longer.”
“Why are you calling?” He finally managed to ask, feeling an overwhelming sense of worry clawing its way up his spine.
In seconds, Cas had slicked himself with up with a mix of Dean’s come and his own precome. In the mirror they were both watching each other. Castiel was panting, thick cock pulsing hot and heavy in his hand as he pressed against the loose ring of muscle.
“We weren’t even in the same year! It is weird for a some random junior to add him a year after he graduates.” Castiel said, idly clicking through the rest of the album.
Seconds later the whole department was scrambling to get ready, emptying the armory almost entirely then rushing to their cruisers. It was a whirlwind of panic and frantic motions, the atmosphere of the building turned on its head by one phone call. All in all, it took ‘em about ten minutes to get everything ready, Dean and Benny sliding into the impala to lead a small army of squad cars toward something big and bad and unknown.
He thought to himself, slightly annoyed by all the people popping up like daisies in the spring or some shit.
Dean shrugged him off. "No, it's fine. I get it." He said genuinely, "It was a slip of your tongue, that's all. You saw humans to be only vessels for a long time... I am going to stop myself while I'm ahead here and not say anything I will hate myself for later. You did nothing wrong. I am just pissed that Gabriel was in my head."
"You tie up two men and forget to invite your own sister to the party? I'm hurt, Sami... genuinely, I'm hurt." Deanna said sarcastically as she put one hand over her chest to fake heartbreak or whatever reason girls tend to do that type of dramatic shit.
However, the fact that it felt right, the fact that Dean felt like he was meant to be kissing Castiel one way or another, started to freak Dean out.
"What was that?" Castiel asked. "I can't understand you when you have your head down in the pillow."
"Like I said before... We need to talk, Castiel." Chamuel replied calmly; however, she still was not meeting his gaze with her own. Instead, her eyes seemed to be focused on the paperwork that she was now shuffling in her hands.
"Ok… so then why are you hesitant? I mean, I know I'm hot, and you should know by now that your vessel is extremely attractive. So, me and you would work together just fine in any physical aspect!"
Castiel briefly broke the kiss to look at Dean. He looked surprised. But he didn't look unhappy. The fact that Dean's body reacted in such a way to him making out with him was just a shock, and the fact that they both were currently hard because of what they were doing made them both question even more what the hell was going on between them.
They needed to move this along before they both found release just by riding each other's legs. Not that Cas wasn't all for that idea, but he wanted their first time to be remarkable.
"Hello, boys! I'm so proud of you both (AN: As well as anyone reading this) for making it this far. You are halfway done with the program, and look how far you two have come!" Chamuel's voice echoed throughout the room.
This option sounded the most definite and thought out. Chamuel probably already knew that, though. Becoming human guaranteed him more freedom and safety. But Cas knew the Empty wouldn't be pleased that he found a loophole to their deal. It could find other ways to torture him, or worse.... it could find other ways to hurt him by hurting those he cared about. What if the Empty came after Dean and Sam? What if the Empty started resurrecting every evil demon or entitled angel that the three of them had killed? They would all come after them, and without Castiel's angel powers, what good would he be to Dean and Sam? He couldn't protect them as a human.
Dean looked towards the ground. He was unsure of what to say next. Honesty wasn't getting him very far, and thus was it was only proving his point that lying was way more simple.
"Well, does she... or he... hey, I don't judge - Does that person or angel feel the same way about you?" Dean asked.
Castiel continued to watch the slab of rock move upwards, finally revealing another tunnel leading in the opposite direction from which Dean had come.
The other Dean rolled his eyes at Castiel's lack of nerd knowledge. "It's not about stars going to war, man. It's just called Star Wars because it's set in space, and you know what will discuss this later."
"Well, like you just said, I'm Cassie... uhh, it's short for Cassiel, I too am an angel, and I don't exactly know a fun fact about myself to add into my introduction." She looked down sheepishly. It was strange to see an angel act so coy, but Dean found it kind of endearing that she was embarrassed over something so pointless.
"Exactly, and why should I make it any harder on them? I don't know if you had the pleasure of meeting the Empty, but it is not a force you want to deal with. The Winchester's are already on bad terms with Chuck. If I become human, then I am breaking my deal with the Empty, and I am pretty sure it wouldn't be happy about that."
"So what exactly do you remember, Mish?" Jensen asked Castiel. Jensen really wanted to ask Misha if he was okay because something seemed off about him right now, but he didn't want to put him on the spot in front of so many people.
"Well, you embellished it, but sure that's what I'm getting at. You were gone for hours, dude... I had no clue if you were dead or alive or worse... I didn't know what to think. And I can't exactly leave this cave without you. We still have one more round to complete before the devil angel women lets us leave here."
The point was that Dean had just involuntarily come out to Castiel. But that wasn't all... Rachel had hinted that Dean had some sort of attraction to Castiel.
"This cave... well, it's special. After years of living in the cave, I have been able to ward it in such a way that prevents any beings higher than that of an archangel from entering into these walls. So even God himself can't get in here." Chamuel gestured to the surrounding walls as if that would further prove her point.
"Woah Woah Woah hey, slow your roll Cas, I think I need to show you one last thing about this place before you jump to conclusions."
Kevin rolled his eyes. Obviously, arguing with a three-year-old was not at the top of his favorite day-to-day activities ."Yes, bath!" Kevin responded bluntly.
4. I may have over-explained, lol I apologize. It should make sense as you read through the chapter.
"Yeah yeah, sure, sunshine, you did great!" Dean replied sarcastically. "Now, just FYI, I am not doing this in order of how sad these events made me. That alone is an extremely morbid thing to do if I put them in any ranking order. Instead, I am just doing it by people and category. We will start with my fuck ups because, as you know, I hate admitting to them. So I want those out of the way." Dean stated, closing his eyes and changing their surroundings.
"Ha," Dean said sarcastically. "Difficult is an understatement. Let's just go through the last three and finish the game. I really need a beer or seven after this!" Dean wiped his hand across his face and stood up again from the table. Cas followed suit.
"At the time, I tried to pair you with someone you could relate to, Castiel. I didn't want you or any angel, for that matter, to go through eternity alone. That was my job, but you rebuked Barbiel before even giving her a chance. You turned her down. She disappeared for years because of what you did."
"What about him? Oh, I mean, he is here probably helping Ellen in the back or chilling downstairs in his room. Here Jack shares his time between living here and at Sammy's place. But when he is here, he either spends his time cooking with Ellen or helping Charlie and Dorothy man the hotel portion of the business."
?" Castiel repeated his question taking a small step closer to Dean. Dean quickly noticed and unintentionally stepped back away from the angel. Cas tilted his head with the unspoken question of why Dean was acting so strange all of a sudden.
"No, no, not at all! It's just drastically different from how you normally act in the mornings! I mean, your up before noon on our off day. I'd call that a miracle."
Dean hadn't been acting like himself lately. But then again, why would he be? Jack was gone, Castiel was avoiding the two brothers, and their mother Mary was now dead... again. It was all a lot to take in, even for two men who legitimately went to hell and came back.
Jensen grabbed Castiels arm and dragged him down the hallway. Finally, they reached the stairwell and went up a few levels before reaching a rooftop bar.
Both of them were confused. Of course, they were confused about different things but still confused nonetheless.
Sooner or later, Dean had made his way into the room. There was nothing inside of it. Well, nothing except for Castiel, who was standing in the center. He looked about just as confused as Dean felt about everything.
Dean rolled his eyes. He hated being imitated, but at the same time, he also understood that the angel was still learning the behavior of people, so he let it slide and kept his comments to himself.
"So what the fuck are you trying to say here?" Dean asked, starting to feel extremely insecure and frustrated. His face became red, and his fist became clenched at his side.
Dean let Castiel's eyes rake over his body; he knew he looked good and usually would try to bask in this sort of praise. However, this was Castiel, looking him over. Tonight wasn't just a random one-night stand; it was so much more. Dean suddenly felt highly self-conscious. The moment Cas' eyes finally met his own, Dean couldn't help but shy away.
Cas glared at Dean before continuing his explanation. "...Nonetheless, Jack was acting peculiar in regards to how he normally acts." He replied, turning to face the girls standing on the opposite of the semicircle that the six of them had formed in the hallway. "I had mentioned this observation to Sam and Dean last week, but we saw no pressing reason for us to intervene. So we all just continued on with our own business, but I kept a closer eye on Jack just to see if I could discover why he was acting strange."
Brief Smut/Fluff is included in the second half of this chapter. Feel free to skip after the line if you would prefer not to read that section. Either way, enjoy guys!
"I don't think intercourse will be necessary, Dean. It said "not too intimate," and last I checked, sex was at the utmost of human intimacy."
"Why Thursdays? Why not Saturday, or better yet, why not Friday? There is nothing good about Thursday except that it's the day before Friday."
Dean reached up to Castiel's shirt and began slowly unbuttoning it. "This - us - That's what I want."
"Their titles were similar. Castiel was the angel of Thursdays, a day near the end of the week for you humans. And Barbiel was the angel of October, which is a month near the end of earth's cycle around the sun!"
"Where the hell have you been, man? And why are you still wearing the Cas get-up? I know you think it suits you, and I'm not disagreeing, but do you really think it's appropriate to wear that to a bachelor party?" Fake Dean smirked.
As much as Dean would love to further this intimacy, he couldn't because this Castiel wasn't his. If he were going to go all the way with an angel, it would definitely be his own angel.
"Haha, very funny!" Cas replied sarcastically and held up his hand like he was in the Beyonce Single Ladies music video. Instead, however, there was a bronze and gold ring on his finger, with something carved into that Dean couldn't read from so far away.
"Huh... Well, damn, that's an easy question, I thought they were going to exploit my honesty here, but I guess they missed their opportunity. HAha!" said Dean grinning to himself. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all. Castiel knew him well enough to know his fears.
"Uh no, I mean a bar is a bar, but that particular memory doesn't really make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, so I spiced it up just a bit. Enough to make it so that I wasn't constantly reminded about Micheal." Dean explained.
The toddler nodded in defeat, and Sam took him down the hallway to what was presumably the bathroom. Projection Dean took this moment to stand up while Mary and Kevin declared they were going into the kitchen to start dinner. Projection Dean and Castiel, however, stayed.
"Mourning is never an easy process, and magic cannot fix his anguish." Rowena replied sympathetically. "Even if I could find a spell to help Dean move along with this, I am sure it would come at a cost much greater than what it has to offer. It may even make the situation worse than it was. Magic is already a tricky art to handle, but mixing that directly with the complexity of a human's emotions could be utterly catastrophic. I wish I..."
"I've fallen into 'lust' at first sight, but no... never love. I think that love takes a lot more than just looking at someone. You have to form a bond or a type of trust before you can admit to an emotion as strong as love." Dean replied. Gosh, he hated sounding like such a poet, but this honesty spell wouldn't let him pick and choose his own wording. He was forced to say how he felt no matter how girly it sounded.
"I hated this period as well. It was like you were there physically but also not present at all." Cas commented as soon as the scene stopped.
"I prefer to say that I jump into action quickly but, alright, whatever to each their own." Dean interjected.
"Yes... I mean, no. I don't fucking know, man. It's been months, and I mean Cas, I'm am not worth all this. I'm not worth months of travel, and I'm definitely not worth you giving up your grace." Dean said as he rubbed the back of his neck nervously, trying to look anywhere but at Castiel.
Castiel was pretty satisfied with Dean's answer. So he reached his hand over and lifted the next card. " Have you ever fallen in love at first sight?" Cas asked Dean.
"You seem oddly happy this morning!" Sam commented, causing Dean to stop humming and roll his eye at his brother.
"OKAY, OKAY... I get it! Thank you, Cas." Dean said sarcastically, hoping that he would stop talking about it, but Cas didn't seem to take the hint.
Dean never really had entertained the idea of living a normal life with him and Cas together. There was too much evil in the world to hope for a normal life. But, unfortunately, his life had never been normal, and when he tried to have the best of both worlds with Lisa and Ben, he ended up losing them both for their own safety.
Castiel turned to directly face Sam and Dean. "Do either of you recall when I had mentioned to you last week that I thought Jack was acting a bit odd?" He asked.
Dean's eyes darted back and forth as he tried to process this information. "... And this-this is the only way to keep you from getting dead?" He asked.
Dean glared and pointed at Sam. "First off, you shut your mouth. Second off, why the hell do you automatically assume that I'd be on the bottom?"
Dean looked at Castiel, shocked that he had caved in so easily. Why would he want to comply with a reclusive archangel who doesn't know the meaning of boundaries? 'I guess both Chamuel and Castiel have that in common." Dean thought to himself while still staring at Castiel.
"You are exactly right, Castiel. Five Rounds, each round containing a set of questions and a corresponding numbered door. However, after each round, you are permitted a break. Time works differently here, so I highly suggest that you take the break and rest for the night after completing each of the five stages. This will provide you time to process the events that occurred beforehand. During those breaks, the sixth door labeled as room in Enochian will be unlocked. It will serve as your living quarters until your program is complete!"
"Ok, now if you are done being defiant, let's hurry and get you clean before..." outside, there was the sound of a car pulling up the driveway.
Suddenly a loud crash followed by the sound of two women yelling back and forth came from down the hall.
"Answer me this, do you really blame me for your mother's death?" Castiel asked. The blue in his eyes now reflecting a somewhat gray tone.
The room filled with fluttering sparks as Castiel attempted to heal Dean's wounds. However, during the brief sparks of light that emanated from Castiel's hands, Dean could tell from his facial expressions that he was truly struggling to complete the task. A moment later, the sputters of light ceased, and Dean felt immensely better than he had before.
The saying had never made much logical sense to Castiel before, but now he thought he maybe understood what the point of it was. Sometimes you can't get everything you want. You have to sacrifice one thing in order to obtain another. The question remained, though, that Cas didn't know what he wanted.
"My point is Castiel, that this deal changes things." She explained calmly. She didn't want to further his anger.
"Uhh, no, I haven't spoken to them, but I can call tonight if you let me borrow your phone... mine is dead." Dean knew he didn't have a phone on him, so he had to play that off as well despite the shocking events unfolding around him. "So umm... who else is coming? Jog my memory." Dean asked, curious to see if his theory would be a reality here.
"No, Dean," Castiel sighed in annoyment, "... I mean, he wanted to perform acts of intimate human relations- with me."
The two men glanced at each other before making their way to separate cubicles. At that point, Rachel walked around the cubicles to the middle of the cave in front of the cubicles to be heard clearly by both men. Since she was standing and they were sitting, she stood above the cubicles and would be able to address both Dean and Cas directly.
"No, not typically. I mean, if they are a douche bag, then yeah it costs money, but typically some of them will leave donations from credit card schemes to help us keep the place maintained." Dean answered.
By four a.m., the six adults had separated into 4 groups: Sam with Sami, Castiel with Deanna, and Dean and Cassie on their own.
Dean let out a sigh of relief, choosing to ignore the fact that Sam had just called him a mother hen. "Alright, well, now that damage control is covered, Cas, tell us what you got."
"After mom died, you know - the first time she died at our house in Lawerence...my entire world started to change. Suddenly monsters weren't just a part of any old fairy tale. A monster... A demon... took my mother away from me. My father was so focused on vengeance that he didn't see the burden he was putting on his own children. But I can't blame him for that, I guess... He lost his true love, and that caused him to lose a part of himself...He was so focused on vengeance that he nearly forgot that Sammy and I existed. I had to choose to either step up or drop out, and there was no chance in hell that I would ever leave Sammy behind. So, I grew up. No matter what my age was at the time, my main goal was to take care of Sam. To make sure he had the best life possible. I lost myself a bit during that time... I lost the ability to find hope for a better future for myself. So... yeah, that's my answer. I no longer believe in hope because to me, it's just some fucking fairytale." Dean said.
"I just... I just sometimes wish I mattered to you as much as he does... as much as you matter - to me..." Castiel focused on the ground below him.
"Of course, I saw it. I don't sleep. I was in my room reading a novel by John Green entitled "Paper Towns" when the flash occurred."
Dean spent his time 'researching' the bottom of a few beer bottles while catching up with the latest season of Doctor Sexy in his new temporary room.
Dean paused for a moment. He hated everything about his childhood because he didn't really get to have one. He had to grow up quickly after Mary died in the fire. However, after a minute or two, Dean finally thought of his honest answer.
"No, Cas, Jack didn't think at all about this or the harm this could bring to a lot of people. We've seen the universe where Sam and I don't exist, and it's all been blown to smithereens. Imagine what the hell might be let loose in their universe without any Winchesters there to stop it?"
They both moaned when both their erections lined up next to one another. The feel of skin on skin, wholly exposed and touching in the most intimate ways, was complete utter bliss.
But before Castiel could ask Jensen why all these people were gathered here, fake Sam was pushing through the crowd of men and heading towards them.
"Hello, Samuel? Is everything all right? It's two in the morning...." Rowena said. Somehow the phone only seemed to amplify the woman's already strong accent.
"And who the hell is Jack? In fact, this is getting more confusing by the second, so why don't we all just go around the room and introduce ourselves?  You start, pretty boy!" Deanna stated, pointing to Cas.
"Cassie, I know he isn't the prettiest guy in the world, but it's rude to call the less attractively inclined peculiar," Deanna said.
Dean closed his eyes, dreading what challenges he would face tomorrow with this forced honesty spell on him.
Finally, Castiel gave in and lifted the card at the top of the dwindling stack. "What is something you believed in as a child that you no longer believe in?" He asked Dean.
"Jensen... man, I don't know where to begin. You are a fantastic man, a wonderful co-worker, and even better at putting up with me practically every day for the past few years. You've seen me grow taller and my hair grow even longer." Everyone laughed. "You've been there for me through everything, the good and the bad. You watched me fall in love with my now amazing wife, Gen, and it has truly been an honor to see you fall in love with Daniele. You're not just my brother on-screen. You are my brother here and now and always. I wanted to put more jokes in this short speech, but Gen said my jokes were too inappropriate for such a momentous occasion. I would have argued, but as you will soon learn, Jensen, you have to pick your battles. Women are feisty little devils, or demons in my case." Everyone laughed again at that, but Castiel didn't get quite get the joke. "To Jensen and Daniele, may you live long and prosper. And yes, I did quite Spock, deal with it."
"Well...typically, no, and even when you could, you risk redirecting the future, which, as you already know from previous experiences, is far too risky even to attempt... I don't understand where you are going with this." Rowena replied.
"Do you... Do you wish it would go back to that type of simplicity?" Castiel said barely above a whisper as if the thought alone saddened him.
"I just wanted to warn you that your challenge will be coming up soon, and trust me, it's not what you'd expect."
O'Malley picked up two small cups and handed one to Dean and the other to Castiel. Inside Dean's, the cup was a small clear capsule with blue liquid swirling around inside it. Castiel's cup contained the same, except for his pill had green liquid inside of it.
Castiel smiled fondly at him. Gosh, he wanted to give this man the sun, moon, and stars; but he had no idea how to do so.
The look eventually made Sam break. "Fine, maybe you could, I don't know, make sure I win the bet. We could split the profit 30/70." He smirked.
But before Dean could think of what to say in response, Castiel spoke up. "I'm sensing awkwardness."
"Shit!" Kevin said, starting to look around frantically like he could just hide the toddler or something.
"This is your journey, Dean. I just stopped by to tell you that I will be by your side no matter what happens in here or out there. You always have me, and I will always support you no matter what. I want you to be happy and hopefully this program could be the start of something new for you!"
"DNA test? What are you talking about?" Dean asked, still as confused as before when she handed him the hairbrush. But Castiel's eyes widened in realization.
Dean had found multiple outfits inside his magically appearing suitcase, along with a toothbrush and toothpaste.
Dean interjected. "Cas, for the love of all things good, please stop talking and go to sleep, please, I am begging you."
Castiel tilted his head back towards the ceiling. Obviously, he wasn't getting his point through to Dean by walking around the answer, which annoyed him greatly. Sure, Castiel was better at discussing emotions than Dean was, but that wasn't hard to accomplish.
That night, Sam reached out to three people: Jody Mills, Donna Hanscom, and Garth Fitzgerald. All three agreed to meet him at the bunker and arrived within the proceeding twenty-four hours.
"You assumed I would want to stay with Dean." Castiel stated. It was his turn to be confused now. Didn't they know by now that he would choose to keep Dean safe over himself? Isn't that what they wanted him to do? Trap him into a corner and force him into the program.
"You go to the store. I'll clean up your room and throw your clothes in the wash while you're gone."
"Ughh, do I have to explain everything?................. Fine! Both of these pills are  you took earlier, except now they're switched, so you both have the same effects."
Realization spread over Castiels face when he suddenly understood the depth of Dean's question. Typically Dean refused to acknowledge emotion-related topics, but right now, he was instigating it. Cas knew not to take this change in Dean lightly. However, he couldn't spook Dean right now either. Anything too emotionally true may offset him, so Castiel decided his answer needed to be blunt and honest.
"I probably should have pulled this thing out sooner, but I like to use it for dramatic effect!" Rachel stated, sending a grin to both boys before pressing play on her remote.
It was hard enough growing up without a mother and having to raise Sammy on his own. Still, the moment Amara brought back Mary, Dean had felt like a massive piece of the puzzle that was his life had finally fallen into place.
That didn't stop him, though, from internally questioning and overthinking about the events that just happened. Nothing could prevent his mind from coming up with other possible reasonings or explanations behind the hunter's actions.
"Astute observation Dean, something IS going on, which is why I went to check up on Jack when a flash of light filled the bunker about half an hour ago!" Castiel explained.
Who is ready for part 1 of round #5? And yes I had to separate it into two parts because this part alone is over 8,000 words. So I split it up for my own sanity. I worked hours on this chapter but knowing me, there will still be some grammar issues here and there; even though I proofread it twice. So please bear with me on that. Happy reading my dudes!
Nonetheless, the short light blip was enough reason for Dean to insist upon getting his lazy ass out of bed so that he could search the bunker and figure out what the hell was going on.
"Well... I think that's enough chick flick talks for one card. How about we go back and try to finish up this round now? Does that work with you?"
Dean moved his hands so that now his forehead was lying in it. "I know that... but it's just that's, not me, okay?... It's not a part of my image. I'm the guy who women swoon over! I am not the guy who swoons over another person or another male as a matter of fact."
She was hot. Dean would never deny that fact which was the first thought to pop into his mind if he was honest. If he had met her at some sort of bar or something, he would have inevitably flirted with her. But this wasn't a bar, this was his kitchen, and she had no business being in it.
"Shhh, Cas. I got you! We'll take it slow, okay? Just like this." Dean said, sliding one hand in between their two bodies and wrapping his hand around both erections.
"Well, isn't this just fan-freaking-tastic!" Dean mumbled to himself. "I'm either blind, or it's just extremely dark in here."
After Cas looked into Dean's eyes, he saw that Dean looked oddly calm and okay with what was going on between them. He quickly ducked back into kissing Dean's lips slowly shifting his hips slowly back and forth on Dean's hips, still positioned on his lap. Dean moaned into Castiel's lips but blushed the moment he realized he just moaned because of Castiel.
"What the what???" Dean asked, quickly standing up and backing a few feet away to get a better look at Castiel. As if a new viewpoint would somehow help Dean better comprehend what Cas had just admitted to him. Dean swore up and down that he must have just misheard Cas. There was no one in hell that he had actually said what Dean thought he said.
"JACK!" Kevin yelled. "Where are you, you little demon? I know baths aren't exactly your forte, but I promised your Dads that I would have you squeaky clean before sundown, and if you take a look outside, the sun is, in fact, going down, so we need to hop to it, mister!" Kevin said frantically, looking in all the areas that a small child could hide in.
"Okay? Thats it... I spill my fucking feelings out to you, and all you say is okay?" Dean asked, somewhat bewildered by the short response.
Another shuffle came from the opposite end of the room. And therewith a sudden flicker, the house lights came. They were blinding considering how long their eyes had been adjusted to their dark surrounding. At the moment, Dean wondered if one could become blind from something like that, but he decided to file that question away to bug Sammy about later.
"I don't think you would believe me if I told you," Dean admitted even though he himself honestly had no idea what was going on.
Castiel tilted his head, obviously not unconvinced by Dean's response. But Dean quickly spoke up again before Cas got the chance to dissect his response. "So who did I marry? Was she smoking hot or what?" Dean wiggled his eyebrows, attempting to lighten the mood.
After a few rings, someone picked up. The voice of a Scottish woman could be heard on the other side of the telephone line:
Castiel sat up. "What happened?" He asked, squinting his eyes and tilting his head a bit - typical Cas mannerisms.
Castiel scoffed. "Well, you sure did act like it. You volunteered me to go with Belthagor to hell without even a second thought. There was no guaranteed exit for me now, was there? And yet you didn't even bat an eye. Then despite the odds, I did make it out of hell alive, and you still had the nerve to question my judgment about killing Belthagor. Even after I had explained to you that he planned to absorb all the souls in hell with the intent of using that power to ruling it and who knows what else."
Garth smiled. "Thank you for asking Dean! My family is just fine. In fact, the twins are teething now, and our chew toys are getting torn up quicker than you can say olly olly oxen-free."
The longer Dean was stuck here, the more he hated this entire trial thing. It pushed him to new levels of self-exploration, and he hated that. His whole life, he had never spent so much time on himself, so considering the fact that this place made him do so was way too much introspection for Dean to take in.
"He's a two-year-old teenager Cas, he probably just needed some alone time, and I personally don't wanna know what the kid gets up to in his private time!" Dean said.
Dean rolled his eyes and held up his hands like he was surrendering for a minute before dramatically dropping them back to his sides, fuming. "Why?!?! You're seriously fucking asking me why I included it? I FUCKING INCLUDED IT BECAUSE I PRACTICALLY LAID ALL MY FEELINGS OUT TO YOU, AND YOU JUST STOMPED ON THEM. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HARD THAT WAS FOR ME TO FUCKING DO CAS? I DON'T TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS, BUT I STILL DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE TRUTH. I NEED YOU CAS, IN MORE DAMN WAYS THAN ONE, AND WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT, YOU JUST FUCKING WALKED OUT ON ME!" Dean yelled.
"The script translates to open the door, you may only try once more. It takes the combination of two, but not too intimate and more like glue."
"You may not have known about my deal with the empty, but you must have known about my feeling towards you, or else I doubt you would have kissed me as you did... My point is you exploited my feelings against you so that you could get out of this damn cave. Am I wrong?" Dean asked Cas.
A half a dozen spins later, Castiel and Dean were tangled up in each other. Sadly not in the romantic sense, but they were still intertwined nonetheless.
"On the table, you will find a deck of cards. Pick one up at a time and read the prompt out loud. The other player must either answer a question or follow the instructions. If the player fails to do so, then there will be consequences. Answer the questions fully and truthfully." Chamuel's voice echoed throughout the room.
"...Out of all the movies we have watched, you had to pick that one?" Dean questioned, and Castiel just nodded, content with his choice. "Okay, fine, whatever. I can work with that one because it does include a montage." Castiel tilted his head but this time widened his eyes with curiosity. "Do you remember the part of the movie where Rapunzel is starring up at the ceiling and keeps seeing the sun symbol throughout all her artwork? Well, before she realizes that she is actually kidnapped royalty, many old memories flash up on the screen, one after another. That movie did the montage thing extremely fast though, I guess we probably need to go through each memory you pick a little more at a normal pace than that."
Dean hadn't slept much, if at all, within the past two weeks. He refused to eat until Sam would end up lecturing him for so long that Dean finally would comply out of pure annoyance. And, worst of all, Dean's drinking got so excessive that Sam had found him passed out late one night on the bathroom floor.
Dean quickly looked up, extremely confused by what he had just heard. But before he could ask, Cas had left the room.
"You know, Dean; we will have to leave this room at one point or another. Weren't you the one who wanted to leave this place as soon as possible?" Castiel asked.
Dean scoffed and pushed past his brother and headed towards his room. "Maybe you should ask Chamuel since you and her got us into this fucking mess in the first place." Dean exclaimed over his shoulder.
Dean took another step forward. "What I think you are saying is... you want me. Am I right, or am I right?" Dean smirked at Castiel despite the angel still not meeting his eye contact.
Cas's wings were stunning, Dean would deny it later on, but he just stared at them, marveling at how beautiful they were for a few moments. It took all his efforts not to reach out and run his hand through the soft silky feathers. And despite the poor lighting in the room, the light seemed to dance across them as the wings shifted position every so often.
"Well, Kevin couldn't convince him either, and I could only convince him by threatening to take away storytime. You are a great parent to him, Dean. I mean, he told me himself that storytime is his favorite part of the day. He enjoys all the voices you make for the characters and how you always hum Hey Jude to him until he falls asleep. Jack adores you!"
Castiel shook his head from side to side. "I never had to sleep much before, Dean, so how would I know about this phenomenon?"
Castiel turned around swiftly with a scowl on his face. "How about you STOP acting like we're friends, and we just go finish this next round so we can be one step closer to going our 'separate' ways."
"Listen… from what I understand, these girls all picked the exact same rooms that we are currently living in, which is why Samantha woke up in your bed! So if they stay here, who's supposed to get our rooms?"
During the silence, Dean began mentally rewording the lyrics to a song that would already fit well into this situation - Hello Darkness, my old friend, I've come to stand here awkwardly (while this angel probably is attempting to blindly stare into my soul) again. And yes, I know it's slightly creepy; he said he watched me while I was sleeping. And yet the vision of him that is planted in my brain, well he still remains, here in the sound of silence.
Dean opened his eyes, which were now glistening, and held up a hand to stop Cas from speaking. "Let me finish! You didn't come back, and as much as it sucked for me, I understood why. Choosing to leave the cave would mean you would lose your grace, and I know I'm not worth giving up your grace. I understood why you didn't come back, and in time I came to accept it." He lied. "So, what I'm asking is why the hell are you back six months later? Why now?"
"I CAN'T FUCKING LIE IN HERE, CAS! WE BOTH TOOK THAT DAMN HONESTY PILL. SO BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY I DID NOT SLEEP WITH HIM, but you know what? FINE, I'm going to pick up and read this next card now. And I swear to God, if Chamuel or any of her minions can hear me right now, it better be something that HELPS ME OUT IN THIS SITUATION!" He yelled the last part up at the ceiling.
"Oh, you've got to be kidding me…." Dean mumbled, trying to hold as still as possible to not provoke whoever the person wielding the knife was.
"Let's just dive right in!" Dean said with a grin. He hadn't gotten off of the joyful high he had gotten from using the projection magic. "Okay, Cas, this is another Picture This card. It says Montage Time - Show your top 5 favorite memories."
Sam kept true to his word and made his way back to the bunker precisely three days later. He cautiously opened the front door and listened for any distant screams or moans that would signal he needed to extend his vacation a bit longer.
5. Lastly, I hope you enjoy this chapter. It especially took a long time, but I think it turned out alright. Feel free to give me any feedback. I love both positive and constructive criticism. Basically, I love hearing from you guys. Y'all are awesome.
Instead, he went with a navy blue V-neck t-shirt, a black blazer jacket over it, his nicest pair of blue faded jeans, and black boots.
The more Dean thought about it, the more it would make sense for Castiel to be scared of the dark. If he lived practically his whole extremely long life with night vision, then being completely encased by the darkness for the first time would be a pretty terrifying concept to grasp.
Castiel nodded at Dean and then looked towards the rest of the group. "Follow me!" He requested as he exited the room and began making his way down the hallway.
"Hey - no," Castiel said, placing his knees onto the bed and then crawling up until his own body framed Dean's. Cas then lowered himself down until he was lying on top of the hunter. Now Dean and Cas were skin to skin, chest on chest, heart to heart. Yet still, Dean wouldn't look Cas in the eyes.
Dean chuckled, eyes still focused on the task at hand. "You asking what type of position I want?" Dean stopped undoing the buttons halfway down the shirt to look up at Cas and smirk playfully before resuming once again.
"Somewhat... Think of it more as illusion creation. It will feel like you are really somewhere when you will. In reality, you will still be in the cave." O'Malley responded.
"See what I mean?" Sammy smirked. "It's cool, right? It's like facetime but much more realistic." Sam exclaimed with child-like joy.
"Alright..." Dean thought that would be the end of the discussion, but of course, Cas had different plans for the direction of their conversation.
Chamuel rolled her eyes and then directed her attention to Castiel. "The door is unlocked now, so enter it whenever you both are ready. But before I leave, I have to ask one quick question to Castiel... Why is it that you haven't yet used your ability yet?"
Sam got up and walked directly in front of his frantic brother and grabbed onto both his shoulders. "Dean - breathe." Sam instructed. "Just talk to me for a second, okay? Now tell me -  how the fuck did you not know Cas should be coming back today?" He asked
"Or… maybe I should be asking who the lucky fella is? Hey, I don't judge, whatever gets you off at night. But either way, who is it?"
"The first is you don't leave. You and Dean can finish the program, but you wouldn't be able to leave with him when round 5 is completed. So instead, you would stay here, and to have a sense of purpose, you could join as an angel in my program if you would like." She responded.
"Well, why would I ever tell you about that... You never asked. I didn't even tell Dean until I was forced to mention it because it became relevant to the task of the room you last sent us into. So why would I share that bit of information with you?" Castiel questioned. He was starting to feel a bit heated. Whatever was going on here was definitely not his fault and wouldn't have a stranger proclaim otherwise.
"I don't think they feel the same way as I do, but I still hold out hope nonetheless." Castiel said, his checks flushing.
"Well, no one ever said parenting would be an easy task!" Projection Castiel joked, causing that Dean to break into a small grin.
"Ughhh fine ..." Dean said, surrendering to answer Castiel's question. " The reason I would consider putting you in the title of my non/never existent memoir is because of how much you impacted Sam and me when you dropped or, in your case, probably flew into our lives."
"Dean!" His brother exclaimed. Sam was excited to see that Dean was finally home. It may have only been a few days, but the bunker had been eerily quiet without him there.
"I just have a lot on my mind right now." Castiel mumbled in response, still focusing on the ground below.
Castiel reiterated her instructions to make sure he understood, "So basically... it's like stages, right? To unlock a door and move through the program, we must answer a set of questions first. Once we answer all the questions in the set truthfully, the door will unlock. After completing the task of door number one, the process will cycle back around in order for us to unlock door number two. Since there are five numbered doors, I am assuming that this cycle will need to be repeated five times?"
"Boredom is a luxury that I have yet to experience since meeting the Winchester sisters, but I typically take an hour or two out each night to experience the peace and beauty of nature by strolling through the surrounding wooded area."
"Long enough to know what's currently occurring between you two." Chamuel's voice stated bluntly over the unseen speaker system.
"I'm here to level out the playing field." Gabriel stated, handing them both a pill and a glass of water. "The sooner you both take your unprescribed drugs, the sooner I can explain the rules for this final round, and then I'll be on my merry way."
"Uhh… yeah… no, you don't! See, cause I've been living here for quite a while, and this bunker may be big, but it ain't that big, honey, and I think I would've definitely noticed someone like you around here before now." Dean said.
"I had no idea what he was doing, Dean. For all, I knew he was just practicing his powers and sending the envelope somewhere else within the bunker walls. I didn't want to alarm you or Sam unless I knew exactly what was going on first."
"I needed to give you incentive. I had to know how far you were willing to go to protect your 'friend' over there." She tilted her head in the direction of Castiel.
"No… I…  Am I being punked? Did my brother put you up to this?" Dean asked, looking around swiftly to see if he could find a hidden camera or something else that would prove that this was all just some big weird practical joke.
Dean scooted himself farther back onto the bed so that he was leaning back, only propped up by his elbows. At the same time, he moved to the center of the bed; he slid off his pants. Meaning both Dean and Cas were now only wearing their boxers.
Dean took a deep breath and got off the elevator pulling Castiel into a tight hug. "I am better than okay. I am fucking fantastic." Dean pulled back from the hug and looked deep into Castiel's eyes.
"BUT that's not all you and Dean have in common." Castiel stated and pretended that he talked to Dean instead of Jensen since he knew Dean so much better. "You're both are a lot more complex than you portray yourself to be. You have so many great qualities, which are evident from the numerous kind words spoken here before me tonight. All your talents and characteristics are so phenomenal that it's hard to believe that one person alone can possess them all. But you do... and so does Dean. I know I am barely skimming the surface here of all that could be said, but you can't capture light, and therefore no words would serve you justice Jensen. It's hard to believe that any woman could be worthy of your lifelong commitment, but I'm... I'm thrilled you found someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. That's all I - I could ever want for you. I wish you and your future life to be just as bright as you made my life. Congratulations, De-Jensen!"
"I don't think it was a past life, Dean... you have pissed enough people off in this lifetime to last an eternity." A familiar voice replied to him.
Dean's expression softened. "Oh... I guess I kinda missed that part." He admitted, which Cas knew was the closest he would get to an actual apology from the hunter.
Really? What are we twelve? Is this a slumber party? If it is, we need to get Sam here pronto. We could braid his hair and have a pillow fight as well."
"If I told you what the true purpose of the test before you took it, then you wouldn't have taken it correctly." She replied. The smirk seemed glued to her face.
Chamuel's smile fell, but she didn't look disappointed at Dean's witty comeback. "No, those boulders were quite real." she said as if Dean didn't already know that.
Rachel grinned and clicked a few more buttons on her remote, "I thought you might ask about that."  she smirked.
"You already had a say Castiel. You made your decision. You decided not to discuss the matter with Dean beforehand. Based on my code of conduct, I have to hold you to your original choice. I could hold you to that decision for eternity, but I won't do that. So, in three months, I will ask you the same question again. If you give me a different answer, I will respect your change of mind. If you don't, then you will be a welcomed addition to our team."
Cas licked Dean's upper lip during the kiss, and Dean took the hint that he wanted to deepen the kiss. When their tongues collide with one another, they didn't fight for dominance. Instead, they just explored and accepted the power that the other could hold over the other person. The current moment wasn't about dominance. It was about being with one another.
Not only had Sammy tidied up all of Dean's shit, but he also evidently changed Dean's bedsheets, remade his bed, and had lit up half a dozen candles which were now sporadically placed around his bedroom.
Once Dean got back to the bunker, he rushed over to his room and was shocked to find it was now completely spotless. Sam seriously was a miracle worker with cleaning supplies, apparently.
" During the game, the two people are locked in a room. They are supposed to make out and do whatever dirty deed that they want to do before the seven minutes are up." Dean explained
"Death is highly unlikely," O'Malley said to Dean before turning to face Castiel. "Now, Castiel, your pill grants you one main ability while you are enrolled in this program. This ability is somewhat angelic in nature, but it's a bit more vamped up. You will be able to project scenes into your surroundings."
He hadn't hunted much since the incident. Still, after the intervention, Dean realized he needed to start getting back into the family business. Saving people, hunting things, that's what he was born to do, and he would damn well do it until he stopped breathing.
Castiel huffed out in annoyance. "Our bond was symbolized by the handprint mark. Just because the physical remembrance of it went away doesn't mean that the bond isn't still there, Dean. If you don't remember, I raised you out of hell, I rebuilt you, and I fell from heaven for you. So forgive me for being a bit possessive over someone I've spent so much time and effort on." he said, saying the last sentence with as much of a sarcastic tone that he could manage in his current frustrated state.
"So Cas," Dean spoke out into the black void that was now surrounding him. He wasn't sure exactly where Castiel was in reference to his own position, but he guessed that he was still relatively close to where he had been before the door closed. "You can be my eyes. What do you see around us?"
"...yeah, it's definitely a good one." Dean muttered, shifting his eyes away from Cas and back to the scene.
"Ok, good to know. Now your turn stretch, name, occupation, and hell, why not add a fun fact about yourself to spice this up a bit!" Deanna prompted.
"Dean, I lost my son.... our son, he was mine as much as he was yours and Sam's. I made a deal. A deal with the empty when we first revived Jack. I agreed to let the empty take me in his place."
"Oh, isn't that just fan-freaking-tastic!!" Dean exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air as he dramatically fell back into his seat.
Cas's cheeks became a bit red again, but he rolled his eyes to try and play it off. "I think we should just move forward with the game." He said as he reached down to pick up the next card and read it to Dean. "Picture This: Montage Time - Reveal your top 7 worse memories (Excluding times of death)."
"We should probably get going on this final round," Dean spoke up. He talked in a manner much calmer than he actually was. Internally, Dean was still mad at Castiel for just walking out on him in room five. BUT if either of them ever wanted to leave this cave, they both needed to get through this final round. Dean decided he could sulk later on when he was settled back into his room in the bunker. For now, he would place all emotions mentally on the backburner.
WARNING: This chapter contains Explicit Content! If that's not your cup of tea, then please feel free to skip the section in between the two lines. Everything before and after the two lines is all PG-13 material.
Dean went to inspect the final product in the mirror. With his new haircut and his outstanding fashion choice, he had to admit that he looked fan-fucking-tastic. If Dean were Cas, he would have a hard time keeping his hands off himself.
The sound of wings once again filled the room. In the blink of an eye, Gabriel was standing beside the other archangel.
Somehow, despite the two brothers living under the same roof, Dean had managed to avoid Sam entirely. The only time Dean would speak to him was when it was absolutely necessary, and even then, Dean would only give him the bare minimum response.
After finally getting his bearings again, Dean was easily able to find his attacker. The whole time it had been directly in front of him.  Dean's eyes widened as he saw two large jet-black wings protruding from Castiel's back. He felt like such an idiot for not noticing it before now. Of course, the bright flash of light had come from Cas; how could he be so stupid.
To Dean, this game seemed to come straight out of a chick flick, and he hated those with a passion. Castiel, however, seemed to be enjoying this, which only made Dean more irritated. He could be off solving a case with or finding a way to fight Chuck, but NOOOOOOO; instead, he was trapped in a furnished cave and forced to play a child's game.
"So then it was similar to the handprint I left on you when I raised you from perdition? The one that symbolized our profound bond."
Castiel walked over to the elevator with Dean's suitcase and pressed the button before he signaled Dean to follow along.
Castiel looked at him sympathetically! "Yes - You're scared of having to tell the truth when asked the questions on the cards. Chamuel told me in a dream last night that she was able to limit the effects of the spell to one room."
"Castiel, they are cards. She has no control of which one we pull." Dean picked up a card to prove his point, but the card was blank. He quickly picked up another and another and another. All of them were blank.
Sam, of course, was heartbroken from their losses as well, but not too the same severity as Dean was.
"Fuck you! For your information, everybody loves my input! All I'm saying is maybe you should hear her out before issuing death threats! It's a little dramatic, even for you, don't you think?"
The following two turns came and went. Dean continued to point out how stupid this game was, and Castiel continued to insist to him that it was just a way to ease them into more profound questions later on.
"Well, after I had originally told you the truth about my deal with the Empty, Chamuel overheard our conversation, and she ended up giving me two choices."
"Ehhh.... I've changed more than you probably think I have." Dean said, referring to the fact that he wasn't even actually this universes real Dean.
Within a brief moment, the shock in Castiels eyes fluttered away and instead was replaced with a look of trust and adoration. His sturdy stance had softened tremendously since Dean first stepped into his personal space, and suddenly he was leaning in closer to Dean. Cas briefly broke their eye contact to glance down towards Dean's lips. It happened so quickly that no one else would have noticed, but Dean did, and it made his heart skip a beat.
At first, Cas didn't move. He was confused at all the mixed signals Dean had given him. But it didn't take long for him to wrap his head around what was going on. And finally, he allowed himself to melt into kissing the hunter.
Castiel pulled his hand out of Dean's boxer's and rested it on his chest. "I'm sorry, Dean... I really wasn't trying to cross a boundary or anything with you... I just thought this might be you playing hard to get or-."
Deep down, they knew they both wanted this, but by admitting it to one another, Castiel would be taken by the empty, and neither wanted that. Right now, they just wanted to show each other how they felt without confirming those feelings through words.
"Well... nice try, bud, but to give somebody the silent treatment, you actually have to remain silent. It's in the name silent treatment." Dean said, trying to ease the tension building up in the room. Sadly not the good type of tension, but tension nonetheless.
"What is both of them?" Deanna asked, obviously getting annoyed at the lack of an answer Cassie gave her.
"Alright, next question!" Dean reached across the table and picked up the next card. "What are you scared may happen in the near or far off future?" Dean read.
Dean blushed, but he didn't look away from Cas. "I didn't sleep with him for the same reason you didn't sleep with Jensen. I didn't sleep with the other Castiel because he wasn't you, Cas. And I wasn't going to get myself off with just a copy when all I really want is the real thing. Plus, I -" Dean started to say but was quickly stopped when Cas practically jumped him and pressed their lips together.
Castiel just gave a small smile in response, trying to hide his true feelings. He knew he would not be leaving with Dean, but Dean didn't need to know that yet. They both got up out of their chairs and walked over to room 5.
Thank goodness for the fact that using the bathroom wasn't required here, or else Dean would probably have to pee in a jar or some shit by now. Chamuel might be a dick, but she had considered things that Dean wouldn't ever think about. For example, showers, he took them when he had the time, but sometimes there was no time for it. And usually, when that happened, Sam would have to force him into the bathroom.
"Oh shut up! I'm just having a good morning, that's all." Dean picked up the two plates of bacon and scrambled eggs he made from and placed one on each side of the table. "Disgusting veggie bacon for you! And delicious meaty bacon for me. Bon appetite!" He exclaimed, taking his seat across from Sam.
He wasn't technically lying, though, when he told Castiel to let him think. Dean knew that his wording wasn't specific enough to be a lie. It seemed that after four rounds of this truthful torture that Dean was finally growing accustomed to the truth spell. Cas, on the other hand, wasn't at all used to the truth spell on him.
The final element of sarcasm, however, was by far Castiel's favorite. Dean seemed to be an expert at using sarcasm as some sort of flirtation device. Cas had seen Dean attempt this with dozens of women throughout the years. Seeing Dean flirt with anyone had always made Castiel feel uncomfortable but flirting seemed to be a part of Dean's nature. It was his go-to move when he found a woman attractive. Cas enjoyed being around Dean, so for years, he put his unease aside whenever Dean would flirt with someone, whether it be at a bar or on a case. To try and preoccupy his mind with uncertain jealousy, Cas would instead focus on Deans' mannerisms, which was how he had picked up on the uses of sarcasm in the first place. It all made sense to him: Dean would only use joke sarcasm with people he trusted, so if he wanted to intimate with someone or 'get lucky' as he would probably refer to it, Dean would probably use a similar type of strategy. Castiel understood that most of the time, Dean used sarcasm towards him; it was probably humorous. But that didn't stop him from hoping deep down that maybe, just maybe, Dean was using sarcasm to converse with him as he did with those women at the bar.
Dean hated that the voice was right. Dean currently only had two options: he could man up and play the game, or he could do nothing and just be stuck in this cave with Castiel forever. Even though the second option sounded better by the second, he knew he couldn't just avoid the topic forever. He had to play to win back his freedom.
"He thought I would need help running this place which is probably true, and since he and Jess and their two kids live about an hour south of here, Sam decided to take matters into his own hands by signing you up for the job without even consulting you." Dean smirked like he was proud of his brother somehow for being so sneaky in his imaginary setting.
"Well, now that you know my choice, am I free to go? I'm sure I will be forced back into your office to get my assignments soon enough. And the faster I can complete this next round, the sooner Dean will be free of this program."
"Well, it looks like after tonight, we only have one round left to go? You think you can handle it?" Dean smirked, looking directly at Castiel.
Dean tried, but he was still drawing a blank. "Hell, I don't know, some angel who found that hottest vessel on planet earth that just happens to be into wearing the same uniform as a catholic school girl?"
Tonight the two of them would permanently break out of the friendzone that they had lived inside for far too long, and finally, they would show each other how they truly felt towards one another.
Castiel was use to Dean treating him like a scapegoat, but it never went on for this long. It was typical of Dean to avoid any genuine emotions, making it easier for him to project his frustration onto others. Castiel wanted nothing more than to solve his issues with Dean, but he didn't have any hope of that happening before. Being stuck with the hunter in this strange cave gave him hope. Before he had left the bunker, Castiel's original hope had started to die out the longer Dean blamed him. This cave or whatever it was could be their chance to resolve their conflict and Castiel was grateful to have a second chance to fix his relations with Dean.
"No, that's not what I said. I am a powerful being Dean, and I existed before this earth was created. I was there when history was made, and physics was discovered. My I.Q. is perfect, not that I have ever been tested, nor do I find the need to be tested. My point is, opening an umbrella indoors is useless, and I would never do something so stupid." The angel seemed somewhat annoyed, if not slightly angered by Dean's response.
"What are you doing here, Gabriel?" Castiel glared, still standing in the same place but now he had moved his head to look at his archangel of a brother.
"Just the order of things. No big deal. You will start with room 5, and then you both will be let back out here to answer your remaining prompts."
"SAMMY! Don't you dare try to change the subject on me right now. DID YOU, or DID YOU NOT get me into this fucking situation?" Dean asked, now seething with anger.
Dean blinked a few times, forcing himself back to reality. "Huh?? What? I must've just zoned out for a second."
"I can't get rid of the spell. As O'Malley said, it would only lose its effect when you leave this program. But I can use some of my own power to disengage the effects for a period of time throughout each level."
"Yep, Gertie Dean Fitzgerald. And I swear on my life that if Gertie was born a boy instead, then her first and middle name would have been switched. I'm sorry I should have told you sooner. I never meant to make you feel unworthy, when in fact, you have always been the hunter I looked up to since the day we met. Well, you and Bobby, of course."
Dean started to feel hopeful, which wasn't a feeling he experienced often. Anytime he let himself hope, he was only met with disappointment in the past. He already ever let himself think that something good might happen to him because if he did, he might just end up even more disappointed.
Then the silence was broken by the sound of wings fluttering. Dean knew that the sound didn't come from Cas' wings, though, since he was still refusing to move as not to poke the bear. Cas was acting like Dean was a T-Rex who could only see movement.
"Well, if the world was ending sometime next week, the first thing I would do is get you and me the fuck out of this Chuck forsaken cave. Then once we finally see the light of day again, we would walk to the closest road and hitchhike to the nearest bar where I would have multiple stiff drinks during which I am sure you would lecture me on how bad drinking is for my liver or something. After I finish my drinks and you stop your lecture, I would use the payphone, which is inevitably in the back of the bar, to phone Sammy and get him to pick us up from who knows where, but the moment I see his stupid face I would punch him square in the jaw since he is why we are in us this whole cave game show mess. Then, of course, I would treat any superficial wounds that I wreaked upon Sammy's dumb mug because, you know, he is still my baby brother, and I care about him deep deep deep deep down or something. After we got all his superficial injuries bandaged up, Sam would probably want us to talk about our feelings since he is a big lug and, therefore, into all the touchy-feely shit. But the moment that stops, the three of us would hop into baby and drive straight down to Texas."
"Correctamundo, my name is Rachiel, but just call me Rachel (it makes it easier for autocorrect lol)!"
Dean couldn't help but count out loud, probably a side effect of the honesty. "So technically, my first kiss was in preschool with a girl named Cassie, then in middle school, there was Denise, Rose, and Rachel! High school... oh gosh, there was Grace she was a total babe, Tyra who had the softest lips in Illinois, then there was Annie, Anna, Ani with an 'i', Bailey, Constance, Brooke, or I think her name was Brooke I don't know... Margo, Taylor, Amelia, Danni, Bethany, another Brooke, Rebecca, Julia, Vivian, and..."
Dean unconsciously decided to use one of his defense mechanisms so that he didn't have to respond directly. He was extremely thankful that Chamuel had somehow limited his honesty spell because that meant he could be as indirect as he wanted in any room except the center one.
"Well, if you read Genesis, you would know that Chuck created the earth in less than seven days, so time was kind of of the essence."
"I'm going to use my jacket as a bridge. It won't put out the whole ring of fire, but it should give you enough time to get out of the circle... Hopefully... Well maybe. We will see how it goes."
Dean stormed into the bedroom, absolutely enraged. What the hell even was this game anyway? What exactly were Rachel or Chamuel or any of the other freaking angels trying to accomplish here? Dean and Castiel had already solved their feud, which should have meant that he was a free man now.... but
Why would Chamuel do this to him? Make him see Dean get married? Make him reunite with people he never thought he would see again?  It was all an awful lot to process.
"Cas... Me and Sam, we both forgave you long ago. Did you fuck up? Yeah! But then again, so have all of us at one point or another. You may not remember, but not that long ago, I also teamed up with Crowley, but instead of unlocking the souls from Purgatory, Crowley and I went on a murder spree to sustain the mark of Cain. As for Sam, he isn't all that innocent either. When you first met the giant, he was addicted to drinking demon blood and getting his jollies on with a demon named Ruby. Any of this ring a bell?"
"Because if you did give a rats ass about me, then why did you name your sons Sam and Cas? Huh? You met me first, Garth. And what, you met Castiel maybe two times at most? My brother was worth naming your son after. Cas was worth naming your son after. I wasn't worth it... Not that I can blame you, though. I mean, Cas didn't think I was worth it either... That's why he never came back... why he never came home. So please don't pretend like you guys care, I don't need any of your pity, and you all have your own lives to lead... I'm my own problem." Dean looked down and hoped that all three of them would be long gone whenever he looked up.
"Okay... Okay..." Dean relented. "My name is Dean… Dean Winchester and the guy you hog-tied to the chair over there is my little brother Sammy. We're hunters."
While Jared was over at the bar, two men came up to Jensen and Cas.  And Cas immediately recognized both of them.
"I'm glad you are amused with your alternate self!" Castiel replied sarcastically, still not looking directly at Dean.
Instead of helping set up, Dean chilled by the entryway and awaited the arriving guest. Sam, Jess, and their baby girl were the first to arrive. Dean's eyes filled up with tears at the sight of Jess alive and holding her and Sam's 4-month-old daughter. The little one was dressed in a frilly pink dress and had bright green eyes. She was still pretty much completely bald but as cute as can be.
Castiel shifted his gaze to the floor of the cave. "It's... it's not that simple, Dean." He muttered back in response.
Keeping busy was the only thing to keep him distracted, and Dean pushed himself to have that type of constant pain relief.
"I don't know, man... the end of being alone, I guess. Finding the person you're stuck with for the rest of your life. Or better yet, the person you want to spend the rest of your life with."
"Look at me, please." Dean requested. Castiel opened his eyes, and Dean brought up his free hand to hold cup Castiel's cheek. "We are going to take this one step at a time, okay? You're fucking right. This is new for both of us. But right now, I want to show you how I feel about you in the one way I know how. There's no rush now; you're home Cas. You're with me, and you're home!"
"Alright, then I will state it to you more clearly - Castiel caves like this take time to form. This program and this cave are intended to help people achieve happiness by reaching their relationships' highest potentials. So... if this program works as it is intended... you may possibly reach that level of happiness before departing this program... I cannot willfully put you in danger, and if you finish this program, you could be put into a dangerous situation. So as you can see now... I cannot let you leave this cave."  Chamuel explained, folding her hands on top of her desk. "If I had known of this deal beforehand, I would have never agreed to take on you and Dean's case."
"I guess, how firm it is, the shape, the way it bounces when they walk, the everything... let's just move on, okay."
"Of course, it isn't what I expect because I have no idea what to expect. And you won't tell me what the hell is going on."
"Well, you better learn how to do so because once again, you don't have another choice. Don't worry. I will check in every so often to see how you both have progressed."
"I'm not worried about it being able to reach me. I could care less if it could or couldn't. The fact is you gave me an ultimatum, and I picked the option that keeps the Winchesters safe. Also, as you are well aware, the Empty only wants me when I reach a level of true happiness. I doubt that will ever occur if I am stuck in here for eternity, so it won't care if it can't reach me just yet."
Dean cautiously made his way down the hallway with his gun at the ready when he heard the distinct sound of the fridge door closing.
"So Chamuel..." Dean spoke upwards again, "Care to explain to me why the hell Castiel suddenly became part flappy bird?"
Dean averted his eyes from Castiel's stare and looked down towards the ring of fire that Castiel was still standing in.
"You will be free just as soon as I go over the results." Rachel replied. She was seated in a chair in the corner. Rachel folded her arms and crossed her legs as she smirked throughout her reply.
Not once since the day he went out drinking with Castiel has he touched alcohol, nor wanted to. He's opening to his friends more, who are always there to lend a hand, helping him to feel like part of a family again. Looking around the room, like every other place in the house, Dean thinks of Castiel.
"…Gabe left a note saying he took Sammy out…" Dean explains, "I should have never let them get close, of all the people Sammy could befriend he has to be the worst!"
"There is no tree branch in my rectum, Dean, do not be crass." Castiel gawks in disgust. "Some of the things you say are abominable, it makes me wonder about you humans."
On the car ride to Benny's house, Castiel grows bored. Cars are truly a painful thing with their slow pace. He begins to wonder bout different things. Mostly Benny. The man was granted life because he fell in love with a human, but for both of their species it is unlawful to fall for humans. How is that someone's saving grace?
"That's true, sex is not always love." Castiel agrees and Dean looks to him curiously. Maybe they could- "We're not having sex." The angel says before Dean can even legitimately think it. "Sex when emotions that cannot be returned are involved is a mess."
"I have heard, and witnessed, the things you did before 'love'. Forgive me if I do not trust the love you bare for a human being strong enough to negate all of that."
Castiel refused to give up his grace for them. Not that Dean asked, but he made it very clear it was not going to happen.
"Kevin!" Sam giggles, jumping off the couch and running over to drag him inside. "This is Kevin, Castiel!"
Castiel simply fights the urge to roll his eyes at the man's logic and gives him a curt nod. For the next three hours Castiel watches as Dean has drink after drink and orders them the wonderfully healthy dinner of wings and fries. As if on cue, once the man is fully drunk, Sam calls him.
"What the hell was that?" Dean groans when they finally get out, catching their breath in the alley. "Just what did you do to that poor girl?"
"What are you-? Jesus Christ, it's like trying to wrangle in a group of toddlers." Dean groans, looking to Benny and Castiel, "You guys are aware that Sammy is the only one who is actually a child, right?"
Even with Gabriel coming around as much as possible, Dean would never change a thing. Except maybe that time Gabriel decided to scare the shit out of one of Sam's professors with a sewer gator when he was mean to the boy. That was a bit of overkill.
Castiel reaches out and pets Sam's hair, "Wings are a heavenly attribute, and they are pleasing to all of the senses. For both our sake, and human's sakes."
"Alright, idjits, get back to work. Dean, get yourself a good jack, and Castiel stay next to him in case something else happens." Bobby groans before heading back to his own spot.
Dean rolls his eyes, "So if it weren't for that spell you would have destroyed my damned house upon entering?"
"So, remind me to never let Sam touch an angel's wings again." Dean jokes and Castiel rolls his eyes.
"He only calls those he loves little shits." Sam says, quickly earning a disapproving look from both Castiel and Dean.
Castiel looks at him confused for a moment, unsure of how a human can actually stab an angel with no problem. He stares into the frightened green eyes looking down at him and wraps a hand around the one Dean is holding the knife with to move it from his chest, "Hello, Dean."
"No one is in trouble," Castiel finally says as he looks at Sam still on the floor, "But we gave Benny a specific time and you must always keep your word. Roughhousing can be done when we have nowhere to be."
"Need some help?" A voice calls and Castiel turns to see a beautiful woman with long brown hair. "You look a little lost."
"I told you he liked brunettes!" Sam exclaims, excitement all over his face. "You two should kiss! And get married! We watched a movie last night where two men got married! You should get married so Castiel can stay forever!" He rambles on, practically bouncing in his seat, and Castiel feels guilty. It's a nice thought, to be with them forever, but it's simply not plausible.
Castiel glances at the note on the table that Gabriel wrote, "I will not leave until they return, and from the looks of it we have a few hours until they do…"He mumbles, looking to Dean.
"I very well can, Dean, there is no need for me to ever have sex. I cannot have children and I cannot fall in love and stay with any humans." Castiel points out, his facts being ignored by the man as he calls a beautiful woman with long blonde hair over to them.
"You think so?" Kevin smiles at him as he pours sauce into the skillet, "Because I think this is the most at peace Dean has been since his parents died. Granted, he's not running around laughing and joking as much as usual, but he's always been relatively gruff and rude. This is the first time he has trusted Sammy to anyone other than me or Jo…or Charlie that one time."
"Shut your damn mouth!" Dean turns and punches him again, making the angel lose it. Castiel grabs the coat Dean is wearing and easily slams him up against the adjacent wall, making sure to be gentle about it so he doesn't kill him.
When they get to the car, what Dean thinks is out of earshot from his friend, he speaks up. "So what the hell was that all about? Backing him up against a table and then him spewing some line right out of a chick flick?"
The angel gasps, "That is not funny, either, Dean!" He looks to Sam to back him up, but the child is laying on the floor giggling, so instead he decides to just chase down Dean. "You are a very good man, Dean! You're not going to-!" Castiel goes quiet when he sees Dean leaning against the counter with the phone, his pointer finger against his lips to signal silence.
"I understand…" Dean sighs, scratching the back of his head. "I suppose it's not exactly unexpected…"
Castiel pauses, halfway through helping Sam out of his shirt, and stares at the water, "Your faucets make no sense to me." He admits and Kevin laughs a little.
"Yep, well you're going there." Dean says, clicking a button and bringing the phone to his ear. "I have to have out with your weirdo, you can hang out with mine."
"Certainly better than my first." Castiel agrees, making the boy laugh. They spend the rest of dinner discussing different things, like Sam's daycare, Castiel's time in heaven, and Dean's friends. It is a nice time, something Castiel will miss when Dean ends up with Lisa, but that is his job. He will simply watch them from heaven after this. It's not the same, but it will do.
"It's not for you. You're here for me, remember?" Dean reminds him, finally getting him inside and sitting him at a booth that Castiel is fairly certain should be burned at least ten times to be anywhere near sanitation code.
"I'm actually awake." Sam whispers into Castiel's feathers before smiling over at him. "But I don't want to get up."
"Who wants to be human when they can be angels? Castiel used to be so powerful and indifferent. He was the embodiment of a warrior. Magnificent, really." Gabriel boasts. "Why would he want to go from that to being a mild mannered little human?"
"Mm," Castiel agrees, "But Dean is a truly good person. One cannot help but be charmed by his awkward ways."
"Female brunettes, Cas! Female!" Dean yells after him, and Castiel finally understands the enjoyment his brother receives from doing such things.
Dean stares at him for a minute before all attempts to hide his smile shatter and he bursts out laughing, having to rest his forehead on Castiel's shoulder. "Oh my fucking god, Cas, you can't be real!"
"This is the last place my family went together before my parents died." He explains. "It's a place I hold dear…" There is a lull in the conversation until Castiel finally speaks up.
Lisa giggles, "Ohhh, so it's like that. How sweet, I'm sure with a boyfriend as cute as you this Dean is happy."
"I am not sick, Dean, thank you for your concern." Castiel says, his eyes going down to his pocket. Now is the time to give it to him. Or he could ignore it and just get rid of it another time.
The boy laughs a little, "Dean's orders? Well, don't worry about it, he told me to check on you two." He peaks his head past the door and waves to Sam. "Hey Sammy!"
"You're a virgin," Dean says, in awe. "I mean, you have the body of someone young…but I assumed a warrior angel had to have gotten laid in the past."
"Alright, if you are going to be staying here…" Dean eyes Gabriel angrily, "Indefinitely, you'll need to sleep on the couch with Cas."
"I cannot cook," Castiel admits, "And Dean forbade us from using the stove…or oven…or toaster…or microwave."
"Mm…" Dean mumbles, wrapping his arms around Castiel's neck and pulling him down. With his face now in the crook of Dean's neck, he hears the man take a deep breath against his hair. "You smell nice." He points out before rubbing his face into the hair, "Your hair is soft, too."
Castiel sits beside Dean in the car, a motorized vehicle people use to get around faster than by foot. For them it is a impressive speed, but to Castiel it is slow and torturous. He can firmly say he does not like this mode of transportation one bit. It is relaxing, in a way, but only for a moment or so and then it becomes tedious. There are things to do and this car is slowing them down.
"You seem pretty into touching someone who isn't cute." Castiel observes as he writhes under Dean. The two of them continue touching and kissing, Dean making sure to leave as many marks as possible on Castiel and vice versa, until finally the experienced man pulls out a little bottle from his drawer.
A strange smile comes to Dean's face, as if he is trying to force it down, when he wraps an arm around Castiel's shoulders. "Well, most men simply give a woman a monetary tip when they enjoy a lap dance."
Castiel shoots Dean a helpless look before he's dragged off to another room with the woman. He wants to escape but instead he is seated in a rather comfortable chair after the door is closed. Slow music he is assuming is meant to be sensual is playing in the room and before he can request a change of songs the woman is slowly dancing towards him.
"You are clearly uncomfortable with something, though, and I do not want you to have to suffer it for long. It is the idea of Gabriel watching Sam, isn't it?" Castiel asks, "Because that makes me uncomfortable as well."
"I only look a year younger than you, Dean." Castiel reminds him. "Your date is at five, so hurry up and get ready."
Last, but not least, is warrior angels. They have spent their lives devoted to god and his orders, fighting and killing without mercy or a second thought. Now, however, they are stuck taking care of human's pleas. They watch them, help them, but all within reason for their father does not want to interrupt in human's free will. Most warrior angels have adapted quite well to this new job, helping people wonderfully.
"Hello boys," She says, her green eyes landing on Castiel with a seductive smile. "What can I help you with?"
"I am far older than twenty." Castiel says, "My appearance has been that of a twenty year old for centuries."
"He had my back in fights with assholes from school. Benny is a good guy. Besides, you like his girlfriend, don't you?" Dean asks and Sam pauses.
"I'm going to bed now, so goodnight!" Sam says from the other line, his voice trying to hide disappointment over something Castiel can't place. However, he is already planning out ways to enact revenge if it is something Benny has done. Better to be prepared.
"A-amazing," Castiel admits, breathless as Dean continues thrusting into him and raking his fingers through the black feathers. He then lets out a loud moan when Dean's fingers reach past the feathers and to his wings' skin. Castiel gasps, thrusting his hips up faster and writhing underneath Dean.
"Yes you would." Gabriel grins, "You covet my brother as a king covets land. I can't blame you, he is quite the cutie. That tousled hair, those pouty lips, and that way he tilts his head to the side like a confused little kitten when he doesn't get something."
"I got to stay. A woman was my saving grace that allowed me to stay." Benny explains, struggling to escape Castiel's tight grip. The angel would be lying if he said he wasn't excited to finally be fighting something again.
Castiel looks around, an exasperated look on his face, "If you let me fly us there we would arrive in less than a second."
"Both of you shut up right now or I am turning this car around and we are spending the day with Benny." Dean threatens, making Sam and Castiel gasp in unison before going completely silent. Doesn't stop Sam from glaring, though.
"As a new couple on our first date, we must make dinner together." The boy says, heading into the kitchen with Castiel following.
Castiel panics and quickly moves forward, taking a bite. As soon as he does his eyes widen more, watching Dean's cocky smirk while he enjoys the strange taste. It's soft and sweet and amazing. Once he swallows it he licks his lips, tasting the syrup still on it. "This is good."
"He asked." Castiel explains, "You should always answer when asked a question. That is just good manners."
"It's not for fights, it's for fun! Come inside, come inside!" He says, ushering him into the fort where they are quickly met with Dean who pointedly sits between them.
"Yeah, yeah, the almighty angel doesn't do what he doesn't want to." Dean mocks before letting go of his face and placing his hands on Castiel's wings, stretching them through the feathers as the angel squirms underneath him. "Does that really feel so good?"
Castiel, however, is not most angels. He was excellent in the battlefield, a true warrior who followed his father's rules exactly. Now that he is in charge of people's happiness, however, he is slipping. Because of this Gabriel, the archangel he is under, does not give him many wishes to help with. In fact, he has made it a point to give Castiel the 'bad' people, because he knows it will go wrong. He loves Gabriel, and he knows Gabriel does it for his own benefit. Those wishes are regarded as optional so whether done correctly or not it doesn't matter to anyone.
"But Dean, Kevin is in advanced placement." Castiel points out, "Surely that means he is intelligent beyond his age in all things."
"That is correct, but if you want to keep me a secret, coming into work the day after being crushed by a car would not be the best way to go about it." Castiel mumbles, now watching Dean's body beneath the car. He is fit, and would probably have made an excellent warrior had he been an angel. His determination and self-sacrificing ways would prove quite useful on a battlefield. Of course he should not look at Dean in such a way, he is a normal human being, not a warrior. The days of war are over and Castiel must adjust to this fact.
