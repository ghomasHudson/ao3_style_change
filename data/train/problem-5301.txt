“I didn’t… she said…” that she just wanted to look at the royal seal. That she wasn’t going to do anything with it, she was just curious. That she loved Tony. That she always wanted to be with him.
Steve dragged him over to the doors, where one good kick from the eminent soldier was all it took to open the doors. Tony, for the first time in a long time, felt his face spread into a grin, and he and Steve smiled at each other. The world was beautiful.
After that, it was over quickly. Thor destroyed the door with a swing of his mighty hammer. Jan was there as well, and she called some SHIELD medics over to take a look at Tony, and then they were all whisked away to the Triskelion for a debrief.
“Tony?” He turned and saw Tony’s body, still in its armor, lying prone on the floor. Steve’s blood turned to ice. “Tony!”
“How could you say that?” the man whispered. He was stroking Tony’s hair, and holding him carefully, like he fucking cared, and Tony had no idea what to do.
Tony payed him no heed. What would be the point in him running away, anyway? No, instead he lunged for the knife in his captor’s holster and pulled it out. He had one last trick up his sleeve. He began to chant.
“Excuse me,” he murmured, and beat a hasty retreat. Obie seemed to say something to him, but Tony paid no heed.
Obie came over and put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony thought maybe he would say some encouraging words, but instead, Obie said, “The truth is you’re a failure. I had thought that you would grow out of this nonsense, but you seem to have only gotten more naive with age. You trust too blindly, and you simply have no natural ability for leading. You’re a horrible prince, and frankly, I don’t know what to do with you.”
Tony slipped, and nearly met a painful fate on the hard ground of the bridge, when suddenly there were arms around his waist and his decent halted. Tony looked down, and was suddenly very close to a pair of dazzling blue eyes and high cheekbones. Tony lost his breath, and he couldn’t seem to get it again.
Tony hummed, and it sounded relieved to Steve, or maybe he was just projecting. Making sure to stay in Tony’s line of vision the whole way, he went over to the door.
The King scoffed, and slammed his hand on the desk. Tony jumped. “The seal is gone. Zip. Nada. We checked the security cameras over and over, and the last time anyone had seen it was you and your little squeeze.”
Steve frowned, but didn’t say anything. He couldn’t get the idea out of his head. Still, Tony had a point. Just because they could make horrible monsters, didn’t mean they were competent.
Steve wrote down that he did “everything in his power keep Tony calm until the medics arrived.” He didn’t think the debrief needed any more information than that.
Tony tried to take comfort in the little talisman he had kept from Steve, but looking at it now, it was just a feather. Could he have made the whole thing up? Was it possible it had all just been a delusion?
Tony left his room and went to the balcony. He was hoping that maybe the fresh air would help him clear his head. He didn’t know what was wrong with him, but there was something, he was sure of it. What else would cause him to mess up so completely that not only would his girlfriend dump him, but he would also lose the royal seal to her in the process? And if so, how could he fix it? He didn’t know. He wasn’t thinking objectively, he knew; his father’s arguments were lodged in his chest, making it difficult to breath and leaching the logic from his thought process. All he wanted to do was lie down and give up, but he had to try, right? Just one more try to fix himself.
He pet DUM-E when they weren’t looking, and whispered instructions to him when they weren’t in earshot. He laughed at how his ‘dumb, useless AI’ kept bringing him random junk, like remote controls or little clocks, instead of handing him his coffee or cleaning up. The nurses laughed along. A harmless distraction, he could imagine them saying. He kept it up.
attempt? That was horrifying. Unease settled over Steve like a blanket. He wanted to do something. He wanted to punch something.
“Wow,” Tony muttered sarcastically, “they really aren’t that bright. Some guy got a hold of a real life magical book of, like, the magical equivalent of genetics or something, and he and his friends decided to play around. That cat-praying mantis thing we fought the first time? Was something like their hundredth experiment. They’re not too good at this.”
When Tony stepped into the ball, he found himself in his element. He shook hands with the women present, making the ladies blush and flutter their eyelashes, and he charmed the adults into thinking that each and every one of them was special and necessary to the events of the day, even though they weren’t. He sipped champagne, nibbled on hors d’oeuvre, and flashed his eyes at everyone to catch his attention. The women all fought for a chance to have his sparkling blue gaze shine on them. If anyone had believed the rumors that the prince of America was despondent, those rumors were purged entirely from their minds. The image of the charming, carefree prince was revived in their minds once more, and everyone walked a little easier.
It was a far cry better than anything else he got up to in this room of limbo. Doctors talked at him, nurses tended to him, but nothing really changed. He had stopped trying to tell them about Steve, the imprisoned man who was enchanted. He had stopped trying to say anything at all.
“The dreams,” Tony said dazedly. He thought about what he had read about magic over the years. It was highly unlikely, of course, but if it was a powerful magician like Rothbart… then yeah, theoretically, everything Steve was saying was possible.
“I will! But you have to believe me, love, I can’t tell you here. Please,” she pulled on his arm, “just come with me, we’ll go somewhere private so no one will bother us, and I’ll tell you everything.”
Finally, Tony slid his eyes back up to Steve. His eyes were wide and terrified, and his breathing was quickening, but that was it. Oh, God, had he been immobilized? That had happened before; one of the monsters had stabbed Pietro and a few civilians. It didn’t have any lasting effect, but whoever was affected were immobilized for a few hours.
He was the most beautiful man Tony had ever seen: blue eyes that made Tony feel like he was sinking into them, golden hair, chiseled jaw, and the strong build of a fighter. If Tony was gaping a bit, he felt he could be excused.
His father came frequently. He never seemed to know what to say. He had started out with his usual spiel of Stark men and iron, but when Tony didn’t say a word, he changed. Day after day, Tony noticed that his father was changing his tactics, being kinder. He was sometimes wedeling, other times bargaining. One time he got so desperate, he actually begged Tony to talk to him. Tony had never in his life seen his father beg, not to anyone. It had moved something in Tony, but still, he hadn’t said a word. That was when Howard lost his patience completely, and left.
“—and I know that Rothbart has to be someone who came into the castle recently, who managed to get quite close to the King…” Tony paused.
Tony gathered his stolen supplies and set them up around his spacious, sharp-implement free room and set to work. He drew the diagrams, winded his clockwork instruments, and checked his coding one last time. As a last resort, he put the picture of Maria Stark on top of his diagram. Couldn’t hurt. Either Maria would pray for him, or maybe the magic would accept his offering. As it was, it was the final piece of his bridge he had left to burn.
Steve seemed to gather himself, and said, “When I figured out that the hair was yours, I thought that Rothbart was probably planning something, something bad. What else would he do with a lock of the crown prince’s hair? I think Rothbart is trying to take over the throne. He’s infiltrated the castle, somehow. We’ve heard him talking about going to the castle, and how no one suspects a thing. He’s been earning the King’s trust all this time, and on the night of the ball, he’s going to cast a spell that will put him in power, somehow. I don’t know the specifics of the spell, but it’s only going to work then because it’s the night of the Winter solstice. At the strike of midnight, he’ll unleash his trap. You must stop him before he does that. He’s such an old, powerful magician, though, so it won’t be easy. He can shapeshift, so he can hide in any shape he wants. I don’t know what shape he takes when going to the castle, unfortunately. You’ll have to look for anyone who has only recently joined the castle, no more than a year. Good luck, and… be careful.”
He could practically feel Pepper’s excitement vibrating through the car’s speakers. “Tony, I swear. If you waited until now to tell me I’m getting a newly stocked closet I am going to have a lot of explaining to do when I bring my things over to Steve’s.” He laughed, still noticing that the name no longer affected him as much as it used to.
There’s more to this. There has to be more to this. Pepper takes his hand and smiles to reassure him. The tightness in his throat diminishes, “and for the earlier part of this year I was in a rehabilitation center that focuses on mental health.”
Steve manages a shy laugh. “Yeah. I saw the press conference. Wanted to talk to you about future tabloid covers. Don’t want to give Bucky the wrong impression, you know?.”
He felt his chest tighten and his lungs constrict. This was not planned either. “I should go.” He pushed past him in a hurry. “Tony, wait!”
He laughs when the statement sinks in. “Well then fuck yeah, let’s do it.” Jarvis nods before tossing him his phone with Banner’s number already dialed.
They’ve had a full day to prep, he’s had a full day to let the gravity of the situation settle into his bones. If his anxiety at the sheer volume of reporters that found their way to see him were radioactive, his chest would be glowing through his suit. It’s something that needs to be done though.
“I hoped that you would listen. Bucky, wasn’t excited to see the last cover and I am inclined to do something about it. That doesn’t mean I don’t want you in my life again, Tony.”
“Tony, given all that you have been through, what do you think it means that hiding is no longer your first instinct?”
The red head crossed her arms and looks at her in a way that tells you she’s considering it. “You want me to be your plant?” It almost doesn’t sound like a question, the way it comes out her mouth so matter of fact.
“I ran into him today.” He could barely make out the sharp intake of breath on the other end. “I am okay, Pep. Nothing bad happened. A hello and a goodbye. He mentioned you were coming back in June to stay with him and Bucky.” She scoffed.
He’s brought out of his thoughts by Pepper’s content sigh. “Tony finally made it back into his own corner and it doesn’t look like he’ll be leaving any time soon.” Her smile is contagious even from across the room. “That’s something worth drinking to.”
He fights the urge to gawk. “You’ve always known that.” He shakes his head to stave off his growing frustration at the mess his feelings are making his thought process. “And, again, you invited me. So, please, explain how exposing yourself to my public persona is preventing misunderstandings in your relationship.”
“We would like to offer you a position on the Award’s Committee.” Bruce blinked in a way that somehow told you he was touched. Once again, the only sign of any emotion was that small smile. “I would be honored.”
It was too late though. All he could do now was breathe and acknowledge that leaving at all, once he felt uncomfortable, was a win in and of itself.
Getting up makes his head swim further. The last time Steve had texted him…he doesn’t even remember and now…
Tony couldn’t help but smile at that. Leave it to Jarvis to know what to say and to say it so adequately. “I’m glad to have you around you know. I should be going though.” In understanding Jarvis removed his hand and gave the other man a brief salute before heading in the opposite direction.
There’s a double sided nature to this question – they want him to mention the man in the photograph. They want to know about Steve. They already know about Steve. “Speculations have been made about my absence from the public eye. I am here to set the story straight.”
“Yeah, come June she’ll stay with me and Buck until she finds her own space.” Tony tensed again as Steve was temporarily silenced by his own slip up. “She asked about you the last time she called actually.”
He nodded, “Pep, it’s okay. You assist. That does not mean you are required to babysit me. Besides, what if I want to surprise you with my final purchases?” She stops fussing with his outer layer of clothing and looks into his eyes.
“I ran into Steve a few days ago. He mentioned someone. And I invited Pepper to come work for me.” The scratch of pen on paper filled the silence for a few seconds as notes were quickly jotted down. “You seem to be handling the interaction well. Is there anything specific you’d like to go over? Jarvis mentioned you were able to successfully use the exercises we went over last month.”
He finds Nat’s eyes glittering with mischief as she stands. “I hate to burst The Bugle’s bubble, but Steve Rogers has been irrelevant since we first noticed Stark had gone MIA without him.” The first reporter flushes as others around her nod in agreement. Nat continues, “Mr. Stark, we know that you have been removed from both the public and your business for a little under half a year. The first headline since your return alludes that you are the same person you have always been.”
Tony felt tears threatening to spill but cleared his throat and shifted again. “I miss her.” He couldn’t look at Dr. Banner. They both knew that, even though to anyone else it sounded like he was avoiding the question, he was about to make a breakthrough.
calling to ask if you were still a size 11 because I had a sneak peak at Christian’s new collection and thought you might want to pick out a welcome home gift.”
Steve sighed contently as they made their way to the gallery’s exit. “This was nice.” Tony nodded. “I kind of missed this.”
“I know that the old man had his own way of showing he loved me but it never really worked for me…mom…she always knew. Pepper and Jarvis knew and they still know…I can’t hide when I’m with them and I think accepting that has made it easy to forget trying at all.”
Tony could have sent someone to pick Pepper up. Despite her threat of retaliation, Jarvis could have come in his place and gave his usual excuses. The only problem was that he no longer had any usual excuses.
If he were in the room Tony would point out that she’s holding back. A very specific glint in her eye giving it away. “He still asks about him, doesn’t he.” Even Jarvis knows her tells it seems.
After jerking his arm away from the other man he briskly walked away from what he had originally hoped would be a nice experience. In his head was a constant dream of should have’s he was struggling to ignore. I should have let Pepper stay. I should have said no to the tour. I should have left as soon as I saw him.
“Yes. They were helpful.” He turned his head slightly at the sound of a chuckle. “Whether you think they were or not, you made contact and didn’t even once think about drinking or putting on the persona you used to hide behind, correct?” He closed his eyes and nodded. A weak attempt to hide the shame he felt for having turned to those things in the past at all.
With the brisk wind picking up and the sky taking on a gray cast there could not possibly be a better day to drink obscenely strong coffee. “If you are so desperate for a caffeine kick you could’ve had tea this morning you know.”
He feels his mind shutting down but is brought back by both Jarvis and Pepper stepping closer to him on the stage. No matter what comes out of his mouth, they will continue to stand by him. It’s the boost he needs. “I am Anthony Stark: genius, billionaire, former playboy, philanthropist…” The words get stuck.
Through the ringing in his ears he hears Pepper and Jarvis doing their absolute best to speak in hushed tones. It doesn’t matter to him whether they’re yelling or now using sign language. He just wants the tightness in his chest to go away.
It appeases their guest enough to get her comfortable. “I want access.” It’s his turn to sweeten the pot. “Invitations, including plus ones, to all future Stark Industries events. No press badge needed.” She glances over in his directions, having forgotten he was there, and grins. “You’ve got yourself a deal.”
“I am going to murder him if James doesn’t beat me to it.” She’s been pacing long enough for him to easily follows her movements with his eyes. “Would it affect their relationship that much? All I’m doing is pulling away.” She stops. There are so many emotions in her eyes. He can see them so clearly now.
“Steve. Steve, wake up. Rogers!” Bucky is currently shaking Steve awake, frustration creeping in by the second. He hears the sound of Steve groaning awake.
So Steve gets up, he gets dressed, and he goes for a run. Dawn means the vibe is eerie, it’s still dark, and the sun will creep in in a bit, but for now, it’s just the street lights and the sounds of their feet on the ground, lifting and stomping. If Steve was naive, he would think that Bucky was merely trying to get exercise without having to draw attention to himself. But Steve is not none-the-wiser, it would be a mistake to think that Bucky has no ulterior motive.
“Well you’ll have to call me up and warn me if we’re going to face each other, then. I’d hate to lose against you.”
“Where’s Howard?” he knew it was unlikely, but Tony had hoped. He had hoped that for once, his so-called father would be able to set aside his pride and show up.
They exchange numbers, of course. Steve hands his phone to Tony, telling him to put in his own contacts into Steve’s phone.
“Morning sleepyhead, I got you a cappuccino on my run earlier, have at it.” Steve places the paper cup of coffee in front of Tony, the drowsy man straight up inhaling it.
Steve grabs an ice pack from the freezer, going back downstairs instantly to tend on Tony. As soon as he gets downstairs, Steve orders Tony to sit down beside him, placing the ice pack on his possibly bruised or even concussed head. “Are you sure you’re feeling okay?”
He collapses into the ground, the sound of his wails echoing through the room. How can Tony- his best friend, just die? The world took so much from him, asked so much of him, wanted and expected so much. He is-
“Go on and eat now, wouldn’t want you passing out in practice, would we?” He doesn't remember agreeing to practice today.
“Your father arranged it, actually.” well that was more than a bit strange, he didn’t even know the Rogers-Barnes wonder duo would show up in Dubai. He thought they’d have their fill, after winning in Rotterdam (Rogers) and Rio (Barnes). But then again, why else would his father be in Dubai?
“It’s fine, I’m fine.” Tony rubs his head, waving off Steve. But Steve has known Tony for quite awhile and he knows Tony as one to brush aside pain and injuries.
“There’s this house in Italy, a villa really. My mom used to take me there in the summer and we’d play piano,”
Rhodey waves at Tony after they part, getting ushered away by his team, leaving Tony alone. Tony subtly wonders whether he should take another tour around the city, go sleep, or bother one of his other friends. Maybe Natasha would like to hang out with him? It’s worth shooting a text
Jarvis knows him better than anyone in the world, so he knows clearly what the look on Tony’s face means.  “I’ll make sure we do them with as little presence of Howard as possible, don’t worry.”
They walk awkwardly in that position towards the car. “Steve, this is Peggy, my detail. And this is Jarvis, he follows me around.” Tony points to the two people standing by the car, and Steve gently waves his hand at them.
“Stupid, stupid, stupid. Damn it Tony, you’re not supposed to be here.” Rhodey almost laughs at the irony of the situation, how a few years ago he would’ve been in Tony’s position if it weren’t for Tony- and how he can’t save Tony, unlike what he did for him.
the environment is like none other. At night, the gleaming lights of the town can be seen from how low the mansion is, the structure of the town going upwards a mountain. He loves how near to the ocean the villa is, and he can’t wait to see it near the day.
So yes, Steve enjoys how Tony is basically making love with his food, he enjoys how Tony will take hurried bites and how he’d chew faster, just so he could talk about whatever thing has crossed his mind in the span of swallowing and chewing. He enjoys when Tony gets excited, and even forgets about his food for awhile. Because that is Tony Stark, bashful, and unashamed Tony Stark. And again, Steve decides. There is no place else, there is no time else, he’d rather be. And again, Steve also decides, there’s no one else he’d rather be with. No one other than a Tony Stark who’s unashamedly so Tony Stark. Nothing else in his line of sight other than Tony, Tony’s eyes, Tony’s smile. He’s in love with the man of the future, perhaps so far from his reach- but so incredibly close in retrospect. He’s in love with what tethers him to this present day. Steve Rogers is in love with Tony Stark.
“Oh wow, no need to be such a jerk about it.” Steve realizes two seconds too late that he probably shouldn’t have called a prince that straight to his face.
“He has an older brother named Arno, who’s currently serving in the british military. His dad is the king, King Howard. His mom’s Name is Maria, she was an actress and musician when she was alive, she was Italian-English which technically makes the prince a quarter italian.”
“Perhaps it was urgent, Tonio.” Maria Stark always looks for the best in everyone, even when clouded with great disappointment to her husband for not being present.
And at that moment, they step closer. It’s as if the moment has been written by the gods, with the sun setting behind them, and the waves calm on their feet. Steve steps closer, until there’s barely any room between them.
God, Steve loves this man sleeping in front of him. And love makes a fool out of even the greatest of men.
“It’s a date, then.” Tony gets called back for his on court interview. Oh well, he always loves dicking around with McEnroe on international television.
“You don’t even have to say please, shellhead,” and Tony flashes his megawatt smile as Steve readies the pancake batter.
The residence is wonderful, he admits. It’s also convenient for him. When his mom became president, it was a wonderful and glaring transition. Long before the white house was a dump apartment in brooklyn in which he called a home, and then things sky rocketed. His grandparents were Irish immigrants, fleeing the country at times of great peril, and now he’s america’s first son.
The stone doesn’t even reach his knees, but the reality of it is so much bigger. He kneels down onto the grass, plucking a few stray strands, patting the grass and lying a bouquet of flowers on the grave.
“Well I’ve never been much of an interesting chap even when you were alive, right? I suppose you’d laugh at me now. And Tony...”
Steve is greeted by Bucky opening his mouth in a talking motion. Raising one finger immediately, Steve hushes Bucky. “Shush, later.” Bucky doesn’t like that, so he bites Steve’s finger.
See, Steve, Bucky, and Natasha are dubbed the white house trio, it’s amazing PR. Together, the three of them are iconic, show-stopping, and the absolute darlings of America.
So he chases Tony, chases Tony’s laughs. He doesn’t actually run, not yet. But when he finally does, he tackles Tony into the ground, and when they’re bodies are on top of each other, everything just seemed perfect. Too perfect.
“Well how about you do your thing first, and then I’ll follow along, Mr. Stark” Tony rolls his eyes, but he stands up and steps up to the piano.
“Best italian food you’ll ever taste.” They get into the car and it drives off, Tony going what Steve guesses is probably above the speed limit.
Well, what is a white house term without a little bit of spice? And perhaps causing an international accident alongside the prince of england should break all expectations everyone has ever had on bets of his first international incident, right?
“Thanks, Stark. You’re not so bad yourself.” Tony throws his head back in laughter, no doubt the cameras catching sight of their interaction, without the words, at least.
The trophy tour is a joy. Holding it up as people cheer for him. The post-match interviews are a breeze, as it always is when you’re champion. Even the rudest won’t make comments regarding retirement. Questions revolve around his game, his next steps after the win, about his opponent. To those, he answers with the news of a vacation. Clearly he needs it. He just won a calendar grand slam, and Tony will admit to wanting to achieve the incredible feat again. But for now, he’d prefer a vacation until Shanghai knocks on his door.
And chaos reigned. Moments too late, Steve finds himself a mess. Tony is now beside him. Their suits are drenched of various toppers from foods and beverages, lines of tables decimated in their past. Worst of all, the centerpiece of the entire ceremony was found broken, lying on the floor. And Steve- well Steve is highly aware of what he’s done. But is he?
“Just imagine, I’ll take you to the louvre, you can do that geeking out thing over the art. You can go to Istanbul, visit the blue mosque. There are so many things you can do, Steve. The world is full of endless beauty and you only visit them on missions! Imagine!” And Steve thinks, he wants nothing more than to travel the world with Tony, preferably as something more than friends.
“Mama!” For a moment, he is a child again, fresh off picking apples by the hill of their home in Naples. They hug again.
Tony chuckles, imagining Steve frowning. Jarvis raises his eyebrows at him. “It’s just Steve.” Jarvis shakes his head and mutters something under his breath that’s unclear to Tony. Another message.
“Yeah?” They’re staring at each other in the eyes now, and Steve can see what must be the beginning of tears welling in Tony’s eyes, eventually one dropping down his cheeks.
“Well John you know me, I didn’t do anything special, just took a few beach vacations in the middle of the season. You know, relaxation.” he laughs and covers his mouth. “But no, I’m not sure I’d be able to top last year, it was a lot of effort. Maybe a bit too much effort, really. But yeah, a gold medal sounds nice. It would look perfect on the wall of my trophy room, don’t you think? I’ll make sure to take another AO first, though.”
“Your highness, I’m happy to be here.” Steve pulls out of the hug to Tony’s raised eyebrow. In but a second, a flung has been armed around Steve’s shoulder, the source of it no other than the guy next to him. Tony. Who happens to be, well... shorter than him.
“So you’ll fly out there, you two will have a few scheduled shoots and events where you’ll portray yourself as best friends. The royal family has agreed to host you in Kensington, and here’s the detailed schedule.” When Steve looks over his schedule, well- it doesn’t look so bad, it actually seems pleasant enough.
“What move? And please, call me Tony.” He’s so irritating. And maybe Steve has had two too many drinks.
to ask Carol out, you’re just a coward.” Rhodey inhales. And then he exhales. “And hey, if you really don’t want to do it, just make sure you win, Jim.” Not that Tony is going to make it easy for him to win. He likes how it’s laid out. If things work out, he’d have his 20th grand slam, on the second day of the second month of 2020. And that’s just plain
“Well, the Avengers are doing fine, as fine as we can be, that is. We lost so much, Tony. And I’m sorry I couldn’t... that I couldn’t prevent it. Rhodey is fine, he misses his best friend though. And that kid? The one that you picked up? Peter- Spider-Man, well he’s trying to continue your legacy, he’s a smart kid, a great kid. And knowing you, your kid?”
“Let me be, old man.” Steve puts down a plate of the food in front of him, of course with a little garden salad on the side. He sees Tony take a bite with a fork, a look of obvious contempt on his face. “So today. Best beach day out ever?”
There are two glaringly obvious things about Tony Stark, one is that Steve Rogers is in love with him. The second? Is that apparently, Tony Stark is in love with Steve Rogers
They start out their day out with lunch, as it turns out. Tony takes Steve to a seafood leaning restaurant, ordering some pan-seared fish for the two of them. And as per usual, Tony has impeccable taste in food. The fish was so good, it almost made Steve moan. But of course, Tony actually moaned.
“Let’s get this over with.” Tony looks at him, his tone full of unimportance. Great. Just when he thought it won’t be that bad of a week.
Tony excitedly swings his arm around Rhodey’s neck after his win against T’Challa in the semi-finals. After already scoring his ticket to the finals the night before, he’s excited to go against his best friend in the finals. It’s been awhile since they’ve had a grand slam duke out. People think it’s strange for them as best friends to want to go against each other, and hell, beat each other so much. But Rhodey is always in the belief that Tony needs a good ass kicking every now and then, and who better to deliver it than his own best friend?
Tony provides commentary of the show in between his bites, pointing out the inaccuracies with arthurian legend. As the episodes seem to breeze through, Tony wraps himself in the blankets Steve previously provided. And as the night drones off, he sees Tony’s eyes slowly getting more and more tired, evidently closing, his facial features start to rid of all tension, and Steve can tell how tired Tony is.
playing him today. He’s sitting in the locker room of the Rod Laver, relaxing his body and getting his warm-ups ready. Through the tournament he’s seen Rogers play and
with his father whenever. After all, there’s been many occurrences that the two Stark men needed to play a tightly knit father-son duo. In his opinion, he deserves accolades for being able to just stand being in the mere presence of his father. And hey, for the acting as a loving son part? Well he deserves
“For goodness sake Anthony, use a plate, you’d litter crumbs all over the place.” Tony rolls his eyes, but does so anyway. He cuts through his croissant and fills it with ham for Jarvis’ benefit as well.
“We’re not projected to meet, Rhodey said so.” In the past they’ve also never been projected to meet, and so far it has been true.
“May I beg to know your intent of this conversation?” The prince raises his eyebrows, taking a sip of what looks like scotch.
“I can’t STAND him,” and it’s true so far. Steve met the elusive Prince Anthony Edward Stark around four years ago. Then, he wasn’t yet FSOTUS. But that didn’t give Prince “Tony” the rights to be a jerk to him.
The east and west room face each other, a place of residence habited by the president’s children. Usually, the children of presidents who live in the white house are... well, younger than him. But Steve sits at 21 years old, a student at Georgetown, aspiring politician, and he sits on the roof access through his window. He thinks of how not many know about the place except the few people who also lived in the room where he now lives in past times.
The panic really set in, then. Screaming and shouting, the delinquents fought to get away from their sick friends, T'Challa trying his best to calm them down to no avail.
Steve edged towards the corner, keeping his eyes on Rumlow at all times, taking slow, careful steps. He knew it would be hopeless but he was trying his best to buy himself time. He would die, but he would die with the last bit of dignity he had, no matter how small. He wasn't going to show any fear or weakness.
'Hey,' he greeted, his voice somehow calm and steady even though he'd just woken up, 'what's your name?'
'I saw my parents. My old butler, some people who didn't like me very much and some who did. But it didn't seem like it. When I saw them.' Tony was gasping again now.
They continued sharpening their knives, but this time in companionable silence. 'I did mean it when I said I recognized you,' Clint told her, holding his knife up to check if it was sharp enough. 'Really?' she asked him, not giving off a single sign that she recognized him as well. 'Yeah, I do. You definitely aren't from around here, though. I'd've known you otherwise. I used to be Fury's watchdog. Before I got into jail.'
'Yeah, they were done, but you just missed the whole point. They wanted you to sleep so you wouldn't pass out from exhaustion later on, Natalia,' he chided, and she huffed impatiently, already opening the door to the room Clint was in.
Natasha usually liked to keep out of dangerous or potentially volatile situations. She ran in the shadows and had done so for her whole life - she liked to assess things from afar where she wouldn't get into the worst of it and then later on, when she had a definitive plan, she would attack.
'Thanks a lot, Thor, I thought we would all die from an overdose of testosterone,' somebody else said, and Tony Stark slipped from the crowd, adjusting a pair of sunglasses he'd picked up from goodness knows where. He patted Thor's bicep, unable to reach his shoulder, and grinned at Rogers.
He had been sipping water and observing a butterfly hop from flower to flower when he heard a snap in the woods behind him.
'Yep. Do you have any idea if they're the right ones?' He crouched, sifted through the box and then handed her several magazines. 'Double stack, seventeen rounds. Nice. Not the best, but I suppose whoever stayed here was a civilian, they wouldn't have access to the high-capacity thirty-round ones,' she mused.
'What do you think almost killed me? I need to get them back,' Clint said matter-of-factly, narrowing his eyes at the blood on the bedspread.
He began to float around, looking for a window or anything which would show him the view outside. Sadly, the designers of the Quinjet hadn't thought windows were an essential, much to Tony's dismay.
They all came running over and Tony purposefully kept his eyes away from Steve as they took a look at the blood.
Maybe that was part of his emotional conflict. No notebook and pencil. Without art, how could Steve survive, really?
'We've been trying to intimidate him by talking for almost half an hour,' snarled Tony, who was standing by the fried controls. 'If we're gonna keep babying him then Steve's gonna die.'
'Don't lie, Rumlow. You're a murderer and you're just trying to worm your way out of this. What's next, you lost the knife the day before the murder? A spirit in the woods picked it up and stabbed Pietro? It just walked over there and ended up in his chest?' Steve's words were vehement and icy.
Natasha sighed. As much as she hated to admit it, Clint had gotten closer to her. He was the only one who'd made an attempt to get to know her and she wouldn't say it out loud, but the guy was kind of like the brother she'd never had. And if anything happened to him out there...
'Yeah, he's fine. He's in that other bunker with Stark and they'll be okay as long as they don't do some stupid shit like open the hatch. Clint, however...'
Darcy sneaked a quick glance at him, the edge of her mouth curling up. 'Who exactly did you leave behind?' He smirked back. 'Steve and Tony, in one bunker, and Bucky and Natasha in the other,' he told her, holding back a giggle. Her eyes widened. 'You little shit. You clever little shit. You're evil, you know that, right?'
He stiffened. She saw him tense and she internally winced, but it was too late to take back her words.
'Helpful,' Tony muttered, and then winced, but Fury didn't say anything, just gave him a disparaging look.
He picked up the bomb and inspected it. Thankfully there didn't seem to be much damage but he would only see if there was actual damage once it was set off, and then it would be too late. By some miracle, the hydrazine was still intact and so was the gunpowder and ignition. The three-part bomb wouldn't be devastating, but it would do a great amount of damage.
'Bucky,' Steve sighed, 'I'm not going to argue with you about this. I don't want to risk anything, okay? Please.'
Valkyrie had told them that the radio would take at least two days to fix, minimum, with Tony helping her. She said that instead of using a radio, they would make rocket flares, which the Helicarrier could see from space. They'd completely stripped down her pod to get materials for the launchers.
'I know Steve is important to both of you, but Loki's fourteen. You can't be suggesting torture. All three of you, leave the room.'
'For fun. I like breaking down people, bit by bit. Really pumps up my self-esteem,' she replied smugly, walked past him, picked up the bottle she'd seen him eyeing, and then sashayed her way out of the top floor of the drop ship.
Rumlow stepped forward threateningly and so did the dark-haired boy but somebody from the crowd spoke up and they both turned their heads.
'I hope not. They don't understand the importance of wearing it, do they? Like, how selfish can people be? Sure, they're guaranteeing themselves a lifetime of freedom - and, that is, if they do manage to live a lifetime by themselves on Earth with limited supplies - but they also aren't thinking of those up on the Helicarrier,' Steve said worriedly.
When they were outside and she shut the door behind her, he turned to face her with the same charming smirk.
Ignoring the jibe, Clint darted to the Asgardian's side and gaped at the collection of bows. If he thought the arrows were heaven, then the bows were definitely God himself in weapon form.
'I found glow sticks,' Tony said, and then laughed mirthlessly, lifting up several. He began to light one.
'This is for you, Natalia,' he whispered to her quietly, tucking the flower behind her ear, and she smiled weakly.
Once he had finished that he had gone outside for some fresh air. Bruce found himself spending longer and longer hours indoors and the stress was taking a toll on him. He knew it was dangerous to be out of camp walls - even though the bunker wasn't even that far from camp - but the promise of peace and quiet was far too much for him to resist.
The girl seemed to collect herself and turned to Steve. Bruce recognized her as Pepper Potts. She wiped away her tears and faced them with steely eyes.
A small smile tugged at his lips, even in his dirty, disheveled, bloody state. 'I know you, Natalia Romanova. You may try to hide your past from them but I know all about you. I even wanted to be in the Wolf Spider program, but it failed, much to my vexation.'
Natasha wandered over to him and took them out of his hands. She slipped them on and picked up the pile of papers which was by the display case. 'I'm sure we could do something if they left, like, manuals. Or at least notes.'
Natasha said that it was because he was being carried by somebody - or something - which was why he was moving so fast and leaving irregular splotches of blood. Sometimes they'd come across drag marks in the dirt or something just as ominous, like a torn piece of cloth from Clint's trousers.
Then again, she grew up learning to observe people. She was always aware of her surroundings. If she'd seen him once on a mission or whenever she'd come onto the SHIELD Helicarrier, then it would have stuck with her. And seeing him once in her life was nowhere near reasonable excuse for them to become best buddies.
He was roughly ushered forward. Any attempt to struggle was quickly met with a blow to his stomach and Steve furiously glared at them, repeating his question. He heard angry screaming and panicked shouts all around him.
He sent another wink to the blond and floated away, towards Rhodey, who looked pissed. 'What do you think you're doing, Tony? Get back in your seat,' he said, exasperated, but there was an undercurrent of fondness in his voice. Tony grinned at him. 'Didn't you miss me, platypus?' he asked innocently, and Rhodey rolled his eyes back, the corner of his mouth tugging upwards.
'Yeah, well, changed my mind. Dammit, I wish I had Barnes' fingerless gloves right now, I do not want to touch that with my bare hands.'
'I do many things that you are not aware of, my friend,' a third, very familiar voice said. It was silky, drawling and most definitely Loki.
'Beating him up is going to achieve nothing, and neither is electrocuting him, so stay away from those wires, Stark -'
Tony walked a bit further away from them, his mind alternating between screaming about how Clint was gone and probably dead and then berating him for avoiding Steve after that night in the bunker. They hadn't had sex, much to Tony's disappointment. Steve slept on the couch and gave Tony the bed. It had been very quiet after they kissed.
He leaned his head against the wall and sighed, letting his eyes flick over the bare room, furnished with just a bed, a cupboard and a tiny bathroom. At least they'd given him a pencil - paper was too precious to waste. He'd been sketching all over the walls of his room.
Clint closed his eyes and slumped back onto the bed as Bruce, Betty and Darcy clamored all at once, asking them for more details.
'That's fucking great for younger Steve, but it does nothing for you now. I'm either calling you Barnes or nothing.'
Tony flinched, tucked into a roll and then came up standing. He whirled around. Steve had missed. The Grounders were almost halfway across the bridge, they still hadn't seen the bomb.
'I did, but I would prefer you in one piece when we land. Get back in your seat, Tones.' Tony sighed dramatically and began to float backward, keeping his gaze locked with Rhodey's, who broke into a reluctant smile. He flipped over and nearly crashed into the blond boy from earlier, who was stubbornly ignoring him.
Steve paused before replying. 'Yeah. It did. I think it was something about those nuts we ate. I need to talk to T'Challa about it.'
Loki was back in HYDRA's base. They staged it to look like he escaped and even paraded around pretending to look for him to convince any HYDRA spies watching that Loki really had gotten out all by himself. They had a rendezvous point and Natasha and Thor were supposed to meet him the next day.
The delinquents were listening in through remote broadcast as Chancellor Fury gave a Unity Day Celebration speech on the Ark about how everyone was going to be on the ground next year. Everyone was happy and relaxed. Scott Lang had made a batch of "Unity Juice", or whatever, and was serving it out to everyone.
Tony had asked one of their friends if they could cause a small distraction if necessary but he knew it was too risky, in case they spooked Rumlow and simply speeded up Steve's death.
'Just - just shut up for a moment, Rumlow, okay? I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen and I'm sorry but we really need to deal with this situation,' Steve finally got out, his voice tense, and Bruce could see the remorse in his eyes.
'I want to know who did it,' Wanda said firmly. Her eyes were dry. Thor was impressed. She was just fifteen yet she was handling the death of her brother remarkably well.
She paused, a far-off look on her face, and then continued, 'They volunteered. Around five hundred people volunteered to take part in the Culling. Your friend's mother was one of them, Rogers. They had to decline two hundred people's offers, so she didn't get floated, don't worry. Then the chosen three hundred were thrown out of the Helicarrier. They called it the Culling.'
Steve ignored the compliment and instead focused on the very prominent blush on his cheeks, willing it to fade away. 'Did you come here for a reason, or...?' he asked Tony, heading towards Clint and Natasha, both of whom were the unofficial weapon dealers in the camp. Tony pouted, jogging slightly to keep up with Steve's long strides.
He nodded and grinned at her. 'I've been running into a lot of people today.' 'Oh, same!' she replied, laughing, 'I simply haven't been concentrating on my surroundings at all. Aren't you the son of Commander Odin? From Asgard?' 'I am, yeah,' he said, shuffling his feet, suddenly feeling awkward.
'As well as it can go when one is out in the wilderness, I suppose,' Thor replied, gladly accepting the food. 'Yeah, it's not that bad. Sure, there's weird insects, and strange noises, and we might all die from a lack of food in a few days, but it's great otherwise,' Clint told him, grinning. 'We set up tents, as well. With that plastic stuff. Tarp. We found a lot in the Quinjet. And some other things. We used the seat padding for pillows. Gonna be a great night.'
'That is very true,' Bruce agreed. 'Do you have any idea why they're fighting?' Wanda nodded. 'Rumlow and his gang wanted to remove their wristbands, to convince the Helicarrier they were dead and therefore the planet was unsafe to live on. He was holding some girl's arm over the fire to give the impression that she was suffering and then he cut off her wristband so they would believe she died of natural causes. I don't think it would do much, seeing as we have been living here for a day now and we're fine, but who knows? And he managed to get Thor's little brother Loki to follow him, which is why Thor's pinning him to the ground now.'
That startled a laugh out of Tony. 'You? Lucky? Nah, I don't think so. I'm the lucky one here, I've got an excellent view of some
Thor hefted the spear he'd been given. He wasn't sure why they decided a spear was best for him. He was quite skilled at using a war-hammer. Sadly, none of the inhabitants of the bunker had a war-hammer, much to his disappointment. He never understood people who kept guns but didn't keep war-hammers lying around.
They were walking silently. There was no need for talking and they all knew that. The air was growing colder by the day, and Natasha was freezing but she refused to let it show. They had warm clothes and blankets from the aid depot but not enough to go around. She would bet money that a few more delinquents would freeze to death in the days to come.
'Exactly,' he said, turning to Natasha again, this time confident in the fact that he had a supporter.
It was quite easy to remove a small section of the metal without making much noise, and anyway Rumlow thought they were still shoving objects between the drop ship doors to somehow lever them open.
As they got closer, it got worse, but thankfully it wasn't so harsh that they needed to cover their mouths and noses. It was barely tolerable, however. Thor guessed that the drop ship was no longer on fire but the stench lingered in the air.'
'Who's gonna make the shot? To set off the bomb? It's roughly two hundred meters, we checked and came back,' Clint said, having caught the tail end of their conversation, leaning on Natasha. Both of them were disheveled and dirty from their scouting.
His excitement was infectious and Steve was laughing along with him without even thinking about it. Tony dug in his own backpack, pulled out a packet of nuts and he tossed some to Steve. 'Eat up, wonder boy, we got boxes to unpack.'
Steve was trying to be as sincere as he could but the apology sounded fake and bland to his own ears. He knew it wouldn't have worked, not by a long shot, but he just needed Rumlow to know he regretted everything that had happened to him.
Okay, so they had sex last night. Whatever. The only thing unusual was that it happened in her tent.
They just had another kilometre or so until they reached Mount Weather. So far, they hadn't got any run-ins with HYDRA agents. Clint hoped their luck would continue. The rifle at his hip, the bow in his hand and the quiver across his shoulder were all reassuring but he was far too weak for his own liking, having to stop every few hours because his wound was hurting again.
'Thor, this is, uh, Darcy, she's my best friend,' she said, her face turning pink, and Darcy grinned. 'Hey, handsome,' she said easily, 'which planet did you come from?' 'Asgard, I'm from Asgard,' Thor told her, and she grinned wider. 'Wish someone would've told me that when I was still up there, you bet I would've hauled my ass there before you could say "home of the hotties".'
The next thing he knew, he was tied to a tree stump, gagged and unable to move, his wound somehow cleaned but still throbbing in intense pain. He'd looked around, tried to free himself, tried to call out his friends' names - tried to do anything, really - but eventually fatigue and distress took over and he blacked out again.
'Wait,' Bucky said suddenly. He pointed to the ground. 'Footprints. Any chance they could belong to our mystery thief?'
'Well - that's only if they don't do it first,' he got out through gritted teeth, and she looked towards the door, concerned.
The next moment he was dangling upside-down and being carried at ridiculous speeds, definitely bleeding out, barely able to form coherent thoughts. At one point he'd hit his head and then blacked out. He hadn't seen his attackers' faces once, but he knew they were human. No animal could move like that, act with such grace and purpose.
For a moment he actually thought they were dead but then Steve started snickering, and so did everyone else, so he rolled his eyes and sat back. 'Fuck you, Barnes. Hope the ghoulies get you.' 'Ooh, I'm terrified,' Bucky said mockingly.
Some part of their energy had been devoted to talking to Loki, trying to get information from him. This job was mainly Thor and Natasha's. Thor because Loki was his brother, and Natasha because she was the best interrogator in the camp.
Clint followed her, ignoring the pain in his abdomen, and he heard the others coming up after him. Natasha had been right. The place was deserted and as silent as a cemetery. The lack of noise gave him the chills and he stood beside her, taking in his desolate surroundings.
'If he does I'll break his nose,' Bucky said firmly, grabbing Steve by the shoulders. 'Listen up, punk. You're amazing. You're kind, sweet, caring - everything somebody could want in a boyfriend. Go for it. Tell him you've reconsidered. And if he does give you up - then he didn't deserve you in the first place, and I'll kick his ass.'
Thor stood up. He didn't think he could bear sitting in the same room with his brother anymore. He headed towards the hatch, eyes downcast. Loki didn't say anything else. Thor hefted the hatch open and placed his foot on the first rung of the ladder when Loki called out to him.
James arched an eyebrow at Tony, clearly surprised at the sudden change of heart in Tony Stark, fuckboy extraordinaire.
‘Buck, I gotta do this, please,’ he told his oldest friend, and Bucky must have seen the anguish and desperation in his voice because he fell back reluctantly, jaw set.
'You think some of this stuff still works?' Steve asked, and Clint turned to see him holding up the very same gauntlets he'd been eyeing.
'Clint, get in the clearing, get a clear shot. You'll have just one try. Steve, flank him on his right and James on his left. Tony, stay right here, and I'll go around. In case it escapes you need to be ready. Got it?' she whispered, and they all nodded.
She'd been so close. So very, very close. Natasha's plan had been near perfect. She'd managed to get onto the Helicarrier without detection at all, a stowaway on a craft that had gone to the Russian space station to trade supplies. Her escape route had been planned as well, another craft heading back to Mir, but this time for political reasons.
Loki picked up the rag with two fingers, looking disgusted, and then shoved it back into Tony's mouth. Again, sloppily, and Tony could easily spit it out in a second, but Tony wasn't going to tell him that. The boy threw him one last vindictive look and then stormed out of the door.
Her face was one of shock for roughly two seconds before she realized he was joking and she smacked him again.
'We aren't, and in no way do we advocate replacing objects used for playing sports with humans, thank you very much,' Steve told him as Bucky straightened up, and Tony smirked. 'Hey, there's Tasha. I forgot to tell her we're going out again. Be right back!' Clint shouted at them over his shoulder, shoving Tony off him and jogging towards the redhead.
Thor walked over to her to get a closer look, as did everyone else. 'Look at the hilt,' she told them, and they did.
'That's the only good thing I've heard from you in over a week. Maybe you aren't so bad,' the rough voice said, and Bruce heard a tinge of satisfaction in the speaker's tone.
'We did not mean to,' she replied tentatively. 'We were just trying to survive. Those flares - we were calling to the Helicarrier for help, we never meant to burn down a village. We can help you rebuild, and we will offer our resources -'
yeah i liked writing this chapter. it lifted my mood. also, i've realized i wrote this fanfic based on the speculation that most of you who were reading knew about the 100. sorry about that. if there's something anyone doesn't understand, like a bit of terminology or the way something's described, feel free to ask me. here's a bit of fanfic for y'all to munch on while i write the next, see you later, and lots of love <3
Steve shook his head and smiled sadly down at his boyfriend. 'Nothing,' he replied, watching the way the sunlight reflected from Tony's hazel eyes, the way his nose curled up a bit at the end, the way the corner of his mouth quirked up for a moment before he pulled Steve down and kissed him deeply.
'Let's go, then,' he said, and they both got up. 'You take the downstairs. There's a hatch, I'm going to go up there and see what the hell that is.' Bruce nodded in agreement and got to work, beginning with the far end of the drop ship as Tony pulled down the ladder to the hatch and climbed up.
Thor made his way over, his blue eyes both troubled and sad, rubbing at the place on his jaw where he'd been hit by his little brother. Bruce went to him, looking worried, and Steve was about to go as well when Tony announced that they were leaving and everyone else were dicks for not volunteering.
understand. Steve knew of his relationship with Natasha, and Bucky hadn't gotten over her, not by a long shot. He wanted to hear his oldest friend's familiar laugh, which he hadn't heard properly for more than two years. He wanted to explain to Tony how much he meant to Steve, how much Steve would sacrifice for him, how much he was loved.
'Really, what are you doing here? You're working with - them? Whoever they are? Lackey, did you kill Pietro on their orders -'
Sam nodded. 'So you want a relationship, but you're afraid of it ending. Have you told him this, or...?'
Bruce had been dozing off, in a prolonged state of exhaustion due to his constant care for Clint, when Thor and Jane came running into the camp, shouting to wake everyone up.
They all waited with bated breath at the bottom of the ladder as she opened the hatch and peered out. It was deathly quiet and after a few moments, when there were no angry shouts of guards or gunshots, Clint relaxed and saw the others do the same.
He'd been worrying over the mess that was his life - his father lying to him and then beating him up for being gay, his mother either ignoring him for most of his life or trying to reconcile with him after she came to the realization that he was, in fact, her son, Jarvis passing away, Steve - heck, he thought a lot about Steve, way too much than even he'd admit.
Steve sighed. 'No. I already had this conversation with Bucky. First - you're injured, you're not going anywhere. Secondly - it's just us three, okay?'
Jane arched an eyebrow at him. She knew all about Loki and his tendency to cheat, lie and cause chaos. Thor shrugged, stood up and went over to his younger brother. Loki's eyes narrowed and he stepped back so he wouldn't have to keep his head at a ninety-degree tilt to face Thor properly. His hands were clasped behind his back and he looked like he was struggling with whatever he was holding.
'I knew him, Thor. He's the son of Commander Odin, everyone in Asgard knew him,' Valkyrie commented.
'I might have an idea,' she said slowly, as they both trudged into the muddy water. 'But first we need to see if we can find that radio.'
'I mean... kind of? Depends on your definition of okay,' Steve told him, accepting the bottle he was holding out and gulping down the water.
Two fifteen-year-old kids - the Maximoff twins - also wanted to come along, but Steve's mother hen instincts came out of nowhere and he firmly told them they were too young and they should stay in camp. Nearly everyone knew about the Maximoff twins. Aboard the Helicarrier, couples could only have one child, to regulate the population of the space station.
She had good news, though. All of the Helicarrier's mechanics and engineers were on working on the second Exodus ship - the bigger one - to get it ready before the oxygen supply ran out. Maybe if they could coordinate with another space station and send maybe a thousand people out of the Helicarrier they could get it done quicker and faster and could come down to Earth.
It was a sad sight - the smoking drop ship on the forest floor, blood still on the seat, and the radio -
'Of course you did, that's the logical thing to do,' Bucky said, yawning, emerging from the tent behind Steve, 'because we totally have bows, y'know, and we're so stocked we couldn't have used the flint for something useful, like knives.'
'Is it an apology you want? Even if it isn't, I want to tell you I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for letting that happen to you, and I want you to know I didn't sleep peacefully for days ever since I told you to get out.'
Jane led the way up the nearby hill, a notebook tucked under her arm. She seemed to know the way well so Thor followed her, careful not to trip over something in the dark. The night flora and fauna were beautiful. There were glowing white flowers, butterflies that shone blue in the night, mushrooms that emitted a lovely yellow light, and brightly colored caterpillars.
Huge trees towered over him, their foliage dotted with pretty white flowers. Tall, delicate flowering bushes swayed in the wind, the sky was the color of cornflowers, and the breeze smelled earthy and fresh. The sun warmed his skin for the first time in his entire life and he dropped to his knees, running his hands over the ground, whooping. Behind him he heard the remaining ninety-eight kids stepping out of the spacecraft, making similar sounds of joy and surprise.
'Yeah, well, we're not the ones to decide. Listen, just play fair this once, okay? If we do get shot at you're allowed to bug me about it for the rest of my life,' Steve said exasperatedly.
'Okay. I'm going to have to think about what you've just told me, and I'll get back to you. For now, make walls. Out of any material. Just make walls around your camp. That'll give you security from both random attacks and dangerous animals,' Fury told them, and they all nodded.
Steve shook himself out of his desolate thoughts and went back to his drawing just as there was a loud bang on the door. He jumped and barely managed to get to his feet before the door flew open. Two armed guards shouldered their way into the room, gripped Steve's arms and began to drag him out.
Everyone had been so caught up in trying to help the people injured by the bombs that they didn't realize there was someone on the Council plotting to send the first Exodus ship down early - Arnim Zola, a renowned Swiss biochemist. Zola managed to get HYDRA operatives on the drop ship and also convinced civilians to come too, telling everyone it was an emergency and they needed to launch the Exodus ship now.
Immediately he heard people unbuckling their seats and getting up. He did that as well, his legs slightly wobbly, and pushed through the crowd to get to the two bodies on the floor. He crouched beside them, eyebrows creased, and checked their pulse. Both were undeniably dead.
His eyes darted to one of the bottles she'd purposefully laid out on her right and her smile grew wider. In his bag she'd found four bottles. Two she ruled out as poison. The other two were antidotes but she knew if she gave the wrong one to Steve, he would die. Thankfully, Loki had just secured Steve's life.
'I'm bow-shopping. She's planning how to first blow my brains out and then castrate me. Nothing out of the ordinary,' Clint told him, his face deadpan.
'I don't think so. What would your brother say, Laufeyson, if he knew what you were up to aboard the Helicarrier?'
She felt the other side of the couch sink down and when she peeked through her eyelashes he was sitting right there, his gaze trained on her, sprawled against the armrest and the smirk still firmly in place.
Even if it were it would be impossible for long-range communication, especially to someone in outer space. Something went wrong with the radio signal - either when we entered Earth's atmosphere or when we landed.'
Loki rolled his eyes. 'The purpose of our mission is to simply confer with you. The Supreme HYDRA will not be attending but his subordinate is. He will meet you on the bridge tomorrow at twelve on the dot. Do not be late and do not miss it. This may be your last chance to speak to us.'
She'd been sitting next to Clint's bed for the past day, not moving, not even for food and water. Bruce, who had been taking care of him, hadn't moved away either. Steve came in occasionally, his eyebrows furrowed in concern, and had given them plastic cups with water and some bread from the drop ship, which neither of them had touched.
So, he made four walkie-talkies. They weren't very effective in long-range communication but they were very useful during a border patrol, or when a hunting party was sent out.
