Tony's brow furrowed; the gears in his mind were turning.  "Air traffic control. Let's pull the data of all flights leaving Moscow in the last twenty-four hours."
Steve was glad Peggy had made it. That she'd been happy. And now he could see in her eyes that she was happy for him too. When she'd seen him before Yemen it had been a different time. Steve had been in a very bad place and the future for him and had Tony had been bleak or practically non-existent at the time. But now Peggy was smiling and there was a kindness in her eyes that Steve recognised.
"Steve," said Banksy gently.  He reached out to put a hand on Steve's knee.  "I think the work you're doing is really important.  That's why I asked you and Danielle to come on the show.  Omegas need a world we can be safe in. But sometimes, people get so worked up about the world that they let people slip through the cracks.  And I don't want you to slip through the cracks." He patted Steve's knee. "I just want to make sure you're okay, that he's being good to you.  One O to another. Don't let him get away with being a jerk just because you're bonded to each other. Listen, how about sometime after the holidays, you come to a meeting with the Alliance?  You need omega friends."
"I should-- I should answer it; it might be Nat," Steve said, his voice thick. If she had news on Bucky then he needed to hear it, even if it was bad.
"...Rhodey!" exclaimed Tony with delight, turning.  Rhodey was standing there in uniform, looking... not thrilled to see him.
"...let's get you an external battery pack for emergencies," said Tony.  "...and for the record... you can't do that. You just... you sort of... I felt you wanting to be left alone, so I left you alone.  If you ever... if you ask me to distance us, I will. But I don't like it. I like being bonded, Steve. I like feeling you."
No running water, not really, and only scrounging up what they could find… Sam knew they could only wait until Wanda got better to move again.
“Not… exactly.” Tony deadpans. “I was a little late in entering so Pete probably has better details. From what I saw, though, he was trying damn hard to stop her.”
Steve doesn’t ask about Bucky. As it is, he understands that Shuri is doing her best, and if Buck really wanted to reach out it would be incredibly simple with the remote bracelet she’d given him.
, it’s unnerving as hell, like waking up to Clint sleeping with his eyes open beside your bed-brand of unnerving.”
and the comforting sound of people murmuring about. Silence would be too much. Steve hates silence, hates the feeling that everyone is overthinking about one thing or another.
, Secretary Ross. And, if it did, such a clandestine administration surely wouldn’t do well simply existing outside of public knowledge. The last group that did, well,” Tony grins over at Rhodey, who smirks back at Ross, “it didn’t end well for them.”

future, when today has only been one day and there are a list of things that can go wrong? How we can die on a daily basis?”
“You can’t just… offer me this, you, and expect me to just take and not think, think there’s something else, Tony.” Steve’s hand is moving from the tight grip to slide up Tony’s neck to cup his jaw, a warm and heavy weight against Tony’s check. The tips of his war-roughened fingers brush the corner of Tony’s lip and Tony opens his eyes to stare into Steve’s open and honest gaze.
It takes only a second for Steve to be beside Tony’s writhing form, worry laced in each crevice of his being. He’s still a little damp from washing the dishes, a little wrung out from the earlier battle and the adrenaline is still pumping through his body when he finally starts to calm down. It seems that his original hypothesis is true; Tony whimpers and curls into himself for a split second before groaning painfully, eyes moving quickly under his tightly shut lids. It looks like he wants to scream or cry or shout but the body isn’t responding to the mind’s messages.
the hero. Without the help of the Asynjur’s male counterpart, especially after I marked Antony to be mine in the afterlife, I had a limited roster of Goddesses to help me” She pauses, presses her other hand against Steve’s cheek. “I know it hurts now, Steven, but Tony did everything for you, in the end. His conviction and love for you and your teammates and the world was much greater than his contempt for all the negative aspects he has ever seen. His love for you was far more powerful than Amora’s desire for my son.”
Which is fine, really. Steve is not a little hurt at all. Or worried. That'd be unbecoming of the team leader.
Steve doesn't know why he notices this one mundane Wednesday evening. With everyine it's always "Cap" this or "Captain" that, and it shouldn't bother him really, being that he

, like a thousand razor blades are pumping through his veins. He wants to scream but the words turn to ash in his mouth, the sounds all wither and die on his tongue. Everything turns white and blue-white heat that’s engulfing his body.
After three doors slammed in their face and walking past a polite but equally harsh sign signaling that no,
face please don’t do this to me right now,” Tony whines even as he pushes himself off the wall and the two fall into step together and head towards a black SUV with tinted windows. “What else is there?”
, Strucker instructs from the intercom. The Scepter glows as Wanda tries to find more information, tries to dig deeper.
“It is not as unfamiliar as I would have hoped,” she says, casting her gaze downwards. “When Pietro and I were starting to train our powers, it was deemed easier to deal with us in smaller rooms.” They were basically cells, to be frank, but basically. They had been deemed unstable. Pietro couldn’t even stay still without vibrating.
“What you wanted,” a voice booms from somewhere in the main living room, “was to atone for your sins. And look at the mess you’ve made now; ‘Team Cap’ is out of the States, all but

“—idea, really. Just gotta change out of these get-ups, lay low for a bit. There’s a chance Stark will still be after us, or Ross, and although they are the reason why the Accords are there in the first place, well, no one would really look for us there. At least for now, so we can regroup enough and figure out what we’ll do next.” Clint surmises. Scott looks at Clint for a brief second, his mouth shutting as if he was
But he doesn’t see a thing, only this thick void of darkness before it begins to fade away into a familiar picture; it’s the top floor of the mansion.

“Good to see you, boss,” Friday greets once Vision and Tony get to the front door. “Colonel Rhodes has been keeping Ross busy as long as he can, but you’re both needed in the conference room. I’m afraid his patience is running low.”
and isn’t that just something out of a Ray Bradbury book? What. Steve reads on their off time, when the other Avengers aren’t going about being lousy scoundrels. “Master Tony has been having worse bouts of insomnia, spanning from five to six days per week for the past month. His eating habits have changed as well and he is currently consuming a total of two-thousand two hundred calories per day, which is odd for Master Tony. He sleep walks and suffers bouts of black outs that have lasted between two minutes to three hours. At these times he begins to speak to himself and create strange objects, always the same object.”
Tony has no words. Actually, he does but he doesn’t allow himself say them, doesn’t let the words slip past his bitten lips.
It’s dark in the room, smoldering, but Tony won’t tell Jarvis to turn up the lights, to allow Steve the pleasure of both
The Tesseract, Tony understands now better than before, is more. It’s an entity in and of itself, almost alive with no other function and nothing to learn from than the surrounding hands. Insofar, it seems, the Tesseract is a weapon. It was a weapon for the Jotun; it became a relic to the Asgardians. It was a tool for destruction for the Red Skull, it was a portal to war for Loki. It’s a tool now, as well, to grant Amora her dastardly wishes.
Tony watched Steve cry, uncertain of his new role as... what?  He was still Steve's Alpha. But not his primary Alpha, probably.  And after two months of ignoring each other, Tony felt like the best approach was a delicate one.
"Don't listen to him! He's full of rubbish," Melinda muttered. The woman was absolutely fuming, her face turning bright red.
Fury takes the barb and thinks about what he’s going to set off to do. As someone who works with information and barters in secrets, this may be a tough sell.
It still feels a little like getting left behind, though. He follows T’Challa and Nakia mindlessly, missing the awed expressions of those around him.
and golden apples. He ponders this for a moment, closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, eyes tightly shut with a hand pinching the bridge of his nose.
“They have the recording of your retelling of the events in Siberia and they say they’ve taken into consideration all the factors. The fact that Zemo isn’t talking and the King of Wakanda claimed he did not see you there when he recovered the man responsible for the Vienna bombing leaves us with only one possible solution.” Ross’s voice has been raising with each line of reasoning, and Tony absolutely hates everything in the cosmos that has aligned everything just so for the next point he knows is coming.
Stark,” Clint hisses and Wanda startles for a moment, catching the cold blue for a second before it went away with a blink.
Pepper turns around and together, with Fury leading, they begin to walk towards the exit. She doesn’t answer him for the longest time, waiting until they are descending in the elevator to respond.
“You have a plan,” they reply. Tony shrugs helplessly as Enchantress shouts from the other room and another loud wave of energy ripples across the air, forcing the wood to shudder.
and not a yelp or awkwardly flail his limbs during the fall. No one would think anything of it, anyway, with being a notorious non-morning person and more of a creature of insomnia.
The buildings are like castles made of glass. The architecture is older, more medieval but the foundations, the materials are like nothing he's ever seen in the world, all shiny metals and pearly roofs, onyx towers that reach higher than the eye can see. Thor is still waiting patiently for Steve's body to catch up but it's really his mind that's falling behind right now. They're standing on a giant shard of what feels like glass but it's thick and changing colors with every minute movement. The sky is dark and vast, shining with millions of stars and colored with the teal and orange and pink and aquamarine nebulas and galaxies from far off into the cosmos.
“The fabric of reality draws taut,” the winds whisper, soft, gently, “and the threads begin to unravel.”
“Captain, Master Stark has returned from his earlier endeavor, would you like me to fetch him for you?” Jarvis speaks from another unseen speaker and Steve pauses for a moment, runs a hand through his hair before deciding what to do next.
Tony looks like he wants to say something but swallows the response. “London… the only other person that had been exposed to Loki’s scepter, back before New York,”
“God,” Steve huffs out pressing his lips in a soft kiss against Tony’s neck, pressing the boneless body against his, “God, I just--”
and no control what so ever. An empty vessel with no true power, the whole of the universe in your grasp.

"They are wolf hairs, Sir, of a sort," Jarvis starts, "they're much longer than a regular wolf's fur but when dealing with this current predicament it's clear that the distinction should not be of immediate import. The threads you have also had me analyze seem to be made of a strange organic material, impenetrable by any kind of metal here on earth yet seemingly fragile. I have also run an image analysis on the tree and have linked it with Yggdrasil, the Asgardian Tree of Life that extends its branches and roots to the other worlds, as it is said.”
“OK, I’m entering the no-zone, so over-and-out, I guess.” Tony murmured into the intercom before shutting himself out completely. He entered the scrambled zone and paused momentarily as the electronics on his armor went haywire for a second before completely stabilizing. He walked past the fallen tree and up the faded and grimy scarlet carpets, past the center ticket booth and into the main doors.
, I hope, is what Natasha was trying to warn you about," Pepper says, motioning with a single, shaky arm at the set-up. "Not Tony. What would happen to Tony if he continued to try to stop your Golden Boy."
“Tony,” he breathes, relieved and exhausted all at once. Tony’s a little worn looking, tired, hunched over on his knees with his arms stretched out with the tension of the chains holding him down to the ground. Tony’s head snaps up, hope and fear and pain etched across his features.
with Cap.” Peter sighs and falls forward, mushing his face, and ensuing complaints, into the cushion.
was hampered by the stronger sense of acceptance found in each easy, slightly lopsided grin; in each awfully hidden chuckle; in each friendly jostle, each awkward embrace; each time their eyes met; each time they
“Sure,” Rhodey concedes, “but he’s also the guy with a degree in electrical engineering that figured pulling on random wires in your suit was a good idea and not borderline homicidal so.”
The long tresses of gold settle over smooth, unmarred shoulders and over the emerald green, leather straps and plates; the hard but malleable armor is skin-tight and weightless. The slim build gives no heed to the strength welded deep within the ethereal woman, though her thin waist and long legs give her figure an elegant essence. She's slightly battered, scratches running along her upper arm, and there's a bruise fitted nicely on her wrist.
The first time Steve sees the arc reactor it's by accident. He doesn't speak a word, just forces Tony back down on the ground and rips off ribbons of his white t-shirt (his favorite, really, but it's stained with blood and completely ruined anyway) and clumsily tries to apply pressure to any of the three bullet wounds on Tony's person: his right shoulder, the more than graze of his right ribs and his left thigh. Tony fights and groans and grumbles but doesn't necessarily tell Steve to get off. Which is good, because the idiot jumped in the line of fire and he's not in his
“You want me to work… damage control, in the intelligence network?” He clarifies. “I don’t have a very far reach as I did before.”
“Hey, Jarvis, can you prepare me the video feed from the workshop from last night? And some coffee,” Tony states blandly, eying all the seemingly random materials and evidence of his fresh insomnia bout.
“Tony.” Steve repeats and he is slightly startled by the flinch that shifts him atop of Tony’s body. “Tony,” Steve whispers, leaning forward,” please, just look at me.”
in his hand until he’s panting and watching the water drip down to his elbows. The water had picked up as much dirt as it could on its way down, dripping in greying splotches on the light dusting of plaster and rubble.
Scott sounds like he is on the same page, whispering, “well, its… my best guess, to be honest, but the only thing that wouldn’t make sense is…”
"Talk to me," he murmured. "Whatever it is. You can tell me. I love you now and I'll love you after."
"The fact that you feel a need to take it all worries me," Steve said frankly. "You're brilliant all by yourself. You don't need coke to fix your suit Tony. The answers in your head somewhere."
Tony felt an immediate sense of panic.  "No," he said too quickly, then, "I mean... I mean you guys already know what happened.  It was all over the news. I flipped out at Steve like an asshole, and he broke down and put himself in danger, and then he got force-bonded.  My bad."
Steve was blushing a little at Tony's hands. He let out a pleased sound when he touched his cock. "So, it's your birthday..."
Donner curled in on himself visibly, like an automatic defense mechanism. His eyes were fixed on the floor. "I promise, I'm not a badly behaved omega. I'm not like him. I'm good. I--"
"Good honeymoon, cap?" Fury asked and Steve was taken back. Maybe it was a gesture of kindness. Or maybe it was Nick realising he needed Steve on his side.
Jameson," Steve murmured, his tone lighter. He reached up to run a hand through Tony's hair, watching the way the sun picked up on the hazelnut tones.  One or two greys at the temples peeked out.  "I think Natasha knows every possible way to take someone down," Steve hummed.  "It's hard to not find it a little funny, though.  Such a small woman being so goddamn loud.  Frond's got some mouth on her, huh?"
A spasm went through him and he groaned, nearly dropping Nick.  Had he been shot or something without noticing?  The adrenaline had certainly skewed his perspective, that much was certain.
He bet they weren't even doing anything to help Bucky like they said they would. Steve bet they'd just shoved him in a freezer and had hoped he wouldn't be a problem anymore.
"I'm not drunk," Steve said, a little too quickly. His lips felt chalky with lipstick. Bright, red lipstick.  Mm.
Tony loped downstairs just before noon, his hair a mess, yawning sleepily.  He'd taken the time to put in contacts. Now that he had Steve back, he wasn't interested in looking like a hipster any longer.  It was back to sunglasses and goatees instead of regular glasses and beards.
Oh, please.  There's nothing SHIELD can toss at me that I haven't already gone through.  I just want to make sure we're doing this on
But it seemed like the only thing DeSoto was interested in, other than obeying Alpha orders, was Trickshot's fate, and if Tony could use that, great.  "We're gonna try to find him. ...we can find him, right, Steve? Would that make you happy, DeSoto? If we found Trickshot and made sure he ended up somewhere better?  Maybe we could even call Ron and let him tell you where he is."
Banksy looked surprised at this insight.  "...thank you, Donnie." He forced a smile, then went back to greeting people.  Donner had moments like that occasionally, ones where he was... almost human. Still generally shy, he had gotten more used to making his voice heard.  Only yesterday, he had complained loudly that they didn't really make omega maternity clothes for funerals. (Still over three weeks from his due date, Donner looked ready to pop.)
"We take as few people out as we can. Keep it subtle. Once we get inside and somewhere away from the main loading dock, then Sam and Tony drop down."
"This is all my fault, I pushed him to try on collars, I pushed him to try mating last night, I fucked up, I fucking ruined everything, he could be anywhere now, we're never gonna find him if he's off the grid, oh, fuck..." Tony was too distraught over losing Steve to even snap at Pepper, who had shown up to try to help out, though the situation was looking rather grim.  If Steve didn't want to be found, then they probably wouldn't find him.
Although Judy had made it sound like a suggestion, it was clear she was commanding Steve to go back to base camp.  Steve hadn't eaten since five AM, over ten hours ago, and she personally escorted him back down the long, dusty road to the camp, where it was bustling with activity.
"I'm guessing Tony isn't happy.  Well, neither is Steve- and they both need each other right now. So Tony walking out wasn't the
He sighed as he glanced back over to Tony. "You do realize that if you drink this much we literally can't do the simulation, right? You won't get a practice run. It's not
"I'm already pretty tipsy.  Gonna be honest with you, seeing Ty... his smell's all fucked up, Pep."  He lowered his voice. "He smells... I don't know how to describe it to a beta, he just smells fucked up, okay?"
Steve looked sad. "In a week, then we'll know if we have to deal with this." He rubbed a hand over his face. "I wish I could remember. But all I can really recall is his programming failing and him remembering things, little fragments. He was so upset and confused. It was like he was a kid, or something."
"I don't know.  Hopefully America," said Pietro, crossing his arms.  He looked down. Wanda had passed out on the floor, legs splayed out in front of her, chin dropped down onto her chest; her hair was a mess.  "...psionics takes a lot of energy. She's going to be out for a while. We can't go anywhere until she's up for more."
bonded," Steve affirmed softly. "I don't remember it happening, for the record. I just...woke up with it," he said, as if he could read Tony's mind. He was always good at filling in the blanks.
Tony stood on the patio, leaning his forearms on the railing, staring out into the bright, clear day.  The hotel was built on a slope; the lower lobby therefore was still able to have an overhang, on the back of the hotel.  There was a sweeping view of a rolling field of grass and wildflowers.  An annoying metaphorical scene of freedom.
The corner of Tony's mouth quirked up in a smile and he lay down.  He'd forgotten how tall Steve was, and how broad his chest was. He wrapped his arms around him, pressing his front to Steve's back, careful with the arc reactor and with the back of Steve's neck.  He set his chin on Steve's shoulder.
Almost prophetically, there was a beep from the front door and another member of the house staff walked in, two orchids in each arm.  She set them down and then went back for more.
"So what did you mean, earlier, you're not into twenty-first omega rights?" asked Trey, leaning onto the counter curiously.  "You're
Tony hopped up on the counter with a sigh  "Yeah. Thanks, Satin." He looked over at Steve.  It was a kitchen full of Donners. Ugh. None of them were even looking at Steve; while Banjo hurriedly cleaned up the mess, Satin hustled to pour Tony a cup of coffee, which she gave him on a saucer with a side of rich cream and two cubes of sugar.  Azabache had already gone back to cooking.
But there was an age difference. And one day Tony would be sick and maybe... maybe one day he'd be making a call to Banksy just like this one. It was a chilling thought.
"Don't beat yourself up over this, Tony.  We've got Hammer in custody and no one's blaming you for this.  Things could have been a lot worse."
He closed his eyes.  Steve was right about memory foam being amazing; Tony hadn't slept in his own bed since back in December and it felt wonderful.
"It's a masterpiece," said Tony, trying to get the painting to hang straight.  "Please tell me you didn't bring us another damned orchid."
One of his hands was slowly rolling a screw back and forth on the ground as Tony stared down at the mess in front of him.
"Project it!  I need to manipulate... I need to see..."  Tony's voice was growing louder, more excited.  "Lose the concession stands, lose the landscaping... the pavilions... oh my God... they're all radiating out... he drew the..."  Tony was talking to himself now.  "...he structured the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework... the... and that's the nucleus... this is...!"  Tony stepped back and pointed.
Steve was shaking. It had been so close. The front of his head stung where it had smacked into the floor as Bucky had thrown him down. He had thought it was over but then- then Bucky had froze on top of him and it almost felt like there were on that rooftop again, snow whistling through the air around them. He let out a trembling breath of relief and rested his forehead back against the floor.
The questions started out easy. What Steve was up to, how he found the food, the culture, the clothes. Marcus complemented Steve's style again. But then they got a little heavier.
Steve almost felt like crying. The moment was something precious, irreplaceable. He didn't think he'd seen Clint so happy before. His heart ached in his chest, but in a good way. And when Tony's fingers threaded into his own he squeezed lightly.
"Come on," Clint patted his arm. "We'll be back later," he told Cooper and then promptly dragged Steve out of the room before another question would be asked which he would be too polite to ignore.
Get over it.  You wanna talk about anxieties?  Fine. You wanna be a good omega? Fine.  Count 'em. Count these fucking scars, look me in the eye, tell me what they represent, how I got them, why they're there... and then tell me you actually want me, as an Alpha.  Because right now, all I'm getting is that you want someone less broken, more dominant. Maybe you're confusing me with my dad, I don't know." Tony stared down at Steve, expression steely.
"I don't want to think about him anymore," Steve sighed and leaned into Tony's touch, blue eyes flitting to his crotch. "Are you...very sore there? Because if you are we don't have to..."
"Well, that's what phones are for.  Come on, Tony.  You won't even notice I'm gone.  You'll be with Steve, and you two will have a
Tony nosed Steve's hair a little.  His smell was still very Steve-ish but it had changed, very, very slightly.  It was all the more unsettling for how subtle it was than if it had changed radically.  It was... uncanny.
"...yes.  It's been a very big day for both of you.  But you're both fine now. Steve, Pepper and Aria are going to reschedule for a post-heat interview."
"I agree," said Lydia immediately.  "The platinum would look better on him."  She took the rose gold collar from Tony and swapped it for the first one he'd looked at.  Tony held it, looking down, feeling conflicted. This wasn't nearly as sexy as he'd initially imagined.  Steve's clear discomfort was ruining the erotic element of it for Tony. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if Lydia and Kitty weren't there.  Tony still couldn't quite get over Lydia's weird non-status.
"Steve's a soldier," added Sam.  " He knows how to handle himself."  Despite his and Tony's earlier disagreement, seeing Tony look so worried was hard to ignore.  Tony kept rubbing the back of his neck nervously.  Clad in armor, he could not actually touch the skin, which was hidden away beneath the shiny red exterior of his Iron Ma suit.
Steve had disappeared within a few days and neither Aria nor Natasha nor any of his other friends had, to Pepper's knowledge, had any contact with him.
"Don't let appearances fool you.  The girl's a mutant. Her HYDRA code name is the Scarlet Witch, and she's deadly," said Maria.
A slender woman in a backless red dress passed by them holding a martini.  Tony plucked it from her hand, grinned devilishly, and slid a hand down her spine.  She giggled and pressed a kiss on his cheek, leaving a smudge of red lipstick.  "Happy birthday, Mr. Stark."
"Ha-ha, very funny, Jarv.  Put all my calls on hold, I gotta go downstairs and whip up a new element or I'm doing to die," said Tony.
Suddenly Tony was there, too, drink in hand, glaring at Brooke.  "Hey! That's my omega!" he snarled.
good at sucking Tony off. He knew what he liked, knew what tipped him over the edge and knew what teased him nice and slow and allowed Steve to drag it out.
Part of him, the part that was an Alpha and a man and a human, was aroused.  Wanted to lunge at Steve and bang him senseless right there on the floor.
Now's not a good time.  He's trying to make his suit self-assemble so he took cocaine," he said, following her gaze to the pizza box as he looked up.
matter and you didn't exactly make your status look very good by having a meltdown when your mate turned out to be an asshole!" snapped Fury.
.  Steve looked up at the seams on the ceiling, the small bolts, trying to ignore the sensation.  Natasha pointedly didn't look and glanced to the floor. Phil was as gentle as he could be. Steve didn't feel remotely sore around there, which he took as a good sign. But then if they'd induced a heat, did that really mean anything? He was just grateful when Sam returned with a blanket. It was nice to be a bit less... naked.
Steve disappeared and returned with the pizza. He set the box by the poolside hopefully. He had gotten Tony's favourite: pepperonis and peppers
"I hate to break it to you, kid, but you guys aren't bonded any more than I'm sober," said Tony, pulling a flask from his jacket pocket and taking a swig.
Tony saw a flicker of hesitation before Steve got up and went to grab the condoms.  He settled onto the bed, smirking, feeling content; Steve returned and lobbed the box next to him.
was the real Bucky; complaining about not having smoke for a while, even when they'd be getting goddamn shot at. Dum-Dum would find it hilarious. Steve sometimes found Bucky's priorities worrying.
"I miss him," said Donner softly, looking down.  His eyes welled up a little. "I miss him so much."  A hand went up to touch the mark that was still on the back of his neck.  The one that no longer bore any meaning. "Maybe-- maybe things would be different, with the baby--"
He checked his watch surreptitiously.  It was still midday; in the McLaren, they could make it to the base in a couple of hours, assuming no traffic.  Tony hadn't actually felt especially nervous until now.  Now, he was wondering just how bad it would be.  He wished he could have one more drink, just to take the edge off.  Steve seemed to think that would make things worse, but as far as Tony was concerned, it could only help him to relax.
Combined with Tony's odd feelings about Happy and Pepper and Steve's own rejection...he wasn't feeling great. The thought of disappearing into their room was becoming increasingly appealing. Steve didn't find Happy and Pepper's relationship that much of a surprise but he tried to understand that Tony needed time.
Happy dropped Tony and Steve off, leaving Pepper in the front seat as they stepped out. Pepper was practically glowing. She'd evidently had a very good evening.
Tony huffed and settled back down on Steve's back to wait it out.  He wished Steve hadn't mentioned the whole
Steve had woken to fever; it was the first time in his life he'd experienced a real heat.  He'd been so scared he'd wanted to cry; half his unit was unbonded Alphas and they were in the middle of nowhere.  So what if he was a supersoldier; he was still an omega, far from home, vulnerable and emotional and weak with need.  He'd emerged from his tent pale and shaking; the men had looked up at him.
"But I don't know what... what I'll do." Donner said, looking miserable as he stared at the floor. "What do I without him?"
Logic was telling him that he would only ruin his own home and make an ass of himself in front of everyone if he insisted on fighting Rhodes.
"Shh," said Bucky softly, gently, nosing the omega's hair.  "Shh... it's okay, Stevie, I promise... I'll take you somewhere else, then, where ever you want... we won't cooperate with them.  I promise."
"...holy shit, I'm sorry... I swear, Steve, this has never happened before... it's your smell, I lo--"
Tony made a wheezing sound at him and an elaborate gesture.  He was clinging to Steve, whose bad leg was trembling under him; both of them were digging their fingers into the other's skin.  Steve reached out automatically to accept the clothes.
isn't even a real person.  Sort of invalidates all that paperwork that Rhodey signed, huh?  Sort of makes the non-disclosure agreement non-binding, makes it so that we can release all the tapes of your little pals trafficking people.  I'd hate to be in Gene Bennett's shoes right now."
"C'mon.  Maybe I'll feel better if I read some fanmail.  Have my ego stroked a little."  Tony cleared his throat loudly.  "Ego," he repeated, looking pointedly at Steve.
Not content with letting Steve live a quiet life, Aria insisted he follow through on his various public appearances, including a photo shoot for an omega clothing line, an ad council promotion for milk, and a photo op with some Boy Scouts at a local library
Steve was a tricky person to 'hold', mostly just because of his size. But if felt good to have Tony pressed up against his back and breathing soundly against his neck. It had been so long since Steve had experienced this sort of physical closeness... it was strange but not unwelcome. Tony's hands were warm against him, and grounding. And it was good to trust that Tony wouldn't try any funny business when Steve was in this state. Whatever this 'state' was.
he intended to clean him, before going back down.  Steve was literally dripping, and every time Tony pushed his tongue against Steve's opening, Steve's body shuddered and Steve babbled some cute little pleas in that harsh Brooklyn accent, and Tony was rubbing himself against the sheets, eager to put it into him, to let Steve's spent body milk the knot and drink his seed and get used by him all over again.
"...political?" Steve echoed, finally processing what Tony was saying. He dragged his gaze away from the box to look up at the Alpha.  "That doesn't even make sense," he said eventually, a frown knotting into his brow. "Why would I....
Tony looked up sharply.  He had lost track of time; he'd been flitting between his father's notes and the prototype for his newest suit.  Currently, he was listening to Van Halen and trying to unbolt a panel from what might someday be a compartment for anti-aircraft missiles or maybe a heat sink for a laser.  He wasn't sure yet; the current designs were still very much in the planning stages.
The group around Steve, drunk, was getting increasingly rowdy.  Banksy had disappeared, probably to protect the rug he kept worrying about.  The music in the background was loud and pounding again; it was after midnight and the party was slowly devolving into something more like one of Tony's parties.  Boswell was either an incredibly deep sleeper or he was upstairs with a bunch of pillows crammed over his head; the music was loud enough to drown out all talk except yelling, and the bass vibrations came up from the floor.
"I wanna come!" Tony whispered loudly to Steve when he caught his eye.  "We can take the chopper, please, wanna come, why can't I--"
"Tony," said Natasha, and her voice carried a warning in it.  "You're Steve's second Alpha.  You're the
He slumped down, his head smacking against the window, eyes falling shut. Steve went out like a light.
Natasha put Lila on her shoulders, Lila waved the dinosaur around a bit, squashed her hands on the back of Natasha's head, and then loudly announced "
"STARK!" he barked in his usual shout.  "Good to see you again! Good, you finally took that damned collar off, you looked like a fool!  Playing poker with us tonight? I'm a blackjack man myself! You ever play blackjack?"
Steve felt cold inside. Of course, when he'd signed his rights away all those years ago, he hadn't been thinking about stuff like that. It made no real difference to Steve who owned his reproductive organs, so long as he got to fight the good fight.  He would have signed away his very soul to be part of Project Rebirth; everything he'd done was to become a soldier.  He'd gotten his wish.
Tony cast a look over at Steve and Irshad, heart throbbing, but he nodded numbly and let himself be dragged away.  He decided to switch to a drink without any garnish for the rest of the night.
"After Dad died I... I was trying to run this business, and... and I felt like... like a joke, almost.  Me and Obadiah were partners. But I was the acting CEO, and Obie... he was like, a head taller, way, way more dominant, and... and I sort of found my niche by... you know, acting a lot more confident than I was and everything.  Because people will believe what they see, and I carved out this image of myself, you know, this no-fucks-to-give playboy, and everyone thought I was a badass, and then..."
"...I guess I always knew, deep down, that this would have to come to a head eventually," continued Tony, relaxing against the bar.  "Because, you know, my experience in Afghanistan was so humbling and it really put so much in perspective for me. It was an easy choice to make."
He wasn't bitter at Steve. Donner had made his choice and he was glad to went over to talk to the kids at the auction. They might have not walked out otherwise. All Donner could see them in was himself, wide eyed and hopeful. The auction was a risk, a gamble with your own life. Donner's didn't pay off. He'd always been the 'omega' Captain America; Gideon had loved to show him off.  The first two years were the hardest.  After that, Gideon had mellowed out a little and they'd come to a sort of peace.  Donner missed that.
He passed the menu back and followed Steve's gaze around the pub.  Aside from the bartender, no one knew who they were (yet). It was nice, sitting here at the bar together, like they were a couple of regular nobodies.
"Steve."  His voice cracked.  Steve had him all wrong.  Tony wasn't a good person.  He'd spent years building weapons, and never for a second wondered where his missiles were landing.  When he went to Afghanistan and saw what they were doing...
"Lucky number seven," agreed Tony.  He stopped suddenly. Sam walked into him, the suit solid and cold in the basement.
He paused in his pacing.  "Steve, I should get that vasectomy.  Y'know. Before your next heat," he said.  "It's coming up in like, a month and a half, and... the last one was... kind of tough, you know?  ...I could schedule it this month, before we go to England."
"Stop!" barked the asset.  "We take him alive!" He yanked off his coat to press it around Pietro's hand, then, feeling awful for abandoning his friend, tore off across the roof.  She was going to kill him if he didn't stop her.
"I-I..." It was weird, hearing his own voice again. "I was in the chair," he finally managed to get out. "It hurt. They hurt me. They hurt...him." Steve frowned in thought, struggling to work out the difference himself.
(He wondered how Boswell and Banksy managed.  Was there some trick other Alphas knew, or was this just how it was?  If so, he had been extremely mislead by pornography, which had always made heats seem sexy.  This was sexy in a rather more nightmarish way, with a lot more sweat and semen and pain. And Steve had a weird childish urgency about him, a dopey, glassy-eyed look that made him seem more animal that human; Tony found the whole thing distastefully perverted.)
When Tony got accepted to MIT, at the age of fourteen, his father had seemed unsurprised, not impressed, and Tony had gone off to school the next year seething that he
With that, he passed out again.  It probably had as much to do with the simulation as it did with the drink.  Despite the trauma of it, though, Tony seemed to be bouncing back quickly.  And why not?  His greatest fears had already been assuaged.  Steve was still here and still loved him.  It was ironic that Tony's psych test had been more traumatic for Steve than Tony; while Tony could reassure himself that it wasn't real and that he and Steve's bond was secure, there was no closure for Steve, and no reassurance.  Steve had thought he was the only one left alive to remember that field of tulips in France in the 1940s, the bright colors and the spring wind and the strange respite from fighting, at least for an afternoon.  But it was clear he wasn't the sole keeper of that memory.  Bucky was alive and now SHIELD was searching for him.  Something that Tony was, at least for now, blissfully unaware of.
It occurred to Tony, suddenly, that the reason Pierce and Malick had seemed so edgy and kept leaving to take phone calls was because SHIELD probably already knew perfectly well what had happened.  That, even as they were driving toward the airport, President Ellis was probably being briefed on what had happened.  That it was going to be all over the news and people would be asking questions.
Before them was a man and he had an RPG pointed at them.  He laughed as he stepped out from the corner he'd been hiding behind.   Tony's hands were up automatically; he drummed his fingers, charging up the repulsor nodes, ready to fire, if not defensively, then at least in retaliation.
Oh, God. Steve was dying from embarrassment. He was bright red and hiding his face into a pillow. "Oh,
Steve smiled at that, stealing a pancake off the plate and practically eating it in one bite. "That's great, James.  That's what I did after high school, too. Good pancakes."
Steve woke up. Sort of. He heard voices, a lot of them, and the back of his neck throbbed. Someone was wiping it with something wet. Urgh. It stung and it smelled of anti-septic. He twitched. What had happened to his neck? Why were they--
"Good luck out there," Steve said, his voice warm. He thought recognized the name. He was remembering a firework song, or something? JARVIS played him a lot of random shit in the gym.
He, Eric, and two others slipped out onto a balcony to smoke cigars while Jessica Simpson gave a performance (none of them were into pop music; in fact, they all had a great discussion about classic rock and metal), and as the sun set, the four of them leaned into the cool night air chatting about life as Alphas who were sons of Alphas.  (The topic had come up while talking about the recent smattering of omegas coming out as such. Tony had mentioned Happy's theory about Eminem being the next reveal and everyone had heartily agreed; a short, skinny blond? Likely candidate, though currently, he swore up and down he was a beta.)
Most of the artists had already left to go to the function. After all, Steve really should be the one arriving there last. He looked at Tony warily, who was either still drunk or over emotional from the song. Or perhaps an unhealthy combination of both.
"Don't look now, Steve, but you're got a couple of admirers," said Natasha, changing the subject. She was rarely emotional and rarely spoke much about her and Clint; clearly, she wanted them to forget it.
He was thinking of going downstairs and dredging up some old information on Jarvis.  Poor Jarvis, whose rich history had been lost because Tony had never bothered to think of him as anything more than a butler.  In theory, information about both Jarvis and Steve should be in his father's notes. Tony had boxes and boxes of notes and ledgers and journals and photos he'd never gone through, placed in boxes in the server room, having been stored away for decades and never touched.
Steve grinned and leaned his down to kiss the top of Tony's head before he moved to grab the shampoo. Steve squeezed shampoo into Tony's hair and moved to rub it into his scalp before gently rinsing it out too.
"...twice," said Tony, softly.  His voice was easily heard in the large, cavernous quiet of his workshop.  "You lied to me twice.  You lied to me about who you were.  And then you told me you were a virgin.  That you'd never been with another Alpha.  That you weren't taken."
Remembering their conversation from the previous night, he was listening to Taylor Swift.  She was okay.
Cooper shook Steve's hand in that self-serious way that children have.  He waited until Steve had let go to ask, "Did you bring your shield?" His little hands flew; clearly, he was fluent.
Steve woke up standing. He took in their bedroom within a few seconds. The sheets were ripped. His left fist was bloody (presumably from the hole in the wall just to his right) and Tony was on the floor looking at him like he was a monster. Steve opened his mouth to say something. He frowned. And then he promptly fell to the floor with a loud thwack.
He knew his personality, actually. He knew how stubborn and uptight Steve could be. How proud. How 'uppity'. But he didn't know who he was. And suddenly Steve felt guilty for that. He never expected Tony to develop feelings for him...he never expected them to be mutual. Shit. When SHIElD arrived behind them Steve was almost grateful he was saved from having to know what to say.
"C'mon.  If you want to be mated in your nest you gotta show it to me," demanded Tony.  "Don't want to ruin your pic--"
.  Steve believed in people and causes and stuff, and Steve worked to make the better place for purely selfless reasons.  The truth was, Tony's motivations were a lot more self-centered; he was making up for his past sins.  Iron Man was a sort of penance.  Steve had nothing at all to make up for, at least, not in Tony's mind.
"Can you ask her if she can do tomorrow?" Steve asked, not really feeling like seeing anyone but Tony today. The thought made his stomach turn.
"Am I going to be allowed to eat today?" demanded Tony, checking his watch impatiently.  "I'm starving.  How many more inkblots do I have to look at?"
"I didn't think so," Steve breathed.  "You fellows look out for each other out on the field, okay?  Status doesn't matter when you're getting shot at."
that smell.  It was the smell of an omega who needed him.  He'd smelled it earlier, in Monaco, but it had been faint then.  Now it was almost overbearing.  He'd never wanted anything more in his life.
"You're telling me," said Tony with a grin, walking over to the freezer and pulling out a bottle of vodka.  "White Russian?"
"Hey, look-- Steve, look, this isn't a bad thing," said Tony, sitting down next to Steve and putting an arm around his shoulders.  "He seems... happy. We'll get him a therapist, like Gleason said-- thanks, by the way, David--"
Steve's breath sucked in softly and he had to stop himself from looking away at all the flashing lights and flaring bulbs. It was a strange moment and it was hard to breathe until Tony's hand found his again under the table. He swallowed. His neck was tingling, almost like it was on fire...but not in a bad way.  And Tony had almost definitely ruined the hair the woman inside had spent ten minutes fixing. But Tony touching him like-- it felt good. It always did, didn't it?
Steve felt a chill run down his spine. And then, before he could even whip around, there was something piercingly hot digging into his ankle and he was dragged to the ground with a
of a person. They're supposed to make you happy, add to you, show you things you never even knew about yourself." Steve's lips twitched up in the hint of a smile. "Tony helps build me up.  Not break me down.  That's what a mate does.  They're not supposed to take stuff away."
She made Phil a hot chocolate and left it just outside the den for him. It felt wrong to step inside it. It was
This was all on him. He'd done this to himself. Jesus Christ. Maybe they were right. Maybe the ice had fucked him up in the head.  Or maybe he really was as self-destructively stupid as everyone said.  It had never occurred to him they'd send a mutant who could get into his head.  He'd just assumed it would be guys with guns.
"...'mega..." he gasped softly, unable to formulate any other thoughts.  The only mantra was pounding through his head again:
"Yeah.  We were cuddling, he woke up, babbled a bunch of stuff in Russian, punched a hole in the wall, the yooj."
He grabbed the back of Steve's neck without thinking, his fingers carding through his soft blond hair, and he turned, kissing Steve deeply, shoving his tongue into Steve's mouth, finally,
But when he woke, she didn't even notice.  At some point she realized he was lying there, eyes open (albeit extremely puffy), staring off into the middle distance.  He hadn't moved at all.
"I've been in preheat before and I was running home. And I broke this guy's nose to keep him away from me," Steve said, looking incredibly proud of himself.  "Bucky was
Tony passed through the lab and loped down the stairs to the server room, shivering in his bare feet, boxers, and undershirt.  There was a whole shelf of things stored in here, things Tony didn't trust to be stored off-site. He examined the boxes thoughtfully, not sure which one to start with.
have let him mate me if I knew you were still alive. I swear. And now I can't even ask for your forgiveness because you don't fucking understand!"
Sam was nursing a beer with Natasha in the corner who looked like she was sipping water (but Steve knew it was straight vodka). Clint had some fancy cocktail and Aria was sipping her jack and coke through a straw. Everyone seemed to be happy, having fun and Tony was grinning from ear to ear. It was good to see him so happy again.  Steve felt out of place at the party, even though it was his house. It was a far cry from the kind of parties he’d had in Brooklyn in his own century.
"Nothing you do is ever normal.  I'll get Steve an appointment with a omegologist."  She was already pulling out her BlackBerry.
The builders done for the day so they had no audience. It felt like quite a novelty in that moment- being alone, with just each other.
"Did you say Tony was with you?  Is he in trouble?  Can you put him on?" she asked.  Still, there was no anger in her voice, nor surprise.  Virtually everyone had an ulterior motive.  Tony was rich and powerful, with access to cutting-edge weapons and resources.  Finding out his PA had been a plant was disappointing but not unexpected.  Finding out the government was trying to recruit him for some weird team was also not unexpected.
Steve gave his head a little shake to clear his thoughts.  "What's President Ellis's stance status stuff?" Steve asked curiously. "Do you know?"
the one whose smell is permanently changed?  Did they even tell him to bond you, Steve? Did they?  How do you know he's not faking to get you back? Huh?"  Tony didn't really care if Bucky was "sick" or not. A rabid dog was sick, but it got put down, right?  As far as Tony was concerned, even if Bucky hadn't been responsible for what happened to Steve, he was still dangerous and beyond saving.  Also, he suspected Steve was standing up for Bucky because they were bonded. Naturally, Steve would side with Bucky. Naturally, he would want to help him, to nurse him through a "sickness," because he was a good omega and that's what good omegas did.
Tony shuddered violently.  A massive headache hit him between the eyes, leaving a series of weird impressions that he didn't understand.  A Ferris wheel, a couple of coins in his hands, the smell of popcorn and seasalt. He felt disoriented, like for a split second he had blacked out, but he was exactly where he was, in Steve's studio, staring at the old arc reactor jammed into the wall and a drawing of a fox climbing out the window, and Steve's smell was thick and persistent.
He didn't even look back. Tony didn't want him. He didn't. Steve felt numb all over, like someone has stolen the air out of his lungs. Like he was drowning in ice cold water all over again. Steve realised he was being lead up to a car.
"Oh, no, you don't!  I killed you!  You're dead!" yelled Tony, lunging into the fray.  No suit, but they were already dead, so what did it matter?  He wasn't afraid.  Not anymore.  He had been chewed up and spit out and now that he remembered who he was, he was going to come out swinging.  The complete and total lack of logic didn't bother him anymore.  He remembered his name and he knew that this gorgeous blond fellow needed his help, and that superseded any of his earlier miserable musings about inadequacy.  In death, all men were equal.
of omega friends. I have like..." He counted off the top of his head. "Like five!  And two of them are in SHIELD and they're excellent agents. Malick isn't an agent and he's full of shit. Men like that have never been out in a fight. They sit behind their desks in their fancy suits and pretend they know what's going on. Omegas make good agents, just like Alphas and betas. We're not all happy as housewives; some of us want to make a difference. I like to think I did. Sure, I was shot. But it was a war, people were out there dying...I
"I know. I couldn't help myself," Steve said, a mischievous kind of glint in his eyes before he slipped away off the bed before he headed into their walk-in-wardrobe. He returned which a box, which he deposited on the bed before opening. There wasn't a huge range. A couple of dildos and a vibrator (one of which Clint had bought him. Steve had turned bright red, embarrassed; Clint had reassured them that, omega-to-omega, he would not tell anyone Steve was using toys).
Tony pulled away from Steve, an enthusiastic grin spreading onto his face.  "...I have a surprise for you," said Tony. He looked over at Pepper. "Didja get it?"
"Sir?" JARVIS' tinny voice flooded the workshop, reaching Tony's ears. "I do believe, going by his heart rate, that Captain Rogers is having a panic attack."
Steve smiled grimly. "The last man who tried that got his spine severed in two," he breathed and then he ran right at Vanko, ducking out of the way of one of the whips before he jumped up and slammed his shield into the suit helmet with full-frontal force.
"JARVIS!" shrieked Tony when he heard Steve's cries on the other side of the door.  The sounds Steve was making were like a wire that went directly into some very primal, primitive part of his brain.  "JARVIS, open this door!"
"No matter. Even baby steps count," Banksy reached out to squeeze his arm. "You have to be one of my first guests. I absolutely insist."
"Okay. Sorry. You feel as bad as you need to," Steve breathed, his stomach doing flips when Tony said he loved him again.
was a pretty good moniker for him.  In the thirties, before the serum, he'd often been called bratty and spoiled because he was so headstrong.  He'd tried to enlist a half-dozen times, status be damned, and been laughed away over and over.  Still, he'd persisted, often having an Alpha recruiter call a weary-looking Bucky to come and collect him, the 'troublemaking omega.'
"My omega.  Steve. Good omega," he chanted softly, nuzzling against Steve.  He gave a sharp warning snap at Aria when she passed Steve a bottle of water.
"Oh, shush, you're doing great!   One last push and you're all done," said Richard, with surprising alertness, considering it was three am.
Steve tried to focus on the feeling of his mate's hand in his hair, stroking slowly. He trembled against him in a strange kind of relief and didn't even cry out when another wave of heat racked through his body. It was nothing compared to the pain of disappointing his Alpha.
He hopped into the Aston (who the fuck cared if he left Morgan alone in his house?), drove back to Westwood (who the fuck cared if he got another DUI?), parked illegally (who the fuck cared if he got towed?), and went up to Steve's apartment to demand forgiveness.
Tony forced a smile.  "Just because people don't have a right to judge us doesn't mean they won't.  People are also saying we're only together because I'm... y'know.  My dad's son.  And you and my dad..."  He trailed off, letting the words hang.
He was relieved when they moved on to all the fun stuff.  Tony had been itching to take an IQ test; he was too many standard deviations for his intelligence to be quantified accurately and most tests concluded he was somewhere in the low 200-range without giving a solid number.  Word association was quickly abandoned almost immediately after Tony associated "trust" with "fund" and "capital" with "gains;" he beamed at Dr. Brazinski as she dug a pile of ink plates from a drawer of her desk.  She was finding what she typically did; that the smarter a person was, the more they liked to play around during the tests, making it difficult to access what they were really thinking.
Pepper's face twisted a little.  "...you're... not really his primary Alpha anymore, though.  I mean, he just admitted that to the entire world this morning."
"...reboot complete.  The Mark V's system is online again, sir," said JARVIS helpfully into Tony's ear.
anything.  Obviously, Steve's a soldier, and me, I'm-- I'm me, I can't have kids-- I mean, I'd be a terrible parent, neither of us want that, we didn't think-- I don't-- it was a mistake, we didn't think he could-- I mean, he's got what, two percent body fat?  ...if it weren't for today he still probably would have lost it, and that's for the best, we couldn't have kept it--"
He remembered Howard joining them once. He had destroyed them, and made one or two comments about Steve at the time. Dum-Dum always used to be about as terrible as Steve was, so it had been fun. Flasworth always insisted that he 'had' to get drunk in order to play at their level.  Steve remembered feeling special, being the only omega in the bar, getting served drinks and being allowed to play parlor games as if he were a normal person.
Tony felt relief when Steve said they hadn't slept together, but it was nothing compared to the relief he felt when Steve told him he didn't have to eat.
The scientist walked out and there was the sound of a door closing down the hall; a moment later, a young, blond omega was standing in front of the door.  He was in track pants and a t-shirt, and his arm was in a sling, his hand heavily bandaged. He rapped his knuckles against the glass.
"Oh, we broke up," said Happy.  "It's okay. We weren't really compatible.  She wasn't really all that stable and I think she needed some time to figure herself out, you know?"
"He's the omega version of captain America," Steve muttered into glass, his gaze getting distant as he supposedly imagined doing away with Gideon all over again.
"Which base are you taking me to?!" Steve demanded, getting increasingly upset. "If you don't tell me where I'll get out of the car."
probably be some form of torture," he warned him quietly.  "We could always sneak in today and give a test run, let you have a small taste of it to see how you feel about the real thing. Then that still gives you a week to prepare," Steve suggested tentatively.  "Speaking of that," he looked over at the clock hung up on his wall. "We have about half an hour before we have to leave."
He shoved through the crowds of people, aware that his lip was bleeding all over again and he probably looked like a bum.  Actually, it was turning out to be a decent disguise.  No one recognized him; a few people gave annoying cries as Tony pushed past them.
Tony. What the hell does that mean?" Steve huffed. Even though they all knew what it meant and it was something very sinister. "If I can't change the minds of men like him then what's the point? What's the point if he doesn't even see me as a goddamn person?"
Aria laughed gently. "I think Tony can handle romance just fine. I think, in the end, it's how he sees what he's entitled to. And I kind of blame his dad for that, going by what Steve's told me… there's some stuff about Howard he hasn't actually told Tony. His memory of his father is tainted enough," she sighed and moved to get them two wine glasses.
feeling anything other than drunk, smug, and productive.  There's nothing to work out, is there?  You and I had earth-shattering sex, which we both agree should be kept a dirty little secret, and I'm gonna go home now, and you're gonna go rub shoulders with your super secret league of justice or alliance of liberty or whatever the hell it is."
"I hope he's been good," said DeSoto's Alpha, curling a hand onto DeSoto's shoulder tightly. Steve felt an instant urge to push it off. The man barked out a laugh when he saw Tony in his boxers, like it was funny and not embarrassing at all.
"Well, she did it again," said Tony.  "This place is nice," he concluded after making sure the bar in the living room was stocked and giving one the pillows on the bed a test-punch.  He put his hands on Steve's waist and beamed up at him. "God, we needed this."
"--ha ha, yeah, like, when he was testifying against me in the Senate, you know, that was great," agreed Tony.  "Hilarious, really... I mean, I wouldn't really call us competitors, you know, my inventions
Tony had rules.  No virgins.  No omegas.  No men.  Here he was, breaking all three.  He didn't care.  Steve was different.
good. Steve was letting out high pitched little sounds mixed with curses, sounds he certainly wouldn't ever let anyone hear but Tony.
"We're going to the base hospital," said Natasha.  "...Steve... I wish you'd called me. Instead of Sitwell.  You know I would have answered. You know I would've come."
Steve really loved dancing. He honestly did. It was the closest you could get to fighting, in a way. A sense of rhythm was key and you had to watch what your partner(s) were doing in order to do it well. A good fighter was always a good dancer, or at least in Steve's experience.
He blushed a little when Tony began to strip down but the phone call gave Steve a chance to gather himself. He rubbed at his cheek and then at the back of his neck. Whilst Tony talked to Pepper he went to get him aspirin, sitting at the bedside again as he set the box down on the tray.
, went unsaid. It felt pretty great. He kind of hoped Ty left soon so he could do something about it.
"No," repeated Tony, looking quite a bit more sober than he had a moment ago.  He pointed. "That's not Steve's collar."
he doing?  He wasn't sure.  "I thought... never mind.  I... I was... trying to find Rogers."  Tony was suddenly feeling a lot more energetic.
Pair-bonds rarely, if ever broke, with death being the only real condition that tended to separate partners once they'd bonded.  Tony had heard of people wasting away after losing their partners-- everyone had-- but that was all anecdotal.  Clinically, Takotsubo syndrome had been described fifteen years after Alpha-omega divorce had been legalized; whether or not the two were correlated was uncertain.  But Takotsubo syndrome was generally reserved for pair-bonds that had been around forever, like Howard and Jarvis.  And besides, he and Steve weren't paired.  Tony had merely
"Shut up.  Listen, Steve's phone is dead but I need to talk to him, as soon as humanly possible.  Aria and everyone had done a really good job of covering up his little... vacation. But you also canceled five meetings with five different luxury jewelers and if you and Steve want to go to that conference, which I advise against, by the way, you're going to need to--"
Whoever had captioned it had gotten Howard's name wrong, which he found amusing, and had also incorrectly assumed that Howard was bonded to Captain America.  He knew better.
But Tony didn't want to risk getting kicked out of the bed, or Steve pushing him away.  Or, perhaps worst of all, Steve being mad at him.  He wanted Steve so badly it ached, physically and emotionally; Steve's love and approval meant
Tony's skin crawled.  Sometimes, he felt like JARVIS was getting just a little bit too damn smart for his own good.
He reached between them to stroke Steve's erection, nuzzling his neck, trying to give him some comfort even though he knew Steve only wanted one thing.
He didn't say anything more. There was nothing more he needed to. The way his back arced up and his body language said it all. Steve was completely compliant and pliant to Tony's touch and command.
Steve considered Tony with a small smile.  He had always liked Tony in glasses. He didn't know why. Clint assured him it was a common thing to like so he didn't think too much about it. He moved to get back into bed. The sheets were warm and soft and the thought of staying in bed all day was a very tempting one. "Staying in bed sounds perfect, actually," he said softly and leaned back against the pillows as he watched Tony nurse his coffee like it was his lifeblood. He smiled. He wanted more memories like this.
The flight passed quickly and Trickshot was evidently becoming increasingly nervous. They even gave him a whiskey to help calm him down. It made him giggle. They hadn't let them drink alcohol at the school, unsurprisingly, so his tolerance was very low.  "I missed this, too," he informed them as Tony poured him a third shot.
Tony inched over, practically into Steve's lap, resisting the urge to lie down on him, cover him.  He reached out and took another sandwich, and offered it to Steve. He didn't say what he was thinking: that death broke bonds.  That he could kill Bucky and then that would be that.
"I know the feeling," Steve squeaked, turning a little pink. "Well, it took me over seventy years to get laid. So you've got that record to beat," he tried to joke. Tiberius laughed quietly and it was a deep sound. Steve smiled faintly. It was nice to see him laugh. He felt so very sorry for Ty. He couldn't imagine people avoiding you like the plague because of your smell. Steve knew it was like to be ignored, patronized... but when he was small no ever
Nervousness was coiling in Tony's stomach.  Steve wouldn't go undercover again, right?  They were past that.  Steve was Steve.  The idea of him pretending to be some other Alpha's assistant...
Steve had thought he'd be able to keep Tony from running off, but he was sorely mistaken.  Shit.  He'd made his way toward the stairs and before Steve could stop him, he'd already announced himself to the crowd, who had roared in approval, and then been sucked into it and disappeared.
"Tony, I've got a target lock," he warned as a small, red crosshairs appeared on his HUD inside the helmet.  It bounced around, keeping its target in the center with shocking precision.
, as a person; it's not always about status, Tony.  Especially not for us omegas.  And I know what your scars are from. And if you think that makes  you any less of an Alpha then you're crazy, because you killed them all; you became who are you now. You took all that hurt and instead of it letting it crush you, you let it make you stronger and the fact that you can't see that is
"Nap," he declared firmly, gently flopping onto the bed with Steve and closing his eyes.  He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
Over the next week, Tony's train of thought was more disjointed than usual, with lots of off-handed mentions of his parents.  Clearly, it was weighing on his mind. However, Tony wasn't someone who was forthcoming about things that bothered him. Case in point: he hadn't told a soul when his arc reactor was failing.  He had hid that he was dying, so it wasn't at all surprising that he also refused to talk about how he was feeling. According to Pepper, he was one of the most emotionally constipated people she'd ever met.
Steve found he liked Gideon Malick even less than Pierce, but he still greeted him with a smile and a handshake. This was all about pleasantries after all, wasn't it? Irshad did not put on a smile for either of them, however. Steve admired her for that.  He wasn't sure why he didn't like these men and supposed it might just been a natural wariness around older male Alphas.  This wasn't unlike the last time he had been at the White House; Howard Stark and Franklin Roosevelt had got ragingly drunk together while Steve had sat, bored, in a corner.  No one had served him alcohol because of his status and despite his size he had felt small.
Tony looked at Steve, feeling a bit defensive.  "Yeah.  Sure.  Of course I can handle this, it's just a simulation, right?" he said breezily.  Years of feigning confidence in everything had made it second nature.  "Let's just get it over with, seriously, I wan to hurry up so I can go get a drink."
"He's useless Steve. You're not going to get anything else out of him." Natasha sighed, nudging the older beta with the butt of her gun. The touch was almost gentle. "Cooperate and you won't end up like that." The scientist nodded frantically.
A pause.  Tony nodded, looking down at the egg on the floor.  He wiped his hand on his pants. "...yeah," he said quietly.  "...but that's not his fault. Me and him are okay."
This wasn't nearly as bad as Nadine had warned him.  Tony gave Steve a couple of good prods; Steve's body resisted and then there was that familiar feeling of give, and Tony shoved his length inside his omega's hole; Steve was moist, not exactly wet, there had been no foreplay, but that wasn't really what this was about anymore, it wasn't about intimacy or love-making, it was just about satisfying a deep, primal desire, and in that way it was perfect.
"I'm just saying.  Worst case scenario.  If HYDRA was experimenting on your mate and found out he was your mate... maybe they found a way to recreate parts of him, simulate his smell or something."
Richard patted his arm.  "Sure thing. You just take it easy for now.  No pushing yet. Make sure you stay hydrated and I'll check in every hour, okay?  So far, everything looks great. Congratulations, Donner."
"I don't know," he admitted.  "...because... you and I... are... were... are?... we bonded."  He glanced up, then down again. He knew about Steve's neck. He'd seen it.  His bonding mark was gone, replaced with a new one. He didn't know whether it had been forced or not.
With some directions from Tony, Steve got them to the restaurant.  It was more or less due south; the ocean was on their right and it was a magnificent sight.  The restaurant was right on the coast and offered a spectacular view of it. They didn't have reservations, but considering who they were, they didn't really need any.  They slipped into the parking lot of a small Italian place.  Tony got out and watched as Steve fumbled with the fob to lock the car.  Steve might never be completely at home in this century, but he was learning.
be something to it, I have a dirty ass car and a face that little old ladies can’t say no to.” He places a card and a rolled bundle of paper into her palm.
“There was a brief… not summary, to be clear, but a brief message from Romanov asking to check in on Stark. That there was something he said before she left—”
A rush of static and deep breathing breaks his musings, the speakers in the workshop tweaking the signal for less interference and better resolution. The only line that had a direct uplink to the Tower, much less Tony’s work room was the Avenger’s communication lines; Tony had hacked into the S.H.I.E.L.D. database and cross-wired the satellite signals so that JARVIS could also pick up on the intercom.
It would be smart to call Xavier or Frost, ask them for their prognosis but Charles is stuck somewhere back in time with Magneto and Frost is over at Russia doing her whole scary blonde lady that can melt your brain with a sneeze-routine.
“Sir, there is a strange influx of paranormal activity in the state of Kansas; the energy signatures are a kin to those encountered in the movie theater. There has been a ninety-seven percent image relation between a woman seen on a gasoline station’s camera and the image of the Enchantress I have stored.
“Yessir, I believe Master Odinson has just arrived and is on the garage level. Would you have me send him here?”
Wanda nods and moves the hand not currently rubbing her head to her neck. Clint stands nearby for a few more seconds before he clears his throat for the young woman's attention. Wanda finally deigns to open her eyes and something about Clint's face--no, not his face,
: (means "never withering")a symbol of immortality by the Greeks because it is dry and remains live for a long time (and was said to be rejuvenated when placed in water)
“In the meantime,” Jarvis piped up and Steve would deny that he jumped, “I have some video feeds from last night and some information that Master Tony had requested me to have formed and separated—they are ready. Would you like to view them?”
"There is a bigger threat," he says at last, weighting the pros and cons of letting a civilian—albeit a civilian very well in the know—about his information. Not all, though. "It's coming soon. One of the mechanisms Stark and Banner made on the original Helicarrier has pinged a few locations of energy signals closely related to the Tesseract. According to the readings, a few more of these... otherworldly items have appeared on earth on three separate occasions."
let you harm him, you will not lay hand nor sight on Thor Odinson!” Loki bellows and the torn and burnt red curtains hanging limply beside the screen suddenly hisses to life and begins to craw off the wall, slithering towards the tall blonde.
that speaking in the open about what was bothering him would be close to impossible. The hands clenching the ledge tighten and a nearly mute groan emits from the appliance. Steve wills his hands to loosen their grip and he looks uneasily towards the living room vicinity.
They’ve been lucky, so far, swapping out a person to watch Wanda and make sure she stays hydrated and somewhat nourished. Its almost impossible to get coherent thoughts from her, although she had a worrying headache that had caused her nose to bleed almost non-stop for an hour or so a few times the first two days.
ordinary?” She tilts the gun to point directly at the God’s face and fingers the trigger seductively. Loki’s eyes widen as a sliver of electric blue winks at him from within the chamer.
There are some things Tony has missed since he had gone AWOL. With Ross standing there, presenting his fury with supposed failures, he supposes that it is to be expected. He hadn’t
Natasha sighs and lowers the receipt into her left pocket, picking up her napkin as she does so. When she places her napkin on top of her plate, the Waitress walks by and offers Natasha her check unless she would like anything else on the menu. Natasha thanks her as she picks up the plate and utensils from the countertop.
“I’m just going to pretend I know what you just said—Thor, we need to know what we’re up against.” Tony replies, landing on top of a smoky and charred liquor store. There are a few strange creatures that look like wisps of smoke, thick white smoke that took the form of women, thin and tall, elegant and majestic but all the while they screeched and brought up chunks of concrete with only their faint, opaque hands.
“Any leads,” Ross corrects, “as an act of good faith. So we know that the… Avengers that remained do, in fact, show loyalty to their country and not loyalty in their fugitive members.”
getting sick, or else this was something much worse. He hadn’t felt this sort of… stuffiness in his brain since, since…
He’s in a marshland, walking over the gray-green water. Smoke rises around him, a thick fog that leaves nothing but the muddy water under his Converse. The air is damp and still, eerie in its desolateness. Tony continues walking, though, lets the buzzing at the base of his skull lead him forward, to turns and twists in an intangible road. The tall reed-like grasses that rise from the waters sway in a wind that does not exist.
“Tony,” Steve chokes out and he’s still on his knees, just above Tony’s shins, arms bracing Tony’s biceps in his previous effort to lift the scientist. “Tony, we can’t do this. Don’t do this to me,” He whispers and Tony closes his eyes, lets out a shuddery breath. Steve moves, shifts to back away but Tony is right there with him, filling the space Steve leaves behind with a sort of urgency that tightens his throat.
There, on the counter of his workshop table, a letter. In the pocket of his sweats, a phone he would never use.
“I’m here to formally let you… Avengers know what’s in the works. A sort of… superhuman registration, I suppose. And it is gaining in followers in powerful positions, who have seen the results of event trying to restrain one of our own. I’m here to warn you that… it is coming. And its being written as I stand here. However, if we were to meet halfway, well…”
Tony isn’t used to this, this sort of motherly-caring figure. He’s in the house and following Missouri before he’s even consciously aware and she’s chatting away niceties like another good host, not babbling at his feet and what-not. It’s… nice. It’s relaxing.
He hears Tony yell once, only once, and as he finally gets free from Loki’s bloody grasp the building collapses.
Vision smiles faintly, taking the cup back, “I suppose I believed that would go without saying, but perhaps hearing it is just as calming: yes, there has been complete integration, and although your ribs will ache for quite some time, the new reactor will hold nicely. Friday and I have already mapped out, along with Helen, a sort of exercise regime to help you calibrate with the nanites.”
It was almost an exact replica of the arc reactor, the dimensions where a little off and it was a few inches bigger than the one currently in his chest. The inside was hollow, though, and there was no space for the Vibranium though, and the hollow area seemed to have some inner depressions at odd intervals. Tony sighs, puts the model down atop the pile of actual notes and leans back.
“I don’t care if you’re going through the video files for what happened in Vienna,” a female voice says from behind Shuri. “And I am here on my own volition. You leave… not much in terms of presence, or even a signature. It was hard coming here.”
“My testimony of Siberia,” Tony says, right hand tapping on his chest, eyes going glazed, “or a… paper trail, of sorts, to clear me of the breakout and my whereabouts during.” Tony’s breath hitches when he meets Ross’s eyes, and he hates how this blindsides him, makes his chest ache worse than the new reactor.  “Or—”
Pepper starts, voice lower. They have not moved past the wall, instead they speak just beyond the threshold. Just beyond what Fury wants to know and fears he does already. "There was no blackmail; your issue is in seeing every Avenger as your little SHIELD agents: no morality, no conscious, and ready to obey orders. Tony? For all the crap SHIELD and the US Government has thrown at him, is
“You and Jarvis both; I swear you’re consulting together against me.” Tony sighs and Steve lets out a light chuckle. He's trying hard to come up with possibilities to get out of resting to check the feeds but for now there's no loop-hole to snake his way through. Damn it all. “Alright, c’mon.” Tony outstretches his arms. “You’re gonna need a ride. Last I checked Captain America could beat up Nazis, not fly.”
She sees the scepter. In her mind, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker is whispering in her ear words she cannot hear but feels. The scepter glows ominously. The Hydra Agent that was sitting across from her at the table looks startled. He speaks to her, too, shouts that she recognizes but can't hear. He looks at Strucker, and Strucker speaks to him in a language Wanda doesn't understand. The Agent, angry but mollified, sits once more although each angle of his strained body screams tension. Wanda wipes the tears from her eyes as Strucker motions with his hand at the Agent once more. He moves back, back, and Wanda notes distantly that with the scepter activated somehow from a distance she can still feel the extra presence in the room.
“After the destruction of the German airport, we tried to make contact with the creators of the Ant-Man suit,” Ross shrugs. “There had been some files not completely scrubbed from the SHIELD-slash-HYDRA file dumb about one Hank Pym and his work with SHIELD both as a scientist and as an agent. I hope the name at least sounds a little familiar, I think they had some history with your father Howard Stark.” Ross cocks an eyebrow at Tony, “not a good relationship, according to what we were able to find and trace back. When we went looking for them to…
“Fiiiiiiine,” Tony sighs, looking on blankly as Thor begins to spin Mjolnir, ready to take off; Natasha is already in the helicopter cabin on the receiver with someone that is most likely Fury, hopefully to get a perimeter set up in case Amora hasn't fled the surrounding area yet; Spiderman is just standing by idly and Steve is leaning against the helicopter.
so don’t act like you didn’t know there would be some time away. Now, I’m gonna need Clint to take us there, and when we get there,
“I knew you would come,” Amora hisses, stomping down the open door of the warehouse, eyes wide and glassy, fists clenching and unclenching at her sides. “You cannot take Thor! He is mine, not
“I think it would be better,” Vision says softly, “If Colonel Rhodes were to accompany me, if that is alright.” There is a pause, like everyone inhaled at the same time.
Tony struggled against his invisible restraints, felt a swell of anxiety and feebleness settle in the core of his being and continued to fight each movement. He watches as he sits up fully, his hand moving forward in slow jerks and finally extends fully. That’s when a strong, warm hand grips his wrist and a impossibly relieved Captain comes into his view.
things. Things with Thor. And Steve. And apples and dominoes and metal. Things with fire and pain and, well, none of that matters right now, not at the moment, because he’s comfortable and there is nothing more important than this moment, somewhere between life and death and the fight and defeat.
Tony takes his time clicking the armor back in, piece by piece, murmuring different codes to unravel the system overrides; the different components start to click back into place, skimming up his bare chest until he’s finally standing in his mostly re-formed armor.
“There is still information I will need,” Vision says carefully, “before I can give you anything with certainty. However, as the time has presented itself now rather than later, there is some… may I run something by you, Colonel Rhodes?”
“I’m… I hear he is quite like his father. At least, in appearance and madness.” Was the first thing Ironman had ever replied. Steve stayed still, a little shell-shocked, sure, but mostly thinking. On the short occasions he had spent with Tony Stark, for his bi-weekly
“Lo and behold, all of our greatest technicians can find no calls made, no kind of message in their system. Nothing. It doesn’t even look like Scott Lang contacted them, either, after interrogating his ex-wife and daughter.”
But I'm not the one you want to talk to," Pepper chirps up, her demeanor shifting into professionality. "You wish to speak to Mr. Stark. Come," she says, standing up and turning her back without noting if fury was really following her orders.
Loki swings his left arm into it, twines the whip around his wrist three times and yanks forward, throwing Enchantress off balance.
See, Steve didn’t know that. In fact, only three people know of the AI’s initial programming and that’s limited to the other scientists that Tony trusts with his life: Peter, Bruce and Reed. Don’t get Tony wrong—he trusts Hank McCoy with his life, it’s just that the mutant prefers to be visited and never makes house calls. Hence Steve’s surprise when, after tucking Tony into an empty medical room in the top floor of the building, the aforementioned scientist lumbered through the doorway with a book bag slung across his shoulder.
Tony closes his eyes with a groan as the metal digs a little deeper and feels Steve’s gloved hands frame his cheeks and pull his head back up.
“You’re at least five city blocks away from me, I’m closer to Spidey anyway. There’s this theatre that’s looking run down, a tree burning in front but no heat signature; the Jarvis reported a signal scrambler so I haven’t heard from Spiderman since his first transmission. I’m going in; you guys regroup and come on by.” Tony starts taking his first measured steps toward the main entrance, studying the shuffling wraiths that are standing along the patches of grass, laying and sitting or standing but fretting nonetheless, looking on with blank faces as Tony steps past rubble and collapsed buildings.
It was only in the last twenty years or so that bonding had begun to have legal repercussions.  It was such an inherent part of the social dynamic that legislating it had been nearly impossible.  Even though omegas and Alphas could legally break a bond, doing so physically was, as far as Tony was aware, impossible for omegas.  Alphas were the only ones who could sever it, and even then, it was known to be a difficult thing.  A divorce did not mean the bond, and the ability to feel each other, went away.
Peggy pulled Steve into a fierce hug before she let him go. She gave him a good squeeze and then finally released him, raising a hand to cup his cheek tenderly before reluctantly pulling back. "I will always be grateful that our paths crossed again," she said in a murmur, a smile tugging at her lips. Then she looked between the two of them. "Now you two look after each other. It's a mean world out there."
The last half-hour had passed in a blur of music and dancing and interviews. One woman was asking Steve about his plans for the new year, hinting at babies. He'd just rolled his eyes fondly and told her: "I'm too busy trying to watch my own ass at the moment."
"Calm down, Tony.  Tom and Daston are both out looking.  You two aren't supposed to go anywhere without a detail, remember?"
be happening. Steve was powerless. He was wearing fucking yoga pants and trainers. He couldn't even breathe properly. His limbs felt heavy, too heavy too move, and he blinked blearily. This couldn't be happening. This couldn't be real. He tried to flinch away but he could barely move. Gideon's hand was clammy and cold. He hated it.
He wasn't given a choice; Tiberius Stone, Boswell Mackabee, Thomas Banksy, Brent Walker, and Jeffrey Walker entered with a lot of loud cheers and congratulations.
He was much, much more interested in what the psychologist had just said.  "Omegas can be forced into heat?" he asked.  Was this common knowledge?  Tony wasn't sure, but he was intrigued.
's like Twelve," said Nine, casting an enviable glance over.  She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "She was runner-up for Miss Illinois before they found out her status.  She was all doped up on suppressants trying to hide it. Snob. Her parents tried to send her to Shore's Breath but they were filled up."
doing something about it. My friend has book me something this evening," Steve said. "You don't need to convince me. She already did.  But I'm telling you, I don't have--"
Some of the other omegas, who were properly dressed and had heavier collars, were watching them with disdain. They clearly didn't approved of Lola's dirty Converse shoes up on the table.
get to him.  Yet he didn't miss the universally accepted notion that he was clearly not the primary Alpha.  People knew his dominance status was low, and their questions clearly indicated that. It made Tony feel like a piece of shit and, God, if he'd ever wanted a drink, it was now.  He was planning on getting well and properly hammered as soon as the cameras were off.
"That's right, guys, we're takin' it back!" yelled the DJ, and another familiar song was playing, again sped up, mixed to be a bright, poppy dance number, though Steve remembered it as a slow, sad song.   One he and Bucky had danced to, slowly, in their apartment, only a few nights before Bucky had left for Europe. It sounded strange and uncanny, being altered into a pop song.
bring up Howie right now. I swear to God. If I'd wanted him I would have had him. But I didn't. I chose you, and I knew how dominant you were when I did. I didn't even
"I'm not going anywhere." Steve kissed Tony's forehead, still running a hand through it's hair. "It's alright, Tony. Promise."
"You s-see their t-true c-colors--" the man on the ground said.  Steve pressed down on him and he let out a strangled cry of pain followed by a babble of words: "Please, please stop, they want the serum.  That's all I know, I swear, please... the others all died or went feral..."
he thought, beaming at them.  His friends.  So many friends he couldn't name them, didn't even know them all.
The collar looked brutal. Not deceivingly beautiful like all the gemmed and shiny collars at the conference. It looked heavy and oppressive and...inescapable.
He talked to Banksy in the last five minutes. The man was hyper with champagne and talking to him about his future ad with Status Alliance, which he clearly approved of. But then Steve felt Tony coming up behind him and he automatically leant into the touch, smiling at the hands around his waist. Steve turned around and took Tony's hands in his own. He ducked his head down to whisper in his ear. "You wanna head outside for this, or hang around for the show?"
Tony had expected the conversation to delve right into politics but it didn't.  In fact, it orbited madly around the subject without ever lighting. They chatted about all sorts of trivial bullshit all the way through the main course, with Steve wolfing down three full meals as politely as one could.
Steve blinked in surprise, watching Ty go with a strange feeling in his chest. Huh. He felt giddy and strange. He was glad he could something back to Tiberius, he guessed...even if it was like this. Steve didn't still quite get why the man didn't try to date betas.  But it wasn't Steve's place to ask.
Steve was making a lot of little noises that were very distinctively un-Captainly, but Tony found them encouraging.  "...you can cum, if you want," he said quietly. He leaned back down to lap at Steve's shaft before sliding it back into his mouth and giving it a long, slow pull, returning to bobbing his head.  Steve was squirming under him, his fists clenching and unclenching in the sand, his hips and thighs shivering under Tony. He was grateful that Steve wasn't thrusting, wasn't grabbing his hair or shoving him down, all things Tony had done to Steve without really thinking about it.  Tony may have been the more experienced one, but Steve was a much more considerate lover. But Tony had been sincere about wanting to be a better mate to him, more considerate. He knew he had a long way to go and there was a steep learning curve but... well, trying never hurt.
"...maybe it'll feel better tomorrow morning," suggested Tony.  "We'll all have breakfast and once it's daylight maybe Donner'll come to his senses.  ...come on, Steve." There was a small hint of rejection in his stomach that wasn't his.  "Steve, you sleep with me, in the master bedroom," said Tony quietly. "I need you," he added, because he got the sense that Steve was genuinely injured at not being included in Banksy's and George's little group.  It wasn't anyone's fault; Donner was simply too nervous to be around Steve.
She tore up the stairs and returned a moment later holding a pair of dogtags.  "Not Steve's!" she said excitedly, holding up a pair of dogtags. She punched in 7038; they keycard flashed green and all seven of them stumbled inside, slamming the heavy, bullet-proof door behind them.
"He's nothing like Clint," Steve hummed, gaze flitting over to Tony and the team around him until they stepped out of the room.
"It's a very good picture. Good likeness," Phil added, his voice a little more high pitched than usual. "Steve? Have you broken your hand? Looks painful."
"Tony. Mph..." Steve arched up into his touch and sighed sweetly. "I think-" His words were stunted again as he squeezed around Tony's fingers and stroked at his cock. Steve's own was hard and leaving a smear of precumagainst his stomach. "-we left the condoms by the pool side," he finally managed to get out in a soft huff of annoyance, breath hot against Tony's cheek.
it.  She was like a damn furnace of dominant hormones.  She was five feet of omega fury.  Tony and Steve towered over her, but she had a posture that demanded attention.
. Most of them were flashy and glitzy and made Steve feel physically ill. He wanted to wear collars to make a point, sure. But that didn't mean for one point he would enjoy this.
"I think you'll be glad to see her again," Steve said encouragingly. And he meant it. Even if Peggy was mad at Tony for something buried in their past...she wasn't a spiteful woman. Peggy was one of the most forgiving people he knew. She would be glad to see Tony, although she might give him a stern talking to about Yemen. But Steve was certainly in deeper shit than Tony over that. After all, he'd promised her he'd stay out of trouble then walked straight into HYDRAs arms. Steve still wasn't entirely sure why he did that.
He rolled out of bed, still dressed his his jeans and button-up shirt from the day before; it was hopelessly wrinkled.  He swapped it out and bolted downstairs, struggling to yank a comb through his hair.
He traced the imprint of the circle with his finger.  "Sorry," he said.  He gave another experimental tug.  Still knotted.  Not that he expected anything different after fifteen seconds.  It didn't feel bad, really.  Actually it felt pretty damn nice.  A sort of added dimension to post-coital cuddling.
"--Stark?  You feeling better?" asked Natasha hesitantly into her comm.  She was in their line of sight but she was still keeping her distance and had Steve's shield up, ready to duck behind in case Tony fired at her again.
"My ma got lots of offers. People target single mothers; they know how desperate their situations can be," Steve shrugged. "And if a mother is struggling to provide for her kid, why wouldn't she want him to get an Alpha, you know? In theory, it should be better."
Agent Simmons complied, and the two of them burst into the ER examination room just as Dr. McCloud was holding an X-ray up to the light.
"I'm only into Alphas," said Sam, still pressed into the corner.  A pause, then he added, almost embarrassed, "I can't help... this.  It's a reflex."
Steve swallowed.  Working for Tony meant also working for Pepper in turn.  And it was a nightmare, because each of them was constantly pulling him in entirely opposite directions.
He pushed those feelings aside.  He and Steve were bonded, and they were public about it, and that was that.  HYDRA was messing with his head somehow; maybe they'd found a way to hijack bonding to torture people psychologically; Barnes was dead, and there was no use worrying about him.
The stones were large blocks of marble, surprisingly tasteful.  The date of death for Howard and Maria was the same, March 15th, 1986.  Their inscriptions were fairly basic. Maria was "loving wife and mother," Howard was a "patriot; relentlessly inspiring, uncompromisingly brilliant."
He flopped back down into the bed.  "You don't have to stay in bed all day with me," he said quietly.  "I just wanna nap for a while. 'Night, Steve." Just like that, his enthusiasm was off like a light switch.
Tony sulked.  He was remembering now why he hadn't wanted to talk to Peggy after his parents' death.  She had too many fond memories of Howard, someone Tony would probably always resent. Obadiah had known about Howard's drinking, how angry he'd been later in life.  Peggy's memories were kinder, gentler, and they didn't mesh with Tony's view. He had no fond memories of his father and even if he had, they wouldn't have made up for the fact that Tony held Howard personally responsible for the car accident that had killed him and Maria.  Tony was certain he'd been drunk and that it was Howard's selfish self-pity that had made Tony lose his parents.
"I'm...working on something. But I can't promise you results, Captain; you're one of a kind. The only way to find out if it works is to... do it, or take it. So to speak. SHIELD actually approached me, offered me resources to find a solution."
Stop being cute.  Stop making me like you.  Ever since you showed up in my life I've felt weird and I
; Tony had mostly pushed for it because the cast included Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who was No. 8 on his To-Screw list).
Then there was his sister, her eyes blazing red, and her mouth was moving too, her words coming out as spiky black liquid metal, sinking to the ground and splashing into nothingness.
Tony reached out for Steve's hand to get him to hold still.  "...you know, otters hold hands when they sleep, to keep from floating away from each other," he informed Steve lazily.  He'd heard that on a nature documentary he'd watched, half-stoned, during his time in Colorado. A pause. "...they also rape baby seals to death, apparently.  And collect rocks. ...a funny animal, the otter." He stifled a contented yawn. The warmth of the pool was relaxing.
Tony spared a glance at Steve, whose head was down, like a child being scolded.  But his attention was drawn back to Phil, who had begun shredding up a stack of
"Hey," said Tony softly.  "I'm gonna pull out."  He squirmed under Steve, rolling them over onto their sides and tugging; after a few seconds of slow strain, it managed to work out the knot.  He didn't pull away any more, though; he stayed on the floor, holding Steve in his arms.  "...we'll be fine.  Whatever they ask," he said, a bit more confidently.  "We're awesome, right?  Our bond is awesome.  You're awesome, I'm awesome... yeah.  It'll be fine."  He kissed Steve's shoulder again.
Howard Stark's death was an assassination made to look like an accident, but that was known only to a select few.  The local police had closed it long ago; only in the deepest depths of SHIELD's archives was there any documentation on it.  Steve doubted even Natasha knew.  The investigation had remained untouched but had never been closed because no assassin had ever claimed credit for it.  Could it have been the Winter Soldier?
"Okay, fine, I admit it, he's my friend, he stayed the night," lied Tony.  "His name's Nick.  He's not on crack, though.  He's just a friend."
The day had been emotionally draining as it was. A few hours break before dinner might do them good and Steve knew the collar was making Tony uncomfortable; the other kept tugging at it without realising. Steve felt bad. He was kind of the one who put it there.
He was so dedicated to his task he nearly walked right in to a room full of people.  Steve quickly ducked out of the way and stuck his head around the doorway. He blinked, eyes widening. There were at least a half-dozen men clustered around a chair, all Alphas, arguing loudly in Russian and German and English.  Steve's skin crawled at the sound of the German.  The chair they were clustered around held a slumped-over man with long hair.  A prisoner?
"Okay, okay, I'll slow down," grumbled Tony, who had no real intention of doing so.  "So.  You and Au--
A lump welled up in the back of Steve's throat. "Thanks Nat. Look, I gotta go. I'll talk to you soon, yeah?"
"...because I wasn't dominant enough.  ...fortunately, if you look at the math, you'll see that, in the grand scheme of things, it no longer matters.  Seventeen hundred women. Three men. Ratio-wise we're talking a tenth of a percent, and every woman means that ratio gets closer and closer to zero.  Mathematically, I can wipe it out. I can fix it. Obviously, being with Steve, I'm currently in a lull, but I think, after behaving myself for over half a year, I've earned a couple of flings."
the answers are in my head... I just hate waiting," whined Tony impatiently.  He swiped Steve away from his forehead. "And I wasn't a sap until I met you. You ruined me, Rogers.  You and your incredible, all-American omega body."
"After Tony. I know," Steve said, a little shaky as he put the glass back on the side. Ty grabbed a pillow and placed it behind his head so he could lie back against the headboard. "Jesus," he whispered. "I know they wanted Tony dead but I...I didn't think they'd come this far to do it." Steve dropped his hands back down in his lap. "Christ.  ...I told them they had to start anew. That killing Tony would achieve nothing. But they just wouldn't goddamn listen, would they?" Steve's hands curled into fists. "Did SHIELD take them?"
"Got to be careful. You've got nice hands. Don't want to hurt your hands, Steve." It was interesting. Phil seemed far more concerned with Steve than any of the Alphas in the room, despite being in heat.
Tony staggered into the kitchen, suddenly aware he'd had the whole conversation with Gleason barefoot, in his underwear.
obedient... well, she can be a bit headstrong.  I'm afraid lately she's been a bit of a handful because of all this nonsense over Steve Rogers.  She's got a
They were in a store, one with bright lights that reflected on the tile floors and aisles and aisles of metal shelving with just about everything you could imagine.
Sure enough, Tony was down in the shop struggling to wrench open the valve on an oxygen tank; he had the wrench fixed and was pulling with his entire body weight on it, the muscles in his arms popping, but he'd been awake all night and exhaustion was starting to set in.  He half-smelled, half-sensed a familiar presence; he looked up to see Steve.
Steve wasn't sure what to think about Tony in a collar. He didn't really feel anything. The man could wear anything and make it seem natural, especially once the sunglasses were slid into place. They both looked good, regardless of what they wore on their necks.
with my bosses, Mr. Stark,” he replied coolly, eyes narrowing a fraction to try and ensure that Tony would, in fact, drop the issue.  “...and Virginia would really like you to try and sleep… sir,” he added.
The next sheet has a drawing, a literal illustration. There’s a hand that’s outstretched, the cross-hatching making each finger stand out, each little shade exact; in its palm is a box, small and incurious with light edge protectors, some sort of swirling on its surface that is lighter than the cube itself. There’s a neat scrawl in the bottom, not his own messy chicken-scratches but neater and slants slightly.
They’re walking together and talking about more myths and Thor’s worry about his mother’s ailing health when everything stops.
There are ashes falling from the sky like putrid, rancid snow. The once clean air is tainted with the foul stench of burnt
Suddenly he blinks and Tony isn't in the lab anymore. There are golden apples and a frail looking blonde woman holding her arms out like branches, the green sheer fabric draped over her arms moves and rustles like leaves; she's naked besides the transparent cloth but Tony can't pull his gaze away from her inhuman violet-sapphire eyes.
-- The entire floor had been changed. Where at least four single apartments filled the entire floor, all the walls but one at the far end had been stripped down to their support columns and bare wirings, plastic covering as much of the walls, ceilings, and floor as possible.
, smugness, too, on top of everything. Rhodey turns to Tony while patting his own chest with a quick shake of his head.
Enchantress flicks her right arm and the room drops in temperature, the air between the two Asgardians charged with something like static electricity. Loki’s palms bleed continuously, the skin gnarled and peeling around the base of his fingers. He grins, feels the blood thrumming through his body even as his palms begin to heal themselves, and widens his stance for an attack. Amora does not disappoint, lashing out with a tendril of crimson energy at Loki like a whip.
"I need to swap the core.  Let's grab my dad's shit and let's go.  I have extras in the shop," he ground out.
He paused for a moment to look him over.  Steve was a walking contradiction. His arms were the size of a normal man's thigh, and when he wore plain t-shirts, which he often did, the shirts clung to the outlines of his pectoral muscles.  He was taller than Tony, bulkier, yet still so distinctively
At the same moment, Steve's head snapped up.  It was like they were perfectly in sync again.  Wanda had told Bucky it would get easier to feel him, but still, it was nothing like it had been in the forties.  Bucky felt like it was purely serendipity that he'd somehow found Steve.
It was a peace offering.  Hanley's had been Bucky's go-to escape bar whenever he and Steve got into a fight.  Now that they allowed omegas, he and Steve could go together. Bucky was hoping they wouldn't fight anymore.  A lot of their arguments had revolved madly around Steve's health: his inability to mate, to do things for himself, to go out... now that he was healthy, now that he was big and muscular and hardy, hopefully none of those old issues would come into play.  Poor Steve had spent his whole life arguing with Bucky about what he
At the sound of Pepper's real name, Tony lost his footing and  fell off the table.  Fortunately, Rhodes had been expecting it, and he managed to snag Tony and break his fall; he dragged Tony away from the painting and practically pushed him into a chair.  "Haven't you taken enough hits?  ...Captain, how's the shoulder doing?"
He stared at her, confused about why she was trying to help him.  He glanced over at Karpov, but Karpov was busy. They were in a hotel room in a small town by the sea and Karpov had been arguing on the phone with someone for several minutes.
"No, thank you."  She watched as he pried the lid of a Styrofoam cup and stirred in some creamer.  She liked him quite a bit better that Jasper Sitwell, that was for sure. "After Steve's heat, is the surveillance team going to be lifted?"
He doubted the tesseract was worth worrying about.  Tony was all about alternative energy.  SHIELD sounded like they had it under control; Steve was overreacting.
"I need a nap now," said Donner, quietly, looking miserable.  He gave Steve a very gentle push away, more of a suggestion than anything.  "Will you wake me up when Giddy comes? I have to see him."
"I know you can do this Tony," Steve whispered, giving him an encouraging look, blue eyes genuine. "Really, don't look so stressed. You've got this," he said simply, voice soft and gentle. "Just...go save your life and then you can go back to being mad at me," Steve joked weakly with a half smile before stepping back as Tony got the contraption ready to create his new molecule. Atom?  Whatever.  One of the unfortunate effects of being frozen for sixty-five years is that Steve had the equivalent of a third-grade education and was desperately struggling to catch up on all the science, literature, and history he'd missed.
Tony had done plenty of these after Afghanistan, and plenty more after the debut of Iron Man.  He'd gotten good at condensing big ideas into easy-to-digest ten-minute segments that various news outlets snatched up, chopped up, and aired ad nauseum.
He sighed. He reached down wordlessly and picked the Alpha up. Steve unlocked the door and put Tony in bed, tucking him in gently. He didn't know how to feel. He felt numb and humiliated. He should have known he'd just be another notch on the bedpost. Steve felt like an idiot. Sure, he wasn't expecting Tony to propose. But he also wasn't expecting him to immediately want to date other women and talk about it in front of him. He wasn't prepared to be an accessory in Tony's life, another Jarvis. It wasn't the forties. And maybe he was biased, but triad relationships always put omegas on the bottom (pun not intended).  He would never be first choice. And Steve didn't want his relationship to become a competition.
He was treading lightly around Steve, still guilty.  Their relationship had taken on a strange sort of shyness.  Tony had stolen a peek at Steve's neck in the car. It was no long red and swollen and shiny.  It was healing rapidly. It was hard to say yet, but Tony felt like the mark looked different than it had, and he was steeling himself against the very likely possibility that the mark there would no longer be the familiar shape of his own bite mark.
Tony sank onto the nearest sofa, still covered in dust from his disastrous birthday party; it creaked and then broke, depositing him onto the floor.  He snorted at the situation.  He decided to handle it the way he always did. By drinking.  He'd have a nice little breakdown and maybe, with time, he'd go back to feeling his usual numbness.  His usual shallow sense of superiority.  And maybe, with time, maybe he'd get lucky and forget Steve entirely.
"He's okay," said the soldier.  "He says he heals fast. No hard feelings."  His tone had lightened and sounded more human, with far less of the flat, child-like voice he'd had earlier.
And even if they did, Tony could never run after Steve, not with Phil and Natasha and Barton watching.
Steve's blue eyes shot up at the question. "You are an ass. A massive one," he agreed bluntly. "But there's a lot more to you than that. I've met a lot of utter assholes in my time." Now that much was true. "And even if they paid me ten times as much as you do, I still wouldn't work for them. This is probably one of the most rewarding but most stressful jobs I've ever done." Also true. "I wouldn't have done it without good reason. I like believing in things. I like believing in people." He could almost hear Nat telling him to 'tone down the Captain America' in his head. "If you weren't a good person, I wouldn't be here," Steve said simply.  "Though, for the record, if you ever say I'm
Steve didn't want to face off with Gideon or anything like that. He wanted to simply prove that he was wrong, and shouting at him certainly wouldn't achieve that.  He walked into the crowd, head held high, trying to maintain a quiet sort of dignity.
Malick cleared his throat loudly.  "Considering they are bonded, I don't believe we can rely solely on Rogers's word not to--"
"Mhm. It was just to help me to sleep at night on the bad days; she of course didn't really know...but when I found out I wasn't even surprised. Why should any of us be?"
"The wall needs to be gone, huh?" Steve moved to grab the shield prototype and felt his hands along the wall. "I'm on it." He hesitated a moment and cocked his head, eyes narrowing. "Hm." Then Steve drew his hand with the shield back and promptly shoved the thing straight through the wall. It groaned and hissed in protest but Steve soon knocked another significant hole through the wall as he slammed the shield through it again. And then again and again and again. Plaster and flecks of paint soon littered the floor as Steve systematically tore down the wall piece by piece like it was no more inconvenient than a layer of thick cardboard.
Steve was trying to pretend he wasn't nervous. Before he knew what he was doing he was reaching over and taking Tony's hand. "Tony." He was trying to focus on his breathing and keeping it calm. Steve swallowed. Jesus, why was he so nervous?
He winced a little when he felt Tony tense at the pain. "Sorry." Steve pulled out gauze tape next, fixing up the wound before carefully wrapping a strip of bandage around Tony's palm. It felt good to do this...to look after him. Maybe he wasn't Steve's Alpha, but he was still his friend.
Tony decided in an instant he was done with the conversation and reached behind Steve's ear to press on his scent gland.
