"True," Freeman said. "But it's a risk we'll have to take." Natasha didn't seem convinced but nodded anyway. Freeman looked to the rest of the group. "Remember, just relax and be yourselves. The public wants to get to know the Avengers. I know we've been stressing over worst-case scenarios, but we also don't want you to be uptight and guarded. Just smile and be at ease. It will make the process go much easier."
"I'm doing this as a favor to Lara," Romanoff explained. "So, if you don't want to talk to me, that's fine, but let me do what I promised to do."
"Steve, you can come to me with anything, anytime," Tony said. "Even if I am stressed and going through my own emotional crisis, I'll still listen. He covered Steve's hand with both of his. "Capuche?" Steve nodded.
"Yes," Rawls said. Tony began to mentally prepare himself for the worst. "The bad news is that the strep test came back positive. We'll get you on a round of antibiotics to treat that right away." Tony nodded, urging her to get on with it. "The good news is that the HIV test came back negative." Tony and Pepper let out simultaneous breaths of relief with Tony falling back against the pillows, a broad grin on his face.
"Besides," Steve continued. "It's not like sending poison through the mail world work anyways. The Postal Service would catch something like that, right?" Tension filled the room as the other three Avengers hesitated to respond.
"Still," Tony said. "You are pretty spry for an older fellow." The annoyance Steve was feeling only increased as he noticed Tony's eyes slowly travel up and down his body.
Steve gave a small nod, walked over to the chair by Tony's bedside, and sat down. The chair was more comfortable that he was expecting but found that he couldn't quite relax into it. Looking at Tony, he made eye contact with the other man who was looking at him through heavy eyelashes and was running his tongue over his top lip. For a moment, the sight was enough to ease his mind, but then the same avalanche of worried thoughts came crashing down.
"Loud and clear, Sir." Tony let out a breath of relief he didn't know he'd been holding. "I feel it is imperative that I inform you that armed intruders…"
Not wanting to worry her best friend, Carol didn't share her concerns with her. Though she did try to keep as close to the truth as possible.
Sitting back down in front of the mirror, Adoniram stared himself down. He then turned his gaze to the yellow legal pad in front of him. He spent all night working on this speech, with a little insight from Marx. Although this would be the standard run-through of the procedure, he liked changing up the foreword speech every time. It kept things from getting too dull. He read through the address one last time before he got up and proceeded to the backstage area.
She smirked to herself for a moment before the top of the tower started to come up underneath her. Now was the time. She let go of the alien she'd been controlling and threw herself off the bike. She timed it just right but wished she had stuck the landing a little better as she tumbled across the gravel roof. She knew she was going to have scrapes and bruises in odd places when she woke up the next day, but then again who here wasn't?
"Your ambition is little," the Other growled. "And born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil."
Steve wanted to feel terrible for the thought, but he couldn't bring himself to. That woman had tried to hurt him. She had tried to hurt his friends and almost succeeded on one account. Most importantly, though, she had tried to hurt Tony. That was enough to breed enough hate in Steve's heart to even consider doing something so heinous.
"The Black Widow," Sharpton remarked. "I really hoped it'd be you who opened the letter, you murderous bitch."
"No," she said. "They actually went perfectly. The judge gave me a six-month extension on the protection order, so I won't have to worry about that for a bit."
. Not only did she probably have the reign it in for the major network, but Tony also already had a less-than-stellar relationship with the company since the botched Stark Tower interview. They probably asked her to take it easy on him, not wanting a repeat of that incident. Tony didn't mind. If the reporter did what she was supposed to, he didn't see the interview going too bad, even with their history.
Thor's eyes went wide as he turned to look around. Apparently, he'd gotten so caught up in the battle, he forgot to take note of where he left his brother. Steve did his best not to let his aggravation get to him.
"The girls weren't home at the time!" Desperation was starting to sink in. "Besides, the explosions were contained to the basement. I made sure of it." He then rolled up his sleeves to reveal several severe-looking burns on his hands and arms. The social worker just kept the same cold expression on her face.
It all came to an end, though, when a blonde woman suddenly walked into the room. It sounded like she was in the middle of apologizing for stealing a spare key or something, but she stopped dead when she realized that Tony wasn't in bed by himself. She then slowly backed out of the room with eyes as wide as headlights and shut the door. From what he could hear, it sounded like she immediately turned, went down the stairs, and bolted out of the house.
She spent an extra hour in bed, trying to decide what to do. Eventually, she had to relent that she was too tired and gave up trying to convince herself otherwise. She took her phone off the charger and called in sick. Luckily, she had barely touched her allotted amount of sick days since she started at Stark Industries so there was no way she'd be penalized for it. She also sent texts to Tony, Bruce, and Pepper. In each one she just explained what was going on and asked for updates if they were available. Once that was done, she pulled her cat, Telemachus, close to her and closed her eyes, hoping that sleep would come to her.
That was all she needed to hear. Within seconds she had bounded out of the restaurant whose Wi-Fi she was stealing and was heading to her car on the warpath to Lennox. Turns out the more traditional forms of media could be useful after all.
"What the hell," he found himself exclaiming. He rushed to slip the shorts off him, but gravity ended up doing all the work for him. The shorts hit the ground, staying in their solid shape, not even cracking. Thankfully, he had remembered to wear underwear. Stepping out of his new shorts sculpture, Knežević looked around for an explanation for what might have caused this. However, nothing immediately came to him. The only thing that had even touched the shorts were his hands…
"Ah, sir, would you mind stating your name again?" The operator asked. "Just for the record. I didn't catch it the last time." Tony rolled his eyes.
"I didn't mean an actual prison break," Tony said. "I don't even want to imagine what S.H.I.E.L.D. would do to me if I tried that." Steve could hear Tony audibly shudder. No, I was thinking more along the lines of convincing S.H.I.E.L.D. to let me take you out for a little while."
Then there was everyone else. Lara and Romanoff certainly had it out for him… After all the crap he'd pulled in the last twelve hours, there was no way they'd still let him be an Avenger… That was it. He had nothing. He was nothing but a sad, lonely drunk. If he had a drink, he'd indulge in the irony and toss it all back in one go, but he couldn't, and he knew he shouldn't. For the first time in months, his need for comfort was outweighing his need for alcohol. He'd give anything to both holds and be held by Steve. He just wished he hadn't run away before he reached that point.
"Sure," Duran said. "I can go back and ask one of the officers if she's been accounted for. What's her name?"
With that reminder, Tony turned his eyes to the window to see if the earthquake had caused any damage. That's when he saw the huge plume of smoke rising in the distance.
Sharing a brief look with Tony, Steve rushed to grab his shield and pull the cowl over his head. Tony put the helmet back on and it quickly snapped back to life. Steve watched as Tony hit a button on the wall and the Quinjet's rear hatch came open.
"Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?" Tony didn't notice that he had unconsciously put a hand on Steve's shoulder until the other man was batting it away.
Natasha was still trying to clip her Widow's Bites around her wrists and Steve was still pulling up some of the zippers on his uniform as they came running down the main hallway. Bruce stepped out of the lab just in time to intercept them.
"The move him in with the RCMP," Salinas said. "That's their job, isn't it; to keep an eye on things?"
"Thank you for the offer," Steve said. "But really, this is something I need to figure out for myself. Besides, I thought you said you wanted to lie down."
going to get the double bacon cheeseburger," Tony said. "I think out of those two, the regular cheeseburger is the healthier option." Pepper hardly tried to hide her eyeroll.
And welcome back lovely readers! I would be nice and offer you a recap of what happened in this story since it's been forty-four days since I updated this fic and you've probably forgotten, but unfortunately, I'm not that generous. Go back and read it yourself, you lazy-ass!
"Eight o'clock on the dot," she said. "Don't you dare be late. Understood?" Steve knew that he couldn't promise, not as certain death was rushing towards him.
"If she gave me an excuse, yes." Steve continued to look disapproving. Natasha finally gave up and looked over at him. "She tried to hurt us. She
The President started by addressing the events in New York and the United States' plans to recover from it, as well as working to create a better response to such events in the future. He also addressed the United States' military accomplishments against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, expressed their continued support for Israel and addressed the Arab Spring and the uprisings in Syria. Tony mostly tuned out after that. He could watch the highlights reel and get bullet points later. Instead, he found himself focusing on that mantra again.
"This'll only take a minute." Shrugging, Steve went over to pick up the chair (which was a bit too heavy for a normal person to carry on their own, but Steve could manage just fine) and brought it over to sit in front of the desk, facing Rhodes. A tense moment of silence passed before Steve finally spoke up.
"I wanted to apologize," she said slowly, carefully enouncing each syllable. "When you were drunk at the gala, I should not have screamed at you, and I especially should not have grabbed you and dragged you away. That was abusive and wrong, and for that, I am sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you at all."
When you grow up being told something is wrong or bad – no matter whether the thing in question truly is wrong or bad – the stigma of it tends to stick with you for a long time, sometimes even the rest of your life. When Steve was a child, homosexuality was illegal. If you got caught or were publicly outed, an arrest was the
"Regardless, his vital signs are stable for the moment." Carol stepped forward and started lifting Stark into her arms. "He's not going to die any time soon. I know a place we can go until you can get into contact with Fury. We can easily keep an eye on him there. With that, Carol leaped into the air and took off with Stark in tow. Jessica let out a scoff.
"I'm fine," Tony assured for what had to have felt like the billionth time that week. "I just need to get to bed."
Cranston whipped out a big planner notebook and they discussed what time would be convenient for both. They settled on Wednesday, February 22nd at two in the afternoon. Cranston wanted to put a bit of space between visits and off the top of his head, Tony didn't think he had any meetings at that time that day (he'd apologize to Lara later if he was wrong,) so it work out just fine. After that, they shook hands, exchanged pleasantries, and finally Tony could exit back out into the waiting room. The only thing that came as a sweeter relief than opening the door was seeing Steve on the other side.
"Like if I tried to ruin everyone's day by sneaking out again?" Tony's grim tone caused Steve to frown.
"Son of a gun." Steve couldn't have erased the smile from his face even if he tried. At that moment, internally, he was thanking everything known to creation for bringing Tony back. However, his gratefulness was quickly overshadowed by concern.
"I don't want to say goodbye to Tony," Steve said. "Not now, not ever. I've known since we first met that I wanted to protect him. That's why I was so scared at first. I didn't want anything to happen to him because of my inclinations."
She had never heard of the Strategic Homeland… Whatever the hell these people called themselves. It's not like she'd ever be able to remember that. She just knew they locked up people like her in this prison they called "the Fridge" and threw the key so far away, any hope she could possibly have of escaping was near impossible. It was like asking someone to run to the sun and back, it just couldn't be done. Her "powers" were suppressed by an unbreakable wristband. She couldn't escape people's notice anymore. She was stuck here.
The conversation went on for another good forty-five minutes. Tony told Steve a bit about how he had been captured in Afghanistan the previous year and the whole Iron Man story. Steve could tell that Tony left a few things out but didn't say anything about it. Obviously, he wasn't ready to share certain details with him (or anyone, really) so he didn't push.
At that point, it became clear why Lara asked Romanoff to fill in for her. It was because Lara took all of Tony's remarks about skipping the meeting seriously and she wanted someone to make sure he went. Looking back, he probably should have made it clearer that was joking. After all, he did understand that the longer he put off facing the board, the more upset they would be. As such, he was not going to avoid it any longer than he already had. However, it did irk him that Lara apparently thought he needed a babysitter. He was forty-one years old and he had been CEO of the company for nineteen years. He could take care of himself and accurately make decisions on what the best thing to do would be.
Getting in the elevator (which had apparently been fixed) Tony tried to reach around five other people to hit the button for his floor. A police officer smacked the back of his hand painfully.
"Good idea." Jessica had managed to catch her breath and stood up a little straighter. She winced a bit as she did it, though. "Flying all the way here and leaving me to run? Not so much."
"I don't think I can." A pang of sympathy ran through Tony's chest. He would comment on it, but as he said before, Natasha was just too fast. "I get your point, though. We all have weird stories. I'm just concerned that her weird story might be an indicator of something more serious…"
"Nope," he said. "I thought I had a good one, but the more I thought about it, the less I liked it."
"No," Hill reiterated. "Stark, you are a civilian, not a trained agent. I'm not going to jeopardize your safety by locking you in a room with a potentially combative enhanced individual."
Turning around, Oswin kept her distance from the building while she tried to glance in the windows. She couldn't see anything on fire. It occurred to her that the earthquake could have caused something to malfunction in the smoke detectors and there was no actual fire, but she didn't have concrete proof of that and she wasn't going to run into a potentially burning building on the assumption that it wasn't on fire. That would just be stupid. However, at the same time, she couldn't call the fire department. After all, not only did she have stolen chemicals from Stark Industries in her basement, but she also had at least fifty-thousand dollars' worth of stolen goods nicked from jewelry and department stores throughout Southern California. Hell, she didn't even own the house she was staying in. She just started squatting in a foreclosed upon home shortly after she started dating Nina. Calling 911 wasn't an option.
"Alright," she said. "As I said, just see if there's anything Tony needs to sign. We'll figure out what to do with the rest of this stuff…"
"It would be so much easier to comb," Margot pointed out. "Plus, I think you'd look so much more handsome."
"Probably…" was the best Tony could come up with. Honestly, although Steve had known his father in his younger, better years, he hoped he saw nothing of his father in him at all, period. When Tony knew him, he was a bitter drunk, too wrapped up in his own research to give a damn about his own wife and son, and on the rare occasion he could, it usually wasn't for good reasons. If Tony could help it, he would never become anything like Howard. He'd stamp out any sign or inkling that he was turning into Howard, ASAP.
"Are you having nightmares?" The hopeful note in Tony's voice caused Steve's heart to lurch uneasily.
"You all know who I am, obviously," he said eliciting another laugh from the crowd. "And I'm already certain that ninety percent of you know more about me than I know about myself, so you can take that as your random fact." The crowd cheered, laughed, and clapped. Once again, they reached the end of the line.
"Your mental health." Stark visibly tensed. "Because we both know that's a topic you can't avoid anymore."
"You don't need to tell me twice." With that, Steve went in for the kiss, which Tony completely surrendered himself to. The two became so immersed in each other that they didn't come back to reality until JARVIS informed them that Bruce had finished cooking.
"Meth lab?" He gawked. "That's not a meth lab! That is my research! My life's work! You can't just dismiss it as-"
"He can stay with me," Clint argued. "I mean, he's being a good boy right now. You're being a good boy, right?" The puppy expressed his agreement by licking Clint's cheek.
"I was in a bad place and I needed to hear it," Tony said. "That's the only reason why she told me."
"Look," Happy said. "I'm not any good with this 'feelings' mumbo-jumbo – that's why I've been sitting here like a deer in headlights the entire time – so believe me when I say we wouldn't be here if it wasn't in Tony's best interest."
The first kiss was chaste, but then they went for a second, and a third, and after that Tony lost count. The kisses were so heated and passionate that they seemingly melded into one another. Steve's hands roamed all over Tony's body, squeezing and grabbing onto whatever they could. Tony let out a distinct moan of pleasure. All thoughts of anything other than Steve left his mind. A layer of sweat began to form on his increasingly heated body. The friction was intense. He could already feel himself getting…
Sharpton had stood from her seat as she shouted. Her voice continued to crescendo until it reached its breaking point. Natasha remained impassive through it all. Sharpton wanted to get her emotional and she wouldn't give her the satisfaction of that. Instead, she waited to see if Sharpton had anything to add. She clearly didn't as the sound of her ragged breathing filled the space.
"No," Lara said, looking away from the document she was reading with wide eyes of alarm. "If that's the case, then we'd have to deal with this again! I'm not doing this again! At least, not for another three months!"
"We're not sure yet," she admitted. "The doctor still needs to do a few tests. I just wanted to make sure you guys didn't do anything that would mess up the test results." Steve didn't believe that the answer was the full truth, but he accepted it for now. He could ask Tony about it later.
After showering and taking her nap (which lasted until about three in the morning) Lara wasn't left with much to do. After all, her one and only job were to monitor the building's power levels and call Tony if something went drastically wrong. All she was essentially doing was babysitting his penthouse and as fabulous as that sounded, it was still a very boring job. Though, she should consider that a good thing. Nothing had happened so far and it was looking like this whole ordeal was just going to be smooth sailing over calm seas.
"Don't worry about it," Tony said. "I've got it taken care of." Out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see Pepper shooting him a questioning look, and he sent one back that hopefully communicated "I'll explain later." That seemingly satisfied her as she nodded and backed off, but Tony couldn't say the same about some of the other looks they were receiving throughout the room. Shaking it off, Tony patted her on the shoulder and started moving towards the exit. "Come on, we don't want the food to get any colder." They made it to the archway before Tony remembered the thing he was going to ask about. "Oh yeah, Bruce, can you take a look at Pepper's cheek. It's hurting her."
apparently didn't count as it was only Christmas in the first thirty minutes.) In the end, Clint won, but only because Steve hadn't seen the film and Clint declared it a "crime against humanity."
Sorry, this is such a rush job this time. I've got to find a way to keep a baby from rolling off her playmat. Be sure to read and review and all that happy fun stuff!
"Do you need a hand getting up?" Initially, Tony was going to refuse, but as he started to sit up, dizziness overcame him. He knew right away that he wouldn't be able to stand on his own and took the offered hand. Carol helped to steady him as he slowly stood up and she wrapped her arm around his shoulders to help him keep balanced. "You steady there?"
As frustrating as it was, neither had given up. Betty was observing the powder through the magnifying lenses while Bruce was researching, trying to find out as much as he could about different biological weapons. It was silent with neither of them speaking. That was until Betty let out a cry of "Oh my God!" Within seconds Bruce was on his feet, rushing over to her.
"A lot less awkward than the Russian 'comrade,'" Adoniram said. "And less obvious." Salinas shrugged.

"They were going after the rest of you," Lara pointed out. "Other than that, one messed up question at the Q&A, they went pretty soft on him. I figured if they were going to go after you guys, it'd be all or nothing."
"Well, that's very sweet of you all," she said. "I understand first appointments can be a little nerve-wracking…" Tony really had to fight the urge to laugh at that complete understatement. "…So, having people willing to stand by and show support is always good." The sincerity of her words caught Tony's attention. When he looked up, he saw nothing but kindness in the doctor's eyes and he felt his tense shoulders relax a little.
"Didn't mean to?" Pepper said. "Tony, all you've done for the past year is keep things from me! First, you go flying around in a metal suit, nearly getting yourself killed how many times before I caught you getting out of that thing? Then the Arc Reactor almost kills you and you tell no one. Now your insurance company cancels you and you might still die after all…" Pepper brought a hand to her mouth and looked down. Tony studied her with concern.
"These were in Phil Coulson's jacket." Tony didn't even turn to see what Fury was talking about. He didn't need to. Everyone had heard about the trading cards by now. "I guess he never did get you to sign them." Tony heard the cards hit the glass of the table, but he still didn't turn around. He didn't look at Steve. He just stayed silent. "We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, the location of the Cube, Banner, Thor… I got nothing for you. I lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming."
"S.H.I.E.L.D. sent over a bunch of files," Lara explained. "We think they're from what happened in D.C. and the bio-terror attack. Could you just give it a look-through just to see what it is and whether or not Tony needs to sign anything?" Natasha nodded.
"Well, that really helps my confidence in apologizing to you." Stark rolled his eyes, but Natasha continued. "We're all a part of the same team. I figured I owed you an apology, too." Stark gave a fake laugh.
, and Happy and Rhodey were scrolling through social media on their phones. Steve didn't think to bring a book with him, but he did have his phone. However, the only person he really wanted to text was Tony and he had a feeling that trying to do so would only be detrimental to him, so he refrained from even pulling out the device at all.
"Last night?" Cabe questioned. "The night before?" Tony still didn't answer her. Pepper gave him a concerned look.
He was about halfway through another boring, dismal night when a woman walked in. She looked no older than twenty and had her hair cut in a short, brown bob. Knežević quickly concluded that she had already had quite a bit to drink, considering she was deliriously giggling and very uncoordinated. He waited a few minutes for her to manage to get up onto her barstool before going over to take her order.
He looked around at the vastness of space that surrounded him. He had no options here. He was a traitor to the throne of Asgard, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. If he allowed Odin to pull them back up, he'd be stripped of his title and locked away in the dungeons forever. He'd never have his "father's" love, never be Thor's equal. All he'd be is a monster in a cage, cursed to live under the scorn of the people he once ruled. He looked back up at Thor, who was struggling to keep a tight grip on the staff. That's when Loki made his decision. He just had one more thing he needed to say first.
Tony winced. He couldn't outright ignore her. Not only would he be in worse trouble than he already was for doing so, but it was also an unwinnable battle. If Peggy wanted him to open the door, he'd open the door. Even if she had to stand at that door knocking all night, he was opening the door. Sighing, Tony tossed the pillow haphazardly back onto the bed, got up, unlocked and opened the door.
"Then what's the problem?" Natasha looked down, truly looking like she didn't want to say what she was about to say about another person.
"But you stayed, right?" Bruce couldn't argue with that, so he nodded in agreement. "So, you found them. You found a group of people that at the very least, share a similar burden to you. Sure, that burden might not be turning into a giant green monster, but they still can relate in some way and you're all working together to achieve the same goal; protecting the world. In the end, that's more than what I could have wanted for you, especially considering all that time you isolated yourself."
"Nat, what are you doing? We need to get a move on! Let's go!" Natasha held Clint's gaze for a few more seconds before she relented and sighed.
"I don't think so," Audrey said. "You saw the car! The door was wide open and there were groceries in the back! This is just too weird! I'm calling the police!"
It wasn't just the vomiting that had them concerned. Tony's skin had gone so pale that someone could confuse him in a lineup with Casper the Friendly Ghost and a dying E.T. Add to that the fact that his minor shivers before had progressed to full-body trembles and what you got wasn't a pretty picture. The worst part about all of it was that despite how terrible he was doing now, there was still a chance that things could get worse.
"I told you," Tony said. "I wanted to sleep. Alcohol wasn't working, so I thought I'd try something else." Rhodey frowned, still not entirely convinced by that explanation. Tony was still leaving something out. He could feel it.
"And that situation would be?" She raised an eyebrow as if to will the cop to be truthful to her. It didn't work.
"And you're not planning on bringing him back to the tower?" It was then that Clint started to look guilty.
Some things couldn't be helped, though. So, Tony just hoped he could get away with winging it for now. Getting behind the bar and down on his knees, Tony started by taking the doors off the cabinets, which was an easy enough task. After that, he moved on to removing the shelves. He had to lie on his back and angled his head oddly to spot where the screws were, he managed to do it and got the shelves out without too much difficulty. Once he had all the shelves removed, he could easily see where all the bolts holding the countertop together were and set about removing them.
"You're welcome." Bruce couldn't help but notice the way Lara smiled a little bit. It made him smile, too.
Giving Steve's hair one last run-through, Tony got up and started walking. Initially, he was just going to lie down on the other side of the bed, but instead he ended up just following his feet through the door and out into the hallway. The door directly across from their bedroom was to Tony's private office. Without even thinking about it, he opened the door and stopped in the doorframe.
Steve nodded, and within seconds Tony found himself lifted into Steve's arms. Tony was astonished for a moment before he remembered that Steve had super strength. Lifting him was probably nothing compared to raising a bus. Tony found himself wrapping his arms around Steve again. Again, he knew it wouldn't last, so he tried to enjoy it.
Hopping down from the table top, Lara grabbed her purse and the handful of belts she had grabbed from Tony's room. It was a long way down and there was no telling whether she'd be able to make it all the way down without any issues. If she got cornered by these guys, she wanted to have an easy way to deny them access to her location and find an alternate escape route. Though, she doubted there'd be many of those, especially on the higher levels.
"This video was captured of him over our surveillance system," she explained. "You need to see it." Pepper took the flash drive before turning to the two department heads.
Not even one whole hour had passed before Tony had broken the promise he had made to Lara. To be fair, it's not like he could help it. That little prank that Barton had pulled had scared the living daylights out of him. He could feel himself shaking a little bit. Besides, technically Tony had promised to lay off the sauce, not to abstain from drinking altogether. So, one drink to calm his nerves wasn't that big of a deal, right? Also, the early hour didn't matter as they were practically giving out mimosas' downstairs. He just had to finish it before Lara caught him. No big deal.
Tony woke up with his head aching and something cold tapping against his cheek. Realizing it was water, he bolted upright and immediately smashed his head into a faucet. He let out a curse and rubbed the injured spot carefully. When he tried to get up again, he took things slow and managed to avoid the faucet.
"It was a false alarm," Carol said. "Stark paged me accidentally and I was too hasty in my response."
"Funny," Pepper said. "Isn't that what you said when I told you to get the floors done back in August?" Tony let out a breath of exasperation. Lara saw this as the perfect opportunity to cut in.
His voice had never sounded so cold, but that was unsurprising. Having what was most precious taken away often did that to people.
It was very easy to lose track of time in this enclosed room. He supposed that's why Coulson called him in at three AM – the man honestly didn't realize that it wasn't morning yet. There weren't any clocks on the walls and Tony noticed that not many of the agents had watches, so it made sense. However, it seemed much easier for Tony to lose track of time, probably because he wasn't feeling so well.
Natasha moved as swiftly and silently as she could. She could tell Clint had noticed her presence a while ago but waited until she was right behind him to whip around, an arrow positioned to fly from his bow. Natasha had anticipated this, grabbing ahold of the bow and stepping out of the way as he fired. She tried to disarm him by twisting the bow out of his grip, but that only earned her a punch to the stomach.
"Regardless of how Mr. Fair obtained the information," the man sitting across from Fair – Harold Schaffer – said. "This is a serious threat to the company. If the thief has the building's security codes, who knows what they could do next!"
Things only served to get worse when Tony let out that breath he had been holding. JARVIS gave a static-filled notification that he was powering down and within seconds the HUD flickered off and the thrusters died, officially leaving him completely and utterly alone. Once the suit had fully powered off, his hands released the missile, sending it straight into the army above. All Tony could do was watch as the missile went off, and a huge, soundless explosion began to overwhelm the waiting invaders.
"Not much other than that," Tony heard Fury say. "He's just hungover. You might want to keep him away from the booze for a bit." Tony threw his head back against the pillow.
"That's suicide!" Clint exclaimed. Right at that moment, the jet in Tony's left hand sputtered off and on again.
Tony raised an eyebrow. Those weren't the words he was expecting. He turned over onto his side to face Steve and saw that his boyfriend was just as close to tears as he was.
arrested if he ever sets foot on US soil again. It's also not worth the four-hour flight just to go down there to beat him up, so I'd leave it be, Cap." Steve let out a heavy sigh.
As the Church's priest or Grand Wizard or whatever they referred to their leader as spoke, the members looked to him with rapt attention. Lara wasn't sure, but it sounded like he was quoting Acts of Apostles. Looking around, Lara could see that several civilians had stopped to gawk at the bizarre gathering, but it didn't look like Cabe or anyone else from security had been alerted yet.
When he opened his eyes again, he ended up spotting a familiar face. Standing near the exit at the top of the stairs, he caught sight of Fury standing next to a blonde-haired woman wearing an Air Force dress uniform. It took a second for his mind to put together that it was Carol. He knew the others had spotted Fury as they all gave him nods of acknowledgement as they walked past, but none of them seemed to take notice of Carol. Tony did, though, and caught the little wave she gave him as he passed by. He gave her one back.
He didn't know what he was looking for or why. It wasn't like that video of the Oswin girl before where she became more visible with each playthrough. Every frame remained the same each time Tony watched it. The only thing it was serving to do was distract Tony from his video and add to his disdain towards Freeman.
"I can't," he said. "I can't think now. When I can, then I'll move forward and start figuring things out. I need time…"
"Excuse me," Freeman spoke up once again. "Can we keep the conversation focused on Mr. Stark?" Everhart sighed.
"I'd say that I have a good enough relationship with each of them." He paused for a moment. "Well, Thor's been in Asgard since the incident, so none of us really got the chance to know him too much, but the others, I'd say we're on pretty solid ground."
"No need for that," he said. "I assure you that I'm not doing anything stupid. There's no need for you to worry. You can go about your – ow!"
"Do you know why Romanoff sent you the video, though?" Pepper looked around, unsure of how to answer.
"Where's all the booze?" He questioned aloud. "Seriously, what kind of five-star luxury hotel doesn't offer their guests a little something-something as thanks for their kind patronage. Even grocery store-branded wine would suffice."
As Tony turned, he could see Romanoff make some sort of gesture and Barton seemingly reciprocate it. After that, the CDC crew began to lead them out of the room. As Tony walked, he desperately hoped that his reassurances wouldn't turn into lies.
Tony's chest tightened. He tried to inhale but found that he couldn't. There was no air to breathe anyway. He was trapped in a vacuum.
"Power to the elevators have been shut down as per emergency protocol," JARVIS reported. "The fastest route from your current position would take you down the south-west stairwell."
"So, I'm sorry to say that this was an intended to be a solo appointment between me and Mr. Stark," Dr. Cranston explained. "At least, that's what I was told over the phone…"
Across the table, Steve glanced up at Tony with a concerned look. Tony did his best to give his newly-acquired boyfriend a reassuring smile but found he couldn't be quite convincing enough. Tony beat him to the punch before he could say anything.
"Well, yeah," Steve said. "I wouldn't either if I had just flown a missile through a portal to space."
"I gotta say," Coulson said. "It's an honor to meet you, officially. I've sort of met you. I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping." Steve turned his gaze to the ground. You could cut the awkward in that Quinjet with a knife. Coulson kept trying to rephrase it in a way that sounded less creepy. "You know, it's really such a huge honor to have you on board with this…" Thankfully, Steve took the subject change as he stood up to look out the jet's window.
"You're going to lose." Loki turned to look at the broken man. Blood stained his shirt and trickled from his mouth. He couldn't help but laugh at the notion.
Once the safety performance finished up, Bruce and Lara took the pizzas and headed back to the elevator. Since Lara still seemed to be easing up – even remarking on how she couldn't wait to down her pizza whole – Bruce absolutely ascertained to himself that he wasn't going to bring up the topic of her ex again. After all, she seemed to bounce back okay in a short period of time, and he didn't want to ruin that.
I'll be back with a new chapter on 1/1/21. I just want to get past the holidays without having to keep up with posting. Even with the pandemic, things are hectic. Hopefully, I'll be able to finish this story by this time next year!
"Tony," Steve said. "I'm going to tell you something, and I want you to listen well. I meant every single word I said that night on the hellicarier, and it still stands true even now. I… I like you. I want to be your everything just like you're my everything. I'd have nothing if I didn't have you. You almost sacrificed yourself to save the whole world. You deserve every piece of affection I or anyone else gives you and please, please never doubt that. You are wanted for you, by me if not anyone else. Do you understand?"
He tapped the dialogue box to compose a new message. He realized he probably should have done this earlier, but better late than never he supposed.
"We had just gotten into that argument about our post-graduate studies," Bruce said. "You can't tell me that wasn't on your mind."
"Really?" she questioned. "Because when we came back, you were already half-passed out. I cannot imagine what would have happened if you went down all those stairs.
"I feel like I can't catch a break," he admitted. "Like all I know anymore is loss, and I feel like it's been following me around for a while, before I even became Captain America."
"Actually, once you're done doing this, can you go and get Clint? He needs to hear this, too." Natasha's eyes widened.
A mixture of thoughts and emotions were stirred up in Tony's mind at the question. Most of them were good, but he wasn't sure what to tell Pepper. After all, he couldn't just say "oh, Steve? It's no big deal, really. He's just the World War II Army Hero Captain America. Yes, I know he's supposed to be dead. Turns out he just spent the last sixty-five years frozen in a block of ice until S.H.I.E.L.D. came across and unfroze him. That's why they called me in on Saturday. They needed some of my father's files to make sure they didn't accidentally kill him as he thawed out. I also think he's pretty good looking and I can't stop myself from smiling when I so much as glance at him. Is that creepy?" Yeah, that would get him sent to the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes for sure.
Steve stepped forward, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her close. Again, Natasha moved her head, so her mouth was close to his ear.
He felt filled to the bone with nothing but nervous energy. No matter how many deep breaths he took, he couldn't seem to contain it at all. His mind kept running through anxious thoughts and terrifying possibilities, all of which seemed to go by so fast that he could barely process them all. It was like he was freefalling through a bottomless pit; he wanted nothing more than for the ground to come and meet up with him and stop his endless decent. He felt his stomach lurch in an unpleasant manner.
"Remind me to get her something extra nice for Christmas this year," he said. "Seriously, she didn't need to do that."
Natasha nodded and thanked the woman again. The nurse then left without another word. Nat knew she should lie back down, but she couldn't. Instead, she sat on the edge of the bed and stared at Clint, who was fast asleep in the bed across from her. The vinyl panel that had separated the two haves of the room had been removed as Nat had already been exposed, so it wasn't like separating her from Clint would prevent anything. As a result, Nat had both an uninterrupted view of Clint and the rest of the room, and nothing blocking her from the guilt of the horrible acts she had almost done in his name. She looked down and took a deep breath before bringing her eyes back to Clint.
"Tell your whore that next time she goes to bang someone else's husband, to remember to take her panties when she leaves." She then tossed the underwear at Dante, who flinched as if he was expecting her to hurl something heavier. As soon as the underwear left her hand, Lara was turning back to get her sandwich and purse and get out of there ASAP. Unfortunately, Dante got up and followed her.
"You left it in the bathroom," Steve said as he started to get up. "I hung it up. I'll go get rid of it." He could hear Steve walk back to the bedroom.
Keyword: almost. Tony felt like he was lighter than air and though he thought eating would help, but so far, the only thing that did was leave him with the horrible feeling of a rock sinking into his stomach. Don't get him wrong, the shawarma was good. He supposed it was more his nerves than the food causing that upset, and it was understandable. After all, who wouldn't freak out if they had something wrong with them and they couldn't exactly pinpoint what it was?
The agents made quick work of the locks and allowed Tony to go inside. The door shut behind him and he heard one of the locks slide into place. Only one, though.
Tony turned his gaze over to Steve. The look on his face wasn't too hopeful, either. His blue eyes were full of concern. The most he could do was give him a pat on the back of the hand. He hoped it would be enough to reassure him but given that Steve knew all about his tryst with Miss Everhart, he highly doubted it would.
. I'm doing an article about your organization and I was hoping to get an interview with someone in charge."
Tony and Lara looked slightly disappointed as the reminded him to come down to the dining room for breakfast and promptly left his suite. Well, at least now Bruce knew to expect them. It was probably safer that way.
"Bruce?" Betty's voice reminded him of where he was. He gripped the back of a chair, looked down, and started taking deep breaths. Thinking only of the danger he'd be putting Betty and everyone else in this S.H.I.E.L.D. base in by Hulking-out, Bruce managed to get himself into a mostly calm state. When he felt okay enough to function, he turned around and looked back to Betty.
"That's his M.O., isn't it?" Everyone turned to look at Bruce "I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're a time bomb."
"I have a change of clothes in my desk," she said. "So, trust me, I'm not going to look like Maggie off the pickle boat all day."
Steve tried to change as fast as possible. It was a lot harder than one would think it would be, given that getting it on was rather seamless. Straps and zippers all easily slid into place and the layers of armor came together easily. However, taking them off was a bit harder. The straps were murder to try to undo and the zippers always seemed to get stuck on the way back down. On the one hand, that was probably good because they didn't want the uniform to come apart in the middle of a battle. On the other hand, it was a pain. It felt like the only way to get it off of him was to have someone else take it off of him.
This is actually also addressing a problem I had with Age of Ultron as Clint's family seemingly came out of nowhere. I mean, they hinted at Clint having a significant other early on in the film, but that was just one line and it didn't really well establish the reveal. Also, I found it a little disconcerting given that Clint was brainwashed in the Avengers. Wouldn't the people in the know about Clint's family be concerned for their safety? I guess that was poor planning on Thanos's part. So yes, Laura and the kids exist and are safe! That's all you need to know!
"No," she said. "In order to return to work, I had to pass a mental health screening. I failed miserably." Bruce raised his eyebrows in surprise. "Don't worry, I've gotten help. I'm fine now, but I was in a bad place for a while. It took a bit for me to get back up on my feet, but I did it somehow and I got this job. Not sure how I did that either, but…"
As soon as he was safely behind the door to Pepper's office, he broke down into a coughing fit that sent him to his knees. Pepper tried to get closer to help him, but he held up a hand for her to keep back. She didn't need to be sick, too. When the coughing finally subsided, Tony found himself gasping for air. Pepper grabbed a few tissues off her desk and handed them to him.
They sat in silence for quite a while. No one really wanted to break the silence. For once, it was comfortable. That wasn't something Tony expected sitting at a table with two deadly assassins, the Incredible Hulk, a Norse God, and Captain America – the living legend himself – but the circumstances and working together as a team had changed that. Now, Tony could honestly say that he trusted everyone sitting at this table with his life and that was something he thought he'd never be able to do. It was almost nice.
"Oh," Rawls said. "Well, the B- blood type isn't as rare as you'd think. I'm sure one of your friends here would be a compatible match."
"We moved the TV in your room so it's facing the bed," she said. "And none of us have anywhere we need to be for the rest of the day."
Stone never turned around, nor did he even glance in the direction of the air vent above him. It appeared that his gaze was constantly on Tony, rather than randomly looking about like a normal person would be. It was clearly an intentional effort to keep his face from being seen, meaning that he knew the camera was there.
Slowly, Steve started to pull away. Tony frowned and tried to pull him back. Steve smiled at him with a bit of concern in his eyes. Tony felt his heartbreak a little bit. He knew he wouldn't be looking so sympathetic in a few minutes. Tony was sure of it.
Turning his gaze back to the bar, Tony was a little afraid of what he'd see. Luckily, there wasn't too much damage. The countertop hadn't cracked or broken when it landed and the floor appeared to be unmarked, so that was a win. He was about to try to pick up the counter and set it down properly when the door to the office came flying open.
people. That would imply people were property and the thirteenth amendment would have to disagree with that. So, most of the requirements were not met, meaning that flying Steve across the country without S.H.I.E.L.D.'s knowledge or permission technically wasn't kidnapping. At least, that's what Tony was going to say once S.H.I.E.L.D. caught up with them and took Steve back.
Lara would have silenced her phone, but there was a chance that Tony could try to call her, and she didn't want to miss it if he did. So, every time the song started up again, she'd glance at the screen. Every time it would say "No Caller ID", so she would just assume it to be Dante and let it ring. Yes, she did consider the possibility that Tony could also call from a number registered as "No Caller ID" but she didn't want to take the risk by continually answering her phone. Responding to a stalker only encouraged them, after all.
"A hero?" Tony questioned. "Like you? You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle." Steve's face remained impassive.
"That has yet to come to my understanding." Carol felt chills go down her spine as they stopped in front of a door.
So yay! They're back together again! I hope you're all starting to forgive me for the bad stuff I did! Now you can all hate me for the fact that I spent three weeks writing one chapter and I might have completely fucked myself! Yay!
So what's the plan from here out? Well, I am going to write Chapter Twenty-Nine and as soon as I have it completely written and typed out, I will post it on this site. This is mostly because I realize what a crappy note I'm leaving people on here and I want to give you some hope before we hit a large bout of radio silence. I'm going to give December 2nd as a tentative date because after this family thing I have tomorrow there's US Thanksgiving and a few other things that will be happening next week that will take the majority of my attention. As I've stated before, I'm only one person and I'm not a wizard, so please be patient with me while I try to work around these things.
"Good," Dr. Cranston returned the smile. "I promise you, you are safe here, and I am safe from any attempt from anyone to try to wiggle their way into your private life by getting to me. My husband's former Navy, my brothers are all Marines, and my sister works for the Secret Service. Out of all licensed therapists on the island of Manhattan, I'm probably the safest. You have nothing to worry about. Do you understand?" Tony nodded.
"Attempting to slander my employer while still under contract and gross negligence," Freeman said. "The former was for reading Salinas' statement in front of the press, and the latter was for 'not acting responsibly' while Stark was missing."
Tony put all his effort into remaining perfectly still as he laid down on the bed. The slightest movement would send waves of electricity coursing through his brain. It was a pain, but at least he wasn't feeling any pain lying like this.
"That is true, that is true." Slowly, Rhodey's face started to grow more somber. "Seriously though, Tony, we're here for you no matter what. Even with all this bullshit, we're here. So please, stay with us." Tony nodded, albeit a bit reluctantly.
"You've met him before?" Tony turned to look back at Bruce. "I don't mean to pry but the way you guys were talking…"
"Where's the emergency?" The room fell silent. The only sounds that could be heard was the occasional bit of debris hitting the floor. Tony put on his best placating smile as he stood up.
"Is Barton…?" There was a moment's pause as it sounded like Stark took a couple of steps. "What is that?"
"Yeah," Tony said. "But I don't think it was any different from anyone else's image of him; the war hero, the good old-fashioned, all-American boy…"
"I was thinking more about the Other Guy freaking out," Bruce explained. "But yeah, okay. Live in dream land."
"No," Lara said. "I've already talked to Cabe and the police about it, so if he shows up again, he's going straight to jail. I also texted my friend Todd to see if I could crash at her place until I go to court next Tuesday. By the way, I need next Tuesday off." Tony raised his eyebrows as he felt a little bit of weight come off him.
"The CDC has already cleared the both of you. No deadly diseases or contagions were found. Stark's been cleared as well." Steve could be heard letting out a breath of relief while Natasha held hers. "We have very strong evidence pointing at one primary suspect. Local PD in Newark, New Jersey already have her contained, but she's refusing to talk. They could use some help getting the info out of her and arresting any accomplices." Hill was looking Nat directly in the eye during that last sentence. It was clear that it was addressed to her specifically, but she couldn't care. In response, she kept her face blank and her tone firm, yet dark.
"The humans think us immortal," his illusion remarked as it walked closer to one of the holographic panels. "Should we test that?" He had the illusion reach for the release button before becoming distracted by the sound of one of the guards he had set up falling unconscious to the ground.
"I understand this is hard," he tried again. "But we need a hundred percent certainty in the identification of the suspect."
"You're really just in the same place?" Tony's eyes widened, surprised that Steve was able to catch on so easily.
Quickly saying their goodbyes, Fury, Hill, and Carol left. Steve collected Tony up into his arms again, and this time he lifted him off the couch. Tony would have wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, but he would have to let go of the blanket he had taken from Salinas' house (which yes, he still had) and he was cold, so he didn't want to do that. Steve started carrying Tony through the living area and towards the bedroom. Natasha cut in front of them to open the door. From there, she also pulled back the sheets on the mattress. Steve set Tony down on the space Nat made and pulled the covers back over him. Carefully, he straightened the sheets.
"No, it's not if we don't confront him," Natasha said. "And we let him choose to talk to us. We're not going to gang up on him or force him to do anything he doesn't want to. We're just going to calmly ask him if there's anything we can do to help him."
"It was our destined day of reckoning," the girl said in the same eerily calm manner as she did when she asked the question. "Why did you put a stop to it? Why couldn't you allow humanity to enter its new era?" At that point, the university employee seemed to find their jaw somewhere on the floor and reattach it before grabbing the woman by the arm and escorting her out of the theater. The entire time she was being escorted out, the woman screamed that the staff was "racially profiling her," and calling them "racist, fascist pigs!" She only seemed to stop when the auditorium doors shut behind her.
"Yep," Tony said, popping the "p". He handed the bag over to Steve. "They might have gotten a little cold while I was waiting. Sorry about that."
"Loki's going to use the arc reactor at Stark Tower to fire up the Cube," he explained without even giving Hill a glance. "Everything within a few blocks of the tower… Hell, maybe all of Midtown needs to be evacuated ASAP."
The minute or so it took the concierge to pull up the camera footage and queue it up to the correct time did nothing to ease Steve's shock. He watched with a dead stare as the exterior video started up. For a few seconds it was only the same nameless sea of people being forced out of the hotel by the police. Then Tony appeared. The two officers that had been carrying him in the lobby video set him down on the sidewalk. As soon as he was released, Tony turned and tried to re-enter the hotel, but was continually pushed back by the police and the current of the crowd. Eventually, Tony seemed to give up. He shouted one last thing over his shoulder before turning and walking down 16th Street. The video paused as soon as Tony was out of frame. By that point, Steve had gotten over his shock.
"Then explain it to me," she instructed in a gentle, yet firm voice. "Help me understand." Tony hesitated a moment before reluctantly giving in.
"I get it," Bruce said. "I'm kind of hoping the same thing right now. It's horrifically selfish but at the same time…"
Once he got dressed, he went downstairs to find Conroy standing at the landing, waiting for him with a glass of water in one hand and something enclosed in her other fist. He raised his eyebrows as he reached the bottom of the stairs and she grabbed one of his empty hands and deposited three pills into them.
"Okay." At that point, Natasha started to pull away, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. She never broke out crying as she had feared when Clint first pulled her into the hug, but she felt as relieved as she would have if she did. In gratitude, she gave him a small, reassuring smile. "Thanks, Clint." He waved it off.
"Tony," Pepper said. "Just looking around I'm shocked you've been able to live like this for this long." Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony kept thinking he should lean up to give Steve another kiss, but he didn't want to break the moment. Eventually, Steve went ahead and did it by speaking up.
A few hours had passed, and Bruce and Betty got quite a few things done. S.H.I.E.L.D. was testing all the public mailboxes in Newark and the two of them had compiled a list of all the labs in the area that they felt were equipped and capable enough to create a biological weapon. However, they still had not managed to identify what the powder was.
While Tony was busy figuring out whether the wool was being pulled over his eyes that he didn't notice Agent Coulson coming up to stand beside him.
Once onboard the plane, a dark-skinned bald man stood up to shake hands with Tony. He made quick work of introducing the man to Steve and Bruce as Duane Freeman, head of the New York branch's PR department. With all introductions out of the way, Tony took the chance to get settled into one of the booth seats, sitting with his legs stretched out across it. That was until Steve came over and gently pushed his legs aside to sit next to him. Tony gave an annoyed hum at first but scooched over to be closer to Steve once he sat down.
his mind instantly supplied, much to his chagrin. Still, he had no idea where to take this. All he wanted to do was get out of the frying pan and ended up in the fire. …Actually, it would probably be more apt to say he got out of the fire only to end up in the frying pan, as his issues with Pepper were far less serious than his issues with Romanoff.
"That's not necessary," she said. "Tony and I are adults. We are perfectly capable of having a civil discussion." Tony gave Pepper a side-eye and she responded by giving him a sharp, warning look. Cabe narrowed her eyes at both.
"Your total is $217.46." Tony raised his eyebrows in surprise. That was way cheaper than he was expecting. He reached into his jacket pocket for his wallet…
"Sentiment," he said disgustedly as Thor fell to the ground, clutching his side. A ghost of a smirk started to come over his face when Thor suddenly rushed up and kneed him in the stomach, the blow knocking Loki through one of the glass safety barriers. He didn't fall, though. Instead, Thor picked him up and threw him right back down onto the concrete of the balcony.
"I'm sorry," she said. "I should have listened to you and stuck with the plan." Steve shook his head as he pulled back.
The sun was starting to rise. Tony sat on a curb with his head in his hands, staring at his bare feet. He was contemplating his options. He had walked quite a distance from the convenience store, so much so that he had no idea where he was or how to get back to the hotel. The most cash he had on him was a dollar in quarters that had somehow accumulated in his pants pocket and he ended up losing all of it to a payphone that's handset cord had been severed. Tony tried to repair it, but he found that the wires had no electrical charge running through them at all, rendering the phone completely useless. So, in every sense of the word he was lost. There was no better way to sum it up.
"We think so." That took a little bit of edge off Natasha's worry. "We think so" was at least better than a flat out "no." It meant Clint still had a chance. "I'll brief you on everything when you get back."
"Home." Lara rolled her eyes at her own mistake. "Well, not home; my friend's house, but all the same, it's the end of the day and I just want dinner and sleep."
"Stop!" he shouted. "What is wrong with you? What the fuck makes you think that you can tell me where to go and what to do? I'm the boss of you!"
They all seemed to agree before going about their own business and reading the packets. However, a rather anxious silence seemed to fall over the car. Tony felt a hand slide into his. He turned to look at Steve.
Adoniram had been introduced to Maurita Sharpton by his close personal advisor, Congressman Eduardo Salinas. Sharpton was deeply mourning the loss of her daughter during the Battle of New York, so she was easily corrupted and converted into a member of the Peoples Unity Church. Adoniram considered such a conversion a win, especially considering her high position within the Roxxon Corporation's conglomeration. Not only did it give them access to Roxxon's assets, but it also added to their clout.
"I'll keep my eye out," Pepper ignored the cheer of 'yes' that Tony gave and instead changed the subject. "I don't suppose you've watched the news today?"
"When I lied about dying to Pepper," he said. "I honestly did it because I could only imagine what that would do to her. At the time, I had feelings for her and thought I was sparing her; giving her some form of mercy. Instead, I just ruined whatever we had between us and almost destroyed our friendship. I thought, 'okay, I'll never do something that shitty to someone again,' then last week happened…"
just slept for several hours, but given how drowsy he was, he thought it'd be easier to fall asleep than this.
Slowly, Natasha started to lower her gun. Steve came up next to her and gently pried the weapon from her fingers. She let him. Her gaze drifted down to the ground and for a moment, Steve worried that she was going to fall over. However, Nat was strong enough to keep herself upright, so the concern ended up not being necessary. Steve brought his hand up to his comms unit and asked for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to come and assist in the arrest. After all, it was clear Nat wasn't going to be able to do it.
Tony tried dialing the NYPD's non-emergency number a third time. Still, he got a busy signal. He growled in frustration. At first, he thought the attack might have already started and the lines were clogged, but that didn't make sense because, in a doomsday situation like the one they were potentially standing on the precipice of, everyone would be dialing 911, not the non-emergency number. The only reason why Tony was using the non-emergency number was that he didn't want to clog up the line for people who needed immediate help. Still, the police needed to be notified if they hadn't already. The area needed to be evacuated ASAP before anyone could get hurt.
"Cropsey ended up being real." Clint found himself narrowing his eyes skeptically. "Some sick fuck murdered a little girl with Down Syndrome and dumped her body in a shallow grave near a hospital connected to the Cropsey legend. They caught the guy, thankfully, but they think he might have had more victims."
Freeman then slowly stepped away from the podium and presumably off stage with Cabe closely following him. Pepper stepped into shot seconds later, still the epitome of composure. She began to speak, but honestly Lara barely payed attention to what she had to say. Instead, she was getting up out of bed and began to search for clothes to wear. As much as she wanted to sleep, it was clear that Pepper was going to need help handling this crisis.
"A lot of time control isn't an option," Tony said. "If the person responsible for my parents' deaths were in this room right now, do you think I'd be able to take it? No, of course not. I'd beat Howard back to death in a heartbeat."
As soon as they managed to get comfortable, Tony pulled Steve close for another kiss. This kiss was much more chaste than the ones before it, but still enjoyable nonetheless. When Tony pulled back, he gave him a wide smile.
"Yes," Natasha said. "But you know there are other things we should discuss, like running the team."
He didn't think anything was seriously amiss. After all, he had just seen Tony two days before and he was clearly alive. However, he needed to know what the hell he was watching and hoped Tony would be able to clue him in. Despite his hopes, that isn't what happened. Instead of Tony answering the phone, Rhodey was instead met with the voice of JARVIS, the AI Tony had recently installed into his home.
Obviously enough a living human being had never been thawed before. First, there was the fact that humans are made mostly of water and when water freezes, it expands, leading the rupturing of all the major bodily tissue cells, resulting in death. Secondly, even if you somehow managed to solve that little problem in the freezing process, there was the little issue of it being scientifically unethical to freeze a person and bring them back to life. Even if the person was okay with the possibility of dying or something going wrong in the thawing process causing them to be permanently injured for life it'd still be unethical and possibly illegal.
"You guys take her upstairs," he said addressing Steve and Natasha. They both nodded while Tony turned to Carol. "It's probably best if you don't leave until everything's settled a bit." Carol shrugged but nodded at the same time.
"I will in just one second," Steve assured. "Just let me throw our clothes in the wash and turn off all the lights, first."
"We're here," she stated grimly. Tony felt Steve squeeze his hand. Tony looked right into his blue eyes and still saw hesitance.
"Jury's out," Tony quipped while Bruce tried to get back to work. Tony turned his attention back to the other scientist. "You really have got a lid on it, have you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, a huge bag of weed?"
"You know what, save your excuses for someone who cares," Dr. Holcomb said. "That's not my problem. What is my problem being that when I just got done talking to you about how serious your condition is, you go gallivanting off and jeopardizing your already fragile condition by encountering who-knows how many pathogens? Were you even listening to me when I told you that aplastic anemia essentially reduces your immune system to nothing and that contact with the average cold or flu virus could cause you to become extremely ill or kill you? In fact, you're lucky you got back here in time for us to bring your fever down before any permanent or serious damage was done. A few degrees more and your brain would have been like a hard-boiled egg. Plus, you wasted the time of our staff searching for you after your girlfriend told us that you had gone missing. I hope you're happy with yourself."
"Yeah, but his inability to accept my forgiveness – hell, to even forgive himself – is concerning," Steve said. "He acts like I wasn't even there, that I'll still think less of him somehow."
Remember kids, Santa Clause is a murderer! He ran over some poor child's grandmother as she was walking home one Christmas Eve! This holiday is for a murderer! Please don't celebrate murderers!
"Yeah, no," Tony said. "But think of it this way, now you can add 'refuses to listen to authority' to the list of reasons why I'm not recommended for the Avengers Initiative…" Tony had to pause for a second as the faceplate went over his face and the suit's systems came online. "Along with 'compulsive behavior' and 'textbook narcissism.'" He finished once the suit's speaker system was activated. "Now, if you wouldn't mind stepping out of the way…"
"It's not your fault," Steve said. "Peggy is the one who told you and considering her reasoning in the situation, I can't blame her. She did the right thing."
"Or maybe she's willing to put the past aside and work with you for the good of the team." Tony gave her a disbelieving look.
"Well, this isn't an 'I told you so' moment, Hogan," Rhodey explained. "This is going to be absolutely devastating to Tony, provided he doesn't know about it yet."
"Listen," Tony said. "None of you are going to like hearing this, but I'm going to have to go in there and confront Loki by myself for a few minutes."
Tony held his breath, waiting for the confrontation. Romanoff was somewhat merciful. She waited until they were out of earshot of their table to say something and kept her voice low when she did to keep strangers from overhearing.
"Yes," Steve nodded, and the doctor made quick work of the examination. He shined a light into Steve's eyes and ears, listened to his heartbeat and his breathing, examined his throat, and checked his pulse. All of these were procedures that Steve was quite familiar with, however, the doctor eventually had to move on to procedures using more modern equipment. None of the tests were invasive, but the unfamiliar instruments did give Steve a sense of unease…
Tony took her hand and followed her through the crowd. Checking back, he saw Steve following closely behind. Tony shut his eyes and allowed Romanoff to guide him through the chaos, thanking whatever entities made it possible for him to get through this without vomiting all over the House floor.
"I'm gonna need a rain check on that dance." Freezing waters and the edge of an ice shelf came into view. It took Peggy a moment to respond, and when she did, it sounded like she was holding back tears.
"I ran because of Betty," he admitted. "When it… When the Other Guy happened… The very first time… She got hurt. She was in a coma for three weeks; in and out of the hospital for six months, and it was my fault. I had other reasons to leave – General Ross and the US Army wanted to weaponize the Hulk – but my biggest reason for leaving was her. I didn't want to hurt her again.
"Wait for a second, 'potential terrorist threat?'" an alarmed-looking Pepper said. "You didn't mention that before."
However, he found that his brain could not stop focusing on the video. So instead, he did what he usually did when he couldn't get something off his mind (and couldn't drink); direct all his energy somewhere else. Once the computer booted up, he brought up the video Cabe had given them the day before of Freeman letting the People's Unity Church members into the Tower.
"Yes," she said. "It's all they've been talking about on the news today. How have you not heard about it?"
"This is Charlie-Tango-Alfa-Niner to the Hub. Charlie-Tango-Alfa-Niner to the Hub. Do you read me? Over."
"S.H.I.E.L.D. seems to be efficient with that kind of stuff," she said. "Didn't you say they had you giving testimony as to what happened immediately after the incident?" Tony internally cringed at the colloquial dubbing of the Battle of New York. Although it had been months that wound still felt fresh. Regardless, it was still easy enough to hide his real reaction.
As she walked out of the bathroom, Lara felt all-too tempted to flop back down on the guest bed and go right back to sleep. It wasn't because she was tired (honestly, she felt more well-rested than she ever had in her life) but more because she just didn't want to have to go through this day. It was already shaping up to be a nightmare from hell and it wasn't even eight AM. The worst part was that she could hardly even come up with a bright side to the situation. Even the weather outside was miserable, which only served to add to the grim tone of the day.
"Put on the suit." This time, his voice was much more horse and more confused than it was challenging.
"I don't care," he said. "Just carry me." Tony could have sworn he heard Steve laugh a bit before he scooped him up into his arms. It was remarkably easy for Steve to lift him, but Tony shouldn't be surprised since he
"The Avengers are going to be funded by SI," Tony said. "We need someone to represent the company and who better to do that than the greatest CEO of all time?" Pepper barely batted an eyelash.
"Okay, maybe I wasn't that precise." Tony could feel the heat coming off the glare Pepper was sending him all the way from the west coast. "I'm sorry. I should have explained better."
"Don't mention it," Rhodey said. "Now, if you don't mind, I think I need to have a little conversation with someone about bad ideas and shutting her mouth."
The line then went quiet, save for the sounds of Maria putting the phone down and typing away on her keyboard. Glancing around the store as she waited, Carol realized that she wasn't the only patron anymore. Two men had entered – both dressed in white robes – and were talking to the clerk. The conversation was very heated.
"It's more than that," Stark said. "He's already lost so many people. I didn't want to put him through something like that. I shouldn't have."
He did wonder for a moment, though, whether she'd be worth it to Natasha. When she initially brought out the knife, he wasn't worried. It was clearly just a threat. He didn't think she was going to do something. That was until Sharpton used that word. Then, the blade was at her throat.
"I don't know what this meeting is for," she said. "But I would like to propose a ban on the use of the words 'I'm fine' when the person is clearly not." Tony frowned.
His name was Thanos, commonly regarded as the "Mad Titan". Not much was known about him, other than his reputation for going from world to world, eliminating half it's population and leaving the survivors behind reeling in his wake. Just the simple mention of his name in some parts of the galaxy would strike fear in the hearts of millions. Loki was one of those millions. His heart slammed in his chest as Thanos got up, descended his throne, and walked over to Loki to regard him.
At that point, Steve was frustrated. He was wondering if he should go back to the table and restart his search from there when he heard a commotion. He could clearly recognize Tony and Lara's voices screaming at each other. Immediately, he followed the shouting out into the hallway and caught sight of Tony and Lara stepping out into the foyer. They stopped before they could go through the second set of doors leading outside, which caused Steve to slow his pace a bit.
"No, you're not," Steve said for what felt like the billionth time. "People don't get this drunk unless something's wrong."
"Captain Rogers," the man said. "I was just coming to check up on you. Agent Wylie. I work with Dr. Fox." He held out his hand to shake. Steve took it but remained wary. Tony's warnings about patient rights and blood tests ringing clearly in his ears. "So, how are you feeling?" the agent asked. "Notice anything unusual?"
It continued all throughout the night and into the next morning. His old neighbors, Audrey's teacher who had testified against him in court, the warden of the prison he was held in, the police officers who arrested him, several corrections officers who had tormented him over the years… All of them were getting their due one by one. Knežević tried to savor the sweet, glorious feeling that serial killing brought him.
supposed to do that." Recognizing all too well where these words were coming from, Clint forced himself to sit up and scooched to sit next to her.
"I would start with that stick of his," Steve said. "It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon."
"What do you mean?" Tony asked. "All of this came from you." Pepper shook her head with a slight laugh.
With one task struck down, Steve turned back to see Natasha standing just a few feet behind him. He jumped a bit in shock and realized that even with his enhanced hearing, he hadn't been able to hear her coming up behind him. She was good, he'd give her that at least.
Now you're probably wondering why you'll want to kill me. I mean, we're leaving off on a good note. Tony's getting help. He's going to be okay, right. Well, you'll just have to wait to find out. ...And that's where the bad news comes in.
"Alright then," Tony said, and the call swiftly ended. Tony put the phone back on the nightstand and promptly went back to staring at the backs of his eyelids, waiting for sleep to come.
Steve tried to come up with a reasonable explanation, but all he found was a whole lot of nothing. His emotions were running higher and faster than he had ever experienced before. It felt like the world was closing in on him. He needed to get away. It was becoming too much.
So, yeah, hopefully, you're not too mad at me for stopping here for right now. The deleted scenes for Better to Be Fake and Happy took up the last post-date spot for July. I'm not going to be posting in August because:
Happy Father's Day to any potential Fathers out there, and if you're not a father, just think of it this way: Only five more months until Not a Father's Day rolls around!
"That can't be right." Smith tilted his head back down so she could look in his eyes. "So far your vitals appear to still be normal…"
Tony just gave Pepper a look that said "you see what I have to deal with?" Pepper shook her head dismissively.
The first thing he did once he was released from prison was call his wife's sister, who was granted custody of his daughters after he was arrested. He leaned back against the glass of the phone booth as he listened to the seemingly endless ringing of the line as his call connected and hoped that she hadn't changed her number in the past few years.
"I don't have a minute." Duran got up and went inside the building, heading straight for its facilities. The second they came into view, the brunette woman who was sitting with Nina before stepped out of the women's room.
"You know what, just give me the strongest thing you have." He just wanted to be done with the pain already.
Anyways, I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and I hope I didn't scare you too much. Just so you know, I'm dangerously close to catching up with myself. I'm currently writing Chapter Twenty-Seven, but thankfully my next post dates are November Fifth and November Eleventh, so hopefully, that will be enough time to make some headway. Be aware, though, that updates could get more sporadic.
It was no secret that in addition to destroying worlds, Thanos also searched for the Infinity Stones. No one knew his motivation or purpose behind it, but rumor had it he had stolen the Mind Stone from the royal vault of a planet he conquered some time ago. No one had seen it for years and Thanos killed anyone with intentions of taking it back from him on the spot. Regardless, Loki knew that if Thanos was willing to destroy an entire planet just to get one Infinity Stone, he'd probably be willing to do anything to get another. Loki could use that to his advantage. His life depended on it.
"Except it does." Tony pretended not to hear that half-muttered comment. Instead, he took a sip off his glass and stole another sidelong glance at Steve. This time when he looked at Steve, however, he saw Steve looking at him rather concerned.
"My daughter," Knežvić clarified. "I haven't seen her in so long. Do you think I could find a picture of her if I searched?"
"I know," Tony said. "And I'm sorry I put you through that. You never should have had to, but…" Tony sighed. "I'd like to say that it's not going to happen again, but I can't because I know myself. I'm a dumpster fire with literally no impulse control. I know that I'll eventually end up drinking again just like I know that it's eventually going to rain. I'm not going to succeed at this, Steve. I know that. So please, take this as a warning: get off the ride before you get hurt."
"Rogers," Fury said, clearly none too pleased. "We gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're making…"
"I took care of the apartment," she said. "I haven't gotten to the rest of the penthouse yet. I didn't have enough time."
"Yeah." Steve didn't realize how close he was to drifting off himself until he heard the tired edge to his voice.
"It gives us plausible deniability with the World Security Council," Fury said. "It also prevents the possibility of any of them becoming compromised."
"Which of course it is," Freeman added from where he was sitting behind them. "The press has been going crazy trying to get interviews and statements from you guys for months. I'm surprised they never tried to break down the doors to Stark Tower with the way they've been constantly calling the PR offices."
It wasn't the boredom that was taking its toll on her, it was the fact that she didn't have anything to distract her from the pain. Every time she closed her eyes she saw Nina being turned to stone. The image of her girlfriend's horrified face in her last moments of life haunted her. She tried talking to the prison psychologist, but that was less than helpful. The only thing that was keeping her from attempting to escape was the fact that this prison was meant to contain people like her and much worse. Oh, so much worse.
"I don't want to know how she can be so sure of that," Bruce said as he ladled the soup into the bowl.
Turning around to look back at the box, Knežević was stunned by the appearance of the box he slept in the night before. What was once cardboard being now a large coffin-like stone that was yellow in color? In attempting to lift it up, Knežević found that the "box" was much denser and heavier than the cardboard version. Putting his hands on his hips, Knežević was completely stumped. There was no logical explanation for the change. That was until his shorts started changing to solid stone around him.
"No," Tony said. "But I don't think I'm going to puke right this second, so I'd say that's good." Another wave of nausea would probably grip him in the next fifteen seconds. He was going to enjoy this respite while it lasted.
Stepping out of the room, Lara was surprised to see Bruce standing at the teller's counter, talking to the woman behind the desk. Before she could approach him, Lucy walked right up to her, coming to stand so close that she was invading Lara's personal space.
Tony stepped out of the way fast enough that he narrowly avoided having the countertop come down on his toes. For a second, he had to gasp in shock while he pressed a hand to his chest. He didn't think his heart was beating too abnormally given the circumstance, but he still had to check. Assured that he wasn't having a heart attack, Tony turned his scrutiny to his fingers and toes. All of them were attached and there were no tell-tale signs of bruising or bleeding, so he figured he was good to go on that front.
"Yeah, sure," Pepper said. "Go ahead." Lara took off in the direction Pepper just came from. Steve was going to follow her, but Pepper caught him by the arm. "Um, Steve, is it alright if I talk to you for a second?" Steve tilted his head a furrowed his brow but nodded nonetheless. Pepper took a deep breath and looked him in the eye. "Listen, I'm sorry I gave you the third-degree earlier. It was nothing personal, just a stressful situation and I didn't know who you were or your intentions. That's all. No hard feelings?"
Other than that, a lot didn't add up. Why would New Horizons or even Roxxon want the Avengers dead? The letter implied that this was the result of a rouge employee's personal vendetta, but there would need to be more than one person involved in something like this. Even with all their individual expertise, neither Bruce nor Betty would have been able to produce a genetically modified strain of Ebola or H5N1 by themselves. Sharing what he found in his research with her, Betty seemed to concur.
She tried to listen in on the conversation the woman was having with who she assumed was her superior, but likewise to her surroundings, there wasn't much interesting to be found. Once she explained the situation, the woman gave mostly yes or no answers. Not being able to gain anything from that, it took all the strength Carol had not to start pacing out of sheer impatience.
Before Carol could finish the story, though, Captain Rogers had returned with a man who was introduced as Col. James Rhodes. Everyone got caught up in greeting the newcomer, much to Carol's simultaneous relief and chagrin. As thankful as she was for the distraction, she wanted to finish the story right then and there. After all, who knew what changes and contradictions her mind would come up with between then and when they got back to it. Regardless, Carol allowed everyone to chat and catch up with their friend and followed the crowd into the kitchen when the conversation started drifting towards what to eat. Even at that point, Lucky had abandoned her to go back to his owner. It made her feel quite alone, and honestly that is what she was; alone in a sea of strangers who probably thought of her as their enemy. That was still a feeling she could bear, though, as it was how she felt most of the time, anyway.
"Good, good." He then got up and went around the table to Tony's side and put a hand on his boyfriend's shoulder. "Honey, why didn't you tell me you weren't feeling good?" Tony shrugged.
"Yeah, I know," he said. "You sent that damn video to Pepper." Natasha had to think for a moment before she realized what he was talking about.
"Come on," she said, gesturing back down the hall. "You can tell me about her while we work on irradiating that letter."
"I know you're doing things to hurt yourself," Steve admitted. "And I haven't been doing anything to stop it."
"You're right." Jessica stood up with a pained grimace. Carol was going to question what was wrong when she was pulled into a hug. "Again, thank you for coming. You really didn't need to."
"Good," Tony said. "That'll be all for now." The crew member went off to complete his next task. Tony turned his attention back to Pepper.
The consequence of sending their souls to Earth was complete and total memory loss. No one could remember their previous life as a Raël. That's where the People's Unity Church came in. As their leader – Daniel Adoniram – had been awakened by a being known as the Supreme Understanding, he was given the abilities to restore the memories lost. He devised a series of "tests" to draw the memories and one's "true personality" to the forefront. Once fully awakened, the person would be completely integrated into the Church's community. There was nothing written about what happened after that.
The door to Pepper's office was open and her assistant wasn't at his desk, so Tony took that as an invitation to walk right in. His suspicions were immediately proven right as several people had gathered in the room including Happy, Cabe, Pepper's assistant, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent (judging by the eagle insignia on the blonde woman's uniform), a cop, a half-dead homeless woman sprawled out an unconscious on one of the couches, and of course, Pepper herself. She was sitting at her desk with her eyes shut and was rubbing her temples. From the scene, Tony could only guess at what was happening.
"I'll keep that in mind," Tony called over his shoulder as he and Steve left the second-in-command of S.H.I.E.L.D. standing angrily in the dust. Once they were out of the building, Tony turned to Steve and smiled.
"Because everything is my fault," Clint said. "I'm the reason that so many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents died. I'm the one who almost brought down the hell carrier. I helped Loki escape with the Tesseract. I'm the reason that…" Clint stopped himself before he could finish that sentence.
"That sounds perfect!" Knežević said in amazement. "So you'll be able to show me everything with this?"
"Vital signs are stable, but he still shows no signs of waking up," Hill explained. "We're still going through the old SSR files to see if we can find information on his physiology, but so far, no luck."
Quiet. That was the first thing Tony observed once he flew through the portal; everything was quiet. He was deep in the depths of space. He wished he could say that he was impressed. Growing up watching things like
Steve's answer hung in the air for a long time. Tony seemed like he was shocked into silence for a bit, and honestly Steve couldn't blame him. Every day it got harder to remember a time where he wasn't anxious, worried about someone else, mourning, or just plain felt lost and out of place. Although, yes, he could remember plenty of times he was happy, as he went through his memories to more recent times, those moments were fewer and father between.
"Sure thing," she said. "Anything else?" Tony shook his head. "Alright, I'll be here so let me know if you need anything else."
"Actually, yes. Do you know where I can use a phone?" A look of confusion overtook the agent's face.
"We don't need you to consult on anything," Coulson said. "We just need to know if you have access to any of your father's old research files."
"Now what's going on over there?" Rhodey asked. "I just walked in the front door after two weeks of being out of the country and I get this text that you're going to do something stupid. Please tell me that no one stole your tech and now you have to go blow them up." Tony sighed and stepped over to a bench a few feet away.
"No way," Tony said. "I went back to the hotel as you and Lara wanted me to! Now that there's no risk of damaging someone's public reputation, I should be allowed to do whatever the hell I want!"
"And you can do it," Steve said. "I know you can." Tony smiled for a moment, but it quickly faded back into a frown.
So, when Loki asked him what the Tesseract had shown him, he answered honestly and said his next target. Well, somewhat honestly. That wasn't all, but that's the information he had somehow telepathically been given and needed to share at that moment, and when asked what he needed to execute that mission, he once again answered with full honesty.
"He's in the room I just came out of," she reported. "I noticed he has frostbite on his toes, but the rest of his body seems fine. He's asleep right now. I took off his wet clothes and piled as many blankets as I could on top of him." The doctor smiled.
"No, she didn't." Tony had to cut her off before she said the words aloud. "If she did, I would be trying to pry ABC from Walt Disney's cold, dead hands just so I could have the honor of firing her myself. She did bring up every other horrible thing that I've done, though. The whole thing was a mess, but I've been assured that she went completely off-script and she will definitely never be on-air again."
The next half hour went by uneventfully. No one came in, no one left. The dullness of it all threatened to put Knežvić to sleep. In fact, he was certain that the girl had fallen asleep at the bar and was about to go shake her awake and throw her out when he heard a sudden bark of laughter come from her.
"You could have," Steve said. "But I need to know." Natasha stared at him for a moment longer before slowly nodding.
Lara struggled to keep a solid grip on the boxes while she pushed the glass door leading into the penthouse open. The boxes were not exactly heavy, but the weight was distributed rather awkwardly in both, making them a pain to carry. She managed to make it through the door, but she had to put the boxes down and catch her breath afterward. Her bullet-wound scar was not happy with her.
Stane did not know yet, and that kept one problem at bay for now. It was still likely he'd find out through less than preferable means thanks to the pack of wild vultures outside, but it was still one less thing that needed to be dealt with right away and Rhodey absolutely appreciated that as he didn't want to be the on the receiving end of the potential fallout. Then again, he did not want Tony to be either – especially when he was not conscious and could not defend himself – so it was really a lose-lose situation. Regardless, Stane did not know yet and Rhodey would take the blessings he could get.
If Tony had, to be honest, he thought S.H.I.E.L.D. was overblowing the danger "Steve Rogers" presented to him. Yes, the guy could probably lift a car over his head without breaking a sweat, but that didn't automatically mean he was going to go on a rampage and kill everyone. Though, he had to cut them some slack. The Harlem incident was still fresh in everyone's minds. It made sense why they were being so cautious.
"If you couldn't handle it, then you shouldn't have had breakfast up here." Tony kept his gaze on Steve, so he had no idea how Lara looked, but his best guess would be annoyed.
were concerned, but Steve couldn't help it. Tony looked so content and peaceful as he slept. Not to mention that he was enjoying the little bit of contact they had a lot more than he probably should. Regardless, the biggest reason why he let Tony continue to sleep without being disturbed was a simple fact that Tony was sick and needed the rest. It was just as simple as that.
Tony then took his drink and headed down to the lab. It was six AM and he had only three hours before his flight. He told Conroy to show up at eight o'clock, sharp, so he'd quickly verse her in how to politely tell anyone who called for him that he was unavailable and where she should say the caller should stick it if they ignored her and still demanded to speak to him. If whatever it was they were calling about was truly that important, he'd be hearing about it from Pepper on his personal cell long before anyone else at the company thought to call him on his business line. Also, S.H.I.E.L.D. seemed to have his personal cell number, so once again he'd be most likely called on that if some world-ending emergency took place. …Oh, he'd just see it on TV. Whatever came first.
"As safe as anyone can be given the situation, I guess," she said. "I mean, I'm staying with a Secret Service agent qualified to protect the President, so I don't think I could get safer than that without going on an extended vacation to Riker's Island."
"Shit," she cursed, bringing a hand to her forehead. "And it's been modified to be anti-biotic resistant?"
"I don't give a damn about what I deserve," Steve said. "What I care about is what you deserve, and that is someone who will stick by you no matter what." He took Tony's hand. "If you want to get sober, I'll help you. If you relapse, I'll be right there to help you set yourself straight again. I promise that I'll always be there for you." A tear spilled over and dribbled down Tony's cheek.
"He's not slowing down." Tony might have the armor protecting him, but Steve doubted that he could walk away from a fall like that unscathed. Beside him, Thor began to swing his hammer, but it was taking too long. There was no way he could get to Tony before he hit the ground. Fortunately, they had a Hulk.
"Alright, listen up," he said. "Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment." He turned to Clint and pointed at a nearby building. "Barton, I want you on that roof. Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays." He then turned to Tony. "Tony, you've got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash."
"Then you should be out," Fury remarked as he stepped closer. "Celebrating, seeing the world." Steve resisted the urge to scoff at that, instead choosing to step away and unwrap the athletic tape from around his hands.
"Well, it's kind of obvious with the name change," Bruce pointed out. "But I'm happy for you. I hope you and Leonard are happy and had a wonderful day."
"Eh, it was worth a…" Before Tony could finish that sentence, the holographic screens lit up and started flashing, indicating that it had found a match.
"Ich libe ditch!" Tony was out of the room before Steve could properly translate out what that meant.
As soon as Tony woke up that morning, he was having second thoughts. Well, not really second thoughts. Second thoughts implied that he had the option to back out. He didn't. He told everyone not to listen to him if he tried to back out and take him to the therapist's office kicking and screaming if they had to. (Steve had outright refused to let it come to that, but the looks Rhodey and Pepper exchanged told him they'd do their best to follow through with that promise, no matter how much they didn't like it.) No, Tony's thoughts were more along the lines of "please let some horrible accident befall me within the next few hours so I don't have to go." That wasn't to say he was suicidal – he figured a nice ambulance ride and a CAT scan would do the trick – but he wasn't going to actively stop any physical harm from coming to him. He just hoped the fates would be kind enough to help him out.
"So, you think she lied to you when you held her at knifepoint?" Natasha turned her head so fast that she could have given herself whiplash. "Yeah, I know about that." Nat swallowed hard before directing her gaze downwards.
"A bit?" she questioned. "Not totally?" Tony shook his head and a disbelieving look crossed Pepper's face. "Why? I mean you trust JARVIS with everything. I can't imagine why you'd doubt him."
"What about Steve?" Tony tried to swallow around the knot in his throat, hoping beyond hope that Steve hadn't…
"The kind where you go out on dates," Steve said. "And hold your lover in public. The kind where no one is going to make you feel ashamed for who you are and what you're doing."
"No," Steve said. "Will you be alright going in there on your own?" Tony's eyebrows knitted together.
"It's alright if you're not out," she said. "I promise, I won't tell anyone. I just need to know if anything happened because if something did and Tony didn't remember it…" Hearing the deep, grim tone in the way Pepper trailed off, Steve pushed his fear aside and looked at Pepper dead-on.
The door opened and Steve was the first one to walk out with Tony following close behind him. As Tony was halfway out the door, though, he felt another hand grab his free one urgently. He looked behind him to see Romanoff holding his hand and reaching back to grab Bruce's. Tony was perplexed as to why she would do this until he looked back at Steve and realized their hands were still entwined.
Eventually, the conversation had reached its natural end and Tony was collecting up their burger wrappers to throw in the trash. Steve knew that Tony was going to have to leave soon. He was sad but understood that he had other places to be. Steve expected Tony to go straight from the trash bin to the door but was surprised when Tony came back to the bed and leaned in close so that his lips were right next to Steve's ear.
Hill's eyes flitted back and forth between Betty and Bruce. Clearly, she hadn't made the connection beforehand.
"Well, you should know, Captain Danvers," he said. "Since our intelligence tells us that you are one of them."
"We didn't know what we were walking into down here," she explained. "It's always best to come prepared."
"Take my advice," she said. "Do what the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent says before you end up with a steel-toed boot stuck up your ass." Freeman gave her a sharp glare, but before he could properly respond, Pepper caught their attention by hastily hanging up her phone call. Relief was clear on her face.
"Are you sure you'll be fine with just the two of you?" Bruce asked as Steve and Natasha paused at the top of the stairs to make sure that all their gear was properly secured.
"Mr. Jarvis," she clarified. "He became concerned when you wouldn't open the door for him or your mother."
As he was dragged, Loki saw there was no point in keeping up the façade and tried to fight back as best as he could. Although whatever had been wrong with his spine had now been fixed, he was still in an immense amount of pain from the other 128 broken bones throughout his body. Nonetheless, he still tried to hit, kick, twist, and do anything he could to get this person to let him go. He shouted that he was the (now former, but he didn't mention that) Regent of Asgard and demanded that they release him immediately and even tried to stab his captor with one of his concealed daggers. They immediately grabbed his hand and arm, twisting his wrist until he let go of the dagger with a loud and agonized scream. Once it hit the ground, the stranger quickly scooped it up and held the blade to his throat.
Steve felt a wave of excitement come over him at the thought of his boyfriend specifically making his uniform so that way he
"If I'm dying, I'm not going to rush it," he said. "I just don't want to know." Laura and the kids didn't know. It was only fair. Stark made a noise of agreement.
Duane Freeman patiently waited his turn in line for the breakfast buffet. He hadn't done anything out of the ordinary, nor had he contacted anyone since stepping in line. As far as anyone could tell, there was nothing suspicious about him. Natasha knew better, though, and kept a close eye on him.
Starting Saturday morning, Tony isolated himself a bit. It wasn't like he was entirely shutting the world out – he would respond if Steve tried to talk to him and was just as talkative as usual – but he spent most of his time either working on the MK13 armor in its assembly station or in his office continually opening a file on his computer and closing it again. Only in the past hour had he really seemed depressed. Well, outside of his lack of a desire to eat. It took a bit of convincing, but Steve got Tony to sit down and have dinner with him.
"No," Carol said. "He's probably too drunk to give us a straight answer anyways. It's best to just let him sleep it off and sober up."
"As were the apple cider vinegar and the grapefruit seed extract," JARVIS pointed out. "Are you sure you don't need to see a medical professional?"
"Right." Carol sucked in a breath through her teeth. "Well, the short version is that I flew into the building." Bruce's eyebrows knitted together.
"I don't want you to get hurt in any way," Steve said. "Even in ways I can't imagine." Tony smiled a bit at that.
"Will do." Duran offered her hand for Tony to shake. He did so wordlessly and with a nod before following Pepper back towards the executive offices.
Natasha shook her head and put all the sincerity she could into her voice as she said, "no. It was entirely about your wellbeing."
"Or you can just skip the extraneous effort and just fall asleep right now." Steve let out a deep sigh.
Steve did as told and pulled back the covers, getting into the bed without a moment of hesitation. Tony, meanwhile, pulled the blue blanket out from underneath him, and as soon as Steve was in bed with him, he spread it over the both. Steve enveloped Tony in his arms in a second.
You can alternatively call this chapter "interventions don't work unless the person wants help." (Warning: Long A/N)
Eventually, though, Tony began to snap out of it. Whatever paralysis that took a hold of him began to fade. He started to ease back onto his legs and got back up to a standing position, using his desk as leverage.
Steve opened his eyes to see that Tony had one hand on his stomach, the other hand gripping the railing tightly so that way he wouldn't fall over. The sight was enough to make Steve throw a hard glare at Tony before turning to walk away. Tony's hand flung out to grab his arm.
The room was absolutely broiling. Tony had to grip the arms of his chair to keep himself from trying to loosen his tie or roll up his sleeves. Several times he noticed Steve looking at him with worry out of the corner of his eye. He tried to smile as subtly as he could, just to reassure him, but he could never do it convincingly enough. For a moment, Tony wished he and Steve were out of the closet with their relationship, just so he could give him some proper reassurance without having to worry about what others would think of it. Maybe it was time to broach that subject with him…
"I'm sorry about this," she said as she extended her hand. "My name is Pepper Potts and I didn't mean to interrupt you. Miss Conroy – Tony's assistant – asked me to come and check on Tony. I'm a friend of his."
Deep down, Tony was certain of the answer to that. However, he didn't want to consciously acknowledge it. Instead, he just clung to Steve for dear life as the elevator reached it's intended destination.
"I get it now," Lara said as she raked her fingers through her hair. "I finally get it! I finally understand why so many celebrities have drug problems! It's the damn interviews! They're freaking murder!"
While Knežević was trying to convince her that this wasn't so bad (even trying to squish himself inside the box so there would be enough room for her, too) Oswin was staring off into space. She wondered how in the hell she'd gotten herself into this mess and wished nothing more than to have Nina by her side. Call it a sudden epiphany, but she realized this wasn't where she should be. She'd let her kleptomania get the best of her and now she'd lost practically everything. Her home was gone, all her possessions were gone, she just spent the day outrunning the cops with the Nutty Professor… Seriously, even if she was going to see some sort of profit from whatever "chemical compound" that dim-whit was trying to create, it just wasn't worth it anymore. Having no choice, Oswin turned around and started heading back into the city. This didn't go unnoticed by Knežević.
"Well, I was thinking of using 'Space Face' or 'Care Bear', but 'Killer Queen' does have a certain ring to it." Carol laughed.
" Tony made a point of shouting as loud as he could. "I don't give a fuck anymore! You wanna know what the fuck my problem is?"
"Sir," JARVIS' voice interrupted. "You're running a 105-degree fever. I suggest you seek medical help immediately."
"The maid," he explained. "She's the only other person here. I'm going to get some blankets to help start warming you up. Do you need anything?" Tony shook his head.
Natasha said nothing as she shut the door behind her and crossed the room to the chair opposite Sharpton. The two stared at each other silently for a moment. Sharpton's gaze carried all the hate in the world while Nat's face remained cold, calculated, and impassive. Slowly, she lowered herself into the chair, placing her hands down on the metal table, folded on top or each other. Another staring contest ensued until Sharpton finally became annoyed enough to speak up again.
After a night of heavy drinking, Tony disappeared from the hotel they were staying at. The Avengers searched for him, only to learn from Maria Hill that Tony was safe and with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Meanwhile, a still buzzed Tony has made a new friend in Carol Danvers.
"Headache, backache, shortness of breath, increased anxiety," Jessica listed off. "A few other things I can't remember now… Do you think we should wake him up and ask him how he's feeling?"
"Just that you better not be late for this board meeting, which is in…" Conroy glanced at her wristwatch and made a sound like that of a seal being eaten alive by a walrus. "Eight minutes, if the time is correct on this thing for once." Tony sure hoped it wasn't. He walked past Conroy and town towards his car. That's when he noticed the lack of strange vehicles in his driveway.
"Quiet, Captain," Natasha said, her eyes firmly on Subarian. "The Black Widow is working." Steve was going to say something to counter that, but Subarian beat him with his pleading.
"What's wrong, Clint?" Clint sighed and tried to sit down on the mattress. He had forgotten that he had slid it half-off the bedframe and slumped straight down to a spot on the floor. Undeterred, he just made himself comfortable where he landed.
"I'm sorry Cap," he said. "But as far as we know Agent Carter is the only surviving person on this Earth that knew you – before or after Captain America."
Lying on the dirty sidewalk and crying her eyes out, Oswin mentally berated herself for not hearing that Homeland Security Agent out. If she just stayed calm and complied with the woman, then maybe she would have gotten to Nina a second sooner and Knežević wouldn't have gotten to her. If only…
"I believe it's a way to test my loyalties," she said. "Gain their trust. It's nothing too complex. They want me to figure out how Stark Industries was robbed, probably so they can go in and rob it for themselves."
"Laser tag," were the only two words Fury needed to say to wipe the smirk of Carol's face. Tony wasn't sure what he just witnessed, but he was sure it was nothing he would ever see again, even if he lived to be a thousand and tried to appreciate the moment as best he could as Carol led him to the car.
"All those in favor, say 'aye.'" Again, a chorus of ayes followed, this time from Natasha, Bruce, and Clint. "The ayes have it. Motion carries."
"…sure, that's a good idea?" Bruce pieced together what the voice said. The door dampened the sound enough to where they could barely be heard clearly. It also didn't help that they were whispering. "I mean, you don't know what his reaction is going to be."
"Yes." Conroy's eyes squeezed shut for a second and she muttered something about owing someone fifty bucks, but after that moment passed, she held out her hand to him.
"Of course," Adoniram said. "But first, there's another matter we need to attend to." He looked Freeman directly in the eye. "I want you to find Sister Grace and tell her that I'm authorizing you to be moved from the Worker's Section to the Disciple's Wing." Freeman's mouth dropped.
"I can pay for it," Tony was quick to assure. The cashier – a boy who looked no older than fourteen – shook his head.
Laura hadn't freaked out about the dog – which was good – but he was starting to feel uneasy about her assessment of his behavior the more he thought about it. He wasn't that impulsive, was he? No, he couldn't be. Sure, he could admit that he may be rushed to decide a few times recently, but he would hardly call that impulsive. Besides, it hadn't hurt anyone, right?
Despite her best efforts to keep her story as clear and concise as possible, though, Carol could see that she was not quite convincing the three Avengers of her story. Banner and Barton were quick to pick up on the things that did not quite add up and question her about them. That was fine. She had been expecting something like that. What she was not expecting, however, was the deep, scrutinizing look Romanoff was giving her. It was as if she was dissecting every syllable that Carol spoke, trying to find the tiniest faults in every little thing she said. It was clear that Romanoff was not a trusting individual – none of them were, but her especially. Carol was certain that the only reason why she had managed to tell the story without dropping her confident façade was because Lucky the Golden Retriever puppy had jumped into her lap and honestly, petting the dog did wonders to help reassure her. It was nice to know she had someone on her side, even if that someone was less than eight weeks old and only cared about getting pet by pretty girls. She would take any comfort she could get.
The following explosion threw Oswin and Knežević clean across the street into the neighbor's yard. Luckily, no cars, fences, or other yard debris impeded their paths, so they both landed safely on the nice, hard ground. It wasn't a comfortable landing, but at least they weren't paralyzed.
"Is there something you'd like to share with the group, Mr. Stark?" Tony looked up to see all his employees' gazes on him and the HR representative standing with her arms crossed and an expectant look on her face. Pepper had the decency to look embarrassed while Tony just smiled and waved them off.
"Captain Rogers," she said as she stepped in front of them. "Mr. Stark, I'm surprised that you're still here." Tony frowned.
"I'm sorry," Oswin said. "I guess we should have thought this through a little more and came up with a solid plan before we started taking shots of Patron."
"Yeah, he could, but I wouldn't hold my breath for it." Tony looked down at the ground. They still hadn't heard from any doctors or nurses about Barton's condition, nor had Romanoff or Hill returned from wherever in the hospital they had disappeared to (which was likely the quarantine area.) The longer time dragged on without any news, the more anxious Tony felt. He didn't understand why. It's not like he was Barton's best friend or anything, but he still felt bad for him. He didn't deserve to die this way. No one did.
Tony didn't answer, but it wasn't out of spite. He genuinely didn't know how to answer that question. He knew what he should say, and he knew what the reality was. He should say "of course I feel fulfilled. I'm the owner of a Fortune 500 company. I have more money than most people could ever dream of having; expensive homes, exotic cars, and I'm dating Captain America. To put the icing on the cake, I am Iron Man. Of course, I'm happy with my life." However, the reality of all of that was vastly different. He wouldn't be there if that wasn't the case and he had a feeling Salinas already knew that. So, he remained silent, figuring that no answer was the best answer. Salinas would take it however he would. Salinas dropped his right foot and started pulling the other sock over his left.
"Well, it's nice to meet you all and wonderful to have you here," he said. "I think the lines are ready to go, so let's get down to business. We'll start with this young woman on the left and keep it going, left, right, left, right. Got it?" The crowd agreed and Joe gestured to the woman in question. "Go ahead, just say your name, who your question is for, and ask it." The girl nodded before nervously stepping forward to the microphone and asking her question. Tony didn't know who it was directed at, but it wasn't him, so he allowed himself the moment to tune out.
Loki squeezed his eyes shut and bit down on his tongue. Even though he didn't have it, he felt it necessary to exercise his right to remain silent now.
"No." Tony figured he might as well stick by that assertion. He'd already inadvertently dug a hole for himself. It was probably best to try and die in it.
"What do you mean?" Knežević squinted and chewed a little slower on his chip. "Can't you pick the lock or something?"
"Yup," Carol confirmed, popping the "p." "No one was seriously hurt." She then winced as she remembered Pepper. "Well, one woman sustained a cut on her cheek and a flash burn, but outside of that, everyone was fine."
Hacking into the California Department of Corrections' files, she learned that Vasyl Knežević was a Vietnamese child adopted by Eastern European immigrants (which explained the odd name.) He married straight out of high school and had his two daughters with his wife, Joyce. Everything seemed normal until you got to the part where he was laid off from his job, his wife died, the state took his kids away, and he was arrested for child endangerment and illegal production of deadly explosives. That was when it started to make sense. The cops were the ones who arrested him back in 1999, the corrections officers worked at the prison he was held in, the judge was the one who sentenced him, etc.
Okay, he was avoiding the issue. Not only was he going out of his way to distract himself, but he was also kind of avoiding talking to Pepper. He could admit that at the same time, though, he couldn't push himself to stop it. The only way he could see that ending was with him doing something stupid or with a fight. He thought maybe he should talk to someone about this, but he already talked to both Rhodey and Steve and he didn't feel like he had made much headway. He just felt like he was talking himself in circles. Nothing was getting solved and sadly, Tony was starting to think nothing could be solved. It was kind of disheartening…
Clint laid down and rolled onto his side, trying to make himself comfortable despite knowing that would be impossible. Nothing could ever make this situation comfortable. He was being quarantined after opening a bio-terror letter and everything in his mind was telling him that this was the end of the road. He wouldn't be able to say goodbye to Laura and the kids… Hell, Laura probably didn't even know what was happening. She was probably going about her workday, thinking she'd see him later when he came to drop off the dog. Little did she know, he'd be arriving much later than she expected; in a casket.
Looking around, Carol found the place to be just as drab as the foyer. The walls were painted a painfully bright shade of white, while the floor tiles were an off-putting yellowed brown color and were eroding away from years of wear and tear. The place was almost completely utilitarian, with no decorations, photos, or posters hanging on the walls. The only thing that served to detract from the main lobby's dreariness was a mural painted onto one of the walls.
"Hi," she said. "My name is Lucy and I was wondering if you two would like to take a personality assessment."
"I remember a shadow," Loki turned said. "Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss." As he said that, Loki couldn't help but feel a bit of uncertainty concerning that memory. However, he managed to cover it by throwing an extra bit of spite on to his words. "I, who was, and should be, king!"
"So the plane was like, sixty-five stories in the air and climbing, and everything seemed to be going good," Lara said. "Then the alarms started blaring and all the lights turned off. People were screaming, and you could just feel the plane getting pulled back down to Earth. It was terrifying just looking out the window you could see the ground rushing up fast and then
Loki didn't realize that he had spaced out for a second until he heard the Other say something that truly made his blood boil.
"No," Lorraine said. "I don't think that would be a good idea either." Knežević was left physically shaking from that blow.
However, that plan didn't factor in that sometimes the best weapons come in the form of words. Tony said something to Lara and Steve could clearly see her face drop. Within seconds Lara was distraught. She turned and headed back inside. Tony, meanwhile, turned and left the building. Steve could see that Lara was tearing up as she went to the front desk, but he figured she'd be fine. Now Tony was both the more dangerous one and the one more likely to be in danger; it was more crucial to get to him.
"Yeah," Lara said. "I didn't do horrible in science in high school, but mathematics is definitely more my forte."
Those observations made sense. After all, she was fighting and rescuing people all the time. She was sure to get a few bumps on the head from time to time. The damage from alcoholism seemed accurate, too. Also, if she had to guess, she had gotten the abrasion on her hippocampus from the incident that gave her powers. It was all consistent with what she knew, but something about it… Something just did not feel right. She could not shake the feeling that there was something else going on, but for as much as she wanted to know, she also did not want to know. Whatever was lingering below the surface needed to stay there. After all, she couldn't save anyone if she allowed it to completely tear her apart and tear her apart, she was certain it would.
Steve tried to follow in pursuit as well, but he only got three-quarters of the way to the end of the block before he got winded and had to catch his breath. He watched as Rebecca turned the corner and disappeared and Bucky followed closely behind her. It was then that Steve figured out how to stop her. Rebecca wasn't allowed to cross the street on her own. If Bucky didn't manage to catch her, she would most likely just keep going around the block and end up in front of the apartment building in which the Barnes' lived once again. So, once he was back to breathing (relatively) normally again, Steve positioned himself in front of the building and waited for Rebecca and Bucky to come running around the corner again.
"If you're done, would you mind sitting back down? I'd hate to make you." Sharpton gave Natasha a nasty look but complied. "Good. Now, if you wouldn't mind telling us who else involved in your plot…"
"Alright." Tony dropped it and the two of them stood there for a prolonged period of silence until a crew member began counting down the number of seconds until the press conference began.
fight back if someone tried to do something to him as drastic as a lobotomy. Of that, Steve could be absolutely certain. So, the fact that they hadn't heard a struggle, or a fight could only be promising.
That was, until he found himself in the field again, with the farmhouse still intact in the distance. The events replayed again and once everything went to black, it started again. Over and over Clint watched his entire family be killed. With each replay, Clint could feel himself die a little each time. He begged, pleaded to whoever was making this happen to stop, but each time he got no answer. He just watched it all happen again. Eventually, Clint had no choice but to give in to the fear.
"Goodnight, Tony." They drifted off after that, both feeling warm, comfortable, and most importantly of all, overjoyed. Even with everything that had happened over the past few days, both were just happy to have found a moment of solace in each other, however fleeting it might be in the grand scheme of things.
"It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice," she said. "I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?"
Stark just stared at her, his eyes completely uncomprehending. For a moment, Jessica thought the effects of the poison might be setting in. Then he spoke up.
"Dr. Griffith, why do the police need to be called?" Dr. Griffith slowly lets out an anxious breath.
Finding the switch, Steve flipped it on and light-filled the room. He expected to hear some groan of pain or grumble of annoyance, but he was met with silence. Opening the door further, he saw why. Absolutely no one was in there. Frowning, he turned back.
It took Steve all of twenty minutes to reach the top of the mountain. He would have gone faster, but the cliff was incredibly steep and unstable. One wrong move and he'd be sent tumbling down the cliff and forced to start all over again, and while he had superhuman healing, the idea of falling down a rocky incline didn't sound all that appealing to Steve, so he took it slow.
"This better work," he said before taking a sip of water. It was nice and cold and felt good on his throat. "I've tried literally everything already."
"I'm not mad about that," Tony said. "I'm not mad at you for anything right now. I just want to know what the hell's going on."
"Whatever it is, it can wait until later," she said. "What matters now is that you're not going to the State of the Union. I'm not going to let you."
It went on like this for a while. Before long, Natasha was able to smash the chair apart, allowing her to freely move and easily take out the two lackeys. When the boss tried to get up and take her out himself, she managed to tie a chain around his leg and push him through an open panel in the floor. Once that was taken care of, Natasha collected the phone and her shoes and began to make her way to the building's exit.
Tony recognized her but wasn't sure how. The long dark hair and green eyes rang a bell, but the look of shock was completely out of place. Her name tag read
Tony took a moment to relish in it. Although it did not mean his fear of falling asleep was cured, but it did feel nice to want to fall asleep for once. After a while, he could feel himself starting to drift off…
"No," he said. "She's just scared for her friend. He looked Hill in the eye. "It's not contagious at this point, right? She'll be fine?"
Tony forced himself to nod. In all honesty, he didn't want Pepper (or, rather, the company) suing the hotel and the police. In fact, he still didn't believe that he hadn't done anything wrong. He probably did something off-camera that he didn't remember and that instigated that sort of response from both the hotel and the police. After all, he was wasted beyond all reason at the time. It wouldn't be that crazy to assume…
"If you're so concerned with the company I keep, why didn't you question my relationship with Stane?" Fair clearly did not have anything to say to that. Tony turned his attention to the rest of the board. "That question goes for all of you. Do you have anything to say about that? Anything? No?"
Before he could stop himself, Steve found that he was wrapping his arms around Tony's waist. He expected Tony to try and push him away, so he was surprised when Tony returned the embrace. It was warm, and comforting, making Steve not ever want to let go.
"I'm pretty sure we told you yesterday that she was the one who was going to be interviewing you guys," she said. "You didn't have a problem with it then.
Frowning, Tony realized that he still had on his heavy winter jacket and shoes, while Steve had stripped down to just the sweat pants he had been wearing. Sitting back up, Tony removed the coat and toed off his boots. He realized he probably should brush his teeth, but his exhausted body didn't want to trek over to the bathroom until it had to. Dropping his coat on the floor, Tony wondered if he should take off his shirt as well. After a moment's consideration, he decided against it. Steve was already scared about how sick he was. He wasn't going to add the shock of seeing his chest to that. Pulling back the covers, Tony got into bed and snuggled up close to Steve.
"What did you do?" Carol put her hands on Jessica's shoulders and inspected her face for signs of injury. "Where's Fury?"
"I don't know," he said. "I really can't explain it. It's me, but it's not me at the same time. Does that make any sense?"
When they did, a whole parade was waiting for them. Banner, Lara, Steve, and Stark stood just outside the doors and within moments they were moving to greet them. It came as a little bit of a shock to Natasha, especially when Steve pulled her in for a quick, one-armed hug. Before he could pull away, she rushed the words out.
As Tony started falling down the rabbit hole of worry, the plane's captain's voice came over the intercom, advising all of them to fasten their seatbelts and prepare for takeoff. Tony did as he was told but couldn't help but wonder how long it would take for them to reach cruising altitude, whether anyone would notice if he got a drink at the bar at this early hour, and if they would judge him if they did. He got the feeling that the answer to that last one was yes.
"We all were," Natasha asserted. "In one way or another, we all were." Bruce and Clint nodded in agreement to that.
"I'm not Tony." Lara finally glanced behind her and saw that she had indeed been mistaken. Bruce had been waiting for her, not Tony.
"Car, please," Tony responded. "The last thing I need right now is the kind of attention an ambulance would bring." Tony had forced himself to sit up. It clearly took him a lot of effort as he swung his legs over to sit on the edge of the bed. Pepper put her hand on his shoulder.
"To get closure," Lara said. "To put a bookend to that chapter of your life once and for all; to properly say goodbye to her." Slowly, Bruce nodded a bit.
Stark was silent for the longest time before he finally asked, "was it at all personal? Did you deny me for the Avengers because you wanted to hurt me, upset me, or teach me a lesson?"
"Simple…" Tony listened to a hum that reverberated throughout Steve's body. "What's your favorite color?" Tony laughed. He couldn't help it. Of all the simple questions in the world, that one had to be the simplest. Nonetheless, Tony still answered it in a completely genuine manner.
"How so?" Since Tony had nuzzled his head into the juncture between Steve's shoulder and neck, it was impossible to miss the sound of Steve swallowing hard.
"Sir, it is now six-thirty in the morning," the AI said. "If you want to arrive to work on time, I suggest getting out of bed now." Tony groaned.
"I'm glad to hear that," he said. "I just needed you to know that story, because for the longest time I thought that was Tony at his lowest, but apparently he can fall much lower than that."
"You… You might not like everything you find," he said. "I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of."
Stepping straight down the hall, she walked into the kitchen to find Steve and Natasha exactly where JARVIS said they were. Steve appeared to be making sandwiches while Natasha sat at the counter with a triumphant smirk on her face.
To the right, there appeared to be a few sets of offices, again probably left over from when the space used to be a bank. Lucy led her over to one of these offices, lightly tapping on the door before partially opening it. She quietly conversed with whoever was inside before fully opening it and gesturing for Lara to go in. There, she saw a young man with blond hair sitting at a conference table. The only other pieces of furniture in the room were the chair he was sitting in and the one she was supposed to. Inexplicably, Lara felt a chill go down her spine.
Stepping inside, Tony reviewed the buttons on the control panel carefully. For the life of him, he couldn't remember which button led to the lobby. Was it the big "L" or the star? No, it had to be the one with the little man running away from the fire on it. Tony pressed that button and was met with disappointment. The elevator doors – which had started to close – suddenly slid back open and a loud buzzing noise emitted from the speaker above him. He clasped his hands over his ears and squeezed his eyes shut. If he thought the ding was bad…
Tony did not bat an eye. He knew what she was going to do; she was going to deny her part in what happened that fateful night and settle all the blame on his shoulders, just like everyone else. She encouraged him to go all out that night. She watched him drink until he could not talk in a straight line anymore. She saw him get into the armor and did not stop him. Yes, everything he did that night was his decision and he was responsible for his own actions, but she did not stop him from doing any of it. She just passively watched his destructive behavior and enabled every bad decision he made. Undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. operative or not, there was no excuse for that. So, Tony just sat there, patiently waiting to see what lies came gracefully falling from the world-renowned spy's lips.
Carol launched into an explanation of what she had overheard the previous night and her attempt to find out more information. Neither Fury nor Hill needed to be told that as soon as she heard the word "Kree," there was no keeping Carol away. She was going to get to the bottom of things no matter what. What took them by surprise, though, was the name of the group that she had been investigating.
"Yeah," Tony said. "Well, we talked about all of that and… I came to the decision to stop drinking." Tony squeezed Steve's hand hard as he said that. Steve squeezed back and ran his thumb over his knuckles, trying to convey the words "I'm here, you're safe" as best he could non-verbally. From the way Tony spoke, it was clear (at least to Steve) that he was expecting an overwhelmingly negative reaction. Instead, it seemed as though the entire room breathed a sigh of relief.
Tony wasn't sure how much time had passed. He wasn't even sure where he was or who he was talking to. He knew he started at the bar and was probably still at the event venue. Other than that, he was completely clueless.
"Yes, we do," Natasha said. "and I'm ordering you to stand down." Her voice was authoritative, and her eyes were hard.
"Tony," Peggy said. "Depending on what it is, I can't say I won't tell your mother and father. If it's something that puts you in danger…"
been absorbed in it.) Steve was no longer cooking and had taken the seat Natasha had been sitting in before. Nat, meanwhile, had gotten behind the counter and appeared to be rinsing off the dishes and putting them in the dishwasher. Also, Bruce had joined them and was working on eating his own plate of eggs at the end of the counter.
"You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to," Steve assured. "I just wanted you to know I know."
Then, mere seconds later (or it felt like seconds to Tony. He may have blacked out.) A door slammed open and people started screaming. He heard a distinctive shout of "Metro Police! Put your hands up!" Tony tried to comply but found he couldn't. He was completely unable to move. He couldn't even open his eyes until he felt a hand roughly grab him and drag him to his feet. Very unsteady, Tony moved in the direction the cop was pushing him in.
"Right away, Sir," the AI said as a loading screen popped out of the phone's holographic display. It was quickly replaced by an alphabetized list of all the files and documents found matching the set parameters. "Search completed, forty-eight results found. Anything else I can do for you, Sir?"
She slid into a seat at the table and waited for either Pepper or her assistant to get off the phone. Pepper paced back and forth; walking the length of two tables before turning around and going back. Lara didn't have to mentally translate any of what Pepper was saying to understand that the conversation wasn't going well. Pepper's assistant, meanwhile, kept a stone-cold face as he fed clipped responses into his phone's speaker. Lara gave the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent a look of pity. She was in for a long, boring day.
Loki and his minions have been spotted in Germany. S.H.I.E.L.D. moves quickly to attempt to capture them.
"No," Bruce said cutting Betty off before she could say the words aloud. "I haven't told her about what my father did, or anyone else for that matter. You, Jennifer, and obviously the Police are still the only ones that know." A guilty look crossed Betty's face.
"So, what's wrong with Christine Everhart?" Tony took notice of the way she slowly enunciated her words, so they came out clearly without an accent.
Despite how wonderful it was to wake up with his boyfriend beside him, Steve couldn't help but let his thoughts drift. They mostly consisted of concern for Tony, though. Honestly, he didn't know what to do or how to help him. It was clear that Tony's problems went beyond alcoholism and it wasn't as simple as stopping him from drinking. In all honesty, Steve wasn't even sure if his problems were even fixable. He hated the idea that Tony might be stuck this way, hurting himself forever, but that seemed like the only option compared to forcing him to behave the way others wanted him to, and Steve already knew that option wouldn't work out.
"I did," Freeman said. "But it's rather vague. I'm going to need some more details before it's ready to release to the press."
He wasn't sure how long he struggled to breathe, but he was sure that it was too long. It felt like forever before the nurses ran into the room and started intubating him. When they finally did it, it came as such a huge relief. For a second, he could have sworn he saw the light at the end of the tunnel, but it faded away as soon as sweet, sweet oxygen flooded his lungs. He was aware of the nurses reading out stats and someone turning off the alarms, but he didn't feel his senses fully return to him until Dr. Wayne was already well into explaining what was going on.
Cabe and the rest of the building's security team arrived within minutes. Say what you wanted about them; they never wasted time fooling around. Both Tony and Carol were quick to assure that it was an accident, and no one was seriously injured. However, for obvious reasons, Cabe was not going to take that at face value. She ordered everyone who wasn't security or maintenance staff out of the room. Everyone who fell into that category quickly complied, recognizing the implicit threat that anyone who failed to do so would be sorry about it.
"Whatever," she said. "I'm just here feeling guilty about the fact that I didn't stay with Pepper and all that time I spent not sleeping could have been spent keeping an eye on Freeman."
"Your worth." Loki was then thrown from the asteroid, just barely lucky enough to hit the ground of the larger asteroid below it. The wind was completely knocked out of him and he struggled for a few seconds to breathe. As far as he could tell, the vertebra that he had just repaired was now once again broken. Pain shot across his body at a mind-numbing pace. Loki fought to keep his head above water as darkness creeped in the edges of his vision.
