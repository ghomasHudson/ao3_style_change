He was caught off guard a bit when a girl suddenly approached him. She was short, had bright red hair and looked at him with a friendly smile. Great, people talking to him was the last thing he wanted.
“Cas!”, she exclaimed and signaled the boy, who captured Dean’s gaze, to join them.
After his second fight with Lisa of the day, that got interrupted by Pia once again, Dean this time left the girls behind to go and find his friends to talk to. He wondered why Cas had been so off before. He worried if he had done something, or if something had happened. But he didn’t see him once he went back inside. So Dean decided to sit down on a free spot at one of the sofas. He was still on his first beer, not really feeling like drinking tonight. To be honest he felt really exhausted in general. He may have figured out what to do with his life but now that that was resolved, all his attention went back to the things he tried so hard to suppress. And fighting with Lisa didn’t help. But this was for David. And if he decided to go home early, so would the girls have to and he wanted to give David more of a chance to speak to Pia. After all, it was his birthday.
“Having fun with you gIrLfRiEnD?”, Castiel threw the same attitude that he had gotten from Dean, back at him now.
“Well they’re fighting.”, she informed Cas and nodded towards where they were coming from.
“Hey guys, I’m so glad I finally get to meet you. I’m Lisa.”, Lisa said with a big smile that seemed genuine and reached out her hand to both of them. Castiel hated that she seemed nice. She always had. He’d love to be able to hate her, but he just couldn’t.
“Coke?”, she then asked Garth who nodded in reply.
Lisa was genuinely pissed at him and Dean couldn't blame her. He was pretty sure though 'I'm sorry I might have feelings for this quirky dude I met in drama club and have been in total denial about it' was the explanation she wanted.
Castiel cringed, as he always did when someone mentioned Dean having a girlfriend. But Charlie was right. And even though he appreciated her acknowledging the option that Castiel was not delusional and Dean’s behaviour DID mean something, he had decided that it was probably better to just give up and be miserable instead. It was just his heart that needed to catch up with his head.
“By the way, are Cas and the others already here?”, Dean then asked, completely unrelated.
Dean rolled his eyes and sighed. “Drama Club it is then.”
"Look, I just drifted off, I'm sorry.", he tried to lay the subject to rest but Lisa was having none of it.
Dean was really anticipating Cas’ reaction who seemed to be very interested to hear what was next. Dean told him about his conversation with Garth and then the phone call with Bobby, all while probably sounding like Sam that one time when the trailer for a new season of his favourite show dropped and he felt like ranting about it to Dean for hours. Even if he would never admit it, he liked it. There’s nothing quite like seeing the people you care about be excited about something.
(See the end of the chapter for
The next day, Dean couldn’t wait to find Cas and tell him about how he might have finally figured out what he wanted to do after High School. He had spent a good amount of time on the phone to Bobby last night, talking everything through and it had put him in a really good spirit. He hadn’t talked to his dad yet, and only told Sam because he seemed worried about Dean actually being in a good mood for once, but most of all, he actually just wanted to go and tell Cas about it, feeling like he owed to tell him as soon as possible. Cas had really tried to help Dean with all this as well and he felt like this was somehow a win for both of them, or whatever.
“Oh, Hello Dean.”, he said with a bit of a startled look on his face and what seemed to be a slightly deeper tone of voice than usual. It made Dean wonder if Cas maybe didn’t feel so good physically.
“I think you’d be an excellent tree.”, Crowley now joked, obviously thinking it was hilarious that Dean was about to fail his senior year.
“They’re trying to talk us out of moving in together after Graduation.”, Bess then chimed in. “It’s stupid, to be honest, they’re all saving money by it and it’s not like we’re signing some sort of livelong contract. Yeah we’re still young but that doesn’t mean it won’t work out between us. We’re old enough to make this decision by ourselves and if it’s a mistake, then it’s our mistake to make, you know.”
So I’ll probably take a week off and update this in 2 weeks again. I barely had time to finish this, actually wanted to upload yesterday but I made it finally yay 🎉 I wish everyone happy holidays, whether you celebrate Christmas or not, I hope you’re having a good time and good start in the new year :D <3
Finally, Dean addressed Cas.
So when it came to the next meeting, Dean tried to arrive a bit earlier than he normally would, which means actually on time. He was lucky though, that he meeting hadn’t started yet. The red haired girl wasn’t here waiting yet, either.
“I’m good, just a bit tired.”
This Chapter was never supposed to be this long, and I doubt I will keep up Chapters of this capacity, but yeah. I apologize if it's a bit chaotic, I didn't expect to have this much content planned for one chapter.
"Seriously? I asked enough times for you to explain what's wrong and you never do. I'm gonna be honest, I'm done trying to be understanding and thinking 'he'll talk to me eventually'. Because you won't, will you?"
The next week, after Dean had enrolled in the Drama Club, he made his way to the small theater they had in the basement of the school. He sometimes asked what it actually was that got him to the point in his life where he had to join the Drama Club, in a school, he only just stopped being the “new Kid” at and now had this risk of losing his newly established “football guy” status. Being forced to spend his Thursday afternoon with some nerds that actually enjoy being embarrassing in front of people and while probably being primarily girls, surely not the type of girls he liked. He saw a few students waiting in front of the backdoor, which was where he was told to go as well. He recognized some of them from his classes and even thinks one or two were friends with his brother, but he didn’t take the time to look at all of them carefully.
But before he could come up with an answer Lisa's friend showed up.
When Garth came back he was carrying two glasses with lemonade of which he handed one to Dean. After they had both taken a sip and put the glasses down on the table, Dean pointed to the brochures next to them.
After Dean suffered through what was a very uncomfortable, but luckily short, drama club session, he was finally free to go to football practice and afterwards walk home with his little brother Sam.
“So far so good.”, Dean said, keeping his subjective opinion out of it.
“Just as horrible as I thought. Only nerds and we had to play these stupid games and somehow they were actually enjoying it.”
“Then why don’t you start there? Talk to this Bobby guy, and see if that is an option for you. It’ll be really good to already know someone you can talk to.”, Garth suggested and Dean started to lean more into this idea. It was actually a pretty good idea, that he was surprised hadn’t come up before. Probably because all these guidance teachers never really asked him about his interests and only ever about what he was good at. Which wasn’t much. To be fair, he was pretty sure Cas once asked him too but Dean felt like it wasn’t something that would have impressed him so he didn’t mention it.
“Well… I always thought what Bobby does is actually pretty cool.”, he then realized.
“You okay?”, he asked Dean, who knew he was more quiet than usual. Especially held back for a party.
“Listen,”, she now turned to a more serious tone “I understand that you don’t want to risk it, in case there is something between you guys, so you’re not even giving other people a chance, but he does have a girlfriend. So whatever it is between the two of you, there is no reason for you to completely freeze out any other guy who makes an advance.”
“Are you any good?”, Garth asked and brought Dean back from memory lane, reminding him of the initiator for said memories coming back.
“What’s your problem?”, Cas then asked, and Dean felt like he had never heard him be this direct. Except that one time his friends tried to prank him.
“Who’s that?”, Dean then asked Garth, wanting to make sure he was right. Garth followed Dean’s hard stance.
“Thanks, I really just wanna make the best of … all this.”, he said and wildly gestured around him, which he immediately regret and wondered how stupid he must have looked.
I’m sorry I’m taking so long to update, but I’m currently having exams and can barely find the energy to write but I have a lot of plans for this so don’t worry, I will soon be back to regularly updating :) I'm a bit nervous about this Chapter because it went a bit different than planned so I hope you still like it :)
“And no better place to start with that than a party, am I right?”, he said half sarcastic, half genuine and raised his glass, which contained a mixture of Coke and Rum that Charlie had prepared for him. Charlie smiled and did the same.
"Honestly, Dean?", she asked, visibly annoyed with him. Dean didn't really know what to say.
“So when do you eat?”, Bess asked, knowing there was only a ten minute break between last period and Drama Club.
He didn’t catch the dark haired boy and his captivating eyes until their first break. He saw him across the hallway, too far away to call for him, but Dean was determined to  make it there before he lost sight. It was weird, he never really felt like wanting to tell anyone about something that happened in his life, whether it was significant or just a broken nail, but somehow it was exactly like this with Cas. Dean tried to put his long legs to use and focussed on the raven hair, now only peeking behind some tall guy from the baseball team. While walking over there, he was stopped by Lisa, who he hadn’t even seen at first.
“I get a snack on the way, it’s enough.”
“I think she died.”, Bess answered, which made Dean feel that pain in his stomach again. It was something that happened every time his mum was mentioned. He didn’t know how Bess knew about that, but at least he knew now, that he wouldn’t have to tell them in the future when the subject came up. Which it always did.
“Because no one has seen him for hours. And he wouldn’t just leave without telling me, we’re supposed to go home together. I can’t reach him, can’t find him and I think he’s really drunk. I’m worried, Dean. What if something happened?”
“Oh that’s Marcus. He works on the sets.”, he explained and Dean didn’t break his gaze at them for one second. They were standing awfully close to each other. “Good for him though.”, Garth then said and Dean finally turned his head to look at Garth questioning that statement. Garth noted the confusion on Dean’s face.
“It’s fine. I just don’t know how many more times I need to tell you that you can always talk to me if you’re stressed.”, Castiel explained and seemed a bit frustrated, which quite frankly Dean understood.
“Look, I’m really sorry for..”
Dean followed her gaze and oh dear was it eye catching.
“Anyway, I’m gonna go find David, give him our present and then get us some drinks.”, she got up and picked up the small bag she had placed next to her.
for ages and Dean really didn’t want him to make it a bigger deal than it was. Especially given that the person he actually did want to stay around was someone else.
“.. being a bit distant lately. It’s nothing personal I just…”
“Hey, yes, it’s nice to officially meet you.”, Charlie said, and shook her hand, as did Cas without saying anything though. It was a bit awkward all around, but Cas kept taking a sip of his glass whenever he noticed himself losing control over his fake expression. Dean didn’t even look at him really, so Cas decided not to bother and avoided his eyes as well. While thinking about not looking, he felt his eyes wander back to the tall boy’s face and
Garth rolled his eyes at a grinning Dean. “That was a gift, as a joke.”, he explains and Dean just raises his eyebrows as he puts the game back. Garth then picks up the game they actually met to play and tells Dean to check which of the controllers are fully charged before they get a start on the game.
“Ooh noo. I am Princess Dean of Kansas and I got abducted by an evil, evil dragon. I need a strong prince to come and save me or I will die.”, Alastair acted with a high pitch voice and pretended to faint afterwards. Crowley of course, was laughing, but Dean only rolled his eyes. He was really tired from a long day and wished he didn’t have to endure his friend’s usual stupidity. Luckily, Sam appeared and he got to leave the idiots to themselves.
“No, you’re right. I need to get over him.”, he said with a sad look on his face and got a small sympathetic nod in return. Now the atmosphere was a bit down, which Castiel really didn’t want. Not today. Not at one of his friends’ birthday party. This was a PARTY after all.
The group in front of him looked at him in disapprovement, but Dean didn’t fancy talking about this when it was such a small thing. He nodded them goodbye and left for football practice. He was still close enough though, to catch a bit of their conversation.
“No, I’m serious. My brother had the same issue back in High School. He somehow messed up with the courses he took, thought football would be enough and it wasn’t. Because he has no other talents whatsoever, he joined the drama club and ended up just playing a tree and that was it.”, Benny explained and to Dean’s surprise, it actually made sense.
He didn’t know if Sam had talked to his friends from there or not.
“I guess so. What about you?”, Garth asked with what felt like genuine interest.
“I saw you talk to that Marco guy,” Dean deliberately used the wrong name, “you seemed to be having fun.”
The meeting was a bit different then the one last week. Instead of starting off with some games, the teacher made them sit in a circle to talk about what play they would do. Dean wasn’t really interested, all he wanted was a small part that got him the credits but no embarrassment. He was hopeful though, as there were way more students in this club than he initially thought. Surely, there wouldn’t be enough parts for everyone. Every time he tried to listen to them discussing if they should do a musical, or comedy piece or drama piece, or whatever things Dean had no clue about, he immediately drifted off. And a few more times then he’d liked, he found his mind follow his eyes, as they kept glancing to Castiel. He wasn’t someone at the front of this discussion, but he did seem invested. Which was good, because he might have caught Dean staring otherwise. He wasn’t really staring to be fair, why would he be, but something about these blue eyes, combined with that blue sweater he wore, just kept Dean feeling like an invisible force was making him look at him. Luckily, he sat diagonal in front of him, so it wasn’t too obvious.
“This is Dean. He’s new here. He’s an idiot and doesn’t take this club seriously.”, She introduced him and Dean realized he was probably not gonna hear the end of this. Fair enough.
“Are you listening to me?”
After football practice, Dean and his friends were standing outside the school. Dean was waiting for Sam while Crowley and Alastair were smoking. Dean was the only one in the group who didn’t regularly smoke. If he did, then only at parties, or before exams.
“I think Dean would make a really pretty princess.”, Alastair tried imitating wearing a dress and twirled around, fluttering his eyelashes.
Cas opened his mouth to defend himself but closed it again. He knew she was right. She knew she was right. It was Dean Winchester of course. With his stupid eyes. His stupid crooked smile and superhero hair.
Dean swallowed. Did he?
Dean needed to get away asap his head was a mess.
Later that day, Dean and Garth had made plans to play this new video game, at Garth’s place, so after school Dean went home with him. He welcomed the distraction from everything else that was going on. And it’s not like he had that many people left to just hang out and play video games with. He would tell himself that Garth was just being very persuasive but actually Dean really needed a nice and chill afternoon just hanging out with a friend.
“I don’t know, I think I slept through half of it.”, Dean answered, trying to not be bothered.
“What?”, Castiel asked a little bit startled.
“This is really amazing!”, Cas said with a big smile on his face after Dean was done talking. “Honestly, I am so happy for you! I know how much this stressed you out.”
“Don’t worry, pretty boy. How about stage lightning? Or taking care of the sound system? That’s always something we’re shorthanded on. We can ask the teacher together next week.”
"Costumes?", he guessed but judging by the big sigh she let out, it was wrong.
“Oh, wow.”, Dean said impressed. Then something caught his eye. He picked up the shiny pink box that didn’t fit with the other, rather dark colourd games.
“Okay, but then let’s get a drink first.”, he suggested, hoping to delay her meeting his friends, maybe wishing for someone she knew to pop up and distract her. Or at least, for Dean to have had his beer before his head would explode with anxiety.
“They’re here.”, Charlie then slightly uneased exclaimed and Castiel thought she meant Garth and Bess at first, but when he followed her gaze he spotted them through the window. Dean. And of course, right next to him, Lisa.
He knew if anyone saw him having lunch with a bunch of nerds, he’d never hear the end of it. Luckily, he already had an excuse, that he didn’t even have to make up.
Some very fond memories of 7 year old Dean and 5 year old Sam, headbanging and embarrassingly dancing around the living room, impersonating a rock band, came flooding back. Even if shortly after his dad got mad at them for touching his record collection, Dean still remembered those days as one of the best.
“Oh really? Were you auditioning for the role of sleeping beauty?”, Crowley joked.
Dean and Lisa didn't say a single word to each other on the rest of the way to the party.
“You’re not finding them because you’re not actually looking. I’m convinced a cute gay guy could be obviously asking you out and you wouldn’t even notice because you’re so blinded by a certain green-eyed football player.”
“I am not awkward.”, Castiel tried defending himself, but a small snort from Garth, told Dean that they didn’t really believe that. His voice was way deeper than you’d expect it to be, but it somehow still fit him. Or at least Dean thought so, after all, he had only known this Castiel for the huge amount of one minute.
They were silent for a few more moments, but Dean wasn’t sure if Cas even expected him to say something. There was a really unfamiliar, uncomfortable vibe between them and Dean hated it.
Obviously it took me 6 months to write this chapter so it is incredibly messy, but after 6 months I just can't look at it anymore so here it is...I hope you still like it and have not abandoned this yet, I really am planning to finish this
“Sorry, Lis, but I can’t talk right now.”, he said almost while still passing, only leaving her standing there with her friends, calling something after him that drowned in the noises of the hallway. He didn’t even give another thought to it, as he tried to catch up to Castiel who already made his way around the corner. Finally he reached the smaller guy and stopped him by holding him back by his shoulder, almost making him jump.
Garth’s parents weren’t home when they arrived so they ordered Pizza and went to this room in Garth’s basement, which kinda looked like a diy-home theatre. It wasn’t really, it had a big TV and an old couch, but to Dean’s standard of playing video games on their little TV that looked like it was the first one invented, it seemed pretty neat. More impressive though, was Garth’s collection of games that were nicely stacked on a shelf.
“I can’t. I have football practice right after Drama club.”, he explained and pointed at the gym bag over his arm.
Once he reached the table to fill up his drink, Charlie appeared next to him shortly after.
"You don't know what–.", it seemed that she tried not to sound too angry but Dean could still feel the upset. "Do you even wanna be with me?", She then asked, staring right into his eyes.
Finally, Dean saw Garth and Bess arrive. He waved to them once they noticed him and they came to sit next to him.
“Thanks, yeah, I know it’s not exactly college or even a sure thing for now but...”
“Bobby?”, Garth asked, obviously not knowing who Dean was talking about.
“Well then maybe you have to start at the beginning to find out. What did you always want to do when you were a kid?”
"Did you just hear anything I said?", she asked him with a daring undertone.
Dean was shaken for a moment. When he saw the dark haired boy his heart suddenly did this thing that he couldn’t really explain and his eyes just didn’t want to move. Why was he so affected by his appearance? And how had he never noticed him before?
“What are you doing?”, he asked, trying not to sound too annoyed.
He was trying to find David, to say goodbye while Lisa and Pia would only quickly
“I just mean, I always felt like Marcus had a crush on Cas, he was just never interested because….”, he seemed to stop his words and change them, “well he just wasn’t. So I’m just saying, Marcus is a nice guy, so good for him if Cas changed his mind. Who knows, maybe he’ll even get lucky tonight.”
They did find David pretty fast though, he was just pointing some other guests to where they could find the drinks.
Dean and the girls approached him and wished him a Happy Birthday as they gave him their gift. Dean made it a point to introduce Lisa’s friend, Pia, the one that David had a crush on, making it seem like him getting Lisa to bring her wasn’t at all calculated. He could see it on David’s face though, he was nervous to meet her and it kind of made Dean smile. He knew how it felt.
“Exactly.”, Charlie said, as if she could read his mind. Sometimes Cas wondered if she actually could.
Castiel seemed to genuinely be excited for him and it only verified Dean’s intuition about going to tell him in person.
“I’m gonna go find them and say hi then.”, Dean announced. He gave David a pat on the shoulder leaving him and the girls behind. Or at least he had thought so, a few steps away and he noticed Lisa had turned to go with him. He looked at her, still feeling the tension of their fight before.
“Still beat your ass.”, he then added and the two of them laughed for a second, but then turned back to their initial topic. And Dean went deep in thought.
“I just feel like this is the first time I am actually excited about my future and I just really want y-”, Dean realized the huge error he was almost about to make and froze. Forced himself to just shut the fuck up right here and there. It felt like his head was spinning as he was just blank staring onto a slightly confused Castiel. Dean needed to find a way to resolve this little problem as soon as he could but as he was staring at Cas it got worse. He rather just forced himself to be quiet, say nothing, do nothing. He got this ache that he used to be able to suppress very well but apparently with all the happiness coming to the surface so did it. His eyes were luckily the only thing he couldn’t keep from doing something and he caught himself taking a glance at Cas’ lips. He felt his whole body wanting to just get closer, flashbacks came flooding back from the last time he had to fight against everything in him and luckily for Dean with it came the reason he was able to hold back. People. The little control he could gain over his eyes he used to change focus from Castiel’s flawless face to try and find something in the background. Jersey. Football Jersey. Three guys from Dean’s football team walked past right as Dean felt himself gain control over his everything again. There were people around. Judgy, mean, high school students. There was no need for Dean to embarrass himself by taking this leap and getting rejected anyway in front of other people. Not that he actually wanted to take the leap. Or do anything. Or say anything. Or ever would.
“Of course, you’d think that. You’re a nerd as well.”, Dean teased his little brother and gave him a little shoulder bump. “Anyway, this one girl actually tried introducing herself and talking to me. Are they all really that desperate to make friends?”
Later that night, still upset from his fight with Cas, Dean was making his way through the party guests. The first people were already leaving and the usual suspects were drunk on the couch, with their friends trying to get them to drink water. Dean didn’t want to be here anymore. This night came straight from hell and all he wanted was to go home and get to sleep. Forget all the fights he had tonight and find a way to figure out what he had done for Cas to be so mad at him and most importantly, how to fix it.
“I’m driving tonight.”, Garth explained to Dean once she left, not that Dean really wondered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, no I’m all good. This happens when I don’t get enough sleep. I was trying to study to get a headstart on the exam on Monday, so I don’t have to worry about it during David’s party, you know?”, he explained and reminded Dean of the party they were all going to attend tomorrow. He also remembered how he was supposed to get a gift together with Lisa and her friend that David wanted Dean to invite, which was probably what she wanted to talk to him about before. It would just have to wait.
“Okay, if you say so. Unless of course you’re-”, Castiel stopped before he finished the sentence.
When Dean and his brother were out of reach, Sam turned to him.
Sam shook his head.
“Excuse me?”, Castiel said and once Dean was looking at him again he picked up a note of disbelief.
“Honestly? I didn’t listen. I don’t even know what you decided on. I just want to be a tree in the background and that’s it.”, he explained.
Dean looked at his friend in disbelief. Why did he sound serious, when he must be joking? When Dean went to ask his friends for help, after being told he needed to join an additional Club at the school, to get enough credits to graduate, he didn’t expect to hear
“Oh god please no, why do they need to come here.”, Cas said a little panicked as he turned away taking a few breaths and yet another sip, that ended in him spilling some. He heard the door open and turned to face Dean and Lisa, faking a smile.
"You'll be alright. You'll move on from this, I can assure you of that. That has to remain true." He cupped one side of Dean's face. "Please?" Cas lifted his lips into a hopeful smile.
"Time doesn't mean anything here," Dean pointed out. "It's Heaven, Sammy."
Cas's hand covered Dean's where it was holding his face. "I would never willingly leave you," he said. He kept his hand in place even as his blood touched it. "Even in death, I'll find my way back to you." Dean could only manage a small, fake smile and nod.
Dean chuckled. "Sorry, but you make it way too easy," he said in a way that made it clear he wasn't sorry at all. He turned back to Sam, who was now looking anywhere but at the two of them. "Whatever you want's fine."
"I'm simply worried. I have no intentions of 'playing dirty' as you call it." Of course he had to use the air quotes.
Both Dean and Cas watched Jack leave. "You're one of us now?" Dean asked when they were alone.
"I imagine it would be very easy to do with this song," Cas admitted, smiling shyly. He looked anywhere but at Dean. When his eyes met Dean's, he looked away with his lips twitching into the ghost of another smile.
"You said you wanted me but knew you couldn't," Dean went on, "but I want it too, hell, it's the one thing I've wanted for years but never tried to get. I want all the corny romantic stuff with you, like seeing you every time I look at my phone because your perfect ass is my lock screen and I love your smile, Cas. I want to bake pie with you and let it burn because we got carried away making out in the kitchen while the pie was in the oven, and Cas, I want to take you out on dates and kiss you goodnight until we're both breathless."
Almost as if he knew what Cas was thinking, Dean called his phone. "Hello, Dean."
"He gave me a goddamn lecture for drinking, like I was a kid, Sammy! And then I told him he was making me feel weird, and he said I should have just talked to him. Sam, he said that he was so damn perfect, admitting his mistakes while I don't and I hold back everything." Dean sighed, frustrated. "He's being a pain in the ass."
Walking around a little more, Dean filled all of his thoughts. He saw him and his eyes, his wonderful green eyes, in every leaf and every blade of grass. If Dean wasn't with Sam and Jack, working, he'd head back to the bunker right now and surprise him with the ring. Dean had given Cas more than he realized, and he really did deserve something in return.
"It's not the worst job to have," Cas said thoughtfully, "and I enjoy the idea of being a hero to somebody, even if all I'm doing is eliminating creatures from homes."
"Because it's the truth. Hope is a wonderful thing, and to regain that hope in a situation like the one you were in after I was gone tells me you're not going to give up on me easily. You will always fight for me, just as I will always fight to keep you by my side."
"It's more bearable now. I have no idea why it appears to be getting better." Cas pulled the hand back slightly.
"No more grace is coming out," Jack reported. He nodded. "You're human now, right?"
"You'd give up being an angel?" Jack asked, making sure he got the story straight.
"You can't be serious, Cas," Dean said into the phone. "How the hell'd you lose your job now, huh?"
"Hello, Dean. How are you?" Cas asked, polite to a fault, even when he was speaking with his closest friend.
to be closer to Dean, even if it was just his voice, overwhelmed him. It was almost painful; Cas felt that he would die if he didn't do anything.
Cas's lips quirked up in a tentative smile. "Hello, Dean."
Mary smiled through her happy tears in the front row of seats. Dean had offered to let her walk him down the aisle, but she said that Sam was a better fit since he'd been there for Dean much longer than she had. Bobby said the same thing, but he was stubbornly refusing to cry next to Mary.
"Can't help it," Dean said with a shrug and a smile. "I've missed you, angel." He reached out and loosely intertwined their fingers together.
"I didn't expect anything different," the angel said with a thin smile. "You always were so stubborn."
The bunker was divided completely: Cas and Jack versus Dean, because Sam was staying out of it altogether.
"It's also what I want. And if I want something, I'll take it, Cas." Dean slowly smirked. "And I want you, angel."
If he, Sam and Jack pulled this off, Dean had a lot of things to tell Cas he felt bad about. At least Cas wouldn't criticize him or tell him he deserved to feel like crap for any of those things. If anything, Cas would be understanding. He'd look at Dean with his bluer than blue eyes and say all the right things to make the hunter feel better.
When Dean had imagined kissing the angel before, he imagined it leading to his bedroom with a trail of discarded clothing following them. Now, however, Dean knew that this kiss-- this kiss with no tongue and no sexual motives, this perfectly innocent and genuine kiss-- was better than anything he could have pictured in his head.
"In the beginning, when we first met," Cas said, "I only saw you as Michael's vessel. We were strangers to one another, and yet you stuck by me. You truly believed in me when I rebelled against everything I had ever known. Dean, you became the most important thing in Heaven or on Earth to me."
Jack was watching him skeptically. Dean shrugged with one shoulder. "It was worth a shot, come on."
He exhaled in a quiet display of relief when Cas looked away.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dean get closer, and then felt the hunter wrap his arms around him in a hug that was most definitely not what friends did.
Cas sighed and looked up at Dean, meeting his eyes. The green eyes he found so hypnotizing were wide with fear and worry. "I love you."
But Cas still let himself be held, because he already loved how it felt to be in Dean's arms.
Castiel, Angel of the Lord, was breathtaking. Intoxicating. And right now, he was all Dean's.
"You gonna keep looking at me like that? Come on." Dean pushed his chair back dramatically and stood up. "Don't use your puppy eyes or whatever to make me talk." He rolled his eyes.
"Screw you, damn it!" Dean forced himself to ignore the burning desire he had to kill Chuck where he stood. He looked down and into Cas's blue eyes. "You'll be okay, yeah? I promise, you aren't dying here, Cas," he insisted, sounding desperate even to himself.
He'd been staring at one page in a book for the paat five minutes at least when the bunker door opened. Hastily, he shoved the ring into his pocket and closed the book.
Jack looked up at him. "Don't worry, okay? I'm just as clueless as you, hell, I'm probably worse."
Suddenly, Cas's arms wrapped around Dean in a brief but affectionate embrace. "I promise to love you forever, Dean," and there was a ring sliding onto his finger. It felt perfect and right against Dean's skin.
Rather than answering, Dean began driving. He didn't stop anywhere. He checked on Cas every minute, taking note of every motion and facial expression he saw. "You okay?" he asked when his eyes flicked to the hand Cas now had pressed to his wound.
He walked into Sam's room with purposeful strides, interrupting his younger brother's reading. Under any other circumstances Dean would have teased Sam for being a nerd. "Do it, okay? Get it the hell over with."
"Does this make Dean my father and Sam my uncle?" Jack asked.
Chuckling at the fact that Rowena—Crowley's mother and the queen of Hell—was a guest at his wedding, Dean nodded and led the way out of the room.
The two of them didn't move for a good minute or so. Neither of them even spoke. Cas didn't ask questions when Dean gazed down at him, gently stroking his hair. It was as if the whole experience had driven Dean to not hold back with the affection Cas had always known he had towards him. "I don't want to leave you like this," Cas said quietly.
Human. If only an angel or demon could go to the Empty, then...
"I meant I like having you around, Cas," Dean clarified. "Plus, Sammy decided to give the kid some of his rabbit food. I needed someone on my side to teach him what good stuff actually is."
"I made a deal with the Empty," he tried first. That was too direct, and Cas sounded far too casual saying it. Maybe it hadn't set in yet.
"I did too, angel." Dean smiled and cupped Cas's face in his hands. He pulled him in for one more kiss before Sam making gagging noises interrupted them. Dean flipped his brother off without looking in his direction.
Dean sighed. "Yeah, yeah. If this goes wrong I'm going to kill you," he said halfheartedly. "Now go. No chick flick moments, Sammy." He firmly patted Sam's back to get him moving.
The voice came as a shock to Castiel, not because he was hearing something other than his own repetitive footsteps echoing around him, but because of who it was. What did it mean that he was here?
Sam nodded and walked away, but Cas didn't miss that he still was close enough to see everything. "You don't seem to have anything to say," Cas said to Dean. He dropped his hand.
"Yeah, Sammy," Dean said, and Cas already knew Sam was watching them now. "Give me a minute, okay?"
Looking over the record, Dean had to admit it could have been worse. It was an Elvis song,
"It's worth a shot, right?" Dean offered, desperately clinging onto the hope everything would be alright.
Normally Dean would scoff and just think Cas was being stubborn and not feel offended. But now it was almost comical how quickly he resorted to acting like he was being punished. Cas was a stubborn son of a bitch, yes, but he'd always texted back in less than a minute. Even if he was texting one-word responses.
"How many is that?" Sam asked worriedly, pointing to the beer Dean had started in on and the second in his other hand.
"You want to be a hero? That's freaking inspirational, Cas." Dean approvingly clapped Cas on the shoulder.
"You're welcome." Dean, no longer in much of a joking mood, repressed a soft smile at the sight of Cas's, turning his head away so he wouldn't be tempted by those lips and softening blue eyes set attentively on him. "I'm gonna order some food. If you want to stay for a bit, 't's cool with me."
If there was one thing Cas knew for sure, it was that he couldn't handle Dean's hateful words and actions much longer. It hurt, having the person you love treat you like you were less than nothing to them.
The angel was already shaking his head. "I haven't finished," he said with an attempted laugh. Then he turned serious. "I always wished for you to be happy. Seeing you like this hurts more than you know."
All too soon, the marked hole in the ground came into view. The blue fabric of the tie was getting dirtier the longer it was there. Dean looked up at the sky; it was cloudy and threatening to rain. The weather was a perfect reflection of what the hunter was feeling.
By the time Dean finished setting up the computer on the coffee table's glass surface, a single firm knock sounded at the front door, followed by a familiar gravelly voice calling, "Dean? Open the door."
So what if there was something different going on with Cas? He was family. He was the best friend Dean had ever had, and the guy had given up so damn much for him since they first met in that barn.
If Cas ever realized that Dean had lost all hope... just the thought of how Cas would react was enough to kick his ass into high gear.
Cas suddenly reached for Dean's hand, holding it in his own like he had when he was dying. He lifted Dean's face to look at him-- really look at him-- and Dean didn't stop him or ask what was happening.
"Dean," Cas said soothingly. Of course Cas would be comforting Dean while being killed, Dean thought. Of freaking course. "I know. I've known-" Cas grimaced, eyes squeezing shut, and Dean's vision got blurry. "-the whole time." He offered a small, pained smile before drawing in a sharp breath.
"That worked out well. You're here still," Dean laughed. "Couldn't go back, huh? Did they kick you out again?"
"Jack. Can I-" Dean heard Cas ask. He didn't realize Cas had released Jack from his grasp until a strong hand lifted his chin. He gazed directly into eyes that had seen endless miracles but looked at Dean like the hunter was the most amazing thing out of them all.
Nobody else dared to speak. Cas was wide-eyed and his mouth was open slightly. "But I can't not have you, angel, because I've been going through hell every day without you." He swiped at the tears that now boldly raced down the side of his face.
He had no reason to be acting like a teenaged kid who'd been caught with a Playboy managzine in his room in front of Cas. Hell, Cas knew him better than most people and didn't judge him. But Dean still felt mildly ashamed about the website for some reason, and the feeling got worse under Cas's squinty-eyed stare.
The ring was cool to the touch and smooth when Cas tried it on, slipping it onto his hand. It fit his right middle finger almost perfectly. Upon even closer inspection, it wasn't just silver, but was tinted with green, as if the trees around it had touched it in some way.
"Just accept the damn compliment," Dean suggested, rolling his eyes.
And then there it was.
"I'm fine. I've been trying to find ways to get you out of the deal, but nothing's worked so far." Jack sighed. "The Empty still wants you, even though they got me already. I might ask Billie if she knows anything that would work." Jack was quiet, lost in thought.
have one-- put him in that parental position.
"We leave." Billie was still a fairly good distance away but she was skilled with her weapon, and one well-aimed swipe of the sharp blade nicked Cas's leg when she got close enough to the angel.
There was a teasing tone in his voice, but also warmth. If any one person could make jokes while being sincere at the same time, it was Dean Winchester. "Of course I miss you, Dean."
"You're awake," he heard Cas's voice say. He sounded like he had just come out of the bathroom across the hall and was standing in the doorway. Dean felt his heart beat faster with every step Cas took towards him.
"It's a brother thing, Cas. We screw with each other all the freaking time." The angel nodded. He'd seen enough of the Winchesters' behavior to know they messed with one another fairly regularly. "Be right back." Dean quickly kissed Cas and went on his way.
"No thank you. I don't need to eat, but I appreciate it nonetheless." Jack nodded and headed for the kitchen, excited to make his own food. Cas supposed that because Jack was only half-angel, he still had basic human needs.
For a few seconds Dean shut his eyes, and he only opened them when Cas said in a reverent whisper, "I love you."
How did humans go through things like this so often and come out of it alright? Ever since admitting the truth to Dean, Cas had been nothing but miserable. He'd seen movies on TV where a couple got into a fight and someone was always depressed afterwards. Up until recently, he'd seen that as dramatic acting.
Dean's eyes filled with tears and he hoped to God (well, Jack now) that he wouldn't cry like a baby. "Castiel, sparks literally freaking flew when we met, and I should have seen it as a sign that something started that night. You have no damn idea how much I regret not taking a chance on us sooner, because I love you and I hate myself for not figuring it out. But I wouldn't change a single damn thing, because anything else might have meant I may not have you now, and—hell, I don't want to think about being without you, angel."
"Is there a point to this, Dean? I'm fully aware of my original insignificance now." Cas raised an eyebrow, waiting.
Sam's awkward coughing snapped the newly happy couple out of their embrace. Dean rolled his eyes. "Go over to Sammy, angel, before he throws a fit."
"Never. I couldn't, Cas, not when you were damn near asking to die," he said. "You freaking passed out in the car, I thought I'd lost your ass already and I was too late."
"I never thought about it too much, but there's a certain kind of energy that comes with thoughts and wishes. Most people would have given up on me as soon as they saw I was dying."
"Don't bring up that crap right now. We could have found a way out, damn it! What were you gonna do, Cas? Leave and make me think I've been abandoned?!" Dean huffed. "I was honest with you. And you lied this entire time."
"I know. But we'll find a way out of this." Jack smiled encouragingly.
He couldn't look Dean in the eye. "When Jack was in Heaven, the Empty arrived. Jack is half-human, but he has angelic grace as well. There was a problem concerning where he should have been."
Dean didn't feel it at first. It was only after Jack asked if he'd heard something that the hunter realized there was, in fact, something headed their way. It gradually took shape the closer it got; it was oddly humanlike. Blackness molded together like pieces of clay.
"That's good," Dean said, nodding. "Awesome."
The angel was going through his plan and was so focused he didn't see Dean walk into the bedroom. "Missed you," Dean said after a quick kiss.
"You won't, because I'm not leaving you, angel."
"I saved Jack, but I'm paying the price, Dean." That was too vague. Cas wanted to get it all out at once before Dean snapped and inevitably got angry.
All Dean could do was glare at his brother. "Seriously?! I'm done telling you anything."
"You're very stubborn, Dean," Cas affectionately chastised him. "Jack, you go. We will join you shortly."
"Thank you, then, Dean." Cas let a smile flicker onto his lips, willing to go along with Dean.
Dean's vision got blurry. He refused to let any tears fall.
Dean met his brother's eyes in the mirror and nodded. Next to Sam, Eileen looked beautiful in a green dress the color of emeralds. She smiled reassuringly at Dean, mouthing "he's right" and making Dean laugh a bit.
"I helped out a lot," Jack said happily. He looked to Dean, and the hunter nodded.
"I trust you. Although I highly doubt you'll need to worry too much."
“You know, maybe this whole thing would be a bit more enjoyable for you if you actually got along with some of them. Maybe even made friends. I am sure she only tried to be nice. But of course that’s not something you’d consider. Just get off your high horse, it’s no one’s but your fault that you have to go there. At least try and make the best of it.”
“Really? Will I still get the same credits?” he asked but quickly added, “But I won’t do make up or anything like that.”
“Okay, well see you at David’s party then.”, Castiel said but was still looking at Dean. He must have noticed something was going on with Dean, which only signalled Dean to leave even stronger. He didn’t even bring up the energy to say bye, so Dean only nodded and then speedwalked his way towards where he thought he might be able to find Benny, almost running into a teacher, still being distracted by thoughts just swirling around in his head.
“Unless I’m what?”, Dean asked. Was he really gonna accuse him of being jealous? Jealous?! Dean Winchester didn’t get jealous. That was totally not what this was about or why he felt so upset.
anymore anyway.”
“For when I finish school?”, he said as if it was obvious, but the poor girl truly seemed to have no clue what he was talking about. Dean really hadn’t told his girlfriend? The tension was very awkward now. So Dean told Cas about it… but not his girlfriend. NO. Castiel finished the rest of his drink in one go and stood up. He can’t think like that. He WON’T, read anything into Dean’s action anymore, he was always wrong anyway.
“So, what do you think? Are you happy with this play?”, Charlie asked him as they were leaving the room.s
(See the end of the chapter for
. Dean had been so focussed on regaining control, he actually forgot about what made him lose it in the first place. “You okay?”, he asked carefully and Dean could see Cas softly reach out with his hand probably about to place it on Dean’s shoulder but Dean was quick to answer and stop the probably panic inducing touch.
“And it doesn’t clash with football practice, so you won’t have problems doing both.”, Benny went further, being at least one friend that was actually trying to help.
“Cas, this is Dean, he just joined the Drama Club. Dean, this is Castiel, the last one of our group. He’s a bit awkward but you’ll get used to it.”, she introduced the two.
“Coming with you of course. I don’t really know anyone here and you can finally introduce me to your drama club friends.”, she explained. Dean knew she was right to follow him, after all, he invited her to come here with him, but still he really hated the thought of Lisa meeting Cas. He was worried. Not that anything could happen in particular, but that maybe she would notice. She would figure it out.
He had almost said it. It had almost just casually slid out of him. Like it was the normalest thing for him to say to a friend he had only known a few months. He needed to stop. Just numb out these thoughts. And there was nothing more numbing than listening to the conversations football guys have during school breaks.
Dean tried to play it off as casually as possible, talking while refilling his cup with soda, and putting Lisa’s empty bottle away before reaching to pick up a new one.
“So, I told my Dad about my plans, and he actually thinks it’s a good idea.”, Dean tried starting a conversation, bringing up their latest conversation. Castiel didn’t really feel like answering. Last time they had been talking, Dean had seemed so happy, so ecstatic and Cas had felt so special that Dean had been so excited to tell him and for a few seconds dared to think that maybe it had meant something, but then once again, Dean proved him wrong by disappearing on him like he couldn’t get away fast enough.
“No, I actually…. “
“Why doesn’t his mum just make him lunch to take with him?”, Garth said.
“To getting over Dean Winchester.”, she joked as she clinked her glass to Cas’.
Oooof, I finally finished this, I had a lot going on so I am really sorry for needing so long to finish this chapter. I hope you still enjoy it and thanks to everyone who is still sticking around, there is so much more to come. <3
"I don't know what you expect me to say.", He then said, realizing it came out more disinterested than he planned to. Lisa looked at him with big eyes. Disbelief.
“I don’t know. I don’t feel like there is anything I actually wanna do?”, he explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean could see she was still visibly upset by whatever discussions happened at that dinner and he saw Garth try and soothe her by placing his hand on her back. Dean really admired the way those two were able to be there for each other and how you could see that they’re not just a couple but also best friends.
“Hey.”, Dean quietly said and Cas only now saw him, having been focussed on the biology book in his hand. He seemed a bit startled but he didn’t say anything, only gave Dean a small greeting smile but he could feel this invisible wall between them. Deciding to take the chance of no one else being with them at the moment, Dean decided to try and form an apology.
Dean was surprised by his brother’s directness. He knew he didn’t like his friends but he only ever made subtle hints.
As if the universe had timed it, they arrived at the spot they had agreed to meet Lisa's friend at. But she wasn't there yet.
Dean took a deep breath and approached the dark haired boy.
“Football Player and Drama Diva Dean Winchester. Sounds good, I’d say.”, Alastair joined in on the teasing.
It was that dark raven messy hair, that would always make his heart jump a little, that caught his eye. Castiel. Castiel standing very close and talking, even laughing, with that brown haired guy Dean was pretty sure he had seen in drama club before. He felt his stomach form a knot.
A chapter written only in Castiel's point of view.
“The girl I met at the comic store. Didn’t I tell you about her? We both wanted to buy the same book but there was only one left so I let her have it and in return she insisted on buying me coffee?”, she explained, seemingly not sure if she had already told him either.
"I seriously don't know what's up with you. I know something is up but everytime I ask you about it, you shut down. I honestly don't know what else to do.", Lisa confronted him with something he knew would probably come up at some point, but he really hadn't expected to have to talk about it now. Lisa obviously noticed that Dean was mentally absent most of the time and he had always come up with excuses but she reached a point where she obviously didn't believe him anymore. Only he really didn't want to talk it out right now before this party.
This chapter is timed about 3 or 4 weeks after the last, so I could move it closer to Christmas and give a little holiday vibe for this week.
. A year ago, Dean wouldn’t have even noticed if he walked past Garth, or any of the theatre kids for that matter, in the hallway. And if he did, he and his friends would have probably made fun of them.
After playing for a good hour or something, they made a small break and Garth went upstairs to get something to drink. While he was gone, Dean noticed a bunch of college brochures on the table. Immediately, he gets that wave of Anxiety about what he is going to do, once he finishes school. He had sent out a few applications, but he didn’t really care if he got accepted. Didn’t feel like any of it was what he actually wanted to do.
“Okay.”, Charlie then just said, and they went on to fill up their cups, deciding to not let anything stop them from having a good time tonight. And they would. Cas was adamant.
It wasn’t really, but coming late to football practice wasn’t an option, so he always bought a bag of crisps at the vending machine before drama club and then ate it on the way to the football field.
The following week, having reflected on what Sam had said, Dean decided to follow his brother’s advice. He doesn’t need to make friends, but he should at least apologize. Having people not like him there was probably not helpful either.
“I don’t have a problem.”, Dean lied, still with the same note of attitude. Castiel already had had a good amount of alcohol, that was obvious, but still he didn’t break eye contact.
“Are you okay?”, he asked, suddenly forgetting about his urge to tell Cas the good news. “I mean, physically, your voice sounds a bit strained.
Once they arrived at the party, Dean and the girls decided to go and find David so they could give him their present. It was nothing big, just a gift card for this sports shop, that Dean truly wasn't sure was the right gift, but he knew better than to complain after he left the gift buying to the girls. While they were making their way past a good amount of people, Dean couldn't help but wonder if Cas and the others had arrived already as well. It was about 20 minutes after the initial invite time but he couldn't seem to find them.
“And his stupid, stupid green eyes.”, he mumbled as he took a big sip of the beverage. A little too big as he noticed how strong the mixture was, but maybe that was exactly what he needed.
“Yeah, maybe.”, Dean then answered with a soft smile, letting the thought really go through his head. He also wondered why Garth was being so supportive, helping him when he really didn’t. But he guessed that’s what friends were supposed to do. And he really found a great group of friends here, all because he needed credits for drama club.
“Hey, Charlie?”, he said, hoping he got her name right, after only having had that one encounter with her.
“No, don’t even think like that.”, Cas discouraged Dean’s fears. “This is great and you seem really excited so isn’t that the main thing?”
“Only one is missing now.”, Charlie said and looked around until something seemed to have caught her eyes.
Dean felt like punching Garth simply for making that joke. Of course he wouldn’t. He knew Garth had nothing to do with this. But this was anything but a joke for Dean. Not that Garth knew that of course. Simply the thought of Cas with anyone was enough to make Dean feel bad. And now he had it right before his eyes. Before he even got the chance to completely figure out how he feels himself. Marcus laid his hand on Castiel’s shoulder as they were laughing about something and Dean decided he had enough.
Actually, Cas didn’t even have to find a way to block the conversation, Lisa was the one who stopped what she and Charlie were talking about to turn to Dean.
“You’re joking, right?”
I'm sorry if this feels a bit packed or rushed, I kinda messed up the timeline in my notes and noticed too late so I had to push a lot of stuff into one day. Hope you still enjoyed it :D
“Oh, so you haven’t talked to him yet?”, Castiel asked curiously and Dean really struggled to have this conversation right now. Or any kind of conversation to be honest.
The thought of having to paint people’s faces makes him shiver. Not just because he thinks he’d be bad at it, but because he’d have to be so close to so many different people.
“You wouldn’t get it, Sammy. It’s guy stuff, you’re only friends with girls anyway.”
. He expected to get some unserious answers, but somehow Benny’s suggestion seemed genuine.
“Ha, no.”, Dean laughed, “I don’t even know a single chord.”, he explained. “Besides, it doesn’t really feel like
“I just want to apologize for being a bit harsh last week. I’m not too happy about being here, but I shouldn’t have let it out on you. You just tried to be nice and I really appreciate that.”, he apologized and tried to give her a small smile.
“Hey there, new guy. I’m Charlie.”, she excitedly stretched out her hand for him to shake it but  Dean couldn’t be bothered.
“Wow, where are you finding all these cute girls? I wish I’d find a cute guy as easily…”, he tried not to sound too jealous, but he kind of was. It always seemed so easy for Charlie to meet people and everyone always liked her. And now she even has two girls who want her.
Dean tried to hide his shaking hands in his pockets, he couldn’t let Cas see this. Luckily the wall between them seemed to fade and Castiel sighed, as a sign of accepting his apology.
"Okay then, what was the fight about?" Lisa apparently wasn't in the mood for Dean's excuses today.
“YES! Of course!”, Dean remembered the initial reason to catch after Castiel and he shifted back into excitement.
Charlie was telling Cas about her girl trouble.
“I’m gonna go find Lisa.”, he said and got up, turning the other direction, trying to get away from the scene in front of him.
Cas looked at him, expecting an answer and only now Dean
(See the end of the chapter for
Outside the theater, Castiel, Garth and Bess joined them.
“No, I know… I know.”, he reassured Cas. Ironically, his friend who is gay would probably be exactly the right person to talk to about possbly liking boys. It just so happened that ‘boys’ in this case, included said friend.
Dean should have let it rest at that, but he couldn’t. Still, he ignored the connotation in the way Castiel pronounced that last word.
“.. got a lot going on. And I should have told you when my plans changed.”
“Well it beats Chess Club, I guess.”, Dean shrugged.
But as soon as she arrived he approached her.
“Dean, wait!”, she exclaimed and Dean felt obligated to at least look at her for a second.
“He’s a family friend. A car mechanic, he owns a repair shop. I sometimes help him out when I’m there and I actually never mind. It’s very interesting, most of the time even fun.”, he explained and thought back to the multiple weekends he spent there, helping Bobby in the shop, while Sam was sitting somewhere reading a book.
Castiel stormed off, leaving Dean standing behind, shaken by their conversation that had so abruptly ended. It felt like they had just given each other attitude and neither of them really knew what it was about. Cas had obviously been drunk already, stumbling a bit over his words, blinking more often than usual and being way less patient than he usually was. Still, it started to sink in that they just had a fight that Dean really couldn’t explain. And worse, Dean was starting to realize that it was probably mostly his fault. He had no claim on Cas or who he was talking to. No right to be upset or… jealous. But he was. Jealous. And now Cas was off. Typical Dean Winchester, make a situation even worse than it already was. Still, he didn’t see the point in trying to find Cas again and resolve it now, nor would he know what to say, so he decided to go back to Lisa, deliver the drinks and try to ban any Cas-related thoughts from his mind for the rest of the evening.
"You've lost me," Dean said, but he knew he was smiling. "How'd my thoughts do anything, huh?"
"You're not denying it, so I know I'm right." Cas allowed Dean the space he wanted but didn't let him get too far. "What's going on, Dean? I only want to help you if I can."
"I'm glad you're back," Cas said, eyes on Dean. He looked at both Sam and Jack. "All of you."
The thing headed right for him, not Jack. Dean braced himself for the Empty's wrath, maybe in a body that Dean desperatey longed to touch just one more time, and he feared he'd gotten exactly that when a handsome face and tousled hair came into focus. "What the hell," he breathed.
Love. The word wouldn't get out of his head. Dean tried reasoning with himself. There were different kinds of love, right? Sammy had made him think it was romantic love. What if he'd meant brotherly love?
And then he tried again. And again. After the fourth time something changed. There was an undefinable thing pulsing steadily in the distance; it was like the Empty's version of a beacon of light. It illuminated nothing, but stood out enough regardless.
At most, Sammy was there for five minutes.
It was cold, dark, and... well,
"Tell him, Castiel. He can't do anything." Chuck looked down at Cas. Dean held him closer, shielding him with his body. An asshole like Chuck had no right to even look in the direction of Dean's dying angel.
"I never even got the chance to tell you that," Dean said shakily, "I love you too, Cas, you're my goddamn world and nothing's been right since you pulled that 'I love you' and 'Goodbye' crap." A tear broke free from Dean's eye and rolled down his cheek.
"I know. I'm sorry." Cas's words were tinged with regret and pain, the kind of pain where you've been irreperably damaged inside and torture was merciful compared to it. "I don't regret it, Dean."
"I'll take anything as long as it's not your health-food vegan-crap kind of food." He shuddered. "How the hell do you even eat that stuff?"
Sam sighed. "You love him, Dean. I've been watching you two for years. I know you don't want to believe me, but you're not exactly doing a good job of hiding it, you know?" He held up a hand, cutting Dean off before he could respond. "I'm just being honest here. You can keep denying it if you want to, Dean, but that won't get you anywhere."
"You mean everything to me. I wasn't ready to give you up, Dean. I know you, and I know you would have yelled at me for making that decision. I couldn't let Jack go. He's my responsibility now. I made a promise to Kelly-"
Cas's shoes left footprints in the snow and the muddy ground underneath. It was such a simple thing, really, to look behind you and see your own markings in the earth. Humans did it all the time with no idea of how amazing it truly was.
Dean grinned confidently. "You know how to dance, angel?" he asked almost teasingly.
"Hell yeah. I've got a great plan," Dean promised Jack with a bold wink that lit up the kid's face. And then Dean cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, "CASTIEL?"
"Are you alright?" Cas asked, frowning. "You look bothered by something, Dean."
"Okay, first lesson as a human," Dean said, holding up one finger, "shut the hell up about what you think you deserve."
"You're okay, Cas, just don't do that so much," Dean said, and Cas seriously nodded as if Dean's words were the most important words in the world. "Now get your ass over here and look at this."
It had been a few more days and Cas's guilt was killing him. He paced in front of Dean's mirror (they now shared the room) and practiced for when he told Dean the truth.
Jack frowned. "They need to know. You can't just leave them one day and not give them any answers. Have you thought about how much it would hurt them?"
"The Shawshank Redemption. At the very end, there was something said about hope." Cas tightened his grip on Dean. "'Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.' Do you remember?"
The sound of slow clapping shattered the moment. "So cute! It sure took you guys long enough."
It wasn't that Dean needed a couple of hours to listen to a record. He didn't even need one hour. But he was still relieved that he wouldn't need to listen to Sam's teasing about a) the song, and b) his eagerness at having a record player, for that much longer.
Dean started to read the letter and had to stop himself from crushing it further and/or crying onto it the more he read.
For a second, the angel looked like he was having some kind of debate with himself. Then he fully faced Dean again. "Sam's returning now. I should give you time to calm down."
He didn't pay attention to the spell at all, but Jack had him covered. The kid offered to fill him in later on in case Dean wanted to do it again (if it didn't blow up in their faces).
"Yeah," Dean said after a second, "I'm fine, Cas."
"I know," Cas said. Dean wiped the tears from Cas's face with the back of his hand. They mixed with the blood on Dean's skin.
"It's emotions and crap. We all get them," Dean said through a mouthful of burger. "Blame Cas for it this time," he said quietly, but Sam still heard him.
So he didn't leave Cas. He came right back after taking a pillow and blanket from his room and set the things on the floor. "I'm not leaving you, angel."
"Not like I have anything else to do," Dean said, shrugging off his jacket. Jack watched him and followed his lead. "What's up, Cas?"
"I would hardly say that. I'm sure there are other people far more inspirational than me, and they aren't looking to kill bugs," Cas calmly objected, pointedly looking at Dean.
Cas abruptly stopped the dancing to wrap his arms around the hunter, sighing contentedly. He looked happier than Dean had ever seen him. "Thank you," he eventually said.
Dean nodded wordlessly, pulling his hand back. He kept a firm but gentle grip on the angel's shoulder. "The things that... the things that we've shared together, they have changed me. You're my family."
One more text, and then Dean would give up. Or call him again. Whichever worked.
Dean didn't even think before he pressed their lips together. Cas didn't pull away, in fact he kissed Dean back urgently.
"I think I will. I'm getting hungry already." Dean nodded and picked up the menu from a burger joint that delivered. He gestured that Cas should look it over (he already knew what he wanted; he'd eaten there a few times already) and got ready to dial the number on his phone, which was now in his hand again.
Cas tore his eyes away from Dean, and Dean missed their attention solely being focused on him. "You're right. Something's coming."
Dean's breath caught. "Say it again?" he asked.
"You don't get to tell me what to do, Jack. I will tell Sam and Dean when I'm ready. Until then, please just give me time." Jack huffed. When he got up and left the library, Cas didn't try to stop him.
"Thank you." He sat back on the bed. "Jack, I'm going to tell Dean about the deal. I should have said something sooner. You were right." Jack smiled, but it wasn't his usual, happy smile. "Is everything alright?"
"Do you have a plan?" Jack asked, perking up a bit.
"Sammy saw it. His weird connection to Chuck showed him all the rough drafts, remember? Every other Sam and Dean he created. You weren't in a single one."
Cas was just a good friend, wasn't he? Not just a good friend, but Dean's best friend. He knew everything about Dean, probably including things about his body after rebuilding it from Hell. The thought should have been unnerving, but Dean now wondered: how much did he know that the hunter wasn't aware of?
The next visitor to the room where Dean was getting ready and convincing himself this was actually happening poked their head out from behind the door. "Castiel's waiting," Rowena said with a pointed look st Dean. "Let's go, boys."
"You had every right to do it. I deserved it anyway, for lying to you. But I wasn't lying when I said I wanted you, Dean. That was the whole truth. It's been only you for as long as I've known you." Cas tentatively smiled. "I certainly deserve worse."
The doors opened easily when he pushed them.
"You won't be alone for long, angel," Dean said cockily. Cas imagined him winking, even though he couldn't see it. "I'll see you soon, yeah?"
He walked the now-familiar path again. Except for Sam that first time, nobody else besides Dean himself had walked that way. Not even Jack, who understood without being told that it wasn't a good idea to intrude on Dean no matter how much he had loved Cas and wanted to pay his respects.
Dean shrugged. "Yeah, okay. You alright though? You look like something's bothering you, Cas." The hunter suddenly pointed a finger at Cas. "I'll get you a beer and you're telling me whatever the hell's going on, got it?"
Cas went without protest.
Dean nodded. "Yeah, I'm so damn excited I can't sit still or even think," he confessed.
The first day he'd stopped by had been the hardest. He had been hurt somewhere deep inside and the abrupt loss of Cas had been a raw, bleeding wound that stung at the tiniest reminder of the blue-eyed angel. He'd almost turned back to drown his sorrows in beer at the bunker. In the end, though, he'd mustered up the strength to make it the whole way and ended up staying all day and most of the night. He would have spent the night in the grass if Sam hadn't come looking for him and forced him to come back to the bunker.
"You left so suddenly after telling me all that crap about myself," Dean said, giving maybe-Cas the benefit of the doubt. Maybe-Cas's face fell and it made Dean feel a million times worse. In that moment, Dean knew with crystal clear surety that this was Cas,
Dean instantly hated it. Cas deserved better, and damn if Dean wouldn't give that to him or die trying. "Well, what the hell happens now, kid?" Dean asked. "We made it, now what?"
"I don't not want it. I don't know what to say, damn it," Dean admitted, laughing a bit.
He caught Cas's gaze with his own and held the eye contact between them as he clicked on the internet browser icon. His face reddened slightly when the porn website he'd been checking out earlier showed up. Had Dean really forgotten to close the tab?
The next morning, the bed was empty. The sheets were pulled back, indicating Cas had gotten out of the bed. His trench coat and dark blue suit jacket were tossed to the side. "Cas?" Dean asked, hoping the angel was nearby.
"I like that idea, Dean. I would love to." Cas pressed a quick kiss to Dean's cheek. "Your room, I'm guessing?"
"You didn't get mad at me for listening to your thoughts," Cas pointed out.
It was the damn puppy eyes again. Dean started talking without even realizing it. "I'm feeling weird, okay? And I don't even know how to describe it either, but it's all because of you. Ever since," Dean went on, gesturing wildly, "since Purgatory, when you were damn near left behind, things have been a damn mess."
"It was the only way to end the deal. I can't return to the Empty when I'm no longer an angel, Dean." Cas looked down at his hands. "I didn't tell you because I was afraid to see how you would respond."
Making sure Sammy was out, and then checking again so he didn't get caught 'nerding out' over a record player, Dean relaxed a bit. He took a seat at the table, grabbing a beer so he could drink while listening.
"Just for tonight? This." And then Dean gently kissed him, and it was absolutely perfect. Cas didn't mind letting Dean control the kiss, melting into it and leaning more on Dean instead. "Will you stay with me while I sleep or have you decided to stop that crap?"
Dean was quiet. "I wasn't concerned because at the time, it was highly unlikely to occur anytime soon. Now things are different. I have you. And that's putting me at higher risk."
Cas smiled and lifted the ring from Dean's hand. It felt like there was nobody else in the bunker. No Sam, no Jack, just the two of them in their own little moment.
Dean let go of Cas's hand and wrapped his arm around him, crushing their bodies together. "Good," he said into Cas's shoulder. "I love you too, Cas, so damn much."
And then Dean returned the kiss with earnest, communucating everything he couldn't say with the action. He didn't care that he and Cas were making out in the Empty instead of Dean's bedroom (his preferred place to make out with Cas, because within seconds he'd have been ripping off the angel's clothes).
He should have come clean, but lied instead. "The very same thing. I've wanted you for a long time, Dean." It was still the truth.
"Rabbit food's what that is," Dean muttered to himself under his breath. "I will never understand that kid."
"Of course." Cas must have sensed Dean's hesitation as he reached for his white shirt stained with dried blood, because he guided Dean's hand with his own. "It's alright, Dean, I promise."
Where would that hopelessness lead Dean? Would he become a merciless hunter, coping by killing every monster in sight? What if he turned to alcohol to make himself forget?
To avoid that happening, Dean didn't dare to breathe in too deeply.
"I know," Jack said, going from serious to cheerful in a matter of seconds. "You're very happy with Dean," he said, changing the subject.
"You're the most beautiful person I've ever known," Cas panted into Dean's ear when they had to pull apart or risk passing out from a lack of oxygen. "Everything about you is perfect to me. Thank you for wanting me back. How did you get here? Dean, are you alright?"
"It is. Sam's making pancakes." Jack beamed up at Cas. "He let me help make them."
"Okay, let's see what we can find, huh?" Dean asked, tilting the screen so he and Cas could both see it.
But he hadn't. And now Dean was racing through his memories, racking his brain for an answer.
. He's the best damn thing that's ever happened to me, damn it!" Dean looked down at Cas. He was still hanging in there, but he looked so weak, it broke Dean's heart. The angel squeezed Dean's hand, a gesture that was meant to be comforting; to some degree it was. But it was also a painful reminder of the fact that he was dying, yet was only worried for Dean. He was just that kind of guy.
"Let's go back. I assume breakfast is almost done cooking now."
A knock at the door startled Cas. "Oh, hello, Jack," he said, waving Jack over when he saw him in the doorway.
"Nice," Dean said encouragingly, grinning. "You think you'd be interested in that?"
And that's exactly what Cas did.
"I've never done this before," Jack admitted. "What if I don't do it right? I could kill you."
At first Dean had been worried that the tie would blow away or the piece of glass would just disappear one day like Cas had, but neither one of the two things went missing; Dean knew this because he visited the grave every day.
Green. The one word made Cas think about Dean. The hunter's eyes were that color, and it was a beautiful shade of green. He'd noticed his own eyes of course, and he knew they were one of his vessel's best features, but Dean's eyes were his favorite. How could they not be, after all?
Cas nodded, but he found himself leaning on Dean for support as they walked. "You'll only be preventing the inevitable. I hope you realize that," he said, even though the thought of going back to the bunker was extremely comforting.
"I'm coming in through your door." Dean could already hear Cas's footsteps as they got closer. He hung up the phone when the footsteps stopped in front of his room. Even before the first knock, he'd opened the door. "Hello, Dean."
"Intentions don't mean shit if it happens anyway." The hunter crossed his arms, not even looking at the angel now. "It's done, Cas. I'm done. Get the hell out of my room."
"What is it anyway?" Dean pressesd on, gesturing in the general direction Cas had looked in.
He followed it.
Cas nodded. "It's me. I was waiting for you." His arms tightened around the hunter, reassuring him just as much as he needed reassurance himself.
"Hey, Cas," he said, sighing. "I missed you today too, you son of a bitch. I still love your ass, you know? I should have said something sooner, because," he continued, chucking humorlessly, "I hate that you never knew. Sammy said it was obvious, so maybe you did and you were waiting for me to make the first move. I wish I had, Cas, hell, I should have told you years ago, but I never did."
"What the hell did I even do?" Dean asked, trying not to get his hopes up and failing.
"You'd better, because I'm gonna make up for the time I didn't know any of this, and if you aren't ready, too bad." He added a wink at the end and Cas got adorably flustered.
And it would never be enough. Dean would never get enough of this, now that he knew he could have it. Why did it have to happen now? Why had he and Cas been so afraid when it had been so obvious the whole time? Dean loved Cas, and he knew that the angel,
After it happened, Sam and Jack returned to the bunker and found Dean on the floor in the exact same position he'd been in when Cas left. His phone was lit up with unread texts and missed calls from Sam, but not a single one of either of the two had been acknowledged. Sam told Dean later that night that he'd been worried and angry with him, but that Dean didn't deserve to be scolded or yelled at after all he'd witnessed and been told. Sam was what Dean tried to focus on now, not the long-gone angel with blue eyes who loved him.
"Bingo." Dean grinned. "I freaking love you, and I've finally pulled my head out of my ass and realized it."
Pulling to a stop outside the barn, Dean felt a rush of memories and nostalgia. He calmed himself as best he could and prepared himself for the worst.
"Can I talk to you, Dean?" Cas asked when Dean looked over at him. "Just for a minute."
Dean looked himself over in the mirror and smiled, a little nervous but more than eager to get the wedding started. The suit he had on was a lot like the suits he wore when he posed as a federal agent, but it was dressier-looking and fit him much better. The tie around his neck was a familiar shade of dark blue, matching Cas's eyes just like he knew Cas's tie would be green like the hunter's eyes were.
"I meant to myself without you, damn it." Of course Dean hadn't forgotten Cas. "Cas is different. He's not my little brother."
He stayed in Sam's room a second longer, taking in the sight of a bedroom that wasn't littered with empty (and possibly broken) bottles. Then Dean thought about what Sam had told him about Eileen. He had to laugh at his own expense. Cas had called him selfless and said he was so many great things, but the hunter hadn't even considered how Sam felt about losing Eileen. He'd been too wrapped up in his own orbit of pain and loss to think about anyone else-- not even his own brother.
"I remember how Dean was after you died, around the time I was born," Jack said. "He couldn't even look at me. I reminded him of you too much."
So now, he was sitting in the library again while Jack made sure he had everything: an angel blade, a vial to contain the grace, and a first-aid kit to clean up any wounds even though Jack could heal him easily. "It's going to be fine," Cas assured Jack.
"Not quite. The Empty and I made a deal, Dean. I would willingly return under one condition." Cas paused. "When I was truly, completely happy. I would be taken away at the best time of my life."
"I do, but why the hell're you bringing it up, huh?" Dean stroked Cas's back through the many layers of his clothing.
Cas nodded and tapped out the beat with his foot. "You want to dance or something?" Dean asked jokingly.
But in this moment, frozen in place and unable to move, Dean knew with 1000% certainty that God would die, and he'd be the one to land the killing blow.
Because he would have to leave. And he couldn't let himself get used to this. If Dean was the reason he went to the Empty, all because he was treating Cas with so much affection, it would break him.
Dean was the one to break the silence. "I'm taking you home, yeah? We'll do every freaking thing possible to save you."
Of course, Dean would say he was being a nerd or a dork for thinking that. He preferred the bunker's garage more than a room full of books. "Couple hours, I think. You miss me that much?"
"Sam said I did. I'm excited to eat them." Cas could tell Jack was eager to get back to the kitchen, but he walked with Cas, matching his pace.
"That's nice, Dean," Cas said, smiling through the pain of being slowly stabbed to death by his own father. "I'm sorry."
"What else, Sam? Of course I mean the damn spell." Dean crossed his arms. "Get it done before I change my mind."
"You done staring?" Dean asked, raising one eyebrow. Cas now looked like a deer caught in headlights. He muttered a quick apology to the hunter.
In his head, he answered Sam.
The angel blade was gentle as it cut the skin. Jack relaxed once grace was steadily flowing into the vial. "It's working," he said, grinning.
The kiss only lasted a few seconds but it left both of them breathing heavily. "I enjoyed that," Cas whispered as if speaking any louder would break the moment.
"Yeah, but Jack's back, right? There's nothing to worry about there." Cas nodded. He had wanted to give Dean no time to ask questions until he was finished, but that plan was out the window now.
A second voice joined the first one and Cas felt his heart sink at what it implied.
"I see now, Cas." Jack smiled. "Thank you."
"You shouldn't be thankful for everything he did," Cas countered.
All of a sudden, Cas knew what to do with the ring. No matter how nice it looked on his own hand, it would no doubt look better on Dean's. Not wanting to risk anything happening to it in his pocket, he kept it on for the moment.
Dean narrowed his eyes and subtly shifted so that his body was angled toward Cas's. He let his hand hover millimeters above Cas's arm, so close to actually touching him and pulling him close.
He was just taking off his trench coat when he heard Dean calling to him, "Got it!" He paused in the doorway. "You're, uh-"
"I always see parents yelling at their kids on TV. You didn't yell at me," Jack said.
And what about Sam? He'd probably try to bring Cas back, going through every book in the bunker. When he finally accepted that nothing could be done, he would get through it, but how long would it take?
The bunker was quiet without Sam and Dean around, and even Jack left his own kind of silence. Cas started to wonder if he should just call Dean and ask how everything was going.
"I can hear you," Cas muttered lowly and hopefully. The desire, the
"That's hardly appropriate anymore," Cas said. "I'm no longer an angel." He looked down at their clasped hands.
Cas shrugged. "I was awake again. I was alive when the Empty took me." He risked a glance at Dean as he said it.
"I don't know," Jack admitted quietly. He was ashamed of it, Dean could tell. He wrapped his arm around Jack's shoulders in what he hoped was a comforting gesture.
Dean didn't look away from Cas, even when Chuck left. He took a shaky breath. "I'm going to kill his ass," he promised Cas. "I hate him so freaking much, angel."
"It hurt every freaking time," Dean said in a low voice. "I had to, though, because if I didn't make you feel like crap, you'd be gone for good, Cas. I hated saying all those things. I hated myself for it."
"Okay. Let's dance, Cas," Dean said as he stood up. "Why not, right?"
Dean knew it was close to impossible. He couldn't just kill God, Amara would have to die too to keep the balance. And Dean highly doubted Amara would let herself be killed out of revenge.
Sam nodded and nearly tripped over his own feet getting out of there. Dean looked at Cas and laughed. It was music to Cas's ears. "Let's finish where we left off," the hunter suggested.
Dean looked down at Cas and couldn't help but smile softly. The angel was letting himself be moved in small circles, his eyes half closed with his lips slightly quirked up at one side.
"Well, shit, we really did it," Dean said, looking as if he'd just witnessed a miracle.
Dean caved less than a day later. He was unable to get Sam's words out of his head.
That was all he needed to tell himself.
Cas didn't look at his father. Instead, his blue eyes pleaded with Dean, already resigned to the fact that he was going to die soon. "He's right. I'm so sorry." He sounded a little better without the angel blade inside of him, but it didn't make a big difference, really. Cas shut his eyes and when he opened them a second later, they were welling up.
"Cas isn't just a character,
"It is, yes," the angel said idly. "It works, I would assume?"
"You don't want to follow my Father's story, Dean. You want to make your own future." Cas squinted, confused.
At first Dean wanted to play it in his room, but decided that the library would be a good place to put the player. Setting it on a table in the library, it looked like it was meant to be put there; it didn't look out of place at all.
"I may have found a way out of the deal. You stood a chance of going to Heaven because your mother was a human. My grace is what makes me an angel," he explained. "I have lost my grace and become human in the past, however."
Cas looked up and into the green eyes that he loved so much. There was nothing but understanding and worlds of emotion in them. "Can I put it on you?"
"I'm always going to be ready. Anything you want to do, Dean." Cas no doubt assumed something dirty, based on his gaze going back and forth between Dean and the bed right behind them.
Dean, for once, wasn't thinking about that and instead said, "We'll save that for later," while smirking. "You aren't an angel at all, are you? You're mind's already in the gutter."
It was the perfect opportunity for Dean to look Cas up and down, taking in every detail in a way that made it blatantly obvious what he was doing. He met Cas's eyes and, not worrying about Sam hearing, said into the angel's ear, "You." He pulled back with a satisfied smirk on his lips.
"This isn't something Dean and Sam can't help with. I know about your deal with the Empty. I know you did it to save me, and I'm happy you did, but what about you? When will it happen?" Jack asked, leaning forward. He looked concerned for Cas.
"I'll be back momentarily," Cas promised Dean as he got up. As soon as Dean's hands were no longer touching him, Cas shuddered and glanced back at his hunter wistfully. Dean stood up and brushed their fingers together, gently pushing Cas towards Sam with a kiss on the cheek. "I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."
Dean attempted a laugh. "Which one?" he asked. Cas accepted it as a kind of joke and smiled a beautiful, breathtaking smile that forced Dean to remember how to breathe.
"He's trying to save you, in a way," Jack said, trying to help. "It sounds wrong, but by treating you like this, he's keeping you from your end of the deal."
"I missed you too," Cas said, managing a smile. "I need to tell you something."
"I have you to thank for me being here still," Cas said, smiling gratefully. "I also owe you an apology. I had doubts about your capability to save me, and I couldn't possibly clear my head of them. I was entirely convinced my fate was set in stone."
"I enjoy being with you as well," Cas admitted. "Without you, the bunker is incredibly quiet."
Cas opened and closed his mouth without speaking. He tentatively reached out and placed his hand in the hunter's.
When Cas went limp in his arms, Dean wanted to scream. Of course he died during a kiss, of course Dean had to feel the moment he died. His fists clenched at his sides after he gently laid Cas down. Looking down at him through his tears, Dean noticed that in death, he looked almost peaceful. He could have been sleeping if it weren't for the blood pooling around him and the black wings on either side of his body.
Dean inhaled sharply. He barely resisted the urge to stroke the angel's hair and hold him close. "I do too, hell, I freaking love it," he said in a hushed voice.
It had been Cas's idea, and the angel was a little hesitant to suggest it to Dean, so when Dean agreed, Cas visibly relaxed and smiled a wide, gummy smile that Dean would do anything to see.
The door opened at one end of a short hallway, and the wide open door on the other end beckoned to Dean with the bright sunlight streaming through it and the promise of Cas faithfully waiting for him. Every step he took felt light, like he could sprout wings and fly like... well, like his angel. His fiance. His future husband.
"No, Dean, I'm not." Cas nodded. "You didn't leave me, did you?" the angel asked, joining him on the floor.
"Is that the reason you had those feelings toward me, Dean?" Cas asked, tilting his head. He looked down, a brighter smile flickering on his lips. Only for a second though, because then he forced his face to stay neutral.
"I'm lucky enough to have you. I never thought you'd return my feelings." Cas shrugged as best as he could. "I'm only this way with you, Dean."
Dean sent a silent thank you to whatever higher power had caused Sam to text him and tell him that he had decided to visit Eileen, because she was close to the bunker on a hunt and wanted to see him. The food Sam had gone out to get would be dropped off at the bunker and then it would be just Dean again.
"That was the farthest thing from my intentions." Dean only glared at Cas, not happy with the answer.
"Yes. It was all centered around me, and your desire to change it made it stronger." Cas smiled at Dean, looking so happy with the hunter. "I wasn't sure it could be done, yet you did it. You saved my life with your thoughts alone."
"Yeah, well, the feeling's mutual." Dean said this almost as if he were in a rush. Then he laughed for a second. "I'm being honest here, Cas, it would have been nice to have you here."
"I am. I know he will, Cas. You did it to save me, but Dean won't see it that way. He's going to assume I made you do it." He looked up at Cas, hoping for the angel to say he was wrong, but Cas had nothing to say. Jack was right.
Dean's room was just as Cas had remembered it. It was somewhere between neat and messy, with everything having its own kind of organization that only Dean knew. Unsure of where else to go, Cas perched on the edge of the hunter's bed.
"I'll live," Cas assured Dean. "It's only a minor cut, most likely." Dean nodded, still eyeing the cut with suspicion. Cas abruptly wrapped his arms around Dean's neck and his hot breath blew onto Dean's skin as he said, "Thank you for saving me. I truly love you."
. He could tell Cas had heard his thoughts when he smiled sadly, not wanting to hurt Dean's feelings by telling him the reality of the situation.
The hunter saw worlds of emotion in Cas's eyes when he looked into them. "You said to tell you I loved you when I wasn't facing death. Here I am, and I love you."
"I am. I'm yours completely."
"It's you, right?" Dean asked hopefully. "Cas?"
The way Cas held Dean's hand was soft but firm, as if he'd transferred his uneasiness and uncertainty into the action. He slid the ring gently onto Dean's finger.
"Hey," Dean said, and the angel could hear the smile in his voice. "We're close to the bunker. The case was actually easy for once."
Jack beamed at the couple and cleared his throat, drawing all the attention to him and them. As the new God, he'd been chosen to oversee the ceremony. It seemed that despite his infinite knowledge of the world and the universe, he was still a bit clueless on what to wear, so he'd used Google (yes, Jack had added the internet to Heaven) to look it up. He looked a bit overdressed for his role, but it looked right on him. Plus, he was really eager to show off his clothing and everyone either didn't want to let him down and take away the kid's enthusiasm or didn't want to risk making the new God an enemy.
"It's healthy, Dean. And I like it." Sam chuckled and left, shaking his head.
"Want anything specific?" Sam asked.
"Don't you have one of your own? Why do you need Sam's?" Cas wasn't sure how to respond when Dean softly laughed, turning to face him completely.
"I've wanted to hear that for so long." Dean felt the angel smiling against his ear. "Thank you very much."
"Believe it or not, Dean, I do love Castiel's character. He's been through so much, and the character development! It was amazing, really." Chuck smiled as if nothing was wrong. "Don't you agree?"
"I forgive you, damn it! For everything you did. But I'll never forgive you if you die like this. I... I need you, you feathered dumbass." Dean's voice broke and he knew he was going to cry. "I need you so damn much, you have no idea, but I do." He rested a hand on the side of Cas's face. "You're my-"
"I told Sam about all the crap you said and what I told you," Dean said as a starting point. "He laughed and said I loved you, and-"
"And here I thought you didn't know how to flirt or anything like that," Dean joked, taking Cas's hand in his. "You sure you aren't just lucky?"
"Are you alright, Dean?" Sam asked his brother. Dean was currently drinking in the bunker's kitchen. "Is anything wrong, or-"
It was Sam who found the spell. He had been digging through books one minute and the next minute he'd been running to find Dean, who was currently busy drinking and trying to find some respite from the constant loop of Cas's confession that played in his head.
The first thing he noticed was that the angel was breathing, but just barely. He wasn't dead. He could still get better. "He's alive," Dean muttered. "Don't scare me like that, damn it," he said to Cas's body.
He and Jack took their first steps into the Empty.
"I'm happy for you guys." Cas smiled gratefully at Sam.
Just like Sam had said, Cas showed up right after the bunker door shut behind Sam. "Where did Sam go?" Cas asked Dean, who once again jumped, startled. Cas was always so damn sneaky without realizing it.
"When I'm truly happy. At the time, I knew it wouldn't happen for a while. Even now, I have plenty of things to keep me from that happiness." Cas sighed. "Dean and Sam have no idea, Jack. Thank you for coming to me about this."
Dean laid back on his bed. He wished he could just talk to Cas, but he was staying away until the hunter wasn't going to snap at him for just walking up to him. "It's not like the guy lives in my ass," Dean had said once. Now he almost wished he did, it would make things a hell of a lot easier.
"Whatever you want. We don't exactly act like friends, so what the hell, right?"
Every one of Dean's thoughts said the same thing.
"It doesn't hurt?" Dean asked, glancing up at Cas's face. Cas shook his head. That was enough to give the hunter the go-ahead to gently touch his bare skin.
And at the end of it all was Cas. His blue eyes were locked onto Dean's the moment he came into view, and the way he was looking at the hunter was so openly affectionate and felt like a whisper of contact between them despite the distance. Claire was trying and failing to hide her smile, rolling her eyes at the angel in her father's body at her side, since Cas chose her to stand next to him and not sit in a chair.
"Why don't you show me?" Cas asked hopefully, and Dean pulled him into a passionate kiss.
"There has to be a way," Dean protested. He shook his head. "I'm thinking so freaking hard, because I'm not giving up on you." He slowly walked back to Cas. "You still feel like crap?"
"Save him." To anyone else, the threat would have been enough. But for Chuck, who had greater power than anything the Winchesters had ever hunted and killed, it just bounced off of him. He sighed, shaking his head like a parent telling their child no.
Cas had braced himself for Dean's anger. He knew that Dean would call him an idiot for having done what he did. He'd decided to just say it all at once, not giving Dean time to respond. If he had to, he would use his grace to keep the hunter in place before he made any rash decisions or lashed out.
He had gone so long without Cas. Dean had been fully convinced their not-quite-a-love story had ended, but it was still being written (as much as he hated thinking of it as Chuck's writing).
"Hello! Sam wanted me to tell you that he and Dean went out. They'll be back later."
Jack didn't say anything. "You feeling better now, kid?" Dean asked Jack.
Dean turned back to the angel at the sound of the weapon breaking. "Sorry, damn it," he said, softer now.
"We have most of the ingredients, Dean, and for the grace part Jack can help us out," Sam argued.
"Go," Dean demanded. Cas's facial expression left no room for objection. Jack sighed, but followed Dean and Cas's order. The hunter turned back to Cas. "What the hell do we do?"
"Are you going to watch me the entire time, Dean?" Cas asked after he was finished.
The rest of the drive was slightly faster, or maybe it just felt like it because Dean was paying as much attention to his driving as was necessary. His thoughts were racing a mile a minute. "He's alive" became the hunter's mantra, replaying in his head over and over.
He didn't say anything when Cas tentatively took a step closer, lifting Dean's hand in his own. The angel's thumb brushed away some dried blood on Dean's skin. He looked up, and Dean met his eyes.
"By 'it,' you mean-" Sam started to ask, shutting his book and looking up at Dean. "You mean the spell?"
"Then do it. Do your angel magic tricks and speed up the sobering-up process already if that's what you want." Dean crossed his arms. He didn't want to get lectured by Cas.
Without thinking, Dean lowered his head so that their foreheads touched. "I'm all yours, Cas," he whispered. "Always was, really."
"You're telling me this now?! Cas, what the hell? You should have told me!" Dean sounded anything but happy now.
"I have something I believe you would like." Cas led him to a somewhat-private space, but they were still within earshot, and sight, of Sam and Jack. "I was walking around and saw it. It made me think of you."
"What did you have in mind?"
Dean's anger came rushing back. He had no doubt he looked like a mess: tear-stained cheeks, kiss-swollen lips, and fire in his eyes. "You're going to pay for this," he growled. "Why the hell'd you even write this crap, huh? After every damn time you killed him already, you're ending it now?!"
He took the ring out of his pocket. Dean looked at it, not saying anything but picking it up. "Damn, this is nice," he eventually said. He didn't meet Cas's eyes.
"I can't rewrite the story," Chuck said, at least having the decency to look sorry, even if it was fake. With a snap of his fingers, the angel blade was gone. "He doesn't have a lot of time left." He looked at where Dean was covering the stab wound in a hopeless attempt to save the angel. "There's nothing you can do. He'll bleed out, Dean."
Dean laughed dryly. "Not enough."
Cas walked into the kitchen. Jack was looking at his phone and had ingrdients on a counter. "Jack, you're aware that humans can only go to Heaven or Hell, correct?"
"You listen to me," Cas urged Dean. He was finding it harder to move. Everything hurt. "Look. Thank you," he said, straining to get the words out. "Thank you. Knowing you, it..." Cas paused before speaking again. "It's been the best part of my life."
Dean drew in a sharp breath and lifted the shirt away from Cas's skin. There were still some signs that Cas had been stabbed with the lance, but the thick black lines were gone and there was no bleeding.
"Damn, I have an angel all to myself," Dean contentedly sighed. "What'd I even do to deserve this, huh?"
The angel blade didn't have to be touched to go in deeper. One almost-lazy motion from Chuck's pointing finger and the blade twisted in response. Dean held Cas close, as if proximity and sheer force of will was enough to save the angel's life.
"Yeah, okay, Dean. Whatever you say," Sam said, letting Dean off the hook.
"Yeah, why're you asking anyway?" Dean asked, but then he jumped as Cas appeared next to him, phone to his ear. He heard his own voice come out of it and winced. Damn, was that really how he sounded? Maybe it was the drinks' effect on him that made his voice sound worse than usual. "Son of a bitch, don't do that, Cas!"
Cas drew an angel blade from his sleeve and held the blade in his free hand. Without hesitating he threw it into Billie's chest. She laughed but took a few steps back in surprise.
"I would remind you if you did forget for whatever reason." Cas looked so damn happy, it was like he was brightening up the whole room. Maybe, Dean thought, maybe everything was just better now. "I know I'll remember myself."
"I don't know yet," Cas reluctantly admitted. If he'd had the time, Dean would have kissed the blush rising on Cas's cheeks; it was just too adorable and he didn't see Cas blush enough.
He waited in the library until Sam found him, Jack following closely. "You sure you're ready, Dean?" Sam asked, concern painted on his face.
"You're good at that," Dean whispered, his face suddenly very close to Cas's own. "That complimenting crap that I'm sure as hell not used to."
His gaze fell to the simple silver-white band on his ring finger, which looked like it had been made from the metal of an angel blade. It wasn't overly flashy or loud but it said enough: Dean Winchester was going to be married.
"'M in here, Sam," Dean said when Sam was close to the kitchen. He would have been in his room, but he'd just drained another bottle and Cas was still on his mind; that naturally meant more alcohol.
"I didn't think so, yeah, but I actually thought about it, and guess what? I'm crazy about your angelic ass." Dean led Cas into his room, shutting the door.
Cas lowered his head to get a better view and the action brought his hair close enough to Dean's face that if Dean moved even an inch, he would be resting his chin on the mess of dark brown hair that looked nearly black and breathing in the scent of Cas's shampoo.
Cas's hand was being moved away from Dean's face when the hunter stood up. Immediately, Cas missed having him so close. He was a distraction from the pain and inevitable death that awaited the angel.
"I liked it," Jack said, confused. "Isn't it better for you?"
"I wanted to." Cas shrugged. "I'm sorry if you don't want it, Dean."
Dean chuckled. "You're just not a handyman, buddy. C'mon over to my place and I'll help you find another job, okay?"
"Never mind. I found something," Sam said urgently. He thrust the book in front of Dean and pointed a single finger at the spell. "Look."
The sound quality was amazing. Whoever had kept this stuff in this condition had really taken their work seriously, Dean had to admit. Then again, maybe the library just had really good acoustics. Both of those things could have been true, or maybe just one of them.
"I can't be happy with you. These past few days have been the greatest days in my entire existence. That's why you should know that I made a deal with the Empty-" No. Too long of a beginning.
"I am. Now all you need to do is heal the cut." Jack nodded and within seconds, it was like nothing had happened. "Thank you."
The phone call ended and Dean laid back on the couch in his living room, setting the phone on the coffee table next to where his feet were propped up. After a minute, he got up and went into the master bedroom to get his laptop.
Cas flinched when Dean picked up the lance. He gripped it tightly on either side and split it in two pieces, his anger fueling him.
"After all we've been through," Dean said, kneeling down next to Cas on the floor. He was almost shielding Cas's body with his own. "You're giving up? Cas, what the hell?"
In the kitchen, Dean took a moment to collect himself. Yes, Cas was one of the most handsome guys Dean had ever met and his eyes were the stormiest blue Dean had ever seen, but Cas was just his friend. Any chances he had at dating his socially awkward friend had disappeared years ago when Cas introduced Dean to his girlfriend, April.
Dean's eyes widened impossibly further. He opened and closed his mouth, but nothing came out. "Shut up, Cas, okay? Tell me when you're not dying," he basically pleaded. "You gotta live, damn it! Hang in there, Cas."
Black clothing melded with the back nothingness of the Empty. A scythe menacingly begged its owner to draw blood from Dean or Cas or both. "Billie," Dean muttered. "Now what, Cas?"
"Now what did you have to tell me?" Dean asked.
"I will gladly accept any assiatance you're willing to offer." Cas pulled his hand back and Dean subtly touched the spots where Cas's fingers had landed, feeling the ghost sensation of his touch.
"I'm the one who's causing you so much trouble and pain," Cas said. "I'm still going to die, Dean."
Cas could have all the chick flick moments he wanted. He could have everything, he could have his true happiness, when Dean saw him and held him in the kind of embrace not intended for a friend only. Cas could have Dean-- all of him, until there was nothing left to give. Even then, Cas was welcome to take and take until he was satisfied.
He was right. Cas didn't want to imagine the effect his decision would have on the brothers; they would feel betrayed, no doubt. The angel could still remember Dean's reaction when Cas revealed to him that he'd chosen to stay in Purgatory, rather than leave with the hunter. This would be so much worse. At least in that case, Dean still had hope he was alive. Now, he'd be dead and Dean would be left with nothing to hope for.
"So you don't want my help? It's cool if you don't, but I do want to help your ass." Dean moved to shut the computer, but Cas's hand on his wrist stopped the motion.
Dean sighed and just called him. "I'm fine now, okay? Just get your ass over here." Did Cas also hear the pleading in his voice?
Finally, Dean knelt down and ran a hand down the glass and then the tie. "I love you, and I'll keep telling you until you get sick of it. I don't give a crap if you're gone either, Cas. You being dead doesn't change how I feel."
The lingering pain was just tolerable enough to get Cas to the Impala, which was waiting outside. Still, every step required more effort than the last one. The sight of the car was more than enough to bring tears to Cas's eyes. It was a sweet kind of relief. "Almost there," Dean said soothingly.
But he had lost the fight already. Some part of him had long since accepted his feelings for the angel, but the rest of him had covered it up. Now, thanks to his little brother, he got the sense he was fully exposed.
Cas's reunion with Sam was shorter than Dean's by a long shot, but still touching to watch and just as meaningful. The angel faithfully returned to Dean and smiled like everything was right for once.
He shifted in his seat and set the laptop on his thighs. Cas's blue eyes were intently focused on Dean's waist and legs—close to the screen lighting up but not quite paying attention to it—until he cleared his throat at Dean's questioning look.
The movie was good, but Cas could never focus on it completely. "What'd you think?" Dean asked once it was over.
"Cas was here? What'd he do?" Sam asked, taking a seat at the table.
"Dean? I'm back," Sam called to him. "Here, I got you a cheeseburger." Dean gratefully took the burger and tore into it, hungrier than he'd thought he was. "You seem kinda upset," Sam observed.
Dean drove endlessly, only stopping to get gas and coffee. The only word he could process in his head was
"I suppose that's fair. I apologize for assuming anything, Dean." Cas paused. "Are you at the bunker?"
A few minutes later, sounding defeated, Dean said to Jack, "Let's get the hell out already."
And then there it was-- the most perfect sound in the world. "Dean."
"Does it even freaking matter, Sammy?" Dean asked his brother accusingly, narrowing his eyes. Sam's face softened. Dean had no idea how bad he must have looked for Sam to look at him with so much damn
"There's no way to get out of it," Jack confirmed next, having nothing else to say. "You're always meant to go to the Empty. You're an angel."
"You are now husband and husband," Jack announced, smiling proudly and looking like the sun in human form. He was crying but not caring who saw.
"You don't. I never expected anything different." Cas smiled, but it was a sad smile.
He drew in a shaky breath. "I was just thinking about when we first met, because I had no idea that you would mean this damn much to me back then. I saw you as an asshole with a stick so far up your ass you couldn't see me as anything other than Michael's vessel. I thought you were pretty freaking hot, I know that," Dean admitted, "but terrifying as anything I saw in Hell."
With some effort he lifted Dean's hand off of his shoulder. He let his fingers intertwine with the hunter's for half a second before pulling his own hand away. "Go. Save yourself. I'm going to die, but you still have a chance to live."
"The process is actually very easy, Jack." Cas smiled easier now. He was so close to having freedom and happiness. It was liberating. "A shallow cut should be enough."
"Yeah," Dean said. "Can you give us some privacy, kid?"
It was the best kiss Dean had ever had, and he wasn't willing to let it end. Luckily, neither was Cas. Over a decade of unresolved tension whenever the two of them were in the same room built up and the turnout was a kiss that threatened to burn Dean from the inside out.
he typed.
He decided to forgo getting a beer and rejoined Cas in the living room. "So? Anything?" he asked.
"Bring him back, yeah?" Dean squeezed Cas's hand once before letting him go.
Both Sam and Eileen were watching Dean expectantly, so to take the focus off of himself, Dean joked, "Soon it'll be you, huh?"
A minute or so later Dean said, "I was wondering when the kid would turn into a teenager." He chuckled. "What'd you tell him? No parties for a month?"
"I couldn't stand the thought of hurting everyone if I didn't. No matter how cold you were, Dean." The former angel shrugged.
A voice in Cas's head told him to stop before he took things too far. But the voice was ignored, because Dean was kissing him and it was perfect. The angel could feel Dean smiling into the kiss. They only broke apart after a few minutes because of Dean needing to catch his breath.
Well fuck. What was Dean supposed to say to that? He found himself opening and closing his mouth with nothing coming out. He took a step back, hoping to put more room between himself and Cas. Not much, but just enough to think clearly. He'd had no idea how to talk to Cas when the guy was close enough for Dean to see every detail of his face and commit it to memory.
"How do you know that?" Cas asked, even more confused now.
Jack wasn't asking Dean if he loved Cas, but telling him he did. Cas held his breath, waiting for Dean's answer.
"Awesome," Dean said, smiling and winking. "We've got this. Don't worry about a damn thing."
"Oh yeah. Listen," Dean said, smiling like a kid at Christmas.
And that home was coming right back to him. He always did.
Sam called over, "Want a beer, Dean?" while moving closer to them. "Dean?"
"You aren't exactly the type of person to discuss how you're feeling, Dean, yet you're trying to make me do just that," Cas pointed out. "That isn't exactly fair, is it?"
"What-the-hell-ever. Fine." Dean purposely fell back into his seat like a child throwing a tantrum. "I'm getting tired of talking to you already, Sammy."
One look at the spell and Dean shook his head. "No way. It can't--" he began saying, "it's not gonna work. Why the hell'd you even show me, huh?"
Cas lifted his head off of Dean's shoulder. His pupils were blown out and the thinnest ring of blue remained. Dean felt Cas start to breathe heavier against him. His heart felt like it was going to beat out of his chest.
"Remember Eileen?" Dean asked Cas while digging through the bag. He found a bacon cheeseburger and took his time looking it over before taking a bite. When Cas nodded, Dean said, "Sammy's seeing her," with his mouth full of food.
That was the last thing he said before falling asleep. The floor was uncomfortable as all hell, but Dean wouldn't have changed a thing.
"Yes, it is," Cas agreed.
. Definitely not Dean's top choice. But he really wanted to test out the record player, so he brought the record with him too.
"I should speak first. There's something you don't know and should already." Cas met Dean's eyes across the table. "However, I suppose I have no choice at this point," he said teasingly. At the very least, he could put a positive spin on things.
He could hear Cas sighing into the phone. "The slushy machine broke after I tried using it, Dean. I could not fix it."
The hunter chastised himself. He couldn't be thinking of silver linings when Cas was dying slowly, right there in his arms. At least he didn't sound like he was in pain. Still, the look on his face gave it all away. "Is this funny to you, you son of a bitch?" Dean yelled at Chuck.
When Dean started to head in a different direction, Cas took a step after him and wrapped a hand around his wrist. "Where are you going, Dean?" he asked.
Dean brought the two of them even closer. Cas looked up at the hunter in surprise and then buried his face in Dean's neck. Dean felt his hot breath on his skin and it was close to driving him crazy.
Dean had said the three words that terrified him the most where Cas was concerned countless times. It wouldn't have come as a surprise if he even said "I love you" in his sleep. One morning he woke up with the words on his lips.
Another thing he was absolutely sure about was that he couldn't hold up his end of the deal. He had people he cared about, and who cared about him, and just the thought of hurting them by leaving like that felt wrong.
"I don't like thinking that I'm prolonging the inevitable," Cas said to Jack. Jack had nothing to say to that.
Billie watched them, amused. "If he leaves, I leave too, Dean. You bring both of us back or none of us." She smirked down at Cas, Cas's hand now clasped in Dean's tightly. He was probably cutting off Dean's circulation with his grip but Dean wouldn't have it any other way.
"Theoretically, yes. I have never actually done it, however."
"He kept you around for me, Cas. To him you're an extra, a damn side character, but to me you're everything." Dean looked right into Cas's eyes, his gaze so intense the angel found it impossible to look away. "There's nothing stopping us from having our own ending. I bet your ass he was waiting for this."
No words came out. How was Cas supposed to tell Dean he was going to leave and never come back now? Cas had long since accepted Dean hadn't wanted him, not even daring to hope for his feelings to be reciprocated. But here he was, with Dean Winchester offering him exactly that.
"As ready as I'll ever be," Dean assured him. "You okay with this, kid?" he asked Jack.
Sam chuckled and went on his way; he seemed relieved that Dean wasn't wallowing in sorrow and drinking his pain away. Of course this meant that Dean wouldn't tell Sam about the two or three beers he'd already had to drink earlier. And they'd done absolutely nothing.
Cas was more than happy to comply. "I love you. I am in love with you, Dean Winchester."
"There'll be time for that later," Dean promised, hoping he looked more confident and calm than he felt. "You gotta live," he said again. "Don't die on me," he begged. Yep, Dean definitely wasn't looking calm, he already knew.
"Cas," Dean said helplessly before Cas squinted, titled his head, and sealed their lips together.
He couldn't get to the Impala fast enough. With every step, he fought a smile. Dean could barely think straight. The sudden excitement thrumming through his veins made it impossible; he couldn't manage to sit still either.
"I was right," Cas said to himself. "It looks perfect on you." He looked at Dean, whose eyes were locked onto their hands touching and the ring he now wore. "Thank you for accepting it, Dean."
"He's gotten good," Dean agreed, and Jack beamed, looking at him with adoration. Cas smiled at the sight. Jack saw Dean as another parent, looking to Dean for approval. It was sweet to watch.
Dean had set up a grave for Cas after the Empty took him. Even though Cas had disappeared-- no body left behind-- the hunter felt that Cas deserved this at least. He'd marked the vacant grave with a jagged piece of black glass that the Men of Letters had kept hidden in storage for some reason and kept the angel's plain blue tie underneath the glass.
The next day, the sky was blue and cheerful. Dean hated it.
Jack's voice broke the spell between Dean and Cas. Their little bubble of happiness and all-encompassing love shattered, and Dean had to remind himself not to get pissed off at Jack. He'd have plenty more moments to lose himself in Cas's words, his pure fucking honesty, his intoxicating warmth, and so much more. "We should leave," Jack urged them.
"I'm sorry. If that ever does happen, Jack, I hope you know I never meant for it to." The nephilim just nodded his head.
"You can think it all you'd like, I highly doubt it will change anything," Cas said in a voice that matched his smile.
"Should have told me sooner," Dean said with a forced chuckle. "I knew, though, Cas, and I love you too, okay?"
"You heard it here first," Dean joked through happy tears he couldn't hold back. "The new God's just said we're married."
Sam exhaled. "Fine, Dean. But I'm not giving up on Cas, and neither should you." With that, Sam turned and left, and Dean was left feeling worse than ever.
Without mentioning that Cas had a key to his house, Dean dutifully obeyed and ushered his friend inside.
He opened the back door and Cas willingly got in, stretching out a bit in order to find the position that would be the most comfortable. He finally settled for laying on his back across the whole backseat. "I'll try to go easy on you," Dean promised. His eyes met Cas's in the mirror.
"That's cool, yeah." Dean set the laptop on the bed. He motioned for Cas to lay down and then laid down opposite him. "You know what? Come here." Without prompting, Dean pulled the angel closer.
"I'm never letting your ass go, baby," Dean promised, slipping Cas's ring on. "Never."
Not long after that, Dean headed to his room. He'd attempted texting Cas, but he'd been left on read, because Cas was being an asshole and purposely ignoring him.
Jack quickly learned what had happened and in the days since, he had stuck close to Cas and assured him he did the right thing. He rarely spoke to Dean anymore and if the hunter tried anything with the nephilim nearby, Jack's grace would flash in his eyes as a warning.
"Good. Now let's get you something to eat, Cas." Dean held out a hand to help Cas up. He gratefully took it. Neither one let go on the way to the kitchen.
Cas tilted his head in the way he always did. "I fail to see how that's a reason to drink. You could have easily talked to me instead of doing this." He pointedly looked down at the empty beer bottles.
Cas felt Jack's eyes on him as he and Dean joined the nephilim and Sam in the kitchen the next morning. "You look happy," Sam said to them. "Dean finally said it, then?"
It just made him more curious, and the more Dean thought about Cas, the more he drank. It was a cycle that went on for a while longer until Dean felt somewhat drunk. His tolerance to alcohol wouldn't let him get farther than that.
"How? I thought you were really dead," Jack asked, confused. Dean silently asked that same question.
"Have a good night," she said once she'd clued in to Dean's discrete warning. When her back was turned to the two of them, Dean rushed to shut the door, herding Cas inside.
Cas frowned, looking tired of this argument already even though it had just started. "I do. But I owned up to it and haven't done it since then. You kept your thoughts and feelings hidden away from me, Dean, knowing fully well that you were withholding information. I'd much rather see you without the influence of beer and liquor than the way you are now."
"Yes, I am, Dean." When Cas looked at Jack, he mouthed the word 'sorry.' The angel smiled and nodded. "Can I talk to Cas for a moment?"
Dean's heart picked up speed like he'd just run with Sam in the morning (he'd actually done it once and had sworn against it ever since). He wanted to believe Cas was real and not permanently asleep the way Jack did. Of course, the kid would know better than Dean, who was just a human, so maybe he was more trusting of the guy he was hugging.
Something caught his eye suddenly. There was some kind of round object he must have stepped on, but it looked to be in good condition still. Cas quickly gathered that it was something of value; it practically screamed it as the angel got closer to get a better look.
"Love? You- you think I love Cas? I've heard some crazy shit from you before, but I swear that's not it. No way in hell am I in love with-" Dean shook his head. "Just shut up already."
Dean suddenly made the decision to forget that he and the angel were just friends and pulled Cas's body close to his own. "Follow my lead, okay?" he asked Cas with a wink.
He sat up and instantly paid the price for sleeping on the floor. He was sore all over. "Next time, I'm taking the bed," he muttered.
"I am now. Don't worry about a damn thing," Dean promised his angel, because Cas was now his. "Sammy found a spell that opened a portal here, and I was so damn hopeful to see you again, angel, but before then I was freaking terrified to hope, because if it didn't work I'd want to end myself right then and there."
"Oh, Dean," Cas said reverently. Those two words held all the affection in the world in them.
Dean walked over to Cas's table and took Jack's seat. "Or no phone? Been a while since I was a teenager," he went on.
Sam rolled his eyes but stood up. "I'll get Jack," he said as he clapped Dean on the shoulder. "And Dean? I'm proud of you for not deciding to give up. If I had the chance to see Elieen again, I'd be scared of it not working out too."
Rather than nod and mumble a "thank you" Dean smiled as best he could and reached out to ruffle Jack's hair, feeling like an unofficial dad. He wondered if his relationship with Cas--because he
"Whether or not you're feeling the effects of the amount of alcohol you've consumed is not the point." Cas moved into Dean's personal space. "You forget I know not just every part of your body, but your moods and emotions as well. Something is on your mind."
And for once, that was true.
Dean made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. "Classic PB&J, Cas. It's awesome."
Unable to help himself, Dean returned the grin with one of his own and pressed a hand to his back, nodding for Cas to sit down. "Hey," he eventually said once they were both seated.
Cas nodded. He'd heard this from Dean already. "Are you saying he's going to blame you?"
The sound of Dean's phone ringing actually startled him. Of course Sammy was calling. "I'm almost there," Sam said. "You don't mind me going to see Eileen, right, Dean?"
"That's the best damn news I've heard all day," Dean said, giving in to his desire to hug Cas close. He buried his face in Cas's neck, wanting nothing more than to feel the angel's body close to his and so full of life. Cas was shocked for a second by the action but didn't hesitate to return the hug. "Can I see-?" Dean asked, pulling away just enough to look down at where the wound had been.
"I'm not losing you like this, and I don't care what you say." Dean carefully wrapped one arm around Cas's waist to keep him steady.
"I'm on my way." Cas sounded tired, resigned to the fact that Dean was moody, but he agreed easily enough.
The angel shot him a look like he was tired of Dean already, but there was something affectionate in his blue eyes.
"Hey Cas," Dean said, wishing he was more drunk. He felt almost nervous just speaking to the guy now.
Dean hesitated before asking, "What's it like wherever you are? Are you just surrounded by nothing in the Empty or are they getting creative and torturing you in there now too? I swear I'll kick their ass if you're suffering," he promised Cas, even though he had no idea how to even summon the Empty and ask what the angel was experiencing there. "Jack asked about how I first met you, you know. That's kinda what got me thinking, and when I said Bobby and me shot you until we ran out of bullets, the kid was shocked. He couldn't believe I tried to stab you either, and I can't anymore either, because you're everything to me, angel. You mean more to me than I ever thought possible, damn it."
"Getting comfortable?" Cas said, but it came out more like a question. "I'm sorry, Dean."
"I like dancing with you very much," Cas whispered into Dean's skin.
"You weren't exactly subtle," Dean said, "but it's nice to hear you say it back. I'm glad I'm not drunk so I don't forget," he said with a laugh.
"Nah, I just wanted to talk to you, you know? Without death coming after our asses." Dean shrugged even though Cas couldn't see it.
"We can hold it off, though! What if the Empty was satisfied to have me after all, and it can be reasoned with?"
Dean smiled and nodded. "Keep it that way," he said, adding a wink at the end. "You're mine now anyway, right?"
When he'd found Cas slumped against the tree in Purgatory, it had felt like he was releasing a deep breath he had no idea he'd been holding. Every time Cas had returned after dying yet again it was like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. Everything was just better with the angel around. He and Dean had some sort of sense when the other was around, like they were perfectly attuned to one another's moods. Dean could easily say he'd become an expert in Cas's body language; he was always aware of the angel. "That's not it, damn it," Dean insisted, but he was fighting a losing battle with himself. "Of course I care about him, but still, that doesn't have to be love."
Dean had started tapping his fingers to the music without realizing it, and considered turning off the record player before he had a whole chick flick moment by himself in the library. It wasn't a bad song, okay? Dean just appreciated good music.
Dean's hands were slick with blood. Cas's blood, because the guy decided to stand up to his father, not thinking about anything else besides Dean's safety and keeping Dean from getting hurt. At least Sammy wasn't with them, right? If he were, Chuck would have more to hold over Dean.
"You gonna just appear again?" Dean asked.
"You're not dead," was all Dean could think to say.
Dean reached out to take Cas's hand at the end of the aisle and looked out at everybody and everything. The chairs holding all the guests were white and he'd walked towards Cas on a path of stones that looked both natural and manmade. Bees buzzed and minded their own business at the arrangements of flowers set up at even intervals, blossoms in every color and size because Cas couldn't choose just one. "Hey," he managed to say, taking in the sight of the angel wearing a black suit like his own.
Whatever the reason, Dean walked away from Cas and turned around, one hand outstretched. "Castiel," he asked, "will you dance with me?"
The record player hadn't stopped during the phone call. Sam must not have heard it, or he ignored it.
"Don't talk about death," Dean urged him, flipping over his hand so that he was holding Cas's. "Your hand's shaking," he said, grip tightening. "You've got me, angel, you've got me, yeah?"
"But-" Jack started to argue.
"I told you, Cas," Dean said, smirking. He watched, pleased, as Cas ate both halves of the sandwich.
Eileen and Rowena broke away from the brothers to sit down; Eileen with Mary and Bobby, and Rowena with Crowley and Gavin. Rowena shot her son a warning look and Crowley sighed, pasting on a smile that looked fake but was acceptable to his mother.
"I know." Cas looked down at his lap. He could feel Jack staring at him. "You're right, Jack."
It seemed silly to call Cas angelic, but he was every inch an angel in this moment, now more than usual. "Hello, Dean."
He stopped driving entirely when he saw Cas was passed out. Ignoring other drivers' yelling, he abruptly pulled into an empty parking lot. He only had to wait a few seconds before he joined Cas in the backseat, but those seconds felt like an eternity.
He nodded at Dean and Cas.
And then the distance between them got even smaller... their foreheads touched and Dean wordlessly nodded in response to the question in Cas's eyes.
"I know you did a great job, Jack."
"This is it. There's no cure for this," Cas insisted, watching Dean's fingers trail helplessly over the black lines on his body. They didn't hurt, at least not too much. Cas shivered under Dean's touch. "Let me speak before I'm truly dead."
The call ended, and Cas looked down at his phone, amazed at how just a single call from Dean made him feel better. He always felt a sense of belonging when he was with him, that was true. Dean had forgiven him no matter what he had done (and Cas had done a lot of unforgivable things). The hunter's smile lit up every room he walked into. He was home in human form.
Finally at the bunker, Dean got Cas into an empty bedroom with Sam's help. Almost immediately after, he kicked Sam out. "You're home, Cas, and I won't let you die, you son of a bitch," he assured the angel. Then he went back to his own room, even though every part of him was hesitant to leave Cas alone.
