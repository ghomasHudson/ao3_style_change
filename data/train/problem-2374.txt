“Okay.”
Sherlock was curled up smaller than John would’ve thought possible for a boy his height, knees bent in, folded beneath him. His entire body was shaking,
“Bathroom.” John replied. “Are you alright?”
That was until they went to bed.
“I can’t hear you when you’re talking to the bar, mate.”
to pick on it would be blue, the same as your house, which is the reason you picked Ravenclaw so the hat could sort you considering you fall equally into all four,
“I guess it is. You don’t take issue with it?”
The room was strange. Strange for Sherlock meant anything but.
“Mycroft whats wrong?” Anthea asked, dropping what she was holding as he slammed open the door with such a back it startled her. There were others in the room than her and Irene but Mycroft didn’t care, his heart was racing and his entire body was shaking as his head spun with thoughts.
He didn’t expect to get caught, however.
“Oh, okay then.”
Because that’s what Sherlock did.
John didn’t run, he didn’t scream, he didn’t hit. He stared wide and scared into Sherlocks own gaze, tears began to well and suddenly it all came crashing down. Sherlock watched it happen like it was all in slow motion. “I’m so sorry- I- I’m so fucking sorry!”
“Can you get cook to send a few pastry things up to my room. Twat over here hasn’t eaten for-“ He turned to face John, who tensed up now they were both staring at him. Sherlock’s eyes traced over his body then rested at his face, his expression annoyed. “Two days… Something to keep him
He wasn’t sure if he was caught off guard, disappointed, or somehow overridden with attraction. Yes, he’d found Gregory striking before, he’d have been insane not to. What with the Gryffindor’s sharp jaw, slight stubble and dark entrancing eyes, it was difficult not to be completely enamoured, but Mycroft had incredible self-restraint.
huh!?” He had his arms planted on either side of John’s head, locking him in.
Ah. That made much more sense. He hadn't taken John to be a gymnast.
A strike of hope hit him, and his heart began to race as he caught sight of a raised hand in a leather glove.
Mycroft mimicked his actions and stood up, but his movements were those of panic. “It wasn’t my place to-“
Suddenly the Gryffindor’s eyes lit up and his expression filled with excitement like he’d just had the greatest idea in the world. “Here, look- What do you see in it then?” John spoke up, pulling Sherlock into the position he was in, so he had a clear view of the mirror.
If there was anything in the world that could make Mycroft run, it was his little brother within a ten-metre radius of his plants.
want me to?”
“No promises.” John replied with a gentle laugh. Suddenly the rest of the world didn’t feel like it existed anymore. It was just him, and Sherlock, talking, laughing. No pressure to look nice or give compliments like there was with Sarah.
“Depends.”
“That was quite the show you put on. You’ve always had a flair for the dramatic.” Mycroft spoke, as the staircases changed, and he led his little brother a different route to the commons.
He cried out the moment he entered. “Pardon, Merlin, I am so sorry.”
Greg raised an eyebrow and then raised his hands in mock defence. “I see where I'm not welcomed.” He replied and John’s face flushed, and he rolled his eyes.
“Well you are the best drama queen I know.”
He wasn’t even sure that
, so he realised she wanted to know more about their involvement in the ordeal. “We were in the library at the time, I heard the scream. John wrote it off as a practical joke, but there wasn’t anything that followed. Just the scream, then silence. I knew something was wrong after that, so we went to look. All we know is that the person who did it, is somebody she looks up to both metaphorically and literally. Raised shoulders says shyness, line of sight says shorter. The rest she’ll tell you when she wakes.”
“Yeah. I don’t need Mycroft.” He spoke quietly to himself, pushing himself up and deciding that he would sleep, maybe an hour would do him alright considering he couldn’t obtain the caffeine he needed to sufficiently keep himself awake.
He dropped his trunk on the doorstep with an exaggerated sigh, as he fumbled with his keys to open the door. There weren’t very many things on his keys, a house key to his dad’s, a key to Harry’s, a keychain he’d gotten on a holiday to France and a multitool.
“I finished my picture daddy!” Rosie declared.
John cleared his throat first. “I didn’t mean it, any of it, you aren’t a freak, and I'm sorry I ever said that you weren’t my friend.” Sherlock thought it would stop there but apparently John had more to say. “You aren’t normal, I’ll give you that, but you’re extraordinary, you’re clever and-  and you’re brilliant, and you’re my best mate. I was insecure and I was angry, I thought if I insulted you I would feel less bad about the things you said. I really am sorry, Sherlock.”
He turned his back, pulling the hoodie over his head, it came gently due to how big it was on him. He slipped his bad arm into the binder, using the leverage of his other arm going in to pull it down over his head, but anything further than that was futile.
She looked around, as if she was only now careful of anyone else being in the room or listening. “Look she isn’t who she says she is, and I’ve got nothing to lose now, so I can let you know what she’s really like.”
“Ballocks. Your eyes look like two piss-holes in the snow, what other explanation is there?” He sat back before a look of realisation came over his face. “Unless it’s because of Sarah, you aren’t going soft, are you Watson? You’re a better player than she is, I
“See that I wouldn’t fill it out yet.” John finished for him, ignoring the furious blush that took over his face as the three of them glanced at him in shock for interrupting, and Sherlock looked impressed.  “The sleeves are annoying when you don’t have much arm muscle. I uh, I used to play football so it’s all in my legs really, I'm a sprinter more than anything. But we’re doing rugby now, so maybe I’ll grow into it.” He laughed, trying to normalise the situation he’d catapulted himself into.
“My advice? We divide and conquer, there’s six that I know of.”
“That’s… Extraordinary, quite extraordinary.” John replied softly, taking a sip of his tea. It was made perfectly as well. This didn’t feel real to him.
“What are you looking at?” He asked, setting the mug beside Sherlock, who took his eyes from the lap equipment, offering him a smile before he took a sip.
But that isn’t what happened.
He ignored his phone even after he got out of the shower, there was nobody to judge him but himself, and he still felt that checking it twenty minutes after he’d sent the message would be embarrassingly desperate.
“I should’ve seen it coming.” John spoke quietly, getting started on making tea, two mugs hit the counter, and the taller man smiled to himself.
, Mycroft.” With a proper posture that could have been genuinely threatening to the elder, Mycroft guessed that Sherlock had taught him well.
He gave an annoyed grunt as he slipped it back onto his finger.
He didn’t doubt that Sherlock was looking at him now, curled up in a vest top and a ridiculous pair of tartan pyjama bottoms, curled in on himself in a way that could hardly be considered comfortable. He didn’t doubt that the Ravenclaw was sat cross-legged deducing him just by the positioning of his hands or how tensed his shoulder was beneath the younger boy’s palm.
There was a moment of silence, Anthea stopped typing to look at Mycroft, and Mycroft had his hands clasped, staring at the flicker of the candle even when his vision began to blur.
Then his Hogwarts letter came, along with a half giant knocking at his door. Followed by buckets of frustration because he couldn’t even do the simplest of spells.
They sat like that for a small while, the only sounds were Sherlock’s contented breathing and attempts at words of comfort, and John’s choked sobs from pent up stress and sadness, that he’d never let show before. Always too scared.
“It hurt to breathe, and my breaths were uneven, and I just had to get out of there before I threw up because there was just too many people. Too many people.”
He needed to clear his head, re-evaluate all that had just happened, and then quite honestly, he needed to fucking sleep.
It had been two weeks and so far he was going strong, still trying to put together the pieces as to how Molly Hooper was stupefied if he didn’t do it.
“Are you not?”
He managed to remove the top robes of his quidditch kit, leaving him in the trousers and a vest.
He checked the most likely spare bedroom for John to have run to, and the second most likely spare bedroom. After he reached the fifth most likely, he gave up, John would show up at some point. That, or Mrs Hudson would find him and drag him to the dining room for dessert, knowing he hadn’t eaten.
he respond? Sherlock obviously knew how big of a deal this was to John, the idea of not having to be permanently uncomfortable with himself. He could have cried, or vomited, or both. Neither of those would be the most flattering thing to do in his bed, with his lover. So, he pushed himself up, much to Sherlock’s annoyance, as expressed by an annoyed grumble. “Do you want a cup of tea?” He asked, before Sherlock could verbalise his complaint.
The four-year-old turned her head from John’s chest to look at him, and John was looking at him with equal amount of curiosity. The detective could’ve grinned at how alike they were now Rosie could show it. “Really?” She asked with wide eyes riddled with excitement, and a genuine smile broke out onto Sherlock’s face, knowing she was going to calm down now she’d been distracted.
“As opposed to whom?” Mycroft smirked with a raised eyebrow.
, his only proper friend and I insulted him. I called him a freak, Mike. I'm just as bad as Anderson.” His voice broke, and he rubbed a hand over his face in an attempt to hide the distress, but he knew he wasn’t fooling anybody, least of all himself.
“You’re welcome. You played well.” Sherlock replied. He looked a little stunned, which was new, considering he usually had an answer for everything.
“I’ll walk you to the commons.” Greg spoke suddenly, now they’d begun walking. He seemed to be making no effort in the slightest to drop Mycroft’s hand, and Mycroft had no interest in it either.
John paused for a moment, staring at him. “…You’re welcome.”
“Two butterbeer?” She asked, cleaning a glass, looking pointedly at Mycroft. Greg was staring at her, if he’d been paying more attention he’d have noticed it
“Make me then, smart-arse.”
“Yet neither you or Mycroft can fly?”
A stinging fire of pain shot across his face and he dropped his spoon. There it was. He expected it, he knew it was probably coming but it shocked him more than he’d expected it would. He turned to see Sarah, looking furious, es expected. Her face was as red as the handprint on his cheek and her expression looked like she’d just been slapped.
“Do you want to be in Slytherin?” Mycroft asked.
The Ravenclaw handed the cube to John, who looked at him confused. “Mix it up, it’ll be no fun if I do, make it a challenge.” John rolled his eyes, but he was giving Sherlock that smile of amazement he did when Sherlock was being particularly clever, or helpful.
As from the scarf a faint melody began to flow, before growing louder.
“I don’t see the issue, we could make this a weekly arrangement. I have nothing better to do.”
“Anthea, Sally, Anderson, John, I think Sherlock brought you something as well, but I think John forced him. I didn’t get you anything because I didn’t leave. Oh, and McGonagall brought you flowers too.” He listed on his fingers, quite quickly but clear enough for Greg to understand.
“Myc?” He called out, he could hear music playing softly throughout. Mycroft had given him a record player for his birthday, though it seemed to be more of a present for Mycroft than for Greg himself. He didn’t mind it though.
“Hey freak! Don’t have your boyfriend to protect you now, do you?” The distinguishable nasally drawl of Phillip Anderson came from behind him. He didn’t turn round, and continued walking, a stupid miscalculation, he’d insulted Anderson less than a week ago, likening the chances of persistence in his torment. “Nothing clever to say? There’s a change.” An abrupt hand on his shoulder flipped him round so he was facing the seventh year. “Gone deaf now have you?”
like tea, that’s because the Queen of England drinks it. She can’t drink anything unless it looks like tea.” Sherlock replied his tone perfectly serious, and John stared at him in disbelief, but Rosie bought it completely.
“Was the dream about me again?” He asked, his voice a monotone drawl, he didn’t feel like putting any emotion into his tone of voice.
“Tremor in your hand, not to cause offense. As well as the positioning of your tan. I noticed it but couldn’t quite place what it was. Shot in the shoulder was it?”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” The question came from nowhere, and then there was a mug of tea sat in front of him, and then a man sat in front of him, his head resting against his hands.
Putting his arm there was a bad idea.
“What happened?”
“Even coke.” He replied, and she backed away from him deciding he was telling the truth. “Now, you have to drink it quickly, or it won’t work.” Sherlock smiled at her and she put the cup to her lips tentatively.
John’s girlfriend and essentially been drugging him since second year.
Greg’s face twisted in surprise as he ate it, it did not taste like mint. “That’s, chocolate?”
“Yeah, and you don’t, which is nerve-wracking.” John laughed, wincing again as his head hurt, he offered Sherlock a smile of gratitude as the Ravenclaw passed him a paper bag with a sandwich in it.
He’d insisted in Angelo’s that he wasn’t gay, and a plethora of other times since then. Obvious lie, well partially. If he wasn’t he could have easily showed or told the name of his tattoo to prove that he wasn’t gay, nor Sherlock’s date. If he wasn’t he wouldn’t have protested it so harshly.
He knew this was new to Mycroft, and as much of a genius as he was, Greg was aware he couldn’t know the courtesies of everything.
Conrad laughed. “Merlin save us.”
John smiled, softly, staring down at his mug.
Greg ended up falling asleep on Mycroft’s shoulder, the Slytherin ended up reading on his phone, unmoving so to not disturb the other boy. John lounged back, able to put his legs up on the seat as he had the full side to himself, he was trying to catch some sleep, but he couldn’t.
“We?”
It was the weekend, and as dastardly as it was, Greg had come to meet John at Hogsmeade. He didn’t know much other than John had sounded upset in his letter and was at the point where breaking the rules was no longer an issue to him.
“At your own risk, then.”
“Why do you think calling me names is going to persuade me?”
He did scream for a little bit, trying to see what pitch and dynamic would affect the walls enough to echo. A sharp rap on the door came, it didn’t make him jump considering he had a brain enough to expect it. “Go to sleep, Mr. Holmes.”
“Sorry,” He laughed awkwardly. “This went better in my head. I uhm, I wanted to thank you, I suppose. Your playing, the violin I think it is? It’s lovely, quite lovely indeed.”
Greg laughed, shaking his head. “That’s comforting.”
. He replied simply, his knuckles sharp against the door frame before he walked down the stairs, quick on his feet.
He parted ways with his friends, following the rest of his snake housed family. They didn’t like him very much, despite being a pureblood, though not many people cared about blood status anymore. He supposed it was because he kept himself well in line, and only spoke out when he disagreed, though those were just theories. It didn’t bother him much anyway, Lestrade always kept him a seat at the Gryffindor table, so he was never really alone.
Greg didn’t think Mycroft even knew what Morse code even was, did the wizarding world ever see the telegraph? He doubted it.
“You know you really don’t need to be tested, you know them already.”
“Rubik’s.” John replied simply, he didn’t sound it out in syllables like he was talking to a child. Most muggle-borns were prone to doing that to purebloods. Then again he supposed it was a pleasantry that came as a result of Sherlock not babying him when it came to incantations. “Some Hungarian bloke made it in the seventies.” John replied, reading off the back of the packaging that had been discarded onto the middle seat.
“Do you mind this?” He asked, very aware of the position of his back.
“From when you went to the palace? In the sheet?”
John licked his lips, taking a step back before realising he’d forgotten his cane and stumbling, he gripped the door frame to keep himself upright and tried to will his face not to flush as the man gave him an odd look.
“Ding ding ding.” The Gryffindor laughed, with a nod. “Name three ingredients needed for a Polyjuice potion.”
Breaths calm and shoulders relaxed, he walked back into the Slytherin commons, grabbing one of his umbrellas before heading out, ignoring the looks he was given by everyone who had seen his outburst before.
She was dressed up, makeup done, hair curled boots on, clearly prepared for a date with her latest. Sherlock didn’t really like how much she flitted from boy to boy, but he supposed he didn’t know what it was like. He’d spent his teenage-hood being the youngest in university. It wasn’t really up to him anyway, she was very independent these days, needless to say he was very proud of her.
“Lock’s, I broke his microscope, accident. Yeah, I’m meeting Andrew outside the pub.” She replied, looking increasingly more dejected when John sighed at her.
She groaned at him like he was the one in the wrong. “You’re such a cock!” Rosie shouted at him, tailing him as he paraded round the living room, looking for his phone. He had half a mind to tell her to watch her language, but the phrase spoken made her sound so much like her dad he didn’t have the heart to.
“How does that even work? Wait no- I don’t want to know.” The Gryffindor replied shaking his head in disbelief. “Levitating pansies aren’t they?”
There’d been a buzzing feeling throughout the school, as if the entire castle were vibrating with excitement about the nights activities, it was always like this, and Mycroft had never understood it. He’d ruled it out before as him simply not being the age of which it was relevant. But this leavers party was for him, he was
He knew exactly who to go to.
Because it
“Right again. Ethan,” This was a boy who had been particularly irksome in the previous period, he had a nasty habit of trying to sell cigarettes at lunchtimes, Sherlock hadn't caught him in the act, and the simple fact that the teacher could smell tobacco off him every time he entered the room wasn’t enough for the headmaster. That and he was definitely familiar with ridiculing others. “Square route of twelve.”
“Always with the compliments.” Sherlock gave his signature shit-eating smirk, the one he knew riled John up even further. “How far will it take for you to hit me? I reckon appearance might do it.”
done?” He asked, trying not to sound to outraged. He couldn’t be put in detention for being awake after curfew, because if so then Greg would be too.
"I know."
His eyes traced the way that the suit hugged John's waist and chest, the slight curve in his hips concealed by the suit, it was tailor made, but John would never admit it. The suit was the most expensive article of clothing he owned.
?” John deadpanned. He hadn't done anything wrong in this entire ordeal, as far as everybody was concerned, he was the victim, because he
“Oi!”
“Maybe…”
“Uhm… Thanks.” He spoke after a few moments, voice still soft, but more confident in his words now.
Then he became even more pleased.
John hated that question. He hated thinking about his future. A future that had somewhat been taken from him by wizardry, simply because he sucked major horse cock at wizardry itself. He’d been good at his sciences back in muggle school. He had a plan.
“Wrong.” Sherlock muttered, leaning over John’s shoulder. He pointed to the answer and John was quick to change it. It wasn’t tutoring, they were just being with each other and often times both had homework. John couldn’t bear the thought of Sherlock tutoring him again, not after what he said. “You’re being careless, I know you know this, are you tired?”
Yet Sherlock still knew somehow that John was a
He wished for that a lot, that he’d wake up and he’d be nine years old and his mum would be alive and well, his sister would still be in the honeymoon phase with Clara, and his dad had never laid a hand on him with ill intent.
“You’re learning.” John spoke, a soft smirk on his face and Sherlock rolled his eyes, a gentle hum of acknowledgement in his throat.
Unsure of why John was asking him to do so, he followed the instruction, and the scarf was just as comfortable around his neck as he’d expected. It was safe to say that he was pleased.
“Oh Christ.” Mycroft dropped the umbrella in his hand, and legged it toward him, dropping to his knees beside him and checking his pulse. Greg’s tanned face was splattered with dirt, his expression peaceful as he lay unconscious, which seemed like the biggest irony.
He undid the wrapping with careful fingers. Inside was a white box with a multicoloured cube on it, split into nine cubes visible on each face. It was decorated with a logo that he didn’t recognise, muggle then.
in Mycroft’s embrace, and he was groaning like he was in pain. His arms were wrapped tight around Mycroft’s torso, his forehead resting against the solar plexus as he choked out sobbed breaths. Mycroft simply held him, one hand at his side and the other at the back of his head. The side of his face was pressed against the top of Sherlocks head as though at one point he’d bent to kiss the curls and didn’t move, turning only but to breathe. The scene was quite surreal, considering the most contact he’d ever seen between the Holmes’ brothers was a kick under the table.
that the Gryffindor was referring to. They’d stuck to pretty normal boundaries before then, a clap on the back, a pat on the shoulder, a word of sympathy when something went wrong. Though all of that was mostly on Greg’s part.
He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t hear. He couldn’t think.
John paused for a moment, thinking. Sherlock doubted that using Sarah as leverage would be affective, John had negated speaking about her since he arrived, which Sherlock found curious but he threw that notion away in his persuasion. “Fine, but keep it a secret.” John replied finally, rolling his eyes a little but pushing himself up and rubbing his eyes.
“I was an experiment!?” John asked, outraged, his voice rose in dynamic, fists clenched.
Sinking his head into his knees he sighed. Why was this
“Myc? Is everything alright? Whats wrong?” Greg asked, standing up quickly and placing his hands on the sides of Mycroft's face, which was paler than usual somehow. The Slytherin pulled his hands away put didn’t let go of them, John just about managed to hide his questioning at the interaction.
Then it hit, and his knees went weak, he broke away, his head dropping forward against the taller mans chest. Sherlock held him up by the waist, his other hand still in between Johns legs, as he pulled the orgasm out of him still. He was shaking, convulsing around Sherlocks fingers. The wave of warm pleasure washed over him and he moaned hard into Sherlocks neck, so loud that Mrs Hudson definitely heard it.
She was in his astronomy class and was seemingly infatuated with the muggle study of zodiac signs, apparently hers and Sherlock’s were highly compatible, which was ironic considering that Sherlock didn’t find any romantic compatibility in her character.
John laughed bitterly, trying his best not to scowl. “How can you?”
The main one was just that he felt ugly when he thought about it. He felt even worse when he looked at it. God knows how he would feel to have Sherlock look at it.
Though, he supposed the seeker would never know any of that happened, unless it had happened in the occurrences of which his consciousness had found him.
The cabbie charged them less than the usual fare.  Sherlock smiled softly to himself.
“Don’t be boring John, you’ve got far too much potential to be boring.” Sherlock grumbled, squeezing John closer as if the gesture would shut him up. What it did was constrict John’s arms so the only comfortable place for them was around Sherlock’s waist, so there they resided with no complaints from either boy.
“Yeah I know, nobody normal could deal with you.”
They used to play pirates, it was Sherlock’s favourite, him and Mycroft battling to the death, it used to be with play-swords, then fencing swords, then wands, duelling in the back garden with what little spells they knew.
It wasn’t gentle tears slipping down his face or breaking sobs, it was choking. Each sob sounded painful and tears were cascading down faster than Sherlock had ever seen, dripping onto the floor from his chin.
That’s when it hit him. Rosie could say his name perfectly well, he knew she could, and John only started calling him Lockie after she did, so it wasn’t by his influence.
The Ravenclaw opened the window, allowing the owl inside a moment whilst he read the letter in its grasp.
But of course, it was only the captain that noticed.
“Let him sleep, Anthea. Theres no point risking the trouble.”
“Fantastic.”
He moved schools in September, spoke to the principal his first day, and nobody was any the wiser, as before the first lesson he had, his name was changed on the register.
He nodded in agreement. “Quite.”
“I wouldn’t go near the snapdragon, Gregory.”
“Everything seems to be.”
Sherlock waited for ten minutes, just as he’d done before. Then he got frustrated, shoving his books into his bag and offering a wave and a smile through his frustration at the librarian, before storming out of the library.
John licked his lips and paused for a minute in thought. “I think I believe you.”
When he entered the room, his heart stopped.
"Both sound enticing." Sherlock paused for a moment trying to work out which would be best.
“Yeah, did you end it?” John didn’t respond, and suddenly the cogs started to turn in Greg’s head, with all the different possibilities rushing through it. “Wait, did she end it before you?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes so hard John was surprised they didn’t fall back into his head. “Forgive my mother, John. She’s just quite pleased to be surrounded by her own kind.” He wrinkled his nose in mock disgust before taking a sip of his own drink.
“Sherlock right?” He asked looking down at the boy sitting in the chair.
“A bit yeah.”
His hoodie had ridden up, and Sherlocks arm was warm against his skin, hand limp at the end, his fingertips barely grazing the edge of John’s hips but it was enough to make him squirm.
With a sigh, he climbed up to his own room, to see the unexpectedly obvious. There was John, lying in his bed, his back facing the entrance. He showed no signs of crying, nor sleep. Judging by his posture and position he was upset.
“I'm right behind you.” Sherlock spoke as John legged it out of the living room and up the stairs, bursting into Rosie’s room and turning on the lamp at her bedside table. It casted a warm yellow glow against the walls, revealing the tear stained face of his four-year-old daughter.
“How so?” John asked, eyes encasing Sherlock in an intense gaze.
John laughed again, bitter filled and he cast a jaded glare to the older boy. Mycroft could tell he was getting sick of this, he was slowly shuffling toward the door with each sentence said, and his posture gave him away completely. “No, you don’t. You have no bloody
“Good afternoon.” Afternoon? “How can I help you?”
“I don’t think I’ll be ditching again anytime soon.” He forced a laugh and looked away, avoiding the taller boy’s eyes.
John convulsing around his cock practically dragged the orgasm out of him, and he held the shaking doctor close. Sherlock moaned his name into John's neck, over and over until it didn't sound like a word anymore.
Not wreaking havoc, instead he was crouched by a wall in between the compartments. His head buried in his knees, with dark brown curls hiding his face. He wasn’t crying, he was thinking, panicking.
He knew exactly where and why Greg would be, it was fitting for what was about to happen.
Mycroft nodded a slight sigh falling from his lips. “I noticed.”
That was until, John sprained his arm.
“Very well then.” The professor replied, nodding to the three boys before walking back to the teachers carriage.
“I’d assume once they’re assured you can walk and there aren’t any lasting effects of trauma.”
The first was a letter Professor Flitwick had gotten in his third year, after giving his sister butterfly wings, and locking her in a cupboard to hide her, when he couldn’t change her back.
Greg furrowed his eyebrows. “Uh yeah, why?”
Didn’t he?
Mycroft set his phone down and turned to look at Anthea, she was bare-faced and her hair was pulled into twin braids which was different. “You changed your hair.” He replied, ignoring her query, and went back to staring blankly at his phone screen. “Different style. It looks… Nice.” His voice withered down into a mutter, as a lump stuck in his throat.
Real John said something but he didn’t hear it properly, still transfixed on the reflection. Mirror John was looking at him with a look of pure adoration, he laughed suddenly and stood on his toes to press a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
He half expected Sherlock to come wake him up in the middle of the night and drag him off somewhere ridiculous where he could have a smoke despite John’s protests.
It would’ve been in his first instinct to groan, because most of the racket that came from upstairs was usually completely insane. Once it had been various alarm clocks set to go off one after each other, another time it was tap-dancing, on one occasion it had been gun-shots.
“I’ve had other matters to attend to, namely an annoying younger sibling.” Mycroft replied, his posh London accent a stark contrast to Greg’s cockney drawl. “How was your summer Gregory?” He asked in an attempt to be amiable.
“If you think that’s best, I won’t stop you.” Greg felt daring and pressed a kiss to Mycroft's temple, the Slytherin didn’t object, but he didn’t push it any further.
“That’s easy for you to say.” John replied, as he got out of the car behind Sherlock, shrugging his bag over his shoulder. “You’re used to it. I'm considerably underdressed.” He laughed nervously, running a hand through his hair in the hopes of it looking like less of a tousled mess.
He’d seen the older boy around the castle a few times, usually with his brother or on the quidditch field. Just by studying him for a few moments he’d learned a few things about him. He knew that he was Mycroft’s secret boyfriend and that he was seeker on the Gryffindor quidditch team, he also knew that his first name began with a G, though he never cared enough to remember the rest, and that despite not paying much attention to it, he was quite self-conscious that his hair had gone grey.
Greg turned his head, pressing a gentle kiss to Mycroft’s lips. “Better.”
“I don’t like flying, theres a difference.”
What surprised him was how much it
“I was nine, Mycroft.”
“You’re a wazzock.”
“Something else is wrong, I'm not stupid enough to believe that it’s
“Gregory, go find Professor Flitwick, John and I will explain the situation to the engineer.” Mycroft ordered, John knew very well his calm exterior was a front for all the worry he was trying to conceal.
He didn’t know why but he felt bad almost. That had never happened before. Usually he enjoyed getting people riled up against them when they were being annoying.
“How long have I been out?”
“They help me think.”
Everything he could be thinking about at that moment was gone, his head was filled with TV static and white noise as he spooned cereal into his mouth. He couldn’t taste it, it felt like his entire body had gone numb, like it was on autopilot.
Though he supposed he had nothing to worry about, as by the time he got back downstairs the Gryffindor was having what sounded like a pleasant conversation with his mother. His father was out at work but had ensured Mycroft that he’d be home for dinner in order to meet the boy that had
“Of course you did.” Greg rolled his eyes, shifting his weight from foot-to-foot. “You figure it out?” He asked in earnest, almost like he wished Mycroft had.
The room looked like it had been turned upside-down, and a hurricane had blown through it.
“Right, my turn, here.” Sherlock replied, handing over a package wrapped slightly more neatly, but not by much. “Also eloquent, I’m sure you’ll agree. Though I feel my gift is slightly idiotic now.”
he? He didn’t understand how or why it could be beneficial to him, but there was something dark and sickly stirring in his stomach at the lie he’d told and the image of John’s lips on his cheek. They’d had an incident before, but Sherlock was nearly frozen and didn’t feel anything from it, he couldn’t be sure that John didn’t. It was a mess and his head was spinning. He should tell him. “About the mirror, John- when- When people look into it for too long they go insane, caught up in a desire that can’t be true. So please, and I'm not doing it for meanness sake, once you decide you’re done, don’t ever try to come back here, and please don’t ask me to either. Can you do that for me?”
“What did Sherlock do?”
“That was the point of the exercise, John.” Sherlock gave him a nod. “You don’t like your therapist much do you?”
Greg looked at him in surprise once they emerged from the stands they leave from at the beginning of the match. With a newfound smile on his face, he excused himself from the rest of the group, before running over to Mycroft, retrieved broom in hand.
Comfortable silence swept over the compartment, Mycroft stole the occasional glance at Greg, who didn’t seem to notice, too busy shuffling the deck of muggle playing cards he’d brought with him. Mycroft made a note to ask him to play before they got to Hogwarts.
He appreciated sometimes, that John had not.
“You thought it loud enough for kings-cross to hear.” She replied with an eyeroll. “You can’t control his every move, no matter how much you try to.”
“Boring.”
“This is ridiculous.” John laughed, still crying but he was smiling a bit more now. “Manic even.”
She squealed when she saw Sherlock standing outside the café, underneath the awning, and ran to hug him. He stumbled back a bit on impact, his hand finding her head, the hug a bit awkward. Considering Rosie’s head just about reached his stomach. “Mr Holmes! We’re here for lunch!” She told him, practically vibrating with excitement where she stood, John caught up to him behind her and offered the taller man a nod and a smile, which to his surprise was politely returned.
“And if things
“I’ll date you.”
That was one of the most awful things he’d ever had to do in his life.
"You're gonna tell me that it was just adrenaline. The suit. I looked more masculine than usual, I looked attractive to you for once, and it drove you to this. Now you're done, you're gonna get up and go on with your day. And its fine, I know its fine."  John replied, his voice was quiet, almost a whisper. It didn't take a genius to realise that it
“Yeah, tall dude, big nose, Slytherin? Cornered me in the middle of the night saying you needed to catch up on notes to stay in our potions class.”
Mycroft stood in the cold, amongst the bustling students in the raised bleachers, anticipating the war between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor that was about to take place on the quidditch field. The crowd he was swarmed by had his anxiety racing, but he braced himself against the front barrier and tried to steady his breathing, because he wasn’t here by choice, he was here for Greg. What concerned him most was that whilst he was here because he owed the Gryffindor, he also
“Doubt it. I’ll get that for you two.”
“What did you do.” John didn’t offer him any sign of reply, he didn’t think that talking about it would do any more than spread a nasty rumour. The first about him and another one to add for Sherlock. “Oh, come on John, you can’t tell a guy something like that and then not explain
Sherlock made a conscious effort to pull John’s arm from behind his head and place it in his own hair. John rolled his eyes but ran his hand through the curls anyway. For a man who refused to eat for fear of wasting time, his hair was impeccably soft, somehow. “You’ve never considered surgery?” He asked.
“Tried to ignore it, mostly. Didn’t like paying attention to the fact you were ignoring me.” Greg winced noticing the pain Mycroft tried his best to keep out of his tone, to no avail.
“John calm down.” Sherlock replied coolly, cutting him off.
He knew for a fact Harry would use his birthname.
“So, what now then?” Her tone was impatient now, like he’d done something to annoy her.
“Liar.”
John’s eyes widened almost comically. “That’s… Extraordinary.” John breathed, he didn’t try to poke fun or accuse Sherlock of gloating or be defensive as if Sherlock said he was inferior (he was but that didn’t matter at the moment), but rather chose to be impressed
“Psycho…” Anderson muttered under his breath when Sherlock turned his back.
“Despite my disregard for human sensation, I do enjoy things that feel pleasant.” Sherlock replied, his voice a low murmur. “Including this, I like this, it’s nice.” He added. “Are you feeling any better?”
“Not too far off. But incorrect.” Sherlock replied, a fond smile written in his features. “Open it.”
A sly smirk crossed Sherlock’s mouth, as he gave a pale green stare to the elder. “Do yourself a favour and stop talking.” John elbowed him and Mycroft smiled inwardly.
He studied John’s face in concern, trying to find any traces of lying, certain that this couldn’t be real. “And you don’t mind that I’m- That I’m not- That I don’t necessarily experience things in the same ways you may be used to?” He asked, somewhat desperate for the dream to shatter, scared of what might come after if it continued, panic jolting through his veins at all the potential consequences.
Considering Sherlock had considered himself asexual from age eighteen, given the sort-of-black ring he wore, he would’ve thought that John killing a man for him would’ve done something.
“That’s a fractured wrist.” Mycroft muttered to himself, almost in amusement, as he got up from the stands, trying his best to avoid the crowds in order to find his friend.
“Well unless you want him smelling like dirt and sweat, it’ll have to be two, mate.”
Class with Sherlock was everything he’d thought it would be, busy, difficult, annoying. Sherlock had two modes of being, either silent or blathering like he’d never stop.
John had always been quite thoughtful, never in the right places if he was honest. He used his heart for a lot of things except his casting and writing. Those were the things he used his head for, even though he probably shouldn’t.
So obviously Mycroft was going with him to give him an excuse to be there.
"God you're tight. I'm close. You're getting there, correct?" Sherlock asked, feeling John tighten around him.
“Because there’s no fun in that.” He laughed, fading back into the crowd of people walking into the castle.
Greg gave another nervous laugh. He was so used to Mycroft knowing everything, handling it all himself, it was a surprising change when he had to take control, and lead Mycroft through something instead. “Slightly yeah, considering it’s been quite a while, I mean, we love each other right?”
“Firstly, we’re friends?” He looked pleased and it took everything Mycroft had in his body not to smile.
“God no.” He’d laughed in response, before he turned the book around to sherlock like he usually did, pointing out the part he’d struggled with, and been too embarrassed to ask McGonagall about.
Sherlock spoke after a moment of comfortable silence. “He didn’t mean to upset you, after you left he looked almost guilty. If I'm right he’ll be up any minute to give you his apology.”
“What’s wrong with me? No, what’s wrong with you!?” Greg replied angrily, shoving the prefect back. “It took me two years to get any fucking semblance of human kindness from you, you barely even smile when we hang out, but some bloody bartender gets better treatment. You
“There are other ways to let him know you care.”
“You gonna come to bed? Greg asked from down the hall.
“For a whole two lessons? Try something more believable, or at least less embarrassing.” Sherlock piped up and John glared at him, he glared straight back, it was Johns fault he was here, if the Gryffindor had been with him than Anderson wouldn’t have even glanced their way. John was short but he could be scary. “Yes, I'm fine, if fine counts a concussion.
He’d planned to live life at Hogwarts as close to home as he could, alone, head down, working hard. Years filled with sleepless nights, not for cramming but filled with boredom, boredom wandering through his mind palace in the dead of night, rearranging new information, digging up old stuff, running to the bees for some sort of comfort when everything became too much. Too loud. Too overcrowded.
“I’m sorry for not saying anything. I didn’t realise the severity of the situation.” He replied, trying not to let on how much he was enjoying the level of affection that drunk Greg always displayed.
before but that was usually when he was in the middle of a panic attack and was switching back and forth between hypersensitivity and numbness.
“I could’ve been a half-blood.”
“I’m happy for you.” John replied, his smile was genuine but his mind was still swirling.
“There’s every point if you’ll stop worrying.” She quipped back and he let out an exasperated sigh, her persistence could be just as aggravating as potentially helpful.
John licked his lips, unfurrowing his brow. “Slightly, I suppose. Why a gay couple specifically, why not just mates?”
“Uhm, yeah, I supposed you knew that though. I know you don’t like Christmas, all that bollocks about materialism and corruptness. But we have different culture I guess, and I would’ve felt awful if I hadn’t.” John replied honestly, trying not to notice his face heating up as Sherlock’s green-glacier irises stabbed through his own. Realising Sherlock wasn’t going to respond, he pushed himself up, going for his bag and bringing out a messily wrapped box, with a Tesco bought premade bow stuck on top.
In his house you were lucky to get fed, never mind eat at the table.
He knew this feeling.
“Yeah, it does.”
Thank you!
“I don’t know, I don’t dance.”
He had a question to ask, and he knew only one person who had a hope of knowing the answer.
They gave him a few strange looks, he was taller than most of them but undoubtedly weighed less, whether that was from lack of appetite or fast metabolism, nobody knew.
The Ravenclaw shrugged again, nodding. “Yeah, she had dirt on all her friends, gets close enough for secrets and then makes them do her bidding. Manipulated them. Learned from the best.”
John often insisted on dragging Sherlock to bed when the detective just
“You could be a certified mind reader, and nobody would know the difference.”
Greg laughed, suddenly. “god we are some miserable sops, how about a more light-hearted topic then? How’s your family?”
Mycroft could see the terror radiate through his body as he realised he’d lost sigh of the snitch. Quickly his eyes darted around the field, not to find the snitch, but to find the other seeker. The Hufflepuff hadn’t seen it either, and Greg took a breath, before flying higher to survey the field.
John was too wrapped up in his own joy that he didn’t notice when Sherlock’s untucked shirt rode up and his ribs were almost painfully visible.
“He’s all we have, Harry, we have each other and we have dad. I'm
This was going to be a long process.
“You know Mycroft? He’s a prefect in Slytherin.” John caught on remembering vaguely the looming ginger figure that seemed to avoid the rules yet simultaneously abide them to the letter. He nodded, gesturing for Mike to continue. “He’s a Holmes as well, they’re brothers, not that they look it. Suppose strange names are a family trait.”
He’d never told anybody about his mum before, not his muggle friends, not his wizard friends, not even Harry. Saying the words hurt his throat but he forced them out anyway, if he was going to be Sherlock’s friend, if Sherlock was going to be his friend, then that meant Sherlock shouldn’t just be guessing everything about him. John needed to tell him some things.
John dropped his shoulders and simply stared at her. She wasn’t making any logical point and he was getting annoyed now. “Okay now you aren’t making any sense.”
“Then don’t say no.”
John took in a breath, trying to keep his cool, he didn’t want to panic, and he didn’t want to get angry, the most he could do was stand there and act like he was fine, and not freaking out in a locked room with a skilled wizard who could easily do anything to him. “So, what about him?”
” He took in a deep breath, glancing back to the mirror. “
“Set it free like a wild bird.”
“Sherlock Holmes. No need for the apology, its quite alright.” Sherlock replied, hiding a soft smile with his mug as he took a sip. “Insomnia is it? Or PTSD.”
Rocketing through his head.
“The love potion?” John paused looking at her, arms halfway into his favourite jumper.
“Shut up.” John laughed as he opened it at the end, sliding the book out into his hands. He froze as he held it. The delicately drawn cover staring back at him, watercolour fields with flowers and children. “You remembered?” He asked quietly, as he carefully opened the book, gently flicking through the pages as he skimmed over the words already familiar to him.
At first it bothered him, irritated him to the point where sometimes he ignored John. Now, after months of them dating, he stopped viewing it as a mystery.
“Five-hundred-and-twenty-thousand approximately, not counting spelling differentiations, and it was an educated one.” He replied, sitting up properly, intrigued.
“How long have I been here?” The was definite fear in his voice, his hand and body tensing, shuffling the sheets a little, so Mycroft knew without even looking.
I honestly dont know how good this is but whatever, exciting things are to come
time I will have to deal with the loss of a… Friend, I suppose.”
John wasn’t going home, obviously, Sherlock didn’t
“Let’s get down to business.” Sherlock began, turning the book around to point to what John needed to see. Before he could continue John cut him off in what he thought was supposed to be whispered singing.
“You should be.” Sherlock deadpanned, and John felt his stomach drop, before Sherlock added more to the sentence. “I was scared out of my mind when you weren’t at the library.”
John furrowed his brow, eyes flickering to the pieces of parchment on the table. “What about them?”
“You didn’t.”
“He set this up, god knows why.” Sherlock knew exactly why, he just didn’t want to admit it. “I was told I was helping you with transfiguration.”
“No,” He squeezed Mycroft's hand to make his point. “But she’s gonna think, maybe gossip.”
“Say what?” He asked bluntly instead, hoping to get away with it.
“I'm glad you are. Rosie adores you.”
But when he finally got seated at his usual spot at the Gryffindor table, he did not expect Gregory Lestrade to sit down, acting as if everything was perfectly normal, with striking locks of black hair on his head.
Sherlock gave up, and hung up with a frustrated huff, tossing his phone over onto the table from where he was lying on the sofa. He clearly wasn’t going to get much help from his brother, in all honesty he wasn’t sure why he thought he would. Though that point about his name was a good shout, it wasn’t like he could ask John what his name was, or where it was for that matter.
“A little warning would’ve been nice.” John replied, reaching a hand up to run it through Sherlock’s hair, he sighed contentedly in response as the shorter boy traced softly into his scalp.
“What else? He drives me mad.” John replied, laughing gently, resting his chin on his hands as he held himself up on the cue. Watching fondly as Sherlock frowned, forced to pick up eight cards in one sitting. “But he’s all I have, so I make do.”
Anderson laughed, handing his cards back to Greg. “Sounds boring, no offence.”
He hadn't seen sherlock outside of lessons and tutoring for a while, the Ravenclaw seemed to have stopped attending meals. He had missed Sherlock completely for the week they got flooded with exams.
Sherlock wasn’t the most knowledgeable about the ins and outs of relationships, but he knew that a lot more effort was required in a romantic one than there was in a friendship. For most people he wasn’t willing to put in that amount of effort, hence why he’d never even tried anything with Molly Hooper, but for John? For John he was willing. But still unsure as to why.
Sherlock looked out the window before John prodded him in the ribs, handing him the cube back, thoroughly mixed.
“What, Sherlock?”
It had a picture of a festive looking quidditch player with reindeer antlers, of whom he didn’t know the same. He recognised him though, he was the keeper off the Irish team, his trick was distracting the other players because he was a metamorphagus. Suddenly the antlers changed, and his hair and face turned white as his nose became orange and pointed, like a snowman. John smiled and flipped the card over to read what was written.
“I h-h-had a bad d-dream!” Rosie stammered, breaking into further sobs, John pushed himself up onto her bed, bringing her into his lap as she cried, rubbing her back in an attempt to soothe her.
“What I said, on- on the last day, I’m sorry.” John replied a slight stutter to his voice, he was nervous.
John met him with a hug, John never usually hugged him off his on volition, the last time was after he dropped Rosie of at her first day of nursery.
“Stupid.” He muttered to himself, he could hardly rely on Mycroft for
“Brilliant.” Sherlock replied, leaning in to kiss him.
The Slytherin nearly cried out in horror as a bludger came just shy of knocking Greg off his broom. Even he was shocked by that reaction, but shook it off just as Greg did, and recalibrated his entire body before he refocused.
“Bite me, Holmes
Despite their utter disinterest in him, John had still sent a card to his dad and his sister wishing them happy holidays, and he was quite excited about his gift for Sherlock.
And then it was silent, his vision cleared, and he could breath again, John staring at him, with his eyes filled with something other than lust. Sherlock knew exactly what it was and his hear shattered when it faded from view.
Now people were starting to mumble, Sherlock didn’t care, still staring straight ahead. Mycroft didn’t either, staring straight at Sherlock. He ignored the whispers directed to him from those at his table. He ignored the mutterings from the other tables, wondering why it was taking so long for the hat to decide.
“I don’t have it.” Sherlock spoke pointedly.
“Are you serious? Quidditch is the only thing I can do
Scared of what would happen if he did lose John. If he lost John before knowing what name was on his skin.
Johns head snapped up his eyes filled with surprise and moderate delight. “Do- uh- Do you want to be? M-My boyfriend I mean.”
secret.”
“Sort of the opposite.” John replied, his tone unchanging, his voice was filled with tears but his expression was neutral.
He knew what the injury would be before it had happened. Harry dislocated her shoulder once, she’d fallen down the stairs drunk and knocked it out of place. He was terrified when it happened, he’d had to set it for her. (“You want to be a doctor, don’t you Johnny? Give us a hand then.” Though it was to avoid the hospital fee.)
“This might feel a bit weird, just bear with me.” The Gryffindor spoke softly, and the younger boy gave a small nod, carefully he brushed back Sherlock’s curls with gentle fingers, using his other hand he put one earbud in. “Tell me if anything gets too much.” He added, repeating the same action for the other side, he felt like each sentence should be followed with a pet-name,
“You’re stressing Myc. I can see it, you do this every time. You work yourself up to a level even I can’t achieve. It’s summer, you’ve been revising since god knows when this morning, these aren’t even your final NEWTs, they’re predictive grades, mate. Just lie back and enjoy the weather alright?” His eyes were comforting, warm and welcoming, and the sincerity of his tone was enough to break the elder Holmes.
“You know if I get the surgery you won’t be able to do it anymore.” John replied, setting the paper down and standing up.
Sure enough, when he lifted his head, and cracked his back, there he was. He was sitting in his chair, his laptop in front of him, with far too many of the letter h typed into his blog.
“She saw us hand-holding again then.”
“It’s a surprise darling.”
“Still a weirdo.”
“No, John and I were looking for him.”
“John.” He spoke trying to catch his attention, trying to buy himself some time before he actually had to offer some comforting words.
Rolling his eyes at himself he sighed out again, taking a deep breath in before breathing it out slowly. “Well maybe I don’t have to silence my mind palace anymore. I suppose there are benefits, looking on the bright side and all that.” He laughed at that, to himself. John would’ve laughed at it, his uncommon usage of typical adages.
John followed a little unsure.
Sherlock broke his stare against the back wall, glancing at Mycroft immediately. Mycroft smiled at him, nodding in some form of brotherly approval.
“I wouldn’t be too excited, I had to guess considering I could ask for your measurements, it mayn’t fit. It’s hardly special, more out of concern, because the way you’re currently binding is unsafe.”
“Go, have fun, not too much though.”
“Out of the way, Mr. Holmes, this boy needs immediate medical attention.” McGonagall’s voice came piercing behind him, and he moved out of the way, as much as he could, whilst still able to keep Greg’s hand in his.
But this was far more exciting. His eyes drew their way down John's body, studying how he moved, his facial expressions depending on how hard he thrusted into him. John gripped Sherlock's wrist, his fingers pressing so hard against the skin it might bruise.
The moment he and Greg walked into his house for dinner with the family and John, Mycroft knew something was off.
This time it was different. It was soft and melodic.
They called Mycroft that too didn’t they?
A small gasp left his lips and Sherlock tried to look and see what he was looking at, but to no avail, John was at an angle that he couldn’t see.
John saw straight through the distraction, Sherlock had taught him
Sherlock flipped it around in his hands, scanning over it, the engraving catching his eye
The taller man didn’t respond, instead pressing his face against the top of John’s head, his arm placed gingerly against his waist. The way Johns shoulders relaxed, told him it was okay, and he pulled the shorter man against him in a proper hug.
She laughed pulling away after the brief embrace. “Get over yourself, I know your heart better than you do. Go get ‘em Boss. Just promise me one thing?”
His mind had been a bit wavy since Sherlock had shown him the mirror, but true to his word he had never even attempted to think about where the mirror was. Okay, maybe the thought had crossed his mind, but he’d made a promise to his friend and he was a man of his word.  His head was fuzzy, and his focus was gone.
“What’s wrong?”
Nothing was going well for John Watson that day.
It was a stethoscope.
friend.
and I was upset and like- embarrassed I suppose, I don’t know. A-and she was
The panic set in once again, heart beat quickened, breathing difficult, hands shaking so badly he could barely control them. He clocked it all at once, they were the symptoms, it was happening again, and he’d sprinted.
In response John just pulled him closer and he smiled softly to himself, leaning back against the doctor. His bed was a lot colder when he was the only one in it.
.” Anthea added before Irene could speak. “You do not want to anger the Head Boy, he knows more about you than you’d think.”
Only after undoing his trousers one-handedly and managing to get his jumper and his shirt off likewise, it hit him.
Mycroft woke up to tension in his left hand, something against it, warm and tightening every now and then.
“Now?”
Sherlock seemed to unfreeze after that, clicking into motion, hands working as he spoke, waving through the air like some sort of unseen dance.
“I'm not dead.” Sherlock replied, once John had removed himself from a close proximity, keeping his eyes shut
John shook his head quickly. Sarah didn’t deserve that, just because he didn’t want to admit he wasn’t okay, shouldn’t cost her position on the team. “No! Its not her, honest, I just-“ This was Greg. Greg was his friend, as strange as that was, the seventh year had never looked down on him. “I can’t fucking sleep, I can’t shut my head off…”
Mycroft looked like he’d just been slapped with a banana, slightly upset, and moderately confused.
Sherlock’s eyes widened for a second after he realised. He was
Mycroft wasn’t about to feed him any bullshit, so if he’d been lying to himself that they were in love that lie was about to be shattered, obliterated into tiny, sharp pieces.
John laughed. “What could’ve given that away? The lack of choice or the charm on the door?” If he could make a joke out of it maybe he wouldn’t feel so threatened. It wasn’t like Mycroft was actually going to do anything to him, right?
“You’re a fucking idiot, Gregory, I thought you were going to die.” He breathed, as Greg dropped his broom, and wrapped his arms around the Slytherin’s waist, his chin rested on Mycroft’s shoulder as he squeezed the Slytherin back with just as much force.
away from them!” He could feel everything building up, and swallowed in the hopes to force down all his anger and upset. “Fuck you, Sarah,” His voice broke into a whisper.  “It’s no wonder you don’t have any friends.”
In lessons he was doing fairly but he’d stopped socialising with anyone really. It was the result of his avoiding Sarah. The only time he’d seen her was at try-out’s in the very beginning of the year and even then he felt too sick with guilt to even stay and talk.
Mycroft's heart was still in his throat.
Though the team meeting consisted of playing a broom version of tag, and having a Christmas picnic in the quidditch stands.
“So does Sherlock, seemingly.” He’d muttered in response, secretly quite pleased that his brother had somebody to look after him, despite how imbecilic he was in reality.
“My brother is still in the castle. If there was any other way we would use it but since the barrier was re-established, there isn’t.” John simply stared as a strange adult authority took over Mycroft's voice, almost like he was just as much the boss of the engineer as his actual boss was.
Sherlock replied, sitting up and matching John’s vocal level.
idea.” The door was unlocked when he tried the handle and he walked immediately to Sherlock’s room.
He didn’t regret it though, Greg could’ve seriously hurt himself had John not grabbed him. He was lucky the snitch was above the nets in the first place.
She let out a hum of a laugh, and moved to sit opposite him at the table, lighting a candle with the flick of her wand to fill the room with dim light. He didn’t doubt that he was the only person aside from her family that had seen her without makeup. “Irene did them. Answer my question Mycroft.” She snatched the phone from him, forcing him to engage in some sort of interaction with her. He could’ve smiled at that, had he ever done the same she would’ve broken his hand, he learned early on that nobody touches her Blackberry without permission or at all.
“Andrew.” Rosie corrected, taking the note off him “Thanks Lock!” She stood on her toes to kiss him on the cheek, a habit she’d developed, considering he wasn’t too fussed on a lot of contact without warning. “Bye dad.” She gave John a quick side hug before heading out the door.
John had gone with him to the meeting with the headmaster, Professor Sprout and Professor Flitwick. Despite his nerves he managed to keep his voice steady and stick up for his friend when needed. In the end no clear resolution was found, except Sherlock being kept in solitary confinement for the night, and until the issue had been resolved.
“Don’t say anything yet, put it on and tie it how you usually do.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes with a dramatic sigh and dragged himself over to put his foot through the filing cabinet again, eighteen times may be a new record. “No, try again.”
His hair was still damp which meant he’d just come from quidditch practice, and he had brought a worn looking leather messenger bag.
"Nice of you to join us." He spoke, nodding at Sherlock.
The day before last, where the leavers would celebrate and the teachers would pretend not to notice the younger students that sneaked their way into the celebration, nor the elders drinking fire-whiskey, Greg cornered him in the library.
He managed to form his school scarf into a makeshift sling before slipping down the stairs to the bathroom, locking the door behind him, and opening the window. He’d had to sneak out a dozen times before, but never with injuries as bad as this. He pushed his trunk out first, and then his back pack, before standing on the cistern and using his working arm as leverage.
“You’re a right git.”
“A bit yeah, why?” He replied as Mycroft stood up.
This was the day he would speak to his neighbour. And thank them for their playing, it was the thing that had lulled him into unconsciousness.
“Well done, that was quite…” He’d never really given many compliments, but he knew the one thing he always liked to hear. “Uh, quite brilliant.”
He went to reply but Sherlock was quicker. “I have just the cure for bad dreams you know.” He said, his voice taking on that of a story teller, every time he read a book to her, or spoke to her in general, more life found his voice than even a deduction would elicit.
John was out of his mind worrying about his friend, Sherlock seemed to be partaking in his own silent protest by starving himself, John could see it, the Ravenclaw had always been skinny, but now there was practically nothing. John couldn’t make him do anything, nobody could, so all he could do was stress and fret and try his hardest not to cry.
“I need both of them to do the shot and I can’t pull it out either.” John replied if a little exasperatedly, he knew that Sherlock knew exactly why he’d called him here and yet this was the one time he chose to lay back from acting on his deductions. “Look, I need you to help me. It’s already in you just need to push the plunger and take it out, you’ve had enough experience with needles to know how.” He added, his words carrying more bite than he intended but Sherlock didn’t look phased.
“You can’t?”
“You’re the only person who calls me Myc, consider us even.” The prefect replied, and Greg squeezed his hand, Mycroft knew he’d be smiling in that moment. Despite the fact he claimed otherwise, the nickname had started to grow on him, though he wasn’t sure if it was because he was gradually liking the name itself, or Greg more as time moved on.
He got four laps of the room in, his cane thudding against the ground with every step he took, he was thankful he lived in the ground flat or he’d feel guilty every time this happened. Four laps, to one side and back, before something began upstairs.
“How did you know about that?” He asked, the tunnel was dark, and too small for them to walk side by side. He could just about make out John extending his hand back for him to grab, like he was a child the Gryffindor was afraid of losing.
Sherlock laughed.
And if the elder Holmes was right, John would be gone before Sherlock could find out if the name the doctor had was William.
Sherlock stood a few feet back, in a way that he could see John’s face enough to read his expression but wouldn’t be in John’s view of the mirror.
The words fell from his lips and as Sherlock registered them John's own eyes went wide along with his, but Sherlock blinded by his own fury at the statement didn't notice, and braced himself for the incoming barrage of insults just raring to force themselves out of his mouth. He closed his eyes trying to keep the lock shut around his emotions. He wouldn't cry. He didn't care. He'd heard it all before and hearing it from John
It made sense now, and Greg ran a hand through Mycroft's hair, ignoring the few tears that slipped down his cheeks
"John I-"
A full on panic set into his bones once he stepped off the train, trunk in fist, he didn’t have the first clue of where to look but after standing in the middle of the platform glancing around him and the ruckus of the crowd blending into nothing, he noticed a pop of strawberry blonde and an umbrella and sprinted after it, ducking and dodging people walking in all directions.
That was just how Sherlock worked. Considering that the Ravenclaw was his closest friend, he’d just decided that accepting the few flaws was the easiest way around them.
certainly don’t sit this close together, wouldn’t you say?”
Obviously Greg didn’t encourage him breaking the rules, but if something was so vital that he had to swear to secrecy especially in regards to Mycroft, he supposed he could let it slide.
John was out like a light.
John didn’t seem to think so, as not even thirty seconds later he had taken the needle off with a shaky hand, and had returned it to grip the desk alongside the other.
Sherlock gave him a gentle smile, he could feel that same interestingly warm feeling that he got when he first told John he liked him. “It’s fantastic, John. Now please tell me I can give you mine? Or do you have another five presents shoved up your jumper?” He raised a brow and John grinned back at him, rolling his eyes.
Greg squeezed his hand, and shortly after began to rub gentle strokes over Mycroft’s thumb. “That’s fair.”
John pressed a quick and discreet kiss to the corner of his mouth, Sherlock didn’t resist, and as much as he knew he’d get the ridicule from his class, he appreciated that John wasn’t ashamed of him. “Thatta boy, I love you too.” John replied, smiling at him and offering him a wink.
“Yes, most people are usually alarmed. The whereabouts of my tattoo is simply convenient, two birds one stone, isn’t that the saying?” Sherlock replied, looking up to the shorter man, leaning against the table.
It was a rather odd feeling, considering the younger boy was shirtless under his open dressing gown, but John wasn’t about to move him. It could risk making everything worse.
“Don’t insult me, of course it’s not.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, not in a mean way, and John shook his head in response.
“Because it usually
“Oh, shut up, I was trying to be romantic.”
This chapter is very john centric because I find him far easier to write. but next chapter should have a bit more equality of the four characters in it. it's also gonna be a wild ride so buckle in
Mycroft allowed himself to smile properly, relieved that Greg was alright, that he’d woken in the first place. “You’re welcome.”
Sherlock was up by the time he came back in, rinsing his and John’s mugs in the sink, setting them on the draining board. John noticed, and grabbed a dish-towel, picking up the mugs to dry them. “I think that’s the first time you’ve washed a cup on your own accord.” He giggled, stretching up to put the mugs on the top shelf.
He guessed correctly. The scarf was made up of blue and silver stripes, it was sleek and soft to the touch, and it was tightly stitched, it barely even looked knitted, but it was, the way he preferred.
“Doesn’t good ol’ Severus love you though? You’re like the best in his class,
“Because I'm not guilty.” Sherlock replied, stopping John from moving by gripping his shoulders, grounding him and hoping to silence the panic he could practically see building in his friend.
“So whats your game plan?”
“Not in the slightest, brother mine. Ravenclaw suits you. Mummy will be sure to send you a scarf in the post.” He tried not to smile at the small look of joy that took over Sherlocks face at the idea. Silence overcame them, as they walked side by side, before they reached the door to the Ravenclaw commons. Mycroft turned to face the younger boy, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Try not to immediately get expelled, come to me if you’re considering, and the boy you were staring at is John Watson.”
The fourth year shoved him, scrunching up his face in disgust. “That a sick image, spare me the details.” Greg winked at him and he rolled his eyes.
Sherlock had anticipating this happening.
“That I needed a moment.”
“You son of a bitch! You spread rumours about me, and all my friends hate me.”
Greg opened the door to his apartment, it was open, meaning Mycroft was here, and he smiled softly as he hung up his coat and his bag, tossing his keys into a bowl on the sideboard in the hall. Once the extra weight was off his shoulders, he stretched back, wincing as his back cracked. He was nineteen for Christ’s sake.
And a second kiss to the side of his face was given, in the dimly lit quidditch stand.
“’S not your fault, isn’ like you gave him it. Shouldn’t have happened at all whether you knew or not.” Greg murmured as they walked into the block of flats, he stumbled into the lift, and pressed the button of his floor, jabbing it repeatedly like a child, with a giddy smile on his face.
“She got in a row with her best mate, the Ravenclaw chaser, Mary I think? They’re not friends anymore so she came and told me, scared the living daylights out of me when I saw her in the boys changing rooms.” John replied, managing a laugh.
They’d allowed Mycroft in because he was his brother, he couldn’t be certain that they’d let John in too on the off chance that he’d make things worse instead of better. “Lockie, I don’t know if I-“
“I don’t know.”
John naturally stood with his legs pressed together, despite the fact that he sat with his legs spread. At first it was presumable but that was due to his army background, his posture, apart from the limp, was rigid and proper. That was until John focused on Sherlock more and deliberately adjusted his stance to match. He still had that habit, though he'd become more conscious about it.
“It was quite enjoyable.”
“That’s good, the ducks can process that a lot easier.” Sherlock replied, and Rosie offered him a pleased smile.
Sherlock glanced at him with a smirk. “He doesn’t work on Fridays.”
Carefully Mycroft set down the puzzle and looked at him. His icy stare was enough to make Greg’s heart thump up to his throat. “Pardon?” He asked.
Once the sweetcorn was gone, thrown about across the paths, being steadily consumed by ducks and whatever other birds came along, John grabbed Rosie’s hand to walk to the address Sherlock had texted him not long after.
There was a moment of silence. That moment felt like years to Sherlock, who was left feeling very vulnerable.
Abruptly, the spinning stopped, and Greg tipped his head back to swallow the rest of his drink before replying. “No, I don’t, I’ll cause one outside, come on.” He ordered, standing up and storming out of the pub, Mycroft rolled his eyes, letting out an exasperated sigh before following after him. He chased the Gryffindor up the abandoned path toward the shrieking shack, until he caught up and spun him round by the shoulder to face him.
“Damn straight.”
John’s nightmares were getting worse.
They’d agreed to sit beside each other at breakfast, and exchange gifts in the Ravenclaw commons once everyone was out for the annual snowball fight. John hadn’t enjoyed it last year and didn’t plan on going, and Sherlock was completely disinterested by the idea. So, they figured it the perfect opportunity.
“I’ll be back for Christmas day.”
“Wait.” Mycroft replied simply. “Try and get Sherlock out, even if its just for a walk. He’ll go mad trapped in there.”
The Gryffindor was staring like he was in a trance, eyes trained to the mirror. “I don’t- How did you- What is this?” He spoke, turning his head, eyes wide in fear, disbelief, and he turned to look behind him, then back to the mirror.
They didn’t do much flying, more giggling and chatting and moaning about the bores of school life and Sarah. Too much chatter about Sarah. Sherlock almost always managed to change the subject after the sickness in his stomach began to rise.
Anthea looked at him concerned, he was breathing quickly and heavily, and his face was paler than usual if that was possible. “Boss, you aright? You don’t look too great…”
Him? Hurting Sherlock Holmes? What a mother-fucking-load-of-bollocks.
Mycroft's face twisted into confusion. “He wasn’t with you?”
“And seemingly negated manners.”
“Don’t you at least want me to fix it?” Mycroft wasn’t a healer by any means but he was a good wizard, John was an amateur healer at best.
him?”
John didn’t realise that he was important.
Greg looked for some small gifts for the quidditch team whilst they were there, he wasn’t stupid enough to try to buy Mycroft anything when the prefect was with him. Mycroft would manage to sneakily buy Greg something, however, and he’d probably get Anthea something too while he was at it. She was the only other person he tolerated, save from his brother on occasion and Greg. Despite her insipid texting, when she actually got into the conversation she could be quite funny, and her sense of humour wasn’t anything shy of dark. Besides, he owed her something for helping him get intel around the castle, she had a connection with practically every muggle-born and half-blood that owned a phone.
It was believable enough to make him wake up breathless and terrified.
“Sherlock knows everything.” He replied adamantly.
Sherlock didn’t agree with any of that, considering that aromantics still had soulmates, as did asexuals, and there was the rare case of the lesbians whose soul mates were gay men and they were platonically bonded.
doing.
“Sleep well?” Sherlock asked, flicking the kettle on, going back to staring at his microscope.
Sherlock opened his eyes. “What are you doing here?”
“Sherlock’s doing, I imagine, off to the hall there should be action.” John looked at him confused, well Mycroft assumed it was confusion, the human face was more difficult to read upside down. He sighed before speaking again. “Greg is rather good you know, but we really have to go, food to eat, people to greet and mischief head to toe.”
He didn’t hear Sherlock laugh often, nothing ever seemed to amuse him enough to laugh properly.
He didn’t question it the first time. He figured it would take a minute to settle in that John no longer needed him to help.
“Whats happened John?” She asked, immediate worry setting into her voice.
At last the door opened slowly, Sherlock standing in his dressing gown and his clothes from last night, minus the blazer and his shoes. “Is that?..” He didn’t finish his sentence, his eyes trained to the needle in John’s leg.
There were a few passing beats of silence, in which Mycroft placed his hand on top of Greg’s ever so slightly, smiling softly up at the sky as the Gryffindor took his hand properly, interlocking their fingers.
John ran a nervous hand through his hair. “We can’t, I’ve been too many times, they’ll lock him up and I- I can’t-“
His mind was slightly more at ease, having waved Sherlock off as he got in their family’s care and drove off to the country where he lived.
“I feel a bit better.” John shrugged.
when needed and having it feel dirty coming out of your mouth. I guess I thought, I dunno, because it’s
a first.”
He could hear Mycroft's voice, slightly muffled, but he was speaking loud and with enough exasperation that Greg could hear.
John looked at him, eyebrows furrowed as he tried to structure either a way to get out of it, or a way to reply. “Well it’s embarrassing isn’t it?” It was taking every ounce of nerve in his body to prevent himself from crying, he was fed up at this point.
“Perhaps we are more than friends.”
The first few minutes were filled with comfortable silence.
Sherlock knew it was reasonable.
“Indeed.”
What had he done?
“No.”
“Has what bad?”
Sherlock managed not to grin as she dropped John’s hand and went a brilliant shade of pink in embarrassment. “O-Oh, uhm, I-“ She stammered as John furrowed his brow, partially in annoyance with Sherlock but partially in confusion with Sarah.
if that helps.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, allowing silence, save for the bustling of trolleys and chatter from other visitors, to engulf the room.
John cut him off before he could continue, he could see the anxiety building up in Sherlock, the faster he spoke. “I never said that.” His reply was quick, and Sherlock turned to look at him, expression confused.
He didn’t really see the point. He knew John, after that first night, he knew what the man was capable of and what he wasn’t. It didn’t seem any nicer to ease him than to throw him in head first considering he’s shot a man dead to stop Sherlock making a stupid decision.
John rolled his eyes but nodded to reciprocate the sentiment. “Cheers, Dimmock.”
He didn’t need the laptop now anyway, he was done with his search now, all he had to do was text Lestrade, take the lecture about taking case files and then he could continue fine with his experiment.
“Duh, if you’ll be dancing with Sarah you’ll need to know how to lead.”
John managed to pick up his shoes with shaky hands. “I was thinking about breaking up with her.” He spoke, not really to the girl but to himself, still in a state of shock.
Valentines day was in two days, John had been given a few letters, but he either didn’t know who’d sent them, or didn’t like who’d sent them, and hadn't responded. One of the worst parts of being on the quidditch team, as John had told him one day after practice, was that your name got yelled out for everyone to hear, everyone who came to watch suddenly knew who you were.
He supposed that was one of the things that got to her most about not having a mum. She didn’t really mind overall, but it was the little things that John didn’t do for her without having to be told. He’d looked at books about being a single dad, but it was a load of tripe in his opinion.
Once he had everything in hand, he sprinted. He didn’t care who or what saw him, he couldn’t take the risk of his dad catching up to him again, hurting him more. With the temper he was in, who knew what more he would do.
putting him away.”
He screamed. He screamed so loud Mrs Hudson downstairs could have heard him.
He was wearing a pair of normal black trousers, though he was considerably lacking as far as his torso went.
Did he?
“Tell me he hasn’t touched my greenhouse.” Mummy Holmes simply raised her eyebrows and took a sip of her tea. “Oh, for heaven’s sake!” Mycroft groaned, running toward the back exist of the house. He could hear Greg following in tow, laughing to himself as he followed behind. The last time Sherlock had invaded Mycroft’s greenhouse alone he’d decided to test which acids kill exotic primrose the quickest.
Instead he thought about what John loved the most (aside from him), quidditch, flying and broomsticks.
“No, but its usually never this awkward. Then again you aren’t usual.”
He just about managed it though. “Snake-eyes.” He stumbled into the Slytherin commons and headed straight up to the dormitories.
With careful fingers, Sherlock pulled the wrapping apart, the paper completely intact when it was off, leaving the box in its state, minimalistic with the logo printed on the top. He glanced up at John - who’d been watching him intently - eyebrow raised. “Armani?” He muttered, like he was trying to tell himself that, rather than questioning John.
The younger Gryffindor burst through the doors of The Three Broomsticks, red in the face and out of breath, obviously having ran in fear of being tailed or caught. He walked calmly toward Greg, as if the loud bang of the doors opening hadn't already caught everybody’s attention.
The quidditch grounds, remarkably weren’t wet, so Greg fell back onto the grass with a thud, inviting Mycroft to join him. The prefect rolled his eyes and laid down next to the Gryffindor.
Sherlock moved so he was in front of John, staring into his eyes, one of his hands was on John’s shoulder and the other was underneath his chin, forcing him to look. Deep blue met seafoam green and Sherlock felt a pang of sadness and an ache in his throat. “John stop talking, you’re wasting your breath. In through the nose, count to three, exhale through your lips.” He spoke as John completed each action with hiccupped breaths. “Relax your shoulders, close your eyes, just focus on my voice, can you do that for me?” Sherlock asked and John gave him a solitary nod. “Keep breathing John, I’m here, I’m not leaving. I’ve got you.”
He was free from her now, and he was never going back.
“That’s the right answer. Of course, he doesn’t know, none of you know. I know, obviously, but that’s not important. A surd is the square route of a number that isn’t square. Useless things, the only useless thing in this maths class.”
But he hadn’t today, his boxers still clung to his hips. Sherlock took that as a note that he should do the same.
It would have been so much easier for him to have stood there and told her that John wasn’t at all convinced by her make-up drawn eyebrows, and that he did find her laugh quite annoying. But John would’ve probably hit him if he said that, or worse, stopped being his friend, at least until the inevitable breakup, but the possibility of a longer duration was enough for him to shut his mouth.
“Okay, what the hell is wrong, you’re worrying me now.” He asked, his brow was furrowed and his concern was written all over his face. John looked like he wanted to break down in tears, staring into his drink.
His pale green eyes were searing into John’s own. They weren’t as icy as Mycroft’s had been, and John found himself staring into the seafoam colour. This was the closest he’d ever been able to look, and if he was honest with himself, Sherlock had fucking gorgeous eyes.
John pressed his face against Sherlock’s chest. “Thank you.”
“Molly woke up today.” John replied simply. If Sherlock had been paying more attention he would’ve noticed the redness around John’s eyes and the way his shoulders were raised, and his jaw was tensed.
He was shaken awake too soon to be wanted, but opened his eyes anyway, realising that he was still pressed against Sherlock, and the younger boy was still awake.
of you. I get the pleasure of the hissy fits.” He laughed when Sherlock scowled, nudging him in annoyance. “Well I mean if Lestrade knew the aspect of you that cuddles, I’d be concerned and hurt.”
But as he lay on the floor of whatever tower they’d locked him in to keep the precious pupils of the palace safe, he realised he really fucking hated being alone.
“Well go on then, might be a present.”
He couldn’t make any sense of it, one minute he was worried sick about the younger boy and the next he was filled with so much anger that he ran his mouth further than he even thought he
John pulled away, looking up at him. “You’re always so good with her, she adores you, you know. You probably know it already, but she sees you as her dad too.”
“John if you’re going to keep thinking such stupid things I may have to send you out of the compartment. It’s nobody’s fault but poor organisation, they didn’t prepare for such an interaction, which is their fault, not yours. They should know by now how infuriating my little brother can be.” Mycroft spoke and John kept his eyes shut, afraid that if he opened them he may begin to cry.
“You were in the hospital ward; he beat you up.”
“I try.” He paused for a minute before talking again. “You know it’s fine to be not okay. I know you don’t like seeming weak, but it isn’t weak. People have off days, even you.” His thumb was rubbing circles into the back of the prefect’s hand, which was comforting.
“So, you’re okay with all of this?” Sherlock asked, once he gained the willpower to pull away.
He rolled his eyes as those in his house turned to look at him, instead chose to focus on his brother.
He knew it would happen, he knew Harry would talk about him as her little sister.
"What?" John asked, his voice a murmur now.
There was a pause before John replied. “… Yeah.”
do it.”
Sherlock watched in amazement, as from the starburst gunshot wound in John’s shoulder, were the ends of a tribal sun, growing round the wound in a circular pattern, it was breath-taking.
“Where?” Mycroft called after him, pacing after him, but he already had his coat on, opening the door.
Sherlock smiled at him. “I’d love one.”
Sherlock had never been happier, despite what the state of his filing cabinet may suggest,
He was surprised to say the least, he certainly hadn’t calculated for it.
“I still don’t understand why blindfolding me was necessary, surely it would’ve been easier without it.” John spoke, as he pulled the scarf up off his face, blinking at the brightness of the room.
John moved closer, placing one hand on Sherlocks face, before kissing the side his palm wasn’t against. He could feel Sherlock smile as he kissed gently down his jaw, slow so it would be easy for him to be stopped if Sherlock decided he didn’t like it.
The name usually only changed once you did something fairly intimate with your soulmate. Some people, aromantics usually, changed the first time they met their soulmate. For others it was kissing, for most it was sex.
His Rubik’s Cube was in his dorm, so was his scarf. They hadn't let him take anything.
“You saved a goal upside down today, I think you’ll manage.”
Yeah, I remember.”
Mycroft didn’t lie down, but he sat instead, cross legged, with his hands in his lap ignoring the fact that Greg had his hand held out for the prefect to take it.
“If I had just stayed alone, maybe this would be more bearable. I have no doubts that somewhere there’s a spell that enables you to watch me but doing this single-handedly is going to drive me insane. We may as well start with the talking to oneself. I wonder if Mycroft, when he hears that I’ve lost my mind, will try and do something.” He spoke aloud, flopping back against the bed they’d been so generous to give him, despite the likelihood of him using it for its intended purpose, being slim. “I miss my skull.” He muttered, placing his hands behind his head.
Sherlock’s house wasn’t what he expected, but at the same time he couldn’t imagine anything else. It was one of those houses you admire from a distance, not quite a mansion but bigger than a regular house. The kind with the fancy gate and art made from hedges in the garden.
When time came for the castle to become a place of festivities, tinsel and baubles every way you turned, Sherlock decided it would be a good idea to show John what he’d been learning, teaching himself rather.
Later on, he saw John Watson meet his karma as the Gryffindor came passed him in the corridors as people headed for lunch. He wouldn’t have thought much of it if it weren’t for the fact that the second-year was walking on his hands, he stopped for a minute to acknowledge Mycroft.
Before he could continue his thought process Greg was against him, his chin resting in the crook of Mycroft’s shoulder like it had done before.
Greg pulled away with flushed cheeked and lips red, a grin came over his face and he started to giggle. “God you have no idea how awful it’s been. I'm so stupid. If I knew it would be that nice I would’ve asked you sooner.”
“So, John, three sciences? What are you going for, career wise?”
John nodded. “It’s alright.”
“I don’t see why not.” John replied with a grin, and Sherlock winked at him. He rolled his eyes.
of him.
“Uh sure.” He pulled his phone from his pocket and handed it to the younger boy. “Who told you I’m muggleborn?”
He slapped the ball, blocked it from the goal and sent it flying back into the hands of Dimmock, who sped back to the others goal.
“What did-“
Mycroft knelt in front of him, worry rising in his throat, gently he pulled Sherlocks hands away from the sides of his head, thumbs resting gently in the Ravenclaw’s palms, smearing ink onto his fingertips. “Sherlock, what’s wrong? Talk to me.” He kept his voice soft, low, forcing every ounce of warmth he could into it. He hadn't spoken to his brother like that in a long time, he could feel his voice cracking as tears threatened to rise in his throat. He didn’t know when or why they’d become like this, but he hated himself for it.
What else
“You’re the only person who calls me that.” He mused.
If John had the guts to talk back to the head master he would’ve made the point that it was similar to caging an animal, but he was sure Dumbledore could find a way to twist his words into sounding reasonable.
“Yeah actually. Looks like the sorting hat has some competition.”
“There isn’t a definitive answer to what love is, it’s not like there’s a set scale on the whole emotional side of the mind, but I suppose I would consider myself in love with you.” It was clear he wasn’t lying, the tips of his ears went pink and he stared towards the floor. Mycroft Holmes being bashful was a rare occurrence but it was a tell-tale sign he was sincere.
“What?”
He was breathing heavily as it came back to him, the bathroom tiles, and her hand, demanding and controlling and he couldn’t think about anything other than his waist.
Maybe Mycroft didn’t care like Greg did. Greg had a genuine friendship with John, almost brotherly in nature. Mycroft wasn’t John’s friend, he was barely an acquaintance, but his little brother’s business, his boyfriend’s business, was also his, and John had been a vital part in helping Sherlock flourish at Hogwarts, he had been an important and well-loved member of Greg’s team, whether he knew it or not.
“Yes, well…” Sherlock paused, should he tell him the truth?
“Oh?”
“Not with Sarah.” He offered, being vague, not necessarily out of intention, more because he didn’t want to face the problem, he felt awful enough when he was the only one who knew what he’d said.
“I didn’t ask why, I asked
“You kissed me.” Sherlock nodded, almost impressed that John clocked it so quickly. “You were having a panic attack when you did, weren’t you?” John spoke, keeping his voice calm.
“A bit yeah but I’m fine.”
. Think instead that I know you can. And when have I ever been wrong?”
“John?”
“My parents, like yours, insisted on making things a challenge for me, yes. I stopped going by William altogether, five years ago.”
John stared into his drink, unsure of what to say. “Yeah.”
“Is it always that simple?”
“I can’t believe you even held onto him after that.” Sherlock spoke, breaking him from his thoughts. Madame Promfrey had set his shoulder a while ago, with a little help from one of the house-elves and John’s own instructions. But he had to wait another hour before he could go Join the celebrations, though he doubted there’s be much celebration left by the time he got back. So Sherlock was sat with him, distracting him from the dull pain still aching in his arm.
He found the classroom and knocked on the door, pushing it open a tad to see the man at his desk, one hand in his hair as he marked whatever worksheets were on his desk.
“Are you always like this?”
“Yes, if you’re interested.”
Sherlock fiddled with his hands, opting to shove them in the pockets of his robes. “So, you aren’t annoyed?”
Because Greg’s dad held nothing over Mycroft’s head, he had no control over Mycroft, his only connection to Mycroft was friendly, was caring.
Sherlock Holmes was odd.
are you here for?” He rephrased and Greg froze struggling on the spot for his excuse.
It was the first game of the year, Dimmock had put a lot of pressure on everyone to ensure they would win, John especially. A few of the new teammates weren’t as great as everyone would have hoped, so John as one of the more capable members had a lot of pressure.
“I came to talk to you before she could get to you.” She replied, with a raised eyebrow, looking unfazed at the fact that John was just out of the shower, or that she was intruding quite severely into his personal space.
Mycroft glanced at him, over his shoulder, he was preparing the plates. “Thai, from your favourite.”
“So, you called me here for what exactly? To watch you do your shot?”
“I'm getting better.” It was working, the offense began to trickle into Johns tone of voice.
He was certainly quite posh. John licked his lips before replying.
“You don’t have to, it’s fine.”
“Dad’s in his armchair, they’re in our living room, but they’re
John had stopped eating his toast, almost dropping the jam smothered slice in surprise when the package fell onto his legs. He was staring at it in confusion, like somebody had just handed him an alien control panel and asked him to work it.
He caught Greg in the nick of time, dragging him into the dimmed depths of one of the stands much to his futile protests. Taking Greg’s hand in his, he pulled up the Gryffindor’s sleeve, he frowned and tutted before finding his wand.
“Oh, but where’s the fun in that?” Sherlock replied. “Your sister, Harry, she threatened to gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon if I were to attempt to engage you in sexual intercourse. I don’t appreciate the threat, but I’ll give her points for creativity. I haven’t heard that before.”
Conrad raised a gentle hand to silence them. “All that will be sorted, ‘Croft, but I was talking to John if I remember.” He gave a smile before turning to the youngest Gryffindor at the table. “You realise it will be a challenge? Not to discourage you by any means.”
“He’s not with you?” Lydia asked, her features scarily like Mycroft's as she looked between them confused.
“I was going to ask the whereabouts of her mother, but it is clear that she is no longer in the picture.” Sherlock replied, frowning slightly, as if he too seemed to be in pain. John didn’t take him for the emotional type, but he couldn’t help but feel that Sherlocks frown wasn’t one of immediate empathy.
Mycroft sighed staring into his bedroom ceiling. “No, he did not.”
“I don’t mind.”
“You could very easily unlock it, though I’m betting on your anxiety failing out the charm.”
“Jesus Christ, what are you doing here?” He breathed, shocked, holding his towel tight and resting a hand on his heart, feeling it racing. His face was hot with embarrassment and he felt his body crawl with anxiety
John certainly had.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked, putting his book down, leaning over the side of his bed t glance down at john on the floor. The Gryffindor had tear tracks streaking down his face, and his eyes were red, he didn’t hide his face, but he looked away from Sherlock’s stare.
He’d really cocked this one up, hadn't he?
out of mild attraction.
"I love you."
“Sarah.” Sherlock spoke once Lestrade had gone. It was becoming clearer to him now, that Sarah had a hand in it, a lover anyway judging by the blush, John wasn’t the type to two-time and to Sherlock’s knowledge they were still together.
“This might sound gay or whatever,” Mycroft began, smiling when Greg elbowed him for mimicking him. “But the grey was quite fetching.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Two? But you already gave me a gift.”
“Your notes.”
Sherlock’s parents smiled when they saw John and Mycroft.
Sherlock Holmes.
The Gryffindor raised an eyebrow. “So, this one isn’t normal then.”
“It’s a thing for people who fidget. I see you play with your fingers all the time, tapping and fiddling with things. I thought you might like it? I know you like the way things feel and stuff, so I just thought…”
John didn’t need Sherlock. But Mycroft knew, probably more than Sherlock did, just
"Fuck..." He breathed, his hand on Sherlock's head, fingers woven through the soft curls. He looked down as Sherlock glanced up. And oh fuck did it look like Sherlock was blowing him, taking his cock straight, as his head bobbed a little, his tongue making circles, sending frantic jolts of pleasure through John's body, and he tensed, feeling a wave of warmth, he was getting close. "Sherlock I-" He cut himself off, by choice, and then by a gentle moan as Sherlock's fingers dug into the backs of John's thighs. His mouth was hot and wet against John's cock, the doctor went rigid, fisting a handful of Sherlock's hair, causing him to moan around his clit.
“I din’t kiss you g’night though?” She spoke it more as a question than a statement, her words slurred with a yawn as tiredness began to overcome her. Sherlock could barely contain a smile, as he bent down again to let her kiss his cheek. “Nuh-night Lockie.”
“God, no, I can’t do maths for toffee.” John laughed. “She has a few books, but she just has a knack for it I guess. Her mum maybe.” He offered, and Sherlock furrowed his brow for a moment.
John dropped to the floor by Sherlock, keeping him upright as Mycroft let go, standing up and pulling out his wand, with a simple gesture the candle-light was gone, leaving only the light from the false sky in the ceiling. He left after that, leaving only the two in the room.
“Sure, as in you-“
Maybe John imagined it, but with his ear pressed against Sherlock’s chest he could’ve sworn he heard his heartbeat speed up. Now would’ve been a spectacular time to have had his stethoscope.
John practically threw the money at the cabbie wen they pulled up at Baker Street. He was desperate for Sherlock to touch him again, wanting his hands on his neck, and his back and other places he couldn't even believe he was thinking.
“She’s a teenager, they do stuff like that don’t they? All a part of growing up.”
A tap from the window knocked everything off course, startling him so far into falling off his bed.
Every day. Every damn day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner.
before John. He was almost certain Mycroft didn’t count, and even if he did, he and his brother weren’t exactly the friendliest to each other.
It takes the edge off the insult if he can fire one back. Especially if it’s a lot harsher than something as simple as “freak” or “psycho”.
“Yes, it’s quite magnificent, for somebody who can barely thicken a hiccoughing potion.”
The look of amusement on John’s face told Sherlock he’d been standing there long enough to hear his short lecture. He had a subtle look of pride written on his features, and Sherlock cocked a brow and the corner of his mouth quirked up.
“Yes.”
“Then, four hours, roughly.” John replied, taking his shot, pocketing a ball, and going again. He’d spent enough time at the pub to be decent at the game. He smiled softly, replaying Sherlock’s ballocksed attempt to ask him out.
“Abby! Your boyfriend’s here!” Harry called up the stairs.
“So, business?” John asked, remembering the text Sherlock had sent him.
No doubt John would be home sometime within the next hour.
“You’re out-numbered now, Myc.” Greg piped up, and John snorted, trying to hide it by taking a drink.
it's been like four months, I'm so sorry
“Don’t think that’ll go unnoticed, Watson.” The taller boy replied, stepping up the ladder, effortlessly.
He did now at least.
Sherlock hadn’t realised john had ever known his mother, he’d assumed she left, or died in childbirth. “Your mum?” He asked, trying not to be rude, but still curious.
The moment he thought the word, the hat yelled it out.
“I think we should move in together.” He blurted out; they were sitting in the living room of Greg’s flat. Greg was reading, one of the vinyl’s out of his increasing collection, and Mycroft was fiddling with a puzzle Greg had picked up from a small shop in Hogsmeade for him.
“Right, you’re in a strop. I’ll be in my room-“ He set down Sherlock’s cup of tea, so hard that it rippled, before grabbing his laptop. “
“How did you- never mind, I don’t want to know.” John laughed. “It’s still brilliant when you do that. Like magic tricks, you know there’s a method behind it but you never quite know what, so it still amazes you every time.”
She’d tried once to accompany him on his weekly library meet with Sherlock, after practice. That had been a disaster. She wasn’t dim by any means, quite bright as far as third years go, but nowhere near Sherlock’s level, or Johns memory. In the end Sherlock began to speak French out of annoyance and John had learned to block him out at this point. She had not and left after being ignored because John was actually trying to get work done.
Sherlock pushed him down into his chair, kneeling in front of him, trying to find the source of the sudden agony written in John’s features. “Breathe John.” He unbuttoned the doctor’s shirt, with nimble fingers, and John didn’t even protest the movement, his eyes were squeezed shut with pain.
They’d been using Morse code to communicate little things for as long as Rosie had been able to talk. Usually short words or things that couldn’t necessarily be spoken through expressions. Other parents opted for the spelling-it-out technique, but considering Rosie was bright for her age, she’d begun learning to read.
John pulled away, eyes blown out and his lips were red, Sherlock moved to kiss his neck, in the absence of his mouth. It had just occurred to him that despite having top surgery, his distinct lack of a dick beyond a packer was something that needed to be addressed. He knew for a fact that it could potentially change something, the least of which was whether Sherlock still wanted to do this with him.
“I shouldn’t have asked for a phone.” He muttered, and she let out a laugh from across the table.
He gave the Gryffindor a curt nod as he sat at the Slytherin table for the first years to be sorted.
“How was your summer John?” Stamford asked, the mention of his name bringing him back to the conversation, and he looked back to face him, realising in silent horror that he hadn’t been listening.
Sherlock realised early on that John preferred things to be equal, he liked things to be fair. He considered Sherlock offering him to be his flatmate as a favour that would take a long time to repay. Which is why he did most things Sherlock asked.
“Fluxweed, leeches, and powdered Bicorn horn.”
“Okay
Mycroft gave a hum in response. “Debateable.”
A moment later some soft music began to play from the speakers, male voices, in a rhythm and style Sherlock had never heard before but something about it was fun.
“On what?”
“Because I want to know what type of conversation we’re having. Are you going to lie to me?”
“You helped me with my binder. Even though I don’t even need it now you still do. Why’s that?”
When it was a test that he’d bombed hard enough to earn a detention. Mycroft had purposely put himself in detention to make sure he was okay.
It was cold, and in typical English weather, it was raining as they made the trek to Hogsmeade. Mycroft had proposed the idea, and intended to stick to it, somewhat bored being stuck in the castle for so long.
“And others don’t?”
John opened his eyes. “Why- Why do you keep saying that?”
that usually fell from his lips didn’t feel appropriate or helpful in this instance. For the first time in his life he was left clueless as to what he was supposed to do here. He couldn’t read anything from Greg other than shame and upset. God he really wasn’t great with people, was he? “Do you-“ He cleared his throat. “Do you want a hug?” He asked.
John nodded with a sigh. “I really ballocksed it up, Mike.”
“You’ve already given me thanks for-“
His frown faded when he felt Greg sit down beside him, leaning against him gently. A soft warmth spread throughout him body when the other boy drew his hands from his face, and laced their fingers, a gesture he’d found to be quite comforting. He sighed out hard, squeezing his eyes shut tight, somewhat forcing his shoulders to relax.
John nodded, smiling gently. “Thanks, Greg.”
“He said- He said that he likes me. He wants me to be his boyfriend.” He spoke, still quite unable to establish the words in his own mind, but Anthea didn’t look surprised, more happy than anything else.
Greg was patient. “Take your time.” It wasn’t menacing, it wasn’t sarcastic, it was calm and sincere.
“What’d they teach you!? Abracadabra!? Alacazam!?“ John braced himself for impact, this was usually where things got bad. “Pathetic, you’re a good for nothin’ freak!” A kick to the stomach. “Worthless-“ Another, he curled his arms around himself, hugging his own torso. “Mistake!”
He wouldn’t deny for a second that he thought John was attractive. It was true, his eyes were staggering, and his overall physique was enticing. It didn’t help that Sherlock had unknowingly fallen in love with Johns mind, even in its simple moments. But he’d kept himself restrained, knowing John was his flatmate, part-time colleague and only friend, and despite being bisexual, had a preference for women.
What bothered him most is that she had the premise to be incredibly interesting, perhaps even a friend, if she’d just let go of her fixation on him.
John dropped eye contact and shook his head. “No, we had a fight and I need to apologise. Do you know where he is?”
He’d had a year and a half of his life and his decisions ripped away from him. He’d been drugged into love against his will.
There were footsteps, as he fell back against the pillow, his chest rising and falling, the tears dripping down the sides of his face, the selfish thought of
“Well that was clearly evident.” He responded, adding a drip of sarcasm into his tone just to see the attempt at a hidden smile on Greg’s face.
“Certainly.” Mycroft replied, picking up his puzzle again, and Greg’s frown faded, he couldn’t work out how or why he’d suddenly decided to distract himself again.
“Was he drunk?”
“Pardon?”
“Says who!?”
“Do you mind if I try and guess?”
“You hate QI.” John spoke pointedly, hanging his coat up and checking his phone to see who the detective had texted, to no avail, he was always crafty about deleting things. John didn’t doubt it was just a text to Greg. If he wasn’t doing an experiment he’d be pouring over a cold-case.
John rolled his eyes.
“Uh- four?”
John rolled his eyes, turning his head to the window so the taller boy couldn’t see his smile. “You could avoid having to tell him that if you just didn’t smoke.”
John approached Lestrade, who smiled upon seeing him. "John! What can I do for you?"
“Really? Tell that to my last potions exam. He took a mark off me for missing a comma.”
“Well, I had a good example.”
He woke with John’s arms around his waist, his back pressed against John’s chest and the doctors head in his hair, soft breaths moving the curls ever so slightly. Their legs were a tanged mess beneath the duvet but he didn’t mind it. He scowled to himself, having become the little spoon as it were.
Sherlock raised a brow. “You’re better at a lot of things, but you seem to prefer it when I act superior. Lumos.” He muttered, and John put his own wand out, shoving it in his pocket as he leant on the broom handle.
people. But good enough I’d say.” The Gryffindor had said with a smile as he looked over his scores, offering a playful glare to Mycroft who returned with an eyeroll.
“Its not a wonder they locked you up.” Anderson spat, shoving him hard, he wasn’t ready for it, so he bowled over like a pin, knocking his head against the floor of the corridor, spots appearing in his vision as pain shot through his skull. “Freak.” He spat, kicking Sherlock in the side and the younger boy curled in on himself.
“If you don’t explain then of course I won’t.”
Sherlock made eye contact with him for a split second before staring at the back of the hall.
No matter how much he acted otherwise, John had seen just how much he cared for his little brother.
Sighing, John stood up, noting that Sherlock had handed him the green binder.
“Mm?” Johns voice was sleepy.
Well two of three had been because of Sherlock, the other was because John confessed he was trans. The girl promised not to tell anyone, but she outright stated she wasn’t a lesbian, which was certainly a kick in the stomach.
“A fucking twat.”
There had been times where she’d been in a phase of alcoholism and their dad had beaten him black and blue, all he could do was cry himself to sleep and hope to god that this was all just a bad dream.
He hadn't been able to say goodbye to John before school went out. The Gryffindor had been too caught up in the celebration of the Quidditch cup and got the train home in a carriage with Sarah, and her group of friends. Sherlock chose to sit with some of the nicer older Ravenclaw’s who he sat near in the great hall. They didn’t particularly acknowledge his existence but made an effort to speak to him occasionally throughout the journey, even though he ignored them anyway.
John laughed nervously. “Not for me, no.” He replied, letting his books slip from his knees, as he hunched into himself, knowing Sherlock was watching him carefully, trying to figure him out.
“My robes are minging.” John said, somehow just as weirdly nervous.
“What?” John asked, looking at him quizzically.
Then all of a sudden he was being pulled up, by somebody not quite his height, but not John either. “Mate you alright? Where’s John?” It was Lestrade, there wasn’t anybody else aside from his brother (who was still taller) that would help him, he clicked his fingers in front of Sherlocks face, to catch his focus. “Do you need to go see Madame P?”
“Well you are the only person who doesn’t.”
He was quite amused to see Sherlock muttering angrily to himself with a raincloud stuck over himself, robes drenched, and hair matted to his forehead. “Needs help for charms he said, can’t do magic he said.” He grumbled as he stormed passed the Slytherin, nose deep in a book of hexes.
“A sun, it looks well. It works nicely doesn’t it? A plant and a sun. They work together, I suppose it’s supposed to be symbolic.”
“I’m sure you’re aware at this point that you are his only friend.”
“No, thank you, Greg.” He laughed, looking up to the ceiling, embarrassment fading from his face. “It’s gonna be weird this year, without you as captain and Mycroft up my ass twenty-four-seven.”
“You got me there. How come you know how to dance?”
“I wouldn’t say
He’d just locked it.
John Watson was one of the school’s biology teachers, and Sherlock’s boyfriend of nearly a year. He was kind-hearted and loyal, but he could also break every bone in your body while naming them. He was an adrenaline junkie, yet he loved doing the crossword. He could shoot a man dead but could save a man’s life. He was an oxymoron and Sherlock loved that about him. He was interesting.
Mycroft found himself for the first time he could think of, legitimately caught off guard by something Greg had done.
“Are you any good?” Mycroft asked and the boy rolled his eyes. Mycroft could tell he was clearly dedicated, his nose red from the cold, his hands calloused from a lack of gloves and his hair wind-swept from being up so long.
“He has his friend.”
Sherlock smirked. “You’ve got a psychosomatic limp, of course you have a therapist. A coma patient could have told you that.”
Those set John off immediately. He had to spend the rest of the night unable to walk because of his limp and shaking from a panic attack. But he was awake, staring up at the ceiling as screams from Afghanistan haunted his ears.
Sherlock watched him, he was staring at the floor, it was strange to see him like this, it hadn't happened so severely for a while. His head hurt from it all. “Your mother, did she like this type of music?”
“It isn’t your fault, Mycroft.” Anthea’s voice cut in, drawing him back from his thoughts, and her hand rested atop his clasped together, he blinked and loosened his grip on his own hands, noticing his knuckles burning white.
Sarah, per John’s request to Dumbledore, albeit quite frantic, was to serve detention and removed from the quidditch team.
To his own surprise and relief, he clocked out rather quickly, his brain shutting down for a few blissful moments of peace where he didn’t have to live through the thought of John Watson suddenly getting rid of him for Sarah Sawyer.
There was tons of biphobia in the world, given the fact that most names weren’t unisex. People who were bisexual were frowned upon considering that they were apparently only supposed to be attracted to the gender of their soulmate.
Sherlock smiled again, and handed John his own package, ornately wrapped in nothing but what you’d expect from the Ravenclaw.
“Hold me?”
“Mycroft doesn’t greet people like that, but nice try Gavin.”
“Since when do you care about being pleasant?”
“Don’t apologise. Its… Its fine. I just need a moment.” Mycroft replied, twisting his fingers as he held his hands behind his back, trying to focus on that feeling enough to keep him from blacking out. “Will you excuse me? I will give you a response, I promise.”
A rhythmic tap against her bedside table caught his attention. It was Morse code.
Everyone stared at him oddly when he burst into the Slytherin common rooms.
“Yeah, felt good to play some proper football, though it can’t compare to quidditch-“ Mycroft offered a small smile as Greg talked animatedly about his summer, the small holiday his dad managed to drag him on and the mischief he and his friends got up to. “How was your summer Myc?” Greg asked, considering nobody else cared to. Both Sally Donovan and Anthea being muggle-borns they were latching onto their last moments of freedom to use their phones in peace.
He just hoped whatever was added to his finger was something he liked, or something, whatever John he ended up with, liked. Though it was unlikely that he would ever find that John, so he should just get used to having it there for the next however many years he lived.
They’d only been officially going out for a week when John missed his tutoring session. It was the first time that had happened since the incident with the quaffle and breathing difficulties.
Once Molly was safe in the hospital wing, and Sherlock had stifled a grin at the sight of his brother asleep in a chair by Greg’s hospital bed, they were interrogated by Professor Sprout, as Molly’s head of house, she was generally required to look after the issue. “Do you know what happened to her?” The teacher asked them.
John cursed himself for grinning.
“Weird.” The Gryffindor summed up his thoughts in a word.
“Funny.”
“Yes,
He’d wanted to be a doctor when he was little, before the whole magic business had started, he used to stick a toy thermometer in his mum’s mouth and treat her for an imaginary sickness. Some kind of twisted karma gave her a real one he couldn’t treat. Leaving the memories bitter in his head no matter how hard he tried to smile at them.
