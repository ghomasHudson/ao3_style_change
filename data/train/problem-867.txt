I had not forgotten, just pushed the knowledge to the very back of my mind amongst the dust and cobwebs of my subconscious. Any thought that this could go well for me was overlaid with a thick sense of dread after the horrors of my previous encounter. I needed Tom to show me what was required, but the bounty on my head made the practical experience impossible, I was expected to endure and to learn the necessary only from bitter experience, the words of Mr V thrown back to me as prophecy.
“It was Harry. She rang me a couple of days ago, said you were acting a bit weird, not answering her calls and stuff, she thought you might be having a hard time being away from home, thought you might be missing me. Wrong on both counts I guess”
Never, in over three years had he even come close to the sneakiest of peeks, no matter how many times John had ‘accidently’ walked in on a shower or bathroom break. Sherlock guarded that thing like the fucking crown jewels, he may as well stick it in a bullet-proof case. But hell, at least now he knew it was indeed a thing of beauty, and he had to see it again.
John peered up at him through thick dark blond lashes and Sherlock’s heart began to pound again. Really, he should be able to control himself a bit better than this.
“Eleven people that would have lived, had you been alive, but there was no John Watson to marry her, you see?”
‘Don’t be afraid lad, you have nothing to fear from me’ he said softly as instinct caused my body to betray the uncertainty I felt even as I replied, ‘You mistake me, I am not afraid sir’.
“No probs, there’s an empty warehouse on Sackville Street, down by the docks, loads of people, mostly kids, stay there when the weather is shit like tonight, I’ve stayed there myself a few times. It’s dry at least, still not very fucking warm though”
They both held their breath, frozen in the aftermath as an impatient foot tapped a beat onto the ground.
The rosin compartment in his violin case held an illicit supply, placed there when John had been busy in the shower. He retrieved them now, a slim white and gold packet of Marlboro lights, a compromise of sorts, in exchange for a week of enforced sobriety. They both tried to ignore the fact that he was merely exchanging one addiction for another, just for the time being though, because John’s next evil plan involved nicotine patches.
He should know, because he’d lived it, it was him and Mr Watson from the very first time until the day he’d finally had enough and found the courage to end it. But he couldn’t part with these, they were all he had left, and he would show him, so he could see how much it had all meant…and still did.
“Sherlock lad, haven’t seen you at one of these in a while, is that new school of yours working you too hard?”
John smirked. Nothing took your mind off your own romantic troubles faster than ripping the piss out of your similarly unfortunate friend. (Although romantic didn’t really apply when it came to Sherlock, did it?)
“I expect so, if he didn’t work for the government he would make a fucking exceptional criminal mastermind”
John cleared his throat and leaned forward slightly in his seat, moving forward into Mycroft’s personal domain in a subtle gesture of defiance.“I can pull a decent pint”, he said coolly, “and mix cocktails too, all the poncey shit that that type of idiot seem to go for. I’m assuming there’s a bar at this do, and I worked in a pub for a while in my last year of school…..just an idea…if being my boyfriends’ plus one is out of the question”.
, in fact, a very real temptation. It could be easy money, very easy, and he was ex-military which meant he was more than capable of handling himself if the whole thing turned out to be dodgy. ‘I don’t think they’re looking for ladies at all,’ he said.
Three days since he’d necked the rest of the vodka and got so pissed he refused to go outside or open the window when he’d wanted a smoke, setting the alarm off.
“I don’t need a quick flash of your bits to prove that you are actually human you idiot, I already know you are. You’re more real to me than anyone will ever be Sherlock, not some illusion, woven out of shadows and lies, you died for me and came back, twice. So…. you are most definitely worth it, and not just because of your bloody gorgeous body parts”
Both men stopped, Weston red-faced and apoplectic with rage that I should even dare to address him, his lip curled in disgust, which was a vicious irony, I thought, he being the truly disgusting one. I met his gaze and watched him squirm with pleasure. The strength of his ire had overwhelmed him, and he panted, chest heaving as I squared my shoulders in defiance.
“You could’ve just said you know…that you’ve never done it before, instead of half choking yourself….here, sit up, I want to try something….I think it’ll be more your cup of tea somehow…open your mouth…I promise I won’t bite…much”
Sherlock loomed out of the doorway mere inches in front of his face. “Why? Do you think I would lie to you?” John squawked in surprise and stepped back, catching his foot in a tangle of roots. His ankle twisted painfully beneath him. Damn it that hurt.
Sherlock was reeling, his father was asking John to move in with them, his mother as a member of the household staff when she was well, and an education for Harry and John too. And after Christmas, school, together, what more could either of them want?
“Yeah…oh, this one here wants a fifty” she jerked a thumb at Sherlock who sat at the kitchen table looking twitchy and drawn again, fidgeting nervously in his coat pocket.
A sandy blond head peered quizzically at him from the foot of the oak, one hand shielding his eyes from the glare of the winter sun. Sherlock gaped, open- mouthed, completely derailed from his current train of thought as the most beautiful creature he had ever seen smiled up at him from the ground.
“Well, well, well” Irene sidled up behind him, running a fingertip down the left side of his neck, the side currently hidden from Greg, the side…oh shit, right, that.
He felt spacy and blissed out as John stroked and soothed, working down his spine with soft tender kisses unaware of his evil intent.
“Shit mum, why don’t you bring out the humiliating baby photos while you’re busy divulging my life story”.
Mary leaned in, mouth close to his ear so he could hear her over the swell of sound. “He can’t take his eyes off you, John” She edged forward, crushed by the press of people all around and placed a hand on his chest for balance, while her other arm wound around his waist, a finger hooked through his belt loop.
They dragged their feet as they descended the steps, each as reluctant as the other to let these last precious moments of solitude go, the rest of the world intruding on their secret idyll.
“Okay princess, taxi it is!” John laughed at the indignant look on his face as he processed the word ‘princess’.
He dragged up the last few minutes of conversation from his subconscious. A benefit ball, organised by Trevor Senior, a fund-raising event to be attended by local dignitaries and businessmen, and in charge of PR and advertising by familial request – none other than Victor himself. Christ what a fuck-fest.
Sherlock thumbed through his phone, one eye still fixed on the toilet door as he fired off a text or two. If it opened now he might crumble, best move, go home, he could be there in twenty.
(It was true – he had observed the dilated pupils and increased breathing rate, oh, and the hand surreptitiously adjusting himself in his trousers because just staring at Sherlock had made him half-hard),
John made a grab for the phone in Sherlock’s hand and frantically punched in a number, “Follow me?” he hissed, and Sherlock nodded dumbly. He picked up his cup and took a swig of cold coffee, just to hide his face from Mary, sure that his guilt must be written there.
“Won’t they find us here?, we should probably move” John managed finally as he glanced over the side and looked down.
“Ah well, my mistake” Sherlock shrugged and drew a lighter from his pocket, igniting the cigarette and taking a long, leisurely drag. He looked smugly satisfied, this obviously meant something to him.
The weather quickly turned and I did not go out. Indeed, I confess I barely even noticed as the light, bright skies of morning gave way to a heavy, persistent rain, battering against the window. Sarah brought luncheon at one, but by half past four when she came to fetch the tray and bring in high tea as was our custom, it remained where she’d placed it, the cold-cuts curling and dried at the edges and bread rolls turned as hard as rocks. Without John there to prompt me it was easy to ignore my body’s needs and ate only when the noise of my belly sought to drown out the thoughts in my head.
Sherlock stayed silent. She needed to vent and he wanted to listen and so he waited while she smoked the cigarette down to the filter and lit another. Chain-smoking. At least they had that in common.
“I want to see you…please John” Sherlock gasped, slowing his hips and squeezing down on John’s waist to catch his attention. It was an effort of will to stop moving when he was so bloody close.
Sherlock didn’t add that he was right, that John had deduced him just as surely as Sherlock ever could to anyone else.
Sherlock nodded frantically and to his horror Victor’s shoulders began to shake in peals of silent laughter. He bit back the urge to punch him and cursed himself for saying anything at all. This was a fucking disaster, of all the people he could have copped off with, Sherlock Holmes had to choose the new Biology teacher.
The back of his neck tingled. Someone was watching him. There, in the corner of the bar beside the DJ booth, he was standing with a woman in a blue floral top and tight jeans, she was swaying rather precariously on her stool. Pissed, and her partner, husband? No, a family resemblance, brother or cousin? Looking less than amused. He was a new face though, someone he hadn’t noticed here before. On the short side, blond hair, prematurely streaked with grey, and a trim looking body in a blue checked shirt and jeans. A ring, now that was interesting, married then, or possibly separated. They were deep in conversation, or she was, anyway, talking intently her words punctuated by wild gesticulations, leaning in close to him to be heard above the pulsating beat. They looked out of place here, thirtysomethings at an educated guess, at a club where the average punter, especially on a weekend, would barely be out of their teens.
It must have been the whiskey, because there was no other possible explanation for what happened next. They were standing in front of his…no…Mary’s house and John had absolutely no recollection of how they got there. Maybe the tube ride had been so bloody awful he had just erased it from his memory. His key wouldn’t turn, John rattled it in the lock, frustration and temper growing. The locked clicked on the other side and the door opened a crack.
‘Well, from what I could gather from the ladies of the house, you know how they love to gossip I am sure, they had been led to believe you had made your escape to some relation or other that you had recollected in town’.
The earnest way he said those words were making John a little nervous, Sherlock had been wired since his explosive arrival at the flat, but he had put it down to excitement, just the same as him, but there was something else behind this, something more. He wished to god that the stupid idiot would just come out and say what was on his mind, instead of assuming that John was clever enough to understand all the cryptic little clues and tells.
me…not so sweet are you, the way you want me like this, helpless underneath you” he trailed his fingers down the length of John’s spine feeling him shiver, then slowly, slowly scratched his way back up, just a little too deeply, a little too hard. John gave a jerk, unsure if he should flinch away or stay, trying to process what Sherlock was doing.
He retreated back the way they had come, and cast around for a suitable place to hide. This wasn’t new, he had done this countless times before, but this time it felt tainted and wrong. There was a betting shop at the end of the street, with a side gate closed with a simple drop catch. A swift, well placed kick with his boot sent the gate bursting open and he sprang forward to stop it crashing back onto the brick wall. The yard was dark and empty, wet with the overflow from ancient plastic guttering. There was a low brick coal-house with a flat concrete top, a relic from the days before gas central heating sitting unused and crumbling by an old outdoor toilet.
Lectures had passed in a blur, entire periods spent staring out of windows or drawing doodles in the margins of his refill pad. An entire week’s worth of notes he would have to catch up on at some later date. He had stopped short of
Sherlock moved again, in obvious disagreement, and no small amount of discomfort going by his expression, and got a smack on the arm and a shove between the shoulder blades for his pains. The blow sent him staggering forward a few paces, and Victor threw his hands up in disgust despite it being clearly his fault, and John’s hand was on the door before he could think to stop himself. He shoved it open roughly, or tried to, wincing as instead, the heavy, tight hinges protested and ruined his dramatic hero entrance. Sherlock and Victor, both whipped their heads around to face him.
‘Your lies are admirable and your loyalty misplaced, but tell me, you must know that innocence is but a fleeting thing and in a place such as this has a price upon it, there will be others, and every virgin will come to it sooner or later’.
Weston heaved his bulk out of the chair, and stalked around the desk to stand before me. It was too much like the first time I encountered him, I standing small and uncertain while he ogled and stripped me naked with his eyes. He had taken my innocence and now planned to complete my ruin.
“Anything yet?”, John asked, trying to disguise the note of hope in his voice this time, not wanting to pressurise.
“Come where?” Sherlock had said, and Mycroft just shook his head and laughed, leaving him feeling stupid and annoyed because he didn’t understand.
Mycroft stared pointedly at Sherlock, anticipating a snarky comeback. He wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.
Mycroft smile despite his irritation, as he heard the click of a tray, set down upon a wooden surface and felt the touch of warm calloused hands through the thin material of his shirt as they wound around his waist from behind. A heavy chin, mildly scratchy with a two-day stubble rested on his shoulder and warm sweet breath tickled at the hair behind his ear.
John had to hand it to the kid, he was damn well working that elf costume. He had seen him in the morning in the changing room, cause really, who the hell would walk through London dressed like that? And dammit, those tights left nothing to the imagination, clinging to every little lump and bump (change that to big lumps and bumps) Thank god there were a little pair of candy-striped shorts to go over the top or Santa might have been sporting a little chimney stack of his own.
Seriously, he might as well have put a neon sign above his head that said ‘John Watson is shagging this bloke’. Not that he was, because he wasn’t, it was just a day in the life of a typical high school rumour mill, and to an onlooker this did look suspiciously like some sort of lover’s tiff, especially since Sherlock didn’t even go here.
He leaned heavily against the front of the empty stage, deep in thought, about dark hair and eyes like slivers of ice when someone tapped him on the shoulder from the right. Shit. He must have jumped about a mile he was so far gone, and his jolted pint of lager sloshed over the side and down his arm. He shook his wet hand and wiped it off on his jeans. A short blonde girl stood and smiled and him with a quizzical look in her eyes.
Later, as we made our way to the laboratory, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.
Its somewhat ambitious title was “A Case For Open Love” and it attempted to show that it should not be illegal for two men to have romantic relations. I was sure that the populace was scandalized by its case but I found myself drawn farther and farther in to its points. What bravery this person had to argue that the type of love I enjoyed with another man was not a wicked thing but in fact good and natural. Holmes inquired at what was making me grin so wide and so I began to read:
The unhappy youth could make no sense of his father’s question, so lost was he in his misery. He merely raised his head from his pillow and told the Elder Strangerson that he no longer cared what happened to him. At this declaration, his father realized that his son must be in a sorry state indeed, and that nuptial arrangements would have to secured as quickly as possible.
I followed Holmes, bewildered. The man on the floor seemed to be resting, exhausted from the frenetic activity. Holmes reached into a cupboard, pulled out a bottle, and removed the cork.
Doffing my undergarments, I stood and assisted Gregson in removing the remainder of his clothing, the two of us now entirely naked in the drawing room. I took a moment to examine his beautiful body, which was as robust and brawny as I had imagined. His muscular physique was covered in a downy fuzz, a lighter match to my own coarse hirsuteness. I ran my hands along his sides, tugging at his fine chest hair as he arched his back and spread his butt cheeks below me. I spit on his hole and began to rub my member against his crack, which caused him to convulse in rapturous shivers. By now, he was fully hard again and I grabbed his shaft while placing another deep long kiss onto his lips.
Mr. Drebber appeared confounded, and he glared hard at my companion. “My wife’s ruby ring,” he said. “It is an extremely valuable item, and it has gone missing following our recent holiday.”
“Napayshni now rolled atop me, his weighty frame pressing down on mine with a pleasant pressure. He shifted about, reaching over to a calabash sitting by his bed. This vessel contained a natural emollient that he used in his shamanic arts but which also served another purpose. After pouring out a glob of the slick material upon his palm, he placed his hand on his aperture and stuck one of his fingers into his slit, moaning as he did so. My own finger was still lodged inside him and our combined efforts succeeded in stretching his sphincter further than before. I did not understand the purpose of this action, telling him that I wished for him to enter me.”
“His own fervor must have been aroused by these actions for, at one point, he undid the clasp of the cloth covering his crotch. Out sprang his own erect implement, towering over my head like a fine oaken club. His piece was immense, as was befitting a man so large as himself, and the reflexes of my characters told me what I must do. A voice in my head said simply: ‘Allow your desire to overtake you.’”
The candles began to glow with a buttery light, the room resembling the oil painting of an Impressionist. The long-lashed man shuffled closer. As he emerged fully from shadow, I saw that he was nude. His organ was thick and serpentine, draped softly over one of his legs. His Mohammedan heritage was clear—the exposed purple head of his dick facing toward me, swelling. He allowed his fingers to gently play along its length.
I would hear Holmes banging into them from the room next to mine. Exactly how he found so many men in London with such capacious arseholes was beyond me. I did my best to ignore it, thinking that I should be out finding a romp of my own. But still I listened, often bringing myself to completion with the sound of some man softly calling Holmes’ name.
With the smoke rushing into my head, I felt momentarily bewildered. “Yes,” I said, and then repeated myself. “Yes.”
“The wells are to the right, my brothers,” said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.
“Here is a gentleman of the medical type, burly, and with the air of a well-honed military man. Clearly, you are virile and enjoy taking charge. I knew that you and Stamford had enjoyed one another. But he was also still somewhat nervous around you, indicating that the two of you had just met once again after a long period of absence. You clearly seduced Stamford quickly and quite successfully. You enjoy sex, work swiftly, and will easily take your pick of men.”
“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said. “I know nothing more of him than I have learned from our few brief… encounters. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.”
“Since I was a young boy, I have felt the stirring in my loins when with close male companions. At first, I took the sensation as indication of my great love and friendship for them but at some point I realized that it meant more. I became distraught after this recognition, and filled with anger. Back at home in Chicago, I was a terror, picking fights with other boys in the street and letting loose great mischief upon the world. My parent eventually wished to be rid of me, and so I headed out west to seek my fortune.”
The intimate caress of his fingers didn’t last long. Both Holmes and I pulled our hands back, as if mutually burned by a flame between us, and a moment of silence stretched.
And with that, he leaned in and planted his tender lips upon mine. Caught unawares, I melted into his embrace. Our intimate connection caused a swelling in my breast and I knew then and there that I was in love with Sherlock Holmes. Because of the earlier actions of our new companions, we were both in quite a randy state and so my hand slipped around the girth of his cock just as his hand did the same to my member. I tugged at his preposterous prominence, feeling its incredible size and weight for the first time. His own exploration of my implement sent inundations of bliss throughout my body.
At the same time, I looked at Drebber’s face, my considerable instrument in his mouth and hairy satchel resting up against his chin. Our eyes met and he gave the briefest of nods, assenting to the minute movements I began to make with my hips. Warmth spread through my groin, elation fanning out into my body. This was sensational in every sense of the word. The three of us were a well-oiled sexual machine producing pleasure at treble the normal rate. Our actions felt primal, animalistic, and exceedingly masculine; for what better study of a man’s body than another man?
Still wishing not to move to fast and yet desperately needing to give in to his long-held yearning, Hope dropped to his knees and began to lick Strangerson’s downy rear. He heard whimpering come from his friend and decided to proceed. With his tongue, he ran a line up and down Strangerson’s tender crack, stoking the virgin’s desires. Strangerson felt his head awhirl with unbelievable passion, which only grew stronger when Hope’s lingual exploration served to sever apart his cheeks and the convert’s tongue came to rest atop his aching aperture.
I suppose I should not have submitted so easily and allowed Holmes to use my instrument as a transactional tool in his case. But you must understand that it had been some time since a pair of fine lips had become wrapped around my cockhead. Drebber, with his avuncular handsomeness, was not a terrible way to break this virginal fast.
Sherlock could almost see the electric charge that sparked across the gap between their tensed bodies.
Is this what Sherlock felt like, the times when he was high? Or was this why he got high, to block out this terrifying excess of everything?
“Stop treating me like the enemy here John, we both have his best interests at heart…you never know we could even end up as friends”.
“Insolent brat!” she shrieked, with a noise that assaulted the ears, and she looked from my face to John’s who stood by me stomach shaking and lips pressed to supress the peal of laughter eager to burst out and narrowed her eyes, lips curled in a sneer of disgust, “You must be one of them!” she declared as if this on its own was supposed to make sense, but sure enough she clarified soon after. “An invert!...A damn filthy cock-sucker!…What’s up love? Aint never had a real woman show you how it’s done?”
“I am too old for you now sir, is that it?”, Sherlock said, leaning back against the headboard, not bothering to cover up yet, cock still at half-mast as the arousal slowly dissipated. It wouldn’t even warrant a wank this time, the feeling had already passed.
“It is the fever John, a condition of the body, not the mind….no words however cruel the intent could have caused this.”
“You’re the one that turned up here…I didn’t ask you to come, so will you for god’s sake just tell me what’s wrong?” he was panting slightly with the effort it had taken to catch up and trying to ignore the curious glances and knowing smirks heading in his direction.
“Listen….John isn’t it?”, said Victor...I haven’t got the faintest fucking idea what you’re talking about, what do you mean?, what bloody camera’s?”
“What does I look like genius? I’m rolling a rather splendid joint, which you and I are going to thoroughly enjoy”.
The woman was shell-shocked, gaping like a stunned cod-fish while the little boy launched himself across John’s knee in an attempt to physical wrestle the crappy gift from his crying sister’s arms.
“I’m full of insanely good ideas John, and I might just have another one you might like even better”
She popped back up again and shut the car door with a click, hoisting the bag up on her shoulder as she turned to look at him.
I marveled at this grown-up version of Stamford, far more forward than in our school days. Had his encounter with this Sherlock Holmes character had anything to do with it?
Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds.
“The cowboy seemed further fueled by my appearance, his rollicking insertions and exertions picking up pace until he cried ecstatically and emptied his ejaculate into my companion. The fluid must have been abundant as it crowded Napayshni’s compartment and came dripping out his aperture onto the floor. It seemed that the Indian had already come, as the saturation mingled with a dollop of white material that was beneath the two men. The cowboy kissed and thanked Napayshni, tipping his hat as he strode past me and out into the cool night air, his hide as bare as the skins covering the tent.”
Holmes stood right next to me and, at that moment, leaned over to whisper in my ear, “I hope you won’t mind if I borrow this.”
Strangerson glared at his companion, feeling that a new connection had grown between them. His buttocks were slick with sweat inside his pants and his erection had been straining against the fabric throughout Hope’s detailed description. He asked his friend what became of his relationship with Napayshni.
This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. As I previously mentioned, this area was new to me; though I noticed we were not far from our apartment on Baker Street. Holmes seemed intimately familiar with our surroundings, addressing our cabman on precisely where to pick us up in a few hours. The drive made a face as we disembarked; evidently he did not think this part of town decent.
“Look at you, John,” he said. “You are a marvelous creation. I apologize that we were interrupted earlier.”
“’No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘He had been waiting for a gentleman for two days.’”
My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty. Desperately, I wished to speak to him more about what had transpired when I tried to kiss him during our time with Drebber. If nothing else, I wished to clarify our standing with one another. But I knew my questioning would be impudent—Holmes had articulated the rules and they seemed to be rather steadfast. Besides, it would not be practical to talk about such matters here in public.
Harry was sitting at a table, long and wooden with a bench on either side in what would, in the summer months be the beer garden. Now it was simply damp and cold, seeping through the seat of his jeans as he sat down beside her. She offered him a ciggy from her packet but he shook his head, taking the metal tin from his pocket and fishing out one he’d pre-rolled in a fit of boredom in John’s flat this morning. She raised an eyebrow.
It was such an exquisite release to give over control like this, and he had never fully trusted anyone before, unable to kiss, or hold or touch. He would just have to lie here and take it, whatever John wished to give…or take away, even better than a good hard spanking. He shuddered with anticipation.
“Sherlock come down at once, and please bring your young friend” Mama called from the foot of the stairs.
Sherlock picked compulsively at a loose piece of thread on the outer seam of his jeans as they waited for John to make it downstairs. The door to 221A opened and closed.
What they had done together was not the problem, it had been one of the best nights of Sherlock’s life in that respect, but Victor had left. It didn’t matter that Mycroft had sent him away, to Sherlock he had never tried and therefore he had never really cared.
John glared back, great, an old-family snob and a trouble maker, with any luck the idiot would be sorted into Slytherin, sounded like he would fit right in there. He snatched up another piece of toast with rather muddy fingers and ripped off the crust, chewing angrily as the crunchy bread shredded his gums. John was just as good as any other student in the school, he was Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and had achieved ‘Outstandings’ in Defence Against The Dark Arts, Transfiguration and Charms in last years ‘O.W.L’s’. It wasn’t that he had some sort of inferiority complex, it was just fucking annoying that he had to try twice as hard as the next student just to prove himself, while pure-blood arseholes got it all handed to them on a silver platter the moment they left school.
John stared out of his bedroom window, the weather was awful today, wind howling like a banshee, lifting the tiles on the roof, and rain pissing down in fat heavy drops. “Not today girl” he said, absently stroking the top of Dawn’s head. It was just as well, because he didn’t actually enjoy the park if Sherlock wasn’t going to be there. He switched on his tv and settled back against the headboard of his bed with a can of Coke and half a bag of salted popcorn left over from the night before, determined to ignore the Maths assignment that was due in tomorrow.
He shrugged, “Not really ( because he would admittedly try anything once)…If you think that’s kink John, you’ve led an extremely sheltered life, it’s positively vanilla in the grand scheme of things”
“It’s either this, or drinks at the Diogenes Club with Mycroft genius….so bloody well take your pick”
Ten more minutes, and that was it, and if he got a couple more drinks in before bedtime he might even break his own rule and let Victor do him. Really, it would be an act of mercy, the boy was so horny after their snog he was practically vibrating.
“Quite the exhibition I must say Mr Watson” he drawled “ I can see we have a budding pugilist in our midst”
“Is Master Watson expected back tonight?” she asked as she bustled about the room, collecting up the unwanted food and piling it onto a sturdy wooden tray to carry down into the kitchen. “I could rustle up something cold if he wants but not after twelve you’ll have to tell him.”
‘Will the old man keep our secret’ I said. John drained half a pint down in three thirsty gulps and set his tankard down on the table.
“I’m not even going to introduce you at this rate, but I doubt if he’ll give a fuck anyway” John replied.
Sherlock huffed a little resentfully, picked up his drink and took quite a large gulp, the bitter fluid both warming and stinging his throat on the way down. He could hardly expect John to stick by his side like a limpet all night, he was the host with other guests that weren’t Sherlock to attend to aswell. Molly was studying in a similar field, Pathology, and would have far more in common with John now than he would. It should hardly be news to him, when John had first started University he knew it was only a matter of time before the four year age gap became really telling. Sherlock wondered sadly if John even considered them to be best friends anymore.
“There was the ring,” I said. “Which was purported to be stolen, though you quickly deduced that this was merely a cover story. Yet Strangerson, who was the secretary of Enoch Dreber, had the ring with him in the end.” A bolt flashed in my mind and I realized there was an easy conclusion to make from this information. “Which means that Strangerson must have had the ring with him the whole time, even before the alleged robbery.”
Soon, a cloud of fine-scented smoke billowed about the two of us. The thin veil provided a touch of modesty to our scene and Gregson slowly began to unwind. The dark spirit in his glass also appeared to put him at ease, and he told me at length about his suppositions. The particulars seemed to be in something of the right direction, with Gregson correctly identifying Drebber and Strangerson as members of the American religious movement known as Mormonism. But he was under the impression that the robbery had been genuine, committed by a man named Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy.
Across the room, through the curtain of smoke, I could see Holmes in outline. He was naked and his enormous curving implement stuck out pompously before him. He threw the side-burned Rance over the back of a couch and immediately sank his massive manhood all the way into Rance’s snug arsehole. Soft moans carried over to my ears. The darker-skinned man Holmes had stolen took a position beneath Rance, deftly swallowing his cock while rubbing his own circumcised member. Several nearby patrons began to touch themselves, watching the action attentively.
“The curved dome of his lusciousness slipped past my lips and I was like a man taking his first taste of whiskey. The flavor was heady and restorative, with an undertone of salt that somehow mesmerized me and bade me take him further into my maw. The experienced healer knew precisely how much of his protuberance he could proffer, filling my mouth with his hardness but stopping short of rendering things uncomfortable for me. My own member was inflamed beyond measure by this point, especially as he continued to stroke it with all his talents and skills.”
I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I said to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.” Annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation, I thought it best to change the topic.
This was something Hope had wished not to be asked. But he gave in to his friend’s inquisitiveness. “I was aroused beyond measure. It was not something I could help.”
The two men did what came to them naturally, their erotic display one enjoyed by men since time immemorial. Stangerson, the penetrated one, felt his body opening into a higher realm of spiritual satisfaction as his friend’s considerable implement slid in and out of his tight chute. Hope conducted his actions with expert ability, making sure that his incursions satisfied his companion’s innermost cravings, rubbing his engorged cockhead against the point of Strangerson’s prostate, causing both of them to moan and grunt like wild dogs.
“You must study him then,” Stamford said, and then bade me goodbye. “You’ll find him a knotty problem, though.”
Not quite understanding where this was going, I told my friend that it was no matter. “Thank you for kicking off these excellent festivities.”
Realization dawned upon Strangerson now. His eyes grew wide as he leapt from his repose. Without another word to his father, he ran from the room, his feet carrying him out into the crepuscular dusk and straight to Jefferson Hope’s house, where he knocked upon the door. At the sight of his friend returning to him, Hope’s heart filled with joy. But he remained on guard as soon as he saw that Strangerson was panting, clearly worked up into some extreme emotional state. The two men gazed at one another across the threshold, each unable to utter a single sentence.
“Are you saying, Mr. Drebber, that you gave no interest in something like this?” Holmes said, retaining a comfortable grip around my shaft.
While locking his eyes upon the two of us, he picked up a small bottle from the floor and dabbed some lubricant upon his fingers. He rubbed his hole with his slippery hand and carefully inserted a digit into the rose-colored crevice. The routine had its intended effect—almost absentmindedly, I began to once again slide my wide contrivance into and out of Gregson’s snugness. Holmes smiled and nodded his head encouragingly, pressing another finger into his enticing slot.
It seemed that no bigger prize—both figuratively and literally—could have pleased Drebber more. Leaving my growing erection aside, he shifted to face Holmes, pressing his face into that incredible creation. He seemed to drink deeply of Holmes’ dick, and immediately become inebriated. Rubbing his bearded cheeks over its unending length, he looked like a creature at play. Eventually, he leaned down to accept the enormous head into his mouth, an ecstatic shiver running through his entire body.
We shifted positions a few times; he taking me on my back, then from behind while I crouched on all fours. Eventually, we settled on our sides, he spooning me as my left leg stuck straight up into the air. He played his fingers over my erection like a practiced musician on their favorite instrument, bringing me close to the edge but subsiding just before I came. All the while his unbelievable attribute dove into my trembling pucker, coaxing me farther and farther toward Arcadian bliss. With each ingress, I felt the pressure on my prostate, the crowding of my compartment, the astonishing hardness and strength of his enormity. I wanted this delight to be never-ending.
“Yeah well, Frank’s going places, you know? And when someone is doing well, people line up to knock them down don’t they?”
Oh fuck! His back had been turned to the door and he hadn’t noticed John’s return. Mycroft, he realised, evidently had, and had timed his incriminating response accordingly (smooth move you fat wanker)
True to his word, through the next attic space we saw a face in shadow, young and filthy, wide-eyed and hollow-cheeked. The child waved an arm to us and we hastened onward for the last dusty stretch, and shimmied down a thick knotted rope looped over a straining oak beam above our heads. John glanced at me anxiously. But here I needed no assistance. I had played such games in my childhood in Lancashire but the beam was branch of a gnarled and ancient oak tree, just beyond the grounds of the manor. With swift, sure movements, hand over hand, I dropped to the landing first. John came after, and standing just below afforded a spectacular view of his thighs. I thought of them, gripped around my hips as he straddled me, muscles flexing, I felt the colour rise to my cheeks and turned my head away, and blew lightly on my burning palms as if doing so would cool my heated blood.
John snuck out around nine, after supper when the adults were safely ensconced in the drawing room with a platter of cheese and wine. Sherlock watched him disappear from view and tried desperately not to think of John with his hands and mouth all over some god-awful village girl.
It hadn’t started off like that of course, but it didn’t take long to get him hooked, the sex only ever part of it and still the best he’d ever had.
“ And we have unfinished business apparently….besides John, I’m rather tired of this tedious dance of ours”
“Um, yeah?” John said, sheepishly, taking the proffered clipboard and pen from her hand and shuffling off through yet another doorway. The sofa in question, (loose cushions sliding around on a fake willow frame) faced out onto a leisure pool, separated by a corridor of glass where several pensioners floated, motionless in a hexagon shape, like a scene from Cocoon. A sign taped to the wall read ‘Aqua-Fit Class. Pool closed.’
This meeting I will relate in the fullest possible terms, etched as it is into my consciousness, every look, every word, every sigh the most exquisite poetry of the senses.
John didn’t know quite whether to feel mortified or impressed, the girls however, seemed to find the entire thing hilarious.
It was rather disappointing if he were honest, and he wondered if it had been worth all the trouble. The same faces swam before him, the usual boring Sunday night crowd of scruffy student types and city-boy posers, who thought themselves clever to frequent the most notorious club in the area, well known for a proliferation of illicit sexual activity and raided for drugs on a monthly basis.
“There…now we are fit to dress again”. He stepped over the side as I sank down again, catching up a towel, and throwing it down with a laugh again, “Sherlock, get out, for your skin will look like a withered old prune…perhaps I should have waited…it was too much”.
“That’s as may be, but if his father speaks the truth about a voyage, then I fear your John is lost now an ocean lies between you.”
“Sherlock”, he answered, “I can barely think for wondering at the sight of you, with your lily- white arse and cock bobbing free, get your drawers on now so that I might let her in”.
He broke into a run, Greg turning in surprise at the sound of rapid footfall as he leant against the wall outside the door and holding a hand up for him to stop before he could reach for the handle and let himself in.
John glanced around nervously, sure that anyone who cared to pay attention would see how horny he was. Victor he was pleased to note, had gone, probably off somewhere licking his wounds and feeling sorry for himself. Sherlock hadn’t even seen him.
“Of course I won’t…..and Greg darling, you might want to shut your mouth before you start catching flies…….Merry Christmas beautiful” she kissed John on the cheek and grabbed Greg’s arm “Come on you”
‘A lovely young man such as yourself shall do very well’ she said, in open admiration at my appearance.
“Will you beg for me Myc, tell me how much you want it…how much you need it” he dipped back between Mycroft’s parted thighs, tilting his arse to run a long teasing stripe with his tongue from the cleft of his arse to his balls, skimming lightly over his entrance. The ungodly noise that issued from Mycroft’s throat made his cheeks flame with embarrassment.
“Would you mind telling me why the hell we are currently in possession of fifty quids worth of fucking cocaine Sherlock?” John hissed as they made their way down the staircase and back out into the freezing air.
Greg Lestrade emerged from the house next door in the company of a grey-haired, overweight Detective Inspector by the name of Peterson. He was the wrong side of sixty, one of the old guard who always looked rumpled, like he’d slept in his suit, with a red veiny nose which revealed his on-going love affair with the whiskey bottle, and the yellow stained fingers of a rampant nicotine addiction (maybe he could bum cigarette, nicotine would stave-off the come-down) But for some unfathomable reason, Peterson genuinely seemed to like Sherlock, as in listened to him, and believed in him, not just tolerated his presence, or worse, tell him to sod off.
He trailed off and huffed in disgust, the door bursting open again to reveal his brother and a doctor, a different one this time and the same nervous little student nurse. Mycroft rolled his eyes at them both, and John patted his hair down guiltily, still mussed and sticking up where Sherlock’s hands had been tangled in it minutes ago. The erection was gone though, thank god.
John filled out the form in his best illegible future doctor scrawl, his head down as two blokes in muscle-tee's with bulging biceps covered in tattoo's headed past him through another door marked 'Gym'.
It was around eight when they got there, the walk taking longer after a detour to a stand of trees off a dirt track where John had made sure Sherlock knew just how very not straight he was now. Needless to say, it involved much sucking of cocks and fondling of testicles and absolutely no stray splashes of come on jeans this time. It was amusing to walk into the pub, seeing his hair messed up at the back and the way his t-shirt was crumpled at the front in that obvious way from the clench of Sherlock’s hand fisted tightly into the soft material. He looked untidy, and perfect, and fucked in the way that only Sherlock could tell.
“Hush now Sherlock” the voice seemed to come from far away, carried like an echo on the air as the scene began to shift again.
Sherlock trudged slowly down the driveway, ignoring Mycroft’s impatient huffs. His feet crunched on gravel which glittered like a sheet of diamonds in the chill night air. There would be a hard frost tonight. Faint patterns like summer leaves in bloom already wrote themselves onto the leaded window panes of the silent house as he left it reluctantly behind.
Jan's voice cut through the thin plaster walls. "Sherl! Client! Just give him a mo love, I've just put him in. Poor things got stage fright I think, so be gentle would ya?."
Sherlock steered him around and pushed him back down in his chair, his traitorous legs providing no resistance at all.
He gave a muffled yelp, quite difficult with a mouthful of cock as he felt his own cock disappear inside the warm, silky wetness of Sherlock’s eager mouth. He pulled off for a second with a wet pop, just feeling the suck and slide and watching those perfect lips stretched wide around him, wondering how the hell he had gotten so lucky and wondering if Sherlock had a slipped some Felix Felicis in his pumpkin juice when his back was turned.
“Behave then squirt…I’m just going to talk to Molls for a bit…have fun”, and the he was gone, bouncing over to the other side of the room to talk to Molly Hooper who had just wandered in.
Sherlock sat up bent over the side of the bed, rooting around on the floor for his t-shirt. It looked like a dish-rag, but he gave it a surreptitious sniff under the armpits, shrugged and pulled it back on, running his hands down his chest to smooth out the worst of the creases.
“It will not,” I said in earnest, “our friends would not reveal us, and besides, there is nothing to see here nor to accuse us of.”
“Well” John whispered, smiling into the curve of Sherlock’s neck “ It might stop you making quite so much noise, don’t you think?.....with your mouth stuffed full of my dick”
“You’re a bit fucking nosy kid aren’t you? What the fuck do you care where you get it as long as you get what you want eh? I’ve branched out so to speak, these fucking rich brats snort up a snowstorm, but you would know all about that Pretty, think I would forget a face like that?”
“Very eloquent John…Actually I do know him…quite well in fact, but he’s been off the grid for a while and I wasn’t sure…” Sherlock paused to cast a searching look at John, “if he was still alive or not”.
“John…I don’t….I can’t….oh god”. He could feel Sherlock tensing around him, the impossible grip around his cock grew even tighter, hot ribbons of come, pulsing out to coat his hand and splat upon his chest. Sherlock sagged a little then, as John milked the last drops from his cock, stroking him through the aftermath of his orgasm. It would be tempting to flip him now, lay him on his back so that John could pound into him, but he wanted it like this, Sherlock on top, firm lean body, strong thighs and taught buttocks, sweaty and messy and covered in come and so very fucking masculine.
But now, now, he was actually, for real this time fucking lying on top of someone drop-dead gorgeous who had basically given him the green light to do stuff and he still just couldn’t move that extra inch forward. What a loser.
“You came here tonight…some part of you wanted this Sherlock and you already know how I feel about you”
Sherlock pulled the offending jumper over John’s head and set to sucking on those puckered pink nubs until they were good and hard, while John fumbled with the buttons on his tight white shirt and pushed it off his shoulders with a growl.
“Cheers mate, thanks for the glowing recommendation” Greg said, accepting the mug that was pressed into his hands and taking a sip of the hot milky tea.
“What?” John spluttered, “You’re kidding me, right?” Because the thought of this elegant, confidant boy being unable to fly was absolutely ridiculous.
Well, apart from the embarrassing effect the kid had on him in that bloody costume, John didn’t see what all the complaints were about. Sherlock jingled and smiled and handed out gifts and any Santa (Yes I know there’s only one ‘real’ Santa) would be proud to have him as their elf.
“The timescale involved would seem to suggest that yes…..you obviously had no intention of leaving the immediate vicinity”, he looked John up and down, the t-shirt, the jeans, bare feet and went on, “and you were hardly suitably attired to venture outside…and so yes, l believe this was an opportunist attack, there was no guarantee that you would leave the room at all, but that does not mean there was no actual planning involved. There were cameras here, installed specifically for Sherlock’s protection when I arranged for him to perform here this evening, but at some point during the course of the evening someone has seen fit to remove them”.He scanned around the room again with narrowed eyes.
“I don’t know yet”, he lied, not sure how much he should give away as he glanced warily at the figure behind her, a hand laid protectively…or possessively…on top of her bird-like shoulder. The mysterious and elusive Frank Hudson, John presumed. In all this mess he realised this was the first time that either of them had laid eyes on him, because he was pretty damn sure Sherlock had never seen him before, or he would have described the bloke to him. He was average height, an inch or so taller than John and on the whole, unremarkable, a balding head shaved close to disguise the fact and a full moustache and beard trimmed quite close and neat in silver-grey. He had a slightly shrunken look, the suit he was wearing well-cut but too large which gave the impression he’d been a big man in the past but now, whether through age or illness, or something else entirely, he appeared rather shrunken. But still, there was steel in his eye, quietly cool and calculating as he looked John over, hanging back and saying nothing.
“Ask any one of the fucking morons in that place who William Bake is…go on” Sherlock gestured around wildly, words slurring slightly in response to the large volume of alcohol currently raging around his system. A bouncer on the door eyed them warily.
Mike was laughing harder now, there was nothing funnier apparently than a friends’ misfortune, especially if it involved naked body parts.
He snapped another picture, Greg this time, and smiled in satisfaction as his answer came through minutes later in the kitchen where Greg was brewing tea and rooting in the cupboard for the biscuit tin.
“I should make you do it” Sherlock shot him a dark look over his shoulder “half of it is yours after all”.
He stood up and let the duvet slide of his shoulders to bunch up on the floor, leaving John eye level with his arse. What choice did he have but to stare, skin prickling with the sense memory of having his tongue up there half an hour ago.
It could hardly come as a massive surprise. He’d scared the shit out of them both that night and the walls had gone up, but he just had to try…
Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and pulled him off to the side ignoring Greg’s suspicious glances and bemused expression. Peterson just chuckled fondly and shook his head, used to Sherlock’s whirlwind mind and eccentricity, here one minute and gone the next, dashing off wasn’t even odd behaviour considering some of their previous encounters. Inside he was reeling, this was getting more and more fucked-up by the minute.
“My parent’s house is ten minute walk, that way.” Sherlock gestured in a vague, Northerly direction. “So I already am home, unfortunately.”
“Might I offer my sincere congratulations Sherlock, you appear to have made it all the way to morning this time”
He heard the snap of a belt buckle and the hiss of a zip as he moaned like a wanton tart, John’s hot thick erection sliding down the crack of his arse. It was the ultimate tease, as John rocked back and forth between his lush rounded cheeks, slipping far enough down on each pass to graze briefly over his clenching hole. He bucked back in a fruitless attempt to impale himself as John chuckled darkly at his growing frustration.
“John”, he whispered in a rough, cracked voice sounding nothing like himself, “Take me home, now, please, back to your place…I…I want you”.
I wrote this to remind myself I can do sweet and fluffy sometimes - even if it's still all about the D though.
John wriggled impatiently, eager to be off now they were actually out here. He loved night flying, the sense of freedom and abandonment, unlike anything you would experience during the day, but he rarely got the chance living in a predominantly muggle town. He felt the back of the broom dip down under the added weight as Sherlock swung a gangly leg over and tentatively placed his hands around John’s waist.
“It is a common enough practise is it not?” I said, more desperate now, “The use of another alias perhaps? He may have done this a second time”.
“Sherlock will ride with me…we will take the track over the heath, then it is but a short distance…you can take the horses back and we will go on foot from there”.
His phone remained stubbornly silent after that, but that was okay because it wasn’t an outright no and at least that meant he was thinking about it, even if he was a dick for making him sweat, besides he knew how to fill in the time – there was a little surprise he needed to prepare.
We travelled in all haste to my new abode, pausing momentarily in St Paul’s Churchyard where my mistress alighted to make a small purchase, a pair of gloves, and from thence onward to where I now know to be a street just off Covent Garden Road. My heart soared. I would be close to my friend after all, and I vowed to inform her at the earliest opportunity of my good fortune, and to lay thanks of course for her part therein.
John shook his head at them both, “ Let me know when you’ve both resolved the sexual tension or just drop the cheesy innuendo….so is this guy starting before Christmas?”
“Yeah well, I feel like that about whoever gave you this” John traced a fingertip lightly over Sherlock’s face, making him shiver.
Sherlock stomped away from him down the corridor, hood pulled up over his head in an attempt to disguise the cigarette that dangled between his lips. John pushed against the flow of people, every single one of whom, annoyingly, were heading in the opposite direction.
“Don’t be an idiot, of course you are….come round at nine, bring a bottle if you can, mum’s gone OTT with snacks and dips so we’re all set on the food front, not that you eat anyway you skinny little bastard…just… it would be good to see you…please come”
Sherlock closed his eyes and leant his head back against the padded seat, the rocking motion, and the gentle rattle of the wheels on the road soon lulling him to sleep.
They stepped out onto the cool tiled floor and patted themselves dry with Mrs Hudson’s soft fluffy towels as if they did this every day, like their normal routine and it all seemed just too perfect and right. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to take John back to the living room then, to pull him back into their quilted cocoon, all day just the two of them, naked, before the rest of the world could interfere again.
He raised his body a little, hips still pumping rhythmically as he watched John wrap a hand around his cock, fisting it erratically in short frantic strokes
“Long enough” Sherlock admitted. He had spent an inordinate amount of time lately when he should have been concentrating on more cerebral pursuits, devising increasingly filthy scenarios starring the two of them. It was as glorious as it was maddening. But shagging John in his childhood bedroom definitely made top ten.
John huffed, a small laugh and ran his hands up and down the length of his thighs, warming the icy skin. He shuffled back a step or two and stuck his arse out further, in what he imagined was a helpful way, there was a height difference to consider, and he didn’t want to accidently abrade his cock against the wall.
“Well, well John Watson, that annoying little public sex kink has got you all hard again hasn’t it? You want to take me in front of a roomful of people, bend me over on the middle of the dance floor, shove your massive co………”
Sherlock must have been half frozen by now in his thin clothes, John thought, crowding in close to share a little body heat while he fumbled in the lock with his key, almost touching, but not quite.
“A fabrication borne of necessity… he is a prideful creature, and after our last exchange I knew of no other way to part the two of you. However, to satisfy your curiosity, Lady Watson is spending the summer with acquaintances of ours in Dorset. She is quite well, and am sure would send her regards.”
The first was a grainy blown-up shot of a much younger Sherlock, pre-Victor, therefore fifteen at most, propped up on the floor with his back against a saggy patchwork sofa with a definitely-not-a-cigarette clamped between his lips, just the bare dog-end left. He looked, in fact he had been, incredibly wasted. He remembered this occasion, a minor miracle when he considered how stoned he had been, it was the birthday party of a classmate, some double-barrelled trust- funded chinless wonder, the actual name unimportant. He grunted, unimpressed.
He aimed for sarcastic and cynical, but Harry as it turned out in her inebriated state, nodded enthusiastically. The daft cow thought he was being deadly serious, agreeing with every word. Then again, she was rat-arsed drunk, as usual.
A short(ish?) chapter (is 4k short?) to set things up for future installments - hang in tight cause shit's about to go down!!
“Sorry” he mumbled as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat and took a large gulp of tea, simply to give his mouth something harmless to do.
“I wasn’t bloody well talking to you” John rounded on Billy who surprisingly backed down, holding his hands up in a gesture of surrender. “And Doc? Where the hell did you get that from?”
John wrapped finger and thumb around one taught nipple and pulled, twisted and pulled again. Before he had time to even process the pain John was biting again, tiny red indentations peppered over his skin. Sherlock’s breath caught in his chest as he caught the nub of flesh and pulled hard, stretched between clenched teeth. It was too much, and not enough at all and Sherlock wanted this more than anything even though it would ruin them both.
“When you’ve quite finished mentally shagging me again, could you ask Greg something for me?” Sherlock drawled without looking up.
Sherlock tugged in irritation at the neck of his shirt, jaw clenched tight as he dragged the hated tie away again, the skin beneath burning at the sudden flash of friction.
God Sherlock. What did I tell you? Six feet safe minimum distance maintained at all times and at least two impartial witnesses J
I was poised to agree when the door burst open at our backs. The handle smashed into the wall and left a crumbling hole in the plaster.
“The gentleman on our left”, John muttered from the side of his mouth and discreetly motioned, “Sitting by the brewery wagon, why does he stare, do you think ?” I squinted to where John had indicated, my eyes adjusting slowly to the light, to where an old gentleman peered at us in open curiosity, and something else, a tension as he fumbled in his pockets, cast his eyes down then back up at us warily.
Sherlock sighs, because he knows it is never enough. It helps though, Irene’s games. An experiment of sorts, in the spirit of scientific endeavour.( It’s not as if either of them get any sexual gratification out of this). She likes girls and he likes boys, presenting the ultimate test to her skills…. How many times and in how many ways can she get him hard and make him come. Three times tonight, the crop, a good fingering and a blow-job.
I could not see John from where we stood beside the door, but I knew of a back room more suitable for a meeting place which the landlord had set aside for the use of private guests and diners with tables set out, candles at the centre, should the need or the occasion arise. I wondered briefly if this had been his object all along to have me dress in such finery so that we might dine together, good food, good wine and perhaps a little romance.
"And burglars don’t normally bring their own supper I imagine (her mouth quirked up in the ghost of a smile), Singapore chow mein from the Golden Dragon at the end of Baker Street no less, so I followed the smell upstairs and there you both were, all curled up, sleeping like babies. I hadn’t the heart to wake you” her smile was genuine now.
When he opened his eyes again, Sherlock was lying on his back again, with one arm behind his head, twirling a thick dark lock of hair between his fingertips. But what stood out, quite a bit, was the sudden lack of t-shirt and the resulting abundance of smooth pale skin. His stomach was concave and John could count a few ribs too and the hip-bones, Christ, they jutted out from his skinny frame lifting the jeans away from his body to reveal a flash of white underwear and the curl of dense black pubic hair.
“Just a little remainder that our time is up…sleeping draughts are notoriously difficult to judge, but if we head back now we shouldn’t attract any unwanted attention….that is, I hope not”
He licked into Sherlock’s mouth again and slipped a hand inside his coat to gently squeeze his waist. Sherlock could hear the faltering footsteps, the uncertainty and a scrape of a sole on concrete as the man continued down the street, the snuffling dog following in his wake. It was too nice to stop though, relaxing into the soft slide and plump wetness of John’s lips against his, moving forward as John parted his legs to drag Sherlock into the space in between.
“Fuck promises Sherlock…this isn’t part of some game. If you still want to do this I want to do it right. We’re going upstairs right now and I’m taking you to bed.”
John hadn’t seen that much of him so far, because he never hung out with the other staff here in the lounge. He probably went swanning off to some posh wine bar for lunch, and pissed daddy’s money against the wall.
John was no longer alone. In that moment of distraction, someone had approached his table and sat down, next to him, not across as he would have expected, and sitting much too close than any rugby friend of John’s ever had to his knowledge. The man was a good ten years younger than John and would have been in his early teens when John had played rugby.
John grabbed at the sleeve of his Belstaff coat and dragged him bodily through the crowd. It was much too warm to wear it indoors and a sheen of sweat had already broken out across his forehead, but considering the nauseating collection of ‘style’ on parade tonight, he thought he had made a very wise choice.
It was no use even trying to explain, because to Mummy he would always be a child, her sweet little angel boy.
Because if it was, if that was who John had always been, he didn’t know himself anymore, he didn’t know anything.
“T….Tom…?” the voice that escaped my lips sounded broken and lost, even to my own mind. And I stood agape, feet fixed upon the floor as a smile broke out across that fondly cherished face and he rushed across the room toward me.
“No, personal”, he shot back, “Now tell me…. does the name William Sherringford mean anything to you?”
There was only just enough to fill two dishes, but he would go without. Mother needed it more than he did if she was to get well, her chest had grown much worse during this recent cold, damp spell. John had spent long hours pouring over the medical book that mother kept stuffed in a wooden chest upstairs, and a pneumonia was his best guess. She could die if he couldn’t raise the money for a doctor, but he couldn’t tell Harry that yet, she was worried enough about the unpaid rent.
Why would I mind? Tom was as family to me now, and in the absence of my true kin, wherever the world may conceal him from my notice, my kind companion would be a most fitting envoy. And in John, I fancied, Mycroft would wholly approve in my choice of companion.
“Still feeling confident you would have beaten me anyway?” John leaned in close, making Sherlock’s pulse race, and whispered……
“Is this some sort of sick joke? Because this is so far from fucking funny…my sister isn’t dead, because believe me, if she was, I would be the first to know”
“If you want to keep going on this Sherlock, we need to work together…so, you have to tell me exactly what you know”
She still looked troubled. “That I don’t rightly know sir, but very insistent he was, said to tell you especially to wash that shaggy mop…..his words sir”, she added hurriedly, dropping an apologetic curtsey lest her words had caused offence as my hand shot up to my head. Sarah bobbed at the knees yet again. “Shall I have the water brought up now sir, or will you be needing some time to….”, she hesitated, taking in my filthy room, “put things straight”, her voice trailed off weakly.
This was the first real contact John had had with his brother since the infamous dinner party (he had it on good authority that Sebastian Wilkes now spoke with a permanent whistle down his left nostril) when John had assaulted a guest to defend his (non-existent) honour.
“How?” Sherlock was intrigued, usually only Mycroft picked up on his subtle emotional tells, and even then, only on rare occasions.
“Did I hurt you?”, he said after a tranquil few minutes, trailing his fingers up and down Sherlock’s back. “I’m sorry if I did, you know, might’ve got a bit carried away there…but jesus the way you….oh god….that was just…”, he trailed off again, not even sure what he was trying to say. It just had to be something, anything.
Mike just goggled at him in disbelief. He knew exactly how he felt, it was shameful not to even realise how lucky they were, just to be sitting here, where but for a simple twist of fate they might very well be there.
“Whoa there John…you look strung out there mate, has it got anything to do with Sherlock by any chance?”
We arrived at the Coach and Horses with time to spare, and taking a table at the back of the room, I settled myself to look around while John purchased ale from the bar. The tavern was a haunt of the honest working man, with good solid tables and sawdust upon the floor, there were men from the markets, clustered in groups and playing at cards, or eating heartily of pies and stews served by a buxom old dame with florid cheeks and a bosom that could hide a small army. She tipped me a wink as she passed, arms laden with pewter plates stacked high, brushing off advances from the somewhat hopeful patrons with practised ease, flashing her wedding band in good-natured apology.
Down the path, turn a corner, through a gate, over a low fence and up a metal stairwell to a low paved space. They stood, bent over at the waist drawing in long heaving breaths as the adrenaline ebbed away.
“What? Jesus sorry, drifted off a bit…twice in one night…I’m bloody knackered” he yawned widely just to emphasise his point.
“What?....so you….and whoever’s behind all this can torture me a bit more as part of some sick game?”
“Not at all” he passes the smouldering joint across and watches the cloying smoke disappear into the night air as John inhales, then breathes out again.
But what a fucking sight. John’s eyes took in the glorious image of perfect long limbs, a smooth pale chest and a stomach, tight as a drum and wash-board flat and the dark thatch of hair surrounding Sherlock’s cock. He palmed himself, completely unashamed in smooth languid strokes, thumb flicking over the head to spread the leaking pre-come down the shaft.
“Don’t look round, but there’s a short, skinny boy with black hair watching us from behind the horse-chestnut cart”
Bed…a bed would be good he thought, as his limbs turned to lead, suddenly so heavy and tired. Soft pillows, cool sheets, a warm naked body and…freezing cold feet. Cold feet. John. His bed. Pressing over him. Inside him.
He pointed in the direction of a large group of people, milling around the area behind the police line. The distinctive cropped red hair and tall, burly figure of Marcus Hunt stood, alone, dragging deeply on a cigarette.
Sherlock broke the silence, staring deep into John’s eyes, the dark-blue turned to black with desperation, barely held in check. He whispered darkly. “I see you…. see it in you….how much you want to
Christ, if he was this good at blow-jobs, what the hell would he be like on his back, with those endless legs spread open, or wrapped around John’s waist while he pounded him across the bed until they were both
Nothing broken, a split lip, an initial assessment as he gingerly probed his face. He’d done this before, that much was clear.
His head swirled and the room span, like an attack of vertigo, perched on the edge of a precipice looking down into the void, he heard an odd choking sound and vaguely registered that it issued from his own throat. He wanted to push that hand away, he wanted to suck those fingers into his mouth, he wanted to punch him, he wanted to push their mouths together until they couldn’t breathe.
“And what exactly do you think you are doing brother mine” he said as he entered the kitchen and snapped on the light, “Didn’t the lock pick work this time?”
We said nothing to rebuke his claim, for what was there to say? He had the right of it, and knew so, but fortune had favoured us in our association, and an ally on the side of the law could be of great value one day. He took his leave, and fixing his hat upon his head once more, moved swiftly through the midday hoard, exchanging smiles and nods with many, slapping backs and pumping arms as he went. Lestrade was well known and well liked in this place, unusual in his occupation and a mark of his character as an honourable man.
“Those two over there” Harry smirked, getting in first, and he followed the line of her outstretched hand keenly aware of the note of triumph in her voice, sniffing victory before they’d even started. “You’ve got no chance Johnny”, she crowed in delight, “The dark one looks like a Calvin Klein ad and the sandy one’s prettier than I am”.
After the requisite motivating period, Hope rose and grabbed a bottle of olive oil from his kitchen cabinet. He returned to find Strangerson bent over the kitchen table, proudly displaying his aching opening like a wanton prostitute. Strangerson had slipped two fingers into his slit, pumping them back and forth to show his friend how amenable he would be to their sexual encounter. The sight fueled Hope’s cravings to a feverish level and he quickly dolloped his dick with lubrication.
Strangerson turned a deep crimson color and shook his head, unable to even voice the words to a negative response. He looked at his best friend, who had blossomed in health after his rescue, and once again felt the warm stirring in his abdomen. Hope was certainly a striking fellow, his face austere and economical, who seldom took to smiling beneath his feathery moustache. Farm work had given him an imposing frame, with thick and hearty shoulders, though the manner in which he wore his long hair somehow softened him. When looking at Hope, the words of Joseph Smith always came to Strangerson’s mind—how the Prophet had written that male friends “should lie down on the same bed at night locked in each other’s embrace talking of their love.”
Strangerson squirmed, a hot feeling that he didn’t understand working its way through his belly. “The sin of young men,” he said, moving down to a whisper. “Abusing themselves.”
And with that, I fished out my own quite raging erection, eliciting peals of excitement from my audience. Several began to disrobe, touching themselves and their nearest companions with unrestrained lasciviousness.
In a moment the young fellow had dismounted, fastened his horse, and was ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object that had aroused his curiosity. He advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of a practiced scout. The watchers from the plain below could see him flit from rock to rock until his figure stood out against the skyline. He gave out a cry of alarm and threw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment.
Pulling the foreskin back, studying it carefully, I marveled at the object in my hand. Though I am a connoisseur of cocks, I know they are not always what one would call beautiful. Yet his was magnificent; evenly thick and immense, the slightest curve tapering upward to a perfectly rounded dome; the Platonic ideal of dick. Holding the shaft with two hands, I accepted Saul’s splendor into my mouth.
My nerve endings were ablaze as we reached the end of his shaft, the base of his cock resting against my cheeks. Leaning back, I teased his hole, tickled his balls, and felt the spot where his thickness entered me. It seemed almost too colossal to be possible. He began to rock his hips up and down ever so slightly, stoking my pleasure and provoking me to new heights. My dick dribbled fluid onto his chest. He wrapped two hands around my enormous shaft, which jutted outrageously outward, and squeezed tight.
“His titanic implement dove in and out of my aperture, causing my own member to rise once again. Napayshni’s broad chest pressed against mine as he came forward to kiss me, raising my legs high into the air. Changing the angle of his delightful ingresses also seemed to cause a doubling of its ecstatic effect. I didn’t know it then but Napayshni was hitting my prostate, a sensitive button inside every man’s tunnel that can greatly multiply his pleasure. I cried with joy and locked my legs around his back, petitioning him to pound me ever more.”
Here Hope stopped his narrative and looked up at his friend Strangerson, whose eyes were lit with a bright flame of candlelight. Though his heart beat fast in his chest, the convert felt utterly becalmed, as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He knew now that it did not matter what reaction he received, the telling of the tale had already been restorative to his constitution.
Hope could have laughed at the naiveté of this Mormon youth. “It is an action that comes instinctually to all men. In certain places, we are taught to suppress it but in other societies it is considered a trivial matter.”
I snapped around to find Holmes returning, a half-dressed man under one arm and fluted glass in the other hand.
Sherlock Holmes came over, his tie already loosened, his jacket gone, and placed his hand on my knee as he sat down beside me. “Are you having fun, my friend?” he asked.
In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons: and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristic of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.
“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I’m a sexual consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have many men who are looking to find other men to satisfy their proclivities. And since people of our persuasion must be inconspicuous, hiding what we do in the shadows, there is the penchant for misdeeds. I have always had a knack for spotting the cravings of other men, their likes and dislikes in bed. I enjoy applying my abilities toward interesting cases that might otherwise go unsolved.”
Even with this much readiness, this next part always took a bit of finesse and patience. I placed my erection against Stamford’s hole, pouring a copious dollop of oil on it. When I felt Stamford had relaxed the proper amount, I tipped my hips forward ever so slightly. As the head slid into Stamford’s quivering compartment, shockwaves of pleasure undulated through my body. Stamford no doubt felt the same, as his breath quickened and his eyes widened. He kissed me deeply and requested that I please continue. With slow and careful movements, I slipped farther and farther inside him, eventually bringing the base of my dick against his buttocks.
“He is sure to be at his laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either avoids the place for weeks, or else works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after supper.”
We took a hansom to Brixton Road. It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, prattling on about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati.
By this point, my erection was starting to strain at the fabric of my underwear. “Have you ever found yourself under similar circumstances?” I asked, realizing where our current situation was likely headed.
Strangerson cocked his head to one side, understanding that there was something unseemly about the poem, though not quite comprehending its underlying message. The innocent confusion endeared him to Hope, who wished he could provide a demonstration of the verse to the inexperienced young man. A trickle of sweat traced down his neck and he tugged at the starchy collar that was common among the Mormons. The barest sliver of Hope’s chiseled pectoral muscle became uncovered, causing another bout of distress in Strangerson.
Drebber stumbled forward, fell to his knees, and parted his mouth like he was partaking in a sacrament. The head of my cock came to rest on his tongue, causing an electric thrill to run through my spine. He closed his eyes, as if tasting the sweetest fruit plucked from the most tantalizing tree.
“The tribesmen took me to their healer, a hearty person with the build of an ox who wore the dress of a Lakota woman. As this healer undertook their ministrations, I came to understand that the shaman was in fact a man, or rather what the Indians called a winkté—a male who has a compulsion to behave as a female. His name was Napayshni Matoskah, meaning ‘courageous white bear.’”
Holmes continued. “A pocket edition of Boccaccio’s ‘Decameron,’ with name of Joseph Strangerson upon the fly-leaf. And a letter addressed to Strangerson, referring to the sailing of a boat from Liverpool. It is clear that this man was about to return to New York.”
Stamford took my breath away. He leaned against a wooden vanity in the low light, his body barely concealed beneath his undershirt, underwear, socks, and garters. The muscles in his shoulders were well defined, his abdomen a perfect specimen beneath the tight cloth. Fair hair sprouted from his legs, and I recalled how smoothly my own legs had once slid against them. His eyes shone like sapphires as he pushed the flaxen bangs of his hair from them.
Hearing a cry, Hope opened his eyes with fright. He looked up but found nobody in the vicinity. Embarrassed beyond belief, Strangerson had immediately ducked beneath the surface and was now shimming away back toward the group, hoping he would never have to discuss the events that had just occurred with anybody.
“Nothing of the sort. From a long train of thoughts that ran so swiftly through my mind, I arrived at the conclusions without being conscious of the intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran:
My lips slid up and down his cock, each movement bringing him further into my throat, and my face closer to his body. Pulling him all the way out, I squeezed his sopping wet shaft and then plunged all the way to the base, burying my nose in the curls of his pubic hair. I did this several more times, Stamford convulsing with unbridled delight.
“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”
“So thought I!” said Holmes, shooting a finger into the air. “And yet I knew there must be more. Considering once again the ruby ring and what had become of it, I wandered about the area, looking for a jeweler. My initial thought was that Strangerson had decided to sell it.”
His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd in his imagination.
My eyes met Holmes’, who gave a quick wink and addressed the woman like an old friend. “Hello, Bess. I trust business is well. I’ve brought a good friend to experience the wonders of your hall. This is Mr. Williams.”
Strangerson hugged his frame against Hope’s, wishing that by force he could almost merge the two of them together. He wanted to feel every inch of his friend’s physique against his own. The thrilling sensation of Hope’s body even through his clothing was already a greater joy than the young Mormon had heretofore experienced in his life. Hope’s lips against his as they pressed together their faces was a tangible reminder that such contact was among the greatest parts of human existence.
This inflamed him even more and he began to tear off his own jacket as we continued kissing, undoing the clasps and fasteners of his clothing. He pulled back his head, his hand bonded to the outline of my thick endowment, as if he could scarcely believe its existence. Giving him what he wanted, I tugged at the waistband of my underwear and allowed my enormity to spring free. A joyous cry escaped his lips as he first glimpsed my rod, proudly erect within its bushel of hair, a drop of precum leaking from its tip. I smiled. Seeing men react to the sight of my cock is a pleasure that will never grow old.
“Seeing that I was still unsatisfied, he took my hand and looked into my eyes. ‘I have a great amount of love,’ he said. ‘And, for me, love must be free.’”
“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had slept with thirteen men in the last two months.”
The cries of the foul birds awoke the sleeper who stared about him in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed. “This is what they call delirium, I guess,” he muttered.
Holmes looked down his aquiline nose at me. “Now, Dr. Watson, even if you hadn’t arrived here with our dear friend Stamford, it would have been easy for me to surmise your predilections. Your physique is like that of a French Bulldog, your authentic swagger suggests that the item between your legs is impressive. In pursuits, you prefer to take on the role of hunter. In bed, you would rather give than receive. Your greatly enjoy the feeling of a tongue pressed to the sensitive spot directly behind your testicles. And I suspect that you have been with approximately thirteen men these last two months.”
My companion smiled an enigmatic smile. “That’s just his specialty,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.”
My companionability seemed to help calm him once again and the fact that I had referred openly to matters normally approached discreetly furthered the air of familiarity between us. He took another whiskey and was on the verge of saying something before thinking the better of it. He formed a new question. “How is it that you and Holmes came to know one another?”
“Napayshni covered his enormity in lubricant and cupped my buttocks with his steady palms. While crouching below me, he pulled up my hips and then slowly lowered them down over his crotch. Remembering the training he had just given me, I unfastened my aperture just as his member touched the responsive opening. His colossal cockhead began to stretch my pucker. The sensation of my hole giving way to his enormous member is one that I will relish for the remainder of my life. I still bring it to mind when pleasuring myself alone at night.”
The woman bowed her head at the introduction. She was fortyish and wore a heavy coat over her fair frame, her raven-colored hair swept back tight. Giving me a secretive grin, she opened a second door into an even darker room. While my eyes adjusted to the low candlelight, Bess came to stand behind a small lectern placed in front of a lacey curtain. She removed her overcoat, revealing a scandalous kit—an ornate corset that cupped her breasts but left bare her entire arms and shoulders.
