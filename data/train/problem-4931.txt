break-up was hard enough on me as it is. I guess the only reason I haven’t just completely offed myself is because of my
But eventually it's time to head back home. Johnny and Wade don't even ask if they can join them back to Stark Tower; they simply follow them up to the penthouse. Peter shrugs off the suit, Wade loses the mask. Steve loosens the belts of his gear and puts his helmet on the table next to the door.
Okay, now he’s just trying to bait him out. Peter should ignore him, so why is he already balling up his fists, ready to throw the first punch?
Then, after pretending to be searching for a few seconds, Peter pulls out the two watch-like creations and holds them out to Mr. Stark.
So instead of talking with Aunt May, Peter takes his jacket – since it’s softly snowing again – and walks towards the nearest subway station. The drive to the cemetery isn’t a long one, and nobody’s paying attention to him while he’s walking through the different graves around him.
“Dad! Hey, wake up!” he shouts, but there’s no response coming from him. He’s in it too deep. Peter curses, looking around for something that might help him. He sees bloodied tissues scattered around, another one wrapped around Tony’s hand where he must have accidentally cut himself.
Dr. Palmer. Peter recognizes her from the pictures May showed him. She and Dr. Strange used to be together. It was the story of the century when the two had broken up, according to her. Peter nods at her, and she gives him a small smile back.
Steve’s scars are barely visible. His were smaller than Tony’s anyway, but while Tony’s is still red, Steve’s are now faint. If you wouldn’t know about it, you wouldn’t see them. Lucky bastard.
They go for a little while, but enough is enough. When Tony pulls away to drop down on his back and catch his breath, Steve, next to him, does the same thing. The super-soldier reaches out a hand, dropping it over Tony’s belly as if he needs that small bit of contact from him.
He keeps the crutches until he’s in the workshop. After that, he loses them, dropping them on the ground. He greets his three bots and Peter’s (which is probably only
He tries to keep calm, not to let it show, but she seems to realize that there’s something wrong. She frowns at him, about ready to open her mouth and ask.
“Maybe she does, maybe she doesn’t!” Okay, this had been a bad idea. Right now, Yaël just wanted to kick Nilla’s perfect teeth out of her mouth. But she had a feeling that the Queen’s plans were shifty and were going to be harmful.
“Look at me,” he told her. “We’ll make sure you’re safe, okay? There’s nothing going to happen to you as long as nobody knows.” Yaël nodded, jeez, she felt like a whining child, but she’d be alright, she knew that for sure, but not right now, sheneeded some time to recover from all of this and to let it sink in.
Tony promises. Steve nods, jumping over a fallen tree. He’s aware that there’s tears over his cheeks, but he ignores them as best as he can.
“Uh, and what’s good about that?” he asks in confusion. That’s when the two soldier suddenly start laughing over the laughing track in the sitcom the two are currently watching. As the crowd on TV finds amusement in whatever happened on the screen, the two soldiers seem unable to hold back their tears as they put their hands on their stomachs and try to keep it in, only failing at it.
“So I have my own override-codes and all?” Peter asks, wondering if he might be searching too far for it.
On the other hand, Fury wouldn’t pick up the phone and X literally told her she should call him more frequently if something was wrong.
Peter hums. He can get that way of thinking, but the people leaving him don’t always have a choice. His parents, Uncle Ben, Gwen… Sure, he’s far from alone now, but with Harry leaving, Ned heading off to MIT and studying really hard for it, and now all the other Avengers… The fact that he can’t spend one evening with his father without the two of them shouting at each other doesn’t help.
felt, back when you stabbed me in the back,” the Goblin hisses. There’s a punch into his face. Blood streams from Peter’s nose.
Seeing that it’s almost seven, Peter reaches into the front of his bag and takes out his box with medications, checking them over before taking them in with the glass of water that has been resting on his desk. After that, he quickly cancels his reminder for today.
After what felt like a very long time, Yaël had no real awareness of time anymore, she succeeded in gathering some stuff. Rolled up in a blanket, she managed to get herself in the bathroom with her friends, a pillow, the toilet, the shower, a few bottles of water and a bunch of bananas so she would at least have something to puke out. But this was no flu. The flu didn’t make her heart race or her inhaling arduous. The flu didn’t make the room turn and it surely didn’t make her faint. Though she felt like she was boiling up, she shivered.
“Since when do you guys go on patrol?” Peter asks curiously, sitting up in the bed and using his feet to pick the suit up from the ground. Once it’s in his hand, he puts the phone between his ear and shoulder and starts putting it on.
Suddenly, the old man lit up and turned into glowing dust, flying towards the sea. Yaël’s mouth fell open, did that dude just die? How? Wait a minute, she didn’t see Loki using any tricks to make the old man turn to dust. Maybe this man hadn’t been human at all...  Was this the Odin Loki used to tell her about? He surely could be, Yaël thought, suddenly noticing how much Thor looked like him.
Tony just glares at him. It feels like the apology from yesterday is just… forgotten. It matters no more. Peter balls up his fists, letting out a loud breath through his nose.
Wade sighed dramatically “For the love of God, are you always that picky? Besides, I won’t get older than this. I just have to wait a few years until he is an adult and…wait is he trying to escape?”
“Aaaaand now she’s officially Sam’s problem,” Tony jokes. Steve rolls his eyes but manages a smirk as well.
“My, uh… Aunty Peggy used to tell me about how she wanted to take you dancing, but she never got to do that.” Tony turns to look at Steve, grabbing now both of his hands. “I figured… I could take you, instead?”
"Yeah, you tell him, Mr. Captain!" Wade calls out, going through the channels so fast that it annoys even Johnny. Peter just rolls his eyes, heading towards the couch to hand both Wade and Johnny their glass. When he gets back to the counter, he suddenly notices a yelllow post-it attached to the fridge.
“Next time just tell me when you’re tired, alright?” Steve urges on. Tony shuffles closer until his face is resting in Steve’s neck. Steve just holds on to him, the two letting out a deep breath together.
Yaël still didn’t really understand what the hell was going on with the queen of Helvegen, but it was clear she had been planning on using Yaël to clear out the Asgardians. Bad luck for Völuspá, because Yaël had some more appealing ‘connections’ from team Asgard, even though Loki was a complete jerk.
The guards decided it took way too long for her to get up, so as she was still getting onto her feet, they each grabbed an arm and dragged her back out of the arena.
“You ready for the other surprise, Peter?” Tony suddenly asks, and Peter wonders how long he’s been wandering off. Natasha, Wanda and Steve are no longer in the room.
Of course, the mood isn’t that great to begin with. With the destruction in Lagos still fresh on their minds, everybody inside of the compound ends up being a bit gloomy. Even with the people who haven’t been present for the battle, it seems to rub off on them.
When Yaël was finally finished with raking all the leaves it started pouring rain again. Then the rain turned into hail. Freaking January.
“Oh, I was just telling Bruce here about it. I’m trying to give him dating-ideas for him and Betty!”
"Toby,” the older kid says, proudly. Peter gives him a smile, only realizing after a few seconds Toby can’t see it.
Finally, they saw the spaceships Korg had been talking about. Everybody started chattering happily, but Yaël heard a weird electric noise and signed to Korg so he’d listen.
He calls them up, but neither are answering. When he tries anybody else of the Avengers he finds out why that is.
Then he runs off, grabbing Eddie by the shirt and taking him along. Peter watches them go, grinning from underneath his mask. He turns towards Ned, seeing the guy still looking at him with his mouth open. Peter shakes his head, steps forward, and starts to wipe away the dust on his shirt.
The train halts at the next stop and Miles watches a couple of people walk out. On his way to Chinatown, he’s always hoping on coming across anybody familiar. Hell, he’d be super happy if he would ever just bump in on Luke Cage or something (though he mostly hangs out in Harlem), or heck, even seeing Spider-Man swing around town would really make his day. Though, he did come across Jessica Jones once when he was younger, and meeting her had scared the crap out of him. She’s rather intimidating, after all.
“Anyway, along with this really amazing woman and Thor’s annoying brother we escaped from Sakaar and hurried back to Asgard, where Thor’s sister apparently was causing all kinds of destruction.”
Some words are spoken, Peter can’t hear them, nor does he want to focus on it. Instead, he endures the pictures being taken by the press while he waits for any sort of instruction.
“I don’t think it will,” Steve says. “Peter knows how to get rid of it, he rejected it. Venom won’t risk being cast out again. He’s surely going to look for another host.”
Shit! And now she woke up, next to a FREAKING TEENAGER. She should keep her shit together, he’d think she is unstable if she’d show him how she was feeling at that moment.
“I don’t know, it’s just- you’re just so much more athletic than you pretended to be at school. Have you been working out in secret?”
“Tony, are you ready to go?” Bruce asks from outside the door. Tony stands up, with that accidentally getting a good view of his entire chest. He gasps in surprise, closing his eyes immediately.
“Steve, I-“ he starts, but he chokes, his eyes stinging and a sob escaping. He turns his head to the side, squeezing his eyes shut in an attempt to stop the tears. He fails at it. With Steve still sitting on top of him, the two men cry it out.
“AAAH!” Peter shouts out when the Goblin pulls him away from the wall, only to throw him back against it. Whatever is stinging into his back only hurts twice as much now. Peter shakes his head, feeling his breath slowly leaving him. “H-Ha-Harry! D-don’t do th-this!”
Oh what he would do right now to get out of the suit. As if it isn’t bad enough that everything’s spandex these days, he’s also still soaking wet and hurting all over. His wounds from the last explosion have barely healed, themselves. Maybe he needs to be looked at by Dr. Cho once more?
Charles frowned, well, by this time he probably already read what was going on in her head. Yaël scratched her hand.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve says before turning around again. “You keep looking out for us. We’re really grateful for that.”
“Peter, you’re up!” Steve states the obvious, clutching his cup of coffee tightly before heading back to the counter to drop it there. Then he opens the fridge and starts taking out some eggs and what seems like bacon. “I’ll make some breakfast.”
Tony hasn’t been looking all that well the past few days. He appears tired, exhausted; as if he’s not getting enough sleep at all. Peter has caught him rubbing at his stomach as well, as if the man is aching somehow, but doesn’t want to admit it. Tony’s been jumpy, on edge. Clearly, he’s not doing well at all.
“It’s curious, isn’t it?” Yaël asks, looking at the hammer with amusement in her eyes. Peter doesn’t say anything, sure that she’ll give an explanation anyway. “When the people arrived here, the first thing they found was Mjölnir, for some reason completely repaired.”
It was Peter who ended the staring-contest by asking if Yaël had a car, so Yaël put on her way too wide grin, just to bully Peter.
“Hi son, welcome home,” Steve greets Peter warmly. After nearing him, Peter leans over his shoulder to see what he’s working on. On the paper, Steve seems to have put down a quite accurate version of the city-line of New York. It looks simple, but at the same time quite complex in other ways.
“Peter! You look horrible!” Pepper suddenly says as she walks into his room. Not having looked at his reflection in the mirror, Peter figures that he might be looking extremely tired or something like that. He simply shrugs.
He’s already seated at his desk when the boy walks in, bag thrown over his shoulder and hair slicked back. He’s wearing a leather vest, and looks pretty much like one of those Greasers from those movies May talks about all the time. It looks weird.
. The man he hasn’t spoken to for the past two months. The man he’s been missing all this time. The second father he’s found himself without even searching for it.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, champ,” he whispers as well, out of fear to wake Peter up. “Tomorrow things will be better.”
“I should call Steve, tell him you’re awake,” Wade said, already turning around to go and get his phone.
He’s never felt more lucky than right now; his kid, right here. No matter how horrible life has treated him, he’s not unable to laugh again. And it gives Tony this weird feeling of wanting to pull him into his arms again, and never to let go. It’s only been 5 days, but this has been building up for much longer. That protective vibe he’s been feeling around Peter has been there since the beginning.
Despite everything, the relief he had felt back then when they’d finally defeated Venom, Peter realized quickly enough that the euphoria for it was pretty short-lived. After all, he had just lost his hearing in his attempt to rescue Eddie – who is now currently stuck in the psychiatric ward, having completely lost it after the battle. In any way, the heaviness that had been troubling him before was still there. With that, Mantis wasn’t yet freed of him. And sure, she keeps on assuring him that it’s fine, that she doesn’t mind helping him out, but Peter’s pretty sure that being his personal therapist can’t be that easy for her.
“Don’t play games, what do you know?” Yaël took another step closer and pointed at her sister. She was inwardly raging. Nilla tilted her head a bit.
When she was finished and shut off the water, she looked at the pile of fresh bandages and clothes, waiting for her. She was hopping towards her wheelchair when Loki walked back in again.
Life goes back to normal as much as possible. Sure, there are still arguments between Steve and Tony, but they’re smaller than they used to be, often talked through the very same day they occur. Tony doesn’t kick Steve out again, and Steve eventually becomes a legal owner of the tower as well. Meanwhile, May finishes the paperwork for the move. By the beginning of March, their old place is sold and everything’s moved back to the new house. It’s close to the tower, and close to Peter’s apartment, so it’s rather nice. Unofficially, Rhodey’s also kind of moved in with her. It’s good that she’s not alone, Peter figures.
Peter stands up, still frowning as he goes to where Steve instructed him. There he takes three plates and puts them down on the counter, resuming his search to find some knives and forks instead. The only sound he hears then is the bacon baking in the pan above all the butter, and the spoon mashing the eggs together.
“Do you know I was the only one who believed in you? I’m your Dad, of course I’m supposed to believe you. But everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a kid.”
Where is he? He should be here, shouldn’t he? Tony looks around, finding no sign of him. He should get out of bed, search for him. He can’t, his legs feel too heavy.
“Good,” Tony mutters. He huffs out a breath, pulling his head back until it’s resting against Steve’s chest. In his head, he counts to ten, taking slow breaths to try and relax his body. Behind him he can hear Steve hum out a song. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes when he hears it, finding himself distracted almost immediately.
His eyes sting when the memory of a video image comes back into mind, and he shakes his head, holding back a sob. No, not now. Not here. He needs to hold it together, at least until he’s told his story to Peter.
Updates are on Sunday's from now on, and hopefully I'll get more chapters ready so they can become bi-weekly again.
Either way, whatever he chooses, he’ll end up following one parent anyway; biochemistry would be for the career his parents had. Electrical engineering would be continuing in his new father’s line of work. Both subjects interest him; the first one because he’s always been good at it and could be even better, but the second because it’ll get him to make new things, invent new stuff, which is something he also finds himself doing most of his free time.
Tony looks back at the entrance, about ready to tell the kid to beat it because he’s in a hurry. But, the guy’s also just doing his job, and besides, he asked nicely. Most of the other reporters would have had their camera taking a picture before even asking.
“Yeah, uh, yeah! I’m coming!” he shouts, though his voice is shaky. Once he notices where his hand is, he snatches it back up, almost as if it’s just been burned. His face is warm. His eyes looking at his hand as if it personally betrayed him. He’s angry with himself, for giving in so easily on something he can’t describe. He’s never felt
“No, that’s not what this is all about,” a woman returns. Peter remembers her introducing herself as Heather a little bit earlier. She looks around Natasha’s age, with blonde hair that is put up in a loose tail and brown eyes that give him a kind look. “There are a few of us that
After that he hangs up. Tony wipes his eyes dry and sighs loudly. He shakes his head, and looks everywhere but at Peter, suddenly seeming ashamed about what just happened.
Tony lets out a soft breath, nodding to himself as he starts to head towards the living room. Catching a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror, any thought and doubt leaves his mind. Because this is it now, right? It’s taken a few years for him to accept it, but there’s no possible way for him to deny it anymore.
Right, so what now? Someone probably already called for an ambulance. Yaël walked back to the crashed car and saw Wade, already trying to crawl out of it. Some people were actually puking from looking at his completely disfigured face, which was already healing too. She could hear sirens coming closer.
After having survived the infinity war, everybody tries to get their lives back to normal. But while Tony is trying to face the horrors he faced on the battlefield and Steve is trying to keep his relationship alive, Peter gets to the real challenge in life; college.
Arriving at the Compound is just like always; he’s greeted by a few of the Avengers, heads to the kitchen to grab a coffee for him and Tony, and then he heads to the workshop to get some work going.
The Cap and Yaël look at each other a bit longer, and Peter just clears his throat and tries to keep his gaze everywhere but at the two of them. Then he bites his lips, getting his hands back out of his pockets to clap them together.
way. His insides turn from it at the idea of even doing this, but on the other side it gives him an immediate thrill as well.
“But what if they won’t take me seriously anymore after this?” Peter asks. “They barely even know me…”
Wait a minute, was it the stone that was trying to tell her something? Like, what, try harder not to die or you’ll end up like them? Or try not to mistreat your own body or you’ll never be able to save someone you love again?
Despite her stress, Yaël somehow fell asleep. She only noticed it as she was suddenly locked up in the glass cage again when she opened her eyes. This time, it was raining outside, which sounded soothing.
“Good, then do something about it,” he says with a wink before turning back to the movie. Or rather, he pulls out his cellphone and starts showing stuff to Yaël, who seems to have lost interest in the movie as well.
“Everybody get outside!” Peter shouts. Nobody needs to be told twice, running into the hallway in speed-tempo – Wade is last due to the fact that he can’t die. “FRIDAY, can you open the door?!”
“I never lied, Tony. Never to you, I promise,” Steve says. He takes Tony’s hand and pulls it away from the scar. Tony blinks a few times, staring at the place where Steve is touching him. He should pull back. He needs to step back.
“Love you, too,” he mumbles before drinking, eyes squinting shut as he takes in the bad taste of the medication.
He can hear her. She’s breathing slightly faster than normal. He can distinguish the low cursing she’s letting out. She’s struggling, probably trying to get out of the bindings she’s currently in. Is it an act from Venom? Or is it really her?
“Hi, Dad,” Peter greets Tony, surprised by his own cracking voice. He sounds hoarse, like he’s been screaming the entire night! What the hell happened to him?
Steve is a bit more hesitant. He’s looking at Tony sadly, but there’s no response from the other man who is now in a conversation with Nat. After ten more seconds, Steve stands up as well. He turns to Peter, and offers him a sad smile.
Then she’s gone, and the rest of the Avengers are left standing there with their mouths open. Nobody manages to speak. The silence is a bit awkward, and is easily broken when the door behind Peter opens up, revealing Tony holding a tablet in his hands. When he looks up and sees everybody just standing there, he raises an eyebrow.
“Today, Peter was me, and Harry was Bucky. Somehow, in a way, the Goblin has taken over much like the Winter Soldier did with Buck. Just imagine, after losing so many people at such a young age, wouldn’t Peter want anything more than to get his best friend back?”
“It didn’t happen, okay?” Steve mumbles against his ear. “Peter’s alright. He’s in class right now, he sent us a text only an hour ago to say he was headed to the campus.”
And Peter looks proudly at his creation; the Arc Reactor, on a little stand. The text he’s written out messily but as good as he can.
“Uh, thanks,” Peter mutters the moment he’s freed. He wipes his mouth on his sleeve, eyeing Wade carefully.
“Eurgh, couples are the worst,” she complains. Tony frowns, putting up his hand in a questioning gesture.
fell asleep, he realizes. Steve knows not to feel insulted by that; the man had been tired before they even began, and it was only because Steve begged him for it that Tony agreed to have sex tonight.
“Hey, alien-girl! You’re training with me today!” The voice pulled Yaël out of her thoughts and made her notice that she had almost put the fork, with spaghetti rolled around it, in her nose instead of her mouth. Yaël blinked a few times and stared at the red-haired woman, she needed a minute to let her words sink in.
Once her fingers grab a hold of the handle, it’s like a gigantic wave of wind emerges from her. There’s some sort of storm indoors all of the sudden, clouds forming above her while bolts of electricity paint the air around them. Thor looks up with wonder and excitement in his eyes. Jane’s hair goes up in the air, wild and… lighter in color?
Bruce returns. Natasha gives him a fond smile before hanging up the phone. She’s at least glad there’s no bad blood between the two of them. Whatever their small fling was – though it was sincere – it’s now completely over. Friendship and nothing more is what Natasha wants from Bruce.
And she remembered taking the bus for the first time, that was way too complicated for her to understand, with the paying and then following the screen that flickered and kept saying the same stop because apparently it was broken and Yaël somehow had to guess where her stop was and then she didn’t know she had to push the button so she missed her own stop. The bus driver got angry at her for yelling “STOP!” so loudly.
“Steve? Honey! I didn’t know you would be here?” Sharon’s voice asks. When Tony looks up, he can see his cousin – his freaking little cousin who is practically his niece – leaning up and kissing Steve on the mouth. Steve, who looks surprised by this sudden encounter, takes a step back before Sharon finishes greeting her… husband.
Tony’s had panic attacks before, but usually he’s alone or only with Bruce. This is the first time Steve is here with him. He’d rather have spared him of this sight.
“Go, then. Fix that nephew of mine. Make sure he doesn’t miss May’s birthday party in a few weeks because we’ve been planning that for months already.”
“You tell ‘im, Tony,” she cheers on lowly. Once again, she surprises Peter by using his first name like that. Tony smirks again.
“Well, when Odin arrived at the peaceful planet, which it was back then, he let Hela choose a name for it. It was hers. He actually wanted to name it Valdr, ‘ruler of heaven’, but nope, she wanted to go with ‘way to hell’: Helvegen. He should’ve noticed she wasn’t a normal kid back then, but he didn’t. So they recruited a few habitants to join Odin and one of these recruited people was your mother, because she was able to steer air and fire, something not many Helvegians were able to do.”
The elevator doors open. There’s the sound of two people bumping in against each other. Steve apologizes to who-ever walked up to him.
But when she sees Tony smile the way he does while he’s having a call with Steve, she figures it’s better this way. They’re not happy like this. It hurts to admit, it hurts
“You mean Mickey and Minnie Mouse?” Steve asks with a chuckle. Tony just grins again before squeezing Steve’s hand. After a few seconds he realizes he should let go for now; he’s already acting too much like they’re an actual couple, and their first date has barely started.
The nurse just smiles at him, but Tony can’t see that she doesn’t understand it completely. That’s alright, he doesn’t need her to understand. He doesn’t even care that he just announced to her that he’s in a relationship with another man. It doesn’t matter at all. Because Steve will forgive him for that.
“The action’s just coming from everywhere, isn’t it?” he asks as Sharon starts to collect her things. She just laughs nervously.
“Actually, I’m not-“ he starts, but he decides not to reveal it. It’s probably too much information, he already knows his face now after all. Peter Stark it is for now. “You don’t understand, sir. This man is like one of my Dad’s best friends, and he’s been missing for more than a year. It would mean the world to him if he would return back safely.”
When he’s grabbed by Venom again, the mask disappears, showing a breathy, exhausted Eddie looking down at him.
Having thought of the card this time, he swing it in front of the door to the balcony and it opens immediately without needing Peter to do another embarrassing speech to his father. He pulls off his mask, crashes down on the couch and starts up the television.
“Uh, I come in peace?” Tony asks. He figures he’s not that much in a friendly relation with these guys.
"That's easy for you to say, you don't even live here anymore," Clint counters bitterly. Tony smirks.
Yaël nodded. “Yeah, something like that. You know, if you see me do it, you’re allowed to make me stop. I’m not looking forward to a hand filled with scars. I don’t really notice it except for when I don’t stop for a few minutes, then it hurts of course,” she said with a smile. Peter nodded, he understood, it was some sort of signal for stress she unwittingly showed.
There’s a fist in his face. Tony accidentally bites his tongue in the progress, tasting blood in his mouth. With a grunt, he falls down on his knees. There are spots dancing in front of his eyes, so he waits until they disappear before he gets back on his feet.
“I’m this handsome devil’s roommate, we have a place not too far from here. You’re always welcome and all…”
“Yeah,” Peter just sighs out. He’s not getting closer to his answer here, and he’d rather have it by tomorrow so he could arrange the meeting with Stark if it would be necessary. Or at Oscorp, even though Peter feels a small chill at the idea of returning there without Gwen in it. No, that’s probably not such a good idea. Surely there are other place he could try out for biochemistry.
It’s weird, yes, but on the other hand he’s also kind of happy. Happy Harry has found somebody, and happy that now MJ, too, seems to be less of a jerk around them. Sure, she still throws insults their way, but they’re less… mean, so to say.
He thinks over whether or not he should give her a call, but after a moment of thought he comes to the decision of just getting to her place. She’ll surely still be there.
, rather than Iron Man. He remembers telling Steve that he was thinking of cutting down on the action – not completely, but just a little bit. Steve had respected his decision, and even stepped back from his role as the leader of the team. Now, the current team of Avengers is being led by Carol, who is doing a marvelous job at it, pun absolutely intended.
“See you tomorrow, bud,” Peter answers, and then he hangs up. He’s got other things to worry about than Flash, after all. And as he picks up the piece of the gun, his Dad’s voice rings through his mind one time.
Natasha gives him a blunt look. "I am aware," she responds. Then she nods back to the window, and Steve nods. Quickly changing into dark clothes as well, the two leave the bedroom without further thought. They don’t speak, they know better than that. Natasha tells him when to duck, hide, or when they need to run. Once or twice, Steve can see the flashlight of one of the guards nearing them.
And as Steve leaves the room, Peter and Mr. Stark continue perfecting the clothes. He only goes home when Aunt May asks him if he’s coming for dinner, and Mr. Stark lets a man called ‘Happy’ drive him back. And if Peter is smiling the entire time while he eats, Aunt May only seems to see it as him finally getting better.
When Loki noticed that Yaël was mentally searching for answers and trying to get the pieces together, he told her. “I always end up with you. Even though your wounds don’t flatter you, I don’t mind and I would probably mind if you were someone else. Even though I haven’t seen you in person for a long time, as soon as I saw you again, I was by your side again. It seems that I can’t stay away from you.”
This is agony. Tony rolls his eyes when Sam brings up another argument against it. Even Vision coming in between them with his ‘equation’ doesn’t seem to help the argument, instead making it even worse when Steve finally engages in it as well.
“Are you wearing clothes? Please say yes?” With those words, Yaël’s brain started functioning again, she was awake. Shit, was she wearing clothes or not?
Yaël helped him to get dressed, guided him to her sofa and served him a hot coco. Leaning with her elbow on the table behind Peter, she stared at him, but he didn’t notice. She kept an eye on him because she was afraid he’d shatter in a million little pieces in front of her, she was afraid his mental health would be completely beaten down after all of this, but most of all, she was afraid to think about herself.
By the time evening falls, Tony announces that they’ll be leaving again. Peter says goodbye to everybody, promising to stay in touch with everybody and exchanging out phone numbers and Facebook profiles, until a cab arrives to drive them back to the airport, where Tony’s private jet is waiting for them. Steve and Sam aren’t there to meet up with them. Peter figures it’s useless to ask questions.
“Yeah, that sounds so nice! What are you guys working on?” she felt glad that Peter just hopped into the conversation she started.
This isn’t supposed to happen; Harry knows, Wanda knows, and if these two people now know as well, he’s truly the worst at keeping secrets, which is weird since it’s been working for years already. Why now, all of the sudden, does everybody find out?
Following the hallway – there’s not much else to go to – he comes to an elevator shaft. The elevator is going down; somebody’s in there. Tony opens up the doors and lets the suit bring him down. There’s a loud thud once he reaches down on the car.
“It’s alright. I know what to do,” Peter returns. He quickly explains everything Gwen told him about how she got rid of the suit. “But it’s possible that the suit is going to fight back. You can’t count on my co-operation.”
Aaron shrugs. “I hate that the danger’s so close to you,” he mutters. Then he shakes his head and leans to the side of the couch to grab something. When he takes out a bag, he throws it Miles’ way. “Think fast!”
“Nah,” Yaël sat down in the sofa, next to him “I’ve been keeping it cold the whole time. I brought some old Superman-movies, by the way!” After fishing out the ice-cream, Yaël dug the DVDs out of her backpack. “I hope you like these? I don’t really know anything about it, but it sounded like a cool story.”
“FRI, will you warn Steve and Tony if I unknowingly try to kill Peter in his sleep?” Harry tries the moment he’s changed. Peter looks up in alarm. Does Harry remember? Peter never told him about it all?
“Good luck,” she whispers to him before she, too, is out of the room. She closes the door behind her, leaving Peter alone with Steve and his dad.
“Come on, guys, stop being gross!” Peter complains. “Dad, just start the damn machine!” The suit throws a punch Hope’s way, but she avoids it easily enough. Turning herself small again, she rushes towards him and forces him on his feet as well. That smallest of punch hurts the hardest, Peter realizes as he smashes back against a couple of computers.
A sting shot through her hand, distracting her from that memory. Yaël blinked a few times. Great, she had scratched her hand open again. As she put the wound against her lips, she noticed Peter hiding his face in the palms of his hands. She saw his shoulders shock softly. Right, she had to ease him, and she was failing at it miserably.
“I’ve been raised as a gentleman,” Peter assures her. She smirks even wider before putting her hands on his shoulders, suddenly pushing him back once again. Peter puts his foot behind him, realizing that there’s no more ground underneath him. Quickly, he shoots his web to the roof to stop his fall.
“Tony, there was an Everett Ross on the line, he wanted to talk to you about another meet-up for the accords so you can- oh, hello Peter, I didn’t know you were here?”
“So, she has some drama of her own sometimes. Who knew? I thought she was barely human,” Peter mutters to himself.
“Man, that girl really digs you,” Johnny says with a wink, poking Peter in the side. The bad side. After a flinch and a painful groan, Johnny’s eyes open up in surprise and he holds out his hands in apology. Peter gestures that it’s no problem.
And then the screen turns blank, and all Tony can see is the table through the glass. A breath escapes his mouth, and at last he gets back the movement in his arms. He leans back in his chair, raises his eyes to the ceiling, and tries to count to a hundred to calm down his nerves. What he would do right now to have Rhodey here. He’s not sure who stayed here, and who left, but he could figure it out.
“I felt like I needed to look after you two,” she admits, crossing her arms together. “I noticed a strong lack of
Uh, that was not his intention at all. What would she even want to tag along for? Who knows how long the interview could last? She would end up bored as
There’s the usual traffic. It’s why Tony wanted to leave early enough. He might be Iron Man, and he might be stinking rich, but even he can’t just bypass all the cars on the road. He’s aware of Bruce talking to Peter about school. The guy is interested in what Peter is seeing in his classes. With it being biochemistry, Tony isn’t too savvy on the subject. Maybe he should read up on it, no? He learns rather quick. It might be good for him to actually
“Yeah, Peter’s set-up needs a little bit more preparation,” Chrissy explains, handing both Steve and Tony a bottle of water. “By the way, thank you for the picture!”
“Obviously, I am,” MJ says smugly, slightly sticking her tongue out as she tries to outsmart Johnny. The latter just seems to have accepted the fact that he’s not going to win the moment he crashes against the wall and swings off the road.
“Come on…” she repeated to herself. Her arm and back began to ache from tensing up her muscles. But the brush did fly towards her and she could almost touch it…as it fell on the floor. “Shit!” she grunted. It had been so close.
Everybody stays quiet, obviously knowing not to make anymore smart remarks. That’s when Tony pulls up his phone, and brings up the research he did in the past couple of days since the MIT-presentation. Immediately, a picture of a laughing Charles Spencer comes up.
“Natasha can take over just fine,” he responds. “She could even handle the shield in the meantime. I mean, even Buck or Sam could if they want to.”
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve assures him. Thor, too, seems to find it amusing. He throws his arms over their shoulders, pulling them closer into what seems like a group hug. Tony groans in annoyance, but Steve finds himself laughing loudly.
Then Steve finally got up, put her back on her feet, grabbed her arm and ran off to a spot a bit further, more out of the fighting-zone, pulling her behind him.
He placed them on the coffeetable between them and put his suitcase back into a holder behind his wheelchair. It were photos of different people.
“Mr. Parker, I do hope that you’ve finished the assignment you were given? Or have you been too busy distracting Mr. Leeds, here?” the woman asks. She’s an old prune, probably nearing the sixties with grey hair that is always put up. Peter thinks for a moment, needing to recall which class this actually is.
According to Bruce, some of the ancient Norse traditions he read up on were pretty much followed through. Though when he asked Thor if it was mandatory for him and Jane to get drunk on the bridal-ale at the feast, Thor had laughed loudly and slapped him on the shoulder.
Peter tilts his head to the side a little bit when Storm walks up to the front and shakes the king’s hand. After that, they kiss each other on the cheek as a greeting. Tony turns back to Natasha and says something to her. After that, he heads back towards where Peter is sitting.
For the whole summer break, time moved slowly. Mostly it had just been Peter waiting for them to return, for the team to be assembled again. Next to that, the first few days had been spent arguing with Tony on whether or not he was allowed to keep the suit. It’s safe to assume to which conclusion they’ve come eventually.
“Psychiatric hospital,” he answers dryly. “Getting treatment for my depression. Which nobody knows about, obviously.”
“No I was just leaving,” Natasha says gently. She squeezes Tony’s shoulder once more before moving out of the hallway, leaving Tony with Cap. The two men just remain quiet when she’s gone, Tony instead looking back out of the window and letting out a sigh.
“Really?” Peter asks. He tries to lean forward and catch Johnny sitting next to Reed, but the guy’s not in his seat.
“He’s been better. We’ll fight through it,” he assures him. “I suggested he stayed home for the wedding, but he refused to hear it.”
“Honey, you sure you’re alright?” Tony asks, sitting up for a bit. Peter stops in his tracks, putting a hand against the wall while the other reaches for his chest. His dull eyes turn to look at the two, though Tony’s not sure he can actually see them.
Peter sleeps in the suit. It’s not like he has another choice, really; ever since realizing that there’s something wrong with it, they’ve tried many ways to take it off. They’ve tried cutting, pulling, freezing. They’ve thought about burning the suit, but they couldn’t try that without risking Peter’s health, so they decided to skip that one.
“Steve,” she hissed in a dangerous tone that made Steve look panicked, “I swear that if you are going to keep this from everyone, I’m going to visit Tony, even though he doesn’t like me. If the church is really more important than the one you’re in love with, then break up already, because- because…, fuck you!” Okay, her comeback wasn’t that great, but Steve seemed to understand the message. He looked a bit hurt for a second.
. Steve had pulled his punches, that much was clear, but the fact that they were fighting together and they weren’t at the same side… No, Peter doesn’t like it one bit.
“I don’t care, you are injured,” Steve counters. Getting to the elevator, Tony slumps into his chair, throwing his head back and looking at the ceiling above him.
So there might be a slight, small possibility that Tony Stark, genius billionaire playboy philanthropist superhero, could maybe be his father. Sure, okay, his mother might have slipped up with him
“I’m sorry, that didn’t work, can I try calling another number?” he asks. The girl shrugs, holding up her arms to indicate that he can do whatever he wants. Peter nods thankfully, typing down the number he knows by memory. This one takes a little bit longer before it’s picked up.
Peter lets out a long breath from his nose. It’s good news, at least. He’s happy for Rhodey that Shuri’s treatment worked. He doesn’t answer to the text, though. He doesn’t really feel like it. Instead, he drops the phone again and bites his lower lip. His eyes go to the window, still without curtain since he broke it the last time. The light of day is shining brightly inside. There’s a sound in the apartment, Johnny’s probably awake.
"This is a post-it note with my name on it," Steve states after that. Tony grins again, wiggling his eyebrows with a playful smirk. Steve's face turns bright red again after that. Peter feels shivers go through his entire body.
Ah, well, at least for an hour people will be rid of the annoying Deadpool, Peter figures. But that doesn’t remove the fact that, right now, nobody’s driving.
“Try to get an appointment with Stark’s assistant, and she’ll put you in the books. They take these scholarships very seriously. If you’re a smart lad, he’ll give you a chance.”
“But The webs are black, everything is black; there’s no trace of color left in the suit. It looks kinda badass,” Peter continues on.
“I must say, I only expected you would come to me to say that there was something wrong with the arc reactor. I’m surprised you actually managed to fix it,” Mr. Stark says, sounding impressed. Peter feels his face flush red, but he tries not to let it show too much.
Oh, this must be why he wasn’t at the last Goblin-fight. Mr. Stark has his fingers bandaged together. In one way or another, he must probably have broken them. Letting him stay behind surely must have been Cap’s idea, then.
“We’re fine, how are you?” Steve asks. Tony wasn’t quick enough to respond given that both his arms are stuck around his family. LL, along with the crowd, starts laughing once again, obviously not used to getting that response.
There’s no robberies, nor any muggings. Even after half an hour of just wandering around and listening to everything that his happening around him, he finds that there’s not much action at all. He’s about ready to head back home, still, when he suddenly finds a group of teens on the street.
“Uh, you want to come in?” he asks before thinking better of it. Then he slaps his forehead for that comment. MJ just smirks at him.
“It’s after school,” Wolverine mutters, fishing out a cigar from somewhere in his jacket and putting it on regardless of being inside. “Kids are at home.”
Yaël wasn’t able to breathe anymore and tried to scratch Hela’s hands open. At the same time, she still managed to keep dehydrating the furious woman that was tilting her by her throat.
Steve mutters. Tony turns the camera to somewhere on his left, revealing Steve lying down in the bed, on his stomach with his arms under his pillow. He looks tired, but he still manages to pull off a smile for Peter.
Hope closes her eyes, unknowing of what to do with the praise. Tony squeezes her shoulder once again shortly before letting go. He turns back to the couch, where he can see Scott sleeping against Bruce’s shoulder. Bruce is still talking with Steve about something.
Tony shakes his head as he finishes his sentence. “No clue. They’ve left a few messages to report what they’ve gotten so far, but nothing about when they’ll be back. What, you’re missing Wanda?” Tony wiggles his eyebrows, and Peter pokes him in the arm in return.
His head looked like an enormous raisin. It didn’t bother her though. She guessed she was used to worse, but she wouldn’t know.
Peter nods. “That would be awesome,” he says. Then the two say goodbye, and go their separate ways. Peter is grinning the entire way to the car, and even before he can step inside of the vehicle he grabs Tony and gives him another strong hug.
“I wasn’t much help,” she returns, sounding disappointed in herself. Tony shakes his head, putting a hand on her shoulder and turning her around so she’s looking at him.
Opening the rest of the hallways went very quickly, as Korg had already gathered a small army within a few hours, so guards didn’t even have a chance against them anymore. Not that they ever had against Yaël. The rest of the exit-locks were opened by the keys she had stolen, by Miek’s knive-hands or by Yaël’s air-fiddling.
“Mach gjøre in innsatsvur å snechen Sil til meg!” At least do the effort to speak Sil to me, Yaël threw back at her sister. Hadn’t Yaël made Nilla stab herself multiple times back on Helvegen? Oh, right, she climbed back up again after that, the painless twat.
“Hmm, biology stuff? Way out of my league, sugar,” she says without looking up. Peter keeps on walking and she follows easily.
“Of course!” Tony’s cousin almost shouts, happy that she’s getting the chance to help out. Tony and Bruce stand up simultaneously, though Tony has to hand his tablet over to Bruce so he can take his crutches in hand. Together, they leave the living room behind them, getting back to the elevator to get to the workshop.
“She’s got two weeks off at the beginning of summer break, she told me. Maybe I can arrange for you two to go to France for a few days? Get tanned in the sun, take some time to breathe?”
Good, that’s good. Peter really doesn’t need another lecture like the last one. He’s still young, of course he’ll make mistakes!
Feeling his chest heat up inside of him, he barely catches his hands letting go of her wrists, putting one of them behind her head and pulling her closer. Whatever he’s missing, it’s probably not that important, right?
“Listen, Mary, I know it’s a long shot and you’ll probably never believe me, but I have to try,” Tony starts with his hands up in the air to stop her from talking. He takes a deep breath and starts. “I’m from the future, Peter’s extremely sick and it’s because of something that didn’t happen in this year, which is why I’m here.”
“Hypothetically speaking; if you would go to sleep in bed and end up waking with a black version of the Spider-Man-suit in the middle of nowhere, what kind of explanation would you give that?”
Tony returns. Peter rolls his eyes at the nickname he’s earned himself lately. Tony’s been using it more and more whenever he wants to embarrass Peter a bit. The two hang up. Peter shakes his limbs loose, throws some water into his face and then lets out a long and loud breath.
for a year!” What the hell?! A whole year? She knew she had been in a coma, but no one ever told her how long she had been out.
Peter nods, glad she doesn’t seem too insulted about him reading into his past. She then silently hands him the journal back.
noticed a lack of big crimes lately, often finding himself just chilling out on the roof with only Karen to keep him entertained.
“Exactly, thank you, Clint,” Bucky counters. Wanda doesn’t say anything, except for staring at Steve with large eyes. Then she takes a few steps forward and reaches out her hand towards his face. With a thumb, she wipes away a tear that started rolling over his cheek.
“Dude, what happened to you?” Johnny asks. When Peter turns, he finds the boy seated on the couch, going through the channels with a bowl of popcorn on his lap.
Another moment of hesitation coming from FRIDAY, and then suddenly the door opens, revealing a light hallway in front of him with multiple doors on each side of the hallway. It looks very much like a psychiatric ward in all those movies.
“Tony, I’m so- I’m sorry! I’m so, so sorry,” he keeps on muttering against his own wrist. Tony, still too shocked to move, tries to control his breathing first.
Then, May offers a simple solution by leaning back and rubbing her eyes before standing up. She lets go of Peter’s hand and starts stretching her arms.
“I’ll take this one, then,” she says with a wink. “Now, let me make my ‘before’ picture before I have to go.”
“You’re no fun,” Tony mumbles. Meanwhile, on the screen, Kenny dies again and the two boys get out their iconic lines.
“NO!” he shouts, throwing a web somewhere against a building and using it to keep himself from being completely sucked in. Next to him, he can already see Steve and Tony losing their battle with this strange gravity. In their individual portals, the two of them suddenly disappear. As soon as they’re sucked in, the portal made of light disappears as well.
Though, even in this kiss, all he asks in return is that Steve never leaves him without any good reason. That Steve stays by his side, guides him through the worst. That, while Tony will take care of him, Steve takes care of him in return.
“Damn it Peter, stay with me, you hear me?! Don’t you dare leave me! Just stay with me!” Tony grunted. After a little while, he let Peter’s head rest on his shoulder while supporting it, trying to keep his son close while letting out more sobs as he begs his son to come back.
The lights turn back on. The Avengers, one by one, start joining up in the hallway, surrounding them. They’re all laughing, looking happy and joking around. Peter feels the joy coming out of them, and is glad that he got to be a part of it.
“You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about a nickname to give you, Parker. Everybody gets one from me. But I think
Peter turns to observe Dum-E next to him. The bot has his camera pointed at Peter, watching as he slowly but surely eats the banana. After that, he opens up his claw and grabs Peter by the shirt again.
“What is going on?” she asked Loki. His smile showed he knew exactly what was happening. Immediately after her question, Thor jumped down from the palace onto the Rainbow bridge and with that crushing down dozens of Völuspá’s zombie-army. “Wow, he’s in the zone, alright,” she mumbled as she watched Thor knock down enemy after enemy, using his lightning.
But by the time that she gets home, he still can’t find anything to say. He’s got only his messed up mind to think with and, honestly, there hasn’t been any opportunity to think of a plan. Right now, all he wants is for Gwen to be here.
“Show me those drawings,” Tony says, taking the pieces of paper Steve hands him and giving them a look. “You know it’s illegal; you’re like the most beautiful man on Earth, the kindest, super strong
For a second, she thought Loki was going to yell at her, looking at his clenched jaw. But for some reason, he relaxed and spoke to her calmly.
“Hell no, they mostly fight because of me, lately… Though I guess now I can blame it on the suit.” Gwen chuckles, but nods back towards the compound.
Then he send her a selfie, making a peace-sign with a freakishly small hand. In the background there was only sand and rocks, like he had said. Yaël typed an answer.
“I love you,” Steve utters out. “I love you so much, I feel like the words fall short, like they can’t express just how much I care for you.” Steve’s hands are rested on Tony’s cheeks, his eyes looking at him sadly, but also full of adoration. “But I just don’t know if I can help you, Tony; Last panic attack you kicked me out and I stayed away for three weeks or so.”
Vision hurries up to Wanda the moment he sees her. Everybody makes an ‘ooh-‘sound the moment the android pulls her into his arms and kisses her on the lips. A few of the audience even start clapping and shouting enthusiastically. Behind Peter, Tony, too, starts clapping his hands.
Entering a large, open room, Tony’s screen suddenly indicates the presence of heat signatures. Immediately, his mind goes into alert, and he stands still, motioning for both Steve and Barnes to hold still for a moment.
“He’ll explain it when he comes by tomorrow. Something about accords? He’ll be at the compound at eleven,” Tony answers, not trying to get too deep into this now. He really doesn’t think he can handle it, right now. “I’m glad you’re back, though.”
Then she hurries off after grabbing for her bag. Peter feels his mouth fall open from the surprise, and Ned, too, seems just as confused about what just happened. Harry sighs with a stupid smile on his face, sounding like the cliché love-struck fool from those movies.
When the week is finally over, and the day arrives, they don’t leave at seven. Instead, they’re, all three of them, thrown into the make-up chair. Tony’s pretty much used to it, and Peter by now also has a bit of experience with it since he always needs it done whenever he goes out as Peter Stark. But Steve, the poor sob, seems extremely uncomfortable having a woman pressing brushes against his face.
“Oh, your husband?” Jeez, husband, she was only twenty-four! But maybe she just had to follow his game and tell him that Peter, indeed, was her husband.
“Night, Hap,” he returns lowly. After the door closes, Tony turns to his side, the phone still pressed tightly against his chest. In a way, it feels like a small part of Steve is with him now.
“I can get why she would want to do it. It would bring me some peace of mind, as well,” Tony admits while focusing on the computer in front of him. If Peter can see it right, he’s making some adjustments on FRIDAY’s code, which is not to be taken lightly. He suspects it has something to do with what happened yesterday.  “You might not realize it yet, but the Avengers really seem to have adopted you into their weird family.”
“Smooth, Barton,” Natasha suddenly says, taking Clint’s place at the door and leaning up against it. With an unimpressed glare she looks at Steve. “You’ve got to be kidding me, right? The all-responsible Steve Rogers couldn’t even get showered in time? You smell like sex.”
Tony hands her the picture again. His left wrist moves with ease again. That’s good. So do his fingers. There’s no stiffness in them anymore.
“The church won’t accept it! Unless…” The church was no belief on its own, Yaël wanted to say, but she was curious what Cap was up to.
“Dude, is it always like this?” Harry asks while laughing, nibbling on his bread. Peter rolls his eyes.
Then, another paper. This time, Peter doesn’t open it immediately. He pretends to pay attention to class, writes down some notes of a lesson he already understands plenty, and gets up when the bell indicates the hour being over. Flash’ paper is now tucked into the pocket of his hoodie. He hands in the extra homework he did to get extra credits, gets a content nod from the teacher, and then hurries back into the hallway, grabbing his cellphone once more but seeing that he still has no new messages.
“Good.” Yaël kicked off her shoes as soon as she walked inside her apartment. She went to her bedroom and tried undressing herself with just one hand while holding the phone with the other. It had been a long working day and after installing a new fence in someone’s garden and painting it, Yaël just wanted to go to sleep. “I should call him tomorrow, shouldn’t I?”
“As if! You haven’t been right since after what happened at the war!” Rhodey returns. “Have you even told Peter yet?”
They’re arguing again. Peter can hear it through his door, hear them shout at each other. Usually it’s about stupid things; who left the toilet seat up, who forgot to hang up the laundry… It’s always something silly like that.
“C’mon, we’re losing time,” Yaël says, pulling Peter inside the car. “We need to get to Stark Industries.”
Was it a post-apocalyptic world? Was humanity nearly wiped out? He doesn’t know if he can ask. Steve won’t talk about what happened behind his portal. He’s just sprinting towards Tony, kneeling down the moment the man falls down on the ground, looking worried instantly.
“Yeah, been busy,” Tony says, leaning against the wall. Peter frowns when he sees the massive black eye he’s sporting. Holy crap, he’s been busy, indeed!
“Hey, uh, Ned. Any chance you brought your laptop along?” Peter asks, trying to sound casual about it. Ned frowns.
“Come on, Tony. Things are finally looking up for us,” Steve assures him. Tony sighs but then he nods.
He tries to sound threatening, but he wonders if it really comes over that way. He should better just go home, it’s already dark and he still has a bit of homework he needs to finish. He starts running before pulling himself back up into the air, swinging his way back to Stark Tower.
“Anthony? Is that you?” she asks. Tony smiles and then nods at her. Peggy reaches up a hand and passes it over his cheek. “Look how handsome you are.”
“Here’s my champ,” he says, kissing him on the head, very much as if Peter’s his own son. And Peter loves every minute of it. He doesn’t even mind when May, who has taken out the camera, makes a picture of them standing there. “I’m so glad to be back.”
“You’re old enough to be my uncle,” she counters, poking him in the shoulder. Then, looking over his shoulder, her face falls again. “I, uh… I didn’t know you would bring Captain Rogers?”
“Is he dying?” he asks, not knowing what he’s going to do if that’s true. He’ll probably just abandon ‘family’ once and for all and just go and live as a nomad through multiple countries. Tony can’t die, that wouldn’t be fair. Not when Peter only just got him in his life.
“Thor,” Yaël answered a bit flabbergasted. “How are you able to remember my name, only during fights and immediately forget it afterwards?” Thor shrugged and then patted his brother on his back.
“Good morning,” she greets them while Bruce closes the door behind her. Nobody responds to her, so she continues. “How are you feeling right now, Peter?”
He’s got a point there, but Peter just wants to make sure, of course. Not that he minds, of course. Last time he’d been to the tower, the Goblin had kidnapped him in an attempt to get Iron Man off his trail.
If Peter can get a chance to make things right again with his former best friend, you bet he's going to follow that chance, no matter how stupid the idea is. Because that's the point; he can't think about this rationally.
With his hands grabbing hold of Steve’s jacket, and his head pressed against Steve’s back, the two drive away, towards the facility.
Tony sits back down, throwing his feet on the table while grabbing some weird rubix-like-cube that has been sitting on the table. It’s the next form of puzzling from what the social media said. Tony figured it out in three minutes.
Once they’re sure they’re alone Tony heads back down. He removes the suit soundlessly, though is extremely aware that Mary is staring at him with wide eyes.
MJ doesn’t talk to him. Well, she does, but she doesn’t actively seek him out. Whenever they see each other, she greets him. When Peter starts up a conversation, she doesn’t run off or curses him out. She’s friendly enough, which is probably all Peter could ask for.
He’s not in the tower, he’s at Stark Industries, on the balcony of Mr. Stark’s penthouse. The arms that he thought he had wrapped around himself aren’t actually his own, but the inventor’s instead.
“He knew about it?” Bruce asks. Tony nods, putting a hand on his forehead while he tries to think. “Helen has one of the spiders. She said Peter gave it to her a few years back. She analyzed it and stored it somewhere afterwards.”
“Hello?” he asks once he picks up, making his way out of the café. He curses himself already for forgetting his coat inside.
“Atta girl!” Yaël said as she slapped Peter’s butt when she walked passed him to leave his room. And for a second, she asked herself if this was how it felt like to be a big sister.
“Oh, Peter,” Steve whispers next to his head. His hand goes straight to Peter’s hair. Peter grabs on to his back, not wanting to let go at all.
“We can talk like this, everyone can see me,” he said while following her inside. She looked at the timetables.
“-Thanos isn’t somebody you can just run away from, Yaël! No matter how you turn the story, we, or for sure you, would be dead at the end of it. I did what I could to keep you alive!”
So he goes to the workshop, lives through the loving greeting from Dum-E, U and Butterfingers once again, and sits himself down at his desk while the bots go out their way to get him something to drink. As usual. He doesn’t even stop them.
Once Mr. Stark returns with a steamy cup that smells a lot like a hot chocolate, Peter takes it over with lightly shaking hands, offering the man a small smile in gratitude.
“Why is my coco getting warmer with every sip I take?” Wade sounded confused and poked around in his cup with a spoon, like the spoon was going to present him the answer. Oops, well, luckily she had been unwittingly warming chocolate milk instead of warming Wanda or Wade themselves.
After that, the guy leaves again, suddenly noticing somebody else behind Peter. After a snort and an eye-roll, Peter heads out with his bag over his shoulder. He steps a bit further away until he gets to a little alleyway. There, he quickly grabs his red-and-blue suit and changes clothes. Stuffing his normal wardrobe back into the bag, he hides the thing away
Peter nods, loosening his shoulders before giving the dummy Natasha broke earlier a hard kick. Much to her surprise, it flies right off the ground and lands against the wall on the other side of the room. With wide eyes, Peter gapes at the sudden destruction he’s caused.
“It’s a long way from ‘honey’, but at least it’s not ‘Rogers’ anymore. Can’t complain about that,” he shrugs. Tony passes his hand over his forehead. Peter shakes his head and hums to get their attention.
“I just know things; how’s MJ, by the way?” Wade asks, looking as if he’s not freezing to death in that ice-trap the girl made for him. Peter frowns upon hearing that new name. When he looks at the girl to ask if that’s her name, she just shakes her head in denial.
“No way, I got mine before you?” Peter asks in confusion. That earns him a glare from the girl and another chuckle coming from Steve.
“The power of the sun in the palm of my hand,” Tony hears him mutter. He frowns for a second, wondering why the guy is talking to himself. But he can recall that Otto’s always been a bit… labile. People often mistook Tony as a mad scientist, while he’s only just very eccentric. Otto, on the other hand, is coming closer to the description. With all the troubles he’s had with his mother in the past, as far as Tony can recall, he’s never really been stable mentally.
With the way he’s internally freaking out, this is the exact moment he would have taken to just go at Gwen’s place and chill out for a bit. Of course, he can’t go to her anymore, but Peter quickly remembers that he has friends now.
No one had an answer to that. Yaël understood, it was kind of weird that she knew so little about the world. They were walking up to a pond in the middle of the park.
“Charles, tell me, isn’t he just the greatest man alive?” Tony asks while entering, noting Charles seated behind his desk with Steve standing in front of it. Charles is smiling lightly, probably having sensed his presence beforehand. The smirk gets even wider when his eyes fly up to Steve.
Of course, Tony is Tony. He wouldn’t recognize somebody being in love with him unless they’d tell him specifically, and even then he wouldn’t believe it until it’s said at least a hundred times.
“Harry, let me down!” Peter returns. He knows he can’t shoot anything into his face, because falling from this high would certainly be lethal, and he’s not sure he’ll be fast enough seeing as how high he is. The glider keeps on bringing them up.
They’re eight hours into their flight when Tony wakes up again. His neck is stiff, and he could really use a little walk, so he gets up. One small look through the little windows, and Tony sees they’re still above the ocean. He decides not to disturb the pilot. Just a quick little visit to the bathroom.
“C’mon, Dad,” Peter says on his right. Tony lets out another cough as he tries to fight through it. He needs to find his eyes, how does he open them? But, he knows where they are. They’re on his face. The problem is that they’re feeling extremely heavy. As if something has been dropped on top of it.
“Nothing much, just a talk with Mr. Stark to get an internship at his company,” Peter says in a soft shrug. Steve then smiles at him.
The man holding the gun raises an eyebrow, and looks at him, seeming unimpressed. “Alright,” he says, turning until his gun is pointed towards Peter. Then Peter shoots it out of his hands and runs towards them. The man, the buyer, runs off to safety. Good, he doesn’t need to be here.
Having left his old suit in his locker the other day, Peter hurries to it, quickly changes in the bathroom. He leaves the tux there.
Tony nods before looking around for a bit. When he looks up, he notices something small in the corner of the wagon. A wide grin appears on his face, and Tony points towards the camera hanging there.
Gwen nods, not looking at ease. “Yeah. I saw you creeping around a few hours ago and each time I almost got you, you’d run away. It’s been driving me insane. You don’t remember this?”
“Wait, you consciously visited my dreams? I thought it was all just memories ascending while I was sleeping?” Yaël’s mind was blown away.
“Yeah, well, I heard you’re now the rightful heir to Stark Industries? You’re gonna be in my shoes one day when your dad hands it down.”
“What do you mean?” he clenched his jaws and seemed to try his best not to ball his hands into fists. Yaël was playing on a sensitive string.
“Right… the Quinjet is ready for departure. We need to go now before we lose him again.” Natasha then nods towards the hallway. Steve nods before getting the suit off the panel. Then he follows Widow out of the workshop. Before the door closes behind him, he gives Tony one last look, which Tony returns.
“Shit!” he calls out, shooting a web to keep himself from getting all the way to the ground. Then he starts swinging. A quick look up and he can see a bunch of clouds surrounding the tower. Peter recognizes that from somewhere… Like… when Thanos used to travel from one place to the other using the tesseract.
Tony nods. “Boyfriend,” he says with a smile. Or… wait, is he? There was a thing about their relationship, wasn’t there? Something he’s forgetting. “He’ll come, soon. He’s been away.”
“Uh, yeah,” he says with a mouth full. Then he chews and swallows before continuing. “Apparently the Spider-Venom burned it away before attacking my body. The combination of the Goblin Suit healing-systems took care of it. You know, aside from frying my brains completely.” Harry shrugs. Peter just looks at him, taking in the small scars on his cheeks, the only proof of what happened to him other than how skinny he’s become.
“We can order something with alcohol if you really want it, it’s just mostly for my safety that I didn’t,” Tony explains, pointing towards his stomach. “New liver and all, need to take care of it.”
“Yes, what do you count in otherwise?” Raido asked him a bit sourly. It was obvious he didn’t like Yaël’s new friend.
Peter looks up into the ceiling, keeping himself from sighing as well. He’s been over this a million times already, and he’s a bit tired of having to repeat it all the time.
Things are going alright. Life’s good again. There’s no more Venom, there’s no more dark clouds in Peter’s head. Whenever he goes to school, he does so with a smile.
“Uh, you realize the coach can take that away from you if he sees that?” Ned asks, and Michelle shrugs.
“You didn’t ask me nicely, either.” The man put his hands behind his back and started walking towards the woods. Yaël stumbled as she tried to follow his quick pace.
“If you do that, nobody will ever find your body after we're through with you," Natasha says while looking at her nails.
, is already ready to pound on him. He’s not giving him enough time to even fight back. But even Tony knows that Steve can’t do any damage to him. The only thing that can help is…
