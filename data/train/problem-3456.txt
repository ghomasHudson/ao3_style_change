The next slick slide of Cas's fingers repeats the movement, slowing just enough for Cas's fingertip to stroke across the muscle with an edge of extra weight behind it, and the continuing downward path afterwards is a little shorter before Cas's fingers change direction and come back again. Each subsequent sweep is shorter still, Cas decreasing the length of his strokes until finally his fingers still, middle one resting gently in the centre of the curl of muscle.
"Cas?"
Pretty much as soon as he’d been old enough to understand what Dad did when he went away and why, he’d realised there was nothing stopping the same thing from happening to him too, and Tsalia had spent the nights as another wolfhound, curled up tight to him and licking away his tears. Each time time John left them, Tsalia stayed a wolfhound until he came back, then pretended she’d been a cat or a hawk or a dragon, Dean too embarrassed to admit that he had worried for his father and already knowing that John wanted to see him as the strong one, the one he could trust with Sammy’s care.
“My dad’s a Muggle, so yeah,” he said defiantly, daring Isaac to make something of it, but Isaac just held his hands up, smiling again.
No one said anything, so Caleb nodded at them with a brief smile and walked away, getting absorbed into one of the groups by the fire. Rachael lingered long enough to give them all a smile and an eyeroll that said not to mind Caleb and his brusqueness, then she too disappeared into the crowd, and the first-years all glanced sideways at each other and started shuffling towards the two doors.
to be fucking blasphemy.”
mary was a police cadet when she met john, fresh from vietnam and determinedly training to be a mechanic because machines are easy and people are terrible. they got married, had two kids, and then one night mary woke with a mother's sixth sense, went to the nursery to see if sam was hungry, and got firebombed. maybe it was the light she turned on, maybe the guy (a serial arsonist and one of her cases) just knew it was the nursery, it doesn't matter; what matters is that whatever was in the molotovs burned hot, fast and fierce, and by the time mary could assess her surroundings she only had two options: 1) curl up in a corner with sam and hope john could save her, or 2) throw herself through the fire in the doorway and save herself. she chose option 2 and that's how john found her, curled tight on the hallway floor rolling the last of the flames out with sam cradled to her chest and wailing like a banshee. dean's main memory of the fire is sam screaming and the flames, lighting up his mother lying curled on the floor with sam in her arms. john prised sam from her and passed him to dean, shoved him at the stairs and told him to run outside as fast as he could, that john would be right behind him. they sat on the hood of the impala and watched their house burn as sirens got louder and drowned out his mother's hissing sobs, sam's fretful hiccups and john's low, calm, only slightly shaky voice telling them all that it was gonna be okay. mary walked with a cane from then on but she was back on the force within a year, and john, paranoid motherfucker that he was, took dean out for the weekend of his eighth birthday and taught him how to shoot a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun; where to hit a man so he was in pain, incapacitated, dead.
“Heaven doesn’t work that way anymore,” Kevin tells him cheerfully, his otter-daemon shimmying up his body to drape herself around his shoulders. “Jack fixed it.”
The classroom went quiet, though Dean was sure he heard a stifled snort from over by the Ravenclaws, and then Professor Crowley was waving the ambient clouds away with his wand and saying crisply, “Hospital Wing, Novak. No Winchester, I’d really rather you didn’t touch him, but you should probably go with him to make sure no one else does.”
, don’t you?” she says thoughtfully, and that’s all the warning Dean gets before she’s digging the blade in and dragging it slowly and steadily diagonally down through the inked skin. He tries to keep quiet, but it burns and builds on itself, shocked nerves screaming to life in the wake of the blade. “Shh baby, don’t cy, it’ll all be over soon,” Abaddon croons, and Dean twists and bucks beneath her but she’s like stone on top of him, as immovable as an angel.
"That's...really sweet of you."
them, but he learned pretty quickly that the sexy librarian thing is a weakness of Dean’s, so he wears them out to work sometimes because he’s a devious bastard.)
"Certainly," Cas says, and Novath shakes out his wings. The rustle makes Imp jerk, but then Novath spreads them wide and
, never just casually slam someone into a wall, choke them, force them down onto their knees to suck him off - and worse, he doesn’t know why Cas is
“So you lied,” the bird-daemon says reprovingly, hopping up onto Cas’s shoulder, and Cas is smiling, reaching up to tap him on the beak and hush him.
There are three figures squashed together on the hood, leaning back against the windshield and talking quietly, gesturing with bottles and laughing at old jokes. Behind them on the roof their daemons are tangled together, a cougar curled around a golden monkey with a white hawk nestled between her paws.
“No, theirs, fortunately. They harried us all the way back across though, and though we lost them it cost Conesta all her remaining strength.” His mouth twists with worry. “If we hadn’t landed in your field, and if you hadn’t been so generous with your supplies and skills-”
“Take care of her,” Cas had said, low, and Tsalia had edged forward and licked tentatively at Iope’s shoulder.
“Doves are white,” Dean scoffs, resolutely ignoring the bowl full of plump ripe pears in favour of some left-over take-out.
Behind him, perhaps made bolder by the presence of their king, perhaps just less easily intimidated than their predecessors, other denizens of Hell are gathering. Many of those in human form are still carrying implements that drip blood and other fluids onto the floor, and watching Castiel in a way that suggests they would enjoy using them on him too. Castiel crooks his fingers and flares his wings, preparing to remove them from his path, when Crowley clicks his tongue and takes a step forward.
And then a few months in she just upped and vanished, scaring Dean sick that demons had got her despite the lack of evidence, until he met up with Sam again all those months later and found her crouched on his shoulder, tail flicking from side to side and acting like she’d never done anything different.
, wriggling and twisting and making furious high-pitched noises and gouging bloody clawmarks into Sam's fist as it tries to get to Cas. Cas looks down at it with the same disdain Dean feels, and his wings twitch. "Sam, do you intend to keep this creature?"
[Jen’s sitting in the makeup chair while the makeup artist applies her bloody lip. She quirks an eyebrow at the camera in the mirror.]
"Woah there sparky, what the hell?"
Cas has the sense to bring Novath in over the sea, so when the blue drops him at the water's edge Imp and Kaz have already been persuaded up to the ridge, where there's some scanty grass and the shade of the wagon to rest in. They both flinch when Novath dives into the water, but they dismiss it pretty quickly and return to grazing, though they stick close together.
“I said Cas, not Kate Moss,” he shoots back, and Sam looks offended but drops it.
She kisses him to shut him up, both hands in his hair and using every filthy trick she knows. He goes with it willingly enough, stupidly hot stifled noises humming in the back of his throat as she sucks on his tongue and tips his head back and up, makes him work for it.
“Fuck.
The Winchester brand of massage is not the same as the kind that have happy endings (and Dean knows because he's researched and compared notes on the latter. Extensively). When you're out on the road, you just want the pain gone, no matter how ungentle or lacking in proper technique the actual massage is, so while Dean's pretty sure he could be gentler or more relaxing, Cas's shoulders really are like freaking
"Roll over on your stomach," Dean orders, standing back up and stripping his outer shirt off as he toes off his boots, and Cas gives him a
When Dean was about ten, Tsalia started spending more and more time as a wolf, flicking to other shapes but always reverting to that one like she was already halfway-settled. A few months or so later it was an Alsatian, then a lioness, and then Dean woke up on the first day after his twelfth birthday they started a new school and found her as a cougar, testing her claws on the cheap motel carpet. At the end of school they found Sammy in the middle of a circle of other kids, their daemons all bristling as they taunted him and Iope pacing restlessly in front of Sam as a wildcat, knowing they’d get into trouble if she attacked.
“How’d you like your Christmas present, Dean?” he calls.
“No!” Dean says defensively. “I- weren’t there supposed to be gold rings?”
"Yes, because Balthazar's the authority on good prefectship," Cas said flatly, pushing away, and Dean  stood with him, because fuck Cas wasn't
This time when he sits back, done, Cas's whole body has gone soft and easy, shoulders loose and wings flopping off the edge of the mattress towards the floor.
Dean stabs at another mouthful of pancake. "Sam, we're a couple miles out from
"I thought they could only be controlled by demons," Sam says slowly, staring down Crowley's hands and coming warily round the side of the desk.
michael is his first name (his last is shurley - chuck’s nephew)
“What? No,” Dean says dismissively, leaning round the door again to check on Sam. He’s curled on the couch reading one of Bobby’s indeterminate law books and seems happy enough. “No, it was just a dream, Bobby. I was just...thinking about him or something, it’s not like that’s hard to believe when he’s on the news every five minutes curing cancer or whatever.”
Gabriel waves hand at the nearest pheasant. “Ta dah!”

They’re outside now, the spring air cool on his face, his overheated skin, and the shining black bulk of the car is looming out of the confusion. That’s home, that’s safe, and when they get close enough he lets himself stop, slump down against the metal and lean on it, close his eyes. He knows Dee’s kneeling in front of him, hands on his face, saying his name sharp and worried because he can hear the wheeze of his own breathing in his ears, feel the tightness in his chest that shouldn’t be there, the inexorable weight of something constricting his lungs, making him gasp in air he can’t seem to get enough of, and-
“No,” Iope says softly, almost a moan.
I promise I am actually working on the one about Sam's lost year/time with Amelia, but writing's been...hard these last few months, so that fact that the new eps are actually making me want to write stuff means I seize the opportunity with both hands.
It’s like the shower’s just run ice cold. Dean actually whimpers a little around Cas fingers, but they can’t keep doing while his brother (his fucking horrible, cock-blocking

“The firs’ years, Professor Flitwick,” Hagrid said formally, and Professor Flitwick nodded.
The Winchesters are Holdless, have been ever since the fire that took their cothold at Lemos and John took his boys south. Survival skills, they have them. But then Sam left and hitched a lift on a fishing vessel to go to Harper Hall; he has, as Dean's always said, as much singing ability as a watchwher, but he loves the Archives and has a good memory for precedents, and he almost made Journeyman, before Dean came to get him again. They travel around with a good, feisty runner called Imp and a sturdy old cartbeast called Kaz to pull their wagon. They've a fair of about half-a-dozen lizards (three greens (Acee, Decee and Talica), a blue (Jovi) and two browns (Styx and Lepp)) that look to both of them equally, and things are going well as they criss-cross Pern doing odd-jobs and dealing with pest problems, until they get caught out in Fall one day in the north and are saved by blue Novath and his rider C'stiel.
Cas - and yet it
There’s a rush of air behind him, and that’s all the warning he gets before an arm clamps down across his throat. He stabs backwards and feels the blade catch, hears the angel hiss in pain, and then fingers snap around his wrist and wrench it back the wrong way. The sword clatters to the floor and Dean does his best to stifle his shout, but
I'm A Trustworthy Policeman, Tell Me More.
“He made a deal-” Dean begins furiously, and she sweeps a paw forward, sending pebbles and grit showering against his legs.
Cas shrugs, something he still hasn’t quite mastered, shoulders moving slightly independently of each other. “I've had what I believe you would term a ‘bad day’.”
“Ah ah ah Dean,” she says, out loud, stretching his lips into a grin. “Play nice, or I’ll have to break out the restraints and keep you locked away in there, and you won’t know what I’ve done until I bring you out to see.” She flashes him some visual aids, in case he doesn’t get it: the bunker, bloody and overturned, Kevin cowering away from him and begging brokenly for his life; Cas, staring helplessly up at him as he pours holy oil slowly, gently over his head, crimson-smeared mouth open to show broken teeth and the dark meaty stump of his tongue; Sam, slumped in his arms, the handle of the knife between his ribs juddering as he gasps for breath he can’t get, one hand still trying weakly to push Dean away-
I have a giant soft spot for Bobby/Rufus being gruff old hunters together and never letting each other get too bogged down in the horror of the job
"We can’t help unless you tell us what’s wrong," she says quietly. The spaniel doesn’t answer, and she licks her lips. "Come on Kel-"
“Time for what? And what’s with the meat-market routine?” Dean asks, twisting to follow him, and Cas’s hand lands on his shoulder, holding him still as he circles him. “Dude, seriously, ow. You just healed all my bruises.”
Swimming is something Sam and Dean learned as children in hot summers like this one, John beside them challenging them to catch him as he ducked underwater and darted away; by unspoken agreement they swim out to Novath, who eels his way to meet them, gliding underwater with his eyes shining just under the surface and tail churning up a frothy wake. He comes up under Cas and Cas laughs and lets him, clinging to his wet hide with all four limbs. There are, Dean notices while trying not to, yellowing bruise marks on his hips, pink scratches down his back, and a scatter of pale red bites at the junction of shoulder and neck. He looks away.
In Dean’s absence his potion had congealed and gone all lumpy and purple, which made Professor Crowley click his tongue in irritation and award him a P, despite the extenuating circumstances. Dean was tempted to throw it at him and see how
"Yeah, yeah it's delicious."
It’s both similar to the things he’s done before and nothing at all alike; the blood has at least begun to congeal, but it’s mixed with mud from the field and God knows what was on the other dragon’s claws. The very scale of the wounds is daunting too; it must have been a much larger dragon that inflicted them, from the width of them alone, and Dean has to push away images of giant claws raking through flesh. He concentrates only on each task at hand as it presents itself - he cleans the length of the wound in front of him, presses down clods of bandage to help with the clotting, and tries to ignore the clawed foreleg hanging mere inches from his head and shuddering occasionally with the dragon’s pain. He is at least tall enough to reach the injuries higher up on the beast’s flanks without climbing all over her, which he is sure has saved further aggravation and discomfort. She settles as he works, although he is certain it’s more to do with her captain finally getting through to her than any great healing power on his part.
. Its eyes are black like a demon's and its face is all wrinkly and squashed, and it's basically just a pocket-sized version of the beasts that chewed on Dean's liver and now that he can see it, he'd love nothing better than to take it out back and shoot it, or maybe just stomp on it like a particularly ugly cockroach.
Dean had twitched despite himself - sure, Cas was an angel, but all the freakin’ same that was a part of Sam’s

"Crap," Dean supplies, and Sam shoots him a look.
"Well thank you Mrs Dalloway, you've been very helpful," he says, standing, and Sam follows his lead.
"Yeah. Uh, it's a right out your drive, it took me maybe fifteen minutes to walk? It's green, a '15 Chevy hybrid."

Dean stills. "That's what you think? Cas, hey, no," and he drops back onto the bed, leans right over into Cas's space, holding his eyes and pushing everything he's trying to say to the front of his mind so Cas can see he's telling the truth, "that's why it's you, you're- you're the complete opposite of it all, you'd never hurt me, I- I need it to be you, not Alastair, cause you- I want you to, I need a better memory if it, otherwise I'm gonna go the rest of my life never being able to...deal with it. You want me to work throught it? This is me working through it. Please."
“Oh, stop being such an arse,” Balthazar says, rolling his eyes. “Cas, it’s fine. Really. Just ignore him.”
“I thought you said God told all of you to leave Emmy the fuck alone.”
sam starts in dean’s third year. he’s in ravenclaw, and becomes unreasonably friendly with a slytherin in the year above called ruby (and her BFF Bela), as well as a girl in his own house called jess. dean’s little gang take fondly to him, especially ash and, to both of their annoyance, gabriel. at the end of the christmas term dean gets an owl that tells him they’re going to stay with dad’s friend bobby and, thoroughly mystified, they take the train back to kings cross, take a ministry car to the MoM and an international portkey directly to Bobby’s, to find that their father has fucked off god knows where and left them in bobby’s care, along with the talking portrait of their mother in her early twenties that’s all they have left of her.
“If that would enable to you pursue the lives you want to,” Cas says evenly, stare as intent as ever. “Of course, I would rather be with you.” He switches his eyes to Sam, including him too. “Loneliness is not an experience I enjoy.”

“Hythe. You’re not far off Dover, just a little too far west. I’m Dean, by the way, Dean Winchester. My father owns the farm.”
“I was under the impression it wasn’t a necessity,” Cas says, moonlight catching the slight curve of his mouth, and she snorts and resumes shoving his sleeves down and off.
“HE BROKE SAM’S WALL!” Dean shouts at her. “What the fuck kind of, of ‘friend’
Sam's prayer goes: "Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him".
(Dean remembers Iope faltering in her dash towards them, her wide eyes as she slumped into the mud and pushed herself back up, struggling to turn, to see, while Dean ran forward to catch Sam as he fell.)
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes."
It’s a bit of a free-for-all then, as people come spilling out of the Roadhouse doors and daemons throw themselves gleefully into the melee; Jo’s collie and Kevin’s otter and the hairy bulk of his father’s wolfhound Tristram. Charlie’s magpie and Pamela’s much tinier owl are fluttering around, alighting whenever they can, and Tsalia is sitting blissfully with her eyes half-closed while Mary’s bobcat-daemon hooks a paw over her shoulders and licks every inch of her face.
"as you may be aware, there has recently been a...change of management. mary ellen," and he pronounces her name carefully, like it's foreign, "is no longer cut off from the glory of heaven, and our father has decreed that she be left alone."
Dean clenches his jaw and glances briefly away. "Did you win?"
"You've dealt with him in the past," Cas says, still flat and dispassionate, "and I recall he gave Bobby back the use of his legs of his own free will."
It would be an understatement to say that Dean isn’t expecting the Cas that he finds past the bead curtain, sitting cross-legged on the floor and apparently conducting some kind of tantric yoga session. He tips Dean a wink when he sees him, tells the women grouped around him to go get ready for the orgy and grins wide and dopey as they leave, and behind him a scruffy tan, black and white dog-daemon stretches herself playfully out on the floor.
“Cas said its
Dean spreads his hands. “Well I’m not.” He reaches out, sets his fingers over Cas’s tie. “C’mon buddy, live a little. ‘S not like Voldemort’s gonna come busting in through the window.”
Cas huffs his little not-quite-a-laugh.
“You couldn’t have untied me before you left?” Dean demands, and Cas shrugs one shoulder - again, something he’s never quite gotten the hang of - and endeavors to look like human social niceties are still beyond him, though it doesn’t manage to reach his eyes, which are dark and wicked.

She waves an impatient hand. “It’s not like the actual story’s any less crazy than whatever bullshit I’ll come up with, is it? And when things get that surreal, why not tweak it a bit?”
a whacko and he has the scar to prove it, and the ‘paranoid’ is totally justified - but it’s nice, for a second, to think about just saying “fuck it” and ending the road here, leaving the car to rust with the others and curling up in the remnants of Bobby’s house and turning his back on life, helping other hunters on the end of the phone but otherwise leaving it all behind.
Cas’s hands come up to cradle her hips. “I had worried that what you said earlier meant that this was a one-time occurrence.”
“Sam’s gone again,” she says simply, flicking her head over to the other bed, and Dean, relieved that’s all it is, pushes himself up and finds Iope huddled on the window ledge, curled in on herself in an unhappy little ball.
The dragon rouses at the scent of bloody fresh meat and devours everything within her reach, hooves, fleece and all. At least she’s not wasteful.
the next morning Sam would have gone out to the car and found a piece of paper with Bobby's loopy scrawl on it that Dean missed in all his excitement about having his baby back. it reminds them that, after the thing where his house burned down and the leviathans really seem to have it in for him, the Winchesters are the sole beneficiaries of his estate. with the insurance money from the fire - which Jody helps them get by fudging the suspicious details, cause of

, reaching as far as he can to run both hands through the feathers on each wing over and over, he kind of almost hopes that his skin might come away coated in grey, and Cas's feathers will brush up white again.
Cas's stare gets sharper. "No. I was engaged in the defense of one of our strongholds, against numbers far superior to my own. I apologise if that was an inconvenience to you."

Like the common room it was circular, but the only furniture was the three four-poster beds spaced evenly around the walls, each with a trunk at the end and the little chest of drawers to one side like a bedside table. Copper lamps like the room warm and cozy, complimented by the cheerful patchwork bedspreads, and opposite them was another door, which Dean could only assume led to a bathroom. His trunk was at the end of the bed closest to the bathroom and he headed over to it, flipping the lid up so he could get to his stuff. He chucked his pajamas at the bed, and his wash things after them, then scooped out the photo of Dad and Sammy to put up on top of the bedside table; Dad standing against the door of the Impala, smiling a little, with his hands on Sam’s shoulders and Sam waving and grinning like an idiot, squinting against the sunlight in his eyes. Dean had taken it a couple of weeks ago with the camera Uncle Bobby had sent him for Christmas, in preparation for going off to school.
“Why?” Dean asks, opening the door and rubbing the towel over his hair, and Bobby rolls his eyes and mutters something that sounds like “damn fool angels”.
"Cas!" Dean yells. "Cas!" and only the wind and the whooping howls answer him. "You get your feathery ass back here, you bastard, we gotta stick together in this shithole!"
Dean starts with what they know - that Sam took a lucky shot - and then Tsalia pipes up that they made a deal with the reaper for Cas’s life, and Dean drops a hand down to stroke her ruff in gratitude. It explains everything - the absence of Cas’s injuries, the negligible fatality of the stab wound - so neatly it might as well be true.
“Okay?” Sam asks, soft, and she exhales hard, keeps her forehead pressed just below his collarbone. She sucks her next breath in through her teeth, almost a hiss, and...Sam knows those sounds. He feels the dread that had been lurking heavy in his gut roil to life. “Dee? Are you-?”
“Well pet, that’s a question I could take a lot of time answering, but let’s start at the top and say I want a good long ride in your meatsuit.” She kicks him over onto his back, then gracefully drops down to straddle him, pinning his wrists with one hand and tapping the knife in her other hand speculatively against his cheek. She uses it to flip his jacket and shirt aside, and slices open his t-shirt in one swift motion, not bothering to be gentle about it and scoring a bloody line in his skin. She rips the material open and purses her lips, considering the careless gash that’s just caught the edge of the protection tattoo. “Mmm, I think we’d better make
“Three times,” Dean adds, holding up his fingers for emphasis.
Dean narrows his eyes at him. They’re about the same height and roughly the same build, but St Claire’s injury would probably allow Dean the upper hand in a fight. “How the fuck did they let you into the Corps?”

“Like I said, someone’s gotta. And with three of us it won’t be so time-consuming, we can actually have a life too, maybe even get back into it after a while, local stuff, like Bobby used to. I mean, Frank taught you some computer stuff, right?”
rachael still finds out about the deal, but this time it's not as serious because cas isn't after the souls, it's just the demon factor, and she takes him up to heaven to face his peers - they don't tell raphael, that would be stupid, but that's why he almost wasn't there to get the boys back, and he gets dragged back soon after, but that's their first inkling something's wrong. prayers to cas redirect to rachael, who tells them he's currently on trial but won't tell them why. balthazar doesn't know either, though he promises to snoop. they know cas and crowley got sam back, but that can't be it - balthazar does his whole "are you in flagrante with the king of hell" thing, and cas admits to the deal. this time though, balthazar being on his 'side' means busting him out of heaven's prision or whatever (raphael's found out by now and it's not good). balthazar does get him out, though that’s how he dies this time, and Cas almost dies too. there's no holy oil trap, just dean and cas having a serious conversation when cas wakes up. "it was all for you" is still there, though cas means it because it was all to get sam out to make dean happy. "did you kiss him?!" etc is still in, because dean. the late-night conversation might also still be there, and there might be sort-of declarations of feelings.
Cas all but throws himself into Dean’s lap, and Dean lets him, just as he lets Cas lean their foreheads together as he reaches down to finish getting him off, other hand sliding down under the waistband of Cas’s jeans. Cas’s mouth falls open, whole body electrified, and when Dean’s wrist flexes he bows forward, hands skidding down off Dean’s shoulders where they’ve been stroking through his hair, and comes, fingers catching at the back of Dean’s shirt.
bobby determines he's him, sam explains about cas, and dean, and bobby agrees. cas goes back to heaven and does the equivalent of sleeping for three days. time passes. sam goes off with the campbells. cas continues hanging round dean and checking in occasionally on sam. raphael gives cas his ultimatum, cas goes to dean and crowley turns up and persuades him to go to war. he offers cas half the souls, and the starter pack from hell; cas's mental dean tells him he'd be a moron to accept, so he declines and goes back to watching dean, then to heaven. he takes all his followers to raphael's and basically tells him to go fuck himself, thus the war. lack of souls means all the rebels get much more badly hurt tho. the war’s still the reason he's awol - not that sam's praying so much now, but sometimes an angel is just useful on a hunt.
"Like this?" Cas asks when he's got Dean's jeans and underwear down past his ass, freeing his cock to jut up right at Cas's eye level and making that steady gaze waver for just a second, Cas tongue darting out over his lower lip.
The darkness blurs around him and then the angel’s dragging him down some stairs, lit by a flickering amber glow from the open door at the bottom. Fire. Holy fire. He blinks, trying to clear his vision as the angel manhandles him inside, and then he wishes he hadn’t as what he sees sucker-punches him right in the chest.
"Trust me, when you've eaten what I have, cooking such as Bobby's is to be savoured indeed," Ollie says, and then there's that clatter of wings and Cas is suddenly right in front of him, stumbling a little like he landed in a rush and with his arms half-spread like he's trying to shield Sam and Dean from view.
Sam pulls a face. "I'm not saying I don't agree with you, but turning people into toads? Really?"
“Oh,” Castiel says, blinking like his nudity is not a thing of concern to him. “Yes, alright. Thank you. I've said that so often today it feels like perhaps the words will shortly lose all meaning.”
Cas stares at him for a moment, then shrugs. “All the other angels went running back home and barred the door, and all my ‘mojo’ just...drained away. I woke up one morning with her nose in my face. Apparently she’s an African wild dog.”
“I thought Nephilim were meant to be big?”
There’s a flapping sound, heavier and more substantial than Cas’s wings, and he’s fully clothed again. Dean flips him off and Cas huffs his little not-laugh. Dean fishes out some clean underwear and pulls it on, then casts around for his jeans. The bathroom door rattles open and Sam wanders in, shirtless and scrubbing at his hair, just as Dean spots his jeans under the bed. Behind him, the whoosh of displaced air tells him Cas has disappeared, but fingertips linger in the small of his back and he’s suddenly as clean as Sam. He hooks his fingers in his jeans and drags them out, yanks them on and immediately goes in search of his t-shirt so Sam won’t ask why he’s grinning.
“So, how do you come to be here by yourself?” St Claire asks, as Dean sets the bowl of steaming water down on the table. “If I may be so bold as to ask.”
"I am...tired," Cas says after a moment, not turning round. "This war is ceaseless and unremitting; I hadn't realised it would be so exhausting."
They don’t have anything designed for dragons, and the cows and sheep so rarely need doctoring beyond the superficial, so the best Dean can do is bring everything they have and hope that combined it will be enough. If not, he supposes they could always sacrifice a horse blanket or two.
Dean shouts his name but it's Tsalia that moves, throwing herself forward and barreling straight past Cas and into the water, which splashes up around her as she skids to a halt with the bird-daemon between her paws. He screeches, startled, wings beating at the water, but Tsalia is laughing and dropping her head to nuzzle at him while Dean grabs Cas in a hug, relieved and delighted to have found him alive at last.
She hunches down on herself, unable to argue with that. “He wasn't himself,” she mutters, but it's hollow.
so some midwife doesn’t get her eyes burned out!”
“Jesus
"I was soulless? It's only just now, when Bobby said- I got some, uh. Flashes."
“Don’t you get fed at home?” she teased, and Dean knew she was joking but it still made something spike in his stomach.
Cas turns up on the other side of the bed. He’s only got one sock on, and all his buttons are done up wrong, baring a slice of his hip on one side and a sizable chunk of collarbone and chest on the other. He’s never really gotten the hang of buttons.

school career sneaking round in his invisibility cloak and wondering into the Forest.”
dean and cas date easily; they chat on the phone for a while when dean does call him, arrange to meet for drinks after work though dean gets cockblocked by a case (a few times?), so they reschedule and cas turns up in his (scarf and) coat to make sure he keeps it this time. despite having very little in common music/car/sport wise they talk easily, and dean sings along to a couple of lines of his favourite song on the radio, cas telling him later that right then he knew he was going to fuck him no matter what. dean does the "so you wanna get out of here" thing and cas agrees; their first kiss is dean leading the way out to the impala and cas crowding him up against it and then telling him regretfully but with dancing eyes that he has to get up early in the morning and needs to go. it turns out he meant "go to the other side of the country", but he makes it very clear that he means to come back and he and dean email/call/letterwrite back and forth (the letterwriting is all cas, priority mail that tells dean all the things he wants to do to him in three languages and fragments of thousand-year-old poetry) for a month until cas is free to come back to kansas, and which point they don't leave the house for three days.
“Dean Winchester,” Joshua says gravely. “You could’ve just called.”
"Don't presume to talk about what you don't understand," Cas says, low and measured, and his hand on Dean's chest is heavy as stone.
“Sorry, sorry, I forgot you’ve had first hand experience.” He looks over at Sam. “Feed him blood for the first few weeks, then raw meat.” Then he throws a wary glance at Cas and vanishes.
“Cas,” comes the cry again, desolate and lost, and from across the hall Dean hears the door creak open, the floorboards groan, the stairs rattle, and then shortly thereafter a second voice, too quiet to make out the words.
Cas sort of deflates, like a child caught in the wrong, head bowing forward. "Forgive me,
"What, y'gonna drag me?"

"I'm sure your angel can help with that."
“Mmm,” Cas agrees, voice rumbling through his chest and sounding like a big cat purring, like the Impala speeding down the freeway with nothing but the open road ahead of her, and Dean’s asleep even before he can finish fully processing the ridiculousness of that thought.
"You thought he wouldn't?"
Dean lets her words go in one ear and out the other. She’s right, they should check, he might be getting all shaky over nothing, but everything fits and if Cas

feel like so he's okay to let it continue.
"I intend to," Cas says solemnly, at odds with the way his fingers are dragging up Dean's cock and squeezing over the head, coming away wet and smoothing back down again. Dean doesn't remember being able to get this hard this fast since he was about fourteen, and even then never so soon after round one. It's a little disconcerting, to say the least, but his higher thought processes are rapidly dissolving into a single slurred
“Hey - is this seat taken?” asked a voice, and Dean turned to find a kid with a ridiculous mullet leaning round the door.
"I just stirred up those dormant demon powers of his," Crowley says patiently. "He's not evil, or whatever else you think, he's just a little more demonic than normal at the moment, and he can...see things his human eyes can't. Now, delightful though it is to have your arms around me, angel-" and he shrugs out of Cas's grip. Cas eyes him expressionlessly and tucks his sword back up his sleeve, like a reverse magician's trick.

the 7.21 AU where they come back to get Cas only to find him huddled in a corner of solitary, the material round the walls shredded, furniture smashed, and the bedframe twisted and warped while he mutters to himself about bees and chews nervously at the sleeves of his straitjacket. Debris crunches underfoot, and they turn stunned, furious eyes on Meg, who shrugs. "What was I supposed to do? Stop him?"
He doesn’t mean to drive to Rufus’s in one go, but somehow he does, zoning out to the rumble of the car on the road, familiar and, in its own way, comforting.
"Thank you, Sam."
a couple of months in they talk about maybe leaving, but aside from the difficulty of warding the impala, sam reminds them about the demon in the semi and it doesn't get brought up again. bobby and one of the boys start going round warding the whole property, hoping to stop the angels getting so close. they found the sword that killed balthazar to add to the other two, and all three of them carry them everywhere. the only good thing is that emmy clearly can't get possessed, being an angel and all. crowley assures them that angel swords will work excellently on demons too, being forged in heaven with holy fire.

The tree rustles, something skipping across the branches. Dean narrows his eyes, mentally cataloging the things he could use in the room for self-defense. No wonder the thing’s turned up in Bobby’s yard - it’s haunted.
Dean shoved at her head with one hand, her fur soft under his palm. "Shut up, I’m fuckin’ awesome."
“There’s a word for this, you know,” Dean says to Tsalia, head still under the Impala’s hood as he checks everything over, and feels the car move ever so slightly as she shifts in the driver’s seat, fur rustling against the leather.
“Yeah well, how could I miss being the first one to see her latest artistic masterpiece?” he asks, keeping his tone light, friendly. Hayley seems like one of the least likely people ever to want to do anything to Emmy, not to mention the hundreds of chances she’s had before now and not taken, but if life’s taught him anything it’s that you you just honestly never know.

“Will it- I mean, can I train it, now I’m all...demony?”
"Of course you're not
“Well, clearly, he was lyin’.”
She just has time to note that the road branches at the house, splitting off towards a bigish barn off to the right and looping left and away past the nearest field to another cluster of outbuildings, and then the house lights are coming on.
Sam stops flailing and closes his hand around thin air, evidently prying the thing off, and holds it gingerly several feet away from him. The squeaky growling, which had gone silent, starts up again.
Castiel gets Sam’s room for the night, the bed fortunately already made up, and Dean finds that sleep eludes him in favour of replaying the events of the day, and wonders whether Castiel has the same troubles. He must eventually slip into dreaming though, because he wakes to low, plaintive calls from outside that are not quite a name.
Fuck fuck
"Well, then," Sam starts, looking torn between having some kind of girly group hug and getting the holy water for a proper baptism, and Dean snorts.
Dee looks torn, head swiveling to watch the ripples. But neither of them is in a fit state to help anyone right now, especially not a thrashing angel experiencing drowning for the first time, and as horrible as it feels...
"I find that highly unlikely," Cas said finally, cold as ice. His fingertips were bright red, a pink flush across his whole hands except his white knuckles.

He grabs a handful of that damn trenchcoat and stands up, hauling Cas up with him. Cas lets himself be manhandled, that little frown line appearing between his eyes as he tries to figure out what Dean's doing, and Dean grins and

“Sam’s having a beer, right? Same for me please.”
"Castiel, Lord," Cas says quietly, still not looking him in the eye, and Ollie hums, examining him thoughtfully.
“Don’t worry, I am.”
“You should leave some room for pudding,” Charlotte Bradbury said across from him, amused, and Dean hastily swallowed his mouthful.

Tsalia bares her teeth and lunges up at him again, uncoiling like a spring the way she has a million other times to rip out throats. This time her paws are on his chest, heavy and immovable, and her face is inches from his, eyes blazing gold in the sunlight and the scar on her face standing out from this close, another reminder of Hell and, inextricably, Cas. “I was the one one that
“Yeah,” Sam agrees, running a hand through his hair and taking a deep breath to quiet the unease lurking low in his gut. “Of course.”

Maybe if Dean hadn’t been so distracted he would have been able to react faster, but he was never really sure what happened. One minute Cas was running a finger over the page, intent and studious and hot, and the next his cauldron exploded and he staggered back, eyes huge and breath punched out of him, drenched to the skin and horrified.
"You-" Dean twists to blot his cheek against one shoulder of his jacket. Cas's hand slips down over his chest, brushing against his shirt, and Dean frees one hand to catch it, fingers locking tight like he can anchor Cas to life if he holds hard enough.
“'F I didn’t you’d jus’ come get me ‘n’ drag me home anyway.”
Tsalia sighs disapprovingly, sounding achingly like Sam. "Well then, guess we'll have to improvise. Wasn't much use anyway."
"Any of them would almost certainly be several times her size," Castiel says as Dean opens the door, and Dean can't help his shiver. It's not fear, exactly, just the idea of the sheer

Fan: Did Cas sort of imprint on Dean, and that’s why they ended up together? Like, just because Dean’s a guy, that meant Cas was gay cause he fell in love with him?
But he doesn’t answer. And he won’t, Sam admits reluctantly, the knowledge creeping cold through his limbs as he struggles to breathe, because those aren’t meteors at all, they’re-

“You’re not ‘allowing’ us to do jack shit, Cas. One of us is Michael’s meatsuit, one of us is Lucifer’s. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out what happens to the loser.”
He backs away, suddenly can’t bear to be touching him, to make it real, but Tsalia stays, straining forward, body one long, still, desperate line as she waits for a miracle. Sam pushes himself to his feet behind them and Dean turns to him, away from that slumped body. “Sam, he’s gone.”

(See the end of the chapter for
“Please.” Together they wrestled his trunk on top of Dean’s, then both flopped down in the seats. “I’m Ash,” the boy said after a second. “Ash Blishwick.”
"Nice of you to join us," Dean snarks, and Cas ignores him, glancing round the room like a caged bird. He maybe looks even more windswept than usual, but it's pretty hard to tell with Cas.
“It’s an

it's not much, just a house and a few barns and a couple of paddocks, but it makes Sam and Cas so all shiny-eyed and Dean and Amelia are okay with whatever makes them happy. they slowly fix it all up and one outbuilding become a garage and another a little surgery for Amelia, and then the third becomes an actual barn because they sort of end up with three or four semi-feral rescue cats, four dogs (including Riot) plus those that half-way house there on their way to better homes, half a dozen chickens, four angry geese, two rescue donkeys, a giant old horse who thinks he's a pony, and three goats that for some reason Cas really loves.
“We were pursued,” St Claire answers cagily, unbuttoning his shirt down to his breastbone. He shrugs out of the torn sleeve, hissing, and peels the scarlet-stained material away, baring his shoulder and upper arm and the dark crimson gash bisecting both. “Oh, it's not as bad as I feared.” He gropes for the cloth Dean put in the water, wrings it out one-handed and begins cleaning the dried blood from his skin. “We managed to evade the Chanson-de-Guerre, but the two Honneur-d’Or’s caught us off the coast.”
Eventually they collect themselves and head down the road in front of them, and shortly a very familiar building comes into view.
"Ready?"
Cas is breathing raggedly now, hair curling a little from the sweat, something that’s not quite a moan catching at end of every breath, and Dean takes pity on him and disentangles his right hand, bringing it back round and curling it round Cas’s cock as he sweeps his left up and out as far as he can reach over Cas’s wing. Cas shudders, shoving his whole body forward into Dean’s grip and stuttering his half of the rhythm, and Dean palms roughly over the slick head, gathering enough to make it easier to wrap his hand back round and jack Cas off.
Dean took a deep breath, then another. Beside him, Ash was fiddling absently with his hair and rocking from foot to foot, and around them the other kids were murmuring and twitching, half nervous and half impatient. Professor Flitwick was back way sooner than Dean wanted him to be, and then they were once again being led, across the Entrance Hall with the staircase yawning above them and through the door into the Great Hall.
Sam is still looking uncertain, but Dean knows he can brush it off by telling him to shut his brain off already, what, does Sam think he would make that up? (even the thought makes his stomach twinge uncomfortably though, so he hopes it doesn't actually come to that). Cas, however, is still smiling, soft and fond and apparently delighted that Dean not only saved his ass but restored it to tip-top condition too. It’s real heartwarming to know he advocates for Dean double-crossing reapers to save his life (Dean would do it though, for real, if he had to, although if Cas gets his fool ass impaled again too soon Dean might leave him dead for a few minutes to teach him a lesson. Not that that will happen, since Cas is coming back to the bunker with them right now and leaning how to use a damn gun).
"There are horse blankets," Dean insists. "That's why I- you need something to cover you, in this weather. There's probably enough we can even make Conesta a...couch," (he almost said "nest") "to lie on. That's gotta be better than the ground."
crowley got exorcised/destroyed with the rest of the demons so all they can really do is put out an fbi missing person’s thing for cas and wait. bobby and dean fix the panic room but leave all the angel-warding sigils up - angels can be a sneaky bunch, and dean doesn't trust god to be checking up on them. they do spend more time the rest of the house though, the property wards meant to give them early warning. they fend off the odd demon attack, but nothing that requires emmy's grace again. she stops sleeping as much, and starts manifesting things like zapping around and telekinesis with her toys. christmas comes and goes.

"Thank you, officers," she breathes, tissue still clutched in one hand. "And please," she adds, touching Dean's arm, "call me Marissa."
"I'm glad you approve," Cas tells her, amused, and she grins at him.
“Not attached to someone else! And not-”
if this happens in s6 then there was no rebellion/it was quashed/it's not serious and cas tells them he's going on a ~50 year shoreleave and gives rachel control for everything less than raphael staging a coup (and even then only if things are seriously going to shit). sam finds dee one morning wondering apparently aimlessly around the junkyard in flipflops (the only thing that'll fit her swollen feet, shut the fuck up sam) and one of his old shirts, stopping at the odd car to brace her weight on it and breathe. when sam calls out to her she tells him she's fine, but sam calls for cas anyway and he appears instantly right by dee, hand settling on her back and making her roll her eyes because seriously she's FINE people have been having babies for a million years.
"A-Adelaide. Mackay. My car died on me, and your road was the only one..."
“DEAN!
“You’re not powerful enough to get to the bottom of the Atlantic any more, so no.” Cas frowns, and after a second she supplies: “Jimmy’s wedding ring. You haven’t even noticed. I saw as soon as we were rescued, but the fishermen couldn’t do much about it either, so I didn’t mention it.”
. Again though, evil mind-reading genius, and Cas pulls off after a final curl of his tongue over the head, eyes on Dean, and rises up onto his knees, wings spreading to balance him, and - oh jesus - slides down onto him in one fluid motion. Goddamn freaking angels and their absolute control over their vessels, fuck.
“Welcome to Hogwarts! The Sorting ceremony will begin shortly, after which I assure you you will be allowed to eat-” a spatter of nervous laughter “-but first you need to know which table you will be eating at! The Sorting is very important, because the house you are put into will become your family within Hogwarts and everything you will do while you are here will be with the rest of your house - you sleep in the house dormitory, relax in the house common room and take lessons with the rest of your house year group. The houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin, and each has it’s own merits and is no better or worse than another. House points are earned by good behaviour and taken away in the case of bad behaviour, with the overall score determining the winner of the House Cup for the year. As the Sorting will take place in front of the rest of the school, you may want to smarten up in the next few minutes; I will return shortly!”
“Okay okay, gimme five minutes!”
“Sure do, sweetheart,” Dean says drunkenly, not quite sure which way’s up anymore. “What can I say, Heaven likes me.”
Cas seems to consider this, glancing round like he’s assessing things, uncertain. Dean is too busy marveling at the tiny beat of the pulse in his neck, the visible movement of his chest (
“Who the
Emmy’s classroom is exactly the same as it always is; nothing out of place or unusual. There are still blobby paintings on the walls, the little desks and chairs are all neatly lined up and tucked together, and the bookshelf is still a haphazard rainbow of books stacked every which way. There’s no sign of a struggle, no sulphur in the air, and Dean turns a desperate circle, searching for
dean starts having weird dreams, people talking in a fog, invisible and not quite intelligible. he finally manages to wake before sam though, and finds a smudge of red on his sheets, sam’s injured hand freshly bleeding again. dean wakes him to shout at him about proper wound care, and sam blinks at him groggily during the lecture and shuffles off into the bathroom with a dismissive wave
"I freakin'
dean snorts. "yeah, i know, you're just a fucking hammer. so, great, no more angels divebombing us and the big man's back upstairs, good to know. you can go on back to daddy now."
They're on
“Yes,” Cas says, amusement bubbling under the words.
Dean can only gape at him and make vague spluttering noises, then stares down at his left hand. It’s still bare.
The trees around him sway in the breeze. Crickets chirp and unseen birds call. Tsalia pricks up her ears.
"Oh no, I am
“It’s all kind of sudden, can you hurry?” he adds, and the connection fizzes and crackles back at him. Another angel plunges by overhead, and the phone hisses so loud Sam drops it. It bounces off the concrete and the screen flashes and goes dark. Fuck, did he even get through? And if he did how long will it take them to get here when they’ll have to come across angels on the road, probably injured or dying? What if Sam has to-?
Dean takes an exaggerated step over the few sheets of paper in his way and crowds Cas back against the desk. “I’ll do my best.”
The conversations of the other students picked up as they entered, and Dean tried to look at nothing but the girl in front of him as they filed between the tables, laid with golden plates and cutlery which reflected the light. The ceiling above them was dotted with stars, and between it and the tables hovered banks of candles, their soft light warming the room. They came to a halt facing the teachers, Dean skipping his eyes along them and naming them in his head, trying to ignore the feel of hundreds of eyes boring into his back; Hagrid, looking like he was in a dollhouse; Professor Sprout, her hair coming loose from under her hat; Professor Trelawney, glasses and beaded necklaces reflecting the candlelight; Professor McGonagall, right in the middle, sleek silver hair shining and watching them with polite but sharp eyes.
about popping the buttons off Cas’s shirt), but it’s good to know Dean’s can take the same treatment. Dean wrangles the t-shirt over his head and gets up, retrieving the tie from the door and coming back to loop it over Cas’s head as Cas rolls his shoulders to settle his suit jacket. He manages to shrug back into the trenchcoat too while Dean’s fussing with the tie, pulling it tight again and making sure it’s hanging straight, and then they’re just standing there, Dean’s hands flat on Cas’s chest, feeling the heat of his skin through the fabric of his shirt.
Dean’s soul is trembling now, yearning desperately for some kind of resolution, and Castiel can only reach for it, returning it to its body with as much care and reverence as the Righteous Man deserves. The instructions Castiel received were very insistent on certain points, and the angel ensures that the mark of Heaven, Castiel’s claim on Dean’s soul, takes physical form, manifesting as a handprint burnt into Dean’s shoulder. Then the final threads of grace are removed from Dean’s body and his soul takes over; his lungs inflate, gasping in air, and his brain flares into consciousness.
Castiel doesn't dignify that with a reply; he closes his eyes, gathering his Grace close, and spreads his wings to their fullest extent. Crowley hisses out a curse and ducks out of their way, snatching his crown off his head and setting it carefully down, then takes a deep breath and steps up to the rockface, glancing back at Castiel one last time.
"It's fitting. I assisted in your endevours, but it was always you two boys who would change the world. What you and your brother have done will impact many lives; I'm glad to give of myself to ensure the world is made a better place."
They’re blue, unearthly and shining.
“Yeah, but that was the Apocalypse, and I figured he just said that to soften the blow of telling us God didn’t give two craps. And how do you know anyway, that was three years before you were even born!”
Mrs Greenburg leaves a basin of water out for her toad, and when they ask if she's seen anything out of the ordinary lately she seems to chew her tongue for a minute before she glances out the window and then back to them. "Well, I don't know if I should..."
"That's not a choice I can make."
Cas’s hands move, grabbing at Dean’s hair, fingers curling into it, running down the back of his neck and along his jaw and over his shoulders like he can’t bear to keep them still, and from the other side of the window Dean watches his counterpart’s grip soften, the kiss gentle and break. Cas opens his mouth, eyes glittering, but Dean’s hand tightens again, just long enough to shake him silent. Cas shrugs, a loose movement of his shoulders, and then he sort of...
The fire's well-established now and has settled lazily in to consume the pile of logs in the fireplace, flames stretching high and orange-yellow and blazing out heat. Tsalia's stretched out front of it like a parody of a housecat, Iope reclined against her stomach so she can scamper off if Sam needs her (he's cooking tonight, and she's better than him at remembering what Amelia taught them), and Cas's bird-daemon nestled in the dip between Tsalia's shoulderblades, feathers all fluffed out so he looks like a little white puffball.
"Dean, this isn't your fault."
He means Lilith but Ruby lurks in the gaps between the words. He's making the effort to get the conversation back onto less fraught topics though, so Sam allows it. "Key word being 'try'," he says dryly, and Dean shoots him a sideways glance of apology.
The rockface is rumbling now, small stones tumbling down and other cracks starting to crawl outwards from the main one, and Castiel drags Sam back far enough that Crowley has the space to close it up again. Crowley is blurred now, his very essence unravelling before the might of two archangels, but still he fights to bring the rift back together.
The room fell suddenly silent, and Dean wrenched his attention back to the front, where Professor Flitwick had stood back from the tattered, frayed and disheveled-looking hat he’d placed gently on a small stool. The hat seemed to draw itself up, and then a rip near the top opened up like a mouth and the hat began to sing. Dean couldn’t honestly remember
the moment would be. Because...” Cas falters. Emmanuel croons, rubs his head against Cas’s, and then drops down to the ground in a flurry of feathers. “Because I wasn’t sure what true happiness would even look like for me. Because the one thing I wanted, I knew I could never have.”
"You don't have to do this," Cas says softly, and Dean shakes his head, takes a deep breath and raises the lube.
, okay, and he had no damn right to cry about it. None.
Cas, how stupid
Dean blinks. "Uh, yeah, he seemed...good. For a god, or whatever the fuck you guys are. No offense."
Sam's elbow is sharp and pointy in Dean's ribs, and Dean only restrains himself from stepping on his huge gigantor foot in retaliation because he's too busy staring. Holy
He fell asleep to the blur of Sam’s movements, waving cheerfully to him through the dark.
mcgonagall is headmistress
Dean fights to keep his face blank. Mrs Graham’s Emmy’s teacher, and people here take each other’s kids home all the time as a favour when their parents are working late, but he and Cas had agreed early on that that was way too risky - all a demon would have to do is possess someone’s mother and say they were gonna take Emmy home, and bam!
“When I went to pick Emmy up from kindergarten today, she wasn’t there,” Dean says finally, pacing the perimeter a hair’s breadth away from the fire. “What
"Don't think so," Cas said, stealing another brief, searing kiss. "Maybe I just want you to shut up."
me inside and it was
"Hey Cas."
This is not real.
When Cas finishes, he sits contentedly back on his haunches and starts fastidiously licking at his claws, presumably to get the burger grease off them. “Dude, that’s definitely not your biggest problem,” Dean informs him, leaning forward and wiping at the strings of cheese stuck to his fur with his thumbs. Cas starts a little, then closes his eyes and lets him, sitting still as a statue until Dean’s done.
"No," Dean pushes away from him - not far, but enough to look Cas in the eye. "Stop with the psych eval, okay? I don't- I don't need to
The floor is cold and wet, and his cheek’s half-submerged in a puddle that laps up to the corner of his mouth, tasting like wet earth. He flexes his limbs experimentally and finds he’s not tied up, which is good - and then he pushes himself up on his arms to have a look around and finds that nothing is good at all.
"Yes, he did."
“Dee,” Cas says slowly, holding her eyes, “I am aware that intercourse is not always meaningful.”
“Then we fight,” Emmanuel says, mantling his wings, and Cas nods.
cas turns up in the middle of the night, and presses something small and glowing into dean's chest, eyes and mouth shining weirdly - dean thinks it's a dream, a mix of death resouling sam, cas having saved him from hell and cas going nuts.
There’s a weird feeling on his feet, and after a moment he realises Cas is taking his boots off, then his socks. Even though it seems like too much effort to open his eyes right now Dean can see him, kneeling on the floor in the t-shirt and ridiculous satin sleep pants he wears when Dean’s out for the night because he says the bed gets cold, hair sticking up on one side where he’s slept on it and those little frown lines over his nose that mean he disapproves of Dean working hard enough to burn out like this but won’t say anything because they could both repeat that argument in their sleep.
Shit happens - another band of Holdless crazies led by Lilith takes something of a disklike to them, Cas's involvement with them costs him his wing when they get caught out in the open one too many times (Southern doesn't have the tradition of Thread shelters the north does, and in any case they're visiting the reeeeally remote places), Sam falls in with the disgraced Healer Ruby and gets addicted to 'dragon's blood', and the dragonless man Lucifer takes far too close an interest in him and almost kidnaps him while Dean's off at the Weyr with Cas after Sam and Dean had a giant blow-out argument - but they get by. (Sam's psychic abilities translate into being able to talk to dragons as long as they're okay with it, like young Robinton)
The swans come with their own pond.

"Stop
"Hey now," Ollie objects, sounding wounded. "I'm right here. And I'll have you know I put a stop to all that when I left."
Sam rolls his eyes. "Yeah, great, thanks for that." He refolds the paper. "Well, there's nothing else in here that sounds suspicious, so I guess we'll just have to go talk to their parents."
"Dean," the dragon repeats, like she's committing it to memory, leaning forward so her snout almost touches his chest, like proximity adds to her sincerity. "Thank you for looking after me. And Cas." She draws away to yawn then, giving Dean an unfortunately clear view of all her sharp, curving teeth, and blinks at them like a child too late out of bed.
“Course,” Bobby adds, slanting a look at him from under his hat, “Cas helped.”
? you-"
“I’m sorry, I can’t leave her,” the aviator calls apologetically when he sees Dean, one had spread under the dragon’s jaw. “You’ll have to do it yourself.”
. He doesn’t even know where he is right now, or probably even
“We can share, you know,” the girl said, eyebrows raised, and Dean exchanged a glance with Ash and clambered aboard.
He falls into some kind of stupor, mind replaying over and over again all the things the angels could be doing to Emmy, to Cas. Both of them are still susceptible to holy oil, and to angel swords, but beyond that there’s just the sheer

“No, Dean,” Cas hissed after a moment, eyes still squeezed shut and teethmarks red around the base of his thumb. “That wouldn't help at all.”
there was a closet full of powerful sigils, sigils for binding and subduing angels. Then I went to get Cas, and you know what I found? Everything in ruins, and half a banishing sigil drawn out on the wall.”
Cas fixes Dean with a look. "I was unavailable at the time. I came as soon as I could."
it happens in s8 because whoops purgatory (it's not like she carries reams of condoms on her and cas said it wasn't exactly an environment condusive to life and anyway he'd never allow conception unless she wants it) (but it was the last night before they got to the portal and was essentially cas's parting gift to her - and don't think she didn't sock him one when they found him again because what the fuck is that thought process jesus SHE DID NOT FUCKING ASK FOR THIS AND SHE'D RATHER HAVE HIM, ALIVE - and when she thinks back he was kind of sweet and desperate and tender) the immediate freakout is whether the kid has enough grace to be affected by the fall.
Joshua’s face hardens. “Whether the heretic Castiel lives or dies is of no concern to us.”
Sam, fortunately, just bitchfaces at him and shoves on past, slamming the door behind him. Dean throws his clothes in the vague direction of his bed and collapses onto it, wrapping his hand back around his dick and feeling his freakin’
Rufus’s cabin is another house empty because its owner had allied himself with them once too often. His stuff, at least, is in tact, but Bobby took the best of it back to his. There is, Sam reflects, a whole trail of lives either ruined or destroyed thanks to them, and Rufus and Bobby and Jody are only the more recent ones. Kevin is another, and somewhere his mom’s probably going out of her mind with worry, but Hell isn’t exactly gonna be anyone’s first guess, and Sam himself has no way of getting him out; his soul has been passed around and battered so much he doubts any demon would trade it for a used car, never mind a freaking
. As I told you before, I am not here to perch on your shoulder; you and Sam are resourceful, I knew you would most likely resolve the situation without me.”
"So that's why you came in for the landing like someone put a pirhana in with the goldfish," Bobby says over him, and Cas shakes his head.
Dean knows that slurring of his name, knows that tone and the way Cas is shaking, just a little, and redoubles his efforts. One moment Cas is arching up into it and Dean’s fingers are digging into his hips, and the next second Cas has broken his hold and is all twisting skin under his palms, then there’s a hand hauling him up the bed by the t-shirt, which he just has the presence of mind to eel most of the way out of before he’s thrown down onto the mattress, though he still hears the fabric rip (he’s bought more new t-shirts in the last two years than in probably the rest of his life, and he really needs to see whether Cas can mojo them back together like he can his own clothes, or maybe start billing him for them).
Dean opens his mouth, trying desperately to think of a way to explain this away, when Cas says, low and dangerous, "Get away from them."
Stunt guy: Yeah, and then you- [mimes throwing a punch, and Misha nods and copies him, crowding into Jen’s space. She says something and Jen laughs with her whole body, relying on Misha’s grip on her jacket to balance her.]
A gangly kid edged out of line and up to the stool and Dean tuned out; “Barnes, Pamela” turned out to be the girl in front of him though, which snapped him back, dark haired and confident as she got Sorted into Gryffindor. Ash was next, looking remarkably calm, if kind of pale, and ended up in Hufflepuff, shoulders slumping in relief and grinning wide. "Bradbury, Charlotte" was also a Hufflepuff, but “Braedon, Lisa” went to Gryffindor, as did “Harvelle, Joanna” a little later, the blonde who’d beaten him and Ash to the boat.
A few days later, Dean had turned up on Lisa’s doorstep with an extra daemon and a blank expression, and she had stared at him for a moment, her parrot-daemon ruffling his feathers uneasily on her shoulder, then stood aside to let him in. Iope had stayed mostly in Dean’s room, hidden from Ben, and went into a kind of catatonic stupor, calling out for Sam whenever she managed a fitful sleep and otherwise staying in a silent huddle of gold and grey fur.
Dean rouses, manages to shake their joined hands. “Hey. Don’t you follow me any time soon.” His voice is fading, drowning, but he taps their hands to Sam’s chest, brushing past Iope to knock against his ribs, his heart. “’M not really leaving you.”
Dean shrugs, quick and angry. “If you want. You’re the ones he sent tripping into la-la-Lucifer land.”
“Don’t think that’s what I’ll be using it for,” Dean says coldly, picking it up. It’s cool and smooth to the touch. “If there’s any chance I can get to them before you guys do, don’t expect there to be anything left.” Joshua says something, but Dean isn’t listening anymore. “Don’t wait up,” he adds, over his shoulder, and kicks the door down.
“Hey sweetheart, you’re safe now.”
"no. your soul is strong, made stronger by your time in the pit, and grown as you are; this soul was new and the grace was still fragile and incomplete. they are intertwined, two halves of a whole."
Something slick and cool catches at his fingertip. Blood. Great, now he has to fight against bloodloss too, fuckin’ peachy.
They don’t go too far, although it’s so damn good to have Baby and an open road that Dean does indulge himself for a few minutes, puts his foot down and gives her her head, Tsalia’s purring swallowed up in the car’s. He doesn’t pull over anywhere special, just coasts to a stop, trusting that Cas will always find him.
They might be crazy serial killers, but at this point as long as their house is warm they can skin her as much as they like.
Cas slumps in on himself the moment he's seated, exhaling deeply. "Where's Sam?"
The next day seems normal until the evening, when they take Bobby out for a drink and a particularly raucous bachelorette party abducts Dean. He can’t really complain, since they’re all young and hot and keep buying him drinks, but he keeps catching glimpses of Sam and Bobby laughing at him. At least Bobby seems in a better mood.
"Attaboy. We'll- lube." Dean rolls away, goes to his duffel and brings the tube back to the bed, pausing at the edge. Cas looks back at him, waiting. "Can you maybe - clothes? I feel like a hooker here, like you're just here to get your rocks off and leave."
you? Crowley’s just
“They’re fine,” Dean says dismissively, and watches the newly-alert Poll wriggle his way out of his little lair to investigate the dropped glasses, then Dean’s foot. “Hey Poll. Yeah, I love you too buddy, but this is really not the place for you right now, so out.” Poll obediently turns and ambles out the door, and Dean follows him to shut it.
He’s got his head in his hands, Dean realises distantly, fingers curled tight enough to hurt, but he can’t really bring himself to notice or care about the pain. It’s just...inconsequential. Irrelevant. Because if this is a world, a universe, without Cas in it, then everything is irrelevant right now.
Sam finally wrangles his cell phone out of his pocket and squeezes Dee’s hand as he waits for it to boot up. “Hey, we don’t know that this is it, okay, it might just be a reaction to all this,” and he flicks his head up at the sky above them, ablaze with angels.
Sam, the bastard, has no such modesty. "I guess Novath won, huh?" he calls, and Cas blinks at him for a second then glances down at himself and flushes, smirk curving his mouth.
Dean introduces him to Benny, explains about their little get-out-of-jail-free card, and Benny sizes Cas up and asks bluntly why he abandoned Dean. Cas visibly steels himself, and the bird-daemon flutters up onto his shoulder, preening himself and avoiding eye contact, while Cas insists that the leviathans are after him and it's best if they just leave him so he can keep them away.
up on this shit, not the other way round, and if he’s gonna be too busy gettin’ high to keep an eye on me then I don’t-” He cuts himself off, punching a fist into the mattress and grinding it in. He leaves it like than for a moment then pulls it away. "I can manage without him, it's fine."
“I dunno, Gabriel was pretty short,” Sam teases, and Cas rolls his eyes, though they remain soft and crinkled in a smile.
," Dean says, and shovels the rest of the slice into his mouth at once. Daniel looks somewhere between amused and horrified, an expression he's obviously borrowed from Sam. And speaking of- "Where's my brother, anyway?" It comes out mostly as pie crumbs, but Daniel seems to understand just fine.
cas swallows, licks his dry lips. "she's so big now."
“Yeah, okay,” Sam interrupts wryly, and Dean grins at him, half-chewed toast between his teeth.
She walks him out and he goes with her on autopilot, too busy imagining holy fire and Emmy’s wide wide eyes; Cas’s eyes open and staring and ruined wings burned into the floor.
"How do you know? It is actually, I'm not having that stuff all cold and smeared all over my ass. Plus," and he drops Cas's hand and wraps his slippery hand around his own dick, which is perking up again, "it feels awesome." Cas's eyes zero in, pupils visibly dilating like it's the hottest thing he's ever seen, and yeah, that'll do it. Dean lets his head fall back, closes his eyes and amps up the appeciative noises he usually tries to stifle after a lifetime of Sam in the other bed, and almost feels Cas's gaze like a physical thing on his skin.
and dean throws the wrapping paper at him while he cackles, then tries to persuade emmy to smite him. emmy frowns between them, then bobby tells her it's just her da and uncle sam being idjits and distracts her with her other presents. she's intrigued though, and later she makes dean read it to her, sam sniggering from the other end of the couch and cas coming to lean on the kitchen doorjamb with his stripey apron on (dean prefers him clean-shaven).
"No," Emmanuel says, "I'm sure."
“Thank you, Dean,” he says formally, face serious but eyes amused, and then just like that, he’s gone, leaving only a rustle of wings behind him.
"farewell," joshua says gravely, nodding to them, and vanishes.
moving too, Dee’s arm round his waist and hand fisted tight in his shirt like it’ll hold him up, and her shoulders are solid under his arm. “C’mon, we’re goin’ outside, get you some fresh air. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other kiddo, that’s it, cause even though I’m super awesome I can’t carry all three of us.”
“Michael won't harm your brother,” Cas says firmly, and Dee shakes her head.
Tsalia jerks back; Dean stares at him. “You did what.”
"But like I said, I can't prove anything," Cas said with the slightest shrug, "and then it'd go down on my record as 'complaining about my peers' or 'falsely accusing my fellow prefects of malicious-' mmph!"
He brings Sam back to Dean, because where else would he go? Time has passed and it's dark when they appear, the streetlight washing them in orange, and the house lights are bright and warm. Dean is sitting down to supper, light glinting in his hair. He is smiling, happy, and Lisa and Ben are smiling back at him. Sam watches almost hungrily, a strange expression on his face, and then he turns away.
“Well, count me in any time you wanna blow off any more steam, but can you maybe send Sam to Hawaii or something first?”
Eventually he gently shoves her away and she lets him push her, flopping over sideways and keeping her paw on his arm. Dean scrubs his palms over his face, feeling the stubble rasp and swiping away the wetness on his cheeks. He wipes his hands on the sheet and rolls over to face Tsalia, resting his hand on her chest to feel her heartbeat, and resolutely closes his eyes again.
Dean drew his hand back. Cas spat potion onto the floor and blinked at him. His pupils were huge and dark in his dripping face, and he was staring at Dean’s mouth like he was hypnotized.
"At least she didn't start killing the firstborn." As soon as they get back to the Impala, he drops down into his seat and tips his head back to stare at the ceiling. "Hey Castiel! Got another piece of Moses' staff here, along with a kind of mini-plague of frogs." He waits for a moment, then adds, "You know, anytime you feel like gracing us with your presence."
“Why do you care?”
alastair’s surname is nott
She shrugs, liquid and and unconcerned. “But we are.”
you” and “you don’t even fucking care anyway” and “this is all just a bad trip to you, right?” - and Cas answers, quiet and reasonable but with a smirk lurking on his mouth, and under the table their daemons are tensed, not looking at each other but coiled like springs.
“It ensured your inability to run away. Also, I had hoped that you might be ameanable to leaving them on for later."
“Yeah, alright there candygram, put your damn stomach away, no one wants to see that,” Dean says, waving a hand, and Cas obediently drops the t-shirt and pulls the shirt back on. Sam is rolling his eyes again; Dean pretends not to notice. “At least it’s not a tramp stamp, I guess.”
Cas wasn’t tryin’a tell you something the other night?”
"Really?" Dean asks, leaning forward and practically
"Dean..." Bobby starts awkwardly, "son, what John said after that baseball game-" and Dean's shoulders hunch.
“Da!” The warmth of her little body seems to spread all through him, and the next second the searing pain in his leg and the stabbing pains in his arm are gone. Dean would love nothing more than to wrap his arms around her and hold her forever, but they have bigger things to worry about.
Everything died down when Professor McGonagall stood up again. “Firstly,” she said, looking round at all of them, “I must of course say welcome to our new students and welcome back to the old. I trust your summers were enjoyable, and I hope that you come back now ready and willing to learn all that we have to teach you. First-years, you should know that the Forbidden Forest is, surprising as it may be, forbidden to all students, that no magic is allowed in the corridors, and that the list of banned items is, as usual, pinned to Mr Flich’s office door and continues along the wall beside it. Any student wishing to play on their house Quidditch team should give their name to their Head of House, who will pass it on to the Quidditch Captain before the house trials are held, the dates of which will, I’m sure, be appearing in your common rooms in the next week or so. That is, I think, all,” she paused to look enquiringly at her colleagues, none of whom seemed inclined to mention anything else, “so all that remains is to wish you all goodnight, and to advise you not to stay up
have no vested interest in keeping little Sammy down here, I'm sure Lucifer will be
So Dean is maybe twenty minutes late to work, whoops - but Cas’ll still make his flight and now at least they’ve both got some good memories to tide them over for the next five days. It’s not like there’s anything important he has to do right now anyway, just a bunch of paperwork he’s been putting off and failing to palm off on Jo.
have a happy ending, okay? So you have to stop it, now, before it goes bad."
They sit like that for a long time.
[Jen climbs back up from her knees, smiling, and pushes playfully at Misha as she passes her. Misha hip-checks her back and Jen half-bulldozes her into the wall in return, both of them laughing.]
“Well I don’t want to.”
doesn’t know him and Cas are living together anyway.
! Anyway, you really think Lucifer will be contained by a little wall?"
dee just buys bigger clothes as she expands, "none of that maternity shit", and hunts until she gets unwieldy at like 6 months. sam and bobby buy ALL THE BABY BOOKS, and dee laughs at them and refuses to even crack a cover, though cas sneaks one sometimes and reads it avidly. he insists he can't tell the sex of the baby, can only sense it's soul (growing brighter and stronger by the day), and in any case souls are souls and have no gender. dee yells at him a lot and insists on foot massages and back massages and various other ailment remedies that cas is happy to provide, and cas talks to her belly just as he would to any of them, which dee finds hilarious. she takes to calling the baby "squirt" and "kiddo" and grumbles at it a lot, but in the way she grumbles at sam. sometimes sam even catches her singing to it, little snatches of melody or hummed riffs.
Dean stood and took the hat off, feeling vaguely like an imposter as he took the spare place at the Hufflepuff table, though the feeling quickly dissipated under the nods and smiles of his new fellows and Ash’s grin from a few seats down. Dad wouldn't mind; he was too busy being glad Dean got to go to Hogwarts at all.
A second later his knees go, and they brace him down, exchanging frantic looks. But he's human now, and they've both seen enough of death to recognise dying when they see it.
Dean gapes at him, even as a small part of his brain notes that they are damn lucky it’s only been the mistletoe interrupting them, especially with all this shouting. “Cas, what the fuck is wrong with you? It’s just a little fun! And don’t you fuckin’
“Cas!”
Another impact shakes the door.
“You smell like smoke,” Cas says carefully, dropping his pen onto the desk and twisting round to look at him, one hand going up to knead at the junction of neck and shoulder. The glasses make his gaze even more serious, blue eyes focused completely on Dean; not judging or assuming, just waiting.
outside, and she slams the door to keep the heat in the car for as long as possible, then shoves her hands into her pockets and starts walking, keys in one fist just in case some crazy hick turns up and can't be persuaded to help her first.
There’s this weird ringing in Dean’s ears. He feels like the earth’s just stopped spinning underneath him and he’s the only one who can feel the sudden lack of motion, his body still trying to move forward while stuck staying still. All his limbs feel sort of detached, like they’re suddenly full of cotton candy rather than muscle and bone. He’s kind of expecting to wake up at any moment, reality yawning out around him because this, this is not real.
, Dean,” Cas had said, firm and unmoved, and had straightened up and gone to see to Bobby.
to get her back.”
how I pictured this ending.”
"I'm sorry, I can't- just,
“She said she was dying,” Cas says hopefully. “Maybe we can wait her out.”
“That was...” Sam starts, running a hand through his hair. “That’s was a lifetime ago, Cas. I don’t even feel like I’m in the same
"what?"
"Cas?" Sam says, sudden and sharp, and Cas shakes his head, hair catching at the material of Dean's jacket.
“Yes,” Cas agrees, one hand still smoothing over Fergal’s ears. “Amelia is a vet, so she has a clinic here, and Dean fixes cars and other mechanical problems. As I said, it’s fortunate you found us; As you may have inferred, we're in the business of helping those who need it. I doubt the problem is too severe, and Dean's a good mechanic; you'll most likely be able to continue on your way by tomorrow evening. I hope there’s nowhere important you need to be?"
“Guess someone needs to,” Dean agrees after a moment of processing that. “So what, you want us to install you up in Rufus’s cabin and leave you there to ‘collate’?”
“Yeah, cause hunting’s a freakin’ cakewalk!” Dean snaps back, finally free to speak again. “I just
“I don’t- Cas, I don’t wanna hear it. Just- go.”
“Well look at you, turning up just as the action’s all over,” Dean says, tipping his head up to meet Cas’s eyes, and Cas makes a pissy little noise and jabs two fingers harder than necessary against his temple. “Ow, jesus. Thanks.”
Sam clicks his tongue and looks down his nose at him. “Well yeah Dean, it’s just come from a cow.”
"What are we talking about?" Sam asks, coming round to spawl all his gargantuan limbs over the other couch. The fire makes his hair glint gold.
the one where cas has been watching humans for long enough to get bored of sex because seriously there are only so many configurations guys, and he knows what to do kthx (even if dean doesn't)
Mrs Larson sees them looking and gathers her daughter into her lap. "I've told you everything I know, officers, and I'm sure you're very busy with the missing boys." Her voice has gone clipped and flat. "I'm sure you can show yourselves out."
“For what?” she asks shortly, growl rumbling under her words, daring him, and he knows she’s watching him, tail twitching.
"Hey Cas," he says aloud, clearing his throat, "you would've loved Disneyland, man. Sam's gonna turn into a giant five year-old, it'll be hilarious. Especially as he's about ten times too tall now for most of the rides he wants to go on. The last time we were there, he stuffed himself full of candyfloss and hotdogs then went on a rollercoater, it was not pretty..."
He skirts carefully around it and can’t hold in his gasp. It is indeed hurt - great clawed slashes across it’s flanks and belly, one wing hanging in ribbons so there's no wonder it was unable to control its descent. Its hide is pale grey, though whether that's natural or from shock Dean doesn’t know, and the colour only shows up the blood more clearly. Its chest is heaving from exertion, but though Dean listens he can’t hear any blood bubbling into its lungs, so that at least is some small relief.
“Hey,
“That’s not so bad,” Sam soothes, trying to scrabble for his cell without moving too much cause it makes him hack up what feels like his lungs. “And I mean, Cas said it was okay, right?”
there would have been dean getting increasingly comfortable with cat!Cas, and telling him "y'know, i kinda like you like this - you're a lot more expressive, and it's way easier to figure out what the fuck you're thinking about", probably while cas is sprawled over his chest purring and being stroked. balthazar would have turned up and changed him back, eventually - though not before suggesting a kiss, just to see if dean'll do it. he does.
Balthazar grins. “Were he human, I believe he’d drinking coffee on a park bench and feeding ducks his breakfast. Oh, he certainly doesn’t
They go on a grocery run the next day, so of course they go past a church just as the couple are leaving, confetti raining down and eleven pipers in police blue soundtracking their exit.
“Cas...” Dean tries, then makes his mouth work better and repeats it, flopping one arm out on the comforter like a dying fish. “Someone had t’ do it, ‘s important, we‘ve almost got ‘m.”
He takes the car up to Bobby’s near the end of the second week and tries not to treat it like a pilgrimage. Jody had told him gently when asked that nothing’s happened to the property, no one’s bought it or anything, and that she’s pretty sure no one will because it’d be too much work to clear it up and start over when there are empty houses closer to town. Sam leaves the car at the gate and walks in under the Singer Salvage sign, stopping to take it all in. The cars are all still there, rusting quietly away under the open sky, and if he keeps the house in the corner of his eye he can pretend it’s still whole, that Bobby might come out at any minute and scold him for standing around like a poleaxed chipmunk where there’s shit to get done. Eventually he gets up the courage to turn and look at it properly, blackened and broken open and empty, like a harbinger of its owner’s doom. The wallpaper inside is charred and smoke-damaged, the carefully-labeled phones melted and dead, all the books reduced to ash. The staircase to the cellar doesn’t look like it’ll support his weight anymore, but Iope drops down and picks her way past the wreck of the washing machines and all Bobby’s other detritus, and reports when she comes back that the panic room seems perfectly intact.
“Don’t care,” Dean says, pressing quick little kisses to Cas’s gorgeous swollen mouth, hearing his accent thicken with every word, “can fuckin’ walk in on me blowin’ you, I don’t fuckin’-”
“Okay,” Sam says, still a little doubtful, and Dean almost rolls his eyes but thinks better of it when it makes his head throb.
Definitely ex-military - and maybe Cas was something too, since there’s definitely history there. Dean smiles at her though, a little tireder and shadowed that before but taking some of the bleakness out of his words, and she smiles back. Her Aunt Ellie was out in the Middle East until '11 when she lost half her leg, and she gets that it's a thing that has to be talked about, but at the same time can't be dwelt on or treated too carefully or it becomes a black hole you can't escape.
Dean settles back down under the sheets, wriggling his toes against Tsalia’s leg just because he can and trying to imagine what it would be like if Tsalia was ignoring him, hated even being around him, and fucked off every night to god-knows-where just because she felt like rubbing it in. Tsalia twists so her head is resting his foot, growl rumbling through her jaw in a way that says she doesn’t like what he’s thinking about, and Dean presses his foot up into her warmth and obediently wipes his mind blank.
The room is huge, plush and amazing, and the only blemishes are the clothes scattered on the floor, shoes and socks and Dean’s jeans crumpled where they fell. The bed is practically its own continent, everything so stuffed full of feathers it feels like he’s floating on a giant marshmallow; the million pillows are kind of disarrayed, and a few have fallen onto the floor, and the sheet is all messed up and pulled free of its moorings.
"oh, well it's nice to know he can be relied on to stop cas goin' on some crazy powertrip but not the fucking
Dean thunks back down onto the couch, stares down at his hands hanging between his knees and the shadows on the floor from the sigils drawn on the window. Not that they're apparently any use. Probably he should be going through Bobby's books again and trying to figure out what they did wrong, but he just...can't bring himself to do it right now. Cas seems so damn
"i can see the first glimmers of its soul," cas says, flat and tightly-reined, and dee curls up tighter and wails "fuuuuck"
Emmanuel doesn’t fade from Tsalia’s grasp, the Empty plucks him away from her and she screams, throwing herself after him but there’s nothing there, nothing to grab for, the skin-crawling cold gone.
"don't you just love it when they do that."
The cold, hard floor under Dean is suddenly soft and plush, and he leans gratefully back into the couch cushions, feeling Emmy slide down a little so she’s curled next to him, head against his chest. “Thanks baby.” She hums acknowledgment and reaches up to lay a gentle hand over Cas’s heart.
“You need to go,” Cas breathes, tipping his head against Dean’s, and Dean shakes his head and twists forward, seeking his mouth again. “
Rufus’s cabin is isolated and quiet, but like Sioux Falls it’s too full of ghosts, and Sam leaves after a week, surprised to find himself missing the road and the familiarity of the car around him. He doesn’t remember feeling particularly homesick at college, but then he’d had people around him, and the full expanse of a new horizon open ahead.
“No, you don’t.” Cas’s eyes are almost glowing in the darkness, the faint promise of fury shining through. “I can’t just ‘stop it’, Dean, because the deal has already been made. Fifty thousand souls have already been loaned to me to prevent an immediate apocalypse, and despite my best efforts, that debt can only be re-payed with souls from Purgatory.”
“Well yeah, but I’m not suddenly some magic hacker or anything.”
“And you think
Cas nods, now stirring in the chocolate. "And she can be extremely possessive of people. Fergal, as you may have noticed, enjoys bringing people presents, and is too old to be considered an ideal pet; Pixie is...extremely excitable, and sometimes that leads to her chewing things. But we have a...soft spot for the unwanted, so we took them."
, Abaddon concedes.
Finally there's a whisper of displaced air, the grass bending under a sudden wind, and then Cas is in the circle, swaying slightly but offering the ghost of a smile when he registers them.
Adelaide fucking loves night driving. It's quiet, it's dark, the trees on either side of her are like something out of a fairytale, all bare branches in wrought-gothic patterns, and speckled inside and around the patterns they make are the stars, the moon slipping and sliding in and out of sight ahead and to her left.
Castiel hesitates. It’s not warm enough to comfortably sleep outside anymore at this time of year, but Dean can imagine him considering and immediately dismissing the idea of taking Dean’s family’s linen outside. “Of course. Let me just go and get my coat and I’ll be back.”
Cas drags his gaze over to Sam, who's got both arms circling his shoulders. His smile's as crooked as ever, but Sam returns it immediately, and the hand Cas raises to his face is steady.
His hands are still loose at his sides though, and seriously, he is such a
"No, Dean it's okay, I-" Sam says, then blinks and stares at Cas and Crowley. "Holy
sam clears his throat. "what, uh. what happened to castiel?"
“Is that-?” Dean asks, squinting into the sun, but Tsalia knows and is already bounding ahead. From the shade of the porch two lazing figures tip their beers to him, and a Great Dane and a rangy wolf come dashing out to meet Tsalia. The wolf hangs back after the initial exuberance, mouth open in a grin and tail wagging slowly, but Jac and Tsalia continue to roll around in the dirt like children, Tsalia laughing loud and free.
“We faced down the
By lunch the next day Cas was allowed out, Balthazar dropping by the Hufflepuff table to let Dean know.
“Just
I’m gonna do with her?” Dean had snapped at him, but he could hear the hollowness behind his words, the huge echoing empty space of his grief that he wasn’t thinking about now,
Cas's mouth quirks. "It's just over the ridge," he says, pointing ahead to the slight incline of the road.
He just stares at her though, eyes wide and dark and thumbs helplessly feathering over the curve of her hipbones, and she has to mentally readjust. All the guys she picks up on the road are in it for fun, just like her, and she hasn’t been with a virgin since...since she deflowered Tom Berringer when she was seventeen. And Cas...it’s already pretty obvious that he thinks she’s the best thing that ever happened to him, and it’s kind of her fault for not thinking that taking an angel’s virginity would be like, a cosmically huge deal, especially when it’s
"It's the least we can do for the Corps," Dean says easily, starting down the stairs. "And for an injured beast, even if she is the size of the barn."
“Muggle car, yeah?” Isaac asked from across the room, and Dean frowned over at him, cause what did it matter? “Hey, I was just asking.”
Winchester's + baby monsters, kthx. (Eve?)
