"Hey, hey, hey?" Peter said as he waved at her, trying to be as polite as possible in his franticness. His Spider Sense was being continually activated with everything that was going on around them, but the girl herself didn't appear to be a direct threat.
"Yep," said Tony. "Knock yourself out." He picked up his freshly refilled coffee cup, taking a large gulp as the hologram flickered several times before returning to its still, glowing state.
Obie was good with the company's numbers, but he was in no way an inventor or a scientist of any kind.
"That party that Peter was invited to today. Didn't you say the girl's father works for Damage Control?"
Enraged, Thanos jerked the gauntlet down, yanking Peter from his feet and sending him careening across the landscape just as a ship crashed down to the ground right on top of Thanos, bouncing along the surface before skidding to a halt about twenty-five metres away.
Tony shook his head and tipped a little closer. “You mean—you mean, that you were actually a virgin?”
Steve was smiling. He laid a hand very gently on Tony’s arm and added, “It was the best gift you could ever give me, and you don’t even want credit, do you?”
“Show off.  And you say you hate it when the press follows you around.  That helmet wasn’t designed to attract attention *at all.*”
Rogers brightened. He smiled at Tony and said, “It was my pleasure, Mr. Stark. I’m glad you liked it.”
Thank you all so much for your support!  Things have been rough in RL and your unflagging kindness means so much to me. This story is dear to me and it has been sad to be away from it for so long.
Steve opened his mouth, then shut it with a frown and asked, having clearly changed his mind: “So, what did Fury say to you?”
“And that insane memorabilia collection of Howard’s? Tony had me get ready to sell the whole thing at Christie’s—
At last the end credits began to roll and the team chatted pleasantly about the film--the quality of the acting, the CGI, the emotional impact of various scenes.
!” Tony yelled, leaping up off the couch. “What the fuck? Sulu managed to do his job and even save the day sometimes in TOS without bending over for anybody, be it officer, crew, or alien.”
“Many thanks, Sir James,” Tony said with a slight bow.  The knight led the way, up and up a winding passage carved into the cliff.  It led directly into the keep and Tony’s mind was buzzing with criticism.
“Hi, Pepper,” Steve said with a smile that looked perfectly genuine. “Glad you could join us. Did you have a nice trip over?”
“That’s a nice idea,” Bruce said slowly, pouring himself another cup of tea. “But I’m not sure, uh—“
In the silence that followed, Steve let out a long, deep sigh, a tension he’d hardly noticed finally leaving his body.  Tony let out a little snuffling noise and shifted slightly on his shoulder.  Steve held perfectly still.  Tony swore he slept like the dead once he fell asleep, but Steve hated to move and disturb him.  They could sit, just like this, a little longer.
Tony could feel people looking at him—maybe even staring—but it didn’t matter. He was fine. Better than fine—he was Iron Man. An Avenger. The new improved Tony Stark.
(Maybe the crying isn’t a bad thing?  Oh, yeah, ‘cause what people mean when they say ‘tears of joy’ is convulsive sobs.  Right.  Sure.)  The sound of Steve’s sobbing echoed loudly in Tony’s expansive bedroom.
Tony was still trying to find the right words to reply when Steve suddenly looked alarmed. He shook his head and said, urgently, finally looking at Tony, “It hasn’t happened often or anything! I’m really fine. It won’t interfere with the team. I can still do my duty. You can still trust me to--”
Tony’s hands scrabbled at the uniform as he nipped and kissed, gasping out “I’m sorry” and “I love you” and “
At last!  I wrote more!  I'd hoped to post this on New Year's, but the flu had other ideas....  Take good care of yourselves, everybody!
Then after a moment’s silence, Jackie asked brightly, “So, honey, you sure you’re still not interested in anal bleaching?”
“Mr. Steven Rogers,” Tony said, raising his glass and offering a little salute.  She padded barefoot to the bar.
, you can’t imagine . . .”  Steve’s brow was furrowed.  He sighed again, relaxing against Tony a little more.  When he spoke, he sounded more tired than angry:  “Mostly back then I tried not to think about it, the way I tried not to think about men.”  He paused.  “But when I did think about it, it made me feel
“Thanks for coming,” Steve began awkwardly.  “It isn’t mission related.  I just, there’s something I need to tell you all.”  His voice sounded calm, but he was pretty sure his smile looked strained.  Natasha and Clint were eerily poker-faced, Thor openly curious, and Bruce was smiling.  (Huh?)  They sat in a row on Tony’s absurdly long couch looking up while Steve hovered.  He forced himself to sit down in an armchair across.
“Tony,” Bruce sounded some combination of exasperated and disappointed.  “It’s a scientific fact that you have less muscle mass than a Dom—”
“Not quite sure yet, Cap,” Tony said. He hesitated, then added, “but I’d guess, nothing good. Be ready.”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark.  Uh, Dr. Banner,” the kid looked nervously between them.  “Would you please wait for just a moment?”
Fury rose to his feet.  “Stark has a poor track record, Captain.  This could be a PR disaster.”  Rogers tried to cut in, but Fury silenced him with a sharp hand gesture, “but, you make some good points.  Here it is, Stark,” Fury turned to look down at him, “You’re on the team as soon as you sign that contract and the Avengers move in.  If you stick to the contract for six months,
Tony was no closer to a script for talking to Rogers than before. He was sorely tempted to wait until tomorrow morning, but Cap had seemed so miserable . . .. and, well, Tony was feeling pretty wound up too. He’d just wing it and get it over with. Tony’d always been good under pressure. He grabbed the bottle of scotch, a second glass, and headed for the stairs. (Even Tony didn’t take the elevator for one floor.)
Romanov frowned very slightly.  “Are you really upset about the injection? Or that I’m not a sub?  Or was it the eval I wrote?”
Thank you so much for reading.  I'm honestly not doing very well at the moment, but I'm here, I'm queer, and I'm doing what I can. Comments especially appreciated in these dark days.  I hope this story is a comfort.
“Well, there you go.  He belongs in R&D!”  Tony unscrewed another tiny plate.  “Seriously, though.  He’s . . . moderately competent.  Which is high praise!  And what do you mean I’m hard to talk to?  I’m handsome and charming and--”  There was a loud noise coming from the emergency staircase.  (Huh.  Weird.  Sounds a bit like . . .)  “Uh, and I’ve even been told that I’m--”
“The net launcher looked pretty good,” Tony said to Clint, flipping up the faceplate.  “How’d it feel?”
he’d presented, like it was a celebration either way. (Unlike Ho— No. Shit. What was with him today?)
“I read about it when I woke up,” Steve said in a low voice. “Did you know that not a single piece of art went missing? After the War, all the treasures of the Louvre made their way home. That farmer—he had a da Vinci. He could have been rich. Beyond rich! But instead he returned it. They all did.” Steve smiled as he picked up his wine and took a sip, but the smile faded as he set it down and added, “The Jewish collections weren’t so lucky.”
“Jesus, babe!  Don’t sneak up on me like that!”  He pressed his palm to his chest and gasped dramatically.  “Ticker can’t handle it.”
“No,” Bruce snapped.  “I don’t want to hear about her calls, do you understand me?  I have a cell phone--if I want to pick up, I will. I don’t need you following me around reminding me!”
“Jake,” Steve said, nodding back.  “Thanks for the table.  It’s really swell.”  Steve smiled.  “Jake, this is Tony.”
The deployment satellite for Security Blanket was easy—there were plenty of those around they could just adapt. It was the unique mechanism that was hard to come up with.
“Jim invited me to spend Christmas with his family in Boston, but it sounded kind of . . . crowded.”
“Steve!”  Tony’s hand closed around his arm, but Steve shook him off, hard.  He sent Tony stumbling with the force of it.
Tony hovered uncertainly, eyes still adjusting to the almost blackness.  What might a super-soldier do if startled?
“These training modules you and JARVIS come up with are sure something.  Really something.”  Rogers shook his head.  “I know that you designed all of this, but sometimes it’s hard to grasp,” Rogers’ voice went a little soft, “I mean, it’s hard to believe it can exist at all, let alone that I know the fella who made it.”
“Oh God, I’m old!” Clint groaned in the elevator. “It’s barely one a.m. on New Year’s and I’m about to go to bed. Alone!”
Tony let out a startled laugh and looked up. Rogers was giving him this pleased little smile.  Tony blinked.  (You made me laugh.  Weird.)
No answer.  Tony shifted a little and looked down at Steve.  His eyes were shut, lashes damp against his cheeks, his mouth parted, face lax—he’d cried himself to sleep.
just fine and I’ve been indulging my boys’ obsession for decades now, so it feels like a holiday tradition at this point.”
“Then don’t,” Bruce spat. He slammed his fist down on the workbench, making Tony’s tools jump and clatter. The harsh clang echoed through the shop.
“Yes, of course,” Steve said, hurrying forward. Grateful not to be the pained spectator to their intimate scene any longer.
Tony took long deep breaths, trying to push away the idiotic stresses of the day, relaxing down into Steve’s embrace.  (He can make his own decisions.)  Tony listened to the calming sound of Steve’s long, steady breaths as he drifted easily back to sleep.  (He loves me.)  It was quiet in the tower, high above the sounds of the city.
It felt good, so good.  Kneeling.  The cock in his mouth.  The sounds of pleasure he dragged from Steve as he dragged his mouth up and down his Dominant’s cock.
Tony was relieved to find that the next episode in their lineup was a light and pleasant one. An alien race mistook Spock for a long-lost Philosopher King to (mostly) comic effect, while Sulu and Checkov engaged in a generally good-natured pilot rivalry.
Steve walked away from the bed, then paused, watching as Stark reached up to run a tender finger down her cheek. "Always cleaning up my messes, Ms. Potts," he slurred sadly, eyes full of--
So, I really hope you liked that!  Steve’s speech about Mary Jacobs was one of the foundational snippets I jotted down over a year ago when I was first thinking about this AU and conceiving of his backstory.  Needless to say, I’ve been eager to share it with you!  And I promise more revelations and good stuff to come!  (Yes, even le kinky sex. Eventually….)  Also, this story was originally going to be short—all done in 25 chapters.  Ha ha ha.  So, I’m guessing it will now be more like 50 something.  You’ve been warned!  :-)
basically what he’d meant. What he’d been obsessively envisioning, over and over: soft caresses, dark warm whispers, ‘I owe you a better time . . . I can make you feel,” a thread of unlikely tenderness to tether him to this brave new world.
“Look at you!” he exclaimed. “If I'd known it was that bad I would have agreed to take you today as a charity case. Seriously honey if those eyebrows got any bushier, we’d be gathering berries!”
“You’re--” There were tears pooling in Tony’s eyes; he tried not to blink, not wanting them to spill.  “You’re the kindest, most trustworthy, respectful Dominant I’ve ever--”. His breath hitched and he couldn’t finish, couldn’t force the words past the lump in his throat.
Steve nipped at his mark again and started kissing a trail down Tony’s chest to his hip until he was kneeling at Tony’s feet. Tony blinked.
Tom slid into the recessed doorway of Seminar Room 27, leaned back against it, and pretended to focus on his phone. He really needed to get a better cover game—he didn’t even like Candy Crush. He glanced up surreptitiously.
Tony shrugged. “Yeah. Surprised you can tell, actually. This isn’t packing the full guns, but it doesn’t require a landing strip.” Tony put on his sunglasses. “Of course,” he added, “I could just step out of the suit and leave it standing in lock-down if necessary, but I really don’t trust SHIELD around my suit unattended. No offense, Agents.”
Very slowly, Steve leaned down until his lips almost touched Tony’s throat; he took a deep shuddering breath of Tony’s scent.
Steve hurried for the gym, then realized he should at least work out and changed into his gym clothes.
This chapter is dedicated to my friend, A---, who recently came out to her parents.  I’m so happy for you, love.  (Her girlfriend will now be spending Christmas with them at the Parsonage.  Yay! All is well.)
“Scotch, please.” The bartender nodded, but as he turned for the bottle Tony amended, “Actually, make that a soda water.”
Steve’s expression clouded.  Tony was almost sorry he’d asked, but well, he really did want to know…
“In that case, how much longer do you think before we could slip off without being missed?  Because, I confess, I’ve got one last surprise for you back at the Tower and I’m getting . . . Eager to give it to you.”
“You didn’t,” Rogers said immediately.  “I was up.”  And Tony really wanted to ask about that, but was having trouble formulating the question and Rogers soon filled the silence.  “How can I help you, Mr. Stark?”
Bowed back and supported by Steve’s strong arms, Tony thrilled with every kiss, as time became a blur. Tony shivered with pleasure.
“Oh well, in that case,” Tony said and pressed another kiss to Steve’s lips. He was sorely tempted to tease with his tongue and press for more, but now was neither the right time nor the right place and he was capable of self-restraint. (Sometimes. Sort of.)
Tony groaned.  “I really shouldn’t have started this, should I? You’re never going to change my mind, you know.  Really I should blame myself—I thought showing you hokey old
“This is me!” Tony yelled. His hands cut through the air in sharp angry gestures; it felt like throwing a punch. “This is what I do and if you don't like it, fuck you! Fuck you, Steve! Just fuck the fuck off,
Tony’s heart pounded and the need to pull Steve close, take him in his arms and kiss him, was nearly overwhelming.
“Well this is a surprise,” Tony drawled, flipping his face plate up.  “First to the party instead of fashionably late.  Somebody alert the press.”  Tony unhooked his arm from Bruce’s waist and added, “Must be your influence, Bruce.”
“All right, Mr. Stark,” Rogers said politely.  He didn’t look very disappointed, which was good, but a little odd, right?  Didn’t he want Tony to say yes?  He almost looked like he was smiling very slightly, which couldn’t be right.  After a pause hardly long enough for Tony to be be confused, Rogers followed up with, “You designed those floating projection screens, right?”
“Nat and I were talking about it—she wants burgers from Freddie’s. Those canapés aren’t really food, you know? Late night burgers and
Steve nodded again a little uncertainly, then added, “Okay.  If you’re sure.”  Steve let out something like a chuckled.  “Uh, I’m really sorry to come crashing in like that.  Must have looked like an idiot.  I didn’t mean to be so . . . dramatic.”
“Yeah,” Tony breathed, and then he was pressing more firmly against Steve’s slicked entrance and pushing one slim fingertip inside, just barely, up to the first knuckle.  (Breathe—Tony told you to. . .)  Tony made a tiny circular motion, similar to before, but
“You’re amazing,” Tony murmured.  “Look at you—so fucking eager, like you can’t get enough.  You’re already so good at this.”
“I was planning to tweak those seams a little for you,” Tony said, half apology. “And I had a new double plating in the works.”
Steven’s eyes flicked across Tony’s costume and he said, “If you’ll forgive me for saying so, Prince Anthony, it seems you’ve come from a strange land too.  At least to me.”
And Tony nearly laughed out loud at that, amused and relieved all at once.  Because that’s what it came down to, wasn’t it?  If Tony ordered Steve to read up on BDSM, he was happy to obey.
“Oh, it’s fine,” Steve said. “I know your work’s important. I was just about to bring this down to you.”
Worst of all, every so often there came the gurgling, gasping sound of someone dying—their last breaths harsh and grating over the open comm. Then (almost as bad) there was the guilty sense of selfish relief the next time one of his people spoke and he confirmed, no, that hadn’t been Cap, Widow, or Hawk. (As if that made it better.)
“You okay?” Rogers asked. Tony nodded and received one of Cap’s most beautiful smiles. “I’m glad you’re here; Jim thought he could probably convince you to join us.”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Steve just gasped and twitched, he couldn’t seem to answer.  He was burning, his heart was pounding, he--
(And, yep, there wasn’t a doubt in his mind that Katie and Mikie had sent Danny to Ray’s themselves, but he couldn’t even be annoyed. Danny’d been so discreet about it that the team hadn’t even noticed him and the photos really were great press.)
Face pressed against the fabric of Steve’s shirt, Tony frowned.  It felt an awful lot like Steve was wrapping things up.  But that couldn’t be right. Right? They were just taking a breather.
Tony scooted closer, until his chest was flush with Steve’s massive back. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist.
“I'm not gonna give you a hard time about staying up all night-- honest!-- but I really think you should eat something. Brains run on fuel too, you know.”
It was half whisper and half gasp, a small helpless sound of want that Tony instantly wished undone. His brow furrowed. (Off script.) He frowned. (Was he allowed to—)
“Tsk, tsk,” Tony said. “I told them to have that thing locked and loaded when we left.  Somebody’s getting demerits for preparedness.”
When he rounded the corner, he found everyone settled: Clint and Natasha on the loveseat, Mrs. Rhodes in his armchair, and Steve, Bruce, Rhodey and Pepper in a tidy row on his long couch.
“Eventually?  Yeah.” Tony smiled at the thought.  “Steve’d never back down from a challenge, but it’s only been a couple of weeks.  For now, we’re keeping it quiet—only telling our friends.  I don’t want him to face the media circus before he’s ready.”
I'm also trying to make my works more welcoming for people with disabilities by adding image descriptions to all my fic so that people using screen readers won't be left out of the loop.

“That’s bullshit,” Tony repeated, taking a step closer.  For a second Steve thought Tony was going to jab him in the chest, but not playfully like he had with Rhodes.  “You were being weird.  And you wouldn’t have a drink with us.”
with the extra-crazy crazies; calling him “Mr. Stark”; rushing to get the door; cooking for people; “I didn’t realize you were Ms Pott’s sub;”  on and on, bits of conflicting information that never fit any one pattern.  Rogers and Bob, Bob and Rogers.  Two frustrating puzzles for which he was clearly missing key data points.
It only took an instant—the delicate scent of honeysuckle brought it all rushing back: Rebecca Martinez, Sam Deetz, and all the delightful reasons for his wonderfully sore muscles. Tony let his eyes flutter open. No sign of Sam, but Rebecca was curled up in her pink satin robe to his right, a tablet across her knees and a mug of coffee clutched in her left hand.
“Good. Malibu was gorgeous; Pep and I worked on our tans.”   Tony shrugged. “Of course, I’d be even better now if we could skip this gala, but it’ll probably be fine once we get there.”
Steve pulled Tony closer, until his head was laid against Steve’s massive chest. Steve stroked his hair.
Steve was in the shared kitchen eating breakfast, just a couple of slices of toast and a plain cup of coffee.  Something light and easy.  He’d had a glass of orange juice earlier.  Even after six months in the twenty-first century, daily orange juice still felt like an amazing luxury.
“And I told you, my ultra light polyaramid won’t get in the way of your Legolas impersonation, so calm down.”
“If you knew it was me, why the ‘non-traditional’ currency and so forth?” Tony asked, feeling wrong footed.
The arc reactor, in itself, was beautiful. It was a virtual miracle of engineering, wrought from pain and his own raw genius. The design was elegant, the blue of its glow arresting. It was the way it interrupted his chest (sudden, unnatural), the jagged ridges of scars that cried out—though it was beautiful—‘this doesn’t belong here.’
all living together," Katie said.  She shook her head and made a little snort of disapproval.  "We’ll have to be very careful to depict that as barracks-like not something more . . . intimate.” She reached up to push a few stray locks of blonde hair out of her face. “The tabloids will make the usual nasty remarks, but Mikey and I can probably limit any potential spillover into main stream media.”
Steve stroked his balls and Tony jerked up a little, then tried to hold still.  (Yeah, rude to choke your partner.  Also, diminishes the chances of repeat blowjobs.)
I respect Stark for that. And ANYBODY would look old and flawed next to A GENETICALLY MODIFIED VERSION OF HUMAN PERFECTION. 2/3
Tony tossed the extra scarf to Steve and wrapped his own scarf high around his neck. He added softly, gaze fixed on the floor, “You know, people assume deserts are always hot. But, at night? They actually get really cold. Even colder in caves.”
“So,” Clint said, toweling sweat from his hair, “on a scale of 1-10, how gross would it be for me to go up and devour some sandwiches
“Shit!  Sorry.  Uh,” Tony gestured a bit sheepishly at the projections.  “I fine tuned the repulsors so they operate on a scale using—”  (Seriously, he doesn’t want details!)  “Er, I created the equivalent of ‘phasers on stun.’”  Tony smirked.  “Just think!  Now you can tell me to go in ‘phasers on stun,’ like that other Captain you’re so inexplicably fond of.”
The pizza was delicious and the modest Malbec Jake suggested had just the right amount of spice to it.  They’d eaten two baskets of breadsticks already and had nearly finished demolishing their pizzas.  Instead of cheesy, stereotypical Italian restaurant music, Piaci’s was playing a strange mix—maybe Jake’s ipod on shuffle, which gave them Dylan, White Stripes, Rolling Stones, and some weird, ambient Icelandic band.  Tony was very pleased.
They’d discovered the creatures hated fire—their webs were particularly flammable—so now New York City was burning. Small controlled fires (for now) to help confine them to the park, but the smoke rising into the air filled Tony’s heart with dread. Too many memories.
Steve tilted him back in his arms a little and took his mouth in a kiss.  It was gentle and slow, like Steve had all the time in the world to keep Tony naked and spread in his lap, tied and wanting. Steve’s tongue was hot and heavy in his mouth, his hand solid and firm at the back of Tony’s neck.
Steve swallowed. “It was just cold and dark and hunger, on and on. Couldn’t move, couldn’t talk to each other, and the temperature just kept dropping.”
On day four, Bruce emerged from his room. (Or at least, emerged when Tony was around; presumably he hadn’t been resorting to a chamberpot all that time.)
Tony picked up a pen (Mont Blanc, of course) then set it down again.  Shit.  Right.  He needed a witness.  And he should probably read the contract again.  Sure, all twelve of his kids in legal had given him the green light and he’d read the damn thing five times already himself, but still.
I'm afraid it's still baby steps for Steve and Tony here, but I promise there will be more talking and (eventually!) sexy times.   Really!  :-)  Slow build is so slow, but we're making progress and I'll try not to leave you hanging too long. . . Thanks again for all your kindness and support!  (And patience!!!)  You are the best!
“I have another question,” the Captain said.  “I’ve been thinking about your projections and I was wondering—could you use them to make a . . . an illusory obstacle course, with projected targets that could move?”
“And, I think it’s pretty clear Artur Avila will win one next year,” Tony said, grabbing a third tonic water.
Tony resisted the temptation to laugh again; instead, he stroked a hand gently across Steve’s shoulder.
Cheer leading always appreciated--favorite detail? question? musings?-- but both kitty and I are actually doing pretty well right now, so it's not dire.  :)
“There’s a good deal of exaggeration, I’m afraid.”  The king gestured to himself with a rueful smile as he took his seat.  “No doubt you're disappointed,” he said.
(Sorry about before. Let’s be friends. Just friends though—no power exchange. Or sex. Just so we’re clear. Yeah.)
“I swear,” Steve said earnestly, “they won’t guess from me. I’m not gonna treat you any different now that you’re my fella. I can be professional. They won’t—“
Steve gave him a soft smile. "Is it bad of me to be glad that he's gone? I don't know, I didn't even meet the guy, but there was just something about the way he wrote his proposal that just didn't sit well with me."
"Yeah, sure," said Bruce. "But none of my PhDs are in repairing or flying an alien ship, so don't be too surprised when you get there and things are worse than they were."
"The Planck Scale is a set of universal limits that govern the laws of physics," explained Bruce. "It basically means that what you say you went through doesn't abide by those laws, and that not even the particles themselves abide by those laws."
Steve rasped as he captured Tony's lips again, kissing and nibbling as his free hand slipped underneath the front of Tony's shirt, gliding up to brush his thumb across his nipple. A soft whimper escaped Tony's throat as Steve's tongue plundered his mouth, finally pulling away to kiss down his cheek and jaw to his neck.
Tony bit his lip at the obvious concern in his son's voice, concern for his Papa, who he'd once feared he might never see again.
A flash of agonising pain flitted across Steve's face, his hands tightening around his belt. "All right," he said softly. "But can I do anything to help? I'm—I'm feeling pretty useless here, and—"
Smiling, Gwen cut a big slice of the cake, which was covered in a rich vanilla frosting, and handed it to Peter. He dug his fork into the spongy cake, bringing a large bite to his lips. It tasted just as yummy as Gwen had said, and it wasn't until Peter had eaten three more bites that his nose finally caught on to the smell he had noticed almost right away but hadn't quite processed since he was so upset.
"Yeah," Steve said. He gave his head a light shake before setting the datapad aside, settling in on Peter's opposite side and draping his arm across Peter's waist. "I'm sure we'll hear all about it in the morning."
is going on here?” Dad finally asked.  He plopped down onto the bed next to Peter, jerking his head towards the screen.  “Pete?  What is all this?  I’ve never seen this before!”
“I sure am, little guy,” Steve said.  He tossed Peter a smile across the shelf, relieved when Peter returned it without hesitation.  He’d been looking forward to this Friday evening all week, and was even more grateful that the anticipation had seemed to quell his nightmares a bit.  Tony’s insistence on pleading with him to get some help had led to their first bad argument a few days ago, an argument that had no doubt also been fuelled by some stressful issues that Tony was dealing with at work.  And while they had both since apologised, and had absolutely incredible makeup sex, Steve was still a bit on edge from it.
"Captain Rogers," another voice suddenly said from behind the crossed spears. The tall, regally-dressed man held up his hand, nodding to each of the women as they uncrossed their weapons. "It is all right, General Okoye," he said to the woman on the right. "I am expecting these guests."
"Not unless you count another goddamn riddle as 'useful'," grumbled Tony. "Said something to the effect of, if he tells me what happens, then it won't, or some other such bullshit."
"Theoretically, you'd think that would work," said Tony. "But the reality is that we have no way of knowing if it would since we've never done it before, and these aircraft aren't technically designed to be spacefaring. If this mission turns out to be a success then the next set of aircraft might be better designed for actual space exploration, but for the moment the X-302s are all we've got, and they were only designed to go into orbit."
Tony felt Steve's hand reach for his under the table, giving it a reassuring squeeze. "As long as we have someone inspect the box beforehand, I guess I'm okay with it," Steve said. "But Peter, we're gonna need you to stay with Uncle Thor at all times, okay? No going off on your own."
“Just… let Steve and I get to know each other on our own, okay?  ‘Cause something tells me that we’ll need to go kinda slow.”  He pressed a kiss to the top of Peter’s head, ruffling his soft curls.  “Can you do that for me, bud?”
"You want me to stay with you?" Bucky asked as Sam, Thor, and Natasha all headed off in the direction of the jet.
Gwen's cheeks flushed that beautiful pink colour that Uncle Bucky always insisted meant that she like-liked Peter, and she gave him a rather shy smile, making no attempt to take her hands off of him. "Oh… um… I was just seeing if you were ready for lunch. Since Ned's out today, I wasn't sure if you'd remember where the lunchroom was."
Bucky's blue eyes were downcast, glassy with unshed tears as he shook his head. "Stevie, he's not—he didn't—" He paused, pursing his lips in anger and disappointment as he looked directly at Steve. "You were supposed to catch him, but… you didn't. Why didn't you catch him? Now he's dead!"
And if he wasn't going crazy, which he knew was entirely possible, he could've sworn that the high-pitched piercing noise was getting louder.
"One of the reasons," answered Steve. He kissed his way over to Tony's temple, breathing in his incredible scent. "Just one of the millions,
Tapping his middle finger on the papers, Fury huffed out a sharp breath, his one visible eye narrowed.
"Sure, bud," Tony said with a smile. He'd never been able to resist Peter's infectious enthusiasm. He handed Peter the air container and his glasses, tapping Bucky lightly on the shoulder. "That okay with you?"
“Oh, yeah,” said Peter as he stuffed a Dorito into his mouth.  “I aced my geometry test and a pop quiz in civics, and—”
"What can I say?" he said as he reached for Sam, pulling him into a quick hug. "Congratulations, Sam. You couldn't've picked a better guy."
"You got it, buddy," Tony said as he ruffled Peter's already unruly curls. "Go on and start your homework now, yeah? Papa should be home soon with dinner."
Tony's beautiful brown eyes were shimmering with unshed tears as he shook his head. "Nope," he said. "It didn't pass."
"Yeah, that's right," said Uncle Bucky. "From what Steve's told us, as soon as he transmitted the code to activate the tesseract, JARVIS just up and disappeared."
"I'm pretty sure everyone in the class knows how smart you are, Peter," Gwen said, her green eyes twinkling as she looked at him. "I figured it out on my first day."
"That's the one," said Bucky. "Apparently this Richards guy completely painted the walls of his lab with himself, and Banner, well… from what Peter found it didn't go any better for him."
"You know it does, buddy," answered Tony as he ruffled Peter's hair, earning him a playful scowl. "I should just let you do all the tinkering here, it'd probably get done faster."
“How ‘bout you let Steve and I talk about it while I drive him back, yeah, bud?” Tony said as he stood up from the couch, with Steve quickly following suit.  “Think you can get yourself ready for bed while I’m gone?”
“Thanks.”  As he began to peruse the article, Peter’s jaw dropped open, almost unable to believe what he was reading.
"Shh, honey," Tony said as he wound his arms around Steve's neck, weaving his fingers into his thick blond hair. Steve hadn't said anything that Tony hadn't screamed into his own void on numerous occasions, but he knew that wasn't what Steve needed to hear at the moment.
After quieting the crowd, the announcer calls, “Set”.  Steve’s heart leaps into his throat as he bends down to grip the block and immediately hisses in pain.  He hasn’t practised starts in several weeks because they’ve become so hard on his shoulder, but this is a lot worse than he thought it would be.
"Just please do it quickly, Sharon!" Steve said, his heart nearly tearing in two at Peter's panicked gasps. "Please, he's terrified, and—!"
It was a move that Tony recognised from one of their training sessions. After discovering that Rhodey and Sam worked really well together, Steve had tasked them with developing a few of their own manoeuvres to incorporate into their training.
“There,” he murmured as he pressed down on a particularly sensitive spot on Steve’s scalp, earning a soft moan in response.  “Better now?”
"Yes," he said as he raised his left arm, the red Reality Stone glowing brightly. Peter gasped as the landscape suddenly began to change, displaying a beautiful, thriving planet, rich with plants and wildlife, the sky a beautiful blue to match the nearby lake.
Peter bit his lip, his eyes flicking towards a door about six feet away from his bed. "Um… well… I gotta go pee, and since Ms Sharon is off today I don't really feel like calling the nurse to help me get up, so… do you think you could—?"
Silence fell across the gym as the entire team gave a collective shudder, with Gwen finally clearing her throat.
"Stane?" Peter whispered, the very name hitting him like a suckerpunch to the gut. "But why in the hell would—I can't believe—Dad would
"The tall, strapping guy that you are now," Tony finished. He gave Steve's hand a light squeeze. "And then you thought you needed to change your personality to match, hmm?"
"The boy," the blue chick—her name had escaped Tony's mind at the moment—suddenly said, causing Tony to jump. Her voice was raspy, a bit like Natasha's except a bit more… mechanical-sounding.
He had just finished activating the clone and rechecking the equipment in his backpack when he heard the bathroom door open and the
“Ah huh,” Tony said as he reached for his coffee cup.  “And how much of this stuff could we make in, say… an hour?”
"Copy that!" said Dad from somewhere Peter couldn't quite see, and he almost collapsed with relief. Dad was here. They were all gonna be okay now.
Steve leaned closer as Peter shifted the laptop towards him, chuckling as he watched Clint wake up from his spot on the Compound's living room couch to find his entire complement of arrows arranged in a sort of elaborate pyramid shape across his torso, essentially pinning him to the cushions. It was funny, and something he could definitely see the twins thinking up.
Obie frowned, so deeply he appeared almost menacing.  “All right?  And?  Maybe I’m missing something here, Tony, but I’m just not understanding your point, and—”
General O'Brien cleared his throat, his expression one of thinly veiled amusement mixed with suspicion.
"Yes, that's a good way to put it," Grandma agreed. "He was also ambitious, power-hungry, and far too willing to bulldoze over anyone who got in his way for my taste." A sort of dreamy look crossed her face. "And then there was Joseph."
Until they were able to meet with the SHIELD geneticist and hopefully get some answers for Peter's strange symptoms, Steve had a feeling there would be a lot more exploded eggs in his future.
Frowning, Peter pulled out his computers, setting them up in front of him with his tablet at the ready. No sense in wasting the opportunity to work on the files before the wee hours of the morning.
"Oh, but I want to," Tony replied, shooting him a rather cheeky grin. "Besides, aren't orgasms one of nature's best pain relievers?"
“I’m sorry, Steve, I really didn't think it would be a problem,” Lorraine adds.  “Do you want me to cancel the appointment?”
Tony, informing him that he was no longer a boy but a man, and a man of whom he was most proud, indeed.
It was the longest relationship that Tony had ever had. Before Steve, Tony had always freaked out around the sixteen-month mark and ended things, too scared of commitment to want to continue any further.
"Yes, Agent Romanoff. The beef stroganoff you have prepared has reached its optimum temperature," answered JARVIS. "I have therefore adjusted the stovetop temperature."
Somehow, though, only Hammer ended up going to prison for it, as Regina simply up and disappeared.  Leaving Tony’s heart in complete shambles and his life on a sharp downward spiral.
its arrival, reaching for Tony's hand again as they stepped inside, his fingertip rubbing back and forth along the smooth metal of the ring on Tony's third finger.
"We know, Peter," Papa said softly, kissing the top of Peter's head. "Uncle Bucky could hear the words in his mind too, which is why Uncle Sam got him right out of here as soon as possible. He wasn't gone yet, but he was slipping."
when his gaze happened to slip down to the second shelf from the bottom, where he noticed a few boxed sets of the
Steve's heart immediately began to thud, his hand shaking lightly on the throttle as he carefully manoeuvred his aircraft out of the hangar, followed by Carol and the rest of the A-shift pilots. He'd half-expected General O'Brien or one of his so-called "parliament" to show up at the hangar, perhaps to give a speech or something since from what he knew the Phoenix mission was still a first for the Langaran Air Corps. But there had been no sign of him or anyone else, and it both puzzled and worried Steve.
Tony scoffed, backing out of her reach. “Sure, I’m doing his boy toy’s dirty work. What, is he looking to put a rush order on perfection? That’s not how things fly around here. I’ve got bigger fish to fry than fixing HYDRA’s trash. I’ll get to it when I get to it.”
"Eh, not necessarily, but that'd make the most sense." Dad picked up one of Uncle Bruce's notebooks, flipping through it. "We haven't found anything on possible prison facilities in any of the documents that we've decoded, but knowing HYDRA they could be hiding in any number of places." He tapped his chin, thinking. "I'll tell Clint and Nat about it, I'm sure it'd at least help them rule out a few places, but there's a lot of goddamn water on this planet, so I'm not really sure if it narrows it down all that much."
"Mmm," grumbled Colonel Phillips, tilting his head. "You look distracted, Rogers. Something on your mind?"
Even on the battlefields of the war they had stopped to bury their dead once the shooting had paused. That way soldiers were at least granted the opportunity for closure, to say goodbye to fallen comrades.
"We need to do it now!" cried Bucky as he rapidly took out three more war dogs. He shot Steve a concerned glance as he swapped out his ammunition clip. "Стиви, these things aren't slowin' down at all!"
This holiday had been so good for the team. Not only had they all been working their fingers to the bone pretty much ever since the ice incident up at the Compound the previous summer, but Steve also hadn't quite realised just how low the overall team morale was getting until he noticed an immediate difference almost as soon as the jet departed New York City's airspace.
Tony blinked as he hung up the phone, still trying to figure out what had gotten Peter so giggly to the point where he was squeaking.
"Mmm. Deputy police chief, hmm?" Dad said, raising his eyebrows. "Well, I highly doubt that she's smarter than you, buddy, 'cause we all know that's impossible."
"That's what I first thought as well," said Hill. "But we've gone over the evidence three times already, and it still points in the same direction. The fact that the king was touring the hospital was not public knowledge, so it's entirely possible that the people behind this truly didn't know he was here."
“At long last is lasting a little long, boys,” Natasha pipes up over the sound of a smattering of machine gunshots.  “So what do ya say we speed things up a bit, huh?”
"Sorry, guys, I might've gotten a little ahead of myself there," answered Bruce, shooting them both an apologetic glance. "Looks like all I've managed to uncover is a few more names."
"I understand it perfectly, Tony," Steve cut in. "You're saying that this mission, this one mission could completely end the war?"
"Uh huh!" Gwen gasped, nodding as her fingertips dug into Peter's arm. "Peter, what—what's happening? What is this?"
"Yeah, and I got one in the crosshairs," Clint said. He drew back his bow, aiming it towards a shadow to the right of the main entrance and firing. "Bullseye."
Summoning what remained of his strength, Steve turned away from Tony and Peter and looked directly at the window, shaking his head.
"That information is currently on a need-to-know basis, Captain," added Phillips. "And I can assure you that as soon as it's necessary for you to know, you will know."
sputtered Strange, still staring at Peter in fascination. "Does this have anything to do with his coma?"
The next three towers are taken in much the same manner, so swiftly that Steve’s almost lulled into a sense of semi-security when a booming klaxon alarm suddenly starts blaring from the main building, interspersed with an intruder alert broadcasted in German.
"Yes, sir," Steve said as he entered the vast office space, sweeping past the private who served as Phillips's secretary with a brief salute before making his way into Phillips's inner office.
"Which then meant that Langara had to as well," Tony muttered, scowling. "Gotta keep the playing field level, right?"
But his final word was lost in a burst of static, one so loud that Steve flinched. He squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in deeply through his nose. He couldn't afford to lose control now.
"Okay, so… what was different?" asked Sam. "'Cause I have a feeling that's what's throwing you off here."
Family and stability. Steve had craved those things for as long as he could remember, and now that he had them, or at least had the family part, all he wanted was to hang onto them.
This chapter contains clinical descriptions of some pretty severe injuries.  It is nothing that I would consider overtly graphic, but please be aware if you are sensitive to that kind of thing.  💖
"Well, I was getting the hang of it," Bruce sheepishly said as he dug some embedded grass from his faceplate. "Don't worry, Cap, I'll be okay."
Which was very likely the reason why Barnes had asked Steve to ask him to look at Barnes' arm, rather than asking Tony himself. Tony knew Barnes still thought that he had to walk on eggshells around him, and if he was being truly honest, he really didn't know how he felt about it. On the one hand, according to Steve, Barnes didn't hesitate to dive right into a huge vat of fire to rescue Peter at the end of the bunker battle, and Tony knew Steve would never lie to him about something like that.
"Y-yes," Steve stammered, clearing his throat. "Yes, thank you, Gwen, I appreciate you telling me this. And I'm very sorry for your own losses as well."
The planet was going to be saved and Dad was going to be okay. The two goals that Peter had set out to accomplish before he ran out of time were, at least for the moment, both going to happen.
"My dad didn't get to choose his father, and neither did I," he added. "But my dad's a good man, and he works harder than anyone I've ever seen. I wouldn't trade him for anyone."
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"Come here, honey," Tony murmured once he felt capable of speech, winding his arms around Steve's neck. He pressed a long kiss to Steve's lips before tucking his head under his chin, stroking his fingers through the hair on the back of his neck.
"There's the magic word, honey," Tony murmured, now planting kisses all along the length of Steve's cock. And then,
And every single one of those discussions had come to the same conclusion: going back to reverse the snap by essentially preventing the snap from occurring was the only way to prevent the absolute pandemonium that had ensued as a result of it. Steve had explained how difficult those early days were to Tony during his convalescence after breaking his hands, telling him it was even more difficult to coordinate than the bombing of London had been during the war. The near-collapse of many of the world's governments, the halting of trade routes for food and other essential supplies, and the crashing of airplanes, trains, and cars as their pilots and drivers disappeared, leading to even more deaths.
"No, not with either of you." A knot rose in Steve's throat at the memory of the first time he laid eyes on Tony and Peter, sitting there in the middle of that endless desert, the horrible blue colour of Peter's split and cracked lips as he lay completely motionless in Tony's arms, and the heart-stopping panic on Tony's face as he begged Steve to do something,
Sensation made even more powerful by the fact that he knew Tony loved him beyond reason, just as he loved him.
"Actually, I don't think we're gonna be able to," Peter said. He glanced down at the panel he'd been trying to decipher for over an hour. "'Cause if I've been able to figure this out correctly, which I think I have—"
Sam shot Bucky a harsh look. "Yeah, okay, but if that's the case, wouldn't it be better that we have these things than someone else?"
"Not unless you call seeing the occasional comet zoom by weird," said Carol. "I hate to say it, but it's actually kinda relaxing."
Pepper gave him a relieved smile. "Well, they're all from the R&D Department, or I wouldn't even be bothering you with them. Mainly what I've noticed is that the project leader signing off on the reviews is giving the exact same comments to most of his subordinates, which to me makes it look like he's not even reading them, which in a company this size just isn't acceptable, and—"
Several heartbeats passed before Steve’s pain-addled mind was able to catch up with Doctor List’s proclamation, and all of the ramifications behind it.
"No way," Tony said rapidly, earning a frown in return. He brought his hands up to rest on Steve's biceps, giving them a light squeeze. "We need to get started on your suit now."
"Oh yeah, I was. Like so exhausted I was almost psychotic, exhausted," Tony said with wide eyes. "And when I woke up four hours later with my neck all wonky and aching and Pete was still asleep, I actually panicked for a second or two, thinking he was dead."
"That is quite likely," agreed Thor. "But I still maintain that it should be me. I am the least likely to perish in the attempt."
"I don't think I could handle him being under like that again, Steve," he admitted. "I don't—I just can't—"
And Steve had to admit that he needed it as well. Routines were good. They tended to help keep his mind from sinking into those deep, dark places where the demons liked to hide.
"Pete, you all right?" Dad called from somewhere on the opposite side of the ship. "I can't see you!"
Steve smiled, showing off his dimple and sending a burst of warmth spreading across Tony’s chest.  Even after almost a year together—
It would be dangerous, and Peter would have to figure out how in the hell he'd be able to get away from his family long enough to make the trip. But if it meant that he would be able to find his papa and expose the rest of HYDRA for all the world to see, then it would be more than worth the risk.
"No!" he cried, looking up at the kind nurse with pleading eyes. "Ms Sharon, you of all people know that there's no hope for me, so please, just let me do this! Let me save my papa before it's too late!"
"I wanted to go for three, but the government put an ixnay on that one, so…" Tony continued. "They did at least create the thermodynamic astrophysics major for me though. Or let me create it. I pretty much taught it to myself."
Before Steve could even react, Thor himself was launched from the ground, hurtling through the air before crashing down at least two hundred metres away.
"And after you walk me to my seat, you'll continue on up the centre of the aisle while Steven and Tony enter in from their opposite sides," Grandma said as she helped Peter tighten the knot on his tie. "Then all three of you will be up there together while your dads say their vows."
Then again, Tony was also certain that if he went to work in the lab, Steve would simply follow him there, which would also mean that he wouldn't be sleeping.
A chorus of affirmative mumbles floated up from Natasha, Bucky, and the twins as they all snapped their seatbelts into place. Peter craned his neck as they approached, trying to get a better look, while, despite Steve's assurances, Tony still found himself holding his breath as they approached the dense treetops, letting it out through his teeth as the jet suddenly passed through what appeared to be some kind of protective shield.
After securing the Stacys inside the Tower and collecting all of their gear, including Tony's Veronica armour, the team had made a quick stop in D.C. to pick up James and then taken off for Wakanda. King T'Challa had promised Steve the full use of his warriors for the presumed battle that lay ahead, for which Steve was both grateful and relieved.
But based on what Grandpa had told Peter—and multiple times too, since he often tended to forget what he'd told him—his arrest had been nothing but a frame. That he had been set up from the very beginning by a disgruntled colleague who had somehow fled the country—apparently along with some super-secret Langaran military tech—by the time Grandpa was released from custody and hadn't been seen or heard from since.
Bucky's eyes went wide, then narrowed. "No, I wasn't late—hold on. Did Sam really tell you I was an hour late?"
“Yeah, it’s been pretty steady in here today,” answered Steve.  “But are you all right?  You sound… upset.”
They made more small talk through the rest of their meal, including dessert—a chocolate soufflé something-or-other that Steve had wanted to order—and coffee. It was very relaxing and romantic, and after the stress of the Registration Act and the MAUDE experiments, Tony was immensely grateful for it.
"Yeah you are, kiddo, but it's okay," said Auntie Nat, elbowing Uncle Clint hard enough in the ribs to cause him to yelp. "There's no need to rush that stuff, you've got plenty of time."
"I can ask Pepper about it the next time I talk to her," Tony said, rather sheepishly. "'Cause I honestly don't even remember where she has it stored, so—"
Peter drops his gaze to the table, tracing a pattern with his finger as he tries to come up with the best way to answer the question.
"Steve!" Tony cried as his body bowed up like a bowstring, ready to snap. "Honey, now you're just teasing me!"
"Eh, it was okay, and yes, I did," Steve said, trying and failing to not immediately conjure an image of Anthony Stark in his mind. "But I'd rather not talk about my work, if that's okay with you."
“Very good, sir,” JARVIS replied.  A second later, the glowing blue Jericho hologram appeared.  Tony picked up his coffee cup as the simulation began, watching Obie’s face as it ran.
Which was why Tony had been so gung-ho about getting his new nanotechnology to work. Since the government had put an ixnay on his defence drone technology, saying it would set a "bad global tone" after the recent HYDRA upheaval, being able to carry a fully functional suit of armour around inside a handy-dandy little storage case at all times would help him feel a lot better about whatever possible threats were in the works. After being forced to wait on his armour too many times while his boys were in danger, Tony was already beyond frustrated that it'd taken as long as it had to figure it out. He was very close, he could tell, but still not quite close enough.
"Well, I should hope not," Tony retorted. "Otherwise all those fancy words you said at our wedding were just that. Words." He jerked his head towards the food, his beautiful brown eyes twinkling in the soft light of the hologram. "But you've always been a man of both words and action, so I guess I have no choice but to believe you."
"Oh," Peter squeaked, gripping the edge of the table so tightly that he heard the wood start to crack. "But… Liz's neighbourhood isn't even in the Midtown precinct, so why would your dad be involved?"
"He never officially retired or was discharged, so in my opinion he's still a member of the Army," Uncle James said. "He was just missing in action until SHIELD found him in the ice."
weird?—now that he thought about it, it was almost as though Dr Strange had been specifically waiting for the moment when Dad and the others disappeared.
Steve glared in Bucky's direction as he grabbed his bar of soap, running it across his chest. "What's that's supposed to mean?"
Another rifle shot off to his left caused Steve to snap around, just in time to see Bucky's triumphant wink.
"Well, then it'll be fine," said Peter. He inhaled a shaky breath, rubbing his freezing nose on Dad's chest. "We're the Avengers, right? So that means we don't lose."
Steve pressed another kiss to Tony's cheek as the elevator came to a stop, the doors sliding open to reveal a pair of guards standing in front of the nurses' station and two more posted down the hall, on either side of the door to Peter's room. Already Steve had overheard various medical personnel whispering about the crowds of reporters that had gathered at the hospital entrances, just waiting to catch a glimpse of the Langaran heroes who had overthrown the military dictatorship and restored peace to the planet. Several members of the Air Corps had already given interviews with Colonel Phillips's blessing, including Carol, John, Cam, and Colonel Rhodes—
"All right, Nat," said Steve. He glanced at the old-fashioned wall clock next to the door, placed there by Tony just for him. "It's almost 2315 now, so we'll be swinging by to pick you up around 0230."
Tony chuckled as he poured the steaming hot coffee into one of his favourite mugs, some silly craft project that Peter had made for him in the third grade. "Pardon me if I won't believe that until I see it. Or don't see it, as the case may be."
And then, the pure joy on Peter’s face as he proceeded to introduce his father to Steve, like he had been actually looking forward to it.
A leader who had then attempted to do just that by first identifying those people whom he considered to be domestic terrorists, simply because they happened to practise a religion that he didn't like.
"Stay behind me," he whispered as he peered through the peephole, drawing back in surprise when he saw his SHIELD colleague Hank Pym standing between two burly Langaran Safety Officers. Howard sucked in a deep breath, attempting to school his features into his normal look of disdain undercut with just enough curiosity to not be noticeable that he wore whenever he had to deal with Pym and one of his many tantrums, outbursts that had grown even worse since the death of his wife.
Almost instantly Tony's mouth went dry. He had just seen Rogers earlier that day for his second simulator session, and he had seemed just fine.
"Yeah, I know, but…" Steve couldn't bring himself to finish his sentence, couldn't bring himself to admit that the last time he'd needed a wheelchair had been only a couple of weeks before his ma's fateful conversation with Chester Phillips, begging for Steve to be allowed to receive the Project Rebirth serum.
“T-Tony,” he rasps as he reaches a shaking hand towards him.  “Tony, please, can you look at me?  I—I need to talk to you.”
"Yeah, okay, but… I'm right, aren't I?" Peter asked. "Dad and Uncle Bruce found something in the data?"
Steve managed, his brain practically short-circuiting as Tony's mouth met his. Tony’s tongue swept past Steve’s lips just for a moment or two before he began trailing open-mouthed kisses down his chest, pausing to give attention to both of his nipples before continuing further down. Steve's hands fisted into the sheets, his entire body writhing in anticipation.
“Nah, I can’t imagine someone who could recognise that book set getting into too much trouble,” Steve said as he rang up Peter’s stuff.  He grimaced slightly as the total appeared on the register, giving Peter a worried glance.  “All right, so with tax everything comes to $265.13.  Are you sure it’s still going to be okay with your father?”
Steve's heart felt like a huge ball of lead as he stood on one of the hovering Wakandan warrior transports, zooming across the vast plain that stretched from the palace. A few metres from the transport was Bruce, running along in the Veronica armour as he attempted to get accustomed to it.
After saying a quick goodbye to Sarah, who promised to watch over Peter like a hawk, they were off, riding back to the base on Steve's motorcycle in a daze of fear and sorrow. Since he and Steve had already eaten dinner—if you could call picking at a plate of food for thirty minutes actually eating—they headed directly for their dark barracks room, with Steve making a beeline for the record player before the door had even closed.
Steve leaned against the bike as he watched Peter enter the school, dropping his head once the doors had closed behind him. As much as he might have liked trying to go back to bed once he got home, there was no way that he could. He and Sam had a meeting at ten, one that Steve had already rescheduled three times, and he wanted to get some more work done before that.
“Oh,” Steve chokes out, because of course if he’s freezing, then Tony’s probably even more so.  He opens his arms, his heart fluttering as Tony crawls into them, tucking his head under Steve’s chin.  Heat blooms across Steve’s chest as Tony curls his arm up around Steve’s neck and slides his leg across his waist, letting out a long, arduous breath once he’s settled.
"Sorry, asshole!" Peter yelled as he swung Fake Man over his head, crashing the armour to the floor. "But I don't think imitation is the best form of flattery here!"
"Oh, definitely," agreed Peter. "Papa could probably command a bunch of rocks to come to life and they'd do it."
Peter watched as Dad's jaw twitched, his fists clenching and unclenching as he tried to hold onto his temper.
There were plenty of men who had endured being held prisoner during the war, and if they could survive it, then so could he.
His arms sufficiently stretched, Steve lets them drop to his sides as he breathes in again, allowing the comforting scents of Lycra, rubber, and chlorine to wash over him.  Many people find the scent of chlorine harsh and distasteful, but Steve has loved it ever since the very first time he stepped out onto the pool deck.
"Well, from what Papa and Dad have told me about him, he kinda is sinister," said Peter. "Dad always says that he gives him the shivers."
"Accounting for the possibility of human error, that makes sense," agreed Tony. "But what are the chances of success if we're not able to secure the tesseract?"
"No, I didn't figure you had," Gwen said warily. "For someone who's as smart as you are, you can be kinda thick sometimes."
Peter smiled as he thought about Dad and Steve. If someone would've told him a few months ago that his father would meet and fall in love with an Air Corps pilot, Peter would've thought they were mad. But first impressions aside, Peter had quickly realised that Steve was the absolute best person his father could've chosen. Steve was kind, loyal, honest, and had told Peter over and over that he loved his father—and Peter as well—very much.
"For starters," said Tony. "I mean, whoever controls the military really has the ultimate control in a country, wouldn't you think? Hasn't that always been the case in the past?"
"Wasn't it obvious?" he rasped as he settled into the cradle of Tony's legs, sliding his t-shirt up his abdomen. "I wanna see you now."
But to Joseph's surprise the aircraft kept climbing, higher and higher until it had blended in with the bright beams from the sun. With fumbling fingers Joseph pulled down the sunshade on his helmet, grunting against the almost overwhelming brightness as he attempted to keep his eyes on the spot where it had disappeared.
"Um… thanks?" Peter said, frowning in bewilderment. That had been a bit too close for his comfort, but it wasn't like he could just sit there and watch Gwen break her computer. "I guess Auntie Nat's ballet lessons are finally starting to pay off. She's been trying to teach me to move like that since we started, so…"
his traitorous mind said, sending a wave of such overwhelming anguish through his body that he gasped, drawing the attention of Bucky sitting on the bench across from him.
"Now, you're sure that you have everything?" Papa said as they pulled into the school's parking lot. "Glasses? Earplugs? Snacks? Calculator? Pencils?"
That had been two nights ago, and ever since then both Peter and Tony had been bending over backwards to take care of Steve, and spoiling him completely rotten in the process. Tony had even already made Steve a new wedding ring, spending several hours in the lab to make sure it was as identical as possible to the one HYDRA stole from him, which made him even more determined to not wake Tony from his sound sleep just because he needed to use the bathroom.
"I'm still counting at least ten more hostiles inside the building," Sam said as he swooped overhead. "Nat and Thor have most of 'em pinned inside, and I've taken out at least three, but—"
"Thanks." Tony turned back to Lang, narrowing his eyes. "Now, am I correct in assuming that since you were able to hack into the bank records of those idiots that you stole from, that you're pretty good with cyber security?"
Rogers' gaze flicked to Tony then, and as the two brilliant pools of perfect azure blue met his own, a flash of something that Tony hadn't felt in a very long time lit up deep inside his gut, so strongly that it almost frightened him. Tony gulped as he instinctively tried to stamp down the unfamiliar sensation, locking it back away where it belonged. Now was
"Well, good. I'm glad we've finally got that taken care of," said Colonel Phillips. "Now, if the two of you are done with your questions, I think we're ready to get started."
"Three, by my count," said Rhodey as he flew past Tony, shooting as he went and managing to trap another suit between himself and the wall, taking it out with a well-aimed machine gun shot.
"Yeah, I know, but—" Peter broke off, his shoulders sagging in defeat. From what he could tell, Grandma was already barely holding herself together, and he didn't want to upset her even more.
“Yeah, well, that’s university politics for ya,” grumbles Natasha.  “Don't replace something until after it’s fallen apart.”
Shouldering his backpack, Peter hurried out of his room to find Dad and Uncle Bruce already waiting inside the elevator, with Uncle Bruce balancing his usual stack of rumpled papers and books while talking on the phone with Dr Cho. He and Dr Cho were co-writing a scientific paper describing the unique genetic mutations present in Peter, Pietro, and Wanda's DNA, and Peter knew Uncle Bruce was eager to get it finished so they could publish it. It was their thought that by acknowledging the presence of their DNA mutations that perhaps other people with similar mutations would come forward, opening doors to possible research into how and why these mutations were taking place. According to Wanda and Pietro, their father had been a so-called mutant as well, with the ability to manipulate metal, such that the HYDRA officials had been forced to imprison him in a cell made only out of plastic and fibreglass.
Not taking his eyes off the thumbnail, Tony gulps down some more coffee and clicks on the video, watching in awe as Steve wins his Olympic Trial race by a full half a second.  As soon as the race is over, Tony clicks on the next video, this one a replay of Steve’s Olympic victory in the 100-metre freestyle.
There was no sign of Chief Stacy or either of Peter's dads in the parking lot, so the three of them huddled close to the doors to wait for their rides home. They were deep in conversation about the next Lego set Ned was planning to buy when Liz came out, accompanied by her friend Betty Brant, who Peter knew Ned happened to have a crush on.
"Yes, but how does he decide what constitutes a mission?" asked Mr Stacy. "Gwen told us that the Avengers were just gone on one of these missions for over a week, but yet no one knows exactly what they were doing."
Like a young man, instead of a little boy.  All he’d needed was a dark maroon sport jacket and a pair of navy blue pants, and he could've easily passed for Tony in his junior year of boarding school.
He’s not sure if it’s a good thing or a bad thing when his first thought is how many times he’s going to have to hear Phillips tell him ‘I told you so’.  Or that his very next thought is how much he doesn’t care, because he just won a FUCKING GOLD MEDAL!
"Shuri's right, little guy," Steve forced out. He could tell that his own neck and cheek were covered with similar blisters, but there was no way in hell he was going to leave Tony's side at the moment. "Just… let her take care of you, okay?"
"Uhh, from Gwen," Peter stammered, gulping. "She told me not too long after Liz's dad got arrested that her dad had a friend that worked for the FBI, and whoever it was told Mr Stacy that they were moving Mr Toomes to some facility that you could only get to with a helicopter."
“What is this shit? Aliens invade, you’re first on the scene, and I have to hear about it from the Pentagon, Tones?”
Tony took a sharp little breath and Steve tensed.  (Shit!  You know better than to mention God to Tony!  Idiot.)  But then Tony ruffled Steve’s hair playfully and said in a teasing voice: “Miracle?  Pretty sure it was technology, Cap.”
When Steve’s questing fingers dipped between his cheeks and brushed against his hole, it took everything Tony had not to come.
open minded Domme and my birthday’s coming up. I bet she’d be willing to give her beloved husband that all-American spit-roast he’s always wanted.”
“JARVIS, run a comparison of the data points. First sign of a blip away from the last readings, I wanna know. If we get one, start running the hypotheticals asap.”
“Cash? Seriously?” Tony laughed. “These days wallets mostly hold credit cards and membership cards, but either way, I already beat you to it. I paid and tipped by card when I placed the order.”
Tony felt a sharp jolt of anxiety as Steve stepped back to check the ropes at his wrists again, clearly preparing to move on.
(“This is going to haunt you for the rest of your career!  Did you even think of that?  Tony, Tony my boy, I only want what’s best for you . . .”)
Then Tony leaned forward and took Steve’s cock in his mouth, all glorious wet hot pressure, while Steve arched and bucked—fucking up into Tony’s mouth, then fucking back onto Tony’s fingers, up and down, in and out.  Steve wailed and thrashed, wrists jerking against the restraints as he tried to keep them still, all his muscles tensed, desperate and overwhelmed and open and taken and cherished and loved and . . .
He thought he was immune to the shit they said about him—that there was nothing left they could say to get under his armor. Apparently he was wrong.
"So," Phillips said musingly.  "You've grown up in Brookline Castle--you've heard some of the threats facing Eire.  Raiders attacking the North Coast.  And we lost a lot of men to the recent famine, to the troubles. Helping Queensland beat back Hydra cost us dearly."
“Oh, that,” King Steven said, looking embarrassed, as he clambered off of his throne and led Tony to two carved chairs by the great hearth. “I’m afraid that story is getting quite out of hand.”
Steve’s eyes were unfocused, fuzzy on the middle distance. (Pained or pensive?) Tony felt a pang of worry. (Was he--)

. (Bruce suggested it, saying he thought Steve would especially like the hobbits. Tony suspected that was a reference to Steve’s former stature, but he wasn’t sure if he should be amused or indignant on Steve’s behalf.)
—except Steve and Mrs. Rhodes. Steve just said, “I’m sure I’ll like whatever you pick,” and Mrs. Rhodes seemed to be waiting for a consensus.
“Your eyes,” Tony told him softly.  “They’re the most stunning shade of blue, so wide and bright, and they’re always so full of emotion.  It’s a cliché that the eyes are windows into our souls, but . . .” Tony shrugged and glanced away, almost awkward.  When he looked back, Tony stared into Steve’s eyes and murmured, “so beautiful.”
Thanks for reading!  Really hope this chapter worked for you--it was harder to write than I expected!  Comments are cherished and adored!  Any favorite bits?  Curiosities? Musings?
“Is it?”  Tony blinked and withdrew his hand.   (Huh.)  He leaned against the conference table and raised one eyebrow.
An attractive man with lovely brown eyes and a neatly trimmed beard answered the door, wearing the white dress shirt and black slacks of a server’s uniform.
“Yes?”  Tony said without enthusiasm, making the statement a question, then he said more confidently, “Yes, of course I’ll read it.  I’m sure it will be fascinating.  Your prose style enlivens even the dullest documents!”
“I met the Avengers while you were napping,” Pepper said tentatively.  When Tony didn’t say anything, she asked, “How’s it going?”
Ew. Even more ew. How the hell did you write somebody a “hey, sorry you’re waking up alone” note that
“And the whole world’s heard a lot about Captain America,” Rhodes said, eyes bright, then added, “It’s an honor to meet you.”
Tony hesitated. “Hey, JAVIS?” he called softly. “How’s it going? I mean, Rogers’ history lessons and stuff.”
EPILOGUE / SERIES TEASER!  :  Tony and Natasha have a little chat after Steve and Tony’s first scene in A Model Patron.
As Tony studied the projected statistics, he grunted with disapproval.  SHIELD had only upped Kevlar’s para-aramid ratio from 5:1 to 5.7:1.  Pathetic.  Who the hell did they have on R&D?  Tony rolled his eyes and caught sight of the BLT at the end of his table.
Steve shifted his weight, looking down between their bodies to see his cock spreading Tony open; he ran his hand across Tony’s ass, then caressed Tony’s right leg and hiked it up higher.
Steve parked the bike in the garage and quickly shed his gear. The need to see Tony, to feel Tony, was an ache beneath his skin. Steve strode to the elevator.
Steve was all curled in on himself, knees up to his chest, arms tight, body closed off. Tony wanted to crawl across the couch and wriggle into Steve’s arms, offer him some human contact, some comfort, but he felt blocked—like he just . . . couldn’t.
He hadn’t even had the decency to keep it on the down low in a coatroom or a bathroom stall, let alone to get an actual hotel room like a mature adult.  (It would have been so fucking easy too.  They’d already been in a hotel for Christ’s sake!)  No, Tony just grabbed what’s-his-name by his tie, hopped over that little side railing right on the dance floor, stripped and—
“Guess it worked a little better than he’d meant it to,” Steve added with a rueful chuckle. “Once we got older, he was always giving me guff for getting into fights and having the shit kicked out of me.” Steve actually looked nostalgic for getting beat up, which was weird, but Tony kinda got it.
She was barely 5’2, so even Tony had to lean down to hug her, but despite her small frame she somehow made him feel fully enveloped. It was a long hug: a firm squeeze with a slight side to side motion that reminded Tony of the way she’d held him after--
“Tony, you just sent me a cryptic hand-written thank you note and a four-thousand dollar bouquet of flowers and shoes.  The last time you tried to
dirt— (Jesus.)  Tony shook himself.  (Well, that shit ends here.  Gonna make a uniform out of something other than fucking paper mache . . . )
“Definitely.” Tony licked his lips and added very softly, “Maybe you can draw me in another pose sometime soon.”
The king nodded with pleasure, then his eyes flicked down to Tony's . . . adornments.  He blushed again.
Tony scooted over and, after a moment’s hesitation, Steve put his arm around him. Tony curled closer and rested his cheek against Steve’s massive chest as Steve reached out to caress his hand.
“Not that I’m competitive or anything!” Rhodey added. “If Pepper and I did have some sort of weird friend rivalry—which we don’t—I’d obviously be winning, as the one who has known you for, like, a decade longer.”
They sat on the couch, trading long leisurely kisses. Tony was sorely tempted to climb into Steve’s lap again, but that hadn’t worked out as he’d hoped last time and he wasn’t eager to make the same mistake twice. Instead, Tony pivoted incrementally (stealthily!) as they kissed until they were facing one another, his left thigh pressed to Steve’s right.
They didn’t have to be friends.  He didn’t have to like Rogers.  They just had to work together, and Tony had managed to do business with some of the most disgusting orientationist jerkbags Wall Street had to offer.  Rogers was a kitten compared to Jordan Belford.  They could work together.
Tony checked his reflection over in the mirror, not a hair out of place.  He looked good. No way to improve on that. (Well, at
“It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with that problem.” Tony shrugged. “I thought if he had a friendly face and a comfy couch he might nod off while he tried to work. I’ve done it myself often enough.”
Tony glared at the glowing schematics, still running his fingers over the smooth surface of Dummy’s head.  He was itching to make something with his hands, but the new Bite needed more planning and its circuits would be too delicate after a few, er,
.”  Tony dropped kisses on Steve’s forehead and into his soft blond hair.  “I—thank you for telling me.”
“But Steve? Seriously? I mean, I love the guy—honest—but he seems like, well, kind of a prude. And you’re—“
“Twenty-two!” Clint shouted as a snowball slammed into the back of Natasha’s head. “Shouldn’t let your guard down.”
Tony leaned down and kissed him on the cheek.  (Oh my God.  In front of the team!)  Steve blushed, but it thrilled him.  (Not hiding. Never again.)
There was the quiet hum of the elevator approaching, much too soon to be Bruce with their lunch ready, so-- (Steve!) Tony looked up with a bright smile.
they’d be open about it (at least, he thought so) and tell the team, and SHIELD, and Katie & Mikie, and have a PR strategy and--
Tony sidled a little closer. Steve’s fists were clenched. Tony started to lay a hand on his arm, then thought better of it. He wanted to ask, “Are you okay?” or maybe “Do you want to talk about it?” but they both sounded so stupid that Tony just stood there, hands hanging awkwardly at his sides.
“Looking good, Rhodey,” Tony said, then glanced around. “Where’s this Miranda I’ve heard so much about? Is she—“
“Well,” he said, “it’s changed again. Not the same as any previous versions—unless, of course, this is just a stage we’ve never caught before, in which case who knows.”
Ah, fuck--there he was blushing again.  Tony leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder and murmured, “Back at ya.”
Tony nodded. “I think you must have bought out an entire toy store, though! No wonder wrapping has taken you a while; I was starting to wonder where you’d disappeared to.” Tony frowned. “But, hey, why are you doing all this down here? Why not set up at the dinning room table upstairs?”
Steve shuddered and held Tony tight, his cock and cum still deep in Tony’s body. Tony pulled a hand free and stroked Steve’s hair, his back in soothing caresses as Steve took long deep breaths with face pressed against Tony’s throat where he’d marked him.
Tony tried to focus on the body armor on his tablet, but something was tugging insistently at the back of his brain. Pepper and Rhodey had
Rogers gaped at him, wide-eyed and hurt.  “I can’t believe you thought I was . . .was saying you’re not worth anything except for. . . except--”  He waved a hand for emphasis; Rogers couldn’t even bring himself to say it.  He was breathing a little too fast and his hand on the table had clenched into a fist.
Hulk’s eyes turned brown and--in a now familiar transformation--he seemed to fold in on himself, leaving Bruce naked and trembling in his place. Nat hurried forward with his (redesigned) thermal robe.
“Of course, Tony,” she said.  (Something odd in her tone of voice.  Again.)  “Take care of yourself, okay?”
Tony licked his lips and nuzzled Steve’s thigh, letting his warm breaths fall on Steve’s pants. He ran his hands up Steve’s leg in a long smooth caress. Steve’s breath hitched and the sound of it went straight to Tony’s dick. He stroked Steve’s thigh with his hand, up and down, then let his fingers brush across Steve’s cock as he reached for his belt buckle.
Steve moved up and down, sucking Tony’s cock, loving the feel of it, then he pulled back to lap at the head with his tongue.  He wanted to touch Tony, wanted to touch himself.  He could break the cords-- of course he could-- but Tony put them there so Steve wanted them to stay.
“I was a dishwasher before I was a soldier, remember?” Steve said with a smile, rubbing cheese from one of the plates.
saying this, but I think you need a break. A watched pot never boils. Is that the right cliché? I dunno, but my point is you need to give yourself space to actually think or you’re just going to go crazy pushing yourself. We’ll get there. I mean, we’re geniuses, but maybe it’s time to let the Security Blanket marinate for a while. Ok?”
“If you don’t mind me taking it down with me,” Tony said, tone amiable, “it would be good to have something to nibble on while I work.”
Sorry about the horrible formatting glitch.  I have no idea how that happened, but apparently trying lots of different online RTF-HTML convertors eventually produced one that worked around whatever glitch was in my word file.  Baffled and really frustrated, but at least it's fixed.  Thanks to Michelle for the first very sweet heads up!
Tony had no idea what that particular painting looked like, but he could picture the rest of the scene so vividly: Steve on his knees in the hay with a lantern, gazing on the Madonna with rapt and hopeful devotion, tears standing in his eyes.
“Mrs. Rhodes,” Cap said, with a wide grin and unmistakable enthusiasm, “it’s such a pleasure to meet you. And, please, call me Steve.” He took her small hand in his giant one. “Your son is a wonderful man—it’s an honor to serve with him. You must be very proud.”
And for extreme extra clarity, there was an entire chart that repeated hard limits, the things Tony had taken entirely off the menu: scat and subspace. Scat because the thought of excrement in play gave him a shudder of revulsion—not the sexy, humiliated kind—and subspace because—
“Puh-lease,” Tony said, taking his chili.  “I went to boarding school.  They pumped culture into my veins.”  Steve wrinkled his nose at him.  “I can probably still recite—”
Then, more deliberately, Steve eased Tony back up and held him against his chest, breathing deeply. He let the ropes fall. Half-dizzy with lust, Tony felt a vague flicker of concern.  (What was--?)  Steve took another deep breath, kissed Tony’s forehead, and said, “Can you stand up now for me, sweetheart?”
“Have you seen these yet, James?” Mrs. Rhodes asked, flipping through her phone. “Your little cousin Benji had his presentation party last weekend.”
“You know how Pepper worries, Tony,” Rhodey said, tone conciliatory.  “Nobody will ever be good enough for you in her eyes.”  Tony let out an incredulous little snort.  “No, dude, don’t do that.  It’s true.”  Tony gave him a pointed look and Rhodey made a placating little hand gesture, adding, “Just because you two didn’t work out, doesn’t mean . . .”  Rhodey trailed off.  “Look, she’s probably just—I dunno—afraid this girl’s a gold digger or something.”
On Friday, Clint and Natasha invited everyone out for drinks with a bunch of other SHIELD agents, but Tony could think of few things less delightful than alcohol plus agents, so, nope! He heard Natasha on the phone with Steve, trying to coax him out and saying in a significant tone that
Tony stretched. “Morning, J,” he said around a yawn, trying to remember when he’d gone to bed. The three of them had binged on five—no, six—episodes of
“Oh, man, don’t try it. She's still pissed about the last grand gesture. Seriously, Tony, a convertible? For
After a few more minutes, Pepper pulled her foot away with a murmured 'thank you.'  Tony scooted closer to curl up against her, his head in her lap.  Pepper carded her fingers through his hair, softly and gently.  Not for the first time, Tony half-wished Pepper could be his Domme.  It was silly, almost childish.  They didn't fit together that way, much as they loved each other, but in these quiet moments (after the arc reactor, his mind whispered) he'd sometimes wished things could be different.
Tony frowned. She’d come to a stop next to a large grey door, unlabeled like the hallways, and took a little step closer.
Tony’d fallen for Howard’s entire shtick about Captain America—that even as little Steve Rogers, tiny and frail, he’d been the most macho Domliest Dom ever because courage and perseverance and all those other Important Dominant Virtues that proved he was no sub. And sure, the movies and comics and stuff showed he was small and never said, “Hey, guess what, folks? He thought he was gonna be a sub and so did everyone else!” but it was Howard,
(Tony didn’t actually want more coffee--it was sour in his stomach--but he knew an expression of affection when he saw one and was eager for what he could get.)
“Just one more thing,” Fury said. “If anything were to change, if you did run into problems or needed to renegotiate your contract—you could come to me. I hope you would.”
Thank you so much for joining me in the world of P&P!  It has been such a wonderful, happy, healing place for me and it's a joy to have you here with me.  Thank you.  *gives you a bashful Steve smile*
,” Tony sniffed. “And I’m down here to assess the damage on our suits. Then fix them. Yours included, so shut it.”
Tony bit his lip. He was definitely blushing now, the heat of it spreading down his neck to the arc reactor. But he’d already—they’d already— (It was ridiculous to be nervous!)
“All right then,”  Tony said with another shrug.  “ ‘cause I was thinking, you missed an awfully lot of classic movies and somebody really should start catching you up on that stuff.  We could have a marathon.  Do
“Mmm?”  He’d already returned to the workshop in his mind, trying to decide what needed his attention most.
Tony was frowning at the schematic in front of him.  (These circuits won’t bear that kind of power load.  Damn.)

“Tony!” Steve said, still smiling but perhaps a hint nervous as he hovered at the threshold.  Tony waved him inside.  “Are you busy?”
began, but even though he’d seen it several times, Tony couldn’t seem to catch any of the dialogue. Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart glided past, but couldn’t hold his attention. Tony’s hands felt clammy. Pepper’s fingers scratched lightly at his scalp, but couldn’t distract him from his thoughts.
“I wish people’d stop asking me that,” Tony grumbled, then relented. “Fine. I’m fine. Better now that I’ve seen some of the PR you’ve been doing.” Tony let out a low whistle.
Tony’d expected a squawk of protest from Clint, but he was unexpectedly absorbed in the newspaper that Steve had left out on the counter.
Tony turned to find Natasha, luminous in the light of the elevator, with a fur coat over her arm and wearing a beautiful burgundy dress with black velvet trim. Steve grabbed his coat from the back of the couch where it had laid unnoticed.
Tony rolled his eyes. He pressed his palm to the crate's pad (at least it's StarkTech) and then waited for the green light from the retinal scan. She held out the folder.
Tony was a little afraid that the often-heard “I’d better let you get some rest now” would be next, but instead Steve sank a little deeper on the couch and kept stroking his hip. So maybe now was the time?
Tony nodded and gave him a doe-eyed look. “America’s Darling Doms!” He let out a theatrical sigh. “They’re so dreamy . . . I have a google alert for new photos.”
, but then some of them . . . they kinda upset me and I had to get JARVIS to help me look it up and make sure it was all pretend, but it was--  after that, I stayed away from those things.”  Steve hurried on as if eager to prevent any follow up.  (Oh, I am so asking you about porn some other time!  That’s just—oh
So, the press conference was super hard to write, but I’m finally willing to accept the results and post so I can move on to the next part of the story.  Hope it works for you!
Tony took a sip of mulled wine and watched his teammates. Clint took a few more pictures. Steve unwrapped another wooden ornament and Tony’s chest felt a little tight.
“Yes, well,” she said in that matter-of-face voice she used to conceal her pleasure at a compliment.  “We’ll see.”
“Honestly,” Steve continued, “I’d think less of Fury if he hadn’t talked to us.  But to . . . to try and meddle with what we have, in the absence of any wrongdoing, that’s not. . . that’s . . .”
“You looked so pretty with your cheek pressed to my foot,” Tony said softly, tightening his grip on Steve’s neck.  His tone was almost pensive.  “I think I’d like to see you this way more often.”
Tony stumbled blearily into the kitchen.  Rogers was wearing his terrible suit and a red tie, looking like a parody of a 1950’s daddy Dom, a real paterfamilias with the team gathered around him at the counter.  (Though, he was holding a spatula, so not
Eventually Tony gave up on the buttons and started yanking at Steve’s belt. His hands flopped and fumbled, unable to get a good grasp.
“What?” he said, summoning a smile. “No, no. Just surprised. I mean—you’ve read my contract, right?”
Tony was researching his latest idea for a gift for Steve when he heard a knock on the workshop door.
“It was years later, talking to Father Gabe, I finally wondered if all those times as kids Buck had talked about the two of us opening a shop, going to California, just him and me ‘til the end of the line, if—“ Steve swallowed and his hands went tight on the railing for a moment. “--if maybe he’d been picturing it different from me.”
“Sir? Might I suggest that, as your personal assistant, Mrs. Abrogast is a more suitable recipient for this message than the CEO of Stark Industries.”

“Never mind,” Bruce cut him off, throwing his hands in the air. He took a deep breath and said more calmly. “Knowing will only make it worse. Just use the cookie cutters on the next set of dough, okay? Then you can decorate some when they come out. And stay on
And he did.  He may have felt a little silly, with his blue button-down done up, his trousers and underwear around his ankles, and his softening cock exposed to the air and (more troubling) the open bedroom door, but it was okay.  Tony had looped his arms around him and worked a hand up under Steve’s shirt to caress his stomach lightly.  Tony pressed a line of open-mouthed kisses to his neck, then pulled away to drag the duvet around them.  Steve sighed and settled back into Tony’s arms.  He synchronized his breathing to Tony’s, a soothing rhythm of in-out, in-out.  They laid like that for several minutes.
“Yeah,” Bruce plowed on, “Good.  And, well, he seems like a really kind person.  And I actually think he’s quite intelligent in his way.”
Tony hadn’t touched the circuitry or the motherboard since Rogers left over an hour ago. He’d just been sitting, thinking.
Steve’s breath caught. Stark was there, wearing an expensive suit—in ruins now—on all fours on floor.
Tony blinked. (Wait, did he mean--?) Rogers shook his head, expression amused. “That really was an accident, but they kept making me do the damn paperwork on this mini-device with a touch screen and, I mean, I’ve got such huge hands now and I’d never even
She rushed on, talking fast. “—and your involvement would be great for public relations both for the Safehouse—”
When Steve was done drying him off (with typical Steve thoroughness), he scooped Tony up into his arms and carried him to the bedroom where the lights were down low. Tony pressed his cheek to Steve’s bare shoulder, content to be carried.
“Good,” he said in a tone of immense satisfaction.  (With maybe an edge of something fierce and possessive?)  He held Tony a little tighter.  “Good.”
“I know what you want, Stark,” the guy murmured, voice pitched sultry. “You need it, don’t you? Need to be put in your place.”
“You didn’t do anything to take advantage,” Tony said. “And then you tapped out of training me anyway, right? It’s fine.”
“Hey, Tony? You hungry?” Rhodey called from the doorway. “Steve and I are gonna hit up Ray’s—wanna come?”
Steve swallowed, remembering the look in Tony’s eyes, somehow fierce and tender, as he’d given instructions, teaching Steve to take his cock.  He remembered Tony’s voice, rough and low, pouring out filthy praise that made his cheeks heat and his cock fill.  (
and even though of all people Rogers deserved a little leeway post-freeze, he never made excuses for himself or--
Tony glanced over, looking up from the corner of his eye, and found Steve smiling down at him, eyes bright and shining. It looked like hope. An answering smile—gentle, almost shy—spread across Tony’s face. They stood, the moments sliding by, just smiling at each other in silence.
Steve’s hips rolled subtly against Tony as he ran his hand up and down Tony’s side. He licked his lips, but didn’t interrupt; his eyes lingered on his dog tags around Tony’s neck. Tony struggled to keep the story moving.
. . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tony took a deep breath and tried it out, his gaze fixed on the coffee pot: “I feel like you don’t want to—“ (Fuck me.) “Uh, be
Tony relaxed into the mat again and closed his eyes. As soon as he caught his breath, he’d voice his surrender; since he’d played possum once already, Rogers probably wouldn’t let his guard down until then. Tony’s chest was still heaving a bit, but he was just getting ready to gasp out “I yield” or “you win, big guy” or “uncle!” when Rogers suddenly leapt off of him and backed away, putting distance between them.
“And let’s get images of Cap and Widow’s uniforms on screen ten, ok?  Post battle.  I want to see the damage.”
“You’re perfect,” Steve said, pressing in with his fingers again. “And I want you to come for me. Come whenever you’re ready, darling.”
“No, don’t,” Tony said, swirling his drink around in the tumbler, watching it leave elegant legs on the edge of the glass.
“Uh.”  Tony really only hesitated for a moment.  “Remember that secret initiative you know nothing about?”
(Things were good. And, hey, wasn’t ‘no sex ‘til the third date’ an old timey rule of thumb? Pretty sure it was.)
The Captain nodded.  “If SHIELD’s projections and your own are correct, it seems too soon, but the, uh, meditation thing you do?  Could you try doing that while we spar, so you can get used to holding your calm while we’re fighting?”
“Yeah, well, neither of you are supposed to get hurt!  How bad is it?  Did they at least manage to shoot off some of those ridiculous guns?”
“Come on!” Clint called.  “Apparently we only watch old-school sci-fi in this household and Steve insists
“You’re very bold,” Tony said, tightening his hand around Steve’s. He cast Steve an amused little look, then added, “And I don’t remember giving you permission to use my first name.”
“Okay,” Steve said, still frowning down. He glanced up for a moment and faltered, losing the rhythm. “Wish I weren’t tryin’ to learn this with everybody watching though.”
Tony’d gotten plenty of red and white roses in his time, but couldn’t remember getting yellow. (Or getting flowers
“Sorry,” he said abruptly, looking back at Tony. “I didn’t mean to go on and on.” He grimaced, embarrassed and apologetic. “Or talk about that. To you.”
Something reassuring. Tony should say something reassuring. He should, but he hadn’t had coffee yet, so that seemed like an impossible task. They stared at each other.
I really hope you enjoyed the new chapter and, hey, if you did now would be an extra sweet lovely time to write me a comment to say 'hi' or leave me with your musings, loves, curiosities, favorite detail, or whatever.
Katie blushed even more; Tony Y. threw his shoulders back a little and announced, putting his arm around her, “I’m having Christmas dinner with the O’Conner’s. Just wanted to make this del—er, one last delivery. Now we’re off for the night.”
The professor nodded and hesitated before speaking. “Actually, I may be able to refer you for something after all.  Won’t you step into my office, Mr. Rogers?”
,” Steve breathed his name reverently, like it was some sort of prayer.  He swallowed hard.  “Please.”
“I’ve been thinking about it, though,” Steve confessed.  “I mean, at first all this unstructured time was probably necessary.  It took me a long time to--” he hunted for the right words, “get comfortable here.  And a lot of work—reading, catching up—before I could start to, uh, to adjust.”  (There’s no shame admitting it was hard to adjust.)
Steve reveled in it, the strange privilege of seeing and touching Tony in this state, lax, trusting, half-asleep. Steve liked the thick lather of the soap, rich and creamy, with its gentle scent of sandalwood and something spicy he could only think of as 'Tony scent.' There was something satisfying about how grimy Tony was, the oil and grease streaking unexpected patches of sweaty skin, as if the pain of the last week had left these visible marks on Tony's body and Steve could undo that pain with a loving touch. It wasn't that simple, but if felt good all the same, like something pure and clean. (There's nothing wrong with us. This is love.)
“So, how’s Theresa?” Tony asked, eager to distract Jackie from the million beautifying procedures he didn’t want.
“It’s gonna go great. And we can go sooner, so we can get started,” Tony said. “I can make a few calls and—“
Fury paused and Bruce was silent.  Tony could see him considering it and that hurt. It really hurt.  Fine, so Bruce wasn’t going to be his Dom, but they’d had plans for inventions, projects, experiments and he’d been so happy to think of them sharing his beautiful (big, empty) Tower.  It was almost better that Bruce wouldn’t want to dominate him—he could live with Bruce as an equal at all times without any power exchange to negotiate, just the friendship of like minds.
Tony landed gently on the training room floor.  (He’d learned that lesson the hard way, thank you very much.)  Bruce sat cross-legged on the floor, right where they’d been training, dodging, weaving and shooting.  (No sign of the Other Guy.)
As the servers cleared away the remnants of their desert and digestif course, Tony noticed Steve was getting a little . . . antsy?  He kept glancing around and seemed unusually distracted, looking back into the ballroom.
Steve seemed to gather himself. “So, that’s why,” he said. “I haven’t been feeling very . . . sociable.”
“Here’s what we’re gonna do,” Tony said. “I’m gonna order us a gigantic pizza. While we wait for it, you’re gonna have a shower and change—because, frankly, you stink—and then you can join me in the workshop for food. Then, if you think you can sleep, you should go sleep. If not—and, trust me, I do understand—then we can work together in the shop. Okay?”
“Ah, also makes sense. He doesn’t know what to wear if it isn’t white and a lab coat.” A flash of something like hurt and jealousy reared its ugly head and Tony tampered it down. “How’s this for addressing a world of people pissed off at my existence?” He gestured to his outfit.
Tony knew what that sinking feeling was in his stomach; he had gotten his hopes up. He had imagined Steve groveling and begging for him to forgive him, to take him back. No, he didn’t need his forgiveness, much less deserve it. But these were his private thoughts and he could think whatever he wanted to.
Bruce sighed, shaking his head and glancing back towards the door. “We can’t keep fighting you, Tony. Especially not when it comes to your own wellbeing. You have to decide that you deserve to be healthy or we just can’t help you out.” He left with only the barest of glances towards the engineer.
Tony tossed his phone towards the end of his bed, sighing and relaxing heavily into his pillows. He knew that the government didn’t want the worst for the heroes, but they did expect obedience- and following the law. It was times like these when Tony was acutely aware of the influence and leeway he was given because of his status and the pull that he had within society. It was unfair to the rest of the world, but Tony, honestly, cared more about the people that he loved rather than a bunch of strangers.
Tony held his breath and kept his eyes on her ruby roots. His skin tingled where he felt every gentle brush of her manicured nails. Many of Natasha’s jobs, outside of Avengers work, required immaculate grooming and she was always so careful of how her looks were perceived by others.
Lies, of course. He spent a solid amount of time reconfiguring designs that would be less intrusive, interacting well with Bucky’s nerves. He had even set up a meeting with Dr. Cho at her earliest convenience, in a nicely worded email, to discuss the more biological aspects of the interaction.
Tony finally caught a whiff of something, inhaling deeper to discern what it was. “So, you’re the mystery food person,” he mused, a small smirk tugging at his lips. His heart jumped into his throat and he quickly swallowed it down.
“Thanks, Bruce,” he said softly, stepping forward to take the plate from his hands. His stomach roared, audible to even Bruce’s ears. “I’m starved,” he admitted, setting down at his workbench to eat. He brushed aside various tools to make room for the first solid food he had consumed in some time.
“I’m sorry it had to happen like this, Tony. You didn’t deserve to have that shoved in your face,” Steve said softly to the man, trying to soothe him. His eyebrows were drawn down, obviously concerned and feeling distraught because of the man’s pain. Despite all that they had gone through, Tony had come back around to him in some way, and it was painful to witness his friend’s pain. “Put your suit back on and let’s kick his ass, alright?” he encouraged with the slightest of smiles.
Selfish, that’s what Tony was. It wasn’t that he cared about the Avengers, rather he was selfish and liked to buy their friendship so that he wouldn’t be lonely.
“If you’re not careful, your face will stay that way,” Tony snarked, typing rapidly on his keyboard before moving over to the 4D illumination of the mechanical arm. “Although the tech is good and incredibly functional, there is stuff so much better nowadays, and ways to make sure the wiring won’t be rejected by the white blood cells.” He was speaking mostly to himself, almost too low for the soldier to hear him.
“I’ve seen all the full plates you leave outside the door. You weren’t being sneaky, if that’s what you thought. You weren’t even trying to pretend like you were taking care of yourself,” Bruce admonished, waving his hands around as he spoke.
At one point in his life, he had been certain that it was the constant media coverage, slander, and nosiness. How naïve he had been. He could only wish to return to that state.
Tony nodded, taking a shaky breath, and stepping out into the blinding spotlights. The rapid flashes of bulbs made his vision turn spotty. He squinted and grasped the podium with both hands, veins protruding from the pale skin.
. Or else.” the balding man insisted, almost hissing through his teeth. Everyone knew Tony’s track record.
Only he was getting sicker and sicker, and he could barely keep down water at this point, much less an omelet with such a texture that did not sit well on his empty, turning stomach.
On a break from tweaking his new mobile device, Tony put hours into working on improving his tech for bots that could help the city restore anything destroyed by the Avengers and their various nemeses. While they were failures in assisting the Avengers with on-the-ground tasks, such as protecting civilians, they could easily assist the city in clean-up. Sanitation departments the world over were looking for technology to make impossible jobs more possible, but they would no longer have fully formed AI; they would be completely under the control of humans (Tony
Tony imagined opening the door at just the right moment to be met with the person who cared enough to not wish to see him dead.
“Great, you dummy. Get so sick that you can’t even drag your ass to bed,” she muttered with an air of faux annoyance, but her voice was too soft for her to truly be annoyed.
That lit a fire in Steve’s eyes. “What sort of nonsense are you talking about, Tony? Bucky is my best friend and I’m trying to take care of him when he needs me the most. What aren’t you understanding?”
He tucked his face into her neck, doing his best to pick up his feet, one after the other. The ride up to the penthouse was lengthy while his entire body throbbed, but Pepper didn’t stop threading her fingers through his hair, and Tony couldn’t stop the contented sighs as he took and took and took from her natural body heat.
“Don’t touch me,” he said, gasping as he jerked away from Steve’s hand, stumbling backwards in the process. His eyes were clouded with tears and he hiccupped gently.
It may have been brusque and unnecessary, but Tony brushed his hand off with force behind the action. “Yes, Captain?” he asked, turning to look him dead in the eye. His headache was slowly returning and he wasn’t sure if it was due to the medication wearing off or something else entirely.
He peered intently at the screen in front of him, still squinting—less from the light and more from the pain, now. He felt almost like swaying as if he were about to fall from some great height. The culmination of his illness struck alongside the stress of being in front of these judgmental eyes.
Tony at least had the decency to look mildly ashamed. “You know how things get down here. I lose track of time,” he attempted to explain, waving off the concern.
Tony thought that he could hear it as the secretary’s face turned red with anger. It didn’t seem like it, but he knew a thing or two about backing off when it was necessary to back off; whether or not he chose to accept such knowledge was another story entirely.
“I entrust you with the passcode to my workshop and you go and betray me like this. What does my lab have that yours doesn’t, Bruce?” Tony queried, recognizing the mop of unruly brown hair and the broad shoulders beneath a crisp button-down. “Excluding my shining personality.”
The response surprised Tony, but he took a moment to chew and swallow one of the roasted potatoes before replying. “You know? Have you added psychic abilities to your list of powers?”
After his brief encounter with the pair of lovebirds, Tony had F.R.I.D.A.Y request Bucky’s presence in his lab for the scans. How awfully silent that was, aside from Tony’s coughs and wheezes; he could almost hear the man’s ruffled eyebrows echoing in the quiet, the only sign of human life on his stoic face.
Tony immediately defended himself. “It’s only been, like, five days, Rhodes. I’m okay,” he urged, shaking his head in disbelief. And, in comparison to everyone else, Tony was really okay. “Like you said, you’re the one who’s…” He trailed off, unable to say it for himself.
Bruce turned around quickly, concern clear on his face. “Uh, I just, well.” He took a breath, steeling himself. “You haven’t been out in a while and I was concerned.”
Eyes wide, his mouth gaped like a fish for a second, while his brain caught up with what her words meant. “Do
“Want some moral support?” Natasha asked, popping up at his shoulder without so much as an audible footstep. Tony might have jumped if he was more aware of his surroundings and less aware of the intense brain fog.
He hopped around, doing his best to get into a pair of jeans with his shirt covering his eyes, halfway through putting it on.
, his mind supplied). “Steve, you know where your floor is. Will I need to set up a guest bedroom for your
He was overly distraught, though, and his brain wasn’t functioning properly. He was consumed with the sad fact that his parents were dead and he had been nothing but a shitty son for them. Of course, he liked to blame his father’s abuse for his shitty actions, but only victims used their abuse for an excuse. He was simply a shitty person and a shitty son, and he hadn’t had the decency to tell his mother and father that he loved them before they left to face their death.
When it was finally time to call Steve up and share this information with him, however, Tony felt himself choking on his words as Steve picked up the phone with a swift, “Tony? What’s happened? Are they still planning to arrest Bucky?”
Tony backed up a step too far, tripping over a hunk of machinery and tumbling backwards. He felt a strong, metal hand wrapped around his wrist, gasping in shock, but he quickly grabbed onto it, instinctually saving himself from the fall. He let Bucky pull him back up to his feet, trying his damnedest to compose himself.
His eyes started to sting and water but he decided that it was merely because he was still sick. Down in his workshop, Tony had assumed that he would get a break from dealing with people. Of course, he was wrong.
That wasn’t new. Tony was used to becoming ill, given his poor habits, including but not limited to: drinking, not eating, and not sleeping.
Absentminded, barely registering the thinly veiled threat, Tony nodded, easily peering above the stout man’s head. He could hear the rapid-fire chatter of reporters and cameras flashing insistently, begging for the man of the hour to show his face.
The last thing Tony wanted to do was move away from her touch. Pepper’s hand was so warm on his forehead and it made any words he planned to say catch in his throat.
She shook her head and turned about-faced on her heel. “Just talk to him, Tony. Be a big boy.” All ideas of accompanying him were abandoned.
But she didn’t know how intensely he needed touch. Tony truly hadn’t expected it to come from his ex-girlfriend/acting CEO for his company.
Part of him wished that Steve had, at least once, shown as much care for Tony as he was for Bucky, in this moment. But that was selfish and, despite everyone’s certainty that he was a selfish person, he was trying to do the
The metaphorical imagery sent chills down Tony’s spine and his breath caught in his throat. He craved the feeling of someone- someone who loved him- so close that he might feel their breath on his skin.
“Is that so?” He cocked his head to the side, eyebrows raised in mock surprise. “Well, color me surprised. What could the dear Captain wish to speak with me about? Better accommodations for him and his lover? How about a honeymoon suite? Would that suit the newlyweds?” he said, rapid-fire with his snark.
“Testing, testing,” he boomed into the mic, flashing a typically charming smile. Tony almost felt like himself again, minus all the nerves and racing anxieties and air rushing through his ear canals. The echo of all the speakers throughout the crowded room pounded sharply through his head.
It was his fifth day, cut off from civilization. Down in his workshop, locking himself in and everyone else out, he was free to do as he pleased. This mostly included cranking out new technologies, but occasionally called for bouts of extreme anxiety and depression, culminating in a large panic attack. Each one made him feel closer to death than the last. He wasn’t eating, despite the food he found sitting outside of his door; it never came at exact times, despite how hard he tried to open the doors exactly when he suspected the stranger was dropping off his meal.
Slumping down into his seat, he relaxed heavily, allowing himself time to recover. He stared up at the ceiling as his brain began to slow and his eyes drooped shut.
Stepping calmly into the gym, he glanced around and eyed Rhodey, laying on the floor, on his back, staring up at the ceiling. The man’s eyes darted over to Tony, giving a slight smile.
Although he was trying to be better, fix all his mistakes, he spent more time than he would like to admit on figuring out the scans of Bucky’s mechanical arm. The HYDRA tech had not received any real updates since the second world war, and it was abundantly obvious.
Tony was bristling, but he was more like a lap dog than any ferocious beast. His hackles were raised but he had no bite, and he just wanted someone to stroke his fur flat.
“They’re furious because of you, I might add. Meanwhile, Stark Industries leaps into a tax bracket of its own,” he sassed, with the phone on speaker and a cool rag draped over his forehead. “Give me a time and place and I’ll talk to all the reporters you can throw at me, Ross. You know how great I am with them.”
“What do you think you’re doing? You usually have the decency to at least give me an excuse as to why you’re not at the meetings I tell you about a month in advance. You even missed a social gathering to promote our latest Stark Phone, at which there was plenty of booze to drown your boredom in. I had to get up there and lie to all of our investors about how you were bed-ridden with the flu and do my damnedest to bs my way through a speech about a product that I know nothing about,” Pepper ranted, raining hell upon Tony at top speed the second she stepped
It took a lot to hold back the moan of need for this sort of touch. Instead, he shifted his body into the touch. It was supposed to be a smooth, imperceptible movement, but his aching body was full of betrayal and lethargic, jerky movements.
“Thank you for being here today. The Avengers and the Great State of New York appreciate your cooperation in these trying times,” he began reading, feeling as though the ground beneath his feet was not stable. “I am here to admit our faults. We are at fault for creating such turmoil and disarray in so many ways. We recognize that and take full responsibility. We will, from here on out…” Tony squinted and cleared his throat;
Tony tiredly rubbed his eyelids into his eyes, watching the colors burst. He sat up straight in his chair, calling up plans for the next version of his Stark Phone, and beginning to tweak it so that it’s more like the newer version of the iPhone except a million times more awesome. The fat, rich honchos in that fund Stark Industries who are always breathing down Pepper’s neck, thus forcing her to breathe down Tony’s neck.
Tony suddenly clattered to the floor, his legs failing beneath him, losing his grip, and blacking out entirely. He barely registered the gasps and the rapid flashes of photographs, immortalizing his downfall forever, nor the strong feminine hands pulling at his shoulders.
Foolishly, Tony thought his glasses may have worked, that he had dealt with his parents’ death, but he hadn’t. He was still emotionally wrecked and damaged and an idiot. He was a fool for being so hung-up on something that had happened so long ago. But he was sixteen when they left him; he was too young to be ready to say goodbye. Never mind how awful his father had been to him; his mother had been the light at the end of the endless, pitch black tunnel. When he cried to her on their weekly phone calls, because the people at MIT were endlessly bullying him, she had always been there for him. She drove out once a month to take him out to eat at his favorite restaurant; she was there for every award he received, every science show he entered, every project that was presented in front of thousands of his fellow classmates.
Tony left the gym with a different sort of anxiety, one that swished around in his stomach and made him feel the urge to empty it. In fact, shockingly enough, the urge became too strong and he rushed to empty his stomach of pure acid in the nearest wastebasket within his lab. Clutching at his abdomen, he heaved a couple of heavy breaths, confused. He hadn’t vomited while completely sober in so long that he couldn’t remember.
Tony swallowed each groan that threatened to fall out of his mouth, eyes squeezing shut. “You may have inadvertently told the truth,” he said quietly, voice gruff, in the lull of her rant. He could almost sense it when Pepper softened up.
Snorting, he jerkily turned back to his food and ate less enthusiastically than before. Tony slowed and stopped altogether once the door shut behind Bruce. The silence was overwhelming and he felt his illness creeping up on him again. Or maybe it was just the stress; stress from pushing people away and being pushed away.
I know this is five years from my last chapter, and most people will probably be uninterested in this now, but I've revitalized my inspiration for this story. I hope some people may find this new chapter interesting enough to read and watch out for the next. Also, I should add slow-burn to the tags, for sure.
Pepper sidled up to his chair, gently placing a hand on his forehead, feeling for a temperature in a way that painfully reminded him of his mother. The other hand rested on his shoulder, stroking gently along his upper arm.
“Sure, but you’ve got to get your own Uber.” He gave a bare semblance of his old smirk, eying the redhead, and keeping a steady pass past the main living room. Surprisingly, it was a mess, and Tony squinted at the errant shirt and board game pieces that littered the coffee table. “Was there a children’s party here?”
Steve looked appropriately shamed, at the very least. “I didn’t just text you to look after Bucky. I wanted to talk to you,” he said, caressing the hand that had been brushed off Tony’s shoulder as if it burned.
The meals being dropped off had a brief drop in consistency as Pepper ran around, attempting to market the new Stark Phone and meeting potential clients. Though he ignored most of them, he attempted to eat half of the egg and spinach omelet left outside the morning of Ross’ conference. The media was already reporting on it, speculating what the superhero could possibly have to say after the mess he made.
The conference Ross wanted him at was two days from now. He could only hope that he felt more like a human being on that day. Tony had to do well, for he had only a small inkling of the power the man could yield over him.
Fully dressed, Tony left his penthouse for the first time since Pepper took him there. The elevator took him down to Steve’s room, assuming that it was where he would find the super soldier, and he wasn’t exactly wrong.
Instead, he took a moment to assess his body. Everything ached and he still felt like shit despite the fantastic sleep. Because of that, he comes to a new conclusion; he wasn’t merely exhausted, he was sick and shaking from the familiar chill of a fever.
Pepper persistently texted throughout each day leading up to his conference, live in front of countless reporters, and streamed to every television in the world.
“You’re a pricey puppet and one that really isn’t worth my time.” Ross gave the details of the interview time and place, sounding significantly less stressed.
“C’mon, I’ll bring you some Tylenol. Up we go,” she insisted, pulling out his chair from beneath the desk and dragging his lifeless arm up and around her shoulders. There was a surprising amount of strength in the way she maneuvered his body.
“The arm’s malfunctioning. Circuitry hasn’t received proper evaluation in weeks now. You’re no longer receiving treatment so your body is probably rejecting the foreign substance they’ve wired into your nerves and your bones. I can only imagine how painful it is,” he stated methodically, cutting Steve off. He rubbed at his eyes and heaved a sigh.
At the conference, Ross did not bother to meet him; rather, he sent his secretary to deliver the typical spiel of following the teleprompter exactly: “To a
vigilantes. We can’t just go AWOL.” Politico jargon: a taste of what Ross had planned for him on live TV.
It didn’t take a word more before Tony was up and jabbing at the gym floor’s number in the elevator. His stomach twisted, sickened with guilt, as he waited for the doors to slide open. The anticipation made his heart quicken, but a glance in the elevator’s mirror told him that he looked as impassive as ever; which was good, because he certainly didn’t want Rhodey to freak out on him if he looked overtly concerned.
Tony awoke slowly, confusion addling his mind. Blinking up at the ceiling, he groaned as he lifted his head, neck stiff from the awkward angle.
“Listen here, Stark. If I’m going to be kissing your feet and answering to your every beck and call, you’re going to do a thing or two for me. I’m going to write your teleprompter and you’re going to read off every single word, in order, or I swear I’ll make your life hell,” Ross threatened.
There was no sort of denial in his words and Tony could only take it as a confirmation. “What do you want from me, then? I’m going to help you help him. Do you just want to see what you can drain from me? Perhaps, if you twist me hard enough, you’ll wring out a couple more apologies for shit that I’ve already apologized endlessly for?”
“Tony?” Steve finally said, wariness in his voice, because obviously Steve thought he knew the billionaire as well. The emotionless, volatile, billionaire whore. The man that cared for no one except for himself.
Natasha squinted at him and shoved a finger into his shoulder. “Don’t do this to him. Everyone knows you guys have been through hell but you’re out the other side now. Get through this purgatory
to him? Steve did this!” he demanded, although the words fell flat, for even he did not quite believe them. This was all Tony’s fault, and Natasha’s words were all the confirmation he needed, but he still wanted to push off all that blame weighing on his conscience. “We are
Tony refrained from vocally reprimanding himself for the creepy thought but he couldn’t help it. He was starved for physical touch and the reminder that someone cared for him.
?” he asked, clear sarcasm in his voice- questioning if his pal would be staying in Steve’s room or not.
The elevator slid open behind him and Tony hurriedly turned around. “Workshop, FRIDAY,” he ordered abruptly. The doors slid shut immediately, a perk of having artificial intelligence operating his entire tower.
Tony knew what everyone expected him to do. They expected him to turn on his best friend and his best friend’s actual best friend, Captain America and the Winter Soldier, after he had finally decided that, yes, he was in the wrong. He was supposed to pummel them into dust and leave them to rot, and he noticed how Steve raised his shield and Bucky raised his gun.
Closing his eyes tight, he tapped his fingers on the interface on his wrist and his body was slowly encompassed by his suit of armor. The tears were done for now but he could feel how they were just barely being held at bay. “Let’s go kick some ass, Cap,” he agreed, putting on his bravest voice possible.
Tony’s jaw clenched, keeping his eyes on the hologram in front of him, turning it and zooming in on specific points of interest. “Secrets don’t make good beds to lie on.” He knew that from personal experience.
“The driver is pulling around now,” she informed him. He nodded and carefully pressed into his desk, putting his entire weight on the palms of his hands, to get his body upright. His arms trembled. She had already called the elevator for him, and he took it to the main floor.
“Shush, you know I’ll take care of you,” Steve says and right yeah, he’s not much of a selfish lover.
“Kinda why I never said anything about my thing for it. Didn’t want to take it too far,” he murmurs.
He picks up his pace a little, arms tightening around Steve’s neck. “Dunno. Just something about the way you look at me,” he says, “gets me going every time. Love the way you look at me like I’m the only thing in the world that matters.”
would you choose Bucky?” he mumbles. Steve has other friends, Tony knows this because he’s seen them so why
Tony’s perched in a window seat looking out over Brooklyn when Rhodey video calls and Tony assumes its because he wants visual proof that Tony’s not dead. He grins, answering the call. “What’s up, honeybee?” he asks.
“What? With male genital structure we should be the ones wearing skirts. Pants are fucking awful, I hate them. The Scots were right when they stuck men in kilts,” he says. “Actually, no, clothing is awful and we should all be nudists except in the winter and only because we’d die of exposure,” he amends.
Steve laughs, “I liked it before I saw you in it. Turns out my imagination isn’t near as good as the real thing,” he says. Yeah, Tony figures that’s true. That’s why he chose to go make his drawings a reality to begin with.
He feels a hand slide over his back and he shivers, leaning into it a little before an arm hooks around his waist and pulls him away from Bucky’s neck. “Rude,” Bucky tells Steve but Steve only rolls his eyes at him fondly.
“Good. That was probably the best orgasm of my life,” Tony tells him. “Happy to hear it was a joy to witness.” Bucky snorts, shaking his head at Tony but he says nothing.
“Go shower, you look like a bad video game character,” Tony tells Bucky. He snorts and walks off, giving Tony a fond look over his shoulder. Once he hears the shower running he turns to Steve, who still hasn’t released the tension in his body. “Okay, what’s the god damn deal?” he asks.
“Oh I know that’s probably not true,” he says and Tony gasps when Bucky presses two fingers in him. “But I’ll take your appreciation here.”
He moves a little faster, picking up the pace slowly just for the satisfaction of feeling both Steve and Bucky get antsy. “
Steve steps in close, running the tips of his fingers along the waistline of Tony’s jeans. “Okay, this isn’t going in the wrong direction but its not going in the right direction either,” Tony says. “So free me and kiss. Or more, preferably more. Please,” he adds, trying to appeal to their nicer nature. It doesn’t seem to do more than amuse Steve and Tony can’t see Bucky’s face but those two probably share a brain so Tony assumes he’s also amused. Which,
Steve sighs though; pulling away some more so there must be some type of validity to Bucky’s statement. He leans in and gives Tony one last quick kiss before he turns to Bucky. “If he’s late again I’m going to shot him.”
Bucky doesn’t know what to make of Tony’s aggressively forcing Steve to like… deal with their relationship. He also doesn’t know what to do with the face that Steve’s like… okay with it, at least on some level. He’s not happy with the whole thing but he’s not exactly shy about telling people to stuff it either. Just because he’s head over heels in love with Tony doesn’t mean he’d be an exception. He’s got no problem telling Bucky to stuff it, even if its usually with looks these days.
you are wet.” He knows that, has been trying to hold back since he stuck the damn stockings on but when Steve flipped them over yeah,
Steve cocks his head to the side, smiling a little. “I don’t know about that. I’ve reconsidered, might be a little hot,” he says and Tony grins. Well, noted then. Not that he took Steve as the ‘mark my territory’ type, that’s absolutely more Bucky’s thing than his.
“Fine then, if it gives you a little motivation he is the last one I fucked,” he says, getting the satisfaction of the look on Steve’s face. “And its been a couple days,” he adds with a pout. When Steve leans in Tony happily wraps his arms around his neck, giving him a sloppy kiss thanks to his somewhat awkward positioning. Steve doesn’t mind at all as he slides his hands from Tony’s thighs to under his ass, lifting him out of the chair with a surprising amount of ease. Tony clings to Steve as he lifts, not fond of the idea of falling and quite fond of the idea of hanging on to Steve for dear life.
“But you conveniently leave out drinking so many shots with Weasel that you threw up on Wade. Of course,” he mumbles.
“I’m not looking to listen to whatever bullshit some jock thinks is good so yeah,” Tony says, standing. “You gunna come with me?” he asks innocently enough but Steve gets his drift anyway.
Yeah, Tony knows. “Didn’t take you for the territorial type.” Mostly because he seems to you know, have some common sense. But he can deal with a little territorial if Steve keeps the rest of his traits. Might even be a little flattering.
Bucky still looks confused but to be fair it’s the first time he’s been turned down since he was fifteen and it was by Steve, not the guy he was about to ask out. “Well, Steve’s available,” he offers and Steve feels his entire face wrinkle.
“Pull it,” Bucky tells him and that alone as Tony arching his back into him let alone the way Bucky sucks at a patch of skin on his neck, nipping at the spot afterwards.
“No, I haven’t and you’re going to leave him alone Bucky Jesus,” Steve mumbles, letting him in. He knows immediately that Bucky isn’t going to listen and that’s his problem because Tony’s not likely to say yes.
Steve rolls his eyes fondly, “give me a damn minute,” he tells Tony, looking around at the damn boxes and oh come
. You know, Howard Stark’s prodigal son? Weapons developer?” the person continues when DipFuck doesn’t seem to get the point.
,” he repeats, pulling Tony’s hand away from his ass. He lets out an annoyed moan and Steve laughs. “Don’t give me attitude,” he tells him. “I know what you need anyway hmm?”
“Always,” he tells Tony, standing up and grabbing his hand. Tony’s pretty sure Rumlow mumbles ‘gross’ behind them so he flips him off for good measure.
a heart attack as he jumps out after him screaming about him being an idiot white boy despite the fact that only one of them is deathly afraid of heights and its not Tony. Which makes Rhodey’s interest in aviation confusing but he insists planes don’t count. Even
This is probably the most selfish Steve has ever been in bed not that Tony minds much. This was for him, after all. “I take it you like my new look,” he asks as he walks over. He takes his time walking over to the bed.
stupid. Bucky happens to spare him a glance and he huffs out a laugh. “Don’t look so offended, he’s probably not serious. No need for you to worry about it,” Bucky tells him, giving him a soft grin.
“Actions, hmm?” Steve asks. Tony nods and Steve grins before looking back down at him, if only momentarily, and lifting his skirt a little. Tony lifts his hips to help him out and Steve lets out a small noise of appreciation. “Guess I can do action,” he murmurs before leaning into Tony’s space and licking at the head of his cock. Tony gasps a little as Steve takes him in, working his way down at a torturously slow pace.
He drops a hand to Steve’s on his waist, twining his fingers with Steve’s. Steve squeezes them a little, a small moment of intimacy that Tony appreciates as he presses back into Steve and Bucky’s hands. “
Tony though, he remains forcefully ignorant to Steve’s attitude as he reaches out to Bucky despite being perched in Steve’s lap and he really shouldn’t push it with Steve at this point, he
“Then do it,” Tony tells him. “Want you to.” Steve still pauses, considering this for a moment and Tony pouts at him, prodding his hand back to his ass. “Want you,” he tells Steve. That seems to be the encouragement Steve needs to go ahead with what he wants and Tony gasps as he presses two fingers into him at once.
“Yeah,” Tony says, his voice nearing a whine and he sounds fucking ridiculous because nothing’s even happened yet aside from some minor petting but he’s still got that image of Steve and Bucky in his head and it seems to be doing a lot of the work for them. Not hard, Tony figures, when its something that’s been running around in his imagination since he met them.
,” Bucky tells him, teeth grazing the side of his neck. “And you’re always giving me all these looks, almost feels purposeful. Like you’re teasing me,” he murmurs.
Tony nods, “yeah m’sure, do it,” Tony tells him again. Steve moans, face buried in Tony’s neck. Tony curls his arms around Steve’s body tightly, head tilted so his mouth is right by Steve’s ear. “Please, baby,” he murmurs and Steve moans again, nipping at Tony’s neck, teeth grazing his skin all the way down it until he hits the base. He hesitates for only a moment before he bites down and Tony swears for a moment he sees white. “Oh,
“Thought so. Now go over to Bucky, he looks upset over there,” he murmurs, grinning at Bucky, who does look annoyed.
He crawls backwards onto the bed, watching Bucky walk closer, eyes roaming neatly over his body. “Like something you see?” he asks cockily.
