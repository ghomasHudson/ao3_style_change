wasn’t really a necessity, but she wanted a great experience to put on her curriculum.
“This is a powerful voice you have here…” noted someone behind her.
“Excuse me, but I think your coworker is in trouble because of the moron right behind me,” she whispered, “do you happen to know where I could find her? I’ll advise her to not came back here again for tonight.”
“I am not. And please, don’t call me “Cas”, my name is Castiel.”
“I’m telling you, we should keep those, people like these books! Why would you want to get rid of what people like to read Castiel! We’re a bookshop! We’re sailing books, in case you had forgotten.”
And this is how Dean formally met Castiel. One night, in a shabby apartment, not that different from her own, after climbing her balcony like frigging Romeo.
“Rowena, this is Cas, haven’t decided yet if she is a douchebag or not, but recently she’s been alright!”
Dean didn’t think she deserved it either… But shit, she almost threw the woman down the stairs and if the boots could prevent her to file a formal complaint… well she would give it to her.
A tiny voice in the back of her head had whispered
They had talked and Dean had discovered some odd personality traits in Castiel. She often asked Dean to repeat herself, seemingly to be sure she understood correctly what she was saying. She sometimes had difficulties to meet her eyes and when she was looking directly at her, she was focusing very hard on her face as if to read her whole facial’s expression. At first Dean thought it was unsettling, but she soon forgot about it.
From the corner of the hallway, Castiel saw different employees walking in-between guests and offering drinks or appetizers. They had change during the showing and now wore black dresses or slacks.
Again, a rosy taint crept its way up the woman’s nose and made Dean smug.
“Oh, did I woke you up? I’m not sorry.”
One thing leading to another, Castiel had bought fifty percent of the bookshop but Chuck and her had a deal. In six years or so, she would buy the other fifty percents if the shop was doing well. Chuck wanted an out, he needed time for writing and he was dreaming of doing enough money with his books rather than with the shop. As for Castiel, she was satisfied to start something new and more than happy to work here, where nobody could find her.
“Oh, that’s me. I’m the owner.” Dean didn’t know if she made it up, but she thought she saw a glimpse of pride crossed the blue-eyed woman in front of her. And now she was staring, unblinking. It was rather disturbing.
“That is why I came here for in the first place…” The woman alternated from staring blankly at Dean to avert her eyes.
Without hesitation, she opened the door and climbed the stairs silently. It was darker here, and colder than in the main hall. There was no carpeting, no wooden floor, no antique chandelier. And the moment she reached the last stairs, she heard a loud crash coming from the ajar door.
“Bathroom” lied Castiel before taking her coat and leaving quietly.
The boots looked strange on the woman. It was a peculiar look: black skirt, black shirt, very classy, like all the guests tonight. It was odd and disharmonious, to have the protuberant boots poking out at the end of her legs. But at least, the woman could walk without falling again and maybe Dean could go to the bookshop in a few days to have them back.
A week had passed since the movie theater incident, and the woman, Dean, had not come to Castiel’s bookshop to ask for her boots yet. The boots were sitting behind the desk, on a stool, waiting patiently for their owner to come back.
. Even the love he once felt for his so-called father is pale and numb beside the one he grew during his life alongside Dean Winchester. The one that took root in hell and went far beyond. The one that rose joy, despair and hope in him. The one he can reveal freely and proud today.
When Gabriel turned to face the voice behind him Dean abruptly understood why it was familiar. Here, in a beige dress stood Castiel, her hair loose and disheveled because of the wind outside, lipstick red and a frown on her face.
“It’s strange, isn’t it? That your brother and mine know each other. I really wasn’t expecting to meet you here.” Dean engaged the conversation sometimes later.
. He hanged the Godzilla one just above his bed. Actually, the only apartment’s decorating seemed to consist in movie posters… Every few weeks, Dean would come back with a new one and Sam would sigh heavily, wondering
“Are you sure you’re working here?” Castiel asked “From your attitude I really doubt it… And from your outfit… Well, let’s say you would not stand out on a construction site. Maybe I should call for the owner, or ask you for quotation, my sink has a leak.”
“Hello there!” he greeted cheerfully, and Dean regained control over her brain, well partially at least.
When he first decided to move in Paris, he knew his life would change. New city, new job for paying his rent, new apartment and most of all : college.
’s owner answered “Be unsure that our projectionist is well qualified and perfectly capable of running your movie. From what I understand you’re the… movie director right? I don’t recall La Fémis ever taught me disdain and self-sufficient when I walk their classrooms all these years ago. I’ll ask you to trust the professionals working here.” This rented the student speechless, but Castiel saw his cheeks flushing red with shame and anger.
was on film rolls, which meant she would have to change the rolls every thirty minutes. She kinda liked it because she would be able to see most of the movie.
“I did.”
Sure, Dean wasn’t your model movie theater employee. She wasn’t well educated like Tessa or Tristan. She wasn’t trying to enter the film industry nor trying to get to La Fémis! Hell! She hasn’t a full notebook of relations like Garth!
The embarrassment visible on the woman’s face was quickly replaced by fury in her green eyes.
“Oh, so you want to go down now…” she said with a smile in her voice.
Castiel halted to say something but she couldn’t, her eyes round and her mouth gaped.
“Yes, but you don’t care.”
The employee at the door, dark haired and blue eyed, was smiling and leading the guests through the hall. Castiel went for the register and she gave her the invite, all the while looking for his brother in the tiny crowd.
“Yeah, and I’m glad I’m not in charge of that.” Declared Dean with finality as she threw her paper bag in a trashcan. “Anyway, I have to go, gonna be late.”
“Stop being so pedantic! Why do you hate people literature?”
“Traitor!” mouthed Dean as she leaved.
when she put on the projector. Plus, she could enjoy free movies (and if she could rarely see one until the end, she didn’t complain).
“Yeah, well drama is all about empathy, right?”
And here they were now. Two years later, still in the crappy and old apartment Dean first found before they moved. The place was like a sanctuary for Sam. He had his own room, filled with books and some movie posters Dean brought back from
“You can put the flyers here.” She said, pointing the checkout “I’d be sure to give one to the customers.”
“Probably you!” Castiel retorted. “Luckily, there will be no lasting damage, for champagne can be cleansed easily. I’m surprised you ignore that, have you ever heard of laundry?”
“Don’t be like that, we could try. Besides, I didn’t pay for it, the old man just gave it to me.”
“Well, maybe I don’t really deserve to be thanked.” Castiel admitted and both of them felt silent again. Only the passing cars disturbing the weird atmosphere of the evening.
) and she would be walking the service entrance and greeting her coworkers.
a chick. Gaby was a man, not that tall and with a malicious smile adorning his face. Dean was so unsettled she didn’t notice the person behind Gaby, still focused on his face that looked familiar to her but that she couldn’t quite place.
“My apologies, I tripped over my own feet, I can be so clumsy sometimes…” Her voice might have seemed candid but her eyes, sharp and fierce, couldn’t lie.
was kneeling down, reaching the bottom shelf. Dean saw her back first. Black jumpsuit, open-back. Dark hair falling on her neck. A glimpse of a tattoo coiling around her vertebrae and disappearing in her lower back. She was rummaging through DVD.
She apparently regained the use of her legs for she tried to stand by herself, but an audible
When Dean had left, Castiel had looked at her with an intent she wasn’t used to but had said nothing. Unnerved by the attention Dean had cracked a joke, or had tried to…
“I wanted to apologize.” Suddenly blurted the woman, and Dean was speechless anyway, so she didn’t answer that.
“Don’t be silly, you know I might be older than this old
Truth be told, she rarely sat in the dark room among audience member. How could she, when she was the one running the projection perched on her personal projectionist room?
or try to offer her a cup of coffee (she was at her fourth one and she was overexcited) that she politely declined.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m looking forward to it. Goodbye Gabriel.”
The projection room was safe. No one came here. Ever. Except for Garth from time to time, or Tessa when she would bring Dean some snacks. Oh, and Mirza of course. Mirza had her own very worn and very comfy cushion.
It’s everything Castiel thought he would never have. It’s everything his mind was too humble to wish for.
So, public transportation she could deal with, she didn’t have a choice. Rude customers that questioned her carefully chosen decision in her (fifty precents) bookstore? She had a hard time remaining composed.
There was something almost sacred, she explained to Castiel, when she was disassembling and reassembling things. She liked to find the defect and try to fix it. It was her hobby when she lived in Toulouse.
“I’m really not but … yes, thank you for the boots, I’ll go.” She was leaving for good, but just before she went downstair the woman abruptly turned and watch her intently, still frowning, blue eyes searching.

Castiel blinks fog away from his eyes, a veil that lifts up from his consciousness. When he looks around, the play reveals itself. He is the main character, and there is a prince with a crown of blood that stands beside him on the darkened stage in a leather jacket, plaid, and jeans, who grips his hand tightly like a lifeline.

What else can a guy do when he’s saved the world twice over and has to do it another time, probably? This fucking angel got rid of the Mark for him, did everything for him, and now Dean can’t even do anything as he loses the thing that makes him an angel. What can he do when he can see how the small amount of Grace that’s slipping away from Cas kills him slowly? When he knows Cas is going to die?

On the other side of the door, Cas lets Dean's words sink in. A genuine apology. Cas isn't used to recieving those. Truth be told, Dean didn't even do anything that required much of an apology, Cas reflects; he really isn't so much angry as he is embarrassed, his anger jumping in as a defense mechanism, pushing Dean away before Dean could reject him for "being creepy," or a "stalker," or whatever else he assumed Dean would think. Slowly, Cas drags himself from the bed.
“Yeah, um, I don’t got much time, but I-“
"Nah, I'm good, thanks." Dean tries to shrug, but his voice is shaky.
“Dean!” Sam exclaimed, sounding relieved as Dean slumped into the passenger’s seat.
“Aww, Sammy, I think you actually made him
“How much do I owe you?” Dean asks, reaching into his jacket for the cash he’d stowed there.
in his belly, and by the tears that are pricking at his own eyes.
“There’s more to life than fast cars and rock n’ roll, Dean” Sam lectures, rolling his eyes at his brother, “at least Cas knows what I’m talking about.” The smile Sam flashes him fills Castiel with an incredible warmth. If he were honest with himself, he’d admit that Sam has actually been easier on him than Dean has more often than not, but Sam’s acceptance now means the world to him.
When María returns a few hours later to clean the blood from Castiel’s carpet, she brings him dinner, and some relief in the form of a bottle of Vicodin.
“Yes, quite well actually,” Cas replies, obliviously.
“Okay, I will,” Dean promises.
“Oh, fuck, yes,” Castiel moans, letting his head fall back against the pillow. Dean rolls his hips in a slow, steady rhythm, dragging gasps and moans out of Cas with each movement.
-Led Zeppelin
“Dean,” Anael offers, “and it’s good to see you too, uncle Zach,” she adds sarcastically. The man’s face looks livid as he stares as Dean.
“Well I’ll be darned!” she exclaims,
instead of next week like they’d said.” Cas sounds panicked, frantic.
Suddenly a wave rushes in, more forcefully than those previous, rushing up around their knees. Cas startles violently at the unexpected cold, nearly losing his balance, but Dean catches him, laughing.
"Touché. But I'm not lying this time."
“Sure!” Sam says enthusiastically.
“Maybe. I’ll ask.”
“Any time.”
“I’ll live,” Cas shrugs. “Heading to breakfast?”
"No," he answers, "go ahead, if you want it," he offers even though Sam really wasn't asking.
“What’re we doing?” Sam mumbles sleepily.
He doesn’t want to wake Cas yet while he’s finally sleeping so deeply, so Dean lays back, putting Zeppelin on shuffle. As
“No,” John says coldly, “go.” And Dean realizes he is being thrown out for good.
Castiel breathes as Dean wraps his arms tightly around Cas’s upper body, kissing down the side of his neck.
Dean thinks to himself, and the thought has him about to finish quicker than Cas had. He twists his fingers in Castiel’s hair and feels him moan around his cock, and he realizes Cas is already hard again; Cas is already hard again, and jerking himself off as he sucks Dean’s dick.
"Sorry," Cas rushes, "It's… it's hard to describe."
“Well, I would just
“Well, you two behave yourselves,” Dean says.
"Yeah, that would suck," he finally agrees.
"I'm not lying," Dean whimpered, and his father lunged forward, pulling him to his feet by the front of his shirt.
Dean kneels, again straddling Cas’s thighs, palming his own hard length through his underwear so Cas can see just how hard he’s made him.
“Whatever,” Sam concedes.
"I'm really sorry, Dean; I know you two were close." The words hang in the air unacknowledged. The brothers sit in silence for a while. Sam finds himself wishing Cas would wake up if only for Dean's sake. He's afraid to see how many pieces Dean will fall into if the angel doesn't return.
“Huh,” Dean says, “I guess that makes sense.”
Dean ultimately stands and stretches, yawning and checking his pockets for his wallet and keys, a little lump forms in Castiel's throat. It's late, and Dean needs to sleep. He wishes Cas a good night and promises to see him for lunch the next day, but when Dean's hand is on the doorknob, Castiel is surprised to hear his own voice.
He waits maybe ten minutes. He just can't get that drawing out of his head. Cas had gotten
Eventually a nurse he hasn't seen before opens the door, a security guard at her side. She looks nervous.
“Okay, Dean,” Cas says softly. “I’m sorry; I guess I just worried that I might disappoint you, that my body might not satisfy you.” The words hit Dean painfully in the chest as he looks into Castiel’s brutally sincere eyes.
"Yeah? You know what else is unpleasant? Pneumonia." Cas doesn't respond.
His reverie is halted abruptly when a shadow moves in the mirror behind his reflection. His stomach turns to ice as his pulse beats frantically in his ears. He whips around, terrified, but there is nothing there. From the corner of his eye, he perceives motion in the hallway. Hurling his toothbrush into the sink, Dean races to his bedroom door, where he freezes in terror. Yellow Eyes turns menacingly toward him from where he stands, inches from Cas, a hand trailing fingers lazily through Castiel’s hair.
“Dean,” Cas begins softly after a moment, “is there anything I can do to help?” Dean looks up at him, sniffing and wiping his nose with the back of his hand.
"How do you know?" Zachariah demands, "were you asking him? Why would you even broach the subject if you were truly committed to cleansing yourself of the evil desires you have chosen to harbor?"
“Fucking hell, Cas,” Dean utters, and Cas picks up his pace, digging his fingers into Dean’s thighs with one hand, and working Dean’s cock with the other. “Oh Cas,” Dean gasps, his voice nearly an embarrassing whine, “fuck Cas, gonna come…” Cas is ready, his eyes traveling to Dean’s face, wanting to burn this image into his memory forever: Dean’s flushed face, eyes squeezed shut, lips parted as he pants and grits his teeth, the moment before he’s coming down Castiel’s throat, crying out “goddamn, baby, you’re so good!” Castiel grins, the taste of Dean lingering on his tongue. He runs his hands up over Dean’s stomach, feeling Dean’s body quiver beneath his fingertips. Slowly, he crawls up onto Dean’s lap, his knees sliding to either side of Dean’s hips. Dean wraps his arms around Cas’s waist, pressing kisses to his chest, before capturing his lips once more. Dean can taste himself on Castiel’s tongue, something he never really liked in the past, but now, with Cas, he finds it erotic as hell. Cas rolls his hips, grinding his aching cock against Dean’s abdomen. Quickly, Dean grips it with his good hand, squeezing and massaging gently with his thumb. Cas moans sweetly into Dean’s mouth, thrusting into his fist.
“Cas,” Dean asks more seriously, running his fingers over Castiel’s cheek, “where’s this comin’ from? You were great. More than great. Sorry if I did something to make you doubt that. I mean, it was good for you too, right?”
"I think I should stay here.''
“Yes, yes, Dean,” Cas pants. The pain has eased, and now he is just trying to wrap his head around the fact that
“Really?” Cas asks, voice quavering. “You want to be in a relationship with me?” Dean nods, biting his lip nervously. “You will touch me without running away afterward?” Dean smiles a little.
“Sounds good,” Dean responds, glad that he isn’t letting Sam down.
“It’s not what it sounds like,” Dean explains, thoroughly embarrassed, “I’m not really his brother. Sorry. Force of habit. Not used to telling the truth where we come from.”
“Meet me in the supply closet in 5 minutes?” she says, running her foot up his leg under the table.
“That would be great!” Dean exclaims, “and I promise.”
“Go ahead and fucking kill me,” Dean gasps as he struggles to breathe, “just be sure to kill yourself after, so Sammy can go live somewhere decent.” For a moment he’s sure this is the end, sure that John is gonna squeeze until his throat collapses in and he suffocates, and really, he thinks, would that be so bad? But he thinks again about Sammy, thinks about how this would destroy him, and he can’t let it happen. He kicks out blindly, and his boot makes hard contact with John’s stomach, causing him to stumble for a moment. Dean falls to his hands and knees, gulping for air before John is on him again.
know?” Dean says, giving Sam the middle finger, “last time I checked,
“Fair enough,” Dean concedes, and the rest of the night follows without incident.
“So, uh, how do angels reproduce?” Dean asks, moving on.
“I understand,” Cas says, “believe me.”
“Ready?” Pam asks, and Cas nods again, taking a shaky breath. When she begins, Cas fights valiantly to hold still, biting his lip and squeezing Dean’s hand tightly.
“Yeah,” Cas sniffs, “more than okay... shit, sorry... I’m such a fuckin’ wreck. God, this is embarrassing.”
“Cas, some of these marks look pretty red, like they could be getting infected,” Dean says, concerned.
“So, this is romance…” Cas says with a grin, only half joking. Dean’s face reddens, but he squeezes Cas’s hand a little more tightly.
in this arena, Castiel thinks, and he’s probably had much better than Cas could ever be. Just as these doubts are running through his head, however, Dean makes a sudden move, pushing Castiel over, onto his back, Dean rolling on top of him, pressing their lips together purposefully, tasting him. Cas tastes like mouthwash and whiskey and something that is uniquely
They climb into the Impala, and Sam starts the engine before looking over at Dean.
To be continued....
The way Cas just took what he had to say and contemplated it: Cas hadn't snapped to judgement or looked at him like he was stupid or insane. Maybe that is why Dean had offered up his palm in some strange gesture he didn't quite understand himself, but it felt good, Castiel's gentle fingertips sweeping lightly over his skin. Castiel's hand in his, physical evidence that he's not alone. It's all too much for him to make sense of now.
On a more personal note: if you struggle with anxiety/depression/panic attacks, etc. please seek help if you haven’t already! I can say from personal experience that it is worth it. I’ve seen counselors in the past and have been on antidepressants for years now, and it has truly changed my life. Clinical depression is a physical issue as well as mental, it can run in families (like mine! Yay!), and often requires medical treatment alongside counseling. It’s a bitch. A lifelong bitch, but with help, it gets better! I’m well, and I’m happy now 😊❤️
“Shit.” Dean can hear Bobby let out a long, deep breath. “Dean, if you were havin’ some sort of trouble, some kinda problems at home or whatever, I wish you’d told me.” This is not how Dean had expected this conversation to go at all.
"Aww, fuck yeah," Dean groans out in pleasure. "What a way to wake up!" Cas glances up and catches Dean's wolfish grin. "Come'ere, baby," Dean murmurs, pulling Cas up to kiss him deeply.
“Cas,” Dean answers, his voice pained, “there is nothing about you that makes me regret being with you. And you’re right, I was turned on last night. And yeah, you’re a dude, and that complicates shit ‘cause I’ve never, I haven’t been turned on by a guy before, but you’re great, Cas, and I’m… I just don’t know.” Dean reaches out, taking Cas’s hand. “Listen. I really care about you, Cas. But I’m… I’m only human. One fucked up, piece of shit human who can’t get his mind straight enough to think clearly. I don’t want to hurt you, Cas. I hate that I hurt you.” Castiel stares at him with watery eyes, tears continuing to leak slowly down his face.
"I'm sorry," Castiel murmurs, and hates himself for saying it. He is
“Yeah, I’ll do that,” Dean lies. He’s pretty sure he won’t be hearing from him any time soon, though even if he did, he wants all communication about Sam to be between Sam and himself.
“Hmm, this is very good,” Cas interjects, “I think I understand the ubiquity of coffee in the world.”
“Sure,” she smiles empathetically, “come with me.” He follows her to the nurses’ station, where she dials the number for him and hands him the corded phone. He has to stand at the counter to talk on the phone, but he is grateful he’s allowed to call at all. The call goes to Sam’s voicemail. Dean figured it would, but he hopes Sam will get the message next time he charges the emergency phone. Sam has always been pretty good about keeping it charged.
“That’s you,” Dean says quietly, “I’ll be right here,” he adds. Suddenly there is panic in Castiel’s eyes.
spill his guts like that to anyone, and he
Cas wants to smack his uncle's hand away, crawl backwards over his bed to put some distance between them, but instead, he simply replies, "it was fine."
“I don’t know about that, Cas, but I’m glad I gotta be there with you.” This time, Dean grasps Cas’s hand from across the table, raising the glass of Scotch to his lips as he squeezes gently.
“Yeah, I’d appreciate that,” Sam agrees.
John just stares for a minute, his brain unable to string a sentence together as his oldest son refuses to look him in the eye. Dean seizes the nearest shirt he can find (it happens to be Cas’s) and yanks it roughly over his head. Then he spots the rest of Castiel’s clothing and tosses it to Cas, who has frozen once more, hiding his lower half beneath a blanket, unadulterated terror in his eyes.
OMG I'm back, I'm back! Apologies all around! But, hey, this is a long chapter, and I've got another long one that is nearly ready to post.
“Well, thanks, Cas,” Dean says quietly.
“When he brought out the needle, I went out cold, okay? Are you happy?” Dean spits.
Castiel continues to gaze up at him with an awestruck look on his face as Dean pauses, reaching for the shampoo. Then Dean’s fingers are in his hair, gently massaging his scalp, sending tingles through his entire body.
“What do you mean?”
“Can I sleep out here? Just for tonight?” Sam asks desperately.
“Good. Dude raised you from hell, least you could do is
“Hello?” Sam calls out. No reply. Forsaking his backpack on the couch, Sam walks into the kitchen. It is in utter disarray. This isn’t the usual mess; this is a
"Worst-case scenario, he never regains consciousness." The words knock the wind out of Dean. "He is sedated now, but we will slowly cut back. Then we will have a better idea of what we're up against." The words hold a double meaning in Dean's mind.
"Shit, Cas," Dean says quietly, "I don't know what to say."
"Sugar, so long as you and Dean follow the rules, there's nothing to tell," Missouri answers gently. Cas sniffs and wipes his eyes, grateful that at least his parents won't know any of this. "Castiel," she asks kindly, "what are these tears about?" Cas looks up at her with big, watery blue eyes.
“Actually, no, I’ve got a real serious problem, but you can help,” Dean says gravely, thankful that there seems to be nobody else in the shop.
Cas sleeps through the rest of the night without incident, and Dean eventually falls asleep as well. The dim morning sunlight that makes it through the drawn curtains finds Cas once again curled against Dean’s side, face pressed against Dean’s neck, arm flung over his chest. When Dean’s eyes flutter open, he panics momentarily until he remembers that Sam is no longer staying with them. Then he remains still, allowing Cas to remain asleep against him. But the early morning quiet invites too many thoughts to crowd themselves into his head.
fault. If he hadn't kept calling on Cas, this never would have happened. Whether or not this is a rational line of thinking, this is the way Dean's mind works, the way it has always worked, taking everything upon himself whether it's his place or not.
"Cool," Dean says, "maybe we can hang out sometime after I get out... if you want to." Dean's cheeks turn a little pink suggesting this, hoping he isn't being presumptuous.
“Don’t know. Just do.”
He startles violently when he looks up from his hands. Yellow Eyes is seated opposite him, grinning.
“That, my friend, is bacon on a freakin’ maple donut,” Dean says enthusiastically, “proving bacon should be put on pretty much everything.” After a bite and some serious consideration, Castiel is inclined to agree.
” Dean says with a playful smirk.
“Yes,” Castiel answers, chewing the edge of his lip, “yes, I think so. I want to feel
“We just… it’s complicated.”
“Shh,” Dean hushes him, gathering Cas into his arms. “Yes, you can, Cas. Breathe with me.” Gently, he rocks Cas back and forth, kissing his hair, holding him firmly to his chest. Gradually, Cas’s breathing slows as he begins to fall in line with the rhythm of Dean’s breaths, his sobs becoming less violent. “You’re gonna be okay, Cas, I promise,” Dean soothes, gazing into the boy’s panic-stricken eyes.
“I’m fine,” Dean answers firmly, but then his expression softens. “Why do you ask?”
“Yeah.” Sam sounds distant, his voice small and frail.
“Where am I supposed to go?” Sam sniffs.
"Castiel, I know you haven't forgotten the conversation we had last night," Missouri says, shaking her head.
Suddenly, the door flies open, nearly giving Cas a heart attack.
Castiel gasps at the same time Dean chokes on the water he was trying to drink.
“I really missed you,” Cas says seriously, staring deep into his eyes. “Your eyes are so beautiful, Dean. Look, Charlie, didn’t I tell you?”
“Thank Sammy, it’s one of his old ones.”
“I dunno. Let’s go,” Dean says before pausing, smelling himself, “...after I shower.”
“I don’t even want to know what that is,” Sam says, shaking his head.
“I don’t either, really,” the officer says. “I get it; I’ve been there. Had a rough time growin’ up as well.” Dean doesn’t say anything, but the officer’s words
Dean only stops once to hiss, “I’m not gonna let you fuck me, if that’s what you want.”
A deep, angry voice cuts through the silence.
-The Doors
"What if I just take him in the moment he starts feeling sick?" Dean asks with a sigh.
“Well, I dunno, that’s the confusing part... I mean, we haven’t really been alone together much, but like the couple times we had...contact, I guess, like a hug... and I... well, we held hands once,” Dean continues, stumbling over his words and continually rubbing his face and staring at his feet, “well, it felt good... I just don’t understand.”
“Do you think he could be untied? He understands he can’t mess with any of the stuff attached to him now,” Dean explains.
“Hey, can I ask you something?” Sam says then to the waitress. Dean just stares like a deer in the headlights.
, and all the lights went out, and everything went quiet. And then, a couple seconds later, everything came back on, and the guy was just laying there on the floor for a moment, totally silent. I almost freaked, ’cause I thought he was dead, but then he sorta just woke up, or whatever, and was back to normal. He said he didn’t remember anything about what had happened.”
“Trying something new?” Missouri asks cheerfully.
“Nevermind.”
At the end of the road, Dean slows to a stop, shifting into park before swinging the door open and climbing out. In front of them stands a full size replica of Stonehenge. Sam suggested they visit it because, he had joked, Dean would never board a plane to see the real thing.
“How long have you been here?” Dean asks, his eyes as sincere as ever.
“No, ma’am,” Dean replies, “no questions at the moment.”
, which Dean refrains from teasing him about. Dean would never admit it, but he loves Pixar probably as much as Sam does.
“Oh, oh, Dean,” Cas pants after a moment, “that was amazing.”
Dean holds the needle over his lighter’s flame for a moment or two, trying to decide where to begin. He can’t really see much to sew together, but he knows he has to try. For a moment Dean swears he can see human fear in the angel’s eyes.
"Now, I don't buy that for a minute," Missouri says, her eyebrow raised menacingly.
“Dude, seriously? You know how I feel about chick flicks,” Dean groans, “and didn’t you
“Yeah, I guess that’s what you call it. It’s all so…”
“Yes, Dean?” Cas responds, turning to meet Dean’s gaze.
After a while, Dean stirs in his sleep. He rolls onto his back, mumbling something Castiel can’t make out. Dean’s hand is so close now. Maybe he won’t wake up if Cas touches it. Cas decides to risk it, gently grasping Dean’s hand in his own. Dean stirs again and mutters something that sounds like “Cas?” and Cas braces himself for the shitstorm that will rain down any minute now. But Dean goes quiet again, gripping Castiel’s hand a little in his sleep.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas breaths against Dean’s shoulder. He sounds like he is close to tears.
“Your gently, nurturing side,” Sam says, knowing it’ll make Dean all embarrassed and irritable.
"Fuck, Cas, where are you?" Dean murmurs. All he can do for a while is stand at the bedside and stare. He doesn't know what he's waiting for. A sign or something? But nothing happens. Cas's chest rises and falls as the machine breathes for him. His skin is disturbingly pale. When Dean gathers the courage, he places his hand gingerly on Castiel's forearm and nearly recoils instantly; the angel's skin is
“What do you mean?” breathes Dean, and he finds himself fighting the urge to inch closer to the angel: an urge he doesn’t quite understand.
"Yes, but more specifically, what was 'normal' for
“You do any more drawing yesterday?” Dean asks as he shovels food into his mouth. It’s the first time he’s had any appetite since this whole thing began.
“See, Sam,
“Who the fuck are you?” the woman demands, and Dean fights the urge to run his eyes all over her.
"Bored, I guess. I can't seem to just sit still for hours anymore; my body just gets all twitchy and uncomfortable."
“Itchy?” Dean guesses with raised eyebrows.
“Cas! I’ll see you tomorrow,” Dean says enthusiastically, too impatient to explain anything first.
“Fine. Listen to me though,” Dean says, pulling away to look into Sam’s eyes, “if anything happens, if dad gets mad or drunk or whatever, if he even comes near you, I want you to run. Okay? You run out of there and hide. Keep your phone on you all the time and call here as soon as you can.”
you’re right about,” John snarls back, “I sure as fuck don’t understand. So, what? You got bored of tits and pussy, and decided to try fucking
“Angels don’t feel happiness?” Dean asks curiously.
"Whatever," Dean says, pushing himself up from the table abruptly, and heading for the door.
“Dean, nobody said you are crazy,” she assures tranquilly, “there are many different reasons people are admitted to mental health facilities. It’s not a permanent thing, and it doesn’t mean you’re crazy or that there is something wrong with who you are as a person. We all need help sometimes.” Dean can feel his eyes burning and desperately wants to stop the tears before they fall again.
Dean can’t tear his eyes away from the steady trickle of blood dripping from the angel’s mouth, partly because he can’t bear to meet his gaze. A part of Dean, however, has become mesmerized by the angel’s lips. He doesn’t know why, but he longs to gently wipe the blood from his chin and tell him that everything will be okay. But he can’t.
“You don’t gotta be sorry to me, Cas, but why? Why did you do it?” Dean asks softly.
and for a moment he wonders if he should wake Cas up to see this. He ultimately decides not to though; he’s sure Castiel has seen the stars before. Hell, Cas has probably seen stars formed out of whatever it is they’re made of. Sammy would love this, though, Dean thinks, and with that thought, he drifts to sleep.
"Oh, uh, hey," Cas murmurs, "I didn't think it'd be you."
“We’ve all made mistakes, Dean,” Missouri replies before wishing him a good night for a final time and heading for the door.
just a dream. But he is afraid to look anywhere that isn't straight up at the ceiling.
“I’m sorry I fucked up tonight,” Dean mumbles, deeply ashamed of himself.
And Dean is crying too, hot tears burning trails down his cheeks as he pulls in vain against the restraints, yearning to hold on to his sobbing brother.
“You’re so relaxed,” Dean murmurs, pleased, “so ready for me.” And Cas fuckin'
“Sammy!” Dean gasps, “I’m sorry, ignore him!” But the waitress just laughs good-naturedly.
“Hey,” Dean says comfortingly, “You’ve got us, Cas, me and Sam. We’re with you here. You said they took something from you.”
“That’s because there isn’t one,” Castiel replies, “you know much about the Bible?”
would just
“Don’t really wanna talk about it, okay?”
"Thanks, Cas, that really means a lot to me," Dean says with a genuine smile.
“You know what? Never mind, just enjoy your coffee,” Dean says as he hands the cup over. “Also, that coffee place ain’t all bad, look what else I got,” Dean adds, opening a box and holding it out to Cas.
“Oh,” Dean replies, surprised at her concern for him, “I’m, uh, I’m good. Just glad he’s awake.”
When he steps into the shower, the hot water nearly overwhelms him; it’s always like that at first. Once he acclimates, he takes up the bar of soap, the one he can smell on Dean most of the time, rubbing it over his arms and chest. He has discovered that there are places on his body that feel very nice when they are touched. His back, for one, probably because he can’t reach it himself, but his neck and chest as well. He rubs a hand up his chest to his neck, wondering what it might feel like if someone else were to touch him like that. He thinks he’d like that.
"Cas, I'm just worried about you, okay?" Dean snaps back as the doctor looks confusedly between the two of them.
“No,” Dean says bitterly, “actually, everything’s fucking awful.” He doesn’t turn to face Cas. A jolt runs through Castiel’s chest.
“That’s great, Dean,” Castiel replies enthusiastically.
Now he’s lying in a hospital bed in a dimly lit room, a quiet, constant beep registering every beat of his heart. His head hurts.
Dean is useless in group. He has nothing to contribute, and he has to bite his tongue
blah, blah, blah…” Castiel rolls his eyes, and Dean laughs.
That evening Castiel wakes up hungry which puts a smile on Dean’s face.
“Hold up, Dean, and tell me what’s going on,” Missouri says evenly, turning to face him, “I need you to
The next time his eyes land on Sam and Ruby, Dean notes they’ve inched closer to each other. Gaze still fixed on the TV screen, Ruby slips her hand tentatively into Sam’s. Dean practically
“Thank you,” Cas breathes, “I know I’m being a pussy, but... I dunno...”
. Anyone with me?! I really want to see more of Special Agents Swift and Lovato. 😂😂😂
“I, uh… I fell,” Sam says uncertainly. Dean knows he’s lying.
“Yeah, uh, I guess,” Dean admits.
“Do I have any say in this matter?” Castiel speaks up finally.
“Wanna stay like this forever,” Cas murmurs, and Dean hums in agreement, pressing another kiss to his temple.
“You should rest, not study,” she lectures gently, but brings him the book anyway.
would be interested in,” Sam smirks.
as love-sick as he does, and Cas is doubly glad he didn’t accept Dean’s offer to carry him.
“Well, this is neither of those,” Dean laughs, grinning up at him mischievously.
“I believe you,” Dean promises.
“Good morning, Dean,” he says, sleepy blue eyes gazing up at Dean.
“What hurts?”
“Hell yeah,” Dean laughs, sliding to the floor to kneel in front of his record collection, partially to hide the blush creeping again into his cheeks. He grabs a stack of records and hands them to Cas to look through.
tell him I 'jerk off' to him?"
“Alright. You sit tight. Everything’s gonna be okay, Dean, but you should have called me ages ago, idjit.”
“Damn right,” Dean says, helping himself to one of Castiel’s Cajun fries.
-Led Zeppelin
The minutes crawl by like days, and Dean can't take it anymore.
looked like that.” Cas looks away from him again. “Cas, you gotta tell someone. Missouri…” But Castiel cuts him off sharply.
“Hey, baby,” Dean says gently, “try to relax, keep breathing. Won’t move til you’re ready.” Cas nods, and Dean kisses his lips softly adding, “We can stop if you want to,” but Cas shakes his head. Gradually, Dean can feel him relaxing.
"What? I'm up. What's wrong?" Dean squeezes his eyes tightly against the harsh morning light as his head throbs.
feels off. If you smell sulfur, see anyone with black eyes,
“Shit, Cas, how can I repay you?” Dean asks suggestively, trailing his hand down Cas’s chest to his belly, tugging lightly at his waistband. Cas’s eyes go wide with what he thinks Dean is hinting at. He shivers when Dean runs his palm over his dick. “This, okay?” Dean asks as he rubs more firmly at Castiel’s crotch through his pants.
“Not if you know the right people,” Dean replies mysteriously. Castiel wants to ask him all about each tattoo he has, but he figures that’s probably too personal for now. There’s a brief lull in the conversation as Castiel debates with himself about what to say next. Dean beats him to it, though.
As he approaches his door, Dean is actually waiting for him, leaning against his own door frame. Castiel tries hard not to smile too broadly, but he can’t help smiling a little. Dean, however, looks  distraught.
is not gonna happen.” But now? How did it get to this point? As he watches Cas sleep, he rolls all these thoughts around in his head. It’s all just so crazy, but he can’t deny the warmth spreading through his chest, like a small fire that is steadily growing. It is terrifying, yeah, but there is also an excitement and, perhaps most confusingly, a strange sensation of
” Castiel deadpans.
"Look around, Cas," Dean shrugs, "we're in a
"Sweet view, huh?" Dean asks, turning to Cas. "Beats the hell out of the view of the parking lot at the place in town." Cas nods in agreement, though his view seems only to encompass Dean, who sits on the edge of the bed, loosening his boot laces before pulling them off along with his socks. Then he's up and heading out the door.
“ ‘S kinda hot,” Dean replies, his voice low.
“It’s, uh, it’s Paul McCartney,” Castiel replies, his cheeks turning pink yet
“Sammy, it’s just... I dunno; the whole thing is so complicated. I mean, I know you’re fuckin’ huge, but you’ll always be my little brother, and it’s just hard to say some stuff to you,” Dean says while staring down at his hands on the table. “I’ve always tried to be strong and brave and keep up this image  in front of you, and I don’t want you thinkin’ different of me...”
"Yeah, I got it," Dean murmurs, ducking his head.
The next time the door opens, Dean is greeted by Sam’s smiling, possibly still a little doped-up face.
"You are seriously going to regret that you just said that," Zachariah hisses, seeing red, squeezing Castiel's throat until he is on the verge of blacking out. "Get up!" Zachariah shouts after releasing his grip and getting to his feet. For a moment Cas lays stunned, gasping for breath, his eyes watering.
“Pretty good, actually,” Cas smiles shyly.
“I don’t understand, safe from what?” Sam pleads.
“Good morning, Garth,” she says, “so sorry to interrupt, but I have a new member for you.”
Cas swears, “I wish I could trade her in for a new mother…”
“Oh, sorry, I dunno. Not very hungry,” Cas mumbles.
“Cas,” Dean says, looking up when he hears Castiel’s footsteps approaching, “hey, I know we’ve only got about half an hour before ‘lights out,’ but, uh, you wanna come over for a few?” Dean looks hopeful, like he is really hoping Cas will say “yes.”
“I’m not sure sometimes… I try to tell myself that, but there’s always a part of me that just feels…

“Hey, man, it’s Canadian,” Dean laughs.
“Would you like to fuck me?” Castiel asks suddenly, gazing with longing blue eyes up at Dean.
“You don’t need to fear being alone anymore.” Dean’s hushed words loosen the vice in his chest a little.
“Hmph.”
Dean does his best to help Castiel get comfortable in bed before getting up to check the freezer. He’s in luck: someone has left behind an ice pack. He gratefully returns to bed with it, resting his broken hand on it. At Castiel’s insistence, he takes a pill from Cas’s bottle, and the pain begins to lessen gradually, enough that there is hope he’ll sleep tonight. He shuts off the lights and gropes for Castiel in the dark, who eagerly accepts the invitation to curl up with his head resting on Dean’s chest.
“S’okay man,” Dean replies, clapping him on the shoulder before spitting in the sink and heading back out of the bathroom. Beside the bed, Dean kicks his boots off and hesitantly strips down to his tee shirt and boxers. He tugs one blanket off the bed for himself and shoves the rest of the bedding over to Cas’s side. Sam gives him a weird look.
As they approach the front desk, Cas fumbles in his pocket for the fake ID Sam had come up with for him. Dean had already gone over this process with him, explaining what insurance is and the various lies they would have to tell to the receptionist, including the whole thing about Dean being his brother, “Rob.” They manage to get Cas checked in without too many strange looks from the woman at the desk, and then take a seat. Cas is fidgeting nervously, picking at his fingernails.
“I’ll help,” Cas says, and before Dean has time to think about it, Cas is on his knees sucking Dean’s semi-hard cock into his mouth.
"Thanks. See you." Dean flips his phone closed with a sigh of momentary relief. The panic tightening his chest seems to let up a little. Sam probably doesn't realize the calming effect he can have on Dean, but Sam has always been his anchor, the one constant in his life. Growing up required Dean to be strong for Sam's sake, even if he didn't feel like he was. Like they always say: "fake it til you make it." As a result, Dean feels stronger with Sam at his side (though he'll probably never say it out loud).
“Ooh, burn… no pun intended,” Meg laughs before turning back to Dean. “I may be a nymphomaniac, but I’m clean, baby,” she purrs, and Dean jumps when he suddenly feels her foot running up his leg.
“No, why?” Sam asks.
“Sorry,” Cas says again, wishing he could think of something better.
“So, you and Cas, huh...” Sam says after their beers arrive and their food orders have been placed. Dean stares hard into his glass but smiles before taking a long drink.
Dean feels like he’ll never fall asleep. He can’t wait to get home, to see Sammy, to drive his baby… to see Cas. And Cas sounded so happy about seeing him again. Cas always seems so sincere too, like he’s never told a lie in his life, and again, the anger in Dean flares, thinking about Cas’s family, how awfully they treat him even though he’s likely done little to nothing wrong, ever. He thinks back to the brief moment when he’d been in the presence of Castiel’s father. Their eyes had met momentarily, but Dean had felt an instant, stone cold hatred between the man and himself. He’d looked at Dean like Dean were roadkill, bloating in the hot summer sun. The disgust had been palpable. But that didn’t bother Dean; he didn’t give a damn what the sonofabitch thought of him, he only wants to beat the shit out of the guy for what he’s doing to Cas. Dean isn’t afraid of him either; he knows he probably should be, but he just isn’t. That suit-wearing, Bible-thumping, motherfucker can kiss his white-trash ass.
“Good,” Cas confirms quietly with a blush. Dean huffs a quick breath, somewhat abashed by the intensity of his sudden arousal. Carefully, he reclines against the arm of the couch, hauling Castiel atop himself. He draws Cas into another long kiss, wet and lingering, and Sam must hear it because he whips around, glaring at Dean.
“What?” he says dumbly.
“‘Course not,” Dean answers softly. “Reminds me I almost lost you. How lucky… how grateful I am to have you back.” The answer fills Castiel with an amazing warmth, and he can’t help smiling.
“What?” Bobby asks, voice all concern. “You okay? You got somewhere to stay?”
"He was stabbed or something," Dean tells a nurse hurriedly. "I don't know what really happened; I just came home and found him like this - well he was conscious at first. Lost a lot of blood. Think he's in shock. " At least that was all true, Dean thinks to himself.
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean says past the lump in his throat he refuses to acknowledge. “I really hope I don’t fuck this up.”
Just then Sara enters the room.
“You… so beautiful, Dean,” Cas manages his broken sentence, and Dean doesn’t know what to do with it, or with the look on Castiel’s face, looking at him like he hung the moon. Always bad at receiving compliments or praise, Dean doesn’t know what to say, but he slows the pace a bit, kissing Cas thoroughly, thrusting into him slow and deep.
“Hmm, how strange. Now it’s reading 98.6,” she says to Dean, “which is normal.” She tries Cas again. 108. Frowning, Leah shakes her head and announces she’s going to go get a different thermometer. When she returns, she tries again.
“Is that what it’s called when you want to scratch at something continually?” Cas asks.
“Better,” Castiel answers, “thank you.” And he
” Dean protests, arms still firmly, albeit ironically, wrapped around Castiel’s waist, who now has a rather confused look on his face.
“Well, that’s nice,” Missouri says before returning to the paperwork she had been filling out, allowing Castiel to focus on his music. Dean had recommended
“Mornin’ Missouri,” Dean says, the cheerful tone he uses feeling odd in his mouth.
,” Cas pants again, biting his own lip, “ah, oh Dean, ah,” he continues breathlessly, voice raising in both pitch and volume. “Dean! Oh god, I think … ah, Dean I’m gonna-” But Dean cuts him off with another kiss, not sure he could handle hearing Cas finish that particular sentence. He runs his tongue over Castiel’s, and he can feel Castiel’s hips jerk, Cas’s body spasm against his own as he digs his fingernails into Dean’s back. Then Cas goes limp, panting and melting into Dean’s embrace, his eyelids heavy. Dean stares down at him. It’s a moment before Cas can speak.
"Dude, I don't know, it's just what she said."
“No,” Cas answers simply. “There’s no need as there are no new generations of angels. Angels also do not easily forget past events as humans seem to.”
None of this seems fair.
"Uh, I uh feel fine, I think," Cas answered in an uncertain voice.
Before they’ve gone too far, Dean pulls out his phone and dials Sam.
“But you are planning on telling him?” Cas asks hopefully.
but Dean pulls him in close, pulling the bedding up over them both, cradling Cas’s head in the crook of his neck. They enjoy each other in silence for a while, exchanging gentle touches, before Cas finally speaks.
“Holy shit,” Dean says to Cas, “look how freakin’ high that is!”
"Hey, Dean," Cas says timidly, "would you like to, uh, join me?" He actually sounds shy, and Dean can't help but smile. Looking up at Castiel's hopeful face, Dean chews his lower lip.
Dean helps Cas up when he hears Sam turn the water off.
way in public.
“I don’t know what to say; can we please talk about this later? My head hurts, and I want to sleep,” Dean says hoarsely. He owes Sam an answer; he knows he does, but his brain is shutting down, and he just can’t do it now.
“That gonna make you come?” Dean teases, but seeing the look of confusion on Cas’s face, he smiles softly, taking Cas’s face in his hands again. “Cas, I love you. I really do.” Cas’s face lights up again, and Dean pulls him down for another long kiss. “Now tell me what else you want.”
“Do me one favor?” Cas asks tentatively as he returns to the bedroom with his hands full of first aid supplies.
“Doing alright, angel?” Dean asks sincerely, breathing heavily.
“You need a ride?” Dean then asks, all teasing aside.
?” the guy asks lewdly.
“I... I’ll come with you,” Cas murmurs, the thought of being alone suddenly terrifying him.
“Historic Columbia River Gorge Scenic Byway,” Dean reads aloud as he exits the highway. “Historic
“What do you want me to say?” Dean croaks, utterly broken, “what do you want from me?”
“Dude! You were watching us sleep way back then? That is
“Don’t think I can sleep,” Sam chimes in.
“Yeah, angel, guess I am,” Dean says softly.
“What do you mean?” Dean says, a little louder and more forcefully than he means to.
"In that case, I'll remind you that we have a strict 'no physical contact between residents' policy." At this, Dean's face flushes bright red. "You wanted it spelled out," Missouri adds with a shrug.
“Well, that depends on you, Dean,” Billie asserts placidly.
“Yes. I am pretty tired,” Castiel admits, though he doubts he could fall asleep now.
"No," Dean answers firmly, "I promised Sammy I wouldn't. And I wanna get out of here."
“I do enjoy eating,” Castiel says happily, and Dean smiles.
“Homicidal tendencies. I’ll be sure to add that to the list of shit they need to fix before they let you out of here,” John sneers. “Maybe you can tell them the whole ‘demon thing’ while you’re at it.” Before Dean can say anything, John turns on his heel and storms out of the room. Dean thinks he can hear Sam protesting in the hallway, but all goes quiet after another moment, and Dean is left entirely alone.
“Hey, Cas, you wanna learn how to do donuts?” Dean asks abruptly, weirdly cheerful.
fucking around. “If you
one benefit to being human,” he continues, mouth still full.
“Oh,” Castiel replies, lowering his gaze, “I apologize.”
At the motel Dean showers for the first time in ages and puts on clean clothes (relatively speaking). He downs a few beers and a couple shots of whisky without saying much to Sam before collapsing on the bed fully dressed, passing out, dead to the world around him.
“Uh,” Castiel says, biting his lip, “do you want me to, um, go get Missouri or something?”
“Whatever, man, guess you’re in the right spot, anyway,” Sam remarks, gesturing toward the rainbow flag displayed prominently behind the bar.
“I’m sorry if I caused any of this,” Dean says next, revealing that he feels exactly as Cas had feared he would. “I knew I’d fucked up as soon as your dad looked at me.”
"Yes, Dean, writhe and squirm like the pathetic worm you are," a cruel voice resonates in his head, emanating from the female figure closest to him. "You can cover yourself in ink, and you can talk with your therapist all day long, but you can't hold us off. We know you better than you know yourself. We know your weaknesses, and there are so many! We will
“I’m sorry... maybe Ruby is okay, though. Sounds like she doesn’t like associating with her siblings too much,” Cas offers.
“Then answer my question.”
“Around,” he answers before changing the subject, “how are you doin’?”
"Thank you," Cas says softly, and he can feel Dean shift on the floor beside him.
floods the room, and Cas can’t help smiling.
“Cas, be careful!” Dean yells as he watches Cas eyeing a gutter and the attached downspout. “I don’t know if that’ll hold you!”
“Dean, where is your father? Isn’t he with your brother?” Missouri asks, concern in her eyes.
“Your brother is going to freakin’
“And don’t ‘ma’am’ me!” she teases again, “you can call me Missouri.” Dean nods. “I’ll be checking in on you pretty often as you settle in. We’ll let you know when dinner is, but you’re free till then to take it easy. Gotta keep your door open for now, till you’re settled, sorry.”
When they arrive "home," if you can call it that, Cas flops down on the bed, but Dean grabs his duffel bag and begins rifling through it, tossing out dirty clothes and replacing them with clean(ish).
“Probably because of the
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas rushes to say, startled when he realizes he’s in Dean’s precious “personal space” once again.
“I don’t have a problem with movies about women, I have a problem with movies about women crying and hugging and talking about their feelings,” Dean answers stubbornly.
-The Doors
known
It’s a struggle, but Dean manages the climb inside. As soon as he is panting on the floor, Sam’s arms are around him, his face pressed against Dean’s chest. It hurts, but he doesn’t have the heart to pry Sammy off himself. He feels Sam’s body trembling and knows he’s crying.
"I dunno," he mumbles.
“Yeah, it’s a classic,” Dean says, shaking his head and returning to sandwich duty.
“Woah, Cas!” Dean gasps, “what are you doing?” Dean knows it’s a stupid question.
“What?” Cas asks weakly, leaning over in an attempt to kiss Dean again, to rekindle the fire. But Dean grasps his shoulder, stopping him.
know you’re crazy?” John barks with an evil grin, but Dean doesn’t miss a beat.
Dean walks until he glances over his shoulder and sees his father has retreated into the house. Then he collapses under a tree. He’s not leaving, not without saying goodbye to Sammy. No. Fuck that! He’s not leaving without Sammy, period.
“Who’re you calling a jerk, bitch?” Dean jokes, and Sam laughs. “Come on, I’ll get you that beer.”
The three men pull on extra layers of clothing, and head out into the autumn chill. It’s drizzly; that unique, Oregon
"Well, what?"
"Duh!" Meg says, "I'm a sociopath, not a fucking retard."
“You’re not?” Cas says teasingly.
“Sit wherever,” a waitress greets them with a grin, her arms tattooed up and down with pinup girls and roses. Her long red hair is artfully tousled and, Dean notices, shaved on one side of her head.  “Order at the bar, and we’ll bring it out to you.”
“I understand.” Before ending the call, Dean gives Lisa his cell number, the phone number they can call while he’s in the hospital, and asks her to put him down as an emergency contact for Sam. He sighs as he hands the phone back to Missouri, wondering if he should have told Lisa more.
“Yeah,” Sam says, a smile just visible on his lips in the dark. “Um... promise you won’t make fun of me?”
“Invite Ruby,” Dean suggests and then adds, “I promise I won’t embarrass you,” before Sam can protest.
“Yeah. Uh, can I come in?” Dean asks softly.
"Who are you talking to, sugar?" Missouri asks from his door frame, and Dean whips around to face her, panic in his eyes.
"I'm sorry about that," the woman blurts out, embarrassed.
“No, I… I mean, yeah, yeah it does, but… Cas, it’s complicated, I dunno…” Dean clenches his fists and unclenches them as he struggles for something to say. “Listen, Cas, you need some sleep and to sober up, then we can talk in the morning. Would it help you sleep if I lay next to you?” It’s a stupid question, as Cas has stated plainly on multiple occasions that it
? Probably not real. He double checks all the doors are locked anyway before pulling his jacket tightly around himself and laying down in the front seat. He can see a portion of the sky as he lays on his back, gazing up, out the window. It’s a clear night and without the light pollution of the city, the stars are shining brightly. There are
coffee, there's a coffee shop on the floor below us."
Dean sits on the edge of his bed for a long time, portrait of himself held in his trembling hands. Something in him still can't believe that someone as talented as Cas would waste time drawing
“Yeah, as long as I sleep on the couch,” Sam replies, “and we have to leave her door open when we’re studying in her room.”
“Sam said you were afraid of heights.” Cas looks over in time to see Dean roll his eyes, but he doesn’t deny it.
“Yes, actually,” Sam replies sardonically. Then Cas emerges, freezing when he sees Sam. “Oh, for Christ’s sake,” Sam mutters, scowling between the two.
he thinks. He approaches Cas, resting a hand gently on Cas’s low back, and Dean can almost feel the tension leaving the man’s body.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas says quietly, sounding a little broken. Dean turns then, looking at him.
“Eww, PDA!” Sam interrupts, returning to the table, as he manages to juggle three beers.
the right man for her?”
“I don’t know about all that now,” she says. “Do you have any other family: aunt, uncle, grandparent, we could call instead?”
I actually wrote a new chapter!.... like 7 or 8 years later.....
"Hell hound?"
“Wasn’t any trouble,” Dean deflects softly, “you wanna take one now?” Cas nods and pops one of the tiny pills into his mouth, swallowing it dry. He peers down at the bottle. Ativan. Prescribed to a “John Smith,” which seems obviously fake. Cas doesn’t care where they came from, however, as long as they work.
"You really should come with me tonight and get a good nights sleep. No offense, but you could use a shower too."
"Yes. He's in good hands. Would you like me to take you to the surgery waiting area? It will likely still be a few hours before they're done and it will be easier to keep you updated there."
“You and
He rushes to fix up his bandages the best he can before stumbling out into the hallway. Cas's door is open, and his bed stripped bare. The walls have been emptied of the art that had hung there. Dean panics. He rushes to the nurses' station just in time to see Cas, dressed in street clothes, following Missouri and a man in a dark gray suit, down another hallway
“Shit,” Castiel says, shocked, “your
“Dean, it was survival; you did what you needed to do to keep Sam safe and relatively well fed.” Dean’s eyes go wide as the words hit his ears; his cheeks burn, and his throat constricts.
“I dunno, Sammy. Some people just do terrible things for no reason.”
“You okay?” he asks.
"You've got to be fucking kidding me," Dean replies, struggling to keep his volume low.
, I know,” Castiel replies, rolling his eyes. Just then, That Guy emerges from his room, looking like he’s had a rough night, though the dark circles under his eyes do nothing to detract from his appeal to Castiel.
“How did you meet Pamela?” Cas inquires in a low voice as Dean revs the engine, heading for the bank and subsequently home, “did she do your tattoos?”
-Black Sabbath
"Well, I couldn't make out
“Aww, baby, don’t be mad,” Dean teases further, inching closer to Cas, kissing him seductively at the angle of his jaw. “You know what I’d
"Hey," Dean begins softly. "I'm sorry..." And goddammit, there're suddenly goddamn tears in his fucking eyes. He fights them back, causing his nose to run. He sniffs, wipes his nose on the sleeve of his jacket, and clears his throat. "I'm sorry this all sucks so bad, and you have to go through all this shit." Cas blinks slowly and squeezes Dean's hand a little more tightly. "You gotta believe me, I'd do it all for you, instead of you, if I could." Castiel gazes at Dean solemnly.
“Good. You got people who care about you, son. I wanna hear from you again soon, you got that?”
girlfriend," Dean answers.
“Yeah, we’re good,” Dean assures him.
“Oh,” Castiel says, “I thought you took Oxy.”
“Not hungry,” Dean grunts, “just wanna go to bed.”
. So, Cas, please can the angel talk with anyone besides us or they'll lock you up here and we’ll have a hell of a time trying to get you out." Dean settles in the chair beside Castiel.
“I’m just glad you’re okay,” Sam says, gazing at Dean as if he’s the most important person in the world, and to Sam, he is.
“You know, Cassie, with it being your last night and all, the offer is still on the table...” she smirks. But Cas can’t even be bothered by the nickname “Cassie”; he is too lost in Dean’s face, watching every little facial tick, cementing that gaze in his memory in case it turns out he never eats dinner with Dean again. If Dean notices, he doesn’t say anything. The boys are unusually quiet, so Meg switches tactics.
“What are you doing?” Castiel asks after a while.
“Okay,” Cas answers anxiously, fumbling with the zipper. “Is it going to hurt?” Leah looks confused for a moment but continues on.
“Yeah, I’ll allow it,” he jokes, “c’m’ere, Cas.” Cas leans forward, and Dean inches closer, caressing Cas’s jaw. Their lips meet, and Castiel eagerly crawls out of his pile of blankets into Dean’s arms.
When Dean returns, he is carrying a soda, a beer, and a glass of water, the first of which he tosses to Sam, and the last he hands to Castiel.
- Led Zeppelin,

“Yes,” Castiel affirms before adding, “it was very romantic.” Dean suddenly chokes on his beer, looking thoroughly embarrassed by the implication that he had a
“No,” Castiel answers, shaking his head, “but I guess they’ll keep you as long as your parents want them to, if your parents donate enough money to build a new hospital wing.” Dean stare at him, mouth agape, a look of confusion in his eyes.
“Gonna make you come so hard, baby,” Dean growls against his neck, trailing kisses and gentle bites down to his chest.
"Don't you roll those eyes at me, young man!" she laughs as she stands. "Now, are you alright?" Cas nods, though his face betrays his dejection.
“The stitches?” Sam offers.
“Yeah, man, you totally ‘did it right,’” Dean says affectionately, reaching for the soap. He slowly begins to lather up Castiel’s chest before moving to his shoulders and arms, down to his abdomen, rubbing gently over the scars there. Cas looks at Dean thoughtfully, studying him as Dean continues to wash every part of his body. It feels good; not the same as “hand job, good,” but calmingly good, comfortingly, reassuringly good, and for once, Cas doesn’t fear that Dean is about to run. As Dean shampoos his hair, Cas feels more relaxed than he can remember. Dean’s fingers in his hair, massaging his scalp, seem to tell him everything will indeed be alright.
he swears softly. "Cas, I’m sorry you had to hear all the shit he said,” Dean offers, referring to his dad’s hateful remarks.
“Can you, like, be gay for just one person?”
"Cas," Dean speaks softly as he walks up behind his friend. "What are you doing, Cas?" Dean circles around to face Castiel, but the man doesn't look up.
“Cas?” Dean mouths, incapable of producing sound.
“Dean?” Cas’s voice is urgent as Dean watches him bleed out. “Dean, wake up! Dean!” And he is back in Sammy’s bed, gasping and sobbing, his bandages torn up, and blood running down his arms as his little brother and his boyfriend watch him with terrified eyes.
“Thanks, Dean.”
"What have I told you about talking about
“Oh, uh, hi, Dean,” Cas replies with a tired smile. “You look, uh, better…” he adds before he can think, and his cheeks burn bright red.
“I fail to see the similarity between the two,” Castiel states seriously. Dean laughs, clapping his hand on Cas’s back.
“For understanding so little about what angels actually are, humans sure do name a lot of things after them,” he observes.
“So angels can be friends, but I kind of meant, like if a mommy angel loves a daddy angel very much…?” Dean’s eyes are on the road, but he can almost
had to ask, and hell knows you’re too shy to ever do it. You’ll just sit here like a lovesick puppy dog, like you always do. Really, I’m doing you a favor.” Meg ruffles his hair as Castiel looks like he’s trying his best to teleport elsewhere, his expression a mix of fury and humiliation.
“Cas, you’re sweet, but I’m not afraid of labels, if that’s what you want,” Dean grins in the faint light.
“I’m alright tonight, but finding somewhere to stay is at the top of my to-do list for tomorrow,” Dean tries to joke.
“That’s me,” Dean says.
“Thanks! She’s got good taste,” Dean says, glancing at Sam in the rearview mirror. Before popping in a Zeppelin mixtape and revving the engine as he backs out of the driveway and heads toward Sam’s school.
“Damn right it won’t,” Sam grumbles back, “you’re getting me my own room first thing in the morning.”
“Except you,” Dean says, “you’re just here ‘cause your parents are fucked up.”
“Castiel, you’re smart enough to know the answer to that question.
As Dean washes his face, looking up at himself in the mirror, he finds that for once, he doesn’t hate what he sees. His conversation with Bobby has planted a small seed of hope in his chest, hope that just maybe, everything will work itself out. At least he knows he’ll have one job waiting for him when he gets out. He doesn’t care about the gas station. That place sucks anyway, and he can always find another one, or maybe Bobby could find more work for him. Either way, when he runs into Cas in the hallway on the way to breakfast, he is able to greet him with a smile. It’s times like these that let Dean tell himself that maybe the demons are only bad dreams after all.
“I want to,” Cas replies, though, “I enjoy doing this.” Dean bites his lip, grinning again.
Soon after he has changed, an orderly stops by the room with a wheelchair to take him over to the unit.
“Jesus, Sam, I’ll get myself checked out, okay? Now can we drop it?” Dean says, burying his face in his palms.
“Awesome,” Dean says lamely, overcome with so many feelings he can’t really put a meaningful sentence together. Cas laughs, gently shaking his head.
“Huh?” Dean says, caught off guard.
“Yes,” Castiel says simply.
"Cash, your brothers are here to see you." Panic flits across Castiel's face.
Dean collapses onto his bed, and soon hears a gentle knocking on his doorframe.
"Um, dad?" Dean asked softly.
“And the Fossil Beds?”
“So what?” Dean says. “What’s this place gonna help?”
“Yeah,” Dean replies softly.
"That boy sure is talented," Missouri says softly.
"Um, how long do I need to stay in here?" Dean asks evenly, but the guards have already turned and shut the door. There is a small window in the door, and Dean can tell that one of the men is staying to watch him.
“Yeah, there’s a reason they do,” he says cryptically.
"Well, my shift is over. I'm going to go collapse for a while, but I wanted to be the one to update you before I go."
“You are both lucky to have each other,” Cas says sadly.
“Oh, am I ‘weirded out’ that you drew an incredible picture of me?” Dean asks with a sly grin, and Cas hazards a look at him. “No, Cas, I’m not.” Dean can see the relief flooding Cas’s features as the boy gazes up at him shyly. “I’d like to see it again sometime if you’re okay with that. I’d like to see all the stuff you’ve drawn, really.”
“What? What do you mean?” Dean asks, his brows knit together in concern.
“Fine,” Dean concedes, “but can we all just drop it for now?”
“See you tomorrow, Sammy,” Dean smiles, so thankful to be able to say that.
-The Who
“You won’t, though, right?” Sam asks softly.
“That’s a little unsettling, dude,” Dean deadpans as Cas stares at him.
When Cas comes to a final stop, he turns to Dean, who still has his arm around him, and leans in close. Their lips meet, moving lazily against each other before increasing in pace. Cas climbs up onto Dean’s lap, facing him, running his hands up Dean’s firm chest and shoulders.
week or more in the hospital.
sake, indeed,” Meg replies with a smirk before adding, “oh, lighten up, Castiel, it’s not like you weren’t wondering the same thing.” At this, Dean turns to Cas, who quickly averts his gaze, blushing furiously. Dean wonders if it’s true. Is Castiel interested in him like that?
“Just be careful, sugar,” she says a little sadly.
“Ugh,” Cas groans.
“Shut up, Dean!” Sam whines, “we have to make a diorama of a Civil War battlefield. Ruby said she was gonna be up all night making severed limbs out of clay.”
“And?” Dean says after a moment, as if he’s expecting Castiel to continue, to get to the part when he says what’s “wrong” with him.
"What?" Dean asks.
"And then we can leave, right?" Cas asks, looking expectantly at Dean.
“Dean?” Cas slurs.
"I wish I had that," Castiel murmurs.
“No, of course I don’t,” Castiel asserts, “but I can’t do this unless you really mean it.”
“Does it always make you dizzy?” Cas asks, yawning, “and sleepy?”
Finally, a man enters dressed in hospital scrubs.
"He's my brother. Half brother. Different dad." Very different dad. Dean isn't sure why he said it, but it's probably for the best, legally speaking, if he claims they're family; he might have more of a say in what happens from here concerning Cas.
“Just wondered if you’re awake,” Castiel says softly.
“I’m having a hard time keeping my eyes open, and talking seems difficult.”
“Thank you, Becky! Your enthusiasm is much appreciated, as always,” Garth gently cuts her off. “Next?”
"Dean?" a soft voice asks tentatively, and Dean's eyes flutter open, revealing to him that it is daylight. He must have fallen back to sleep after all.
“That all sounds…
“It’s alright, Cas. You should probably get some rest,” Dean replies.
about him, and his uncle had enthusiastically offered to lend a hand in “setting him right.” Since then, Zachariah has appeared every time one of his parents has a complaint about him, and his methods are
“Can you come see me now?” Sam asks hopefully.
“Well, I am now, but I suppose even before my grace was taken from me, I had begun to identify with the male identity of my vessel; most angels do, if they spend enough time in a vessel. It felt very strange at first. I once spoke with Anna about it. She truly enjoyed being a human woman.” There is an awkward pause as Dean recalls enjoying Anna’s being a woman as well. Cas remembers too. Anna had been one to kiss and tell, and she had told Cas
When Sam returns, he hands Dean his coffee.
“I don’t know. Do I?” Cas looks at him seriously.
“What? What do you mean?” Dean asks as his mind begins to race.
Dean breathes a little sigh of relief when he ends the call, tossing his phone onto the dashboard.
"It must be hard for you, though," Cas jokes, "being constantly mobbed by girls who think you're hot." He hopes Dean doesn't pick up on the tinge of jealousy he feels. It would be nice to be wanted, Cas thinks.
“Just one. Sammy’s thirteen. He’s a great kid though, really smart, real caring.” Dean suddenly looks like he’s gone far away, a somber look in his eyes. “Fuck… feel like I really let him down,” Dean adds bitterly.
"Oh, sorry, nothing, Cas, l'm done anyway," Dean rushes, handing the phone back to Cas who slips it into his pocket. "These are some damn fine pancakes," he adds, stuffing his mouth full. Cas laughs and takes a drink of coffee. It's black, and he nearly spits it out, but gulps it down before reaching for the sugar. Dean grins at him.
way. "I mean he sorta, like, stood up for you after you stormed off the other morning."
“They’re going to take good care of him,” is all she can promise.
"Dude, you grabbed my ass just yesterday," Dean bites back, in no mood for whatever
“Hey,” Dean says softly to him, “m’right here with you.” Cas looks up at him and Dean realized Cas is reaching for his hand. Dean’s first instinct is to panic, glancing around quickly to see if there are eyes on them. He’s quickly ashamed when he realizes what he’s doing and takes Castiel’s hand, hoping Cas didn’t catch the moment of hesitation.
peace when he's alone. Castiel understands what it can be like, alone with your own thoughts for too long, unable to keep the intrusive, torturous ones at bay.
Cas whispers loudly,
"Really?" Castiel questions, an unfamiliar glimmer of hope in his expression.
“Dean, this is too much,” she protests, but he shakes his head.
“Well, our dad’s a piece of shit, so there’s one reason,” Dean says bitterly. “I’ve been gone one fuckin’ day, and Sammy’s wrist is already broken,” Dean mutters, wiping more tears from his cheeks.
?” Cas repeats.
“Nothin’ wrong with that! My mom liked The Beatles.
“What?”
“Cas, how are you feeling now?” Dean asks. Cas has been unusually quiet all morning.
"What? N-nothing," Castiel stammers, "we were just talking."
"For what?"
“Shit,” Dean says, staring down at his hands. “Sam, I…” Dean begins, but doesn’t know where he’s going.
“No,” Dean replies, “but you’ve been through a shit load of traumatic stuff. Lots of people take meds to help with anxiety. I could ask Sam; he knows a lot more than I do about that stuff.” Cas nods his understanding. The shaking in his body has eased at last, and he begins speaking in a quiet voice.
"That's okay, Cas; you aren't the only one," Sam assures him. “Anyway, how do you
“What did I just say? Not another word.” Sam nods and follows his dad down the hallway, away from the person that he loves more than anything in the world.
"Thanks. Give your brother my best, and Rob, take care of yourself." Dean nods and smiles as she turns to go.
doesn’t have to know. He doesn’t know why, but the thought of telling Sam that he and Cas are
"Why? You got short-term memory loss or something?" Dean spits, "he's your 'best friend' one day and the next you don't remember him?" He is about to lose it.
"Hmm, ok I guess, but I'm keeping all my clothes on," Dean says without thinking which only serves to confuse him more. Cas looks confused by the comment too, but scoots over to one side as far as he can before peeling the blankets back on the other side as an invitation to Dean.
“Yeah. I’m in the ER right now. Wanna see you, Dean,” and Sam suddenly sounds even younger than he is.
-Boston
“I know what I’m doing,” Dean says with a full mouth.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel says quietly, suddenly feeling cold. This is what rejection feels like, and it’s painful as hell.
“So, lemme get this straight,” Dean says after a while, “they think you’re evil for being attracted to dudes, but abusing an underage family member is A-okay?” Cas averts his gaze but explains further.
“Well, you seem... different today. How are you doing?”
“Um, well he’s really talented, like he does really awesome drawings and stuff, and he... I feel like I can tell him stuff I’ve never told anyone. Like, I really trust him, and he’s just accepting and he’s really understanding. And I’ve never really felt that way about

Dean smirked. “Well, look at you, embracing the proletarian’s lifestyle…”
have known.
“Thank you, I hope we can make it work again.”
and so Castiel, who had never worked a day in her secluded life, had found it. And she had immediately understood why the shop had difficulties keeping their employees…
She reached for it blindly and picked up.
“Actually, you spilled your drink because someone pushed you right, I saw it. It would be reasonable to ask for the waitress to pay for the dry-cleaning. After all, this  mess is her fault, and as I said, this suit is very expensive…” He paused, now glaring down at Castiel. “Where is she anyway? Did she run away?”
was a small bookstore with emerald green half-timbering. The sign was written in golden gothic cursive fading a little because of the weather and the window display was kind of dusty.
“I understand you’re distressed right now but…” before she could finish Dean cut her short.
“What if I was interested?”
That was written in dark cursive on the wood of the big door leading to the stairs and Dean knew it was from François Truffaut.
“Is this your idea of a goodbye? Insulting people?”
(See the end of the chapter for
But soon, Castiel couldn’t see her for Dean was now in front of
“That’s the point.”
“I thought you would never come.”
“You haven’t understand yet Sammy? With that big brain of yours you can be quite slow sometimes.”
Dean sighed heavily. She felt like the frigging Mount Everest was actually on her shoulder.
“I do not want to fight!” the woman retorted sharply. “I didn’t come here to fight!”
“At least I don’t have anger issues.” Castiel retorted as she rose her chin high, and Dean would have made a snarky comment about pedantry and prejudice if Rowena had not exclaimed, seemingly entertained:
Empty movie theaters were always strange and peaceful. Castiel did went to the bathroom before wandering the different hallways. She saw a partially opened door and was curious but the “Entry Forbidden” sign discourage her to climb the narrow concrete stairs leading upstairs… A worn out cat suddenly crossed her path as she was looking for an exit. Its ears were scarred and its tails was bent at the end in a strange angle. But it seemed healthy and friendly nonetheless. It came to rub against her ankle and Castiel gently scratched her ears and soon she could feel it purring against her hand. She vaguely wondered if having a cat in a movie theater was hygienic and asked herself if she needed to make it leave but she decided against it.
Castiel looked at her closely. Ripped jeans, and worn-out boots. Brownish jacket, at least three times too big for her. Dark bags under her eyes and a very masculine ring on one of her fingers. She looked… cheap. She was out of place, even for the staff. Plus, her fingers looked cold, so this jacket of her wasn’t even doing its damn  job.
This was all so mundane … But she made an effort and searched for all her old sociable skills to be polite and delightful.
“God! Would you let me talk?” the bookseller started to seem annoyed, but Dean wasn’t having any of it.
“I hear you guys!” come the voice of Garth “and not my fault, I was in a rush to find a present for my…”
That always made Sam bittersweet, Sam would certainly have enough after college, but Dean would certainly not.
After that douchebag of a student had knock her tray over and after the bookseller had step between them (before she could knock
The same went for the other shops. Some of them really busy, some other (the umbrella maker from Boulevard Saint-Michel) quiet and desert. People barely talked to her, but some were friendly enough to ask some questions about
“Gabriel.”
“Isn’t it usually a young man delivering the program?” She asked, tilting her face and frowning slightly.
She could now see the white of Zacharia’s teeth as he sneered. But all at once his grimace vanished, replaced by a smirk.
First shop was a starbuck (
That being said, L’Utopia was still running… or rather, limping. Its old and ragged red carpets and its apparent stones were for the regular visitors part of its charm, as for the eternal dust smell and the narrowed stairway leading to the second and third floors, where two rooms with creaking seats were waiting.
Castiel had deflated and her angry expression had turned rather gloomy. Dean had refused to feel guilty for that fact, the woman had been rude
“You don’t need any rude and annoying roommates!”
“Being yourself is usually annoying enough, at least for us, people coping with you every day.”
She unlocked the door, smiling and opened it to greet Sammy’s friends, but she wasn’t met by the artsy chick she was expecting in her head when her brother told her Gaby was an art student.
“Is the job still available?”
“Hmm may I help you ?” the man had said, unsure.
that Dean befriended a long time ago and that could roll her r’s like Edith Piaf. The apartment was small, but Parisians were used to party in tiny and cramped places. Her only disappointment was Jo, Helen and Bobby, still in Toulouse. They would not be here tonight. Dean was excited but it would be a lie to deny that she was a little bit self-conscious at the idea of talking with so many well-educated students…
“It could be… I found it here when I first bought the shop, in the cellar. I think it’s cute.” And Chuck struck her in the shin with the infamous duster. “Oh, and also, what about the shoes?” Chuck asked. “Not your usual style. Did someone forget them here?”
She was finally reaching the last shops she had to visit and if she was fast enough, she could have thirty minutes to eat before running the first movie. The old ally she found herself wandering in was quiet, which was strange considering it was near la Rue Soufflot leading to the Panthéon, La Sorbonne and the Garden. It was a charm Dean appreciated in Paris : you never knew when you were going to found a tiny street and its mystery.
When she first step inside the bookstore she was struck by the smell: old books, leather and ink. She rarely visited bookstores and libraries, it was more Sammy’s thing, but she couldn’t deny this place had some character. The wooden shelves crawling under the books, the old movie and theater posters on the walls. Some in black and white other in technicolor. She was surrounded by books, from floor to ceiling. Some sections selling used books, pages yellowish and cracked, other brand-new ones. Woods pillars were bursting from the floor at some corner and the wormed wood-floor creaked under her feet.
she very much wanted to have another drink. But when she turned around (quite gauchely) she was met by a familiar face. Sun-kissed hair, freckles and a nose slightly crooked were looking at the gathering. Here was the rude employee, standing in the middle of the crowd, tray in hand and general annoyance written all over her composure. Castiel could see it in her frown, in the way her lips tightened and in the knuckles of her hands, gripping the tray too hard.
old) film projector and had to find the film rolls. She was always very cautious while she manipulated it.
“Eileen is brilliant Dean!” he told her as Eileen laughed easily, “She’s able to find the flaw in any file almost immediately while I need at least some days to study it!”
The patio door opened, sitting at the tiny green table on her balcony, a cup of coffee hot and ready, Castiel allowed herself to empty her mind, concentrating on the smoke, feeling the cigarette butt between her slender fingers and a breeze blowing. She closed her eyes, letting all of the city noises slide on her. The neighbors’ TV, people walking and talking, cars in the distance, dogs barking. She was used to these sounds, they felt comforting tonight. It was a little cold because of the wind, but the sun was warm on her skin and she wanted to enjoy it before it disappeared behind the building. The record player was now sitting quietly on her tiny coffee table before the couch. She intended to look at it more closely the next weekend.

“Well, like I said before, I’m happy for both of you,” Sam says softly, “I know you’ve always believed you couldn’t have a serious relationship in this life, but I’ve never wanted that for you. Never wanted you to live your life alone. You deserve better than that, Dean.”
Dean ends the call with a promise to talk to Sam again soon and continues to drive in silence for a while. Eventually, he takes a deep breath and lets it all back out.
Cas smiles as Dean wraps an arm back around him and they begin the descent.
“How is your home life, Dean?” Billie returns, and Dean realizes she isn’t looking at him with the pity that the other people have, the pity that makes him sick to his stomach. Regardless, he doesn’t want to say something that would prompt any investigation by Child Protective Services. He fears losing Sam to the system as much as Sam does, maybe more.
"Fuck," he says to himself, leaning against the wall before sliding down to a seat on the padded floor. He just wants to go to his bedroom and listen to his music. It's too quiet in here, and his thoughts are warring among themselves in his head.
“Thank you, angel,” Dean whispers, and Cas can swallow his anxiety for a moment. Then he takes a seat as instructed, slightly reclined. Dean pulls up a chair and sits beside him, leaning over and grasping his hand. “You’re gonna be fine,” Dean assures, pressing another kiss to Castiel’s cheek. Sam stands by curiously, clearly relieved that he’s escaped Cas’s fate.
be discussing this again.”
Cas dozes as Dean drives, the road snaking its way up the mountain until they reach Government Camp. There is some snow piled up along the sides of the highway, left by the plows after a snowstorm a few days earlier. The road is clear, though, and the piles of snow are gray and dirty, covered in gravel thrown up by passing cars. Evergreen trees, mostly subalpine fir and mountain hemlock, form dense forests on either side of the highway as well. Government Camp sits at about 4,000 feet of elevation, and after that they’re descending again, winding around down the other side of the mountain, passing through the tiny towns of Rhododendron, Zigzag, and Welches before reaching Sandy, Gresham, and back into Portland.
"We'll figure this out, okay?" Dean can hear Cas breaking down on the other end of the line, and he feels so helpless, only able to give Cas words when he wishes he could hold on to him tightly, protecting him from the rest of the world.
“Sure did! And then some,” she says, looking rather proud. “Nothing like hiking in past where most people turn around, lightin’ up a bowl, and gettin’ your nature on,” she adds with a wink. “Well, I mean, I usually vape out there these days. Don’t wanna be the jackass who burns the place down!”
"Well I think it's awesome how you're taking care of Sam. I can barely
Don’t worry, cariño, she will never notice one bottle is gone! Half of the prescriptions on her nightstand are written in your or one of your siblings’ names anyway…” she says, rolling her eyes. Cas stares at her with wide eyes and a crooked smile as she kneels to begin scrubbing his carpet.
“Holy shit!” Dean grins, “if it weren’t for the hypocrisy, they’d almost sound like a fun bunch.” Cas just shakes his head, laughing.
“I’m okay,” Castiel replies tiredly.
“Dean, I know how important Sam is to you, how much you value his approval,” Cas begins, and to Dean’s horror, it sounds like Cas is about to start crying. “Dean, if you don’t want to tell him... I don’t know. How am I supposed to feel about that?” And then a tear does roll down Cas’s cheek, and he hurries to wipe it away. “The past couple days were so perfect, and I... “ Cas trails off, afraid he’ll start crying harder if he continues to speak, but then Dean is scooting closer to him on the seat, pulling him into an embrace.
“Oh, uh, I’m not sure. I mean, he’s gay, but I don’t know if he’s interested in me like that. I think he might be, I mean, his friend said he is, but she’s also a frickin’ psychopath, so I dunno.” Dean continues fidgeting with his hands.
“Dad’s gonna be so mad,” Sam worries softly from within the bedroom as he stands, observing Dean painting the rest of the sigils.
"Because. Okay? C'mon." But Cas doesn't move. He just sits, drenched, rain streaming through his hair, running off the end of his nose. "Listen, Cas," Dean begins gruffly, "I know I’ve been a dick and I owe you an apology, but can we do this inside where we won’t freeze our asses off?" Only then does Castiel look up, and Dean immediately hates himself a little more as his eyes are met by Cas's, full of achingly profound despair.
Homophobic slurs
"You know, trying to make people think they're going crazy," Missouri explains. "Oh, and that reminds me, the evening shift staff was holding these, but you can have them back now." Relief floods over Dean as she hands him Cas's iPod and the portrait he'd drawn of Dean.
“As I have told Sam many times, about many different things:
“No.”
"My name is Bridget. I am a social worker here at the hospital, and I would just like to get a little more information about the patient you brought in."
At the unit, he is taken through two sets of locking doors and is patted down by the officer, who is apologetic, explaining that it’s policy. Dean expects he is going to tire of “policy” pretty damn quickly. Once they are satisfied that he isn’t carrying anything illicit on his person, he is led into a hallway lined with doors to the patients’ rooms. Most of the doors are left open, and Dean can see other kids lounging around on their beds or sitting at desks.  Most of the kids seem younger than he is, and only a few bother to glance up at him as they pass. The place isn’t the dreary hell-hole he had pictured, filled with psychotic screaming kids; in contrast, it seems pretty cheery. The walls are painted light blues and greens, and most of the staff he can see smile at him as he passes. Most importantly to Dean: he gets his own room. He hadn’t been sure, but he was afraid he was going to be stuck in a cell with some crazy kid.
” Cas utters as his back arches and he thrusts autonomically into Dean’s hand.
“What did they say?”
“Oh, what’s going on?” Sam immediately sounds nervous.
Dean is actually doing this
“Don’t you dare speak to me like that with that cock suckin’ mouth of yours!” And there it is. If there was any doubt in his mind before that his dad knew the truth about his arrest, it was gone now. And then he’s seeing stars, laying on the ground, blood dripping down his chin. “Now get up and face me like a fucking man!” John shouts from above him as he lays stunned and motionless. Dean tries backing away, but John has him by the shirtfront again, dragging him to his feet.
“I know. Doesn’t make sense. But I got to go,” Dean says into Sam’s hair. Sam pulls back a little so he can look up at his big brother.

“Ugh,” Castiel says dramatically, rolling his eyes.
“Sixteen,” Cas says softly.
“He’s cute; I like him,” Pam announces, returning to Dean, who grins at Cas. Cas reddens, his lips quirking into a smile, and they trail her to the back of the shop. “I truly hope these help,” she offers, handing a bottle to Cas. “But, please, use them only as directed, one to two pills a day, only as needed.”
“Why?” Cas asks, “I mean, why do you do it?”
“Uh, you okay in there, Cas?” Dean asks.
“Thanks! I’m Charlie, by the way.”
“I know. That would still be weird. Do you see me sleeping with Sam?” Cas furrows his brow.
“What are you talking about?” Dean asks, confused by Sam’s apparent anger.
“No, Cas,” Dean says, walking over and sitting across from him, “you aren’t a burden. I’m sorry. I’m an asshole sometimes. It doesn’t have anything to do with you, okay?”
“And you call
“You don’t have to answer that!” Castiel interjects as if he is Dean’s defense lawyer. “Please ignore her.” Dean laughs. He feels a little bad for Cas, but the whole thing is pretty funny, really.
“May I have one?” Cas asks, eyeing the beer.
at him. It's the most beautiful smile Castiel thinks he has ever seen, and the fact that it's directed at him takes his breath away.
“Yeah, I guess,” Cas agrees softly.
“Dean, that report went out all over Kansas, and probably into the surrounding states!
“Don’t know. Don’t really matter. Figured we could use a break from this place. Might be nice to get out for a day. And if you get too tired, you can sleep in the backseat.”
"In that case, I'm seriously re-evaluating our
"You had better not step one toe out of line between now and next week when the program begins. I'm sure you would like to heal before the five hour car ride it will take to get to the camp. So do yourself a favor and ask God for forgiveness, study your Bible, and pray that He gives you the strength to resist your own wicked nature. Goodbye, Castiel."
” Cas replies, wide blue eyes locked on Dean’s. Dean rolls his hips gently, pushing just inside, waiting for Cas to adjust to the sensation. Castiel moans loudly, his head swimming. The sensation is so
that sonofabitch is fucking up his life! How can he ever explain this mountain of baggage to Cas? In Cas’s mind, everything is so black and white, but Dean? Dean is all sorts of shades of gray.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says firmly, “you are
“Uh, I was hoping maybe you could give me a ride home. They can’t get hold of my dad.”
“When should I worry about it?” His eyes are wide, searching.
it really does feel good.
hear from your father, will you please have him call us right away?”
“Uh, okay,” Dean says with a crooked smile, making his way to the side of the bed where Cas struggles to get upright. Cas pulls him to a seat at his side and then into a long, drawn-out kiss that causes Sam to clear his throat loudly.
“There’s no ‘and,’ Dean,” Cas says quietly.
“Well, then going in a circle might be a good way to start,” Dean grins and winks.
Alone in his room, Cas lays awake, unable to shut off his mind. He wonders if Dean is awake too, if he's able to find
“Ah, shit,” Dean says under his breath. It’s Sammy, asking if they’re still on for dinner tonight. “Cas, I gotta call Sam real quick. Try to get some rest, okay? I’ll be right back.” Cas nods, trying to focus on the record playing softly instead of the pressure in his chest.
“Dean,” Missouri says sternly, unshaken by his outburst, “I want to help you. We all want to help you, but I can’t do anything if you can’t keep yourself under control. There are a few nurses in here who’d have called security already. We have seen a lot of kids lash out, angry, frustrated. They get violent. Now I want to give you the benefit of the doubt, Dean. I don’t believe you want to hurt anyone here except maybe yourself. Am I right about that?” Dean nods, and hangs his head. He can feel blood dripping down his fingers where he’d popped a stitch in the palm of his hand.
“So what’s with all the crazy names, anyway? Your family in some kinda cult or something?” Dean asks, obviously changing the subject. Castiel snorts again.
“You hardly fucking raised me at all!” Dean says through clenched teeth.
“I guess we’ll find out!” Cas replies. Dean notices now that Cas has his backpack on his back and bites his lip nervously, holding his breath as Cas crouches down, shimmying closer to the edge of the roof.
“No,” Cas says quietly, hanging his head.
"First of all, trying to get you warmed up so you don't freeze to death... Now you can take your own pants off. I'm gonna find something dry for you to wear." Dean rummages through his duffle bag and finds a clean pair of boxers and an old AC/DC tee shirt he's had for as long as he can remember. When he returns to the bathroom, Castiel is standing motionless, right where Dean left him, only he's completely naked, his soaked pants and underwear in a pile at his feet.
“And what do you mean by ‘weird,’ anyway?” Dean adds with the air of being offended. "
“He is. Just can’t quit worrying about him. He deserves so much more than all this.”
“Holy fucking hell,” Dean swears softly. “Does it... uh... does it go all the way down?” he asks hesitantly.
“Yes,” Cas says simply, and then to Dean’s horror adds, “we are in a relationship.” Dean is bright red when Cas looks over at him.
help him sleep if Dean is next to him, but Cas smiles a little and nods.
“Cas?” Dean asks cautiously, but Cas doesn’t look up at him. "
It’s raining hard by the time they reach the motel room. The sky, sunny and blue yesterday, is a slate gray. The clouds look ominous, thunderheads moving in from the east.
“Your brother tells me you’re in pain,” she says calmly.  “Please be sure to let us know in the future; it’s important that we keep your pain under control.”
“Yeah, his uncle. That’s why he’s with us now,” Dean discloses softly.
"Sorry. I'm sorry," Dean mutters, averting his eyes and burying his face in his hands. Eventually he feels a weight settle beside him on the bed. Then, to his utmost surprise, he feels a tentative hand on his shoulder.
“Yeah, yeah, alright. Hey, I’m gonna go out for coffee, you guys want anything?”
“We’re just friends,” Castiel rushes to say, “I mean, we’ve only known each other for like a day and a half… anyway, why didn’t you warn me about Meg when you saw us talking? Why is Dean different?”
He hates himself for what he has done, for almost everything he has ever done. His only success in life has been protecting Sam, and now he’s fucked that all to hell too.
“So what did you guys get up to when I was gone?” Sam asks and suddenly turns bright red as the answer dawns on him before either man can answer him. “I mean…” Sam starts to stammer, but Dean saves him again.
"But he feels fine," Dean argues.
“Okay, Dean,” Cas agrees, leaning forward to kiss him again.
“What do you mean?” Dean asks.
“Oh, spinach and chicken sounds good,” Cas answers. Then Dean is standing there staring at him with a grave look on his face, shaking his head.
“It was in the movie.”
“Dean,” is all he says, once again staring at his hands. Becky and Anna are exchanging knowing looks, pretty much gossiping with their eyes, and Castiel feels a ridiculous stab of jealousy when Dean simply glances in their direction.
“Thanks,” Dean says quietly, “for everything.”
“Look, Cas, it’s nothing personal, okay? I just don’t want anyone to look at us weird.”
“Your brother?” Castiel asks, wishing he were better at this. Dean nods.
After breakfast, the two walk back toward their rooms. It's Saturday, so they have a little more free time today.
Castiel, likewise, is at a loss for words.
“I’m sorry, she is not working this evening, can I take a message?”
Somehow, Castiel finds himself slipping his hand gently into Dean's, and to his utter surprise, Dean grips it, their fingers lacing together. They sit silently, and Cas has a hard time believing that this is truly happening. Sure, it probably isn't romantic, Cas has to remind himself. Dean probably doesn't begin make-out sessions by talking about his dead mom. Still, it's more than Cas has ever gotten from a boy he's liked. And then Cas is
“Alright,” Cas says with another small smile, and he turns back toward the Impala.
“Yeah,” Cas answers quickly, “I’m fine.” Dean isn’t convinced, but he nods and kisses Cas’s lips quickly, causing Sam’s eyes to go even wider than they had already been. But that is nothing compared to when Castiel sits up, and the blankets fall from his shoulders.
"Ugh," Cas groans with an eye-roll.
“I dunno,” Cas murmurs, “I know it’s stupid, but I really don’t want to be alone... but I also don’t want to embarrass you in front of your friend.”
"Maybe," Dean suggests, "you aren't as close to him as you seem to pretend to be.
“It’s alright if you’re nervous, but the staff over there are great. They could really help you.”
"I picked that up for you when I checked us in," Dean remarks as Cas pulls a brick-red sweatshirt out of the bag. It feels thick and warm in his hands. The front reads
“Make yourself comfortable; I’ll be right back,” she says to him, and Dean plops himself down on the couch. He rubs his eyes again and runs his fingers through his hair a couple times, hoping he doesn’t look like the wreck he is.
"Are you trying to tell me that you're seein' shit that ain't there?" John spat, his temper rising, "as if this family don't have enough problems?"
The panic attack leaves Cas feeling beaten and raw, supremely vulnerable on top of his already fragile state, but he isn’t alone. He has Dean.  Dean, who has cut and burned his own body, leaving lasting scars in his wake, would move mountains to ease the suffering of those few he has let into his heart.
“We’re all a little fucked up some way,” Castiel says.
"I do what I can," Meg smiles. "Now let's go get lunch," she says, grabbing his arm and tugging obnoxiously.
“I can see every one of your eyelash hairs
“Well, just give me notice so I can get Sammy, my record collection, and Baby out of there, and make sure my dad is drunk and preferably asleep, and then you can have at it,” Dean smirks.
“I dunno, Sam. Don’t worry about it, ’kay?”
“You alright?” Dean says softly, sensing the unease in Cas.
"The volume of blood he lost is usually what we call 'incompatible with life.' In other words, fatal. And in all my career, I have never seen an abdominal injury like this."
"Ugh," Cas comiserates, "I wish she'd just lay off once in a while."
“Pretty sure we could walk. Come get the car later.” Sam struggles to get his GPS up on his phone as Dean struggles to calculate a tip, gives up, and just leaves what is most likely way more than necessary.
“Eww, BARF!” Sam grimaces, “don’t make me puke!”
"Not in Kansas, I guess," Cas sighs.

“We don’t need to talk about it,” Dean rushes to cut him off, “yes, let’s go get breakfast.” So they do.
"These people, Dean, they won't listen to me, and I feel so... so strange."
Dean wakes, a strangled scream in his throat. He sits shakily on the edge of his bed, panting, gasping for breath, his hands trembling as he feels sweat trickling down his back.

"Your brother?" Cas asks softly.
“I sometimes wonder that myself, Cas.” Dean attempts a soothing tone. “Hey, are you in pain?” he asks, registering the unease in those intensely blue eyes. Castiel nods weakly.
Dean’s usual spot is vacant. This fact does not unduly astound or concern Sam when he rounds the corner of the school, taking in the parking lot before him. Though his older brother is waiting on most days, ready to drive him home, Dean’s absence has of late become more frequent. Maybe he has gotten into trouble, or possibly he is passed out drunk at home. It wouldn’t be the first time for either scenario, so Sam shoulders his backpack and trudges down the sidewalk, commencing the 40-minute walk home. He could ride the bus, but he doesn’t. In a single moment, Sam makes a seemingly inconsequential decision that will prove to be one that he will regret for years to come. In Sam’s mind, he will always wonder if everything may have turned out differently if only he had arrived home even fifteen minutes sooner. He will drown in the sea of “if only’s,” blaming himself for not having seen it coming, but how could he have? He is just a kid.
