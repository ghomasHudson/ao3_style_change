Steve frowned, making sure the world knew he was disappointed in Clint. “You let someone get the drop on you, so you weren’t on our six.”
Bucky sighed and out of the corner of his eye Clint saw him turn his own page. He was nearly positive Bucky was doing the same thing he did with his reports. Fifty pages about Steve asking the morlocks to leave the subway alone was unreasonable. There hadn’t been a single weapon discharged in the entire thirty-minute ordeal. “No. They’re not bright enough.”
Natasha rolled her eyes and pushed Bucky off of her. As though she hadn’t imposed herself on their far more important discussion. “Just don’t go to the lab if having the wizard here bothers you so much, Steve.” She looked down at Clint and Bucky, “And Clint, try a new restaurant. The diner is terrible.” She smiled plaintively and moved swiftly out of the room.
“Don’t be dumb, Steve.” Bucky was on a roll, apparently, he was sold on Tony’s new ideas. That was probably dangerous as well. “You just gotta hold them off until someone can bring your shield.”
They went quiet once they saw Tony’s open door. It wasn’t fair if they gave Tony too many hints. (Clint really needed Tony to win, he didn’t know what he’d eat if he couldn’t have pizza.)
Steve smiled, knowing he’d hit a tender spot. Tony loved when he talked about technology incorrectly. It was basically foreplay. “Technology is just there to rot our brains out and make us sheep.”
Bucky rubbed Natasha’s thigh gently and shrugged his shoulder, “I’m contractually obligated to agree with whatever Steve’s position on the argument is as per the document I signed in 1925.”
If he made it seem like Tony’s idea then they could probably get in a round or two in the lab. He smiled at the thought and put his magazine down on the work table. As Tony turned around, he unzipped his hoodie. He was dating an easily distracted man. A glimpse of muscles and Tony couldn’t focus on work.
. The report was probably more interesting, Clint thought, at the very least it was shorter. Bucky liked boring shit like that though, he said he hadn’t read well before the war so he was enjoying one of the few benefits Hydra had conferred on him. Clint could respect that. “Steve still looks over his shoulder for the cops if you so much as stand next to me.”
Steve shrugged and leaned against the door, locked into whatever 1940s bullshit argument had commenced. “Howard only liked Peggy really.”
He grabbed a copy of Men’s Fitness off of the cabinets and opened it up. Some fella that looked something like a cut-rate Thor was on the cover. He probably could have been related to Thor. Steve knew he wasn’t, but it was odd anyway. “Can the nanobots make guns for Bucky? Or arrows for Clint?”
Steve looked down at Clint, his brow furrowed. It seemed Bucky had finally told a lie too big. “You learn something new every day,” was the answer he settled on, and Bucky had to cover a snort of laughter with a sneeze.
Clint scoffed and turned the page, “that’s because you hit on fellas in the 30s like you didn’t care about going to prison. Steve wouldn’t know flirting if Tony stood naked in front of him and offered it up.” He turned to look back at Bucky, noticing for the first time that he hadn’t even been reading the stupid morlock report. On his chest was a copy of
Clint nodded, his eyes locked on Tony and Wanda throwing rainbow confetti at passersby. It was her first Pride as well, but she was handling it far better than Steve. And she was from a socialist disaster of a country.
“I’m his commanding officer. I get to visit when I want.” Steve leveled Bucky with a glare, crossing his arms over his chest. “What the fuck were you doing when Tony got hit with an EMP?”
“He lives in New York, Tony.” Steve burst into the room, walking right past the tangle on the couch. Clint couldn’t help but roll his eyes. It was getting annoying watching the pair of them argue about everything. “He doesn’t need to stay here.”
Bucky turned the page, his eyes scanning the words as though having a conversation didn’t affect his ability to comprehend what he was reading. It probably didn’t. “You’ve gotta go a week without eating pizza.”
Bucky rolled his eyes back. Tony was being a child. “Go to couple’s counseling then. Clint and I went once.”
Clint grinned brightly. “We’re gonna recreate the bad old days. Public indecency laws are lax during Pride. Buck’s gonna go down on me in that alley over there.” He cocked his thumb towards the nearest alleyway.
“FRIDAY isn’t hooked up to yours.” Steve knew that, and it was exactly the point. Tony needed to detox from all of the technology.
“Wade Wilson gets to stay the night here sometimes, I don’t think anything can be worse for ‘morale’ than Wade Wilson early in the morning.” Clint frowned, not wanting to be engaged in the argument longer than necessary. Part of him just wanted to tell the two idiots in front of him to piss off and go get it on. That was against the rules of the bet though. And that was more important than actually getting the pair of them to act like adults.
Bucky grinned and nodded his head. Exhibitionism made Clint happy, and making Clint happy made Bucky happy. Besides, it was somewhat thrilling knowing they could get caught. Especially if they weren’t going to go to jail in the end. “Clint’s into doing shit in public. He’s a performer at his core.”
“He fell two hundred feet for a stunt!” Steve crossed his arms over his chest and when Clint glanced back at him he looked every bit the petulant child Clint had expected. Tony had dropped two hundred feet to change suits, but no one other than Steve had gotten the impression it had been a stunt. Steve was being dramatic because Tony was involved.
Steve had spent years lying for Bucky so he could get off with strange men in alleys. He should have been used to it Bucky thought.
That wasn’t entirely accurate, Clint thought. They had been forced to go to a therapist in order to convince her their relationship wasn’t going to keep them from being effective at saving the world. They hadn’t had to attend more than one session because they’d been assembled, and Clint had made the responsible decision to save a child instead of Bucky after Bucky’d taken a knife to the neck.
“He’s done a mostly decent job of that himself. Even before you were in his life.” Clint turned the page and looked down at a picture of the standoff. It looked as boring as it sounded. “Other than, you know, getting captured by terrorists a couple of times. But who here hasn’t been captured by terrorists a couple of times?”
“Of course, we are!” Tony waved his chalk through the air, still not looking at Steve. Whatever he was making was more interesting than the smedium shirt Steve had picked out for the occasion. Tony liked his grey Nike shirts. “I make bets about everything our friends do. I had to outfit Clint’s entire apartment building with StarkTech after betting him that Bruce and Nat were going to get together before last Christmas.”
“So yeah, I get the appeal of a Stark. I was just smart enough to bag one, unlike other people in this room.” Bucky crossed his arms over his chest. Clint wasn’t certain if Bucky was telling the truth or if he was just trying to rile Steve up to win the bet. Appealing to Steve’s competitive side was a good method, Clint though.
Bucky stuck his tongue out and sat his hands on her thigh. He knew how things were as well. “Tony’s messing around with the wizard?”
I added an additional chapter because I had to suddenly vacate my house and haven't had much time for writing. But I got this done and wanted to add it.
Tony spun around to look at Steve, the frantic look in his eyes of a man running on caffeine and no sleep. He was stressing about letting the team die again. And likely creating something dangerous or pointless with the hope of protecting people. “I’m making nanobots that turn into uniforms.”  Pointless then. “That way no matter where you are you can become Captain America if someone needs it!”
“’Bucky and Clint said we should have a dance, I’m not much of a dancer.’ Fuck. He’s got no game.” Bucky whispered into Clint’s ear, doing his best to make sure Steve didn’t catch them. “Tony says, ‘don’t worry, it’s just about having a good time.’ I thought he was good at this shit.”
“That’s exactly what we’re gonna be doing.” Steve nodded, watching as Clint tried to burrow himself into Bucky’s side. “Talking.”
Bucky rolled his eyes but didn’t look up from his book. “You see the problem with that, Clint, is that you’d do anything I asked in bed because you’re a kinky shit.” Clint supposed that was true. There was very little Clint hadn’t done before he’d met Bucky. And Clint got the impression that Bucky hadn’t had the chance to get very creative before the war. “What do you want?”
“You should just let Tony be Tony.” Clint offered as Steve took Bucky’s book from him. Bucky hated it when people took things out of his hands, but he let Steve get away with it because of their weird co-dependent life-long bond. Steve had been able to free Bucky from decades of brainwashing. He supposed that earned some concessions.
Steve sighed. He needed to scold Bucky for snarking at Wade, but god Wade’s voice made him think about hanging himself even when he wasn’t saying meaningless things like that. Wade wasn’t even on the team, it would probably be fine to let it slide.
Clint waved lazily up at him. How he had become a spy, Steve would never know. “We’re gonna grab pizza from that place near our apartment tonight, want to join?” Bucky offered, reaching out to help Clint put his hand back by his side. He’d really gotten the good stuff.
“Stark is dicking around with nanotechnology.” Bucky told him, answering the questions Steve had before he could ask them. “It’s fuckin’ cool.” He pointed at a jar of swarming shiny things, “I don’t think in Howard’s wildest imaginations he ever would have dreamed this sort of stuff could exist.”
“Why’s that?” Bucky asked, leaning over to make eye contact with Clint. They’d been having a very important discussion about whether or not they would try something new for dinner. Bucky tried to use brainwashing to his benefit. (I have to learn what I like, Clint!) and Clint said they already knew what they liked. Bucky liked the chicken strip at the diner by their apartment that served the pizza Lucky liked.
It wasn’t worth it to correct Tony when he was revising history. At least when Howard was involved. Howard had been a touchy subject anyway since Steve had ratted Bucky out about sleeping with Howard anyway. Which had been wholly unnecessary and was just another symptom of Steve being stupid in love, Clint thought.
“Howard told me.” Bucky’s tone indicated that Steve should have been able to guess where he’d gotten the intel.
Steve sighed, his shoulders dropping slightly. He had never actively attempted to keep Bucky from getting laid as far as Bucky remembered. It didn’t seem he was going to start either. With a small smile he grabbed the replica shield Tony had made him (adamantium was so cool, Bucky thought) and reached behind him to attach it to the magnetized bracers.
“I only do massages. No happy endings.” Steve clarified, just in case the man was questioning Steve’s legitimacy. That got him a soft snort. Steve smiled in response.
“Can we set up a standing appointment?” She asked after a few minutes. “Tony, then me. My schedule is a little unpredictable, but I’m usually home at this time of night.”
Steve couldn't help but chuckle, sinking his elbow just a little deeper and following the tight muscle's course up towards Sam’s shoulder, shifting the muscle gently to give Sam relief.
“That works.” Tony said, amused. He stretched away from Steve and for a second Steve was confused until he heard a pump and realized Tony was getting some lube. Yes, what a great idea.
“Get the heaters set up. Keep him upright like this so we can have them in a circle around him. Make sure the drains are free and the heaters can’t fall into he puddles.” He decided. “We’ll thaw him out gently from all sides and lay him down when most of the ice is gone. Then we’ll bring him home in the morgue fridge.” Tony tried to tell himself that it was the best possible thing to do. Rationally, he knew it wasn’t. He knew there was a risk the serum might deteriorate in a dead body, but at the same time he couldn’t bring himself to leave the man frozen in ice any longer. He’d been lost for so long. He deserved to be found.
“I think I had best get him into bed and go home.” She said, yawning. “Thank you, Steve, that was wonderful.”
Later that night Steve found himself watching YouTube videos on his phone, different angles of that famous press conference playing on his screen. He watched as Stark sat down in exhaustion, his arm in a sling, hunching forward ever so slightly. There was something shaky about him, Steve read later that he’d come straight from the airport to the press conference.
“That’s not quite how this works, Mister Stark.” He said softly instead stroking his hands down the man’s back and feeling out the damage.
Was that normal? Did frozen corpses bleed when thawed? Tony didn’t know what to do. A part of him wanted to call for backup, to find some scientist or doctor on this ship who knew more about anatomy than Tony did. At the same time, he didn’t even want to imagine what people might say about him if he did this. If he implied to anyone that this body might not be dead, and he was wrong people would call him insane. Even worse, if he was right… who knew what would happen to Steve Rogers.
“I signed all the non-disclosure agreements. Whatever you need stays between us. And I’ve got really warm hands. I promise.” Steve tried when the man didn’t respond. He could see the indecision on Stark’s face.
“Oh, hell yeah!” Tony gasped, delighted as Steve drove his cock back into him, the force of it making him bounce off a few inches. Steve found his rhythm quickly, and Tony couldn’t help but keep his eyes open now, watching himself be moved by nothing, up and down, with Steve’s wonderful cock driving in and out of him in a steady, ever-increasing pace.
Now that he’d claimed his partner back though, in these peaceful surroundings with a blanket of calm that he’d never really felt before, rough was the last thing on his mind.
He worked down the sides of Stark’s neck and to his shoulders. The muscles there were tight, and Steve followed the tight muscles back over the edge of the shirt collar down his collarbones and-
“Stuff, huh?” Stark looked slightly amused, taking Steve in from top to bottom. There was a hesitance to him, but something else seemed to win out.
Steve stroked his palm over the tip, slick precum easing his way as he wrapped his hand around the top of Tony’s length, stroking it gently, his own hips shifting in response, his cock sliding between Tony’s legs.
He turned to face Miss Potts. In her heels, she wasn’t much shorter than Steve. Her long hair was in a sleek knot and the dress she wore made it clear that she’d come straight from work.
Tony smiled to himself, opening his eyes to look up at where he thought Steve’s eyes had to be. “Distract me, hm? Well, you’ve got all the usual ingredients here… you… naked…” He chuckled, starting to relax a little. “I guess it’s not every day we get to try something new?” He mused, leaning up, though this time Steve met him with an eager kiss right away, pulling Tony closer.
Office day gigs had been a blessing, Steve had been able to make a steady income with them when he'd first started out. A company would book him for the day and put up a base fee. Then the employees could book his services for allocated timeslots throughout the day to make up his full fee. It worked great, so long as people booked him for most of the day. If they didn't, Steve had to sit in his little room with his table all day, playing on his phone.
The fact that they’d been fucking less than three hours ago when the call had come was almost unfathomable a minute ago. So much had happened, but now, with Steve’s other hand sliding into the back of his jeans, he sure remembered what they’d been interrupted doing earlier.
The implications of someone missing a chunk of bone in such a delicate area where so many muscles converged and ran all through the chest, abdomen and up to the arms and neck. It was inconceivable. The man had to be in a horrendous amount of pain. An injury like that would skew everything. If Tony was only getting help with it now… well, Steve had already felt some of the damage.
“I told Pepper; I don’t want this.” Stark said quietly where he stood at the entrance to the corridor, looking at Steve with something bordering on mistrust. He seemed ready to bail. “You can pack up and go, you’ll be paid for your time on your way out.”
“We can definitely do that.” Steve promised turning around when she stopped moving and finding her perfectly ready for him. She knew the drill.
“Tony, I don’t want you to do that, especially not because you’re scared. I’m not going to do anything that you don’t want me to do.” He repeated. “That includes tattling your business to other interested parties, no matter what they put on the table.” He assured him. “Your body and everything we do here, that’s not up for discussion or sale with anyone else. I promise. I wouldn’t.” Steve told him softly, holding the man’s gaze. “Please tell me what’s hurting you so I can help you properly.” He said, having long understood that he wasn’t given insight into the true root of all that ailed Tony.
“Hello Steve. I’m glad you could squeeze us in.” She said, taking off her shoes and suit jacket to sit down on the sofa.
“No worries at all. Miss Potts already booked me again for the same time next week, if that works for you.” Steve said, not mentioning that it sounded like he’d been booked for the foreseeable future.
“Okay, we can work on that. Do you want to stay sitting up?” Steve asked, glad that he hadn’t been sent away. He didn’t move, didn’t reach out, not until Stark turned to face away from Steve in a silent agreement.
Steve didn’t hold back, the sheer sight of watching Tony come undone by just his hand was enough to drive him to orgasm. He came between Tony’s legs, holding his partner tightly through it, his face pressed against Tony’s skin panting desperately.
Sam had soft music playing, nothing like the meditation style music they put on for treatments, but something slow and vaguely cheery. Steve didn't recognize the band, but he enjoyed the melodies. They let him sink into a deeply contemplative mindset.
So far three separate scientists had attempted to email funding bodies and the military, but JARVIS had blocked the outgoing transmissions. Tony really needed a plan.
“It glows, through clothes.” Tony elaborated, still tense. “And I can’t have you seeing this in detail.” He added. Steve nodded, understanding. The tape was for him.
He let Tony direct the way down towards the door that led down to the beach, carrying his partner into the water where the ocean washed away the evidence of their morning together.
He set to work again, focusing on Stark’s neck. Laying down and stretched out as he was, Steve could feel much more and treat Stark's tight muscles with more precision. He turned the man’s head this way and that, cradling his head with one hand while working on the opposite side of the neck. After some time he gently rolled Stark’s head into his other hand and did the same for his other side.
“Sir, with all due respect, I’m already here now. I’d be happy to help you with anything at all.” It was abundantly clear from his slouch that the man was in pain. There was something tense about him. Steve could tell from his posture that it had once been good, but Stark now found it hard to hold himself up straight. It had only been a year or so since his temporary disappearance, but the time had aged him rapidly. There was grey in his hair and his skin looked pasty in a way that spoke of a life lived inside.
“Yeah, that’s her.” Tony said. “Can we just… let’s wait a minute until she’s here.” He decided and Steve nodded. “Sure thing.”
Miss Potts had watched too, smiling fondly. “If I look like this after you’re done with me, the pleasure will have been all mine.” She assured him and Steve smile, appreciating her warm tone. He wasn’t sure if the two of them were a couple or just very close, but she seemed comfortable with Stark hanging around during her treatment, so Steve didn’t say a word about it. Instead, he busied himself with changing the towels for her.
“I don’t think me being here is a very good idea,” she settled with finally, keeping her eyes trained ahead of her even when Coulson glanced at her. “Thank you for getting me away.”
Sometimes, Bruce still wondered how that interaction had worked out in her favour, but he was endlessly grateful for it. He knew with certainty that he wouldn’t have ever forgiven himself or the Hulk if he’d attacked Toni.
With great difficulty, she took her thoughts away from the little boy that she’d left at home and focused on the one she was cradling right now. The one who had a family to get back to. A mother to get back to, a mother that was being forced to pray for someone else to bring her child back to her when she was helpless on the sidelines.
Steve took a deep breath. He had really been hoping beyond all hope that he would catch Tony alone. With their stupid bet on he couldn’t property greet his boyfriend in front of others. That would be cheating. “Good afternoon, Peter.” He glanced over at Bucky, “hey Buck.”
“Isn’t he kinda cute when he’s riled up though?” Clint asked, glancing over to see Tony opening the panels on Bucky’s wrist. That seemed unnecessary, but Tony had a hardon for the arm so…
Tony leaned into Steve’s side, flashing a peace sign for a passing camera. That would get attention online. Hopefully Steve didn’t look like an idiot. “If they don’t figure it out today, let’s just tell them?” Clint offered, watching as the two separated again.
And so when Steve walked into Tony’s lab to check on the status of the new uniform he apparently needed, he was not surprised to see Peter Parker standing on the ceiling and Deadpool lying on one of Tony’s tables. He was equally unsurprised to hear Peter Parker rambling about old ladies giving him and Wade snacks. The surprise was seeing Bucky lounging in a desk chair, with no Clint in sight.
Bucky shook his head. He did not, in fact, remember that ever happening.  He did remember the police having wooden clubs they used to terrorize people, but that was it. “Try to enjoy yourself. Tony said it’s the biggest party of the year.
“Myanmar, with Nat. He didn’t get me any details.” That was abnormal. It must have been something more secret than normal. “I’m just hanging out here until he gets home.”
“That doesn’t even count as a vote then.” Tony rolled his eyes, clearly getting more agitated as the conversation continued.
Bet? Steve looked back up just in time to see Tony step up on his stepstool. He was wearing the tight jeans today, it was a good day. Steve would see if he could get Tony out of the jeans before Tony got too involved in whatever he was designing. If he let Tony fall down the rabbit hole, then he wasn’t going to see his boyfriend for at least a week.
Bucky’s lips curled and he rolled his eyes. “Thanks Wade. As always, you’ve shined a light on the situation.”
Steve watched Bucky help Clint down onto the couch. Barton really needed to be in the medical ward, but apparently the two of them thought they knew better than the trained medical professionals. Steve was fairly certain Bucky had been smarter than that in 1942.
Clint snorted and leaned back in his wheelchair. It was nice not having to walk. “He’s too busy being a baby about you getting a booboo.”
Bucky narrowed his eyes, eyeing Steve suspiciously. Good Bucky was getting the hint. “I have to go call Clinton.” He stood up and rushed out the door.
“Sometimes I rag on Clint for using trick arrows instead of real ones when we fight Hydra.” Bucky jolted forward and frowned at Tony. He snatched the tool out of Tony’s hand and pulled it out of his hand. “Watch what you’re doing man. I can feel this shit.
Bucky let his metal arm slip off of the couch and brush against Clint’s exposed ankle. Clint hummed contentedly. He didn’t understand the science, and didn’t care much about it either – fuckin Nazis – but he knew the metal limb somehow stayed warm. “If they do, my money’s on Tony.” He turned the page again.
“Fuck, he’s dumb. I think the ice turned him stupid.” Bucky turned around and dropped back into his chair. His locked eyes with Clint and smiled at him. “He never had any game though.”
They all glanced over to see Tony taking photographs with scantily clad men, a huge smile on his face. It had taken all of Pepper’s skill to keep Tony from using the Iron Man suit to launch confetti over the crowd. Bucky’d really wanted to see that though.
“Nah,” he stared down at the printed words, “Steve’s got that old timey wimey brain. He won’t make a move, he doesn’t even know they’re flirting.” He couldn’t guarantee that, but he’d seen how surprised Steve was about any sort of homosexual behavior performed openly.
Steve thought that was a bit rich coming from Tony, considering the number of times he hadn’t died in the past. For which Steve was grateful.
“What are you putting down for the bet then?” He asked, looking at Tony’s shoulders as they flexed against his tank top. Shit, he was good looking. Steve hadn’t even known he held interest in men until he’d met Tony. So that had been a shock.
Bucky wheeled him out of the room, turning down the hallway. No one was going to stop the Winter Soldier from going where he wanted, even if he had an injured patient with him. It was a great benefit of dating Bucky. He got away with twice as much as he had before he’d gotten himself a super assassin.
Bucky snorted. “Steve isn’t with Wilson.” Good, Clint thought. Bucky wasn’t dedicated to the bet enough to let people think Steve was sleeping with Sam.
Clint wanted to pat Bucky on the back, but his body hurt so he stayed still. He turned his focus to Steve to see what he reaction would be to Bucky’s words. They didn’t talk about Tony’s problems as a principal, and Steve liked to pretend Hydra wasn’t still floating around in Bucky’s brain. Steve’s greatest skill was staying in denial against all evidence, Bucky had told him. That seemed in line with everything Clint knew about the man.
Tony looked up from his work again, confusion written all over his face. He, apparently, didn’t know who Wonder Woman was either. If this wasn’t more of Wade’s shit, they probably needed to meet her. The team could always use more strong women.
“Even our scientists are less intelligent than the ones in my day.” It would be more than enough to set Tony off and get him to forget their ridiculous bet in an attempt to prove he was better than Howard. He brought his magazine up again, rereading the section on cleaning mufflers.
“That’s probably way more illegal.” Clint agreed, leaning in to press a kiss against Bucky’s cheek. “I think Tony would really like your company. Here at Pride. You two could have a dance. It wouldn’t even be a big deal. It’s Pride.”
“We had to steal a pencil to write that contract.” Bucky told Natasha, as though the traitor actually remembered writing it, “That makes it extra binding.” He shrugged his shoulders, “Steve shouldn’t have to share Tony if he doesn’t want to anyway.”
“There’s no way for us to know when aliens are going to attack, Steven.” Bucky answered for Tony, eyeing Tony with a hint of nervousness. A frantic Tony could be a dangerous Tony. Instant Kill Mode had been a frantic Tony decision. “You could be walking around Central Park,” Steve didn’t bother to tell Bucky that he never just walked around Central Park, “and a portal opens up and Loki or some shit falls out.”
“Like the time Tony froze up because of his PTSD and I got taken back by Hydra?” Bucky shot back, leaning back against Clint’s medical bed. “Or the time I got activated and shot you and Thor?”
“Why’s Steve care what Tony does?” Clint asked her, leaning back on the couch. The conversation about dinner was going to have to be couched. It was fine. They would go to the tasty diner and Bucky could try something new. Like a casserole or something. That was old timey.
Clint rolled onto his back so he could fully appreciate Bucky’s relaxed form. He could cut steel with that fucking jaw. It was perfect to sit on as well. And those muscles. Clint groaned appreciatively just looking at Bucky’s chest muscles through his black tank top. “What?”
Bucky took his book back from Steve, “Clint’s been captured so many times I can’t even count them. It’s his modus operandi.”
Clint glanced over and smiled at Steve, “go play with Tony. He’ll show you how to have a good time.” At the very least, Bucky thought, Tony’s antics would distract Steve from the discomfort. The last thing they needed was someone posting an article about Steve being uncomfortable around gays. The United States government has wiped out any record of the week Steve had spent in jail for attacking a man with a crowbar after seeing him punch a man coming out of a gay bar.
“There’s a rage monster, three assassins, and me on the team. There’s gonna be death.” Tony brought the conversation back to Steve in a way that impressed even Clint. That meant he was really fired up. This was a chance for Clint to try and nudge the odds in his favor though, so he supported it. “I’m not putting rubber bullets in the suit.”
Tony shrugged. It was probably just another one of Tony’s attempts to hold Clint’s life together and keep him from dying. Bucky hadn’t exactly improved the actual status of Clint’s wellbeing if Steve was honest. Clint had fallen ten floors only the week before. He’d escaped the hospital despite his ruptured spleen and all of the broken ribs. Bucky was nursing him back to health.
While his attention was on Wanda, Clint let out a soft gasp. He pointed towards Steve and Tony. Bucky turned his gaze back to their friends and saw that Steve had wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulder.
Fortunately for Clint, though, the shoulder had remained closed this time. They were working with the fingers. Which made sense, Clint had overheard him telling Steve that one of his fingers was moving of its own accord. Not a great thing for a sniper.
It wasn’t like Bucky had been thrilled when he’d had to stick his finger in Clint’s chest when he’d been shot.)
Clint could nearly feel the righteous indignation radiating off of Steve before the man said anything. “That is inappropriate!”
“Tony Stark apparently needs it if he talks about himself in the third person…” Clint mumbled, but knew he needed to let it drop. So he did.
“Stole it from Clint.” He lied. A piss poor lie, Clint thought. No one would believe Clint was intelligent enough to be reading a book like that in French. He had them all convinced he was an idiot. Except for Natasha, and she knew he’d never waste his time reading children’s tale’s like that.
Peter between the two men and then over at Wade, who shrugged his shoulders. They probably weren’t privy to the issue there. They weren’t exactly out publicizing it.
“You think they’re gonna figure it out?” Clint asked, turning the page of his mission report. It made the tower happy to think he was reading the files that were given to him. Someone, somewhere, apparently put effort into creating them, and it was only polite to read them.
Though it had taken him close to two weeks to convince Steve that he and Toni weren’t involved romantically, it was still one of his favourite memories of the genius. It reminded him that despite his own insecurities, there was always at least one person in the world who would always stick with him and who saw him as the best version of himself. It reminded him that there was one person in the world who’d carved out a place for him as family and who loved every part of him without reservation and without qualifiers.
he confirmed, and Nat closed her eyes for the briefest moment, letting the relief flood through her veins.
As she spoke, Toni undid the top two buttons of her shirt. What might have aroused Steve in any other instance, now made him tense slightly in unease, so fearful was he that Toni would tell him there was no way to make her better.
Lips caught his sweetly, placing perfunctory kisses meant more to calm than arouse. “Love you, doll,” Steve murmured back, against his lips. “Love you so damn much.”
Without thinking about it, Steve shook his head. “You’re never harmless,” he refuted, thinking of how strong and resourceful the genius was. “Not really.”
As it were, however, the only thing that mattered was the fact that Steve was in trouble because of him.
“You need to get checked by the medics, sweetheart,” he said, and it hit him like a gut-punch when Toni only nodded resignedly rather than arguing.
“Of course, Madam,” JARVIS chimed back immediately, and Toni knew she’d done well programming him, but damn if he actually sounded haughty as he turned her playlist on at low volume.
And yes, that was in capital letters, because for as many flaws as she’d had, Maria Stark had always been there for her daughter and was one of a select three people upon whom Toni could count. In doing so, she had instilled a deep appreciation in Toni for the strength, resilience and love of a mother, and in the lifetime that followed, Toni never showed anything but the utmost respect to mothers in general. Mothers – the ones who did their jobs with love – were amazing and wonderful creatures, the truest miracle even in a world that had superheroes.
Had it been anyone else, Steve might have bristled with irritation, but he knew for a fact that Bucky loved Toni; granted, it was in a vastly different way to him, thank God for that, but he cared about the genius as much as he cared about Steve or any of his family.
The super soldier kissed his lover sloppily, skating his tongue soothingly across that abused bottom lip before he pulled away. “S’okay, sweetheart,” he coaxed, “let go for me. I wanna see you lose it, I wanna watch you come for me.”
Unfortunately, that little stunt hadn’t been enough for Tony to kick the has-been to the curb. Two days later had taken the pair to a fancy dinner at some Greek place, followed by 80s night at a club.
She didn’t understand the whole issue, anyway. Peter had no problem calling everyone else by their names – Steve himself, who had been fathering that kid harder than Toni had ever known anyone to father, was no more or less than
Well. He could, but Toni would probably have been pissed if he did. Fury, too, probably, but Steve didn’t care one way or the other about that.
“They want you, Mr. Stark,” he answered crisply, without tact or care. “We can’t be certain, but based on their demand, these men are not among The Captain’s enemies, as they require your unique skill set and are willing to trade that, in exchange for The Captain’s life.”
Steve had been the one who’d helped him integrate into society, but Toni had been the one who’d given him a part in their
It honestly couldn’t have been done sooner. The delays on her suit had caused her to be benched for the recon mission that the team was currently in the middle of, and though she might have stayed behind anyway, in order to be home for Peter, it still got under her skin that it had taken her this long. The Mach-11 would’ve been sufficient for any attacks on the city, but Toni was personally offended at the thought of being on the field with outdated gear. She’d always taken personal pride in making sure that everything the Avengers used was the top of the line in their respective categories, and it would have been positively abhorrent to lower that standard with her own armour.
“You drive me crazy,” Steve bit off, but there was too much raw need in his eyes for her to take offense. “You’re so goddamn perfect, Toni. So fucking amazing. I’d give you anything, baby. Everything.”
“Don’t worry,” Steve told her as he crossed the distance, voice still rough from sleep. “I’m pretty sure JARVIS is doing most of the piloting.”
“There’s no oxygen supply,” Rogers told him in a low voice, and it was telling of how much Rhodes was putting aside that he didn’t immediately snap at the Captain for answering a question he’d directed at Toni (Rhodey took his rivalries very seriously.) “The suit has an emergency supply, but…”
Insincere or not, it was apparently enough for Stark. “I forgot about it when I saw that Erskine had taken the hit,” she told him brusquely, and if he hadn’t seen her nearly destroyed with grief earlier, he might have mistaken the tone for heartlessness. As it were, he realized now that it was simply a defense mechanism of hers; not that he knew exactly what she was so defensive against. “Get me the kit in my nightstand, will you?” she asked as she tied the ends of her blouse into a knot at her sternum.
she replied mildly, and Toni smiled at the typically sharp voice meant to push her into action. No last words for Natasha Romanoff.
Smug smile lifting her features, she leaned back against the desk. “J, Workshop Number Three, suitable for company, if you will,” she spoke pleasantly, not bothering to raise her voice or make any effort to direct her AI towards what she wanted of him.
So. They weren’t dating, and judging from Tony’s hands in his, the genius wasn’t as over Steve as he claimed to be. That, the blond translated, meant he wasn’t too late. He hadn’t missed his shot and there was still a chance to claim what was rightfully his. His, and not meant for anyone else.
Except maybe, sometimes even geniuses were wrong, because as much as she had believed herself totally unsuited to the monumental task of being a mom, Peter never had. The little boy hadn’t entertained the thought for a single second, that she was unable to be what he needed her to be.
Unaware of Steve’s blood running colder in his veins, Tony continued to speak. “I did everything he wanted, even when I didn’t want to, because all I wanted was for him to look at me, just once, and actually see me. Me as I was, not just as his goddamn succession plan. He never did, and I never got the chance to try one more time.” As he spoke, Tony inched forward, but for all that the words were meant to be a distraction, Steve knew that there was truth in them. They were too raw not to be.
Because it was easier to talk like this, Steve kept the other man in his arms. “I’m sorry,” he repeated in a low murmur, his eyes falling shut as he fairly nuzzled Tony’s temple. It was like he couldn’t help himself, now that he was close enough to touch, now that he
“Well, for the sake of that, and for the safety of my best friend.” Overhead, the mechanized voice of Lieutenant Colonel James “Rhodey” Rhodes drifted over them, sounding distinctly unimpressed in a way that raised Steve’s hackles. Although, to be fair, there was plenty about the man himself that did that anyway, mostly because of the rocky footing they always seemed to be on.
Thor couldn’t help echoing a hint of Loki’s bitterness as he replied, “Father has forbidden the interference of Asgard in any mortal affairs.”
Steve felt guilt wash over him when he realized how broody he’d been throughout their whole conversation. It wasn’t Tony’s fault that he’d eavesdropped and it definitely wasn’t fair to punish him for something that Steve wasn’t even meant to know. Although why he wasn’t meant to know was anyone’s guess… why hadn’t Tony just come to him and admitted his feelings?
And as much as Toni had called him a sap, it hadn’t stopped her from getting a button designed to look like his shield, and stashing it in one of the armor’s hidden hollow panels.
It had taken Steve months of diligent and patient reminding to get her to accept that, and still, Toni had her off days, but over the years, her boyfriend had given her the most priceless gift of understanding. He’d been steady as a rock whenever she’d found the courage to reach for him and caught her when she didn’t, and ended up taking a proverbial tumble because of it.
Eventually, the pair dragged themselves out of bed, showering separately in the interests (Steve’s interests) of making it to their meeting before dusk. They were both fairly relaxed, if a little petulant in Toni’s case, for having to come out on their day off, and perhaps that should have been the first indicator to the billionaire that today was going to be a crappy day.
Judging from the irritable flash over the attorney’s face, Rumlow had already covered this part while Tony had been trying to process.
When the little kid had walked into the kitchen this morning, half-asleep and knuckling at bleary eyes, Steve had been braced for tears from a fresh nightmare and a wobbly demand for Toni. Peter still had nightmares of what little he had seen in the attack on his family ten months ago, and the only person he wanted or could stand after those, was Toni herself. He’d cling to her and refuse to look at, or even acknowledge anyone else, and for her part, the beautiful billionaire would simply put down whatever it was that she was doing, whenever and wherever she was doing it, and bundle Peter up in her arms, humming and rocking him until he calmed.
Hey y'all! So sorry for the super late update, but this chapter just didn't want to cooperate with me! I think Toni just didn't want it to be finished, but alas! Here it is, and this is the end! What started off as something I didn't think would exceed 20k works, became this 84k+ monster that I absolutely thrilled in navigating. I hope you guys did, too!
Dragging in a deep breath, the Thunder God watched as the sky lit up with a few bolts of lightning, reacting to his tumultuous emotions. “You had better be well, Toni,” he murmured, as if he could hope for the words to reach her ears somehow. “Valhalla is not ready for the Woman of Iron yet.”
As he watched, Toni bent low to press a kiss to the child’s forehead. “We’ll see about that, sweet pea,” she murmured softly, pushing Peter’s hair back in gentle strokes meant to sooth him into sleep. Not for the first time, Steve shook his head in amusement at the nickname Toni only used when Peter needed comforting or reassurance. It had become a thing between the little boy and the genius; Peter loved it, because his name started with a ‘P’, and Toni indulged it, probably because as much as she denied it, she loved the kid more than any of them could.
The words made her throat constrict slightly, and it was only through vicious self-control that she didn’t throw herself at him in a hug. Instead, she nodded mutely, clumsily patting the hand that was now wrapped around her elbow.
Refocusing on Steve, Toni took her argument back up. “I’m not going to sit in a hospital just so that they can tell me I was lucky, and I need to take it easy for a while.”
Her eyes were weary when she lifted them to his, something that made Steve’s chest clench unpleasantly. “Do you know how many people consider me worthy to continue the Stark legacy? To take my place at the helm of the company?” Steve’s temper flared, because he could guess the answer, but he stayed quiet, sensing that Toni didn’t need an answer so much as a listening ear. “One,” she told him with a small laugh, but the sound was all wrong. It was bitter and hurt and resigned in a way that Toni should never sound in her entire life. “Peggy Carter. She’s the only one, now that Dr. Erskine is gone, who thinks that I’ll be able to handle it. Most people stick to the normal ways of expressing their disapproval of me; hushed whispers with pointed glares, talking over me when I make a suggestion, that sort of thing. My dad’s old partner, though… he got a bit creative.”
Steve didn’t hear much over the roaring of his blood in his ears, but suddenly, there were six SHIELD agents holding him back while Howard laid curled on the floor again, this time clutching an abdomen that, no doubt, housed broken ribs. The only thing Steve could bring himself to feel was fierce regret that he’d only managed to land one punch, except, had this been what had set Toni off? Had he protected the wrong person?
“Toni?” Her name left his lips in an incredulous, worried sounding tone, and as she whirled around to look at him, the motion seemed to trigger a bout of dizziness. Steve shot forward the moment he saw her eyes roll to the back of her head – a more terrifying sight he’d yet to see, and he was on the frontlines of war – and just barely managed to get his arms around her so that she didn’t hit the floor as she fell. “Christ, Toni, fuck, c’mon sweetheart,” he muttered mindlessly, fear making him go cold all over as he brushed back hair from her face and tried to gently tap her cheek and get her back into wakefulness. “Show me those pretty brown eyes, would ya darlin’?” he pleaded softly, trying to push past his panic to get to reason.
“Tony was carryin’ a torch for ya,” he nodded, as if it were the easiest thing in the world. Before Steve could ask him why, Bucky kept on talking. “Are you into him?”
She closed her eyes against it for a second, trying to push past the pain of the words long enough to make an escape. A little sob, followed by arms clutching at her legs, reminded her that she wasn’t the only one who needed out, and after glancing down at Peter, Toni made the executive decision to get herself and her son out of there.
Swallowing twice, she managed to keep the sorrow out of her voice. “Hey, sweet pea. What’s with the tears?”
The relief almost crippled him when Bucky produced a long-range flashlight (from where, Steve would never know) and pointed it into the inky expanse, to finally shine on Toni some-100 feet below them.
“That’s her choice, Steve,” Bucky said lightly, pointedly vesting himself of Steve’s grip around his wrist. “And as best I can tell, she’s still a free agent and therefore, completely fair game.”
And damn if her hurt didn’t suddenly ease away, replaced with deep sympathy for the pain that she’d never wanted her lover to feel. No matter how she felt, she’d never wanted him to deal with this.
Through the roaring in his ears, Steve no more heard Pepper’s next words, than he did hear the crack of his knees against the floor as his legs gave out from underneath him.
“Just like that,” she affirmed softly, quick fingers already stripping wires and trying to salvage what she could from the damage that had been sustained to the suit.
“And just what the fuck is your problem?” he snarled aggressively, not really caring that he now knew Barnes to be a lethal enforcer and Steve’s SIC in this mob business of theirs. “Why the fuck are you just laying down and dying? He’s your best fucking friend, stop looking at me like he’s already dead!” The last word left his mouth weakly, as though he couldn’t even bring himself to say it, which wasn’t totally inaccurate. His fury at these people were just outweighing the panic and dread, at the moment, because forget Rumlow, Barnes was Steve’s best friend. Barnes and Tony had never gotten along because of it, because the ex-soldier could see just how unworthy Tony was of Steve, even when the blond didn’t quite see it himself, and he was protective enough to hate Tony for being selfish enough to stay even when he knew Steve deserved better. But where was that protectiveness now? Why the hell was he just standing there like saving Steve – and the way to do so – wasn’t literally written in black and fucking white?! The money wasn’t an issue, and sending Tony was a no-fucking-brainer.
Toni could hear the aggrieved voice of one Nick Fury as he ranted to Steve, something about HYDRA and time warps and
He hung up the phone with a faint smile on his face, preparing himself to go back downstairs and deal with whatever was waiting for him there. Clint refused to believe that it would be anything less than his little sister’s full recovery; because if he didn’t believe in her now, how the hell was she meant to believe in herself? Maybe she wouldn’t know or give a damn about how he felt just then, but that didn’t give him any excuse not to have faith in her.
As elusive as her own misgivings had been in her mind, a thought suddenly struck Toni with all the force of a nuclear missile; and she would know. All at once, she wondered why it had taken her this long to realize what should have been devastatingly clear from the start.
“I know,” she replied with a smile, and he could see in her eyes that she believed him. It was enough, for now. “I love you too.” Flicking her head at the bike, she tugged him lightly towards it. “Let’s go home.”
Gradually, Tony’s tears abated, soothed as he was by the kisses and gently comforting words. With a tenderness that wasn’t out of place on the blond, Steve herded Tony towards the bed, laying him down carefully and stretching out immediately beside him, torn, bloody clothes and all.
“Ancient history,” he parroted back to her, and was rewarded with a dazzling smile. “Thank you, by the way, for what you did today.” Joking aside, Steve really did appreciate everything the genius had done to help, and he was loathe to let another moment pass without telling her as much. “For giving up your designs to your dad, and then giving me backup with your armor prototype. For all of it.”
Laura had been the first real interlude for him, on this general path of pain. She’d challenged him, fulfilled him, and introduced him to a whole new aspect of life, and himself, that he hadn’t even realized he’d been missing. For the first time in his life, Clint had smiled; not because it was what was expected of him, and not because the mission required him to, but because he’d been helpless not to do it. The swell of joy and affection as he’d looked upon the woman he knew had stolen his heart, had been far too powerful not to show. Gradually, and without him noticing, Laura had changed him… made him a far better man just by being the amazing woman she was, and Clint would have gone through all the pain, anger, loss and regret ten times over if it meant that it would always lead straight back to her.
And one of the things that she loved most about Steve, was his ability to recognize when she was nearing the end of her tether. He was the only one that she felt safe and comfortable enough with, to let her guard down and expose the cracks in her metaphorical armor, and he took that honor seriously by always somehow knowing just when she needed a boost or a shoulder.
“Who told you that?” the kid asked, and suddenly, his voice was small and so very young. “I mean… is it from a book or something, or just something you learned?”
The bruising grip had made her want to purr in happiness. She loved Steve’s marks on her, especially the ones he made with the specific intention of claiming her as his, and while she’d been healing, he’d been so achingly gentle in everything. It had been appreciated, while she’d been on the mend, but now? She wanted nothing more than to feel the power of that restrained strength. She wanted Steve, without fear and without reservation.
Steve should have known that she would come. Palladium poisoning or not, she was always there when he needed her the most.
, because apparently Stark could inspire hope in even his cynical brother, “be sure and tell her that I am greatly unamused by her heroics at the best of times, and this certainly wasn’t that.”
Before he could offer up any protest or reassure Tony that he didn’t need to do this, the man had his pants and boxers around his knees and was taking him down in one swallow. Steve made an inhuman sound at the back of his throat, snapping his hips forward instinctively and then apologizing profusely when it made Tony rear back slightly.
As she spoke, Toni wasn’t unaware of Maico’s eyelids drooping. It amazed her at first, that he could relax long enough to sleep, but after taking into account his age, combined with fear, an adrenaline crash and the draining, muggy heat, it almost made sense that the child would succumb to fatigue. At any rate, it was a good thing, because asleep, Maico couldn’t panic if the effects of oxygen deprivation started to kick in, and thereby worsen their situation unknowingly.
Whether it was the teasing brushes against his erection or her entreating words, Toni couldn’t have said for certain, but it didn’t matter when Steve flipped their positions around without warning, caging her against his chest so that she wasn’t jostled too badly when he pinned her to the bed.
“He convinced my dad to send me with one of the regiments that were doing recon,” she continued, resting her own arms atop his. “Howard was supposed to go, he was meant to provide them with their tech, but Obadiah… I thought he was giving me a chance to prove myself,” she shook her head, obviously still irate with herself. “I was grateful. I was an idiot.” The words were spoken briskly, as if she were already decided in her harsh assessment of herself. Before Steve could argue, she continued talking, eyes fixed on a spot at his shoulder, downcast and reserved. Steve hated it. “He’d sold us all out to the enemy camp on the condition that they kill me. They used one of the missiles that I… I helped
“You should be,” Rhodes replied a little roughly, and Toni didn’t take the tone personally. In all the time they’d known each other, it was old news to the genius that Rhodey didn’t deal well with being afraid, especially when he was afraid for someone else. Case in point, when his mother had been ill, or the stories of what a nightmare he’d become in the months that Toni had been missing in Afghanistan. It was, she knew, Rhodey’s biggest fear that something would happen to someone he loved, and he would be powerless to stop it. “When Pepper called me… I’ve only had that feeling a handful of times before in my life, Tones,” he said frankly, and there was unabashed pain in his eyes when he shifted to look at her. “Hated it every damn time.”
“So,” Steve shifted to face her again, so he wouldn’t get a crick in his neck, “are you going to present the armor? Try and make it standard issue? I’d say the prototype had a successful test run.”
“To get yourself a ride home,” Tony interrupted, letting his temper flare brightly one more time. Belligerently, he lifted his chin a fraction as Steve turned his supposedly fearsome glare on him. It might have even been effective if Tony had never seen him sleep-mussed and cuddling the inventor like his personal plush toy. “I’m commandeering one of your rides and I’m not real interested in having a passenger.”
“I am not permitted to say.” If it was possible – and with Toni, Steve didn’t doubt that it was – the AI actually sounded cold. There was an impersonal edge to his normally warm and friendly voice that made Steve feel like a hostile, and of course the AI would have become sentient to Toni. Steve hadn’t met anyone who knew the real Toni, who didn’t fall in love with her, so why should a robot be the exception?
Toni had no more than straightened before Steve was there, and instead of helping her up, he simply hooked an arm underneath her knees, and another around her shoulders, and lifted her gently into a bridal carry. Normally, Toni would’ve protested everything about the action – very loudly and vehemently at that – but tonight, sensing as she did that Steve needed it as much as she might have, the genius only looped her arms around his neck and laid her head against his shoulder.
Like it always did, Steve’s heart warmed at the address, thawing away some of the ice that seemed to be encroaching on it since hearing about Toni. “Hey, buddy,” he greeted gently, his entire tone and demeanour changing from what it had been while talking to his best friend. “You looking after Uncle Clint for us?”
And so they had. Steve had come next, quickly growing weary of his own attempts to recover parts of the past that he still couldn’t let go of. He had shown up in the Tower without giving a thought as to what he was doing there, with a duffle bag and no idea what the reception would be. As it were, Toni had given him little more than a fleeting grin before throwing the proverbial doors wide open and casually directing JARVIS to show Steve to his floor. He had been amazed at the knowledge that Toni had designed an apartment for each of them, on their own floors, and before he could thank her, or try to make amends for the horrible first impressions they’d made on each other, she was giving him an access card that would allow him anywhere in the building, along with a Starkphone, a computer and a vague comment about teaching him how to use both sometime. It was during those lessons, Steve knew, that he’d begun to fall in love with the haphazard genius… but that was a story for another time.
Toni had tried to tell herself that it was simply her overprotective instincts; though rarely shown, they were keenly felt, and it was usually enough for her to be there but this time, she was holding down the fort at the tower and the rest of the team was on the field. It was only natural for her to feel anxious until she knew that they were safe again… but she couldn’t shake the feeling that this was something
She touched her lips to his once; twice. “I’d fight the whole universe for you,” she promised quietly, and it rang with raw truth. “There’s nothing I wouldn’t do to get back to you, to Peter. To come back home.”
Sure enough, Steve’s low voice, amused and fond, confirmed her thoughts a second later. “Sure you can, buddy, just as soon as we put the food on the nightstand so it won’t fall.”
“I’m just saying,” Howard continued, seemingly unaware of Steve’s disapproval, “that you don’t need to shield me. I always knew she would be my biggest disappointment, but I guess not everyone can bat a thousand with their creations.”
Before he could say anything; offer any comfort; the genius tipped her glass at him again. “To Mrs. Rogers,” she said softly, and rather than take a drink, Toni tossed the remainder of the alcohol into the little pot plant that formed some of the sparse decoration in the room.
Somehow, the fact that his backup was batshit insane served as a comfort to the soldier. Reminded him a bit of Toni, to be honest, and it would make sense that she’d need someone as off the reservation as she was to agree to test out her new weapon.
“Yeah, well, you were right,” he conceded with a small shrug, following her lead and taking a seat when she did. At her raised eyebrow, he elaborated, “Erskine gave me the serum with the faith that I would do a lot more than… what was it?” he asked, smile growing teasingly. “Dance around in a Halloween costume like America’s new boy toy?”
“…park tomorrow too? And maybe Steve can come also?” Peter was asking, his words slurred with tiredness as Toni pulled the covers over him. The super soldier felt his lips lift in a broader smile, feeling an inordinate amount of affection for the child that Toni had brought into their home and lives.
God help her, but Toni was tempted to. Ever since MIT, whenever Rhodey had left to go somewhere, be it back home to check on his mother, or to some get-together Toni hadn’t been up for, or after they’d graduated, whenever he’d shipped out anywhere, Rhodey would ask Toni to say the word:
“Couldn’t let him hurt you,” Tony answered without preamble, as if the words came easy as breathing to him. Steve flicked his gaze from the sky to Tony, but his companion pointedly kept his eyes facing forward. “The only way to get him away from you was to get him to listen, and the only way he would listen to me was if he thought I was harmless.”
The voice over the comms was hesitant in a way that all of them recognized. It meant that Toni had a plan of some kind, one that might not be conventional by any stretch of the imagination, but one that would probably buy them some much needed time.
Tony was someone who seldom expressed his emotions, especially so freely, and in that moment, Steve realized what a priceless gift he’d almost never known he had. Tony’s love was a force entirely its own, stronger than any current and more addictive than any opiate. And it was his. Or, had been his…
“We will,” Bucky replied earnestly, in a way that made the blond wonder whether his best friend knew how much he sounded like he needed convincing as much as Steve himself. “I mean, we did promise.”
Bucky in no way discredited what his best friend had done for him; they were brothers till the end of the line, and Steve had seen him farther than that, too; but the real surprise in everything had been Toni. The woman who had every right in the world to hate him with an unparalleled passion, had instead seen fit to open her home to him. To extend a helping hand. To help soothe the traumas in his mind that he rightly deserved to go through.
“Drink?” she asked shortly before he could question it and check if she was okay, tossing her own back and going to pour out another two fingers of what looked like expensive whiskey. When Steve only nodded back, she produced another glass and repeated the process while kicking a chair towards him. He straddled it backwards and accepted the offered drink, rattling it to hear the ice hit the glass as she dropped heavily into the opposite chair, kicking her feet up on to the table.
“The suit,” she replied eventually, with obvious reluctance. “Using the suit speeds up the spread of palladium in my body.”
Steve glanced up just in time to react, throwing a hand up to snatch the bottle of water from the air. It had been sailing directly for his head, and part of him wondered whether it had been thrown with the dual advantage of either aiding him, or getting to watch him take a water bottle to the skull.
The urge to laugh immediately died when her father cursed loudly and lifted his hand. It was a pose she was intimately familiar with, having been on the receiving end of that vicious backhand on more than one occasion.
Idly, he wondered whether that misunderstanding had any bearing on Rhodes’ intense dislike of him, but Steve dismissed the thought as soon as it formed. He knew exactly why the Lieutenant Colonel didn’t have any fondness for him; Rhodes had made his reasons perfectly clear back when Steve and Toni had first started dating…
Rhodes had never seen his best friend take charge like that before, but no one could deny its effectiveness or her efficiency, as his mother’s treatment went off without a hitch and her recovery went just as smoothly. She’d been in remission ever since.
Whether it was MIT lecturers or stuffy old board members or even SHIELD, Toni managed their impossible standards with all the grace of a ballet dancer. Stress and pressure didn’t fluster her; in fact, Steve would have wagered that those things only added to the thrill for the genius; and she effortlessly maintained her status as one of the foremost figures in the world in terms of developmental technology and business, all while being part of a team that saved the world on a regular basis.
The little boy looked shocked, a look that was almost as bad as if Howard had actually managed to hit him, and when he shifted to look up at her, Toni could see the clear and implicit trust in his eyes, aside the fear and confusion.
Toni was used to high standards, and that extended all the way back to her childhood. Steve had heard many a story of how Howard Stark used to push the envelope in terms of what he could realistically expect from his only child and yet Toni, more often than not, somehow rose to the occasion. As much as she was upfront, now, about her father’s toxic child-rearing techniques, the genius had always reluctantly maintained that the Stark patriarch had, at the very least, primed her to face similar expectations in the rest of the course of her life.
“Gotta work on manual releases,” he muttered under his breath, making Steve wonder why he was talking as though he had a direct link to Toni. Maybe it was recording the suit’s first flight? Who knew?
“I’m sorry,” he apologized softly, sounding dejected even to his own ears. “I’m sorry, I didn’t… I was outta line, I just…”
Something heavy dropped into Steve’s gut and he knew, all at once, that something was terribly, terribly wrong. The suit landed softly on the ground in front of them, but when nobody came rushing out, it was enough to confirm Steve’s worst suspicions.
But she wasn’t. Because she was Iron Man. She was the soldier behind the suit of armor that Steve counted as one of his closest friends.
Thankfully, Bruce stepped in. “Think of it like a calculator,” the scientist explained, and the logic and facts looked like it was helping ease the green tint from his veins. Small blessings. “JARVIS can only do the calculations because Toni inputs the knowledge, or codes cues into him. Without her at the helm, he can make educated guesses based on the research that his servers have access to, but he won’t be able to give us a specific window because there’s nobody to enter the data for the calculations.”
Smiling slightly to herself at the half-incredulous, half-hopeful greeting, the inventor offered a light, “Hiya, Birdbrain.”
There was no denying Destiny; that much he knew for certain. Death came for everyone eventually, usually not when they were ready for it, and it would not be held back when it did. Not by the greatest willpower, nor the most boundless love in all the nine realms, of which Toni Stark possessed both.
His words had the desired effect, and Toni laughed as she touched the front legs back to the ground, swinging her feet off the table. “I’m a woman of many talents. How goes the recon?”
By the time he found her first aid supplies, she’d managed to rinse off most of the blood with a wet cloth procured from the tiny kitchenette, and this time, Steve did avert his eyes. Staunchly ignoring the amused little smile on her face, he dug out bandages, gauze, a needle and some surgical thread.
She turned into the touch when he thumbed her tears away, but that was the only acknowledgement he got. Steve wasn’t surprised, but he was determined. One day, somehow, he would make her understand that it wasn’t anything close to her fault.
Everything was better when Tony was around; that was just a point of fact for Steve, a ready given. And on the field? When everything went to shit around him and Steve had no idea what to do or how to do it? Tony was the one he looked for. Looked towards. If he had Iron Man in his sights, then he knew it wasn’t as bad as he thought, because Tony was there and everything would work out, somehow.
“You’ve certainly told them often enough.” But the words were accompanied by a smile that Toni felt against her skin. The billionaire found herself grinning in response, although she huffed a sigh in order to maintain her point.
Too often, a member (or members) of their merry band of misfits were hurt in the line of duty, and Toni had taken that into account when she’d been elbow-deep in specs and designs for the fastest, most durable weaponized jet in the history of flight. Things like shock-absorption and a basics-equipped medical area were as key in her designs as the flight stabilizers and impact-proof propellers. The end product had been one of her proudest inventions, and she’d never appreciated it as much as she did right at that moment.
Maico scrambled in, much to Toni’s relief, but it was short-lived when he wouldn’t let go of her. “Stay!” he wailed, and Toni really didn’t blame him. He’d been so brave up until then, he was probably entitled to a terrified fit when what was presumably a tremor destroyed their safe zone around them.
Toni despised herself for it, but she couldn’t stop the tears from falling anew, not when Steve’s voice was so soft and loving and comforting. “Peter,” she answered softly, her bottom lip wobbling. Steve took another step towards her, but Toni didn’t retreat this time. “
A better person might have accepted that with grace, but Toni had never claimed to be particularly saintly. “I could’ve told you that. And did,” she reminded him, smirking when his only response was to roll his eyes. “Next time, will you trust me when I tell you that I can trace the time and output of any energy usage?”
Steve slid his hand down the length of her body and slipped underneath her panties to cup her pussy. Two fingers skated between her slick folds and unerringly found her clit; at the same time that he began to toy with the sensitive bundle of nerves, the blond leaned forward and sucked her t-shirt covered nipple into his mouth, the suddenness of the dual sensations making her let out a gasp as she came.
Toni’s ears were still ringing slightly, something which she knew was attributed to the nasty knock to the skull she’d taken going down, her whole body ached with a smorgasbord of injuries and JARVIS, her ever faithful companion, had been forced offline by the damage to the suit that she could probably fix, but needed to wait until she wasn’t periodically seeing two of everything.
They stayed like that for long minutes until Peter tuckered himself out, drowsy and on the brink of sleep against her. When his eyelids finally slipped shut, Toni began the slow process of extricating herself from Steve’s arms and standing without dislodging her son, or for that matter, jostling her arm or ribs.
Before he could fall too deep into those thoughts, Steve felt a tap against his shoulder. “JARVIS is picking up something stored on the servers of the suit,” Rhodes explained when he turned around to face the man. If Steve didn’t know any better, he’d say that the Lieutenant Colonel had softened his voice just a little, as though he’d heard Steve’s guilt-ridden thoughts. But that didn’t seem likely. “My biometric didn’t have access rights, but I’d bet a pretty penny yours does.”
Her concession notwithstanding, it still thrilled her to no end when she was barely a foot out of the elevator before an air shaft popped soundlessly open, and Clint dropped to the ground in front of them.
“We’re gonna head back right now,” he reported tersely, turning back to face her with blazing blue eyes. There was some self-recrimination amidst the anger, but now wasn’t the time for her to address that. “If anything happens, you’ll have the element of surprise, since they’ll probably expect you to be with us. Use it, but don’t try to take them on by yourself. Just… wait for me.” Abruptly, the fearless leader was gone, replaced with the urgent lover. “Okay? Please, Toni, promise that you won’t make a move on them until I get there. Can you do that for me?”
“Hey, lay off, alright?” Steve shot back a little too sharply, forgetting about asking advice on approaching Toni while he was busy defending her. “Toni’s great. She works herself to the bone for us and she never even expects so much as a thank you.”
The practiced way that she began sewing up the graze, a neat row of stitches that told a story of steady hands that should have been shaking with pain, made Steve vaguely ill. If anything, he realized distantly, he’d have to seriously reevaluate his firm belief that Toni Stark was a spoilt, entitled Daddy’s princess.
“The armor’s ready!” Bucky grinned broadly as he hooked his arms around the soldier and climbed into a piggy-back that made the three of them look all kinds of ridiculous. Steve couldn’t have given less of a damn as they flew upwards and out of the burning factory. “Last I checked, Toni was still tweaking the computer interface?”
But she had her little Captain America button/good luck charm (that despite her teasing Steve about, had never actually left the confines of her suit until now), and she had the childish plastic, heart-shaped red ring that Peter had oh-so-solemnly gifted her with from his cereal box (that she proudly wore with everything from oil-stained jean shorts to sharp-cut Armani) and really, how much more strength did she need?
It had been something of a mantra to her, growing up, and so she’d learnt from a young age exactly how to spin the press. To make them see nothing more or less than exactly what she wanted them to see and what she needed them to see, and that had always been one simple thing: infallibility.
There was rage… but there were other things too. The ability to identify and care for family. The desire to protect. The presence of mind to follow orders and yet still act independently.
It was likely that the pair would always be closer than Peter would be with him, although that wasn’t at all to say that he wasn’t close with his son. It was just a matter of how early the trust with Toni had been built. He wasn’t envious of it; only adoring.
In a way, the discovery that the Hulk was able to feel something more than rage changed Bruce’s entire perspective. It weighed in heavily on the side of Toni’s theory; that the Hulk was just a supercharged alter ego of himself with thoughts and emotions, albeit primal, that went beyond what was immediately prevalent.
Steve was going to wake her up with nightmares about Toni’s screams for help without being able to reach her, and finding her dead body, and coming back to their home bearing the news that she was gone and never coming back.
And it was here that she’d learned what to do with love. She’d learned that the only thing she could do, when given this amazing and unconditional love, was to work as hard as possible to be worthy of it. Deserving of it. And along the way, learn to love, too.
“I’ve seen this before,” he muttered thoughtfully, and it clicked after another second. “On Iron Man. On the suit.” With a flash of comprehension, he raised tormented blue eyes to her. “This is the power source, isn’t it? The unstable power source with all the risks you don’t want anyone else to take?”
There was a small pause, and Jim took a moment to digest what Toni had proposed to them. He’d heard what she hadn’t expressly said – that her lack of a need for caution moving forward, meant that she would take risks with herself that she wouldn’t have taken with the kid – but what she’d said after had made sense, too. They couldn’t afford to play it safe, anymore, nothing about this situation was safe in any way. They could either blast, hack and force their way through, or else risk secondary and tertiary collapses until one of them killed her, or they got her out.
Peter wasn’t a child prone to complaining and he certainly wasn’t one to make demands for anything, so the fact that he was doing so now told Toni just how much all this was affecting him. It made her wish, more than anything, that she could just be at the tower in that moment, tucking Peter in as was their routine and singing that Italian lullaby that her mother had always sung for her, that had somehow found its way into the pair’s goodnight ritual.
“Antonietta,” Howard Stark greeted her stiffly, but the expression completely dissolved into shock and happiness when his eyes landed on the super soldier behind her. “Steve...? Is that… you’re alive!”
“Technically, I am the co-pilot, Miss Stark, Sergeant Barnes.” JARVIS’ voice came overhead, a typical mix of dry amusement and smug snark. Toni never ceased to be amazed by him.
The third, and arguably the most important thing that Tony noticed, was that the aforementioned goons steps sounded like they were walking
It was only by sheer force of will that Steve didn’t bridge the gap between them, scoop her up and kiss her till they were both breathless and gasping.
Peter became aware slowly, confused at first as to why someone was shaking his shoulder. It didn’t feel like his Daddy, who was always soft and gentle, and Mommy woke him up with cuddles, so…
“I told him that heroes were born, not made,” she said, a terrible flatness to her tone that didn’t match the exuberance he’d associated with her up to now. That instead, matched the muted bleakness that had been in her eyes earlier. “I told him that Erskine chose you because Steve Rogers was a hero that needed a body that would fit his heart.” She paused for a moment, the words hanging heavily in the air between them before she rapped her knuckles twice against the door jamb. “See you around,
Bucky worked with strict single-mindedness, a repetition of motion that reminded him, somewhat, of his first time shipping out. Back then, he’d been a young hotshot convinced that he was going to serve and that he wouldn’t fall prey to the wake-up call that a first real tour was supposed to give all fresh soldiers. Like the rest of them, he’d been woefully mistaken, and in that first week alone, had considered calling it quits give or take seven times.
Anger warred with his despairing guilt; anger not at her, but at himself for ever being so stupid as to think so lowly of her and tell her as much; but even the hint of it gave him the strength to push back a little, to push his boundaries and his comfort zone because the most important thing wasn’t whether or not he could handle this. The only important thing was her.
And for the record, in all the years he’d known her, he was still entirely unable to say those words without the fondest of grins lighting up his face.
“Repulsors,” he replied, and Steve could hear the grin in his voice. “It’s incredibly new tech. Honestly, I’m not even sure that it’s entirely stable.”
“James!” Rather than offer an answer, Toni’s inaction ended with her delayed reaction to seeing Bucky. She smiled brightly, the sight changing her entire face, and threw her arms around his neck in a giant hug. Bucky chuckled softly but gathered her close nonetheless, being careful not to hurt her any more than she already had been. The unpleasant heat came back into Steve’s chest and just as he started to question why he’d even tagged along to what was obviously a reunion between them, the genius pulled away from Bucky and repeated the process with him. Thankfully, Steve didn’t waste too much time being stunned by the affection, and instead just pulled her close to him.
“I thought about sending in the suit alone, but artificial intelligence is still a bit of a ways away,” he replied around what Steve was sure was another grin. “Look, from the sounds of it, there’s a revolution going on outside that nobody invited me to, so I’m going to crash that. Path seems clear for you to find James now. I’ll be back.”
Coaching herself to breathe through it; because she’d certainly had worse; Toni consoled herself with the knowledge that the beam hadn’t hit an artery, and she wasn’t in too much immediate danger. She could tell, because the wound was bleeding slowly rather than gushing, and judging from the small amount of mobility she still had in her arm, there probably wasn’t muscle damage either. In all likelihood, she’d just need a few sutures and possibly a sling, if Steve or Rhodey or Bucky or Bruce had anything to say about it. Her chances of getting away without one did not look promising.
Blue eyes widened with shock as Steve snapped back up to his feet, Bucky and Bruce both whirling around to face him as well. All three of them realized what was happening at the same time.
She could tell all manner of reporters or civilians this, and some might even believe her, but one thing that absolutely none of them would believe, was that she ever got scared.
Steve needed no more motivation than those words, and his heart fairly leaped with hope. “Get a harness ready,” he instructed Rhodes as Bruce took his non-verbal command to move the equipment away. With any luck, they wouldn’t need it again. “I’m not letting her climb any more than she has to. I’ll go down to her and bring her up. Buck,” he turned to his best friend when Rhodes happily didn’t argue with him. The ex-assassin had grim determination in his features and was already carefully sliding into the spot that Bruce had vacated. “Be careful,” was all Steve cautioned with, seeing that Bucky already knew without asking what he was meant to do.
At one time, that might have been a low blow on her part, but today, it simply rang to her as the absolute truth.
Toni pursed her lips to keep in her low exclamation of guilt. She ached to scoop Peter up and reassure him that everything was okay, but she couldn’t do that. She couldn’t even ask Steve to do that, because her lover had come to her rescue, and there was no way she could regret saving Maico but Toni would have given anything that was hers to give, to spare Peter from all this.
In theory, it made sense, but for some bizarre reason, the notion didn’t make him as happy as he thought it should have. Wasn’t it supposed to be a relief? That Steve wouldn’t have to confront anything awkward like feelings with Tony, and wouldn’t have to risk losing the best thing he’d had after coming out of the ice?
“We did a lot today.” Steve explained. “It’s to be expected. When you work on muscles that have such a build up of automatic tension… yeah, it’s bound to make you tired.” He said, working her arch which made her shudder. “Harder there.” She demanded, and Steve complied.
“Let me know if you want to book another session. I’ll try and be available whenever suits your schedule.” Steve said, picking up his table again, oils already packed away.
Steve loved Sam's body. He really did. Not in a romantic or sexual way; they'd never been like that, but after years and years of exchanging massages on a quid pro quo basis, Steve was more familiar with Sam's body than he was with his own.
it, sure, but he hadn’t given it any thought since he’d left Obadiah to put his parents’ affairs into order after their death.
He could feel Steve getting close, bearing down on his cock in the last few thrusts and crying out when Steve reached between them to stroke Tony’s cock through the last thrusts he could manage before he came inside his husband.
All around him, scientists bustled and argued in thick winter coats, trying to figure out how to thaw the remains out while doing the least amount of damage possible. Some were of the opinion that it’d be better to keep him frozen like this until they could get the remains to a better-equipped facility.
Tony was also going quiet on the calls they did have, and while Steve didn’t understand what was going through his head, he knew the distance was making him uncertain. Steve had always been supportive of Tony’s obligations and he’d never been jealous or felt neglected when Tony wasn’t there. Sure, he missed him, always, but this was Tony’s life, and it was also Steve’s life. They were grown men with obligations, there was nothing to be done.
“Always causing me trouble, aren’t you, Rogers?” He said, using the armor’s glove to scrape some of the melting ice off Roger’s front. The ice had weakened so much by now that massive chunks fell off at once, uncovering parts of the body in one fell swoop. Tony had to rush to catch Rogers’ body before it could go down with the chunks of ice. “Jeez Cap, going to give me a heart attack.” Even with the armor it wasn’t easy to lift the man, his legs still partly encased in ice as none of the heaters were aiming at them directly. Tony lifted Rogers, ice and all, onto the morgue slab that had been removed and brought up in preparation of transporting the Captain to the freezer there.
“Please.” Tony’s voice was so soothing. He sounded so relaxed, still a little sleepy but utterly content. Steve loved him like this.
He worked his way down Stark’s back. The pattern of tensions hadn’t really changed. Steve wished he could lay the man out and just work him over until they made some progress, but he kept his touches light.
“I’m really sorry I kept you waiting, Miss Potts.” He said, heading over to her. “Do you still want me to work on you?” He asked.
“I’ll just feel my way around for a moment, okay? I don’t really understand what I’m looking at, I want to feel. You can take a hold of my wrists if that feels better?” He offered, remembering how Tony’s hands had shot up to stop him the last time he’d gotten too close to the device in his chest.
Something about the kiss, and Steve’s arms wrapping around him made Tony calm down. Everything would be fine, Steve would get back to normal. They’d bounced back from much stranger predicaments than this.
“No, no I don’t think so.” Steve really liked her voice, there was something kind but professional to her. Efficient, but not rushed.
“Slow.” Tony gasped, feeling the tip of Steve’s cock push against his entrance. The strange edge Steve’s invisibility brought to the equation translated into a strange thrill that Tony couldn’t quite comprehend, but he was more than happy to roll with it. This was his husband and feeling him was more than enough.
Steve had seen nice places now, thanks to Tony’s generosity, but this place was beyond anything he’d ever dreamt of. It was beautiful, modern in a way that somehow put him at ease. It flowed with its surroundings, like this building could ever only exist near the ocean. It was built so Steve felt the calming water was near and he could hear it everywhere, like he was living in it, far away from any civilization.
When he got home though, the urge overwhelmed him, and he swallowed hard. Ten times, Tony had said. He’d been paid ten times his normal fee. “Fuck me…” Steve said softly.
“Have you seen anyone about it?” Steve asked, reaching out for the man’s arm and gently leading him to sit down on the sofa with Steve. “Someone like me, or even your regular doctors?”
“There.” Stark gasped when Steve dug his fingers into the occipital region where the skull met the neck, a common point of pain for anyone leaning forward too much, like Stark was doing. “You got it.” Steve smiled, massaging out the tension there. “If you want to lay down on your back later, I can work these muscles over more.” He offered but didn’t push for it, and Stark didn’t respond.
“God please don’t be alive…” It was an unkind thing to think, but Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for all the implications a living Captain America from the 1940s would have.
With some difficulty, Tony detached the front and back plating for his thighs from the main skeleton of his suit, sliding them over and under Rogers’ thighs to help warm him up. The lower legs were easier. Soon he’d half-covered Rogers in the heating elements of his suit, helping to speed up his thawing process.
When Steve was massaging Sam, he didn't need to think. His hands, the length of his lower arm and his elbow became automized precision tools, like his body was honed for Sam's relief. There was only one other person he'd ever had this level of familiarity with, and Bucky had deserted Steve's services when he'd gotten serious about his relationship with Sam. Steve couldn’t blame them, nothing felt better than a massage from a loved one who knew what they were doing.
Steve couldn’t stop thinking about his appointment at Stark Tower for the rest of the day. He couldn’t stop thinking about Stark’s back either. It wasn’t unusual to see businessmen with painfully tight backs. Hours hunched over computer keyboards with no movement were enough to ruin the healthiest back, but Stark’s back was something else. The patterns weren’t typical for office work, the parts of him that were tense didn’t match the lifestyle Steve imagined for him. He wondered if Stark had been injured recently, maybe during his kidnapping?
Steve worked over her feet and up to her calves and knees before she decided that would do for her today.
When he glanced over, he saw that the man had fallen fast asleep on his table. Miss Potts followed his gaze, smiling as well. “Looks like you tired him out.” She smiled.
“No, Pep, he’s mine, I’m keeping him.” Stark protested. Steve smiled down at Stark, glad to see he was relaxed enough for joking and seemed happy to see her.
Tony nodded, looking up at Steve through sleepy half-lidded eyes. “Yeah, but we can go again.” He assured Steve, who shook his head in response, soft and reassuring.
Stark didn’t look at him. “Tony is fine.” He said, surprising Steve with a tone that almost sounded as if the thought of Steve calling him Mister Stark was ridiculous at this point.
“If I have to be naked, you should be too.” Steve told him, his breath warm against Tony’s lips. He pulled the shirt off Tony, backing him against the bedroom wall.
By the time Steve left the tower ten minutes later, he had a pocket full of cash and another double appointment set up for the next week.
He ended up turning Tony to his side and working from the back to the front in his rib area to really feel out all the connecting masses of tight muscles and loosen them strategically. He worked and worked, checking in with Tony about the pressure repeatedly as he went.
He set up the table quickly, patting it for Tony to sit on. “Would you lay down for me?” He asked, giving Tony an encouraging smile. He looked calmer now, as if a huge burden had been lifted from him just by telling Steve what was wrong. Steve cheered internally when Tony lowered himself onto his table with his chest facing up, exposed for Steve to work on.
Discretion was important to Stark though; Steve was sure of that. Otherwise, Steve was sure, it would have been some PA and not Miss Potts herself calling Steve for his services.
“I think that’d be perfect.” She said. “We’ll get a table too, shall we, so you won’t have to lug that thing across the city.” She decided, eyeing Steve’s equipment.
“I have a hole in my chest.” He finally said, clear and slow, as if to give Steve a moment to process it. Steve was grateful because he needed the processing time. “I have a hole in my chest the size of your fist. I don’t have a sternum. The muscles that connect to my sternum were cut and crudely attached to a device that’s keeping me alive.” He tapped the centre of his chest and Steve heard a hollow knock, as if someone was tapping their watch, or a thick sheet of plexiglass. “It was done in dim lighting in a dark cave and there’s no removing or changing it, not without cutting out even more. There’s nothing to be done.” He shuddered at the memory. “… it fucking hurts.” Tony’s eyes were wide and intense, almost wet and Steve believed every word of it.
Tony’s breath came out in a shuddering staccato as he tried to get himself under control. Steve could feel him willing himself to believe what Steve was saying. He didn’t move, didn’t say another word.
He realized Tony’s hand was moving and he looked down over Tony’s shoulder to watch Tony stroking himself, getting his own cock comfortably lubed.
It was 11:30 on a Friday night. He hadn’t looked forward to dragging his table onto the crowded Friday evening trains full of drunk party animals.
It was a while until Rogers body stilled. “Oh god, please don’t be dead.” Tony said quietly, feeling the man’s neck for a pulse.
“Go on Steve, I want you.” He said softly, releasing one of his arms around Steve’s neck to feel out where Steve’s face was. “You okay?” He asked.
A sound did come, but there was no telling if it had been in response to Tony’s request or if it would have come out anyway. It was a primal pained noise.
The evening light was shining in through the floor to ceiling windows, soaking the room in a warm red light.
“Next weekend.” Sam confirmed, giving him a dazed smile. “Take care of yourself, Steve. Try not to get too rich.”
Days passed and Steve got busy again, the whole Stark situation blurring into the background. He wasn’t even sure if he’d ever see the man again.
Steve glanced at the man’s chest. There wasn’t much to see there now, not with the t-shirt on, something looked slightly odd though, Steve didn’t dare look too closely right now. Maybe a deformity of the chest? An injury that hadn’t healed well? It was hard to tell. He could only focus on treating what he was allowed to treat. If Stark wanted him to know more, Steve would find out.
“Would you like me to put on a heating blanket?” He asked, assuming that she didn’t have the same hang-ups that Stark did.
Tony neither could nor wanted to do anything but hold onto the sheets for dear life as Steve railed him. He pushed his heels into the bed, meeting Steve’s thrusts eagerly.
He looked at Tony and tried to form a response, lips quivering as his muscles tried to comply. “S- Slee-ing eu-I.” It was gibberish, except…
It had been a full two weeks since his appointment at Stark Tower when his phone rang again. Steve had saved Miss Potts’ number just in case and was glad for it when his phone rang at 7AM and he sleepily rolled over to glance at it.
He didn’t have long to laugh though, because Steve pulled his pants off in a fell swoop, stepping on the hem and picking Tony up to pull him out of them. He paused, putting Tony down only slowly, and Tony caught on seconds later.
Most of all though, how could he trust anyone on this ship with these remains. These were only partly his people. If the corpse was thawed out, how could Tony keep it safe? He realized that he’d have to be the one escorting it back to civilization.
After a moment, Stark did and Steve pulled his hands back up to the man’s shoulders, massaging them gently. “A lot of people react like that when I get near a part of their body that's in pain. It’s not unusual.” That was a blatant lie, but he didn’t want Stark to feel embarrassed. Sure, Steve had had one or two veterans lash out at him like that, but at least they’d been aware of their own PTSD. He wondered if Stark was.
He was given the all-clear and one of the guys asked Steve to follow him. He thanked the receptionist and stepped into a small elevator with the man. A minute later, the double doors opened into a gorgeous apartment. It was probably the single nicest place Steve had ever seen. Beautiful, but comfortable. The living area he was facing had floor to ceiling windows out into the city. The sofa was so large and cosy-looking, Steve wanted to faceplant into it.
“More than nice.” Steve gave a shuddering breath, slowly finding a rhythm between his thrusts and his strokes, chest pressed against Tony’s back. He could feel Tony’s every moan, feel him shift his body against Steve’s as they slowly moved together, taking their time to just feel.
“Thank you for telling me, I’m really glad I get to try and help at all. That’s a lot of trust, I appreciate that.” He stood up, holding out his hand to help Tony up as well. “Let me help. Let me really try to help you.” He asked, heart beating faster when Tony took his hand and let Steve pull him to his feet. Tony’s hand was cold in his.
“Anything I ought to be aware of before we start?” He asked. Usually he preferred to do a 5- to 10-minute intake conversation with a new client, but with Stark being so secretive and the quick changeover Steve felt a little out of tune with himself and his usual procedure. It was strange, losing the upper hand was something he experienced occasionally when working in a client’s home. Even if they were just people with various pains who needed his help, Steve couldn’t quite forget what influential members of the high-society they both were.
“I think our time is up.” Steve said, having already wound down the procedure. “Take your time getting up.” He instructed, gently helping the man sit up.
The occasional generous tip from the rare wealthy client went a long way in helping him along too, so Steve never shied away from the extra work involved in the non-disclosure process and never hesitated to provide his social security numbers to let the client or their assistant run a background check on him.
“Thank you, that was amazing.” Steve rolled Tony onto his back so he could kiss him, sated and calm now.
Steve kissed him in response. “Yeah, just… had to have good long look is all.” He said, and Tony smiled at the heat he could hear in Steve’s voice.
Word had gotten around somehow and over the last year or so, Steve’s struggling massage studio that he’d operated out of an overpriced Brooklyn studio apartment had flourished into a business the specialized in house-calls. He’d long given up renting a place, instead everything ran over his website. Word of mouth really was the best advertisement.
And so, Tony sent everyone away to continue their own research while he waited. He stood and watched as the water dripped off the block of ice. Dark thoughts clouded his mind as he couldn’t stop his own resentment from bubbling up again. This was the man he’d been measured up against all his childhood. And for what? What kind of a father compared a child to a grown man?
“My god, how are you even upright?” Steve didn’t mean to say it, it just slipped out. “Sorry, it’s just… I’ve never seen anything like this before. I understand a bit more about what’s hurting you now.” He said, looking up at Tony who was watching Steve very carefully.
It wasn’t hard to deliver, Steve did miss Tony desperately when he couldn’t have him. Just sleeping next to Tony last night showed him how badly he slept without him, how short and restless his nights at SHIELD were. With Tony in his arms, Steve could easily sleep 7 hours like a normal human, peaceful and restful, when alone he woke up after 3 hours, fully functional but wired.
He set to work happily, working over her feet thoroughly. There was a warm sense of pride in his chest. Steve could feel that he’d really helped Tony.
He started to work on the muscles in Stark’s shoulders, working through his shirt and house coat, not using too much pressure, feeling his way around the man’s reactions. He knew he was getting it right when Stark leaned back into his touch ever so slightly, seeking out more pressure subconsciously. Steve adjusted his touch and started really working on his shoulders and neck.
Steve smiled. He was almost certain now. She was doing this to get Stark on his table. Whatever she knew that Steve didn’t, it had her concerned enough to set all this up to help Stark get the treatment he needed. Steve admired that. Whatever they were to each other, there was a lot of love there, that much was clear.
“Fuck...” Tony still couldn’t believe it. “It’s going to be alright. You’ll see.” He said, detaching the chest plate from his armor and laying it over Rogers’ torso. It didn’t fit there well but it did so well enough to lay flat. Tony could see the exact moment when the armor’s heating plate registered with Rogers. Something settled and Tony realized his face had gotten almost animated, there was agony written on it, but that expression relaxed ever so slightly with the added heat the chest plate provided. Maybe it brought him comfort.
Miss Potts. Wow. He’d seen her picture on tons of magazines lately. She was one high powered lady with a vision. Steve wasn’t much for tech, and he’d never been able to afford a Stark phone, but he knew that company made some amazing products. From what he knew, Potts had taken the helm as CEO of Stark Industries after Tony Stark had stepped down. That had been a whole to-do a year or so ago. The guy had been kidnapped in Afghanistan. The ransom video had been played all over the news. Steve thought back, trying to remember if he’d ever seen anything about the guy again after that press conference where he’d announced SI wouldn’t produce weapons anymore. He didn’t think so. Weeks later, Potts had taken over his position.
"If you get so much rich people business from this, that you can't find any more time in your books, make sure to recommend me." Sam chuckled. "I don't know how many more office gigs I can take."
He heard the soft noise of a zipper being undone, then more fabric noises and finally the softest of creaks of someone climbing onto his massage table.
“I can do your kind of pain.” Tony assured him. “Last week helped already, if you can do that for everywhere, I can stick out some pain in the sessions.” Steve understood. The constant chronic level of pain Tony was in had to be wearing him down, he was happy to accept an hour or two of more intense pain if it made the constant buzz of daily pain go down.
“What’s the duct tape for?” Steve asked, though what he really wanted to know was ‘what the hell is this whole thing for?’.
"Yeah sure. And feet." Sam decided, adjusting himself a little on the table. "You staying for dinner?" He asked Steve when he set to work on Sam's lower half.
The day flew by and Steve managed to get home by 7PM. There was no way he was going to Stark Tower after a day of work, smelling like sweat, massage oil and the New York subways system. He showered and changed into a fresh uniform, treating himself to a cab ride to avoid dragging his equipment across town again.
Steve’s fingers trailed up Tony’s thigh and over his hip, forehead pillowed gently on Tony’s shoulder so he could watch his hand stroke over the curve of Tony’s waist.
“Everything…but, my upper back around the ribs and the lower back. Neck too.” He cut himself off and Steve had a feeling that the man was in need of a full-body massage, more than anyone Steve had ever treated. If his client wasn’t so skittish, Steve would have suggested as much, but he understood that this had to be Stark’s time, and that his priorities were what counted, at least this time around.
“Stay down for a few minutes, okay? You’re going to feel dizzy.” He warned him, his hand on the man’s arm over the towel.
Home, she’d said. So, she didn’t live with him. He let her head over to the table and watched as she woke Tony gently, a hand in his hair. He still startled a little, but not much and looked down his body, confused.
"Can't. I got that late-night client." Steve said regretfully. He hadn't seen his friends for quality time in weeks.
He wished he knew Bruce Banner in person. If anyone knew about this serum it was him. All Tony had to go by were his publications, and they really weren’t speculative enough to give Tony a step-by-step manual on what to do if Rogers’ body was ever found. So, Tony waited. He decided to take a blood sample from one of the major arteries, and tissue samples. His suit was capable of taking small core samples. Granted, the device was not designed for human flesh, but it would work in principle. And then… well, then it was a matter of preserving the body until wiser decisions could be made. He just had to make sure none of it fell into the hands of anyone with a deeper agenda. This was going to be a nightmare.
I can't thank you enough for your kind comments! They really motivate me and give me such a massive boost of happiness whenever I get a notification email. I hope you liked this interlude. More to come soon!
Tony laughed. “You’re right. Sleeping Beauty is much more fitting.” He said. “Good you’ve still got a brain, I’m glad.” He said. “Why don’t you stay down and get properly warm. You’ll need… god you’ll need all kinds of medical care, but you’re going to be alright, I’ll make sure of it.” He promised. Rogers’ eyes crinkled a little and Tony wasn’t sure if he was going for a smile or if the real weight of the situation was sinking in.
“No problem.” Steve assured him quickly, glossing over it and sliding a folded towel under Stark’s head for comfort. “I’ll work on your neck and shoulders but let me know if you’d like me to focus on something else as well.”
It wasn’t three minutes before the elevator doors to the penthouse opened and Miss Potts’ tell-tale heel clicks announced her arrival. “Tony… oh!” She stopped, clearly surprised but delighted to see Tony in a state of undress. Her eyes darting to his bare chest and then to Steve.
Steve turned them around, pushing Tony down onto the bed and covering Tony’s body with his own, barely missing a beat before he picked the rhythm up again.
“Can you tell me what’s hurting?” Steve asked, worried about causing pain. He had only meant to straighten him up the slightest bit to get a full picture of his back.
“Sure thing, I’d be happy to.” Steve assured her. “We can set up a three-hour time slot, and you two can just let me know how you want to split it?” He suggested, starting on her other foot.
“Your body, your rules.” Steve assured him and followed Stark to the sofa at a respectful distance, watching his back as he went. Stark was bent forward a bit, as if protecting himself. Steve figured he must have had a recent injury to his ribs or collarbone maybe. The man seemed fragile to him, stiff and tense. Steve found that he really wanted to help him.
Steve moved his hands across the man's back, trying to treat more systemically this time around, rather than asking Stark for specific areas to focus on. It was a little awkward with Stark sitting up, and Steve couldn’t do a lot of his best techniques, but he was working around that as best he could, working on massaging out the largest muscles first and loosening the man’s shoulders and neck second.
He had a feeling though that this hadn’t been Tony’s experience in previous relationships. Tony sent him gift and cards and notes almost obsessively, and Steve could read a frantic need to please in them that made his heart ache. He could practically see Tony’s inner thoughts spiraling in every text, and Steve’s responses weren’t making a dent in the self-doubt.
“I love you. This is perfect, you’re perfect. I’m so happy to be here.” Steve whispered in his ear, feeling Tony’s thighs clench tight as he came into Steve’s hand, a helpless cry rippling through him.
“I want to retire here.” Tony told him, still in Steve’s arms, but both of them neck deep in the pleasantly warm water.
Tony nodded, looking up at him. Steve couldn’t look away from the man’s eyes now that he had a chance to look. They were very expressive. Tony was an incredibly handsome man, even with months of neglect.
Steve knew Tony very well by now. The first reunion had to be rough, it was what Tony needed. He needed to feel wanted, he needed hands to grab, limbs to cling, clawing nails and hard kisses that reminded him he’d been missed.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think of that. Must be weird to not see your body?” He said, stroking his hand up Steve’s arms. He was so solid. It was making Tony dizzy, making him feel unsettled that he couldn’t see Steve when he could feel him so clearly.
As Steve worked, he felt like he couldn’t pinpoint any sites of origin for the man’s pain. He was almost convinced now that the real problem lay elsewhere, not in Stark's back.
Stark moved his arms, touching his face. Steve looked up just in time to see him wiping at his face.
“This is insane…” He said, fingers coming into contact with Steve’s naked torso. Tony stepped closer, his other hand coming to rest on Steve’s hips. Everything felt normal, he could smell Steve’s body wash, his skin, and yet his eyes were seeing absolutely nothing. Not even a sheen or a ripple in space.
Taking his eyes off the ocean waves, he pressed his lips and nose into the sun warmed skin of Tony’s shoulder, breathing in the familiar scent of his skin, his arm wrapping around Tony’s middle ever so gently. He didn’t want to wake Tony, not really. The man had been exhausted even before he’d picked Steve up, and he’d been utterly drained but finally looking happy by the time Steve had washed his body down gently in the shower after hours of plane sex and talking.
And fine, that was damn well easy for Bucky to say, wasn’t it?! It wasn’t the love of his life trapped under there, it wasn’t his whole world that was in danger and hurt and afraid and needing him! Toni had called, she’d reached out like she’d promised, and Steve had sworn to her that he would get her out of the nightmare she was trapped in, and how was he supposed to do that if everyone else who claimed to want to help, stopped him from doing that?!
but since I was confused yesterday, I was probably also confused today, about some of the other stuff I needed to take care of. Like going with you when you go away so that you don’t have to go alone.”
“Bein’ brainwashed ain’t a good enough reason for actin’ like you’re braindead, jerk.” Steve tried to force his voice into something light and nonchalant. Bucky wouldn’t let him forget it if he saw Steve being protective of Tony, never mind that it was totally friendly. “You and Tony finally hit your stride as friends, don’t go complicating that now.”
This time, when he kissed her, it was hard and almost punishing; it was a mark of dominance and possession, but also the sign of a spectacular crashing of emotions as Steve let all of his pent-up feelings and fears pour out of him like water out of a fallen dam wall. Toni responded with as much fervor as she could manage, her own emotions meeting his like cracks of lightning, until a whimper of pain escaped her from trying to hitch a leg around Steve’s waist. The sound had her lover pulling back instantly, much to Toni’s disgruntlement. Both of them breathing heavily, Steve rested his forehead against hers, regaining composure without forfeiting their closeness.
Sure enough though, another missile greyed out before his eyes, and Steve fought to keep his voice steady as he relayed the news.
She still wasn’t entirely sure why she’d done it; perhaps an ill-advised attempt to prove to herself that he no longer had any dominion over her, the way he’d had when she was a child and through most of her adult life; but for whatever her reason, she was glad she’d done it. It had been cathartic to look him in the eye one more time, face him one more time, and not flinch.
, who was kind enough to check up on me when the updates starting coming in slower, and in so doing, encouraged me to keep going! Thank you, lovely!
“I promised you I would be.” Steve brought her carefully closer to him, still cradling her against him, and pressed his lips to her temple for a long moment. “I will always be there. But please, baby, don’t you ever do that to me again.”
“Miss Toni?” Maico called out fearfully, presumably frightened by her momentary silence. His fear cut her to the bone, making her swallow viciously in an attempt to speak through the pain. Thankfully, she was spared any further unexpected incidences when the tremors suddenly came to a halt, rubble settling into place but otherwise falling quiet around them.
Laughing slightly, because Clint seemed to have that effect on her even now, Toni took pity on the archer and explained. “They’re working on it.” She knew they were; could still feel the occasional trickle of dust and dirt falling on to her and the kid, threatening ominously to bury them completely. It was enough to make her go close to crazy with tension and anticipation. “I’m using the suit’s backup power. It’s a long story.”
She also understood that Toni loved her son, and their entire family, more than anything in the world, so if she was being reckless, there was a goddamn reason for it.
