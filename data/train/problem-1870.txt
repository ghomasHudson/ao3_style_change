“Good boy, now go upstairs and stay under the covers and don’t move until I come to get you.” Sherlock pulled the boy into a tight hug and kissed him once on the forehead, once on each eyelid, and then deeply on the lips, getting one last fill from his elixir of life.
Sherlock lifted him up, careful of his bruised bum, and held him bridal style. As they headed upstairs, John grabbed a hold of the Sherlock’s shirt and buried his head into the man’s embrace. For once, John was thankful for the comfort Sherlock’s warmth brought.
“That is enough!” Mycroft snapped at the both of them. He continued to wrap John’s ankle as he spoke. “John you are not to use your own bliss, as we do not know the adverse effects it has on Subs. It is also apparent your judgment on when and how much is compromised.”
“Indeed,” his voice became darker, “be that as it may, your…illness, shall we call it, is quite a mystery and, for all my brother’s immaturity, is a genius and the evidence he finds will be invaluable in learning how to…help malfunctioning Subs such as yourself. It would be much more politically correct to provide assistance to those Subs rather than put them down, wouldn’t you say John?”
He put on gloves, making sure to barley touch the sheet of paper as to not provide incriminating fingerprints. However, Sherlock doubted the police would suspect anything but suicide once he set the puzzle pieces into place for their little minds to find. He examined the forms one by one, in awe of how John’s personality was evident in the way his letters stood up straight, no slant left or right.
“No,” John said simply, looking into dark crazy eyes and feeling a twinge of guilt settle in his gut. He made Sherlock like this. Sure, he could blame it on the fact that Sherlock tied him down until John went into a frenzy, but still, it was John and John alone who turned Sherlock into this crazed animal. “You need to pace yourself while drinking. It will help your body process the blood better, and it will teach you control.”
“No, let us not interfere with my brother’s chatting yet. Perhaps he’s merely whetting his appetite and will lose interest,” he looked up at his PA, who quirked an eyebrow in disbelief. “Yes, well, keep an eye on both of them,” Mycroft didn’t believe his words either, for Sherlock was not one to just whet anything.
“Welcome everyone,” Mycroft spoke into the microphone in front of him. “As you know, our scientists have been working on a way to aid Subs with RDD for the past two years. Just within the last month, we have made giant leaps and have finally discovered a solution. We will have a demonstration for you after the Q and A portion. Without further ado, we will now be taking your questions.
With that, Sherlock retracted his finger, wiped it on the sheets, put on a pair of pants, and then leapt out of bed. He could hear John talking downstairs and fear shot through him like a lightning bolt.
“I’m fine,” John snapped, pulling the basket in front of him to act as a barrier. He realized that was the wrong move when the man’s face turned serious. Suddenly, flashbacks of sitting in the back of a car, his hands cuffed as he cried for Sherlock flooded his mind from that one simple look. He needed Sherlock then and he needed him now, there was no denying it if the tremors in his hands were any proof. “I-I’m fine.”
John sighed again, thumping his head back against the brick, hoping the pain would dull the rest of his senses.
John was hungry, no, John was starving. It had been three days since he had eaten and his animal inside was starting to claw at his skin. He could smell Sherlock even though the human was downstairs working on his latest experiment. The odor was intoxicating, taking his breath away and making his heart want to start beating in his chest. And damn it, if he didn’t stop drooling he didn’t know what he was going to do.
John scoffed and rolled his eyes but continued to listen. Greg had taken care of Molly, so he sort of trusted him, but there was no way in Hell he trusted the system the Dom worked for.
Throughout the years it had proved much harder than he first anticipated to keep eyes on John. Not because of his inadequate network, the homeless men and women had never let him down, but it was Mycroft who intercepted their communication. The last bit of information he’d gathered on his John was that the boy was still living with his mother at seventeen but after that, Sherlock had no idea what John was doing now.
John was lost for now. The vampire was not only going into a healing sleep, he was surrounded by six hunters; some of which Greg had worked with personally and could attest to their skills in taking down vampires.
“Very good,” John stood up, pointed at Jim to let him know he was in charge of holding on to Molly during their ‘adventure.’ “Mike, I want you to be look out for any cops or IBAD patrols, yeah?”
“Go away!” was all John could think to say. He was ears deep in something he didn’t even mean to be in, and now he had no idea how to get out.
“Yes, yes, I’m sure they are, but you still need your rest. And you need to eat something as well,” Mycroft said as they walked out of the room. John heard a loud groan in response, making the boy smile.
His filling member decided for him, and John put his hand under the elastic of his pants, slowly rolling his balls as they tightened up.
“I had never been interested in sex before, my work was my life and I felt no need until I met Victor.” Sherlock added a tone to his voice similar to when he mentioned the morons like Anderson or the idiotic people on the crap telly they watched together, so John’s subconscious would register the boy behind the name meant nothing to the detective. When it came down to it, it was true, at least compared to John those people meant nothing to him, just silly ghosts wondering around.
“Good night, my love,” Sherlock whispered over the unconscious body lying in his bed. The body was his now, his, and now it was time to ensure no one would ever take John away from him. The detective licked the boy’s cheek once, buried his nose in the soft blonde hair for a moment to see if the scent had changed any, and then turned off the light on his way out of the room. Sherlock had given the teenager the proper dosage of his homemade sedative, which he’d tested out on himself many times, in order keep his boy asleep for 10-15 hours. However, the detective had been planning this moment ever since he talked to the boy on the phone and knew it would only take six hours to complete his possession.
“Alright,” he said, washing away those thoughts that haunted him. He could help Sherlock, help Mycroft, make his mistake better, make it so the two brothers could still have one another. “Let’s begin.”
“Why, Sherlock? Why are you doing this to me?!” John shouted, though the mask muffled is voice to a whisper.
The sensation was so intense it almost hurt and my God did he need to come. “It’s just like when you get that burst of sensation when the feeling comes back to your arm, yeah. Except, the only difference is,” he kissed the tip, making John shout and tears start to form in his eyes from the intense stimulation, “the penis has almost 25,000 nerve endings, which will all light up when I take this off for you to come. How does that sound?”
“You’re…um, you’re taking me away from Sherlock?” John asked, blinking rapidly to keep the tears at bay as the words left his mouth.
“No! No way, Sherlock,” John tried to scoot back, but ended up completely on Mycroft’s lap, which was even more awkward than being on Sherlock’s.
The next thing John knew, there were hand on his arms, forcing them to his side, and restraining them there by a giant bear hug. “Shhh, calm down,” Sherlock whispered into his ear. “You’re alright, you’re alright.” The Dom sat down in the chair and pulled John into sit sideways in his lap so the boy’s side was tucked against Sherlock’s chest and his feet hung over the man’s thighs.
“What’s wrong, kid?” David asked, lifting John’s hood up so it sat on top of the younger Sub’s head.
“I understand. The Doctor’s say we can take you home tonight. However, I thought you might do with some company while you wait.” John quirked an eyebrow at the statement, looking towards the door, but not willing to move any other muscles for fear of tugging on his collar.
John had become quite skillful at giving head, but Sherlock’s cock was larger than average, making it difficult for him to take it all the way into his throat. This, however, did not stop Sherlock from trying every time. It started off slow, John using his hand to stroke as he sucked on the head. Until finally, Sherlock grabbed the short blonde hairs on John’s head and started to buck into his mouth harshly. “That’s it, John. Take me,” he growled down at him, his face flush as he neared completion.
John shook his head, hoping the thoughts would fling out of his ears and onto the tile floor, where he would then proceed to stomp on them. He dried off and only then realized he didn’t bring any clothes in with him, which meant he was going to have to go back into the room wet, in a towel…with Sherlock waiting for him.
Without hesitation, John grabbed the laptop away from Sherlock and leaned back, setting it on his lap so they both could see what he was typing.
A big thanks to TPurr for her beta skills on this chapter. I did change a few things after I sent it to her, so all mistakes are mine.
“Umm,” Greg said, wide eyed as he pulled his throat away from Sherlock. “I guess calf. It’ll be easier to hide.”
“What is it?!” Sherlock snapped at him, squinting when the sun glared at him. A black silhouette came into view, eclipsing the sun enough for Sherlock to adjust his eyes.
The drive was rather pleasant once he got out of London and the thoughts of seeing his John’s face kept the raging war in his mind calm. He pulled up to the front of the shopping Centre and didn’t even try to hide the moan that escaped his lips. He checked his phone.
The boy rubbed a shaky hand over his face, trying desperately to get the room to stop spinning. “John?” Sherlock’s voice grabbed a hold of him while hands on his shoulders offered a pleasant weight to keep him from spinning out of control. “You’re alright, love, just breathe for me. That’s it, you’re just having a bit of a panic but I’m here, I won’t let go of you.”
“Why did you run into a burning building and drag me out? Why?” His eyes seemed ablaze with the fury created from not being able to understand John’s actions.
“Sherlock, are you okay? You don’t look so good,” John said, rubbing his wrist as soon as it was released. The vampire looked truly worried about him, wish oddly made Sherlock feel a heated coal growing inside his belly.
John had tried to kill himself twice after that night at Mycroft’s house. It didn’t turn out well, in fact, John was pretty certain he had screwed himself over even more by his stupidity.
Realizing even though John was a vital part of their overall mission, Irene still realized he was only sixteen years old and cut him some slack. “We believe Mycroft Holmes is having an explicit relationship with one of his subordinates. You need to find out if there is any validity to these allegations and if we can use it against him.”
When Sherlock was secure in a hospital bed and having his blood drawn, Mycroft was able to take a calming breath. He truly didn’t know what to do. Of course he would do whatever was necessary to keep his brother safe, but what was the best option eluded the elder Holmes. He carded a hand through Sherlock’s hair, surprised when the young man’s eyes snapped opened and glared at him.
“Just breathe, okay John? If you start to hyperventilate, then it won’t be so funny,” Sherlock sprawled out next to him and began kissing along his neck, bringing a shiver down his spine and removing more air from his lungs.
“That will work for a while,” John said, “but I can’t teach Sherlock how to not kill his prey with bags of blood. I can take him out hunting –”
“No, that makes since. Thank you, this…umm, well this is my first beer. Actually no, I accidentally took a sip of my mom’s once ‘cause I thought it was Root Beer, but I spit it out before I swallowed it.”
“You know,” Sherlock smiled, which was not the reaction John was hoping for. He pulled out an alcohol wipe and dabbed his gently onto the Sub’s bleeding knuckles. “For someone who was shaking in fear not ten minutes ago because he thought I was going to rape him, you make a lot of sexual references.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“You’re bloody insane!” John yelled, trying to keep his jaw from hanging wide open. “What if the council finds out? What if- what if-”
John turned his back to the wall, which allowed him to see both men closing in on him. He felt like a wild animal being backed into a corner. The only problem was, though, that even if he did lash out, there was no way he could escape two grown Doms. No, he was done for but he had to try, he wouldn’t let them think he was just a pet who would roll over and die.
“Yes, one of us is going to feed you, John,” Mycroft said, sitting back down and scooting his chair closer to the table. “Make your decision now. Then, crawl over, kneel, and wait for one of your Masters to feed you. You have ten seconds to choose. Ten.”
“They won’t, no one has ever loved me like Sherlock,” John knew this to be true. In his whole life he had never even seen somebody with the intensity Sherlock could focus on people.
“Come, you’ll see, everything will be fine.” Sherlock grabbed his arm and lead him to the front door where Mycroft was waiting, umbrella in hand.
It only took a perfect swirl of John’s cold tongue around the head of Sherlock’s cock and the blunt nails scratching down his side for the vampire to come with a shout. He pulsed four times into his sire’s mouth, the last being sucked out of him greedily. With a whimper from Sherlock and a loud wet pop from John’s mouth, the young vampire’s cock fell limp and glistening between his legs.
“I’m okay, John,” Molly said, sounding years older than her small body should’ve allowed. “I like Greg, he’s nice to me. But I miss you and J-“
“Ah, DI Donovan,” Sherlock greeted and John could tell it was the fake sentiment he used when he hated someone. “This is John, he’s studying to be a Doctor. I thought it would be perfect for him to get some field experience.”
“You haven’t lost that much blood,” John said, picking Greg up bridal style and placing him on the couch. “Luckily, Sherlock had no idea what he was doing, so it was more just an aggressive reaction than an actual feeding. I’ll get you some orange juice,” he said patting Greg on the bare thigh. Although he would never mistreat a human, other than taking a few sips, Greg was still a hunter of his kind, so he didn’t feel too much pity for the man. He was a doctor first and a vampire second though, and John would make sure Greg was in full health before he left.
“What are you planning to do different this time, vampire?” Mycroft asked, using the word ‘vampire’ as an insult.
“My apologies, poor choice of words,” Greg said and again, for some reason, John thought he was being genuine. “You used to be a part of the gang, their leader even.” This time it wasn’t a question, which made John realize Molly must have told him everything already.
The car finally came to a stop, and Sherlock was the first to get out. It felt stuffy inside the car, like he couldn’t breathe.
“Do what?” John said, the petulance in his voice showing just how much of a teenager he actually was.
“It is obvious Subs cannot control themselves. Half of the Rebels have already died from the overdose of bliss in their system. All because this Irene woman told them it was okay to create their own bliss! It is not right and there is no way in hell anyone is going to agree to that, especially Doms.”
“And how are you going to do that, hmm? Blow up more buildings and kill more innocent people?” John had completely forgotten about his neck, causing an aching pain to linger around the spot where the doctors had removed his collar. The young Sub was furious, at Irene, and at himself for believing the Sub Resistance was able to save Subs.
It was obvious by the look on the man’s face that he felt sorry for John. Even though Greg was trained to kill vampires, he couldn’t help but feel some compassion for the creature on the bed. Sherlock did too, of course, he wasn’t a monster. It was his curiosity though, that trumped all, and John was just too much of an anomaly to let go.
“My God,” Mycroft whispered to himself, as he gazed at the dilated pupils with only a thin ring of silver bordering the blackness.
Memories of the kennels flashed through his mind. Tombstones, skinny, dirty bodies, and God awful whines were enough to make his eyes burn with tears again. John nodded his head, looking at the milky brown tea in his hand.
“We still need to report it, especially if these lunatics are still gallivanting around trashing private property,” Mycroft said, pulling the phone away from his ear to dial another number.
“That is wonderful Johnny! I’m so pleased with you, goodness I need to call Bethany and let her know. I wonder how her boy did, what is his name, Mike?”
John felt a burst of ecstasy as he simultaneously came inside Sherlock and bit his neck. His hips jerked as he unloaded himself, making Sherlock his. Sherlock grunted and came while John stroked him through it. He only took little sips, even though he wanted to take the whole thing. John knew this morsel of delicious blood was much too precious to be used up in one bite.
John stood up, leaving his crutch behind, and hobbled over to the closed door. He knocked a few times. “Sherlock? Sherlock, are you okay?” When no answer came, John opened the door to a large bathroom with white and blue tiled walls. There was a stand up glass shower with silver trim and a big bath tub standing on four lion’s feet. Sherlock was sitting in the tub with a mound full of bubble surrounding him.
With one hand splayed out over Sherlock’s belly and the other lining himself up, John pushed forward. Lava seemed to consume his cock as the burning tight heat enveloped him. A low possessive growl came from John throat as he lowered his hand to start stroking Sherlock. There were little twitches around his cock with every jerk of Sherlock’s.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, examining every micro-expression. “Liar,” he said, narrowing his eyes.
He was safe in that moment, safe and free of any worries because Sherlock knew what John had done wrong, and now he was being punished for it.
The woman merely gave him a sad smile and stood up. “John,” she said, her voice kind, as if talking to a child, “while I appreciate your idealistic youth, your naiveté will not help us win this war.”
“Yeah, alright, I promise,” Greg said, trailing behind Sherlock as they made their way to the second floor.
“You believe? YOU BELIEVE!” Greg shouted, throwing his glass against the corner. Amber liquid and shards of crystal smashed and scattered across the floor. “You didn’t see the look in that kid’s eyes, Mycroft! John Watson doesn’t exist anymore, Sherlock made sure of that and all you can say is ‘I believe she’s trying to help him.’ Bloody hell, I’m done,” the DI said and stood up.
“You were working for them the whole time, weren’t you?” Jim asked him, his eyes filling with anger and tears.
“Like hell I will!” John said, picking up his plate and fork. Before he could shovel the first bite of sausage into his mouth, Mycroft snapped his fingers. Confused, John looked up from the plate in his hand and stared at Mycroft.
“As long as you wash your hands before you start cooking. The tomato soup smelled like formaldehyde yesterday,” John laughed then squealed when Sherlock abruptly picked him up and walked him over to the sofa. When he set the boy down, he bent forward taking John into a deep dominating kiss until the teen sat breathless.
“F-Fuck you,” John was able to get out, his defiance weak from the pain and the humiliation that he was forced to put the collar on himself.
John thought to himself, grabbing a loaf of bread and throwing it into the basket. All Sherlock wanted was John…
With a smile on his face, John opened his mouth to take the entire piece into his mouth. An ‘mmm’ sound made its way out of the Sub’s mouth as he chewed the delicious food. He closed his eyes and pressed his head up against Sherlock’s shoulder, feeling warm and calm. In turn, Sherlock placed his cheek against the side of John’s head, pressing his lips to the boy’s scalp. “You don’t need your own bliss,” he whispered, “you just need to be taken care of.”
John wiped away the tears from his face when Mycroft came into the room. He waited for the Dom to say some smart comment, but it never came. Mycroft actually looked…
Slowly, John worked Sherlock’s hardness into his mouth. As he moved his head up and down, cold hands worked their way over Sherlock’s inner thighs and flank. Somehow, John knew exactly where Sherlock was most sensitive. And he took advantage of it.
John rubbed his legs together to mimic jogging and understood how they could eventually become annoying.
John tried to sit up to examine his body and make sure his limbs where not cut off, like in his dream, but only wrapped in casts. However, his small body gave a slight jerk, then every muscle tried to go back to sleep, ignoring the commands his brain gave them to move. “Shh shh shh, it’s alright,” the voice was closer to his ear this time and when John turned his head back to face Sherlock, he was met with a soft kiss.
“Yes, I, umm, my Dom was shot and well…I haven’t seen him in a while, and…” John looked down, trying to act bashful even though he was giving himself a high-five for his amazing acting performance.
“What…oh God, how did you-?” he still felt the over fullness and burning from the two fingers but the shock wave of pleasure every time Sherlock hit something inside him trumped all.
He sat on his couch, his knees pulled up to his chest, shivering as his body metabolized the drugs. Sweat made his forehead shine and his palms slippery as he wringed them together. Sherlock needed John, needed the man to drink from him while they…
“I’m sorry, Mike-“ his voice pleading but it didn’t do any good. Without another word, he ran, leaving the food behind as tears ran down his face, which were most likely from hurt pride at giving in so easily to a Sub’s command. “Fuck, Harry, Jim go after him, would ya? I’ll carry Molly back to the Pipes…” John looked over at Jim for the first time since they’d left the house. The teen’s dark eyes where wide with panic as he looked down at both empty hands, hands that were not holding onto the little girl’s. “Jim!”
“Ahh,” he heard Sherlock gasp, but John wrapped his hand around the vampire’s sleeve and tugged him towards the cottage.
Suddenly, John’s body moved on instinct to walk over and kneel beside Mycroft’s bed. He pressed the top of his head against the Dom’s hip, while his face lay comfortably on the mattress. Why he was in this position, John had no idea, but somewhere deep inside him it felt right; especially when a hand rested on the side of his head, rubbing a thumb over his ear and short sideburns.
Sherlock snickered under his breath, only stopping when Mycroft looked at him over John’s head. “Loyalty, John,” Sherlock said, squeezing John’s arm.
The first time, John had discovered drain cleaner under the sink while he was fixing up Sherlock’s outrageously dirty flat. The thought ignited quicker than flint striking steel and he grabbed the bottle, slamming the bathroom door shut in an attempt to buy him some time before Sherlock found him. It was water that flowed into his belly though, no poison to eat away at his insides, he had Sherlock for that after all. The detective was standing outside the door when John came out of the bathroom. He didn’t even fight Sherlock when he tied the boy up with rope, shoulder to toe, for three days.
“So what are you going to do to stop him?” John asked, lifting his head up slightly to peer down at the detective. He hesitated, knowing the only way to catch him was to lure Jim here but was unwilling to accept the amount of danger that would put John in. “I’ll be okay, Sherlock. I trust you…I know you’ll protect me.”
“If you aren’t going to put them in yourself, then I will. Now hold still,” John took two long strides over to the couch, straddling Sherlock’s thin hips and placed a gentle hand on brown curls to hold his head in place.
“So that makes it okay?” John asked, sitting up, but regretting it the minute he felt dizziness wash over him.
“Get undressed,” the voice said and John’s eyes traveled from the bobbing Adam’s apple all the way down a pale lightly haired chest, to a taught stomach and then to a darker trail of hair leading down to…
“Good.” Sherlock absentmindedly stroked a hand though John’s hair before he went over and picked up the bagel. He held it to John’s lips. The teen looked at him wearily for a moment, feeling the leather rub against his skin. Deciding he was more hungry than angry, John took a bite, which was washed down by a big swig of milk that Sherlock brought to his lips.
Stumbling, Sherlock fell out of the room and started heading down the hallway. He could smell everything, the antiseptic, the disease, and most of all, the blood. His fangs actually ached with so much blood near by.
The boy shook his head, trying to go in for a kiss but was held back by the hands on his shoulders. Soft lips rose up to touch his ear and whispered, “I want you inside me.”
“Sherlock, please, not like this,” John tried to beg, because when your hog tied in the air you’re willing to try anything to get down.
“Sherlock, I won’t…I won’t do anything stupid,” John tried to focus but he could feel the heat gathering his belly and his muscles tighten in anticipation of the inevitable. “I just…I just want-“
Molly watched the two men looking at each other with little smiles on their faces. It made her happy that Mycroft came over, not just for the chocolate, but because Greg always seemed to be happier when the red haired man was around. Molly smiled along with them as she ate her delicious sandwich, in a warm home, with comfy pajamas, and a kind new family.
“Very well,” Mycroft nodded, just as they pulled up to a rather large stone built cottage. John was expecting some wooden cabin that barely had running water. But this, this was just amazing. “The League will know nothing of this. They will simply think Sherlock ran off to live a life on his own.”
The second time was a bit rougher, John recalled, waiting obediently on his stomach for Sherlock to return. Sherlock had spent every waking hour with John, working from home and allowing John to continue most of his education online until he could be trusted to go back to the hospital. Apparently, a letter from Mycroft Holmes can accomplish anything, even when it comes to Universities and rule bending. However, the morning that John got the idea, Sherlock was forced to leave the flat to visit a crime scene. Little did the young man know, as he broke the window in their room and held it to his femoral artery, when one Holmes was unable to watch him, the other was waiting on deck just outside the bars of his cage.
“John! John, is that you?” Jim shouted. John felt someone slide in next to him, making him cringe as his out-of-socket shoulder was jostled.
John jumped for a moment, startled at being asked a question. Doing as instructed, he looked up at Sherlock, who nodded.
John gave a weak hiss towards the two men who picked him up and carried him out of the room. Mycroft watched them leave, then turned his attention back to Sherlock. The young man was trying to crawl off his bed, towards the exit. Mycroft rolled his eyes and motioned for Greg to help him find some clothes to cover up the naked man.
“As I said, John is still very confused and trying to unravel the knots you tied so intricately around his mind.”
“But…” John thought for a moment. It wasn’t right, it wasn’t the collar, it was the bliss that he created that helped him get Sherlock to safety. They were asking him to lie, and for what? To sell their little collars.
With fourteen bold printed words, John’s happy world crumbled in around him and this time, he didn’t know if even Sherlock could keep him from being crushed into a million pieces.
Jim thought back to the scary lady threatening him, and the big guy who tried to drag him to medical to take his collar off. “I-Irene wanted to, erm…wanted to know who Mycroft was, erm…sleeping with,” Jim said, turning bright red.
“If you refuse to help the FBI with their cold cases like Mycroft instructed, at least go sit out on the terrace, Sherlock,” Anthea called from the small room she’d turned into an office. “His plane just landed and he will be very unhappy if he purchased this vacation home in Florida and you still give a ghost a run for its money,” she said, never looking up from her laptop.
“That’ll do it,” John said, patting the man’s arm. “Alright, you stay here and I’m going to go grab some supplies. Don’t run off, now, someone needs to take care of that before it gets infected.” John gave the young man a wink and ran upstairs to his flat.
“Stand up, Lestrade,” a familiar voice said behind him. It was strong and confident, and Greg knew he stood absolutely zero chance in getting Sherlock and Mycroft out alive. Most likely, three of his fellow Hunters had Tasers aimed at his back. “Don’t make this any harder on yourself.”
“Now why would I want to do that, when I’ve got my delicious looking Doctor all wrapped up for me?” Sherlock asked, his eye growing wide. He Slowly walked over to John, his robe swishing behind him, which John soon realized was the only thing Sherlock was wearing. He placed his cheek against John’s bare thigh and rubbed his slight stubble against the soft white flesh. “You smell so good John,” he said, lowering his head and sniffing at John’s crotch.
“What is that supposed to mean,” Sherlock joked as he nudged his shoulder, trying to calm the boy’s nerves. John’s hands looked pale and were shaking slightly, bringing Sherlock to drape a possessive and protective arm around the boy’s shoulders.
“Games?” Sherlock asked, offended by such a statement. “Oh no, John, we won’t be playing games here. You will be on a strict routine, as to insure all my tests are as accurate as possible. You will feed from me-”
Greg slowly walked closer, the smell becoming stronger and exciting Sherlock even more. The vampire hissed and strained his neck towards the human.
“Oh Sherlock, don’t be like that, I’m sure your Johnny is the most specialist of them all,” the grin on his face turned so wide it looked like a warped cartoon character.
Suddenly, he stiffened when Sherlock’s face started moving closer while the hand on his cheek kept him from pulling back. His lips grazed over John’s lightly and they both let out a small moan at the contact. He had kissed a girl once before but hated it when she jabbed her tongue in his mouth, causing her thick make up to smear all over his face. This, however, was so gentle and the hand on his face was comforting, making the boy want to stay in this position forever.
Hello again! Wow, thank you so much to everyone who has commented and left kudos for this fic. I appreciate all the kind words in the comments, they really make my day(: Also, thank you to the people that have pointed out any errors, I will get to those as soon as I can and I apologize in advance it they interfere with your enjoyment of the story.
“Calm down, John, we’re not going to hurt you,” a man said. His voice sounded gentle and sincere, but anybody who could blow up a building was neither of those things.
“Well nothing really, unless things turn south. Sherlock will still help the Yard with its cases and everything will be normal, save for my brother’s more appropriate behavior, which I’m sure you will appreciate.”
“Okay, thanks mum, love ya!” With that, the boy kissed his mom on the cheek and ran upstairs more confident than ever. He jumped on his bed and started texting Sherlock.
“I said I wouldn’t, so I won’t. At least not for a week,” Greg said, heading towards the exit. “Be careful here, Sherlock. You don’t know what a hungry animal is capable of.”
The boy had never even thought about being washed by another person before. It was a shower, you got in, you got out, that was it but knowing how gentle Sherlock’s hands would be with washing his body sent chills through him and down to his spent groin. “No, I mean, yeah, I mean, sure I would like that.”
“No,” Sherlock said, maybe a tad too quickly. He had had enough of this waiting, damn it. Sherlock needed John’s teeth on him, now! Sherlock reached for the half full glass of water on the table and smashed it on the wood, leaving a big broken piece in his hand. He quickly turned his back to John and sliced a gash at the top and inner part of his thigh, right next to his crotch.
John hadn’t even realized he was trembling. Even when he tried to stop, his body seemed to shake even harder. His eyes darted around for an escape, only to find none. John had heard of miracles but in all his sixteen years had never experienced one until a knock at the door saved him from the approaching man. However, it appeared he would have to wait for another saving grace when the voice at the door shouted, “IBAD patrol.”
“What?!” Sherlock asked around the bag, shocked and gleeful at the idea of a human with warm blood and weak muscles coming into their territory.
He stripped completely, still not used to sleeping in pajamas and curled up, holding his pillow tightly to his chest. It wasn’t enough and tears started welling up in his eyes at the coldness he felt on his back. Then, John grabbed his covers and rolled himself up in them, creating a cocoon like effect that would keep him wrapped tightly. If he closed his eyes real tight, he could feel a warm breath ghosting over his neck but it wasn’t enough and John began to cry silently, digging his face into the pillow that only smelled like him and detergent.
Though he was mildly intrigued by this new turn of events, Sherlock had his own plans to draft and he was sure even the poor excuses for computer forensic scientists at the Yard would be able to find the common thread eventually. For now, though, he knew just how to use the situation to pull John all the way back into his arms for good. By the time John awoke for the day to come, Sherlock had two solid plans to ensure John would be at peace and finally accept his place by Sherlock’s side.
John, on the other hand, just stayed on his back, but the one thing Mycroft did note, was that the boy had his arms wrapped tightly around Sherlock’s as it lay on his ribs. The eldest Holmes watched the two boys for a moment, noticing how young they both were. Sherlock had barely broken twenty, and John was but a mere sixteen. They were both too young to be put through such trauma. They would have to though, Mycroft knew, if things were going to change for the better.
“Because I’m alone,” that…that was not what he’d expected, “and Sherlock’s alone.” Now that was most unexpected. After everything he knew, John still worried about Sherlock being in pain.
“In their eyes, you are, John,” Sherlock said, sympathetically. “Option two, which is Mycroft’s and my idea, is to use these collars to send bliss directly through the Sub’s defenses. All we have to do is locate their opening, like the one on your back, and then program the collar to send a small wave of bliss to make the Sub more pliable.” Sherlock’s eyes sparkled as he told John their master plan.
“Sherlock,” his contact yelled. The homeless man, who really didn’t look like a homeless man at all, was sitting by a tree just outside the skate park entrance. “How are you?”
“No ma’am,” he shook his head, but there was a smile on his face. He brought over a plate with a peanut butter and banana sandwich. “You can have some tomorrow for a snack after lunch - no, no pouty lips, you know that doesn’t work on me.”
The first order of business was to construct the suicide note of one John Hamish Watson, age fourteen. Ever since he was a boy in year two of primary school, Sherlock had become a master at handwriting forgery; stemming mainly from having to forge his mother or father’s signature or parent note when he got into trouble or didn’t want to participate in one of the school’s ridiculous field trips or projects. Now, he was able to copy any form of handwriting to the letter as long as there was a proper example for him to use. Luckily, there were at least a dozen forms with every character lying on their coffee table, all written by John.
“Oh, uhhh…hey?” A long silence held for a few moments and then they both started laughing at the awkward situation.
John felt something inside him break, something similar to when he was a boy and he found out he wasn’t going to see Sherlock for ten years. Except this time, instead of tears and sorrow, John felt anger boil up inside him as the small fountain began to gush with the black tar Sherlock had fed him over the past six months.
“Alright, that’s enough, you bleedin’ idiots,” Greg shouted at the people spewing questions at them. “Can’t you see his Sub is sleeping?”
It was strange, but the hospital seemed empty. They didn’t pass anyone as they walked down hallway after hallway. It didn’t make sense until Mycroft spoke up. “Good Job, Gregory.”
Although the thought of John hurting himself sent out painful barbs in his heart and mind, Sherlock knew it was for the best. Plus, it was the teenager’s fault. “If you would have just listened to me like you were supposed to, then none of this would have happened, hmm?” He chided the sleeping boy, poking him playfully on his little button nose. The moment replayed in his mind over and over, running through the brand new scenario he had come up with in the ten seconds John tried to run away from their home. “If you won’t let me take care of you,” he whispered fondly into his stubborn boy’s ear, “then I’ll just have to make you.”
“I just want to go outside again,” he was finally able to say, “please.” Sherlock was looking down, rubbing and playing with John’s slowly waning length. He balanced and weighed it in his hand, pulling the foreskin back, almost mesmerized by the piece of flesh. “Sherlock?” John groaned, feeling the oversensitive skin scream to be left alone.
Within a half a second, adrenaline shot through the Sub, clearing any post Sub-drop haze. He was thrown back into his childhood home, hearing his parents shouting at each other and at Harry while he hid under his covers, clutching his stuffed dog tightly to his chest. Not wanting to lose himself, John shook his head and punched the wall, letting the pain in his knuckles bring him back to the here and now, where he wasn’t a scared weak little boy.
He slowly crept down the stairs, listening intently for footsteps from either his people or the owners of the house.
“I’m close, John,” Sherlock breathed. He pressed his forehead to the center of John’s back and gripped a few blonde strands in his fist as his hips began to lose their rhythm. He squeezed and pulled on John’s cock and hit the man’s prostate a few times and John was a slave to his body. He shot off, clenching around the large mass inside him and throwing come onto the floor below him.
Sherlock knew he had already won over John’s heart and body but know he possessed the boy’s mind as well. He was truly ‘his’ John now and that simple fact made the man harder than a rock just thinking about his complete and utter possession of the most beautiful thing in the world. The boy had not only sent him a picture of the most gorgeous young cock without him even asking but he had also decided they should meet all on his own. This was it, the final act in the play the detective had written for the two lovers and it would earn a standing ovation.
Hello again! Thanks to everyone who commented and left kudos on the last chapter, I really appreciate it(:
John grinned at her, knowing this couldn’t be true and she was just a paid actress; a very convincing actress, but one nonetheless. “Okay, ‘Miss Adler,’” John made air quotes with his hands and laced her name with condensation. “How do you even know who I am?’”
“Oh, is that so, my little Doctor?” Sherlock grinned as he grabbed the hem of John’s shirt and pulled it up to expose his belly. “Because I think you were so terrified I’d left you that you didn’t know what to do with yourself.” Slowly, Sherlock undid John’s belt and started on his zip. “But I know what to do with you, John,” Sherlock said, palming John’s semi hard cock through his trousers.
“Shhh,” he whispered into the soft hair, stroking John’s back in slow circles and waiting until the loud sobs turned into quite sniffling.
John took a moment, picturing Sherlock holding him in bed, rubbing his hand over his belly, calming him. With his body filled with bliss and absolutely zero fear, John jumped through the flames, not feeling as they touched his skin. Sherlock was lying passed out on the floor, his face black with smoke. “I’ve got you, it’s alright,” John repeated what Sherlock always told him.
John groaned, and tried to roll over until sharp pain shot through his shoulder. It had been dislocated and there was no way he could put it back in socket with his restraints still on. “Sherlock!” John shouted at the unconscious man next to him. “Mycroft!” he tried, but the eldest Holmes was nowhere to be seen.
“Come on, Sherlock, we’re going to put you under this sheet for a bit. You’ll be fine. I’m right here with you, yeah,” John said, putting a white sheet over Sherlock. He could barely see the shadows of figures as the cloth was over his eyes, but he could feel the presence of two humans and one vampire, his sire. John put his arms around the tall vampire and led him out of the room and down a hallway.
The confusion and shock on Greg’s face was interrupted by a loud bang as Sherlock threw the door open dramatically. “John! Thank God!” he said, taking two long strides to end up by John’s other side. He gently ran his hand over the gauze, the anger and sadness clear in his eyes.
“No?” Sherlock said smoothly, a sly grin coming to his face. Unexpectedly, the man put a hand on John’s chest and leaned down to let his lips hover over the cold ones below him. Sherlock licked gently at John, trying to tease him into opening.
“Perhaps you will only need this lesson once,” Sherlock pointed his finger at John’s face, tapping the leather muzzle, “do not bite the hand that feeds you, literally or figuratively.” Sherlock smiled at this, no doubt basking in the fact that his brother almost lost a finger.
“I want to call Mycroft,” John said, his tone sterner than the detective thought was possible. Even though the fierce look on the boy’s face looked adorable, what with his tiny nose and the lines trying to form on his brow, Sherlock kept a serious face as he stared back him. His brother was the last option, Sherlock decided, it would be best to try and defuse the situation on his own. If Mycroft got involved now, he would be checking in every week and possibly have one of his minions act as surveillance for the couple.
“Thank you,” Sherlock smiled, deciding he was thankful for John’s innovativeness because his ears were really starting to inhibit him from doing his experiments. “However, I do believe you have started something that we cannot finish now.”
John looked down at his hospital gown that was now soaked with sweat and smelled faintly of throw up. Not only was it nasty, it offered little to shield him from the wind, so John scurried up the entrance and into the warm house. The Sub shook his head and limbs a bit, trying to get the blood back into them before he told Mycroft what was going to happen.
“Open up for me, John, my beautiful John. I need in, let me in,” Sherlock whispered as John finally listened and opened up to allow the full three fingers. It was so tight and hot, the detective couldn’t imagine what it was going to be like to have his cock inside of John, letting the boy hold him. He stroked his fingers in time with the thrusts of his hips, waiting and revving up like a race car at a pit stop, preparing for their final piece of the puzzle. Finally, he pulled out his fingers, taking his achingly hard cock in his hand and lining up for home. “Are you ready to be mine, John?” Although, it did seem pointless to ask looking at the position they were both in at that second, but he wanted his boy to be ready to feel every inch of him.
I am deeply sorry for the delay in this chapter. RL has reared its ugly head and for some reason, I just wasn't feeling motivated. Anyways, I hope you enjoy and I'm going to try my darnedest to get a chapter out every week until the end. Unbeta'ed, so please forgive the mistakes.
“Good morning,” a deep voice rumbled from near his chest. When John looked down, he saw the man who had taken his virginity staring up at him with a wide sleepy smile. Sherlock had one lanky arm sprawled over John’s bare stomach, while the other was snug under the small back and his messy brown curls cascaded over his chest. It was comforting to know he hadn’t been abandoned after last night, ensuring him that the older man’s agenda was not to shag and flee with some kid he’d found on the internet.
“Sh sh sh,” Sherlock hushed him as he placed the head of his cock between John’s cheeks. “It will all be over…well, I won’t lie to you john, this isn’t going to be over soon.” With that, Sherlock began to press forward, his hands holding John’s hips so he wouldn’t swing forward. Sherlock smacked one cheek hard, then squeezed it as his cock finally popped inside. He gave a loud sigh, as if he had finally arrived home from a long day’s work.
John slowly ran his tongue over the gash, unconsciously rubbing Sherlock’s stomach with his hand. Once it was closed up, John followed the line that had trickled down farther. Sherlock could feel the breath on his crotch, making his whole body shiver. When John was done, he didn’t leave, he only stayed there and began nudging Sherlock through his pants.
John shoved the girl into Greg’s arms and turned on his heel faster than he thought possible. Ready to stab whoever snuck up behind him, John pulled his arm back to swing at the tall figure.
Being thankful for all the running, climbing, and sneaking that came with being a thief was something John never considered until now. He was in the far corner of Mycroft’s office, his back straight against the wall while his hips went out at a ninety degree angle and his feet were planted firmly on the ground. John knew he looked ridiculous trying to sit in midair and he also realized that’s what Mycroft wanted. The Dom thought he was just some little kid playing games and would soon crumble as soon as a little humiliation or pain came into play.
“I know,” was all the detective said before lying his lover into bed and curling around him, protecting him from anybody who would try to hurt him. The warm body next to him was rigid for only ten point nine seconds and then melted into their spooning position with a sigh. He couldn’t help the promise that escaped his lips, “I’m never going to let you go.” John was the most euphoric drug he’d ever had and the best part was he never ran out of ‘John.’ Sure, the teenager wouldn’t understand at first, but that was okay because he had Sherlock to watch out for him now.
“Oh,” Sherlock continued to look up at the ceiling as if he could find the words he needed. “Then, sorry,” he said, his tone a bit sad. Then, he rolled over so his back was facing John.
Underestimating how much the detective did not want the drops; John lost his balance and toppled on to the ground to get away from the flailing form below him. “Damn it Sherlock,” John shouted as he hit the floor with a loud thud but thankfully keeping his hand up right and saving the liquid from spilling. “I’m trying to help you, here. Do you want to go deaf?”
“Shhh shhh,” Sherlock cooed, reaching behind him for a cup of water. He propped up John’s head slightly and held the glass to the dry lips, “there you go, just little sips, yeah. That’s it,” he praised when slurping noises echoed through the room. When he’d had enough, Sherlock placed his head gently back down on the pillow and put the cup back. “How are you feeling, John? Any pain?”
After his last bite, John shook his head, trying to clear away the relaxation that Sherlock so expertly surrounded him in. He looked over at Mycroft who was staring at him intently. “When…” John swallowed, his tongue feeling lazy. “When can I talk to Greg? The Rebels…they’re getting away.”
The little girl, dressed in a purple nightgown, was sitting on the same couch the man was sitting on the night before. Her legs tucked up under her as she watched some cartoon on the telly and munched happily on an apple.
He couldn’t move quick enough, and the next thing he knew Sebastian was lying dead on the floor and John was motionless in front of him. “John!” Sherlock screamed, his voice reaching a pitch he didn’t know was possible as he felt his entire soul shatter. He ran over and knelt by John, picking him up in his arms to examine the gushing wound on his shoulder. The bullet had gone clean through on the opposite side of the ‘SH.’
It was two o’clock in the morning when John was startled awake by a searing pain just above his left shoulder blade. His eyes flew open in panic while his hands and feet scrambled to get away from whatever was piercing his back. A loud scream, sounding nothing like his voice, echoed from John’s throat when a heavy weight on his back kept him locked, belly down, on to the bed. “Sherlock!” Were the first words out of the youth’s mouth, praying that the only man who could save him from this torture wasn’t the cause all along.
The eldest Holmes stood up quickly, ready to do something worse than press the button. Suddenly, John felt something yank on the waist of pants hard enough to force him to fall back on the couch. “What the fuck!” He shouted at Sherlock, who looked rather unfazed by John’s tantrum, which made the teenager even more angry.
“Oh…okay,” was all John could get out as the blood in his brain rushed to tend to the stirring in his lower body.
John sighed at the words, trying to fall back asleep and still praying for that tiny chance that this was all just a nightmare. The problem was though, he wasn’t sure what the real nightmare was anymore; being alone crying in a shower, jumping of a bridge, being tied up in rope so he wouldn’t hurt himself, or lying next to a warm body that he knew would take care of him. It was all one massive ball of confusing thoughts and feelings making the line to distinguish reality impossible for John to find.
It was hard going down the stairs, especially when they cracked and creaked with every move. He finally made it to the bottom though, and limped through the front door. Throwing Sherlock’s body onto the snowy grass, John lowered himself to his knees and hovered over Sherlock. He patted the man’s cheek. “Come on, Sherlock. Wake up now, we’re safe.”
John had to fight another bout of laughter at the thought of the strict Dom having…explicit relationships with anybody but his own hand, and even that was amusing to John’s teenage mind. “Alright, umm, I think I can do that,” told her.
John’s jaw stayed slack from the slight pain still coursing through his nerves. Taking advantage, Sherlock placed his finger on John’s lower fangs, testing the sharpness. “Alright, go ahead,” was all Sherlock said, holding a vial up to John’s top teeth.
“Your prostate John, don’t they teach you anything in health class these days?” He tugged on the full bullocks in his hands, wondering briefly what they would taste like.
“You were hiding under the covers when Sherlock shot him, John, he already told us what happened,” Greg said again, his voice harsher than before. John scrunched his nose up, shaking his head and trying desperately to figure out why Sherlock would have lied for him.
“It’s your brother Sir, Sherlock, he’s on the hunt again,” she spoke quickly but her tone was higher than normal.
Sherlock sat there for a long while, acting as a pillow for his John to rest on and recuperate from the hour’s trying events. Finally, he grabbed the phone out of his pocket and added Jim’s new number to the memory, praying he would never have to call for help again. The mobile vibrated slightly and Sherlock checked to make sure it hadn’t woken up John. Satisfied with the closed eyes and lax features, he checked the screen for the incoming text.
“Good boy, that’s it,” Sherlock cooed in his ear, feeling how the hard cock twitched at the praise. “Come for me John, come while I’m inside of you,” he growled, becoming lost in the sensation of thrusting in and out of the tightness. “Come on, show me you love me John, show me,” his hips bucking harsher, showing John how much he was being possessed, forcing the come out of him.
“What?” Greg asked, his voice going up an octave. Jim shrugged his shoulders, remembering what John had promised her if she let Jim go.
“You’re alright, you’re alright. We’re out of the sun,” John said, pulling off their sheets and settling Sherlock by his side. It was a large car with wide seats facing each other, and tinted windows. Mycroft and Greg sat on one side, while Sherlock and John sat huddled on the other. “Greg,” John demanded, holding out his hand.
“Sherlock, you have to put them in, if you don’t the infection will only get worse. Now, quit behaving like a child!” John had one hand on his hip with the other holding up a bottle of prescription ear drops, glaring at his stubborn husband, who was huddled up on the couch. It had taken John five days to talk, well…more like force, Sherlock into going to see an Otolaryngologist. The final straw was when John had asked him what he wanted for dinner the night before. No answer came and then the blonde realized he wasn’t being ignored by the detective, which was usually the case, but Sherlock actually couldn’t hear him.
John’s eyes closed automatically when heat spread from that one point of contact to the rest of his body. He let Sherlock hold him as they kissed, one large hand was rubbing up and down his stomach, causing him to shiver when he felt goose bumps rise under the contact. Every time he tried to move his arm or leg to get closer though, the nagging in the back of his mind grew stronger, bringing memories of how he broke them to the surface and above the lustful fog that covered his body.
They walked up to the front door, Sherlock placing his hand just under John’s collar again, the weight almost familiar now. “Something is wrong,” Sherlock said suddenly.
After a moment, the gash turned into a scrap, then into a tiny scar that the man would hardly even notice. “There we go,” John said to the unconscious man. “In five minutes, I want you to wake up. You won’t remember who I am or what happened to your hand.” John caressed Sherlock’s face, “good luck, mate.” With that, John left him and went upstairs to his flat.
“This way,” Dr. Magnussen said, reaching out his hand to grab the lead from Sherlock, who handed it over reluctantly. With a tight squeeze to the back of his neck and brief eye contact, Sherlock turned his back on John to talk to his furious brother.
Sherlock knew exactly what he was doing, as he shimmied up to sit next to John. He twisted so he was on his back and his head lay in John’s lap. “Bite me,” he said, a mischievous grin on his face.
Jim flinched, unconsciously scooting closer to Greg. “Jim,” Greg said softly. He gave Sherlock a look that didn’t seem to have any effect. “Jim, is there anything you can remember? Anything at all?”
This is the last chapter for this part, so if you want to see what happens next, make sure to sub to the series.
“I’m only a few blocks down the street, get in,” Sherlock commanded, pulling the last string to make the boy’s foot get into the car, and he was rewarded with watching the smiling boy’s head disappear under his eye line of the top of the car and into the front seat. It took five minutes to get to the flat, but they sang ‘Another Brick in the Wall,’ from one of the CDs all the way there.
“I’m sorry,” was all he said, before climbing back down to the street. When he walked back to the front though, John’s heart sank when he saw the cab had left and was replaced by three black vehicles. Sherlock, Greg, and Mycroft were all standing outside, watching John approach.
“Yep, I’m a vampire. Now, could you please convince this git to let me go?” John said, sitting up in the bed. His face looked more pale than normal, but he seemed to still have some spunk left in him.
John spotted a young man, maybe twenty, leaning onto the bar with all his weight. It was obvious the stranger’s legs were too wobbly to hold him up, which would be perfect for John’s plan. With one last gulp of his beer, John stood up and cracked his neck. He walked up to the bar, nodding to the man behind it.
“I hurt you, oh God, I’m sorry John,” he whispered, reaching his hand out to touch the chest but then yanking it back again when the appendage appeared to be covered in that charcoal sickness. It had never been on the outside like this, never, and it bubbled out from his belly button, his eyes, his toe nails, consuming the last bit of light until Sherlock was floating in the abyss of his mind palace.
John nodded, trying to form ‘fuck you’ around the soap but it only came out as a garble and made some of the suds slid down his throat when he swallowed. “Good, then assume the position over in the corner where I can keep an eye on you while I finish up some paper work. Once I think you’ve had enough I will offer you my comfort and remember,” Mycroft put a heavy hand on John’s shoulder, giving him a fake sympathetic smile, “all you have to do is accept it. If not, however, then you will continue to stand in the corner without relief.” John bared his teeth around the soap, both from trying to act angry and to get his lips away from the suds, which were now burning his mouth slightly. “I will not tell you again,” the Dom warned and John finally gave up, reasoning that the punishment could have been a lot worse. For some strange reason though, he thought it would be easier to go up against a whip or paddle then to be left alone in the corner with his thoughts turning on themselves.
If his brother found out about this, there would be hell to pay. Not to mention all of his work would be cast aside and John would be murdered. John was the first innocent vampire he’d met, and Sherlock sure as hell wasn’t about to let anything happen to him. Surly Greg could see that John was different, surely.
The boy didn't know what to say, everything Sherlock had said was focused on him, taking care of him, loving him. John didn’t know what he was supposed to do for the man who talked so sweetly to him. Suddenly, an idea popped in his head and he mumbled a quick, “hold on” over the phone. He pulled up the camera on his mobile and focused the lens on his hard member and took the photo. It didn’t turn out exactly how he wanted but he captured from the tip to his balls so it would have to do. Plus, while he was taking the picture he could hear Sherlock panting and his hands were tied up so he couldn’t wank along with him. He hit send and waited for himself to be judged by the only person whose opinion he cared about.
“Holy crap,” John whispered when he saw a glass box the size of a living room sitting over to the side of the room.
“Sherlock, I said stop, get off me! Ahh, you’re hurting me, please stop!” John moved his hand away from the wall to push the hips away, but was halted when one of Sherlock’s large hands grabbed both of his, holding them hostage above his head against the tile wall. “Let go of me, what ar-ahhh” his voice cracked as he felt himself being penetrated, the burn and stretch was unbelievable, much more painful that the fingers.
“Fine,” he said dismissively. The sooner he got the formalities out of the way, the sooner he could go back to John so they could start their life together in peace. “Do you have the papers?”
“Something like that, yes,” Sherlock said, holding a hand up to John to tell him to lie back down. The vampire stayed ramrod straight for a few more seconds, then slowly sat back down, crossing his legs.
in his steady hands. “Is he…did I?” The gun dropped from his hand and he tucked his knees to his chest, creating a tight ball.
John let out a growl, his teeth descending. He got up on his knees, preparing to fight off the crazy human with all his might.
“Greg said we get to go on vacation after this, well, not a traveling vacation, but he said we can just sit, watch the telly, and eat ice cream all day if we want to.” The smile on Jim’s face lit up the room, making John’s heart ache a bit from being too happy.
“Yeah, he didn’t want it taken from him, but they seemed pretty insistent on it,” John told him, rubbing his neck where his collar used to be. John would never admit this, especially not to Sherlock, but he kind of missed the weight around his neck. The shock collar was bad, but at least he knew where he stood with his Doms. If he did something bad, he got punished, if he did something good, he got praises.
“That’s how I got away,” Jim said, feeling uncomfortable. “John promised he’d tell Irene if she let me go.”
“Okay,” was all John could say. He knew he had messed up his body with creating so much bliss, but he had to do it. There was no other option. John was just lucky he hadn’t gone into cardiac arrest from a bliss overdose.
With that, John snapped and the next thing he knew, his fist was bleeding again but he couldn’t tell if it was his blood or from the other boy’s nose that he was pounding into. It felt good, like a release valve that was finally opened and he could pour everything out and the only thing that mattered was the pain he felt in his fist and the places he was being kick. The pain in his heart in soul didn’t matter anymore. If John stopped hitting this kid now, the valve would surely shut off and all the water would be stuck inside him again, building up until the pipe itself exploded..
“Well apparently,” John said, already pissed that he was missing one of the most important exams of his life. He had been through a lot of these kinds of things with Mycroft, so honestly, John wasn’t that frightened. If he died, he died and if Sherlock came to save him, they would have mind blowing sex for 24 hours straight.
“F-For me?” Molly asked. She had no idea what she’d done, but whatever it was she would make plans to do it again.
When Sherlock heard a knock at the door, a million scenarios ran through his mind and the majority of them did not end well for the individual on the other side, especially if John decided to be a bad boy. If he did have to take…appropriate action when he opened the door though, perhaps the situation would come as a silver lining and prove to John just how far he would go to protect the boy’s wellbeing.
The older man stilled himself, hit the call button, and pressed his ear to the mobile. A sigh escaped his lips when he heard the sweet unsure voice coming from the other side of the line. “’ello?”
When the torture was over, John grabbed his lunch and headed to one of the tables. Alone. “Hey, look who it is!” A voice came from behind him. “It’s the little homo,” the boy laughed and John could hear at least five other boy’s laughing along. He turned to see two of his team mates and a few of the rugby players he used to hang out with. “Better watch out gents, don’t want to be in the same locker room with this one!” They laughed again, this time, a few others from the surrounding tables joined in the laughter.
“I know you are, Sherlock, I know. I’m so, so sorry I did this to you,” John said, digging his hand into Sherlock’s curls and rubbing his scalp slowly. The older vampire turned to Mycroft as he distracted Sherlock from the human in the room. “I need as many bags of blood as you can get. If we are going to take him out of the city, we’ll need to distract him. Plus, he needs the sustenance now that I’m here and his body can fully process the blood.”
“Check the knife for prints, which belong to the victim’s husband’s mistress. Call me when you have a real case Lestrade, not these ridiculous Cluedo board games. I have more important things to do.” Sherlock added, as he walked out of the building and pulled out his phone.
“I’ll tell you, but I don’t want Jim to have any part of the Resistance. Let him go in front of the IBAD center where Greg Lestrade works, and I’ll tell you what you want to know.”
He paused in the room momentarily, imagining all the things John had done in this room and how now he would be doing them in their bed, with Sherlock. Just the thought of it, made a shiver run up his spine and his cock twitch; it was time to get home to John.
Sherlock looked up from his phone for the first time since John had woken up and Mycroft’s mouth dropped before he immediately closed it again. “You’re welcome,” Greg said, offering another genuine smile before turning and leaving the room.
“John?” Sherlock said, worry in his voice. John fell backwards onto the icy grass, watching the smoke from the house float in front of the clouds. “John, are you okay?”
There was a long moment of silence and John could sense all eyes on him, but that didn’t matter now. His Dom was hurt and John was supposed to help fix it.
The laptop screen showed John getting into the shower, oblivious to the cameras his lover had installed the day before. “Good morning John,” he whispered caressing the small naked body on the screen.
Jim’s words echoed through Sherlock’s brain, words that he knew must be true but he was still unable to accept them. He had to rid himself of this blight, this last coal that kept the tar boiling inside him. If not to save him, then to save John, his beautiful sweet John who would follow him into the dark and back without ever being asked.
Sherlock finally looked up from his table and stood up, fixing John with a serious stare. “I will take off the chains during the day when you bite me. End of discussion.” Sherlock grabbed his table and started to roll it out of the room.
“Oh God,” he squeezed his eyes together as he felt pressure and warmth envelope thousands of his most sensitive nerves. When Sherlock was fully seated, John felt the hollows of his pelvic bone hold and caress the man’s cheeks perfectly. Surprisingly, the tall fully grown man didn’t seem that heavy. “Sherlock,” he sounded breathless, he felt breathless too, as he was held so tightly and securely under someone who loved him.
He quickly threw his head back, avoiding the awkward bulky object and grabbed it in one hand and John’s wrist in the other. “John, you need to calm down,” Sherlock snapped but let the boy’s hand go when it was yanked back. Blue eyes stared up at him even as they became flooded with unshed tears. Anger was expected, obviously a result of being lied to, but there was no anger in those young eyes, only sorrow and betrayal…and fear.
“Of course I was, John. I’ve never been as scared as I was when I saw you lying at the bottom of the stairs. You were unconscious by the time I reached you, so I carried you up here and took care of you. You’re left wrist and right ankle had hairline fractures so I wanted to get them wrapped up as quickly as possible. It should only take a few weeks to heal because I was able to tend to them so quickly.”
Hey everyone, I had a bit of trouble with this chapter, so I'm sorry if it isn't as elaborate as it should be.
John looked at the bite mark as it closed up, his eyes in a daze. “This can’t happen again, Sherlock. I could have-”
John’s face scrunched up as tears started to prick his eyes. It all made since now; why Sherlock was so nice to him, why Mycroft disciplined him, why…why he felt such strong feelings about Sherlock. The past couple of days had not only been a whirlwind, they had also been one giant lie. “What…what now?”
Sherlock held John’s arm, pulling him a tad closer. John let himself be pulled to Sherlock, keeping his blue eyes fixed on those silver ones he used to fear but now loved. There was a hand on the back of his head now instead of his arm, pulling him even closer. John closed his eyes, letting himself relax as warm chapped lips touched his own.
“Not today,” John said, shoving his slicked finger into Sherlock’s tight hole. The man stiffened for a moment, but when John wiggled his finger around, Sherlock let his hands fall to his sides. The man moaned below him and started to hump the bed, giving his aching cock much needed friction. “Like that, do ya?” he smiled and added another slicked up finger.
John watched from inside the store as Mike kicked at the ground while he asked if the girls wanted to have a coffee together. He smiled when they giggled and nodded, then looked back at the wall of shoes, “bloody hell, how am I supposed to choose?” Grabbing a few cleats he liked, three athletic looking shirts, a few neon colored pants, and mesh shorts, John hauled them into the dressing room for some privacy.
“I get it,” John snapped, his eyes filling with tears until the seal broke. Wet streaks spread down his face in jagged lines. He fell to the ground, his knees crunching in the slight frost that covered the grass. “I get it,” he cried, pressing his fingers into his thighs and bowing his head in front of the deceased teenage Sub.
Sighing, John picked up the cup and took a sip, knowing it was a trust game that the Holmes boys were playing. It didn’t make sense that they would drug him now, but one never knew when dealing with lunatics.
In their bed was a completely naked Sherlock, lying on his stomach with his arm stretched out to the side draped over a small pale body that was in a similar position. It was Archie, naked and asleep under Sherlock, who was also asleep in their bed,
“No!” John growled. His entire body started to shiver and he could feel hibernation pulling at him. A vampire’s body needed rest to heal from severe wounds, or else they’re old bodies would soon wither away. “Fuck you,” John’s growling turned into groans as he rolled on to his back.
When the bag was half gone, John pulled it away, much to Sherlock’s dismay. “Give it back!” Sherlock demanded, but knew better than to attack his sire. At that moment, John knew why vampires got stronger with age. If the young ones were as powerful as John, they would be unstoppable in their quest for blood.
“Indeed,” Mycroft agreed quietly, staring at John with icy blue eyes. “John, the doctors said you are ready to be discharged. Here are some clothes I had Devon bring for you as the others were, well, unwearable.”
A few tears escaped John’s eyes and traveled down his cheek, only to pool at his chin. “I don’t understand why I’m even here. What do you people even do?” John asked, actually stamping his foot in anger. The anger and sadness he felt towards himself was now being projected to the nearest target, which was Irene.
John watched as a familiar man and woman walked up behind the reporter. His heart stopped in his chest and his whole body went numb. Any safety that his Doms had provided was just an illusion, and now, with two words, John’s world crumbled. “Mom? Dad?”
“I’m fine Greg, John won’t hurt me,” Sherlock said, winking at John. The vampire had a scowl on his face, but didn’t say anything, only kept his eyes darting from Sherlock to Greg.
“How are you feeling? I sent a nurse to fetch you better blankets. You can have my coat for a bit if you want. Does your head hurt? I told them to give you more morphine, but I’m pretty sure the Doctor lied to me when he said he gave you the proper dosage,” Sherlock said in one breath, then looked at John expecting him to answer every question.
grabbed ahold of a suit jacket cuff. With all his might and what ever will he had left in him, John kicked his legs and tugged on what he hoped was the man who had just saved his life. It could have been an hour or only five seconds until his head broke the surface and cold air filled his lungs.
Sherlock moved his long legs out of the car, standing up, then crouching back down to offer his hand to John. With a hint of stubbornness still left, and his neck aching something horrible, John ignored the hand to step out on his own. The force of his feet hitting the ground even sent shock waves of pain through his sore body.
John’s hand really hurt but, he supposed, that was rather the point of shoving it through the wall. The constant throbbing grounded him, made his senses more acute and his mind more aware of what was going on around him. However, the warm hand at the middle of his back, guiding him downstairs, seemed to test every ounce of will John had not to sigh and go to his knees in submission. It was his nature, he told himself, and those fucking Holmes’ were taking advantage of it just like every other Dom he’d met.
“Oh, I see,” Sherlock said, nodding his head slowly, “Greg told you that?” he asked, already disapproving of what Molly had said. She gave a quick nod in response. “Well let’s make a deduction and see for ourselves then, yes.” Sherlock looked towards John, examining him clinically. “What do you think, Molly? Does John look hurt to you?”
“So what do you need to know?” John asked, setting his tea down and bracing his forearms on his knees.
“Okay, well if you’d like to, just let me know, yeah. You don’t have to hide things from me John, I’ll never be mad at you when you ask for something, understand?” John could only nod his head sheepishly, as Sherlock’s kindness and understanding made him feel even more immature. “Good, now would you like me to show you your present? Well, actually it’s a present for both of us but I think you’ll like it too.”
Suddenly, he started to panic. What if he killed the leader of the League’s brother? That’s when a wonderful, beautiful thought danced into John’s infested mind. He could turn Sherlock into a vampire. Yes, yes, that would be his way out of this.
Greg sat in his car for fifteen minutes debating whether he should go to Baker Street and check on John. The fear in the kids eyes and the trembling in his hand was an obvious sign of terror and, knowing the boy’s history, abuse. He wasn’t working for the yard anymore, Mycroft had seen to that, but he could still see that fourteen year old boy sitting across from him, scared and brainwashed until he thought everything was his fault. “Damn it, Greg,” he cursed himself, slamming his palms against the wheel.
“Get those restraints off him, now!” Irene ordered, throwing a box knife at Daniel, who caught it and began cutting the leather cuffs immediately.
John felt a weight lift off his shoulders when his mother said the same thing happened to her and the fact she ended up marrying the man she couldn't stop thinking about was just icing on the cake. “Oh, don’t worry mum, he’s really smart and helps me with my homework. I think I might even pass math this year.”
At first, John tried to squirm away, but his legs and torso were completely trapped in thick warm vines. To make matters worse, John was half hard and it was not going away. Sherlock’s continuous bliss just felt so amazing and not to mention a there was a hard warm body pressed against him.
“What did they tell you to do? Spy on Mycroft and me? Murder us in our sleep?” The man laughed as he spoke, resulting in a growl from John. He could kill them if he wanted to, hell he could do it while they slept, easily.
“We’re almost there,” Lestrade said, keeping his eyes on John. It was understandable, of course; after all, John had just turned his best friend into a vampire.
The flash only lasted for a moment, but the damage was done. Even though the vampire was back in a dark cabin, the searing pain left him immobilized.
“Stay with me,” Sherlock said, wrapping his arm around John’s tired body. It wasn’t a question, but John’s response almost made him grow hard again.
“Now, now, John,” Sherlock crawled up towards the head of the bed, bracing himself over the boy, making sure to not jostle his injuries. “We wouldn’t want everything to be over to quickly, now would we?”
“No, Sherlock, I really don’t,” Greg said, looking back at John with a sad expression on his face. “I wish you would have never shown me this.”
After a long pause, John turned his head to look at him and Sherlock worried if he exhaled too hard he might break the fragile boy into a million unmarked pieces. “Please…” the teenager sobbed, squeezing his eyes closed, forcing the pooling tears to run down his cheeks. “Please…”
“Come, I’ll walk with you,” she said, placing an arm around his shoulders. John didn’t like the way it felt. It wasn’t Sherlock’s large hand on his nape. It just wasn’t right.
After a moment of making sure both parties were enjoying themselves and John was not being harmed, but rather participating, Mycroft had enough. “William Sherlock Holmes!” The banging stopped and what he saw next would forever hold a place on the mantel piece in Sherlock’s room of his mind palace.
John closed his eyes; the pain like a dagger splitting him open was in the back of his mind, preventing him from concentrating. He thought about the little bump on his neck. How it felt when Sherlock touched him on his nape. How his toes and fingers tingled and his tummy felt warm. And just like that, the horrible pain in his shoulder began to die down to a mere ache.
His sire walked towards him, his hips swaying dramatically to tease Sherlock. “Oh for fuck’s sake!” Greg groaned, walking over to Mycroft to kneel by his side. The human’s didn’t matter anymore though, no, all that mattered was John was coming to take care of him.
Also, this chapter has descriptions of hangings and a crime scene in it, but nothing too gory. Anyways, enough chatting. I hope you enjoy the chapter(:
“That is splendid news, John,” Mycroft clapped his hands once and stood up. “Thank you,” he said in a more serious tone. Both men knew that John had just taken another bullet to save Sherlock. “I’ll send Mr. Lestrade in and then talk to your doctors.”
“Uh-uh, no way am I letting her go. She’s the only thing standing between me and the shot!” John shouted at him. He knew what they did to violent Subs, hell, they did it to any Sub who caused too many problems. They’d stick him in a kennel for a couple of days, and tie him down to some bed, and then inject him with some sort of poison made just for Subs. He knew, oh did he know! And that, friends and neighbors, was why John Watson wasn’t letting go of his hostage.
“Cured me? What in the bloody hell are you talking about, Sherlock?” John asked, his mind slowly catching on to what the other man was saying.
“Then we should get these things off you immediately. I wouldn’t want to keep you waiting, now would I?” Sherlock joked, bringing the scary looking saw down to his arm but John didn’t even close his eyes. Why would he, Sherlock would never hurt him, John had been told this over a hundred times and now believed it with his mind, body, and soul. “Close your eyes John, I don’t want anything to accidentally fly into them,” Sherlock warned him and obediently, the boy closed his eyes, resting his head back on the pillow as the screeching got louder and the pressure on his arm grew stronger.
Slowly, very slowly, Sherlock moved one hand to grip the gun while he left the other as a distraction, stroking the boy’s cheek. “That’s it, it’s okay now,” the man cooed when John let out a choked sob. “Such a brave boy, such a good boy, John. I’m sorry I scared you, love,” Sherlock released the clip and slid both pieces over into the corner of the room. “Let’s get you back on the bed so we can eat these scones, yeah?”
Sherlock’s eyes grew wide and then he smiled even wider than before. “You did it,” he said, sitting up and crossing his arms over his chest.
“Yes your penis is of adequate size and girth, John, please don’t ask to compare measurements,” Sherlock was staring at the ceiling, a small smile on his face. This time, John laughed out loud at the first inaccurate assumption of what he was about to ask. “What, isn’t that what boy’s worry about?” The man asked, confused at the boy’s reaction to what he thought was supposed to be a serious subject.
“Forty. Are you ready?” Sherlock asked, resting a bare hand on John’s bum. It felt strange, to be touched there, but luckily John’s penis hung soft between Sherlock thighs and didn’t decide to say hello to the warm physical contact he was receiving.
In a flash, Sherlock was out the door and hailing a cab to take him to John. He watched the little green dot on his phone constantly, hoping somehow he could channel his energy to John to let him know everything was going to be okay. He had to focus on John, because thoughts of the horrible things he was about to do would consume him if he didn’t.
He pulled up his trousers, leaving the rest of the clothes to try on in the room, and went back into the store to find what Sherlock recommended. Coming upon a row of pants, John walked down the aisle until he found a shorter version of the briefs he wanted, pulling off a red, black, and purple pair, then running back to the changing room. Once there he took off his shirt, trousers, and pants, John shimmied into the purple boxer briefs, posing in the mirror. Just like before, his self-esteem dropped when he saw himself in the mirror and was even worse this time because he didn’t have his shirt on.
“But John, I thought we’ve already established this,” Sherlock said moving behind him and out of John’s line of sight. There was a slight prodding at his arse, until two large hands grabbed each cheek and squeezed greedily. “You’re mine. And I get to play with what’s mine, whenever I want.” With that, Sherlock latched his teeth onto John’s right arse cheek, giving a loud growl as his did so.
John thought he would die from embarrassment alone as he sat half naked on a bathroom floor with his Dom pulling his pants off with a gentleness one would show a child. Sherlock finally worked John’s pants and trousers off, then went to work on his shirt.
John planted a kiss on Sherlock’s head and nuzzled his temple lightly. He tried to fight the sleep, he really did, but with his sire so close, a full belly, and the soft purring noise John was emitting lulled Sherlock into a deep sleep. The pressure from the twine loosened and the next thing Sherlock felt was someone carrying him. By the time his head hit something soft, Sherlock was asleep and completely reliant on his sire and two humans for his protection.
Satisfied with the little bit of privacy, John dropped the towel and threw on the other clothes quickly. “Umm, ‘kay,” his voice sounded small, even for him.
As I said in the last chapter, this is a dark fic that deals with very upsetting issues. If this is triggery for you, then do not continue reading. I appreciate comments that are either positive or have constructive criticism, but there is no need to comment if all you want to say is, "this is horrible, what is wrong with you."
“Not this time, but I can bring them over tomorrow night, if you like,” Greg told him, making his way towards the door.
He couldn’t help himself, “you’re really sexy when you go into your ‘Detective Mode, you know that?” John laughed, trying to bring the mood back up.
“’Cause you’re a Dom…Doms are…are fu’ing arse…holes,” John moaned when one of the amazing hands on his back released a knot of tension under his shoulder blade. For some reason his tongue wasn’t working right but that didn’t matter, no, the only thing that mattered was his Dom was asking questions and John would answer anything to remain suspended in bliss forever.
“That’s okay, John,” he pulled the boy’s chin back to look at him, “I’m glad I get to be the first to show you these things. What did I say about you getting down on yourself, hmmm?” John jolted, his eyes growing wide when Sherlock slapped the hip on his good leg twice, a little rougher to indicate more than playfulness.
“Five years! And if he still wants to be with you, then by all means you two have my blessing to bask in each other’s madness. Until then, you are to stay on my short lead while you either work for the FBI here or hunt down Moriarty’s network of child abductions and slave trade. You will keep a tracker on you at all times, a monthly check in will be required and if you miss any of them or your tracker ‘stops working’ then I will hunt you down and make sure you never see John again, is that understood Sherlock?”
“’night, Jim,” he said, a sleepy smile on his face as his friend lowered his head and left the room. “Hey, Greg,” John whispered just loud enough for the Dom to hear him.
That was a strange answer that made the teenager take pause, but it was as if his mind wasn’t communicating to his body and he had no idea why Sherlock’s last sentence scared him so much. “Okay,” he whispered, keeping his head down and following the man down stairs into the kitchen.
“This is not a conversation to be had while you both are still healing,” Mycroft said, lifting John’s feet off his lap and onto the floor. Sherlock let go of him finally, so John was able to sit up.
“Everything is going to be okay, John, I promise,” he tried to reassure the boy, rubbing slow circles on his back. “Someone is going to take you home,” then, a brilliant idea hit him to boost John’s spirits a bit, but to also give himself more time to act out his plan, “and hey,” he held John back out at arm’s length, “why don’t you have them stop at the store so you can pick up some groceries for the week.” Sherlock smiled but John seemed unconvinced.
John stood up slowly, pulling off a few of the sticky plasters on his chest and ribs. Standing up slowly, he realized the back of his gown was completely open, giving Sherlock ample view of his…well, ample arse. John quickly closed his, jumping and turning the other way to glare at Sherlock, who was watching intently. “Do you mind,” John asked as his face flushed bright red all the way down to his chest.
“I-I don’t know if I can, Mycroft,” Sherlock admitted, already feeling the candles in his mind flickering and dying, wax pooling uselessly on the marble floor.
For how confident John was and how much he despised living for eternity, he sure as hell was not ready to die by a stake in the heart. And this….this HUMAN just tried to kill him and was probably going for Sherlock next!
If you are wondering what the hell is going on with John, here is what I'm thinking. There is a mental illness called Folie a deux, or shared psychotic disorder. It is extremely interesting and if you'd like to learn more about it, this is the link I'm using for my own research. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/293107-overview.
“John!” someone called his name from the front room. Panicked, he ripped the piece of paper into little pieces and ran out into the foyer. He donned an innocent face when he saw the severity in Mycroft’s eyes. “Come here!”
“Well of course it is,” Mycroft chuckled slightly, placing the glass to his lips but more for show than placing that cheap liquor to his tongue, “unless of course, you would like me to stop wiring that money to Leeds because after all…it’s not that important.” Only then did he take a drink, watching the man’s eyes narrow but his shoulders fall. Beating a lesser opponent gave Mycroft no satisfaction,
“Thank you,” Sherlock tipped the man generously because he was a generous man. He grabbed the shoes, mobile, longboard, and note, then hopped out of the car, the smell of salt water filling his nose.
“Lestrade, I need you to come to my place, now,” Sherlock told him, looking at the vial of thick blood and twirling it around in his hand.
This chapter a bit different than the others because Mycroft is not insane or brainwashed, however, he is quite immoral but he knows what he's doing the whole time.
After he had completed the research, Sherlock strode off to clean up his flat, checked to make sure there was still plenty of lube in his bedside table, and actually made his bed, trying to make it look as clean and neat as John’s room had been. When he opened the fridge, a groan came from his throat as he realized he didn’t have any food or beer to feed the teenage boy.
“Did you hear that John,” Sherlock sat down on the bed and began stroking a hand through John’s hair. “One full week we get to be together.” It was so exciting. Sherlock would get to keep his vampire for an entire week, and soon, John would bite him and his last experiment would be complete. He would be the only human to survive and remember being bitten. Oh it was all so perfect, Sherlock could barely control himself.
“Nothing, nothing, just got something in my eye,” John lied. He looked at Sherlock, making sure his pale face was back to normal and his silver eyes still shone brightly.
“Tell him if he won’t help you, you will go to Mycroft,” Sherlock ordered, knowing how much Moriarty hated and feared his brother.
“What are you talking about? It’s not like you’re going driving or walking out in public for the rest of the night.” Sherlock smiled, watching as John listened intently on every word that came out of his mouth. He could tell the boy was thinking about what their lips would be doing later. “Drinking’s not a big deal, John, you and I drinking one is going to have the same effect on both of us, age has nothing to do with it.” When John bowed his head in submission and understanding, the detective knew the potential disaster was diverted and was even rewarded with one of his boy’s nervous rambles.
“I see,” Sherlock said, “well Mycroft will be able to go home in a couple of days, and then we will discuss what will happen with the collar program.”
“Because he is not ready!” Mycroft snapped at him, slamming down his cup. Before Sherlock could respond, his brother stood up, looming over him as he leaned on his umbrella. “You will devour him because he still wants to be devoured, little brother. I will not let you near him until one of you are capable of a true healthy relationship. Obviously, it is not going to be you, it will never be you,” Mycroft shook his head, looking down at the floor. “Five years Sherlock, five years and John will be nineteen years old-“
“Obviously,” Sherlock scoffed, turning to smile at John. Though, it wasn’t a kind smile one offers to a friend, no, this was the look when you buy a new toy at the store. “He’s unaware and/or disbelieving of the outside influences most Subs experience as soon as they present. Thus, creating the perfect specimen to disprove your theories and prove mine.” The two brothers stared at each other for the longest time. So long, in fact, John thought he might be able to slip out of the house before they even realized he was gone. Then, Mycroft turned his gaze from Sherlock to look at John and said something that made the boy tremble with fear.
When that didn’t work, John looked up at Greg, who had a worried look on his face as he comforted both Jim and Mycroft. Swallowing whatever teenage bashfulness he had, John pinched Sherlock’s nose, tilted his head back, and blew fresh air into this mouth. His lips were hot against John’s, stirring something in the boy. “Come on, come on, come on,” John started to whimper. “Please, Sherlock,” he breathed into his lungs again, “please don’t leave me, please.”
A warm feeling blossomed in his belly, hoping it was Sherlock. He pulled out his cell, excited to see ‘Sherlock’ displayed informing him he had a new text.
“NO!” John shouted, quickly sitting up in the bed. His brow was sweaty, his eyes were damp, and his heart felt like it was going to literally beat out of his ribcage.
“Sh-Sherlock,” his whole body shivered from the contact that one piece of skin was receiving. The boy was amazed at how different it felt form when he wanked himself, though he had no idea why it should be any different, but it most definitely was. If he had a choice he would never go back to doing it solo again. When the slippery warm hand stopped, John involuntarily bucked his hips, searching in vain for more friction.
“’Kay,” was all John could get out, pressing his face back into the pillow. Two hands were placed on his lower back right before he felt his muscles go limp with relaxation.
He was confused on why a college student, who was exceptionally handsome, would even want to talk to him, let alone call him beautiful, but also thrilled beyond belief that a college student would want to talk to him and call him beautiful. A small part in the back of his mind told him something was not right about this, but in the end John decided it was just his stupid teenage low self-esteem. Plus, he had seen 20 year olds hang out with 40 year olds before, so why couldn’t someone 14 hand out with a 22 year old. After he spooned the last bite of his meal into his mouth, the boy decided it would be childish to not stay friends with someone as nice as Sherlock just because of his age.
“Because you’re different, John!” Sherlock sat up and slid off the bed, straightening his shirt. “I’ve never seen a vampire let its meal live before and I want to know why and how. I’m going to study you, as I’ve never had a tame vampire to work with,” he said matter-of-factly. He had always wondered about what lay beyond the legends of vampires; what made them hungry for blood, how can they compel minds, why do their victims never scream? There were millions of questions, and John might just be the answer.
With that, John jumped up and limped as fast as he could out of the room and shut the door. He pressed his back against the door, trying to slow his heart down and get rid of the stupid butterflies in his stomach. John rubbed his forehead and limped to the bed, getting under the covers and lying on his side. “What did I just do?” he whispered to himself. How could something feel so right, but feel so wrong at the same time. It was in his bones though, that feeling of home, of this was where he was supposed to be.
“To Mr. Moran of course,” he said. John didn’t stand a chance when the driver turned around and fired one dart into his torso.
“That is a very admirable career, I have no doubt you will succeed in all things you put your mind to, John. You have the heart of a soldier, I can tell, and I’m sure my little brother will be there for you when you need him.” Mycroft’s words shocked the detective. Sherlock had never expected to receive such a blatant blessing from his older brother.
“I know, sweetheart,” Sherlock smiled kindly and helped John lay down. When John was in the prone position, Sherlock took off his own clothes, leaving him in only black pants. Then, he set out to disrobe John even more. The trousers were much easier than the shirt, which Sherlock was forever grateful for, as he didn’t want to cause John any more pain than absolutely necessary. Sherlock hooked his fingers on the waistband of John’s pants and gently tugged them down until they were completely off.
“I am,” Sherlock said, easily pushing John away after pressing the plunger into his arm. The vampire landed with a loud thud as he tried to take the needle out of his bicep.
“Oh God, John!” Sherlock moaned blissfully, forgetting about the pain in his ears for that short moment. John continued kneading the plump flesh in his hands while slowly coaxing the puckered hole open by thrusting in a few times and then licking around the rim over and over again, until Sherlock was panting. “Please,” a wanton whisper came from the head of the bed and John knew this was his chance.
It only took ten minutes after John ran upstairs and Sherlock went out the door to initiate the plan for Moriarty to show up. Sherlock spotted four undercover goons walking around to make sure he didn’t come back and ruin Jim and John’s meeting. However, he was Sherlock bloody Holmes and there was no way in hell a few incompetent lackeys were going to stop him from getting back into the flat.
“You don’t understand. He’s different than the others. John doesn’t kill his prey, he only drinks from them, then buys them a cab ride home.”
“Shift your eyes when I say so,” Sherlock told him, grabbing John’s bottom lid and top, spreading them apart. He switched the torch on and flicked it over John’s blue eye. “Okay, switch.”
“Done? Good,” one doctor said. “Go ahead and hop up on the table, John. Now, do you think you can take care of your own bliss, or would you like some gas to help you out?”
“I love you too,” John whispered over the water noise and he meant it too. His arse hurt yes, he was still pissed and hurt that Sherlock didn’t stop, but other than that he didn’t feel any different and it did feel nice to his over sensitive skin being held. “Ah,” he yelp when Sherlock slowly slid out, giving him a sympathetic smile.
John held out his hand but couldn’t stop the sarcasm from coming back to him. “What, ran out of juice. You know, stamina is half the battle, mate.” The teen tried not to smile at the perfect setup and timing to everything back on track.
He went to the kitchen, double checking that Sherlock was still passed out on the ground, and filled a glass full of sugary orange juice. “Drink,” John told him, shoving the glass into the man’s hands. While the hunter gulped it down, John ran his fingers over the healed wounds on Greg’s neck. Luckily, there was no scaring even though Sherlock went at the man’s neck like a rabid wolf.
“Get off me,” John barked, but his words held little threat. His body was exhausted and his muscles ached, all he wanted to do was be let down. “Let me down.”
John’s celebration was cut short though, when he was presented with a grape in front of his mouth. “Open up,” Mycroft nudged the fruit against the Sub’s lips.
“We’ve strategically placed sleeper bombs around the Holmes Estate. Now that we know there is no other way to bring them down, I’m afraid we are going to have to eliminate Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes.”
“I’m taking a bath. I smell like that putrid hospital,” Sherlock growled and strode into the bedroom, which was connected to a large bathroom.
Nobody noticed or nobody cared as he walked with bloody tar covered hands into 221 Baker Street. As he entered their flat, a shrill scream echoed through his ears attempting to crack the barriers he had to put up when he killed those useless guards. “SHERLOCK!” Sherlock ran up the stairs as fast as he could to see Jim in nothing but a white undershirt and jeans, hovering over John. The boy thrashed and kicked, his eyes bubbling over with tears but his screams were cut off by a slicked hand over his mouth.
“Sherlock, please!” John squeezed his eyes together from the burn in his hole. Two fingers just wasn’t enough, and Sherlock was going way to fast until, finally he was fully seated. John squirmed in his ropes, unable to do anything but hang there and take what Sherlock was giving to him.
“It’s John,” Mycroft said, his tone serious and to the point. “We’ve lost track of him on the CCTV.”
John walked into a white room with a table and two chairs sitting opposite each other, in the center. There was a two way mirror, or at least John assumed it was two way, on one side of the room for the Doms to observe them. Jim was leaning against a back wall, playing with his fingernails. When he looked up to see John, his face lit up like he hadn’t seen the other boy for years.
John laughed, relieved he hadn’t done anything to upset Sherlock, and tried to kick him with his newly freed foot. It didn’t hurt when it made contact with the man’s shoulder but it felt very weak and sore. “Ah ah, none of that,” Sherlock walked over and picked him up. Instead of flinching, John put his good arm out and tried to lift his other to wrap around the man’s neck as he was carried safely to the bathroom. “You are still going to be a little sore and your muscles are going to be weak until we get them back to normal. Don’t worry, I have a few fun ways to move that process right along,” John felt a sharp nip at his ear, causing his cock to automatically stir as if it was conditioned to every touch from Sherlock. “I think we’ll stop the painkillers for now but if you feel strange at all, let me know and I’ll take care of it, yeah?” John nodded against the warm chest as he felt his feet touch down on the tile floor. “Here, hold onto the wall for a second and try to stand while I undress you.”
“No, I don’t care about age, Sherlock. I just…I just don’t like that you lied to me, how-how do I know you’re not lying about everything else?” John hung tight to the man’s hand but lowered his head, his heart about to break if Sherlock didn’t confirm and reciprocate his love.
“This way, John,” Sherlock ignored his brother’s threats and instructions, “on your feet.” John slowly stood up, almost falling backwards when he did, but managed to follow Sherlock down the hall without incident. He didn’t feel the tingling anymore from the security system, which was definitely valuable information to be tucked away in his memory. “Magnussen is an old fashioned Dom, so don’t think for a second he won’t try to drop you while he does his tests,” Sherlock told him before they reached the door to exam room three.
