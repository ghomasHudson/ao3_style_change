Sherlock is sat in his chair texting. John is looking around 221B with trepidation, but the knowledge that once this is all fixed they’ll start something entirely new here.
The partition rolled down revealing Kate, Irene Adler’s mistress, sitting in the driver’s seat. She smiled into the rear view mirror.
At the end of the trail they find themselves in Prague with a gun pointed to John's head and a man demanding Sherlock reveal where Mary was hiding or else he'd pull the trigger. He doesn't believe she's dead and they have unfinished business. Sherlock says he knows nothing, but the man doesn't believe him. The man cocks the gun then Sherlock sees the world stop. He is knocked back and hits his head. Moments later he's come to, but with blood on himself and John.
"I want to do this right, John," Sherlock says. "After years of dancing around this I want to do this right. It's-It's the most important thing I'll ever do."
John seems to take his reticence hard though. His jaw clenches. His hand follows shortly after. He loosens it but repeats the movement.
“No, I couldn’t.” Sherlock has been through torture many times in the past including earlier tonight, but the idea of sleeping in the same bed that John and Mary shared...there are things with which even he cannot contend.
Sherlock wanted to drive back. He didn't want a driver or a police escort. He needed it to be solely him and John until they reached London.  He would again be firmly in charge of their journey. He couldn't save John the torment of today, hell of the past month, but he could drive him safely home.
Just as he stood the message from Irene came through and he needed the distraction. Calculating the risk of re-opening communication versus taking a hit was simple, obvious.  But a visit was never planned.  He hadn’t seen her since she’d sheltered him after the Swiss job.
Sherlock pulled off, and removed his fingers, leaving John feeling strangely empty. Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand he crawled up John’s body, settling between his spread thighs. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled him down, nipping and sucking at his lips, as Sherlock snaked a hand between them to slick up his own cock.
“Good. I expect every year about this time will be amenable? That’s what people do, right? Have anniversaries?”
John leaned up on his elbows to watch the incredible sight laid out before him; Sherlock flat on his stomach, rutting into the sheets as he swallowed around John’s length. At that moment, Sherlock looked up at him, those grey green irises nearly black with desire, hot and hungry on his own. John rubbed his thumb along Sherlock’s jaw. “So good, so beautiful, Christ.”
Sherlock knows John has likely been rushed to the operating theatre. He remembers well enough his experience with a similar wound. Not that he was awake for his ordeal, but he can piece it together from what he had heard from others when he awoke. Operating table, flatlined, asystole.  Internal bleeding, damaged liver. Punctured vena cava. He’s hoping John has fared a bit better, but if he’s honest with himself he isn’t holding out much hope. He can remember the feel of the heartbeat slowing beneath his fingertips not long ago. Please, god, let him live.
As he draws the duvet up around John’s sleeping body, he thinks that perhaps there is a benefit to slowing down. For this beautiful man, Sherlock would calm the energy inside him a bit, allow himself to linger, to wait, to be in the moment. For John Watson, Sherlock would be patient.
No, John thinks. He’s sorry. He’s sorry he ever married Mary bloody Morstan and allowed her to enter into their lives. He’s sorry he couldn’t be what Sherlock needed when he plummeted from the roof at Barts and faked his death for two years. He’s sorry he’s let him down.
Since he was a kid he has loved listening to the patter of raindrops hitting the roof, the sound soothing away the arguments and shouts ever so prevalent in his house. In the army, rainy days were rare in the desert sands, but when they came, they helped chase away the grime and dust and oppressive heat that was an ever present companion.  And even now, rainy days are their own special reward.
John pushed the door open and slowly entered the room, blinking rapidly to get his eyes used to the dim light. Sherlock stayed huddled in the center of his bed, legs drawn up under him, head resting on his knee, warily waiting to see what John wanted.
John turned his head, capturing Sherlock’s mouth in a lingering kiss, a sweet slide of lips that still managed to make his heart beat faster. “You’re welcome, love. Anything you need, anytime. You only have to ask. Got it?”
For a moment, I freeze. Is it too much? We have the private car, but anyone may happen by. What would they see? But as night fully descends outside the moving window, I decide that for this wonderful man, I will take this small risk. Perhaps some day, some time, we can share more with no need to consider privacy. Perhaps someday I can wrap my arms fully around my beloved, hug him to me, stroke his hair while he sleeps, even when we are not alone. But if this is all we can share, here and now, I will take it, and enjoy what I can. For this man. For Sherlock.
John reluctantly pulled away, breathing hard, his forehead resting on Sherlock’s. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he panted.
John sucks in a breath and looks down. He had suspected for a while now that Mary knew how he felt about Sherlock. That he loved him, mourned him, longed to be with him. But she never brought it up, and John, for his part, tried his best to repress all those feelings, push them down somewhere that they could never see the light of day. But Mary. God damn Mary. She knew. And to use it against him, to hurt Sherlock because of him? He’ll never forgive himself.
“I was afraid to. I’d had a bad time with... friends once they found out what I did. In my experience, rugby players don’t like ballet dancers.”
“Couch,” John says in a low growl once Sherlock is bare before him. Sherlock hastens to comply, remembering John’s last text. He kneels on the couch, facing the back, and feels John press up behind him. John trails his tongue across Sherlock’s shoulder blades, pausing to suck a bruise at the nape of his neck, and Sherlock whimpers, his fingers digging into the plush leather. John smirks, “Alright, love?”
“Christ.” Just the thought of that mouth makes his cock twitch. John tries to ignore it, but his traitorous mind helpfully supplies several activities for that mouth, and like that, John knows he has lost the fight. He snakes his hand under the waistband of his pyjamas and wraps his fist around his straining erection.  He gives a couple of firm strokes, running his thumb across the slit and spreading the wetness he finds there to increase the slide. It is not nearly enough, what he wants is to bury himself in warm, lush heat. Wants to grab a hold of silky curls, while that clever tongue is occupied with his pleasure. It’s a hopeless fantasy, John knows. Doesn’t mean he can’t indulge in it.
John laughed as he stepped up closer, placing his hands on those hips that he’d envied blondie touching earlier. “You know the Spice Girls? I would have thought you’d deleted it.”
I don’t regret it. I don’t. I’d give my life a thousand times over if it meant you could live yours. Because of the two of us, it’s always been you. You have made this worthwhile. Made me realize that there is more to life than puzzles and mysteries, murder and death. That there is life and warmth. Smiles and tea. Crap telly and warm jumpers and looks that linger too long. That eyes can shine and people can conduct a light so luminent it rivals the sun. You have made me realize I have a heart, John. And with that, knowledge that a heartbreak, metaphorical as it may be, can still physically ache.
John shifted her hands forward a bit more, her thumbs brushing lightly over Sherlock’s mound and slit, covered still by the silk of the panties. She rested her head on Sherlock’s hip, using just the pads of her fingers to tease around Sherlock’s most sensitive areas, until Sherlock was practically sobbing, begging, squirming with the need for John’s hands on her heated flesh.
Sherlock takes a deep breath before responding. “So he read the drive. He came to you. To what end?”
“Good,” Sherlock replied, running her hands under John’s shirt to help slip it over her head. “I want to conduct an experiment.”
So that explains part of his anger. Mycroft knew of Sherlock’s plans and didn’t divulge them. John must have felt betrayed all over again. Here was Sherlock, off on his own again, and if John was indeed trying to protect him, meeting with Mary would not be the result he would have wanted. No wonder he showed up, and armed. Still, Mycroft knew his conditions, he knew what it meant to keep John away these past few months. And still he let him walk right into that warehouse, right into a standoff with a trained assassin. Sherlock had dressed for the occasion. John hadn’t.
Sherlock threw his head back and sighed. “Husband. Jewels are a ruse. Clever use of the freezer, she was ‘cold as ice’.” He rolled his eyes, flopping on the sofa face down and letting out a long-drawn out moan. “Why are the criminal classes so boring?”
“No touching, Sherlock,” John growls, circling his finger around Sherlock’s entrance, slick with his saliva.
“It’s alright. I shouldn’t have- It’ll be alright, I’ll…” John’s voice trailed off as he walked down the stairs, his tread heavy.
The night is winding down. Most of the guests have already stumbled off somewhere, back home, or, a few, to dark alcoves with some willing partner they’ve pulled for the evening.  Speeches have been given, cake has been cut, and the newlyweds are nestled together at the head table.
John reaches down and entwines his fingers with Sherlock’s and together they work him, the water splashing around them. John thrusts his hips faster, fucking into the tight circle of their fists, his free hand digging into the flesh of Sherlock’s thigh hard enough to leave bruises.
“Dammit Sherlock, where are you?” John swore, going to the window and looking out at Baker Street below.
They’d decided the bath was the best idea after the suspect they were chasing dragged Sherlock into the Thames, that ubiquitous scarf providing the leverage needed to haul him into the river. Of course, this necessitated John jumping in after him, wrestling the suspect into submission and dragging Sherlock out of the water. One soggy handcuffed criminal, a laughing Lestrade and a sodden cab ride later, they made it back to the flat, stripped out of their clothes, and climbed into the bath. A perfunctory wash to get the river smell out of their bodies and Sherlock’s curls, now they are just enjoying the chance to relax together. Truth be told, John is relieved to have Sherlock alive and well, the reassuring feel of his heartbeat a welcome presence against his back. Too close today.
“Fuck, Sherlock, I’m going to - Fuck!” John shouts his warning, shooting his release deep down Sherlock's throat. Sherlock stills his hand on his own cock as he continues to lick at John’s softening erection. He pulls off when he senses John is too sensitive, sitting back on his heels. John sits up and covers his mouth with his own, biting at his lower lip, hands still fisted in Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock changed quickly, steadying himself with the mundane tasks trying to keep his mind off the bitter disappointment at the fact that John was not there to greet him. He tried to shut down the billowing emotions, considering what his next move should be. He didn’t really want to go back to the flat tonight, he wasn’t sure he could face John,  face the fact that John didn’t want him after all. But neither did he want to be amongst others, go to the cast party that was sure to be a raging bore, pretend to be happy when he was really anything but.
“Sherlock,” John leaned up on his elbow to look down at Sherlock, brushing a thumb across one of those ridiculous cheekbones he loved so much. “I’m not going anywhere. I’m here, yeah? If a bullet couldn’t keep me down, a knife certainly isn’t going to,” he chuckled.
Moaning, Sherlock rolled his hips, rubbing their lengths together, and bent his head to suck at John’s neck. John sighed and arched on the bed, his hands clenched in the sheets. The sighs turned to groans as Sherlock kissed down his body, pausing to swirl his tongue around each of his nipples again in turn and kissing around his navel before moving ever lower. At the first touch of exquisite wet heat to his cock, John struggled to keep breathing, fighting the urge to thrust up into Sherlock’s mouth.
“I’m here, John,” Sherlock says, resting his hand on John’s shoulder. His touch is light, almost tentative, and John wants to smile, he’s so glad that Sherlock is ok. But there is a nagging pain starting in his chest. It almost feels like a bee sting, and a cold fire seeping through his veins. John dimly registers that Mary must have shot him. How ironic. She got both of them in the end.
“Yes, and that swagger, love. It drives me crazy.” John pushed up to press kisses to Sherlock’s chin, his jawline, smiling when he felt Sherlock’s breathing increase. He trailed down to Sherlock's ear, sucking the lobe into his mouth, and swirling his tongue around the flesh. Sherlock exhaled a breathy moan, tightening his grip on John’s biceps. “Makes me want to do all sorts of wicked things,” John whispered, nipping lightly.
– The slide of John’s fingers up Sherlock’s torso, lightly skimming first one taut nipple then the other.
When he can think again, he opens his eyes to find John watching him, small smile playing on his lips. Sherlock wants to taste it, so he does exactly that, the kiss languid and less desperate than before. He pulls away and John repositions them, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s middle and lying back against the cushions. Sherlock tucks his head under John’s chin, content for the moment to just soak up his warmth. Neither speak for several minutes, each just enjoying the feel of naked skin and soft brushes of fingertips.
“A damn shame. This,” John pressed a soft kiss to one arse cheek, “Deserves to be worshiped. Adored.”
“Yes,” John moans, so close already. Those hands, and Sherlock’s own orgasm doing their part to push him to the precipice.
Sherlock gives him the look. “John. You have been visited by your dreams tonight, and you are apprehensive about going back to sleep. Additionally, you are concerned because you have to wake up in less than three hours to make it to the surgery. You know you sleep better in someone’s presence. Since Mary is gone and you are not dating, that leaves me. Obviously. Now do get comfortable, John. Or do you prefer to sleep sitting up?” He is going for impervious, but there is a slight wobble in his voice at the end of his speech, like he is expecting John to forcefully kick him out of his room.
Sherlock looked anywhere but at John, which in itself provided the answer. “Perhaps. And really, Amy, John? Why the need to shorten a perfectly good name, she’s Amelia for God’s sake -”
“So beautiful. So responsive, Sherlock. You’re amazing.” John crooned, before dipping her head to trace her tongue in the valley between Sherlock’s pert breasts.
They didn’t come every night. Sometimes John could tell you what brought them on; a knife that cut too close to a sharp cheekbone, a bullet that passed much too close to pale skin or a impromptu river swim in a heavy coat. Those times were the worst, reminding John just how close he had come to losing him for good. But sometimes it was just the fact that he was missing from the bed, leaving a cold spot where John was seeking warmth. Whatever the cause, on the nights they came, he was right back there on the street in front of Barts, watching the blood seep into the pavement. Or in Magnussen's office watching the dark red stain blossom across that pale chest. Or on the plane watching Sherlock attempt to explain why he wasn’t an addict, while John was hoping that his heart wasn’t going to give out at any minute. The scene changes, but the theme is always the same. Sherlock is leaving. Leaving, going someplace John cannot follow. Going up against something John cannot protect him from, and there is nothing he can do to stop it.
“I, uh, heard the star was supposed to get flowers, but I didn’t find that out until it was too late. This was the best I could do on short notice.”
When they first made the arrangements to draw Mary out, in the cell after the Magnussen affair, he’d made Mycroft promise that no matter what, John would be safe. It was the only way Sherlock would agree to the plan. Because the plan was risky. It involved keeping John completely in the dark about Mary’s full past, the data that was on the flash drive. It involved pushing John to forgive her for shooting his best friend. And most painfully, it involved keeping John as far away from himself as possible. The past two months have since been a nightmare of subterfuge and lies, games and distractions. Sherlock has felt adrift without his steady companion, his friend. But the plan required Mary to think John was on her side, fully and completely, and Sherlock couldn’t risk John giving anything away. He planned to tell John as soon as this part was over, and then see if maybe they could move on without the threat of danger hanging over their heads.
But before he could stop himself, much like earlier, part of him just didn't stop himself going forward.
that way. Fuck. He can’t breathe. He can’t bloody breathe. He stumbles back, tries to keep his balance.
Sherlock can very easily see the next moment and the next. How they’ll play out. John will leave and go upstairs to the bedroom. Sherlock will stare at the ceiling all night and wonder what happened. They’ll ignore it in the morning. They’ll ignore it forever. Eventually John will find another Sarah then another Mary. He thinks back to the letter John wrote to him short weeks ago.
"I knew your love story was one of the special ones," she said. "I just didn't know how special my boys were."
Sherlock blinks and blinks as his world realigns yet again. John gives him a gentle poke with his elbow. The one on the arm where their hands are still linked.
Sherlock turns away. John knows he is annoyed that John realized Sherlock is working on the list of top ten unsolved crimes in England. John also knows the act of a desperate man when he sees one.
John has made his case for why he’s not put out. And truth be told Sherlock feels his body will give in to exhaustion at some point. A bed would be nice, and John must know this. Yet he cannot, will not consent to this arrangement. As 221 B will be some time getting back to shape this will be for at least a fortnight.
It’s spacious enough for the both of them. They’ve bunked up together before so it’s nothing new,and part of him appreciates the idea of being able to watch over John.
“Maybe,” John says. “God what it would’ve been to get those two together though. That’d be something to see. Mm.”
Sherlock turns to John then. John is figuring something out. Sherlock narrows his eyes as he tries to figure it out too, but he comes up with nothing. He wants to ask, but he doesn’t. He huffs out a breath.
Sherlock reaches out a hand to John’s arm, moves it slowly down until he reaches John’s hand. He laces their fingers together, mimics John’s earlier motion and pulls John back down. John does goes down, but not easy and simple. Sherlock sees the tension, understands it, understands he has to say something. In this John cannot translate the world to him, Sherlock has to explain himself to John.
John tried to type it all out, to explain exactly what happened.  But he kept starting and stopping and he imagined Sherlock on the other side seeing those dots start and stopped and he hated himself for that so he finally just wrote what he felt.
Sherlock asks a week later and explains he said no because he wanted to ask and the rings he ordered hadn't arrived yet.
And now John is being kissed and being sucked to perfection right now and he is so happy, so in love and it's so perfect. He moans Sherlock's name and asks him for--
“Yeah well you weren’t to know. I only know because she offered me some out of sympathy after you...when you di--were away.”
“It’s ridiculous,” Sherlock says around a giggle and he lifts his drink to his mouth and sips a bit of his drink.
A giggle escapes from John. And he knows this really isn’t a giggle moment and yet he falls into them.
“Sherlock, I--” John stops to clear his throat. "I was dreaming. One moment I was awake in bed and then I dozed off. And somehow it got jumbled up. I-I dreamed that I asked and , well, you said yes and right I’m guessing that didn’t actually happen and then I kinda….Jesus I’m sorry. I didn’t want it to be like this. I’m sorry.”
John reaches into the drawer and takes out the remote, turns on the TV. There’s a few different things he could stop on, but Sherlock doesn’t seem interested in any of them. He sits stiff in his corner away from John. He seems uninterested, bored. His fingers seem to twitch towards his phone sat on the bed between them, but he doesn’t reach for it.
John looks at Sherlock and goes for the kill. “Surely a brilliant man like you can make a phone call to ensure our future cas-“
“Oh, I suppose…” Sherlock blinks and gives him a small smile. “I never thought you’d think of it like that.”
The three dots appeared and then faded away into nothing with no response. So Sherlock was awake, but didn't want to talk or considered it and felt it wasn't worth the effort. So John tried again with no eloquence at all this time considered.
Once his hand slipped in the pocket he couldn’t move. His fingers remained clasped around the phone, unmoving. His eyes focused on Sherlock and he couldn't look away.
Stradivarius for Sherlock. It meant he'd lose his cuddle partner, but he was excited to see the looks on their faces, hear what they'll say.
Once the boy is found Sherlock bids Yuri goodbye and John apologises for all those years in which Sherlock had to see him with someone else.
John appears only startled for half a second before he returns the embrace while holding onto the spatula. Sherlock feels no tension in his hug and it’s entirely different from the last time, though there is still the ever present thought that he is allowing himself this, taking and giving all at the same.
John’s bladder reminds him that needs must be met. He gives a sigh and wriggles his fingers loosening the tenuous grip.  Sherlock, who was quiet, calm a moment ago opens one eye and darts it around landing on John. He doesn’t ask, but John knows.
"A second chance." She smiles then and it seems rather genuine. "Or well twenty second more like it. I want to live in London. I want to do my work and I don't want interference."
John turns over in bed, face towards Sherlock now. Sherlock is still on his back looking up at the ceiling. He could turn to look at John, but he does not trust his face nor his emotions right now. They’re both out of his control.
So one day that Sherlock stopped taking cases, stopped working on random experiments. He met with Stephen Hawking and others of a like mind. Sherlock expanded on their theories until he finally put together a prototype which would either kill him or send him to another world, a world in which he hoped John Watson just might love him back.
Indecipherable words tumble out of John's mouth as he sits straight up in bed. He gasps for air. Breathing as much as his lungs can take. He tries to calm himself by focusing on anything but this feeling.
"Maybe the power of love was the secret key to making it work." John said one day as they all sat down to breakfast.
Sherlock laughs. John smiles bright at the response. He takes another answering drink and lets himself feel it. He relaxes and decides to let it go.  He was supposed to wait until Sherlock had drank more before he even brought this up. After all Sherlock hadn't mentioned it or held himself since this morning. It could be fine.
John nods. He stands and takes Sherlock’s hand. He pushes the coat off Sherlock’s shoulders and ushers him to sit. Sherlock does and John in turn sits atop and straddles him. They kiss for hours on the same cushions where they finally spoke their truth. When they’re finally breathless and smiling, John remembers they must pick up Rosie. He stands and offers his hand. Sherlock takes it and they walk to fetch their daughter from Mouse.
John had never seen Sherlock's eyes look so lost, not since that day on the tarmac. When it seemed they were having their conversation.
"I have a prior commitment." Sherlock responds to his father, then Sherlock turns to look at his mother sharing a look with Mycroft. "What was that?"
“Obviously. As you said. A grenade was set off in our flat and we need to make it more secure.” Sherlock stresses the word “our” and John smiles bright. “I agree. I’ll text Mycroft to speed it up though.”
“Of course not, but she may or may not hold me hostage until the place is done. Don’t worry about me. Just carry on with the cleaning and text me when you’re done.”
He can’t quite think of what to say next and then it comes to him. “And you’re bloody gorgeous.” Sherlock crosses his legs then.
John turns his head toward the windows and takes a guess at the time. It’s possibly nearing seven or a little after. It's not as if he's a lot planned for today, but there is plenty to be done. First of which is he needs a long piss and to drink a very large cup of coffee.
Sherlock's mind was busy cataloging and deleting. He was calling upon established protocols to spare him further frustrations regarding the incident. He was also trying quite hard to not think about what would have happened if he hadn't gotten to John in time.  As they neared John’s home, Sherlock reached out a hand and placed it on his shoulder, adding a brief squeeze.  It would have to serve as voice to what he needed to say.
Then more cases after that. They went in and out of London. They went in and out of the country. John rarely had to use his knowledge and ,in fact, never thought to use it again after they solved the case of the curious mirror.
“So I um,” John started and looked away to the window then back at Sherlock. “I was wondering if you wanted to go out for a bite tonight.”
"Sherlock." John had said and Sherlock looked up at him with pleading eyes, seemingly almost willing John to not move, not talk anymore. And he saw. He saw what John was trying to show him--the look on John's face. Sherlock stood and took two steps towards John and then he was kissing him and kissing him and exclaiming that he would do his best, his very best to show John just how much he loved him.
"It's nothing dear. You just run along to see John. Send him our love."  His mother has a smile on her face and it’s a wondrous change from mere moments ago. His father wears a similar look.
Five years gone and John gets a call from a publisher in New York. They want to turn his blog into a book. He agrees and spends the next few months picking out his and Sherlock's favorite cases. In bed one night he muses to Sherlock about which case to end the book with.
"As you may remember I took myself to the brink of death recently. I know what I can handle. It's just...twinged a bit." Sherlock takes another sip. John does too.
“Nothing,” John says quickly, and tries to focus on his own plate. He takes a bite to divert the attention away. Sherlock mercifully lets it go.
Sherlock leans forward, buries his face in John’s neck, gives a laugh. “I usually am.” He cuddles in closer, seems to take a sniff of John. “I wish I wasn’t.”
But Sherlock doesn't respond. He can still feel Sherlock sucking him. And Sherlock is kissing down his neck, then chest. But they don't speak and he needs them to say something.
“I know,” Sherlock says. “It’s--It’s fine.” At least, Sherlock thinks to himself, he’ll try to make it fine. He thinks what John needs in this moment to make it better for him. He decides to ask, though he doesn’t want to ask, deciding to put John’s needs above his. “Do you-um, often, dream about...Mary?”
Sherlock hears John speaking, but also a buzzing fills his ears, muffles John’s words almost.  Sherlock’s world falls off kilter and realigns and he can’t quite parse John’s words. It doesn’t quite make sense and Sherlock is rather sure he didn’t fall asleep himself, but perhaps he did because what John said doesn’t quite make sense in his reality.
"You should get her home," Sherlock said. He added a tight smile and took a step back. This seemed to say he was putting space between him and John. John wasn't quite sure what he was trying to say with the gesture. But Sherlock was right, Rosie did need to go home.
She and Sherlock’s mother talk at length to Harry and they all agree those boys are really quite dumb and this should have happened years ago.
John’s eyes are fixed, focused though. He can only see the scar on Sherlock’s chest. The memory of what happened then and he can’t help thinking about the scars on Sherlock’s back. The man is wounded through and through and ,God, if John had just been better, somehow he could’ve stopped so much of it.
He gets ready to leave and as he steps across the threshold he takes a deep breath. His phone pings and he immediately pulls it out. One new message from Sherlock.
John laughs and takes Sherlock’s drink out of his hand and finishes off the glass. He looks over at the bottle. It’s not entirely gone, but they’ve made a hell of a dent in it.
John takes Sherlock’s hand and his reaction is immediate. He’s completely and totally lost. The touch of John’s hand, the tight hold. John begins the same calming motion as a few days ago, swiping his thumb back and forth over Sherlock’s hand. But unlike a few days ago this isn’t a tenuous grasp as he’s falling asleep. This time it’s deliberate. Sherlock knows this action has words behind it, but he doesn’t know what they are. Still John is pulling him towards his body and he allows himself down. He edges ever closer to John. John’s eyes close, his breathing steadies. Asleep. Sherlock lets out a breath and watches him. God John.
John swallowed and read the words and blinked the blurriness in his eyes away again...and again. Fuck.
It's a bit slow going at first as John's hand is a bit shaky, but he finally gets it. In doing so he finds his breathing has calmed and the panic attack has past. So he decides to head out of the room and get a glass of water. When he gets down to the kitchen he finds a note from Sherlock with two x's beneath it to let him know it's applicable times two.
John typed it and laughed at himself. He wasn't ever winning any eloquence awards, but it was all he could say because he wanted to be damn sure.
Once the car stops Sherlock estimates they’ve traveled approximately 11 kilometers. He sends this on to Mycroft as well. It’s not that he thinks Irene would harm him, but he can’t help but wonder about the subterfuge, the timing.
Sherlock takes cautious steps around, as if any minute now John might decide Sherlock wasn't allowed to walk where she walked, touch things she had touched.  The cloud of confusion settles over him even more now that he's here. Mary was his friend and John's wife, but there was always a mystery to her actions. The fact that her last one was to save his life after previously almost ending it is something he still cannot understand.
Sherlock eases the door open and takes a step inside. He hears John moving about in the kitchen before he sees him. John has music on which Sherlock doesn’t recognize entirely, but he knows the singer, his voice. Seen him on posters at university and always found his music visceral. Sherlock takes a step inside holding the bottle close and rounds the corner to see John in the kitchen. A spatula in his hand he gives a stir to the fry up of meat and veg.
“I didn’t…well not at first. But well I thought about things…when you know when she shot you. And there was a drive and blackmail. So I sat down and gave it a good think.”
Sherlock’s eyes close and he breathes in this moment. He doesn’t open his eyes, but begins to speak. "I knew a few times. "
. “Um, yeah.. I err.. I suppose we… y-yeah.” Oh god he was a wreck now. His mind was going a mile a minute. Were they going to do it
Mycroft’s voice cut cold as steel. John froze, as did Sherlock. Mrs Hudson puttered on in the kitchen, unperturbed – ever the dissident.
John looked wrecked, he noticed. It tugged at his heartstrings. An unfamiliar feeling when it came to anyone else, but John was, as ever, the ineffable exception. The doctor was rocking his daughter softly, muttering soft words of love and reassurance at her. He looked exhausted, as he often did these days. Clad in pyjama pants and a shirt, hair tousled from what must have been only a short, interrupted nap, Sherlock wanted nothing more than to hold him close and mutter some of those same words to him. He refrained.
fragile. John had walked into his life one day and he’d just been… part of his life ever since. When he Fell – and yes, retroactively, he might’ve handled that differently – he fully expected John to wait for him. To be there to pick up where they left off. He hadn’t anticipated Mary. It felt like he had been replaced, demoted. Unimportant to the only person who really mattered to him. After Mary’s death it had been worse. John had despised him. And Sherlock had truly felt like the man John thought him to be. Unworthy, miserable. It had been hateful, because the one person in the entire world who he needed to tolerate him, couldn't anymore.
So yes, the M4 on an early Saturday morning was a welcome change of pace. Sherlock had insisted on driving the rental car that one of his brother’s cronies had delivered that morning, so John was free to let his mind roam as the gently undulating English landscape whizzed past.
. John turned his head stoically forward. No doubt a similar rosy colour was creeping up his own face.
He looked sideways. He could barely make out the doctor’s features in the darkness of the bedroom, but he thought that might be for the best. Such conversations might be best without the light of day. Any facial clue he would be able to read, he’d burrow deeply into his Mind Palace to examine over and over and over… not good.
“She’s out like a light.” Sherlock reported one night, some time late in March. John was puttering around in the kitchen, cleaning up. He looked over his shoulder and smiled.
. Something had come over him, a boldness and deceitfulness that made him feel ashamed now that he looked back on it.
Mrs Hudson squealed and clapped her hands to her mouth in glee. Neither inhabitant of 221b shared her enthusiasm.
He tore his eyes away, unwilling to look any further. He’d known there wasn’t a chance in the world that John might have romantic feelings for him – never mind that he would act on those feelings. In a strange way, there was a part of him that was relieved. Because if John
“Oh, okay. Be like that.” Then he turned to the therapist. “Should I tell you how he’s always late? Or that he leaves the kitchen cupboards open, even if my daughter can crawl inside, or that he still keeps body parts in the fridge or that he calls me over to do the stupidest things, like hand him his phone, or that there’s usually some chemicals on the kitchen table. Sometimes I come home and he complains that I never listen to him, only to find out he’s been talking to me while I’m away and he doesn’t even notice that I’m not there. Or should I mention that he is a compulsive liar, he’s emotionally unavailable, is incredibly narcissistic, is afraid of commitment and sometimes disappears for days on end. And he faked his death, making me think he died for two years.” John ended, having run out of fingers on which to count his roommate’s many offenses.
“Should we bring up that we have bedroom problems and then proceed to talk about that for a few therapy sessions?” Sherlock mentioned casually. John look at him, horrified. “I didn’t think so. No, I suggest that we stick close to the truth. Anything that bothers you about me. I understand that there’s quite a bit of talking involved, which is not my strong suit. Well, talking is, but not the therapy kind of ‘opening up’. That’s more you.” Sherlock said, releasing the steering wheel and making air quotes with his long fingers.
“Quite simple. My partner, John, has set forth my, frankly, trivial misdoings. I, instead, came here to research if a romantic relationship between John and me has any hope of lasting. I am, as my partner has extensively expounded, a difficult man to live with. I accede that I am not without my faults. John himself is not much better. It has appeared to be quite a struggle to be in a relationship with him, seeing as he is severely repressed and in denial. He will actively inform people that he’s not gay, even though nobody but him really cares or asks him where he sticks his privates. He makes a show of dating, and even marrying, random women in order to make sure he fits into the heteronormative society he perceives – which is obviously nonsense. When his marriage ended – my fault, I’m afraid, I got her killed, honestly didn’t mean to – I figured he’d finally see what was right under his nose. Now John has never been the sharpest knife in the drawer, so instead he hated me and ignored me. I set up a recto-cranial extraction by ways of getting myself nearly overdosed and/or killed and he had to save my life. Not
That night, neither man found much rest. Darkness fell over Baker Street, the windows along it lighting up a merry golden yellow. Still, they didn’t get closer to an answer. On they searched, and theorized, and debated, the neighbours’ windows extinguishing one by one until theirs was the only lamp lit along the ancient street.
. Things put in motion that could not be stopped. A marriage. A child. Even Sherlock’s return couldn’t undo that sequence of events.
“Well, I suppose she could join the Yard. Not when she’s grown up, either. She just needs to learn how to walk properly and she’ll be good to go. Her observation skills already surpass those of Anderson. I’ll give her a month before she surpasses Donovan.”
“Watson agrees with me, don’t you Watson?” He crouched down in front of his chair, where she was sitting on the ground.
With that, Sherlock was in full detective mode. There was precious little to go on; Mycroft had provided them with the details of the victims, cases the three agents had worked on and the work of the three civilian victims.
“I can take her.” He held out his hands and John obliged, handing over the little girl to him. Sherlock
Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who's left comments and kudos. You have no idea how much it means to me. Writing is hard, especially in these mind-numbing times. Please forgive any spelling mistakes. This has not been beta'ed or Brit-picked.
“She could do a lot worse than end up like you. Means there’s hope for the consulting detectives in the world.”
“Here we go.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and leaned back to study the ceiling in quite a convincing act. John pretended to be riled up by that.
“Fine. Then I’ll dry off.” His roommate replied as he swooped down and searched the lower cupboards for a towel.
to be something in the Geneva Convention about torture of this level. Not that his big brother would be overly intimidated by silly restrictions like international legal frameworks regarding war. To a man like Mycroft Holmes, the law was about as useful as the Sunday newspaper. Sometimes handy, to swat a fly here, or stoke a fire there, but on the whole disregarded after a glance. Irrelevant. Obsolete.
“Certainly.” But the grin he shot John undercut any mean intentions his words might’ve had. “Tell me then, as you are, between the two of us, the most experienced in courtship and subsequent co-dependent attachment. What would a relationship between us entail?”
John waved his concerns away, then stood up to clear off breakfast. He ran the sink, filling it with last night’s dinner dishes that still littered the kitchen.
want him… Sherlock could never be what John deserved. He could never live up to those kinds of expectations. He’d fuck up everything spectacularly and lose John forever. But there was another part, a much bigger part, that wanted John. That wanted to kiss him and wake up next to him and other things that his inexperience couldn’t even dream up yet. Maybe they could -
He was quite pleased with that recap. Of course, he’d complained about Sherlock often enough in his own therapy sessions, but it was rather fulfilling to spit it all out
He liked London at this time of night. It was quiet in the backstreets near Holborn, his the only footsteps echoing faintly between the age old buildings. If he turned right on the next street, he’d find Edgar, of his homeless network, but he wasn’t in the mood for a chat. He needed to think.
The low evening sun illuminated the fond gleam in the tall man’s eyes. It did not escape John’s notice.
“It’s fine.” Sherlock said, a bit too fast for John’s comfort. He didn’t fail to notice the detective looked a shade paler than normal, and the area under his eyes a tad darker.
“Quite. Same as her father. If she’s a bother, just put on crap telly and she’ll zonk out on the sofa.” Sherlock shot back blithely. He grinned at John, who just rolled his eyes.
Sherlock paused, then looked him up and down critically. “Perhaps you would benefit from some sleep. Rosie has kept you up four nights in a row now. I prefer my blogger well-rested.” He buttoned up his coat before sending him a small smile.
“Hmm. Skipped that part. Boring.” He brushed past the nanny with a vapid grunt of hello (honestly, a big improvement. In the past he would've ignored her) and sauntered over to Rosie.
, he admonished himself). Some nights, when John was exhausted after a long day at work and then cooking for everyone, Sherlock took it upon himself to gently wipe down Rosie’s food-stained fingers and face and take her up to bed. He never read to her (
“Come on then, don’t make me wait for you.” He said primly. John snorted with laughter and shook his head as he plunged a cup into the water.
“The Crai Retreat of Healing.” Sherlock was tapping on his phone, looking down at the screen as if it had personally offended him. “A place to reconnect with your soulmate, rebuild trust and intimacy and strengthen your relationship. Guided by our professional psychologists you will participate in therapy sess-
Mrs Hudson permitted herself entrance to the flat, trailed by stiff-looking Mycroft Holmes. Sherlock all but hissed and flung himself away from the kitchen counter, stalking to the sofa.
The detective kept rocking her gently and indeed, after a few minutes, her cries turned into sorrowful hiccoughs and before long, she started rubbing her eyes.
It wasn’t that he hadn’t loved Mary. She’d been good to him – on balance, at least. She’d loved him. She’d given him a daughter. She’d been a beacon of light when he was suffering, a lifeline after Sherlock Fell. Yes, that deserved a capital F. The event that had caused
His friend didn’t meet his eye, just withdrew a kitchen towel with a flourish and grabbed the plate John had just washed.
An upturned corner of the mouth and a little amused exhalation through the nose was the only response. John braced himself, then pushed onto a topic they desperately needed to discuss next.
He pretended not to hear the muffled snicker behind him when he bumped into the door jamb on his way out.
Mycroft settled himself into John’s chair, resting his ever-present umbrella against the side. “Both of you, in fact. Together, you possess a unique skill set that will be vital in the investigative process.”
John had loved her, in a way. But not really. Not fully. When Sherlock was gone, yes, she was his light in the darkness. But Sherlock was the entire fucking sun. The sun that would sustain life, bring a raucous joy and breathless exhilaration that made you thank God on your knees that you were put on this Earth. The sun that would burn out your retinas and blister your skin. And always at a distance too far to be reached.
“Oh.” Sherlock’s face fell. “Right. Rosie. I wasn’t thinking. Well, not of her, per se. I’m always thinking.”
“Right.” His stomach sank to his shoes. Of course. Of course he wanted that. It was only a matter of time before John moved on. Found another woman with hips and breasts and bright laughter and easy companionship and all the things John liked and Sherlock lacked. And if that made John happy, then Sherlock wanted that for him too… but
God, he’d kill for a cigarette. But he wouldn’t. John disliked it when he smoked. Normally, another person’s opinion would result in exactly zero consequences on his part, but when it came to John… John was different. John was the ineffable exception to the rule.
And Sherlock, apparently satisfied with the session’s result, stood up to get himself a cup of tea. John let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and deflated into his chair. He tried, to meet his friend’s eyes, but he was definitely avoiding his gaze. Closest to the truth, Sherlock had said... was there truth in those pivotal words?
John groaned, putting his face in his hands. How. How had his life gone so wrong? How had he, captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, army doctor, turned out to be such a mess? Whatever he did, he got dragged into the most dangerous, ridiculous and heart-breaking situations. His life practically couldn’t run smoothly for more than a few months. Addicted to trouble, his wife had called it. Was he really such a masochist? Sure, he loved the thrill of hunting down a criminal and he certainly didn’t mind the odd cut or bruise… but hadn’t life gotten excessively painful for him? He’d already mourned Sherlock’s death once – and the idiot didn’t seem averse to going down again – followed by the loss of his wife.
Having retired to his bedroom after a long day cleaning, John sat on his bed, back to the headboard, and took a deep breath. Dust particles floated on the sunbeam that shone softly through his window. The room hadn’t changed a bit – mostly because it hadn’t been damaged in the explosion. Plus, it hadn’t been let out since he left Baker Street the night after Sherlock died… well, fake-died of course. Now here he was, back in the same bedroom after four years. Sitting here, he could almost imagine the previous four years had never happened. Like his life hadn’t been ripped apart, sewn together and ripped apart again. He could almost believe it, looking at that dusty sunbeam that signalled the end of dusk.
“Oh, and John was wrong about one thing.” Sherlock continued airily. “I’m not a compulsive liar. It’s completely voluntary.”
The detective paused, wringing the scarf in his hands ever so slightly. John didn’t miss the movement – and it only added to his disquiet. His friend was nervous, and that wasn’t a normal occurrence. Not only were they thrown an unusually hard case, the prospect of pretending to be a couple seemed to put the taller man off completely. That chilled John to the bone. Because once they started pretending… well, John wouldn’t be pretending and the detective was one of the best in the world for a reason. If the prospect of just pretending sickened Sherlock so much, what would he do when he found out John’s act wouldn’t be an act?
Yes, she turned out to be an assassin like in their world. Yes, she shot Sherlock. But where as in John's world he came to his senses one cold winter day, that John went back to Mary and stayed with her through every betrayal and lie. And he had no plans to ever leave Mary.
“You’d think that,” John says. “And yet.” John waves his hand to the cards and to Sherlock who is staring at the hand before him with a confused look.
Sherlock is between his legs and John's thrusts have fallen into a steady rhythm of up and down. A blissful humming is in his head and he realizes it's because he is humming. A song. He doesn't know the name of the time but he knows Sherlock has played it for him. It was one of the rare days where they hadn't fought over the violin and he was able to curl up with one Sherlock while the other played. The absolute best of both worlds.
John says, “Ahh.” Then turns silent. A few moments later Sherlock notices his breath has evened out. He doesn’t move at all.  Asleep. Sherlock watches him sleep for a few moments before he allows himself this indulgence. He reaches out his hand to take John's pulse. Fingers sliding to John's wrist.  But John’s hand moves instead to intertwine their fingers. He tightens his hand around Sherlock’s, swipes the pad of his thumb over Sherlock's hand--once, twice, then doesn’t stir beyond that. Sherlock lets out a breath. He feels himself hope for just a moment and falls asleep.
“Ya know um, Mary always wanted a sister.” John says this casually. Sherlock doesn’t hear pain in his voice like before when John spoke her name.
Sherlock was where? Wasn't he just there? John didn't know. There was a fog. It was cold. John was walking in Regents yet again. He walked past the same two ducks at least four times. The sky changed from blue to a dark purple and then somehow orange mixed with bright red.
Sherlock: So much that I got dressed to take a cab over to see you then realised that might be known as coming on a bit strong.
Sherlock pulled his fingers out and leant back to slick up his own length, before crawling up John’s body and settling between his thighs. John threaded his fingers in his mop of curls and pulled him down for a kiss as Sherlock began to sink in.
was his last conscious thought before falling into his first deep and restful night of sleep in months, the soft sounds of the violin soothing his dreams.
God I miss you. I ache for you. I still can hear you, smell you, see you here. It was you, always you. But I was too much of a fucking idiot to tell you. And now you’re gone forever.  And it’s time. It’s time to tell you.
Sherlock chuckles at that, a deep rolling sound that vibrates through him, mixing with John’s breathier giggle. Sherlock reaches down and pulls John up, claiming his mouth again, the giggles dying out to the sound of shared moans and gasps, as John presses his body on top of Sherlock’s on the bed. Sherlock lets out a low growl when he feels John’s cock heavy against his own. And hard. Impressive, that.
The door opens, jarring him from his thoughts. John pops his head up, hoping to catch sight of inky curls and a flipped collar, but instead it’s a white coat and a kind smile.
Sherlock pulls off, and picks up John’s hand, placing it back on his head, “I don’t mind, John, you can pull it, I want you to.” He sinks back down onto John’s length, pressing his tongue into the frenulum and wrapping his hand around the base.
Sherlock’s hands are moving on John’s back, pulling at his shirt until he can untuck it enough to get his hands underneath. The feel of Sherlock’s fingertips on his heated skin makes John shiver. He presses another hard kiss to Sherlock’s mouth before sitting back on his heels and removing his shirt.
He could feel Sherlock’s grin like an imprint on his skin as he made his way across his chest, devoting attention to the other nipple. Sherlock bit lightly, and John couldn’t contain the noise he made, or stop his hips from rocking up, seeking friction for his aching cock. It was ridiculous how little Sherlock had to touch him to make him insane with desire.
That flash drive. The one she told him not to read. The one he told Sherlock he threw in the fire at the Holmes’ at Christmas. The one the contents of which Sherlock is convinced he knows nothing. But oh, he does. He wishes he didn’t. Had just taken Sherlock at his word and trusted him, but he had to know. So he’d made a copy and sat on it. It felt like a lead weight in his pocket until, one week after the tarmac, he poured himself some liquid courage and read it. It had made his skin crawl. He already knew he could never forgive her for shooting Sherlock, but after what he saw, he could barely contain his disgust. Mary, the safe choice. How wrong he’d been.
Three minutes. Instead of counting up, I am now counting down. Counting down until I can be in your presence again, hear your voice. Make you laugh again. Your laugh, John, it’s intoxicating. It’s why I made the joke earlier. Leave ‘em laughing. I wanted to hear it again, one of the very last things that would ring in my head throughout the cold nights to come. When you laugh, my blood sings. Warmth booms in my chest and spreads throughout my body until I can feel it in every cell. It is one of the things I love about you, you have shown me true joy.
Sherlock has to lean forward to hear, his ear nearly pressed to John’s lips. “Scarf,” John repeats. Sherlock whips off his scarf, and presses firmly on the wound. Sherlock shifts and gently cradles John’s head in his lap.
“It’s exactly the same!” Mary yells, taking a step forward, “You killed people under orders, and so did I.”
Mycroft looks away and down, not meeting Sherlock’s eyes, “I never thought- I didn’t think she’d actually hurt him.”
“God Sherlock, I’m yours,” John breathed, brushing their lips together again in a kiss that quickly turned desperate.
Sherlock’s voice is wrecked. There is a depth of emotion swimming in those pale eyes, clouded with unshed tears. John wants to stroke that face, caress those sharp cheekbones he’s always dreamed of touching. He wants to smooth away the tears that are threatening to fall. John is amazed by Sherlock’s feelings. He never could have dreamed he meant this much to him. It was almost worth being shot to see this, John thinks. John is grateful he was able to protect him. It was his turn.
The minutes tick by and he knows this should be especially boring, tedious even and yet he can't quite find it as such. He allows his eyes to close and enjoys this for what it is. Maybe this is all they're meant to be to each other, but it's more than he ever expected and this is good.
Sherlock hadn’t made it far down John's driveway before a black sedan pulled next to the kerb. He rolled his eyes, opened the door,  and slid onto the empty backseat. Sitting down with a thump he let out a sigh which he was sure would be ignored. It was.
As they fall asleep John tells him about the one time things came close to happening with James Sholto and with a few others, but Sherlock is the first man he's been in love with entirely.
Sherlock typed out a quick message to Mycroft then cocked his head and looked toward the hidden driver.
"Will you join us for dinner, Sherlock?" Sherlock's father asks, but he knows his mother is the true prompter.
Still he wants though he knows it's not okay. John is still dealing with the loss of his wife and also John has often pointed out he's not...that many times before. Still Sherlock remembers a conversation long ago in an abandoned building when the woman said they were a couple and John's response was one of...acceptance? Resignation? Frustration? Truth be told he imagines anyone who could care for him in any fashion must feel all of those and more on most days.
“She’s here in London.” Sherlock doesn’t meet his eyes, and John hates him for it. “She wants my help on a case. She…told me things. I’m not sure if I should tell you about….”
Sherlock said nothing, didn’t open his eyes. He swiped a few motions on the phone. John heard Lestrade’s outgoing voicemail message then Sherlock spoke.
Sherlock is soft, blinking his eyes open at John. God, John thinks, he could’ve lost him again. He really could have. Jesus. He wants to hug him but given how they’re currently maneuvered it would be more awkward than anything so John instead scrambles out of the bed, not paying attention to how careful he is. As he moves he accidentally brushes his leg against Sherlock’s quite hard…
Sherlock looked up and seemed lost in thought for a moment, then he found the information, the date, John and Mary's no longer anniversary.
John pulls back then, looks at him. There is a haze of drink and lust over him but he wants to make sure Sherlock is here with him.
John shakes his head, he takes Sherlock's hand in his and waits for him to look at him. “Sherlock, no. We don't know who it was, but if it was her it doesn't matter. You may have not noticed, but I am desperately in love with you. I have been for some time now. I married you. I want to be with you until the day I die. Okay?”
In the end they track down a lead to a woman who is not Mary, but rather Janine. John swears to not tell Harry as long as Janine promises this is her last job.
“Yes, I’m sorry. It’s just --it wasn’t a few weeks ago a grenade was set off in our flat and I just need to try to get something in place first. Mycroft and me are working on security layouts and once we’re done we-”
Sherlock removes his hand slowly then before John can speak he replaces it with his lips. John kisses him back with a fervor and passion he’s sure he’s never felt before. They kiss and kiss. John’s hands in Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock’s hands in John’s. John breathes fast and hard as Sherlock moves from kissing his lips to sucking on his neck. In succession Sherlock starts grinding down on John’s crotch and moaning in his ear. John doesn’t hold back and thrusts up into every bit of perfect friction.
John was still just a bit more broken that he'd have liked to admit.  Greg had done him the pleasure of stopping by and dropping off the birthday DVD of Sherlock and he couldn’t stop himself from watching. Try as he might.  By the end of it playing he was a bit of a mess. Just kind of wishing things were different somehow.
His mouth opens to reply, but he closes it. He feels laid bare in front of her and he just wants to go. To feel his regret in solace then decidedly ignore it. His face hardens.
“Hmm?” John answers but he doesn’t have the strength to even open his eyes.  His relaxes back to almost sleep. Sherlock says nothing else.
As John descends the stairs his gait is slow, changed. Somehow there is stress in him that wasn’t there before. Sherlock doesn’t turn towards him. The lights flicker off all around and John walks to him.
John laughs and starts to clean. Sherlock does help though then leaves much later than planned. Each moment he’s away with Eurus John worries, but Sherlock texts him before and after up until the moment he is back at John’s place and they discuss how much John got done without Sherlock and the progress Sherlock has made not only with Eurus, but with finding the Borgia pearl.
“And you've never lied to me about being injured before have you?” It comes out more biting than he plans. Memories of the first night Sherlock came back running through John’s head. He was only hours back Sherlock had later told him. So he must’ve been hurt that night. The wounds were still fresh and he hadn't said a thing. John had attacked him three times. Unable to let go of his anger, hurt, and shame for not being smart enough to figure it all out earlier. “Sorry.” John takes a step back.
John finishes relieving himself then he looks in the mirror as he washes his hands.  His jaw is clenched and his eyes are furious. He shakes his head. He’s no right. If she makes Sherlock happy...well the man has obviously been through enough in his life, he deserves it. John will try to encourage him even more. Maybe he can find her number and send her his...best wishes? Or maybe send a message to him and her and wait for them to show up and ...do whatever the hell it is they did before.  He decidedly tries to stop thinking about it. He brushes, washes, and gives a glance back up again at his reflection. Jaw still clenched, eyes still frustrated. He shakes his head. He doesn’t have to figure it all out now. There’s other things to do than think about Sherlock’s sex life. And what does that mean about….Jesus he can’t do this now.  A knock at the door startles him just a bit and he takes a step back.
He knows John doesn’t need to hear what he could offer by way of apology. John, by his own words, no longer blames Sherlock for what happened with Mary. But Sherlock knows if he’d only, if he’d only.
“I know,” Sherlock says. His face is blank. John sees no change in his face, no blush, no secret smile. He worries perhaps it won’t work. He worries perhaps it never did work. Still he tries.
Everything with Eurus is settled, but he can't help but think there's something else coming from Moriarty. A fail safe in case Eurus didn't fulfill their agreement. This is a worry. Of course this doesn't even begin to speak of the ache he feels right now. It's a mixed bag of good and bad really, this set up.
Right on cue a soft snore escapes from Sherlock. John smiles at him. Sherlock Holmes asleep is something quite special, quite human. Even if Sherlock sometimes isn’t.
They sit across from each other and share the meal, deciding to save the bottle for an after dinner drink. Unlike their old days they don't have Mrs. Hudson’s cakes for after. A fact Sherlock states with a slight pout.  Also in contrast to their past, Sherlock actually eats his meal. John smiles at nearly every rise of Sherlock's fork. It’s still such a rare sight, and one John hasn’t seen for some time. Not like this.
John laughs and kisses him. He uses every tool in his arsenal to make Sherlock feel pleasure and Sherlock somehow finds new spots on John’s body which make him feel like he’s never truly understood what an orgasm was before now. They fall asleep that night and many nights after in their home.
“John.” Sherlock says his name louder. His voice is strained with distress. John’s hand, which was caressing Sherlock’s backside rather expertly stills. John himself stills. Still he says nothing.  Sherlock is trying to figure out if John wants the dignity of pretending this didn’t happen or if he should try his level best to make a joke to ease the tension. But all he can say is his name.
Absentmindedly John reaches over to pick it up and clicks the cap back on. He gets out of bed and starts to pick up. He tosses the three sets of pants into the small hamper in the corner. He picks up the wet towels and adds them on top. He then decides to arrange the bed so that the sheets which had slid off are actually on the bed properly.
He walks downstairs with shirt in hand and stops by the bathroom first, has a piss, washes his hands, brushes his teeth. He’s in the middle of applying just a touch of aftershave when he realises what he’s doing. This was his routine when he thought he might…share his bed, if you will. He stops himself and looks in the mirror. Jesus it’s not like that. He means. The thing is…he’s not. Well he obviously is sometimes. But it’s not been that way with Sherlock, no matter what anyone, including Mary suggested as early as their third date.
John turns his head to the small table next to their bed. A bottle of nearly used lube is tipped over and a small pool has collected on the top. Spilling out and reaching past the small lamp to drip on the floor.
Then he washed his face, ran a hand across his face to find a barely there five o'clock shadow. He was considering a late night shave when his phone lit up with a reminder to put the bin out for tomorrow's pick up. He sighed and got on with it. Putting on his heavy dressing gown and slippers then went to complete the task. As he did so he tried to imagine what Sherlock was going to say.
His mother and Mycroft continue having a silent conversation to which Sherlock has not been invited and one he cannot read.  But as he leaves he does notice Mycroft working hard to suppress a roll of his eyes and his mother’s raise of a single eyebrow. His father simply smiles wide and large.
“Ahh,” John smiles. Sherlock notices it out the corner of his eyes. He likes Sherlock’s parents. Sherlock never knew exactly why, but he enjoys the fact regardless. John removes his hand then. The warmth is immediately missed, but Sherlock tries not to focus on it. John turns to look at the ceiling along with Sherlock. “Jesus. They didn’t know.” He sighs.
John sees this for the clever ruse that it is and he knows Sherlock just wants to hear John tell him he loved him from the start.
Sherlock opens the door and steps out the car. He looks at the house before him and the many like it on either side.  He finds them all the same, right down to the smallest detail. No one would ever think Irene Adler, former royal mistress and dominatrix to the powerful, could ever be found here on this dreary street full of carbon copies of tedium. And he supposes that's the point.
Mary and he’d made a date for that night. The pivotal third with the guise of just hanging out to ‘watch movies’ when all he’d really planned was a forgotten set of dvds, a bottle of wine, and hopefully a few well used bodies and hours. But she rang the doorbell and when he answered it was obvious he wasn’t okay.
It's a bit awkward once they're sat on the bed. John isn't sure what to say so he turns towards the window then back to Sherlock.
John: And it's a bit ...I dunno. It's a bit like us isn't it? No real conversation, just going forward.
Sherlock stands at that, walks in front of John, looks down at him. The schooled face switching between nervousness and practiced uncaring.
As Sherlock asks Molly and Mrs. H for more information he begins walking around and listening. He sets John’s phone on the counter and steeples his hands, paces. John continues with the dishes, soaping them up and enjoying this, just this.
Sherlock doesn’t know this to be a fact, but it seems likely. How they failed to mention her is not as odd as one would think. After he and John spoke about Mary the once he’s not brought her up since. John also does not mention his sister or other family either. A painful loss sometimes can be easier withstood with silence.
John reaches out a hand and lays it on his shoulder and squeezes, mimicking the motion Sherlock made earlier.  But Sherlock isn’t stoic like John. He wants the reassuring touch. Sherlock reaches his hand to cover John’s. He takes a breath and waits. John doesn’t move or flinch back. Sherlock feels his heart break and rebuild. He can't ever lose the man next to him. He needs him more than he needs the next good case, or the feel of the drug coursing through his vein. Sherlock vows to always, always put John and Rosie first. He won't lose them. He can't.
The splashes of color, expensive pieces are sparse but each makes a statement. Those who dwell here take style very seriously.
But it's bright. That's good isn't it? Exhaustion and worry is heavy on his shoulders. He is so tired but no, no, No! He can't get any sleep as long as Sherlock is standing with a gun in his face. Sherlock smiles and then it's fine. It's all fine.
“No,” John turns back to look at Sherlock. “I don’t think we do.” John sighs. “What else did you do today?” John bites down on his tongue and doesn’t add ‘who else?’
Sherlock huffs out a breath in annoyance. “I’m not calling him,” he says. John is well aware of Sherlock’s habits. Making a declaration is Sherlock’s version of digging in, becoming unmovable. John reaches over and takes a last drink, he looks over at Sherlock and decides it’s for his own good really.
A small smile creases John's lips and he's okay it seems.  The dream must change because he breathes steady and his lips part. Sherlock doesn't let himself think about these things often. He doesn't dwell or indulge. He doesn't fantasize or imagine. Not often. But right now he wonders about the possibility of being allowed to feel as he does.
Sherlock looked up and deduced that John wanted to move back in. He said John's room was ready for for him. He was right that John wanted to move back in, but he had missed that John had no plans to move into that room.
Earlier when Sherlock had come in he looked so...John can’t describe it. He looked like he’d come back from war. John had seen that look before but never in Sherlock, or maybe...maybe he just never let himself see that look on Sherlock’s face. The man who wasn’t a hero or indestructible, who was human, who was his friend, who was….the person in his life who was willing to go to hell for John Watson. Even if it's with the smallest hope that John would be there to help find a way back. God Sherlock.
It wasn't until Rosie stirred just a bit that John knew he had to pull back. And he did. Sherlock did as well, but still looking intently at John, waiting.
“No. Stop. There’s nothing to be sorry about. Look I don’t think it’s an accident she wound up here, but everything else after...I think it was real for her. At least—” John sighs. “I hope it was. I mean. I think. There was the passports, but also she seemed to really want...And I think she did. I don't know. I’m a bit drunk and she wasn’t quite simple was she?”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says, placing a hand on John’s shoulder. Trying to look in John’s eyes, but John closes his and looks away. His grip falls from Sherlock and he  lays on his back, looks up at the ceiling.
“Ahh,” Sherlock says and stretches a bit. He closes the one eye then snuggles closer to the pillow. A second later it seems he’s all but asleep.
"Know what I liked?" He tries to joke. He fails as she decides to drop all facade. Her head tilts to the side. Her face does a thing. She is the most human he's ever seen her.
“God why can’t you get this game?” John laughs and giggles and laughs some more. Sherlock is staring down at the cards with the most amazing look of confusion and John loves it.
There is only the light from the outside hitting Sherlock’s cheekbones and angles and John just fuckin wants, can't stop himself. He moves a little closer towards Sherlock who is staring,nearly unblinking at him. Fuck. This isn’t the fuckin right time and yet he can’t stop himself. He clears his throat.
Sherlock’s eyes were closed, his breathing steady. It was nearly the only sound John could hear. It was only slightly matched by the sound of his heartbeat pounding in his ears.
"Right," John gave a tight nod and with a quick look around, as he would often do to make sure she had everything she needed. He gave a quick smile himself then looked at Sherlock once and walked through the already open door. He took each step down slowly, but it was only once he was on the last step did he hear the door eased closed and he turned around to look back.
“I’ll teach you in the morning. Promise.” John reaches out a hand to take Sherlock’s card and starts gathering up the others. “We should drink some water before bed. Mind getting us some and I’ll fix up the covers a bit?”
“For the last time I’m not…” Sherlock stops himself. Perhaps revealing this isn’t the best time. He changes his statement to “interested in a….” He doesn’t want to say romantic entanglements because that really isn’t true and repeating the lie will make it seem even more so. “Girlfriend.”
And when Mary turned out to not be who John thought he was they also worked together on that until Mary was safe. Her and the child which wasn’t John’s.
He says nothing. His mother reaches out a hand and ruffles his hair. He looks away, but smiles. He turns back and looks at his mother, his father and reaffirms.
Right now he hasn't opened his eyes to see their faces. Not since they both began their exploration of his cock and mouth respectively. He also hasn't heard their voice in hours, days? God he just needs to hear them and see them both. So he tries to open his eyes, but he can't quite find the strength. He can't, he can't. He needs them there. He needs this to be real. He mumbles and when it seems he isn't understood he mumbles again.
“Lestrade, I apologise for my behaviour. As you know I am not an easy man to work with and I appreciate your understanding. In the future I will endeavor to…try.” He then ended the call and placed the phone back in his pocket.
"Let?" Sherlock says though there's a warmth in his voice. It seeps through though he's trying hard to be perturbed at the implication.
Molly looks astonished, appears stunned for a moment before she blinks, nods, then speaks. "Good. That’s good. Okay. Right. Night John.  Sherlock, we're on the case."
Luckily Mouse does not require him for any tedious deeds and lets him go quickly with for a bottle of 1983 Ballblair single malt scotch.  His driver doesn’t say anything and somehow doesn’t need direction as he takes him directly to John’s home.
But at home it was simple. John was in a relationship with Sherlock and Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson could never tell them apart and she laughed when they tried to spin her the twin story. So they told her the truth and she burst into tears and hugged them all.
John waits until everyone is busy giving best wishes to the bride and congratulating the groom to pull Sherlock to the side and tell him how incredibly sexy he looks in that suit and how he wants to do things to Sherlock while wearing it.
John can't help but smile at the message. It's not something Sherlock normally does which just shows they're both affected. John stuck to the status quo and Sherlock, always surprising, did not.
John decided to brush his teeth to try to distract himself. Of course he took his phone with him, balancing it near the toothpaste waiting for it to light up with a notification.
Sherlock looks toward John. His back is to Sherlock. He’s obviously not asleep and his shoulders are tense, waiting. Sherlock slips on the shirt and tries not to focus on the feel of it on his skin. It’s such a light weight and yet it feels like an armor John has offered to him. Sherlock takes his place in the bed on his back and though he’s already warm he gets under the blankets as well. John doesn’t appear to be cold, but in case he is still feeling the chill of the water...well Sherlock can’t help but want to provide any heat he can, do anything he can to help ease him. After tonight John must feel renewed anger. Once again Sherlock’s life has brought pain to John's.
“Oh.” John thinks back to that night and how they finally said it. He smiles. “So you and Lestrade?”
John Watson, 1.7 meters tall, cardigan wearing. A sly smile on his face. A quiet confidence that no one seems to know where it originates. John knows. Because John did not leave three continents with a smile just for no good reason. No, he did it because he's always had that knack, that gift for telling what pleases a person, what their core needs. It's not a trick, not a ruse. He just pays attention to people just like Sherlock pays attention to clues. Having the knowledge of what Sherlock needed, wanted wasn't something John considered using. And he didn't. So perhaps sometimes he mentioned that Sherlock was brilliant right before he needed him to get rid of some disgusting spores in the fridge. Sherlock always complied after the praise. This was good, useful. He didn't abuse the knowledge because he had a sneaking feeling that Sherlock was well aware of it. John assumed he was letting it continue as he got something out of it too.
Until it came time for Sherlock to ask Mycroft for help in a case and Sherlock wouldn’t budge. It lasted for two long days until John went to see Mrs. Hudson for tea.
“I’ll try.”  Sherlock shifts. “The flat will take about a fortnight with Mycroft’s people working round the clock to repair the damage.”
Sherlock was the last person he texted to let him know he'd be a bit late picking up Rosie. There was a reply that simply said. "Yes." and John's response of "Thanks."
Tonight was a repair and renewal and something even more. But there’s a connection still missing, words still unsaid.
“Did it happen when you were away?” John asks after long minutes. Sherlock wars between saying the obvious about the scars or explaining how John is forcing him to say the obvious about them. But he’s aware the desire for either is simply a way to avoid the subject. He can't always offer honesty about his life, but in this instance he can.
John pulled him in by his scarf and kissed him. And it wasn't a mistake this time. He pulled back after long minutes.
“It’s okay. I know. It works out because it’s not just a praise kink. It’s only a kink for you to praise me.  So at least I know it won’t ever be abused.”
He explained to John, and only John, exactly why he was there, why he did it, and he asked John to tell him if it was all for nothing.
In the morning John wakes before Sherlock. Eyes blinking slowly as the light peaks in. He wrinkles his nose and tries to move his hand to scratch an itch, but finds his hand is intertwined. He opens his eyes fully to confirm who is in bed with him--Sherlock. A few warring feelings start to rear their head. He doesn’t remember doing this, wonders if it was him or Sherlock who took the other’s hand. It’s a loose grasp but the feeling is nice, grounding. A smile begins to form on his lips.
Sherlock nods in return then gently eases the shirt from John’s hands. It's only then that John realises he'd been clutching it tight. Sherlock slips on the shirt, looks down at the figure on the front. No recognition appears on his face and John finds that to be a damn shame. He’ll make plans to educate Sherlock about the brilliant Ziggy Stardust.
Sherlock doesn’t appear to notice, his mind seems focused elsewhere. John waves a final goodbye and they all disconnect. Sherlock hands John his phone and in exchange John places a glass of the very lovely smelling scotch in Sherlock's hands. They both take a sip of the drink and look at one another.
John touched the screen and brought up the keyboard and began typing. He just wanted to gauge if Sherlock was up (though he knew he would be) and if he wanted to talk (he didn't know that though the man rarely did).
But it did happen. And it kept happening every night when he closed his eyes. It continued to happen when he found just a moment of peace, that image invaded his every thought, every corner of his heart. Then Mary came along.
“Yes,” John said. They spent the night in with Sherlock telling John about the very first case he and Lestrade solved together.
“Sherlock, it doesn’t take a genius to figure it out. An ex-assassin just happens to take a nursing gig at Sherlock Holmes’s friend’s practice. Yeah it wasn’t an accident.”
John whimpers. Sherlock smiles but keeps his finger in place, even as John opens his mouth and darts out a tongue to lick at it.
John showers and shaves and dresses. He cleans the dishes in sink but leaves Mary's mug where she last left it, in the sink waiting for him to wash because it was his turn.
“Sorry.” John says. He doesn’t elaborate beyond that. Sherlock is both grateful and frustrated. There is still a conversation to be had. He knows what it’s like when they hide things from each other. It never ends well. No matter which side it’s on.
Ella had told him to close his eyes and focus on a clean white room where the world outside was still, calm, fine. But he couldn't close his eyes right now. No, right now he needed to look around the room and focus on things which meant here and now he was alive and things were okay.
When the toast pops up a few moments later John takes out both pieces. He puts a healthy coating of jam on one and hands it to Sherlock.
"Nothing." "Nothing." Both his mother and Mycroft say at the same time. Sherlock's eyes narrow. He wouldn't normally ask, but the time for secrets in this family has to come to an end or at least a respite.
Sherlock slides into the bed to the nearest side, legs up. John slides in as well to the far side by the table Sherlock had pulled close. He takes his drink from the table and hands Sherlock his.
"Oh God. Sherlock. Sherlock," John says. He doesn't even open his eyes. He reaches blindly until his hand finds the curly head of hair and he winds his fingers into it. He holds the head in place and thrusts up. "Oh please?" He says. And then the tongue is flat and motionless. Which is the cue to John to fuck wildly into Sherlock's open mouth. It's not uncommon for Sherlock to let John do this as they all enjoy it, but it is rare for John to let go with such wild abandon. But he needs this now more than anything. He needs this all to be real.
Sherlock kisses John on the day he moves back in. He even allows John to chose the code for the security alarm. Then, of course, changes it when John sentimentally chooses 0129 for the day they met.
Great, John thinks. The only drawback to the pullout is when you get up you're guaranteed to disturb the other person. John pulls down the blankets and starts to extricate himself. He stretches and turns over and there’s really no other option, so he climbs over Sherlock, tries not to wake him but as he’s climbing it becomes impossible.
John dips his mouth to Sherlock’s neck then. He gives a gentle suck just...there. In that place he's always wanted to taste.  Sherlock doesn’t stop one sound then, he clutches at John’s arms.
He mimes pouring a drink into a cup. Sherlock nods at him and silently mouths ‘double.’  John gives a tight smile and reaches for two large glasses.
“What’s wrong?” John says. He moves without thinking, sets his mug down, and reaches out to Sherlock’s shoulder which seems to be aching him.
Sherlock says nothing. He watches her walk from one room into the next. She is wearing a long black gown but no shoes. Her hair is cascading around her face. And her lips are painted a dark, deep red. She also wears a necklace that upon first glance is a long, silver charm but Sherlock had seen it in use, hidden inside is a quick acting sleep drug that even the strongest of drug users would find it hard to fight. At least he did.
John smiled and hoped Sherlock was as well. He waited for him to reply but then decided to add more of his own. To let himself just be honest for a bit and figure the rest out later.
“About you?!” John’s voice is twinged with hurt, anger and he’s not sober enough to keep his voice level.
“Oh,” John says.  He remains silent for a moment then he laughs. And laughs some more. He turns to look at Sherlock who seems thoroughly confused and he can’t help but laugh even more at that. “It’s just.” He laughs more. “I kinda’ figured that out a while ago.”
John's heart beat so loud that he had to take deep breaths because he had absolutely had no idea what Sherlock was going to say. And those fuckin dots were driving him crazy.
John: Not while I was balancing a toddler on one shoulder and a bag of peppa pig toys on the other for one.
“Were too,” Sherlock says. He places his food down beside him, leans back in his chair. John could swear he was doing the lean back of the very full.
"So you bring me here to apologise and then ask for help you don't even need. I am busy. What do you want?"
They’ve been at this for about an hour and Sherlock is no closer to figuring out the rules of the overly complicated game that John and his bunkmates created over a few months during his last campaign in Afghanistan. They’d created it to be so utterly complicated as to last through a long night of patrol.
“You’re so good with her.” John said in a hushed voice, clearly not wanting to disturb her sleep. “She loves you to pieces, you know.”
“So why not someone else? We’re not exactly low-key infiltrates. People know us. Know we’re not a couple.” John’s colour had returned a bit, though his face and stance just screamed
When they were starting to clear up the house after the whole Eurus debacle, John brought a crib and declared that he and Rosie would be staying over during the renovations. To help out.
“O…kay.” The therapist stammered, making a note with a shaking hand. “Thank you for being open with me. Let’s let this sink in a bit and end our session here.”
Baker Street was a flurry of activity the next morning. Sherlock woke to find John already instructing one of Mycroft’s nannies on Rosie’s timetable and diet. Groggily, he made his way to the kitchen and nearly tripped over the bag John had already packed and set aside.
So the wallpaper was hung and historically accurately graffitied, the armchairs and table and rug all cleaned up and carefully positioned to make an echo of their past. There, a tribute to the simpler times.
Sherlock plopped down on the floor next to him, reclining to face the crib, just as John was. “I’m quite fond of her. Maybe because she looks like you. Eats just as neatly, too.”
“It seems like you have a good relationship, even if life can be a bit hectic. Can you tell me what actually led you to seek therapy?”
Soft, warm lips descended upon his and his mind went blank. It was… it was transcendent. Every thought and worry quieted instantly as all his senses directed to this moment, this one perfect moment between them. John’s lips moved gently against his and he moved with him, not knowing how he knew what to do. It was a chaste kiss, just feeling and caressing. Instinctively, he pressed back a bit firmer, wanting, needing. A hand came up to his cheek, calloused yet soft. Sherlock whimpered. He felt simultaneously completely overwhelmed and utterly at peace. His brain wasn’t working. All he knew was that they should keep kissing, definitely press their lips together again and again, breathing each other’s breaths…
“So… should we practice? I mean… first kisses are awkward as hell. We’ll be caught for sure if we just start necking clumsily. Jesus, how embarrassing would
. Because he could live without everyone else, but not John. It scared him, it rattled him to his core that he’d become
“Well,” he muttered, meeting his gaze. “she’ll have to get in line. There’s only one consulting detective in the world and he’s taken.”
“Oh, come on, John!” Mrs Hudson shook his arm. “It’s hardly a big step for the two of you… if you haven’t taken that step already.” She added with a wink.
“Would it really be that bad? I mean, to pretend we’re a couple? It’s just some hand holding and calling each other sweetheart or honeybun or whatever ridiculous pet name we think up.”
Sherlock looked at the therapist. “Right. My turn.” He drew his legs back and sat up straight. Oh boy. John suddenly felt a bit nervous.
Like proper British gentlemen, they spent the next two hours completely ignoring the fact that they were going on a couples retreat. Sherlock refused to touch the manila folders that still resided on his chair. Instead he sat at the desk to write down his latest findings in clothing fibre analysis.
“I have made reservations in your name. You will be expected tomorrow at noon. I suggest you spend that time to sort out your backstory. Dr. Watson, I have made arrangements for little Miss Watson to be cared for by several well-trained nannies. After all, seven days is a long time to be undercover.”
“Sshh. Sshh.. it’s alright girl, it’s alright.” Then to John, “get some sleep, I’ll go downstairs. I’ll bring her up when she’s out again.”
Their therapist, Miss Wilby, had indulged their small-talk and deflections for the better part of their first session. They had met her that afternoon, when a woman in her mid-thirties with beautiful dark hair had welcomed them warmly into her office in one of the smaller blocks surrounding the courtyard at the back of the house.
. I discovered to my dismay, but certainly not to my surprise, that there is no such thing as a ‘happily ever after’. I remain sceptical of his commitment, I’ve overestimated him before in that regard. Don’t misunderstand, he is fiercely loyal, but he is terribly hesitant about his sexuality. Oh, and he also has internalized homophobia due to his abusive father and probably some incidents in his military career that have ingrained in him that it’s quite dangerous to act upon his suppressed homoerotic feelings. Of course it would be fine to let sleeping dogs lie, if I wasn’t keen to have a deeply committed relationship with the man I love.”
know you. They know you claim not to be in a relationship, but isn’t it always the ones who deny the loudest? All you would need to add is a bit of physicality and no one would doubt you were together. Thanks to your fame, it is well known that you are living together and raising little Miss Watson. People want to believe you are in a relationship. Your notoriety certainly helps your cover.”
He reached over to rummage in his bag that he’d left on the back seat. But as he felt around, he closed his hand around an item that he had specifically
“Well, all lies should stick as closely to the truth as possible. Especially if we’re going to keep up the charade for several days. You have many fine qualities and virtues, John, and being truthful is my least favourite. I believe it would be in our best interest if we give you as little improvisation as possible.”
“Maybe. I- I think. Yeah.” And damn him if that didn’t sound like a squeak. They were facing each other, but neither of them moved.
“It’s okay, just go. Can I do anything more from here? I’m nearly done with Tanisha’s Twitter timeline and it’s looking like another dead end.” Tanisha Merchant, civilian, 42 of Basingstoke, was the long time partner of Kendra Corby, 41, one of Mycroft’s agents.
“Well, she apparently does agree with me. Besides, she might learn something through osmosis and solve the case.” But he tugged the folder away and returned it to the safety of the desk either way. Rosie looked confused, but then pointed one hand to him and pointed the other to the kitchen. Then she clapped her hands and giggled again.
He’d kissed a fair few people in his day, so he felt completely confident in saying that this kiss had been special. His first kiss with a man, that ought to win a podium place at least. But even aside from that, it had been a special kiss. His heart had skipped an actual beat or two and an unnameable warmth had suddenly flooded him.
“Has it occurred to you that you stand very little chance of solving the case if Mycroft hasn’t been able to?” Sherlock said pointedly.
It had been four long years since the end of ‘before’, two of which John Watson had spent mourning his friend and trying to rebuild his life. The third year started dramatically with the return of Sherlock Holmes, but also saw John’s marriage and the birth of his daughter. The fourth year… well, no one really liked to talk about the fourth year. That was probably the reason John and Sherlock so desperately longed for ‘before’.
“I should go.” Reluctantly he got to his feet, leaving the army doctor on the floor. He walked off in a slightly disoriented manner.
“Why is everyone up so early?” He muttered to no one in particular, rummaging around the cupboards for a clean tea mug. As he poured his tea, he let out a huge yawn. He’d slept… weirdly. Good, but restless. He’d had strange dreams, fantastical even. He normally deemed dreams an utter waste of brain energy, but there had been an element of happiness to this dream. He knew of course what had caused that, but in the spirit of efficacy, he compartmentalized that events of the previous night to a safe room in his Mind Palace.
Not that Sherlock himself was any different when it came to brotherly affection, but then again, he only tortured his brother to acceptable levels. If Mycroft’s agents hadn’t been directly targeted, he might have even thought that this was all one big joke.
“I think she just really misses Mary, you know.” The doctor whispered. “It sucks, knowing I can’t give her everything she needs.”
But of course, he merely needed to turn his head slightly to the left and there would be irrefutable proof that life had changed. Because of course it had changed. For the better? Absolutely yes. For the worse? Definitely yes. There was his child, his daughter who didn’t have a mother anymore. His daughter, whose father was now living in a London bachelor pad with the man who meant more to him than anyone else.
“A couple of what?” Sherlock asked, rising fear clear in his voice. John didn’t need to hear Mycroft’s reply to know the answer. A block of ice settled in his stomach.
They fell into an easy routine. Well, as easy as routines could become with a child. John would make breakfast for the three of them, then bring Rosie to day-care on his way to the surgery. Sherlock worked cases that sometimes took him out of the house for a day or two at a time, but mostly he seemed to be mindful of their newfound domestic rhythm. He’d even surprised John by cooking one night. It was the worst pasta John had had since his uni days, but somehow he grinned at the detective across the table as if it was the best meal he’d ever had.
“Careful, Sherlock, those are my men you’re talking about.” A dangerous gleam shone in the pale eyes.
Can’t think about that. They were on good terms now. He had to enjoy it while it lasted. Even if the firing squad was planned for noon that day.
wanted to be the one to seamlessly slot into the gaping hole in John’s heart. But bony, skinny, awkward
After a chaotic departure from Baker Street – because honestly, how else could they depart? – John enjoyed the monotony of the M4. Sherlock had, to exactly no one’s surprised, failed to be ready on time, resulting in slapdash throwing of clothing and toiletries. It hadn't helped that Mrs. Hudson had inserted herself into the fray and insisted she stuff some extra sandwiches in John's bag for the road. But amidst all the chaos, they’d managed to extract themselves, give Rosie a good cuddle and kiss goodbye, and set off.
. He didn’t want to look up and watch John. What if John was glad the moment didn’t happen? He couldn’t bear that if he saw that -
“Don’t let her eat that, please.” John’s tone was one of suppressed amusement. “I don’t think that’s one of the five a day.”
without getting interrupted. He looked at his friend, who was slouched on the couch, long legs stretched out. He was looking at the ceiling, head cocked, as if weighing John’s response. Ultimately, he merely pursed his lips and nodded once, as if to say ‘yep, that’s about right’. John’s barrage of his misdoings hadn’t fazed him in the slightest. Well, obviously, because John had voiced them often enough.
Sherlock smirks, eying John’s frame speculatively. “Then you’d best hope your next move isn’t too far a stretch.”
Sherlock freezes for a second, his eyes wide, before a smirk breaks over his features. “I forfeit.” With that statement Sherlock throws his arms around John and slams their mouths together, both of them falling flat on the floor, John flush on top of Sherlock.
"Well I think two might be the limit for the flat." John turned away from kissing Sherlock to look at Sherlock. John's eyes set in worry and fear that he'd done something wrong, but Sherlock held up a hand. "Trust me, John, Sherlock. I understand."
Kate doesn't exit the vehicle, but instead turns off the engine and takes out her phone. Sherlock walks up the steps, reaches for the doorbell then decides she already knows he's here so he simply turns the door handle, which gives way immediately, and he enters.
John tried to laugh, but with the evidence of Sherlock’s desire pressing against his hip, it came out more like a strangled mewl. He all but ripped his shirt over his head, and four hands helped pull his pajamas and pants off, tossing all items carelessly over the side of the bed. Once they were both completely naked, Sherlock pressed his body closer again, lining up their erections as he captured John’s lips for another searing kiss. John groaned, and all but forgot to breathe as Sherlock pumped his hips experimentally, rubbing their lengths together.
Do you know? Did you hear? I sit here on the plane that carries me away from my beloved London, away from you, and I wonder if you heard it. Did you hear what I was trying to tell you behind those well chosen words we exchanged? Seemingly meaningless they were, but I didn’t know how else to express it. Not with her. HER. There. Like a shadow. A spectre.
Sherlock jerks his head sharply to look at Mycroft, “He said he didn’t read it. He told me he threw it in the fire. It was in the fireplace at our parents’ house at Christmas.”
Sherlock is clinging to John, pressing his open mouth to John’s neck, giving sloppy kisses between his moans as he gets closer to his climax. John wants nothing more than to see him let go, to relax his control and truly come apart in his arms. John can feel Sherlock getting closer, his cock grows even harder in his hand, and Sherlock’s hips start to stutter in their rhythm.
“It’s fine, Sherlock. It’s all fine.” He smiled then, but it held none of it’s usual joy in it. It was sad, and a bit wistful, and something in Sherlock’s chest cracked right down the middle.
The wedding. Sherlock practically planned the whole thing. Honestly, John couldn’t tell you what colour the flowers were, or the bridesmaid dresses were. But Sherlock knew. John was amazed. He’d thought Sherlock would treat Mary the way he’d done all his other girlfriends, with disdain and ridicule. But Sherlock seemed to genuinely like her, going out of his way to make her feel welcome, even inviting her along on cases a couple of times. John had hated that, hated splitting one second of his time with Sherlock with Mary. And the two of them, always chatting about this and that, like old friends. John longed to shout at the pair of them. In all the madness, he just got swept up, pushed along, and before he knew it, he was pledging to love and honour Mary Morstan till death they do part. It wasn’t until the speeches started that he realised that he may have made a huge mistake.
“Fine.” Sherlock removes his dressing gown and stands at the edge of the mat clad only in his loose grey pajama bottoms and a ratty t-shirt. The bottoms are slightly loose, draped artfully across his hips. John can see the sliver of pale skin between where the bottoms start and the shirt has ridden up, and has to tear his eyes away and upwards, thoughts of trailing his lips across that expanse flooding his brain.
Those nights Sherlock seems to know instinctively what John needs. Or maybe he hears him, tossing and turning, sometimes screaming his name. But either way, he is there in the flash of an eye, pressing soft kisses to John’s temple, threading their fingers together. Letting John skim his fingers over the pulse point in Sherlock’s neck. “I’m here,” he’ll whisper. A soft reminder of his presence. And John is grateful. Grateful that Sherlock will press his body against his own, and comfort him back to slumber.
Sherlock lets out a low groan, his hands grabbing at John’s back, his hips, struggling to bring him closer. “That was, ah, rather the point,” he pants.
John nods, “Nice to meet you Doctor,” he croaks, his voice thick with disuse. “I’m imagining it went ok, since we’re talking and all.”
Chuckling, John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple. “You realize you could have just asked for a cuddle.”
There’s so much John could tell them about who Sherlock really is. What he is truly like. But it’s like a treasure. It’s enough that he knows. That he knows Sherlock wept the first time they made love, burying his face in John’s neck and whispering “I love you” through his tears. That Sherlock hates playing Brahms but will do it for John, only for John, to soothe his nightmares when they strike. That Sherlock loves to have his head stroked, and will lay for hours in John’s lap, quietly enjoying his ministrations like a cat.
John was grateful for Sherlock’s ability to summon cabs on command. He was thrumming with pent up arousal, desire for Sherlock racing through his blood. The groping and quick snog they had shared in the club was just the spark that had set everything aflame, and now he was on fire. He hoped that the cab ride back to Baker Street would be a quick one.
