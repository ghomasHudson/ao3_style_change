“There are other ways, Dean,” Cas whispers in his ear, turning to press a kiss into heated skin.
He doesn’t care anymore. Cas loves him.
“What happened, Dean?” Cas murmurs quietly. “Were you not feeling well? Or did something set you off?”
myself, Sam, I was doing my damn job. There’s a difference. But maybe a paper pusher like you wouldn’t be able to spot it, huh?” he says sharply, just about fed up with everyone around him trying to coddle him.
“Shit,” he gulps, breathing Cas in desperately. “Your scent. Oh my god, you smell good, Cas. So good. I can scent you now that we’re out of the tub.
He refuses to let Dean stand on the stool to finish wrapping the tree, but that was his only veto. Now that the lights are done, they open bunch of the plastic boxes Cas bought containing ornaments of all kinds of shapes and colors.
Shaking himself out of his thought, he takes a deep breath and knows what he has to do.
There’s a pause, and he thinks Sam might hang up on him, but all he says is, “Not giving up curse words, I see. Want to put your money where you mouth is?”
“You won’t,” he sighs back, letting his legs wrap themselves around Cas’s waist. “Feels good.”
What gives?
He looked like death warmed over.
“You good, man?” his brother asks from right behind him, making him flinch in surprise.
“Well- you should not be putting so much strain on your - ”
“I realize that. I’m real sorry, brother. It was selfish of me,” Benny says softly.
The scent of distress trickles through the air, the first real scent to break through the smell of heat, and Castiel wished it were anything but this. Leaning forward to kiss the spot on Dean’s brow where it’d been knitted together, he puts more strength in to his touches, stroking Dean’s stomach more firmly. Dean closes his eyes.
“I don’t want your pity party, buddy. I’ll beat you next year,” Dean promises.
Not like the showers were helping with anything but his scent though, he thought bitterly, glaring at his towel covered dick he could feel hanging limply between his legs.
Blinking blurrily in the dark room, he held still to listen to Cas’s footsteps and his low whispers retreating farther and farther away.
“Just wait a minute, Dean,” she cuts in softly, “Let me say my peace and then you can try unsuccessfully to talk yourself down. You oughtta hear this…I’ve known Castiel for some years now. And in all the time that I’ve known him, he ain’t
, didn’t they?- but if he
It’s the first time he’s really felt the pup move since before his heat.
It was almost like things were getting back to normal.
Cas’s brows shoot straight up and his lips freeze against Dean.
He’d give it two more hours. If he still felt like his apartment was a fucking boat, he’d call in sick again. Might as well, since this might be the last time before he goes back to his workaholic ways. He could count how many days of work he’d missed on one hand before all this shit happened. That was probably the only reason Bobby hadn’t chewed him out the way he probably deserved….and because he’d known him before his voice cracked, but whatever.
Cas just shakes his head. “I’ll be right back.”
And with just the right amount of alcohol and sweet talk, he might get that. Oblivion. Just for a little while. After the universe was done taking a shit on his life, that was.
Dean is frozen, tense in his arms for one second.
He holds it up. “
Soon his team is huddled in a circle and he’s giving his team the pep talk of the century, and then that’s done too.
Shutting the door as quietly as possible and locking it behind him, he goes on the search for a certain Alpha.
be this friggin’ big,” he chuckles awkwardly, patting her back and blonde curls.
“May I?” Cas asks, a note of pleading in his voice.
“No... No!,” he choked, trying to get the words out through his sudden panic, “I didn’t, dad. I don’t know how you could think that! I was sick, I swear!”
“Put a pillow underneath you,” Cas pants. “Just in case.”
He needed to get his shit together, stat.
his words dissolve into a moan when Cas shifts his legs apart and then up so he can dive in right between his legs.
“You’re so beautiful, Dean,” Cas pulls away to pant against Dean’s neck. “So beautiful. It’s not even remotely fair.”
Don't listen to 'All of Me' by John Legend and think of Dean and Cas. Don't fucking do it unless you want to get super emotional.
“You heard me,” Sam says gravely, readjusting the camera from his side so that most of his upper body is now on screen. “Every day. Checking in with me to see if you’re alright. He’s desperate, Dean. The guy just wants to make sure you and the pup are safe.”
Holy shit- he’d
But it’s not a good night, not at all.
His fragile hold on his control snaps.
Good.
“Yes, Dean?” he asks curiously, turning back to face Dean.
to help. It killed me to deny him. And it pains me to deny Michael now.”
“So where is the poor son of a bitch, Cassie? Or is this like your “girlfriend” in sixth grade? I knew she sounded too good to be true-” he’s saying, voice high and reedy as he chuckles- until Cas sees Dean.
Fuck.
“What? I’m not - ”
“No Dean, I don’t know. If this particular conversation is going to upset you, then I’d rather avo -”
He strokes Cas’s back with numb fingers.
After he hung up the phone, he didn’t know what to do. But after catching a whiff of himself again, he decided a shower was definitely in order. He’d only been wearing a shirt and boxers to bed, but they felt stifling; especially his boxers which were plastered to his skin with slick. He needed to get that shit off him right now- it was making him gag- and he had to fight the urge to cover his nose so he couldn’t smell it anymore.
Dean is sitting in the bath tub, fully clothed and staring at nothing. He’s sunken down until only his head and the tops of his hands are out of the water, and he’s pale and shivering. But there’s no blood, and Dean is breathing, he reminds himself, trying to quell his rising panic. He needs to stay calm for Dean. Obviously this was hitting Dean extremely hard.
“SHUT UP CAS!” he yells, whipping around and growling at him. “You don’t understand. NONE of you understand!”
“Then help me to,” Cas begs quietly, sitting up slowly. “Please, Dean. Let me help you.”
“Everything is set for your trip this Friday so there should be no problem with - ”
With Cas’s careful input, and almost an hour of Dean struggling in and out of clothes in the fucking tiny changing room, they manage to find two bags worth of stuff. He ends up with about five pairs of pants, three shirts, two jackets and a sweater Cas insists on. Over all not a bad haul.
- that comes as soon as he hears the lock click almost sends him to his knees.
When Cas’s anxiety only spikes, Dean rolls his eyes and grabs the front of his shirt.
“Okay, Dean,” Cas scoffs against his skin. “
Closing his eyes and sighing, he works his hips onto the fingers inside him. He’s all instinct as he lifts himself up a few inches and slams himself back down, impaling himself again and again until he’s bouncing on Cas’s lap mindlessly. His wet hole making the ride smooth and easy, like he’s done this before.
tired enough not to give a flying fuck about how embarrassed he should be as presses his nose to it and finally drifts into a light sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
Laying on his side facing away from Castiel, he can’t see Dean’s face, but he can hear his choked, ragged breathing, and see the way his entire body is shaking.
“Shhhh,” Cas hushes him again, but this time Cas actually listens to him.
“Alright, alright. Come back in here and help me,” Dean chuckles reluctantly.
“Dean,” he growls roughly, “Come. Come on my tongue.”
He hears and feels a deep breath being taken, and he does his best to mimic it, seemingly lost in his own body, unable to gain control of anything at the moment.
He’d hit rock bottom, he’d reached his lowest of lows, but Cas had been there to pick up the pieces and make him semi whole again.
He knows the second it registers with Dean, because his eyes go wide, and his cheeks darken as new slick leaks outs without his permission in response. Holy shit, that was weird. Since he hadn’t produced slick since he was fifteen, he was totally unprepared for the way his body reacted to an Alpha’s arousal. Fear shot through him at the thought of someone else smelling him like this, of knowing what he was. Holy
is implied.
“Do you want to come, Dean? Would you like for me to get you off with my fingers? We don’t have time and you will be too sore for anything more. But I think I could do this fairly quick. Is that what you want?” Cas purrs, slipping the tip of his finger inside him again. He tucks down to kiss Dean’s stomach, but the look he aims down at Dean is purely predatory.
They didn’t need a repeat of his freak out from before.
But Cas follows him silently as he all but runs for the shelter of his car, staying one pace behind him until Dean unlocks his door and is about to get in.
you say anything, Dean.”
And then Cas swivels his hips just right, and Dean is clenching tight around Cas, coming so hard he thinks he might black out again.
at his apartment or even at Cas’s house. There are cars all around him, and it looks like they are in front of some kind of store.
Sleep had sounded appealing with the toll the heat was already doing on his body, but he was restless and
“I think I can.”
He flounders for words, mouth opening and shutting but no sounds pass his lips. Miraculously, Cas seems to understand.
“You don’t know as much as you think you do,” Dean scoffs.
It was hard to hate yourself when someone treated you like the best thing in the entire world.
At his words, Dean takes a deep breath, and actually supports his head a little bit as Cas continues to run them through his hair. Bingo.
“Yo!” he hears Ash call back immediately, slow, bouncy footsteps coming closer. “What can I do for you today, amigo?”
“Normally yes, but it’s still very early so she can see you before any of her appointments. Plus, I consider most of the people I work with family and vice versa. Which makes you their family as well. We take care of our family, Dean,” Cas smiles down at him.
“Dean?!” Cas says, alarmed now. “Dean, what’s wrong?”
Gathering him to his chest, he looks around for a towel, feeling helpless for a second, before spotting one hanging on the hook. This is where it gets tricky. He’s going to need to remove Dean’s clothing now, if he’s to get Dean appropriately warm. But Dean is lax in his arms, head leaning against Castiel’s now soaked chest, eyes still firmly clenched shut. He could almost pass for sleeping except for the line of tension in Dean’s arms, gripped tight across his own chest.
“You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about!” Dean spits angrily, standing abruptly to tower over Castiel, “You have NO fucking clue!”
Throwing his head back in laughter at Dean’s choice of words, Cas’ hands leave Dean’s thighs in favor of running his fingers over Dean’s belly.
Sam throws his head back, a full body laugh that his him shaking his head at Dean, trying to catch his breath. “What?” he gasps, “Dean, you’re not fat! You’re friggin pregnant!”
Dean sleeps for the rest of the day.
Okay… so he knew a lot more than he thought he did, but the facts remained the same. They were not ideal parents. Not even fucking close. And it wouldn’t be fair to go into this half assed, especially when he was almost sure he didn’t want to in the first place. It was fucking scary. How was he supposed to be responsible for another human being when he could barely get himself out of bed everyday? It just didn’t make sense.
“Fuck you, dude,” he says, but he can’t help but smile a little. That had gone a
That was a first.
“Yes. But Dean. There is something you should know…” Cas’s voice becomes hoarse, his words breaking a few times as he speaks now. “Despite my talk of family and the relationships I have with them, they are not my blood. My only family died when I was twelve, and I
“Cas?” he mumbles, his voice still hoarse from sleep.
“Whoever that is, we’re not buying,” he calls sternly. “Go away.”
With his eyes closed and Cas’s scent permeating the warm, enclosed car, soothing piano tinkling in the background, he’s not so sure he wants his time with Cas to be over.
“Fuck,” he groans, reaching over to grab at the strategically placed box of tissues on his nightstand. He brings a wad of them up to his nose to try and stem the flow of blood. “That’s been happening when it gets too cold. Goddammit, I knew I should’ve brought some blankets with me,” his voice comes out muffled and gross, only causing Sam’s face to become even more worried.
Cas is carefully trying to extricate himself from around Dean, knot having gone down and slipping out from between his legs, scooting slowly away from his back and taking al his heat with him.
“No. I don’t think so.”
Cas sighs loudly but complies, locating the lube and climbing back on the bed. It doesn’t take more than a nuzzle to get Dean to lay back down. The way Cas is looking at him right now has Dean closing his eyes. It’s too much.
“I can’t, Cas,” he struggles to get out. His heart is beating so fast right now, and his body just wanted relief. Just staying on the phone with the Alpha was taking all of his focus. “It
“I’m sorry, Dean. I’m so sorry for whatever happened, for whoever made you feel like you were some how less. Because you are so much
Cas looks relieved and apologetic as he nods, stepping through the door and towards the toilet. Cas sets him carefully on his feet right in front and then steps out of the room.
You smell like happiness, Dean. I’ve never smelled anything like it.”
to touch him, he sighs in relief when the tip of a finger works itself against his hole. Spreading the slickness and massaging it while it tries to clench around the digit, Dean moans and opens his legs further to Castiel’s teasing.
In and out, in and out, in and out and
“You did not just quote the princess bride when you’re about to- oh fuck!”  Dean yelled as Cas hoisted Dean’s legs up to hold around his hips with one hand, and led the tip of his dick to Dean’s entrance with the other.
Cas tilts his head up again. “You don’t know? Dean, I understand that you are obviously upset right now, but shutting me out is not the answer. You are not alone anymore Dean, and you don’t have to
” he smirks, finally offering Dean his hand.
telling the truth.
“Dean. Dean Winchester? There must be a mistake…” Cas says, ignoring Dean’s comment and continuing to frantically look through the papers in his hand, pausing to look back at Dean a few times in disbelief. Of course this would be happening to him.
He can’t decide what he wants first in this moment as Cas’s grip slips down to his legs, hitching them up and around himself. On one hand, he want’s Cas’s bite like he wants his next breath. On the other hand, his lower half is pretty much aching for Cas to be inside him already. It’s been too long, and the need only gets stronger as the seconds tick by.
While both their movements are awkward at first, sleep no longer claiming their inhibitions, the friction between them quickly has them nearing the desperation they’d gotten to before.
“It’s long enough,” Cas grouses, looking away.
“If you don’t like it, don’t do it, Bobby! It’s as simple as that!”
“Who told you were a disappointment boy?” comes Bobby voice, now surprisingly soft in the tense atmosphere.
“Of course I do,” Cas breathes. “Not just physically. Mentally and emotionally as well. But the changes are
“Cas, you goof,” Dean laughs, trying to keep his balance in order to keep his weight off of his left foot. “I meant that you can stay in here.”
“I said our first time,” Cas soothed, seemingly to read Dean’s worry, “if you recall, I told you I’d make you scream my name repeatedly. This is a marathon, not a race, Dean. And I intend to pace myself.”
“Of course, Dean,” he says softly, soundly oddly relieved. Apparently Dean’s not the only one who doesn’t want to be alone tonight… Or have the other father away than they need to be.
Cas was reading
Although he smiles and closes his eyes when Cas starts to hum along to that damn cd again. It really didn’t hurt when he wasn’t moving, so the entire ride he just pretends this is any other day; with maybe just an extra visit from Cas and a nap.
Pulling away gently, he opens his eyes to see that Dean’s are still closed. With pink cheeks and wind swept hair, Dean takes his breath away.
Sam’s face had gone pale, horror and shock dominating every feature on his face, but Dean can’t understand how he’s surprised. John had never really been subtle with the way he’d treated Dean. Sam was intentionally
When John accused him of it, and when Cas had tried explaining what was happening between them, he’d brushed it off; written it off as two outlandish, too impossible to even imagine. Until now he’s ignored his instincts when they’d insisted they wanted Cas, but now? The idea that they smelled mated didn’t scare him like it used to. Yeah, it was fucking daunting, and they had a lot more time until he would be comfortable seriously contemplating it, but it didn’t feel quite so unrealistic now.
, a word that had always meant the world to Dean but didn’t mean anything when it was Cas’s? All this time he’d been so friggin’ selfish, and he hadn’t even realized.
“Back off Rapunzel,” he wheezes through a tight throat. His fingers are still cradling his pup, so he releases his hold to blindly feel around behind him in order to shove weakly at his brother. “Can’t control it any more than you can control those long locks of yours.”
for the first time in months. For once fucking second, Dean forgets that’s his brother standing underneath the door-frame. But then again, no one that fucking stupid was anything other than a Winchester.
Whimpering in response, Cas gratefully obliged. Withdrawing a little, causing Dean to gasp at the sensation of something moving inside him, he started to rock his hips gently into Dean.
Fucking Gabriel, he laughs to himself, taking the picture in as a whole.
It’s only a few moments later, but when Cas gets ahold of himself again, Dean quickly loses his smug grin when Cas redoubles his effort to make Dean come.
Dean goes pliant as Cas’s hold tightens, but staying still isn’t really an option after the first hard thrust. Cas lifts him almost completely off until only the tip of his dick is still inside before pulling Dean down hard.
cuddling- he thinks as he tucks himself into Cas’s neck, scenting him groggily as Cas mumbles unintelligibly in response.
, Dean?” he punctuates with a thrust that steals all the breath from his lungs. “You are telling me that in a few months, you’ll be even more wet for me, beautiful?” he growls, abandoning whatever sweet moment they were having in favor of gripping Dean tight again and really giving it to him.
“Come on, boy,” Bobby says, much more gentle this time as he carefully approaches Dean. He still flinches when Bobby is only a few inches away and stumbles to his feet, backing away until he feels the wall behind him.
“’Kay,” he mumbles against Cas’s skin, feeling small as the weight of what they’re about to do hits him. He places a kiss against Cas’s chest before nuzzling his way up into Cas’s throat.
to fight.” Jessica pleads.
“What a stinker. Guess it’ll be just like you then,” Lisa giggles. “I’m having a boy. Benjamin. My mate thought it was a little early to name him, but Ben just sounds right.”
“It’s okay, Dean. I’m,” Sam clears his throat, looking up at the ceiling before continuing roughly. “I’m really proud of you, man.”
“Cas-“ he chokes, “I’m pregnant.”
“What was that?” Cas says immediately.
Doing the math quickly in his head, he freezes when a new thought pops into his head. No, that couldn’t be it.
Now though, when Cas offers it to him, he snatches it greedily out of his hands and covers his legs and hands immediately, sighing gratefully and clutching it close.
“Yeah.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
“I hear you,” he says distractedly.
would be more,” Cas sighs, and Dean can see the disappointment in his eyes. “But I was wrong, Dean. So incredibly wrong to think you could change.”
And Cas holds one of his hands again on Dean’s shoulder while he pushes it from behind.
Cas is surprised at first, not expecting the sudden change, but he quickly assimilates the new information and gets with the picture- stepping forward and probably unintentionally puffing himself up.
Cas snorts loudly and lifts himself away so that he can hover over Dean.
It said, “
“How’s the ankle?” Cas’ quiet question has him blinking open eyes he didn’t had shut.
“Just give me the damn sweater, Cas.”
There’s too much worry in Cas’s voice to make a joke of things, so he promises and carefully lets Cas rearrange him so that he’s got his left arm around Cas’s shoulder, Cas’s right arm around Dean’s waist, and Dean’s right hand clasped in Cas’s left.
“But you smell so much better than a pillow,” Dean cuts in. “What the fuck
“Dean,” he says as he hands her the bag.
A big hand lands on his shoulder, turning him to face Benny, and then Benny is pushing him down to take his now vacated seat.
But his skin feels like there are ants crawling underneath it. It was an itch that needed scratching, that needed to be done so he could move on. Done with what, though, he isn’t sure.
“Mmmmm there you are,” Cas murmurs, ducking down to suck on the soft pink skin. “I want to hear you, Dean.”
is stuck in his nose, and his hands shake as he just stands there in shock.
Shit, those are
“Once I told Michael no,” Cas says so quietly that Dean has to lean forward to hear him. “He implied that I was the reason for my brother’s death. That if I had just given in, Luke would still be alive. He was angry and desperate, but the words still feel true.”
“The point of it is to tire me out,” he shrugs innocently, agreeing way too fast. “Might as well try it out sooner rather than later.”
When Dean looks up, totally fucking shocked, Bobby is smiling at him.
“That’s it. Next time,
“Wow, Dean. That’s…that’s amazing. I’m so happy for you, and I’m proud of you, man,” Sam gushes, placing a hand over his heart.

His hand is starting to get clammy from how tightly Cas is holding it.
about hurting another hair on his head, I will fucking kill you. No questions asked, no hesitation.”
“No. I went to a clinic a few weeks back. I was having cramps and was moody as hell. They told me I didn’t need them anymore.”
something other than hatred and disgust and self-pity for once. He couldn’t put a name to what that feeling actually was, but he wanted to feel it again. Again and again until he knew every crevice of it and could seek out others like it and hold on to them forever.
“Sleep, my love. You need your rest.”
Sinking down onto Cas’s fingers until he’s fully seated on Cas’s lap again, he nods frantically against Cas’s shoulder in appreciation and approval as Cas adds another finger inside him.
“Dude, are you sure I’m allowed to wear sweat pants here? It looks kind of nice…” he leaves off, unsure of himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Katie,” he gasps, coming closer, “I told you to wait- Dean?”
As much as the night started being about him, he’s glad he can make it a little about Cas, even if the Alpha is unaware of his motives.
It’s quiet too long, his shoulders too tense with the fight he still yearns to put up, and he can tell Cas reads all of this.
“If I get up, will you make pancakes?”
“I told you to wait-“
He tries to get his hitched breathing under control while Cas scoots back and gently presses his shoulder down, getting him on his back before cradling the opposite shoulder and shifting Dean towards his own chest.
When Dean is finally done, he plops down on his ass for about three seconds before Cas is pulling him onto his lap, dragging Dean until he’s safely cradled between Cas’s arms and legs, face tucked under Cas’s chin again and pressed to Cas’s neck. His whole body is shaking, and his breathing is still out of whack, but the way Cas surrounds him, holding him so tightly he couldn’t fall apart even if he wanted to, has Dean closing his eyes and nuzzling closer.
“Alpha.”
“Dean,” Cas breathes, all traces of his previous smile gone, and the new scent of sadness begins to trickle through the air. Carefully, so carefully that it feels like its happening in slow motion, Cas turns Dean around before hugging him tight to his chest- Dean automatically ducking a little bit so that Cas can pretty much encase him.
It’s fucking freezing when he fights his way out of bed, too lazy to find a shirt, so he wraps his arms around himself and carefully feels his way to the door. Since he pretty much lives at Cas’s house these days, it’s actually not that hard to find his way to Cas’s office.
It just wasn’t something Dean could give. Or
“Cas?” he almost whimpers. He has no control over his voice right now, and he can’t bring himself to feel embarrassed by the desperation in his voice.
Dean cries out again, louder than before, his throat aching, but he can’t stop.
He’s got two hours till work and he still needs to eat and hit up a drugstore.
This time when he makes Cas sit with him, he offers him his banana hot chocolate. It’s pretty cold now, but it still tastes fucking amazing.
Cas can’t see past Dean, so when he takes a step forward he hurriedly tells him to stop.
“This,” he decides throatily, “Just like this, Cas.”
“We’re taking your prissy little Prius?” he grumbles. It felt like Cas just wanted to kick him while he’s down.
sound which leads to an even higher pitched ring.
“Is this what you want Dean?” he asks huskily, leaning in to lick quickly across the head.
“If I remember correctly, you were also having a lot of
enough.
He wouldn’t blame Cas if he stopped being aroused by him. No matter how much it secretly bothered him.
Sam and Jess crack up, and Dean can’t help but laugh a little too. Scooting over enough so that their knees are touching, Dean nudges Cas, smiling himself when Cas finally breaks and looks at him with a suspicious little grin.
Puffy jackets, beanies, gloves, scarfs, and boots. Jess’s cheeks are pink, and he can barely see his brother’s face due to the way his jacket is pulled up passed his chin to shield his face from the frigid air.
Today had really not gone to plan.
- am was something pathetic, something small and disgusting. Sad.”
go to work,” he assures Cas, “But uhh…thanks.”
Cas licks and sucks at his throat, but there’s only the tease of those sharp teeth.
1.) I'll be doing GISHWHES starting this Saturday and it goes on for a week! And I'm SUPER excited for it- shout out to all my gish peeps!
Tears automatically spring to his eyes again(it’s the hormones, dammit!), and throat clogs up as breaths shakily. Silently, he covers Cas’s hands with his own, joy so overwhelming he doesn’t know what to do. He’s never felt like this before.
But Cas doesn’t look phased. He just stares up at Dean and waits, looking just as tired as Dean feels.
The first thing he’s aware of is Cas shifting in bed. He didn’t hear an alarm, there’s no lights on or light peaking through the curtains to give any notion that it’s time to wake up.
“I’m not
happen, because it was a known fact that universe had a vendetta against him. He wouldn’t be able to handle it if something hurt his-
Sam was obviously joking, because all of the blood drains from his face and he’s leaning forwards again. Jess loses her smile instantly.
“Of course, Dean.” He says, relief evident in his voice. How could he have said no anyway? He would do just about anything Dean asked him to at the moment. He had a feeling Dean didn’t do this often. Didn’t let anyone see him vulnerable.
They look each other dead in the eye, and for a moment Dean thinks his brother knows what’s about to go down. But that’s impossible, right? Sure, he knows there is something going on, but without all the details the best he and Jess could do is guess.
Instead of answering verbally, he hears a rustle and then a tissue is being held up to his nose. He side eyes Cas, but Cas is completely focused on him and dead set on doing this for Dean. He only hesitates for a moment.
“Dean,” he says as he squats in front of him again, hands on Dean’s soaking denim clad knees, “I’m going to dry you off now, okay? I will be done soon, and then you can go to bed, alright?”
“Meaning?”
He was going for nonchalant, but he didn’t quite manage it, too much at stake to even pretend to be flippant.
“I can’t even be mad at you for not telling me,” Sam’s voice breaks, “Because I lost your trust. Another reason to apologize,” Sam laughs without a trace of humor. “So again, I am so sorry, Dean. For everything. If you’re willing, I mean if it’s okay, I’d really like to redeem myself to you.”
“I’m used to it,” he sighs, barely audible, cuddling even closer to Cas. It’s the truth, as hard as it is to admit.
“Have you changed your mind about anything else that happened last night, Dean?” Cas asks him softly, breath ghosting over Dean’s face.
If he had to be in this situation, he’s pretty fucking grateful it’s with Cas.
He couldn’t imagine ever hurting Dean. Slowly, very aware of his tented pajama pants, Cas lowered himself back on the bed, placing his hands on his knees where Dean could see them.
“If this pup ends up being a worry wart like you, I swear to god I’m going to sue.”
He couldn’t quit now, he thought, as he took to sucking Cas’s fingers again. He was so fucking close. To what exactly, he wasn’t sure.
that is my cue to leave,” Dean inserts quickly. “Bye guys.”
He just didn’t know what. For now though, it was better for Castiel to keep his distance. For his own good. He was a fucking mess right now, and nobody should have to witness this, he thinks as he forces himself to eat a second piece of buttered toast. He needed to get his shit together. Starting with eating better and more regularly.
Apparently there were a bunch of cases popping up because of bad sea food or something? Symptoms including nausea, fever, and abdominal cramps. So maybe he had that, and he wasn’t dying! God, what had his come to, when he was actually hoping for salmonella, he thought as walked back up to hand Missouri the finished paperwork.  Her eyes immediately went to the checked box at the top, nodding to herself like that was what she’d thought all along.
“Okay, okay,” Dean finally folds. “Back to it then. Sooner rather than later, because I’m kind of starving.”
“You sure are a lot of trouble, huh?” he murmurs down to his bump, resting one hand on top of it while trying not to move anything else. “You gotta be a boy. Only boys can cause this much mayhem in such a short amount of time.”
“Oh.”
“You are simply magnificent, Dean,” he grits through his heavy breathing, riveted by the pink flush that’s coloring Dean’s neck and shoulders now. “You deserve this. You deserve to feel good,” he pants, carefully leaning over again to whisper in Dean’s ear, “Fuck yourself, Dean.”
Hey guys, I decided to say fuck school this week and actually write. Not to mention I met and hugged Misha Collins, Ruth, and Rob. It was a good week. Now I'm about to ruin yours.
Right before the man had slammed the door he heard his dad mutter under his breath, "
Placing Dean down on the closed lid of the toilet, he makes sure Dean is fully sitting up of his one accord before making a grab for the hanging towel.
He maybe, kind of sorta… likes it?
“Come on, Dean,” he says still smiling, “The store awaits.”
“If you touch me, your dick is well in range of a solid punch buddy, and I happen to like your dick.”
Whatever this position lacks in depth, he makes up for in speed.
Dean laughs, shaking his head when Cas makes a questioning sound against his skin.
Noses touching and breaths still coming quick between them, Dean chuckles and looks down. “Told you.”
“That smell,” he moans pathetically, fisting his hands in Cas’s shirt, so overwhelmed, and trying not to gag again. Cas’s scent masks it a little, but not enough.
Dean was so obviously used to dealing with things on his own, choosing to isolate himself needlessly, that when Dean
“Say whatever you want, man. If I got to choose who this kid will take after between me and Sam? I’d hope my kid grows up to be more like him,” he says with finality, hoping Cas won’t argue. That was just his opinion, after all.
“I won’t let go, Jack,” Cas laughs, stepping closer to heave him into a sitting position and then across to the edge of the bed. The whole process makes him feel even bigger than before.
No, no, no, no, no, no,
moves it down. Cas is all hard lines and muscles- way too many for a fucking doctor- as his hand inches further and further to his destination. Puffing quietly against Cas’s neck, he stops his hand’s descent when it reaches Cas’s pajama pants, and Cas stops breathing.
He can smell Cas’s anger, being in such close proximity to him, and it’s distracting when he’s trying to sleep. “How many time do I have to tell you we’re fine? And thanks to your big show of Alpha masculinity,” he says, amused when Cas’s chest instantly puffs up, “I doubt we’ll be seeing John anytime soon.”
He makes quick work of gathering as many towels as he can, only slipping twice in the process to the resounding sounds of Dean’s laugh. But to his surprise, instead of trying to mop up all the water, Cas makes a sort of red carpet-esqe kind of deal starting from the side of the tub all the way to the bedroom.
“Dean, it’s okay, you don’t have to look at me. Just listen, okay?” Sam begins gently. “I know we didn’t grow up the same way. Weren’t raised the same either. I can’t imagine everything you’ve been through, and how you must feel. So much has changed since we were kids, but one thing hasn’t. You have always been and always will be my best friend. We may fight, and there will probably be some quiet times, but I will
He waits.
, changed. It was like he was having a midlife crisis, without the erectile dysfunction and beer belly. He knew he was probably over reacting, but he just couldn’t shake the feeling that he was now something
Does sound pretty damn good. And the wink Cas sends over his shoulder
“Have
“Holy fuck,” Dean exhales, out of breath and incredulous. And a little miffed that Cas is so articulate after having just blown his mind. “You’re so fucking
The water isn’t helping, he realizes in panic.
,” Cas backtracks quickly, “Is that I’m apprehensive as well as excited concerning tomorrow’s festivities. Poorly articulated I admit, but as you often tell me, I’m not the best with words.”
Dean took a deep breath, he knew his dad didn’t want to hear about his problems.
“I know you’re tired, but your stomach has been growling for the past twenty minutes,” he says, keeping his eyes fixed on the road. “Do you mind if we stop? I have a place in mind…”
Cas’s soft smile turns into a smirk.
He will never be enough...
“You are not obligated to return my affections in any way,” Cas starts to speak quickly, hesitance creeping into his voice for the first time all night. “ I just- It felt important that you know-”
Cas blinks down at him, assessing, before some of the heat melts away to something more soft and affectionate.
“Sam, weren’t you just saying how you were a little bummed about not getting to watch Elf this year?” Jess asks to which Sam nods quickly. “And it’s not like we could really go anywhere anyway without hitting some major traffic. Not with all that snow. Our flight isn’t until 8. Might as well bunker down at home base and get comfy.”
“Alrighty then, right this way!”
“Is that a foot?” Cas gasps.
and that’s not just comparatively speaking. Female omegas were sought after from the very beginning, so Dean had internalized Sam’s words as an insult on his kind only, omega males only. Knowing that Jess took offense as well had him liking her even more. It’d been too long since he’d seen that girl.
Snorting as Cas’s lame attempt at a joke, he finally turns to look at Cas. He’s got that stupid look on his face again, the face that makes Dean feel like he could do no wrong. That stupid face Dean kinda sorta likes a lot.
“Let’s get this party started then,” he claps his hands and rubs them together. “Ready Cas? It’s your move.”
He needed him right now.
“Gonna come,” he warns between pants, finger nails digging into Cas’s back in his desperation. He’s so
Finally, Dean let himself really look at the man on his right. Turning just enough to take him in as a whole, he realized the guy actually wasn’t bad looking.
A hand pats his shoulder. But it hurts too bad for him to open his eyes.
Cas smiles against the back of his shoulder and then bears his teeth slightly in a not so gentle bite.
Taking a deep breath, he got himself up off the floor with unsteady limbs to go searching for his cell phone. He’d had to replace his last one after he’d smashed it against the wall all those weeks ago. It was cheap, nothing flashy, and it was pretty easy to find since it only came in a weird metallic green color.
Caught up in his thoughts, he watches his family leave without hearing the actual words being spoken between them. He waves, but the motion is stiff and forced. He’s on autopilot.
“I know what Sam said to you,” she murmurs quietly.
“That smell - ” he manages to choke, “the turkey, I think. Ugh,” he swallows repeatedly to keep down whatever is left in his stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas frowned at him. “Why do you say that like
He’s going to miss this.
Cas breathes a soft laugh, but doesn’t stop his ministrations. “I’m glad you think so, Dean.”
He’s reaching, and he knows he’s reaching, but hopefully Cas doesn’t.
Ever since then, it
Dean’s fingers never relax their grip on Castiel’s back though, and he’s certain there will be half-moon crescents tattooed into his skin for days to come. It seems only fair as he remembers the hickies he’d undoubtedly left on Dean’s neck when he’d lost control of himself for a few minutes in the very beginning.
Castiel.
The spasms hardly quit, only giving him a few minutes rest at a time before his hole was clenching around nothing again, begging for attention.
Cas hesitates before opening his eyes again, and leans back completely against the couch so he’s even with Dean, everything from their shoulders to legs firmly pressed against each other; with both of them staring up at the boring white ceiling.
It’s only nine at night when he pulls into Cas’s driveway.
“Good,” Cas says quietly. “Lean back for a second.”
Quick, fluffy update. Don't kill me.
Cas doesn’t follow him.
So far, Dean’s favorite costumes of the night had been a pair of twins both dressed up as different color leggo pieces. One red, one blue, he’d cracked up when the two of them had each grabbed a candy from the bowl before promptly running into each other. Their boxy frames had them both on their backs, flailing, and unable to get up.The adult walking with them had rolled their eyes like this hadn’t been the first time that had happened tonight before helping them both up and ushering them on to the next house.
Rolling his eyes at Dean’s antics, he doesn’t bother arguing with him. Now that the night is winding to a close, it’s time for Dean to get some rest. Being on his feet for so long tonight had obviously begun to take it’s toll, and after the hours he’d been pulling at the hospital these last few weeks, an early night sounded heavenly.
When they’re a little more dry, Cas drops the towel in favor of scooping up Dean; tucking him under his chin and kissing the top of his head.
Perfect timing too, since the bartender chose that moment to place two shots in front of them both. Dean slid one over in front of him, but made no move to drink it yet.
willingly talked about my feelings?” Dean reasons.
Over and over again, through the numbness that had settled after Cas had delivered the news. They had mixed up his sample with the woman sitting in the lobby with her mate, or Cas had read the test wrong. They had to have made a huge mistake, and the powers that be just wanted to fuck with him again. When he got to the nearest store, he didn’t even care if anyone saw him or fucking scented him, he walked all the way to the fucking
uncomfortable, dude,” Dean snorts. With how huge he is and his now severely sprained ankle, he’s going to be uncomfortable no matter where he ends up. “Unless I can’t scent you. That’s a big no no, I’m guessing.”
Grabbing at his legs again, he spread Dean’s thighs apart and stepped between them. Dean was totally exposed. No clothes or distractions hiding him this time. Dragging his hands from Dean’s hard nipples, across his abs and spread thighs, Cas raked his nails in a light scratch until he was rubbing at his ass again.
, think that?! How could you ever
Slick in a way he hadn’t been since he was fucking fifteen.
The baby kicks every once in a while, making him smile, but he’s thinking back to last night. Because holy
And it did, to some extent. When he went back inside, he was able to lose himself within the inner mechanisms of the car in front of him. If something was broken or damaged in a car, there was always a solution. There was always an answer for the problem at hand, and he could fix it. It was simple, and it was mindless. He’d been doing it for years and years and he found comfort in how everything had it’s place, and everything had it’s function.
“….yeah.”
“I know,” Cas murmurs as he gathers up all the blankets from the floor and lays them one by one over Dean. “I want to hold you so badly that it hurts.”
Hopefully if he doubled his blockers again and used the soaps he usually did, he could slide by his coworkers again with the same bullshit cover. It was fucking risky, but he didn’t see any other options.
Dean’s biting his lip so hard at this point as the tears continue to fall, fingers digging into any part of Cas he can reach, holding on to him and his words like a life line.
“Whatever you’re thinking, knock it off alright?” Cas says. “It’s okay, Dean. I’ve been taking care of myself for
With Cas, with his body, with the whole fucking situation for once. Even though his mind still struggled with the concept of
It was like a nightmare. Or worse- waking up and
Cas pats his fingers. “Let me see,” Cas murmurs.
Usually in this scenario, Cas would try and coax Dean closer, situating them in order to give Dean unlimited access to Cas’s scent, but upon his little revelation, Dean decides to switch it up.
“Cas, I don’t need a fucking buffet or whatever. I’m good with just grabbing a protein bar for the road. I can eat when I get back.”
“So beautiful Dean, you have no idea…”he said as finally came closer. Crawling over him and the bed until he was able to lower himself slowly, arms coming to frame either side of Dean’s head, his legs bracketing but not touching his hips. “The room is spinning, but you don’t seem to. Everything is gravitating around you. You’re completely solid, and here. And mmmm…” he took a whiff at Dean’s neck, but pulled away gently with a puzzled frown on his face.
“Dean,” Cas mumbles, barely opening his mouth, not even bothering to open his eyes.
“You mean - ?” he left off, gesturing with his free hand in the general direction of his chest. Making the manly(grabby) universal sign for boobs now just felt wrong.
Leaving the bedroom, he goes across to the last closed door in the apartment. Silently, he prays that he will be in there, safe and sound. But if he was safe and sound, shouldn’t he have heard when someone was knocking on his door, calling his name, and then coming in uninvited? Dear Lord, Dean could be dying or dead behind the door, and he’s stuck out here worrying about it!
Kind of a filler chapter, needed to set up the next! Sheesh, the next two should be a doozy!
Which is why he’s grateful when Cas starts to rub all over his body again, reawakening his senses before he carefully gathers Dean up and against his chest. He doesn’t feel the soreness that must be going on his arms after holding himself up for so long. He doesn’t feel any ache in his body from before. He just feels Cas, his skin against his own as he gently maneuvers them so they’re laying down again; Cas spooned up against his back, the space between their bodies non-existent.
“Team free will?” Cas asks, and Dean can hear the amusement in his voice.
He can’t see anything in front of him, so he grabs the railing with one hand and angles his body so that he can take the stairs- tilted to the side- one by one. His body is a little achey, a little stiff, so each stair presents a new challenge.
Cas tilts his head to the side for him, petting his hair all the while, and letting Dean take his time scenting.
He was paralyzed, hand stuck on his lower back, confused and irritated with himself for stopping. Or starting?
John’s eyes never waver from the death glare he’s aiming at Cas, so Dean clears his throat obnoxiously to get his attention. “Hey! Eyes on me asshole! You’re lucky we’re even letting you have a say in the first place.”
Turning this way and that, he can’t help but think that Cas had been right. He didn’t make a habit of looking at himself naked in front of the mirror, but after the last couple of days of struggling to get his jeans on, he’d finally given in. It was time to face reality. He must have been deluding himself before, because this shit just couldn’t happen in the time span he thought it had. Turning to look at his side profile, one hand holding the towel around his waist, and the other placed over his protruding stomach, he tries to suck it in to no avail.
The tests actually took 45 minutes. Just long enough for him to almost doze off and remember he was supposed to call his father today. They hardly communicated the way family’s should have, the way he did with Sam, but his dad had texted him yesterday to call him immediately. He’d pushed it out of mind until now, too caught up in his own problems to wonder about his dad’s. Whoops.
It can’t be more than an hour when he’s rudely awakened again.
Cas’s hips twitch in discomfort, probably due to how fucking hard he is, and the movement has Dean automatically clenching his cheeks together, squeezing Cas’s dick between them; unintentionally causing them both to moan breathily.
“Dean?” Bobby asks like he’s afraid to speak to him. “Dean, you gotta calm down, boy. Freak’in out won’t do that pup of yours any good, ya hear?”
Dean very maturely flips him off before shooting Sam a quick text, ignoring all the notifications of the numerous missed calls and texts that had accumulated over the last couple of days. He’s surprised his phone has enough battery to turn on, to be honest.
wanted to see Dean like that again.
It was still coming out of him, even with water continuing to wash it away, he could feel it drip down from his ass to mingle with the water streaming down his legs. Milky white, almost translucent, but clearly discernable from the water, and a whole different texture to boot, the substance was everywhere.
“This is
Cas kisses his forehead, then turns his head so that he can scent him back.
“Not really,” he lies. Cas shoots him a look like he sees right through him. “This is just the first time I’ve been able to really see it. Pup is usually blocking everything underneath her.”
heard of this guy before, and suddenly you have this random Alpha at your place, defending your honor or something? I thought you swore off being like
“Cas,” he whispers uncertainly against the man’s neck as he presses himself along Castiel’s side. He’s nervous, but determined. “There’s something I need to do.”
Cas mouths wetly at Dean’s mark again as he pets Cas’s hair. “What’s funny, Dean?” he says, barely concealed amusement in his voice.
than he could remember being in a long time. Too long, really. He’d been going through his life with dark clouds trailing his every footstep, looming over him, just waiting for him to make a mistake and have every single building block he’d made for himself come crumbling down at his feet. And the funny thing is, that they
“Shit!” the look on his face was freak’in priceless! “Excuse me, I was just uh…startled.”
He’s hit with a cold burst of wind when he opens the front door, but he doesn’t let that deter him as he walks out in his socks, crossing his arms and waiting for his brother to get out of the gay ass Rav4 he’d rented. He’s surprised when both driver and passenger doors open.
It’s quiet then, and Dean can tell the time for talking is over. All the words left unsaid will be saved for tomorrow. For now, Cas resumes stroking his hair, and Dean basks in the renewal of Cas’s natural(fucking awesome) scent. He ‘s watching the days happening in rewind in his head, seeing it all again like watching a movie. It’s not actually a calming thought, and it definitely won’t help lull him to sleep, but Dean can’t but laugh quietly, thinking about one thing in particular over and over again right before he’s about to fall asleep.
he corrects himself, the word sounding foreign in his mouth, “something for Christmas. It needs to be something special. Got any ideas?”
Now it takes him about three times longer than it would a normal, non-pregnant person to go down one flight of stairs.
Dean could feel the laugh vibrate against his skin, leaving pin pricks on sensation in it’s wake. “Where, Dean?”
She kicks inside him again, a little father up then before, and Dean can’t help but think she’s doing her best to listen to him.
“Don’t fight me on this, Dean,” Cas said, his face completely serious, voice sharp. “It’s honestly the least I can do.”
Tears sliding in a torrent of anguish down his face, Dean finally lets go. Crying so hard that he struggles to draw breath in, his whole body moves Castiel’s with the force of his sobs now.
Smiling gently, he nods over to the bench on the porch. “Sure, sweetheart. Let’s come over here though, so we can sit down okay?”
Even now, after he scrambled some eggs and sat down to eat, he could feel the nausea coming on. When Cas was near, or more specifically his scent, his body stopped fighting him so much. That had to mean something right?
“No?” Cas murmurs in amusement, “Is there something specific you want, Dean? You’re going to have to speak up. Tell me Dean. What do you want?”
“Never, Dean,” he assures him, voice trembling as he pulls Dean against his chest, Dean’s belly causing a tangible gap between them that he ignores in favor of holding Dean as close as possible. “I’ll never leave you. I promise.”
too good for me, man. I would taint him. He’s too good and one day he would realize how fucked he is if he settled with me- and he’d leave anyway. Just like anyone I’ve ever cared about has left me.”
Chuckling and tipping the weird little hat he liked to wear, Benny left him to his work.
“I could ask you the same fucking question, dude,” Dean says angrily, still facing away from Sam, checking for more blood hidden in Cas’s hair. “What are you even doing here? I thought I made it very clear that I did not want to talk to you.”
want to talk about his damn feelings, uh-uh, no way.
?!” she says with venom dripping from every word. “
“Presents, breakfast, anything but cuddling,” he ticks off with his fingers. He aims a reassuring smile up at Cas and then grabs his cup and stands. “Last one there- not counting me obviously- has to hand out the gifts.”
Cas leans down to gently kiss the top of his foot before lowering it back down and grabbing the things he brought with him before standing.
“What about what’s best for you, huh? What do you want? What’s going to make you happy, Castiel?”
right?”
“No, that’s not it,” she reassures him, pulling away again to wipe at her mascara. “When Sam told me, I just couldn’t picture it. I had to see you. And you- you look
is happening here, because I can feel you.”
He squeezes her hands for a second.
When push came to shove, literally, his mind had been made up on the spot; and there was no going back now. He didn’t regret that part, but now what? He’d spend most of the month thinking he would be ending this; thinking he would terminate the pregnancy, say good-bye to Cas, and go back to hiding what he was like none of this had ever happened. Now, he was coming to the realization that he had no plans. No fucking clue what to do next now that he’d decided to go through with this.
“I do?” he asks, curious, pondering over previous encounters. “Are you talking about in bed? Or in general?”
Cas, who seemed to be in a trance of his own, must read that on his face, and the weirdly intense look he was giving Dean turns into something a whole lot gentler. Grabbing Dean’s arm in a loose hold despite Dean feebly trying to shake him off, he guides Dean back to the bed, waiting till he’s fully reclined to speak again. He’s too tired to fight him.
Everything is exactly the way he left it before his tumble down the stairs, down to his half eaten piece of toast he’d abandoned next to the tv. Everything feels the same way too, including the crushing sense of loneliness and despair.
“-and Charlie or someone who can bring a wheelchair out? We’ll be there in about 45 minutes. Yes, okay. Thank you again.”
“Wait Dean, please don’t shut the door,” he begs, “I can help.”
When he turns back to Cas, he still looks confused, but no longer afraid. A little confusion slips away when Dean gently pushes the hem of Cas’s sweater up, a clear indication to take it off. A clear indication that he doesn’t plan on getting in alone.
This isn’t Castiel’s fight.
Now, more than ever, he's determined to hide how sore he is.
Cas growls low in his throat at the thought, but Dean pulls back enough to poke him firmly in the chest. “Hey. None of that Mr. Growly pants. You made your point tough guy, but I can handle myself, okay?”
“So you come here, throwing punches?!” Dean spits, turning to face Sam finally, and Sam gets his first real look at Dean. The man automatically follows close behind him, standing rigidly only a few inches from Dean’s back. “He didn’t do anything to you, man!”
They all stare at him cautiously, trying to decipher if he’s actually pissed or not, but when he chokes out, “This is like a
Dean Winchester than he was before.
Cautiously, he inches his knees to the left, keeping his ankle from making any kind of contact with the floor. The motion has him gagging and vomiting into the bin again, but at least his movements was enough to let Cas slip in through the crack. The solid wall of Cas’ heat has all his muscles relaxing and his fast breathing instantly slows.
“Fuck me! Another day and a half of this shit?” Dean groans. “Just when I thought this couldn’t get any worse.”
Smiling at Cas reassuringly and looking around the table at Sam and Jess who are still clutching each other and trying to breath through their laughs, Dean decides that maybe he could live with cutting down his swearing quota. With three of his favorite people surrounding him with their infectious happiness, anything sounded fucking possible.
tell me you couldn’t talk? I don’t understand!” Sam says in frustration, confusion level going even further through the roof as the man behind Dean takes a step forward to place his hands on Dean’s waist, and Dean
The whole this conversation is taking place, neither of them look away from Dean. It kind of felt like when you were being scolded my your parents- then again he wouldn’t really know what that’s like. John never cared enough to lecture him when he was younger.
Clenching his eyes closed and reluctantly leaning into Cas’s touch, he still doesn’t feel like he can do this. Even with Cas’s words churning up butterflies in his stomach.
- it was coming from, he wanted to take the smell and roll around in it for a few days, or make it into a candle or some shit. He’s never smelled anything this good before. His blockers must have worn off…
Following the illuminated winding walk way up to the house, he checks his phone again desperately before giving up and knocking. Is he supposed to knock? Is he supposed to just walk in? This whole- being on the opposite end of the door thing was weird as fuck.
His stomach decides to have a say though as it growls loud enough for both of them to hear. Groaning, Dean rolls to his feet and stumbles his way to the kitchen.
“Yeah,” she agrees, and then, “Would it be weird if I hugged you? It’s been a long time, Dean, and under the circumstances…”
“It’s not my fault this kid is sitting on my bladder! Blame the pup. I’ll be right back.”
“Later Benny,” he nods. This isn’t the time to discuss Benny’s little power display. They could hash things out later at work, when there wasn’t innocent ears present. (Yes Castiel counted as innocent) It was probably a good thing Cas hadn’t noticed.
“I know what you’re thinking,” Sam holds up his hand in a placating gesture. “But it was to let him know that in every way that matters, I no longer consider him to be my family.”
“You know it ain’t that simple! I gotta do right by you and that pup, son. If it means you hating me, then I can handle that,” Bobby growls at him, glaring. “Now sit down.”
“Shit,” Dean hisses, opening his eyes to stare up at Cas. “Cas I- I think I answered the phone the last time he called.”
“Fergus Crowley?” he asks closing his eyes.
“Wait for you to- Jesus Christ,” he splutters, getting to his feet. “You want me to wait for you to wipe my ass next time, too?”
He’s not sure what makes him do it- the thought of his pup, the sound of Cas’s pain, or maybe it’s something in him that just craves comfort- but either way, he doesn’t think as he unlocks the door with shaking hands and opens the door.
Dean smirks at him as they start walking. “You sure do know how to motivate me.”
Cas smiles against his skin and kisses his forehead before he lifts him up and waddles them towards the couch. But instead of lowering Dean to lay down again, Cas turns and sits, keeping Dean tucked up against him, sitting on his lap.
After all the frustration and disappointment he’d faced while trying to jerk himself off, he was fucking astonished by the fact that if Cas hadn’t been able to wake him up, he probably would have come just from what he’d been doing. Now that he was conscious, he was aware of just how much his body had been responding. He was hot all over, breath coming quick, and since he’d gone commando to sleep, his slick was soaking through Cas’s pajama pants.
Chuckling to himself, he puts his phone back before resuming his previous task of trying to inhale as much of that scent as possible before he falls asleep again. Soon, he won’t have it at all, as he’ll probably never see Cas again after this week, is his last thought before succumbing.
And notices something.
But this scent…the scent of heat…Overwhelmed would be quite the understatement. ”Dean,” he says again, but this time is sounds rougher, more guttural and deep.
“God, Cas,” Dean whispers, closing his eyes and leaning into Cas’s touch. “I understand that this needs to happen. I know that you deserve some answers…but I-I don’t think I can look you in the eye right now.”
“Oh.”
I’m gonna sleep.”
Cas presses his forehead to the peak of his belly. “Anything else?”
again, he fumbles to undo Cas’s belt.
"I never would've guessed... God, Dean..You look amazing," Sam whispers
The commotion around them makes it hard to hear, but as they get Sam and Jess’s luggage and things together and gather close to exchange goodbyes, he distinctly hears his brother whisper, “Whatever you’re thinking of doing, don’t do it,” in his ear right before he pulls away from their hug.
Benny at least has the decency to look embarrassed, looking down at the ground as his neck flushes red, and that’s it. He can’t help it. Shaking his head and scrunching his nose, he starts laughing, the ridiculousness finally getting to him.
The days that he’s stuck at home seem to drag on- unnaturally long.
“Dean… Being an Omega is nothing to be ashamed about,” he says cautiously. He starting to understand that this fact is not something Dean accepts, but he still doesn’t understand why.
“Dean, what if-”
You can thank my shitty day for such a quick update. Warning for angst and smut.
Trudging up the three flights of stairs and taking a deep breath, Castiel summoned his courage and knocked on the door. He’d feel better when he could see him and smell him again. Probably his latent alpha tendencies rearing it’s protective and obtrusive head.
Cas snorts against the skin of his inner thigh but grabs the lube and drizzles his fingers, so he counts that joke as a win. Even more so when Cas circles his hole twice before sinking his index finger in to the first knuckle.
That was something John Winchester has
Dean tries to fight his grin at first, but he breaks when Cas fucking kisses his ear. Wrapping his arms around Cas’s neck, he lets the crazy Alpha kiss wherever he wants to, only letting go when Cas starts to kiss down his body-knowing where Cas will inevitably end up.
“Oh fuck,” he moans, rhythm faltering slightly. “Okay, that took a weird turn. Uh- oh. Yeah. Let’s explore that later.”
“M’okay. Miss you,” Dean mumbles, fighting against his pride and his burning cheeks to get the words out.
Tears spring to his eyes all of a sudden, and he’s grateful he can turn his face into Cas to muffle a frustrated sob he’s completely unprepared for. Nobody fucking told him that being pregnant would make him unstable.
“I- I- I can’t,” Dean chokes, voice breaking as he tries to speak. “Why? Why does it feel like this?”
He’s the one screaming.
“Did you really think I wouldn’t notice how scared you were when I told you I love you?” Cas whispers.
“Shhh…. You don’t need to say anything,” Cas speaks softly. “I have no expectations of you, Dean. There is no pressure. Nothing needs to change if you don’t want it to.”
“Dean?” Cas asks again as soon as Dean gets the door unlocked.
she is beautiful,” he whispers, completely in awe. He can see her little head and her little body curled up nice and cozy inside him, and it’s the most incredible thing he’s ever seen.
“Just a quick one then?” He can’t believe he’s practically begging for a quickie from his mate who’s worrying about him and the pup getting caught up on their rest. How is this his life now?
Slamming the door behind him after he struggles to get the door open, he makes sure to lock his door before he starts stripping. His breath is coming fast again as he rips off the soiled jump suit and comes in contact with wet material. It sticks to his skin as he peals it off.
But Cas ignores him as he gently cradles Dean’s head, running his fingers through his hair starting from the top of Dean’s head, and going to the back; muttering under his breath, “tell me if anything hurts.”
she laughs breathlessly, “Why didn’t you ever tell me?”
“Why do you call me that?”
“Hey you,” he mumbles, conscious of the way Cas is watching him. “Sorry about the last few days buddy- I gotta admit, I kinda missed your kicks.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says, sounding grateful, “That would be a big relief. Are you sure you wouldn’t mind?”
Dean bites back his laugh as Cas’s entire face lights up with excitement, leaning closer and murmuring apologies, and, “Of course we’d never name you Big Bird.”
“Be right back,” Cas offers. With a tinge of guilt in his scent?
He can’t go to a bar or drink his sorrows away, he can’t go to work to let out a little steam, and with the way he’s looking, he’d never be able to find a hook up. He doesn’t
He’s never said those words out loud, never even really thought them, so he was a little fucking confused as to where that had come from. The heat must’ve gotten to his head or some shit, because that was not even remotely okay.
“Well then come here then, you big goof,” Dean waves him over, smiling a bit as Sam’s face lights up with child-like excitement.
He sits for another couple of hours, picking up the phone and bringing up Cas’s contact only for him to throw his phone away from him at the last second. He can do this, he thinks blearily, eyes drooping repeatedly as he feels another wave about to hit. He can-
“Cas…” he starts brokenly, because he was hoping to avoid having to tell Castiel the decision he had come to. Especially right now, as he can feel his hormones playing with his emotions again, making him feel like he was about to cry.
Cas said his life was close to perfect. Cas wouldn’t lie to him. He would know.
“If you want…” Dean says and then hesitates. “It might be easier on you if I drop you off at the airport. You could crash at my place tomorrow night and then I can drop you off. So…you wouldn’t have to worry about parking and all that shit.”
It was like an itch he couldn’t scratch, and holy hell- did it itch. All the fucking time now.
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas worries, rushing to his feet and jogging to get paper towels from the kitchen.
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas says gently, “If you would have told me sooner, I could have explained before it got to this point. Do you remember when I was explaining to you the ways in which male and female Omegas differed with regards to their pregnancies?”
“I can identify you as an omega by you’re scent. It smells slightly distorted, but your gender designation is clear as of now.”
For some reason, Dean doesn’t believe that.
When he finally comes, moan not quite muffled by Cas’s skin, he sinks into Cas loose and boneless, barely aware when Cas’s knot catches and starts to release inside him sometime later, accompanied by Cas’s soft groan next to his ear. His grip on Cas tightens. Even if he could move, he wouldn’t.
“Go to sleep, Dean.”
“Fucking
sorry. I can’t even begin to say…”
He can feel how hard Cas is, can feel the slick pretty much dripping down Cas’s hand, can scent Cas’s arousal as he pleasures Dean, but all Cas says is, “There we go, Dean. It’s alright,” as Dean pauses, panting and frozen, torn between Cas’s pleasure and his own, “This is about you, beautiful, you can move.”
Pam ends up shooing them along after another half an hour of them fawning over the pup. She insists that she has other patients coming in soon, and hurriedly hands them over a brand spanking new image of their little girl when both Cas and Dean drag their feet while leaving.
Yes, they’re having a moment with Dean’s father pinned beneath Cas, spewing obscenities at them, but Dean has learned to take what he can out of life, and this is one of those times.
He’s about to say something when he notices the tears on Jess’s cheeks.
But seeing Sam’s face, his first thought is; I
He drags a chair over close to Dean’s head and sits, reaching over to stroke the side of Dean’s face with sadness in his eyes. Dean can feel his breathing hitch again, but this time he holds it back.
“Why does that concern you Dean?” Cas asks seriously, suddenly no traces of their previous laughter or smiles. “Are you ashamed over the fact that you are carrying a life inside you?”
ultimately change to accommodate for the baby.”
. Latest? Around April 9
“Are you alright? Did you have a nightmare?” Cas asks.
When he is where Cas wants him, he has Dean turn around, pulling his legs to his chest facing away from him. He closes his eyes before Cas can tell him to, catching Cas’s scent and trying to hold on to it as he tenses, waiting for the other man’s touch.
Cas’s eyes roll. “Hardly,” Cas scoffs but then quiets. “I just…want it to be special. Or at least be an adequate reflection of the way our lives are right now.”
“I did say that time was of the essence,” he shrugs. “Alright, give me your hands. Ah ah ah- watch the ankle, Dean. I said hands, not try to get to your knees,” he tsks, exasperated.
Not only could he not take anything for his head ache-figuring drugs counted as putting them
Faces so close together, noses almost brushing, sharing the same air. It only seems natural that Dean lean in and press his lips against Cas’s.
Gagging and covering his mouth with the hand that wasn’t covered in

Wrenching the door open and shuffling to the toilet, he makes it to the toilet just in time to prevent his bladder from exploding. God, he thinks, sighing in relief as a steady stream continues to flows, how the hell did woman
. Who would’ve guessed.”
“Shit.”
“Oh and Cas will be there,” he pats the hands holding his hips and turns to look over his shoulder, smirking when he catches Cas glaring at Sam. “If you got a problem with him, then don’t bother coming.”
I should probably apologize in advance. I am sorry for this chapter. Nothing too bad. Just a lot of feels.
He can’t enough of Cas lately. He’s finding any and all excuses to touch him, to scent him, and he refuses to apologize for it. It puts something inside him at ease, makes him fucking
Bracing one hand under him and the other on the top of the seat, he holds his breath and tries to lift himself up. Tensing up, he immediately goes back down. His whole right side is excruciating – so painful he throws his head back, panting, trying to breathe through it.
Pushing Cas’s hands away when he’s clean enough, he pulls his shirt down again. “Our luck, man. Seriously,” but he looks down fondly at his belly, “I don’t think you’re shy at all, little pudge. Nope, I think you couldn’t resist messing with your daddies, huh?” he croons.
“Yes!”
After he’d dropped off Cas, he remembered stripping on the way to his bed, feeling so hot and itchy, the thought of clothes smothering him had been unacceptable. In nothing but his boxers, how was it he was still so fucking hot?
“I believe you,” Dean responds, but he steps back. “Speaking of second chances though, lets start with him. Cas, this is my brother Sam. Sam this is my- uh this is Cas.”
Twisting his fingers as he thrusts them in and out, Cas sets a hard pace Dean was not expecting
starts to sink down on Cas’s cock. It’s fucking weird to have that kind of pressure between his cheeks again, but it’s a good kind of weird. There’s really no resistance, no stretch as he takes Cas inside him.
I think angst might be my thing.
“Okay, Dean. Whatever you say,” Cas smirks.
Cas rearranges them so that they are on their sides before he’s nuzzling into Dean’s neck, scenting him, and wrapping around him like an octopus.
Apparently, all he needed was permission.
And it’s the way he said it, the way he’s talking like he’s speaking to someone hard of hearing, that stops Dean’s panic in it’s tracks. Everything goes blank for a second, as he stares incredulously at Cas. His face, so concerned and worried, so fucking
“Shit man, I’m sorry.”
me,” Dean groans shakily, bottom lip trembling with the effort.
“No. I don’t get sick. Like ever.”
“Okay, Dean, alright,” Cas soothes, and his voice has Dean’s muscles relaxing incrementally. “Pregnancy heats are perfectly natural, alright? You’re going to be fine.”
Slanting his mouth as soon as Cas gets the picture and starts kissing him back, Dean mirrors Cas’s hands-which have moved back to cradle his face- and uses his grip to pull him in closer, so that Cas has to hover over him, deepening the kiss to feel as much of Cas’s heat as possible.
, and has the guy shifting his weight at that exact moment and leaning back into Dean.

Annnnnnd, his dick came back to life again.
dude.”
Immediately, a single finger pushes inside him slowly, and Dean clenches his eyes shut at the ache. Gritting his teeth as his legs spread automatically. It’s not painful exactly, but it’s not the quick zing of pleasure it would normally be. It kind of felt like a deep tissue massage when you were really sore, pressing in to the places he ached and making them feel better. Sighing as Cas adds another finger, he moves his hips minutely back and forth, helping the process along when Cas starts to scissor him open.
Squinting his eyes and trying to pinpoint what was bothering him, nothing comes to mind except a weird smell and the fact that he needs to take a piss.
“Of course it didn’t,” Cas rolls his eyes like that was the exact answer he was expecting. “What about your back? Your neck? Don’t downplay anything else, Dean.”
“Yep, you heard it right. It’s official, fellas,” she says like both of them aren’t hanging on her every word. “You have a little lady on the way.”
He gestures with his hand to Dean.
“Bobby, I’m sorry about that, I just - ”
All laughter leaves him in an instant. “I can understand that. My scent consumed yours within a couple of hours. I hated it, and I wasn’t even in heat.”
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” Cas breathes against his lips.
“Yeah,” he whispers back, squeezing Cas’s hand in reassurance. For Cas or for him though, he isn’t sure.
“Dude- they’re
“You are insufferable, Dean Winchester,” Cas says seriously. But it’s negated by the smile on his face as he says it.
“You’re stressing yourself out, Dean. You need to calm down,” he says quietly as he wraps his arm completely around Dean’s waist now.
The old Dean Winchester was gone.
“Shit. My bad, ya’ll are entertaining. Here,” he hands Dean two small squares.
“What?”
Huffing as he slumps back into the couch, Dean takes a deep breath through his nose before letting it go. “With him, I just need time. I’ll get over it eventually…Besides Sam, what is there to know about?”
“Why don’t you grab a few different kinds? Try them on, see what you like?” Cas suggests hopefully, rubbing a hand up and down Dean’s lower back.
“Didn’t you hear me? Less than 20. Of course I’ll ‘be amenable’ to it…But uh- what is it?”
“Good night, Dean,” Cas says softly.
“Where might I find condoms and lube, Dean? I do not intend on hurting you your first time, and I don’t want to knot you our first time.”
It’s minutes later that he’s ready to move, his arms about ready to give out from underneath him. Turning slightly and tucking his arms underneath Dean, he rolls them so that Dean is partially on top of him now, knot still keeping them connected, Castiel on his back and Dean’s head cushioned on his sweaty chest.
even if it was not letting Dean be alone, Castiel follows Dean’s lead. Climbing into bed and pulling the covers up. He desperately wants to break the heavy silence, if only to hear that beautiful voice, but he can’t. Dean is turned away from him which means Dean isn’t ready to let him in.
“Newsflash buddy,
“This isn’t your fault, Dean,” he says heatedly, “None of this is, and you do not deserve this kind of treatment from your family. Right now, you need support, people you can rely on and trust. Not people who are too ignorant to see a good thing when it’s right in front of them!”
Struggling to get ahold of himself, Dean tries to take a deep breath, and inhales something that makes his entire body go lax. It’s Cas’s scent. His
. With his ass being the mess it was and his hormones being all over the place, he had to start taking showers before he went to sleep, and right when he woke up or else the scent of slick and arousal would follow him around every where he fucking went. And sometimes, that wasn’t even enough.
Dean chuckles, a weak, disgusting sound at the nickname, and Cas clutches him closer. Dean sighs deeply, still unwilling to open his eyes at the sound of two retreating footsteps.
All the blood drains from Dean’s face as he finally puts it all together before all of it makes a quick return, rushing to his cheeks, his ears, his neck. His whole body is flushed, feeling more naked then he was a few minutes ago in just a towel.
“Well that explains a lot,” Cas chuckles a tiny, then he sobers up quickly. “I do want to impress upon you the dangers of isolating yourself with the pup on the way. However I don’t think now is the appropriate time. But I do want to make one thing very clear, hopefully making that particular conversation moot…”
He lets them fall. He lets them cleanse him of the last few weeks; of all the pain he’d put himself through, all his mistakes. All of it is washed away.
Slowly, he untangles himself from Cas’s embrace. He lets Cas wrap one arm around his back for support and then takes his other hand so he can lead the way. With Dean’s limp, it’s slow progress, walking past all the rooms and all of the things still left out from Christmas. He wants to stop and look around, refamiliarize himself with everything he’s missed, but he’s confident that there will be time for that another day. He’s also confident in the knowledge that this is the right choice.
And he's not enough.
“I swear to god that was the only time I actually wanted a dog,” Dean shakes his head, remembering a time where everything was so much fucking easier. “But anyway, if this kid is anything like me, I won’t be the only one who is pro pizza over green shit.”
Holding his lips there as Dean meets his eyes for the first time since the whole fiasco went down, Cas smiles into Dean’s hand before pulling away.
I’m thanking you, I guess,” Dean murmurs. “I was pretty much fucking asking for it. God – I’m a fucking mess,” he groans, lifting his head to look down at himself for the first time. “Jesus - ” he hisses, reaching back to pull a sheet over himself as shame starts to creep up his neck at the sight he makes.
need to throw up. Right now.
Sam and Jess look at each other and then at Cas who shrugs.
“Jesus
Cas takes a deep breath but he doesn’t move.
Plus, there wasn’t a chance in hell he’d be on the… receiving end. His butt was an exit only. He would never relinquish power to someone else. Never let anyone demean him in that way. He wasn’t weak. He wasn't
When they get back, his time will be up.
Cas brings his hand up slowly to cup Dean’s cheek, and Dean thinks for a second Cas is going to kiss him but then he whispers, “Thank you for letting me take you today, Dean.”
him. He was scared shitless. So far, he’d drank a shitload of alcohol at the beginning, been on scent blockers the entire time, and been punched in the face. And he was only three months in.
“Which was when, again?” Dean wonders aloud, trying to think back to when he’d gotten off of work.
“You’re not alone. Not anymore,” Cas murmurs. “I’m here now, and I’ll hold you as long as you need me to.”
By now he knows his way to the toilet by heart, so he hadn’t tried to switch on the light, but he regrets it now as he hears Cas calling out for him probably from his empty bedroom, worry giving his tone an edge.
to sleep. For a couple hours at least, but these new feelings have his chest feeling tight.
On the way back to Castiel’s house, he’s close to falling asleep again. With a full stomach and the past few hours replaying in his head, he closes his eyes and leans his head against the cool glass of the car window. He’s dimly aware of the freaki’in classical music Cas has playing softly in the background, but he’s too tired to protest or question it. He won’t let himself actually drift off though since he’ll be driving himself home very soon.
