Dean was grinning at him sheepishly. Bobby just sat down on a chair in the kitchen and nodded at them, a friendly smile on his mouth. He crossed his arms in front of his chest in eager anticipation, and Dean and Castiel just continued playing piece after piece after piece. While the storm was raging outside, they were battling against it with their music, defying the chaos with their cheerful, unstoppable sounds. Castiel had no difficulties finding the right key and chords to the songs Dean played – Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had had so much fun making music with another person. Castiel had a great understanding of music and notes and rhythm, knowing exactly where and how to accompany Dean, when to play more detailed and friskily and when to let Dean’s guitar and voice take over.
At some point, he realized he couldn’t stay in bed forever, and that he had to take care of a lot of different things – and the longer he waited, the worse it got. So, he got up with a groan and looked around the apartment, which he had deserted for weeks. The place wasn’t messy, for he liked some basic orderliness and didn’t own a lot of things, but the air was stale, and dust was everywhere. Dean opened several windows and let the spicy fresh summer air enter the apartment, bringing new oxygen inside. He made himself some coffee and checked the content of his kitchen cabinets, knowing only too well that he had to do some damn grocery shopping. Then his eyes fell to the bags he had left on the floor and he groaned annoyed, sighing exasperatedly. Damn household chores. He also had to do some laundry.
„Sure, buddy. Where to?”
But now he looked at Castiel, who was standing in front of him, considering him with a little smile playing on his mouth. Dean held on to the door behind him, leaned back against it, overwhelmed with the intensity of arousal coursing through his system; he felt weak at the knees, his stomach was on pins and needles. It had something to do with the way Castiel was looking at him, piercingly, knowingly, and when he took one step closer towards Dean, and then another, and another… Suddenly, Castiel was right in Dean’s personal space, both his hands placed next to Dean’s head against the door. Dean watched Castiel’s eyes scanning his face, taking in Dean’s features with pleasure. A subtle smile was flitting across his sensual mouth when a breathy moan escaped Dean unwillingly. It was the final straw. Castiel leaned in slowly, carefully, and Dean watched him close his lids as if in slow-motion, coming nearer and nearer… On their own, Dean’s lids fell shut, his whole body vibrating in joyful anticipation.
"It's not that I don't want it, Dean... It's just... not here, not like this. You deserve better... and I won't continue to be the man who pays you for this... You don't have to do anything, okay? I just... I just wanna talk to you. That's enough for tonight. It's really priceless and already more than I should ask for."
"Your life sounds like an adventure. I wish mine was only half as exciting," he said quietly, making Dean's insides cringe with guilt and sympathy. He had never meant to make Castiel feel like his life wasn't interesting enough just because he had stayed in one town in his existence. Dean sighed too and took Castiel's hand in his, away from his upper thigh. Within the last days they had started touching their hands more freely, less restrained, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Dean still tried to persuade himself there wasn't more behind it, no hidden agenda, no motives of the heart. His fingers embraced Castiel's and he squeezed them lightly; Castiel lifted his head, meeting Dean's eyes with a vulnerable, wild look. He appeared like a deer in the headlights to Dean: beautiful, petrified, uncertain. He longed to reach out his hand and cup Castiel's fine cheek, to feel the scarce stubble underneath his fingertips and tell him everything was alright with him, that there was nothing wrong with him or the way he led his life.
"It... protects me from evil spirits", he said pensively, loving to see Castiel smile a brittle, melancholic smile.
"What am I supposed to do, Gabe? He told me he never wanted to see me again! You weren't there, you didn't see the disappointment in his eyes, you didn't hear how he yelled at me... He won't call, he won't get in touch with me. I think that's giving me a broad hint about what he really wants, doesn't it?"
They remained silent for a while, just enjoying each other’s company, as the sun ahead of them was sinking. The ever-blue sky was sprinkled with glowing stars already. A beautiful sundown plunged the firmament into vivid colors, orange, pink, and blue mixing. To both sides, Dean saw pastures and small groves they passed by, leaves, stalks, and branches swaying in the mild evening breeze. Infinite peace grew within him as he regarded the placid world in the evening hours. He had no idea where Cas was taking him to, but he didn’t mind. Just spending some time with him and letting Cas take care of him was enough to make him happy.
Sam and Jess were finally moving to Sioux Falls, and Dean had marked the moving date in his calendar. Again and again, he had offered his help, but Sam had insisted that Dean sit this one out and let Bobby and their friends handle it. However, Sammy had promised to call in the evening and let Dean know if they were okay and if they needed anything. When they called, Sam sounded happy but exhausted. He told Dean about all the things he had to take care of now and was wracking his brain. Jess was in the 34
“Jeez, Charlie. Do you wanna burn your mouth? That mixture is like an atomic bomb!”
His heart leapt into his throat, his whole body tingled, as Castiel bent down and kissed him feverishly, pressing his head into the yielding mattress. His hands clung to Castiel's shoulders, his head was spinning madly, his stomach turned over, as he responded to his kisses. Their sensitive lips brushed over one another, he could feel Castiel's trembling breaths on his cheeks. Before he knew it, Dean fisted his hair harshly and pulled him closer, and they got lost in devoted kisses, untamed wildness tugged at them as their tongues wrestled sensually slowly with each other. Their hands begun to roam all over their bodies, enjoying the sensation of flexing muscles and warm flesh. When they finally parted, Castiel sat up on Dean's lap. Dean saw his eyes were hooded with lust, containing a blazing wildfire of desire as they beheld Dean pensively. He panted swiftly, his chest was heaving; Dean had tousled his hair unknowingly, it made him think how fierce Castiel appeared, it suited him. Hot tidal waves of arousal splashed over Dean, every inch of his body burnt with a brutish force, commanding him to bruise those soft, plump lips further, to get more of this addictive man.
It was unnerving how Castiel's prying eyes were always transfixing Dean's during the training sessions, watching him attentively. It corded up Dean's throat, produced a knot of affection and emotional turbulences in Dean's stomach. He found he didn't have the strength to mind Sam's premonitions, he often returned Castiel's glassy stare with a fond smile. His whole spine tingled when he saw Castiel giving him a tender smile then; it diminished the ghosts of worries haunting Dean all the time. Castiel's luminous eyes, the twirl of his rosy, full lips – those images were clearly etched into Dean's mind, and when he lay awake in bed at night, they came to him in the darkness. He was basking in the bright light Castiel somehow emanated, and though Dean knew of his painful past now, he thought he still saw the persistent beauty of him, shining wondrously behind his carnal shell, invincible. With each passing day it became more and more impossible to hold the affection for him back.
Cas nodded in agreement; then he took one of Dean’s hands and raised it to his lips, leaving a coy, lingering kiss on the back of Dean’s hand. Dean felt frozen, stupidly affected by this sweet little gesture. His and Castiel’s eyes locked. Thunderbolts of affection and unfiltered bliss shot through Dean’s insides, made him smile a twitchy smile. Dean averted his eyes. He harrumphed, somewhat embarrassed about himself. He just couldn’t stand Castiel’s piercing, knowing look for too long, it always felt as if Castiel could see right through him. With a nameless joy, he regarded his and Castiel’s hand combined, holding one another.
With a strength unknown to him, he pushed with his hands hard against Aaron’s chest, caused the other man to get up clumsily, his balance lost. Like lightning, Castiel stood up, his hands formed to fists, ready to defend himself. He wanted to see Dean again. It wasn’t going to end like that. Aaron sneered at him, raised his fists, a challenging grin rested on his face – one that Castiel longed to beat away. What made him pause, though, was the thing on the wall behind Aaron, it aroused his interest: A fire extinguisher. A suicidal plan formed in his jumbled brain. He ran past Aaron, grabbed the fire extinguisher from the wall, felt its heavy weight in his hands. Aaron was behind before he could even count to three. Angrily, he touched Cas’ shoulder, forced him to turn around to him. Castiel used the momentum of the movement, used the strength of his arms and hips, and rammed the fire extinguisher against Aaron’s head mercilessly.
“Yeah, of course,” his dark voice responded quietly. “I know a lot of recipes by heart. I usually cook and bake all the time. It’s a guilty pleasure.”
"I can't take that risk, Cas. I would never forgive myself if something happened to you. And because you mean a lot to me -" Cas scoffed incredulously as if he wasn't believing one word Dean was saying, interrupting Dean like this – and Dean grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him lightly, seeking for his eyes affirmatively. Each hunch of sarcasm and scorn had vanished from Castiel's face, and now he was crying openly as he drowned in Dean's eyes with an expression of tortured misery beautifying his face like a deadly veil.
"Keep playing. I like it a lot..." Castiel admitted quietly, sounding a little defeated because Dean had been right, even though he had behaved so smug. Absentmindedly, he let his fingers execute whatever they wanted, and before he knew what was happening, he had fallen into a love ballade he knew by heart. It wasn't far-fetched to start such a song while he beheld Castiel, absolutely hypnotized by the other, who didn't look at him but smiled all the time as if Dean addressed the best compliments to him. A dark blush cloaked Castiel's cheeks and Dean watched the knife in his hand trembling oddly, the carving process became slower. Dean liked the melancholic atmosphere of the song, and though it was a little gloomy, it seemed hopeful to him, especially when he directed it at his lover unwittingly.
„I know you’re not Aaron, Dean, but Aaron hurt me badly. And I can’t just forget that or move on as if it didn’t happen… I wanna be together with you, Dean. I really do… Look at you,” Castiel said with a lopsided smirk, a fire of unbearable heat glinting in his eyes while he studied Dean. „You’re just stunning, admirable. From the way you look to the way you took care of me, what big heart you have… there’s so much I love about you,” Castiel said, and it made Dean laugh embarrassedly, despite his tears. What a start in the day, to start the day with tears and heartfelt conversations… Castiel quickly pecked his lips, humming appreciatively, but when he regarded Dean again, the bright light in his eyes had vanished, and now he looked at Dean sinisterly.
He told himself it didn't matter where they were going to hang out, but inwardly he was shivering and screaming with anticipation of facing the possibility to see the mysterious man again. He didn't want to exaggerate when he searched in his wardrobe for clothes, but he felt the urge to look handsome tonight. After a moment of hesitation he donned a tight black shirt, some worn out loose jeans and a blue, plaid button-down shirt. Fair enough, he thought, when he eyed himself in the mirror. As he captured his own gaze he became suddenly aware that he was thinking about the stuff he was wearing and the way other people would see him. He frowned and tried to remember when that had happened for the last time.
"Seriously, dude. Cheer up! It's just your second day in here. You will go nuts if you spend too much time on your thoughts. Told you, you've got to find some distraction. Why don't you join me and go to the art class or do crochet like Ash?", Garth suggested, putting an amused smile on Dean's face as Ash confirmed "I can crochet like a god", and he scoffed when Ash wiggled his eyebrows meaningfully.
They smiled at each other, and Castiel took Dean's hand in his and led him to the bathroom. He heard Dean whistle in awe when Castiel opened the door and the candlelight danced towards them, the smell of soap wafting through the air. Dean's thumb stroked over Castiel's back of the hand in small circles, and Castiel moved to kiss his cheek lovingly.
“Bobby, I just wanna say thank you for all you’ve done for me,” he started, but Bobby cut him off.
Castiel smiled cryptically at Dean as he took off his wings, then his tunic followed. Dean watched, hypnotized, delighted beyond comprehension, as Castiel confidently undressed, as he doffed all pieces of clothing. Suddenly, he was standing naked in front of Dean.
"Guess it's just my nerves. I have a fitful sleep, I can never sleep through the night. 4 hours straight, tops."
“Peace be with you,” he said. Then he exhaled for one last time and died.
“No, it’s a peace offer. Once and for all, let’s put an end to all this madness. The Capulets have agreed on this, especially after the loss of Zachariah. I give you my word.”
He bit down on his bottom lip, uncertain how to proceed. Should he continue searching for his lover? Soon the sun would go down and the darkness would make it harder to find him... Also, if demons were around, he might put himself in danger as well. As selfish as that sounded, it would come to no good if both Castiel and he were hurt or trapped somewhere – who would come to their aid then? Surely Sammy might, but that might be too late as well... The rehab-center was the only safe place for him at the moment. Full of thoughts, he returned to his room, not knowing what to do.
"Sam – I promise: I won't let anything happen to you. And those weirdo powers you have, I think you can also turn them around and use them for our advantage, we just have to get the hang of it. Is your conscience at rest now or do you need to hear more of my convictions?" he declared, a cheeky smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. Sam smiled honestly, almost affectionately, and the boyish grin approaching his visage took a load off Dean's mind.
TO BE CONTINUED
“Cas… Do you wanna be alone, or do you wanna talk about it? I heard you cry, and I thought I should check in on you. I know it ain’t my place, but if you wanna talk, just now that I’m here," Dean said friendly, his words were quiet due to the late hour. He wasn’t sure, but he thought he recognized the smallest of smiles coming to life on Castiel’s lips as he beheld Dean in the dark. Then the younger man sat up in bed, his back leaned against the big pillow.
Dean took a deep breath, tried to calm his frayed nerves.
“You’re right, I could sleep a little bit more… but Cas? I don’t wanna hang up yet. It’s just so good to hear your voice, to hear you breathing… I missed that. Would you mind staying on the phone until I fall asleep?”
Castiel hadn’t gone to work ever since he had stepped over Bobby’s doorstep last Monday. His face hadn’t healed completely yet, but he almost looked quite normal again, so Dean assumed that Castiel was probably going to return to his workplace this week. He wondered if Castiel could endure being back in his normal work environment, if people might talk shit about him and the obvious traces of a fierce physical abuse. Just the way it was right now, even without performing his job as a judge, Dean could tell that Cas wasn’t coping too well. After visiting the church yesterday and talking so openly with him about faith and losses, Castiel had secluded himself in his room for the better part of the day… Dean had gone to bed pretty late, and when he had returned from the bathroom and walked along the corridor, he had seen a ray of light still shining through the door to Castiel’s room. Apparently, Castiel had trouble falling asleep. At breakfast this morning, Castiel had looked crumpled and weary – he hadn’t talked a lot, and his appetite had been poor.
Dean frowned, deeply touched by Cas’ concern for him.
Castiel smiled, pecked his lips once more, hummed against them with appreciation.
Shaking his head as if this could make these thoughts disappear, he got out of the parked Impala and wrote Castiel a message to let him know he was here. A few moments later, a haggard-looking Castiel walked out of the coffee shop. He was awfully pale, seemed jittery and confused. Their eyes met, and Dean’s heart melted right there on the spot. Castiel looked as if he had been through hell. Automatically, Dean opened his arms widely, and approached Cas, wrapped him up in a bone-breaking hug. Their torsos collided intimately; their body warmth mingled. Castiel buried his face in the soft cotton of Dean’s uniform, slung his arms around his middle and held him tighter. Dean could feel him vibrate in his arms, how he was trembling from head to toe. Cas clung to him as if the world was ending, as if he was about to collapse any second now, his fingernails delving into Dean’s back desperately. A hurricane of emotions overwhelmed Dean as he held his partner, stroked his back soothingly – he was angry at Aaron for all of this, whether he was here or not. He was to blame for this mess Castiel was. Apart from that, Dean was simply worried about Cas, wondered if he was going to be alright.
"You really ate intelligence with a spoon, right?"
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel moaned, thrust his hips into the air again. His dick pressed against the back of Dean’s throat, and both men moaned darkly. It had been a while since Dean had done this with another man, but when he started moving his mouth up and down leisurely, sucking Cas’ dick tightly, he heard Castiel moan again and again – and it sounded so wrecked and lustful… it astounded Dean how hot it was, how just the sounds of Cas could arouse him so much. Cas’ dick lay heavy and big in his mouth, twitched whenever Dean deep-throated him or let his tongue massage the underside of it.
The walls were decorated with fluffy sanguine velvet, the round tables were black and the brothel was altogether dimly lit. He and Gabriel sat at the counter, because Castiel had told him he wanted to take things slowly. There was no way he would allow Gabe talking him into sleeping with a prostitute – not tonight or
When Castiel opened his apartment door, Dean was completely taken aback – beads of sweat were on Castiel's forehead and temples, his dark hair was damp and he appearead a little out of breath. He wore black linen pants and a light blue tunic, the texture was soaked through with perspiration. Dean frowned and greeted Castiel with a baffled, breathless "Hi, Cas". Their eyes met and Castiel smiled gently at him and opened the door further to let Dean inside. Dean felt too uncertain about their relationship to lean forward and demand a kiss, but Castiel didn't seem to mind or notice.
He left a sleeping Castiel early this Friday morning as the dew still lingered on the lawns he strolled by. He took his time to consider the scenery of this small town for one last time, watching how a pastel orange sun ascended on an overclouded sky. The light tinted the grey clouds in a magnificent way so that the whole firmament was glowing in the early hour. For a second, it seemed to Dean time stood still. No sound was audible, not even birds or the booming rush-hour traffic cut through the silence. The world held its breath, its attention solely focused on Dean, and the transformation he had gone through.
It didn't help, though, to lie awake in bed on his back as the bluish twilight spread in his small room – he noted his arms lacked a certain kind of weight. He yearned for Castiel's body; it was like he had become the extension of Dean's physical form. It felt like an arm or leg was missing, and now Dean was crippled due to this part of him he couldn't retrieve. He was starving for the clever tilt of Castiel's hips as they moved together, their pelvises grinding hotly, intimately. With closed eyes, the world spun maddeningly, and Dean felt the vigor of the liquor traveling through his veins. As drunk as he was, it was easy to give in to the heavenly delirium. He thought he could feel Castiel's plump lips pressing against his, how his lover took care of him perfectly as fingers enveloped his swelling cock gently. It might have been his hand stroking him to his climax and there may have been tears in the corners of his eyes, but the satisfied smile on his mouth was honest – and the images of Castiel playing behind his retina were vivid and beautiful, and the hoarse moan resounding in the room was permeated with lust and love. For a momentary second, Dean was blissfully happy.
more kiss. Then you’ll stop bothering me!”
When their bodies came down, Dean heard their unsteady breaths, how they both panted quickly. Subconsciously he had hidden his face in the crook of Castiel's neck, the area was already moist and hot due to his exhales. Castiel's arms were around him, his palms stroking his back absentmindedly; there were a thousand brief kisses pressed against his sweaty temple, damp breaths entered his ear and caressed his jawline incessantly. Unwilling to let go and to end this precious moment, Dean collapsed on his lover completely, staying inside of him just for a while longer, and Castiel let him remain there wordlessly.
Castiel grinned and tried to act unimpressed at Dean's aggressive advances, instead he smacked his ass offensively and said "Let's get back to bed then, and we'll see what I can do for you". In an instant one of Dean's hand got a hold of Castiel's and he led him back to his bedroom, his hips swinging subtly from side to side, and Castiel didn't even try to resist checking out Dean's smashing backside. Once they were inside the dark room, Castiel asked if Dean didn't have candles or something likewise, and he insisted on Dean lighting those few he had in the drawer of his nightstand, chuckling quietly when Dean complained about Castiel being an incurable romantic, but complying to his wish nonetheless. The tiny flames illuminated the room, and Castiel was glad he could see the light dance in Dean's eyes and how it touched his almost naked body, underlining every muscle, every bone, every tiny wisp of hair. They smiled at each other when they climbed into bed, and Castiel knelt at the end of the bed, feeling too aware and awkward about himself when he took in Dean's sight in front of him, the self-assured smirk of the younger man unsettled him quite a bit.
“Castiel is known to be pretty religious. Maybe he took this whole good versus evil thing way too much to heart," Sam explained, whereupon Jess nodded affirmatively. Dean brooded over the strange speech Castiel had delivered; he couldn’t get his intense look out of his head, how his eyes seemed to burn with a righteousness and certainty Dean had never seen before. But then, his attention returned to the here and now - finally, the graduates were called on stage and received their certificates – since it was an alphabetical order, it took ages until Sam was called up, as Winchester came pretty much at the end of the alphabet. Dean felt as if he had ants in his pants, he was so excited, he couldn’t sit still. When Sam was called on stage and received his certificate, Dean jumped up and clapped enthusiastically, blithe he made an utter fool of himself. He was reacting like an overeager proud parent cheering his son on, but he just couldn’t help it. He was truly happy, filled with warm bliss from head to toe when he watched Sam’s content smile. It seemed to Dean that Sam caught his look, even from the stage, and that they regarded one another for a second, both of them just merry and lost in the moment.
For the next few hours, it was wonderfully quiet in the house. Dean helped Bobby tidy up and mop the floors, while the radio played old rock songs at a low volume. When he was on his hands and knees, rubbing the dirt stains off the parquet flooring, Dean suddenly heard the loud snoring noise from upstairs. He and Bobby both halted in their movements and looked at each other. Then they started grinning in unison.
Dean was crying by now, laughing nervously to himself as he wiped one tear from his face with trembling fingers. Sam, that little son of a bitch. He was thankful for having such a brother, who was so concerned about his well-being. It felt like the weight of the world had been lifted from Dean's shoulders, everything was falling into place now. Though he and Castiel had never spoken directly about it, he knew he mattered to the other man and that he loved him. He didn't even let his mind wander off to the direction that Castiel would decide against him, he couldn't dwell on these negative thoughts. He had heard enough. Slowly, he walked back to the bed and sat down, holding his head in his hands as he let the tears flow unstoppably. He was so spellbound with bliss, he didn't know what to do about it as lightness expanded in his whole body. It were tears of joy running down his cheeks in small rivulets, he was actually hiccuping he was so upset. The stress and the burden of the last weeks faded away. Somehow, it was easier to breathe.
A hmm, hmm.
Dean’s heart stumbled violently at hearing that. It took his breath away. He felt as if struck by lightning, but so overall happy, it made him completely giddy. Castiel was the sweetest guy he had ever met, and to hear these honest and heartfelt words escaping his kissable lips… it made Dean feel as if he was on top of the world. He couldn’t stifle the grin coming to life on his mouth. Castiel caught the feisty glimmer in Dean’s eyes and beheld him with a frown.
"I have rock salt underneath my bed, but I think it's enough for now, right? I believe it's you," Dean clarified.
"That's why I hadn't told you what I'm doing. No one ever believes me," he said with a grin, then he set himself to work to make Castiel's flat demon-proof. It didn't take a long time, Dean left a few sigils in Castiel's kitchen and on his apartment door. When he returned to Castiel's bedroom, his lover lay on his side peacefully and considered him with a long, thoughtful look. He patted the empty bedside invitingly and Dean lay down beside him cautiously. It felt plainly
Dean noted, in every frame, she was sitting in a wheelchair – and as Castiel had aged, so had she. The wheelchairs had changed during the years – in the photo, which Dean thought was the latest, he saw her laying in a flat wheelchair, one of those, in which one could actually lie, and Castiel's eyes seemed less lively, veiled with pain, as he stared into the camera with a forced smile. He held her crinkled, skinny hand in his. It made Dean feel uncomfortable, specifically when he compared the earlier images of Castiel with the newest ones. The change was obvious, tremendous. He was deeply lost in thought, absentmindedly he regarded the empty, numb look of those gorgeous blue eyes in the last photo. Suddenly, he felt a warm hand on his shoulder, and he startled, ripped out of his own world of thought. Castiel handed him a glass of red wine, which Dean accepted with a quiet, "Thanks." He sipped the wine, turning to the photographs once more.
"Morning, Cas... I've got to go to work. Make yourself at home...", he said softly, then he leaned down and pressed his lips against Castiel's, giving him a chaste, slow kiss. Drowsily Castiel inhaled Dean's clean scent and answered to the kiss, applying as much finesse and gentleness as he could, hearing Dean hum against his mouth, and he sounded terribly pleased. Then Dean pulled pack and once again his fingers carded through the dark strands of Castiel's ruffled hair. A terrible weight returned to Castiel's eyes, and he closed them unwillingly. He heard a door close and he sank into deep oblivion, catching up on the sleep he had missed within the last week.
“What are you talking about, Cas? It’s not your fault. I’m just worried about you, that’s all… and of course, I’m there for you if you need me. Don’t ever think you’re a burden to me…”
“Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that,” Sam replied. “Listen, Dean, Jess and I have been thinking about your idea. With little Mary on the way… I just can’t picture our lives without you as her uncle close in the picture. I heard from so many first-time parents that it’s always good to have some family as a support system, because, apparently, raising a little human being can get quite exhausting. Jess and I would feel better if we knew you’re close by. And what you told me about Bobby living such a solitary life… I think we owe him more than just a visit every now and then. He’s family, too, after all.”
Dean refused to be moved by Castiel's concern, so he let that remark pass without comment. He supported his heated forehead with the tear-stained fingers of his right hand, his raised elbow rested on his tucked up knee.
Incredible heat streamed through Dean's lower stomach, he realized he was growing hard. He could already sense the thick, hard outline of Castiel's erection pressed against him. Dean couldn't control it as he groaned frantically and rotated his hips in small circles, sliding against Castiel's bulge seductively.
Dean smiled sorrowfully, remembered the shock in Castiel’s eyes only too well.
Sadness at the mere prospect of never seeing Castiel again filled Dean’s heart. Partly, he understood Castiel’s uncertainties, for, as he had also said tonight, people were fickle, as was their fortune, but he was in no doubt about his love for Castiel – it wouldn’t wither as quickly as it had come, but would blossom like a pretty flower with every future day. He didn’t find the words for the chaos in his chest, even though he wanted to give comfort to his lover.
“Aaron,
Dean had excused himself after breakfast to lie down in his bed again. He couldn’t really do anything with these damn headaches anyway, when he felt like he wanted to blow his brains out all the time. Because the apocalyptic weather outside really didn’t leave a lot of room for lengthy strolls, Bobby had announced he would drive Castiel to church and even accompany him, which had put a mirthful and pleased smile on Cas’ mouth. Dean hadn’t really wanted to go to church again anyway, feeling that it wasn’t really working for him. He heard Bobby shout goodbye to him through the house, then he and Castiel left and closed the front door with a bang.
act like an exercise-addict at the same time. Luckily, Sam entered the room in this moment, saving Dean from losing his dignity. Castiel turned halfway around and smiled at Sam.
Castiel got rid of his grey T-shirt and threw it away, Dean let his eyes dart over the arousing sight blatantly. Castiel looked beautiful in the lush, golden sunlight filling the room; his skin was smooth and slightly tanned, his eyes were lucid and inhumanly glowing, his dark hair framed his face perfectly. Dean barely had time to get used to the sight, as Castiel's fingers tugged at his shirt impatiently. He took the hint and sat up a little, Castiel still sitting in his lap, and removed his shirt as well. The atmosphere heated up when their bare torsos slid together, when naked skin on skin collided, causing sparks of electricity. Excitement pumped through Dean's veins, his whole body throbbed with pleasure as he kissed Castiel hungrily again, hearing his appreciative hum – it vibrated against his bottom lip. He moved closer. His hands traveled down Castiel's muscular back, down to his firm butt, and he groped the two globes greedily, his fingernails digging into the slacks' texture. At that, Castiel moaned loudly and moved his pelvis forward against Dean's; he stopped kissing him and let their foreheads fall together. Their eyes were glued to one another, there were ragged breaths against their kiss-wet mouths. Dean was quickly losing every sense of control the longer he stared up into those dilated, gorgeous eyes consuming him attentively. Then Castiel began rutting against his erect cock in a smooth, tentative motion, and Dean's lids fluttered shut, overwhelmed with nervousness and arousal. The friction was wonderful, it set Dean alight and made his cock harden tempestuously.
„Yeah, that was a little bit weird,” he admitted.
Surprised, Dean watched Castiel grab his hand and bring it to his lips. He left a coy, feather-light kiss on the back of Dean’s hand, making him wince with pleasure. His jaw dropped when he spotted the fondness in Castiel’s eyes as he regarded him, when Castiel smiled genuinely. It seemed the glum had partly fallen from him. There was a beautiful, spirited glint in his eyes as if a thousand fireworks had exploded in them. He nodded affirmatively. Then, with a sigh, he let go of Dean’s hand and lay back in the pillows again, made himself comfortable. He closed his eyes, looked exhausted. Dean studied him, wondered if Castiel’s fatigue was the aftermath of all those drugs or the emotional turmoil he had suffered from recently. Maybe it was a combination of both that had worn him out.
"Touché," he replied sullenly, then he hobbled to the bed and settled himself slowly on Castiel's comfortable, broad mattress. While he sat he undid his boot (he still longed for the day when he could use the whole pair again, his injury made it impossible to wear both shoes), he felt Castiel shift behind him, possibly turning on his side. He could practically sense the prying eyes burning holes into his back with their intense gaze. The sensation of this assumption was pleasant and exciting at the same time. Dean felt the familiar heat rise in his stomach, his hair stood on end.
Bobby let go of him and gripped both of Castiel’s shoulders, looking at him sternly.
“No shit, Sherlock,” Dean replied with a grin, slurping his drink loudly. Castiel didn't think twice, he did the only thing reasonable to him – he reached out his hand and placed it carefully on Dean's shoulder, startling him unintentionally. Dean was choking on his drink, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, about to chide Castiel for making him jump. But then he looked down at himself, recognizing his body and clothes were as dry as a bone. Hell, even his hair and shoes and socks were pleasantly dry.
The Marshall Tucker Band - can't you see   (really really like this one)
"I see you've made acquaintances?", Castiel asked with a sideglance and an amicable smile, which Dean returned with an equivalent one.
He tugged at Dean’s waistband, drew him in, as he kissed Dean deeply again. Their eyes fell shut, and they got lost in one another, as they kissed and kissed as if the world was ending, as if this was the only thing of import. Castiel determinately undid the shackles of Dean’s costume while they slowly kissed. It made Dean nearly speechless with stupid want, his head swimming. His costume fell to the floor with a quiet thud, and then Cas’ slender fingers crawled under his white tunic, stroked along the expanse of hot, smooth skin. His clever caresses electrified Dean with insatiable thirst, and he bent his hips closer to Castiel’s, longed to eliminate any distance between them. He pecked Castiel’s lips once more, then he let go to consider his lover.
“Oh, you know how to talk to a man,” he joked, but then the smile slipped from his mouth as Cas made him shut up with a hard, eager kiss, laying all teasing aside. Impatiently they kissed, their arms holding the other, and Cas moaned into their kiss, causing Dean’s heart to somersault enraptured. He released his fears, his hesitance, and let his body take over, did what felt right to him, symbiotic. While opening Castiel’s jeans with skilled fingers, he brought his mouth to Cas’ throat, nibbling at the soft skin, leaving bloody bruises there – he felt Castiel become lax with want at that, moaning and sighing sensually and rocking his hips against Dean’s.
“Are you okay, buddy? We just got away in time, but you don’t look too relieved about it.”
Blunt fingernails scraped over Dean's torso and hips, seeking comfort and sympathy as Castiel began to spiral towards his climax. He was constricting around Dean, Dean felt the stutter of his partner's hips, how erratic his breaths became, how heart-wrenching his moans and sighs sounded... Time had come to a standstill the moment Castiel opened his eyes strainedly, his fingernails digging into the soft flesh of the penetrator's waist while Dean kept slamming into him relentlessly. A fierce blush spread on the dark-haired man's chest and cheeks, crawled up his throat. He screwed up his eyes and hot streams of white slippery come suddenly spurted out of his erection, besmearing his abdomen and torso at irregular intervals. He was shaking and lolling underneath Dean, moaning lewdly as the orgasm washed over him. The sight alone would have been enough to get Dean off too, but on top of that Castiel's insides were
Something seemed to break in Sam's eyes, their expression became dull and glassy at the same time. Within the length of a second, Sam's face fell, despite his size he looked terribly small and defeated as his shoulders slumped down and as he averted his gaze. Instantly Dean felt regret about his unkind words, he hadn't meant to upset Sam for things he had forgiven him a long time ago. Gently Dean put a hand on Sam's shoulder and sighed. He needed to fix this, Sam and he were all they had. Also, he had never liked seeing Sam like this – in all those years, Dean had always cheered him up and had taken care of him. That was what big brothers were there for, right?
Dean's voice had become barely a whisper the longer he spoke, and Castiel felt a warmth seething within his chest. He bit his bottom lip, absorbed Dean's carefully chosen words – he had failed to hide what Castiel meant to him, and that he wanted them to become something serious was more than Castiel had ever dreamt of. It electrified him from head to toe, and he choked on his breaths, too emotionally smitten to reply. Soon he bend down over Dean's slackened body, and he kissed his neck cautiously, letting his open mouth glide over the freckled, sensitive skin of Dean's crook of the neck. He noted Dean became rigid underneath him, as Castiel's bare chest ghosted over Dean's back, scarcely touching it. He knew Dean could feel his semi-hard dick gliding over the curves of Dean's perfect firm clothed butt, but it was beyond Castiel to worry about it. Boldly he let his mouth wander to Dean's ear, and he breathed in it hotly, and to his delight he felt Dean squirm in response to it, tensing up and holding his breath, seemingly attentive to every of Castiel's motions.
Raphael shook his hand.
“Please, baby, I wanna feel you,” Cas rasped, making Dean understand how far gone he was, that he couldn’t take much more if Dean continued with his seduction. He nodded, inhaled a trembling breath. It was always an exhilarating feeling, nerve-wracking, the few minutes filled with pleasant anticipation until their bodies melted together. Dean crawled up to Cas’, lay down beside him and let him kiss him stupid, let Cas turn him on his back while they kissed open-mouthed, their tongues sliding together lewdly. He swallowed nervously when Cas sat down in his lap. He regarded him in the moonlight, thought how admirable he looked, how sexy with Dean’s hard-on pressed between his thighs. Determinately, Cas reached for the bottle of lube, spread it over Dean’s erection with a tight fist, long strokes. It made Dean cant his hips, move towards this knowing hand. His own tortured moans resounded in his ears, he became lax and taut with lust, winced when he felt the lube warm up. The friction of Cas’ hand was perfect, turned his insides to jelly, made his blood burn with aching need. Mesmerized, he watched Castiel sit up a little, sensuality veiling his features. He looked like an angel to Dean, as his jaw dropped, his mouth slightly agape, as he took Dean inside slowly. A frown of bittersweet pain marred the sensuality as he took Dean deeper and deeper inside, feeling him filling him up. Dean’s abdomen was convulsing, moving on its own, as he couldn’t stop pressing into Cas, addicted to his incredibly tight heat. However, he managed to grasp Castiel’s hips with a firm grip, made him stop.
"I'll get your stuff and prepare the clinic with the symbols. I guess it's best to climb on the roof", Sam mumbled and Dean dismissed him with an approving nod. He laid down for a while, and tried to get used to the bed and the room he would mostly be in for the upcoming weeks. Not even five minutes had passed when someone knocked on his opened door. He looked up, one hand underneath his head, to see a man about his age standing in the door. He wore a light blue uniform, which underlined the deep blue colour of his eyes and flattered his slightly tanned, rosy skin. He had dark hair, a slim figure, and the most tantalizing smile Dean had seen in a long while.
"Hm, you seem kind of hot for his knickers", Sam noted, enhancing the blush lingering on Dean's cheeks.
He didn’t hear from him the whole week. They had switched numbers weeks ago. In the first days, Dean checked his phone for messages constantly, nervously, then he realized he was behaving foolishly, like a teenager with a crush. So he managed to look at his phone less often, that was a win. Also, he admitted to himself that the lack of communication was probably exactly what Castiel needed right now. Dean wasn’t going to push him. So he kept himself from writing to Cas or calling him, even though his fingers were itching to do so. He couldn’t ban the nagging, infinite worry for Cas, was constantly wondering what he was doing, if he was okay, where he was… And even though he knew that Castiel’s silence probably had nothing to do with him, Dean kept wondering if the weeks at Bobby’s had been nothing but a dream, if maybe he didn’t mean that much to Cas.
The van suddenly pulled into the side road. Dean took a sharp curve with squeaking wheels to follow it. Suddenly, severe rain fell from the sky, turned the world into an impenetrable veil of wet gray. Thick raindrops robbed Dean of his sight, filled up the whole windshield. Dean turned on the windshield wipers to their highest pace. A forceful gust hit the car’s side and made it drift away from the street. Dean gripped the steering wheel tighter and counter-steered with all his might, cursing under his breath. For a moment, he couldn’t see the traffic anymore. His gut feeling screamed at him that it was nothing but stupid to drive in this weather, especially hunting down another car at this insane speed. But he couldn’t abandon Cas just because of his own safety. He had to get to him.
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam said, sounding somewhat choked up with emotion, making Dean smile wistfully.
“I know it’s too little too late, and it won’t bring back Benny or Anna, but I’m truly sorry for what I’ve done. I didn’t mean to take Anna’s life. I couldn’t think straight. I’m sorry.”
"First of all, I only did what you asked me for. Secondly, I had my fun, and I guess there are other descriptions for that than "half bad". Oh, and lastly, you can call me whatever you want." The man laid down again and sighed in pleasure, a smug smile painted on his relaxed face when he observed Castiel, his head rested on his hand while his elbow was propped up. Castiel turned around and lay completely down next to him on his side, mirroring his position. He let his gaze glide over the man's body up to his face, and he couldn't help but return the smile. He really found the man captivating, and he needed to know his name at the very least. He wanted to know the name of the man who had made him feel incredibly aroused so easily.
"You're so...ahhh...," Castiel moaned, biting on his bottom lip when Dean responded to Castiel's pace and rode his every thrust voluptuously, arching his back. "Fuck, so good, Dean!," Castiel cried out, his brow furrowed with tantalizing lust. Every notion of resistance was forgotten while Castiel glided into Dean. His head fell into the crook of Dean's neck as if he was overmastered by being united with Dean. Dean's hands stroked down Castiel's smooth back and up through his hair, squeezed him and held him as close as possible. He enjoyed the nipping of Castiel's teeth on his neck and the greedy lips which sucked on his skin, leaving purple hickeys in their wake. It didn't take long and Castiel hoisted Dean's ass and shoved into him with an alternative angle – and the air was punched out of Dean, he choked on his own breaths. A flash of pleasure shot through him, made his whole body tense up so that he was even digging his toes into the ground. Castiel's cock head stroked along his sweet spot, made Dean's legs twitch and forced him to become a boneless puddle of chaos and rapture. He was soon getting lost in the ecstasy of being pushed over the edge, of feeling so sexually satisfied.
Hand in hand they strolled back to their house, their eyes fleeing to one another as they exchanged heartfelt smiles. And even though a catastrophe was hanging in the air, imminent and inescapable, Dean was happy that they were together in this, that they weren’t fighting anymore. He and Cas basically never fought, and when it happened, he hated every second of it. When they were inside, Cas directly went to their bedroom and made himself ready for the night. Dean followed him, thought he had a point.
"What are you still doing here, then? You're only stopping me from finishing these files. Go meet him for lunch or something and let the adults do their job. No one will notice your absence for one or two hours", Gabriel proposed teasingly. Castiel felt a grin come to his face to distort it in a brutish manner – he must have looked like a love-stricken teenager who couldn't keep still, and, admittedly, he also felt like one.
“You know I don’t care what happens to me, Cas, as long as I get you back. I’m coming to get you right now.”
"I believe you, Dean. It's not important, I feel like you're a good guy. I feel like I know you..." Castiel said quietly, his voice was barely a whisper. Dean's heart skipped a beat, his breathing stopped for a second. Suddenly, Castiel laughed lightly, and Dean furrowed his brow in confusion. He smiled, unable to withstand responding to Castiel's beautiful, laughing face. "What is it?" he asked and Castiel grinned and wagged his head dismissively.
Senator Gilbert was one of the biggest shareholders of the Montagues’ corporation. John had been making donations to him for a while now to win his favor, but the senator was standoffish and kept his cards close to his chest. John continued speaking.
Benny perked up his eyebrows and regarded Dean suspiciously.
Castiel broke the brooding silence between the three of them, suddenly addressing Sam to Dean's surprise.
Instead, he let himself lower down and he slowly embedded his body on Dean's naked frame, wet through with perspiration and quickly chilling down under him. The touch of their naked chests against each other was electrifying, so intimate as they felt each of their breaths move against each other. Castiel never wanted to leave the warmth of Dean's skin, wanted to remember the sensation of this smooth skin pressed against his. He wrapped his arms around Dean's sides and pillowed his head on Dean's shoulder, feeling him melt against him easily. He heard a soft sigh, and its draft brushed against the hair of his temple. Then Dean's arms enveloped him too, he even put his legs above Castiel's, and he squeezed Castiel appreciatively, pulling his body as close as possible.
The sun was still shining as if it might never rain again, and in the shadows, the temperature was pleasantly warm. The world appeared docile and tranquil. Boughs were swaying in the wind, and the blossoms of wildflowers displayed their rich colors everywhere. Dean appreciated the peacefulness all around them and to sit here and do nothing but drink a beer with Cas. When he studied the other guy, he realized Castiel was smiling blissfully as he was watching something in their vicinity. Dean’s eyes followed his look and then he discovered the beehive in the branches of one of the trees, too. Busily the bees were flying in and out of the beehive, carrying the pollen they had collected. Dean hadn’t paid attention to it before, but now he could hear the constant susurration of little wings and the buzzing of the bee colony.
The room was small and windowless – as a source of light, there was a bedside lamp and innumerous candles at the ready, lined up on the desk. Dean turned on the lamp and shut the door behind them. The room was now dipped into faint golden light, left the idea of shades on their features. They smiled hesitantly at one another, as Dean produced a lighter from his pocket and lit a few candles. A concentrated frown was on his face as he lit candle by candle. Their flames flickered ghostlike, made Dean’s eyes glimmer beautifully. Suddenly overcome with the love he felt for him, Castiel approached Dean, hugged him from behind, and wrapped his arms around his middle. He pillowed his chin on Dean’s broad shoulder, nosed at his throat, and sucked in his wonderful fragrance. It was becalming to feel his body in his arms, to sense the little motions of his chest with every breath.
Utterly spent, he fell on his stomach, felt the cold blanket on his sweaty, flushed skin. He was breathing raggedly, his body buzzing with the afterglow of his powerful climax. His lids weighed tons, he was cozily exhausted and braindead, as he risked a look at Cas. His lover lay on his bed in a similar position, raising his head, so that he could look at Dean. The white light of the laptop screen was mirrored in Cas’ gorgeous eyes, made them glow unearthly beautiful. There were beads of sweat on his forehead and temple, his dark hair was a little wet, and a blissed-out, sly smirk graced his mouth when their eyes met. Dean chuckled and pillowed his head on his hand.
Dean wandered around Castiel's apartment aimlessly, his mouth gaping, his eyes widened. He just couldn't believe how fast Castiel had wiped the slate clean. Almost all of his shelves in the living room were disjointed in their individual parts, leaning against an empty wall meaningfully. There were a few moving boxes, probably stuffed with Castiel's books, CDs and DVDs. The place looked abandoned, and somehow, a definite peacefulness dwelt inside this blankness. It was obvious that the person inhabiting this flat was moving on to another stage of their life, another unwritten chapter.
„Thanks, I guess?”
A sentiment of uncertainty expanded in Dean's chest the more he revealed of himself and the life he had come to know – all the time the thought hovered above his head what Castiel would think of all this. Would he be disgusted, appalled by Dean's narrations? Would he even believe him, and would these confessions change their relationship? Maybe Castiel would finally realize what a poor match Dean was for him. That he wasn't someone you should surround yourself with. He feared his condemnation. Nevertheless he told him about his mother's death, how it had brought his family to this kind of life. Briskly he gave him a crash course about all the nasty things lurking in the dark – he felt Castiel's breath falter several times as he told of vampires, ghosts, reapers and other unworldly creatures. His therapist became rigid in his arm often, but Dean could practically feel the interest seeping through his every pore, how he listened to Dean attentively, afire for more.
He wanted to tell him that he had missed him too, and that he was almost delirious with joy about their reunion – but his face fell as he realized Castiel's smile became melancholic and that bitter tears were welling in his eyes. His hand felt mechanic and lifeless in Dean's, he wasn't responding to his gentle pressure at all.
to him, as they both basked in the intense glow of their orgasms, lust flowing through them like one boiling ocean. It were only seconds, but it felt like eons to Castiel, the moment he laid eyes on Dean's beautiful body, relaxing and giving in to coming so sensually, one of his hands stroking himself through the intervals in which his white come painted his abdomen. Dean's lids fluttered open, and when their eyes met, Castiel knew, he never wanted to be anywhere else or with anyone else. The tiny smirk, the blush tinting Dean's cheeks, the way he breathed ragged breaths – the baffled expression of his eyes, it all was too loveable, cutting through Castiel's heart bestially. He used the strength of his upper arms and uplifted Dean again, making him sit in his lap again, his diminishing erection still deeply buried in Dean's fervent, loosened, slick heat.
The following words tumbled out of Castiel’s mouth as his nerves went haywire. He was on the verge of hyperventilating as he tripped over his words, crying flustered. Just listening to him in this state left a sharp twinge in Dean’s heart, made him wish he was right there with Cas.
Suddenly, there was a loud noise in the entrance hall. The heavy wooden door fell out of the doorframe, splintered. They all turned around, shocked about the unexpected intrusion. In stormed Zachariah Capulet, dressed in a black coat, heavily armed with a rifle. He walked up to them, the rifle pointed at them. With a pounding heart, Dean and Castiel exchanged swift, hunted looks.
"Evening, I'm looking for a prisoner, who has been brought in here a few hours ago, I guess. His name is Dean Winchester..." Immediately she checked the data on her computer, then she told him the section of the building and the cell number. She explained to him the usual safety instructions, and he really had to bite his bottom lip so as not to shout at her – he knew all this stuff inside out, and he knew she was just doing her job, but he wanted to see Dean, nothing else. When she was done, she nodded to a stout, grim-looking guard, who was supposed to accompany him.
“I’m ready, Dean.”
When Dean fell gradually asleep he realized how worn out he felt, thoroughly permeated with yearning and the worst apprehensions.
Through the kitchen window, he watched the sun hovering above the horizon, about to descend fully – the sky was a beautiful tangerine havoc, a massacre of sanguine, violet, and blue. Pale stars were twinkling far above, mystical and inexplicable. Dean felt a sudden urge to leave the house and breathe in the spicy air of the summer evening. A heavy sigh left his mouth, a strange tension weighed heavy on his heart.
His therapist scrambled and got to his feet. He reached out a helping hand for Dean and pulled him up with the same effortless and gracefulness Dean still lacked of. He felt a little bit empty and gloomy when Castiel's fingers let go of his hand, he instantly missed their warmth; they were standing so close in front of each other, he could feel Castiel's breath touching his chin hotly, and they regarded each other for a second too long. Dean was certain, he would never get over the way those eyes looked like, so beautiful, so gorgeous, the irises showing a colour he had never seen before. Furthermore, Castiel had a mouth to die for, plump, slightly chapped lips, and seemingly so pliant and soft it would make your knees turn into jelly. A smile twitched at them, and Dean couldn't stop smiling either. Though the atmosphere had been somewhat tense an hour ago, it felt now so damn relaxing to be in Castiel's company, Dean never wanted it to end. Eventually Castiel got a hold of himself, because he said "I'll see you tomorrow, I will drop in after you've had breakfast", and Dean couldn't even stop his shoulders slumping down to some degree. Tomorrow had to be sufficient. He nodded and accepted the crutches Castiel handed him.
A pained smile appeared on Castiel’s kiss-swollen lips and he beheld Dean with a piercing, knowing look, as if he could read his mind easily and knew exactly what Dean was thinking. He cozied up to Dean and placed a hand on his chest, right above his heart, which was thundering avidly at that, longed to greet its owner. Gingerly, Castiel’s fingers stroked over Dean’s clothed chest, drew little circles that tickled him, while their eyes locked. The Cure’s song “Lullaby” was currently playing in the background, filling the small apartment with its quiet guitar sounds. Dean caught some of the lyrics and smiled moved, thought they fitted this trusted conversation.
Relief and lust overwhelmed him, and for a few seconds he could do nothing else but pant and relax his limp body against the sheets. Slowly he picked up the phone again, hearing Dean's heavy breathing and a few moans that were still escaping the younger man.
As always, please let me know what you think! Suggestions, thoughts, everything is much appreciated!
While beholding Castiel all the while, Dean slowly pulled down Castiel’s briefs and tuxedo trousers in one sleek motion, exposing him. With a sly smirk, Dean watched Castiel quickly getting rid of his socks and dress shoes. When Castiel sat up on the table, Dean couldn’t help but think how gorgeous and destroyed he looked, how tempting: His lower half was naked, whereas his upper half was only clad in an opened shirt, which was barely clinging to his shoulders now. Dean spread his bare thighs and slipped between them, looking down into Castiel’s eyes. He tilted his head and kissed him again, slowly, cherishing the sensation of Castiel’s supple lips. Their mouths were sliding together, and there was a fine force in Castiel’s kisses, which made Dean’s knees buckle. Castiel threw his arms around Dean’s neck during their kiss and pulled him closer, his fingernails digging into Dean’s nape possessively. Dean felt the heat of Castiel’s erection as it pressed against his, and it made his head spin.
Wild knocks against the closed door startled both of them; a rough male voice yelled "Time is up, next customer's waiting!"
“No, no, no… this isn’t right, Dean. You acted on impulse, you weren’t thinking straight. We’ll find a way, somehow… we need more time to figure something out, we need—“
Castiel doesn't know that Dean measures his time dependent on him. He has categorized his life in three fractions nowadays – the years pre-Cas, his time with Cas at his side, and the worst era, the without-Cas-era. He can barely remember the person he had been before Hell, before Cas and the angels and the apocalypse had taken over his life. Everything had changed the moment Castiel had rescued him from the pit. Dean is reminded of the months in which he thought Castiel was dead, after the Leviathans had left his vessel – only it is worse this time. This time, he knows Castiel is alive, at least he hopes no other angel or demon has killed him yet; It's worse, because Castiel doesn't return to him, doesn't care, doesn't trust. Nevertheless he can't control his needs and his affection for the angel, growing stronger with each day he longs for him. Dean is not aware that Castiel has been captured meanwhile, being threatened and tortured by Crowley and Naomi.
When they stood outside on the stairhead, the sun’s luminous rays shone down on them, caught in their hair and lit up their eyes like burning gems. Dean marveled at the light refracting in Castiel’s gorgeous blue eyes, he thought he had never seen a creature so loveable.
“Dean?” he asked and turned around to the other man, a smile and an exasperated look in his eyes.
“Yeah, and look how that turned out,” Sam scolded. They both blew out their noses, considering the situation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, that didn’t work for me at all, Cas. It only got worse! Why the hell did you drag me along to this place?” he vented his anger. He immediately regretted it when sorrowfulness manifested on Castiel’s clean-cut face, how grieved he seemed.
Out of the corner of his eyes, Dean realized Castiel was constricting with discomfort – Dean could also feel the tension coming to life in Castiel’s whole back, he could feel how Castiel became rigid right underneath his palm. Immediately he felt regret. He hadn’t meant to push Castiel.
"You know... since my predecessor prepared you... I bet I could push myself inside you easily, couldn't I?" Castiel let his fingers slide out of Dean, and he bit his bottom lip as he watched the silent figure in front of him, as he felt Dean's body warmth wafting across to him. His heart beat a frantic pace, and there it was again, the feeling between sadness, lust and fear. He saw how Dean reached out his arm and when he turned his hand back, he was handing Castiel the condom blindly. Dumbfounded Castiel took it in his numb hand and observed Dean resuming his position. Suddenly they were strangely silent; Castiel's eyes were glued to Dean's round ass as he opened the foil of the condom and rolled it over his erection. He wondered if Dean had been so compliant with the other man as well and blind fury flooded his mind. Determination took over him as he seized Dean's sweaty thigh and pulled it back towards him, so that he could penetrate him easier.
“Touchy subject, Cas. I wouldn’t go there,” Bobby grumbled while he put together the components of the pie.
“What will you do if he never stops running? What, if he decides not to come back to you?” Sam asked, and Dean actually winced at hearing that – it had been one of the questions he had avoided asking himself, but deep down, he knew he had to consider this option. He thought about it for a few seconds, wondered what his future life without Cas would look like. He saw visions of himself with Sam and Jess at their house, having dinner together, or how he played babysitter for Mary, or how he spent some quiet, laid-back evenings with Bobby. Yeah, he missed Cas, and he wanted him by his side – but when push came to shove, he could manage without him. His life was far from over yet, even though he had often thought so. There were so many things he was looking forward to, and he knew in the depth of his heart that he could be whole and happy again, even if it took some effort and time. He smiled to himself, felt the strength of conviction return to him, lending his soul wings.
“You mean
To feel Dean's eyes resting on his again,... it was divine, and it fulfilled Castiel with a strong feeling of happiness, that prickled down his spine. He ignored the confusion and the wild look flaming in Dean's eyes, red from crying, and he even managed to offer him a little, honest smile. He comprehended Dean was still crying and completely flustered, and his heart ached when he saw Dean's eyes narrowed in suspicion, which was aimed at him.
"I feel alive," he answered. Dean felt the fond regard in his own eyes as he smiled at his lover. What a wonderful being he was. He reached out his hand for Sam, and Sam accepted it and got to his feet with a groan. He was still wavering, the drunkenness hadn't left his system yet. Tempestuously, Dean grabbed him by the lapels of his shirt and pulled him close, scowling at him. Sam looked horrible, crushed by guilt, his physical wounds and the inebriation of his limbs. When he raised his eyes and regarded Dean, he seemed like the desperate, loveable kid again that Dean had watched over his whole life. Still, he shook Sam ruggedly.
The indentations of the ribbed condom were mind-blowing, how they squeezed every inch of Dean's cock teasingly, restricting his sore muscle; Castiel seemed to feel it to, for he was bringing his ass down constantly, so that the curves and each vaulting could tickle his hole voluptuously while he let Dean glide inside deeper and deeper. Mesmerized, Dean studied Castiel's blissful face, how enraptured he looked with his closed lids, his furrowed brow, as Dean tentatively starting thrusting into his tight, scorching hot tunnel. It didn't take long and his lover's legs were coming around Dean's waist, entwining their bodies further. Dean was becoming hooked on the desperate, quiet moans Castiel let loose, how they grew whiny and sometimes to aroused whimpers when Dean slammed into him ferociously.
Outside, it was hot and sultry – for this evening, a weather alert had been issued – but the dark storm clouds were still miles away, just bordering at the end of the horizon. Summer was reaching its zenith, and all creatures were suffering due to the ongoing heat. Dean had just the right cure in mind, and he whispered it into Castiel’s ear with a smug grin. Fifteen minutes later, they said goodbye to Bobby and excused themselves for a quick stroll before dinner – then Dean abducted his lover with a mysterious smile, and they were walking through the summery meadows hand in hand. Cas was giving him sneaking looks from time to time, squeezing his hand as an unspoken affirmation of his heart’s intentions.
Another stupid joke. Dean had no qualms about slapping Castiel's back of the head chidingly, loving how Castiel laughed carefree as Dean told him to shut up.
For a moment, he wondered if he was doing the right thing, moving away from such a good, loyal friend. Once more, he felt torn in two, not knowing whether it was better to stay or to go.
Dean waited patiently at the entrance door for Castiel, who strolled through every emtpy room with bouncing steps and a bemused shimmer in his deep blue eyes. He came up to Dean with a twitchy smile and threw his arms around his neck tempestuously, pressing Dean against him ardently. Dean's lids shut by themselves when sweet dizziness possessed him as Castiel's hot exhales fanned into his ear. He felt their chests move together with each in-and exhale. He could feel Castiel's lips move against his ear shell, how his hands ran up and down his spine, squeezing Dean against the younger man yearningly. He was simply melting in Castiel's embrace, his legs were turning to jelly. He smiled moved and held Castiel close when his lover whispered into his ear, running his fingers through Dean's short-cropped, dishwater blonde hair.
“Love you, too.”
“You’re the worst, Winchester! Love you!” Castiel called, then he left the house for work.
Yours,
The chilly night's wind played with their hair and clothes, tugged ruggedly at them. Earth frost spread on the ground, and soon it became too cold to keep sitting on the meadow. Castiel got up at first and held out his hand to help Dean stand up too. Dinner time was long passé; they had spent too much time holding hands, regarding the starry firmament, absorbed in their own thoughts. None of them mentioned their sudden willingness to become intimately physical with each other as they slowly walked back to the rehab-clinic. Their eyes fled to each other time and again, careful smiles crawled to their lips. At some point Castiel poked Dean amicably in the ribs with his elbow, surprising Dean as he met his mellow gaze while they kept walking.
„She’s good!” Dean called to drown out the music, showing her the thumbs up, whereupon Ellen grinned proudly.
"Dean is the best thing that happened to me in years, and I'll be damned if I ever let him go. I know what I want and I will put my back into it, but... I just can't shake off the thought where he is at right now, what he's doing or better, who he's doing it with when I'm not around. Is it selfish that I want him for myself wholly?... I don't know, Gabe. I'm far away from complaining, and I appreciate what I have with him at the moment. I just hope he feels the same..."
“Mister Winchester! What are you doing here?”
Utterly, stupidly in love with him. He longed to wrap him up in his arms now and hold him tightly, only to kiss him again and again, confessing his affection for him with softly whispered words...
It took a while until Dean felt like himself again. He let go of Castiel and got up again, stretched out a welcoming hand for Castiel to take.
“I didn’t
“And when I stood there in front of her grave, wondering where my life was leading, what I would do without her, where the purpose of it all was… suddenly, there was this bright ray of light struggling through the clouds. And it came to rest right on my mother’s grave and me – all the other graves surrounding me were still plunged into darkness. And I turned around and beheld the sky; there was a little spot of azure amidst the dark gray clouds… And then I knew…”
Castiel kept his eyes closed, looked as if he was about to fall asleep again, but he started talking anyway.
Castiel smiled brightly at Dean, and his smile was so infectious, Dean had to smile, too. He marveled at the vibrant light in Castiel’s deep blue eyes, how he was radiant with sheer joy. Gabriel piped up before Dean had a chance to steal a kiss from his lover and get lost in his nearness.
„Are you trying to woo me, Dean?” he asked jokingly, as they walked up the discotheque. Dean exhaled a brisk laugh.
“So, this is the kitchen,” Dean said and gave Jack a moment to take it in. “Cas is doing most of the cooking, he’s the reason why we’re living more or less healthy. But if you want hamburgers, waffles, or chili cheese fries once in a while, that’s my specialty, you gotta come to me. When worse comes to worst, I can also cook a decent, healthy meal, but that’s no fun. So, I was thinking, to celebrate today, home-made hamburgers for dinner?”
He pulled Castiel's boxers and slacks down in a lithe, skilled movement, and Castiel looked nothing but gorgeous and shy when Dean slid them over his wiggling feet. For a second, Dean admired Castiel as good as naked in his bed, lying under him, his hard, long cock straining upwards on his abdomen. One bold hand of Castiel stroked the inner side of his left thigh, and Dean silently studied the fingers moving lower and lower, disappearing under his balls. He felt the violent jerk of his erection as it hardened even more when Castiel assumingly dared to let one finger slide into his hot, narrow hole. Dean watched him hoisting his ass so that he could touch himself deeper. A concentrated frown veiled Castiel's features, he had his lids closed and his mouth opened to a mute scream. Dean could faintly recognize how Castiel added a second finger, stretching himself with small rotations of his hips. Dean's heart was hammering by now, he felt dizzy and desperate with euphoric lust. It made his flesh crawl and a hot shiver run down his back, seeing Castiel like this – trusting him with all he had, devoting himself to this mind-blowing rapture...
When they broke apart, Castiel's cheeks were rosy-tinted and his eyes befuddled with lust. His lips shimmered with the remnants of their kisses, he looked most delicious. Dean licked his lips nervously, his whole body subtly shaking with want and need. How he wanted to dive into Castiel and show him how much he appreciated him for being who he was... But there was no time now. He carefully stroked along Castiel's temple, wiping some blood away that was already drying.
"Dean, didn't he give you enough clues? Though you behaved like an ass, he still wanted to put things straight with you. I think that should tell you enough, that he still cares about you. You'd be an idiot to throw this away because of a dumb misunderstanding. I've seen the way he looks at you, and you know what? Your mother had the same expression in her eyes when she looked at me, and I was aware enough to recognize it and to understand what it meant – she loved me, and I was clever enough to never let her go. And so does this Castiel love you, so you better come to terms with him and compensate for the damage you caused."
"What is it?", he heard his lover ask. Dean smiled and squeezed his hand tenderly.
Dean laughed inwardly when he read the name of it, a sign above the entry "Silence is Golden" gave the philosophy of the owner blatantly away. As they walked inside he saw a dozen wooden square tables, which were roughly manufactured, and had comfortable-looking benches, dark with the same wooden material. The whole room appeared rustic and sturdy, but altogether Dean thought he liked the atmosphere of this place. The light was warm and dim, a lot of candles burnt on the tables and gave the restaurant a heartwarming, cozy touch. An eerie silence rang in Dean's ear; the lack of conversations was audible. A waitress brought them to their table and handed them menu cards with a quiet smile. She pointed at a slip of paper, which was attached to both cards – it explained the house rules, that no guest was allowed to talk or to communicate with written words. They nodded in unison to show her they had understood the little note, she smiled friendly at them and walked away to give them time to decide what they wanted to eat.
"No, Dean, that's not what I meant! I didn't want you to think I don't see your point of view, I really don't, it's just-", Castiel stammered helplessly, incredulous that this fight between them was really happening. Dean beheld him with a long stare while he spoke, and if Castiel hadn't known it any better, he was sure he saw disappointment in Dean's eyes, and it made him choke on a ball of ache strangling his throat. Dean stopped him with a wave of his hand and wagged his head a small bit. Then he sighed and smiled sadly at Castiel.
“Listen, Jack, if you want, I could teach you how to play the piano. When I was your age, I had lessons, too – and my teacher was
When he knocked at Bobby’s door, he was swaying a little on his feet, feeling a rush of adrenaline and tense nervousness when Bobby yanked up the door. The old man looked at him with a fire of zest for life burning in his eyes, a happy grin on his mouth. Dean only quickly registered a plaid shirt, tattered jeans, an old baseball cap, and Bobby’s bushy brown beard, then he was hauled into a bone-breaking hug. Bobby hugged him briefly and tightly, squeezing the air completely out of Dean’s lungs. Damn, that man had some strength, even for his age.
He began to suck him of in a tentative pace, his tongue massaged the underside in unison to his up and down movements. His saliva was mingling with Castiel's precome and it eased the way for Dean's lips to slide effortlessly. Castiel was twirling Dean's short stands of hair between his fingers absentmindedly, he was alternating between lengthy sighs and tortured, trembling moans. In his head Dean tried to imagine how his face would look like while he blew him – would his brows be furrowed? His eyes screwed up? His head thrown back? He could picture it perfectly... Insatiable greed took possession of Dean when Castiel arched his back once more as he deep-throated him. His hands took advantage of the moment and glided underneath Castiel's bottom, he grasped both firm buttocks and kneaded them unabashedly.
"Yeah, see you, Dean", Castiel replied, his face fell, and the smile he gave Dean seemed melancholic and bitter-sweet to him. The look of his deep blue eyes had changed to a hesitant, affected glance, which baffled Dean extremely. Despite that, he turned around again and walked to his room – he didn't want to ruin the tender vibe, which had thrived between them in the end, with inconsiderate, meaningless words.
"Well, whenever I got the time I play my old guitar, look after my Dad and talk to my brother on the phone. I'm also into combat sport and I like to work out once or twice a week, just to keep myself fit and defendable. Guess I need to be, considering my current situation", Dean smiled melancholically. He shoved another spoon of ice cream into his mouth, letting it melt on his tongue delightfully. "That's pretty damn good ice, by the way", he commented, giving Castiel a wink.
Jack raised his eyes slowly to Castiel, his look piercing with certainty.
On Sunday morning, however, Dean was woken up by caring, innocent kisses and a hungover Cas, who had crawled into his bed sheepishly. They dozed off again, Castiel lying comfortably in Dean’s arm – it was early forenoon when they finally managed to get out of bed for good. Bobby had cooked breakfast already when they appeared downstairs, and he seemed full of energy and adventurousness. While Cas and Dean were feasting on fluffy pancakes, Bobby placed a flyer on the kitchen table and tapped his forefinger on it decisively. Dean tilted his head to read the flyer. “Sioux Falls Butterfly House & Aquarium,” it said, and Dean knew what that meant. He caught Bobby’s expectant look.
“You better rest now, Pa. We want you to get well soon and come home, okay?”
“Are you sure you picked up the right one? He’s so polite, I’m not sure I can keep up these niceties.”
"Fancy a repetition of today? I kinda liked it...", Dean asked with an adorable shrug, and Castiel grinned and leant forward to kiss Dean fleetingly again. He felt Dean's smile against his mouth.
TO BE CONTINUED
Castiel felt shabby and almost himself like a criminal when he set foot in the brothel again. It seemed to become a habit. He knew he really shouldn't be here, and it was against his morals, but he also couldn't help feel drawn to this place, to the one man whose face never left his memory. The brothel was crowded, since it was a Friday night, and Castiel didn't waste time with ordering a drink. His heart pounded powerfully as his feet carried him to an elderly beastly man, who sat at a counter, clearly counting and managing money. Two stout bodyguards stood to either side of the counter and looked grimly at Castiel when he approached. His instincts told him this was the man he needed to give his money to if he wanted to see Dean this night. The man was chewing away on a cigar and gave Castiel an unimpressed look. He stopped counting the money and briefly asked "Who and how long?", to which Castiel immediately answered "Dean, one hour."
That was indeed new. Scoffing, Dean showed up in the kitchen, his arms outstretched in defense.
"So I suggest we check it out! I want to know if the D-EMF meter works correctly! Also, can't be too bad to know what those black-eyed bitches are up to, right?"
you make me wanna fuck you.”
Soooo… what do you think? Things will gather speed during the next chapters, promised x) next update will be on Friday!
„Sure, let’s go.”
He hid his face in the crook between Dean's jaw and clavicle, his hot breath moistening Dean's naked skin with his recurring stuttered exhales. Somehow Castiel felt at home, blissfully at ease, and yet as if barbed wire cut through his intestines, when Dean's sweet mouth placed a soft kiss against his temple. His warm breath was wafting in his ear and again a yearning was stirred inside his lower stomach that made it hard to think clearly.
Had he known how bold Castiel would become through these lessons... he would have hit Sam's and Castiel's backs of the head right there and then. Granted, Castiel was indeed experienced when it came to close combat. His Wing Chun training had steeled his muscles and sharpened his defense mechanisms. He was lissome and fast. On Wednesday afternoon, Dean watched Sam and Castiel practice on the lush, green grass of the park Castiel and him had spent a lot of time in. He sat right on the meadow, resting his weight on his backwards-stretched arms. A proud smile flickered over his mouth as he set his eyes, blinded by the sun, on Sam and Castiel fighting over and over again, lap after lap. Sam was clever and used all the dirty tricks Castiel was too naïve to think of. He stomped on Castiel's feet, who hadn't seen it coming, he pitched him and head-butted Castiel's forehead mercilessly, until the man was laughing and raising his hand to signal he needed a break. He rubbed his forehead with a painful grin, wiping the beads of sweat from his temples.
„The pleasure was all mine, buddy.”
, uhm, heat, you would say, it is
„I came up with the name,” Jo said boasting with pride.
I love Jess in this, she is cute hehe... sooo what do you think? Lemme know :-)
Dean smiled, a sweet warm wave of nostalgia washing over him. He nodded to himself.
Franz Liszt "La Campanella" (chapter 7)
Frédéric Chopin's "op. 28 no.4" (chapter 7)
Castiel let his hands cling to Dean's boney hips, his fingers dug into the soft flesh desperately, while he was trying to withstand the urge to ravage Dean. His whole being screamed for the man, so willingly stripped in front of him. Dean managed at some point to open his eyes again, and Castiel felt his hand leaving his rib, and his eyes widened in utter astonishment when he saw where Dean was moving it to. It wandered nonchalantly between his legs, under his testicles and Castiel was already guessing where this was heading to when he tilted his head to watch how Dean's forefinger slowly vanished inside his tight heat inch by inch. Castiel gulped down the painful lump in his throat, wishing frantically it was him who could bury himself in between those perfect cheeks, who could shove himself up to the hilt in Dean's vice-like narrowness. He wanted to burn himself so badly in those fiery walls enclosing him...
“So, Cas… what are our next steps from here?” Cas munched his cracker, frowned confused.
Dean told Cas about his application for a transfer to the Sioux Falls Police Department, and that he was waiting for the approval. Then he told him about the different apartments, which had aroused his interest, and in which districts of Sioux Falls they were located.
"So, do you live somewhere here?", Castiel asked and threw the ball back to Dean, both going down again.
„What do you mean?” he asked stupidly. And then he watched Castiel fumbling with the contents of his jeans pocket, getting out a wrapped condom and a small bottle of lube. He just couldn’t believe it. He must have looked super dumbfounded and stupid, because then Castiel was chuckling, his voice cutting through the oncoming night. Their eyes met, and Dean marveled at the mirthful gleam in Castiel’s blue irises, how a lopsided smile came to life on his kiss-wet mouth. From underneath his lashes, he sheepishly beheld Dean. His hands stroked along Dean’s upper body repeatedly, indulging him with fine caresses, which made Dean’s skin crawl electrically.
“As I said before, I could always transport us there-” Castiel tried to reason with Dean, but Dean raised his hand and interrupted him.
"You should have told me, Dean. This is not something to make fun of. If you're in pain, the healing process won't be quickened; it will only be slowed down. Now, let me have a look at how bad it is...", Castiel explained worriedly, and Dean felt like a child, who was being scolded. Hell, he felt damn stupid for not telling Castiel sooner. Castiel's fingers massaged Dean's thigh and the area around his knee, and it felt kind of voluptuous to Dean. He watched Castiel's strict features, while he kneaded his flesh. He might have felt a little bit sorry for his behaviour, but he absolutely enjoyed Castiel's knowing hands on him, they relaxed and aroused him at the same time. Too soon they were gone again.
more of Castiel, he needed to see him. At long last, the tiniest smile came to Dean's lips, as he remembered Castiel's hands intertwined with his, how their fingers had fitted together perfectly. He could still feel his thumb stroking over his gently; in his mind's eye he saw the smile Castiel had given him reaching his eyes, how the appearing crow's feet suited him. All at once, it couldn't be evening soon enough.
, I will,” Cas said with a contagious bright smile. It was reaching up to his eyes, made them shine unearthly beautiful. Stunned, Dean regarded him, felt as if all his innards were melting. He was brain-dead, infatuated goo. Castiel laughed about his obvious surprise, patted his cheek kindly.
"Couldn't have Sam applied for a student loan or something? It could've spared you the trouble...", Castiel wondered thoughtfully, observing Dean's beautiful face. His features were distorted with subtle desperation and some kind of melancholic gladness Castiel didn't comprehend.
Castiel smiled at him, a mysterious glimmer in his eyes, which captivated Dean wholly.
“I can’t believe you still remember that”, he said somewhat choked with emotion.
“Yeah, why not? What can I say, I just like donuts.”
“Here I stand, unveiled, just as I am – angel or no, will you take me for who I am? Will you love me just the way that I am?” Castiel quietly said. As harsh as his words might have sounded, as provoking and bitter, he stroked Dean’s upper arms with the utmost tenderness while speaking. It wasn’t a provocation, but a request. By intuition, Dean comprehended what Castiel was implying, read between the lines: Would he love him, despite his surname? Despite the blood spilled in his family’s name, despite the harm they had inflicted on the Montagues?
“What’s up with the lance?” he asked. Charlie shrugged.
"No, Cas... No, please, don't hang up. It's just, …I don't know what you want me to say. You stabbed me in the back, and I thought we were something serious... and since I returned from prison, my life is a mess, a complete, disgusting pile of crap, because now Sam and my dad are aware of what I did... as selfish as it sounds, I just can't handle this right now. Do you understand that? There's not enough space in my brain or heart to deal with all this damage, and I'm tired, man, I'm so fucking tired..."
On the screen, he saw Castiel was instantly replying, writing. Dean smiled a little. It seemed they were talking again.
“Cas, what’s up?” Dean asked breathlessly. Castiel swallowed nervously and took a deep breath.
"Alright, I guess", he answered, too flabbergasted to think clearly. The man's pale, blue eyes rested on Dean thoughtfully, worry lines joined the creases on his elderly face. He sighed and read Dean's record once more.
Now he lay on his back, downright relaxed and pleased. The warming sunlight caressed his skin, and the blanket had dropped down to the floor a good while ago. Castiel rested his head on his palm on his bent up elbow, and lay on his side. His fingertips stroked Dean's upper body and arms mindlessly while his eyes followed the movements of his hand attentively. Dean couldn't help but admire the subtle, sweet smile sticking to Castiel's mouth as he watched him incessantly. In his blue eyes the sunlight refracted, Dean thought he could count the hair of his lashes, they were so close. A strange tranquility remained between them where no words were needed. Castiel's cautious fingers traveled over Dean's whole upper body, glided over his arm, down to his wrist and the sensitive, thin skin of his inner arm. His entire body was already tingling with oversensitivity, it seemed that Castiel's fingers left fiery trails on his skin. Dean couldn't tear his eyes away from Castiel's. So much warmth and amazement lingered in the blue gems when they studied Dean laid out next to him... It made Dean feel loved and desired in all the right ways.
"Don't tell me you're all goodie two shoes. You must have poached some people; I bet your neighbours heard worse things!" Dean taunted, and he laughed when Castiel smacked the back of his head lightly. Castiel continued to massage Dean, and he sighed wretchedly when Dean moaned and grunted again. He had to agree, it definitely sounded as if they were having sex.
Damn it – so he had been on the right track before. He should have continued driving on E. Madison Street after all. He could have kicked himself for his bad luck.
“Wish I knew, Dean… I wish you didn’t have to go, that I could stay here with you forever. But, to be honest, I have no idea what I’m doing here, or where any of this is leading to,” Cas confessed – Dean was about to become confused and worried again, because what the hell was the point of falling in love with someone if you couldn’t be together? If it didn’t lead to anything more than just confessions of feelings for the other? But then Castiel placed his forehead on Dean’s shoulder and hid his face in the crook of Dean’s neck, and Dean instantly engulfed Cas in an intimate, close hug – and just like that, he was completely soothed again. Just holding Cas in his arms put all doubts and fears aside.
"Satisfied... at ease," Castiel murmured, leaving airy kisses on Dean's forehead in between every word. His thoughtful words suffused Dean with happiness as he listened to the heavy, slow thuds of his heart. This felt all kinds of right, and when he relaxed against Castiel's body once more, he savoured the sensation as the other's arms came around him and held him tightly. With closed lids he paid attention to Castiel's deep, rhythmic breaths, nothing short of deeply contented.
With the back of his hand Dean brushed over his hurting forehead, checking his face in the adjustable mirror of the passenger seat. Alright, so he would have a nice shiner too, he could already see that. His lip was cut as well as were his cheeks, he could practically see the imprints of the knuckles of whomever had hit him. His rib was bruised, his whole upper body felt as if someone had wanted to stone him to death and then overrun him with a bulldozer. His throat ached somewhat, given that someone had tried to choke him with his boot... And his head pounded with a nasty pain, but that was it. Apart from all of these things, he was fine.
"Dean, I have no idea what you're talking about. Honestly, I just heard what happened a few minutes ago!", Castiel defended himself; it ached badly, what Dean had said to him – that he even considered it as an option that Castiel had betrayed him, was disappointing and didn't do their relationship and their profound bond justice. Maybe Dean was so enraged about his cover being blown that he couldn't think clearly, and so he searched for a scapegoat, and Castiel was at hand. Still, it was no excuse, and Dean's eye-rolling and his humourless scoff infuriated Castiel too.
Dean grabbed the forgotten towel and started cleaning Castiel's face while the other man remained perfectly still, seemingly petrified due to Dean's caresses. He took his time to whisk off every stain of blood, every drying tear. He was as gentle with Castiel as he could, and the man seemed to relax with each passing minute, obviously enjoying Dean's affectionate ministrations.
“Yes,” Castiel groaned, sounding stifled as he was fighting against another wave of pain. “I’m in cabin twenty-four, or, well, the remains of it. I’m not sure how much longer I can fend Aaron off. And I think the tornado is heading right our way. I can hear the pines breaking apart outside already. You can’t come here, though, Dean. It’s too dangerous. I don’t want you to get hurt, too. Wait at least until the tornado has passed.”
"A strange tattoo you have there," Castiel mumbled, gazing briefly at Dean. "What is its meaning?"
Then Castiel blindly crawled into Dean’s lap and threw his arms around Dean’s neck. Dean felt his weight on top of him, and it felt so good, it elicited one moan after the other from him. He said goodbye to the attempt of rationality, he said goodbye to the idea of controlling this – instead, he let his hands grope Castiel, feeling and understanding the way his body was formed with growing arousal. Castiel’s skin was so hot, so smooth, when Dean’s fingers glided over it. Their mouths separated for a moment; they were panting breathlessly as Castiel looked down into Dean’s eyes with a meaningful look, his pupils dilated, his mouth half agape. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had been so aroused, when he had hungered for someone so strongly. He felt Castiel’s arms around his neck, how his fingernails dug into Dean’s shoulder blades desperately as he started rolling his hips. Dean felt the heat in his cheeks as he sensed his erection pressing against Castiel’s clothed ass, how the younger man moved his hips seductively alongside his dick. He was probably feeling Dean, how hard he already was. From the way Castiel bit on his bottom lip and moaned darkly, still staring into Dean’s eyes, Dean was certain he was feeling it, and that he was enjoying it.
"Actually, yeah... I'm thinking about joining this poetry course. Don't laugh at me, I'm kind of entranced with poetry. It was one of the only things that kept me interested back in school...", Dean confessed. Somehow, he was positive Castiel wouldn't make fun of him for saying such a silly thing. He lost himself in Castiel's blue eyes, which were darker and dilated in the evening's twilight. He looked so hauntingly beautiful, it touched the deepest foundations of Dean's heart, he felt a profound warmth growing within his chest. If only he could kiss those soft lips, claim them for himself... Castiel smiled and averted his glance, he tilted his head and looked up into the sky above them and sighed, and Dean had time to look his fill on Castiel's fine structured features.
Grinning, Dean sipped his cool beer, feeling it wet his throat pleasantly. His eyes were fixated on Cas, who seemed fidgety, as he fingered the foodstuff laying on the picnic blanket, toying with everything mindlessly. Actually, Dean had wanted to have dinner first and then announce why he had brought them here, but he sympathized with Cas’ impatience and decided he couldn’t leave him in the dark any longer. He reached over the blanket and covered Castiel’s hand with his, searched for his attention. Their eyes locked. It seemed time had come to a halt, as Castiel regarded him with an innocent look, vulnerability, and uncertainty shining in his glance. Dean smiled fondly, trying to soothe his lover. He squeezed his hand mildly.
"Hello, gorgeous", he whispered quietly into it, hearing Dean's chuckle rumble through his body.
"Even when the memories become blurry during the years, the feelings won't change. You will always remember how you felt about them, how they felt about you. No one can take that away from you, not even time itself," Dean assured him with quiet words. He saw Castiel gulp heavily as if a terrible pain was strangling his throat, and tears were welling in his eyes as he squeezed Dean's hand and nodded wordlessly. He clicked his tongue with a sudden, bitter expression, and then he got up and brushed over his eyes with the back of his hand, walking towards the door again. He turned around and stopped before he left Dean, smiling tenderly at him.
Suddenly, Castiel was standing behind Dean, a cup of coffee in his hands as well. Dean startled out of his thoughts, wincing at Castiel’s question. Dean didn’t know what to say as he looked up into Castiel’s face, who had tilted his head and contemplated Dean with a calm expression, a tender smile on his mouth while their eyes locked.
Jack sprung to his feet, grabbed Dean’s hand eagerly, and pulled him up. Any trace of sleepiness was gone, both of them were wide-awake now. Dean couldn’t help but feel this big lump in his throat when Jack held his hand, abducted him downstairs. It felt like a blessing to intertwine their fingers, to be trusted with this intriguing creature they called their son. On tiptoes they sneaked past a sleeping, snoring Cas, walked down the stairs to the living room.
"If you want to shower, there are airtight bags in the bathroom for your cast and some medical tape. Don't worry, the next session this afternoon won't be that arduous, we'll mostly focus on stretching exercises. I'll pick you up close to 5 o'clock."
Dean rubbed his back up and down, with his thumb he drew little circles on Jack’s T-shirt, felt the tension slowly leaving the boy’s body. His heart leapt into his throat when Jack sighed and leaned against his side trustfully. His small head bumped against Dean’s torso. He allowed that Dean slung an arm around his middle and gave him physical comfort.
"Any idea how to kill that son of a bitch? Did the devil worshippers spill something out online?" he asked, distracting his attention from his own guilt-laden mind. Sam clicked his tongue and shook his head.
He choked on his own breath, his chest quavering at the intense senses, aware of every of Dean's torturing caresses. His inner voice begged him to make Dean stop, as much as his body screamed for more, for an infinite continuation of this. Castiel frowned, torn between pleasure and unrest, and still his hips rocked into Dean's tight palm affirmatively. Soon it was over, ending as passionate and manically as it had started. Castiel bit his bottom lip, hearing himself moan loudly when he came into Dean's fist, rivers of hot cum throbbing out of his dick in distant intervals.
"Dean."
to come here asap. Your brother is
“Hey, buddy. I’m parked in front of your apartment. You need to come down and join me for a ride. I wanna show you something, something important,” he explained secretively, a broad smile on his mouth. He couldn’t keep the excitement out of his voice, nor the breathlessness. Castiel didn’t sound amused. He often used the early evenings to prepare for another day at court, reading tons of statements and counter statements. Apparently, he really, really liked his job and all this cryptic writing of lawyers. Now that Dean knew him for over two years, he had gotten to see plenty of this side of Cas, and even though it was kind of cute, it was also somewhat intimidating how focussed Castiel always was when he lost himself in mountains of paper. His concentration seemed endless, his attention always there, when he thumbed through the pages with a frown, muttering and taking notes. Dean had learned that Castiel didn’t like to be interrupted or distracted when he read. But today was an exception. An important one.
As if on cue, the moment they were done, Ellen and Jo showed up, bringing a bottle of whiskey and a bowl of salad. Their reunion was mirthful and they were all hugging in turns, laughing happily. Dean eyed Ellen thoroughly, recognizing she had a few more wrinkles around her eyes, but she seemed as brisk as ever. Jo looked less childlike nowadays, and her clothing style was more mature, and Dean was certain he knew what the diamond ring around her finger meant. They were all blathering and making themselves comfortable, when Castiel walked in on them, standing confused in the yard. Their loud voices and their laughter must have lured him to join them. Dean looked at him, feeling his heart skipping a beat. He looked stunning tonight, breathtaking.
"We are weaned from our timidity / in the flush of love's light / we dare to be brave / and suddenly we see / that love costs all we are / and will ever be. / Yet it is only love / which sets us free"; it made Dean feel a horrendous ache for something he had forbidden himself a long, long time ago. A desire pounded within him to have what he hadn't had in all these years, a stable relationship, intimacy, which lasted longer than a single night, longer than a few weeks. Togetherness. He had always thought he couldn't have such a thing, as well as he couldn't have a normal, boring, safe life. So why did it bother him so badly that he couldn't satisfy his heart's wishes when it came to this matter? Why couldn't he stop thinking about Cas, why didn't the daydreams about an unattainable future with him end?
"Hi, Sammy. Yeah, we're alright. The exorcism worked... Sorry I didn't call you earlier, been a little occupied," Dean answered, trying to talk quietly in order not to awake Castiel. Sam scoffed.
“What? Got some food in my beard or why you’re looking at me like that?”
Dean put on his most charming smile and grinned cockily at Sam. Sam got up and let out a laugh, then he pushed Dean's head to the side playfully and walked to the door.
The ride to the diner Castiel had in mind didn't take longer than ten minutes, and Dean turned up the volume of the car radio quite naturally – again loud rock music was booming through the small car and Castiel had winded down both windows of the Toyota. Pleasant cool wind was combing through their hair, played with the hems of their light shirts and Castiel was sure this was how flying felt like. He felt weightless, incredibly at ease, while they sped down the empty road, and whenever Dean grinned impishly at him or regarded him with a thoughtful tender side glance, Castiel thought wings were growing on his back. Once they stopped at a red light and Castiel actually shut his lids to savor the vivid sensations vibrating through his edgy body. He heard his heart throb loudly within his ears, and he felt Dean's body radiate heat so close next to him, while some old classic rock music played vigorously in the car. Castiel smiled to himself – the moment didn't last longer than a few seconds, but he felt so alive, so joyous, that he feared he would be bursting with senses overflowing him.
After dinner, Castiel announced he was going out for a walk, and this seemed to become a habit with him. Dean offered to join him, but Castiel declined politely but decisively, saying he rather wanted to be alone. With a heavy heart, Dean watched him putting on his beige trenchcoat and his shoes, while Dean and Bobby still sat at the kitchen table and drank a beer. They were going to play poker tonight, and Dean was looking forward to it. Bobby was a good sport and playing cards with him was always fun. But when Dean’s eyes rested on Castiel’s concentrated features as he laced up his shoes, Dean couldn’t help but feel down somewhat. He felt so far away from Castiel, that the other man was so detached from him and getting farther and farther away – and Dean wanted to be close to him, he longed to know what was going on inside of Castiel’s head…
Aaron.”
„First, I have to give myself plenty of liquid courage,” he announced. Jo rolled his eyes at him and got up.
THE END
Castiel scoffed a laugh and shrugged off the question, but a helpless, confused look remained in his deep blue eyes. He held up the little piece of paper he was holding in his hands as if this gave any explanation to Dean’s question.
A humorless, bitter chuckle escaped Dean as the thought crossed his mind that he had cheated death and life imprisonment – only to be greeted with a disaster like this. Then the tears were streaming down his cheeks abundantly. He couldn’t contain the quiet sobs which were threatening to break his ribs, they were so intense, shaking his body. Without end, he kneaded Castiel’s hand, held onto it as if this might bring him back. Dean’s whole world was coming apart at the seams, darkness rained down on him, swallowing him.
"Dean... I don't want be the asshole here, but you know I told you to stay away from him, didn't I?"
to do just that? Of course it was inappropriate to snoop around in other people's stuff, but Dean wanted to see and know everything about this man – and now he had his permission! His fingers were already itching with anticipation. He tried real hard to hide his excitement, as he nodded and as he said a casual, "yeah, okay." A grin, along with a terrible blush, spread over Dean's face the moment he turned around and began limping through Castiel's apartment with his crutches. He could walk quite decently with those damn crutches by now, but he still lacked the finesse, and he was a bit clumsy as he had a close look at Castiel's living room.
Dean listened attentively, munching his dinner.
Please let me know what you think!
Jealousy clouded his thinking, he bit on his bottom lip, half angry, half depressed. Was Castiel already moving on? Had Dean meant so little to him that he had no qualms about poaching the next person? Dean felt cheap and disgusted. He didn't know who he hated more – Castiel or himself. He shook his head disappointedly and left without being noticed by anyone. He retreated to the known, lonely confines of his room and kept reading his brought novels while lying on his bed. Sam called him and they perused several ideas coming to their heads, they even talked about a few guys John had known as possible recruits for their plan – but in the end, they had decided to determine their plan tomorrow. Dean was tired and a nervous wreck, his mind was too fogged to think clearly. He fell asleep after lunch and was woken by Janet with a soft smile and sympathetic eyes. He struggled out of bed and followed her to their next training session for this day.
A few minutes later, they lay collected and comfortably beside each other on the narrow bed. Castiel lay in Dean's arm, and the calloused fingertips of this arm stroked over Castiel's smooth shoulder tenderly, drawing idle and insignificant patterns. They both lay on their backs and stared at the ceiling pensively – its white hue changed gradually into a dim, ashen color as the night found its way into the silent room. It was most appreciated to feel Castiel's warmth and his naked body pressing against his side again, Dean thought, and he savored the moment inwardly. Only blurry thoughts crossed his mind, that they may have made a mistake, getting involved with the other again... but it had felt so right, so good... And right now, Dean still felt no guilt pangs. For the first time in days he felt peaceful and satisfied; nothing seemed that severe or insoluble when Castiel was around him.
