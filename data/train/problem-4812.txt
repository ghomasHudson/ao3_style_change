Behind him, Sam’s forehead wrinkles with concern, and he’s probably considering leaving Dean to his monosyllabic LifeTime Original angsting. Dean certainly wouldn’t blame him.
“Oh,” Sam utters, turning back around, surprised, but not displeased at all, “Yeah, anything, man. What’s up?”
Castiel’s eyes move under his lids for a moment like he’s searching, or dreaming, but then they’re wide open, and he’s shuddering a breath, “no - no. I don’t want to do this anymore.”
There’s nothing but resolve in his eyes when Future Dean replies, “yes.”
“You don’t have to patronize me, Dean. Before absinthe, before opioids, before benzo’s, what I had was you. One more hit, and I’ll die clean. I swear.”
“We -
In the blanket of darkness that’s settled over the graveyard, Dean can still see clearly, because Cas’ eyes are high beams cutting through the fog of the night.
With a just-audible intake, Cas’ back straightens - there’s something about the way he holds himself from head to toe that just shifts, and he’s Castiel again, Angel of the Lord, Messenger of God - a warrior of Heaven. Not to be fucked with, and not to be brushed aside - no fuckin’ burn-out either.
At the suggestive mention of ‘women,’ Castiel appears visibly uncomfortable, and Dean’s Older Brother Teasing Instinct kicks in.
Clearing his throat, Dean shakes his head to cut through the static, and his mouth wants to make words happen, but it’s like a limb that’s fallen asleep.
“How is it that you came to learn it?”
“Cas…”
time since I've laughed that hard.”
No person Dean has ever known “biblically,” has ever felt like such a fever against him.
"Dean," Castiel moans.
She looks like she might be near crying when she storms past Dean, and he’d sincerely feel sorry about that if she didn’t needlessly curse him on her way out.
Dean doesn’t see a way of winning the argument, so he kicks dirt into Sam’s hair, and leaves him to finish burying.
There’s a magic-laced bullet, an arcane spell, or a rune-carved blade, or his hands - his useless fucking hands should be capable of so much more than trembling - there has to be a loophole somewhere, because there always is, there has to be a way to make all of this stop -
It's not fair that John, even in absence, could still be one of the meanest fuckers Dean's ever had to fear.
“Thanks, Cas!” Dean grins sarcastically at him, turning out onto the main road.
While he’s been aimlessly wandering the Earth, sleep deprived, he sometimes catches past conversations still floating in the air of the war room, and if he checks the kitchen during those late hours, he can sense someone trying and failing to respect his personal space. Like a nosy friend, peering into his mug from over his shoulder, or staring longingly at the counter where Dean spreads jam and peanut butter on bread at two in the morning.
“I don’t know what the fuck happened in the last five years to change my mind, but yeah, I actually prefer the opinion of the stoner I trust over a torturer and murderer I barely recognize,
“You don’t like it anymore, but it used to be routine.”
Still confused, thunder claps overhead, and Castiel asks, “what do humans scream? What am I meant to scream to get it out?”
Sapphire eyes going glassy, Castiel breathes out a wet, aborted type of exhale, and he then holds his forehead with one shaky hand that’s shifting between a crystal formation and a normal flesh-and-blood hand, while the other covers his heart. There are vines sprouting from between the fingers of that hand, and they turn quickly into flowers, die, shrivel, and fall off, disappearing from existence before even touching the grass, and he pants out, “I am in love with Dean!”
Not a sentence anyone would care to hear, Sam figures, but especially on such short notice.
The electrified wind is whirling around them, Sam imagines that Castiel’s effect on electricity and lightning can’t be helping the matter either with his power so out of control; Castiel’s eyes have gone very glassy, and he’s gripping his hair now at the scalp, with both hands, further mussing it.
“No,” Dean rejects, shaking his head, his hands grasping at the baggy sides of Cas’ shirt, “That’s not me. I don’t - I don’t know who that jackass is, but that’s not me. I won’t let it be. I won’t let any of this - I won’t let it happen.”
“Is there a particular ritual involved?”
"I know, I get it."
“What the fuck do you want me to do about it? He’s a grown fuckin’ man,” Dean’s counterpart argues, “I made my shit decisions, and he made his. I don’t
God, he’s just furious, he’s furious with himself, though - he promised Cas that he’d save him, and Cas -
They’re both panting, Dean’s pretty certain that a resting heart rate isn’t meant to feel like this, and Cas is looking positively
“They’re dead, and their blood’s on his hands!” Dean’s counterpart shouts, jaw wired with tension, arms moving in sharp, deliberate cutting motions through the air, “I gave him everything! Whatever he wanted! As long as I fuckin’ could, til I was fresh outta every-fuckin’-thing! I asked him one thing, I gave him just the one fuckin’ thing to do - Hell or high water, Ben be kept safe, I didn’t care what or who it cost, and he - you know what?”
“Yeah…” Dean clears his throat, but whatever frog is lodged there just settles in.
,' noise, rolling his hips into Dean’s harshly, “With
“Nuh-unh,” Dean answers, shaking his head and putting his drink down on a nearby table, “That’s - that was a travesty, what I just witnessed. Babes are fuckin’ wasted on you, Cas.”
Eventually, Sam turns to Dean, and says, “you should step in, man.”
"Dean, Karina is -"
He decides to keep reminding himself of that;
With difficulty, Castiel looks back into Dean’s eyes, and Dean feels his heart thud in his ears. He wonders to himself if Cas can hear it, or feel it, but all Cas does is stare intently back at him, maybe waiting for Dean to confirm or deny something.
"Dean, you can still -"
Before Dean can further fuck up this interaction, Jody calls for Claire, and when Dean and she leave the room, Jody hustles them both back outside, where Garth and some of his buddies are getting ready to set off fireworks against the purple sky; it's not even ten yet, but a bonfire is started too.
They stare at each other for a few silent beats in which Castiel seems to release a massive, invisible weight from his shoulders, and Sam thinks that being loved by an Angel of the Lord sounds, while poetic, immensely dangerous, and then Dean's voice comes, tinny and crackling with static; "Sam. Keep him there."
“When I rescued you, Dean, I branded you with divinity,” Castiel explains, crouching so they’re at eye-level with one another again, “Your very DNA carries the last vestiges of my Grace in it.”
“Yeah, I was there,” Dean jokes, smirking proudly down at Cas; “Don’t worry, when you get to be a seasoned pro like me, you can snazzy up your waltz too. Maybe next you can learn to salsa or tango.”
He keeps the tempo slow, but incorporates making circles, turning them ‘round and ‘round the stone and marble balcony, up and down it’s length; Cas follows him easily, trusting Dean’s direction, and always operating on a similar wavelength - Dean thinks that maybe they dance together well because they fight together well.
As soon as they both hit the ground, Dean wastes no time, well aware that he's bleeding out quickly in the grass, he drops his location to Sam's phone, but still copies his exact coordinates to send him in text - just in case.
Tilting his head curiously as he so often does, Castiel answers him; "no."
“You stun me, Dean…”
Sam knows somehow, anyway. He knows something more happened, that something profound and deeply fucked up happened, but all he knows for certain is all Dean will say, which is limited to, “doesn’t matter. It won’t be us,” and “stop fucking asking me about it.”
“Cas…” is all he can manage.
What is Dean supposed to do, when around every corner, Cas has left an impression of himself?
His soul is left out in the elements now, bare, exposed, spilling from a wound that will never stop bleeding, all mangled sinew stuck in the teeth of something cold and hollow.
, Dean inwardly corrects, watching them stare each other down.
Dean is glad Claire poked fun at Cas - that prissy Angel acted like he was wounded by a little ribbing, but he was a snarky bitch too, and Dean only wishes he could make fun of Cas now.
Dean looks down at his glowing chest and touches at it, as if he’ll feel an opening labeled 'angelic deposits,' there.
Hesitating, a single tear slips down Sam's cheek, and he inquires very quietly, "... did you... I mean, I know you loved Cas, but did you -"
Dean takes no pleasure in Cas ever being scared, so he reaches out, takes a step back into Cas’ space, but that spooks him more, and in less than a blink of an eye, he’s gone.
,” he gestures sharply, “He’s gonna just - walk right up to death to buy you time, and you’re gonna let your last conversation end like that? After seeing what it did to Sam after Dad died? Seriously?”
Dean tries to snatch the phone back, glaring at Sam, but Sam keeps it out of reach, and kicks at Dean to keep him at a distance.
"But, Dean -"
Smirking, though falling short of any real joy, trying to joke a little, Sam asks rhetorically, “it’s that bad being in love with Dean, huh?”
"Dean? Does Claire know?"
“Yeah, well, you should,” is all he chooses to say at the moment, though.
think Sam said yes?”
How can he step foot in a Church ever again? How is he meant to ever pray again? To ever have faith again?
“Even if - which I don’t - I’m not - listen, though, okay? I’m not, and I don’t want that - not that there’s anything wrong with it, or something, just - even if that were the case, Cas isn’t like that. He’s not a being that experiences shit like that -”
“Good boy.”
Considering him, Castiel tilts his head by an inch, maybe, and then observes, “you are offering to reciprocate my repeated and ongoing efforts to put you at ease.”
Swallowing roughly, feeling possibly feverish, Dean down, then away, “… you gotta stop saying shit like that, Cas.”
“You’re not,” Cas answers shamelessly, “You will not deny me. Not this.”
“Nah, it’s fine, man. You’ve got it,” Dean assures him, “Now that you know how to, you gonna ask that girl to dance?”
Embarrassed, his eyes flicker away again, and he crosses his wrists over the small of his back, “I find - I find that I am a stranger to my own happiness, Sam. I... I am so far removed from it that it is hardly mine at all. Dean is, to my eyes, a soft and warm star encased in a thin membrane of glass, I only want to protect him, but he shines on me without fear, or demand, even when he nears supernova, even when he flares, he warms me. My happiness is so foreign to me, I can only feel it as it refracts through him, and warms me from some other side of being.”
“You are not paid to hunt, though,” Castiel reminds him, “Your body is more donated than sold to the purpose of hunting.”
“Okay,” Sam responds; he doesn’t think his meditation app will be available at whatever altitude they are, doubts it would help Cas anyway, instructing him through a tapping exercise would be impossible with such limited ability to hear one another, and box-breathing may take too long to explain before Cas loses patience and ejects himself from his body or something, “do you know - uhm, war cries? Or something?”
Dean keeps thinking to himself that he wants rid of it all, to go live anywhere but the bunker, start fresh somewhere new, but then the realization that he would lose this - fucking shrine, or whatever, that he’s made of the bunker - it’s a hot brand to tender skin. He's as stuck as a ghost.
starts up, and he checks his left hand - he's pleased to find the ring still on him. He wonders to himself if Jack noticed.
“What? Dude,” Dean laughs, self-deprecating, starting the car, “First of all, I’m not self-aware at all, I feel like most of the time I’m barely aware of like - anything, okay? And who I am? That’s none of my business.”
the Righteous Man, I saved him - despite Hell's best efforts, their most cunning commanders, their most vicious monsters, despite the blood spilled, despite how many and how much we lost, and as Dean and I neared the physical world's wavelengths again, so near the surface, I put back together his soul and his body, navigating the cities of grief in him, their crumbled temples, the soft breathing beasts cradled there that he had somehow kept alive through the evil he had been witness and victim to..."
He's glad Sam is happy, he really is, it's just difficult to reconcile that gladness with the enormous awfulness that's sucking the life out of everything else.
If he ever did, he must’ve been a young teenager for it, and the orgasm itself must've been pretty run-of-the-mill as far as intensity goes.
- though that may have been influenced by your impressions of the characters.”
Jody is still adjusting the steering wheel when he pulls the cassette out of his pocket, and reads in neat sharpie;
Steeling himself, Dean nods, and leans in toward the middle of the front seat bench; “if you do live, though - this never happened, alright?”
“No,” Dean rejects the news outright, “No - why would he do that? He wouldn’t do that.”
Castiel cared for him too much to listen to shit like that.
Sliding more into the middle of the seat bench, Dean discreetly wipes the sweat of his palms off onto his jeans, and silently directs Castiel onto his lap with a double-tap to the tense, outer muscle of his thigh.
“Wow,” he says encouragingly, “Is that kismet or what, buddy? Well, he likes you, you like him, so dayenu.”
“Devil-may-care, even,” Cas jokes darkly.
Dean looks up, ready to argue, but Cas looks absolutely ruined.
Dean's breath catches when Castiel pushes his head back down, but he goes eagerly - emboldened, fierce - Castiel's rough hands and long, dexterous fingers are holding his face, cradling him almost with a tenderness in high contrast with the tension pulling his body taut.
“Why are you only telling me this now?”
Ten minutes of solitary marching finds Dean across the campus near cars he would’ve thought were defunct if they weren’t packed up, looking ready for deployment.
"That's not fair, Dean - you've never told me what happened in there - what did you say? Did you -"
to me, to watch you get hurt, and have no way of

“What makes you think
“All -” Castiel clears his throat, still barely able to respond, “You’ve always - Dean, I cannot take from you what -”
“I never -” Cas decides that venture is futile, and so looks back at Dean, “Sam and you were always better and stronger together, as a team,” Cas insists, stepping up closer, “Whenever you two were divided, Sam in particular was weaker to outside influence, and Lucifer could woo loyalty from stone with his silver tongue - Sam had no hope on his own. Even on his best day, I think in Sam’s loneliness, his despair, and desperation, he did all he could think of to do, misinformed, misdirected, and without your -”
“Stop choosing me then, Cas!” he grinds out between clenched teeth.
“Is that why you engage sexually with others?”
Sometimes Dean can forget how much vast knowledge Cas had to offer; he should have asked more questions.
“Are you gonna seriously let him walk out like that?”
Nearby the sigil, there's a table not unlike a gift-table at a wedding, but there are bundles of incense, bottles of holy water, white sage burning out of marble bowls, jars full of black feathers, other glass jars full of honey with the honeycomb still floating around in them, and golden singing bowls being played by a very Joplin-looking woman that Dean has yet to meet.
sits below that, below that, قرآن كريم , then
“Yeah, man,” Dean answers simply, “I wouldn’t know where to find ‘em, honestly, but I know they’ve got establishments too.”
The closest thing he can remember is how it felt to be hugged by his mother - that it is a similar, though still very different warmth that is traded between them. It’s something to do with the ease with which it comes; it was easy to hug his mother, she took care of him, protected him, was always kind, and soft, and her love for him was instinctive, and powerful.
Purgatory was petrifying, and Castiel chose to stay, to repent, and he must have cried. He must have shaken, he must have ached in his heart the way humans do, and Dean -
“Why?” he wonders, “It’s only the truth.”
“Combustion is imminent.”
to be defensive about! And I’ll prove it!”
It’s not a lie - it’s just not the truth this Castiel needs.

of pleasure the friction causes Castiel to make.
It really doesn’t do much.
“Yeah, well, maybe the world wouldn’t be such shit if more humans were a little more liberal with who they offered to protect.”
“Start a fire?” Cas asks disbelievingly back.
He’s a little surprised that Cas knows what he’s referring to.
He hesitates, unsure of whether he’s been led, half-cocked, on a leash to some warped conclusion; he’s considering backing out and away from the confrontation altogether - but Cas can see something in his expression, and the air changes.
“Human connection can only go so far as the epidermis allows,” Castiel tells him, spreading his fingers so that he’s palm-to-palm with the scar of his own handprint, “but that is not the case for you and I.”
It’s weird - watching himself want something so bad, that’s so readily available if he just stopped doing whatever song and dance here he’s insisting on.
Panicked, Dean scrambles out of the car, and he watches warily as Cas exits the other side.

“No - sorry. Sorry. I misspoke. I shouldn’t - I didn’t mean -”
“I will not share love with you in a place you’ve laid with someone like Anna.”
When he’s back in his own time, freshly wounded inside and out, begging Castiel to never change - his trip to the future seems like a distant nightmare, and he wants to keep it that way.
A group of vagrants find their way to the vigil, saying that they know Castiel by the name 'Steve,' and how he was a good friend, if a little bit odd, explaining that Cas lived with them at their makeshift camp for a long while; one man looks at Dean very sadly, and says, "never asked for nothin', spent every mornin' just tellin' us how glorious the new day would be. I'd wondered what happened to 'im."
“May I ask a favor of you, Dean?”
Sam thinks he can actually
. I like how you smell.”
“You wanna ask the burn-out for his genius input?”
But he's got Baby here, and there's everywhere to go, he's got nothing but time, so he climbs in, and takes a winding country road; and when he hits 'play,' on the dashboard,
“... it’s something I know I can’t have.”
Nodding sleepily, Castiel lolls his head back and to the side to better see him, and utters, “my one and my only.”
Dean carries the memories of his time in the alternate future by himself - he doesn’t talk about it, but that’s because he really doesn’t want to acknowledge what he saw.
The expression on Sam's face is a cross of anger, frustration, grief, obstinacy, and heavy, heavy sympathy.
," Castiel recites, "
He pulls away long enough to see fat tears falling from the corners of Cas' eyes, and he nods, his hands pushing into Dean's jacket, so he can press his palms against Dean's back, over his henley, and his voice is a little weak when he says, "there is nothing to forgive."
Castiel turns his head to stare at Dean’s profile, but Dean only glances at him quickly through his periphery before returning his attention to the road.
“I don't know,” Castiel answers, eyes moving from where Chastity has disappeared into the bar, back to Dean, “There was an energy affecting her soul, and I meant to soothe her. I picked up on several memories floating at the surface of her mind, and I was able to tell her that it wasn't her fault that her father Gene ran off when she was young. It never could have been her fault. He never hated her, he just hated his job at the post office.”
“You’re gonna yell it out!” Sam interjects quickly, “You’re gonna pick something to scream, and you’re gonna inhale all your fear, and then you’re gonna scream it out!”
“Well, don’t let me stand in the way of you watching others play with themselves instead.”
, Dean grits his teeth,
“Brash,” Risa offers, crossing her arms more tightly over her chest, and adding resentfully in a way that is very apparently regarding something else, “Thoughtless.”
“No - not - okay, just - think abstractly,” Sam redirects, “What
Tears spill down Dean’s face, and he’s not even self-conscious about it.
They just stare at each other across Baby's roof.
Dean’s not been this dressed up since Bela stuffed him in a monkey suit, and he’d wager the same applies to Sam, but this is certainly the first either of them have ever seen Cas in anything other than his cubicle-life uniform.
"He was my best friend too, and I wanna be able to - to mourn him, you know?"
“Eh, you’d be surprised what you learn on the job,” Dean replies easily, pulling away enough to spin Cas, and then move close in again.
Sam isn't there when Dean dies.
“Christ, Cas,” Dean swears, trying to politely move his too-warm face out of view.
it -"
“Look around you, man! Half the planet's better than no planet, which is what we have now!” Future Dean shouts, “If I could do it over again, I'd say 'yes,' in a heartbeat.”
When that Cas was marching into his death without hesitation, Dean respected him, wanted to save him - but now that his own Castiel was headed to the gallows, all he could feel was anger?
, yeah,” Dean encourages breathily, pulling Castiel forward and down again.
"It's a lot, out there," Claire commiserates, looking as if she thinks Dean might be angry with her, "I didn't expect so many people to have met him. The Facebook page is insane, Dean - he was all over the world, like, all the time, preforming miracles and shit - everywhere, for like, everyone."
“How bad you wanna a hook to the jaw?”
“Very well. Where do we begin?”
Baby’s windows are lowered enough to let in the velvety night air of the summer nights on the East Coast, and everything smells like tall grass and stormless sky; as Castiel shuts his eyes, Dean leans over the radio and lets
Dean's throat clicks on a rough swallow, and Castiel turns to face him.
Dean’s chest is too tight.
"Cas, I have a guitar you can use -"
It's not said to patronize him, they only mean to distinguish Cas from all other possible sightings; "bitch had me by the throat, and I blink, and there's Dean's Angel! He put his hand on 'er head, and -
- it is the color red, Sam."
Pulling away with a scratchy gasp, Dean throws his head back, hands flying to Castiel’s waist, and he full-body shivers at the low, undeniably masculine
“I -”
Dean stops interacting with newcomers after a seven year old girl tells him that "I got carried away by the ocean at the beach, and Mister Castle came, and he carried me back to my mom, and gave her a hug when she wouldn't stop crying, which was silly because I was fine."
"I know just the place."
One wide hand insinuates itself under the hem of Dean’s weathered flannel, calloused fingers pressing into his left hip possessively while the other hand glides over his pec, and shoulder to the back of his neck, pinky finger teasing the sensitive skin just under the back of his cotton collar, and thumb brushing the fine hairs at the base of Dean’s skull.
What sounds like hundreds of cherry bombs going off has them stumbling away from each other, and frantically looking about.
Sniffing, Sam glances off, then nods, and answers, "yeah. I mean - no, obviously, but yeah. I didn't know missing him was gonna be like this, is all. I keep expecting him to turn up somehow, or for someone to just pop up, wanting to make a fucked up deal to get him back, but... it's like the whole world went quiet when he left, or something. Like the whole universe shut up."
‘going on,’ I just think you should, hypothetically go for something rather than settling for the nothing, because, personally, I think there
“Dean,” Cas greets, casual, if a little subdued; his eyes are clearer than before.
“I regret nothing.”
Baby crawls into the field, stopping just a split second before Jody actually hits the brake; it's fine, though, because Dean's pretty certain she didn't notice.
“You gotta stop glancing down,” Dean commands.
"That's what made him happy. Like, real, genuine, megawatt smile, crying outta gladness type happy - loving me. Even if I didn't return the feelings. He said I was the only thing in all of creation he'd ever wanted, and I was the one thing he couldn't have. So, he loved me anyway, and it made him happy because he said I - he said I was a good man to love."
Dean invites himself into the lazy, wide part of Castiel's legs and kisses him soundly, silently agreeing, but also wondering where in the Hell Castiel draws the line on blasphemy.
“Be careful, please,” is said through the driver’s side window as Dean reluctantly buckles himself in, “You are the most precious cargo, Dean. You are my one and my only.”

He turns his ring over a few times, twisting it around and around, watching how it gleams in the dim kitchen lights.

Wide-eyed, Cas trips on his own feet trying to back away; Dean covers the steps until Cas’ ass has hit the edge of the truck bed again.
"Video?" he rasps, having not used his voice in hours.
- like kissing is an act of carnage just as much as an act of love, like those things aren’t mutually exclusive.
Third; he’s going to miss Castiel. He’s going to miss Castiel a lot, no matter how he tries to rationalize the feeling away.
Or, maybe it's just that Castiel made him feel young, and he's coming to the realization that he's old and lonely.
“Do I?”
“And how might I summon lightning, Dean?”
Dean finds that his throat has gone very tight around his rapid heart rate, when impulsively, and instinctively, he responds earnestly, "... you wanna be?"
“I-I’m in love with Dean! “ Castiel says again, his voice duplicating itself, sounding like a gospel choir all around them, but somehow also only inside Sam’s head; Castiel’s body and face only growing more and more panicked by the admission, manifestations of miracles keep moving through his body, shifting gears at a worrying rate, “I am in love with Dean! I’m in love with him! I feel
Missing Castiel is going to be a wound that bleeds all day long, for every day left of his life.
Nodding uselessly, with his eyes transfixed on Castiel’s mouth, Dean tells him, “yeah - yeah, okay. Take off your coat, alright?”
If a haunting could kiss, Dean thinks this is what it would feel like.
- “What kind of deal?”
It takes Dean a full minute to brave stepping through the threshold, and when he does, he feels flooded by memory - inconsequential shit, things said in passing, Castiel being human and yawning widely enough that his jaw audibly popped, he and Cas pacing around the war room while Sam grimaced at his laptop, Cas worrying over Dean and Sam as they competed to find the most convoluted or dangerous way to spring the cap off a beer bottle, the sound of his feathers ruffling from some other plane, handing an ethereal entity a plastic, stupid fucking mixtape while fully believing that entity wouldn't know how to listen to it.
Dean thinks he hears one of the buttons pop off with the strain of his hold, but neither of them seem inclined to do anything about it, so he figures it doesn’t matter; he tries to establish himself as a bit more dominant, thrown off his usual groove by the absolutely
happen," Dean recites, his face too warm, his body trembling, "And - sometimes - they happen to me."
Castiel’s knees nearly give out, he gasps loudly and his hands fly to Dean’s hair as his back curls forward from the door as if he's been punched in the gut; there was cum still on him from making out in the front seat, and Dean’s not squeamish, but not interested in what cooling cum tastes like either, so he manages to haphazardly clean it off with his own spit and tight fist.
"As removed from society as you can get around here."
Something burns bright in his middle, pulling up toward his head without hurting somehow, then lightning strikes around them, setting several small fires on dry grass that catches too quickly, and the glass of all the car windows, mirrors, and lights blow out.
The scraping of their scruff as they kiss, and the increasingly labored breaths they’re both making are the only noises in the Impala.
How is he supposed to watch crows and ravens fly without wondering if Castiel's wings were anything like theirs?
"No," Claire laughs, "But also, Cas wouldn't have understood Dean's, like,
the overdriven heart beating close against the skin Castiel has left exposed. It looks like a type of muscle cramp, but more dangerous, and lower than he thought hearts sat in the chest.
"Yes," Castiel answers, pupils going wide and dark as he stares into Dean's eyes, "Yes, I think I'd like that very much."
yūgen (Japanese): a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe, and the sad, nebulous beauty of human suffering.
"He's not coming back," Dean mumbles roughly to Baby.
He leaves off, pulling a despairing whimper from Castiel's broad lips.
“Did he tell you what happened?”
Dean struggles with the frog in his throat for a moment, while realization seems to finally come over Sam's features.
Castiel comes down his throat, gasping low, husky, with his nimble fingers woven in Dean's hair and knees beginning to buckle, and Dean is so stupid with endorphins, he hardly registers it.
“Probably should,” Dean warns, dropping Castiel’s wrist so he can further loosen Castiel’s tie and pull open the rest of his shirt.
There's more drool in Dean's mouth than can be contained; his chin is wet, and Castiel's cock is sliding down easy now, just getting stiffer, and hotter, and slicker, and it's appealing to Dean in a way that hooks deep in his abdomen and keeps tugging him closer to coming in his jeans again.
She's not exactly wrong, so Dean doesn't bother taking offense.
"Ew, no, he was like... Cas was like my deeply uncool, adopted older brother. No, I was helping
Picking his arms up out of the draining water, he splays his wet hands across the counter, his shoulders hitching up closer to his ears.
) “When I experienced a moment of true happiness, The Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever.”
Sometimes his body doesn’t feel like it belongs to him anymore - like how his feet won’t move despite him telling them to bring him forward, and his arms won’t move despite him telling them to work long enough to open the door, and step into the room.
“So, you’re not displeased with me?” Castiel tries to confirm.
Mentions of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Jody and he ride in companionable silence, he stares out the window, bites the cuticle of his thumb until he's ripping the skin, wonders if Cas actually understood how romantic the songs are, and he thinks about what the fuck he'd put on his tape to Cas, and how fucking stupid, and obvious it was, and how much of an idiot he's been.
His big shoulders slump, his half-smirk falls, and he reaches out for Castiel again, encouraged in that the Angel doesn’t move away this time, “Cas, that’s not true - being loved isn’t a bad thing, even if it’s not - even if he doesn’t - just - he wouldn’t be mad at you, or anything like that -”
,” Dean complains, half-imagining being able to move Castiel around, get on top of him, give them both more.
“You ‘n me?” Dean specifies, pointing between the two of them, “Sharing a bed, like -”

The guy isn't even fully undressed.
!" Dean rushes, some popping-zipping energy running through him from scalp to sole, buzzing and cleansing, "God -
that same voice asks.
“No, Heaven went away from Earth,” Cas specifies, “All others will be Delivered, it will just be very, very far from here.”
Dean’s face flushes dark.
“Is this a good idea?” he inquires, scrutinizing Dean’s face, “Is this - I mean, is it gonna make you worse?”
He can feel on his face how the devastation is writ across it, how his eyes burn still, how his throat is still a vice, and how his heart is somewhere behind his stomach, low in his body.
Castiel's fingertips press in on the scar just barely, and that - it does
Mentions of Drug Use
of Dean - but more than all of those reasons, the thought that he would misunderstand me simply because the words don’t exist…”
“Out,” Dean grits, head pulsating with dizzying waves of blood, “Get out of the car.”
“Because it is.”
Castiel slants his mouth at Sam, and Sam smiles gently back at him, “I know it doesn’t sound like fun, but, honestly? It’s a good skill to have, and worst case scenario is that you brighten someone’s evening.”
Tilting his head curiously, Castiel needlessly replies, “yes, Dean, of course.”
again, and now he can't play Clue again, even though he doesn't even remember the last time he played it, and he's unlikely to ever have the desire to play it again, but he's
"What?"
Oral sex is something Dean is very proficient in, but he's never dealt with something other than a vulva - he knew giving head to a dick was called a 'job,' for a reason, but the pain in his mandible and the focus required to keep breathing evenly isn't as off-putting as he feared it may be. Dean's always liked work he has to really put his back into, and this - this is suiting him. It's suiting him better than he thinks he may ever be able to admit, even to himself.
With a noise that's a cross of pain, shock, and pleasure, Castiel jumps again, his wide hands splaying over the top and back of Dean’s head, pushing Dean against him while pressing himself more in.
He hugs Cas close, and kisses him soundly - besides the kiss over all feeling decidedly masculine in an unfamiliar way (musk, stubble, untreated skin -), Cas’ lips are a little dry (no lipstick, no gloss, no perfume -), it makes for a nice pulling sensation, though, dragging him in closer (made for him, made for him, made for him -) - he breaks for air, and to switch the angle of his head, “I’m not givin’ up on you,” he manages.
He doesn’t know what to do if Castiel cries - he feels woefully ill-equipped for that possibility.
,” Sam laughs unabashedly, looking mischievously at Cas, “You wanna
He thinks to himself that he can lie. He can just - circumvent this conversation the way he has for roughly four years now, but he knows it won't work. Not really.
“Fuck you too!”
In a world full of so much dark, and bad, Castiel has been this unrelenting light, full of child-like wonderment, silly ineptitudes, fondness for Dean that he’s convinced he’s never deserved, but wants to keep all the same. He’s filled some role in Dean’s life that Dean hadn’t even noticed was there to fill.
Dean almost immediately regrets telling Sam; Sam's eyes are round, and swimming, and the center of his face is red where he's clearly trying to hold back tears.
The hand he’s got on Castiel’s waist grips more tightly, and the one around the length of Castiel’s tie freezes in a white-knuckled clasp.
When Castiel doesn’t move, and just continues looking like a victim of Medusa, Dean bullies him good-naturedly, “don’t make me push you.”
Dean's Internalized Homophobia, Dean's Self Esteem Issues
“I’d not stop you from this,” Castiel admits on a breath, “Not you.”
How is he supposed to get himself bad coffee and menthols when he stops for gas?
The pained look in Castiel’s eyes as he smiles sadly again makes Dean’s chest ache.
“You? Are you about to ask if my love for you is shared with yourself of another time? Are you seriously jealous of yourself?”
Castiel has a panic attack in the opening half of the chapter.
The alternative has always meant that Castiel does cry, and when he does, he does it away from Dean, he does it in secrecy, like an injured animal hiding their splintered joint. The alternative meant that he felt deeply, all things, that when he felt fear, that he protected Dean from it. That when he felt rage, or gladness, or mourning, that he shielded Dean from it - or shielded himself from Dean.
Implied Sexual Content (within a flashback)
Billowing out a breath, Cas slips down from the truck onto his feet in the mud, his arms and hands seizing and shaking violently as he gesticulates nervously and paces.
“So - what happened just now -”
At first watching Risa and the Dean of his own timeline volley back and forth like a tennis match, Cas decides to intervene again, simply stating, “our fearless leader, I'm afraid, is all too well schooled in the art of getting to the truth.”
, no, we do
He’d be worried about technique or something, but it doesn’t seem likely that Castiel will be all too judgmental about something like that - besides, if he were human, he’d have a concussion from how hard his head flies back against the car.
“What? I’m not short,” Dean pouts grumpily.
Sometimes, if he tries hard enough, focuses enough energy, he can feel that Cas kissing him, feel that Cas’ heart thrumming away, hear the way his voice rolled through contractions more easily than the Castiel he knows in his own time, taste him like clementine, hear him in the breath between lightning striking and thunder clapping, and in the midnight hour, Dean can even feel him there in his arms, like a phantom limb.
Dean steps back and away, and they wait for the band’s dreamy rendition of The Way You Look Tonight to end before proceeding.
Reflecting his innermost Angelic nature, Castiel seems truly shamefaced when he admits, “I covet."
Looking over at Castiel again, how the hearts of his palms press against his forehead, and he’s hunched, like he’s protecting himself from a blow, Sam frowns.
“You should mind you’re fuckin’ mouth,” his future self threatens, coming nearer to him, “You have no idea what I’ve been through. You should be following my every fuckin’ order, you idiot, you should be thanking me on your knees for bearing this reality in your stead, so you can learn from it. Don’t fuckin’ question me.”
Even he and Sam’s flashlights are busted.
“What's that?”
There is no congregation, the grand hall is empty but for them.
“Fine! Then risk everything and everyone else! Not my - no, I don’t care if it’s - no! I don’t care if it’s cruel of me, Dean! You are my one and my only!” Cas cried, throwing his arms out wide, “Irreplaceable! Do not ask me to make peace with the fact that you can, at any moment, be stripped from me for the sake of saving fools!”
“Show me how to combat the attack!” Castiel begs, his downturned brows and genuine fear pinching at Sam’s heartstrings as his many eyes flash like lightning, “help me! Sam, please!”
Side-eyeing Castiel, Dean grimaces and mumbles, “Jesus, Cas.”
Dean thinks steam might be rising off the top of his head.
“... knowing you has changed me.”
He says nothing, though.
The first year he considers retirement, and he's drunk through most of it.
They let a few more quiet minutes pass, Dean pulls his knees up to his chest, and rests his head against his knees, turning to face Jody.
,” Dean specifies, “like, in all of time and Heaven, and Earth, and stuff, like all you’ve
"How did Jack get you out?" Dean interrogates, his hand shaking around the handle.
“That was lightning,” the elder Dean specifies, narrowing his eyes, gesticulating vaguely behind and around him, “You just said it. You said ‘lightning.’”
Dean thinks loudly, hoping it counts as a prayer that Cas will hear.
“Hello, Sam.”
To his general relief, Chastity appears to be unharmed (as do all the on-lookers), but to his mounting concern, she looks livid, throwing her arms around, marching down the hall, away from her opening door.
Woozy, and light-headed, he gradually tumbles backward, and Jody helps him into a sitting position in the grass; he cries into his hands, and wonders if he's going to throw up soon.
Before he can even properly lean into the touch, Castiel moves his bloodied hand onto Dean's shoulder, gripping him tight.
of beer.
“The what?”
Appropriately struck by Dean’s vulnerability, Sam nods, secures his hold on the doorknob, and pushes the door open.
way Cas apparently kisses.
“You think I’m a fuckin’ idiot? I've tried! I've shouted 'yes,' at the void til I was blue in the face! The Angels aren't listening! They just—left—gave up! It's too late for me, but for you—”
“Don’t say it again!” Cas orders, jumping to his feet, bending at the waist to cover his mouth with a firm hand.
Soon, Castiel’s hands move to grip either side of the collar of Dean’s jacket, and being the graceful, quick study he is, he switches the angle, and manages an unchecked, stuttered noise out of Dean’s chest, which seems almost to frighten him.
He doesn't know when that happened, only that it's true; there was a life before Castiel, Angel of the Lord, watched over him, came to his aid, pledged his loyalty, and listened to his prayers.
Muffled by his own hands, Sam mumbles, "he's got Clue under the fucking bed."
Maybe concerned that Sam would misunderstand him, Castiel drops his hand, and looks up at Sam again to say, "I did not mind his fear of me, his misunderstanding, or even his unwarranted attacks on me. I arrived to him in a form I had never taken before, I know it was messy, clumsy, and still often is, and now it had bullet holes, it was singed, and stabbed, I was only just beginning to heal on other planes as well in ways he could not see, but I was standing before him at a frequency that he could see and hear me…”
“My sniffer isn’t reliable,” Cas announces, as though it is a grave admission, “The synesthesia caused by the malformation of my Grace into my human vessel has ensured that while things smell much more specific than they once did, I’m not actually good at parsing smells out. Also, I don’t know that at any time I would have been able to smell out Lucifer, synesthesia or no.”
“What!?”
," Castiel answers smoothly.
"Dean?"
"He was good - plain good, I mean," Dean starts, staring up at the incoming storm clashing with the fireworks, face sore and wet from crying and shouting, "He was an Angel, so, it's assumed, I guess, but there were a lot of them - most of them, actually, that were just... they just didn't give a shit about anything other than carrying out orders. And I mean, they were designed for that, you know? I get it, I get that part, but Cas... he was better than them. He was better than the whole of all of those fuckers put together. He cared more about kindness than he did approval, and doing what was right above what was wanted of him, and he was the best of them. Hands down. He was the best Heaven ever had to offer."
There's suddenly so much for him to do, all of it fun, or ridiculous, or pleasant, or a long, long time coming. He's actually looking forward to it all.
Cas’ hand is wide and warm over his heart, where it’s glowing the brightest.
"You're keeping me hard, aren't you?"
“Oh,” Dean starts, facetiously casual, “how was it?”
He was never the kid passing love notes, or dropping books to the floor out of nerves all because he met eyes with some beautiful girl from across the room.
With that timer counting down from somewhere up above, Dean swallows around the jagged heat at the back of his throat, and inwardly tells himself to nut up.
Much later, he’s hesitating near the door of what was, unofficially, Castiel’s bedroom, staring at it long enough that it doesn't visually register or make sense anymore.
Staring down at the knife, Dean furrows his brow, and says slowly, "... you took my knife. And I was so fucked up about the whole thing... I didn't notice it was gone."
if u wanna scream abt fandom stuff or be friends i'm loserchildhotpants on all social media :)
Fed up, Dean’s counterpart shoves Cas down and back, stares at him angrily for a beat, then looks at his younger self.
“Keep it.”
“I don’t mind that you don’t love me, Dean. But if you could lie for me - just once. For a moment… please…”
“Cas?”
Dean seethes inwardly, but decides to plaster on a smile, and mock, “oh, wait, I know this one - we were in, uh, Jane's - ? - cabin last night. And, apparently, we and Risa here have a ‘connection.’”
Tears prickle at Dean’s eyes, and Cas looks at him sweetly, a thumb tenderly grazing the apple of his cheek.
, Cas - !”
“... that there is an additional human where there had not been one before…?”
While Sam does a fine job of teaching Castiel, and Castiel is a very quick study, they struggle with their height difference while Dean tells them about their height difference, unhelpfully and repeatedly.
“Well, no offense, Cas, but how could you know that?” Sam asks, raising a brow at him, “You have no point of reference. And the good news is that it wouldn’t make your feelings any less valid, or real, and you would not be the first person to have a crush on Dean, and, you know… if it’s just a crush, that’d be good for you, right? No eternity with all that weighing you down.”
"Yeah, well, leave it to Dean to find an overabundance of beautiful women drooling over him to be a problem," Sam gripes.
Claire stops herself, and she, Kaia, and Sam trade meaningful glances that Dean politely pretends he doesn't notice.
“I wanna hear what the commander’s gotta say.”
Overbalanced, Castiel falls back slightly, and Dean, adrenaline still running high, snatches Castiel’s tie with one hand, and anchors him at the waist with the other.
Dean tries to move his bloodless arms up to take hold of Castiel, to refuse to let him go, or just say
Claire is sat too close to the camera to be fully in the shot, but she clearly has to stifle a giggle before clearing her throat, and encouraging him, "no, we won't laugh, Cas."
How will he even look at a board game again?
“No," Castiel denies, fingers pulling with more force against his teeth.
“Really, Dean,” Castiel adds, squeezing Dean’s hand where they’re clasped; when that doesn’t work immediately, he takes advantage of a circling turn to near their faces - their noses almost bump, and Dean has no choice but to look into Castiel’s eyes, “I want you to know. You do know, don’t you?”
"It's meant to be played on a lyre," he tells her, plucking the strings.
he’s gonna die tomorrow. For you. For
Bashfully, the corner of his lips twitch up, and he seems lost in thought as he tells Sam, "I had reached him. Me. I had done it, I had secured him. Forty terrestrial years is a very long time for anyone or anything to traverse the bowels of Hell, and my work wasn't even finished. I tore him through every wave of frequency, invigorated with a power of flight that I had never felt before - I
It’s the look of a man with a purpose, and Dean is reminded of how the Castiel he knows in his own time is really very easy to please this way, happy to have his back, glad to be of service - he thinks to himself that he should thank Castiel more often than he does.
the Devil. The battle's gonna torch half the planet.”
- you saved that world, thankless, and unseen.
Cas’ arms wrapped across his shoulders, the safety of his gun clicked off from behind Dean’s head, and he pulled himself up close, chest-to-chest with him, lips close enough to make Dean’s mouth water.
Rolling his eyes as though he’s actually put out, Dean peels himself from the French window he’d been leaning on, and takes Sam’s place.
Castiel is a striking guy - Dean can appreciate that, objectively speaking, of course. That’s not a problem, really, Dean just thinks that the woman who eyes them is maybe too approachable. Not that his atypical, virginal friend should be considered out of anyone’s league.
anything ‘going on,’ I’m just saying there
"He was an Angel," Kaia explains with a shrug, "And he wasn't with you guys all the time. He was just out in the world, being... Angelic. We knew there had to be more people that would've wanted to do something for him."
"He was a good soldier," "he was a clean fighter," "he was a worthy opponent," "he was a warrior of unique make," "a better shield brother could not be imagined," and variations thereof - Dean wants to tell them to fuck themselves, to get out, that they're not welcome, but then one Angel approaches him with a stone in her hand, and says simply and plainly, "he was my brother."
With Castiel, it’s easy to laugh, and to smile, and to watch Castiel watch him, and that’s strange - Castiel himself is very strange, but he’s kind. He protects Dean, and takes care of Dean as well as he knows how to.
They stare at each other for a few beats, and the Angel is looking ready to speak, his lips even part, he takes a small inhale, but then his jaw tightens, and he looks away, “no. I can’t. It’s embarrassing.”
As much as this makes him uncomfortable, Cas is Sam’s best friend too, and he doesn’t intend to leave the guy out in the cold on this one.
be able to," Claire interrupts.
But Eileen is there as an emotional support for Sam, and they fill the quiet air, flirting in the backseat, Sam signing to her while she repeatedly laughs at him for accidentally signing something lewd, offensive, or absurd.
A wide hand covers Dean’s mouth, and Dean’s chest goes tight at the feeling of undeniable strength in it.
Struggling, Dean shifts on his feet, clenches his fists, and utters stiltedly, “Lisa. Ben.”
Castiel must catch onto that Sam has no idea what to say, and so he saves Sam the trouble by simply telling him, "thank you, Sam. This has been... enlightening. Your counsel is invaluable to me, and you've given me much to contemplate."
"Don't worry, Castiel," Kaia offers, "I won't let her be mean to you."
Codependence
Dean likes to tell baby Maura that she's just lucky she's so cute, but really Dean likes being useful in small, domestic ways, regardless. It makes him softer around the edges, and he winds up telling Eileen some of the best, most humiliating stories about Sam's formative years, because he's soaked in nostalgia when he's with them.
Dean knows he’s being too cold when he only answers, “okay,” but he can’t help himself. He’s furious, and he knows he’s about to lose Cas, and it’s - this is all fucking unthinkable and fucking avoidable, and Cas didn’t come to him when he should have, but he knows damn well that he’s the one that made Cas feel like he couldn’t, and it all comes back to him and how he fucks up every beautiful thing that crosses his Godforsaken path.
"So, you're gonna just not m-move on, you're just gonna -"
- fuck, Cas - we should move this to the backseat -”
“He's coming.”
And, more importantly, he wants to hear Cas' mixtape.
"It wasn't the same as my dad," she knows, "but he was still important, and he still protected me when he could, and he still cared about me, you know? And I knew that it would've made him so happy, because he - he really loved doing family-stuff with me, and I knew he would've wanted to, and I was gonna ask him to, and it was gonna make him get all weepy how he did, and -"
dorky. Like, painfully dorky."
Dean’s brain brakes hard - “ours?” he repeats, “
“Dean,” Cas discourages, begging for scraps of tact.
"What am I supposed to write on this stupid song list?"
This fic is gonna have Top!Dean in the next chapter. I am a Bottom!Dean truther, but for the sake of the fic, i don't think my dude is ready for that yet lol
Dean smiled, but there was a hot lump of unshed tears in his throat.
"You gonna say anything?" Jody asks Dean.
"I think he'd probably just like best that we're all together again," Sam assures her.
She does.
Praying/Mind-sharing, Fingers In My Mouth Friday, Face-fucking, Blowjobs, Drunk on Endorphins, Dom!Cas Vibes, Outdoor Sex, Sex ON the Impala, Dean Being Drunk On Lust Makes Him Kinda Dumb, Cas Being Possessive, Dirty Talk, a little bit of Hair Pulling, Praise Kink, Body Worship, Mentions of Anna, Misuse of Grace for Sexual Satisfaction and uhhhhh other stuff, I'm sure
Visibly inhaling as much as he can, Castiel looks up to the Heavens, grief-stricken, and Sam’s heart hurts for Cas as he screams into the storm, in a thousand voices, “
Swallowing nervously, Cas juts his chin out, still looking half-manic, “ours. Yours and mine. A bed we shared. And clearly, he didn’t tell you about that, so I misspoke. If he didn’t tell you, it’s because he didn’t want you to know. And I’m not surprised he doesn’t want you to know. I think he’d give just about anything to forget it all himself.”
“That’s great, ‘cause I was just about to suggest we talk more about it.”
Cas’ eyes snap up to his, round, twinkling, captivating - “oh, Dean…”
"Did he tell you?"
company,
Dean thinks he might be sober, or near enough.
Dean can’t manage to look Sam in the eye, and he cracks his knuckles in the pockets of his pajama bottoms, which muffles but doesn’t silence the sound.
“Does it mean - you liked it? That I’d say it?” Dean’s voice comes out barely audible, and Cas gives him that sad smile Dean hates.
“I love when you sing very loudly off-key, and when you think a joke you’ve told is much more clever than it really is, I love the way it makes you smile. There is no smile of yours that I don’t cherish, though, Dean. And I cannot say I am overly fond of John Wayne, but I enjoyed
That response pulls a chortle out of Dean, and his future self looks like he’s gearing up to find something worse to say, so he intercedes before that can happen.
Dean’s hands are shaking, he wants to compulsively crack his knuckles, but he’s trying not to, and no matter what feelings are stretching the seams of his chest, he won’t let himself cry, because crying would be some kind of surrender, and surrendering means
Thwacking the hand towel back down on the counter, Dean crosses his arms over his chest, takes an unnecessarily challenging stance, and repeats, "nothing. I said nothing, Sam. He told me he's known me in every realm, every time there is, every universe, every way there is to know a person - he put me back together after Hell, body and soul, he knows me more than anyone else possibly could, and he wanted me to know that he loved everything he knew. Unconditionally. And that the being - not even having a chance with me, it was fine for him, because he was happy just being in love... with me. And I said nothing."
“... but you won’t?” Dean catches, blood thrumming too loudly in his ears, “You won’t be Delivered?”
Blood is quickly leaving Dean’s skull, interests lying decidedly lower down his body, and with little to no oxygen making it to his head, he unconsciously bothers at Castiel’s suit jacket, compelled by instinct.
“Out.”
“No, that's—that's good. Classy.”
Subdued, Claire wanders off to join Kaia around the growing bonfire, and Jody sidles up next to Dean, crossing her arms over her chest, and looking up at him, "you've been awfully quiet tonight. Heard tell you've been running scared from just about every well-wisher too. Wanna talk about it?"
"He said I was the most caring, selfless, loving human being he'd ever known. He said I changed him - a way he shouldn't have been able to be changed. He was a soldier, he was built for it, he wasn't supposed to care about humans, he wasn't supposed to care about anything other than orders, but he cared about me, so he cared about you, and Claire, and Jack, and the world, the whole world all 'cause he grabbed me, and saved me from the depths of Hell, and - he didn't even like John Wayne, Sam. Like, he didn't like him, but he liked watching old Westerns with me anyway, because he said he liked how I imitated him, and he said he loved my mixtape - all those Zeppelin songs - and how I sing off-key and think I'm funnier than I actually am."
“I have known you, in Hell, in Heaven, in Purgatory, I’ve known you dying, dead, alive and well, I’ve taken the pieces of your brilliant and aching soul, and I put them back together stitch for stitch to return you to the world of the living. I healed your mortal body, molecule by molecule, and I saw to it that every single freckle was in place as it should be - I know you in ways that perhaps no one else can. Believe me when I tell you, Dean - you are a good man, and I love everything in you, of you. I love you, Dean.”
?” Dean chokes out disbelievingly, “Who the fuck are you holdin’ out for?! Angelina Jolie?”
"Dean!" Castiel admonishes, curling low, around Dean, trying but failing to stop thrusting into Dean's mouth, "Please, please - I want you to fuck me -"
“I am always available to you boys for whatever inquiries I can assist in. Is this pertaining to my staring? It’s academic in nature, I assure you - frankly, I am used to having a form that hosts many more eyes; being in this Earthly form can present obstacles, as my perceptions are more limited than I can remember them ever being. I promise I do not mean to insult anyone.”
“You comin’, Swayze?”
failures of the recent past… I was frightened by the unfamiliar, the unknown.”
“Mm,” Dean hums, intrigued, wondering what the progression of their relationship is like in this alternative timeline, “What else did you like calling me?”
“Excuse me?” his future self begs.
Taking a shuddering breath, Cas shrugs uselessly.
The very unfamiliar sensation of facial scruff isn’t off-putting the way Dean feared it may be, and while decidedly un-glossed, Castiel’s oval lips are just dry enough to pull more than slide against his, which is nicer than it has any right being.
“And I’m assuming that doesn’t have to do with it being locked, or something?”
Feeling too hot himself, Dean throws his jacket into the backseat and tries to convince himself that he’s not going to attempt to take anything with Castiel further than this.
When he meets Castiel’s eyes again, he can hear a replay of what he’d said earlier;
“I agree, though I do not know how,” Castiel mutters, sitting himself down on the floor, legs pretzeled, head in his hands, medicinal herbs sprouting from his hair, and falling around him.
something you wanted -”
“Nice to look at?”
He tells himself that maybe it’s that Cas loved him still, despite the cruelty, the void that overtook him - maybe the rightness of kissing that Cas had something tangential to do with that his future self had become his own father who only knew how to love well someone who was already dead.
“... I wanna save you.”
“Well, when you get back home—you say 'yes.’ You hear me?” his counterpart insists, “Say 'yes,' to Michael.”
"Really," Dean confirms, "I'd kill and die for Cas still, whether he's here or not, and I'd - I'd do
Between his fingers, Dean can still feel the texture of that stupid fucking trench coat, he can still smell the bizarre ozone-and-apple-cider fragrance that followed some immense display of power, he can taste dirt in his mouth, dirt he broke the surface of when he found himself encircled by fallen trees.
