“Jesus, Sherlock!” John balked and held up his hands in apology. “I’m so sorry, Monica.” She looked fairly ruffled by the experience but took a deep breath and went back into sales mode with a feeble laugh.
John waited a couple hours for Sherlock to emerge and offer his apologies for offending his delicate olfactory constitution, but the man never appeared. Finally John gave up and went to bed, but was surprised Sherlock wasn’t waiting for him in his customary roost in the kitchen when he went down the next morning.
Sherlock’s body bowed with apprehension on the stool, but the detective still pretended to be focused on his task. “What’s strange, John?”
Sherlock nodded and ascended the bottom stair before turning around and glancing back at John, extending his hand in silent question. If Mrs. Hudson wasn’t sure before, she would have no doubts now. But strangely, that was ok.
Sherlock’s pout was adorable, but an adorable distraction nonetheless. “I was thinking perhaps we could bypass the conventional preliminaries and just skip to anal sex.”
“Beautiful,” John murmured against the corner of Sherlock’s mouth when they finally broke apart for air. John ran the ridge of his fingernail up Sherlock’s thigh and his friend gasped.
“Yeah,” John began carefully, “she is...lovely.” The adrenaline rush seemed to have triggered something in his autonomic system and John actually felt his trousers getting a bit tight at the seams. Sherlock’s deep baritone only exacerbated the problem, and his question, which wasn’t really a question, had done some strange things in John’s mind. “Like that do, you?” coming from Sherlock’s mouth sounded filthy in the best kind of way. He swallowed nervously.
“Alright you, I think you’ve had quite enough fun tonight. It’s nearly freezing and you need a hot shower and some tea if you don’t want to collapse tomorrow.” This statement earned John an expression of indignation for his concern, but John steered his friend towards the cab Sherlock miraculously hailed from the sidewalk—in unspoken assent to heed his doctor’s instructions. Or at least John hoped. There really was no telling with Sherlock.
and then a shout, as Sherlock’s eyes would widen in shock as he convulsed into ecstasy, filling John with hot, throbbing spurts. The image of Sherlock coming down his throat sent John over the edge, and he screamed his release in his pillow.
John smiled tentatively and thanked Mrs. Hudson with a nod and took Sherlock’s hand. They walked in silence up the stairs and went through their former nightly routine of preparing for bed in the loo. The Fall had been so long ago, and John had missed this bit of easy companionship with his best friend. John took a moment to peek in at Rosie sleeping in her crib in his old room. He touched her face tenderly before retreating back downstairs. Sherlock was waiting for him in the kitchen, fidgeting in place. After a couple moments he took a deep breath and met John’s gaze in question. He extended his hand again and John took it without hesitation. Sherlock led John into his bedroom, where they snuggled under the covers. Sherlock draped himself possessively over John’s chest and John ran his fingers through the nest of curls on Sherlock’s head, feeling content for perhaps the first time in his life. He was home.
Sherlock’s eyes went utterly black, with only the faintest sliver of verdigris surrounding his pupils. He complied with a haste that would have been comical had John not been so eager. Sherlock’s cock was swollen and leaking and John felt his mouth water.
Sherlock’s eyelashes fluttered and he gripped the gear shift and wheel with white knuckles. He barely managed a nod as he punched the accelerator again.
As for John, he was harder than he’d ever been in his life. He was already feeling the first flicker of electricity coiling tight in his spine and slightly hysterical about this new reality. “God, you are so gorgeous. You know that right? I want to mark your neck with my mouth. I want people to know. Know that you are
would like?” John shook his head weakly and Monica seemed to hide her dejection well. The poor lass hadn’t caught on she wasn’t going to be getting a sale from either of them this evening. Nevertheless, Sherlock had John smell 10 more fragrances before John held up his arms in aggravation.
But Sherlock quelled the D.I.’s objections with a withering glare and motioned for John to follow him, even rushing past Donovan and Anderson without so much as a casual taunt, the billowing of his Belstaff the only indication of the speed with which he departed the night club. The location was at best a spot for young ravers to drop X and dance their cares away in the outskirts of London, and at worst a drug den waiting for something like this to happen given the appearance of some of the clientele.
“Sorry,” John huffed. “Uh, Melissa Finiss. Not the ...not the murderer’s” He dipped his head and backed away from Sherlock, who watched him leave in silence.
, John?” Sherlock prompted. His eyes had taken on a predatory gleam under the façade of the charming rich boy that unnerved John in its intensity.
And so it went on for nearly a week since he and Sherlock had their little domestic over tikka masala. Each morning Sherlock would hold up his wrist for John’s inspection and John would name off another of his conquests ending with the phrase “not the murderer’s”. Each evening Sherlock would don another perfume and the scenario would repeat itself. The rancor between them calmed down a bit after the first few days, and John wasn’t mad--well not too mad--anymore. He’d rather enjoyed having a reason to touch Sherlock’s slender wrists and smell the scents he’d procured, nearly forgetting his annoyance they’d been acquired in the poor Monica’s seduction. It was a silly game really, and John realized to his chagrin that if he did ever happen to catch the murderer’s scent it would be over. Sherlock was still Sherlock, and barely looked up from what he was doing when he proffered his wrist for inspection, waiting only for John’s commentary before delving back into whatever sordid task he had in front of him. In a couple attempts to annoy Sherlock John would go into more detail about his former lovers, mentioning the color of the women’s hair, or perhaps their cup size. But on those occasions Sherlock jerked his hand back as though John intended to perform the sex acts on him. John shouldn’t have been surprised because Sherlock didn’t
“Don’t,” John interrupted him. “Don’t. Give me false hope. Or confirm my fears. I don’t think I can stand it anymore.” He scrubbed his face and attempted to collect his thoughts.
“Take the medicine and eat some soup. You’ll be better before you know it.” Sherlock didn’t answer, but John hadn’t really expected him to deign his doctor with a response. With a heavy sigh John grabbed his coat and went to work.
John giggled and Sherlock offered the openly genuine smile that was for John alone, before he too descended into giddy laughter.
“Well, I say a friend, but it is more appropriate to say an acquaintance,” Sherlock scoffed, but then John noticed the way Sherlock’s palm stroked--stroked!--the length and ball of the shift. To his horror John felt his cock twitch with interest.
Sherlock obeyed and John stroked faster. “Fuck. When I come, I want you to pull this car over immediately. Am I clear, Sherlock?”
“Yes, John?” Sherlock leaned back over his microscope to replace another slide, not looking up at his flatmate. John eyed the experiment over Sherlock’s shoulder. His flatmate momentarily tensed under the scrutiny.
“Ah. Well.” John cleared his throat again, attempting to wrest his gaze away from the long fingers encircling the gear shift. But as he drew his eyes upward to the rest of Sherlock’s body he saw something that made his mouth water. Sherlock had...well, he had an erection. The ridge of his cock was
occurred to me.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, as though he hadn’t deleted the entire solar system once but determined the definition of bisexuality was worth keeping. “But you never dated any men.”
John would agree to meet him at a favorite Chinese restaurant a few blocks away from their flat. John had fallen for the ploy, as naturally Sherlock had been waiting on a text from Lestrade the entire time. Sherlock must have planned ahead for John to be at least
“If you want to play around with that poor girl’s heart be my guest.” John stood and dropped his plate in the sink with a loud clang. If Sherlock wanted to douse himself in ladies perfume the rest of his life John wasn’t going to stop him. Hell, maybe it’d be an improvement over Sherlock’s expensive shampoo and soap. Wickedly John hoped Sherlock would have to wear some cheap Britney Spears knock off in the very near future. And oh, he was going to give Sherlock a show.
“Hey, hey,” he soothed, drawing Sherlock’s face up. If his friend was crying John thought he really might lose it. But the expression on Sherlock’s face was a very near thing. Sherlock’s eyes gleamed with a different kind of intensity. Something like desperation mixed with fervent hope. Hope was something he’d probably never allowed for himself before. It was so similar to the expression Sherlock wore the night John had offered to die for him at the pool. Had that been the moment? Where everything clicked?
John answered with a click of his seat belt and giggled. “None whatsoever. It’s only fair I suppose.”
“Greedy one, aren’t you? Can’t say I’m surprised,” John admonished, before Sherlock wrapped those sinfully long fingers around John’s prick and pulled at his raging erection. “Chist!”
women with individual perfumes over such a span of time. John had to know by now Sherlock knew he was lying. Conclusion: John wanted the game to continue.
“Like that, do you?” Sherlock smirked as he took a particularly challenging curve with ease. The car actually drifted a bit, and John realized he wasn’t sure if Sherlock was talking to his flatmate or Mrs. Hudson’s car.
1. John was angry not “getting the girl”. Contrary Evidence: John had made no effort to get in touch with Monique since the night he’d met her. Hypothesis. He was angry
in her Aston Martin.” It was not a question. Mrs. Hudson was going to murder them in their sleep. Well, most likely John, but if John was very lucky, she’d be able to catch Sherlock post case when the detective slept like the dead.
“What do I smell like, John?” All of the sudden the light got very bright in the room and John realized how he must look to his flatmate, who’d just asked him to catalogue a baseline scent. But then this was Sherlock, so it made sense in its own way. Sort of.
“Do as you like.” John tried for his best attempt at nonchalance but his voice came out thick as he wriggled his jeans and pants down to his ankles. His cock bobbed enthusiastically at the newfound freedom and John spread his legs, feeling whorish but incredibly thrilled. This. Was. Happening.
Sherlock’s body drew tight and John squeezed his shoulder, pulling the man in for a bruising kiss and licking against his mouth. “Yes Sherlock, come for me. You gorgeous, brilliant creature.”
3. John made it a point to name the women he’d slept with after every touch. Interesting, because Sherlock had already looked each of them up online, and while they were real, John had given him false dates coinciding with sexual exploits. And, while scent is the most intense trigger for memory, it was unlikely for John to attribute so
“Fuck, John...Your cock…” Sherlock panted as he bounced against John’s thighs and bit his lip. John’s head lolled back and his muscles strained to go deeper.
when his friend leaned in to scent him. The tray of chemicals nearby adequately supported his story of not applying perfume to Sherlock’s wrists, but he hadn’t imagined John would be so blatant to come forward and smell Sherlock’s neck without asking him to turn around. He had hoped John would take the initiative, but even in his wildest dreams he hadn’t thought John would be so obviously stimulated by the experience. Conclusion: John wanted to fuck him, no matter how often Sherlock’s “not gay” flatmate continued to correct friends and colleagues.
Sherlock grinned wickedly and licked a stripe over John’s exposed nipple, making his lower abdominal muscles clench. John hissed and pulled on Sherlock’s curls, and the moan from his friend’s lips was obscene. It was with grim determination John didn’t chase those lips and settled back against the pillow. “Right. First thing’s first. You could have just said you wanted this. There was no reason to have an experiment.”
“Yeah, you want to come on my hand? On my cock? I will lick every drop off. God, I bet you taste amazing.”
Sherlock smirked in satisfaction. He righted the sheets and went downstairs to his room to give himself some much needed relief.
“Conclusion?” Sherlock prompted, his eyes blown a bit wider than seemed strictly necessary with the intrusion of his personal space. The git
“Who is that? Someone you know here in London?” Sherlock’s curiosity was barely controlled at this point, so John frowned to cover his glee. Sherlock never asked John questions about his mating rituals, having ordered John never to share unless someone died while performing them.
But then Sherlock shifted gears and John looked down and sucked in a breath. Sherlock wasn’t gripping the knob of the gearshift from the top. No, he just had to be gripping the...shaft. Sherlock released it and spun the wheel with practiced motion.
“Yes, I think needs must.” John chuckled and added, “It isn’t every day I shag my best friend you know.”
has given me every indication she’s willing to be more than helpful in this area. She’s already given me her number to contact her when I run out of samples.”
John made a quick grilled cheese sandwich in order to expedite his egress towards his bedroom. His erection had flagged somewhat, but it was still insistently demanding his attention. Fortunately, Sherlock seemed preoccupied with his other experiment--a tray of toenails coated in an array of chemicals. That wasn’t the slightest bit arousing, but John pushed those thoughts aside as he closed the door of his bedroom. He quickly shucked off his clothes and laid in bed to take a few lazy pulls on his prick as he tried to remember the Sherlock’s scent. Under the sandalwood and whatever spicy thing the berk had going for him--John assumed his ridiculously expensive soap--there was something else. Something like male musk, but inherently Sherlock. John grunted and pulled back his foreskin to finger his slit and stroke his frenulum. He imagined Sherlock beneath him, writhing in the sheets as John sucked on the pale column of his neck, taking that heavy scent into his lungs, and marking his friend with his teeth.
That drew Sherlock’s ire and John regretted it for a moment before collapsing into another fit of giggles.
, Sherlock.” He scrubbed his own at the memory. “If I hadn’t been so angry I would have felt sorry--” John stopped when he saw the taut line of Sherlock’s jaw. “Sorry,” John offered weakly.
Greg frowned, took a deep gulp and turned to John. “Listen,” John went to open his mouth, but Greg held up his hand. “Let me finish. Don’t be a twat. You and Sherlock are...meant for each other.” The D.I. grinned. “And His Highness has to know it. He’s just shite at dealing with emotions.” John snorted. “Ok, really,
“Was it then?” Sherlock quipped and shoved his hands into John’s pocket to retrieve Monica’s number. “Then you won’t be needing this.” He crunched the paper between his fingers and tossed it in a bin before John could stop him.
“Fuck, that is beautiful. If your hands weren’t otherwise occupied I’d ask you to unbutton that ridiculously tight shirt so I could see whether your nipples were hard. Are they? Are they hard right now, Sherlock?”
As the deep and dirty friction built between them Sherlock began to undulate his hips, spreading his legs wider to match John’s thrusts. His whimpers pealed out soft and deep and it was exquisite to behold.
Sherlock sniffed in disdain, which only exacerbated the whooping sneeze that followed. Monica cringed away. Even she was tiring of the hunt for the world’s most intriguing scent with the detective nearby. She slid John a slip of paper and John was truly relieved to discover she’d written her number on it. “I do hope you will come back to try again soon,” Monica chimed from behind the counter as Sherlock twirled away towards the escalator. John thanked her and fell in behind his friend.
“This one is Femme de HJ by Henry Jacques,” Monica said as she squirted a bit of the perfume on a slip of paper. “The top notes are very floral—iris, geranium, and clary sage—while the bottom notes are more sensual and spicy—patchouli and musk. You may also detect tones of jasmine in the middle.”
“I’m not a ‘car man’,” Sherlock scoffed with disdain. “This is a work of engineering ingenuity--practically a functional work of art--and I intend to simply,” he gritted his teeth as he took another turn, “conduct an experiment to see how well it performs.”
John exhaled the breath he’d been holding. Sherlock spending nearly 500 quid on ladies perfume was a bit much, even for him. “Thank goodness.”
“More John!” Sherlock growled petulantly through gritted teeth. John answered with a bruising bite to Sherlock’s arse before adding another digit. Sherlock yelped and bucked forward, then sunk back against John’s hand in bliss.
Sherlock touched his lips and added another data point: Engorged lips. Despite John’s constant reminder that Sherlock “didn’t do relationships” a lot had changed between him and his flatmate. Well, not much for Sherlock. Ever since John had shot a man to save him from himself Sherlock had experienced varying levels of heightened awareness with John’s proximity. The consulting detective might not “do” relationships, but sex was hardly a relationship, though it certainly had the potential to destroy their partnership and bond of friendship. Sherlock hummed and realized he had rubbed the heel of his wrist into his erection.
, John.” He leaned forward and painted a lick against John’s lips and John’s lower half was flooded with heat again.
Sherlock’s eyes gleamed with that curiosity that always put John on edge. “That’s right, you said you’d been wanking off to me for
For a moment John just sat in shock at the display before descending into maniacal giggles. “Only on Lacy, Sherlock. Jesus did you actually just put on ladies perfume to see if it matched the one from the crime scene?”
John swatted him. “It didn’t have to work.” He leaned down and whispered into Sherlock’s ear seductively. “And in case you’ve forgotten, I’ve marked myself all over you now.”
“I rubbed my scent all over your sheets, John. Surely you noticed.” Sherlock mouthed at John’s nipple, continuing his ministrations with newfound voracity.
Perhaps there was a way. John would find a way. John was good at finding those compromises, keeping Sherlock steady in moments like this. But he couldn’t exactly ask his friend for advice in this area. Another experiment was necessary to determine John’s feelings on the matter, if his talk with Gordon didn’t yield appropriate results. Then suddenly Sherlock grinned. There was no reason he couldn’t continue to test John’s reaction to scent. The parameters simply had to be modified.
Sherlock swung into the driver’s seat with all the grace of a jungle cat alighting on a heavy branch and rolled his eyes. “I told her it was for an experiment.” As though
“Duly noted, John.” Sherlock sulked but pulled himself to lay against John’s chest. And it was faint, not quite a whisper, but John was sure he heard, “And I love you too.”
The next day John found Sherlock laying in his thinking pose on the sofa and didn’t waste any time. Without warning John dipped his head just above Sherlock’s curls and took an audible whiff of the scent. Sherlock gasped and turned upwards to meet his eyes, then raised an eyebrow inquisitively for John’s response.
“No, no, not in London.” He turned another page of the magazine and let his eyebrows wander to his hairline as though he’d just discovered an article worth reading. He could practically
Sherlock kept his back to his friend as John made his way into the loo to take his shower. Once the door was closed--not locked--Sherlock had already disassembled every lock in the flat within weeks of the doctor’s arrival--Sherlock padded towards the bathroom and waited. Time for part 2 of the expanded experiment. After a sufficient amount of steam filtered through the crack in the door Sherlock entered the bathroom and pulled down his pyjama bottoms. The sound of John moaning stopped Sherlock in his tracks momentarily, as he heard the slaps and grunts of his flatmate masturbating under the spray. Fuck. He would give nearly anything to simply slide the curtain aside and join his flatmate, but the Seduce John Experiment
“Hmmm…” he started off slowly and waited to see Sherlock’s head tilt ever so slightly away from his feigned project. “That’s really strange.”
John fucked his fist in earnest and moaned as his vision went gray. “On second thought you should probably pull over now. You want to watch me come, don’t you?”
,” before screaming John’s name and convulsively squeezing John’s hair in his fingers. John reveled in the flavor of bitter-salty-sweet inundating his mouth as Sherlock’s cock pulsed against his tongue.
It was indecent the way the pink tulle on the frilly tutu contrasted with the curly black hairs surrounding the man’s groin. The victim lay bare from the waist up, with only the frilly garment, a pair of black patent leather stilettos, and a rather sizable screwdriver wedged in his occipital lobe for adornment. Sherlock twirled around the body taking in all the details of the murder scene. As per usual, Lestrade had ushered out the forensics crew, allowing John and Sherlock to survey the clues they might otherwise miss. Well that John and NSY might miss. John was no fool, but bereft of any delusions he was as clever as the “World’s Only Consulting Detective”. Aka flatmate, aka tall posh git, aka loathsome berk who wouldn’t let John finish dinner before whisking him off to a crime scene that was sure to ruin all future attempts at eating for the remainder of the evening. Not that eating after seeing a corpse usually bothered John. It was only that the man who’d somehow managed to find his head on the receiving end of a screwdriver had enjoyed the exact same meal as John only an hour before his demise. The contents of the takeout box sat cooling in the corner of the office, inundating the atmosphere with the scent of buttery noodles and over seasoned meat. There was another scent in the office that lingered in the air near the body, but John’s mind remained focused on studying Sherlock’s wobbly gait with more concern.
Treating Sherlock to dinner was the least John felt he could do after damaging the man’s fragile ego. It wasn’t gallant, just friendly.
“You’re loving this aren’t you,” Sherlock managed after he swallowed the pain medicine—without tea—in an act of defiance.
“CHRIST John! Do you recognize the perfume or NOT?!” Sherlock bellowed from the kitchen, slamming his fist into the table.
“Your technique thus far has proved more than adequate to secure a relationship with the masculine gender.” Sherlock smirked and John felt his cheeks go hot with the compliment.
John took a deep breath. “You’re the World’s Only Consulting Detective, Sherlock. Where do you think I want it to go?”
more suggestion and take a shower. John hoped it was hot enough to clear up some of the congestion in his friend’s chest and considered going downstairs to knock on the door to the loo to remind him of the temperature before dismissing the idea on account Sherlock might be too knackered to remember a flannel if he opened the door to bark at John for his coddling. John had to wave off the mental image of a semi-helpless Sherlock toddling about starkers and requiring physical assistance to get back to bed and listened instead for the water to shut off. He heard Sherlock’s door shut, and John rolled over to close his eyes. This was going to be a long week.
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to whimper and John continued, “Wouldn’t--ah!--give you my come then though. Not the first time. You're going to beg for it.” Sherlock took a turn and John slowed his hand to grip his shaft as he fondled his bollocks with the other.
him. Sherlock Holmes was standing before John fully aroused, hesitating in his desire to initiate a sexual relationship with John Watson. A flare of heat burned at John with the realization he was in control of this experiment, and Sherlock was at his mercy.
ever eluded him? Usually he rambled on about “obvious” clues amid various jibes about his disappointment in the general lack of competency of the NSY by now, pausing for John’s “brilliant!” and “amazing!” praises. But the grim set of Sherlock’s mouth and the tension in his jaw made it clear his customary deductions were not forthcoming any time soon. At least not verbally. That in and of itself was disturbing.
do jealously. This morning John had been in a hurry before work and he grabbed Sherlock by the arm and swung him around in his chair. John ran his nose along the slender underside of Sherlock’s wrist and inhaled deeply before meeting Sherlock’s eyes, which were blown wide in surprise. The detective’s mouth fell open and John realized he’d completely invaded the other man’s space, and was, in fact, nearly between his knees.
“Sherlock…” John started to fight the good fight for reason again, but was failing spectacularly when he felt Sherlock writhe his hips forward. John felt the velvety insistence of Sherlock’s prick slick between his thighs and tried not to raise his hips. He gripped his friend’s arms to steady his resolve. “Sherlock, I need to know where this is going.”
“John?” Sherlock prompted softly, then raised his hand to trace a line of water that had made its way down John’s neck and over his clavicle. John was surprised by the gesture, but even more so that Sherlock’s outstretched hand was trembling slightly. Sherlock’s eyes were already half lidded with lust under the smudges of coal lashes. His breathing was erratic and the flush of his neck reached his ears. Sherlock
“Tell me, Sherlock. What else would you let me do? Would you let me fuck you? Pound my cock in your arse?”
Once they were out of sight of the police Sherlock secreted a jumble of wadded up tissues from his pocket and blew his nose with a noisy honk of protest for his efforts. The detective looked in disgust at the mucus as though it were some offense towards his person before sneezing again in utter misery.
“Oh, no,” John huffed, “You don’t get to pretend you don’t know what’s going on.” Then with an exasperated sigh he added, “We have talked about this. Your...experiments crossing into unacceptable boundaries, Sherlock. Again.” John waved his hand at the towel. “Are you masturbating with my towels now to see how your scent affects me? Are you actually still on about this experiment?”
on Sherlock’s face. It was practically maniacal with glee, and John decided why the hell not. Let the man have his fun. Sherlock might not do sex, and this might not have the excitement of a case, but his expression was a very near thing to the one he wore when the two of them chased an armed serial killer through particularly sordid back alleys.
“God, yes,” John choked out and pulled at Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms. Of course the berk wasn’t wearing pants, and Sherlock’s cock sprung free, leaking with its foreskin fully retracted. John divested himself of his bottoms and pants in one fluid motion. John’s prick bobbed against his stomach, twitching and aching for another release already. With a sharp intake of breath, Sherlock grasped John’s cock and pulled, before slotting their members together and wrapping his absurdly long fingers around their shafts. Both men groaned with the contact--the thick heat and musk of them filling the air. Sherlock flicked his thumb over their slits and rounded the tips with the glistening fluid.
. And if Sherlock didn’t already look like sex with a gun, his profile in a sportscar was a close second. He revved the engine a couple times and quirked an eyebrow at John. “Problem?”
Sherlock snorted before shifting the vehicle into gear and peeling out of the parking lot. As they careened through the moderate traffic John became increasingly nervous. Sure he liked danger, but putting innocent pedestrians at risk wasn’t really his style. Several times John found himself pressing his foot into the floorboard wishing he could hit the breaks just a bit. Wincing after a particularly close call with a red traffic light, John found himself ready to turn to his friend and suggest perhaps he calm down. But then John saw the
John stepped out of the shower to retrieve his towel, fully sated and ready to have a rational, adult conversation with Sherlock over breakfast. Or, at least, he thought he was, until he smelled the strong musk of his flatmate on his towel. That bloody twat was still experimenting on him. This had gone on long enough.
“Jesus no, Sherlock, no more experiments,” John moaned and pulled his friend, no lover, into an embrace. “I will love you till the end of time, but just, talk to me first before you start a stash of my semen, yeah?”
“Right,” John said simply and unzipped his flies, hearing the sharp intake of breath from the driver. The cool air on John’s skin made him hiss and he gave his prick a long pull.
“And then the great git announced who the culprit was, as though he’d figured it out days ago,” Greg nearly spat into his beer. John gaped. “He was only too willing to point out we should have done our jobs as per bloody usual, and then…” Greg stopped when he saw the look on John’s voice. “Oi, what’s that about?”
scent for his fair lady.” Sherlock made John sound like a real poncy arsehole, and the doctor had to grit his teeth to repress a growl. Monica was giving off some pretty clear signals she wouldn’t have minded helping John with a few other items on his shopping list.
“Check with the bouncer about who was close to the victim and notify me immediately if you find anything,” Sherlock ordered imperiously, depositing his test samples into his pockets.
John felt his cheeks flush warm as Monica’s face lit, now clearly enjoying Sherlock’s proximity. Even sick Sherlock was a gorgeous specimen of a man. She twisted a fingertip around a lock of auburn curls on her neck and leaned in closer, seemingly enchanted by the detective. Sherlock knew his flatmate had a predilection for red-haired women so John cleared his throat and stepped forward competitively. “Yes, I’m afraid I wasn’t able to determine what it was, but it. Was. Enchanting.” John enunciated the last few words with a tap on the glass, meeting Monica’s eyes roguishly. She tittered her approval.
John dressed and made his way downstairs in a groggy haze for a visit to the loo before taking stock of the developing situation in the kitchen. As he surveyed the flat, he was relieved to discover that this time there was no smoke to accompany Sherlock’s experiment. There was, however, an extraordinarily ill detective slumped and pouting at the table. Shards of glass littered the floor and John retrieved a broom to clean up the mess, as Sherlock was in no condition to be bending over to do it himself, let alone conducting experiments.
” He nudged his chin forward and placed a chaste kiss against John’s lips, then pulled back to gauge John’s reaction, like a child taking a biscuit out of a cookie jar waiting for approval. He wanted?
“I don’t know, Sherlock. I haven’t got any experience with perfume.” John protested, suddenly taking in the sheer number of bottles littering the counters in the salon. This was ridiculous.
. And oh, how he’d been interested that first night at Angelo’s. John could barely contain his joy when Angelo had brought them a candle, and yet Sherlock had given him the “married to my work” speech. John was a good man. A good friend. And Sherlock was too brilliant a star to be hindered by the lust of an old army doctor. He sighed and rolled over to find a flannel and clean himself up. Now that he had allowed sex with Sherlock to become part of his fantasy there was no going back. He’d definitely do it again. John’s cock twitched with interest. Soon.
“Got anything yet, Sherlock?” Lestrade prompted after what seemed like an eternity for Sherlock to examine the body with his loupe and take some samples from under the victim’s nails and around the head wound. Sherlock scowled. Had a deduction
Sherlock glanced around John’s bedroom to survey his options. It wasn’t as though he’d never been in John’s room. He’d spent several occasions looking through John’s trunk looking for his gun, even discovering some mouthwatering photos of a young John in fatigues. He’d committed the image to memory before replacing the items. But it wasn’t as though Sherlock could use those for this particular endeavor. Sherlock sat on the bed and ran his fingers over the comforter. It was soft yet sturdy. And dangerously tempting. Just like John. Feeling nostalgic Sherlock curled up to rest his head on John’s pillow and sighed. John would be home soon and Sherlock hadn’t found anything more suitable. Fuck it. John’s pillow would have to do. If John couldn’t pick up on Sherlock’s blatant invitation to experience carnal bliss with him after talking with Lestrade then he’d make it unmistakably obvious. Sherlock rolled over on his stomach and unbuttoned his shirt before nuzzling his cheeks over John’s pillow. He was careful to rub his curls over both sides, hoping John’s body heat would activate the scent to surround his head and inundate his senses when he jerked off. The image of John pumping his fist with his cock while smelling Sherlock all around him sent a shiver down the detective’s spine, not to mention a discomforting bulge in his trousers. Best to be thorough, he thought as he leaned back to undo his fly, allowing his heavy cock to pop free against his belly. It was already leaking, and Sherlock had the fantastic urge to just rut against John’s sheets. Instead he gave his prick a few tugs, careful to avoid the pre-come on the tip, and rubbed his hand just under John’s pillow. There.
“Ah, no, sorry,” John said sheepishly then added quickly, “Oh but it was very lovely. Perhaps you could write down the name and your information in case I decide to purchase that one instead, yeah?” John hoped with every fiber of his being she would take the hint and give him her number. Monica seemed to nod in understanding and directed their attention towards some slips of paper surrounding a set of bottles.
“Hmm?” Sherlock queried then finally offered, “a friend from Uni had a porsche and insisted I take it out for a spin.” He sighed and grabbed the gear shift--again, not with the bloody knob, flicking his thumb over the...head. “Honestly it astounds me. He named it, John. He
“Beautiful tits though,” John persevered, squashing the urge to get up and see if his flatmate was blushing. “Amazing arse too. Firm and plush…and oh my god, her mouth...”
“Can you describe it to me, John? ” Monica leaned forward seductively. “Was the scent something you would describe as spicy or sensual?” She let the words flow from her lips in invitation. “There are so many…varieties…”
John tried to hide the heat in his cheeks, taking a long drag from his pint and hoping the D.I. would attribute it to the effects of the alcohol, and not his indignation that Sherlock had not bothered to mention this through the duration of the perfume experiment. “How long has the case been solved then?” John managed after he leveled his breath.
taste good, salty and slightly sweet—the berk liked sweets--so there was barely any bitterness. It was heavenly. John wanted to do a victory lap for making Sherlock come apart so completely, but he wasn’t sure he could stand. His friend wasn’t faring any better, as Sherlock breathlessly staggered to the bathroom to retrieve a dampened flannel. He held it out to John, who grinned at his friend and accepted it gratefully. Now that the sex was over, John couldn’t help the niggling of doubt that bloomed in apprehension as to what they should do next.
Sherlock turned back to his food, looking a bit crestfallen before he picked up his fork with a smirk. “No, John. Three Continents Watson is no match for the World’s Only Consulting Detective.”
“Come inside me then, John.” The detective’s baritoned voice seemed to reverberate through his chest straight to John’s bollocks and Sherlock grinned triumphantly. John managed to swing his hand forward and grip Sherlock’s cock, purple and oozing pre-come down the length of his shaft. Sherlock’s body jerked with the stimulation and his eyes lit with surprise, and he rambled the incantation of
“You gorgeous idiot,” John breathed against his friend’s heart shaped lips and guided Sherlock’s mouth back to his. Sherlock whimpered with the contact, and John took control, guiding Sherlock backwards with his hands until the detective’s back was flush against the wall. He drew the taller man down to him and licked at the seam of his mouth until Sherlock granted him access. John explored gently at first, taking little sips, but then Sherlock sucked on his tongue and John couldn’t help but rumble in approval. This seemed to give Sherlock more courage and he deepened the kiss, sliding his tongue over teeth and nibbling on John’s lower lip. They plundered each other’s mouths, and the kiss became wet and filthy. “Fuck, Sherlock.”
“And you are comfortable now because…?” Sherlock queried. John detected a hesitant, soft tone to his friend’s tone.
John backed away and Sherlock whined at the loss of heat. “Give it to me, Sherlock. Give me your come.” John growled and Sherlock balled his hands into fists at his sides. John grabbed a wrist and guided Sherlock’s fingers into his hair. Sherlock nodded minutely and John descended on his friend’s cock again, hollowing his cheeks and moaning in pleasure. John managed to run his fingers up Sherlock’s chest and squeezed a hardened nipple. Sherlock cried out, and John felt another gush of pre-come on his tongue.
Sherlock made no reply and sniffed as John grabbed a blanket and offered it as consolation. Sherlock turned on his side and, with an exaggerated sigh, John laid the blanket over his friend, before getting up to prepare for bed. A half hour later he heard water running downstairs, indicating Sherlock had chosen to follow at least
.” The man actually gripped the shift with serious force and jammed on the gas. The Aston Martin lurched forward and John hoped his brain would receive the message he still required oxygen. All his blood seemed to have taken a direct route to his prick and there was no way, none at all now, that Sherlock wasn’t aware of the effect this experience was having on John. He found himself squirming in his seat.
remind me.” John couldn’t help but notice the way the color had risen to Sherlock’s cheeks and wondered if another conversation wasn’t being had entirely.
Sherlock’s body went rigid as he stood up from his chair and approached John warily. His body seemed closed off, as though covered in armor. “And, what results would you surmise I’ve gleaned from my studies?”
Sherlock looked at him in awe and fascinated astonishment. Then, in a voice so small John wondered if Sherlock really meant it to be heard, he said, “everything.”
John awoke to the sound of glass breaking downstairs and groaned. If he lived anywhere else, perhaps he would have shot out of bed to investigate. But as he lived with a maniacal scientist he knew Sherlock had likely destroyed something in his makeshift lab on the breakfast table.
John came with a barely muffled shout, biting his wrist in the process and nearly drawing blood. As John lay panting and covered in come, the phrase “a bit not good” seemed like an understatement. He had quelled his impulses to fantasize about his best friend since they’d moved in together, dismissing the thoughts as impulsive and attempting to reframe them into the desire for more feminine forms. John wasn’t afraid he was gay. He was bisexual. That much had been proven to him in the army. Sherlock might have deduced John’s sexual preferences had his experiment involved
the girl. Unfair. John knew Sherlock’s methods and she was at no risk for being properly seduced. It was her
The variables had been addressed, but now it was imperative to devise a way for John to take more initiative. Sherlock took a moment to check with his internal assessment of what he wanted John to do. Sex was welcome. Very welcome in fact. And yet...John would inevitably want more. When it came to actual relationships of the romantic variety, Sherlock knew failure well, if his experiences with Victor at Uni were any indication. And he would fail John. Spectacularly. But the idea of going back to the status quo- he and John dancing around their mutual attraction to one another in the hopes of retaining that close friendship, seemed suddenly unbearable. He wanted John to kiss him, to fuck him. To cherish him.
“This vehicle can go from 0 to 60 in 4.6 seconds with a top speed of 190mph, John,” Sherlock answered ruefully, as though John was any expert on the matter. “We need to go somewhere more open.” Sherlock rounded a corner towards the A40. “Chiltern Hills I think.”
to sell men perfume for other women. Any expectations to the contrary were ridiculous. Supporting evidence: John
Hours later John exited the cab and Sherlock grasped his wrist to pull him into Harrods department store. “Come along, John!” Sherlock ordered as he led John through the crowd. When they reached the escalator Sherlock allowed John to free his hand. He sorely wished a hand sanitizer station would be readily available once they’d reached their destination. Sherlock looked only slightly better—he wasn’t swaying on his feet, but the discoloration under his eyes and reddened nostrils of his chaffed patrician nose were clear indicators he will still very sick. Sherlock was practically vibrating his excitement however, and John welcomed the sympathetic rush of adrenaline in his own blood.
“You’ll just have to wait on the case, Sherlock.” John attempted to add a bit of sympathy to his tone in an effort to calm his friend.
“The thing is,” John croaked, “That bloody idiot has been dousing himself with perfume every morning and night, trying to trigger my memory for the scent of the murderer.”
“No apologies necessary, John. You had every right to be angry,” Sherlock managed and swallowed thickly. The incident with Culverton was still a bit fresh for both men. Though Eurus had provided a more than adequate distraction, it had only been six months since the nightmare at Sherrinford following Mary’s death. Both men were still in the process of healing, and John hoped their joyride might be just what they needed for some levity. As it was, Rosie was with Mrs. Hudson at the moment being doted on and probably filled with an unadvisable number of biscuits. Most surprising to John was the way Sherlock doted on Rosie. While the great git had been too distracted to pay any attention at her christening, Mycroft had sniffed about Sherlock’s insistence his brother should look at her photo
...over and over again until his body pulled taught and he came apart with a silent scream. Sherlock’s cock pulsed thick white spurts, striping John’s chest, and John felt a crescendo of electricity unspool in his belly.
, how long I’ve wanted you?” John panted. “Wanted to mark your beautiful skin? I’ve been fantasizing about fucking you
fast, Sherlock. There’s no shame in being one of the boys. Besides, you’ve probably seen the footage of Mrs. Hudson’s performance on the telly so you already know damn well what this car can handle.” John couldn’t help but add, “of course it was probably different riding in the boot. Christ, I wasn’t sure if you were trembling because you were high or terrified of her driving.”
Sherlock cleared his throat as John took great effort to pull back, and despite what the proximity must be doing to Sherlock, it was hard to allow the moment to end.
Sherlock glowered at him, but Monica came to his rescue. “What if I let you smell some samples? I’ll pick a few recommendations, along with the one I’m wearing now.” She winked at him and leaned across the counter to invite him to smell her lovely neck. John felt Sherlock’s gloved hand push him hard into Monica’s hair and she squeaked in surprise.
.” His hips undulated and John could tell Sherlock was desperately seeking friction for his aching cock.
John issued a wicked laugh and slid his hand under Sherlock’s waistband, dragging fingernails over the soft flesh of his arse. Sherlock bit back a groan, rolling his hips forward into John’s, and their erections slotted against one another under the fabric. Sherlock worried his lip and screwed his eyes shut at the contact, gripping the ball of John’s naked shoulder as though it were some sort of life preserver.
“Good evening,” Sherlock began and looked at the lady’s name tag, “Monica. My friend John here is looking for some perfume for his girlfriend.” He broke into a sheepishly delightful grin and added conspiratorially, “You see, he smelled the most exquisite fragrance the other day at a soiree but was unable to locate the wearer to ask the name of the scent.”
At the crime scene John waited patiently for Sherlock to regale him with an explanation regarding how the murder happened, and where Lestrade could find the screwdriver assailant.
“Yes, Sherlock?” John chuckled, and continued his ministrations across the delicate tissues of his friend’s jaw and clavicle. John used his other hand to pull Sherlock’s slender hip closer and Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath.
John swallowed. Sherlock was too close to be having this conversation, and was less than a foot away. God, his scent was getting stronger...John realized perhaps he should have made that trip upstairs to retrieve a shirt before instigating this dialogue.
Sherlock threw his head back and howled as he came, his cock pulsing and drenching them both with his semen. Sherlock’s climax was so bloody marvelous, John took only a moment to look back down and see their hands covered, chanting, “Oh god oh god oh god” then coming with a curse and Sherlock’s name on his lips. John fell on his knees and took Sherlock’s softening erection into his mouth, sucking the come onto his tongue and Sherlock wailed, convulsing and thrusting his hips forward helplessly until John had mercy and focused his attentions on the dripping fluid still clinging between Sherlock’s thighs. And Sherlock
Sherlock inhaled through his nose and opened his eyes, which were blown wide with fear and arousal, and leaned forward to rest his forehead against John’s. His countenance was fraught with emotion and he blinked several times before he answered. “I needed to know...if you wanted...Christ,
“You told her this was for a case?” John snickered incredulously as he plopped unceremoniously in the passenger seat. “You can’t tell me she seriously bought that.”
John growled and surged forward to reclaim Sherlock’s mouth, gripping the other man’s cock firmly. John wove his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and squeezed, before pulling Sherlock’s head back, exposing that long neck. “Do not come yet, Sherlock,” John ordered firmly as he ran his thumb over the slit of Sherlock’s prick. John licked a stripe over Sherlock’s carotid, feeling the pulse under his tongue. “Jesus, you taste so good. I wonder...would you like me to taste this?” John gripped Sherlock’s cock meaningfully and his friend bucked his hips into John’s fist. “Tell me, Sherlock,” John prompted.
A chuckle rumbled through Sherlock’s chest and he dipped his hand into the pocket of his suit jacket, producing a handkerchief and dropping it in John’s lap. “You can take care of that if you want.”
That’s good, John,” Sherlock breathed before he spun and faced John again. The expression on Sherlock’s face usually signaled mortal danger, but Sherlock leaned forward again for a bruising kiss. Hard enough that John didn’t notice Sherlock had guided John’s cock between the cheeks of his arse. “Ready?” Sherlock panted into John’s mouth and John nodded dumbly, feeling a wash of adrenaline invade his system.
“Right then. Why are we here, Sherlock?” John glanced around them warily. Sherlock had the tendency to forget mentioning inevitable altercations when they cornered a suspect and the seething mass of people surrounding them was going to make a chase difficult.
John leaned forward and his senses were inundated with the exotic fragrance. It smelled heavenly. “Mmmm,” he purred. “That is lovely.” Monica preened and he ventured to ask, “How much?” He was ready to be done and go home. There was no way he was going to be able to smell everything in the store.
“Ready for your inspection, Sherlock?” John called, then cursed himself for his choice of language. In fact, he’d been thinking of inspecting his friend all day at the surgery and had a hard (pun intended) time waiting to get home. It wasn’t his fault Sherlock had chosen to anoint himself with attractive smells normally reserved for women. It was a natural response.
John watched Sherlock as he rode back to Baker Street in the not-but-kind-of-stolen Aston Martin, thanking god and Rosie that Mrs. Hudson wasn’t likely to be waiting for them outside the parking lot with a weapon. Both men were fiercely proud and fond of their not-your-landlady, but respectful enough to be afraid if caught. Sherlock stopped for petrol, just in case she’d notice and John convinced him it was Not Good to attempt to roll back the odometer. John wished Sherlock didn’t have to use the stick shift, as he might have managed to hook a finger around Sherlock’s along the way back. They arrived at 221B only to find Mrs. Hudson waiting for them in the entryway. She cocked an eyebrow at them and pursed her lips as she tapped her foot on the floorboards. Both men found themselves shuffling, studiously avoiding her appraisal. John felt very much like a teenager and he could only imagine what punishment lay in store. How she knew what they’d done John could only imagine fell into the mystical realm of a mother’s intuition. That and perhaps she’d noticed Sherlock had nicked her keys.
With a sigh John poured his tea and motioned for Sherlock to follow him into the sitting room. John clung to the feeble hope if he provided Sherlock with his observations now he could avoid the dozens of texts the detective would send him at the office. “I saw a man who clearly has a fetish for crossdressing in the back room of a seedy dance club. Other than the screwdriver in his skull he sustained no other injuries—no scratches or bruising on the body or evidence of sexual assault. Based on the angle of impact it appears the man was attacked from behind and caught unawares.”
Sherlock snorted derisively. “No, but you have just proven my theory. You can remember scents, John.” He beamed at John in satisfaction. “Now we just have to narrow it down.”
“It’s not magic, Sherlock. Eat some chicken soup, drink lots of water, and take the medicine at regular intervals and you will eventually survive the betrayal of your transport,” John answered with a sigh. He didn’t have time to engage in one of Sherlock’s tantrums before he went to the clinic, and decided he’d better pick up something to eat for himself on the way. If he remained at the flat any longer he might be tempted to take a day off to play sick nurse, and, after all, it really was just a little cold even if Sherlock did look like hell.
“Is this...is this a game to you? Because I don’t think this is funny.” John was incredulous. And exceedingly frustrated, because the idea of jerking off while watching Sherlock drive was a dream come true, one he hadn’t realized even existed. Until this moment anyway.
. Had Sherlock just run into the kitchen after dousing himself in ladies perfume? John suppressed a giggle by clearing his throat. John finished making the tea and naturally slid Sherlock’s cup next to him to stroll back into the sitting room. He unfurled one of his medical journals and began to sip at his tea, his eyes gingerly avoiding Sherlock’s hunched form in the kitchen. After studiously ignoring Sherlock’s sighs and grunts of annoyance--which thankfully were no longer honking sneezes--John hazarded a casual conversation.
John grinned, glad he wasn’t the only one affected. “I want to taste your mouth,” he groaned, “Before you suck me.”
endeavor? We have spoken about this, yeah?” His friend wasn’t moving, so John ran his thumb over Sherlock’s jaw. “Look at me, Sherlock.”
John was due to see Lestrade for pints the next evening, when it was likely results of the case will be shared. It was time to change the rules of the game. Variables had to be taken into account and more training would be necessary.
“Did he?” John asked in annoyance. “Maybe he just wanted to finish up his experiment. You know how bored he gets. How he latches onto an idea.” John snorted. “It wouldn’t be the first time he’d used me in one of his mad projects.” But the ramifications of this particular experiment was
John leaned closer and rested his jaw against the soft globe of Sherlock’s arse and breached him with a second finger, watching as the tight muscle widen even further. With a needy whine, Sherlock sank back, and John, feeling mischievous, crooked his fingers, lightly brushing the soft pad of Sherlock’s prostate. The other man bit off a cry as his legs seemed to momentarily fail him.
Later that evening after work John returned to find Sherlock sitting at the kitchen counter again. “Got anything new on, Sherlock? Or will you be playing coy this evening?” The detective frowned and held out his wrist. John smelled it and licked his lips. “Patty Wilson, junior year. Not the murderer’s.”
. Sherlcock’s muscles fluttered around his cock and John felt the white heat of his release filling Sherlock, dripping out of his arse and coating the sheets between them. Sherlock milked him for every drop, then spasmed a few more times before he fell in a boneless heap on John’s shoulder, gulping for air.
“No, a game would be if I suggested you stroke your cock faster when I speed up and slower when I take some more turns.” Sherlock quirked his eyebrow and John could practically hear the ‘obviously’ the man left unspoken. John wanted to
Sherlock seemed to have found a proper “course” for his Aston Martin Experiment, and he turned to John and grinned before jamming his foot on the pedal. The sportscar roared to life and seemed happy for the exercise.
John bent down and swallowed Sherlock to the root. Sherlock’s prick was hot and thick in John’s mouth, and blissfully perfect. It had been a long time since John had given a man head, but he was damn good at it. Sherlock
“2.5 kids and a white picket fence. I can’t be that for you, John,” came the muffled reply. A shudder ran through the man’s back and John could barely believe what he was seeing.
Sherlock chuckled darkly and John prayed the man hadn’t read his thoughts. So far John had managed to quell his romantic interest in his flatmate, because, well, this was Sherlock, and while it had been ages since John got laid, that ship had sailed. If it ever had sails. Which John was reasonably certain, if Sherlock had a ship, it only had sails for Irene Adler. Her infernal texts sent spikes of jealously in John. He still couldn’t believe how he’d practically begged Sherlock to shag The Woman after learning she knew Sherlock’s birthday.
“Tell me this is ok, John. Let me...” Sherlock husked and John released his wrist, having forgotten he still held the detective hostage. Sherlock ran his sinewy fingers over the ridge of John’s erection through the tented fabric. Sherlock’s touch ignited a fire trilling along every one of John’s nerve endings and he had to bite the side of his mouth to quell his urge to sob.
, was all John could think as he swallowed the other man’s seed, grateful for the gift that had been offered. He would be wanking to this for
Sherlock only barely managed to contain his smug smile and elevated heart rate as he tried to refocus on the set of toenails in front of him. John said he smelled nice. Correction.
“John, if you’re going to insist on idle chit chat I suggest you call up Gad.” Sherlock snorted and turned away as though he’d become suddenly very interested in the cooling tea by his arm.
“Christ. I want to taste them so badly, Sherlock. You are so bloody perfect.” John winced. “Speed up again. I’m so close…”
“And have them trying to shag my roommate?” John snorted in irritation. “As if I’d give them the chance.” Having one of John’s dates seduced by Sherlock, while not exactly probable once the detective dismantled them with deductions, would have sent John into a fit of jealous rage.
“I want you to lay back in your seat like a good pet. Pull down your trousers and pants and spread your legs as far as you can.”
After they got to the flat, Sherlock lumbered up the stairs to hang up his coat and scarf before collapsing on the couch into a great heap of grumpiness. John made some tea, and noted with wry amusement how every time Sherlock attempted to enter his mind palace, snot would run down his steepled fingers and rouse the detective from his thoughts. John finished the tea and set a cup on the table next to his friend meaningfully. When Sherlock didn’t immediately take the beverage John knitted his brows in irritation and laid a hand on Sherlock’s heated forehead. He stood up to fetch some paracetamol and returned to find Sherlock glaring at him in reproach. John’s grim expression must have indicated the medicine was nonnegotiable and Sherlock acquiesced with a grunt.
.” Imagining Sherlock as a big black cat rubbing his cheeks on John’s belongings to mark ownership was an image John planned to hang onto for the rest of his life. “Wait, does Mycroft have any cameras in my room?” He mused aloud, hoping perhaps there was a way to obtain the evidence.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and careened into the couch with a huff and a groan, apparently forgetting that a cold came with sore muscles. “Obvious,” he croaked and waved his hand in dismissal. “Anything else, anything at all I might have…missed.” Sherlock winced at the admission of his own limited capacity to remain objectively observant.
?” John steeled himself for Sherlock’s answer. Knowing Sherlock it could have been his first thought at breakfast before shower and he had no intention of indulging himself longer than the span of a few hours.
The sensation of Sherlock’s body sinking onto his cock exploded behind John’s eyes. Both men looked down to where they were joined and shared a groan. Sherlock’s cock bobbed obscenely against his stomach and he hissed when he started to move. Slowly at first, he lifted his hips and lowered himself until John was fully seated inside him. This was happening, John marveled. He was inside Sherlock bloody Holmes, stretching him completely. The tight heat of Sherlock’s arse clenched around him and John struggled not to let his eyes roll back for fear of missing a single moment. The noises Sherlock made when he started to ride him were filthy and whorish. Sherlock circled his own nipple with one hand and pinched at the pebbled flesh, whimpering as John plunged into him, tipping his head back to reveal the tall column of pale skin. It was the most beautiful thing John had ever seen.
to think of you when I had a wank. I didn’t want to make you...uncomfortable. I know how you feel about The Work. And I didn’t want to risk...” John cut off, hoping Sherlock would take the hint that Sherlock’s supernatural cunning would have made his transgression readily apparent in time.
you. That was going to be enough for me.” He paused and swallowed back his last vestiges of fear. “And if you want me, no matter how you want me, I will be there. So just...just tell me what you want.”
“Yes,” John answered with a smile and cupped Sherlock’s cheek tenderly. “Yes,” he said again as Sherlock’s eyes gleamed wetly in the moonlight. The words didn’t need to be said really. Not between them until they were home at Baker Street.
John hid his smirk behind his cup and hmmed. “Well, it’s just...that ever since I got back to the flat I can’t help but start thinking about Lacy Cannes.” John shook his head as though to clear it, watching Sherlock toy with the knob on the scope.
“Well, I would help but I have my hands full at the moment.” Sherlock grinned evilly and added, “I won’t watch, if that’s your concern. It must be getting nearly painful now.”
believe it, because this was Sherlock, and he had no concept of the boundaries about sniffing your flatmate’s neck. All day John had been looking forward to smelling Sherlock’s wrist and this
hard on quelling his burgeoning erection whenever John drew near for their experiment. Physical intimacy triggered sexual response?
John let out an undignified whine at Sherlock’s admission, but he couldn’t be arsed to care. He lurched forward to capture Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock moaned into the kiss and clutched at John’s arms. When they parted for breath, Sherlock leaned away, his lips swollen and red. “Now, if you don’t mind, John. I’d very much like you to fuck me now.” He winked in satisfaction as he retrieved lube from his bedside drawer. John made to get up but Sherlock swatted him back and covered his elegant fingers with lube. “Watch, John.”
“No more, Sherlock. I can’t smell anything anymore.” John gestured to the enormity of the next display. “And you,” he pointed accusingly, “You’re going to infect half of bloody London if you don’t get back to bed.”
Sherlock seemed to register the questions on John’s lips and he shook his head. “No, John. Bed. Now,” was all he managed as he held out his hand to pull John off the floor. John allowed Sherlock to lead him into his bedroom and they collapsed into the downy sheets—the ridiculously luxurious sheets—that seemed well deserved after what they’d just done. John was surprised when Sherlock manipulated himself into the crook under John’s arm and snuggled onto his chest. John wasn’t sure that his friend would be a cuddler after sex, but was so overwhelmed with love for the man he nearly cried at this display of affection. As their breathing regulated they drifted off to sleep, blissful in each other’s arms.
John leaned forward, suppressing his irritation at the discomfort of the console poking into his stomach. Sherlock
John waited several minutes staring at his phone. He didn’t know why it mattered so much to console Sherlock. The detective had done countless experiments on him--without his permission thank you very much--so it only seemed fair John should get in a little ribbing when one wasn’t successful. But Sherlock’s expression held something more than simple embarrassment. Something unnamed. Something like hurt.
John awoke a couple hours later to find Sherlock still resting against his chest. His friend was sleep warm and when John ran his fingertips through the silky brunette curls, Sherlock snuffled, spidering his long fingers through the wiry blonde hair on John’s chest.
Greg took a deep sigh and seemed to look into the glass before him, as though it might provide answers to his introspection. “You know John, it’s just possible…”
Sherlock blushed chest to ears and John had the sudden impulse to run his hands up the detective’s thighs to...comfort him in his embarrassment. He swallowed back the thought then nearly choked as Sherlock asked him another question.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in inquiry. “That’s me, John.” He coughed. “I needed to test...for a baseline. To make sure my natural scent wasn’t interfering with the results.”
Sherlock jerked the car to the side of the road and put the vehicle in park. He began to unbutton his trousers. “No. You watch. You watch me, Sherlock. I want you to see what you do to me. Your cock...
Lestrade had already tried to shoo the detective away, citing the possible contamination of the murder scene and potential infection for himself and his officers, but John thought it was more likely out of concern for the inspector’s friend. John had, of course, already attempted to put Sherlock on bed rest. Which worked for all of 6 hours, resulting in one of Sherlock’s more spectacular sulks on the couch. The detective sent John 15 texts demanding the doctor come up with a cure for the common cold since John clearly had better things to do than saving the general populace from warts and stomach ulcers. After John finished up at clinic His Highness had texted him to say that he might take John up on his advice to eat bland noodles and ingest more fluids, if
John’s tongue darted out to wet his lips and he made a decision. Gripping Sherlock’s wrist, John pulled his friend’s head down with his other hand. He inhaled the scent of his flatmate and licked a stripe across the pulsepoint of his neck. Scent was one thing, but this, taste, was even better.
Sherlock slid his eyes back over to John’s lap then darted back to his face and returned to the road.
John took a bite and moaned at the delicious flavor of the dish. When he looked up, Sherlock’s eyes were dark and he licked his lips. “What?” John asked with an apprehensive laugh. “Did she ask about me?”
John gritted his teeth against the sensation. Sherlock’s distractions were making coherent thought more than difficult. “Wait, you said last night. What did you do last night?”
“It’s perfectly normal, John,” Sherlock said dismissively, though his eyes were narrowed, undoubtedly appraising John’s widened eyes with dilated pupils. Sherlock had certainly noticed John’s state of arousal, which was frankly hard to miss. And Sherlock never missed
“You put on too much, Sherlock! Open a window for Christ's Sake. Or take a shower.” John was going to add more insults but he saw the horror stricken expression in Sherlock’s eyes and grew quiet. He was only teasing, and Sherlock was, well, Sherlock. He wasn’t normally so sensitive. John drew in a startled breath as a blush tinted Sherlock’s neck and ears crimson.
Sherlock shot out of his seat and seized John’s head with both hands, and John fought to maintain his composure in the face of Sherlock’s proximity and the pleasurable sensation of having the man’s long, cool fingers cupping his cheeks. Sherlock leaned forward with an intense expression of dissatisfaction, his runny nose inches away from John’s.
“Now I’ve done it,” John mumbled to himself, quickly making his breakfast and heading to work. Several hours later, after he still hadn’t heard anything from the cracked genius John sent him a text.
“Narrow it down? Did you see how many bottles were in that store?” John shoved his napkin on the table. A bored Sherlock was one thing. But a bored Sherlock smelling like sensual women every night indefinitely was going to a problem. And fast. John hadn’t exactly been lying when he said he’d slept with Lacy Cannes at Uni. Just that he couldn’t remember her perfume. He was just about to tell Sherlock as much when the self proclaimed eternal bachelor interrupted him.
Extraneous (?) Data: John had increased his masturbatory schedule. Now he was wanking in the shower before work in addition to at his customary nightly rituals.
John pulled Sherlock forward and pressed their foreheads together. “Now you listen to me. I have been in love with you from the moment we met.” Sherlock started to open his mouth but John interrupted him. “Shut it. From the moment we met, I knew I’d met the most amazing, brilliant man I would ever hope to meet and I
Sherlock nodded and his fingers twitched against the dash. He was completely at John’s mercy now. “Alright, you filthy creature. On one condition.”
Sherlock sucked in a breath and gazed deeply into John’s eyes with an expression so sultry John wasn’t sure it was real. “Oh,
After several minutes of arguing who should get the flannel John acquiesced, padding back into the room and sinking down next to a luxuriating cat of a man. John snickered and Sherlock cocked an eyebrow at him inquisitively. “What?” He asked defensively.
“Patience, John,” Sherlock rasped and John tried not to roll his eyes. Sherlock liked this bit where he kept John in suspense. It was practically performance art for the posh git, who clearly knew the layout of Harrods well. They rode the escalator in silence and dismounted on the 6th Floor. A sign overhead read: Salon de Parfums. Before John could inquire again Sherlock erupted in a monumental sneeze and the salespeople at the counters winced. Not in sympathy. A pretty red haired saleswoman’s fingers itched towards disinfectant spray behind her register, but seemed to be repressing the urge to blanket herself in Lysol in the hopes she wouldn’t offend her potential customers.
“Not true, John,” Sherlock asserted casually. “The human nose has the best memory of all the senses.”
“Ah! John...S-so good. Yes…Love-AH!...I’m about to come!” Sherlock chanted as finally his body drew tight and he muttered, “
Sherlock glowering at him, then added offhandedly, “we used to date, back in Uni.” Another page. Another.
Sherlock had been training John for a week to smell his person and it had become second nature to both of them. There was an established pavlovian response whenever they greeted each other. The case had already been solved of course. As soon as Lestrade called in witnesses Sherlock had deduced the culprit.
“A friend?” John perked up at that. Sherlock executing perfect control over a rare specimen of any car was not surprising--Sherlock was a fast learner about, well everything--but the idea of him having a friend at Uni, one close enough to do anything so mundane as driving a fast car was unimaginable.
“Thank you, John, That was very...informative. I will adjust the parameters appropriately.” Sherlock quickly stood up and whirled into his bedroom before John could apologize, though for what, he wasn’t sure.
“Let me hear you, John.” Sherlock said huskily and sped up again. John let out an undignified whimper and opened his eyes. Sherlock was
Sherlock’s heart shaped mouth drew thin but he resumed his machinations with the supposed “experiment”, which looked more to John like empty slides. Sherlock’s pulse fluttered on his pale neck--heart rate slightly elevated. Oh, this was going to be
sated with food before dragging him off to solve another mystery, but John had only managed to eat around a quarter of the dinner before sprinting after Sherlock. Although this case was at best a 6, as far as John could see. But then how could John know what constituted a 4 or an 8—as Sherlock seemed to keep his numeric system of interest under a tight cloak of intrigue.
the girl. I’m after a suspect that has a penchant for wielding screwdrivers into men in ballerina tutus.” Sherlock’s voice had dropped into dangerous territory but John couldn’t stop himself.
“Umm, like Sandalwood?” John nearly croaked. “And, uh...something spicy. It’s... it’s quite nice. Good on you, Sherlock.” He felt the heat in his cheeks rising to irrational proportions and turned away quickly before he could see what his answer did to his friend’s expression. “Right then. Tea?”
an excellent opportunity to smell another part of Sherlock’s anatomy. Before he could remember that perhaps Sherlock should turn around for this inspection he leaned in further towards Sherlock’s slender, pale neck. God. Jesus. The scent was intoxicating. What it must taste like. Self consciously John licked his lips. Sherlock made a little whimper and John withdrew to reconfigure his thoughts, realizing he had situated himself between Sherlock’s thighs again. He cursed as he realized he was half hard. An early night for bed then? That perfume was really good. And he had just sniffed Sherlock’s neck.
“Would you like that, sucking me?” John wanted to hear more. Sherlock’s voice was pure sex and John was beyond desperate to find out what other filthy things Sherlock might let him do.
“Yeah, alright mate. But it’s just that if Sherlock had already solved the case, he had to know what he was doing to you.”
Thankfully John saw neither delicious hide nor hair of Sherlock the next morning, grateful to avoid the awkward throat clearing and eye averting accompaniment of making breakfast. John already took himself in hand in the shower to alleviate the danger of hiding a hard on as he shuffled around his flatmate, who seemed to be doing quite a bit more sleeping than usual. How long could this continue before Sherlock caught on? Things were spiraling out of his control, and John was determined to venture into the minefield of having a crush on Sherlock Holmes with Greg later that evening. John winced in aggravation. It was more than a crush, if he was truly honest with himself. And Greg would know it, if his relationship with Mycroft was anything to go by. Those two were head over heels for one another, a development Sherlock loathed enough John was fairly certain the detective had set the D.I.’s name on a permanent delete setting from the great berk’s mind palace. And yet...Sherlock had become a beacon of brilliant light to him. His entire existence revolved around the man, for Christ’s Sakes. And now his nightly wanking. Suddenly John found himself in a resentfully foul mood as he made his way to the tube. Surely his best friend was made of more flesh and blood than he let on. After getting a good whiff of Sherlock’s actual scent, John hated the idea Sherlock would simply cover it up later to continue the blasted experiment that got them into this mess. It wasn’t as though John had never noticed the occasional waft of sandalwood from the detective. Just that he’d never been allowed to fully enjoy it or draw it into his lungs so fully until last night. Right. Don’t get a hard on in the tube, John. Focus on the severed head in the fridge, and maybe you’ll be able to get to work.
