"You see, I would, but this story has gone on long enough." Chuck said. "Ever since Castiel went and killed all my monsters, it could take years now. I'm done. And so are you."
“Send. Me. Home.” She growled. “Your brother promised me if I gave him the spear he would send me home. You lost my spear, the least you can do is get me out of here!” Sam shook his head “You can ask him yourself! He promised!”
“ It's no big deal.” She shrugged. “I wasn't exactly safe where I was anyway. A little warning wouldn't have hurt though.”
Cas glared at the demon silently, refusing to play into his games. The ride to Kenesaw was going to be the longest hour of his life.
"It's not about the fucking car!" Dean snapped, immediately sending a silent apology towards Baby before continuing. " I almost lost my best friend again. We almost lost Cas, AGAIN, Sammy. I watched Amara beat him within an inch of his life. Can you imagine what would've happened if I wasn't there? He would've died! Our friend, our brother, would've died, because we weren't there. I don't know about you, but I can't go through that again! Besides you, Cas is all I got left, and I don't want him out there on his own because he's too damn stupid to keep himself safe! So, I gotta figure out a way to keep him here, where we need him!"
Cas's eyes traveled down to his clothes the back up to meet the hunter's again. “You've been messing with my attire the entire time we've been standing here.”
“The bravest!” Adam said proudly. Then his face turned curious. “You said had. What happened to your brother?”
" No, thanks Suz!" Marie giggled. "I'm not staying long. I was just passing by when I saw the agents here and I wanted to thank them again for all their help."
Dean nodded in her direction, turning his head to Cas so he could start his grovelling session only to find him quickly walking away, phone back in hand. "You know I can probably help you with that, Cas." He said jogging up beside him.
It's funny, in a sense, how things can seem so chaotic in everyday life. Going about, day to day just like always, no distractions, no worries, and yet somehow everything just seems to jumble together, thoughts, people, events, just flying about with no rhyme or reason, everything just happening all at once. What they don't tell you, what no one ever tells you, is in times of battle, in times of true, unbridled chaos, every single second, becomes crystal clear.
"Yes." Aziraphale said, walking through the threshold, before shooting a small smile over his shoulder at Dean. "I suppose I did."
Sam was confused, to say the least, but he let Dean have another minute before he continued to explain. Whatever happened was obviously traumatic, and even though Dean was well versed in trauma, he wasn't handling it nearly as well as Sam had thought. "So, he made himself happy? And it killed him? I mean, I think that's what you're saying but…I don't…"
“Yes.” He answered. “Well... I can't really read them, it's more like pictures. I just discovered it recently. I used it to figure out what pepper wanted for her birthday. I wanted my gift to be the best, so everyone knew I was still on charge of course.”
"Why?" Crowley scoffed. "There's nothing there for me anymore. Why do you insist on saving the world when all it has done, is spit in your face for trying?"
"Ah," Garth nodded. "A lover's quarrel gone wrong." Sam stared at him in shock again, but before he could say anything Garth just tapped the end of his nose. "Heightened senses, Sam. It ain't just fear we can smell. Anyway, continue."
"Well, howdy to you too, Sam." Garth replied as he pushed his wife and three other werewolves through the door ahead of him.
"Lord Crowley!" Said one demon nervously as all of them (except one) scrambled to their feet from their poker game at the table. "To what do we owe the honor..."
"Well, you see here Cas," Dean set his beer down again and took a few slow and careful steps toward the Angel,  "you put all this effort into helping Jack make this place perfect, and you did good, but you kinda overlooked something major."
Dean sighed and shook his head, setting his coffee and book on the night stand. "I'm not pissed at Sam. I'm pissed at the situation. It was our only option, and he knew that. It's not his fault things went sideways."
Thanks again to all of you for being awesome, and sticking with me thus far! Coming soon, to a Fic near you: Secrets Revealed!
Sam nodded and slowly pulled a knife from his pocket. He had given it to Jack to protect himself after Lucifer had eaten his grace. He looked down at his hands, twirling it back and forth between his fingers as he quietly reminisced about teaching him how to throw it, watching him slice his fingers every time he tried to open it quickly, seeing how proud he was the first time he managed it without a mistake. He had given it back to Sam the day after Michael had been destroyed. He had said he wouldn't need it anymore, that he could protect himself against anything on his own again. Sam gave the knife one final squeeze before handing bit over to Rowena. “Here, uh, this was his. He cut himself on it a couple times...it...uh...it should work.”
Glancing across the room to see the only creature he had ever come to love get knocked down, barely able to pick himself up and putting everything he had into the hope that he was helping, only to be knocked down again.
" …and I would never ask you to give the damn thing up. They make you happy and I genuinely enjoy your happiness. I'm just asking you to share that happiness with me." Crowley finished.
“Sam...” Cas started. His tone was all too familiar. He was about to give Sam some stupid explanation on why he felt his actions were justified. He was going to speak to Sam as if he were a child who didn't understand something simple and needed to be told for the thousandth time. He did that a lot. He probably didn't mean to, it most likely came with the territory of being several centuries older than almost everyone around him, but Sam wasn't having any of it right now.
“Thank you.” Dean said, pressing his forehead against the angel's. “ But, ya know if you wouldn't have started this whole mess...”
'Good!' Sam thought to himself. He felt a little bad for that thought, since Kevin was now the prophet it meant that the reason no one had heard from Chuck was likely because he was dead, but at least no one else could know more about their lives than they already did. "Okay, but what does any of this have to do with Dean? Why would Cas be the reason he's acting wierd?"
And there it was. That's what it always boiled down to. Dean's sense of superiority. Yeah, sure Sammy, you can do it, but I can do it better. No Sammy, you don't know what you're doing, let me show you. No Sammy, I'll take care of this, I don't want you to get hurt. He was thirty-six god damn years old and Dean was still treating him like a fucking child! "Oh, forgive me then, for not knowing how to yell at your boyfriend properly!" Sam snapped.
Dean scoffed, satisfied that he had managed to wipe the smug look off his friend's face. "Oh, yeah? Then how come you always go around looking like Constantine's second cousin?"
Dean shook the thought from his head as he finished rinsing out the shampoo. Nope. No time for guilt. His brother and best friend were being dicks about this. He had to find some way to get them back. Maybe if he played along it would creep both of them out enough to get them to back off. Not tonight at the party of course. No need to add fuel to the fire with those ridiculous fangirls around. But if they kept it up when they got home he'd show them! Then who would be the one yucking it up?
"Right. So, you're telling me Heaven had no problem with one of its angels working together with a demon for over six thousand years because he's a good guy."
Dean shot him the bird, a little too late, before looking back over at Cas. Unlike his brother, the smile on the angel's face was sincere and thoughtful.
When Dean opened the door he was greeted by the sight of Cas, in his usual get-up, holding out his borrowed clothes in a neatly folded stack. " I assumed you would want these back." Cas said quietly, his face was unreadable.
She took his hand and shook it nervously. "I'm sorry, I just... I didn't expect you to look so....Angelic." She said shyly.
Aziraphale narrowed his eyes and shook his head. “This is about Dean, isn't it? Look, I know you've grown to care for the boy over the last few days, I have too, but we can't be expected to save every stray human that comes wandering into our midst.”
Mary just rolled her eyes. "He killed a reaper to save us, Dean. He told you he loved you when he thought he was dying." She held up her hand to stop Dean's protest. "I know he said it to all of us, but I just assumed the first one was just for you. He died for you.... Don't you see how that might be a little confusing?"
Dean looked at the other two and stepped forward, scratching the back of his head, trying to give her his most charming smile. “Uh, yeah, hi, I'm Dean. I guess you already know these two. I uh.... well the kid's not wrong. I am from another world and I really do need your help.”
Crowley finally looked at him then, his eyes filled with sincerity. "After all these centuries, and you still question it?"
"Yeah, whatever." Dean grumbled back. He tried his best to sound like he was still struggling with the decision, but he was pretty sure Cas knew he had won him over.
“I know Dean is fun and exciting,” his voice began to take on a panicked tone as he spoke, “ and I'm sorry that you find our lives so boring now, that you feel the need to go off on a suicidal crusade with a virtual stranger, but I won't allow you to put yourself in harm's way simply because you...'
I wanted more Crowley ( Fergus) but 1: would've been confusing to read and write and 2: it wasn't right. He deserves so much better than what he got and in the end it was better this way. I tried to make up for it by sort of adding the line that was cut from the show that should've been his last line. Please don't be mad. I tried.
As it turned out, there was a lot that could still surprise Newt. More than ever, he began to wonder if he would even come close to understanding the world as he stood stock still in the doorway, watching the demon's face light up with, what only could be described as, boyish glee. "There she is!" He smiled proudly. "I've missed her so, and not a scratch on her from what I can see. Good thing too." He said to Anathema. "I'd hate to have to torture you." He winked.
“I understand why you did.” Cas said. “I wasn't truthful with you. I know honesty is a problem around here and I didn't help, lying about Jack's return. I was just so focused on getting him back, I wasn't thinking about the consequences.” A small smile spread across his face. “I honestly didn't think you guys would care at the time, anyway. “
“You heard me!” Sam said, whipping around to face him. “You're a hypocrite! You got so mad at Dean when he was willing to throw himself into the ocean to keep Michael at bay, when you were doing basically the same fucking thing!”
"Like Sam said, Dean," Cas interjected "these stories are harmless. Really. We all know what our lives really are, I don't see any harm in letting people have their own creative license when we know the truth."
"You can go ahead and tell him that I'm not going anywhere until all of this is over." Cas said in a dead tone as he picked his book back up. "After that, he's all yours."
"That's all I'm asking." Sam said, patting Garth on the back as he moved on to give the rest of the hunters their assignments.
Cas walked over, glanced up in a different direction from the guitar, bland sighed. He looked at Jack with a loving smile and handed over all his tickets. " There's 100 there. You can have them. Get the inflatable instrument." He leaned in to speak so only Jack and Dean could hear him. " You can use the rest to buy some candy. I'll hide it so Sam doesn't find out."
"Actually, no." Cas snarled, tilting his head in a dangerous way. "I wasn't going to. But, because your impatient ass just has to know, now I am! You are my problem! You are always my problem! You think you were trying to save me?! You almost got everyone killed! You almost ruined everything because you couldn't trust my judgement for one minute and stay put! I got you out of here to keep you safe and you, and your damn hero complex, just couldn't handle that someone else had everything under control! I almost screwed everything up, because I was so concerned about saving you! AGAIN!"
Aziraphale gave Crowley a nervous glance, but the demon kept his eyes fixed on the man. “That's right.” Crowley nodded. “I delivered Adam. We're here to speak to him about his hospital records. If you would be so kind as to...”
The next day, the hunters gathered at the bunker, each of them helping to build his funeral pyre. They had convinced the hospital that Dean wanted to be buried in a natural way, behind his home, under a tree, by his family. It was a mess of paperwork and legal arguments, but Sam managed to get his body back home. Once the pyre was finished, a few hunters, along with Sam, wrapped him up and place him on top, along with the scraps from the Impala they managed to salvage from the junk yard. An hour after they had laid him down, after each of them had said their goodbyes, they each lit a match and threw it on the pyre, sending Dean Winchester up in the Blaze of glory he deserved. Eileen held her new baby tight in one arm, and her husband's head against her shoulder with the other as they stood and tearfully watched the flames die down, long after everyone else had left.
"WHY?!" He squeaked. She ignored him and began to speak a few foreign words before smashing the strange orb on the ground, another bright light bursting from inside and connecting itself to the one already there. "What is going on?!"
"Whoa, Dean! C'mon man!" Sam shouted over him. They didn't have time to discuss what might go wrong. Dean was being emotional and in times like this, one tiny outburst could cost them all their lives.
And Aziraphale stopped too, a few places behind him. "No." he admitted, still confused on the subject change, but wanting to answer honestly. "Not at all. Not one bit." He was a shell of a man. The fight and fire he had when he landed in Aziraphale’s shop seemed nothing more than a distant memory. He was lifeless, going through the motions without any true motivation. It was jarring, to say the least. Seeing a man, who was once filled with seemingly impossible hope, a beacon of light in the shadowy darkness of certain death, now so utterly.... broken.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean yelled, causing the others to flinch. He turned on his heel and made towards the bunker but Sam stepped in front of him."Out of the way, Sam!" He growled pushing against him.
“Yeah, I don't think he would, Cas!” Sam couldn't hold it in anymore. He had opened the can of worms now, he might as well pour 'em out. “Look, I know we don't really talk about it, mostly I think it's because Dean likes to pretend it didn't happen, but he didn't do so well after Lucifer killed you. It's like he couldn't even talk about it. He wasn't acting like himself. I tried to get him to do anything he usually does. He was taking it out on Jack. He wouldn't even give the kid a chance. He just gave up. You didn't see it because when you came back it was like nothing had ever happened, but I'm telling you man, I don't think Dean could've handled that again!”
Both girls scrambled to take his hand, shaking it vigorously with both of theirs "Oh, my God Bahn-Bahn! it's really him. Oh my God, I could die happy right now!"
It was habit, at this point, walking down that particular hallway every day to swing by Castiel's room to check on him. It wasn't until he was halfway there, that Crowley remembered it was no longer necessary. Not only was the angel fully healed, but he had also buggered off without a trace after his and Dean's argument. That's why he found himself doubling back after passing the room, because there was no way he had actually seen him in there. He was pleasantly surprised to learn he was wrong.
Amara swallowed and turned her gaze downwards. "Since my release, I have learned to love his creation as he once did. I have learned to appreciate the beauty of his work...."
"Well," Aziraphale said glancing over at Crowley, "I don't see the harm in staying a few more hours. "It would be pointless to open up the shop in so late in the morning and travel does tend to make one peckish."
" Sure is kid. " Dean chuckled. he grabbed a sponge off the edge of the sink and nodded his head toward the door. " Now go get, cleaned up and I'll see you in a bit, Kay?"  Jack gave him a single nod and March out of the kitchen, smiling ear to ear. Dean turned his attention to the little bit of dishes in the sink, completely unaware Cas had yet to leave the room, until the angel appeared next to him.
"It's true." Amara coughed, staggering in place. Chuck turned a pained look to his sister, staring at her in awe. "Brother, I love you, but you need to be stopped. You have to stop."
Dean stopped, his mouth snapping shut. His eyes were wild and wide as he processed the words that just came out of a god-damned angel's mouth. " E...excuse you?" There was no way he just heard that right.
"What did you do, Cas?" Dean demanded, shaking his shoulder. "Hey! Look at me! You're not making any sense! What did you do?!"
Dean gave Sam  a smug look, not really  hearing the words his friend was saying past conformation that he thought the girl was pretty. "See, Sammy? She's perfect."
But he couldn't move. He needed to hear it for himself, straight out of Dean's mouth. He needed to know how hopeless he really was.
Dean pushed back his chair and pulled himself up leaning over to give her a hug, followed quickly by Sam. "Thank you." Sam said as soon as both brothers let go.
"There are fates worse than death, Aziraphale." Crowley said grimly, as he began walking again. "The Almighty promised that fate to Castiel, for messing with his plan. Dean may have saved him from that, but in turn is suffering said fate himself." He opened the door leading to the archive room beyond the dungeon, lowering his voice to avoid being overhead by its current occupants as he began riffling through the boxes. "I screwed up, Angel. I thought of we could help them take down the Almighty, we could avoid death all together, but seeing such raw, ruthless power first hand.... I'm afraid I've doomed us to so much worse." He pulled out the witch's orb containing the portal, poised to smash it on the floor, when Aziraphale placed his hand over the demon's stopping him.
"I am not a coward." He repeated, causing them both to fall on their asses as he stood. "I am God! I gave you life, and I can take it away as I choose!" Another, slightly stronger burst of power struck him across the face, just before Aziraphale spoke.
“Oh, shit.” Dean chuckled, stretching himself out. “ Guess we didn't really think this whole thing through, huh?”
"That's it! You've lost your internet privlages, pal!" Dean scolded. He then whipped around and pointed an angry finger at a hysterical Sam "You too! No case, no net!"
"Yep." Mare said proudly. "They've been inseparable since day one." She then looked over to Dean with a michevious smile. "I guess you can say they drew inspiration from art." She winked.
"What the fuck does that mean?" Dean snapped, furious that apparently everybody except him (and Claire) knew what was going on.
Sam looked at them in shock for half a second then effortlessly shifted into botch face #5. “Save it, Dean. I know what you're doing.” He said. “ Gay chicken isn't gonna work on us.”
"Look," Dean said, cutting him off, "I really appreciate you guys checking up on me and everything and letting me vent or whatever, but if it's any difference to you, I just kinda wanna be alone right now, okay."
Cas nodded, pulling his hand from the hunter's head. " My apologies, Dean. I fear that is the best I can do for you right now. I do not have the time to get rid of the bodies."
"She's imprisoned, now." Cas said defiantly, though the fear was still dancing behind his eyes. "Duma saw to that, before I disposed of her."
“Most of the time it's just yelling at each other until one of them throws a punch or walks away.” Sam shrugged.
"Enough." Dean sobbed. "Sam you couldn't have done anything, so please just…" Sam met his eyes, the silent question hanging in the air. Dean took a deep breath and tried to find the right words. "It took Cas because they had a deal. That's how he summoned the damn thing. He finished the deal."
“What were you listening to?” Kaia asked as walked passed Cas and wandered farther into the room, kicking various liquor bottles aside as she moved.
"That's...really good to hear." Dean chuckled. He had no idea what he was so concerned about. These weren't fragile women by any means. They probably could hold down the cabin by themselves and ride out the end of the world right here without batting an eye.
“I'm serious, Rowena.” Sam lifted his head to meet her eyes. “ I mean the guy spent his entire life in Heaven following the will of God. He's dedicated the past ten years to searching for his father and protecting his creations. He tried to raise the son of Lucifer to follow God's plan for Christ’s sake, only to watch him kill the kid out of pettiness. If anyone should give up, it's Cas.”
"Cas, wait!" Dean called. He tried to launch himself out of bed to go after him, but it hurt. It hurt like Hell.
They pulled apart and Dean mussed his hair before guiding him over to the edge of the bridge. "Welcome home, little brother." He said, as the two of them stared out over the water, finally at peace.
"Hey, hey no. None of that." Gabriel said, grabbing Cas by the shoulder and giving him a gentle shake. "Look, even if you did go crazy with power, you were still a better God than Dad ever was. You made sure all the bad people were taken care of. You wiped out a bunch of self-righteous assholes who were doing nothing more than creating even more self-righteous assholes. I mean, you could've been a little less smitey about it, but you got the job done. That's more than dad ever did."
Castiel stood silent for a second, letting his breath even out. "Dean. You're shouldering a great burden. The fate of the world rests in the hands of you and your brother. I am the least of your concerns."
I think I've figured out my problem with my inconsistent posting schedule. It's not that I don't want to write! I just have a hard time getting through the angsty chapters so it takes me longer to write. Gotta be it. Totally not a scatter brain. Nope.
"Nothing!" Dean shouted, still looking around. At least Dean tried to look concerned but he wasn't about to believe that he hadn't done anything to make Cas fly off again. "We were just talking and then he yelled at me to run and then he just fucking disappeared!"
Rowena opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off by the sudden whoosh of wings and the image of a very stressed out angel marching across the library.
Dean shifted in his chair, confirming the lack of pain in his back that he should definitely be feeling. “Alright, first, wanna tell me what the hell you are?”
"I'm a fucking idiot. That's what." Dean marched back over to Jack and grabbed him by the shoulder, pushing him down the hall. "Come with me kid." He turned his head back towards Mary before they left the room. " I mean it, mom. Don't let Cas walk out that door, whatever it takes." Before Mary could ask any more
" Yeah, I'm still a little woozy." Dean admitted. "I think I'm gonna go lie down." He started shuffling towards the door, "I'll be in my room if anyone needs me." he added over his shoulder, hoping to get the message across to who it was meant for.
“Speak for yourself, Grandpa." Dean scoffed. "I'm in the prime of my life!" He wasn't too old to hunt. He probably would never get to the point where he would be. But when he saw the sad look on Jack's face he couldn't help himself. " Maybe you're right though, Sammy. It'd probably be good for us to take a break every once in a while. Enjoy the riches of our spoils, er, whatever."
Sam finally closed his mouth and shoved away from the bar, awkwardly fumbling over his words. " I...uh....I'm ...I gotta....go...to the...bathroom.." He managed  to get out before scurrying  away.
"Guess when you made everything in your image, you didn't expect your creations to fight back." Came another, almost equally unfathomable voice to the right.
“Crowley, please!” Aziraphale scolded, to which Crowley replied by sticking out his tongue (wait! Was his tongue forked?) Aziraphale rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to Dean. “I'm afraid I have no idea as to how you got here, young man. If I did, I can assure you I wouldn't waste my time asking you a question I already know the answer to. Though, I can't say the same for you. Are you entirely sure that you don't know how you got here?”
“You're welcome, Jack.” She said rubbing his back. “ I'll be back soon, okay?” Jack nodded and let go. Then Mary turned to Dean and Cas. “Boys.” she nodded with a smile.
a key if he really wanted to leave. He could probably just use his angel juice to hijack one of the cars. That fear was quickly washed away though when they reached the garage and saw all the vehicles parked in their respective spots.
"I guess I'll stay here and try to contact the other hunters." Sam said. "I'll get on the circuit, see who's still alive, tell the ones that are to meet here as soon as possible, so we can make a game plan."
And so begins the downward spiral. I'm starting to get to the core of my original plan for this story, finally. Unfortunately I also keep coming up with more things to add ....
The beautiful house was decorated, wall to wall, with every type of sigil they had ever seen. There were bits and pieces of all the different spells and potions they had ever used scattered around the place and several ( hopefully fake) guns, stakes and knives along the walls.
"I won't be for long." Cas let out a mirthless chuckle. "I told you, it wanted revenge. Apparently, death was far too easy. It told me it wouldn't take me then. It said it wanted me to forget about it, forget about the deal, to know true happiness. Relief. Just so it could tear it away from me."
Sam could feel Cas tense up, more than he could see it, and after already having suffered an irate seraph for the past few days he figured, now would probably be a good time to find himself anywhere but here. "I'm uh... I'm gonna go check on Rowena and Kaia. Let them know that dinner's soon. Make sure they don't need anything." He quickly made his way down the hall, refusing to look back.
“Yeah,” Dean continued “and I made my friend really mad by not listening to him, so he pushed me. He didn't mean to push me into the portal to your world, it was an accident, but he did. And that's how I got stuck here.”
He crossed the room and, carefully, set the blade down on a table, before turning back to Dean. "You seem to have a lot of questions, young man, and I'm afraid I might not have any answers you would like, though I will try my best. However, as it were, you are the one who has invaded my home, so, as one can assume, I have a few questions of my own and I feel that it is only right that you answer mine first. For starters, how is it that a human, such as yourself, came across a heavenly object that I, myself, have never even seen?" Dean stood frozen, remaining silent. " Well? Out with it."
This time Amara left Dean to meet Castiel across the room, shoving him up the wall with her powers, further and further as she approached, until his head hit the ceiling as he screamed out in agony. "And maybe I don't have time for you."
Cas reached up and placed his hand on Dean's left shoulder, right where his hand print used to be and looked him in the eyes. "Thank you, Dean. You're my best friend as well." Then he pulled Dean in close placing his lips scant inches from the hunter's ear. "But your brother's right. You should probably try to make it sound less like you're in love with me."  Then he laughed, slapping Dean on the shoulder and walking in the direction of the diminishing crowd.
"I'm not some damsel in distress, dude." He scoffed. " I don't need you to carry me out of the dragon's lair bridal style and take me to your steed. My legs work fine."
Cas took his hand and lifted his chin, forcing the hunter to look him in the eyes. " Dean. I have, literally, walked through Hell for you. I gave up everything I knew and cared about at your command. I have destroyed Heaven and Earth to keep you safe, and I do not, for one second, regret any of it, because I believe you are the one who saved me. If anyone is at someone else's mercy here, it's me. I don't expect anything in return but your honesty and understanding. You have given me so much already; I couldn't think to ask for anything more. Saving you was more of an act of selfishness on my part, than a quest for reward. No other angel will ever love a human as much as I love you, because no other human is you, and I'm not letting you go. No other angel would be willing to give everything they have, including their life, as I am willing to give you, because it is the very least I can do. What happened in that field cannot and will not be repeated because what this is, is completely unique. There will never be an instance where what I did for you will be necessary again. However, a less extensive procedure could arise, and it would be wise to have some knowledge on the matter."
“Cas ain't no wimp.” Dean growled. Aziraphale stopped laughing immediately. “Sure, he can be a kinda stupid sometimes, and yeah he gets sad over stuff and whatever, but that don't make him pathetic! He's a total bad ass. He could kick your ass with both wings tied behind his back and not even break a sweat!”
"You fucking better not." Dean sniffed again. Unwilling to let go. "If you stop trying to fight the rest of the world to save my sorry ass it should be easy."
Cas threw whatever was in his hands on the bed with a huff and stormed past them. " I'll be in the library waiting while you say your good-byes."
"Not knowing what you feel is you or me." Cas finished. "You don't want another human to feel like they're at the mercy of the angel who saved their life because of some bond. Like they owe the angel something. You don't want someone else to be as unsure of themselves as you currently feel."
did get the chance to sit down and write....basically i wrote erased and rewrote this chapter like four times. It still didn't turn out the way i wanted  it to but i'm kind of loosing my mind looking at the damn thing (which is why you will probably notice quite a few spelling and grammar errors. I will fix them soon, i promise, but i swear if i have to read this chapter one more time this week i might delete the whole thing!)
"Were still brothers." Dean shrugged. "You're my family. I love you. Just because I don't wanna spend the rest of my life hopping around the country, sharing nasty motel rooms and ganking monsters with you anymore, doesn't mean I don't love you. I will always be there for you when you need me. Always, you understand? I just dont wanna keep risking life every damn day anymore."
"How do you know?" Sam watched as Dean leaned back and scrubbed his hands over his face. "You never told me how he saved you. You said that he summoned the Empty, but you never explained how or why it took him and Billie, but left you. Maybe if I was here, we could've figured it out, without him…"
*Edit: I remember now! Thanks to a wonderful reader. For those of you strictly in the GO fandom who don't know: it is not a true Destiel fic until Sam Winchester interrupts a moment! (Hell it's hardly a real episode featuring Castiel unless Sam interrupts a moment). So I had to put one in there, I'm just sorry that it fell on the husband's this time.
"We haven't much choice in the matter!" Crowley snapped back, tightening his grip on the orb. "Odds are he'll keep one of us alive to suffer and I don't want that! I have suffered enough, and I certainly don't want that for you. I can't bear the thought, Angel. I can't..."
It was important to him, for several reasons. It was the first real gift he had ever received. He was an angel, a soldier. Another tool in the arsenal of Heaven whose sole purpose was to follow his orders and fight in the name of the Lord. If he failed, he could be replaced. He was no more important that any other screw or bolt that could be found in the box. Certainly not worthy of receiving any praise or reward. So, when Dean had given it to him, even as casually as he did, it was nothing short of monumental in the angel's eyes.
"Yeah, yeah, no, it's fine!" Dean said pulling his sleeve over the bandage and sitting up in his bed. "Don't worry about it! What happened next?"
"No." Cas shook his head, squeezing his pseudo son once before grabbing him by the shoulders and holding him firmly at arm's length. "No, Jack I'm sorry. None of this is on you. I should've taken better care of you. I should have paid more attention to the signs that you were faltering. This isn't your fault. It's mine. I made a promise to protect you and I failed, because of my own selfish wants. Don't you dare take this on yourself." Jack nodded, his face still scrunched up in guilt, but he made no attempt to argue. "Now I need one of you to explain, just what the hell is going on? How are the two of you even awake?"
Kaia let her head fall to the side trying to look over her shoulder. “What about him?” She asked, pointing her eyes at where Cas was laying.
“No....” Anathema said shaking her head. Then a sly smile began to creep over her face. “But we may just have the next best thing!”
"Tell us about what?" Dean asked from behind Billie. He looked back and forth between the three of them, his face scrunching up in concern. "What's going on here?"
So when i started this fic, I fully intend for it to be quick and simple. I wanted Crowley and Aziraphale to to help Dean get home so he could have a fluffy moment with cas.
"Dean, there's nothing we can do!" He said, pulling further back to used his feet to push them further away. Dean was trying to use his own feet as an anchor to keep them in place, pulling at Sam's arms and pushing against his hold to free himself. "There's nothing we can do. We have to get out of here!"
“Right.” Aziraphale smiled at him sadly. It was a look Dean was used to, when someone was to tired to argue with his stubbornness. A look of someone who had very little hope. “Let's be off then.”
"Stop it!" Aziraphale scoffed. "Yes. I hadn't even thought about it until we were in there with Dean, and then I realized, I've never actually said the words. The world is ending, all of existence is as a matter of fact, and I realized, we might very well die without me ever telling you that I love you."
“Can’t say he'll feel the same.” Dean replied pulling his hand back and squeezing them between his thighs. “He and Sam weren't too thrilled with me when I left. I doubt either of them are really upset that I'm gone.”
"A rather large one at that." Cas shrugged as well, looking jarringly naked in just some sleep pants and a threadbare band shirt as he piled food onto a plate. "Plenty of room to escape."
"He's fine now though, right?" Crowley asked, gripping the angel’s hand tighter and leading them back down the hall. "He can go find Castiel and they can live their happily ever after and that blubbering fool can leave the rest of us the hell alone?"
Dean flung his arm around the Angel before he could escape and squeezed him as tight as he could. "Don't you dare." Dean said. "Don't you dare leave me again. I asked you not to leave me the last time I saw you. I asked you to stay and you left me anyway. Don't you dare ever leave me again."
"Well, I also had your pornography." Cas added, tracing his fingers over Dean's chest. "You have quite an extensive collection."
Today is a two chapter day. Partially because I feel like they should be read together, partially because I want to get past the party. Mostly because I keep running out of time and gaining story....
Cas looked down at his lap, trying his best to hide the shy smile creeping over his face. " It would appear that my wings were not the only thing that was restored. I felt it best to use all the tools at my disposal in order to find you."
A single angel can smite entire cities with barely a thought and yet, here were several, barely singeing a hair on the Almighty's head.
He quickly shook those thoughts from his mind. It's fine. It's gonna be okay. They were gonna figure out a way to fix it. To fix everything. Because Cas deserved to be happy, dammit. Dean deserved to be happy. They all did. And he would be damned if anything was gonna stand in their way this time. That was his final thought as he drifted off into a dreamless sleep, for the first time in days.
"How long has he been this miserable? Is that why he's been so careless... because he thinks he's invincible? Because he thinks he can't be happy?" Dean muttered as he let the angel push him through the halls.
Dean opened the driver's side door, urging Cas to scoot over and settled in behind the wheel while the other two piled in back. They drove into the garage in silence, everyone to tired and beaten to strike up any type of conversation. Even Crowley, who was admittedly less worn out that the rest, kept his mouth shut. What would any of them even say? "Wow, it's a fucking mess out there!"? "Anybody else think we're totally screwed?" Nobody was willing to admit that they were all thinking that, so they just drove on in silence. He parked Baby in her usual spot and got out to wave Jody into an open one. He was glad none of the other hunters had managed to find the entrance to the garage. Sure, a mess of cars parked in front of an old, abandoned building, in the middle of nowhere, at the dawn of the end time was just about as conspicuous as you could get but he would want any of those grunts coming in here and scratching up all these classic cars trying to find a spot to park. It was silly, he knew, but these cars had become like children to him and he didn't think he could handle anything happening to them, no matter how dangerous things were outside. The simple things in life were all they had to hold on to anymore.
"In case what, Sam?!" Dean snapped. "God's gone, Meg's the new Devil, we got Gabe ruling the top floor with Jack making whatever monsters Cas didn't gank into new flyboys... as far as I'm concerned, we don’t got shit to worry about anymore!"
"He was hoping to get an earlier start to the day. I believe he had his heart set on a museum and since the drive would have taken a little longer, I think he was disappointed about your late arrival this morning."
"So?" Cas asked, holding his arms out. "Is this acceptable party wear? Or perhaps you would like to compare me to another distant relative of a lesser known comic book character?"
"Ever heard of a newspaper? Figure it out! Now, let's get back to the room so we can get this damn thing over with." Dean jammed the key into the ignition and revved Baby's engine a couple times for good measure, to assert his manliness.
Aziraphale straightened up, giving the demon a slightly annoyed look at, what must've been, some secret innuendo and shook his head. He tried his best not to smile at the demon's ridiculous joke as he addressed Dean. “Very well then, if the two of you wouldn't mind joining me in the back room, we have quite a bit to discuss in regard to our new friend here.” He turned on his heel and began walking away while the other two followed before pausing. “ Oh, and Crowley, dear, please take off those sunglasses of yours. It's far too dark back there for you have them on.”
Crowley smiled, lacing his own finger together and placing his elbows together, resting his head atop his hands. "I'm sure Castiel must have informed you of what happened between you two as he spent so much of his energy trying to heal you."
Had to add that little tidbit about gay monkeys and nitrous oxide from the book. It's one of my favorite lines.
“Perhaps Dean would like to take in a few sights, or something.” Aziraphale explained. ”He is American after all. A museum or something.”
"Dean...I..." Cas's words came out in a reverent whisper, echoing in Dean's ears, ripping him apart knowing they were the last thing he would ever hear his angel say.
"Whatever you say, Sam." Garth shrugged. "It's gonna take some convincing on my part, but we'll do our best."
"No." Dean said, pushing back. "We're  not doing that. What did Jack mean. What aren't you telling us?"
"You really know how to make a girl blush." She laughed. "Wait did I hear you say Gadreel? Like THE Gadreel. The angel who toppled Eden? That Gadreel?"
“Some do.” Rowena said, stepping forward. “Not all of them are visible from the outside, is all.” She stepped up to Anathema, sizing her up as she rounded her. “Did I hear that correctly? You're a witch?”
Castiel deflated a bit and let out a sigh, shifting his gaze to the floor. "No, I'm sorry. I'm just.... it's as you said. I'm just... apprehensive about the task at hand, is all."
If you came here thinking this wasn't gonna go anywhere in terms of actual Destiel drama, I hate to break it to you, but you're wrong. Sorry, not sorry, but I promise it gets better than their regular " Cas Dean bitch fest" that goes no where.... you'll see.
idly by, twiddling our thumbs, instead of chasing after the things that make our lives worth living? So, yes. Move in with me. Let's spend the rest of our lives together, getting on each other's nerves until one, or both of us is gone. I've never wanted anything more." Crowley smiled, receiving a find smile in return. "Also, quit interrupting me. It's just rude."
"That's a good thing, isn't it?" Dean said, only a little disappointed. "Means your almost back to normal right?"
Dean could feel the hand on his sleeve tighten at that remark as he watched Crowley step forward, straightening himself out before he spoke. " Anthony J. Crowley. Demon." He introduced himself. The room was dead quiet for about five seconds before another roar of laughter took it over.
“I'm sure Dean has seen much worse.” Aziraphale dismissed as he kept walking. “He's been to Hell and back after all. I hardly think it will disturb him. I wouldn't want you to hurt your eyes, straining to see in the dark.”
“They are.” Adam smiled back. “They just forget sometimes. So,” he turned back to Dean, “how are you going to get back?”
"But he wasn't right." Another argument came. "He promised us freedom and instead he led us to destruction!"
"Jack chose me as his father before he was born." Cas sighed irritability. "I don't have time to explain all of this. Will you help us or not?"
"Uh, yeah...about that..." Sam said, looking around the room at the other hunters. This wasn't a good place to break the news. Too many people to get caught in Dean's line of fire. "You mind if we talk somewhere else?"
"And don't think for a second, if we have problems of our own, we won’t be dragging you down with us. " Crowley added. "I think it's fair to say, you owe us one."
What the actual fuck?! Dean's eyes shot open and he barely had a second to register what Cas has said before a pair of plush, cracked lips were crashing into his.
“Yeah, Cas and Dean are friends,” Sam mumbled “but I gotta be honest with you they haven't been on the best of terms lately. They've been more likely to kill each other than help each other out for a while now.”
“Nah,” Dean smirked, ignoring Anathema's warning, “I got a pretty dangerous job. It takes up a lot of my time. I don't really have the energy for a girlfriend or anything like that.”
"Alright," he said as the group entered the war room " I'm starving. What's everyone thinking for lunch?"
Crowley turned around and rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest as he leaned against the sink. "None of us 'chose' to fall, Angel. It's not like there was a group of us sitting around, chatting it up saying 'Oye! Yeah, Heaven's great and all, what with the perfect, clean, shiney wonders of it all, but you know what would make it even better? Fire an brimstone! I bet if we add some tortured souls and endless screaming, maybe a few dark pits and dank caverns it would be great!' No! We just made a few, unappreciated, comments and the Almighty picked us up and tossed us down, getting rid of the taint on his perfect little world."
"Mmmmhmm, sure..." Marie rolled her eyes then leaned close to Sam and spoke from the side of her mouth "subtext..." Sam had to stiffle a laugh.
Mary turned to Dean with her arms crossed over her chest and eyebrow raised. " What was that all about."
“Smooth.” Crowley murmured under his breath as he passed the angel his jacket. “Come on then Mr. Cobain. Let's go find you something a little less lumberjacky, shall we?” He walked passed and tapped Dean's shoulder, urging him up.
There it was. The reason he was upset. He felt like Dean was embarrassed of him. Of what they had. He didn't want to be a secret, but he went along with it anyway, because that's what Dean wanted. Always what Dean wanted.
"Aziraphale." He said, stepping out to shake Sam's hand. " It's a pleasure to meet you Sam. Dean's told us so much about you." He smiled brightly between the other two after releasing Sam's hand.
"I am." Crowley assured. "Besides we would all be a hell of a lot worse off if it weren't for Castiel here."
"I'm not letting you go alone!" Dean shouted, then looked down, lowering his voice and shuffling his feet. "It's just.... can't we drive? You know I hate flying."
"Yeah about that," Dean said, stuffing a couple of pieces of bacon from the plate Cas handed him into his mouth, "what's the deal? They ever going home or…"
“Given Dean's surly nature, I'd assume you would be the sibling to have a kinder disposition.” He continued, staring over the rim of his glasses at the open page. “ It just goes to show you that even with years of knowledge, it is foolish to make assumptions, even when based on experience.”
"Oh, I see." Dean scoffed. "So, rebuilding, Heaven was more important than letting your family know you were okay. Got it."
Crowley slid back, hands up in surrender. "I'm merely making sure that you are alright. Like I said, we were all rather worried about you." Cas rolled his eyes, like he didn't believe him. " Dean, in particular..."
“Awesome!” Dean exclaimed, turning to Aziraphale and Crowley. “Now you guys can get back after this whole mess is over!”
The fact that John had dragged them into the life for her sake, not to mention the way he treated them growing up, it wasn't sitting well with her at all. " I never wanted this for you boys." She said, wiping away tears. "It's all my fault. And your father....that is not the man I married. He was a good man. He loved you boys. I can't believe he would...."
"Is that what you've been doing then?" Aziraphale said, distracting Chuck long enough for Cas to crawl across the floor to the Winchesters' sides. "Just creating more and more world's, abandoning them when you feel something has gone wrong, until you get it right?"
"A few minutes, tops." She answered. "We can have it finished with time to spare if I have absolute silence."
Dean turned his head to see the others standing behind him, questioning looks on all their faces. “Hey guys.” Dean smiled and slid beside Adam placing his arms around his and Anathema's shoulder to show that they were safe. “This is Anathema and Adam. They're the ones who helped us get here.” He crouched down beside Adam and pointed to the other others. “Adam this is my family. They're aliens too.”
"But friends make secrets." Crowley whispered in his ear with a wink, his tongue sticking out of his smile in an air of defiance.
Crowley opened his mouth (to make a smart ass remark no doubt) but thankfully was interrupted by an affronted Sam. "Wait! Why do you get Cas?"
Rowena sighed and rolled her eyes, turning another page. “It means, Samuel, that you calling our dear Castiel a hypocrite, is just about the biggest case of 'the pot calling the kettle black' there has ever been.” Sam opened his mouth to respond, but Rowena wasn't finished. “You know for someone as brilliant as yourself, you are increasingly dense.”
Cas was losing his frickin mind next to him. "He's right, Dean." The angel gasped out between laughs. "Another nephilim would be most dangerous. Though, I suppose it wouldn't be a problem considering neither of us has a womb." He was doubled over at this point. "Unless there's something you aren't telling me!"
Poor Sam. They had made such progress over the years. They had become even closer, they had become genuinely happy. It was a bittersweet realization what had happened. He must have gotten into a terrible wreck on his way to meet his nephew. He felt awful that he had died the night the baby was born, but there was nothing he could do about it now. He hoped his brother would forgive him.
Aziraphale relaxed slightly, though it wasn't Crowley's poor attempt at humor that was keeping him on edge. "Dean said he doesn't think any of us will be coming out of this alive."
Cas huffed a small laugh and sat up. “ No, but if you do not wish anybody to question why you are leaving my quarters in the early hours of the morning, then I suggest you retire to your own.”
"Stop." Dean half shouted, causing Sam to jump. He took a breath and tried again, a little calmer. "Stop, Sam. Just…stop. There's nothing you could have done."
"Tell me something I don't know." She smiled back as he set her down. "Now let's go get the others. I'd say it's about time we get this show on the road."
" Please?" It was wrong. Dean knew it was wrong. He had figured out a while ago he could get Cas to do just about anything if he asked him a certain way. He had been using that tidbit for years now, for little things here and there, but he always felt guilty for it after (though he'd never admit to it.) He never used it for big things like this though, mostly because he didn't think he could live with himself after. It wasn't right at all to manipulate Cas this way, but the guy was a sucker for human emotions, he hated seeing his friends hurt, and it's not like he could tell the difference between real hurt and faking it, but hey, Dean had already broken a big personal rule by bringing up Naomi, so might as well pull out all the stops. He dragged his bottom lip between his teeth with his tongue while he looked the angel in the eyes as he bit down enough to cause some pain. That, coupled with thinking about every sad thing he possibly could on the spot, was enough to make Dean's eyes well up, just enough to make it look like he could start to cry.
“Forgive me for wanting to believe that the creator of the universe has more in store for me than simply being a pawn in some sick game, my dear.” Aziraphale responded. “Besides, even if what Dean here says is true who's to say this... 'Chuck' was it?” Dean nodded. “Right. Who's to say this 'Chuck' fellow, is the same as our Almighty? Who is decidedly more feminine, I might add.”
As soon as Cas within reach he grabbed the angel by the lapels with his left hand and pulled him in, placing his right hand on the back of the other's head. Not wanting to lose his nerve he waisted no time closing the distance between them.
“Not that it's any of my business...” Rowena said, as if reading his mind. To be honest, Sam had almost forgotten she was there. She had stayed completely silent through the whole ordeal, most likely out of fear, but now her usual confidence was shining through her words. Sam looked up at her, exasperated by his argument with Cas and not really on the mood to hear anyone's opinion. She was back to thumbing through The Book of the Damned, which really didn't help Sam's irritation. “But it seems to me that the angel has developed a serious case of 'Winchesteritus'.” Sam raised a questioning eyebrow at her, waiting for further elaboration. She glanced up for a moment and clicked her tongue. She shook her head, looking back down at the book before she continued. “Well it's not as if you boys are the poster children for 'self-preservation'. You do have a nasty habit of sacrificing yourselves for what you believe to be the greater good. It seems that your friend is merely following the example that was set for him.”
"Nothing, mom." Dean replied as he walked over to the sink to rinse out his cup. " I'm just tired of Sam being a nosey little shit, that's all."
He didn't need to ask directions this time. He somehow knew exactly where to go. He drove down the road at top speed and came to a stop in the middle of a bridge. He got out and took a minute to appreciate the beauty of the river and forest below. This was his life now. Forever. Peaceful and free. The only thing that was missing…
Sam wanted nothing more, than to tell Dean that he should have learned his lesson the first time with the Angel. It wasn't like he didn't like Castiel. Of course he did. He was appreciative of everything the guy had done for them. Dean was right that he had saved their asses more than once. It was just….at the end of the day, whether they liked him or not, Castiel had betrayed them. He understood that perfectly. What he couldn't understand, was why dean was so suprised by him doing it again. Hell, Dean had been the one to bring up that fact that the guy wasn't acting right since he got back and yet, there he was, praying to him, putting his trust in him again. It was maddening, to say the least. He had tried to talk to his brother about it, but Dean immediately shut down.
"You really went all out, Marie!" Kristen said pulling her into a hug. "This is amazing! Thank you!"
"Hmm." Aziraphale hummed with a quirked brow, trying to look like he was still busy reading (he had lost interest in the book halfway through the conversation, but, well, appearances). "I seem to recall you saying something similar to me during Sodom and Gomorrah."
"I gave her back to you Dean." She pouted. "You gave me back my family, so I gave you back yours. It's hardly my fault you couldn't keep her alive. Isn't that right Castiel." She sneered in the angel's direction, causing him to curl up on himself slightly.
Maeve turned to apologise to Marie when Dean spotted something behind her ear. "Is that an anti-possesion tattoo?" He asked.
Cas was silent for a moment,  before dropping his head to stare at his hands. "Those women. Their love for each other is so pure, so beautiful. It radiates from their very cores and shines so bright....that was my father's intention when he created humanity. To love each others as he loved you." He paused. "Of all the human emotions I have experienced in my time on earth....I fear love like that will always elude me. I thought I knew what it was to have love....but that was just obedience....I have fallen in so many ways. By all rights, I have experienced just about everything humanity has to offer. But love like that....I suppose it is just not in the cards for me with the life I have chosen."
“You know what? It's fine.” Dean said. “Don't get me wrong, I'm fucking pissed, but I get it, man. I haven't exactly been the most honest person myself, ya know. We really gotta stop all this lying to each other bullshit.”
A moment later Adam came back out the door and started walking away. “Jasmine Cottage isn't too far from here. Follow me.” They walked for about half a block before Dean noticed Adam starting up at him, and cocked his head in silent question. ”Is there an America on your world?” He asked.
I promise this is going somewhere soon. I just have to get this intro chapters out. Thank you so much for sticking with me!
But he had failed Jack as well. He had failed Jack, Kelly, Heaven, and Sam, just as he had failed Dean. He was furious with the hunter, sure. Jack was, arguably the most powerful and dangerous entity in the history of creation, but he was still a child! He had no concept on how to control his own powers. It was their responsibility to teach him right from wrong. Mary's death was an accident that they were all to blame for. They all knew something was off with him after he had destroyed Michael. Locking him away in a box, without his consent, for all eternity, without consulting Cas... killing him...it wasn't the answer. What's worse was the fact that Dean was willing to die to make sure Jack was killed. He was willing to ignore what losing both of them would do to their loved ones because he was too stubborn to let anyone else find a more viable solution. So, yes, Cas was mad at him.
Dean nodded in solidarity. Been there, smelled that. He decided that he kinda liked this guy. He came off as a snob (Dean assumed it was part of an act) but it was in such a crazy, charming way that it was almost impossible not to get sucked in. He gave off an air of nonchalance that could only be faked, which made Dean think that he probably actually cared too much. He could relate to that. “So, let me ask you a question.” Dean said through a bite of toast.
"Yeah, well.... you're wrong!" Dean finished his prep and started spooning the mixture into the seared breasts. " And as for Cas... he's just... he's Cas. He's my best friend. I mean yeah, he's great, like really great, and we've been through hell and back together, but that's all there is. He's not my angel, he's not my...whatever you think he is... he's just Cas." He placed the chicken on a baking pan and popped it in the oven before setting the timer. Then he leaned against it and crossed his arms. "I'm not like that anyway. I dig chicks. I can't speak for Cas, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen him wavin a rainbow flag either so...there." Crowley just stared back at him in silence tapping his fingers over the counter top. "What?!" Dean demanded.
“Very well, then.” Aziraphale sighed “If that's how you want to play this.” He grabbed another chair, placing it front of Dean, and sat down, crossing one leg over the other, neatly laying his hands on his knee. “Ask away.”
Dean turned around to smile a Bobby, a warm feeling of content flooding him to his core. "I think I'll go for a drive." He said.
"No offense, auntie Am, but you're not exactly most likely to be named homecoming queen of the sky kingdom." Gabe laughed. "You did quite a bit of damage up there, and last time I checked you fit in more with the ...evil variety. They don't take to kindly to your type."
The screen faded out as the lights went up. There was hardly a dry eye in the place. Marie stood up and began speaking. Surely giving a speech about the power of love or a few words about the girls but all Dean could focus in was the hand that hadn't moved from his shoulder since Kristen's scene from the play.
Cas pulled Jack into a hug, squeezing him with all he had. "I love you Jack."  He released the boy from his arms, but kept his hands fully on Jack's shoulders, staring firmly into his eyes. "And I am so proud of you."
ALSO!!!! I am officially over 100k!!!! CRAZY!!!! especially considering this was supposed to end like 10 chapters ago and i really didnt see it getting past 25k max. The beast keeps building and there is so much more to go!
A pair of golden, black tipped wings suddenly blocked Sam and Dean's view, spreading out high and wide as Jack's voice boomed above them. "You will leave the Winchester's Alone!"
It had been snowing fairly hard that December, and the roads were completely iced over. Dean was on his way to the hospital that night, to meet the new baby, when the Impala met a patch of black ice. The paramedics had told Sam and Eileen that he most likely died on impact, so there was no suffering involved. Judy took care of the funeral arrangements, so that the couple could get the new baby settled in. It was no surprise to anyone, when the decided to name him Dean Robert Winchester.
“I kinda like his idea, actually.” Dean said pointing towards Crowley who smiled smugly at the angel.
"Absolutely." Crowley said in a serious tone. Aziraphale smiled then, kissing the demon on the cheek and continuing on their way. "Would you?" Crowley asked after a while
"What do you mean?" Dean said. "You've been doing a great job. I don't see any reason to...oh...yeah...huh. You probably want to go home now that everything is over...don't you?"
"It always is with you, isn't it?" Aziraphale smiled, one eyebrow quirked. His smile only grew wider as he felt the huff of Crowley's answering chuckle breeze over the skin on his cheek. "What was it this time then?"
"This is no time for sarcasm, Rowena. I'm fully aware of your capabilities, I'm just concerned that..."
He was in the kitchen making lunch, when Cas came sauntering in. Dean tried his best to ignore the angel as he focused on the task at hand, but Cas wasn't having it. He shoved his hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat and leaned casually against the door frame  "What's cookin' good lookin'?" He smirked.
Sam, looked over his shoulder at Rowena, who only shook her head in response. “Cas, man, we can't...”
Before Dean could even begin to answer any of the rapid-fire questions, Crowley placed a reassuring hand on his companions shoulder. “He's fine, Angel. I already took care of him this morning. Besides,” he leaned down into the other man's ear and in a mock whisper said” he's more of a coffee guy anyway.” The wink was evident, even under the sunglasses.
No! No, no, no, no! How could this happen!? Castiel tried desperately to grab onto Dean before he fell through the rift, but it was too late. He found himself holding onto nothing the second the rift closed. Dean was gone. “Dean!” He screamed again at the empty air. ”What have I done?” Cas gripped the sides of his head, pulling at his hair. He closed his eyes, fighting back tears. “Dean?” He called out weakly.
" Whatever."  Dean scoffed. "I'm making pasta tonight, if anyone cares. I might consider sharing if you hyenas can stop laughing long enough to hold food in your mouth. Jack, ya coming?" He said on his way out of the room.
"He's not my...." Dean started to argue, then shook his head in resignation. It was pointless anymore. " Yeah, I'll do what I can. You sort stuff out with Aziraphale?" He regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth. Making that comparison again only served to add fuel to the dumpster fire, but he was genuinely curious.
Aziraphale rolled his eyes and put on his best face of annoyance. "Then I suppose you leave me no choice but to do the same."
“Jack's life was far more important than my own.” Cas argued. “If not for him the world would currently be under Michael’s reign, Lucifer would be running free and who knows what else could've happened if I had simply let him go. He had been far more helpful in his short time on Earth than I ever was.”
Dean scrunched his face, considering his brother's proposal, before a proud smile brushed his lips. "I think you might be onto something there, kid. I ain't gonna lie, there's definitely a few kinks we're gonna have to iron out, and I certainly don't think it's gonna be easy, but you just might be onto something." Sam let out a sigh of relief and smiled back at his brother. Dean walked over and gave him a strong pat on the back before looking to the other two at the table. "Guess you guys don't have to worry about pulling out asses out of the fire again." He said, slight remorse showing in his voice.
"I mean like, being friends with a freaking vamp." Sam answered, coldly. "Yeah, Benny wasn't like the others, and I get the whole 'brother's in arms' aspect, but it still doesn't make sense." He waved his hand, gesturing back at the book before letting it drop. "That Dean? That Dean would have never put his trust in a monster. That Dean wouldn't let people back into his life that had screwed him over, and now…I don't know, now it's like he just doesn't care about letting people in that who could hurt him, or…people who already have."
The angel blade was set carefully in the center of the table in the back room next to a pair of white cotton gloves and surrounded by piles of books. “Please, have a seat.” Aziraphale said as he picked up the gloves and slipped them on. “I have a few questions to ask you, Dean, if you don't mind. Before we can discuss finding a way to send you home, I was hoping you might provide me with some answers.” Dean nodded and the angel gently scooped up the blade and ran two fingers over the top of it. “First, I would like to know how you acquired this blade. I know you said you have an in with an angel, and you were kind enough to give us somewhat of a back story, however you said that your angel was called 'Cas'. This blade reads 'Hester'.”
"In case you've forgotten, I'm dead! I have no interest in repeating the process. I am no longer a part of the earth; therefore I am no longer concerned with what happens to it."
The Bentley was no less beautiful in the daylight, the sun reflecting brightly off its flawles, midnight sheen. Dean made his way toward the car, stopping briefly to correct his course when he remembered that the passenger’s side wasn't the side he was originally headed for. He opened the correct door and fastened his seat belt, tapping lightly on the dash as he waited for Crowley to start the car. It was a nervous habit he had picked up over the years, and he wasn't even aware he was doing it until the demon placed his hand on top of Dean's to halt it. “That  is quite enough of that, thank you.” Crowley said after pulling his hand away. “I won't have her scratched up by that silly ring of yours.”
Dean chuckled and sat down next to Cas patting him on the back. "It's not like you could've done anything to stop it, Cas. None of us could. We're as helpless as you are here. They all knew the risks going into this. It's bad out there, man. We're all kinda flying by the seat of our pants, and hoping for the best."
"Well, wouldn't want your angel to perish before we got the chance to know each other." Crowley smirked. "Besides, I'd hate to see you moping about while the rest of us are trying to save the world. It won't do anyone a bit of good to have to scrape you off the floor while we have an apocalypse on our hands."
" I said," Same answered, annoyed at his brother's lack of attention "We should all get to bed so we can get up early and do something fun tomorrow. Mom's going back to the cabin the next day and we haven't really left the bunker all week. With all the other's taking over most of the hunts, it's kinda the perfect time to get some fun in."
"It is you!" Susie gleefully confirmed "I almost didn't recognize you without your uniforms! It's been what, four years now? I hope nothing too terrible has brought you up this way. Though, if the FBI is here I suppose it must be serious. You know I haven't even heard anything on the news...but then I suppose I don't pay that much attention to the news anyway..."
eyes. "Look, I'm gonna fix this, okay? Don't worry. I don't know how, but I'm gonna make this right." Jack gave a broad smile and nodded, before he set off to his given task. "Just, if he comes in here, don't let him leave. He's not gonna say no to you." He shouted back as he left the garage.
"Don't worry about it, kid." She smiled. " You have enough on your plate. You don't need to be concerned about the crazy ramblings of some old witch. "
"Got something you wanna share with the class P?" Alex said, putting her fork down on her empty plate.
Sam heaved another sigh, really wishing he has more alcohol to explain this part. "After Chuck Thanos snapped the universe, we were surrounded. Cas saved our asses and got out of the graveyard but when we got back, he came up with crazy idea to go find help in other universes, and he and Dean started going at it, and he kinda.... tossed Dean into another dimension."
That night, finally falling asleep, after one of the longest, craziest days of his life, for some reason that he couldn't understand, he dreamed of the night he met Castiel.
"That scene from the play, well not the scene but the actual night? I don't think I can ever thank you enough for saving me that night. I saw a lot of really shitty things in that future, and Zack pretty much had me by the balls in the room. If you hadn't zapped me outta there when you did..."
"You like it here. Don't you?" Aziraphale accuse. " That's why you couldn't pass up on such a position. It gives you an excuse to stay here."
She stared at him for a long time, realization coming to her slowly. "Oh, you've got to be kidding me!"
He knew Jack was just trying to fit in with the others, but he'd be lying to himself if he said hearing Jack call him 'dad' didn't make his damn heart grow three fucking sizes. Still, to keep up appearances, Dean whipped around and pointed a finger. "Now see what you've done! You've corropted the fucking kid!C'mon Jack! Let's get you out of here before these asshats can screw you up any further!" With one  final glare at the angel, he turned and lead his son....their son...into the kitchen.
"Yeah, pick up lines!" Dean replied "You know, like 'Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Because you must be and angel'."
"Naomi." Cas answered. "Not the real you of course. A simulation. She said you were my weakness and needed to be eliminated. It took me a thousand times to get it right."
The phone rang twice before it was answered "This better be good, Angel, I'm in the middle of something at the moment."
“God has no say in my death. It's true, there will be no Earth, no Heaven, no Hell. There will only be one thing left, one place where everything, everyone will end up. Everyone except me.” Cas shook his head; his voice was breaking. “That would be too easy. It said it wanted me to suffer. I imagine spending the rest of forever alone after watching everything destroyed would suffice.”
“I don't see what's so fucking funny here.” Dean said, a little annoyed by the mockery of these two assholes. “I deserve a little more respect after saving the world, your asses included.”
"If anybody wants the job," said another one as she wobbled to her feet, speaking in a mocking tone, "he can come through me!" The laughter grew even louder then as the group looked on with disgruntled stares.
"Otherwise we wouldn't be here, anymore would we?" She chuckled back. "And Dean? He's alright? Adam has been asking about him, you know?"
"But my Lord," another demon replied, "w-we just went to all that trouble to bring them back here. Why would we..."
Dean was heart broken. He was being selfish, he knew that he was. But hearing his thoughts told to him...by Cas...seeing that look of betrayal and hurt on the angel's face...Cas knew. He knew the whole time. The guilt had finally taken its toll on on Dean. He felt his eyes well up with tears as he lowered his head and scratched the back of it, fighting with himself to find the right words. "Cas, I... I'm so sorry....I just..."
“What?” Sam asked. “What am I missing? That the world is ending? Yeah, no, pretty sure I got the memo, thanks.” He returned to scratching his families initials on the table. All hope was lost, so it's not like he had anything better to do.
Sam nodded back. " Yeah, well I guess you know then that Cas went to heaven to get his soul back? 'Cept he didn't tell us that the Entity got there first." Crowley sat down then, both him and Aziraphale completely engulfed in Sam's story now. "I guess it was laying siege to heaven or something, because it thought, since Jack was still half angel, that he belonged in the empty. Cas wasn't having that. He loved jack like his own, you know? So, he offered himself in Jack's place."
Thank you all so very much for the generous feed back!  I'm seriously floored by the response this has already received! You guys are truly the best! ❤️❤️❤️❤️💞
“I don't matter Sam!” Cas interrupted, his head shooting up to match the Hunter's gaze. “Jack was supposed to save the world! He was supposed to make everything better! You needed him more than you need me. The world needed him. The Shadow was tearing what little is left of Heaven to shreds and it wasn't going to stop until it had Jack. Something had to be done! His life was far more important than my own. I did what was necessary to protect those I care about.”
Cas closed his mouth and swallowed, his eyes dropping to his feet. "Dean, listen ... About your new...friends..."
"Dean." Cas said pushing against Dean to make him stop. "You can't save me this time. My time is up. I've made my bed, and now…"
"Good night Crowley!" Dean rolled his eyes shutting the door behind him. He turned to make his way down the hall to his bedroom, when he saw Cas standing with his mouth open a few feet away. "Dude!" He jumped. "Seriously, are you ever gonna stop doing that?! What's up?"
Dean had managed to slide himself off the floor and back himself against the bunker door, and now there was really nowhere else to run. "Yes." He cried weakly, unsure if the tears were from the guilt or the fear. He would give anything to take it all back, but it was too late now. He had made it through the end of the world and this is how he was going to die.
"I told you from the beginning, that this was a dangerous plight." Aziraphale said casually, as he licked his finger to turn the page. "You're the one who insisted that we had no other choice but to at least try." Crowley replied with an annoyed huff, tilting his head back to stare straight at the wall in front of him. "How is he?" Aziraphale asked after a while.
"I'm sorry, Gabriel." Cas sighed, his shoulders slumped. "I knew this was a terrible idea. I have burned too many bridges to be an effective 1leader. No one wants to follow someone they despise. I have killed so many of our brothers and sisters, I fear that I have doomed us to failure before we could even begin."
"Maybe I deserve it." Dean huffed. "I probably do. All I know is I can't keep doing this. I can't keep driving him away and expecting him to come crawling back without apologizing to him." He pushed Crowley out of the way and started marching his way down the hall towards Cas's room.
"Well, he described you as a man of action." Aziraphale explained. "Someone who 'got tough, when the tough got going'. Someone who never gave up. He said that even when he was willing to throw in the towel, you kept him going. That you never stopped believing."
“We'll figure this out, Cas.” Dean yawned, snuggling deeper into the angel. “ We'll fix this shit with Michael, we'll figure out a way to save your ass from the Empty, because that's what we do. Save the world: one dumb ass mistake at a time.”
"Nuh- uh." Dean shook his head, and pulled Cas's lips back to his own. "sent a text....told 'em I...found...you... we're good." He said between kisses.
Dean let his eyes open, finally, his blurred vision registering cold, angry eyes that were the wrong shade of blue, so different from the ones he met before he closed them. "I saved him." He said, his voice shallow and weak. It was about damn time too. He thought about all the times Cas had pulled his ass out of the fire. Sure, Dean had been there to patch him up, but he always had help. Cas had risked everything to fight for Dean's life, because he loved him. It was about damn time Dean did the same. So, he did. He just laid everything on the line to pull Cas out of the fire.
Sam sat in silence, petulantly mulling over Charlie's  words. She was right, probably. Dean may have been scared, but it was still possible that he just couldn't hack the life anymore. Sam wasn't some child. And the other stuff she was saying…she was way off base. There was a big difference between reading about someone's and living it.
It was a sound neither of the brothers had heard since he was in the hospital and blew out the lights when he asked Dean to 'pull his finger'. The memory of it put Dean even more on edge. "I do feel however that it would be wise of us to check into a motel for the evening. The party won't be over until later, not to mention we should probably clean up before going. I know Marie said we look fine but I still feel like we should at least get the dirt and Ash off of ourselves before arriving to such a special event. Not to mention I should probably change. Seeing as these women are 'fans' of ours, I would hate to upstage them with my presence."
"How the Heaven was that not part of the plan!?" Crowley yelled over the thundering boom of books clattering to the floor around them.
"What?" He said. " As long as we're being brutally honest, it's only fair for Dean to know the truth."
It had been at least two hours since Cas had stormed out. Sam probably should've been worried. He should've been sifting through the lore, buried in books, scrolls, and prophecies, finding anything he could on opening rifts to other dimensions. He should be brushing up on every monster and creature in existence, thinking of ways to kill them in mass quantities, figuring out a way to call Chuck and trying to get him to listen to reason. The only problem was, he just couldn't find it in himself to care.
Cas just laughed as he walked ahead of Dean, who was silently cursing that damn trenchcoat for preventing him from checking out the angel's ass.
He had been on the phone for hours now, going down the list of hunters he knew, to see if anyone had a lead on where Kaia might be. Even though he was upset by the few that didn't answer (most likely because they hadn't made it) he was relieved that a lot of them seemed to be handling things on their own pretty well, staying in secluded areas, warded down and armored up, but still none of them had any information about where she might be. He waited to call Jody last. He didn't want to have to try to muddle through the other calls of she hadn't picked up. Luckily her and Donna managed to grab the girls and get the hell out of Dodge just in time. Unfortunately, it meant they had to leave just about everything behind. Even if Claire had something from this world's Kaia that Rowena could use to possibly track Dark Kaia, it was gone now.
Dean gave a nervousness laugh, trying to play it off by slapping Cas on the shoulder. " I gotta be up front with Donna to give directions and it's not like I can trust any of these bozos to get baby Back in one piece. Claire's gonna be more comfortable with you than with a witch or a demon and besides..." He scratched the back of his head, unsure how the next part of why he put those two together could was gonna come out. He leaned in and lowered his voice so the girls wouldn't be able to hear. " We need someone to talk to her about the Kaia situation before we get back, and since your kinda the expert on people wearing the faces of people she loves, you're sorta our best bet."
Dean sighed pinching the bridge of his nose, as he leaned against the war room table. They had been going back and forth about this since they left the dungeon and, no matter how hard he tried, Crowley refused to drop the subject. It wasn't the first time someone had made a remark about his and Cas's relationship. Hell, people have been crackin' jokes pretty much since the moment he got back from hell. That wasn't the issue. It was the fact that Crowley had been so insistent about it (not to mention, at least halfway sincere) that was really getting under Dean's skin. "Dude, for like the millionth time...."
"You have got to be kidding me!" Dean groaned. He scrolled through the page, clicking back through the other websites. Sure enough, they were telling the truth. There had to be hundreds of thousands of stories online featuring him and Cas as a couple. " What the actual, fuck? What is wrong with these people?" He scrolled through a few of the stories, noting some of the 'tags' on each one. ' Fluff', 'crack', 'Smut' ' Dean's red ass' 'Top Castiel/bottom Dean'....he felt like he was gonna be sick. "Who writes crap like this about people?"
Dean pulled his bottom lip between his teeth with his tounge and squeezed his eyes shut before turning to face Sam. He opened his eyes and shook his head. "I can't do this anymore, Sam. I can't."
"Actually," Mary yawned "I was thinking about doing the same thing. I have a Long drive ahead of me tomorrow. I should probably get some rest." She gave each of them a hug. " Thank you boys, so much for today. I really liked getting to spend time with you. Good night." She gave a small wave, picking up her koosh ball wear she had set it on the table and disappeared down the hall towards her room.
'A little grief?!' Dean thought to himself. It almost broke him out of the whole charade as soon as he heard those words. After all this time, Cas had to know how much he had meant to them. To him. Instead he shrugged. "Hey I get it man. Needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few right?" He turned to Bobby and gave him a little wink. Bobby shook his head and took a sip of his beer to hid his grin. Dean turned back to Cas fighting even harder to keep his face neutral.
It was miles down the road that Castiel was finally able to get over the shock of being allowed to drive the Impala, without Dean in it, no less, but after that faded a wave of panic set in. "So.... Claire....how is life."
"Somebody has to." Aziraphale smiled. "Your quite useless on your own." He leaned into the touch, letting the demon’s hair brush against his cheek. " You've been rather affectionate lately, is there a reason?"
“I really am sorry about that,” Aziraphale admitted, apologetically, “but surely you understand. You're a complete stranger, who somehow managed to break into my shop, brandishing a mysterious, heavenly weapon. I have no idea what your intentions may have been, but I obviously had to take precautions.”
“Yep.” Dean replied, a little sadly. He didn't necessarily like the guy, but he didn't hate him either. The day he died was emotional for a lot of reasons. “He was kinda shit at being a demon, too.” He said, winking at Crowley. “He didn't pronounce it as stupidly though.” He chuckled.
"And why should we listen to you?" Came a question from the back of the group. "You have led us astray before, Castiel. What makes now any different?"
“I'm sorry,” Anathema breathed out apologetically “I was trying my best to keep him away from it while you were saying your goodbyes, but he just...”
“Really?” Dean asked again, feeling the blush heat his face at his mother's description of him and Cas.
"Right." Aziraphale half chuckled to himself. "Well, it seems I have bit of a situation here I could use your assistance with."
Sam gave him warm smile and placed his hand on the nephilim's shoulder. “Yeah, we should. You know, Dean and I are getting a little old to be constantly on the road, hacking away at whatever monsters we can find. Maybe it wouldn't kill us to take a few more breaks in between hunts.”
“Watch it, Angel!” Crowley hissed. “Alright, that's enough then! Come on, let's go” He grabbed Dean by the shoulder and started shoving him out of the door.
Dean pointed a finger at Marie and Sam, speaking firmly to get his point across. "It's nothing! Not a thing! Never was, never is, never will be! Got it?!"
"Hey, I'm not judging." Dean shrugged. "It's not like I was on my deathbed or anything after trying to save your dumb ass…"
“Very good, Adam.” She smiled fondly down at the child. She glanced back at the men and her eyes locked onto Dean. “Who's he?”
"Not that." Charlie said, waving his statement off. Sam looked at her, confused, not sure what she was referring to. She took a breath and pulled a book out of her duffle throwing it on Sam's lap. 'Mystery Spot' By Carver Edlund.  "You say these books happened in real life. That everything written in them actually went down…but the past two times I've been around you guys…you certainly dont act like you do in the books."
"Man, you should've seen him out there, Sammy!" Dean said excitedly. " Cas was kicking ass and taking names like he was getting paid to do it. It was awesome."
“I told you it was a mistake.” Crowley chuckled in a sing-song tone, as he went to take another sip from his glass.
"Dean!" Sam shot up out of his chair, racing to his brother's side followed closely by Aziraphale and Crowley. "Dean, what happened?! Are you okay?” Dean pushed his brother away and scanned the room, tossing off his back pack before scrambling across the floor where he saw Cas lying in a seemingly lifeless hump.
"He was scared of Jack." Sam shrugged. "I don't think that was part of the act but I could be wrong. It wouldn't matter anyway. Jack's gone and unless you and Cas feel like going around and making a few Nephilim and waiting nine months, I think we can throw that in the trash too.'
"I don't..." Dean was interrupted by the flutter of wings. Both he and Claire turned to see Cas, sitting up in bed, fumbling with the buttons of his shirt. "Cas! What the hell, man!?"
“Your threats don't frighten me, darling.” Rowena smirked “You can try to destroy me all you want, greater and more powerful beings than you have tried, and yet here I am! I know my destiny, and you, lad, are not it.”
Amara nodded, and released a pulse of power they had all become too familiar with as she renewed the warding and stepped towards Rowena where she stood by the box. "Now, this may hurt a bit dearie, but I need you to stay absolutely still, understand?" Rowena said, holding out her left hand to Amara and placing her right one over the gap. Amara nodded again and closed her eyes, taking a deep breath as she gave Rowena her hands. The witch took a deep breath as well, her eyes glowing purple as she began chanting in Latin. After a few words Amara winced as a river of white-blue light began pulsing out of her body, flowing across Rowena's body and into the gap. They all watched in silence as the box filled up with the remaining souls, Rowena's words growing louder as she sealed them in with magic. Both women toppled to the floor in exhaustion. It was done.
Sam stared at him in shock, chocking on his drink. He hadn't even gotten to that part of the story yet. " How did you..."
"Yeah," Sam chuckled, still reeling from the fact that everyone seemed to know about his brother and Cas. Except them. Maybe they did for all he knew. What the fuck was happening? "Anyway, Dean gets there and buddies up with this angel and his demon.... friend, and we managed to get him back, and he just... I don't know he expects us to trust them. Like it's nothing, you know." Sam ran his hands through his hair and rested his elbows on the table.
“We don't have time for your games, Rowena.” Cas replied coldly. “If you would prefer, I could take you back to that hotel that I found you in. Next to a grave yard. I'm sure you'll be perfectly safe there.”
"I thought you said angels followed orders."  Sam said. "That you wouldn't risk your place in Heaven for anything. Knowing the guy for years or not, what would make you stick out your neck for a demon if you knew that heaven wouldn't approve?"
Dean nodded. " Look, I know everyone thinks that me being a dick yesterday saved him, but let's face facts. I'm always a dick. That's why he stayed. Because being here makes him unhappy. Me upping the ante didn't save him anymore than it does on a daily basis. I'm pretty sure it actually did the opposite. He's probably fucking sick of putting up with my shit. With the way things are going, I'm gonna be honest, I don't think any of us are getting out of this alive. He probably left to go out on his own terms. I don't know about angels, but I heard that dogs sometimes go off into the woods to die alone. Not that Cas is anything like a dog! It's just...he probably knew the only way for him to be happy was to get the fuck away from me...."
"And you're a man-shaped baby." Cas said,  grabbing Dean by the shoulders and turning him around to shove him towards the door. "Now, if you don't want to tell anyone about our activities that's fine. I'm perfectly content having you all to myself. But if you let our family starve because you're too full of yourself to face your own sexuality, there will be no more activities to even speak of."
"Then kill me." Dean croaked. "If you want me to stop, kill me." It was already coming anyway, and it was Chuck's last chance to choose an act of mercy. Every second he was left alive was an eternity of living hell.
Cas was confused. He couldn't think of anyone Dean would despise so thoroughly on his behalf, let alone a woman. He looked between the brothers, both looking like they were about to explode waiting for one of them to speak. "Sam? Who..."
"You've been sitting on your ass in here for days." She sneered. "Why can't you wrangle the little shits, and tell Sam to let me go fight?"
Dean had always had a way of charming people into falling for him. He didn't even have to try. It was like a second nature to him. When it came to Dean feeling the same way for them, however... Sam couldn't help but feel sorry for Cas. His pity began to outshine all the other things he was feeling towards the angel at that point. He couldn't even begin to imagine how much it must hurt to love someone who could never love you back. Sure, Dean cared about the guy. Cas was the best friend he had ever had. Even after all the lies and deceit, Dean always stood by his side. He had never seen his brother grown so attached to another person that wasn't already family. He loved Bobby course, and Jody, Donna, the girls, and everyone they had adopted as their own over the years, but Cas....it was like he put the guy on a pedestal. To a point where it had almost become harmful to their friendship. He expected more out of Cas than anyone else, even though he had hurt them more than anyone else had. Dean always took it harder when something when wrong, but he was always quick to forgive the guy, even if he didn't tell him. He had more faith in Cas than he did in anything else.
Cas smiled as he wriggled his hand from Dean's grasp and sent another surge of grace through him anyway. " As much as I appreciate your enthusiasm to be honest about our relationship, I do not feel presenting it to our family in the form of flesh wounds is the best idea."
Dean smirked at his brother "Wish, you woulda told me. I could gotten my head out of my ass a lot sooner and replaced it with this guy's..."
For the first time since they had arrived Sam saw the angel look pissed. It was shocking to say the least. For such a giddy, proper guy, he actually looked a little terrifying when he was upset. "I believe we discussed making assumptions being foolish, even when they are based off of proper knowledge." Aziraphale gritted through his teeth.
Sam just stared at him, confused as hell. Jesus Christ, he actually broke his brother. Dean had no idea what he was saying anymore.
Dean nodded and made a mad dash towards the archives, running as fast through the narrow corridors as his legs would take him, crashing into the room from too much momentum. "Rowena!" He gasped out before falling into a fit of coughing.
That's how he sat, as Jack explained to them the Deal that was made, as Jack sobbed his apology for the life of their friend. That's how he sat as Jack curled against his shoulder and cried, while Billie claimed she had no idea that the Shdow planned to take Castiel's life before he was happy, breaking their deal. How he sat while Eileen comforted Sam as he sobbed silently into Eileen's shoulder, while they all had a moment of silence for their fallen family member. He sat there, just like that, while everyone had a drink, apologizing to eachother, to Dean. Long after everyone had gone to bed, to prepare for the day ahead.
Wooo....that chapter got looooong. Sorry about that. There was a lot to unpack. Strap on folks. Things are gonna get wild.
It's not great ( My proof reader is usually my husband but he won't touch my fanfics with a 10ft pole) and it most likely lame. But I can say I'd did it.
"All the time." Dean smirked. "I tell him he's like family, that I need him, that he's my best friend."
"You expect us to trust you? After everything you did? All the pain you caused? How do we know you’re not just setting us up to fail again? What does it matter to us if the world is destroyed? You've already gotten us killed once. Why should we die again?"
They say your life flashes before your eyes before you die, but Dean had died enough times now, to know that was all bullshit. All you see is darkness, nothing, but maybe that was just because he had never stayed dead. Now that this was really the end though, his final farewell, he could say for certain it was still completely untrue. You don't see your life, you see the dead, rising out of the blackness to greet you. Why it was only angels he was seeing, popping up out of the black goo surrounding him, he had no idea, but that's what had to be happening. All around them a wave of sticky black sludge produced angel after angel ( some they had seen destroyed with their own eyes) standing with their wings flared out, blades in hand until the room was flooded with them and the goo gathered in front of Chuck, taking human form, and this had to be the end because, as the goo receded in left Death himself in its wake...except that wasn't possible either... because Death was dead too!
“It shouldn't work like that.” Adam said. “It should be pictures, memories. You can't remember something if you weren't there. They're talking to a woman now. She's really small and she's wearing silk pajamas. Her hair is very red. And a girl...” It was funny, the way Adam was describing them, Dean could almost picture Sam, Cas and Rowena himself. “They're in a small room with a chair...”
Dean glanced over at the angel and saw exactly what his Mom meant. "She's gotta point, man." He eyes Cas up and down, using his mom's sentiment as an excuse to check him out. "That not really the type of thing you wanna be wearing in a place full of kids. Might attract the wrong type of attention, ya know."
Thankfully, for Dean, Sam let that one go and rolled his eyes. "Ya know, it wouldn't kill you to have a little culture in your life, Dean." The elder brother just raised his eyebrow in response. "Fine." Sam relented. "What did you have in mind then?"
Castiel's face slipped from frustrated confusion into quiet revelation, his eyes as wide as saucers. "Oh..."
“No.” Cas hissed. “I won't ask anyone else to suffer. I will not harm another being for my sake! I won't! Not ever again.”
Dean let himself calm down a bit before he answered. “Castiel?” He chuckled. “That’s Cas. His full name is Castiel.”
Cas tilted his head and nodded. "I'll need to split them into groups, it would be most effective to attack from all sides. I want my most trusted in charge of each faction. It will be you, Gabriel, Gadreel, Inias and Balthazar at the lead"
Strike three. "Next time?" Sam scoffed. " What, are you gonna take him, Dean? Gonna hold hands and frolic through the roses?"
"I didn't ask your name boy scout." Meg sneered. "I asked what you are. You aren't human, that's for sure, but that meatsuit is yours." She paused, a wicked smile crossing her face before she turned to Cas and it morphed into a mock pout. "Clarence? Have you been moving furniture with someone else while I was gone?"
He tossed the bee over his head in Cas's direction and turned to give him a weak, but hopeful smile. Cas caught it, but kept his head down, smiling at the stuffed insect instead. Dean had messed up tonight, and he knew it, but that smile was enough to tell him that he would be forgiven. He always was.
Alright, I'm gonna be honest. I'm procrastinating here. Also kinda projecting my own nerves onto Dean so please excuse Dean's little freak out and moment of almost 0 self confidence. I've said before that I resonate with Dean on many levels so I may have put my own characteristics in him for a bit. Sorry.
Aziraphale finally turned to face Sam then, his face turning serious as he took a deep breath. "You see, the more time we spent around humanity, the more we learned that nothing was ever really their fault. No human is born entirely evil, nor has there ever been one born that was entirely good. Humans are just born. Entirely human. It is the circumstances in which they find themselves that tip them one way or the other. That's how God made you. Monsters are not born, they are made, but that decision to become one rests entirely on their shoulders. Do you know what makes a monster? Lack of remorse. An angel is not a monster because he wipes out an entire village at God's behest, but they become one when the feel no sorrow for the lives that are lost. A demon who feels sorry for the souls he has damned to hell, simply because he has no other choice cannot be considered a monster either. They are simply doing what they are made to do. A werewolf who decides to live off of animal hearts, rather than take a human life is a different type of creature, most definitely, but a monster he is not. A man who was cursed by a monstrous demon, before he was old enough to defend himself, because of a deal that was made before he was even born, does not a monster make."
"Real nice Winchester." Gabriel laughed. "You really know how to make a guy feel welcome, but unfortunately that was just problemo Numero uno. We still got a whole list of stuff to sort out."
"Oh, my!" Aziraphale shook his head. "That won't be necessary." He snapped his fingers as Sam began to push his first pile of glass and rubble into the pan and the entire place was as good as new. "There you are." He smiled up at Sam.
"You're characters." Chuck replied. "Failed drafts. I don't get why you're complaining everything worked itself out. What do you care anyway? You abandoned your world too, to be here. Big surprise by the way. I was not expecting that."
Dean gulped, taking a few deep breaths before he trusted his voice enough to form words. "He said, it wanted him to…to know happiness. It wanted….it wanted him to know what it was like…to…to know what it felt like to be happy, so that it could be the one to rip it away from him."
Dean toppled to the ground as the demon flew across the room, hanging in the air over the throne and grasping at Castiel's hand around his neck. "ME!" Cas growled, the shadow of his wings splaying across the wall. The demon let out an ear shattering wail, his eyes and mouth exploding in a hot white light before Cas tossed the lifeless vessel to the ground. He turned to face the rest of the room and wiped his hand on the throne. "Any more questions?"
"Well," she said nervously, "we've already agreed that sacrifice is necessary in this process. The needs of the many and all that. I know it isn't ideal, but we do have access to a few more souls. We just need to extract them first."
"So, what, you thought now was gonna be the best time to tell Jack?" Dean asked. "You don't think the kid's got enough on his plate right now without having to worry about you, too? Killing God ain't enough for him? You had to add his father's impending doom to the mix?" He lost more and more control of his voice with each word.
Dean turned his head cautiously, now completely convinced he was dreaming after all, because there he was, standing just a few feet away, hands awkwardly shoved into the pockets of that stupid, ugly trench coat, looking the same as he did the day he left Dean.
"I am fine." Cas assured. "I was able to heal the majority of our injuries, however it seems as though, even with my powers mostly restored I still require rest after so much exertion. It might have to do with the state of heaven, though I'm not entirely sure. I should be fine in a day or so."
"What if it doesn't work?!" Sam threw his hands in the air in anger. " We don't have time to come up with anything else! If she can't do this, we're screwed!"
"You'll have to explain all of that over dinner." Jody nodded. She walked over to the door and pulled out a knife before flipping up to corner of the rug and scratching away at some paint from the devil's trap. She flipped her knife closed and tucked it away, walking towards the kitchen as she spoke. "C'mon, let's go eat before you get washed up. Hope everyone likes lasagna."
"Speak for yourself, Angel." Crowley yawned as he pushed back from the table. "I'm never one to turn down sleep when I can afford it. Besides,"  he smirked, "I shared my home with Dean while he was with us. It's only fair I give him the opportunity to return the favor. It's the least he can do."
"Yeah, alright, " Gabriel laughed, "that's all well and good but what makes you think I'm letting your ass into Heaven?"
"Seems utterly ridiculous to me." Aziraphale said once they continued on. They turned the corners in blissful silence before Aziraphale spoke again. "Would you have done it?" He asked quietly.
"Okay." Sam sniffed, quickly wiping the back of his wrist over his face and nodding back. "Okay good."
Dean clapped his hand over heart and gasped. "I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me." He mocked. " Really, it was nothing, guys. But thanks for the ego boost."
Castiel let out a relived sigh, and nodded, mulling that over for a minute. It made sense. The two of them were suspiciously close. At first, he assumed it just stemmed from years of working together. He and Dean often shared a similar comradery for the same reason, though the longer he thought about it, the more he realized how obvious it should have been. "You two have been together for a long time." He said, more of a statement than a question.
Cas' face changed the instant he looked up and saw Crowley. In the blink of an eye, he had managed to swipe Dean's  blade and push the man behind him. “Leave!” He growled out between clenched teeth.
Dean pulled at his wrists. They were bound behind his back and judging by the metallic bite against his wrists, the hands cuffs we're real; too strong to be snapped without hurting himself. Whoever his kidnappers were, they were professional, and well-prepared. His reputation probably preceded him, though why they were playing dumb while they thought he was still passed out was beyond him. Maybe they knew he was just biding his time. Tricky bastards!
"So I heard." Aziraphale nodded, keeping his tone even. "Quite loudly, actually. That Claire has quite the mouth on her."
"It's fine, Cas." He huffed. "It's cool. We're good!" His eyes went back to Crowley, and he yanked the demon by the sleeve, pulling them farther out of the room. Cas watched them leave through narrow eyes, barely suppressing the growl that was growing in his chest.
If Dean hadn't felt stupid before, he certainly did now. Not only was this guy circling his questions, but he was doing it using big words Dean hadn't even heard of, in a way that made him wonder if he actually was answering him and Dean just didn't get it. “I...uh...”
"Am I?" Crowley smirked again before sliding his gaze to the disgruntled looking Castiel. "I wouldn't be so sure. I guess the best celestial being won the battle after all." He held out his hand for Castiel to shake. "Such a shame."
Cas shrugged and tilted his head back towards Dean, never slowing his stride. " Yeah. But I'm your dick."
“ You know he treasures everything you've ever given to him.” she said, her tone oddly scolding. Dean just raised a confused eyebrow. “ Every gun, every knife, every fake badge, every picture. Even things you wouldn't think to keep like receipts and matchbooks. He keeps it all in a box in his room. I found him looking through it while you guys were locked up in that place.”
"An error, on my part." It said, advancing on them further. "Look at him. Such a pathetic creature could never be truly happy."
Castiel let a cold humorless laugh. He rubbed his hands over his face and shook his head. "You know what? Save it Dean." When he made eye contact with the hunter, Dean cold see the sad, tired look that dulled his grace. "It doesn't matter. Hunter's don't have long shelf lives anyway, you've said it yourself. Sure it'll hurt your mom, probably destroy Sam, but they won't have to live with the pain that long. They'll probably be dead in a few years too." His voice was beginning to sound hysterical. "Jack's practically a mortal now himself. I actually don't even know the natural life span of a nephilim, none have really been left alive long enough to conduct a study. If the few remaining angels don't decide to kill him.... I'm sure his lack of grace will take him, as well. So, really Dean, it's fine, because the only person who will be around long enough to truly suffer the consequences of your actions is me. God, knows I'm not going anywhere...." he turned away, his voice beginning to crack "you'll all be gone...and I'll still be right here."
In the blink of an eye, with the flutter of wings, Cas was gone revealing half the Bunker's occupants that were standing behind him, jaws practically hitting the floor.
"Still a charmer I see." She winked back " Well, I guess it's a relief that nothing is going on around here. I don't think this city could handle another scandal. Oop! Did you hear me? I just rhymed. I guess I'm a poet and didn't know it. And I see you brought a friend with you this time. What's your name cutie?"
“Right!” Aziraphale said a little too loudly, trying to steer the conversation away from this potential falling out. “Well that answers two of my questions.” Dean looked back over at the angel and crossed his arms, finding himself a little less inclined to answer anymore. “Now, you said that you were able to open the rift using the essence of an archangel, is that correct?” He tried his best to keep a pleasant tone, but he felt like this human could snap at any moment. Who knew someone could be so protective over an acquaintance?
"I am not a coward." He said bitterly as he flicked a hand out and tossed the witch aside, breaking three of her ribs as she flew into a tilted pillar behind her and toppled to the floor.
Marie giggled and slid out of the booth "Thank you guys again. This is going to be amazing. I gotta go. Don't be late, okay?"
time." He pulled a chair over to the stairs then grabbed Mary and sat her down. "I need you to stay right here and guard the door. No one in, no one out! Got it?" He pulled a gun from under the table and placed it in her hand.
"I couldn't care less about everything!" The demon shouted coming to a stop in front of the angel. "Screw everything! What has everything done for anybody! I don't care about anybody else's anything. I just don't want him to kill you!"
"You aren't like them, Crowley." Aziraphale said, placing his hand on the side of Crowley's face and turning it back. " They were evil. They wanted destruction. They wanted Lucifer to reign. It wasn't your fault. You were just there. You aren't evil."
“When I saw you, inside Dean's head, you were talking to Sam and you seemed very sad.” Adam explained. “I felt it. I felt your pain when you and Kaia were trying to open the portal on this side. Your pain wasn't just physical like hers. It was emotional pain. I've never known anything like it. You were crying. I heard you. It wasn't in English, or really any other language I know of, but I heard you crying. Are you sad because your powers aren't as strong as you wish they were?”
"Purgatory." Dean shrugged. "Longer. I don't even fucking know. It just kinda happened. He always made me feel like I was worth something, ya know. That...that doesn't happen a lot. I spent my whole life thinking all I was good for was saving other people, and that fucker bursts in and tells me I'm worth being saved, too. How could I not fall for that?"
"Dean doesn't speak for everybody." Sam said. "He sure as hell doesn't speak for me. I'm worried about you, man. I got like a million calls from all the hunters today. They told me what you were doing. Cas, you can't..."
Dean's eyes rolled to the back of his head as he tried to ignore the chorus of awes coming from the two girls. "I have one for you.... it's 'dumb ass'!
"Alright, let's get going before all the Gas 'N Sips are closed." Dean said, trying to quickly change the subject. "We gotta grab a few snacks on the way back. I ain't sitting through that play again on an empty stomach."
"I...I don't..." Dean stammered. " That can't be right. Cas has been happy since then. He's been happy...he..."
I can't even begin to describe to you the frustration and anger I felt. I had been so busy juggling the kids and life and preparing for the holidays that I had to set it all aside for a minute and when I finally got some spare time I wrote like a madman and finished and it was all...lost.
"As I said, you've missed quite a bit." Castiel nodded. "He redeemed himself honorably. His counterpart is currently watching over the Winchester's. Having both of them there might be an advantage. I only hope they were successful in their part of the plan."
"Shit! Claire! I am so sorry!" He bent down to give her a hand up, but she just scowled at him and hit it away.
"Cas." Dean whispered. "Cas! Hey man are you alright? Cas! Earth to Castiel! You with us there buddy?" Dean tapped at the hand on his shoulder which finally got the angel's attention.
"Oh, yes, right, of course." Crowley nodded. "And spouting off words from the holy book, dictated by the very entity, Heaven bent on destroying us all, where any one of them can hear you, is most definitely a better option." Aziraphale stopped walking to fix the demon with an unamused glare. Crowley rolled his eyes and grabbed Aziraphale by the sleeve to keep pulling him along. "Forgive me if I'm not oozing with confidence at the moment." He said in a harsh whisper. "I'm a tad fixated on the fact that regardless of whether we accomplish anything here, we are still utterly FUCKED!"
'I'll Just Wait Here Then' was different. Instead of simply being instrumental, it was actually Kristen singing. Dressed as Cas. Her scene played out in the bottom corner of the screen as images of the two girls dress up as the hunter and the angel filled the rest of the screen. A few we're obviously from the play, but others looked like they came from conventions and Halloween parties. And they looked Happy. It was a little surreal, seeing a couple dressed as himself and the angel, so obviously in love, but Dean would be lying if he said he wasn't a little flattered.
Aziraphale sighed and rolled his eyes. "Yes, I know that but, well, this one has a sword with him, from heaven it would seem..."
Cas and Sam only started to laugh harder, with Jack joining in. Mary, however, was not amused. "I don't understand what's so funny. " she said. "That's pretty much exactly what I meant."
It was a dangerous back and forth between the two of them. Betrayal and forgiveness. No matter how many times they had hurt each other they always winded up back together. It all made sense why Cas always came back now, but Dean... Sam shook the thought from his head as he knocked on Cas's door. He knew his brother. There had to be a reason, but that wasn't it. “Cas?” He asked after a minute of silence.
She set her drink back down, tucking her slip of paper underneath and swiveled in her chair, her long dark curls falling gracefully over her shoulders, her deep timeless eyes burrowing into his soul. Her smile slipped slightly as she took in the sight before her "Castiel. It's nice to see you back to your usual self, nephew."
“Why?!” Sam's head shot up to meet the angel's eyes. “Why would we do that Cas?!” He demanded. Cas tilted his head and stared back at Sam, his expression a mix between angry and confused. “You said it yourself! There's nothing we can do! We're all gonna die soon anyway! At least one of us got out!” A flicker of something crossed Cas's face, too quick for Sam to register, before the angel dropped his eyes to his lap. “I get it Cas, I do, okay?” He said in a softer tone. I'm gonna miss him too. He's my brother and I love him. I know we don't stand a snowball's chance in Hell unless all of us are here, working together but right now, with this.... Cas, we don't stand a chance either way. What's the point of trying to bring him back if he's just going to die like the rest of us? At least now he has a chance and I know you're still pissed at him, man, but you can't be so angry that you want him to suffer the way we will.” Castiel sat silent. He didn't even spare either of them a glance before pushing back from the table. He stood up and began to walk away. “Look, Cas, I understand...”
"Fight." The Shadow replied. "Win. Build yourself an army of angels and demons from what I have here, the likes of which that has never been seen. Rise up against God and take. Him. Down."
“Yes!” He smiled. “You’re the sad man!” Cas looked up to Dean and narrowed his eyes, to which Dean just shrugged in response. “Your name is Cas. I don't understand why you're so sad though. Dean told me you have all these awesome powers. I have powers too, and I'm hardly ever sad. I suppose it's probably because my powers are cooler. Dean told me so himself."
They sat for a while in silence, staring each other down until Aziraphale sighed a resumed staring out the windshield. "Do you ever feel guilty, Crowley?"
“Sorry.” Dean mumbled as he placed his hands in his lap. Crowley nodded, started the car, and the next thing he knew they were barreling down the street. As much as Dean wanted to take in the sights (he had never been to London before) the thought of looking out the window right now made him sick. The dude's driving was scary enough at night when no one else was sharing the road. In the broad daylight, it was downright terrifying, which was saying something for Dean. Instead, he decided to clear up another issue that had been bugging him since last night. “Hey, uh, listen man, while we're on the subject of apologies, I wanted to say I was sorry, ya know, for getting all up in your business, er whatever. It wasn't my place and I don't know what came over me. I'm not usually the kind of guy who prods at people's personal lives, not unless it's part of a case or something, I just....”
"Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna go pass the fuck out." Dean said. "Today's been crazy, and I'm ready to get back into my normal routine. Killing evil shit and saving the world."
