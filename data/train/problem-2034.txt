John took a deep, shuddering breath here, on the verge of tears again. Sherlock quelled his instinct to reach out to John, knowing he would continue on his time. He was hating this with all his heart, but at the same time desperate for John to continue, to hear about this monster did to John.
After what felt like an eternity, John moved.
As soon as he had surprised John from behind, John had froze for just a fraction of a second before reaching behind, grabbing Sherlock's torso and throwing him over his shoulder, as if he weighed nothing (kind of true, given how little he ate). With a vicious, sub-sonic voice that was the most dangerous sound Sherlock had ever heard, he growled, "Get off! Right now! I'm not letting you ever touch me again!" And then proceeded to pummel the living daylights out of Sherlock, who was too shocked (and in pain) to move.
Sherlock wanted so badly to close the five foot gap between himself and the shell-shocked John on the bed. He wanted to go kiss the idiot, his idiot.
John continued, "I quickly rose to the top of my troop. Sholto"- and here John hiccuped- "Sh-Sholto would smile at me often, and encourage me, and try to talk to me. He never did that with the other soldiers, and it made me feel special. I was sure I was straight, but day by day, and sexy smile by sexy smile, I began to doubt that."
Sherlock stared at him a moment, not speaking.
He fought the urge to run up to John's room and break down the door and ask for forgiveness and ask what's wrong and just hold him and kiss him and-
"Don't hide it, Sherlock. Why else would you want me around? I heard Anderson, Donovan, and Dimmock talking about us. They said that I'm just an experiment to you. That you kiss me and treat me to gather data. Like with your parents. Or Jeannette. Like one of your experiments. I- Sherlock, if that's the case, I'm sorry for messing up your data. But I'm not like you, I'm weak- I can't hold back my emotions. I do truly like you as more than a friend, and if all I am is an experiment to you, I will stay and be that, because I'm weak and I need you. Just- forget this happened and we can go back to normal. Or, if you are done with your experiment, then we can just go back to being 'friends', if- if- that was even real too." Tears streaming from tightly shut eyes, leaving tracks.
"I'm useless. He told me so.
And everyday, from now on.
Just an experiment.
"Told you, John. Breathing is boring."
John cried. Sherlock cried.
Sherlock was scared, so scared, but he didn't let this dash his hopes. He had to be strong for John. So he just told him the truth, plain and simple.
And then another step. And then at last Sherlock was standing right next to John.
"Exactly, John. For once you are spot on in your observations. Now do be quiet and kiss me."
John buried face in his hands, his shuttered eyes desperately holding back unshed tears and his shoulders quivering with, barely restrained sobs. He was angry and sad, so inexplicably sad. Angry that the one good thing in his life was also lying to him. Sad that not just their relationship, but also their friendship, had likely been all just an experiment.
"I was beginning to really like the man, as more than my superior. I could almost call it love. One day, he called me into his office. He said he was going to talk to me about a promotion."
He gasped. The racing thoughts in his head screeched to a grinding halt.
Silence.
And you're not tainted! Yes, that monster assaulted you- but you are pure. You are still John, and you are the best man I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.
But why? What could the male population have done to psychologically traumatize (because that's what had happened today) John so? What had a man done that made strong, fearless, non-emotional, soldier John press back against the wall, knees quivering, face pale, pupils dilated, breathing harsh, and look up at Sherlock with the dark blue eyes of prey that knows it's caught?
"Sherlock." That amused smile again.
There was a constant litany in his head, one that he couldn't shut up no matter how hard he tried.
Sherlock was surprised at the white-hot rage that burned his insides, threatening to make him explode. He wanted to murder this man, Sholto, make him pay for what he did to John. He would, on his own time. This wasn't something he would delegate to Mycroft- no, he would personally find this man and break him, as he had done to John. John deserved better. He was so consumed in his hatred for the man he had never met that he almost didn't hear John continue, in a quiet, resigned voice.
Now that he had figured it out, he had a more important task at hand: John. His brain, heart, and blood cried out for John. Screw his selfish emotions, he just wanted John to be happy. He just wanted to hold him and tell him it was OK, that he was here for him. But how could he if John was scared of his touch?
John shot him an incredulous look. Slightly amused, but definitely exasperated.
He ordered me to touch him as he smashed his tongue into my mouth. He licked my face and humped against me, him fully dressed, me fully naked. He noticed that I was crying and- and- bit my shoulder, hard, and told me to stop. So I stopped."
John croaked out, "No, Sherlock. Of course it's not your fault. Don't ever say that- I will never forgive you if you say anything bad about yourself again. I've blamed you so many times before, and it was never you, and it never will be you."
John felt tears spill and nodded his head. Of course he denies it. He squished down the little smidge of hope that he had just been overreacting that had arisen at his words. Instead, he opted for anger. His jaw clenched, he he stared resolutely at the ground.
"I'm fine, now at least. I was disgusted with myself for not being able to defend myself against my own father, so I joined the army. I had no money or shelter anyway, thought I might earn the money to go to med school. I've gotten past it. But I guess because you sneaked up on me from behind, some memory was triggered and I just lost it. I really apologize again, Sherlock, I'm so sorry. Everything's always my fault."
At risk of sounding stupidly sentimental, (who cares, you've already made an absolute fool of yourself today), Sherlock felt complete. That was it. He and John both melted into the kiss, forgetting all of the years they had lost, all the heartbreak they had put each other through, all of the misunderstandings, and just losing themselves in the other.
"Yes, John?"
"It is what it is."
John knelt down, and murmured an almost sobbed "sorry" to a stricken Sherlock, before checking for broken bones with the gentlest of touches. In fact, he seemed scared to even touch Sherlock after all that.
"Why do bad things happen to me?"
"It was Sholto."
John blinked, not sure he had heard right.
Sherlock then heard a sound he would never forget, one that made him back up immediately: John sobbed. Sherlock had never seen John cry before- he assumed that he rarely cried, and if he ever did, he certainly never let Sherlock see him. So the fact that John had let a sob rip through his body, was in fact continuing to cry and shake behind his hands, meant either he didn't recognize that Sherlock was there, or he didn't care. Most likely the latter. John fell to the floor in the fetal position, head to his knees, breaths coming fast and hard, like he was hyperventilating.
Wow, John's right. I really do think the world revolves around me.
Sherlock had never noticed. He scoffed at himself. How had he missed it, after being his best friend for years? And with his brain?
John would tell in his own time.
Then he leaned forward and kissed John, gently cupping his face in his large hands. John's eyes flew closed, but he couldn't stop the anguished sob that flew out of his mouth. He couldn't stop his hands from flying out and pushing Sherlock away, though his lips and brain and heart wanted to be even closer to Sherlock. He couldn't stop the tears that rolled down his cheeks, unable to stay within their confines.
A still shivering John grabbed at the wall and stood up. He slowly started backing away, like a trapped animal, clutching at the walls, the railing, anything, as he tried to get as far away from Sherlock as possible. He picked up the pace, all the while staring at Sherlock with a trembling, broken face full of raw fear. Sherlock's heart shattered again, for the second time that night, at the sight of that expression, directed at him. John then abruptly turned and fled to his room, stumbling on the seventh step, and slammed the door.
Sherlock proceeded to snog the living daylights out of John, who of course enjoyed it, but was all the same worried someone would see. They weren't exactly concealed, and could be seen at any time by any of the Yarders, who definitely didn't need more fuel to their fire. John didn't really consider himself an exhibitionist, but now wondered if Sherlock was. He did find that a little hot. Or maybe that was because Sherlock was licking his ear.
John let out a humorless snort. Donovan was right. He would follow Sherlock to hell and back- even if it was just John's personal hell. He wanted Sherlock to be happy, no matter how broken he was himself. He was inconsequential. Sherlock, on the other hand, was everything. He was the world's everything, his own everything... John's everything.
A single tear escaped the restraints of his shuttered eyelids and found its solitary way down the cheek of the most lonely man in existence.
Actually, scratch that. Not just contact with any other human- now that he thought about it, he seemed to only have such a reaction with males. John had gone out and presumably touched a number of females since knowing Sherlock (though notably none of those 'relationships' had worked out), so he was obviously fine with women touching him. But he hadn't seen him ever go near, much less make contact with, a single person of the male gender.
Sherlock groaned in anger and pounded a fist into the arm of John's chair. He seethed. John was a better than a great man, he was a good one, and Sherlock loved him, and he wanted to protect him from whatever this was caused by (even though that was silly, this had happened before they met), and he didn't. deserve. this. Not his John.
John sank back into his chair and let out a decidedly sad huff. After four days with no sleep, running around after Sherlock on a case, then a trying day at the surgery (a child had died), and then a terrible commute home, Sherlock wasn't even paying attention to him! He looked up, hoping Sherlock would notice his mood and bloody just ask him what was wrong, but no, Sherlock Holmes just didn't do things like that, did he? What were his exact words? "John, I guess since we're a couple now, I'll buy you dinner every other Saturday. Let me know if you will be requiring more from our relationship. Though to be honest I don't see it being much different than before. We just kiss more."
"It was probably all my fault- I shouldn't have sneaked up on you like that. It would surprise anyone."
He decided it was time to try and touch John. He cautiously reached a hand out to hold his hand.
"I noticed you were cold, earlier. Take my coat." He draped his wonderfully warm, wonderfully Sherlock coat around John's shoulders, who immediately sighed in pleasure.
John stared at him, waiting for a response. Sherlock remained quiet, though his thoughts were racing.
Only then did he notice the glow, out of the corners of his eyes- he had been looking solely at his feet as walked. There were strings of yellow lights strung around the trees, framing the moonlit pathway he was currently standing on with a soft glow. John's breath caught at the truly beautiful sight and his resolve not to think abruptly dissolved. He staggered to a nearby bench and sank down, just glad for the support. He didn't think he could stand for any longer.
"No, John. I happened to you and I'm pretty sure I'm awesome."
Bells were ringing, all right. Ringing in Sherlock's ears. A dull roar washed over Sherlock's brain as he put two and two together in a spectacularly slow ten seconds.
Sherlock listened with eager but anxious anticipation. John had never really told him the details of his time abroad before, saying that it was "a bit not good", so Sherlock had let it be. John had seemed happy to be with Sherlock, but besides the occasional nightmare, he never saw evidence that John's army days could still be haunting him.
"I- I want to. Sherlock, I want to let this go."
Was any of it real?
Sherlock reached both arms forward. "Is this ok?"
Sherlock eased open the door of their flat, intent on surprising John, who he could hear humming and puttering about in the kitchen.
Sherlock enveloped John in his arms, gently, softly, allowing him to feel the safety, his protection, his intention to never let anyone harm him again, all of his love for John in that one hug.
Sherlock panicked. He didn't know what to make of the situation, didn't know if John really hated Sherlock this much, didn't know how to help John, didn't know, didn't know, didn't KNOW. Sherlock wanted to comfort John again, but he understood that for some reason John didn't want Sherlock to touch him, so he didn't. John was still whispering, pleading.
After what felt like years in which sparks flew, fireworks boomed, every nerve in his lips spontaneously burst into flames, they broke apart for air.
He deposited Sherlock on the couch in the living room, and then sank with his head in hands into his own armchair. Neither spoke for many minutes- John because his world had crashed down around him, and Sherlock because it hurt too much.
Sherlock took a second to get over his shock that John loved him. And then he took another second to wonder how the hell perfect John could love someone as flawed as Sherlock. He then had a second of doubt, that John was joking, but quickly dismissed that, given John's state. No not a situation to joke. And then he was grateful. So grateful. He loved John more than he ever had in that moment- even during the worst moments in life, he had selflessly decided to give his life to others. Even after Sherlock had made him re experience the worst pain of his life, he still cared about Sherlock. Loved him, even.
"Sherlock?" A sleepy voice.
Sherlock drew a quiet, cleansing breath and turned the doorknob. As he entered, he didn't even look at John, in case it would scare him again. He was sure John was awake (he was good at differentiating sleep breathing, and furthermore knew that John didn't sleep when upset).
"I- uh, yesterday, we confessed our feelings to each other, or rather I confessed my love for you, and we agreed to partake in a sexual and romantic relationship... you didn't object, so I assumed that I was free to..."
Anderson poked in, placing his coffee cup on the counter. "No, you know what? He's probably not even horny. You know how he's always doing those morbid side projects. Maybe John's just one of his experiments. The sick bastard's giving Watson the time of his life, and then probably cataloging every one of his reactions in that 'mind palace' of his, in the name of science. I might have been wrong about them getting together, but I just KNOW that I'm right about this."
On some logical plane he knew he might be overreacting- this was coming from Anderson and Donovan, after all. He hated himself for placing doubt in Sherlock, for not believing that Sherlock had a heart. Sherlock had initiated their relationship. Had said that he had always liked John, and wanted to try this out. But he couldn't shake the thought that it was true.
Sherlock blinked. What?
Sherlock would kill the man responsible. He knew he was right about this, and he would find him, and kill him.
"I'm bisexual, Sherlock."
John, however, was not so fortunate as to have been born suave. He was left to gape after Sherlock's receding form. He opened and closed kiss-swollen lips a few times, finding that he actually kind of did care about his image, now that he had three sets of eyes glued to his every movement. He then realized that they were still looking at him, and attempted (and failed) to discreetly adjust his uncomfortably tight pants. He awkwardly mumbled something at the Yarders, then promptly turned on his heel and strode in the opposite direction, just short of mortified. Bollocks.
"John, you are my best friend, and much of what you just said to me, I feel towards you twice as much. You are invaluable to me." As I told you yesterday, he thought but didn't voice. Though he hated redundancy, it was always nice to hear John tell him these wonderful things he never thought anyone would say to him.
"Is this ok?"
Sherlock continued, for the first time ever unable to read John.
...How the hell?
John had had his doubts, of course. Never about Sherlock's capacity to love, no, always doubts of his own worth, his worth to someone as independent, and beautiful, and brilliant as Sherlock. Sometimes he just couldn't understand why Sherlock even kept him around, let alone be his boyfriend.
John fell apart.
"This, Sherlock. This is what is wrong. You just keep kissing me, and of course I lo- really like it, but... oh god this is hard... am I just an experiment to you? Please don't lie, Sherlock, I don't think I could take it. If that's what I am to you, I'm fine with it. Just- just, don't lie."
"But also for someone who says they like me how could you not notice that I WAS GONE FOR A BLOODY WEEK! A WEEK, SHERLOCK! What the actual HELL?!"
Just an experiment. Just an experiment. Just an experiment.
Sherlock froze in place, careful not to make any sudden movements, lest he scare John and lose the small trust he had gained.
John continued. "I was just getting curious, trying to figure myself out, but I knew what would happen if I came out to him, so I resorted to borrowing gay friends' magazines. He found me out, though."
If an experiment was all he was to Sherlock... well, so be it. How much ever he had always hated those experiments, those pointless, annoying, take-up-all-of-Sherlock's-time, more-interesting-than-John experiments, how much ever he wanted to curl into a ball and never come out of it again, he would be for Sherlock what Sherlock wanted him to be.
As hard as it was to accept that, Sherlock reluctantly closed his mouth, knowing from past experience when John talked this much he needed to just speak, much like when he was confessing to cheating on Mary.
"No, oh no, oh my holy no..."
John froze.
Sherlock stepped forward one more foot.
Dimmock laughed uncomfortably. "Yeah, I do get that feeling. I mean, Sherlock Holmes in a relationship? Like, did you see how he just abandoned Watson back there? How he just drags him all over the place, and the poor guy doesn't even notice that he's just the lovesick sidekick who's being strung along."
John had experienced a traumatic sexual assault, and he couldn't have men to touch him. Sherlock, in his own selfish intentions and having stupidly not noticed, had triggered a flashback, effectively unraveling all the years of care John had taken to hide his secret and protect himself through isolation.
"Sorry." A quick grin. Things were going to be ok.
John turned around and just looked at Sherlock. Just drank in his tall form, shining in the moonlight.
"Ok, John."
He helped Sherlock up from the floor, slinging a long arm over his shoulders (Sherlock couldn't help but wince at the irony of it all, even as he relished the touch- a few minutes ago, he had been slung over these same shoulders so violently, and now it was with the utmost care).
John felt a hand on his chin, gently tilting his head towards the other man.
More silence.
Stupid.
Sherlock was taking deep, pained breaths at this point. He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. He couldn't understand how someone could do this to John, to John.
Sherlock looked shell-shocked. For the first time in his life, he had been rendered speechless.
One more step.
John just sat resignedly, waiting for the admission that he had been just an experiment.
More than two hours of furious walking later, John noticed that he had wandered into an open park. Quite coincidentally, it was the one where he had met Stamford that fateful day. Night had fallen, and he found that it was quite chilly- he had left his bomber jacket in Lestrade's office. He shivered.
Well, that worked. The word vomit immediately stopped, replaced by complete silence. Sherlock's eyes were glued to John's as he watched the older man shift closer and turn around to face Sherlock. They were mere inches apart, and Sherlock couldn't think just from the proximity.
I know I am. Why do you love me? This is a trick, one of your experiments. I know it is. This was a mistake. I knew I shouldn't let you touch me! You're just like them, like him! I'm all alone, and I can't! Sherlock, I can't! I can't, I can't!
He knew John was blocking the door, so he waited for what seemed like hours until he heard John inevitably get up and stumble to his bed. He heard a rustling, and then silence- a long silence.
"Um...my father was abusive, alcoholic, terrible- when he was there, that is. He would hit me and Harry, and no one could help us because my mom had died of cancer when I was ten. We managed, Harry and I. We just had the usual beatings and fighting, and at least we were together."
John hadn't been there. That's why he didn't answer. I confessed my love and I assumed he was there and I thought it was a yes but he WASN'T THERE and OH MY GOD I JUST TOLD HIM NOW and THIS WASN'T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO and OH SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT back out Holmes back out RIGHT NOW
A carefully measured breath. A fluttering opening of eyes. A large, glaringly fake smile plastered across his face. He won't notice.
John's jaw dropped. "What?!"
Sherlock's breath caught, and he finally realized that John was scared of him.
What?
John also went quiet, after sometime.
John continued in a whisper. "I hated hated knowing that this man had been inside me in every way possible. In my brain, in my mouth, inside me, everywhere. I just couldn't- I was weak. And I broke down on his carpet. I begged him to stop. But he ignored me and kept violating me, this time with me on the floor. I was shaking and it just wouldn't stop and I wanted to die.
Stupid stupid stupid! Sherlock experienced a rare moment of complete disgust at his own slow, horridly misunderstanding brain.
We both have scars, and we'll both have to get over them- but we can do it together.
For someone as observant as himself, he had been quite blind. Quite stupid. Today was an all new record for Sherlock's stupidity.
He never really cared for John's moods, or showed much concern when he was sick or injured. He never asked about his day, or just give John a hug. Nope, none of the normal stuff.
"I know. I do too. And I give you my vow that no one else will hurt you. Ok?"
John didn't move at all-and then it was like all the tension in his body left him and he let out a sob. He relaxed, leaning into his palm, allowing himself to new touched by a man for the first time in years.
A hesitant nod.
"Sherlock, I like you too, you big git."
He knew they would be okay.
They had just started officially dating a few months before- and while it had been oh so good, with frequent 3 am make out sessions and waking up to see Sherlock's beautiful body, and then 7 am make out sessions, Sherlock was not so different from his usual, callous and indifferent self when on a case or during an experiment. He would often initiate romantic behavior at odd times, catching John off guard (in a pleasant way), but then stop at his liking, just leaving John hanging.
"Must I repeat myself? I thought you were cute," he muttered, still embarrassed at having been caught feeling... sentiment.
John pulled out his phone, confused, and saw a text from Sherlock, sent hours earlier, that he had missed in his earlier wallowing. It read, "Meet me at St. James' park at 9. SH". Still confused, John looked up at Sherlock.
"I- I saw you cry. I don't like it when you cry, I care about you. You know this isn't really my area, John. Please tell me what's wrong. Did someone do something to you? Tell me, I'll find them and hurt them."
Snap out of it! Why do you get distracted so easily? There are bigger things at stake here! You may never get John back!
"John. What's wrong?" A low, deep, voice, the one he would never tire of hearing, from next to him on the bench.
John hated himself, in that moment, for having let Sherlock be the one person he trusted. The one person he could love. The one person that had saved him. The one person he could be Johnwith. The one person he allowed himself to rely on. The one person with him he felt something akin to lov-
On the verge of another breakdown, John knew he had to stop this. He had already let Sherlock in too much, and just couldn't anymore.
"You surprised me from behind, and... " He took a deep breath, as if steeling himself. His hands clenched a few times, almost of their own volition, and after a few moments of tension, in which Sherlock was more unsure than he had ever been in his life, John spoke in a quiet, resolved tone.
"Of course, right, stupid question," muttered John, rolling his eyes.
"No, John! You're not useless, John. I need you. You have saved my life so many times, and in so many ways, I cannot even begin to express how much you mean to me. I love you so much, and so do so many other people! You helped so many people live better lives. You mean the world to me.
"Is this okay, John?"
John was scared.
Just an experiment.
"John, lighter!" Sherlock stuck a hand impatiently backwards.
And then, as if John had read his mind, something Sherlock always seemed to do to John instead, John softly laughed and said, "That's you, you idiot."
"Please, John. This is me you're trying to fool here. That 'smile' is even more obvious than a frown. I do notice, John."
He softly kissed Sherlock again, who melted again.
"Sherlock."
Sherlock crossed his legs, looked up with an eyebrow cocked up, and patted the space next to him. "It is Saturday, after all."
Lestrade laughed. "The office pool. I bet that you two would finally get together in January- Anderson actually fell for your "I'm not gay" crap! Hah- the fool." Ignoring an offended squawk from both Anderson and John, he continued, "I knew since I met you. So, thanks for the 100 pounds." He turned back around to his file cabinets, acting like he was reaching in to check that the case files Sherlock needed were still there, but really just concealing a wicked grin, knowing that he had likely just broken John.
And a reaction he got. But not the one he wanted.
Sherlock tried really hard to reply that it was ok, it was all right, he could tell it was not directed towards him, but he was finding it quite difficult to speak at the moment, so all he could manage was a reassuring, if a little pained, smile. He truly was sure John hadn't meant any of that, especially now that they were lovers- it was probably some soldier reflex, though he had caught the "I'm not letting you touch me again"... His heart sank as he thought of what that could possibly mean, but filed it away for a later time. He first had to make sure John didn't think he was taking this to heart. Though it did hurt like hell.
"Whatever. I warned John. The man's a freak, and Watson's stupid to have ever believed his feelings could be returned." Donovan shrugged, already bored by the topic. "Anderson, meet me in 30 in my office to discuss that case?" A none-too-discreet pointed look was sent in Anderson's direction.
John was screaming and crying, rocking in the fetal position.
How much ever John wanted Sherlock right now, this was getting out of hand. John grabbed Sherlock's shoulders, partly to push him away, partly to support himself, as his knees were going weak. He succeeded in separating himself from Sherlock by just a fraction of an inch.
"Oh my god, Sherlock." An eye roll. A sleepy, teary, happy smile.
Sherlock's heart rate had dramatically increased as John spoke, and he clenched the armrests of his chair so hard his knuckles turned white. He hadn't known all of this. No, not at all, or that bastard of a father would have been in jail a long time ago. How had he not noticed this? Why did his John have to go through all that pain? He didn't realize that John was looking at him concernedly, albeit with a haunted look, until he asked, "You ok?"
Finally he got off of me, and untied me so I could put my clothes on before someone could walk into his room to find a naked guy and start suspecting. He zipped up his pants, raked his eyes over my body with a triumphant grin, and left the room without another word.
John loved him?
John kept whispering, "All my fault," with a dazed look in his face.
Sherlock ran a hand under his shirt, the fingers of the other hand brushing the raised scar tissue on his shoulder. John shuddered in response to the stimulation. And John suddenly found he didn't care.
"I actually tried to end it all. Right then. I put my clothes back on and thought about showering, to die clean, but decided it didn't matter, that I would never be clean again. So I took the belt he had left, and tied a noose from the ceiling fan, right there in his room. It seemed fitting to die in the domain of the person who had conquered me, with his belt."
With the biggest grin on his face, he exclaimed, "John, you idiot. You absolute idiot. I've always told you that you're too stupid for your own good. I just tried to kiss you today! I've wanted to do that since you killed that cabbie for me! Can't you see, I love you John! I caused all this today because I love you!"
He slowly sat down on the bed and scooched over until he was sitting across from a still cocooned John, making sure to maintain eye contact with him the whole time. John tensed slightly, but didn't protest.
Just an experiment.
"NO, IT'S NOT OK!" John leaped up from his chair and came to stand in front of Sherlock, who couldn't help it- he winced.
John heard the genuine ring to his words, the words that resonated in his heart. And this time, he knew he wasn't lying. He went over the past few months of them together, of all of the physical things Sherlock had done, all the emotional things that he hadn't, and realized that this was the one thing Sherlock didn't know. He really did love John, and that was why he couldn't show it- he didn't know how. He had had his own demons, and all he could do was act like normal until he was sure he could show it, until he was sure John could accept it.
John's heart hurt, he loved him that much.
He crashed his lips into John's again, eliciting a moan from a flustered John. He had to admit, it made him a little proud that he could so easily unravel someone as emotionless and suave as Sherlock. His cheeks flushed with both the pleasure and heat of the kiss, but also from the potential embarrassment he would endure if caught in such a compromising situation. What would happen to his image?
Please let me touch you, John. Of course this is not a trick. I love you. I want to help you. Please let me."
"He ordered me to turn around. He used his belt to tie my hands to his desk. And he did it. He called me a sl*t, a useless waste of space, a failure of a man, a- a- f***."
"Ok, I never wanted to have to tell anyone this, but I think you deserve an explanation after the right arse that I've been to you."
"Mmf. Sher-"
But he respected John's privacy, and the intensity of his reaction led him to believe that if there was any way he could be helped, he had to ensure that John divulged on his own terms. He had to prove himself worthy of John's pain, especially after what he had caused today.
He all but raced out of the Yard, not really caring where he was headed. He just walked, walked until he felt his insides wouldn't melt.
And stayed frozen. Sherlock was no expert on kissing but he was sure that John was supposed to have kissed him back by now. Maybe he's so happy I'm finally kissing him, his overanalyzing brain happily supplied. Yes, that must be it. He resumed kissing John, hoping against hope for a reaction.
"John. I have always been there. I will always be there. I will always hold you, whether or not you need it. I love you, John, and nothing will ever change that."
John attempted a watery, sad, resigned smile, his eyes trained on Sherlock's.
"I- I love you. I need you."
Some part of his brain was still reeling from that kiss, though.
Sherlock immediately opened his mouth to protest that frankly ridiculous notion, but John shook his head and cut in before he could get in a word. "No- I know you'll say that you will never hate me, or that I'm entitled, or some bullshit like that, but I know that I've messed up so many times in the past, and I always blamed you and put you through so much pain unfairly. Let me take the blame now."
John kept up his steady stream of whispered "All my faults", each of which caused Sherlock's heart to clench painfully. But he kept quiet.
After wiping his tears of laughter, John looked at Sherlock with the softest look possible, and Sherlock could feel his heart stutter. He reached out, cupping his aquiline face, and stroked his thumb over one of the bruises there- still guilty, but oh so tender. No one had ever looked at him like that, like he was the most precious thing they had encountered, and he felt honored to be seen that way by John. He also wanted that look saved forever, so he committed it to the wing in his mind palace dedicated to just John, along with the kiss, and that giggle, and- it would need remodeling later.
Sherlock stepped up behind a still-oblivious John. He breathed out a silent sigh of excitement, and then all of a sudden snaked his arms around the shorter man's waist, rested his head on top of John's (he had to lean down a bit), and squeezed as tight as he could. He poured years of pent up affection in that one hug, and would have said something (he didn't know what exactly)... if it hadn't all gone to hell.
Sherlock just marveled at John's idiocy. Coming out after getting together? New low, John, new low. Even for you.
Sherlock had never in his life heard a more scared sound. His eyes snapped open. His heart nearly broke in two to hear strong, fearless John, his John, making such a sound.
"I know you're upset. Don't try to fake it, please, tell me what's wrong."
"Might as well finish", sighed John, after a while.
Sherlock waited until the cries had faded to hiccups, and then to silence.
"...and the texture, what a texture-"
"...they're quite lovely, aren't they, like little nuts, but they taste like ginger
"But I stopped myself. It had finally dawned on me that I was a soldier. I would fight. Even if I couldn't find a reason to live for myself, I vowed to make my life useful to someone else."
Why keep it secret? Of course. It was with a man. Whether or not John was bisexual, he had always stood so staunchly behind his straightness, and couldn't admit that it was with a guy. He felt ashamed. Ashamed that it was a man. Ashamed that his soldier instincts had failed him when it mattered. Ashamed that he was weak, and tainted, and...
"Anything, John."
A whimper.
But the second his hand touched John's arm, John visibly jumped and receded, recoiled further into his own skin. The small man became even smaller. What struck Sherlock was how he didn't even try to fight back- John was helpless. He went silent at the touch, with a sharp gasp, and Sherlock was momentarily able to breathe again, thinking John had snapped out of it- but then John looked up into Sherlock's eyes with the expression of a victim who knows he is going to die, and whispered, "No, please."
"You know, I made a good bit of money off of you two. Never did thank you for that."
John let out a whimper.
John was silent for a bit, and then, just when Sherlock thought he would give up and leave, he spoke softly.
He looked at Sherlock, as if asking for permission to sit next to him on the couch- it broke Sherlock's heart that he felt like he was such a danger to Sherlock that he couldn't sit next to him. He nodded and smiled as reassuringly as he could. John tentatively sat down, almost at the other end of the couch.
Sherlock had barged into Lestrade's office at Scotland Yard to pester him for access to confidential materials pertaining to a case. John had begrudgingly followed, apologizing for the destruction in his wake.
"Yeah, I mean that I like you. In fact, have been in love with you ever since I met you." There was a note of nervousness in John's tone, but it was mostly flat and emotionless. "I figured I might as well tell you, because you've already seen me at my worst, and you'll probably never want to see me again now that you know how tainted I am."
Still panting hard, a giddy Sherlock opened the door of 221B for John in a rare, chivalrous gesture. John looked at him, surprised for only a second before they both burst into adrenaline-fueled giggles. John turned to hang up his coat, still chuckling, and Sherlock snuck a genuine grin at his back, the special one he reserved only for John, when he didn't know Sherlock was looking.
Totally worth the embarrassment.
John, a pretty observant man, did not miss this and immediately retreated, clenching his fists together as he did whenever he was angry. Angry at himself, Sherlock presumed. God, how he wanted to soothe him, and tell him it was alright. He didn't judge John. Stupid reflexes! He growled at his transport. Why did you have to go flinch and make him feel worse?!
Sherlock had no sense of personal space, for sure, but that was when it came to other people. He resented hugs or any such physical show of affection, and avoided human contact like the plague, unless necessary for exploitation, of course.
He sat straight on the bench, about to open his eyes and go home and goddamn sleep.
Hearing no response, Sherlock took it as he took all silence, as stunned appreciation of his genius, and went back to his experiment, satisfied that he was now able to do all those delicious things to John that he had wanted to do for so long.
John gulped for air.
He would have just walked on, but then he heard what they were saying and froze in his tracks, just barely able to see the three drinking coffee.
"He came up from behind me, and I guess he must have seen what I was looking at, because I didn't notice until he had already clouted me on the head. I was dizzy, and too scared to defend myself. He threw punch after punch, kick after kick, until all I could see was the blood dripping down my eyes. He continuously yelled "fag", and "disgusting", and other slurs until I felt like throwing up, both from pain and nausea. I was sure I had at least a concussion, a few broken ribs, and a broken leg. Luckily, he was so drunk that he passed out, and I called 999. I don't know how I survived."
"Anderson, you have truly proved yourself an imbecile, even by your own superbly low standards. How could the victim have done it?"
It took just three seconds for John to get acclimated to Sherlock's touch- then John clawed at the first of the outer layer of blankets, still sobbing. Sherlock understood, and calmed him down by grabbing his hands. He rubbed comforting circles into the backs of his hands, in response to which John sobbed harder and stared up at him, eyes full of equal parts apprehension and love. Sherlock smiled at him, then slowly peeled off each blanket, layer by layer, until just John was left.
"How did it happen?" he quietly asked, still facing the now closed door.
John shot a dark look at Sherlock, who was currently dousing the corpse hanging from the ceiling of their flat in kerosene, oblivious to John's mental trauma.
Then John froze. And violently pulled back. He shrunk back into himself, removing all possibility of contact with Sherlock.
Sherlock heard the frantic click of a lock, followed by a long, gut-wrenching silence, interrupted only by harsh breathing- then, a heavy sliding down the door, and muffled sobs.
He stumbled back against the counter, taking shaky breaths. He seemed about to bolt from the room, when he remembered that Sherlock had just taken a major beating. Sherlock thought for a moment that he might just freak out and leave, but he practically saw John's doctor side coming out.
Sherlock took a lap of faith and brushed his hand over the only visible part of John's body, his cheek. He gently cupped it in his palm.
I just sat on his carpet, naked, for hours. My skin felt so filthy, and my mouth, and mind, and every place he'd touched. How could I clean my insides? I'd let someone take what little was left of me. I'd already basically given up my useless life to the war, and now I wanted to end it."
"NO, how many times, John, it's not. Though it hurts-" he didn't miss the flash of guilt on John's face- "it makes even more sense now. I shouldn't have come up behind you."
Sherlock inwardly sighed- it wasn't fair that they'd just started their relationship and already John was too scared to be close to Sherlock.
"But just know that I'm so grateful- you don't know how grateful- that you will always be my best friend, no matter- no matter how much I hurt you, and I'll be happy to even be just a small part of your life. So happy."
He had lit up like a Christmas tree when Lestrade had knocked on their door with a positive cornucopia of cases to be solved. Pleased to see that John looked equally excited to finally have a case, he had grabbed his Belstaff and favorite blue scarf, and brushed past Lestrade with a muttered "Thank you, Geoff." Lestrade had been so surprised that he had actually gotten a 'thank you' out of the detective that he almost didn't mind the butchered name. He and John just exchanged surprised smirks, and then John left the flat right on Sherlock's heels, eager for a good case, hopefully one with a chase.
John took deep, steadying breaths. Soldier breaths.
As the flat filled with a quite terrible smell of burned, dead flesh, and as Sherlock took note of the process with morbid fascination, John just grumbled to himself.
"I trust you, Sherlock. I'm telling you because I lo- trust you." Sherlock thought he had heard something, maybe some subtext to that, but left it for later, touched that John said he trusted Sherlock.
He heard John's breath hitch behind him. He waited for an answer, or a response, neither of which came.
"I wasn't- ohhh- doing anything particularly arousing. I was just being there-"
Donovan, Dimmock, and Anderson. Ok, no big deal, to be expected. They really can't mind their own business, can they?
...No, duh, John, last time I checked, me and you are both males, and thus we agreed to be in homosexual relationship just yesterday... Sherlock proceeded to give the most incredulous look at John, who was nervously awaiting a response from Sherlock.
Then he nodded.
When he saw the look on Sherlock's face, John croaked out, "Yeah, surprise, I am actually gay. Who woulda thunk?"
John's breath hitched. Of course he had found him. He always did. I can't do this.
He really wanted to devour John right then, but decided that maybe if John was really so shocked by his pointing out the obvious, Sherlock would give him some time to understand (he took longer than Sherlock to process things, obviously), and then jump his bones. After all, even he was surprised- he'd expected some oppositions, maybe an "I'm not gay!" or a "What the hell, Sherlock?!" It was almost too good to be true, how quickly he had gotten John. But he wasn't going to complain.
"No, I mean... wait, you think I'm... What?!"
Then only did he notice the other details that had escaped him earlier, or that he had selectively left out, in his singular goal of kissing John, and in the brief mental short circuit afterwards. That John was clutching the wall behind him as if wanting to melt into it, as if it was the only thing holding him up. That John was drawing fast, laboured breaths that were not of arousal, and that his eyes were jumping and his legs were shaking, but definitely not of arousal. That John was whimpering.
He asked again, gentler, almost in a whisper, "How did it happen?" He turned around and saw John staring at him, cocooned in all of his blankets, with only his eyes peeking out, on the bed.
John was silent for a moment, watching him mutely.
"I had these lights put up for you. I was going to tell you- tell you today, that I love you. But you'd already come here, of your own volition."
He must have been sexually assaulted by one.
John grinned that one-sided smile back, but it quickly faded. He drew in a deep breath, then started, hesitantly at first.
Sobbing. A barely there nod.
"This?"
Sherlock's face immediately reddened, and he gave an embarrassed shrug, looking anywhere but at John. "I was just so happy and excited that I was finally able to hug and kiss you, like I've wanted to do for years. You looked so incredibly cute, swaying your hips and singing while cooking in the kitchen. I- you were too irresistible."
John barely realized that they were leaving the break room, and with what was left of his brain, he quietly moved back into the main corridor. He refused to think about anything.
John's fingers were still ghosting over his long body, cataloging the damage and looking sick to his stomach. After a few minutes, he quietly said, "No broken bones or concussion. Your stomach is going to heavily bruise, and you'll be sore for a few days, but no lasting damage."
Sherlock wanted to try an experiment.
Just an experiment.
"I only ever see them kissing. Holmes is probably just horny all the time, 'cos who in their right mind would want him, and saw no one better than the one person who actually trusts him to take advantage of. Easy pickings, John is- he's like a dog, always loyal to the freak. Would probably follow him to hell and back and never know it."
But what he couldn't have ever foreseen was him ending up on the kitchen floor, clutching his head, and wheezing through brutal kick after kick from... from John himself.
"Ok."
But he didn't care, because despite his tremendous pain caused by John's pain, he was happier beyond his capability, happier than he had ever been.
"Shut up, John, and let me kiss you. You looked so hot in there, I couldn't think of anything else. That must be why I was wrong. I can't stop wanting you, and it's messing up my brain process."
We are soldiers today.
John spluttered. "I- how- you-"
"...Oh."
He walked down the maze like hallways of Scotland Yard, making his way towards the exit, when he heard familiar voices from around a corner, from what he knew to be the break room. He would've just shrugged and moved on had he not heard his own name thrown around. Immediately curious, and a little anxious that his earlier escapade with Sherlock had already reached judging ears, he paused in his purposeful stride and quietly peered around the wall.
He cautiously stepped forward one foot, pausing and watching John's reaction carefully.
"Never leave me. Always hold me... Please."
Sherlock turned his head sharply towards John. He wanted to? With who?
He had screwed up more than when he jumped off the roof to save John, because even though he had 'killed' John by saving him then, he had come back. There was no coming back from this. Whatever little progress he had thought he was making, confessing his true feelings to John, today night's events had just set it back years.
"What?" John looked up at him with a confused frown.
He ran a shaky hand through his curls, grabbing a fistful and pulling hard on his scalp. He needed the pain, to set his mind straight and force him to think, think about how to fix this seemingly un-fixable situation; forget furthering their relationship, he had small hope that he could even salvage it.
He stared at Sherlock, eyes glowing.
Blinded to the truth by his own affection. Affection that might not even be returned.
Sherlock proceeded to have a mental short circuit, and John just chuckled fondly. Lestrade looked over fondly at their banter, not even attempting to hide the wide grin on his face.
John froze for the second time in as many seconds, eyes seeming to clear as he finally noticed exactly who he was mutilating. And then his entire face crumpled in horror.
A moment's silence.
Sherlock saw John's confused look, but gained some confidence when he saw it turn into one of attraction (widening pupils, hitched, faster breath, trembly knees)- or so he thought. His heart beating at the speed of light, he slowed his pace as he came within a mere five inches of John's quivering lips. Trying with all his might not to betray his immense excitement, he languidly reached a hand up and placed it on the wall over John's head, bracing himself. He threw on a sexy smile, one he knew worked wonders on the ladies (always good for manipulation, they actually thought he cared) and used his other hand to tilt John's chin up towards him. He relished their height difference, loving the feel of towering over John, of John looking up at him with dancing eyes. He leaned down and before he could think anything else, he kissed John.
Or at least he thought he couldn't think until he really couldn't think, because his brain had switched off, because John Watson was kissing him.
To hell with image.
He vowed to himself to figure it out, though- if not for the sake of his friend, then selfishly for his own need for his friend, and even more selfishly for the blow his ego was taking at not understanding why.
"You never stop surprising me." Sherlock pulled back with a grin after a moment.
"..."
Momentarily stunned that John had recovered so quickly, and secretly kind of glad that more emotional stuff wasn't necessary (it really wasn't his forte), Sherlock blinked in surprise. Then he broke into a grin, and did a little happy dance in his head. My John, he's back, he's ok!
"...and therefore, John, I see it fit that we be together romantically, physically, and whatever other way there is possible. I want it, and you haven't objected, so I'm assuming we're on the same page? Yes. Partners in every sense of the word."
Sherlock looked up, shocked. He had never expected John to be one to take his life, but then his experience was quite horrific.
He slowly walked around his desk towards me, stopping in front of me. Then he slapped me hard. Across the face.
Sherlock blinked. "...Actually, yeah. Wait. Oh my god, I was wrong? I was wrong. How-"
John spoke again, in a hoarse whisper. "We were in Afghanistan. I had just joined the ranks, and he was my superior. I had no family, and not many friends. My sister had just passed away after two years in an alcoholic coma, so I was feeling that my medical education was of no use if I couldn't have saved her. So I enlisted in the military so I didn't feel so useless."
Sherlock flashed him a smile, his heart warming and his throat slightly closing. This was the most open they'd been in ages, and though he outwardly abhorred emotion, he was inwardly so glad for it.
"Mmm."
"Anyway, since then I haven't been able to get close to a man. I couldn't believe that the first guy I almost fell for could hurt me in such a way, so now I freak out at any male romantic touch. I don't know anymore. Even if I want to be with someone that way, I can't."
“What is she supposed to be?” Sherlock asked as one of the assistant teachers greeted them at the door.
Hope you all have a Happy New Year!
They sat there unspeaking, the silence only broken by pizzicato notes as Sherlock’s fingers worked their way up and down the violin. He knew Mycroft was deducing the likelihood of his returning to the crack house the moment he was left alone.
Sherlock nodded toward Rosie, who was wandering toward the carnival rides, “I thought she’d like to see this.”
She gave him a look.
“Lestrade! Call an ambulance!”
John opens his mouth to ask again what exactly the experiment is about but is interrupted when Sherlock’s phone rings.
“Not really, no.”
I blushed and fell silent.
Sherlock reached into John’s dresser and pulled out a different one altogether.
Sherlock glances at a set of petri dishes on the counter which are filled with samples of water taken from various locations along the river.
“But this is -”
“You won’t find either of them in a missing person report,” he adds.
John met his gaze in the mirror and raised an eyebrow.
John opens his mouth to apologize again but she cuts him off, “Don’t worry. If it wasn’t Sherlock Holmes last night it’d be a screaming parent somewhere down the road. Trust me, I’ve seen worse. Better those kids learn now while they have time to switch to another career, than 4 years from now when they’re buried in student loans.”
John laughed as he restacked the papers on his desk into a tidy pile, then turned back toward the kitchen.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “
“I’m sorry,” he said, “I didn’t mean to fall asleep on your bed.”
“So you’re saying that someone tried to break into practically every house on this street
“Well, she remembers you.”
No update tomorrow since I'll be spending time with family, but I'll be back the following day with the next chapter.
“So?” says Sherlock.
Sherlock looks up at her, his eyes narrowed. “You’re trying to get me to leave.”
John smiles and shakes her hand. “Thanks for patching me up.”
“They look so happy. Hard to believe those two haven’t figured it out yet.”
Molly appeared at Sherlock’s elbow.
“Clearly it wasn’t ‘nothing’,” Sherlock said.
John shook his head and moved the melting ice cream to the sink.
16 December 21:42
“Seem?” John asks, in mock indignation. He pulls Sherlock closer and kisses his neck.
Mycroft shakes his head in disbelief.
With a shake of his head, Sherlock brings himself back to the case. “So they chose this place,” he says, “Then what? How did they do it?”
“Your phone?” John said, trying to get his bearings again.
“And Daddy’s gonna teach me to skate!” she said.
Instead he focused on chemistry and logic, only diving into his music to explore the strange connection he seemed to have formed with a mysterious friend who existed only in his mind.
Anyway, I ended up writing this chapter because if my friends with kids tell me one more time about how they forgot to “move the damn elf” I’m gonna give them a single sock for Christmas and tell them to set the “damn elf” free. (If anyone doesn’t get that reference, 10 points from Gryffindor.)
He noticed it first when Sherlock was staying with him while Mrs. Hudson made arrangements to rebuild the flat. He had seemed uncomfortable at the house and John didn’t blame him - even he is haunted by the memories of Mary and the wedge she had driven between them time and time again. After about a week Sherlock had gone to crash in Mycroft’s spare bedroom until 221B was fit for habitation and John had let the matter drop, but now that he’s home he can’t ignore it.
“What calendar?”
He couldn’t keep his mind from jumping to Sherlock as he made his excuse.
She nodded.
7 February 14:02
It was odd. Not the icicles - John had found far worse things in their kitchen before, but he had thought all the food in the freezer had melted during the last case when Sherlock had removed everything to test how long it took for meat to freeze solid. He took a closer look and he realized that Sherlock had replaced the melted ice cream with a fresh pint of John’s favourite flavour. Of course, he hadn’t bothered to do any of the other shopping.
Sherlock returns the phone to his pocket.
Sherlock smirked and reached into his pocket. “Speaking of which -”
Sherlock bit back the feeling of hope that kept trying to rise up inside of him. He was content to have John and Rosie with him, grateful to be part of their little family. It wouldn’t do any good wishing for something more between him and John. And yet, there was the way John had thanked Angelo for the candle instead of ignoring it, the way his hand had lingered on Sherlock’s before he’d picked up his phone. Sherlock cursed himself for the umpteenth time. If only he’d let that call go to voicemail he might have had his answer.
"Mycroft?"
"Yes love. You can keep him." Rosie laughed with joy and tried to wiggle off the saddle to no avail. Sigyn lifted her up and placed her on the ground. Rosie ran up to Sherlock and jumped into his arms. He hugged her tight. John joined them and wrapped his arms around both of them. Sigyn smiled and took Gladstone into his new stable. She gave him some grains and locked him in.
"She's up in her room, playing." John walked over to the stairs and yelled up,
"Greg." A knock at the door startled both of them. Greg poked his head in with a smile.
"Mrs. Hudson, would you mind?"
Sigyn and Greg were sitting at the kitchen peninsula eating their breakfast. A nice little routine had formed over the last few week. Greg and Sigyn would get up around the same time and each do their morning activity. Greg would finish his swim and Sigyn would finish her ride around the same time. One would wait for the other and Greg would hop on the back of Sigyn's horse. They ate breakfast together. Occasionally Mycroft would join them, but he would usually be gone by the time they got back.
Im sorry this is shorter than the last.
"Let's watch a movie."
"Umm, I actually graduated early. I walked the stage on Friday before I came here. My father doesn't know. I'm not sure how to tell him."
"You asked me out before I had a chance to ask you, you said 'I love you' first, you brought up the idea for you moving in here. I thought I was a step ahead of you for the first time in our relationship. Then again, you always were difficult to deduce." Mycroft pulled out the ring he had and opened it for Greg.
), and finally terrified (
Sherlock tries to act unimpressed but John knows the sparkle in his eyes and twitch of his lips that betray his excitement.
He moans as Sherlock’s lips return to his neck in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
His smile disappears as soon as they enter. There are abandoned display cases half covered with ratty fabric, some tables adorned with sheet metal and a few stray tools, but nothing remotely resembling a machine that could be used in a highly organized counterfeiting scheme.
“I found your missing man,” he said nodding over his shoulder toward the trees.
after romance? That can’t be it. Not after everything that had happened since the case ended. Not after last night. John is sure more than ever that their dinner and walk beneath the stars was meant to be a date. But if Sherlock felt the same way what was the point of calling the roses an experiment?
Holmes shook his head and took the pouch from my hands, exchanging it for the newspaper the girl had left behind.
The next day there’s no new rose on the table when John makes his way into the kitchen. It’s hard to tell initially with the small army of roses in various beakers and jars but he counts and confirms that there are still only eleven flowers, same as yesterday.
“It’s the holidays.”
“Just tell me,” John says, “This...experiment - what were you hoping for?”
The rose is a glorious shade of orange, the color of sunrise, or flames burning low in the fireplace. John reaches out to run his fingers across the petals which are only just beginning to open. As he looks closer he sees the many slight variations in hue, ranging from a deep reddish tinge at the tips to a honey-gold center, as if the flower itself is a flickering flame. It’s unusual - he can’t remember the last time he saw an orange rose, but somehow the color is familiar, comforting. It reminds him of the fire dancing low on late winter nights, of sitting in his chair and pretending to read while watching as Sherlock plays a haunting melody on his violin. The rose fades from his vision and in its place he sees Sherlock, framed by midnight London beyond the window, the faint glow of streetlamps and the flickering fire casting him into dramatic shadows, the fabric of his shirt stretching across the rise and fall of his shoulder blades as he draws the bow across the strings.
Sherlock finally rises from the sofa and storms over to the kitchen. “So, you prefer this?” he asks, eyes narrowed.
This is what has been haunting Sherlock, even more than the chaos Eurus, and Mycroft by extension, wreaked on his mind palace - the idea that John will leave him. It kills John to know that his fears are not unfounded. They both have a terrible habit of leaving each other but something always pulls them back together, like a magnetic force, or a planet orbiting its sun.
It’s been one month since the end of Sherlock’s “social experiment”. One month since John Watson kissed Sherlock Holmes for the first time and all the loose ends in their lives fell into place. Sometimes John still has trouble believing that this beautiful, amazing man he’s wanted for so long, is really his.
Life has been crazy (mostly in a good way) since I last updated. Please excuse any inaccuracies - this hasn't been beta'd or brit-picked and my knowledge of London comes from books, tv shows, and the 5 days I spent there at the end of summer.
The previous night his father destroyed all his tapes of classical music saying that it was time for John to man the fuck up and stop listening to that pansy ass nonsense.
“What?”
, John. The roses. You prefer this one don’t you.” Sherlock nods at the yellow rose. John glances between it and the orange one from yesterday which is still sitting on the far corner of the table. He’s uncomfortably aware of Sherlock hovering behind him, glaring.
-----
“You know who I am,” came Sherlock’s voice, “unless you lot are as stupid as you look.”
Sherlock nodded and drew the bow across the strings again. It wasn’t exactly a holiday song but it was something a little more melodic to fill the silence while they waited for their guests to arrive. As John added another log to the fireplace, Sherlock drifted into one of his own compositions.
“For god’s sake I wasn’t lying to her!” John said, “It was just a rose. Where are you even getting this stuff?”
When we reached the top of the stairs the light seeping in through the crack in the door was a bit brighter than it had been before, though there was no way we had been inside long enough for the sun to be rising.
Orange Rose meanings:
“Why not? It’s the 21st century.”
Eventually Sherlock looked up.
“Sherlock! What the hell?”
“What?”
7 February 13:56
Finally, one night about two weeks after moving back, John comes downstairs after checking on Rosie to find Sherlock perched on his chair, knees hugged to his chest, staring into the dying fire.
“I mean, it’s been years, but it’s just something about the holidays that reminds you...”
“You want to talk about it?”
Special shout out for those of you who stuck with this story from the beginning. This was my first time posting fic so reading your kind words and seeing those kudos notifications along the way was so encouraging. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
“You made coffee,” John says, unsure what to make of this. The last time Sherlock made him coffee he’d found himself locked in a lab, terrified for his life.
7 February 14:27
“I know, right?” the girl said, misreading his reaction, “all these probabilities and statistics. I don’t know why they’re calling for an early election. Does it make any sense to you?”
Meaning of Green Roses: renewal of life and energy; new beginnings. They are also perfect for someone who is embarking on a new venture, or recovering from a stint of illness.
“When’s the last time you slept?”
Stories about ghosts floated across my brain and I had half convinced myself that we had been led here by a restless spirit when I heard Holmes muttering to himself, mentally retracing our steps.
John casts one more glance outside to assure himself that they are alone then joins Sherlock behind a stack of boxes.
Thankfully she took this as a cue to leave and John breathed a sigh of relief before adding a short note to her chart.
“What on earth are you doing, Sherlock?”
The next evening found the pair of them at the outdoor rink in Hyde Park. They rented skates and made their way over to the ice.
Sherlock gives his head another shake then buries his face in John’s pillow, shoulders trembling with silent sobs.
I followed my friend’s advice and left to visit my patient. After seeing that he was doing well I strolled down the street and took a detour past the Old Bailey. Even though the trials were on hold for another fortnight reporters milled about asking passersby for opinions while newsboys wandered in and out of the crowd trying to sell the most recent papers.
(See the end of the chapter for
the body had taken so long to show up after he’d been reported missing. It wasn’t as if the spot was that well hidden.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow.
“Are you going to check that?” Alice asked somewhere around the tenth text alert, “It might be important.”
-----
“John,” Sherlock interrupted, “Didn’t you already save our seats?”
“Really?” Sherlock says, “If you knew you were going to die, would you want this to be the last thing you saw?” He gestures around at the flickering lights, oil-stained floors, and the slightly pornographic graffiti, “Real romantic place, hmm? You think Romeo and Juliet would agree?”
John scanned the page and found a list of various rose colours and their meanings.
When they caught up with him, Sherlock had raised his head and was staring up at the trees. For a moment Greg thought he was actually crying and felt a stab of guilt but then realized Sherlock was sniffing the air like a dog trying to catch a scent.
The words tumbled from Sherlock’s mouth before he could stop them, before he could even think. It was the wine and Molly’s stupid words of encouragement and the way the fire and Christmas lights illuminated John’s face, making him feel like anything was possible. And now he’d gone and ruined everything. He heard John’s sharp, surprised breath and pushed himself up, showering them both in pine needles. He was halfway across the room before he heard John scramble to his feet.
Obviously. An experiment needs variables to be successful.
“Boring,” Sherlock says.
She blushed and Sherlock watched as her eyes strayed to the other side of the room where Greg was building a lego tower with Rosie.
“Oh, you know,” says Sherlock waving his hand vaguely.
There’s a pause before Sherlock answers, “In a manner of speaking.”
So the experiment is still on, hmmm? ;)
The man’s eyes widened in surprise and fear and he held the light in front of him like a weapon.
John’s heart jumped, then he realized what Rosie was actually asking.
“Thank you,” he says, “for saving my life.”
“I don’t do it on purpose,” Sherlock said and John could almost hear him pouting.
“And ‘Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt’,” I replied.
), sometimes guilty (
“Nah,” John said, “I know I’d end up being the one who has to move that damn elf every day.”
Greg stared after him, trying to process his words. Did he actually have a chance with Molly? Had Sherlock meant that, or had he just been lashing out? And Sherlock had all but admitted that he had feelings for John. That should have been a triumph, yet as he watched Sherlock wrap his coat tighter around him and stare at the ground, he realized that the brilliant detective really couldn’t see what was right in front of him when it came to John Watson. He shook his head and followed Sherlock, beckoning for Rosie to follow.
Rosie
After a month of dating she seemed ready to take their relationship to the next level. They seemed to fit. It should have been perfect. But as they walked hand in hand through the rose gardens in Regent’s Park a soft breeze swirled around them. She sighed with contentment and nestled into his arms.
He hadn’t realized how few happy Christmas memories he had in the years before Rosie.
“It doesn’t even look like an elf,” Sherlock said he followed John down an aisle full of lego kits.
“That’s not a secret.”
“You’d be disappointed then. She’s likes to travel, but she’s pretty normal by your standards.”
Sherlock is seated at his microscope, completely absorbed in the sample he’s examining. John finds he’s a bit disappointed, especially after last night.
Sherlock gasps but continues, “Well, a proper experiment has many variables. You have to test different circumstances and in this situation it’s not only my assessment that counts -” he trails off as John nibbles lightly on his lower lip.
“Sherlock -”
The loud scraping of the chair against the floor rouses Sherlock. He glances over at John who wills his body not to betray him and forces himself to maintain eye contact for what he hopes is long enough to allay suspicion. After a few seconds Sherlock rises and crosses to the kitchen. He reaches into the throng of flowers, extracts a new one - yellow with orange stripes, and places it on the desk in front of John with a smile.
He turned the card over and glanced briefly at me before instructing the landlady to send him up.
“Are you thinking about your wife?”
Lestrade returns with two cups of coffee, a crease in his brow and dark circles under his eyes. He hands one of the cups to John and snatches a half-folded paper from Sherlock’s hands. “Sherlock, stop that or I’ll have you arrested.”
“Hope tonight wasn’t too unbearable for you,” John said.
John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist to steady him.
“Then why -”
“The last time we did it, we were fifteen. I thought we were getting a bit old for it, but Harry insisted. That’s when she told me about this girl in her literature class she fancied. Said she wished she could tell mum and dad.”
I confess that I am, myself, still in disbelief of all that has transpired though it has been several years (or depending on your perspective, several lifetimes) since the events recorded below took place. Time is a strange thing, as we discovered on this most peculiar case. Very strange indeed.
“Would you like to go out tonight?”
“John, good! I have a list. Are you at the shops yet?”
“You were out late last night,” Sherlock says in response, still keeping his back to John.
John smiles, then startles at the sound of Sherlock’s bedroom door opening. He busies himself making breakfast as the man in question shuffles into the room, dressing gown askew, dark curls a deliberate mess. Christ, how is it possible for someone to look that gorgeous when they’ve just rolled out of bed? John gives his head a little shake to clear it and turns to rummage through the cabinets.
“Good afternoon, Dr. Watson,” she greets him, “I’m Dr. Montgomery. We met last night, but I’m afraid you were a bit out of sorts.”
“You didn’t see her again?” Sherlock asked, only slightly surprised. John had a habit of dating girls for a few weeks then stop calling altogether when things started to get serious. Yet another reason Sherlock gave for not acting on his feelings for John. That and the fact that he was sure they wouldn’t be reciprocated.
“I don’t know. Weren’t there elves in...what was that movie you liked?”
He feels Sherlock smile against his lips,
Sherlock sighed and lay back to rest his head on John’s pillow. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to imagine, just for a moment, that what he wanted was possible.
“So,” John says, eyes still closed, “how are your results looking?”
“Back where?” John mumbles and tries to burrow into the couch cushions where he hopes he’ll be able to fall back asleep.
The name of today’s mystery rose: “Red Soldier” or “Fusilier”. I’m sure you can all figure out who it reminded Sherlock of and why.
She jumped and the crayons around her went flying in all directions.
“What the
She gave him a look that clearly said,
For Christmas I would like:
“Wrong. Who are you anyway?” asks Sherlock. The young man opens his mouth to reply but Sherlock waves his hand. “Never mind. Go away.”
John sighed and gave Sherlock’s arm a squeeze before turning to welcome their guests. Molly’s eyes darted between the two of them as John took her coat and Sherlock gave a vague wave with his bow in greeting before raising it to the strings and launching into a rendition of “We Wish You a Merry Christmas.”
I hope you like my cookies when you come to visit. Mrs. Hudson is going to help me make them shaped like snowmen this year.
Holmes turned down a street that looked vaguely familiar and smiled.
When we came to a copse of trees with a distant view of the main gate Holmes pulled me down and I settled in at his side. We sat there for what felt like hours and I kept glancing upward, tracking the moon’s progress across the sky.
“Ten quid should do it,” Sherlock says in response. John sighs. It’s the last of his cash but he pulls out two five-pound notes and hands them over. As they round the corner Sherlock drops them into a homeless woman’s tin.
Sherlock waved a hand dismissively.
“I don’t have the time now,” he amends. “John’s going to be discharged in three hours and twenty seven minutes, or perhaps two and a half if the idiots who work here can get their act together and obviously he can’t go home alone.”
, Sherlock.”
Lestrade runs a hand through his hair and sighs in defeat, “Well, there’s no point in staying here. May as well see if there are any other leads.”
“No.” She shoves him gently out the door. “Go home to John.”
Queensberry turned back toward him with a shrug.
“Not that one.” Molly says, “The one with the roses.”
John chuckled, “Yeah, well I said ‘no’ when she asked me for gold. What’s the betting she asked Mrs. Hudson for myrrh?”
“John.”
“Exigent circumstances. They have to search the apartment now that I’ve been there, and anything in plain sight is fair game. The case is so simple even an idiot like Dimmock can figure it out with time to spare.”
It wasn’t the first time and John was sure it was far from the last. He recognized the officer at the front desk, Evans, who had been on duty the last 3 times Sherlock had been arrested during court proceedings. Evans barely glanced up when John walked into the precinct, didn’t bother asking why he was there or if he could afford to post bail, just reached for the phone to call for the guard on duty.
“Well, no.”
He remembered little of the next few weeks, just vague sensations of being simultaneously too hot and too cold, flashes of anger, hallucinations and whispered words that he’s not sure were real (
“That’s why we’re going out to dinner,” said John, “give you something else to focus on.”
, not
“Sherlock, do you remember the last date I had?”
“Excellent,” Sherlock says and plucks the remaining doughnut from the box.
John heard the DI’s muffled voice through the phone. Something about a string of robberies in Hampstead. He buried his face in his hands.
As we walked Holmes explained in a whisper that his various contacts reported seeing a man matching Ross’s description coming and going in this area late at night for several weeks.
He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
Kissing Sherlock is a bit like being a teenager again. There’s a bit of awkwardness in the kiss, combined with an overwhelming excitement that John has never felt before. Like the earth could stop spinning and they’d still remain, falling forever into orbit, each drawn into the other’s gravity.
“Sherlock, do you want me to -” he gestured toward the trees.
Sherlock nods, “I’ve been told it’s customary to bring flowers to a patient’s sickbed. Besides, I’ve already missed two days of the experiment. I’m not about to miss another.”
-----
“Come on, John,” he said, and led the way into the night.
He glared at the Marquess and I felt a smile creep across my face in spite of myself.
Note: I have no idea what nursery school/preschool Christmas programs are like in the UK, so I ended up basing the setting loosely on what I remember of my early school years.
“-missed so much during our travels, I hardly know what day it is,” Holmes remarked cheerfully to her as I approached.
“Sorry?”
“Please!” John said, laughing, “You did at least ten illegal things in one night to pull me away from a date.”
But romance? There was that case with the drug smugglers using the influx of roses before Valentine’s Day to import cocaine but Sherlock barely rated the case a 4 and solved it before Lestrade got through half the evidence. Besides, there would be no reason to bring roses home after the case was solved...unless he’s testing for residual drugs. John wonders if he should be watching for ‘danger nights’ but dismisses the thought.
“I’m okay, Sherlock.”
“Clearly not. I don’t know why you’re making such a big deal.”
He doesn’t write about how Sherlock’s eyes dance beneath closed eyelids, searching for an old memory or a place to store a new one. He doesn’t write about the way his lips part slightly, mouthing the names of suspects or poisons. He doesn’t write about the flex of Sherlock’s fingers as he flicks through an almost forgotten file, or the way his left hand twitches as if to shoo away a fly when he’s deleting a bit of information.
“I’m not perfect, John. You of all people know that.”
John shifted slightly and Sherlock could feel the warmth from his hip, barely touching his back.
“I never had someone who would always be there for me before. Someone to bail me out whenever I was in trouble. I didn’t want to lose that.”
Then of course, he had Molly in his life, so perceptive in her own way, always so good at observing the feelings people tried to keep hidden, even from themselves.
John froze. This was exactly why he usually avoided talking about Sherlock on dates - he had a tendency to ramble on and women generally took it the wrong way.
“Seriously? You’ve been looking for this guy and you don’t remember his name?” exclaimed Greg.
When Lestrade arrives Sherlock fills him in on their discovery with the air of a kid telling his parent he’s just won first place in the school science fair and seems a bit taken aback when Lestrade berates him for breaking and entering.
He waited and Sherlock placed both hands in John’s. Even through their gloves he imagined he could feel a bit of warmth.
Sherlock smiled but didn’t answer. He always seemed to gravitate toward this melody when he was thinking about John, to the point that he’d begun to think of it as John’s song. It contained all the things he wanted to say but could never put into words.
“Sorry?” I asked, emerging from the newspaper article that had caught my attention for the past quarter of an hour. It was May of 1895 and it seemed the entire population of London was swept up in the ongoing trials of Oscar Wilde.
“Who goes around stealing wedding rings at Christmas?”
Sherlock began to laugh.
My name is Rosie Watson and I am four years old. I’ve been a very good girl this year.
White Rose meaning: Innocence, eternal love, loyalty.
Queenberry stood, affronted and I rose from my seat as well, prepared to escort him out of the room by force if necessary. He glanced between Holmes and myself with a scowl then turned to me.
“What do you hear?”
John wrinkled his nose. “Fine, you can pick Rosie’s outfit but we’re taking the photos.”
-----
The following day John wakes to a screeching serenade which can only mean one thing: Mycroft Holmes has come to visit.
“But John -”
Sherlock looks at him in surprise and Lestrade explains, “I arrested him five years ago for a series of bank robberies. I heard he was released several months back and told them to keep tabs on him, but as far I heard he’d gone straight. Got a job at a copy center.”
“I thought it would be obvious.” Sherlock says as he reaches out to take one of John’s hands in his own.
There’s no way he could afford the house in the suburbs on his own even if he wanted to stay there, which he doesn’t. Even before everything that had happened with Mary, that place had never truly felt like home and John knows the years he spent there were just marking time. It’s only when he finally settles Rosie in his old room, surrounded by a small menagerie of soft toys that he feels like he’s back where he belongs.
His father never believed him and often voiced the opinion that his son was either going mad or simply pretending in order to get attention. One night during dinner the music began and 7-year old John sat there transfixed. The music was different that night - warm, inviting, so much more real than the family in front of him. The music was so loud that it blocked out the sound of his father yelling at him to “speak when you’re spoken to,” until he felt a large hand across the side of his head and the ringing in his ears drowned out the music.
John sighed in resignation when he saw DI Dimmock step into view instead of Lestrade. At least Sherlock’s message to disappear from the scene made sense now.
“She’s a child, Mycroft. You can’t expect her to fumble with buttons every time she’s going out.”
“It’s when one person does something to hurt another person and that person dies,” she said.
Sherlock continues, “This shop was run by a man named Roger Prescott, known to you as Howard Garrideb. Prescott was one of the best in the mechanical manufacturing business until he allowed his personal life to cloud his judgement.”
“What’s all this?”
“Are you family?” the paramedic asks.
“I’m sorry.”
“Oh no,” John said, grabbing Sherlock’s arm and pulling him toward the other side of the room.
After several minutes, or maybe several hours - it’s impossible to tell which, they break apart, breathless and grinning.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Holmes said, “There’s a youth named Hopkins at Scotland Yard who shows great promise. Also, Inspector Lestrade is a decent, if unimaginative, investigator. I’m sure either one of them would be able to locate some missing keys easily enough, if they have indeed been stolen.”
“What’s the point, then?”
John has a few other things on his mind as he prepares for the holiday party.
An hour later, Sherlock arrived at Hyde Park, Rosie in tow. She was staring up at the giant observation wheel in awe but waved happily at Greg when he joined them.
Sherlock scowls at her as she starts packing up the items on his table as well.
“Of course I meant it. I want everything about you, John.”
He rolled his eyes, “I will not subject Rosie to that.”
“Not what I meant,” Greg muttered but took Rosie’s hand and watched as Sherlock disappeared into the thicket of trees.
John grins at the look of pure want in Sherlock’s eyes and the obvious desire coursing through every fibre of his body. When Sherlock still doesn’t move John reaches out and drags him down into another searing kiss.
“Oh for christ’s sake, Sherlock.”
“Pine,” he said when Greg appeared beside him.
Sherlock waves a hand casually. “I’m getting there. But I do know that the man was a long-time mechanic who had been working as a locksmith for the past year. He lived alone and was recently low on funds which is probably why he took on a large mechanical job shortly before his death. He drank too much but tried to keep up appearances so he could maintain visiting rights with his children from a failed marriage.”
“What?” Sherlock asks, then he drops his gaze to the carpet, “Oh. I thought this is what you wanted. All the signs of sexual arousal were there no matter how hard you tried to hide them.”
“People might talk,” he joked.
Before he could ask, Sherlock’s phone chimed with an incoming text and he nodded at John to pick it up. It was from Greg.
He rose and turned to his collection of commonplace books and pulled out the volume containing the letter ‘T’.
When they arrive at an abandoned parking garage, Lestrade’s team has already done their initial sweep of the scene but Sherlock insists on having John examine the bodies. Lestrade sighs but allows John to confirm that the pair had most likely died of carbon monoxide inhalation from the sealed car they’d been found in.
Molly thought about it for a minute then replied,
Rosie had been twirling around the living room in a red tutu, which had prompted Sherlock’s mum to dig up a video of 16-year old Sherlock as the Nutcracker prince, despite the fully-grown Sherlock’s protests. Rosie had been fascinated and spent the rest of the evening watching the video on repeat until she drifted off to sleep in the Land of the Sweets on the third time through.
-----
He shook his head, “More like, of all the time wasted.”
John usually took about 45 minutes to get ready for a night out, but he’d been in such a rush that he hadn’t even bothered to check the flat for new experiments (and fresh damage) like he normally did when Sherlock was left alone without a case for too long. That meant he had maybe half that amount of time before he had to leave.
“It is now,” John says, tapping Sherlock’s arm lightly with the flower, “You’ve made me rather an expert in rose symbolism, you know.”
Just as he opened his mouth to speak, they heard the front door open, followed by muffled voices and a pair footsteps on the landing. A moment later, Molly entered with a large package overflowing with gifts, followed closely by Greg, who was carrying a smaller bag and a case of beer.
“Didn’t you say you needed help finding a gift for Rosie?”
John had looked up from fixing his tie and glanced at Sherlock in the mirror. He had been getting ready for his date with Jennifer...or was it Nicole? He couldn’t remember anymore. He’d never admit it aloud but his many dates from that time all sort of blended together in hindsight.
“But you see us every day,” said Sherlock.
Instead of leaving Sherlock parks himself on a chair and fiddles with his phone. John is too tired to argue so he flops down next to him and folds his arms on the table as a makeshift pillow but he’s unable to fall asleep. At the sound of a text alert he looks up to see a grin spreading across Sherlock’s face.
Why are you people so interested in my experiments all of a sudden? It’s not like you cared about the tobacco ash or blood coagulation. Didn’t anyone notice that I solved a double murder AND counterfeit case all in one go?
Sherlock sighed and took a sip from his glass to avoid speaking. He was tired of having this same conversation over and over again. Of course John cared about him. He was his best friend. They lived together. They were raising Rosie together. John had said it himself: Sherlock was one of the people he loved and cared about most in the world. But hearing the words from Molly just reminded him that the way John loved him was only a faint shadow of the love he desired.
“Holmes!” I shouted, for my companion had dropped to his knees beside me. He rose immediately though and I heard a faint clatter as he adjusted his coat.
John feels the heat rising in his cheeks. “I - we’re -” he doesn’t really know what he plans to say but is saved the trouble when the door opens, revealing Sherlock holding a pink rose, and Lestrade, who looks moderately well-rested and happier than John has seen him in quite a while.
The card inside had two photos surrounding a simple holiday greeting. The top image showed Rosie twirling in the center of the living room, the new maroon dress Sherlock had bought for the occasion flaring out around her.
His limp disappeared as he began to walk faster, chasing the music as if it would vanish if he fell behind. He barely noticed the street names as he rushed past, following the music as it led him through back alleys and over fences.
Sherlock stared into the flickering flame between them.
Mycroft returns his gaze to Sherlock who continues to glare at him, “Don’t worry, brother mine. I’m sure he’ll solve it soon.”
I pulled my gaze away from the colourful scene in front of me.
16 December 21:32
“I want that too, Sherlock,” he whispered against his lips, “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.”
“It’s extraordinary!” he exclaimed as we passed a young man who was talking into what we had concluded was a sort of portable telephone, “We must have jumped forward at least a century!”
“Thank you.” She says. After a brief pause she adds, “You deserve that too, you know. Being happy.”
“No, I want one of your stories.”
“So, what happened?”
Still, every time a soft breeze ruffled his hair John listened hopefully for the swell of sound and emotion. When the gusts did no more than send the autumn leaves swirling, John hung his head and whispered to whoever might be listening,
When midnight approaches this time, Lestrade insists that they leave to get some sleep and a bit of distance from the case. Sherlock allows him to give them a lift to Baker Street after making him promise to call immediately if any other evidence comes to light. John barely manages to stay awake for a quick shower before collapsing onto the couch, too tired to make it upstairs.
There was a pause during which his eyes flicked upward at John who was looking at his wallet, wondering how much bailing Sherlock out of jail would cost this time.
John chuckles and steals a glance at Sherlock. Instead of returning the smile, Sherlock turns to Dr. Montgomery.
Official police stakeouts, John realizes, are not as interesting as Sherlock’s usual brand of suspect surveillance. As night falls over London they sit in Lestrade’s car, keeping watch over the streets around the warehouse, which is barely visible in the distance. It makes sense - a car parked any closer in this area would certainly draw suspicion but the lack of immediacy makes John relax into a half sleep.
“No, it’s just a doll.”
“Did you mean it?”
Sherlock rises, crosses the room and exchanges his dressing gown for his coat.
“She didn’t see it.” Sherlock looked up at John, eyes full of worry.
The church behind Rosie’s nursery school was covered with a thin sprinkling of snow, making it look like something out of a Christmas card. Rosie herself was dressed up in her costume - a floor-length burgundy robe with a gold sash and a headpiece adorned with plastic jewels.
John flipped through them and frowned.
“It’s a floribunda rose rosa,” Sherlock says in answer to John’s unasked question.
