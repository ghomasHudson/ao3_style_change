"Hello, Ruby." The torturer greeted, voice drawling in a way that made Ruby shudder.
Sam shoved him off as Dean picked up the blade. “Sam,” Dean warned. “It’s me, I’m alive!” Dean protested.
Before the demon could continue, the front door rattled and burst open, revealing Castiel and Uriel.
“I think Anna's getting more interesting by the second.” Dean commented and hissed when Sam palpitated his bruised cheekbone to check for any breaks.
Sam slung the duffel over his shoulder and closed the trunk before turning around. Ruby stood there, brunette meatsuit and her black leather jacket, crossed arms and a smirk on her lips. Sam had forgotten that he had texted her the address of the motel he was staying at.
Dean watched as Castiel leaned down and pressed two fingers against Dean's body’s forehead. The decay process reverted, making it look fresh and alive. The small cuts on his face healed and disappeared, as did the huge claw marks on Dean's chest. Dean knew all internal stuff was healed too, like his alcoholized liver and the remains of his heart attack.
Dean chuckled and rolled his eyes. “Yeah, since when do we get coincidences.” He remarked as the Impala arrived outside the Milton residence.
In celebration of Pride month, I decided to add the scene where Dean comes out and Sam is exactly like me whenever any of my friends or family members comes out.
“I'm hearing a few whispers.” Ruby responded, but couldn’t continue before Dean interrupted her.
Dean scoffed and turned his head to stare out of the window. “I already have talked about it, remember? Or have you forgotten the night on the balcony?” Dean responded with a huff.
Balthazar took a shaky breath. “Dean Winchester? Jensen is possessing Dean Winchester?” He asked.
Dean looked at the angel, at where he believed it’s eyes were. “Take me to Sam.” He pleaded. Demon or not, Dean cared about his younger brother, his family.
Felt like I needed to post something shorter after posting 2 longer chapters back-to-back, so here it is!
Dean blearily opened his eyes and looked back up. He knew what Sam was talking about: the angelic handprint on his left arm. Brands left by angels after they’ve grasped a soul and used grace on it. The brands are sensitive and can be felt in the soul if touched.
Alastair shrugged, and flashed a smile. "I think I'll take my chances."
Being an angel really puts the world into perspective, the beauty and innocence of it.
“Anna, you’re safe!” Missouri quickly tried to reassure Anna, but failed.
“Dean’s actually right. We need a break, Sam.” Bobby said and looked at the hunched over figure of the youngest Winchester. “We could all use some sleep and we also need to stretch our legs.”
Dean quickly got defensive over his friend. “Hey, you couldn’t possibly have known. So I don’t want you to blame yourselves; and if I hear any of you lay the blame on yourselves, I won’t hesitate to fight you.” He joked and felt pride swell in his chest when they all chuckled or laughed.
Sam smirked tauntingly. "Oh, it looks like it's over in my eyes. Douchebag." He spoke with a confident voice.
“Dork.” Castiel retaliated and raised his head to look into the ex-archangel’s green eyes.
“We were kind of from the same foxhole.” Anna answered with a small shrug.
Sam released a silent breath of relief and picked Dean up by his armpits. He slung Dean’s arm around his shoulder and curled his own around Dean’s waist, before hoisting both himself and Dean up.
"Sam. Cas and Uriel paid me a visit and I have some information that could help. Where you at?" Dean hurriedly spoke.
Sam immediately knew who she was then. “Ruby?” He asked, his voice unnecessarily loud.
Dean felt himself paling. “What?” He questioned.
Tessa quickly nodded. “Yeah. And let me tell you, you were the most annoying soul I’ve ever reaped, you were dead-set on getting back to Sam and John.” She spoke with a smile. Though her smile quickly faded. “You reacted just like an angel of family would’ve.”
“We still have the hex bags.” Sam said while he paced and looked between the demon and the former angel. “I say we go back to the panic room.”
“I just have some info, then I’m gone.” Ruby answered with a slight growl.
Alastair abruptly turned around and went over to Dean. Dean was finished with the soul, the soul was broken, had said yes to getting off the rack. The righteous man looked up at his master with a blood splattered face when he came close, proud at how quickly he had made the soul break. Alastair couldn’t help but smile. His student was very promising.
“No!” Anna screamed as lights exploded and glass chattered, raining pieces of glass down on them. Sam and Dean jumped away from the shards of glass, avoiding getting cut by them, while Missouri stayed and continued her hypnosis.
’ and ‘
“This is Uriel, he’s what you might call a… specialist.” Castiel introduced the other angel to Sam and Dean. Or mostly Sam.
“Huh.” Sam hummed and looked into the ground as if it held the answers of the Universe.
Upstairs in Sam and Dean’s shared room, Sam was frantically texting Ruby for a place to meet. Away from the books and distraction of reading, Sam felt the early symptoms of withdrawal. His hands were trembling sightly, not really noticeable, but still there. Ruby responded with an address and Sam took a quick shower before he sneaked out through the back door.
Sam and Missouri looked scared at the announcement while Dean sighed heavily -- having already known who he was, he knew Anna had to be handed over to the angels.
Dean slapped Sam’s hand away and rubbed his eyes, but Sam wasn’t letting it go. “Dean, what’s wrong?” Sam asked carefully as he put on a black t-shirt and closed the open door to the room.
Sam stood straight and looked at Anna with a guilty and hesitant expression, Dean mirroring his expression. “Uh…” Was all Sam could get out.
“Go now.” She commanded the brothers in a strong voice. “Go through the bathroom window, don't stop, don't take your car, don't pass go. There are demons in the hallway and in the parking lot.”
Sam shifted uncomfortably as Dean and the angel stared at each other. If Sam didn’t know any better, he would’ve thought they were trying to undress each other with their eyes. He saw as Dean’s tense body relaxed slightly and a hint of a smile played at his lips.
Samandriel quickly stood. "I've only had 6 beers. Both Ariel and Balthazar has had over 20." He spoke eagerly.
Danielle nodded, but looked disappointed. As if she wanted Dean to ask for her phone number. Dean wouldn't lie; if he hadn't been in a relationship already, he probably would have asked for her number. Danielle turned around and walked to the kitchen with her hips swaying.
Little angel comes from an A/B/O fanfic I read where Dean (omega) called Castiel (alpha) little alpha and I thought it was adorable.
Dean remained silent, staring at the ceiling and avoided looking at Sam. It was a wordless confirmation.
Dean turned around in his seat and saw a blonde man with grey-blue eyes, dressed in a grey v-neck shirt, a black blazer and a pair of tight black jeans.
Castiel smiled against the older angel’s shoulder. “I am happy. I’m overjoyed. But I’m scared. What if things are different? What if he’s different?” He asked, hoping to being able to confide with his brother with his inner thoughts.
“Yeah.” Sam replied with a smile and dove into research mode. “In ‘85 there was an empty field outside of town. Six months later, there was a full grown oak. They say it looks a century old. At least.”
“Yes.” He answered and turned to go back to Sam and Ruby. Anna quickly followed closely behind him on quiet feet.
“And your father… what’s his name?” The psychic continued and looked the red-head up and down to see any physical reactions from her.
Dean smiled sadly and traced Castiel’s face with his fingertips. He leaned down at fitted his lips together with Castiel’s again and let himself relaxed against Castiel’s firm body.
As Dean sat down in an unoccupied booth and waited to order while he looked at the menu, Castiel's grace wrapped itself more firmly around him.
With a heavy sigh, Dean rested his head on Castiel’s chest and closed his eyes. “Night, Cas.” Dean whispered but received no response. Opening his eyes, Dean saw that Castiel was already asleep. With a quiet chuckle, Dean closed his eyes again and felt himself slip into the heavenly cloud of sleep.
"No?" Alastair questioned and prepared himself to bring down the blade for another cut, but Ruby stopped him.
“I think Balthazar and Ariel has influenced me a little too much.” Castiel answered in the same joking tone.
“Cas!” Dean scolded as a blush covered his freckled cheeks. Of all the ways Castiel could have said it, he had to use the innuendo.
Noticing the scared looks, Anna was quick to reassure them. “Don’t be afraid. I’m not like the others.” She told them.
Later, Anna was in Bobby’s panic room while Dean made sure she would stay down there where she was the safest. “Iron walls drenched in salt. Demons can’t even touch the joint.” He explained to the young woman sitting on the uncomfortable bed, watching him.
Castiel looked between Sam and Dean to Uriel, sending a quick apologetic look to Dean. “You, uh, both of you, you need to leave this town immediately.” He commanded nervously.
Dean was about to respond with a comment of how he was compared to Sam's booty call, but was interrupted by a knock on the door.
The angel spread it’s wings, two big black appendages, and held out a silver knife. “Dean
“Why don’t you ask me to my face?” Anna’s voice interrupted any further questions.
“Hey, don’t give me the ‘thanks for trying’ speech. As Dean would say, participation trophies suck.” He joked and Anna chuckled.
Dean quickly nodded, in slight shock from the memories still assaulting his senses. “Yeah, it’s me.”
Dean thought for a second.
Dean sat down on the arm of the couch with a small chuckle, eyeing the towel and wet stain on the cushion, before answering. “No. Cas is in a vessel. Angels have to possess humans so that they can interact with us humans. If a human saw an angel in it’s true form, our eyes would burn out and the true voice of an angel is enough to make you deaf.”
Dean glared angrily at Sam and sat up completely in the motel bed. “Actually, Castiel. Why don’t you explain the effects of drinking demon blood.” Dean suggested, never taking his eyes off Sam.
“I will drag you outta here myself.” Uriel threatened in a low voice, an angry frown covering his face.
Dean sighed heavily. “No.” He answered and saw all their faces fall. “But at the same time, yes.” Their eyes lit  up again. “I miss being an angel, having a connection to Cas, not having to eat or sleep, having to go to the bathroom. But… I don’t miss the phantom pain from my broken wings, I don’t miss being forced to give up my free will, I don’t miss having people tell me what to do or think.” He explained.
Sam had the nerve to look innocent as Dean took strong steps towards him, aware of the presence of the demon, Ruby, who glared at him. If her eyes were lasers, Dean would have a hole straight through his head.
Sam sat down in the booth closest to the entrance/exit, and looked through the menu. He sat there for a minute before becoming aware of presence behind him.
, remained unsaid.
“You know how.” Ruby firmly responded, seeing through his stalling. “You know what you got to do.”
"That they are." Alastair agreed. "Why did you reveal yourself? Aren't you supposed to keep up your little charade as 'the good little demon'?" He raised an eyebrow.
“Well, that -- that's just batty.” Dean commented and turned another page in the sketchbook, finding amazing and graphic sketches, writing saying ‘
Sam nodded numbly, partly in shock from the revelation. “I promise.” He whispered.
Sorry for the slow updates, but I have a lot going on in my personal life:
Alastair's face darkened and his eyes flicked to white as he held his arm out and an invisible force wrapped around Ruby's throat. "You're choosing the coward's way out? Too afraid of the fluffy-winged douchebags?" The torturer chuckled. "And to top it off, you actually have feelings for the boy-king. You're a disgrace to the demons."
They came up in a huge grassy field, a simple wooden cross marking Dean’s grave. Dean looked around, seeing trees surrounding the field. Dean looked down at his grave, at the newly turned dirt his body rested underneath, that wasn’t burnt based on the tugging motion he felt at being this close to it and the thought of entering his body while his chest was still ripped open and his body decaying made Dean shudder, and as if Castiel had heard his thought he asked, “Shall I heal your body before I place your soul in it?”
When Sam turned around, Dean was dressed and presentable. Sam took a moment to take in the look of his older brother; the spiked and wet dark blonde hair and fierce green eyes, the fair skin and sharp edges of his face. The full lips, the long eyelashes, the pierced right ear (a bad decision from his teens), the short shadow of a stubble on his chin.
“Why didn’t I know of this?” Balthazar asked her with a proud smile, as he took note of Dean turning his head away and biting his lip.
The demon stepped in front of Dean, using his body to block the angel’s way to Dean. “Get the Hell out of Hell! Dean is not yours to take!” Alastair roared, the sound reverberating around in Hell.
“Pain.” Sam spoke.
Dean looked around the semi-busy street and nodded. “I’ll be alright.” He answered and returned his gaze to Castiel. “Sam’s motel is just around the corner. I’ll make it there without any fuss. But I expect you to contact me every evening until we see each other again.” Dean demanded.
Ruby looked at them in angry disbelief. “You're kidding.” She hissed angrily. “Great. Just peachy. Impeccable timing, guys, really.”
Sam frowned at him. “Why Michael? Isn’t he supposed to be the good guy?”
“That’s another question.” Sam stated. “Why would you want to fall? Why would you like to be one of us?” He asked, confused as to what was so attractive about humanity.
The following 8 hours were spent at the bar, catching up on the last 30 years. Balthazar had been stationed in Hell for 5 years to scope out the demons and try to get any intel on any plans they might have, Ariel had taken over the job of fixing and guarding Heaven’s weapons. Castiel had been taking care of his garrison after Anna was sentenced to Heaven’s prison.
Castiel released him enough so that Dean could pulled back and when he did, Castiel glared at him without any real heat behind it. “Don’t you dare mention your surrogate father while we are in bed together.” Castiel scolded.
Anna looked up at him with a small, curious smile. “Hi.” She responded.
Sam remained standing outside, frozen in place before he shook himself and climbed into the driver’s seat, glancing over to the passenger side and saw Dean sitting with crossed arms and glared at the dashboard in front of him.
“Okay.” Anna quaked quietly in response, standing completely still as Sam closed the door to the closet.
Silence spread in the motel room, Dean waiting for Sam’s reaction and Sam having been stopped short by Dean’s outrage.
“Look, it’s a start.” Sam replied in a positive voice. He smiled up at the demon, though it felt forced. Ever since he found out what Ruby’s blood did to him, he’s been uncomfortable in the company of the demon, especially when he was alone with her.
Sam frowned after being called out by his brother and lowered his head to look at the floor. “Sorry.” He whispered in response.
"Wouldn't try that if I were you. See, she got her grace back. Full-blown angel now." Dean easily lied with a smirk.
Dean took the sketchbook from Sam’s hands and flipped through a few pages. “Interesting.” He muttered.
WHY IS THIS EPISODE SO LONG?!?! THREE CHAPTERS! I WANT THIS TO BE OVER! AND ALL THE CUTSCENES! WHY?!?!?!?!?
Dean went rigid in Castiel’s lap, breath stuttering. “They, they…” Dean stuttered, on the edge of panic. “Sam has to give Anna to the angels! I-I can’t…” Dean released a high-pitched whine as he began to cry in panic, and started hyperventilating.
“We’ve all done things we got to pay for.” Sam responded with a small sigh, thinking of all the choices he had blown up in his face.
It was Castiel. In a vessel.
Dean firmly shook his head. “She’s been corrupting you. That’s what demon blood does to you. It will change everything about you. You will go from Sam Winchester, the hunter, to… Sam Winchester, the damaged. The monster. The boy king of Hell.” Dean choked out.
Dean took a deep breath and closed his eyes. “It was an angel.”
Sam nodded. “Yeah, I have your duffel in the Impala.”
Dean opened his mouth to point something else out, but stopped when he heard the fight from up above come closer. He looked up and saw several bright lights fading out, but also black smoke burning away. Dean turned his head back to look at Castiel --
“I can hear you.” Anna’s voice responded in an emotionless, trance-like voice.
Dean shifted on his feet and crossed his arms over his chest as he glared. “What is it?” Sam quickly asked, trying to move things along as to not let his brother and the demon get into a fight.
. “I know what brought me back. And I know how it did it.”
Dean skipped the car outside the gas station and instead he walked down the long stretch of road, all the while feeling grace around him, like a cool yet warm blanket. But Dean knew Castiel could attack if Dean was threatened in the slightest.
“And it was in that moment I realized I wanted to be by your side forever, either as a friend or as a lover, it didn’t matter as long as I was with you.” Castiel finished by pressing his lips to Dean’s temple.
The younger Winchester shook his head, shocked at the change in topic. “Yeah.” Sam smiled weakly. “While saving your ass.” He joked and Dean smiled in response.
Feigning innocence, Dean shrugged and rubbed the brand, shuddering at the tingling it left behind. “Dunno. Maybe it’s from whatever pulled my ass out of Hell?” Dean suggested. ‘
“But even if we have the archangel blade, we need an archangel to kill him.” Dean reminded him, being the pessimist in their conversation. Like always.
Sam took a deep but sharp breath. “So the Apocalypse is going to happen?” He asked, voice shaking slightly.
My mom died about a month ago and yesterday would have been her 54th birthday. Due to her death being very sudden, I never had a chance to say goodbye (not a real one anyways) and I can't let that go.
“What’d the message say?” Dean softly asked, only to have the devastated looks pinned to him. “It’s about me, isn’t it?”
"Turn around and walk away. Now." Castiel growled, unconsciously spreading his wings for Dean's protection.
With those words, Dean and Castiel left the diner with a shocked Danielle behind them. On the street, Dean made sure to kiss the angel passionately in clear view of the window.
“How ironic.” Dean muttered, before closing the book and placing it on the couch cushion next to him. With a heavy sigh, Dean took a drink from his beer and glared at the book. He already had anxiety and panic over the seals and the Apocalypse, so reading about the ‘sword of Michael’ didn’t help at all. “Stupid older brothers, always fighting over something. Hell, I don’t even know why they’re fighting to begin with.” He angrily grumbled.
Sam, however, quickly threw his arm out and caught her upper arm in his grip. “Wait, wait, wait. This hospital Anna escaped from -- it got a name?” He asked.
supposed to have a role in the Apocalypse, but what he didn't know.
!!!!!ATTENTION!!!!! As Supernatural has been announced to end next year with season 15, progress on this book might be slower (or quicker) as I'm pretty depressed that the show is ending. I will try and finish the book even though the show is ending and hopefully I will. I don't know if I'm gonna watch the show after it ends, so I can't really promise anything.
As Sam and Dean’s conversations steered away from angels and Hell, one thought kept repeating in Dean’s head:
Castiel sighed and glared at the other angel. "You know he can't. The Righteous Man starts AND ends the Apocalypse. If Dean becomes unavailable, we will surely lose."
Uriel butted into the conversation. “One thousand, two hundred and fourteen.” He added.
“Sam left Bobby?” Dean asked, uncertain if he missed some information.
The moment Dean returned to consciousness, he knew he had used up all the grace Castiel had given him when his body felt weak and aching. “Fuck.” Dean cursed before he broke out into a harsher cough. When Dean lowered his arm as the coughing ended, specks of blood colored his lips. He brushed his fingers over his lips, pulling them back to look at the blood, rubbing it over his fingers as if he was examining it. “Crap.” Dean cursed again, this time more like a whimper.
Anna looked at him with shocked hazel eyes. There had been rumors in Heaven that Castiel had been engaged to the youngest archangel for several hundred years. Even if Jensen was missing and presumed dead, it was still rumored that Castiel still loved him and wore his own engagement ring. Her mind flickered to the silver ring she had seen around Dean’s left ring finger and let out a soft gasp in realization. Jensen wasn’t only alive and well -- or as well as an angel could be without its wings -- but was also occupying Michael’s vessel.
Ruby hesitated before she replied, "I have the angel. You take her and leave Sam and Dean alone. Use her to kill Lilith and... I can stop lying to Sam."
Castiel sadly shook his head. “We’re out of time. This witch has to die, the seal must be saved.”
Uriel took a step forward. “This isn’t the first time I’ve…” Uriel paused to find an appropriate wording. “… Purified a city.” He settled on.
Dean asked. Once again, Castiel's grace grew warm in response.
“Nothing. Just listening.” She responded with a small shrug.
Sam ignored the last part for the moment, trying to
Sam paused in the doorway before joining his brother by the railing. He spared a quick glance at the older of the two before he looked back out at the street. “Are the angels speaking to you?” He asked, his voice still awed yet hesitant as he spoke of the angels.
“Sorry.” Anna apologized when she realized she had hurt the hunter’s feelings.
. If used long enough, the soul itself will be burnt away, leaving a human with no moral compass to tell them what’s right and wrong. Ultimately, it could lead to a type of mix between a human and a demon, but not a cambion. Instead, an unstable, dark force that should be killed long before it’s created.”
“The Apocalypse? Like in the Bible?” Julia asked with her eyebrows raised high in a mix of question and shock.
The gruff hunter looked over at Dean who was laid back down in the bed with a big yawn and a heavy sigh. “Dean?” Bobby’s gruff voice questioned.
“Hey.” Dean greeted his fiancé and held his hand out to drag the blue-eyed angel down next to him.
Sam's eyebrows furrowed in question. “You want to kill her? Why?” He harshly asked.
The red-haired woman sighed and looked down at the ground. “I don’t know. Maybe I don’t deserve to be saved.” She spoke with a small, sad shrug.
“What are you doing here?” Sam questioned Bobby as the older hunter sat down across from him.
Sam continued his story, of his argument with Ruby and his attempt at killing Lilith, who was nowhere near where his 'attack’ took place.
Dean smiled. “Cause I would've felt at peace. Calm. Relaxed.
Sam ignored her as he went outside to where Anna was sitting on the hood of an old truck. “Hey.” He greeted the red-head in a soft voice.
Sam went stiff as he held his shorter older brother to his chest. “You broke the first seal? You’re the righteous man?” He asked softly.
Ruby rolled her eyes and winced as Sam pulled him up. "Not so much." She hissed and held a hand to a cut in her stomach.
Sam couldn’t help the small smile at the description, he was almost glad he didn’t have angelic powers and instead was cursed with demon blood in his veins. He looked down at his hands which were shaking from the loss of the adrenaline he had gained from the confrontation with Dean, he had been so scared of Dean finding out about the demon blood, afraid of Dean’s judgement, of Dean calling him a monster, a freak.
Balthazar grinned and Dean felt his breath momentarily leave his lungs. Dean wasn’t sure if he should hug him or nor not, and instead sat on the chair and stared at Balthazar dumbly. Instead Balthazar made the first move. He lunged himself into Dean’s arms and squeezed the ex-archangel tightly. Dean’s arms tentatively came up and hugged the blond angel back.
Sam seemed to consider Dean’s suggestion. A realization struck him. “You never asked if it was me.” Sam stated.
Anna shrugged and answered, “Lost track of it. I was falling about 10, 000 miles per hour at the time.”
A beat of silence passed before Dean looked at Ruby who was standing behind the red-head. “Nice job watching her.” He snarked to the demon.
“Pardon me.” Castiel apologized. “Dean prayed to me and I believed my presence was wanted. I didn’t mean to interrupt.”
Ariel shrugged and simply replied, “It never came up.”
Castiel placed his fingers on Sam’s forehead,
“You.” Dean whispered. “Dad. Bobby. Ellen and Jo. Now, I guess it’s Cas…” Dean continued, but dropped off at his fiancé’s name. With a sigh, he sent a prayer of longing to Castiel, hoping he would understand that Dean wanted him there at that moment.
Castiel’s smile dropped as he turned his head and glared at Dean.
Danielle left, and Dean grabbed the phone and went into the text messages, learning from his mistake at the payphone. He typed in Bobby's number and within a minute, his text was sent.
“Hello.” Castiel greeted Dean, the reaper and the angels, smiling at them all. He settled onto the couch, pulling Dean closer so the ex-archangel leaned against him.
Missouri remained calm even while the glass rained down on her. “Calm down.” She softly urged the red-head.
Dean groaned and rolled off of Castiel’s body, and by doing so, the bed as well. A louder groan escaped Dean as he laid on the carpet covered floor. “What times s’it?” Dean grumbled as he heaved himself up from the floor with the help of the bed.
Sam blinked back from the shock and took a sharp intake of air. “Angels?” He questioned, eyes wide and eyebrows raised in question.
It felt like Dean had just closed his eyes after being awoken by the latest nightmare when he opened them again, the door creaking open having awoken him. He closed his eyes again and buried himself deeper under the covers with a groan, thinking it was only Sam. Though he quickly looked up when he heard a gun being cocked.
The clashing of blades stopped and Dean heard a body falling to the ground. Dean turned his head and saw Alastair’s unconscious body lying just a few feet away from him.
Sam wanted to stop. He really did. After finding out what the demon blood did to you, he tried to quit, but as soon as the effects of withdrawal set in, he gave in. He called Ruby on a burner phone, away from the motel they were staying at in the pretence of interviewing a witness.
Dean raised an eyebrow in response to Uriel's statement. "You just said she was getting her grace back once she was in your possession."
Dean brushed past Sam as he exited the bathroom. He shivered at the air coming from outside the balcony, the cold water from the shower and the semi-warm evening air was a weird contrast. Rummaging through his duffle, Dean pulled out a grey henley shirt, dark blue jeans, some socks and his hunting boots, along with a pair of soft boxers.
Dean turned around to see what had shocked Sam, and saw the blue eyes and black hair of Castiel in Jimmy Novak’s body. He hadn’t even heard the flutter of wings as Castiel arrived.
“Samandriel is just as sweet and adorable as he was before you left.” Balthazar beamed, making Dean smile back.
Dean huffed loudly. “You gonna say, ‘let me explain’? You're gonna explain
Castiel smiled and looked down at the floor. He studied the wooden floorboards as he let his brother’s reassurances wash over him.
(3541 words)
Sam’s breathing hitched; just as he thought he was able to get away, Dean caught him. “How?” Sam asked, feeling the fear come back.
Bobby remained silent but his wary pose relaxed slightly at the knowledge of the stranger not being a threat. That knowledge, however, didn’t explain Dean and the angel’s closeness. “What’s going on here?” Bobby finally asked after the silence stretched out for an uncomfortable amount of time.
and made the younger Winchester fall to the floor, unconscious.
Ariel stood still and stared into Castiel’s eyes for a second before she smiled. “That handsome young man you were with in the diner, that’s Jay?” She asked.
“Yeah, they want her. They're not screwing around.” Dean continued after Sam. He looked around the room. “All right, so, I'm ‘Girl, Interrupted,’ I know the score of the apocalypse, just busted out of the nut-box... Possibly using superpowers, by the way. Where do I go?” He questioned.
As Dean hummed the last verse, both he and Castiel stopped moving in favor of just standing with their arms around each other. The angel turned his head up so that he could kiss the hunter, bringing his hand up to cradle Dean’s cheek. The hunter kissed back fiercely, wordlessly showing the angel how much he loved him. Soon, it became a battle of tongues as neither Dean or Castiel could let go of each other.
Anna quickly shook her head in disbelief as she realized the meaning behind the words. “No, no, they're not…” She stuttered and denied.
Ruby quickly shook her head. “Not this time.” She solemnly said. “You do not want to get between these two armies. It’s Godzilla and Mothra. If one side doesn’t get us, the other will.”
Sam stopped and looked at his brother in the eyes with stern ones of his own. “I'm not talking about Anna. I'm talking about the fact that your boyfriend tried to attack us and kill the woman we're trying to protect.” Sam explained.
Anna shook her head as she came back to the real world. “Sorry.” She apologized.
Dean felt emotion building up behind his sternum, anger and sorrow, growing stronger and stronger as the argument went on. He clenched his fists to his sides as the emotion became pressure and the pressure became power, traveling along his arms and waited to be released. “I’ve watched it happen myself! I’ve seen the effects of demon blood corruption with my own eyes, and believe me, it makes plague victims look like fairytale princesses!” Dean fumed.
“Are they- are they gone?” Anna quietly asked, making Dean's eyes turn to her.
Dean shook his head, despite knowing about the orders of angels. “Of course you have a choice. I mean, come on, what? You never questioned a crap order, huh? What are you both, just a couple of hammers?” Dean asked, echoing an argument, the first and only, between Dean and Castiel from several years ago, in the 1660s.
I don't know what to do with this fic. I've lost all will to write this (or at least this version) and is currently writing because I feel like I
“Well, Anna's father was a church deacon. When she became ill, her paranoia took on religious overtones. She was convinced the devil was about to rise up and end the world. I hope you find her. It's dangerous for her to be out there alone right now.” Julia urgently said.
Ruby smirked in response. I
“It’s not your fault.” A gravelly voice joined in. Dean smiled before he looked up and saw his fiancé standing behind Ariel and Balthazar, his trench coat folded over his arm. “You really need to stop blaming yourself for something that isn’t your fault.”
Constructive criticism is appreciated!
Dean suppressed a smile at his fiancé's declaration; angels didn't have what humans typically would call a ‘heart’, but they did have a muscle in their chests which pumped their graves around in their true forms.
“So, they lock you up with a case of the crazies when really you were just... tuning in to angel radio?” Dean questioned, gazing into Anna’s hazel eyes.
Dean smiled sadly. “Sorry. I just needed to get some air.” Dean apologized. He understood Sam; he had been jumpy as well after he sold his soul for Sam, always afraid it was a dream and Sam was still dead.
Dean continued to explain the 66 seals as vaguely as he could, as to not get Bobby and Sam suspicious. It was hard, one word too much here, a wrong movement there and the secret would have been out.
, of all demons?” Dean asked with his arms firmly crossed over his chest.
“I found Jensen. He’s alive and well. Or as well as a person trapped in Hell for 40 years could be.” Castiel stated and watched as horrified understanding filled Balthazar’s eyes.
“And you’re an innocent in this?” Sam questioned loudly, eyes hardening. Dean stopped and looked at Sam in confusion. Sam took a deep breath. “I know you and Castiel are sleeping together.” Sam confessed in a slightly calmer tone.
Dean nodded solemnly. “It also means I will lose everyone I’ve ever loved and cared about if the Apocalypse happens. It’s the curse of the Winchesters.” Dean added, knowing full well about the painful prophecy ahead.
“Huh?” Sam grunted in question before he realized what she was asking. “Uh, yeah, I think so.” He answered and rose to his feet, Anna copying his movements.
The angel turned to look at Dean and the human had to look away from the bright light burning his eyes. “Dean, Sam needs you. Lucifer is going to rise and your brother needs your help to stop the Devil.”
Anna’s eyes lost their focus as she focused on the angel communication in her head. “It’s quiet.” She answered as her eyes came back to reality. “Dead silence.”
Dean avoided looking at Sam and instead looked around the room. Just like the exterior, it looked fancier than their usual places. A king sized bed covered in black silk sheets. A red loveseat-like couch stood a few feet from the bed, facing towards it. A table and a few chairs of dark wood stood in one corner of the room and a dresser stood by the foot of the bed, a big TV on top. There was a door leading out to a balcony facing the street below.
Dean felt fear seize his body, he had hoped this moment would come sometime later, when everything wasn't so hectic. “How do you know that?” He asked, staring at Sam with wide eyes.
While the demon tried to pull the knife out of his shoulder, making sparks glow from the wound, Sam got back to his feet and took hold of Dean’s arm, tugging on his brother’s jacket sleeve. Once Dean started moving, mainly because Sam started moving him, the brothers ran towards the stained glass-window, taking off into a run towards the window before throwing themselves through the glass and falling to the ground beneath.
Sam and Dean followed the directions of the note and found themselves in a small cabin half an hour later. On their walk to the cabin, Dean had let Sam navigate their way forward while he looked around at the scenery. He might not have been able to hear a spider spin it's web from several feet away, but nature was still beautiful. Dean's gaze had mostly been stuck upwards, watching the stars and the moon.
Dean slowly nodded. “Yeah. Is there a phone I could borrow? I promised my uncle to send him a text to tell him I've arrived and where we should meet up.” Dean lied easily.
The door cracked open and Balthazar stuck his head out. His blonde hair was disheveled and from where Castiel stood he could see that the blonde angel was shirtless.
I REWROTE THIS F*CKING CHAPTER 5 TIMES, I'M NOT KIDDING. I HATE IT SO MUCH. (Literally wrote a chapter of almost 5,000 words focusing only on 'It's the great pumpkin, Sam Winchester' as I believed that episode to be the one where Dean found out about Sam's powers).
“Yes he’s possessing someone.” Dean answered, but was quick to continue. “But for an angel to possess someone, they gotta have consent. The man Cas is possessing, Jimmy Novak, agreed to being a vessel.”
Sam was speechless on the other end of the line before he spoke, "We're in Kentucky. A barn in Union. I'll text you the more exact location... what did Cas and Uriel say?"
Freddie= Freddie Mercury, a British Singer and songwriter, lead singer in the band Queen
“What’s wrong?” Dean and Tessa asked at the same time, wondering why the angels all looked like someone had kicked their puppies.
Soft footsteps padded on the floorboards above them, causing Castiel to look up. They were soft, barely audible. A hunter and soldier’s footsteps. But Castiel could still pick them out easily, having spent most of his existence as a soldier himself.
Dean looked around the large field, trying to find any sign of human life, but finding none. “Uh, where are we?” Dean asked.
Dean checked the time; 1:22pm. Bobby wouldn't arrive until 8 in the evening, maybe later. Dean couldn't wait that long to see Sam.
Twenty minutes after Dean revealed angels were real, Sam and Dean still sat on their respective places on the couch and bed. The conversation about angels and the fact that they were real had gone over to talking about a little of everything, mostly about old hunts.
Dean shrugged and crossed his arms protectively over his chest. “Yeah. I remember most of what they did to me. But after so long, the pain starts to blend together.” He paused for a second before he continued. “I remember what I did to others.”
“We’re in trouble, aren’t we?” She asked softly, looking up at Dean with big hazel eyes. “You guys scared?”
Dean shook his head, as he remembered how he ended up as Dean Winchester. “Michael, he tried to kill me. He slit my throat.” Dean whispered and touched his neck, phantom pain from the slash of a blade making him wince. “But the cut wasn’t deep enough, it didn’t kill me, obviously, but my grace was cut out instead and I fell. And I was reborn as Dean Winchester.”
Castiel sighed heavily in anger. "You know who we are and what we will do. I won't say it again. Leave now... or we lay you to waste." He threatened in his best commander voice.
With a shaky breath, Dean nodded. “Now, I just have to do the impossible task of stopping the Apocalypse. Both Michael and Lucifer.”
Julia looked at the two FBI agents in front of her. “Of course I want to help however I can.” She told them.
Dean thought, but answered out loud, “Yeah. Probably.”
Castiel’s lips twitched into a smile before his eyes flicked to Sam. “Sam Winchester, the boy with the demon blood.” Castiel said. But before the hurt could seep too far into Sam’s bones, Castiel smiled. “It’s a pleasure to meet you. Dean has told me a lot about you.”
Sam huffed in humor and rolled his eyes. “The sounds you and Castiel make are too much information.” He joked, managing to make Dean crack a smile.
Sam sighed heavily and mustered up his softest voice to deliver the hard blow. “Look, I'm sorry.” He apologized.
Anna raised an eyebrow in confusion as she questioned, “Why do you ask?”
Sam sat down next to her on the hood. Before he could initiate a conversation, Anna did it for him.
“I said no!” Sam growled and stood. He could feel his power spark up briefly with his anger, but it quickly calmed again.
Uriel smiled, something dark and emotionless. “Don't worry. I'll be gentle as I kill her.” He spoke.
“And that’s her grace?” Ruby asked as she crossed her arms over her chest.
Ariel brushed her brown hair out of her eyes as her deep brown eyes caught Castiel’s blue ones. “Castiel! What a pleasant surprise.” She smiled and went down the steps to kiss his cheek. “What are you boys talkin’ bout?” She asked and put her hands on her hips with a grin.
"Fuck you." Ruby spat. Either Alastair took her deal and got Anna, or he didn't take her deal and Anna remained hidden.
“Alastair?” Sam questioned. “The grand torturer of Hell?”
Alastair winced in mock hurt. "Name-calling. That hurt my feelings... You sanctimonious, fanatical prick." He smirked wildly.
Dean Winchester.” Castiel sighed heavily. “Apparently, Michael cut out his grace, which caused Jay to fall from Heaven. With no vessel, he was reborn as human. And on the 22nd of May, Dean Winchester was conceived, the same date Jay fell. He had no memories of us, only regained them when I touched his soul in Hell.” Castiel explained.
Castiel smiled as he brushed his knuckles along Dean’s cheek. “Ever since I first met you.” He admitted, watching Dean’s eyes widen. “Meeting you, becoming your friend, it was the first time I ever disobeyed an order. ‘Never interact with an archangel without permission’. After that, I broke rules, I had thoughts of my own. I had-”
Dean only looked away from the window when someone sat down in front of him. It was a man, in his mid thirties, with dark hair and the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen. He had a light scruff and his hair was wild, as if he'd just had some pretty epic sex. Though, dressed in a suit and trench coat, Dean doubted it.
Sam’s eyebrows furrowed in question. “He’s working a job?”
, referencing Dean’s title as an archangel, who had the brightest grace.
Castiel threw Dean a quick glare before his face went back to his neutral squinting face. “We have to hold the line. Too many seals have been broken already.”
“Those angels weren’t of very high tiers, nor did they have any fancy or important jobs. But they were needed for Heaven to stay in order. Do you remember them, Anna? Kim. Alan. Stan. Marilyn. Niki. Freddie. Paul. You killed them, and so many others, in cold blood. And because of that, you were sealed into Heaven’s prison. Right next to Gadreel. And in 1985, you ripped out your grace and disappeared.” Dean’s chilly tone echoed in the basement as silence spread when he finished.
Sam felt rage in his chest at the confession. “There are a thousand people here. You’re gonna kill them all just to get the witch?” He questioned.
Sam frowned. “You never asked if I brought you back.” Sam stated before he paused. “You know what brought you back.” Sam breathed. It wasn’t a question, it was a statement.
Balthazar walked over to the living room table and poured the whiskey into the glasses, holding out one of them for Castiel to take.
Anna placed her hand on the tree's trunk and a gasp of relief and horror passed from her lips. “It doesn’t matter.” She spoke and looked back at the demon and hunter. “It’s not here. Not anymore.” Her eyes held fear as she looked at the two who were determined to help her. “Someone took it.”
With a weak smile, Sam looked down into the book again as he whispered, “Yeah.”
“I found it in Heaven after you disappeared. I've been holding on to it ever since. Thought you should have it now that you're back.” Castiel said with a tentative smile.
“-Free will.” Dean finished for him. Castiel nodded in affirmative. Dean cracked a smile at the answer. “Well then, Cas, I think that’s going to be helpful in the long run. Makes you seem more human.” Dean answered with a yawn and tugged the covers higher to cover their chests. “And part of being human, is the need to sleep. And I’m exhausted.”
“Go.” Sam whispered to Ruby with a nod to the unconscious man on the floor, knowing her presence would make the situation worse.
Ariel smiled brightly in response to the green-eyed man’s praise. Noticing Balthazar’s questioning face, she explained, “Jay started teaching me stuff about his job before he fell. Said it would be good if more than one angel knew the secrets of Heaven.”
“You know I was your reaper, right? After the car crash caused by Azazel.” Tessa questioned the ex-archangel from the armchair she was sitting on in Ariel and Balthazar’s living room.
“Extra crunchy.” Ruby responded. “They’ll hide us from angels, demons. All comers.” She continued in a slightly proud voice.
“Morning.” Dean grunted and yawned loudly, feeling his jaw crack as he did.
Dean remembered the feel of Lucifer’s blunt blade as it cut through feathers, skin, muscle and bone. In his mind, Alastair and Lucifer fused together into one horrible being of pain and blood.
The man chuckled. “Well, I woulda thought you recognized your favorite brother.” He said with a playful frown.
Dean cleared his throat and looked at his brother, who looked more like the usual Sam that Dean knew and cared for. “Has she called you? Said where she and Anna is?” Dean asked softly.
Castiel frowned and shook his head. Dean felt like groaning, but controlled himself. “Okay, where is the nearest place to get supplies? Mainly water and food.” Dean asked.
All through the argument, Ruby had stood quietly and watched the brothers talking back and forth, but when Dean called her ‘hellhound bitch’, her eyes flicked to black and threw out her arm to pin Dean to the wall with her demonic powers. She growled loudly in response to Dean’s successful attempt at egging her on.
Dean had expected Sam to ask a billion questions about how Dean knew about that, but was surprised when Sam didn’t. He looked up at Sam in a questioning manner, and saw Sam staring behind him with mouth open in shock and eyes wide.
Dean couldn’t see it as he looked at the road below, but Sam looked at him with warm and caring eyes at the old nickname. “What about you?” He asked softly.
Kim= Kim Manners, an American television producer, best known for his work on X-Files &
“It’s where my grace touched down.” Anna stated. “I can feel it.”
With a thick swallow, Sam asked, “Yeah, how do I tore up?” He knew the answer, but was buying himself time to come up with an excuse to refuse.
As Ruby moved to stand in front of Dean, powers pressing him into the wall hard enough for the wall to groan at the weight, Dean grinned at Ruby. “Come on, do it.” Dean taunted as Ruby took her place in front of him. “Do it, kill me. Send me back downstairs and let Alastair finish what he started.” Ruby pressed him harder against the wall, but Dean laughed instead of screaming. “
Dean looked at the floor to hide the smile on his face, knowing that the angel would want to know why he was smiling at the simple fact that Castiel liked him.
“What’s Bobby gonna tell us that we don’t already know?” She questioned. Her voice was once again soft and calm.
“How?” Anna asked. Surely they weren’t going to ask an angel in person?
The two pulled away from each other and Dean turned his head away so Sam couldn’t see the tears threatening to escape. “Dude, put on a shirt, will you.” Dean requested, voice heavy with unspilled emotions.
“Keep the money? What-” Dean questioned as he watched his brother walk away and followed Sam with his eyes, finding his path lead him to Ruby. Dean felt his jaw tense as he followed after Sam towards the demon.
Dean smiled and raised his arm to smell his armpit. “You’re right.” Dean agreed and put down his arm. “Do you have any of my clothes?”
Dean questioned.
Listened to Jensen's album with Radio Company while writing and, fuck, his voice is amazing. (I hope he continues doing music after Supernatural is over and maybe starts a music career)
They walked in silence for a minute, before Castiel broke the silence. “Do you know who that lady was?” He asked with a smug glance at Dean.
Castiel pulled away, a heavy cloud of lust in his eyes. Dean smirked and started walking down the street, in the direction he knew Sam’s motel was in. He heard Castiel groan behind him and then quick footsteps as Castiel caught up to him.
A gust of wind hit Sam's shaking body and he shivered from the cold yet warm September air leaking inside. He looked up, searching for the source of the wind and saw that the balcony doors were open. He could’ve sworn he closed them before he went to bed. Frowning, Sam wiped his tears and stood from the bed, slowly walking to the balcony with the gun from underneath his pillow held firmly in his hand.
“Okay, Anna, nice and relaxed. Now, I’m going to count down from five to zero. When we’re at zero, you’ll be in a deep state of hypnosis. As I count, just go deeper and deeper, okay?” Missouri explained. “5… 4… 3… 2… 1… Deep sleep. Deep sleep. Every muscle is calmed and relaxed.”
Dean looked at the demon and his brother, sighing at the fact he couldn't identify Ruby as a demon anymore.
Dean smiled despite himself and whispered back his response just as quietly. “Nanaeel nonci t’hoath.”
"How dare you come in this room... you pussing sore?" Uriel growled and Dean could imagine the way his wings spread in threat.
Dean shook his head against Sam’s chest. “Sam, you don’t understand. I tortured so many people I lost count. I- I broke the first seal.” Dean confessed as his breathing hitched with tears.
The demons launched themselves at the angels and they began to fight for the upper hand while Sam ran over to Ruby to help her while Dean and Anna backed away and watched from the sidelines.
Ariel shook her head. “As much as I hate the plan, it could work. And I’m happy for any plan as long as it works. And Jensen is an archangel, they do have the right to command us to do anything. So, I’m in.”
Downstairs, Bobby plopped down in one of the kitchen chairs, smile still firmly in place. When he said he was happy for Dean, he meant it. He knew Dean hadn’t had any serious relationships before, that Dean was a virgin when it came to relationships -- but definitely not when it came to sex -- and now Dean was in a relationship and was happy about it. Though Bobby wasn’t sure he approved of Castiel being an angel.
I imagine that Ariel and Balthazar's house looks something like this:
“Where the Hell have you been?” Bobby growled. “It’s been 24 hours! You didn’t call, you didn’t text, we thought something happened to you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ruby ignored the humans in the attic and looked around anxiously. “We have to hurry.”
“I'm fine, thanks.” She sarcastically told the brothers when she noticed Dean helping the younger to his feet while neither of them checked on her.
“Everything.” She responded with a tiny smile. “You guys… you didn’t have to help me-” She said, but Sam cut her off.
Once again, the ending sucked. In the next chapter we'll meet Bobby!
As Dean went into the kitchen and got a towel for the spilled beer, he spoke to his fiancé. “And what the Hell are you talking about? I’m an amazing angel of family.” Dean exclaimed as he entered the living room again and threw down the towel at his former seat.
“Are you okay with that? With… me and Cas?” Dean asked tentatively, unsure if Sam had the same opinion on same-sex relationships and LGBTQ+ in general as John had. Dean could still remember the horrible words John had used to describe every same-sex relationship they saw.
Dean firmly shook his head in response. “Not if I can stop it. And I will gladly give my life if it means the Apocalypse is stopped.” Dean announced, honestly.
“Forget the angels.” She said, her voice scared out of nowhere. “It’s Alastair I’m scared of.” Her voice shook as she said the demon’s name, as if it would summon him.
Dean smiled and nodded before he opened the front door and walked outside.
Castiel ignored his fellow angel's comments and looked at the group consisting of the two hunters and the demon. “We're here for Anna.” He commanded in a voice full of authority. His lips twitched in a smile when he saw Dean shift on his feet and his pupils dilating.
I wanted Dean to have changed since Hell, not just by regaining his memories as Jensen, but also by being slightly traumatized by Hell and seek out pain. Also, the effects of the demon blood is made up by me and based of stuff I've read in other stories.
Alastair sharpened his razor, his favorite weapon. He traced the sharp side with his index finger, pressing down lightly until a bead of blood appeared. "Perfect." He whispered and turned to Ruby. "Now, how about you continue your assignment, keep using your blood on Sam. While Anna can kill Lilith and break the seal, the prophecy is that Lucifer's own vessel gets him out. It's more poetic, right up the Old Man's lane. He always were a tad over-dramatic."
Castiel nodded and smiled. “It was a test, to see how you would perform under… battlefield conditions, you might say. You know, so you can be Michael’s vessel.” He shrugged, trying not to jostle Dean’s head on his chest.
Dean sighed. “I saw it, the angel, with it’s huge wings and the three heads. It was frightening, but also captivating.” Dean explained, thinking back to how he felt when he saw Castiel before he regained his memories.
Dean huffed a breath of disbelief. “Yeah, I hear she does that a lot.” He muttered, thinking of how Ruby supposedly had saved Sam.
Anna breathed heavily in fear as she stuttered, “Your face- what happened to your face?”
Dean was dying. He was 100% sure he was dying. If he had to read one more Goddamn book, he was going to die. If not from boredom or sleep deprivation, then from the fact that the Apocalypse was going to start while he had his head buried in a book.
Dean smiled and easily translated the Enochian into an English response, “I love you, too.”
The younger Winchester opened his mouth to reply, but Dean cut him off. “They're dead. Sam and I found their bodies. I'm sorry.” He boldly told the red-head, but still sounded soft and kind.
Castiel soon shook his head back into reality, his eyes focusing up on Dean’s green orbs. “I must go.” The angel declared. “Heaven has given me orders to return back until further notice.” A stranger might not have seen it, but Dean caught the sad and worried look that flashed over his face. “Will you be alright?” He asked, concerned.
“Told ya on the the phone it was me.” Dean mumbled and sat up in the bed. He sleepily rubbed his eyes and hunched his back as he looked up at Sam and Bobby. “Hey, Bobby.” Dean greeted with a small smile and stood. He slowly went over to his surrogate father -- the only father he’s ever had who’s acted like a father -- and stood in front of him, unsure if he should hug him or not.
Silence spread across the room after Dean’s confession. Dean opened his eyes to look at the younger of the two. Sam sat frozen, shock covering his face. “Sam?” Dean questioned.
Sam chuckled. “Yeah, you got me there.” He laughed and looked away from here with a smile.
The attendant noticed and adapted a somewhat caring voice. “What’s the matter, sweetie?”
Dean, Tessa and the angels talked, joked and bantered with each other late into the night. The coffee table quickly filled with beer bottles and bowls of snacks as Dean became more and more drunk while the small amounts of alcohol in the beers barely had an effect on the angels and the reaper.
Anna shook her head and shrugged off Sam’s hand. “Dean told you, I disobeyed. So did Lucifer. I killed angels and many humans died because of me. Maybe I got to pay.”
Outside, Dean pulled on his jacket and started walking towards the city part of Sioux Falls, running his fingers over the Impala’s hood as he passed her. He set his course towards one of the bars in town, Queen’s Tavern, and smiled at the people he passed. Some of the older men and women knew him from the times he stayed in Sioux Falls as a child and he used to run around, eager to please.
Dean thought in horror.
Fun fact: the document I'm writing this story in currently has 72 512 words (if I come up with an idea for future chapters, I often go and write those while I'm still writing the chapter that I'm currently on.)
“Dean.” Bobby breathed and looked the young man up and down. One moment Dean simply stood in front of Bobby, the next he was in a tight hug of Bobby’s, almost crushing him. Dean gladly hugged him back, and held back his tears with more force than before. Damnit, how long was he going to tear up as soon as someone gently touched him?
Lilith! She’s manipulating you!”
"Yeah?" Ruby breathed, fear audible in her voice. "Desperate times." She chuckled nervously.
Dean fell to the ground while Alastair and the angel fought. “Jensen…” Dean mouthed, his own name, his real name. He breathed heavily, shock seeping through his brain as tremors wracked his body.
Julia nodded in answer. “Two months ago, she was happy, well-adjusted, journalism major, lots of friends. Bright future.”
Dean didn’t respond and instead looked at the angel with soft eyes as he bent his head to kiss the angel, nothing but a quick chaste kiss. He closed his eyes when they pulled away, enjoying the silence and the presence of his fiancé.
Julia swallowed thickly and made a note on Anna’s clipboard. “So, you were saying that there are, uh, 66 of these seals in the world?” She questioned.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anna walked up to him so they were walking shoulder to shoulder and she looked up at him with wide and curious eyes. “In Hell, you mean?” She asked and immediately regretted it when Dean froze and looked at her with a hard glare.
“Thanks a lot.” Sam mumbled, ashamed, and glared  daggers into Dean's skull.
Anna shrugged. “Kind of. I mean, same bottom line. This demon, Lilith, is trying to break the 66 seals to free Lucifer from Hell. Lucifer... Will bring the apocalypse. So... Smoke 'em if you got 'em.” She answered before she turned her head as the whispering in her head got louder.
Castiel just smiled softly and shook his head.
Halfway through Castiel’s retelling, Dean’s panic had started to calm and when the soldier had finished, he was entirely calm. “You never told me that.” Dean sniffled, thinking of the last part of the retelling.
“It's not uncommon for our patients to believe that monsters are real.” Julia commented and Dean hid his smile at the truth of his statement by looking down in the notebook.
“No.” Sam relied firmly. “I’m not doing that anymore.”
“Oh, Baby. Sammy hasn't treated you alright at all, has he?” Dean murmured to the car. Then, he noticed the car wasn't polished at all, it was dirty, as if Sam hadn't washed the car since Dean died. Oh, Sam had Hell to pay for mistreating Dean's Baby.
“How do you know all of that?” Sam whispered in question.
“Hello, Sam Winchester.” Missouri answered warmly.
Later, Sam sat in Bobby’s library, surrounded by old books and magazines. He’d been reading through several magazines while Anna sat outside and looked at the stars, thinking about her birthplace amongst the stars.
“Sam!” Dean's sharp voice cut through the younger’s story, causing Sam to look up in question. “Too much information!”
Dean groaned loudly as Bobby sputtered out a shocked ‘angel?!’. Bobby looked at Dean with wide eyes. Dean sighed, and rubbed his eyes. “I’ll tell you everything. But right now, I need a drink.” Dean replied, starting to move towards the fridge, but was stopped when Sam held out a beer bottle for him.
Castiel chuckled and received a glare from the hunter. “A little over 2 in the afternoon.” Castiel stated calmly.
"Ready to tell me where she is?" Alastair asked as he brought the blade to Ruby's inner thigh where he placed a cut by the knee and dragged the blade upwards, cutting all the way up and making blood pool on the dentist chair under her.
“Anyways, you coming out aside, there's more to the story.” Sam announced after a few more jokes.
“He does that a lot.” Dean offered. “Flying away and then coming back without warning. He actually scared the crap out of me when he appeared here earlier.” Dean shrugged with a chuckle.
(It's actually Jensen's home. I tried to find something original but couldn't find anything so I chose Jensen's house since he has a beautiful, big and expensive house, which is what I imagine Balthazar and Ariel would live in)
“Missouri.” He greeted her with a hug. First time he had met her, she hadn’t been too keen on him, but she had warmed up to him after a few more cases that they needed her help on.
* Castiel said.
The smell of copper tinged with sulphur made Sam realize how long it had been since his last hit. The need overwhelmed him and Sam let out a low growl. He yanked her body against him and smashed their lips together in a rough kiss, full of teeth and tongue. Sam felt a rush of air as Ruby took them to the motel room they always stayed in when they… did their thing.
Alastair slowly turned around and looked at the green-eyed hunter. "Dean, Dean, Dean... I am so disappointed. You had such promise." He crooned and launched himself at the ex-archangel, taking him by his jacket and pressing him up against the wall.
Hell. One side, maybe, but not both. Not at once.”
the seals from breaking.”
(4215 words)
Dean chuckled. “If I know you correctly, you’re gonna order a salad.”
Dean smiled, half sad-half happy, and softly kissed the angel’s cheek. When he pulled back, he saw the unfocused look in Castiel’s eyes which Dean had come to associate with the angel radio. He waited patiently while he studied Jimmy Novak’s face. Pink lips, the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen, dark hair; not quite black and not quite brown, short stubble; as if he had forgotten to shave the last few days.
Castiel put his hand to Alastair's forehead so he could exorcise him, but nothing happened. The torturer's strength was too much for the angel's powers to deal with. The angel removed his hand and stared at the demon with wary eyes.
Dean sighed heavily. “God, I hope so. Otherwise he’s at Hedonism in a banana hammock and a trucker cap.” He commented with a face of slight disgust.
Dean shrugged. “Not really. I mean, I can feel their power around me, as if they're here. But I know they aren't.”
Anna looked at him curiously before she looked to Castiel and Uriel and noticed the chain around his neck and the faint blue glow under his shirt and was struck with the realization. With the realization, she walked more confidently over to the angels.
At least she's not in pain anymore.
Sam took hold of his brother again and ran. Away from the church, away from Anna. Away from Alastair. He got his older brother to the Impala and shoved Dean into the passenger seat before sitting down in the driver’s seat and rushing out of there, way above the speed limit.
The subject changed from the Apocalypse to other stuff soon, once Dean had explained everything. Soon the clock was over 2 in the morning and Bobby left to get a room. After a quick game of rock, paper, scissors, Sam took the bed while Dean laid down on the couch. Though he didn’t lay there for long. As soon as he heard Sam’s breathing even out, he got up and went out on the balcony.
Dean wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket before he stood on shaky legs which quickly gave out under him. Sam caught him before he collapsed to the ground and held him up and slung Dean’s arm over his shoulder.
Dean let out a snort of laughter at Uriel’s response. “Right. Cause you’re bigger picture kind of guys.” Dean muttered. He firmly shook his head and stepped closer to Uriel and Castiel, Sam reaching out a hand to stop him. “We’ll stop this witch before she summons anyone. Your seal won’t be broken and no one has to die.”

The angel smiled. “I gave you a piece of my grace so you can heal yourself if you get injured.” Castiel frowned. “Please, try and not get yourself killed.”
The angel straightened it’s back and turned to look naturally between Sam and Dean. “Well, now that the first seal is broken, demons are rushing to break the rest.” A heavy sigh left him. “9 seals have been broken so far. 57 remains. And it’s impossible to know which of the thousands seals the demons will try to break next.”
“Don't mean the case is real.” Dean muttered, but Sam still heard him. “And this hospital's a three-day drive.” Dean complained.
Sam smiled calmly, something evil glinting in his eyes. “She doesn't know that we know her secret. She's still helping us. We can use her to our benefits and when she doesn't have a purpose anymore, we'll kill her.” Sam suggested, his eyebrow raised in suggestion.
Sam stood and looked through the photos on display and picked one up. “Do you still have the sketches from Anna’s notebook?” He asked.
The psychiatrist raised an eyebrow. “Since when does the Book of Revelations have jack-o'-lanterns?”
“As a matter of fact, we are heartless. And?” Castiel responded with a confident voice.
Constructive criticism is appreciated!
Castiel smiled warmly. “Of course.” Placing a huge hand on Dean’s shoulder, they flew away in a flutter of black wings.
Julia watched her turn away with a faraway look in her eyes and was immediately concerned. “Anna?” She questioned.
“For bringing you into this. If I had known, I would have kept my trap shut.” She explained.
With the demons occupied and Uriel distracted with killing said demons, Anna rushed over to the dark-skinned angel and yanked the necklace -- which had popped out of his shirt during the fight -- from his neck and ran away from the fight into an unoccupied area of the barn.
(2770 words)
Castiel’s feathers fluttered as he teleported away.
Crouching down in front of his brother,  Dean showed no sign of realizing Sam was there. Sam carefully laid a hand on Dean’s shoulder, stopping for a second when he saw the hand-shaped brand burnt into the skin below his shoulder. The contact on Dean’s skin did nothing to bring him back to reality. “Dean.” Sam said and shook Dean’s shoulder lightly. There was no reaction.
Sam looked at the green-eyed hunter with wide eyes. How could Dean not blame him? How could Dean forgive him? But Sam knew the answer; Dean was too kind, had a too big heart. Forgave too easily and loved so fiercely. Dean's heart, even as loving as it was, was wounded and full of scars, from people that had hurt him over the years; some made by Sam's own doing.
At 11 PM, when Castiel barely could stand straight anymore, Dean decided to get the angel to bed and said goodbye to his two younger siblings.
Sam didn’t understand at first before he realized. Dean must have sent a text pretending to be him. Sam cleared his voice with a cough before he answered his surrogate father. “Yeah, it was meant for you. Sorry, I haven’t slept much.” Sam apologized with an easy half lie. He actually hadn’t slept much.
“What are you looking at?” Dean asked as he pushed himself out of the coffin and out of the grave. Huffing, Dean looked back down in the hole. He could almost see Sam’s long fingers working the boards together as he carefully built the coffin meant to be Dean’s final resting place.
Missouri looked at him with a small smile before she pulled him into a hug. “You better call, Dean Winchester. And you better introduce me to this fiancé of yours that your mind keep coming back to. I’d love to meet him sometime.” She said softly before releasing the hunter from her hug.
Ruby bit her lip to avoid her scream becoming too audible. Blood pooled in her mouth from where she had bit through her lip and it seeped into the back of her throat.
Castiel watched him from the doorway as Dean walked around, taking some candy bars and beef jerky, which he ate quickly, as he went behind the cash register. Pushing a few buttons, it opened and Dean pocketed the cash he took.
"No!" Uriel yelled as Anna threw the necklace to the floor, releasing her grace. The soft blue light flowed from the vial and into her mouth.
Dean circled Anna as he recounted her crimes and the things she had skipped over in her story. “Well, for starters, she was their commander until she was locked into Heaven’s prisons, a couple of decades before she mysteriously ‘disappeared’.” Dean said with air quotes. “And she was thrown into prison because she disobeyed orders, like she said, but what she didn’t say was that that one single disobeyment resulted in a mass death of humans. Because she refused to kill one man, thousands, millions even, lost their lives. And when she was demoted because of her disobeyment, she killed several angels.” He explained, watching Anna lower her gaze to the floor in shame. But Dean ruthlessly continued.
Sam, who had been staring at them with a look of horror, immediately surged forward at Dean’s call, laying the formerly possessed man on the floor before he rushed to Ruby and pulled her back by the shoulder. Ruby’s concentration broke and Dean dropped to the floor on his knees where he chuckled madly.
start another fight, especially after the destruction of the motel room. “What about the blood?” Sam asked, eyeing the drying twin rivers of blood under Dean's nose and the specks of red which were still covering Dean's lips.
Castiel gave a weak shrug. "We don't know. Just that it has something to do with the seals."
” He ordered and reluctantly handed over the Impala’s keys to the younger Winchester.
let her get the grace.” Dean begged desperately.
On his way to the motel entrance, Dean passed the Impala and ran his fingers over the polished black metal, only to stop when he saw an iPod jack in Baby’s dashboard.
For a second, Sam was silent, didn’t speak. Then he opened his mouth and spoke. “You should have stayed in Hell.” Sam said in a natural voice, but with anger hidden right beneath the surface. “Everything was so much easier then.” As soon as the words exited Sam’s mouth, he seemed to realize what he had said and his face immediately morphed into a guilty one.
your side.”
Dean shrugged. "I don't know. But you should have kept your eyes on her, after all, she's your Hell buddy." He spoke with a tone of anger and took a drink from his flask.
"How can you arrive so quickly?" Sam asked in a confused voice
“I can tell you the exact date. September 18th.” Anna responded in a strong and confident voice.
“Sounds… peaceful, I guess.” Sam commented after a minute of Dean's silence.
Ruby smirked at the hunter, playfully nudging him. “You’re pretty buff for a nerd.” She teased him.
Dean walked around for half an hour before he found an okay-looking diner. The money Dean took from the gas station cash register would be enough for a burger and a coffee to fill Dean's empty stomach.
“Anna.” Dean called, but received no response. “Anna!” He called a little louder and Anna looked up at him, looking a little dazed. But Dean wasn't looking at her, he was looking at the mirror behind her where sigils were painted in hr blood. Angel banishing sigils.
“Why not?” Dean responded emotionlessly. “I’ve wanted to die for a long time. On and off for years, decades. But I always stayed because there was always something keeping me here.”
The hunter had reached the front door when Missouri reached him. He whirled around and looked at the woman with a tired expression, but managed a smile. “Take care.” He told her.
Castiel sat up fully in the bed and looked at Dean with loving eyes. “Shouldn’t you take a shower before you leave? You’re kind of covered in - everything.”
Anna huffed loudly. “Beats being an angel.”
Castiel pulled back his hand and sat back on his heels to watch the human. For a second, nothing happened, then Dean bolted upright as he inhaled as much air as he could hold before letting it out with a heavy cough.
Castiel nodded and smiled brightly. “Yeah. Jay had to eat something before he passed out.” Castiel paused for a second before continuing. “But Jay’s human now. Michael cut out his grace, he fell and was reborn as human.”
He felt Castiel's grace grow warm in affirmative and Dean shuddered at the feeling.
Castiel’s intense eyes stared into the green of Dean’s. “You are upset. I heard your soul screaming out for me.” Castiel explained. His eyes softened when he found that Dean was unharmed, but frowned when he saw the tear tracks on Dean’s cheeks. “Are you alright?”
Dean asked in his mind, not wanting anyone to hear him talking to seemingly no one.
An hour later, Sam sat outside on the car from Bobby’s junkyard, reading through one of the several books they had on angels. The hand-written words were hard to understand, but he managed well enough.
“Well,” Dean started, with a smile. “Cheers! To a new beginning!” He exclaimed and took a gulp of water.
Anna replied in place for Dean, "And because once Heaven gets me, then they'll leave you alone." She pressed a kiss to Sam's cheek. Dean raised his eyebrows in shock, he was not ready for Sam to be with an angel as well as a demon. His sister, for Christ's sake!
Castiel smiled, eyes trailing over the human body. “You.” Castiel smirked. Dean turned around when he spoke, eyes fond and loving. “I’m looking at you. Your soul is almost as beautiful as your true form but not quite.” He clarified.
Hours later, a hospital attendant entered Anna’s room with a bottle of pills in his hands. “Time for your meds, Anna.” He said in greeting. But Anna didn’t seem to hear him. “Anna?” He tried again.
They reached the surface and burst up through the crack in the ground created by the angels so that Dean’s soul could come out. The angels could come out by themselves with their teleporting.
Dean shook his head and stood from the bed, needing to move with the anger building under his skin, stomping over to stand in the small kitchen with Sam following him. “It’s ‘have’, Sam, as you’re apparently still sleeping with her! And what Cas and I have is wildly different!” Dean growled in anger. “I’m not going to become corrupted for being in a relationship with Cas, nor am I drinking his blood like it’s some fancy shot of whiskey!”
“Uh, black, please.” Dean answered.
“Thanks.” Dean replied, smiling as he slipped the ring onto his finger. The sigils glowed briefly and the ring shrank into the perfect size for his body.
“Anna escaped from prison. No one knows where she is.” Castiel informed him. Dean wasn’t worried. What’s the worst she could do?
"He can be replaced." The dark-skinned angel replied, never breaking his gaze from Dean , who just stared back, neither of them backing down.
Dean turned back around to look at the red-haired girl. “Well, at least now we know why the demons want you so bad. They get a hold of you, they can hear everything the other side's cooking. You're 1-900-angel.”
“What about them?” Anna asked, getting even more worried as no one would tell her what happened.
Castiel straightened and turned to look at Dean. He stretched out his hand to Dean, wordlessly telling him to come over. Dean took his hand, feeling a shock of electricity shoot out from Castiel’s true form and buzz into Dean’s arm, causing the sense of pins and needles across his arm and chest.
Sam looked at him with eyes showing an emotion almost like worry. Or was that pity? Dean couldn’t really tell as he shouldered past Sam and collapsed into the chair he had occupied during the last days and picked up one of the books from the pile on the desk.
“Married to Balthazar? Yes.” Castiel smiled. “She and Balthazar were the only ones who thought I wasn't insane as I kept searching for you.” Castiel’s smile dropped and Dean felt guilt swell in his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean put on a reassuring smile. “Relax. I was just at a girl’s house and stopped for some dinner in town. Must have left my phone here. I really didn’t mean to get you worried.” Dean apologized and took off his jacket and immediately felt eyes on his hickey covered neck. As long as they weren't asking, he wouldn't explain.
Dean scoffed. “Danielle, the waitress, who flirted with me and was eyeing you as if she wanted to bang you?” Dean answered.
Dean sighed heavily and looked at the younger Winchester with tired eyes. “I know that she isn't innocent. Cas told me that. But I don't know why they want to kill her.” Dean explained.
“A little scared, I guess.” Anna elaborated when Sam quietened. “I, um, wanted to thank you, Sam.” She stated.
Castiel's angelic voice answered in Dean's head.
Dean asked as a prayer to Castiel, receiving a small nod in answer.
Dean hummed in response as Sam said their goodbyes to the doctor and Dean slammed the notebook shut when he saw the gruesome illustration of the seal he broke himself. ‘
Ruby glared at him. “What, forever?” She sarcastically questioned.
Dean stopped in his tracks as he remembered his old friend. “Ariel…” He whispered. Ariel was an angel, one of his best friends, and a excellent warrior. And she was married to his and Castiel’s friend Balthazar. Or she was before Dean fell. “Is she still-” Dean started, but was interrupted by Castiel.
The younger looked at him with a tired face. “Yeah. But there’s something in the report. Turns out her latest psych episode wasn’t her first.” He spoke and got a hum as a sign to continue. “When she as 2 and a half, she’d get hysterical any time her dad got close. She was convinced it wasn’t her real father.” He continued and looked up at Dean with an expectant face.
“No. No!” Anna screamed, her voice rising louder and louder. “NO!”
“Thank you, Missouri.” Anna politely thanked the psychic. “That helps a lot. I can remember now.”
, he spoke in parting.
Anna Milton sat on her bed in the psychiatric ward of the Connor Beverly Behavioral Medicine Center, hearing the whispering of several voices in her head. Her psychiatrist, Julia Jones, sat a few feet away from the bed, asking her questions she offered as little response as possible to.
Sam huffed and moved his hand away. His fingers barely grazed the brand on Dean’s shoulder, and caused Dean to inhale a sharp and rough intake of air, before Dean started coughing. Dean caught his breath and looked up at Sam, then back down at himself.
“To who? Dad?” Dean asked with a chuckle. He had a hate for his father that he never talked about, though Castiel seemed to know anyways.
Castiel pulled the green-eyed man closer so Dean was sitting sideways on his lap, his ass by the angels crotch and his legs thrown over onto the couch cushions. The blue-eyed angel put his head in the crook of Dean’s neck as he spoke, lips brushing over bare skin, “You’re such a nerd.”
Sam frowned. “How can you even say that?” He snapped. “How is this a just plan?”
Dean stood in his soul form and watched as Castiel used his grace to dig into the ground. In his soul form, he could see the grace carefully lifting the pieces into the air.
“30 years?!” Sam asked, shocked as he took a step back. “You were in Hell for 30 years?! Oh God… ” With grace enhanced senses, Dean could hear Sam’s heart beating quickly as shock spread through his body. His face went pale as all blood drained from it.
Julia nodded and concluded her appointment with a few more notes on the clipboard.
“Look, I disobeyed… which for us is the worst thing you can do.” Anna spoke and paused before adding, “I fell.”
“It’s fine.” Sam automatically replied, even though he wasn’t ‘fine’. Not really.
Dean sighed and rubbed his eyes. “Just… skip the nudity.” He commanded firmly and looked up at Sam with tires eyes.
When Sam parked outside the diner, he sat in the car for a few seconds as he watched the september sun dip closer and closer to the horizon. With a sigh, Sam got out of the Impala and got inside the diner.
Anna nodded and sighed heavily. “Why doesn’t he like me?” She asked. “I killed angels. Does he not consider angels as bad guys? I thought Dean would be happy when he found out I killed angels.” She questioned in a lost voice.
“Well, you got a lot of nerve showing up anywhere near me.” Dean growled as he came up next to them. “Or Sam for that matter.” He added with a fierce glare.
Dean pulled away from the demon in shock. “Angels?” He asked. “They’re real? And they’re here to take me away? Why?”
Castiel supplied.
Dean offered his fiancé a reassuring smile before he went back into 'Dean Winchester’ mode. “Please tell me you're here to help. We've been having demon issues all day.” Dean said with a hint of sarcasm. He knew very well why they were there.
Dean suggested.
Castiel smiled a bright smile. “My name is Castiel. I’m an angel of the Lord, the one who gripped Dean tight and raised him from perdition.”
Dean chuckled lightly as Balthazar raised an eyebrow in question to his wife. “I’ve taught you well.” The ex-archangel told his friend, feeling his throat clog up.
Dean thanked her for the meal as well as the phone which he handed it back to her. He paid the bill with the money from the gas station and didn't bother to hide his smile when he saw that he wasn't charged for the coffee. Dean stood up and encouraged Castiel to do so as well. “Thanks you for the food and everything, but if you excuse us, my fiancé and I have to go see my uncle.”
Missouri smiled and nodded to herself. “Now, Anna, tell me… How can you hear the angels? How did you work that spell?” She asked.
But before the angels could move, Alastair appeared with a bleeding Ruby and a handful of other demons. Dean tensed up at the sight of his torturer, fear seizing his body.
Castiel places a soft kiss on his forehead as he murmured a ‘morning’ back to the ex-archangel.
As Sam stood bent over the trunk, he heard a familiar clicking of heels behind him. “Hello, Sammy.” The female voice greeted.
“Anna, um… your parents…” Sam started but broke off. He always found it hard to tell people their loved ones were dead.
“How?” Sam asked. “How do you know they aren't here?”
“I don’t want to.” Anna whimpered in fear, brows furrowing and tears leaking out from her closed eyes.
Uriel chuckled darkly. “Well, I can see that. You want to explain why you have that
He opened the trunk and pulled out Dean’s duffel, brushing off the dust that had collected over the 4 months Dean was gone. Or technically 3 months as Sam had taken out Dean’s duffel out of habit for the first month after the hellhounds.
Sam took the Impala to the diner down the street instead of walking. The purr of the Impala’s engine did nothing to drown out his thoughts. Dean had been saved by angels. Angels were real.
When they broke apart from the kiss, they leaned their foreheads together and danced around the room. As Castiel briefly let go of Dean, only to grasp his hand and spin him, Dean hummed on an old tune. He couldn’t remember the lyrics, but he knew the melody by heart. Once Dean was back in Castiel’s arms, they moved to the song Dean hummed.
Dean failed to stop the seal from breaking. Lilith broke the
Dean dropped the towel and quickly dressed in his clothes as Sam came out of the bathroom with Dean’s dirty clothes which he put in the laundry bag.
Dean and Castiel smiled at each other, looking into each other's eyes. Unfortunately, their moment of being engaged -- again -- was interrupted when Danielle came back over.
Alastair released a growl as he took hold of Sam’s jacket. “You're gonna have to try a whole lot harder than that, son.” Alastair sneered and threw Sam away from him.
“Uh, the Dominican.” Dean answered. “He said we break anything, we buy it.” He recounted what the gruff hunter had told him over the phone.
Sam and Dean made their way up the stairs of the church with their guns drawn, heading towards the attic. The attic itself was a mess, full of scattered items used to decorate the church during the different holidays.
Anna opened her mouth to agree, but was cut off by Dean’s angry voice. “It’s not gonna be the four of us against them. No, we leave Anna to the angels.” Dean spoke in a cold voice.
“Yeah, thanks.” Sam answered in a low voice.
"Bring her to the torture rooms. It's about time I teach her some lessons." Alastair commanded the demons who nodded and disappeared from Alastair's sight.
Anna smiled weakly at Dean’s joke before she tentatively asked, “Hey, um, do you know- are my parents okay? I-I didn't go home. I was too afraid.” She looked up at them with wide hazel eyes, begging them for any news.
Alastair glared at the angels. "Don't touch a hair on that poor girl's head." He hissed and gestured to Anna.
Also, sorry for the weird (and awkward) sex joke
Uriel looked to Castiel with a bored expression. “We’re wasting time with these mud monkeys.” He muttered to the other angel.
"She cares about Sam, but still manipulates him." Dean whispered against Castiel's dress shirt. "What does Hell even want with Anna?"
Dean raised his head and glared at the blue-eyed man. “Who are you and what have you done to my sweet, innocent Castiel?” He jokingly questioned.
“About what?” Anna asked with a confused smile. She looked between the brothers and then over her back to glance at Ruby.
“Yes,” Dean confessed.
“How do you even know that I’ll become corrupted? Just because Castiel said so, doesn’t mean it’s going to happen!” Sam snapped at his older brother.
Sam nodded and took a hold of Anna's arm and rushed her into one of the back rooms. While Sam was gone, Dean reached into the back of his jeans and let his fingers brush over his gun, which would be useless in case of an angel or demon attacking them. The younger Winchester came back a minute later, without Anna, and gave the older a confirming nod that Anna was safe.
“Apparently, she knocked him unconscious. The blow caused some amnesia. He doesn't even remember coming into her room.” The psychiatrist explained, still shocked that the quiet and docile girl she’s been looking after had attacked a doctor that tried to help her.
Anna smiled at the older Winchester, looking into his eyes as she answered, “I’m an angel.”
Uriel glared at the long-haired hunter. "This isn't over." He growled.
Dean stared at the spot where the angels had been staring for a second before he turned his face to look at Sam. “Well, you heard him.” He spoke. “Lets hunt ourself a witch.”
Dean chuckled and looked down at the ground, embarrassed.  He had never believed he was beautiful. Not when Castiel said it, nor Gabriel, not when one of his lovers said it.
Dean smirked at her, his little sister. "It's 2 a.m. somewhere." He spoke and tried to ignore how his hands were shaking. The fear and the threat of the angels throwing him back into Hell was starting to be visible.
Dean stood frozen as the demon turned it’s gaze to him. “Alastair.” Dean breathed, seeing the white eyes despite the meat suit not showing them, the white shining in Alastair’s true form.
Julia nodded silently, not agreeing but also not disagreeing. “It’s okay. You can tell me. I’m here to listen.” She responded softly and made a quick note on the clipboard in her hand.
“I love you too, nerd.” Castiel whispered back.
When Dean moved to pull away, Castiel chased after him and put their lips back together. “Please stay. It’s been so long, please just… stay with me.” Castiel begged.
Ruby gathered her confidence and spoke, "No. But I'll show you."
"Angel air." Dean replied as he stepped into the living room. Samandriel, Balthazar and Ariel looked at him with questioning eyes. The green-eyed man covered the receiver as he asked them, "Who's sober enough to get me to Kentucky?"
, just as a brunette waitress came up to his table.
Dean chuckled at the answer. “Oh, it must be nice, to be so sure of yourselves.” He smirked. Soldier angels; not a single ounce of free will in them. Or Castiel had some free will, but still not as much as humans.
WARNING FOR TORTURE (with some sexual nature) ATTEMPTED RAPE AND FOR BAD THOUGHTS FROM SAM
Castiel smiled against Dean’s lips as he deepened the kiss. The kiss heated quickly and soon the two were pulling their clothes off.
Dean prayed to his fiancé, thinking of Sam's plan to bring the demons.
Anna shook her head firmly. “No.” She responded in a commanding voice.
“I know you’re drinking demon blood, Sam.” Dean whispered. Sam’s head shot up to look at his brother. Dean’s eyes had turned from playful to almost empty. “I know that’s how you managed to exorcise the demon.”
