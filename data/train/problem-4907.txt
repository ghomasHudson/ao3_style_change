'Would someone who doesn't care build Clint a prosthesis so he can hear again? When will you finally stop pretending to be selfish and let everyone see what a brilliant compassionate man you are?' Steve smiles, knowing that this is not something Tony will ever do. He's been hurt too much in the past to trust people easily with this part of himself. 'I love you. With your hiding and pretending and everything.'
Barton still seems surprised. He eyes the bag, then Tony. 'Why do you know sign language?', he asks out loud.
Tony shakes his head. It takes more than an hour before he feels ready to leave the bathroom again. Steve has already prepared the bed and is sitting on it, clearly waiting for Tony to arrive.
Tony doesn't bother knocking and opens the door. 'Still awake?', he signs when Barton looks up surprised from a book Natasha had probably left for him. 'That's not very advisable. You had quite the accident there, you should rest, you know.'
Tony strokes the brown hair back before setting him down on the ground. 'He still needs a lot of rest.', Tony evades just when the girls enter the living room, probably to get some refreshments.
Tony immediately composes himself, nothing in his posture indicates that he had been asleep not half a minute ago. His whole demeanor changes from peaceful to annoyed and busy. 'Good that you're finally here.' He takes a look at his watch as if he has more important things to do than talk to them. 'Means I don't have to hang around.' He stands up, pretending to have spent the night here against his will, as if someone had forced him and not as if he'd fallen asleep talking to Clint. 'See you later, sweetheart.', he says to Steve in that flat media voice the blond knows so well but that Tony hadn't used on him in quite a while. 'Romanov. Legolas.' With that he leaves the room, not once glancing back.
'Oh, really? How exactly did you think I would react to the message that your psychotic friend murdered my parents and you taking his side?', Tony asks, already feeling himself get worked up again.
Tony finally opened up to him after months, told him about his life and his nightmares, had shown Steve all those beautiful sides he usually keeps wrapped up, has made it impossible for Steve not to fall in love with him, deeply and irrevocably.
Steve sighs, knowing it's useless to run after him. Tony flees into his workshop, locking the door behind him with a strict instruction to Jarvis to not let anyone inside, not even with a security overwrite. His brain is too full, too many thoughts circle around him and threaten to suffocate the inventor. He is shaking, can't get a grip on the reaction. Within seconds hard rock fills the whole room, louder than normal but not loud enough. Just then Tony allows the tears to fall.
He shakes his head. 'You did everything you could. You are a hero, Tony.', Steve whispers, tears in his voice. He sniffles. 'I'm so glad you're here with me.'
Tony huffs out a laugh but cuddles deeper into the embrace. 'Sap.', he says, as if he would mind. Then, very quietly, he says: 'I love you too.'
'Two targets.', he mumbles, continuing to stare at the page as if that would change the words written on them. His hands start trembling so he shuts the folder with more force than necessary. 'What's the meaning of this?', Tony asks through gritted teeth. He can't look at Steve, can't do anything but sit there and stare at the blank folder in front of him. It seems to mock him.
It weighs heavy on the kids as well. Maria doesn't ask a lot of questions any more, she and James look like they're afraid they might set up this shaky balance.
'How long will you be out today?', Tony asks casually though Steve can hear that he wants him home rather sooner than later.
It was supposed to be a normal training exercise before it all went wrong. Everything is a little fuzzy as Tony stares at the nurse before slowly taking off his suit.
Steve still feels unsure around Tony after he almost confessed his love to him. He suspects that Tony notices that something is amiss but he hadn't said anything until now. Nevertheless, Steve decided he wouldn't stay away from Tony as long as the genius doesn't demand this.
'Captain Rogers asks if he should join you.', the AI answers not even thirty seconds later. At least Steve seems to have gotten the message.
'You're one talking.' That sounds more like the Barton Tony had had a prank war with which is now on temporary hold until things had quieted down a bit. Tony grins back, leaning his elbows on his knees.
The sun had already set when Tony climbs out of his lab to grab some dinner and look after his favorite super soldier. The latter had only been released from the hospital three weeks ago (an age, as Steve claimed repeatedly, almost too long to be remembered) and refused to be looked after for two and a half weeks. He is no child and not as gravely injured as everyone seemed to claim, Steve said whenever someone asked him how he is and if they could help somehow. Tony understood the wish to not be fussed about (though he isn't happy, he likes to fuss about his beloved husband), so he granted his husband the space he needs right now. After all, that's how he prefers it to heal alone as well.
It's almost overwhelming to have Tony's full attention on oneself like Steve has right now. He loves to watch Tony focus on one of his gadgets. When it's on himself, Steve always feels important beyond words. Tony could do that to almost anybody but Steve is particularly sensitive towards his attention, maybe because he craves it so much. The blond colors deeply.
He is still fuming by the time he reaches Clint's farm house, a good hour's drive from the Tower. Mistakes! How does he even dare? Tony gets out of the car and knocks on the door. It sounds impatient even to himself. After some moments Clint opens the door. He is in clothes which suggest that he was about to work in the garden or fix something outside. In the background Tony can hear the kids playing somewhere and Laura sending them out of the kitchen.
The door to the workshop opens up in front of him, Steve ignores his shaking knees and enters the room. This is no big deal, he tells himself. The worst thing that could happen would be that Tony would never want to talk to him again. No big deal, right?
'Tony.' The word is slurred, slightly mispronounced given the fact that Barton can't hear himself anymore. His eyes flit between Tony and his hands.
Steve would never have to know that there had never been any agents from AIM anywhere close to the mountain region. He would never have to know how exactly the hand print of Bucky had found its way to Tony's arm when he tried to redirect Tony's repulsor blast aimed at the Winter Soldier's head. He would never have to know just how far Tony is willing to go for their relationship.
Clint apparently feels the same, alas, for the world in general. He is depressed by his lack of progress and especially since his friends need to sign him everything slowly, the conversations aren't very interesting nor informative since none of them knows more than a few basic words. The man is clearly sulking, and let's be honest, who wouldn't? Because of his broken leg he can't even leave the bed, the condition worsened by the fact that he can't keep his balance anymore because of the injury of his ear. He grows more irritated by the minute by his friends' behavior.
'Tony?', Steve calls into the dark room. He knows better than not to check as his boyfriend would sometimes hide in the dark with a tablet and Jarvis to keep him company.
'This is more than I had hoped for.', Barnes admits, feeling the tech with his fingers, snapping them just to see if he would hear it.
Tony's thoughts come to a standstill and despite the very comfortable position he feels wide awake for a moment. Then his mind quiets down. He hesitates, pushing his face closer to Steve's chest. Finally he nods once.
Silently Tony sits down, preparing himself for the worst, yet he has no idea what this is about. It's not about Barnes, that much he is sure of. Steve wouldn't be so cryptic about it then. It wouldn't feel so final. This is personal. Whatever he had found must have something to do with the inventor or their kids.
Steve sighs. 'I wasn't sure but Jarvis investigated this a lot faster than either of us could. He found some old records of your father. They say he wanted to take his own version of the super soldier serum to Washington the week before Christmas 1991.' Steve rifles through his papers once more and pulls out some files, spreading them in front of Tony. 'Hydra later had that serum or at least one with a very similar working. Those are from February 1992.' Still in shock Tony opens the folders, taking in the pictures of several Hydra agents who seem to have been injected with a kind of super soldier serum. What happened to them the reports don't say. Steve explains his findings. However, Tony can't hear him over the rushing of blood in his ears.
'Bucky didn't have a choice. Try to understand that. He wasn't himself, he still isn't.', Steve continues as if Tony hadn't said a word.
'Then at least you would have clarity and a closure.', she disagrees. She has been with him from the very beginning. Actually, the whole team has been behind him from the beginning because Steve had always been far too obvious about his feelings. Everyone had known ages ago that he had fallen hard for their teammate, everyone except for Tony. He seems to be blind for Steve's feelings or he ignores them on purpose, a thought Steve decidedly rejects. Tony would never be cruel, not on purpose.
Nevertheless, the rational part of his brain knows it wasn't his fault, hell, but there is no one else alive whom he can blame. It still feels like Steve chose Bucky over him and that is what hurts the most. Repeatedly Steve had reassured him that he and the kids came first, each time just before they were falling asleep, on opposite sides of the bed now instead of in each others arms.
'Thanks.', he says, appreciating the offer and that she doesn't pry any more on his problems and accept that he won't talk.
He hugs the blond closer to his chest when he starts crying. No Bucky Barnes would ever come between them. No one would for that fact as long as Tony had a say in it.
'It's not his fault.', Steve says, trying to calm him. And Tony can see how torn he is inside. Oh, yes, he can see it. He wants to be there for Tony but at the same time feels responsible for his best friend. It just makes him angrier. It's just the story of his life. There is always someone more important than him.
Tony doesn’t believe in fate or destiny. But if the Red Skull was right, then they exist and they are the sole reason he ever had any part of Steve.
“Captain America, you are talking to a man whose wedding has been ruined and you don’t even offer him food for all the trauma he has suffered this day. Such apathy, from a national icon? I am shocked. I am outraged. I-”
“Wow, Agent Romanoff, you sound like you missed me,” Tony replies, but he hugs her back anyway. He did miss her. After all she is the only avenger shorter than him, not that he’d ever say that out loud. He’s still a little terrified of her.
“I wasn’t sure at first. And then I thought it would hurt you more if you knew. I was just making excuses for myself. Truth is, I was afraid of telling you. And I guess Captain America really was a coward in the end, huh,” Steve replies bitterly.
“Who’s there? We’re not here to hurt you,” Tony says, firing up his repulsors and holding them out just to be safe.
There were many times when Tony had been on the verge of death, but none like this. He remembered the year when he almost died of palladium poisoning. Perhaps that had been a blessing for at least he had been in control. He would have died at home, after saying all his goodbyes and tidying up his life. There would have been a body to bury and a certainty of death. Rhodey and Pepper would have mourned and moved on, never having to convince themselves that he was truly gone, never looking for him because they believed he was alive, never trying to bring him back home, not knowing that they would only bring back a cold body.
“Steve? Hey, look at me.” They shift towards each other, an infinitesimal movement, an involuntary action. “You should have told me, yes. But you don’t have to beat yourself up about it. I could have been better about the Accords and Bucky, too. We both made mistakes, okay? And the thing is, we’ve forgiven each other for them. I forgive you, Steve. I forgive you because I know you’re sorry. And I don’t think there’s any point in getting stuck on the past. So we move on. Together.”
. And if he feels this lost, he can’t imagine how difficult this must be for Tony: Tony, who had nightmares of exactly this happening; Tony, who hated not being in control, who despised working with too many variables and in unknown environments; Tony who had gone completely still beside him.
Yet something seemed off. Tony was wearing a black and white tux, which was extremely uncharacteristic. The Tony Stark Steve knew would come in the Iron Man armour or a painfully bright red tux or at least some kind of god awful bow tie that Pepper would hate. Everything was too quiet, muted somehow. The calm before a storm.
“No, I wasn’t. That’s not even why I was afraid. I was scared that you’d hate me, or leave me. I loved you. I was afraid of losing you. I was afraid because I know you’d have had a good reason to leave.”
“I woke up here, next to you. I’ve seen nothing else of this shithole and I haven’t met anyone either. I woke up barely a few minutes before you did, anyway. I think. I’m not sure how time works here.” He frowns then, and Steve can almost see the gears of his brain turning.
And then three days later, Steve left for DC and came back completely changed. Of course Tony still loved him, but it was difficult to. Steve was obsessed with the search for Bucky now and he always had that shifty look in his eyes, a hesitation that hadn’t been there before. Tony had thought that he’d done something wrong, that he was selfish for being with Steve who could be happier without him. Tony used to wonder why he’d been growing distant. Then Siberia happened and he didn’t have to wonder anymore.
So he willed his shaking leg to calm down. He tried to smile a little brighter. Even if he could never truly be happy for Tony, he wanted Tony to think he was. Tony shouldn’t have to worry about Steve on his wedding day. He watched the wedding, watched Tony and Tiberius look at each other in the eye. He heard the priest ask about objections.
(”You knew,” he’d said. “For two years.” Steve hadn’t really been able to reply. Maybe he had, but Tony can’t remember anything after that. He doesn’t want to remember.)
“Well, it’s the truth. Besides, it is my duty to guide people to the Soul Stone. The bearer of the Soul Stone does not deserve it. My duty now is to lead someone deserving to the Soul Stone, someone who I believe will return it to its rightful place on Vormir.”
“See, for some reason, I don’t really believe you. That sounds a lot like something you’d say to appease our good Captain.”
“Turns out he’d planned this with Hammer, they just messed up timing. It was supposed to be after the official ceremony as a distraction. Turns out Ty Stone actually hated me because of some rivalry between our fathers and he wanted to ruin my company.”
. It’s not like you didn’t disobey them the minute you had to. They weren’t that permanent anyway. We would have-” his voice cuts off, a little thick and full of emotion but a second later, he’s back again and they walk in silence.
For a long time none of them moves. Then Barnes nods once, looking at Tony out of the corner of his eye.
'It doesn't feel like it.', he complains, cutting the engine again. It's never a good idea to drive and fight. Contrary to popular belief, Tony has very good self-preservation instincts. One of them will just start yelling sooner or later.
Still, this arrangement had been made between them in the very beginning of their relationship. No matter how bad the fighting between them gets, they are sleeping in the same bed, no hiding behind a punching bag or Dum-E in the middle of the night. It's just never lasted that long.
With a sigh he answers his phone. 'Hey, I'm just on my way to pick up our kids.', he says as bright as possible, just wanting to hang up again, clearly indicating to Steve that he doesn't wish to speak about yesterday.
'Just stuff.', he says so offhandedly that Steve grows suspicious. He would have to ask Jarvis about this later. He trusts Tony and knows he would never invent something intentionally harmful but that doesn't mean that the machine that would destroy this planet wouldn't be from his hand.
'Jarvis, tell Steve I'll pick up the kids.', he says after having showered downstairs and getting dressed in the spare clothes he keeps down there for situations similar to these. He doesn't want to go upstairs to continue their fight so instead, he heads downstairs to the garage to get one of his cars and drive to Clint's. It wouldn't take longer to call Steve but the truth is, he simply doesn't want to talk to him right now.
'We will do anything for him, Mr Stark.', a nurse says with a soft, comforting smile, putting a hand on Tony's shoulder. Tony nods, still staring in the direction in which Barnes had been carried off. 'Maybe we should get you checked over in the meantime until the doctors know more?', she suggests, gently pushing him in the general direction of a room. Tony nods mechanically, not really taking in what they do to him. Just when the nurse asks him if he could disassemble the suit he comes back to the present and to the events that had unfolded mere hours ago.
Steve doesn't care for their banter. He presses a kiss on the top of Tony's head, breathing in his scent. He doesn't care for anything except that Tony loves him and that he can finally hold him in his arms.
Steve hadn't seen him around yet when he went out with or without the kids or at least hadn't told Tony about it, maybe to not provoke another fight, though Tony doubts it. The blond is looking all over the world for his lost friend and still hadn't found him right outside of his doorway. He wouldn't go through all this trouble with Romanov if he'd knew that Barnes is in New York.
Life goes mostly back to normal after this, even the kids can feel the relieved tension in the air. They watch their parents with barely disguised skepticism during the first days.
Steve takes his hand, uncaring for any looks he might get for being involved with Tony Stark, owner of SI, whom most of his fellow students know as the maker of their phones and tablets. 'Not sure. Still have to go to the library and work on my thesis. Then there is the homework for-'
Natasha stares at him with her mouth open, not believing what she sees right in front of her eyes. 'You can hear us?', she asks, shock and forbidden relief evident in her voice.
'Yeah, but this is lunch. Please?', he asks again, making puppy eyes at Steve, knowing the blond always gives in then. Steve rolls his eyes but it is fond exasperation.
“I’m sorry, what the fuck?” came Clint’s voice behind them. Steve laughed, pulling away, his hand dropping from Tony’s cheekbone to his hand till they were intertwined. He supposed that they had some explaining to do.
He remembered the day when he’d walked into the workshop with some takeout to find Tony fast asleep on the couch. He’d looked at the genius, at the soft eyelashes that dusted slightly grimy cheeks, at the blue veins in his eyelids that shielded eyes which held all the intelligence in the world, at the parted lips that never stopped moving, lips that he suddenly ached to kiss.
“Look, I love Ty but I do value your opinion. If you think I’m doing this wrong or going fast, then I’ll reconsider.”
space. He’s always been at home there, surrounded by holograms and scrap metal. People (usually Pepper and Natasha, or Rhodey when he’s in town) could come by and drop off food, but he wouldn’t notice until hours later, when JARVIS would shut off all his work so that he didn’t have any choice but to eat. He had never been aware of anyone’s presence in his workshop, until Steve. When Steve would come down to draw, Tony could hear every scratch-scratch of pencil against paper, every tap-tap of Steve’s foot against the floor when he was frustrated. Nobody had entered Tony’s space and made it their own like that. Nobody had been welcome enough to. But even now, when Tony is just so angry at him, even when he isn’t welcome, Steve manages to find a way to be the brightest object in Tony’s surroundings, yet again.)
“Cap, I know you’re great at pep talks, but this is way out of my depth. I don’t even have my lab or JARVIS-”
Steve freezes. He knows that voice, could recognise it anywhere. He knows what he’d find behind that hood, now. Gaunt cheekbones, hollow eyes with a manic glint and smooth, crimson-red skin. He tenses up immediately, reaching for his shield before realising that it isn’t there, not that it matters too much. His body is a weapon itself. He readies himself into a defensive pose as Tony glances at him questioningly, but calls the armour to himself all the same.
“Why would someone want to talk to us? Or rather, who?” Tony asks. Steve had been wondering the same thing, but he’d been a little too afraid of Pepper to ask.
“I’m going to fucking kill him,” said Steve, sudden rage coursing through his veins at what Stone had done to Tony.
“No, not for Barnes. I mean, for him too, but not just that. When you woke up, I could have been a lot more…sensitive. I kinda get it now, waking up in an entirely new world. I should have understood and I could have-” he trails off, because Steve is staring at him. They’re still walking, so it’s a little disconcerting. Tony looks away, fixing his eyes on the orange sand in front of him. He is suddenly aware of the fact that he is still in his suit and that it is heavy and uncomfortable. He braces himself for whatever Steve has to say next.
(He’d been sad when he’d woken up, first, all out of place in the new century.Tony had once caught the lines of his face morphing into sorrow when the search for Bucky had met another dead end and he had kissed it away, if only for a night.)
“We met Banner and Thor. And they said they met some others. They’re at the base. Who’s she?” Natasha answers, jerking her head towards Gamora, but Tony knew her well enough to recognise the suspicion in her eyes.
But Tony isn’t like that. Steve clearly doesn’t care about them being soulmates, and that’s fine by Tony, it really is. He just wishes he could do that- the not caring. But he cares. He cares about the fact that out of all the people he’d seen in love, it had been him and Steve who were soulmates, that even after the universe had fought for them to meet, they had screwed it up. And perhaps, this explained things in a way. Steve had never truly loved Tony. It was the soulmate thing, the soulbond or whatever. Clearly he had just felt some kind of pull towards Tony, had never actually fallen in love with him. And now that Steve knew it, there was no way he wouldn’t completely drop Tony and move on. After they saved the world, Steve wouldn’t care about him anymore. It’s ironic how knowing that something you did wasn’t a choice, but fate, gives you the freedom to change your decision.
“Tony,” he says, his voice surprisingly steady, a little deeper than usual as though he had just woken up.
“Alas, the Tesseract did not kill me. It sent me to Vormir, to guard the soul stone, to guide others to a treasure that I cannot possess. And when Thanos snapped, forgetting that the Soul Stone was flawed because of the impurity of his sacrifice, I was brought here, to the Soul Realm, once again as a guide.”
“Yes. We’re the Avengers.” There is a sort of thrill in hearing Natasha say that. Tony sees Steve turn to Natasha, a barely perceptible movement, and smile softly. It had been so long since they’d all been together. There was so much still left unresolved but that confirmation that they are still the Avengers is a form of acceptance. Despite everything, they are always going to be the Avengers, Tony included.
“Hey,” he says softly, taking Steve’s hand. Steve shuddered but leaned into the touch. “What’s wrong, Steve?”
(Except sometimes he did, or at least he had. Steve remembered those moments, moments when Tony would smile at him and call him Steve and Steve would let himself think that he could have had that for longer.
When Steve had woken up after his seventy year slumber, things had been overwhelming, the future had been overwhelming. He’d learnt about the Internet which seemed crazy and unbelievable at first but he’d found his way. Technology hadn’t been very difficult for him. And once he’d started living in the Avengers Tower, surrounded by Tony’s tech which was even more advanced than what normal people were accustomed to, he’d even begun to appreciate that aspect of the future. Of course, the aliens had been a little harder to process, but the fact that everyone seemed to have a hard time processing them was an odd sort of comfort.
Inside meant into a makeshift tent and Steve wonders what material they used to make it. He almost asks, but Pepper’s voice had sounded quite urgent. He remembers that Bruce and Thor would be here somewhere too, and he wants to meet them, but whoever this person is, they must be important. He’s sure that Tony also wants to meet Bruce because the two of them had been close before Banner had taken off.
Steve isn’t sure what to say. Heck, he doesn’t even know whether he can still call her ‘Pepper’ or whether he should say Miss Potts.
“The thing is, for Thanos to get the soul stone, he had to sacrifice the thing he loved the most. I am his daughter. He sacrificed me and got the stone, but he doesn’t love me. Love is supposed to be selfless and I don’t think he’s ever loved anyone selflessly. So even though he got the stone, it didn’t work completely. Instead of killing us, it brought us here- to the Soul Realm.”
“Because spending seventy years on an alien planet is more than enough time to have a change of heart, to rethink my life choices, for I now do not have any remaining.”
Tony taps at his arc reactor and the armour retracts. It’s beautiful, the way it retreats into him, like it’s liquid, or an extension of his own body. Steve watches Tony’s expression open up. It’s nothing he hasn’t seen before, but he hasn’t seen it in a long time. It isn’t even directed at him, but Tony really is beautiful when the lines in his face fade away a little, and the tension in his shoulders lessens.
(He had, when Tony had created Ultron- wait, no, that hadn’t been anger, that had been disappointment. Steve had never been angry at Tony, not really, not truly.)
“I know you’re sorry,” Tony says with a sigh. “So am I. For what I did to Barnes, that is. I get it now, you don’t have to worry about me finding him if he’s here and trying to kill him or whatever.
“I don’t-you don’t have to break things off with him because you feel bad for me. I don’t want to intrude or anything. I didn’t mean to-”
“We need to look within ourselves? What does that even mean?” Steve asks, breaking Tony’s thought process.
“Peter Quill? Calls himself Starlord, loves Footloose for some reason, acts less mature than a 16 year old? And what do you mean we’re not really dead?”
“Forgive me for deceiving you, Captain, but this is an important matter. Do you really think the ones out there would send you in here like this if they had not been convinced that I pose no threat to you?”
“When you called, I picked up immediately because all I wanted to do was hear your voice after so long. Sometimes, I watch your interviews and your speeches just so I know that you’re okay. When I heard heavy breathing, I thought you were injured or sick or dying and I stopped breathing for a second until Bruce spoke. I know we’ve had our differences and I’ve made mistakes but I missed you, Tony. And I truly am sorry for not trusting you. I didn’t want to leave you, not after everything you’d done for me. After New York, in the Avengers Tower, it was the first time I’d felt settled in this century. I respect you, Tony, and I’m sorry that I didn’t make it clear before.” Tony says nothing to that, which is understandable because what can anyone say when someone you hate basically confesses their love for you so once again, they walk in silence.
“I am Gamora, of the Guardians of the Galaxy. You say you know Thor?” Gamora is in a fighting stance, but without weapons drawn. Not that Tony is deceived- he knows that Gamora is more than she seems to be. She seems like she has good reflexes, like she’s quick on her feet.
But the days of constant screaming matches, uncles coming on surprise visits and taking him outside were over. Fights were always resolved in a couple of days at the most, and Peter would always play a part in lighting up the mood. They thought he didn’t notice, that they were successful in hiding it, but he wasn’t a kid anymore. He knew when there were tension, and this day he knew the reason too.
So the next couple of days he spoke to Tony about having a christmas party of sorts, but they should only invite certain people. It was hard because even though Tony agreed, he wanted to invite all sorts of people. Steve knew he had to camouflage the group of successful women they knew who didn’t have their plates completely full in with some other people, but also didn’t want the complete ragers to show up. And tony kept pushing it with this businessman who ”would totally bring his a-game and make the party this year’s most famous” and steve knew it was one from Tony’s past who he could tolerate on a normal day, but not this time.
The doctor smiled knowingly, knowing that Happy wasn’t the only one glad for the change of area. ”I’ll send a nurse over to you with a wheelchair, she’ll help you guys upstairs to pediatrics.”
As Tony returned to the bathroom, Peter had gotten up on his own and was washing his hands. ”C’mere kid, sit on the toilet lid.” Tony was bunching up soft sweatpants for Peter to step into.
I appreciate kudos and comments if you liked it, and I'm also available to talk on my tumblr at the username "lerums".
There was no hair in Peter’s eyes, but Tony knew what he was after. He reached up with his free hand and carded his fingers along Peter’s scalp until the elevator doors opened. Happy rushed forward and took the bag of stuff from Tony, helping them settle into the car before driving off for Lenox Hill.
Tony listened to the two chatting. He smiled. The reason Steve was calling at this time had to be good.
”Papa? Papa, what’s wrong papa?” Peter struggled to sit up between them, and settled on his knees beside Steve. Steve glanced at Tony, who was smiling sadly, but proud at the same time. They had the exact same thoughts at that moment, Steve knew that. ”Yeah kiddo, I just think you’re so strong and brave. Love you.” He said.
Steve was sat on the other end of Peter’s bed, cross legged and focused. He and Peter were engrossed in a comic book each as Tony did some work on his tablet. It was a quiet, but peaceful scene. Steve noticed that Peter was moving, but smiled and looked back down as he was only picking his phone up. Peter had taken to his instagram followers for entertainment the previous night when he was able to look at a screen without his head hurting too bad. Steve thought to himself that was what he was planning to do again. So when he noticed a phone tilted towards himself, then panning over to his husband, he wasn’t surprised.
By the time they had managed to change all of Peter’s clothes, smooth down his hair and wash his face, the boy was physically exhausted, resulting in Steve picking him up to carry to bed.
They had been in the cafeteria for an hour, different workers of all kinds, levels and departments had been by to talk to Peter. Not that it surprised Tony, Pete was very likeable.
Uh…” He stuttered, hitting Tony’s arm for him to pipe up. But Tony was busy laughing, loving it when Peter unintentionally offended Steve. Steve would always understand, he wasn’t stupid, but teasing Peter when he was floundering was hilarious. Before Peter could answer anything comprehensive, Steve was in the shower, leaving the two others on the bed.
”That’s good. Now, how are you feeling today, as opposed to what you told me then?” He leant forward just enough to keep Peter looking at him, but still not getting too close. Tony had always liked dr. Garcia, he was a good match for Peter’s personality and needs.
He saw the range rover they used as a family car on the other side of the road, his fathers standing on the sidewalk in conversation with Julietta’s father. Along with Abe, Ned, MJ and Cindy, Julietta was in Peter’s base group so they did a lot of school work together. Her parents were sending her to the same school as Peter, Midtown high. She lived close to the tower and her mother was in business with Tony, so they had known each other since they were little. Now, they were walking out of school chatting about Friday, both equally as excited.
”Friday, why hasn’t Peter come out of his room yet?” Tony asked, not knowing Peter was about to walk into their master, fluffy blanket wrapped around him, munching on a granola bar. ”Morning dad, papa, I’m better today! I’m not gonna lie, great parenting move on your part last night, I needed that. As you can see, you cured me! My throat doesn’t hurt anymore at all,” Peter said, sitting down on a chair in the corner. Steve and Tony were sitting in bed, enjoying a bit of toast and a cup of coffee. It was on a tray in front of them, Steve was reading the newspaper and Tony had taken out the weekend magazine that followed on saturdays. It always had such great chronics. As Peter gave what sounded mostly like a pep talk for himself, Steve smiled slightly and went into the bathroom. Before Tony could answer their son, he emerged again, holding the thermometer they had taken out the night before, knowing they would need it when Peter tried to sham his way into going out.
”Yeah. Yeah, all right. Right, yeah. Sorry, just writing this down.” His breath was shaking a bit at this point.
”Calm down Buck, it’s one extra day for people to relax. What’s the big deal?” Sam retorted. They were in the elevator on their way to the Stark-Rogers residence. Bucky just shook his head slightly, smiling at his fiancé to show how he wasn’t actually upset.
The soothing hand rubbing his back was enough to make Peter sleepy again, and he sucked in a sharp breath in surprise as Tony made quick process of putting the thermometer in. ”Shh, you’ll be fine, Pete. Just a sec and it’ll be done.”
Peter woke up at his usual two minutes to seven, and immediately felt his back ache. He had slept for about five hours, which Peter thought wasn’t bad, remembering Steve’s mission as he woke. Well, he was clearly not feeling well and Tony never had any pressing matters on fridays. Especially not fridays where Steve had just left for a mission. He brought his blanket that wasn’t actually his favourite, but he knew reminded dad of toddler Peter, and made his way across the hall.
Both Steve and Tony been to the school a week earlier for the security meeting. The same way as Peter’s elementary school, this was was a private school in the middle of Manhattan, so there were security measures. It was also a school used to the “rich and famous” placing their kids there, so the yearly security day right before school started was to lay down a plan for the teenagers’ wellbeing. Steve had been slightly worried before, but as Peter descended the stairs and he saw the guards by the doors, he calmed down a notch.
”Oh. Well, they were doing some wielding before lunch. You’re not visiting a wielding car shop. You’re visiting when they’re pressing numbers onto computers and actually have time to talk to us. But hey, bud, look at the time. We really need to get going, I’ve got that conference call, remember?”
“You be good for dad, alright? Maybe take a shower tonight, actually. Remember you’ve been sweating on and off the entire weekend, and the doctor’s going to come check on you tomorrow.”
Tony rolled his eyes as well, knowing full well that there were other methods of getting a good temperature from the 14 year old. This was, however, one of the things Steve had set his mind into and was stubbornly claiming to be right about. Tony and Peter had both learned to go with the flow and let Steve do his thing. God knows Tony had a few habits of his own that the others just went with. Tony reached over to play with Peters hair as Steve fiddled with the thermometer. ”I know it’s uncomfortable bambino, it’ll just be a few seconds,” Peter’s dad almost cooed at him, trying to calm him. Peter looked up at him and Tony melted. He was uncomfortable and kinda sad, looking at his dad. Those big brown orbs that Tony was convinced had some kind of magic to them. The thing finally beeped, and Steve removed it carefully before reading the result. ”Well Pete, looks like we’re on for a day inside again, your temp is 100.9. Do you want me to make some hot chocolate?” Steve asked.
Tony sent off a text to Steve. ”Hey dearest, Pete’s in bad shape again. Worse than the usual cold. Spoke to dr. Green and got some tips earlier, so I’m gonna take him to the hospital now. He’ll be fine, probably just needs some fluids. Don’t worry too much! We’re bundling up, driving safe. Peter says hi, stay safe!! Love you!!”
After Happy had expressed his relief that nothing too bad had happened to Steve and excused himself to go back downstairs, they settled for hanging around in the kitchen. Peter insisted on having Steve help him with his homework, and Tony scrambled around them pretending to do something effective. He wasn’t about to admit it, but like his son, Tony too felt a strange need to be close for the rest of the day.
They sat that way for several minutes, listening to each others breathing. Dad rubbed his back for a while, gently since Peter’s entire body was sensitive and sore. He saw Steve through hooded eyes, unpacking a paper bag. He didn’t pay attention to what came out before a box was held in front if his face. Peter focused and saw fruit mix from the corner store. He looked over at Steve, and nodded at his papa’s questioning face. He felt dad turn around to see what was going on before raising the mattress to keep Peter sitting up.
Steve climbed off Tony’s suit so it could dismantle. ”Hey, buddy. No, the car slipped on the road, and I ended up in the ditch. I’m fine, I just couldn’t get home on my own. The tow truck was on it’s way already though, so I would have been home in an hour or two.” As Steve spoke, he turned his boy around and they all went inside. It was freezing out, and Peter was still in his shirt from earlier.
And then they were inside. Happy had followed him in, and was brushing Peters shoulders and fixing the minor damage that had been done to his hair. ”There you go. You alright?” Peter nodded. ”Yeah, i just hope it dies down soon,” Happy shrugged. ”Probably will. In the meantime, stay inside these walls today, no funky business going outside for lunch when they’re still like this. I’ll come in and get you when you’re done. 2:30, right?” Peter nodded again, gave Happy a little wave and made his way to Ned’s locker where his best friend was waiting.
Eventually, he needed to get out. His fingers were like raisins. It was almost 7:30, so papa should already be on his way to work. Maybe Peter and Tony could just pretend like nothing, he thought when doing his hair in front of the sink.
A few seconds later, Tony rolled out from the underside of a car. Steve stepped forward to help him up, his husband wasn’t as flexible as he once used to be.
”Tony, you down here?” Steve said into the garage, not actually being sure which car they were in. Friday helped out by telling him they were in the black town car closest to him, and Steve opened the right back door revealing his son and husband. Tony waved slightly as Steve took in the sight for a second. Tony had turned in his seat, back leaning on the other door, his right foot snuck behind his son. Peter looked like he had basically tipped to his left side into Tony’s waiting arms, which Steve strongly suspected was the case. It was the most curious thing, how when Peter slept, he de-aged several years, still looking as adorable as he did when he was a toddler. Steve wasn’t sure because of the weird car lighting, but his sons cheeks looked flushed, and his breath was definitely more labored than usual. ”What’s up with-” ”He’s sick,” Tony interrupted. ”Tought I wouldn’t notice the coughing at the mall, he feels warm too. There’s no way he goes to the movies and risks getting sick before christmas,” Steve agreed, although he dreaded the moment they had to decline his request for a ride to his best friend’s house. He never felt as disliked as when he had to do that.
”Thanks dad. Thanks papa. I’m gonna go shower.” Peter said once they reached the penthouse. ”That’s alright, Squirt. Dinner in forty minues.” Tony replied, already on his way to the kitchen. Steve followed him in. ”Watcha cookin’, good lookin’?”
After finishing up in the dining room, Peter was still not back with the spoon. ”Hey, where are my favourite boys? Not leaving me out of anything, I hope?” Tony half shouted, to be heard over the extractor in the kitchen. He had a suspicion about what was going on, and made his way to the kitchen.
There was ring glittering on Tony’s finger- an engagement ring. It was a silver band with diamonds and it was all wrong, wrong, wrong. Tony was gold and rubies, red and gold, iron man.
The sound of the door must have disturbed the occupants of the room as they both start coming to themselves. Tony rubs his eyes, running his hand through his hair, then he moves his neck slowly, looking for the kinks that had surely found their way into it in that sleep position.
'No, you're not. What are you working on?', Steve asks, trying to sneak a peek at the schematics. Tony is faster than him though and pulls the holographic screen away.
Tony just stares at him, waiting for the inevitable. He knows Steve's next words before he can even utter them. That doesn't take away their sting however.
Tony stops the car next to their shadow. Barnes freezes and doesn't look his way but he doesn't run either so he'll take that as a good sign. At least he had stopped, so he probably recognized the car without directly looking their way. He winds down the car window.
Tony lies on his left side in the king-size bed in the penthouse of the Tower. He opens his eyes, giving up on falling asleep like this. It won't work anyway.
'Nah, I can't sleep anyway. And I can think better when some mindless creature listens to me when I am brilliant. That's what I've got Dum-E for but you will do well, too.', Tony assures him as he settles in the chair, getting ready to stay till near morning.
Tony nods. He is rather surprised like he can't understand any of this yet. 'Why didn't you say anything?', he asks softly, looking him over again and again.
Steve isn't fooled by their relationship though. They meet every day at least once, either for lunch or for dinner, depending on Tony's schedule. More often than not Steve wanders downstairs to Tony's lab somewhen during the course of the day where he sketches and watches Tony work, laughing and joking with the genius while Tony works too much for the team and for his company. Tony likes him to be around, says he works better when someone else than Jarvis listens to his rambling. Being around Tony is like an addiction. Steve knows the more he takes now, the more it is going to hurt when the inevitable happens, and that is Tony finding a partner. But he can't stay away, can't bring himself to not make Tony as happy as he can. Even if he is doomed to later suffer the consequences.
Bruce sighs deeply, fiddling with his glasses. 'Apart from some fractured rips and a broken leg he's deaf and will be for the rest of his life. The explosion destroyed his eardrum and more. There is too much damage to patch it.', he says in a low voice. Steve looks back at Clint who still is unconscious when they cart him out of the recovery room. Damn.
Natasha is frozen, must be under shock. Bruce had already draped his jacket over her shoulders when the doctors carry her boyfriend to the ambulance to get him into the hospital as well. There's nothing they could do for him here, the paramedics didn't even tell them how bad it is. Steve calls Clint's brother Barney as soon as the ambulance drives off.
'In love with you.', Steve finishes the sentence for his friend. 'And you feel the same.', he concludes, still grinning like a Cheshire Cat.
When Steve climbs into Tasha's car alone, she raises an eyebrow but doesn't say a thing about Tony's absence. She must have already counted on it. Steve knows what exactly she thinks about his relationship with Tony. They pick up Thor on the way who isn't so quiet about the missing of the genius.
'Okay, see you later, honey.', Steve says, a little downcast. He had hoped to have Tony at his side. It's been a week since the accident and the group is taking it pretty hard. The hospital had already organized someone to teach Clint and his family the basics of sign language. It's frustrating to see the usually so happy Clint struggling.
There is a short silence on the other end, then Natasha apparently snatches the mic from Clint and says, 'This is an attempt to save our team and friendship.'
'Thought so.', he mutters, turning back to his team. 'So, yeah, no radio, nothing to call anyone. I knew you must be looking for us by then but that didn't mean you'd be looking for us in the right place or that you could win against them. It was obviously a trap designed to capture or kill one Avenger or two. I dragged Barnes along. They caught up. There was a skirmish in the hallway. I don't know what exactly happened. Barnes pulled me down to the floor, then everything was on fire. I know some seconds are missing there, that's maybe when I got hit on the head. It's a concussion, I have no recollection of where I got it. It must have been there and then. I could feel the heat through the suit, especially where it was torn. Maybe I hit something, maybe they did. I could hear explosions ringing in my ears. People were screaming. I managed to get a hold on Barnes and get us out of the building before it blew. We got hit by the debris. My suit was down and the only info Jarvis could give me about Barnes is that I could do nothing. His injuries were too extensive. He told me of this hospital. It took me way too long to find a transport vehicle they left behind. My suit refused to work and time was ticking by.' Here Tony stops and refuses to go on. They all know that in the time he spent looking how to get them out of there Bucky stopped breathing.
'Nah, you just gave Clint the ability to hear. Nothing special about that. He barely noticed the difference.', Steve scoffs. How can Tony just think so little of his own work? Steve knows that Tony does more good in this world than he would ever admit and than most people would ever see. He just wants the world to see Tony for who he really is and not judge him by his snarky behavior or his pompous words. He wants them to just once see the Tony Stark Steve sees when he looks at him. The person who would spend six nights holed up in his lab for a person he claims to find annoying and stupid.
Tony nods. The relief he had hoped for doesn't come. His heart breaks and he doesn't even know why. His parents had died more than twenty years ago, it's not as if he is still grieving.
He can't speak about it, not to Steve. This is strange since it's a first about what they can't talk about it.
'No, Sir. The memory of the Mark 52 has been compromised. I can try to piece some of the information together but I am afraid it will not be complete.', the AI informs his master. 'I have footage of everything up to the moment in which you crossed the veil.'
'We couldn't continue watching you oblivious fools.', Clint says somewhere behind them. Steve whips around surprised to find him and Natasha standing in the doorway, both a very pleased smile on their faces. Tony  glares at Clint from Steve's side.
Half an hour later they are back on the street but not before thanking Laura and Clint for watching the kids for the night. He wouldn't have had a mind for watching them last night.
Steve's only reason for not having made a move yet to end their fight, is that he wants to grant Tony the space he needs. And he thinks Tony needs a lot more space than the inventor is comfortable with. First Tony had appreciated it but it's not what he needs anymore.
'What is that?' Natasha points at his arm where a big bruise had began to spread. It has the shape of a hand. Surprised Tony looks at it.
'Off.' Steve nods, then slips under the covers as well and Jarvis turns off the lights in the room. 'Do you hate me?', Tony asks because he has to know, he has to hear it from his lover's mouth.
Natasha puts a hand on Tony's shoulder, startling the man. 'You've done everything you could. It's not your fault.' Tony nods, not really taking in her words. He must look broken if even Romanov tries to cheer him up. Probably they all think of his selfdestructive behavior in the past and of the blame he always places on himself.
No, but it is just like Tony to hide in his workshop until it all had blown over, Steve thinks sadly. He hates seeing someone else getting hurt but he doesn't know how to deal with these emotions. That is just like Tony to distract himself with a gadget until the unchangeable fact that Clint would be deaf would not be so crushing anymore.
Tony waves it off. 'As I said, it's just a prototype, I still need to calibrate it to your hearing. If you give me some more data, I can do better and we can maybe talk about an implant or if you're up for something that permanent.', he says, preparing the tests that would need to be done.
'Because you have been hoping for months now and nothing has happened.', Natasha reminds him, something Steve grudgingly has to admit. 'Then you can finally get over this and move on.' He knows that Natasha isn't the biggest fan of Tony Stark but she is right, even Steve's love-addled mind has to admit that. He hates lying to his best friend. Maybe saying the truth wouldn't be so bad.
Tony can't keep his smile inside, a grin threatens to overtake his face at all times. James eyes them strangely, Maria merely munches happily on her breakfast, glad that everything in her universe seems to be in order again. A few months later their fight would be almost forgotten if it wouldn't be for a small detail.
'And why would I care?' Tony tries to sound as indifferent as possible, not even looking up again as he turns his attention back to his project. He ignores the sting Clint's words have. There is no reason for Steve to visit him every day and be around him all the time. Why should Tony be sad about that?
Steve stays silent for some moments as if contemplating if he should hug Tony or not. 'This afternoon. I wanted to find everything there is before calling you.', he explains, his voice smaller than before. He is afraid of Tony's reaction and he might be right to be.
Tony spins around, that infuriating archer already half forgotten. 'Something like that.', he says, distracted as he is by Steve's tight shirt and his gorgeous smile. It should be illegal to be that hot and adorable at the same time. '
'Yeah, dunderhead. That's good. Means they are working. I can do better than that but I thought you rather prefer crappy hearing than no hearing. No telling how much of my brilliancy you would miss when you can't hear me talking anymore. We can't have that now, can we?', he wants to know, making notes on the tablet. '
Clint snorts and rolls his eyes. 'Yeah. Says the guy who didn't get that Mr Applepie Obvious is in love with him.'
He rolls his eyes. 'What's so terrible about inviting him out? Just tell him you'd like a date or just drag him to your room and get to it.' Clint wriggles his eyebrows suggestively.
'He murdered my parents. How can you defend that?' Tony is surprised that he is not yelling. His voice is seeping with rage though. Steve flinches slightly. He jumps up from his seat because he can't look at Steve any moment longer. His hands curl into fists. He shakes with fury as he starts pacing.
He shakes his head, forcing his voice to stay quiet. 'I gotta go now, kids won't pick themselves up.' Tony hangs up on him a second later, hitting his hands against the steering wheel in frustration. Damn him.
Steve had noticed how he slipped the tablet from Clint's bed. Tasha shakes her head. 'Is this your work?', she wants to know, mistrusting Tony as always.
'So what? They are my friends, you're my boyfriend. I would like you to get along.' That is wishful thinking as they both know. Tony doesn't play well with others, that Bruce and Thor like him is miracle enough. After four years of Clint and Tony knowing each other through Steve they didn't have one civil conversation as far as Steve knows. They always fought and bickered, called each other names and played pranks on one another, so it's no big surprise when Tony doesn't even deign that with an answer.
He sits on a bench but doesn't come any closer. It's better like this. One of the other parents might get a fit and call the police to arrest him as a threat for their children.
'Do you trust me?', he asks instead, caressing Tony's cheek, coaxing the genius to relax. The brunet nods. 'Then I don't ask for more.'
Steve nods. With a smile Tony turns back to his work while Steve goes upstairs, cursing his own cowardice once more.
'He, he isn't breathing. I already tried CPR but he wouldn't react.', Tony says, trying to remain calm and ignore the side of the screen which shows that Jarvis can't detect a heartbeat. Somewhere they get a stretcher from and Tony carefully puts Bucky on it.
Anger wells up in Tony, anger about finding out, anger at his father for ever creating that stupid serum, anger at Steve for telling him this horrible truth. Anger at Barnes for killing his mother. The last one is burning with an intensity Tony isn't used to. For more than twenty years he had believed a tragic accident took his beloved mother from him, now it turns out it was Steve's bestie. This is just fantastic. How the ever-loving hell can this be his life?
'You could always just tell him what you feel, you know?' Clint walks closer, picking up some tools. Tony doesn't bother tell him to leave them be because he's afraid what else he might say in the process.
Steve feels sorry for Clint when he knows he shouldn't. The hobby archer doesn't need pity, he needs support in this situation. Thor and Steve leave Clint and Tasha alone for a while soon after that, getting a coffee. Steve feels helpless and wishes Tony would be at his side. That's not something Tony can do though. So they wait in comfortable silence for Tasha who is just as distressed about the situation as Clint is.
With a sigh Tony lets go of the blanket around which he had curled (a very insufficient replacement of his super soldier) and turns around to his husband. Steve turns his head to see if he would get up like he had so many of the past nights but Tony doesn't think of going down to the lab to spend his night with Dum-E and Jarvis. They are not whom he wants.
'Don't go, please.', Tony answers just as quietly, walking around the bed to his side. He had taken some pain killers but his head starts hurting nonetheless. Being alone is not what he wants right now. The bed is already warm, Tony needs to repress a shudder.
The elevator dings, making Tony look at it in surprise. Steve steps out with his sketchbook under his arm. He can't see them yet from the hallway. Shocked Tony glances back at Clint who hadn't needed that long to know who arrived.
'I should have known better and stopped him.' Tony shakes his head. 'I'm sorry.', he says, getting back on track. Somehow talking helped. 'We continued to search the forest. There have been clear signs of human activity in the area which just solidified our suspicions. It could have been nothing, it could have been a big threat. We didn't know, so we just went on, looking for clues and hints. Barnes found some footprints and other signs that someone had been there not too long ago. He motioned me to follow him and we sneaked closer to a hill right in front of us. We were pretty high up by then, far away from civilization, a remote location if I've ever seen one.'
Tony raises a hand to shut him up. He can't take Steve's defense speech anymore. It's so typical of Steve to try to make Tony see sense even in a situation like this. 'But he did. He killed them. Don't even try to deny that.', he hisses, glaring at Steve. He is supposed to be on Tony's side. Not that there is much choice on which side anyone should be. Who would ever be on the side of a notorious mass murderer? Answer: Steven Grant Rogers, if just a part of him believed that an injustice had been done to said notorious mass murderer.
'Bucky..', Tony rasps, his voice hoarse from everything behind him. He can barely look at his boyfriend who crouches down in front of him.
His super soldier hearing must have picked up on that. 'Tony, please come up so we can talk about this.'
'Oh, Stella, what have you got for me today?', Clint asks with a wide grin, his eyes already fixed on the deliciously smelling food when it's their turn to order. Steve can't help but smile at his enthusiasm. Clint had been crazy about Stella's food ever since they first ate here in their first year of college. Now that Steve is in his last, they still regularly eat here, if just for Clint.
Tony takes the folder, not taking his eyes off Steve for a second. When the blond indicates him to open it, Tony finally breaks eye contact and looks at the blinding white paper in front of him. It's a mission Hydra had assigned to their best asset, the Winter Soldier. Curiosity gets the better of him as to why Steve thought he would have to see this for himself, so he opens it. The typewriter font has started to fade but every word is still readable, it's a bad photocopy of the original. Tony skims the text. It's a translation of the original record, one Hydra had made probably after the information had reached the States. It's talking about two targets and a cargo that would need to be extracted. At the end it only reads that the mission was a success. There are no specifics, no details, nothing that would give Tony any hint why this is more important than any other mission of the Winter Soldier. Just two seemingly random murders.
That's how it comes that Steve now sits in the common living room and sketches, waiting for it to be time to go downstairs again and pretend that his life doesn't revolve around Tony. Meanwhile, he draws to distract himself. A comedy plays on the TV, Steve's day's attempt to catch up with modern culture.
Clint gets up when Steve places his bag next to the table so they could get their lunch. He had waited on Steve as usual.
Further Tony doesn't get because Steve has pulled him into his arms and has his lips pressed to Tony's in an instance. The genius freezes for a moment, then kisses Steve back with vigor.
'And?' Clint nearly bounces with excitement when Natasha returns from her reconnaissance mission down in Tony's lab. The inventor had revoked Clint's access to Jarvis's system ages ago, apparently because the archer had misused the video system for his pranks. It's really ridiculous. If Tony doesn't want to be pranked, he shouldn't make the entrance to the air duct system so easy.
Tony swallows hard, turning around abruptly to face his friend. 'Steve, I..' He hesitates when he sees Steve's hopeful expression. Okay, maybe he does chicken out. He can't risk this. Having this friendship is better than spending day after day alone in his lab. So what if it breaks Tony's heart? He can love from afar. It's better for both of them. Someone as young and perfect as Steve doesn't need or want a burden like Tony in his life as more than a temporary friend. 'I want to get back at Barton for some prank. You interested?', he asks instead, putting on his best grin.
Tony breathes a sigh of relief, turning around to face his husband completely again. The relief is very short lived. The blond looks tense so Tony's quip stays where it is. He is worried, that much is evident. As if his life depends on the information he is about to give Tony. The brunet swallows, all thoughts of food forgotten. 'What is it?', he wants to know, coming to stand closer to Steve, touching his arm lightly. He doesn't care about the insecurity that seeps into his voice. If he can't be vulnerable around his husband, then where can he?
The brunet is hiding at the back of his shop though that could have been unintentional. He is hunched over a workbench, sliding up his dark welding goggles when Steve nears. 'What's up?'
Steve relaxes fully into the pose, pressing a kiss to Tony's temple, a silent thank you. A smile forms on the inventor's face. The silence hangs in the room for a long time because none of them wants to break this connection.
Fortunately Steve doesn't ask any more questions, he is already familiar with Tony's antics. And wow, Tony hadn't thought anyone would ever keep up with all his shit but apparently Steve is, if just for the sake of the team, or maybe the blond really wants to be friends after all.
He closes his eyes, enjoying the warmth and solidity of Steve next to him. 'I know.', Tony whispers.
The inventor shakes his head, waving the concern off. 'I'm fine.' Steve looks like he highly doubts that. There is a timid knock on the door, then a doctor enters, interrupting the questioning for a moment. Steve raises to stand.
'Actions speak louder than words, and Stark's words are already yelling. He hasn't visited Clint once except that first time you dragged him there. He doesn't care. Just because he says he'd pay the hospital bills doesn't make him a decent person.', Tasha says darkly. Tony had offered to take care of the bills because he knew that neither Clint nor his brother Barney would be able to pay them.
They settled for watching some new show on Netflix that they had talked about starting, falling into a comfortable silence, Peter even forgetting to be angry as he leaned into his papa’s side, his feet in Tony’s lap.
”Do you want to try and sleep a little? We’ll be right across the hall, so you can just press the button if you need anything.” Tony said, once they had gotten Peter settled in the newly made bed, courtesy of Steve. ”All right. I’m pretty tired. See you guys later.”
It felt good being taken care of like that. He had been in hospital many times throughout his childhood. At home he was cuddly and relied a lot on touch like his fathers, but was still adamant on doing things himself and not relying too much on the help from his dads. But there had been times in hospital where he didn’t really have a choice, and preferred dad and papa to help him instead of nurses. Because of that, hospital became an exception to his own rule. If he felt the need for help to anything and everything, he accepted what was offered. There were never anyone else visiting unless Peter felt like it anyway, just the three of them.
First, though, he knew the doctor always liked them to monitor his fever. It was only two hours since they had measured again, before going down to breakfast, but Tony was always on the safe side before calling dr. Green.
All in all, they were in and out of the penthouse in seven minutes. Thank god for cleaning ladies keeping the clothing pressed and ready to go.
Peter huffed a quiet laugh, but continued to make himself comfortable. He straightened Tony’s arm out to rest his head on. That’s when his father’s brows furrowed, quickly followed by a small smile. ”Oh, but this isn’t my mattress-stealing husband, is it? Must be an intruder. Go away, intruder! Oh, where is cap when you need him?” Tony was still mumbling slightly into his pillow, eyes still closed. Peter draped his blanket over himself, sitting back up again making him slightly dizzy. Yep, something had definitely broken through his weak ass immune defence.
“Agreed on what, Steve? To deny him of everything good in life only because it can be misinterpreted as abuse of power?”
“Come upstairs and get ready for dinner when you’re ready for him not to notice anything. We’re going to that new place. If you want to join us, that is.”
Pete knew what she was referring to, and after talking to doctor Pont while in the clinic, Peter had realized that his fathers were probably right with what they were saying. He had probably been dealing with ADHD his whole life. This wasn’t the first meeting they had about how to deal. ”Yeah, but it’s gonna be better now, I promise.” He told her.
Peter groaned, throwing his head back. “But why can’t we just call them and say who we are? They’ll give us a table in no time, you know it!”
Peter looked at sadly at his dad who had climbed onto the bed again. ”I’m sorry, Pete. The ear thing isn’t working anymore, and this really is the easiest way to get the correct reading. Jesus, Pete, stop it with the looks. Papa just left, I still miss him too much to give into your tricks.”
”Tones… Tones… Tones… Anthony!” James finally got his friends attention, shutting him up. He was grinning. They were all squirming so much, it was honestly hilarious once he understood that nothing serious had happened. ”My god, you guys… It’s fine, Tones, I’ll talk to him. See if we can resolve things once we get back.” They hung up right before Peter came back.
A couple of minutes later, Tony took hold of Peter again, leading him over to a free bed. Aware that they were attracting looks, Happy placed himself between Peter and the other patients. No one were taking pictures right now, but it wouldn’t have been the first time someone tried that. Which was why Happy was shooting glares at everyone even glancing in their direction. Peter was priority number one at all times, a rule set by both the Stark-Rogers men and Happy’s own gut. The boy was vulnerable in some areas of his life and resilient in others, but Happy’s goal was that Peter shouldn’t need to worry about that at all, at least until he was older.
I appreciate kudos and comments if you liked it, and I'm also available to talk on my tumblr at the username "lerums".
”Tony. I know you guys by now. You’re fully capable to deal with this alone. Listen to your gut, that’s your dad talent speaking. Peter will be fine, like he always is. Do you hear me?”
”Tell me what you’re thinking of, Pete.” Happy had just left to go home, and it was only the two of them left. His dad was helping him out of sweatpants and hoodie, and into the hospital shirt. It was eight in the evening, and Peter would be spending all his time under the covers.
Once he had called downstairs to the coffee shop, making them have a bag of light sandwiches ready for when he left, he gathered the items on his list. Warm socks for Peter. Peter’s blanket and his tablet. 3 chargers. Tony’s tablet and glasses. Warm socks for tony. Clothes for kid: Three sweatpants, three t-shirts, zip up hoodie, five pairs of boxers and a couple of pairs of socks. Food for dads.
Peter was buzzing. He’d totally forgotten about the new year’s ball that was taking place on friday, but they had started handing out tickets at lunch that day. According to the teachers, dates weren’t allowed, everyone was to go as friends and classmates. (since this wasn’t high school prom, it was the nicer middle school version where the tickets were free and everyone was to be included)
”Peter Benjamin, look at me. Please.” Papa said, reaching out across the table to place a hand on Peter’s crossed arms. Peter looked up, slightly embarrassed to have teared up over the whole ordeal. ”We’re not mad at you, but you need to talk to us. We know you better than anyone and that makes us able to guess what happened back there, but you need to talk about this.” Steve tried. ”Please explain to us what was going on in that big brain of yours. Remember what doctor Pont gave you as your assignment. Talk to us, Squirt, we
”Then my turn!” Came from the bed, when they didn’t break apart from the embrace right away. Steve smiled and let go. ”Then baby boy’s turn. How are you, sugar?” Tony sat back down in his chair as Steve rested on the bed. Tony could see the excitement of having his papa back was wearing off, and Peter’s eyes went back to that slightly pained but otherwise empty look.
After showering, cooking himself breakfast and packing up some more stuff that could occupy Peter if he was getting bored, Tony left. On his way, he stopped at the closest corner store where they always sold what Peter thought was the best diced fruit in the world. He supposed he’d have to ask a nurse on his way in if Peter could have it so close to lunch, but he had a suspicion the boy hadn’t eaten a lot for breakfast so it would be fine.
”Steve! Honey! Wait up! Oh my god. I can’t believe this is happening. You’re going to bed. To wake up. Aren’t you? Not a dream, sweetie,” Tony said, between giggles, gasps and coughs. ”This has to be about that book you were reading. It is, right? I’m always telling you books aren’t good for the soul, now look who’s right. Lucky for you I saw it and fell into your sinful behaviour. Been listening to the soundbook version down here the past week.” And so, Tony started explaining.
And as on cue, Flash arrived as soon as he’d greted Ned. ”Think you can get some more attention to yourself by flashing an ugly flag? That’s disgusting, Parker.” And yeah, that was a thing too. A couple of years back someone had leaked Peter’s mothers name to the press. A a few secrets had come out, his old last name among them in addition to her rough story. It was flashes way of telling Peter he was no better than his druggie mother. ”Thanks for the support, Flash.” Peter mumbled, busy opening his own locker. He didn’t really care what people thought of his past. He knew his mother han many issues preventing her from doing good, and he also knew she handled things the wrong way, especially having a child. All in all, he was just thankful she’d put his dad’s name on the birth certificate.
It was three thirty, and Tony’s last three hours had gone by in a blur. They had settled on the bed again, where Peter had been half sleeping the whole time. Tony had a glass filled with water and a straw ready for every time the boy opened his eyes, but he would only take small sips now and then. Tony knew this wasn’t going in the right direction. ”Dammit,” he cursed to himself.
Tony woke up bright and early as he always did sundays. It was usually to prepare some food before putting the slow-cooking roast in the oven, but sunday family dinner was obviously canceled that day. He decided to skip right to tidying the apartment anyway. The dishwasher was emptied, shoes in the hallway carried to closets, nicknacks returned to their usual spots. Rhodey’s dvds were placed by the elevator to be picked up or delivered. The place was so empty Tony found it a bit creepy, so after organizing Peter’s pile of comic books and selecting a couple of new ones to bring to the hospital, he went to the gym.
Peter couldn’t think anything else before he saw papa emerging from the bathroom. ”Hi bud, I thought you were asleep!” Peter rubbed a hand over his face. ”Was”
want to act? I’ve explained this to you multiple times, Steve, but all you seem to focus on is that all the values I bring to the table for Peter are the bad ones. The ones that we’re ashamed of, that we need to bury. You’re not perfect yourself, you know,”
Peter heard the door opening, but he was slumbering and looking at the sky outside, so he didn’t bother to acknowledge the nurse who was putting a hand on his arm. A rough skinned but gentle hand that moved up to push his hair away from his face. Then a dip in the bed beside him. Wait… Dad?
”Mr. Rogers! Long time, no see, right?” Steve held the doors open to the owner of the voice, a doctor who had worked in the pediatric ward for as long as Steve could remember. ”Hey, dr. Garcia. Yeah, it’s been over a year this time. He’s just gotten his ADHD diagnose, though. That’s what we spent out christmas break on.” The doctor nodded. He probably already knew since there was only two doctors on call the weekend, he had to have read Peter’s file.
Oh god. Oh god, oh god, oh god. ”Peter sir, would you like me to call Happy Hogan for you and explain the situation?” ”Yes, please, oh god, Friday what’s going on?”
Steve walked through the doors of the hospital that lead him to the elevators. He knew the place all to well, but he had stopped thinking such thoughts years back. Peter was going to be fine, Steve knew that. It would never be a delightful experience to be in hospital for either of them, but a routine had formed that made things a little easier.
Tony was breathing heavily, hands clenched at his side as he pulled further back. Steve was frozen in place by the car. What the hell was this? They’d had countless conversations about the people they used to surround themselves with over the years. And they mostly agreed that they were good people, but there were a few traits were arrogant and not very charming.
Steve couldn’t believe his eyes or ears. Was Tony really this careless? It was Peter they were talking about. The wellbeing of their most cherished possession, and Tony was clutching his stomach, holding onto Steve's shoulder so he wouldn’t fall? This was the worst thing he had ever experienced. It had to be some horrible nightmare, Tony was usually so adamant about Peter having everything he needed. That’s why Steve went to do what he normally does when situations turn out to be dreams. He turns around and walks away, returning to his bed so he can wake up.
While Steve was talking, Peter had started eating again, and so did Tony. Peter looked thoughtful, so neither father said anything to him. Through the rest of the meal, they exchanged details about their day with eachother, allowing Peter to eat and think in peace but also opening up for him to butt in if he wanted to. When they finished, Steve took their plates and cleaned up. Peter was still sitting down, now playing with Tony’s hand on the table.
Bucky let out a grunt. ”I don’t know. I looked it up and there’s quite a lot of violence in there. You know you’re easily affected by that kind of thing, champ” Peter sighed. Some time ago he’d seen a terrible documentary about beheadings and had nightmares for a couple of weeks after. It had been at a weekend he spent with Bucky and Sam and the first night after he had been terrified and didn’t dare to wake any of his uncles. Bucky had been emotionally scarred too, but by the wrath of superhusbands. After that he had read a lot about sleep and mental health in general for teenagers, and gone a bit overboard at that. Now he was constantly reminding Peter about taking care of himself and watching out for triggers that could potentially make any kind of impact on the boy.
Out in the hallway, Tony grabbed Steve’s hand as they strolled towards the exit. “You’re making sure he showers, right?”
Tony snorted, patting Steve’s hand. “Let me finish, love. I know you do, I just… You know how this works, when my thoughts spiral I create these images of our family being torn apart, just like it almost did,”
”Papa, you made these?” Steve looked offended. ”Well, yeah, why are you so surprised?” He said, getting up to start the day before he got too caught up in conversation. It wouldn’t have been the first time.
Peter heard his uncle loud and clear, but it didn’t stop the first tear to emerge. Or the second. Soon enough, he could feel himself shaking while Happy lead them into the living room, settling right next to Peter on the couch. Fifteen minutes later, FRIDAY let them know that both men would be home within ten minutes.
Peter could barely keep his hands to himself. His dad had ditched lab time to take a tour through the R&D department, giving Peter an update on all the stuff SI was working on at the moment. They had been talking to a couple of engineers about the entire field of renewable energy for over two hours, which had been thrilling to say the least. Peter knew his papa usually knew about anything SI did, but this was a project Steve didn’t even know much about. Peter was one of very few people in the world who knew about the new line of energy sources SI was releasing in a little less than three years. Now, they were looking at the next Stark Phone, complete with lots of the improvements including a few Peter had suggested.
”There you are, Peter! Hi bud, how was the first day back?” Steve shouted across the entrance hall, making people turn and look, first at Steve then at Peter. Steve was waving eagerly with some papers. Peter shrunk a bit and started walking towards, then past his papa. ”Oh my god pops, will you stop being so embarassing? I literally saw you four hours ago. It was fine.” Peter huffed, not waiting for a response before he started walking towards Steve’s office. ”I’m gonna go back to the tower then, Tony needs me there in a bit. See you, Pete” he heard Happy say from the doors.
As soon as Peter walked into the office knowing Steve was a few feet behind, he stomped across the floor and plopped down on a couch. ”
”I’m so full of ice cream you guys have to either roll me upstairs or let me sleep right here.” Pete said, leaning down so he was on his side with his head in Tony’s lap. Steve took his feet and put them on his lap.
Steve knocked carefully, taking the grunt he got in return as permission to enter. Peter was by his desk, doing something on his computer. ”You know pops, you guys don’t have to come in here every night. Friday is monitoring my every move, I’d go to bed about now either way. I’d brush my teeth and everything, pinky promise!” Peter ended his complaint in a fake childish voice.
”Peter honey, look at me,” Steve said, placing hands on each side of his son’s face so he was standing still. ”Go to the bathroom and get changed, we’ll head down to the gym for a while. Any other problem can be solved later on,
Sam and Peter was in the car on their way back to the tower. The two of them didn’t really spend a lot of one-on-one time together. Bucky was one of Peters godfathers, and Sam was engaged to Bucky. He had entered their lives several years ago and Peter couldn’t remember a time he didn’t know Sam, but Bucky would always be the natural choice for babysitting and such. That didn’t mean Peter wasn’t comfortable with Sam, though. Although he never officially quit, Sam rarely went on missions as falcon anymore. He was a peoples person by heart and his daytime gig was once again at the VA as a counsellor.
By the way, did I notice this entire series will probably never have anything resembling a cliffhanger? I write every chapter as kind of oneshots, and gather them in bulks when they fit together. Every now and then, though, I will include hints or start building up to something coming up a couple of works in the future.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony. “Yeah, he was really bummed out that we couldn’t just use our name to get a table at Harry,” Tony rolled his eyes slightly, and Steve felt a string being plucked at the irritated gesture. “Tony, he’s so impressionable now. Especially in a new school, with new people. I know you did a couple of pretty spectacular dinner spots last week when I was gone. I thought we agreed on this?”
Steve quieted down, but fastened his grip on Tony as they closed in on the tower. ”Is Peter okay?” Tony tried remembering what had been said and done before he had left, and realized he had forgotten to limit Friday’s information flow to him. All Peter knew was that his papa had been in a car accident.
“Yeah, I mean, it’s just those stupid thoughts coming back. Like, when you say stuff like that all I hear is you not liking me, and-”
Peter sighed. ”But dad, I thought the medication was supposed to be helping? Why am I still like this?” The boy laid his fork down, placing his face in his hands.
Tony’s eyes softened. ”Hey. I know that look. Whatever is going on inside that head of yours, please share it. You know we talked about this when we still went to that therapist. Joys double in size when shared, and worries gets split in two.”
Bucky had seen Steve leaving work early to hang out with Peter, and told him he’d see him later. He hadn’t heard anything else. He had picked Sam up on his way back from work, and they’d gone straight to the tower. ”Snow day my ass. If people only knew how to drive safely, this would be no issue. You know there are loads of western countries that don’t have anything resembling snow days, right?” Bucky complained. Sam had gotten the day off like so many others, and frankly, Bucky didn’t see the point.
of needles. More like a strong dislike because of the discomfort they brought. A strong dislike that made his palms sweaty and his body shivering.
They had watched a movie and played video games after eating, and it was currently 10 pm. Peter had went to bed half an hour earlier, and Rhodey had heard him call his fathers right after. Which was probably why they thought Peter was asleep already, and was now at the door with Peter’s clothes.
They quickly stopped for a picture, a girl had spotted then going between stores. People wanting a picture with them happened from time to time, but more often when they were alone ever since Tony had gotten mad at paparazzi for ruining ther family time together.
The doctor nodded along. ”Ah, well, teenage boys, am i right?” Steve laughed. ”Yeah, I guess. Hey, are you going up to the ward now?”
”What do you think the issue is here? Did you get to think that over?” Steve wondered, changing back into casual clothing in the middle of the kitchen. ”Oi. No nudity while I’m cooking!” Tony said, swatting at Steve with the kitchen towel.
Steve reised his eyebrows questioningly, expecting a better answer. Tony scoffed. ”Hey, i thought we discussed talking to eachother about our issues? Or was that a dream, where you opened up over dinner and we were able to help you and you could relax?”
”Steve, what happened, are you okay?” Bucky wondered, trailing over to the island right away. Steve put up his hands, as if to push away potential prodding fingers and investigative eyes.
”Nothing special, just hung out, made hot chocolate,” Peter said, voice slightly muffled in his papas shirt. He had to admit he wasn’t feeling well and knew his father could tell. A quiet night in sounded perfect, even though he had spent the whole afternoon on another couch. Peter sighed, feeling how his head pounded weakly and shuddered.
Nurses came in occasionally checking on Peter. They had tried a bit of breakfast, but Peter’s throat hurt even swallowing his own spit, let alone food. He hadn’t gotten much down, despite his papa helping and motivating the best he could. And Peter was coughing now, deep coughs racketing through his whole body, hurting so badly but he wasn’t able to stop them from coming.
Steve decided to pick up the phone, he knew Peter would be alone at the penthouse as the time was 9:30.
”You sick, Pete? Should I be keeping my distance? I wanna come to Sunday dinner tomorrow, not lie in bed,” Sam teased, shielding his mouth while backing away. After earning a slight glare from Peter, he lead the way to the living room. Usually they wouldn’t be coming around on saturdays since sundays were family days, but since Peter had started his christmas holidays they were taking advantage of the relaxed vibe in the penthouse.
”Hey, Petey-pie? I want you to take some tylenol, think you can do that?” He almost cooed at his teenager. The usually energetic kid was slumped across the couch, not bothering to cover his bare foot with the blanket. ”No, nothing? How about some water? It’ll soothe your throat?” Peter shook his head weakly. His eyes were glazed and half closed. Yeah, Tony was getting worried. This was way worse than the usual cold. He decided to call dr. Green and hear her thoughts on the matter.
About how he was worried Tony would think that steve saw him as a bad dad, and how he read about teenager psych, about his plan to get Peter what he needed to live a good life. And Tony laughed a little.
Tony winced. He hated grumpy “end calls”. Luckily, sour Peter never lasted long so he’d be fine by the time he got back upstairs. ”Sorry about that, gentlemen. Kid struggles a bit with concentration. Where were we?”
”Hey, Pete! Look who’s calling, it’s papa!” Tony exclaimed, startling Peter. It was almost ten, and Peter had been trying to get some food down. Tony had fed him a couple of pieces, but Peter had to reload his energy to want to chew more. Dad answered the call and put him on speaker right away.
He was grabbed protectively around the shoulder as soon as he stood. ”Peter! What do you have to say to the haters that have emerged after you came out?” ”Peter, was this a stunt to raise awareness around the fact that your fathers are gay?” ”Peter, is this to get attention to yourself after Lola and Harry Osborn got coverage for their invention?” ”Peter, is it true you’re dating Captain America’s secretary?” ”Peter, is it true that you hate transgender people?” ”Peter, congratulations on coming out!” ”Peter do you have a statement to make after posting the disputed instagram post this weekend?”
Tony's brow furrows. He hadn't thought about that before. Of course Steve wouldn't be thrilled to find out later that Tony had never spoken about his infatuation, especially since it could have possibly endangered a team member. That's not something he ever wants to experience. Tony shudders.
'I-' Tony sighs deeply. Steve frowns openly now, not understanding this situation at all. 'I have not been entirely honest with you. That's what Clint means. I- I might have some not too friendly feelings for you.'
'Yes, to Bruce and to Thor. But I don't want another incident with Clint like the one last week.', Steve clarifies as if any of them would have forgotten the prank war that had found its ending when Clint's locker almost blew in his face. The two of them hadn't spoken since then and no one knew how bad of a fight would follow. Or how much Nat would be out for Tony's blood.
He has to take a deep breath. The room is quiet like a grave. 'There were more weapons, far more. It made me think that they didn't attack with the worst they had.' He looks down. 'Jarvis, do you have coverage of that?'
'Tony?' Steve's voice mirrors his confusion. Tony turns away from the camera and faces Steve though he keeps his eyes averted. He looks insecure.
'Barton?' Tony is exasperated and there is a panicking look on his face, his voice is steel though. Why he should be so nervous suddenly is a mystery to Steve. With a slight frown he watches Tony who still stares up at the camera as if he sees Clint right through it. 'What the hell is this supposed to be?', he angrily demands to know though he seems to already know the answer.
Steve stops dead on his tracks. 'Are you fighting with Jarvis again?', he asks with a knowing smile.
'Nothing.', he replies, looking at his friend who seems disgusted by his choice in movie. Just as he wonders what Clint could want from him, he gets an answer.
Clint makes a retching sound for which he earns himself a glare and a 'Jealous?' from Tony. Steve sighs, making his way inside to where a few students still wait for their lunch and gets in line. He doesn't even want to see Nat's reaction to that statement. While Tony and Clint didn't get along, Nat despised Tony, a mutual feeling. He doesn't trust her one bit, his reason to put on the Stark façade around their friends. No wonder that she regularly questions his and Tony's relationship, worried Tony could use Steve.
Steve sighs deeply, kissing Tony's temple again. The rest of the drive they pass in silence, leaning on each other for comfort. It's a good thing Steve hadn't insisted on Tony staying in the hospital. Just when they reach the Tower Tony becomes aware of the state he is in. The clothes he had worn under the suit are torn and singed, bloated with blood. His hair is full of dirt and blood, he must look frightful.
Steve has tears in his eyes when he helps Tony stand up. The injuries slowly start to burn their way into his consciousness. He winces slightly when Steve puts an arm around him to support Tony but otherwise doesn't let his discomfort be noticed. His worries that Steve might hate him because he didn't protect his best friend enough vanish into thin air when Steve presses a kiss to his temple, muttering an 'I love you'.
Tony types in his security code when there is no answer at all. It apparently doesn't have the desired effect. 'Maybe there is some kind of interference.', he mutters, turning away completely from Steve.
'I don't want to talk about that, Steve.', Tony cuts him off before he can even start talking. James and Maria exit the elevator after him giving their parents a strange look.
The Winter Soldier had been agreed on to be a trainee for the team. For this reason Steve had called in a training exercise for them to practice together and learn to interact as a team. Natasha was chosen alongside Hawkeye to form the group of 'villains' whom they would have to track down and take in, a task that sounds easier than it is done. Tony had organized them a flight to a mountain region close to their home and yet void of human life so that they wouldn't scare any civilians.
'Shall I help you?', he offers but Tony merely shakes his head, heading off for the bathroom. He evades looking in the vicinity of the mirror as he slowly strips out of his clothing, throwing it on the floor so it could be burned later. He doesn't need the reminder. He shouldn't take a shower but doesn't think he would be able to sleep like this, with Bucky's blood on his hands. The warm water of the shower burns but it also chases away some of the memories. Barnes' dead face. The explosion. A weapon aimed at his head.
When he is done, he flops back in the chair and gets out the blueprints to work on a second version.
Barton startles, gasping. 'Oh my god, I.. I can hear you..' After days of only silence Tony could have chosen a softer way to reintroduce Barton with hearing but it wouldn't be half this funny.
'First, I am not putting up with him. I love Tony with all my heart. And if you would know him better, you would have a better opinion of him as well. He is used to people around him using him. So he keeps them at distance. I know he can be an asshole. A big one at that. Don't think I am blind. He's snarky and secretive and is always putting up a façade so no one sees when he is hurt.' Steve sighs. 'But he is hurt and he is wonderful once he lets you in. He cares about all of you.'
Tony had gone through all the files himself, had looked for hints and snips that might be related to his parents' death and had come up with not much. Apparently those other soldiers had been trained in a secret facility somewhere in Russia, then Barnes had been wiped, again and again and again. He wouldn't remember killing Howard and Maria if he tried. Somehow that makes Tony even more angry at him.
Hours later finally someone comes for them. The doctors use a lot of fancy terms, talking to Nat and Clint's brother for a long time. On the other side of the glass wall the group can't hear a lot but when the doctor is done talking, Steve turns to Bruce, the only of them being vaguely familiar with medical terms.
First he had been livid to find out that the murderer of his parents is non other than Steve's best buddy from WWII. That he was or is being brainwashed barely mattered. Why would it? He lives, they are dead, period.
his eyebrows almost reach his hairline. 'What? We both made mistakes? What the actual fuck, Steve?', he asks. 'It's now my fault for blaming Barnes? Are you out of your fucking mind?!'
'Alright.', he drawls, not feeling like prying just yet. 'I just wanted to let you know that Nat and I are on the way to the hospital.' When Tony doesn't react in the slightest, Steve raises an eyebrow. 'Do you want to come with us?'
Tony smiles ruefully. He doesn't want to lie to his son, not even about something like this. He's too clever to be fooled anyway. 'It's not quite that easy.' When James looks up at him with inquisitive eyes, Tony smiles and ruffles his hair. 'I promise, I'll talk to him.'
This had been going on for weeks, it had started the evening after Steve's revelation. It's insane. Maybe nothing is forgotten and maybe not all forgiven but Tony definitely wants his husband back.
'Tony, it's the right thing to do when one your friends is lying there on his own.', Steve reprimands him with a sigh, having had this discussion with his boyfriend many times. Usually though it was about Tony finally needing to see a doctor.
'Slow down, Tony. Darling.' Finally Tony looks up to meet Steve's impossibly blue eyes. 'Please slow down. Could you start at the beginning?' How could he be so calm seeing that his best friend is right now little more than a bundle of blood and pulp? It gives Tony the strength though to breathe in deeply and nod.
They still don't talk about it. Actually, none of them even brings it up. It gets a little better after Tony's talk with James because apparently their son had the same talk with Steve. They are talking again to each other, at least about normal, everyday stuff. Non-dangerous stuff.
'And what is this?' Before Steve has real time to react, Natasha has come up on his other side and snatches his sketchbook out of his hand, then flips through its pages. Steve feels himself blushing deeply. He is not even trying to get his book back. Any attempt would be useless, anyway. He could never retrieve anything Natasha has her mind on.
Two dark pieces of high tech rest in it. Tony points at his ears when Barton continues to stare at him like a fish. He signs 'May I?' before he takes the pieces out of the box and walks around the bed to fix them in Barton's ears. They are a little too big yet, one can actually still see them when looking at Barton, a fact that needs to be fixed. Tony makes a mental note to make them smaller next time. After it is done, Tony pulls out his tablet and types away for a moment, then says, 'Tell me how the quality of the sound is.'
But alas, the arm around him tightens a little, a sure enough sign that his husband had heard him and ignores the little delay.
Tony's eyes light up as the door opens but when he finds that it's just Barton who's come to annoy him again, he turns back to his work to hide his disappointment. Instead he scowls.
'I cannot recommend that, Captain Rogers. Sergeant Barnes is not in a shape to be seen. His injuries were extensive. By the time he came here, he must have been dead for some time.', he tries to hold Steve back, at least for a little while.
'I am really not in the mood, Legolas.', Tony grumbles, stepping inside though he doesn't really want to. He would like to get back on the road in an instance. Driving is easier than stopping and having to face reality.
Why did Steve tell him this?, one part of his brain questions while the other rejoices that he did. This information in the hands of the wrong person at the wrong time could have horrible consequences. Nevertheless, it doesn't change a thing. His husband is trying to protect the murderer of Tony's parents.
'I need to do some tests to see how well the tech works.', Tony says, putting the good-natured banter aside for the moment, returning to the task at hand. Barton nods.
'When did you find this?', Tony chokes out, trying to get his brain working again. It's not what is on his mind but it's the only question he can ask just about now. He can't even look at Steve, can't bring himself to look away from the evidence his husband presented him with. Dread curls in his stomach. Tony can't even admit to himself why it is there.
For months now they had to watch the two men being unhappily in love with each other without knowing about their common predicament. Clint and Natasha just can't watch them anymore. It's so frustrating to listen to Rogers's endless accounts of how great and perfect Tony is and Tony's endless denying though he is just as obvious as Steve.
Barnes knows Tony saw him ages ago, making him briefly wonder how long he had actually followed them. He is like their personal shadow.
Steve massages the back of his nose. 'And tell him what? That I love him? He doesn't feel the same, why should he?', he says exasperated. It's not as if she wouldn't know so.
Clint wants to murder his two teammates. How can they just be so thickheaded? It's frustrating beyond words. The next arrow hits his target right in the center. The training sequence of Jarvis is already set on quite challenging, even for Hawkeye, but that doesn't keep his mind from wandering to the leaders of the Avengers.
Steve sighs deeply, looking up from his work. There are several stacks of paper put aside for closer inspection. 'No, not yet.', he admits, looking tired and like he is about to give up.
It's approximately two weeks after the whole fiasco when Tony takes his son to bed that the boy makes his move. Tony had just read him his bedtime story and gave him a goodnight kiss, he is just about to turn off the light when James calls him back.
'I didn't want to threaten our friendship.', Steve admits, joining Tony's laughter a moment later when the tension breaks finally. 'Apparently all knew except for us.'
Without further commenting on that Tony enters the garage and walks to the back to one of his rather inconspicuous cars. His phone starts beeping when he gets into it and turns on the ignition. Tony pulls it out of his pocket to look who it is. Steve's face show up on the display, a photo taken on their anniversary last year. The smile is mocking him now. For a moment he thinks about just not answering but that's not how fighting with Steve works.
'Well, I'll leave this particular hopeless case to you, Nat.', Clint says as he stands up, obviously just having come with her to enable her to get her hands on Steve's sketchbook. He tries not to let his friend's words touch him. Of course his case is hopeless. Tony is never going to return his feelings, no matter how much Steve wishes he would.
Steve sighs again, not feeling like arguing anymore. Tasha had never felt anything but resentment for Tony and that would probably not change anytime soon.
James frowns, looking back at Tony. He had scanned the room as if he didn't quite believe him. 'Why?'
It's a strange thing to be contemplating, especially since Tony is a hero. He had never thought about killing anyone, not Obadiah for putting him through Afghanistan, not Loki for forcing him to go into space and almost dying there, not Killian for endangering Pepper's life. Not even Rumlow for almost getting his husband killed. It's new and frightening and Tony can't fight this. He wants to see Barnes dead for killing his mother.
They pile into Thor's and Tony's car, then drive after the ambulance to the hospital. Clint's already on his way to surgery when they arrive after a very silent and tense car drive. They remain mostly in silence, waiting for a doctor to come for them. The only thing interrupting their silent vigil is the arrival of Barney whom Thor tells what had happened.
Tony glares at the archer one last time, then walks past him into the kitchen where Laura stands, already busy with preparing lunch.
Steve throws a disapproving glance in her direction. 'He is not.' He doesn't feel like explaining to them that Tony had had a very traumatic field surgery while he was still a teenager and was being taken to Afghanistan by his father to test some weapons. Tony had never shared much details but the scars on his chest and the mumbling during his many nightmares have given Steve a pretty good idea that if he knew the exact extent of Tony's psychological and physical wounds, he would find a way to travel back in time and hit Howard Stark in the face for ever putting Tony through that.
Steve shakes his head. Tony turns around to go into the kitchen to organize something for them and then go looking for the kids who must be starving for attention by now, when the blond calls him back. 'Wait.' He stands up from the sofa, the little stiffness in his legs not as quickly gone as usual. For a moment Tony wonders for exactly how long his husband had stayed in that exact position. 'I asked Clint to watch the children for tonight.'
Tony still speaks with Bruce, completely ignoring Clint and his side of the table when he and Steve sit down and Steve hands him his sandwich and coffee. Tony accepts it with the smallest smile, one Steve is sure is invisible to the others. He chats with Clint about the latest series the other man had dug out for them to watch, and with Tasha about her new job as a ballet teacher in a local school, a side job she had taken until she finishes her studies. Lunch passes more quickly than Steve would have liked, mentally he already prepares for his afternoon lectures. So when Clint brings his and Tasha's tray away, he prepares to get up as well to accompany Tony to the perimeter and say him goodbye.
They are three stories under the common floor when the elevator stops suddenly. The jerk almost throws Tony off his feet but Steve can catch him in the last moment. Dazed the inventor looks at the ceiling as if the problem would be visible from the inside.
As unfair as it might seem, he doesn't care for his father's death. He hadn't loved Howard the way he had loved his mother. He was glad to be rid of him. Hadn't the death of his mother overshadowed these days, he probably would have thrown a party.
'I have been meaning to check on Mr Stark again.', the doctor says, stepping a little closer. Tony shakes his head, he doesn't want any more doctors or needles around him. They make him nervous. The doctor exchanges a look with Steve, then leaves the room, leaving Tony in Steve's care. Everyone in SHIELD knows by now not to pressure Tony into an examination.
'Uh uh. Trouble in paradise? Those are details that I want, Stark.' Clint is now grinning like a giddy three year old, Tony's glare doesn't do a freaking thing about that. 'This is no way to treat me after asking us to watch your children.', he chastises him though his wide grin is ruining that for Barton.
Tony sighs. 'Just because I am mad at him, doesn't mean I don't love him.', he explains the kid. 'I love your Papa very much. I'm just a little angry at him at the moment.' Tony isn't sure if James understands it but he nods.
Jarvis analyzes Barton's reactions to a wide variety sounds. Apparently there is an insufficiency when it comes to the high frequencies, a mistake Tony is sure he can repair. All in all the earpieces work better than he had hoped.
'Some medium burns, a dislocated shoulder but that was fixed. The TBI is moderate rather than mild. I got quite a blow on the head. Some bruised rips and a fractured one. My ankle is sprained. Otherwise I think I mentioned everything.', Tony lists, knowing Steve wouldn't leave it be until he knew.
Steve regrets ever needing so long to react to the words he had longed to hear. He just hadn't been able to understand how Tony could actually feel the same for him. When he draws back to look into deep brown eyes, Tony slowly blinks at him like he can't quite believe this is happening. He's beautiful.
He had never told Steve about it, but there had been an incident with Barton two years ago. Tony had been sitting around with the archer when Steve had to go to his lecture, when there was a loud boom outside. Something in him had snapped, for several minutes he had been back in Afghanistan, had been back on that surgery table in the middle of nowhere with strange hands in his chest, digging for the rest of the shrapnel. He must have totally broken down there and then on his sofa. Steve would have been fuzzing and would have insisted Tony to lie down and all of that. Everyone else would just have panicked or maybe laughed. When he came to himself again though, Barton had gotten him a glass of water, then, after a long look at Tony, had flopped down on the sofa again and criticized his lack of taste in movies. Tony had quipped back at him that he wouldn't recognize genius if it bit him in the ass. They had never talked about the incident but since then, Tony had known he could trust Barton. He sees him as some kind of brother nowadays. Brothers who don't get along but are there for each other when necessary.
They had named their kids after dear people whom they had lost, or rather presumably lost. It's especially bitter now but Tony forces his own feelings down for the moment. With a smile he picks up his son who had crossed the distance. 'Where's Papa?', he asks after the hug.
Steve freezes suddenly, knowing now all too good what this is about. They want him to finally confess before his infatuation would ruin a mission. Tony is rigid as well. Does he suspect? Is he so repulsed by the very idea?
'I am being unfair?! I?! Who made me an orphan? Huh?', he demands to know. 'You tell me my parents were murdered by your best friend and tell me to not freak out because of that?' How can he be so naive? The guilt is written clearly all over Steve's face that this is exactly what the blond had hoped for.
Tony huffs out a laugh. 'Me too. This is crazy. I just want our life back.' He can feel Steve nodding above him.
Apparently his thoughts are plain as day to his friend. Natasha slides closer, a sympathetic look on her face. It's worse than Clint's assessment of his situation.
The nurse says something about needing to stitch him up and Tony nods. When the doctor comes in, he knows already what he is going to say. He sees the lips of the doctor move but the world seems to be without sound. It could have been hours before the sound returns and the nurse leads him into a private waiting room. He didn't even feel the stitches.
Either Steve doesn't see the warning signs or he chooses to ignore them. 'He was brainwashed, Tony. He didn't do it.' It sounds pleading. It makes Tony sick. 'It was Hydra. They killed your parents,' The words sting more than they have any right to, 'they created those soldiers who might run around right now and kill others. It's all on them, not on Bucky. He would have never-'
'It must be from Barnes. When my thrusters gave out when I was hit, I almost fell down that cliff. He grabbed me. God knows how he held me up long enough for me to get a hand on the edge. They fired at him. He should have dropped me. Barnes got hit, bad. I don't know how bad. I was able to climb back up and join the fight again. Goodness, he tried to shield me, for whatever reason. Jarvis was trying to do some repairs with the nanobots but during a fight that's semioptimal. Barnes managed to take out some of the attackers, I could overpower some others. There were just too many. We had to withdraw and no means of knowing if we were running in a good direction or from the frying pan into the fire. We just tried to get some distance between us and them. Jarvis managed to give me flight power. I picked up Barnes and flew for our lives..' Tony sighs deeply.
'Yes, it is. Invite him out. Then at least you know what the matter is.' Clint steps closer. 'I hate to see you suffering like this.'
He is still worried about the blond man who had hurled himself up in their shared space, looking through all the files of SHIELD that had been released by Agent Romanov in the process of taking Hydra down. Tony knows which information he is looking for so desperately and why Steve wants to get back on his feet as fast as possible.
'Jarvis, what was that?', Tony asks before he has even regained his balance. He sounds annoyed rather than frightened. When there is no answer though, he is no longer at ease. Fortunately he didn't notice Steve's blush at their closeness nor his lingering touch. It's not that often that Tony is as close as he had been moments ago
'Call an ambulance.', he shouts over his shoulder, trying to see if his friend is okay. For the driver he wouldn't be able to do much, his car already being completely on fire. The heat it radiates almost singes Steve's skin but he drags Clint away from the crash side. Thor helps him not a moment later, having ran the distance between them.
Tony can't sleep. As much as he tries, he just can't fall asleep. His brain refuses to cooperate, his thoughts race and he can't simply shut them off. Usually after a whole day of working for the benefit of his company, dealing with the kids and then doing some work for the Avengers, Tony falls into bed and is gone to the land of sleep within seconds if he happens to find his way into bed.
'If you ever need something you can come with me. I won't tell Steve.', he says, not looking at Barnes either. It's not without difficulty that Tony speaks as lighthearted as he does.
Tony hides his face against his chest, breathes in the familiar scent. Already he can feel the sleep pulling at his eyelids. The familiar pose lulls him to sleep faster than he would have thought possible. It could be the lack of sleep that had accumulated in the last weeks.
'I also gotta go. Tony, you coming?', Steve asks in an attempt to salvage the situation. Tony nods, ignoring Tasha and stands up, bidding Thor and Bruce goodbye.
'And could you please try to be nice?', Steve asks, already knowing the answer. Tony had for once actually agreed to stand up before lunch and go eat in the cafeteria of Steve's college with him. They are on their way to the cafeteria of Steve's campus. While Tony had graduated a year before he met Steve who had at that time just started his first year, the blond still has to study to earn his degree. Not everyone can be a genius and graduate with 17 after all.
He's down in Tony's lab as he usually is this time of the day. Tony just puts the finishing touches to the latest gadget for SI. He rubs his grease stained hands on a cloth that's almost as dirty as they are. Steve closes his book and with that hides the sketch of Tony. It's one of his favorite ones yet. It shows the inventor with his robot, Dum-E. Tony had talked with his little friend who had gotten some grease on himself. Tony had crouched in front of him and cleaned him as good as possible. The soft smile would haunt Steve for a while.
Instantly Steve's smile turns more genuine. He must look like a lovesick fool, not that Tony would notice that or that he would care. The brunet looks beautiful like this, with his hair all mussed up and grease on his hands. This is his natural environment, not the lime light, not a meeting room. It's here in the lab that he truly becomes himself.
'Seriously Steve, I don't know why you put up with him and defend him. You deserve much better. You could have anyone.', Tasha huffs, concentrating on driving.
'I don't put up with you. You are such a wonderful person and you don't even see that. When you see a problem you don't succumb to it. You don't stand around idly like the rest of us. You're a fixer. You don't mourn what is lost, you take the pieces and make them better.', Steve says, conviction audible in every word. 'You're a hero.'
'He is deaf, holding his hand won't change that.', Tony states so icily that Steve almost flinches. There is a hard edge to his voice when he turns back to his work, picking up the welder once more, sliding the goggles back in place. 'That's just not my style.'
'You should go home, Stark. You look like you could se some sleep.', Clint says when Tony makes no move to get up again.
'I know he's dead.' It sounds final when he says it. The truth starts sinking in slowly. 'Shush, the doctor says you're in shock.' He caresses Tony's cheek to get him to look up. It stings slightly, letting Tony know that a big bruise is forming there already.
Maria had come two years later. They are Tony's pride and joy. He wouldn't want to miss a single second with them. He can hear her play outside with Lila, she probably hadn't heard her brother shout. They are quite opposites. She loves to do science with her Daddy, James loves to go to art galleries with his Papa. Maria had already decided that she wants to become a bio engineer, if just because she found out that there are no real life unicorns. Tony couldn't be prouder.
The music is quietening as Jarvis alerts Tony to Steve's presence. 'Hello.' It doesn't sound as cheerful as Steve usually is. His stomach is in a turmoil.
When they open the door to Clint's room, Tasha stops dead in her tracks. She must be shocked by the scene in front of her just as Steve had been surprised. Tony is asleep on the chair near the bed, looking adorable and peaceful. Clint had somewhen in the night gotten a hold of Tony's tablet and had fallen asleep playing some kind of game probably.
Tony rolls his eyes, looking up from his phone for once since they entered the campus. 'I am always nice.' He always pretends to be busy when he is among people, as if he would know of a thousand better places to be. After four years though Steve had gotten used to this side of Tony.
'Hey, what's up?' Clint's voice startles him out of his thoughts as the archer flops down on the sofa next to him.
'Well, I happen to like Bruce and Thor. At least Bruce isn't stupid and knows what I am talking about. And Thor is funny.' Tony crosses his arms, glaring at Steve. 'It's not as if Barton would like me particularly either.'
'It was you who told me that it's not his fault and he needs help.', he reminds him, taking a step closer to the brunet.
Tony sighs and returns her attention to James and Maria on the swing. Barnes just wants to see Steve's kids, nothing special about that. At least that's what Tony guesses. After all, Steve had told him about them right before the Winter Soldier threw him into the Potomac.
'Morning, Laura.', he says as calmly as he can. Trying to get his emotions under control is a lost cause, however, he can't face the kids like this. The woman in question smiles across her shoulder but doesn't turn from her chopping.
'What happened between you and Papa?', James asks suddenly, startling Tony. Of course he had noticed the tension in the house, had noticed it right from the beginning. It's a surprise it comes so late. 'For some days you have been, well, weird.', he tries to explain, pulling his blanket further up.
The man with the big baggy black jacket, the dark cap and the black jeans and boots has been following them all the way from the bakery to the playground. This is no chance meeting though, Tony had seen him too often and in too many different places for this to be a coincidence. Tony Stark knows when he is being followed.
Tony's eyebrows climb almost to his hairline. His mouth opens and closes a few times without anything coming out of it. Steve can't suppress his grin anymore.
Tony shakes his head, cuddling into Steve's embrace. He rests his forehead against his shoulder. 'Still, I am a mess, I don't care about others.'
'Uh, am I in trouble?', Tony wants to know, a smile playing around the edges of his mouth. He hands Butterfingers his welder, turning fully to his boyfriend.
Steve most definitely flinches. 'Okay, I might not have phrased that well. Can you just come up so we can talk in person?', he inquires softly.
That's how they had always been since they first met each other. They banter, they prank each other, they fight. But in the end, Tony would call Barton his friend and knows the feeling is mutual. They would go to great length to annoy each other but also to help and comfort the other by offering a sense of normality. Tony doesn't do sitting around at someone's sickbed. It would have worried the archer more than his absence.
Tony shakes his head. 'No, screw you.' With that he turns around and is on his way to the elevator. This is certainly not how he had pictured the evening. He can't continue this conversation, not now anyway and he doubts he would ever want to have it.
'Damn you.', he says out loud, scowling at Clint now openly. The blond doesn't really leave him any choice.
Steve shakes his head. 'I am glad that you're the one alive. That's terrible. I'm a horrible person. When the nurse called and said you two are in the hospital, I asked for you and she told me you're worse for wear but that Bucky is dead, I was relieved. I was so relieved that you were alive.', he admits under tears.
'I cannot say for sure until after the autopsy There are major burns on your friend, a lot of internal damage. He has been shot several times. Each of his wounds could have been lethal.'
Steve sighs, trying to hide the blush. 'Nothing.', he mumbles again. Natasha sits down next to Clint, they both take a look at the picture of someone who is obviously Tony. He can't even deny that fact.
Barton snorts, knowing that they both know why he cares. 'Oh, please. If you wouldn't be so obvious, maybe it would be cute.'
When Tony enters their apartment he isn't in the least surprised to find Steve on the sofa, hunched over what must be at least a thousand pieces of paper. Steve still claims he can't read and concentrate when working with computer screens so Jarvis printed it all out for him, all the information SHIELD or Hydra had been storing away. The only surprise is that James isn't around to snoop. He usually likes to take a look at all the information he isn't supposed to have.
The dark lines slowly come together to form a picture, a very particular one at that. Steve doesn't even has to consciously think about him to have him on his mind. As usual the blond has drawn his favorite subject, his teammate Tony. He's a little embarrassed about the whole situation but no matter what he has tried, he can't get the inventor out of his thoughts. After their shaky start, they had started to spend more time together, if only because they are the team's leaders and live together. Quite soon they had become something like friends, a relationship that at least for Steve had quickly evolved into something deeper. He has come to admire his friend, to be just a tiny bit infatuated with Tony. Unfortunately for Steve, it didn't stop there.
Steve extracts his hand to rifle through the papers to show Tony what he is talking about. The inventor feels lost without his touch, bereft of it. Finally Steve pulls out a very thin folder and hands it to Tony. All hesitation is gone now, the Captain had surfaced. It's just another mission debrief, information that need to be conveyed, no matter how painful they are.
Half an hour later Steve is on his way downstairs to finally talk to Tony. He had had to gather his wits some more before he has dared face his friend. His nerves had cooled down in the meantime but now they are shaking him up again. When facing a battle he is never so nervous but there he knows what to expect.
'We will do anything in our power.', a doctor promises before hurrying off with the stretcher. Tony's shoulders slump as he sees his teammate being carried off like this. Suddenly he doesn't know what to do.
Steve seems hesitant, at least a little. He sits down next to Tony though without touching him. Tony doesn't want any space between them right now and reaches over to rest his hand on Steve's. The blond looks at him with sad eyes.
'Hello, sweetheart.' Stella beams at him. Then she recommends something which Clint takes as usual without hesitation or second guessing. He really trusts her cooking. It's just the small cafeteria of the campus after all, only serving about a hundred students every day. Then again, Steve has to agree, the food is very good. He takes the same as Clint and gets a sandwich and coffee for Tony who as usual pretends that he could never eat in a cafeteria but his boyfriend hadn't had breakfast today except for the coffee which hardly counts.
Tony looks up from his work and his face lights up so beautifully, Steve's heart gives a painful squeeze. To see that smile, he would do anything anytime. The world should never be deprived of Tony's smile. 'Hi, Steve.', he greets the blond, putting his tools down.
Tony sighs, giving up on continuing his work. He crosses his arms and leans on the workbench, looking straight at his friend. 'If Steve doesn't feel the same.. It would all be weird. We wouldn't be friends anymore.' And Steve wouldn't want to spend time with him anymore.
Steve lies right behind his back, his breath light and deep. So close and yet so far away. He isn't fooling Tony for a second. The blond lies awake each night for at least as long as Tony. The shadows under his eyes had become permanent. His convalescence had gone well, as well as could be expected. Despite his rigorous training though, Steve doesn't seem to find sleep either.
Natasha isn't feeling any better about this matter. She is angry at their leaders for not seeing their attempts for what they are. They are both ready to give this whole thing up.
He and Nat had done anything in their power to get them to finally admit to their feelings but these two fools are just too stubborn to act accordingly. They are in their own ways of happiness and Clint sees it as his duty to save them. But they are too stupid to see that and block off Clint's attempts to help at every corner.
That makes Tony just feel even more sympathy for his lover. 'Oh, come here.' Tony opens his arms and lets the soldier cuddle into the embrace. 'That doesn't make you a horrible person. I should have saved him.'
'Alright.' Steve smiles then at him and it's like the sun is rising. 'We were in the forest, going after Romanov. Thought she might be hiding there. We weren't quite agreeing on the direction so we just walked for a while. Then the com system shut down and I couldn't get a connection to you guys anymore. I'll admit I was worried. Even Jarvis couldn't find a signal anymore. It was like we just dropped over the rim of the world. Barnes didn't like it as well. We could have just went back and reported this. It could have been a natural phenomenon, it could be human made. We didn't trust it and decided to investigate. None of Jay's sensors worked properly, I had to activate manual controls.' Tony groans and hides his hand in his face. 'We should have called you in, we should have never went alone.'
'I didn't take his side, Tony. I just want you to see it, that's all. I will always be there for you.', Steve says and it sounds sad beyond words.
'I told him to stay home.', Tony says, not sure why he opts for the truth. He knows exactly how inquiring his son is, after all.
'You'll pay for this.', Tony says exactly as the door to the workshop opens and Clint vanishes from sight.
Steve's ears ring as he makes his way to the accident. He almost loses his balance when the ringing doesn't stop but he manages to get to the person who had been hit by the car, immediately recognizing Clint.
Tony wonders where their shadow sleeps as a known fugitive with a metal arm on top of that. After a while he gets his kids and heads back for the car. On the way home he sees a lone figure on the sidewalk, hands deep in the pockets, heading as fast as he can for the subway.
'Good morning, Tony.', she says. 'Rough night?' Tony wonders what she means but when he sees his reflection in the window, he understands her concerns. There are deep shadows underneath his eyes, a sure sign that he hadn't had much rest. He looks exactly how he feels.
'Where is Stark?', he asks, looking at Steve for an excuse he doesn't have. He could easily lie but that seems wrong.
'I think that's enough questioning for one day. Tony's hurt and needs rest. Let's get you home.', Steve decides after a moment of silence. 'You can talk about this to Fury.', he says to Natasha.
'Ready to head upstairs?' Tony pulls him out of his thoughts. They had decided to watch a movie and order some pizza as soon as Tony was done and apparently the inventor still wants to go through with that plan.
Steve sighs. 'I know. It's just.. I need to discuss something with you and, well, I am not sure they should see that.' He seems hesitant as if he doesn't know how to phrase this. Tony can feel his face fall. Steve doesn't really notice his reaction, being a little to busy looking at anything but Tony. Before he can ask though what Steve meant by that statement, the blond continues. 'It's about something I have found in the files. Something you should see.'
'Thank you.', Tony whispers quietly as Steve leads him out of the hospital. Steve merely nods as he holds the door to the car open. Happy has a worried look on his face when he looks in the rear mirror but he starts the engine immediately, getting them home. Steve raises the wall between them, pulling Tony closer to him.
The guards are no problem whatsoever. After they recognize who is standing in front of them, they open the doors for him and wish him a pleasant evening and a speedy recovery for whoever he is visiting. He rolls his eyes once he is past them.
'Okay, I might have lied about Steve's whereabouts.', Barton quips. He's already on his way up to the air duct, getting away from Tony and Steve.
Yeah, Tony thinks, that was before. 'I can't help the killer of my mother. Not even for you. And you can't expect that from me.' He takes a few steps back to get some distance between them, fearing what he might do if Steve came too close.
'Never.', Steve says, not missing a beat. 'I just would want you to trust our friends enough to show them who you truly are.'
It takes the team probably half an hour to get to the position of the hospital which is quite some distance from their training ground. They all come, Steve is the first to enter the room, Natasha and Clint are right behind him. The rear consists of Bruce, who hadn't participated in their team exercise, Thor and Sam. They all look concerned. They don't chatter and that's something Tony appreciates very much. Steve crouches down in front of him, taking a hold of his hand. They probably already know but he has to tell Steve himself.
'How could I, Tony? No, I love you. With all my heart.', he promises with so much feeling that Tony believes him.
Steve closes his mouth again, instead turns to their kids to greet them. It's better like that. Maria is a little too tired to fully take in what just happened but Tony knows it won't have been the last he heard about this from James. The next few days sneak past them all, they seem to last an eternity. Tony feels like the hours refuse to pass. The kids refuse to play around them anymore, they quietly watch them as if one of their parents might explode any second. Maria is even more moody and James spends more time on his own than is normal. It's not healthy but the family falls into this very awkward routine.
It's not Barnes' fault what happened back there. Tony had resigned to hold on a grudge. The soldier probably doesn't even remember. He had had a brief thought of scaring him away when he saw him that very first time on the way to the kindergarten. That stream of thoughts had vanished pretty quickly though. Tony doesn't exactly know why or how it happened, but being angry at an unknown figure was far easier than being faced with the target of that hate, especially since that target looks so worn and generally down at heel.
Dazed she sits down. The doctors had been quite explicit that he probably would never be able to hear again and now he is sitting here, talking like nothing ever happened. 'What happened?'
'Stop bashing Tony, Tasha.' Clint is sitting up now. He can't have possibly read her lips from his position. 'And come over and tell me about your day. That Tony is an ass we all know, now I want to hear all about what I am missing out on.'
'I came so close to losing you today.', Steve whispers in the dark. Tony can barely make out his form in the bed. 'I don't know what I would have done. Losing Bucky again is hard, I haven't really processed it all. But if it would have been you..' He can hear the tears though Tony doesn't see them.
'What?' Steve's brain refuses to work properly. He can't believe what he had just heard, needs a conformation while his heart already rejoices.
'Why don't you let anyone else see what I see?', Steve asks when he presses a kiss to Tony's shoulder. He does know the genius well enough to recognize his breathing when he is asleep and when he pretends to be.
'Evening, sweet pea. Any luck on finding him?', he asks though, choosing to ignore the suspicious absence of their kids for the moment. They are probably up in their rooms, trying to find a new way of getting into trouble.
Tony rolls his eyes. 'Picked it up when I was dating a hot chick.' Barton narrows his eyes like he doesn't believe it. Not very surprising seeing as they had known each other since Tony was eighteen and he had been with Steve ever since then. Tony doesn't care if he thinks he is lying. So what if he had spend the past days learning sign language with Jarvis and Dum-E. It's none of Barton's business anyway.
Of course Clint knows, of course the whole team knows why Tony cares. Everyone, except the one who is the object of Tony's affection. And how could he not be in love with Steve? Perfect, sweet Steve who cares so much for everyone. He has spent a lot of time with Tony lately, probably some kind of team bonding. How could Tony not fall for him deeper than he should? The team has noticed of course though Tony tried to deny it at every occasion. Lately he has given up on that habit. It's still a mystery for Tony how Steve can be so blind to his affections but is very glad about it at the same time.
Something snaps inside the inventor. 'He killed my parents, stop defending him!', he yells across the room.
'Sure.' Tony turns away from Steve for a moment to gather his wits. A few moments ago it had seemed like a good idea to tell Steve what he feels, now, not so much. But he was never known to chicken out.
'You know what we are talking about, Tony.', Clint cuts in. That shuts Tony up completely. 'You can either tell him or you'll be stuck in there.' The threat obviously is meant for Tony which confuses Steve. What could Tony tell him that could threaten the team?
'A good morning to you too, Steve. It's good to hear you again.', he adds with a grin. 'Seriously though, guys, it's good to hear again. I was slowly going insane here.', he admits. He shows off the earpieces Tony had built him, telling them how great it is to hear his own voice again. Tasha calls in sick and they spend the rest of the morning listening to Clint's rambling about whatever comes to his minds and describing, meal by meal, what wonders of Stella he had been missing out on.
