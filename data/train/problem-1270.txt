“I'm sorry, I don't think I quite get what you mean.”
Then something sharp collided with his head, cold metal followed by hot blood. His body tried to shut itself down, not wanting to deal with another trauma, but Sherlock fought it, keeping himself up with his hands pressed into the ground. When the spots cleared from his vision, he saw her, the unmistakable fiery hair. She was armed like a soldier with as many weapons as one person could manage, and she had a weighty spear pointed at Sherlock's chest, the tip of it bright red with his own blood.
"What?"
As soon as he opened the door, he wished he hadn't.
“You don't understand.”
"Go home, John. You don't need to be here right now."
"Girlfriend?" Sherlock took note of the tone in John's voice. It was almost worried.
John nodded. “It's chance.”
There was something soft about the command that made John fall silent. He had answered thousands of commands from Sherlock Holmes, little things like
“But just flatmates?”
“Yes. He flatlined on the table.”
John paused. “No.”
For days, Sherlock had walked through London, and he had seen so many people, and while they were mostly morons, they were also mostly
“Shut up, Iceman, they're reading the scores!” Irene said through her laughter. She fell silent, sitting on the edge of the couch in a bathrobe, her face bright with excitement. Mycroft conceded, standing behind her, with a broody expression that John was convinced ran in the family.
“Hah. Well, no, not lately, actually.”
Perhaps that was behind the contradictions between her words and actions, a slip in the compartmentalization of her life. But it still didn't account for her careful study of the flat.
, what to do about the two sentences, and most importantly, what to do about John Watson.
“It was an honest question. Which I'd still like answered.”
Sherlock mentally chastised himself, but didn't feel he could backtrack. “It's always you. You keep me right.”
I was pacing through the living room, a nervous wreck. John watched me warily from the kitchen door way.
The smile slid off John’s face as he slumped in his chair. Then he dove into his desk drawer, heart pounding, feeling almost sick.
“Come here,” Violet beckoned him. “You’re going to need to bind those with an ACE bandage or something.” Sherlock picked up one of the Monoprix bags then picked up the wooden chair he had been sitting in. He carried both over, plunked the chair down in front of Violet and handed her the bag. As she dug into the bag and pulled out the cotton wool and antiseptic cream, she asked, “Why hasn’t he given you what you need to solve the case?”
Molly hid her irritation. Ever since she had started showing, people had been showering her with unsolicited advice about babies, even people like Bodley, who was childless. And Molly knew for a fact he couldn’t keep goldfish alive.
“What?”
“And you,” she asked the twenty-seven year old Victor Trevor in the photograph. “Where do you fit in all of this?”
Violet ordered her dog again, who was sniffing the new toy box.
But they didn’t share the bed, not even platonically like they did in the beginning of Violet’s stay at Baker Street, when she refused to sleep in John’s old room, on John’s old bed. At Baker Street, she had often ended up crashing in Sherlock’s bed due to exhaustion or injuries, not because of any romantic inclinations.
“I live here too, William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
Victor closed his eyes.
Plus, she was running out of cash.
She held her left fist to her chest. “This doesn’t mean anything. You’re
need to see Molly with our own eyes to make sure she and the baby are alright.”
annoying illness. Completely inconvenient. Pah!” and he began a coughing fit. Then he  massaged his chest and flopped back into his chair . “This is irritating.”
John threw the drink down his throat. Blindly he handed the empty glass back to Dupin then gripped the nasty sofa for dear life.
“We did indeed,” Sherlock deterred him by presenting the bottle of expensive wine Violet had purchased the day before. Rucastle accepted the wine with a cry of joy and shook Sherlock’s hand instead. When Rucastle still looked a bit disappointed at being cheated out of his hug, Sherlock assuaged him by saying in a fawning voice no one realized he possessed, “What a lovely home you have.”
“And how’s this one?” John scratched Gladstone’s ears.
“You’re right. He is a mad dog, Peters. He would do something horrible like letting someone die in the dark with no food or water. He tried to drown Violet, remember?”
, but  walking with a definite purpose.
When she lived in New Mexico, she always flew back to Indiana to spend Thanksgiving with her grandmother. When she had lived in New York though, she couldn’t afford to fly home for both Thanksgiving and Christmas so she always threw “Orphan Thanksgiving” parties. Anyone and everyone who couldn’t afford to go home for the holiday was invited. All a guest had to bring was either a side dish or a bottle of booze. There were some years there were more booze than food. Those were always the best Orphan Thanksgiving parties.
“Don’t. Touch. That,” she said quietly.
,” John informed Dupin with a grin.
“Progress,” Violet looked out the window instead of John. “He’s a product of Cold War parents, a child raised to love Queen and Country and defend them both from all evil, real and imaginary. He’s also neo-conservative, practically Victorian in his beliefs.” She laughed silently through her nose. “I tricked him because he really believes that all women are naturally manipulative. That we’re not capable of anything else.” She rested her forehead on the window, closing her eyes in relief as the glass cooled her flushed brow. “He also believes everyone is out to get Sherlock. That people only come into his life to take something from him. The pattern has been pretty consistent, until you came along. Victor Trevor wanted his money, Molly Hooper wanted happily ever after. Greg Lestrade and all of NSY want him to solve the unsolvable cases. Irene Adler wanted to beat him, Jim Moriarty wanted to recruit him and Richard Brook wanted to
“Then we’ll still call her Maisie, OK?” Violet held Mary tight, knowing that her “American” was waving like the Stars and Stripes themselves, but she didn’t care. This woman desperately needed a hug.
“What happened in Paris and downstairs, that’s on me,” John immediately burst out but Sherlock waved him away.
Then she heard the swell of pipe organs and the scrape of chairs as people stood up.
“Mmmm… not so much that he told me, more like I deduced it, then confronted him, plus… well, the rumours. About her boy’s parentage,” Irene shook her head, somber now. “I do not envy that child. To be the son of a genius, it is a burden I would not wish upon my worst enemy.”
“It’s alright John,” Mary said in a high sing-song voice.
Sunday afternoon
,” there was an uncharacteristic sneer in John’s voice now. “When, for all we know, it was Mary who put a bullet in my sister’s head.”
“Once, twice, three times the lady, you are.”
“I do,” Moriarty warbled, “I really do. By the way, Detective-Inspector, it

.” With hazel eyes blazing, she added, “I’m not leaving you.”
“But yes, John, I am seriously telling you he overdosed on purpose, after he finally realized that Victor was going to go through with his marriage. Sherlock went to a dealer known for selling bad batches. He told me later, after he had recovered, he could tell  the drugs were bad by the unusual odor it made after he had cooked it. But he boiled it and injected it into his veins anyway. You see John,” Mycroft took a sip of tea, “Sherlock doesn’t disdain sentiment because he is naturally uncaring. He disdains it because he cares too much, which has always been to his disadvantage. He always had this stunning ability for selecting the absolutely wrong people to care about… until he met you, of course.”
“Only if you have some,” he pushed the plate back towards Sherlock.
“I need your belt to make a tourniquet for your leg, John.
“Well, fortunately for you, Mary has time to buy milk in-between murders and gestation,” Sherlock sniped back.
Speaking of the devil, Mrs. Toller stuck her head into the nursery. Her cloying perfume wafted into the room. Violet tried not to gag. “Almost time for Maths?” she asked conversationally.
“Mr. Trager, get a load of this guy,” Trager chuckled as he enthusiastically shook Sherlock’s hand. “Didn’t answer me though, how the hell you’ve been?”
“Yeah, me too,” he confessed.
What are you doing Sunday? - VT
She also discovered she had a green thumb. What was once overgrown grass and thistles now was an explosion of bergamot, columbine, snapdragons, purple tansies and hollyhocks. Later that summer, the sunflowers would bloom and ivy was already weaving its way through the picket fence. The bright cheerful colours made Janine think of fireworks. On her sagging porch and cracked stone steps, she had set out several pots of geraniums and lavender. Butterflies fluttered and bees hummed lazily around the pots. Poor old Alby got stung when he thought he could eat one.
But he didn’t leave before Sherlock nicked his credit card and his Rolex.
him.”
Worse of all, the bungling burglar clammed up. Wouldn’t say a damn word, wouldn’t even ask for a lawyer. Since Sherlock had made him confess he was with MI-6, Lestrade had nightmares about the paperwork about to be dumped onto his desk.
“Trust me, all you've really done in the long run is make my life a hell of a lot better than it was before. The only way you've ever harmed me was being dead. And you're not dead. Not anymore.”
The man's smile widened. “Oh, and here I was worried that it would be a dull evening.”
“There's more than one bomb,” he said. He was a wiry character, dark hair and eyes, in a white T-shirt that seemed pristine after the dirt and grime of the gallery. The man didn't seem to notice John, not really. He, like all of the other bystanders, was far too preoccupied to tear his eyes away from the spectacle. “They had been doing rescue work, but they found the other bomb, so they called everyone out till they could make it safe again.” John thought that the man seemed a little too happy about all this, but chocked it up to human beings being macabre and terrible, always gawking at the disaster, never able to look away.
It was later in the night when Sherlock finally stopped playing. John seized the opportunity.
"People go on and on about first sights.  The reality is that it's the second meeting, the third, the fourth, whichever one turns lamplight into starlight, that actually matters."
He had repeated Irene's words in his head over and over. Play the game, play the game. Be a proper piece in it, and maybe you stand a chance. John wasn't optimistic.
“No, you don't. We thought you were going to die. No one ever expects their tribute to come back.” Her hands dropped, and she crossed her arms over her chest. “You can't imagine what it all looked like from here. There were so many times we thought you'd be killed. And we had to see what the arena did to you. We saw you shouting at the sky. Some of us wondered if you would come back in one piece if you came back at all.” She paused, her eyes running over his face like she was looking for a wound, some big obvious physical manifestation of all he'd seen. “You should have seen the finale the way we did. That was the first time we thought you might come home. Because Sherlock Holmes seemed hell bent on making sure you did.”
“Yeah. Mine's in an old building. Creaky floors, heater that doesn't work too well, mismatched wallpaper and furniture. Yours actually looks like it belongs to a responsible adult.” He smiled, hoping it was convincing and self-deprecating enough to suit her.
Sherlock stared at him for a minute. He wanted to say nothing, that was clear enough. But the effect of this place, of this tiny, secluded little Grecian balcony, was far too strong. It had been drawing them out all night. The combination of location and a quiet, still night made it impossible to keep walls up where there should be none.
“Fine,” he said, hating how tired he sounded.
It was a slow few weeks, a marathon rather than a sprint toward recovery. Sherlock was a little foggy from the pain pills and generally seemed content to stay home rather than chase after criminals for a change. And thankfully, Sherlock didn't argue with John about hardly anything, actually listening when John would tell him to eat something or go to sleep.
"We sent a team up to the roof," he said, dropping his things on the desk. "There was a body up there. Richard Brook, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head."
“Yes.” A flick of the wrist, his universal sign for
. Because he was so alone, and so obviously had no idea how to truly cope with it. No human being really knows how to cope with being completely alone in the world, day after day, with no one happy to see you in the evening, no one to share morning coffee with, no one to sleep next to at night. Even John had felt that emptiness before, and the very thought of enduring it for decades the way that Sholto was sure to do sounded like the very definition of hell.
So be forewarned. It's extremely unpleasant.

I finally looked up from my book. "I'm afraid I don't quite know where you're going with this, Sebastian."
?” As he spoke, the twisted smile, the twisted face, it became someone else. The man from District 1, Jim Moriarty. He wore a crown like he had in the parade, and that false grin, that horrible grin, it became his entire field of vision. And the words came out like a hiss, “
He'd made a habit of checking in on Sholto, part of him worried that one day one of his hired hands would come inside and find him dead, hanging from a makeshift noose or clutching an empty pill bottle. John wouldn't even blame him, really. He'd had thoughts like those. But given what had happened in Afghanistan, John thought the least he could do was try and lift the isolation, even if only a little bit. And his life had been so hectic lately due to Sherlock that he'd fallen behind in his visits, and he hated himself for it. The worst thought was that a miserable and lonely man felt abandoned by one of the only people who spoke to him anymore.
John met his eyes, standing beside the extra easy chair. “I figured it was a gift. The book, I mean.”
“What song?”
He turned on his heel and left the room.
“It's not just
John laughed a little under his breath. Always so blunt. “I suppose not. Now that I think of it, I think the happiest memory from my teenage years was the second I quit being a teenager.”
"Would that bother you if that were the case?"
John understood.
He stared hard at me, his jaw set. "Do you understand how serious this is? Please, give me some hint that you do." Screaming would have been less chilling than the emptiness in his voice.
He was positive John didn't believe him.
“The dull education major.”
“I need something to keep him occupied,” he said, pointing upstairs.
“All that mess about us being friends and me being some sort of noble healer.” Sherlock only shrugged. “Playing the game, are we?”
.” His hand fell to the nape of John's neck. John tried to find the word for the look on his face, and when his brain supplied the word
“Those people haven't lived with you.” Sherlock opened his mouth, likely to dispute. “Don't.” John held a hand up and Sherlock fell silent, looking so small in the few feet of distance between them. “What are we going to do about this?”
With a little tilt of his head, Sherlock said, “I wouldn't have all that much to tell you anyway. Just as human beings are naturally selfish, human lives are naturally dull, usually.”
Sherlock didn't answer. “Why does
"I wonder how much else that applies to?" John was talking more to himself, in a sort of stream of consciousness. "We see but don't observe. We hear but don't listen. We talk but don't speak. And you don't even realize that's the case until you finally really observe or listen or speak."
Sherlock was barely awake, but still periodically he would hum bits and pieces of the same song, the sound fading in and out as he got drowsier.
He ran through a list of conditions in his head before he could stop himself, the doctor in him trying to regain control.
Sherlock knew damn well that John was there.
She made it a point to ignore the single tear that fell down his face.
But still, he couldn't shake the feeling, the coldness of never knowing, of never having any sort of emotional or mental closure about this or any of the conundrums that had puzzled him over the years.
John didn't tell him. He didn't say anything. He wasn't even sure he knew the answer. All he could do was pull him closer and let the whiskey wash away the night.
He took a deep breath. “Binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. There is always a primary star, and a second one, known as its companion star. Because of course every primary star must have a companion star. The orbit would be all wrong without it.”
John had grown used to Sherlock picking out details of his life. On the one hand, it could be infuriating, but on the other, at least he never had to make small talk about himself. “If I find you a violin will you quit trying to take apart my laptop?”
It wasn't an ugly painting either, and would have looked nice on the wall, even if he was the only one who ever saw it. But the jittery feeling in him still had horrible thoughts about police breaking down his door and arresting him for having it. So he knew that within hours he would banish it back to its suitcase in the back of the closet.
He turned off his phone entirely.
“I'm going outside for a minute. I need some air.” John pushed himself to his feet, picking the gun up off the ground before leaving the cave. He sat down on a fallen tree nearby, looking up at the early fake stars and waiting for the nightly fanfare.
“What is it?”
"Because I never let you hear the end of it," he said with a chuckle.
“No, I mean, there might be a documentary on somewhere. But that's a movie. There's more than one channel.”
at the Hickman that night. We've been in the papers, after all. Can't hide from the press all the time. I'm sure he knows we're looking into this case, too.”
“Well, dear, here you are,” she said, adjusting the brightness of one of her stars or planets near the horizon.
Liber Weekly:
John shook his head, tried to gesture that he couldn't take it, but the man continued to shove the ring at him. The man tried to sit up, nearly screaming in pain, and John reached out to take the ring from him, saying over and over, “Okay, okay.” The man leaned back, breathing deeply before grabbing John's hand in his and saying, “Baker Street. 221, by the shop.” John just nodded, placating.
John laughed under his breath. “Yeah, enemy fire doesn't really care what you told me.”
At which point their father, satisfied with the bruise forming on Harry's cheek, set forth in a tirade that lasted for nearly fifteen solid minutes, berating her, insulting her, cursing her, threatening her, all trying desperately to get a reaction from his daughter, frothing at the mouth like a dog. It was unclear at the time if his words were harming Harry, but they were certainly harming John as much as if their father had said them to him instead. Their mother cringed with every word, both desperate to intervene and knowing from nearly twenty years of this behavior that intervening when he was in this state would only make things worse.
The others were all talking, laughing. Sherlock didn't like it. The noise was annoying him. But he had at least shown up, against his better judgement. And John did look terribly happy that he had yet to alienate anyone.
John rolled his eyes. “I'll take that into consideration, thanks.” He stalked off to the kitchen for something to eat, saying over his shoulder, “We're going to Bart's in a while.”
“Maybe I don't want a public image.”
He leaned on his cane, even though the pressure of its handle had been making his palm ache. The limp, the pain, it had yet to go away. He was beginning to learn to live with it, just as he had learned to like art. He shoved his free hand into his coat pocket, balling it into a fist and breathing deeply, waiting for the spasm to pass. If he focused hard enough, he could turn his thoughts to something harmless, something mundane.
“You know, there's no sense in making things more bleak than they already are.”
“You seem about as surprised by that as he did.”
earlier, but he felt like he quite suddenly realized what
“Not important,” he said, smiling in a failing effort to remain polite. “Or relevant.”
The small greenhouse had the fewest missing panes of glass, and a ceiling that was only perhaps eight feet tall, and as a result, it seemed considerably warmer and more controlled. There were sleek metal tables on one end, and a proper cabinet that stored some of Sherlock's chemistry equipment. All over the small counter and the tables were small potted plants, some of which John recognized.
“So where the fuck have you been? Why weren't you returning any of my messages?”
By the time night truly arrived, they were both on edge. They stopped in what appeared to be a safe place in the woods – a relative term, of course – surrounded by small trees and brush.
Mary flopped down next to him. “Yes, the District will be crawling with Capitol morons, strutting around in the latest fashions,” she said, her voiced laced with disdain.
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
He slowly made his way up the steps to their flat. He always referred to it as
John sat in his seat on the Capitol hovercraft, looking at the other tributes. In such a set up, they looked like soldiers, waiting to be deployed. Across from him sat Molly, her hands visibly shaking. She winced when her tracker was inserted into her arm. Someone as sweet and sensitive as she appeared to be would last mere minutes in the arena.
“I wonder if she realizes I'm no longer in a relationship with her,” he said, more to himself than to Sherlock.
John hung up the phone and sighed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he looked back at his slide.
"It's true, though. We even act without thinking. We touch without feeling."
Harry watched John leave her apartment, and part of her wanted to follow him. He was walking straight, yes, but she knew he wasn't in the best of ways tonight. She also knew that if she tried to keep tabs on him that it would only make him mad. So she let him walk away.
“Are you really going to pull that card?”
Once he was standing in front of the closet, though, he couldn't think of anything else besides the painting tucked away in the suitcase in the back. He dragged the case out to the middle of the room and flipped it open, teasing away the wrappings surrounding it and gingerly lifting the painting out to set it on the bed. He stood over it, hands in his pockets, looking over the brushstrokes wondering how something so small and subdued could cause so much trouble. It had been a burden of sorts from day one, initially being this massive secret he had to bear on his own, and then it had nearly cost him the love of his life.
“Things have changed since your time, Sherlock.”
,” he said as if the word was in a difficult foreign language. “You realize of course that it is highly unlikely that someone could successfully murder someone with a hat.”
“And remember, don’t kill the copper, just the wife.”
“Us? Nah, we’re just a bunch of mechanics who are Harley enthusiasts.”
The first Thanksgiving without her dad had been incredibly painful, but even though she had been a sullen teenager at the time, she had been grateful to spend the holiday at her grandparents’ farm. It had been an oasis of familiarity after her entire life had been turned into a desert wasteland.
while wrapping his free arm around her thin shoulders to support her. Violet came so hard, she actually bit Sherlock on the shoulder to keep from screaming. He paid her back by nearly crushing her in his embrace as he convulsively jerked and pulsed inside her.
“It won’t be,” Sherlock snarled.
Gladstone just licked John’s hand and thumped his tail up and down on the sofa.
“Oh for heaven’s sake…negative two.”
“Well,” Violet swallowed hard then shrugged. She started digging through the messenger bag that sat on the flimsy dresser. “That would have solved a lot of problems and saved a lot of time then, wouldn’t it?”
And Lestrade gave it to her. “You look like hell.”
The best she could do was to pay off the people next to her to keep quiet, leave her alone and also to alert her if anyone shady was snooping around her room. She threatened the occupants of the room to her left with deportation if they talked about her or about the money she gave them. The occupant to her right was the wary man with the toddler. She threatened to call DHS, his scared face becoming more pinched, confirming her suspicion he had kidnapped the boy.
She put the pictures back in the black metal box and rose, grimacing as pins and needles ran up and down her left leg. “Shit,” she muttered as she limped over to the nightstand, where she had left her mobile and now cold mug of coffee.

“You’re leaving me.”
“Walking helps me think,” Dupin shrugged.  Just then the pretty waitress-street performer
The only sound was the pair of them, breathing heavily.
She had found the email from Sherlock with the attachment containing the incriminating pictures. She quickly forwarded them to “Sally”, then deleted the original email, the forwarded email, then emptied the hotmail trash folder. Then she logged out of the email address and disabled the Wi-Fi on the iPad.

Violet felt her stomach lurch up into her throat, then bounce down to her feet.
SO I was feeling a LITTLE sorry for myself last week because I didn't understand why I wasn't getting many comments... until I realized I completely blew off posting because of the holiday last weekend.... whoops! lol  :^D
Second floor, first flat on the left.
Violet blanched then whispered, “Great-Aunt Verity.”
“Yes sir?”
, all of us. After I got over myself, after I stopped being pissed off about Sherlock lying about being dead, everything was right with the universe. I had everything, everything I wanted. I had my best friend and my best girl, then a baby on top of it. I literally cannot remember a time I was happier. Then Lady Smallwood came to Sherlock, asking him to take her case and…” he scrubbed his eyes then his nose. “Right now, I don’t know what pisses me off more, knowing what that
“Hey, I found a light switch,” Trager’s voice cut through the gloom.
There was a frightened sob, then unintelligible mumbling.
Inside the fire station, Sherlock emerged from the van like a conquering hero, never being able to resist adding a dramatic touch to the situation. “Oh yes, and he’s not treating her very well either, Mr. Latimer,” he added quite conversationally as he hopped off the van bumper. He was sorry he wasn’t wearing his great coat. It would have added another theatrical flair to have it fan around him as he jumped down. He strolled around the van, his eyes dark and dangerous. His full lips twisted up into a mean, condescending little smile. “Obvious by her depleted bank account and the bruises she tries to hide when she goes to the shops.”
“He filled the bathtub with live koi fish last summer,” Violet  burst out before she could help herself as everyone else got comfortable and Mrs. Hudson came out with the promised freshly brewed pot of tea (and a cup of coffee for Violet) and the platter of nibbles. “And don’t even get me started about the bloody spider.”
“Ah, excellent,” Sherlock said crisply as John stood next to him. “That order of business is concluded. I do believe you have something to say, Inspector Clouseau?”
Always running away from
Amused, Violet grinned, “The Great Misogynist thinks a fashion designer is a sexist.”
Get out so he could start the search for his own daughter.
“Of course, I have contacts all over the world. I have an international reputation.”
“I didn’t have anything to do with that,” Anthea whimpered.
“I’ll explain later, we need to find Sally now. It’s so much worse now, if Peters is involved,” Sherlock whirled around, snatched the key from Mrs. Algar’s hand.
“Terrifying?”
“I’m taking you back to Mycroft’s.”
But never to touch and never to keep
“Demographics,” she proclaimed. “The Midwest was mostly settled by Europeans, primarily Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch and German immigrants.”
“Given a choice between freedom and protection, which do you think the people will choose?” Sherlock continued to cut away at the Prime Minister’s letter.
“Oh, so you found a way to get rid of over a hundred thousand dollars in cash from drug mules and protection running? Good for you, I’ll just be on my way now.”
… but… always… she wanted more and it was always what he could not give her.
“Ah. What gave it away? She favors her mother.”
He recalled Appledore and immediately felt sick.
Her disappearing act was getting pretty old pretty quickly.
“They usually don’t move the body to the morgue until the parents have a chance to say goodbye. They’ll move it to a personal room so they can have a moment of privacy, but they don’t just ship an infant straight to the morgue. I went into the little room we use for…moments like that, to get it ready for Dr. Watson to say his goodbyes. His wife was still unconscious… but when I went in… there was no body. Maggie, someone took her, I know it.”
, he thought savagely. His sudden possessiveness frightened him a bit, but the idea of Sherlock sharing his life with someone that was not him frightened him even more.
, don’t you?”
The driver turned his attention back to the road, making an illegal U-turn. Ignoring the barrage of car horns and inappropriate finger gestures, the van trundled down the road.
“It’s not legal.”
There was a pause then Sapphire said in her cheery voice, “No problem, I should be back by then, but if not, I’ll get it covered.”

Despite her years in England, some slang words still threw Violet.

Mycroft regally inclined his head, as the man he was, the man he strove to be.

I am super sleepy... will respond to comments asap.. but thank you thank you thank for leaving them! XOXO
She nodded. “So, you’re completely booked up until 2050?”
More feels and a trigger warning about suicide....
“She’s holding back,” John mused to himself then asked, “Is it because of her fiancé, the one who died in the World Trade Center attacks?”
That left the Midwest, the Southwest and West.
After a cautious peek into the refrigerator to make sure there wasn’t something horrible festering in there (like body parts), Violet started putting the groceries away. She had just finished putting the milk, cheese, lettuce, yoghurt and fruit away when Mrs. Hudson came into the kitchen, still talking away. “… maybe make some nice sarnies and heat up some soup?”
It took Violet a moment to realize he wasn’t making a snide, rhetorical question.
Sherlock strolled rather than rushed towards the pool, flicking lights on in every room he entered. He sensed a trap was being carefully laid out  just for him.
Then there were kids just had the shit-bad luck of being born to asshole parents. Parents that would rather get high or get drunk than to get a job and take care of their kids, content to lounge around while their kids shambled through the parking lot instead of going to school. Parents that didn’t give a shit that their sons were being recruited into gangs or that their daughters were being vetted for prostitution.
A formation in which a queen backs up two rooks on the same file.
After the former prospect scurried away, slipping on the icy concrete, Green had grinned at her. This one had sass. He liked sass.
“Just, don’t tell the boys,” Mrs. Hudson pleaded faintly, the strain wearing her out. “Not yet at any rate. They’re so busy with the case and all. I don’t want to worry them.”
She moved excruciatingly slowly. Halfway up the seventeen steps to 221B, Violet had to pause, her arms and legs trembling with the effort. Then she reminded herself that Mrs. Hudson had broken a rib in the explosion and told herself to stop being such a baby.
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Shaking from head to foot, she retreated to her desk, her eyes looking for anything that could be used as a weapon. Spying her letter opener, she grabbed it and clasped it like a dagger.
But, Lucy had a dazzling smile and craved hugs and kisses. She liked her dollies and her stuffed animals, especially a pink bunny that grew more and more bedraggled every day with every hug and every kiss. She giggled more and more as she grew more secure in her new surroundings. She also was becoming more and more vocal, finally babbling like a normal sixteen-month old, getting closer to saying “Mama” and “Dada” every day now.
Any trace of the Mary Watson Violet knew was gone. There was no sign of the plucky, witty nurse who egged John and Sherlock on in their adventures. There was also no sign of the stone-cold killer who showed herself to Violet last night either.
whore.
,” Violet still sounded flippant, as if she could see Sherlock’s grimace.
“Ah, perfect timing,” Rucastle maintained a bright and cheery voice for his son but the look he gave the skinny, unhappy woman was not a nice one.
“Pray, do not keep me in suspense, do tell.”
,” Lestrade’s smile suddenly became mischievous, “You
“He was the best man for the job,” Mycroft jutted his chin up. “My brother obviously forgot to mention that there was supposed to be an air mattress. It was supposed to be staged, for the onlookers and for the CCTV cameras.”
“Ecstatic,” Violet deadpanned.
Sherlock placed the violin on his shoulder. Facing the window, he started playing
“I can’t wait to stay here permanently. I sleep better here than there, that’s for certain,” John reluctantly got to his feet.
Victor thought but didn’t worry about it. He had bigger plans ahead. “Of course we would take care of Edward in your absence. Leigh would be delighted. She would have someone around to play with.”
“Former junkie, remember,” Sherlock muttered, tightening his grip. “I know my way around a needle, now sit still.” True to his word, Sherlock expertly pulled the IV from John’s vein smoothly with very little pain. He quickly fished out a snowy white handkerchief out of his trouser pocket. He let the needle and tubing drop to the floor as he pressed his handkerchief to the tiny puncture wound in the thin skin of John’s hand. As John pressed the handkerchief to his palm, Sherlock located Elastoplast in the innocuous looking drawers that apparently held medical supplies. Before John could blink or utter another word, Sherlock had taken the handkerchief away and bandaged John’s hand as quick and neat as one could please.
Then he saw Violet standing in the doorframe, pointing a shotgun at the group. He reached over, roughly grabbed Chibs by the shirt collar and jerked him down to the floor as he ducked.
“Mary!” she cried out, shocked at Mary’s appearance.
The Woman
“Yes.”
John held his hands up, “My name is Dr. Watson. I’m a friend of Sherlock Holmes. He asked me to come over to take a look at you. I understand you’ve been feeling poorly?”
Paris, France
Apparently, now was not the time. Obviously.
Enjoy! :^)
It’s nearly quarter past eight, judging by the shadows caused by the rising sun. You have a big day ahead
“Thanks a lot,you dick.”
“Yeah, I did mean it. I do mean it,” John felt his heart starting to speed up as again the same refrain starting repeating in his head
Doyle, A. C., & Morley, C. (1930). The Adventure of the Reigate Squire. The complete Sherlock Holmes. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday & Co
There was a rap on the door. Lestrade ran a hand over his silvery head as the door opened. A young woman stuck her head in. “Sir?” she held up three blue envelopes, heavily embossed with official seals. “Waiting on these?”
Violet instead decided to teach him simple arithmetic by using coins.  Practical as always, Violet had decided if she was going to be stuck being this little monster’s tutor, she might as well teach him something useful.
“I don’t want you to leave,” he admitted.
“Yes sir,” she didn’t need to be told twice.
“Yes, yes, yes, the powerful bond of siblings and all that rubbish. The Letter was never stolen, you gave it to her.”
“That’s not so bad, I guess,” Archie said dubiously. “But… do they have to be in French? The post cards?”
But she told Violet how she had also freelanced for the CIA and MI-6 when everything went topsy-turvy in Mother Russia… then when things truly went to shit in Russia, she had faked her death, assumed the ‘Mary Morstan’ identity and had lived quietly in London for years… until she met John Watson, of course.
“Well, now you don’t have a choice,” Violet informed him. ”We’re going to the doctor tomorrow. After that, your ass is not moving from this bed,” she tapped the blankets with her pointer finger “Until you’re better.”
“You are such a child,” the smile left Mycroft’s face now. “Selfish and spoilt. Sherlock is in hospital but not for rehabilitation. He collapsed this morning from dehydration and malnutrition.”
Saltine crackers
“Is it really?”
Violet felt like she just got run over by a double-decker bus.
“Yes,” Violet nodded as she massaged her sore scalp. “We had Lady Hilda call, pretending to be Julia. She missed her calling in life. She really should have been an actress.”
She looked up at him and gave him a smile. She hoped he could deduce what she was thinking:
If he walked away, Heathcliff would know he could still
John’s eyes flew wide open now.
Tell me I'm right...
Sherlock, of course, didn’t need to be reminded about his promise to talk to Violet about Mary. He waved John off and waited for Lestrade to start berating him.
Sherlock snapped his attention fully back onto Victor.
He then immediately thought of snow, rough, salty kisses and the shadow of Notre Dame. He ordered himself to focus. “As does my fiancée, although one would not believe it to look at her,” he added lightly. “Always a lady in public but if she stubs her toe in private, she could make Ozzy Osbourne blush.”
“Technology is an amazing thing,” Mycroft murmured as he pressed buttons on his mobile. “This style of mobile won’t be on the market for another two years. But it’s bloody marvelous. Everyone will want one. It’s like a little computer that fits in the palm of my hand. I can play solitaire, I can write a message and send it to another mobile instead of calling, I can pull up a map, I can keep a diary, what else, ohhh
Feels... lots and lots of feels...
So Sherlock knew he couldn’t touch John now, because he wouldn’t be able to stop. Considering that John’s wife could be a bit…murdery, probably not a good idea to touch him as he slept, even if it was innocent as removing a bit of fluff from his silvery-blond hair.
The intruder raised the crow bar then paused, considering. He knew he could cave the copper’s thick skull in with one swing. But his instructions had been quite clear.
A tongue-in-cheek joke regarding being nicknamed
“Take the phone,” Mary ordered him when a tinny “hello?” emitted from the tiny speakers.
“Since when has either one of you been
John cupped Violet’s face. It felt clammy. He reached under her chin and slid his fingers down her neck, searching for her pulse. When he found it, it was racing. John hoped it was because of the adrenaline flooding her body. John licked his lips and asked Sherlock. “Why would Rucastle want me out of the way?”
” John raised his voice again. “Alone doesn’t protect you!”
“Yes, right,” Victor was also nonplussed. They all got out of the paddle pool, conscious of the parents and children’s eyes on them.
Sarcasm does not become you.
“They’ll just be replaced with other assassins. Whatever is left of Moriarty’s organization, they all believe you are the only one who has the Moriarty Code. They have been ordered to shoot to kill. If they learn than Sherlock actually does know the code, then he won’t be safe either.”
“Hook,” Irene sashayed around Doña Nalda’s big, scrubbed table, her filmy green dressing gown floating behind her. “Line,” she pulled out the chair in front of Violet. “And sinker. Amazing the results one can get from a ball-gag and a good riding crop.”
A cursory glance reassured Sherlock that she was not armed.
“No,” Violet finally saw Mycroft’s pressure point, his vulnerability. She read through the lines of his question clearly:
Happy Fourth of July!
He immediately felt ashamed of his earlier pity party in his old room at 221B.
She took another look at the old woman with the sky-blue eyes. Sky-blue, almond-shaped eyes…
Soon Violet returned downstairs, wearing a black tank top, khakis shorts, black trainers and sunglasses. Her wet hair was severely braided into a tight plait down her back. She snatched up her handbag, told Sherlock, “Enjoy your sweat lodge,” and grabbed her black ball cap off its hook by the door and left, slamming the door.
L Train, State and Division Stop
Sherlock’s brows narrowed. “Your room had been ransacked.”
Sherlock nodded and darted off. John flicked the safety off and crept along the wall, weirdly reminded of the first time he attempted roller-skating as a child. How he had clung to the wall like a spider, so afraid of falling.
As much as she hated to admit it, falling off the train instead of leaping off like she wanted to only proved she did not have the stamina to break into the black site herself.
“I’m the wrong gender.”
with this much power, this sinister little series of 0s and 1s.
The game is afoot.
“N-n-no,” he stuttered, feeling like a fool. But concentration was extremely difficult at the moment. His rescuer’s looks and build really were breathtakingly distracting.
John reached between the cushions. “Safety’s on,” he handed her his Army Browning.
Mary sidled up to John and put her free hand into his. He squeezed gently.
He acutely missed Sherlock’s long stretches of silence. He hadn’t been kidding when he said he could go for days without speaking. Sometimes… it had been nice. Sitting in the lounge in companionable stillness, John reading the newspapers, Sherlock thinking.
“My brother, Victor, decided to try to  take his own life. Needless to say, it was one of the few times he failed in one of his endeavours .”
perhaps?”
on her iPad.
Violet had taken one look at what Rucastle and Mrs. Toller expected her to teach the boy and threw the lesson plan straight into the bin. A six-year-old does not need to learn about
what you’re doing to me. So just do it, do what you like. Destroy yourself. Just don’t expect me to watch anymore.”
Still… he couldn’t help imagining another blonde-haired girl, a different girl, a much younger girl, a toddler,
“Heroes don’t exist.”
they would,” John had then screwed his eyes shut and quietly began an internal dialogue. Reminded himself that yes, rabies injections are a medical necessity because they didn’t know where the dog was.
“John,” Sherlock sounded slightly annoyed now. “I’ve already told you I’m not.”
Violet nodded in response to Mary’s question. “Go around the corner, the parking lot is right behind the building, away from prying eyes.”
Startled, still not used to being called by her married name, Molly looked up from her computer screen, wide-eyed. She relaxed when saw the insufferable Dr. Jamison Bodley, King of the Malapropism, standing in the doorway. His entire body took up the doorway, actually.
“Oh, is the stress of the job getting to you then?” Sherlock put his hands behind his back, looking innocently inquisitive.
“You… her… both…” he blustered.
Her “Violet Smith” costume was quite extensive. Her naturally curly dishwater blonde hair was religiously colored a soft chestnut shade of red that looked quite natural. If she had time, she straightened her hair but if not, she usually pulled back into a neat little bun at the nape of her neck. She had learned which cosmetics to buy and how to apply them so her freckles would stay concealed. She wore fake eyeglasses or enormous sunglasses to hide her hazel eyes.
Violet always hovered over his broad shoulder whenever he Skyped with Bill Wiggins and Trinity back in 221B Baker Street or when he chatted with “Wasp” as “Bambi” in one of the secure chat rooms in the Hackers Republic as they exchanged information.
“A bit, yes,” she did admit however.
“Oh for pity’s sake!” Sherlock exploded then coughed. “I know I am still ill and would only be a hindrance at this point. John’s coming by later with an update on the Burned Girls case. I will have plenty to do, plenty to keep my mind and time occupied.”
Sherlock felt his core grow cold.
He flung open the door and fled for his life.
Now she used his feet as a book rest as she tried to read a trashy romance novel she picked up at the train station. Something fluffy to read, just to pass the time; it was a five hour train ride from London to Cornwall, after all.
To his utter frustration, Sherlock looked like the lazy housecat he always had been…
“Yes.”
“Why do you say that?”
Sherlock sat in his chair, reading and mostly ignoring the other guests. There weren't too many, of course. Molly, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Mike. Sherlock couldn't help but notice the lack of John's most recent girlfriend. Another woman, left in John Watson's wake.
Around midnight, John was woken up by what sounded like a knock on the door. He rolled over, thinking he'd ignore it, if it was indeed real and not a sleepy hallucination, but he heard it again, more persistent. He sat up, confused and tired.
a part of Moriarty's network. The painting was a bullet point on his to-do list that he never reached. Since he's dead, I have to look out for myself now, and even if you can't sell it, having a priceless work of art holds a lot of sway in the criminal world. After all, a girl can't count on a man to support her, can she? She has to find her own sources of job security. And this? This is a lot more fun than giving people shots and checking blood pressures.”
“Honestly, Mary, I'm going to need a little bit of time.”
Sherlock shrugged. “We are all incapable of escaping certain nostalgic aspects of our youths.” He paused, on the verge of saying something more, but no words came.
John swallowed hard, lowering his gun. All he could see when he looked at him was Molly. This was the man she'd spoken so fondly of. This was the person she'd practically considered family.
“Shame about that little girl, no? But I bet it made for a
“What do you mean?”
“Better?”
was honest.
"Sure, John. Go home, get some rest. We'll talk later. Or rather, you'll talk to whoever they fill my place with." John stood to leave, and as he did, he glanced over Lestrade's desk at the evidence bags.
Sherlock shrugged. "I didn't have cause to. Growing up, our family was very formal, and Christmas was not particularly enjoyable. When I was older, I spent most Christmases alone. It's not as if I had a warm reunion with Mycroft every year. Holidays are supposed to be about spending time with loved ones, yes?"
“Can't reveal all the mysteries, now can I?” As always, such remarks were universally beloved by his over-eager fans. Cleverness was a low bar for most of them.
"A great sorrow, and one I am only beginning to understand: we don't get to choose our own hearts. We can't make ourselves want what's good for us or what's good for other people. We don't get to choose the people we are...Only here's what I really, really want someone to explain to me. What if one happens to be possessed of a heart that can't be trusted? What if the heart, for its own unfathomable reasons, leads one willfully and in a cloud of unspeakable radiance away from health, domesticity, civic responsibility and strong social connections and all the blandly-held common virtues and instead straight towards a beautiful flare of ruin, self-immolation, disaster? Is [she] right? If your deepest self is singing and coaxing you straight toward the bonfire, is it better to turn away?...Set yourself on the course that will lead you dutifully towards the norm, reasonable hours and regular medical check-ups, stable relationships and steady career advancement, the New York Times and brunch on Sunday, all with the promise of being somehow a better person? Or is it better to throw yourself head first and laughing into the holy rage calling your name?"
John laughed. “Nothing, mostly. Getting by?”
It had been an ideal vanishing act. But it made these returns all the more unendurable, which was why one of the conditions to his coming to the intervention was that he would not stay at any of their homes. He couldn't tolerate being under the same roof as his father for any real length of time. Staying with Clara and Harry would arouse suspicion; Harry was cynical and realistic enough to know that John wouldn't venture to his homeland without reason. So he went past their family home in Glastonbury, farther out into the countryside he so despised. So dark, so quiet, so unrelenting and still. If only the constant daylight of London and his flat could somehow be bottled and transported.
“If anyone could cheat death, it would be him.”
I was unsure how I was supposed to feel about this. John, like Sebastian, was defending his heterosexuality with vigour, and as ever, I could see through him. But unlike Sebastian, I truly enjoyed the doctor's company. I did not want him to turn on me as others had. So I let him maintain his fiction. Just as I maintained mine.
It wasn't morning fog.
“Either grab a glass or shut up, Sherlock.”
her. But he was going through the motions, and he knew well enough that sometimes if you went through the motions long enough, it quit being an act and finally became reality.
“He bounced back easily enough. He's tougher than people think.”
“Nearly, although I had to make some adjustments to account for the changes made since my time.”
“It's never nothing.”
Sherlock walked along the pavement by the Thames, hands deep in his coat pockets. The flat had become claustrophobic, and he had hoped being out in the open in the city would counteract the effect. It hadn't. If anything he felt more closed in by the hoards of people that apparently flooded the streets at night when he was ordinarily shut up at home behind closed curtains. When had he become such a recluse?
He smiled, almost on reflex and said, “Yes.”
So he walked slowly through the woods, as quietly as he could manage. He stuck to sections of woods heavy with evergreens, fewer leaves to crunch beneath his feet and more cover should another tribute appear.
“You're not very likeable, Mr. Holmes. I know you both think I've spent my years since my Games in a drugged haze, but I listen, and I know what people think about you. They're about as fond of you as they are of your half-brother.” Mycroft rolled his eyes at her. “You're cold and superior, and that sort of attitude won't win you any sponsors. Take John for example. He's a healer who volunteered to save his sister. He's warm and friendly. The public will love him. You don't smile, you barely even speak, and most of your District thinks you've sold them out at one point or another. And I have to find a way to make you as likeable as John.”
“I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?”
After a long silence, John said, “I just hate that we've been avoiding each other lately.”
“Wait,” John said, sitting up straighter. “Were you there? When I shot that mine?”
“Same as the others, years of work and experimentation.”
"You share some similarities with 007 yourself."
“Never. There's no need.” John couldn't help but feel the anxiety start to brew inside of him again, a nervousness that he had always associated so much with the painting. But he watched as Sherlock got that
“Multiple sponsors, apparently.”
She nodded. “I used to play when I was younger. I don't know if it will suit him, but he's welcome to it. Are you two getting along all right?”
John had even teared up. And not only that, but had stood and hugged him in the middle of it all. For the first time all day, Sherlock felt like he could breathe. The sensation vanished when John sat back down.
Sherlock smiled. “And I'm positive you continued to read it even long after giving up hope of using it as a Rosetta stone. What caught your attention?”
Sherlock saw John standing to walk toward the desk before he had made it all the way down to Earth. By the time he was actually in the room, the gun was in his hand. He closed the distance and grabbed it.
But it shouldn't be so near a lamp, he decided, and he got to his feet to pick the painting up from the dresser, setting it on the bed for a moment while he dragged out his largest suitcase. He left some clothes in it for padding, but threw most of the contents onto the room's floor. Gently, he lifted the painting and lowered it into the suitcase, putting a few more articles of clothing on top of it to cushion it. He zipped the suitcase and slid it under the bed. There. No damage from light or heat or anything.
“With anyone else, I wouldn't,” he answered, immediately regretting the slip of honesty. John never seemed to mind those honest moments, but Sherlock did. They were all risks.
“I'm also not much for emotional stands, either.”
“And this program, it is not fiction?”
Even though special exhibitions like this one were usually more crowded, the crowd was still expected to speak in hushed voices and make no sudden movements, so John believed it would be safe.
The two men stared each other down, fuming.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Even though the shouting and noise continued, it all fell to silence in John's ears, replaced by the once-familiar ringing, the signal of
“Yeah. Most kids here spend their lives trying to sneak in,” he said with a smirk. “Very few are successful.”
They walked to the theater, mostly in silence. John never minded silence with Sherlock. When he was with any member of his procession of girlfriends, he always felt like the silence needed to be filled, that the absence of conversation was just making the tension build between them. But with Sherlock, every silence was comfortable. There was no malice in it. Sherlock of all people knew how unnecessary empty talking was. It was a trait that had initially thrown John off guard. He was not accustomed to peace and quiet in his life. And then he'd moved in with someone who could literally go the entire day without uttering a word. And he'd discovered he enjoyed it.
“How tragic.”
He scanned the familiar shelves and pulled out a book,
He held her hand, and within a minute, she was dead, the light vanishing from her eyes.
. Not in the middle of a crisis in Rome, but in their flat with no intruding police lights and sirens, no shouting human voices, nothing but a pristine silence that almost had its own sound. John had never noticed that silence until they both gave up speaking, and while he was aware of it now, he was more aware of his hands on Sherlock's jaw and how alive Sherlock felt with his breath catching, the hesitance and hint of fear that emanated from him. This privacy that they had always wanted and never had that was more perfect than John could ever have imagined. He felt like it must be a dream, because people only get everything they want in dreams, but no, it was real and divine and he was so filled with love that his chest ached, and he didn't even entertain the thought that Sherlock might not feel the same way. Because he knew he did. He could tell. He could find his evidence in the catching breath and the fingers that reached out to his hand and how he leaned forward in his seat like he wanted no space between them, like a person who put their face underwater, not caring if they'd drown.
“Thanks,” John said lamely.
Copper Beaches tonight.
Sherlock stood at the ladder base, changed the angle of it then steadied it, “Right, then. Up you go.” There was a loud crash behind them as another part of the ceiling collapsed.
“Shall I tell Noelie to stop being subtle then? Should “Violet Hunter” be seen now in Lausanne?”
“The gun, please,” the Earl said pleasantly, still leaning on John’s old cane. He stretched out his free hand, his hideously scarred hand. “There’s a guard outside. If you murder me, he’ll hear the shot, make the call to have what’s left of your family terminated and you’ll be taken to the closest American military base. They have a surprisingly low tolerance for terrorists these days. Also, I doubt you’ll retain any protection you’ve been enjoying from my country if you kill a lord.”
** Sherlock's internal complaint about "emotional qualities" is found in "The Sign of Four."
“Look, I’m sorry. I know you loved your grandsons. But Richard Brook was mentally ill, he had a severe case of obsessive-compulsion disorder coupled with a narcissistic tendenc-”
“We’ll make it,” Mary squeezed his right arm. The left arm was still encased in a plaster cast. She bit her lip; another facial expression of hers that John had originally thought was cute. “Sherlock met me for lunch today. Well, I mean, he saw me at the canteen at Bart’s and I ate lunch and he watched. OK that came out a bit creepy,” she ran her fingers through her short platinum ringlets, which she was growing out. The longer curls suited her, softened her face.
“I hope you didn’t pack the kettle,” a rolling baritone drawled behind her and she jumped, nearly spilling her water.
The Royal Hospital of St Bartholomew
“I can’t… there is a dog staring at us.”
“Practical, perhaps,” he strolled around the dull, stainless steel desk then leaned against the front. Arms crossed, he stared down at Anthea, “Logical, no. You know everything about Operation Cossette. The time it would take to get another agent trained on how to handle this delicate situation would be just enough time for Sherlock and John to find the child. The minute John Watson locates his daughter then Mary Morstan would steal her and disappear.”
“He won’t know.”
“Because only then, did he felt safe, of course,” Mycroft muttered. “Because with Moriarty, my brother and me out of the way, Magnussen thought he could control Moriarty’s people.”
Violet rolled her eyes and held out her hand. “Humor me. Come down and put on some socks.”
“When?”
Violet paled. “I’d prefer you didn’t.”
“Mmm… and why did you part ways?”
“Right. So… now what?”
“No. I had been awake for some time now. The Work waits for no man.”
“Justine isn’t married but has been living with her boyfriend for two years now. She’s also childless. Why hasn’t Father Dearest asked her to come home?”
“She doesn’t like him.”
There was that murderous wife of his that Mycroft still needed to deal with… somehow…
Happy Sunday! Have a great week  :^)
What he missed was companionship,
Members Only
Staring down the barrel of her gun, he nodded frantically.
I will definitely miss.”
Violet didn’t flinch. She met his gaze head-on. Whenever she told someone she cared about the truth, and wanted them to know it was the truth, she always looked them straight in the eye. “He blames himself, John.” She kept her voice firm yet gentle as she continued,” For everything that has been happening to you.”
best interest to go?”
“DI Walter Mason and Sally Donovan are missing, have been for over 48 hours now.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock still kept his voice down. “Under continual guard, all of whom appear to be devotees of the deceased rock star. That’s how they rotate the guards out, of course. One tourist appears and stays until the next change of guard. Presumably there’s some sort of password in play so the current guards can tell the difference between the actual tourists and replacements.”
“You wiretapped the telephones belonging to Members of the
“Stone,
“No,” Sherlock crouched down beside her, placing his fingers on her throat to check her pulse. “It’s her sister and she’s wanted for murder.”
“So you didn’t find the prepaid mobile in my office while we held you there before escorting you to solitary confinement?” Mycroft asked silkily, putting the mobile and file back on the cluttered coffee table. “Did you really think I would allow you to die in the field, Little Brother?”
Saw how a tangle of red, blue and green wires wrapped around her body.
“Ah,” Mycroft picked up his tea cup again. “She has a strange moral code, Hunter.”
It was lovely, light and spritely but there was an undercurrent of something sad and unspoken…
Mycroft stood in the middle of the darkened old building, leaning on his umbrella. Even by the dim light, Sherlock could tell his elder brother had dressed for the occasion, a three-piece suit complete with a tie, despite the sweltering heat. As he got closer however, Sherlock perceived Mycroft’s suit was made from a nice cotton-linen blend, in deference to what the meteorologists had started calling “The Great Drought of 2015.”
Yes, it was a pretty little English town dying a pretty little death as the larger cities cannibalized its most precious of resources: its young people.

“Senator Woodhouse’s autopsy report, the original autopsy report that was leaked to the press, not the falsified one that had been sent to the CIA in order to make them believe that the Senator had been murdered,” Sherlock airily informed him. “Oh, and once I proved that Violet was in Washington DC metro area, Fairfax to be exact and nowhere near New York, where the Senator slit his own wrists in order to avoid the shame Moriarty had in store for him, the CIA lost interest in questioning her. Imagine that.”
Look on his tiny face as Mrs. Hudson cuddled him and cooed at him in baby talk.
John finally cracked a smile.
Have a wonderful pre-holiday week! XOXO
Alex had slipped in behind them. “No forced entry,” she quietly to John as Sherlock stalked over to the sofa, stood on it, hands on hips and surveyed the room.

She knew she would happily sign her soul over to the Devil Himself for just one more… one more kiss, one more hug, one more miracle, one more
Mary parted the trousers like curtains. She smiled down at the wan-faced teenager who held her knees to her chest. “I think you’ve had a bit of a shock, my dear,” Mary reached down to cup the girl’s face, frowning to feel how clammy it was. “Let’s get you out of here,” she said practically, helping the girl out of the wardrobe. But the girl wobbled on her feet so Mary guided her to the bed. Spying Sherlock’s third-best dressing gown, she scooped it up and draped it over Susan. “The lounge is a bit of a wreck at the moment,” she rubbed the girl’s back, partially to warm her up and partially to calm her down. “How would you like to stay with John and me tonight? We can come for your things tomorrow and have you move in properly then, yeah?”
She hadn’t intended on killing him, but upon seeing that, she gladly pulled the trigger. Twice. Once in the crotch then again in the chest.
Not the fancy Smartphone Sherlock had purchased for her last spring after it had gotten ruined when she had fallen (… been pushed…) into the Thames. But a boring little black flip-phone, a pre-pay. A gift.
“Errr, yes, of course. Until Toller returns with Sherlock. Then you need to go back to your room.”

She placed her steady hands over his tremulous ones. Her nails were manicured and lacquered a pretty feminine rosy-pink, but her palms were rough and callused.
“Violet?” Michael Hunter croaked from his prison cell. “Sis, is that you?” His emaciated, freckled face erupted into a huge smile. “I knew it, I fucking knew it. You’re
But when she reached the top step and had to stop to dry-heave, she knew she needed a bathroom fast. She forced herself to run, barely able to remember which room they had put her and Sherlock in. Gladstone stayed right on her heels, whining the entire time.
“Indeed.”
As if John could read his thoughts, he asked “But do you want to see him again? Victor?”
“Fuck,” John thudded the back of his head against the stall wall. Then he repeated the motion and the swearing: “Fuck, fuck, fuck,
Following Nimzowitsch's idea, a move with a rook that seems to have no threat or purpose, but which actually discourages the opponent from a certain type of action (prophylaxis), or sets up a very deep, well-concealed plan.
“Your true accent, while grating, is far less annoying than your false British accent,” Sherlock jabbed at her but there was no venom in his voice. He left the small blowtorch on the coffee table and disappeared into his bedroom. Gladstone, having heard “Dog” and “Walk” and “Out”, leapt off the sofa and followed Sherlock down the hall towards the bedroom. Soon (but not soon enough for Violet,) Sherlock and Gladstone emerged. Sherlock’s shirt was buttoned up properly and in deference to the wet weather, he actually put a pair of jeans on, so dark blue they looked almost black. But he wore his usual shiny-black shoes and had his old grey scarf wrapped around his neck.
“That was the weather on the day of your mother’s funeral, three days later.”

John heartily wished he had consciously protected his groin before Violet kneed him as it still radiated with a thudding ache. “So the whole Disapproving Frosty Older Brother bit is an act?”
“His brother,” the Earl corrected her.
After a bit, Violet prompted him, “So you took a half a pill and you…?”

“’… I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.”
John pursed his lips together. “AND I was wondering, since I haven’t seen you in a fortnight, would you like to go out? To dinner and catch up? Maybe Angelo’s?”
. So he only nodded while studying his shoes, watching fluffy snow covering his feet and sticking to the pavement.
“Thanks, Billy, you’re a terrific listener,” Sherlock patted the skull then went out to the lounge.
Rucastle pointed John’s gun at Mary’s chest. “Do you really think I’d give a six year old a loaded gun?” he laughed at her. “It was dark up there. Hard for Miss Smith to see, wasn’t it?”
“Here they are, the plate numbers,” Anthea frantically finished scrawling the information on the front of the manila folder. She held the folder up and waved it like a paper fan.
Alex shook her head. “She’s a young pretty actress who got a job at a West End theatre.”
“My father is narcissistic control-freak. He told everyone this story about how my mother was agoraphobic. Well, that was not true. He kept her locked up either in our London house or  in our summer home near Cornwall. Used the agoraphobia as an excuse, a pretense to keep her locked up inside. After she died, he pulled me out of school. Told me the outside world isn’t safe for a girl like me. He needed to keep me pure. I became his next prisoner. For six years. I was just as trapped as my mother. Except it was worse, I wasn’t even allowed to go to The Copper Beaches anymore. I literally stayed locked up in our London home for six lonely, claustrophobic years. Thank God there had been a library.”
“Are you OK?”
John caught the self-satisfied grin on Sherlock’s face. It had been a trick question. The obvious answer would have been
“What?”
Then she stopped again, thinking about another highly-publicized suicide. Not Sherlock Holmes, but Lord Smallwood.
Knowing Dupin hid amongst them, he called up to the Interpol agents, “Go. Find her and defuse the bomb.” He tilted his head at Jim, “In the spirit of fair play, since we know those nitwits do not possess the same mental acumen as you and me, may I give them a hint?”
With a fanfare, the sky came alive. John craned his neck for a better view as the dead tributes' faces were given their few seconds of recognition. One of the child tributes was among the fallen. John was amazed any of the children were left. Maybe they had hid like he had. He saw the face of the woman who had committed suicide, one of the tributes from District 5. But both Molly and the man from her district, Mike, were both still alive. And John breathed a true sigh of relief when Sherlock's face was not shown. He had survived the first day.
Sherlock cut his eyes to the novel he had set aside.
Mary finally nodded in understanding, and hugged him. “I'll make excuses for you.”
“I wonder if that was really such a good thing.”
“Oh, please. You've barely been tolerating the company of your so called friends. You don't want to go back.”
“You could always hire someone to handle those things if you didn't have me around.”
“No, I mean the stars.” He pointed up. “Don't they usually have more stars up than this? And the moon was full last night, so where is it now? Why are they making it darker?”
“I doubt it, but god knows I don't enjoy it.”
“Yeah. For real.” John smiled, an involuntary action that had grown more and more common in association with his continuing realization about his miracle.
"Why wouldn't it be?"
"Why do you find it so hard, I wonder? To say what you're thinking. You like to dance around things." She crossed her legs and her eyes bore into me. "What did you tell your doctor, when you left? I doubt you casually said you were going to Karachi."
This woman’s heart was more of a locked door than John’s ever was…
Rucastle scowled at her. “Mrs. Toller was right. All you do is rock the boat. I’ve had it with your insubordination. You’re not what I’m looking for anyway. You’re too much like the goddess Athena, all fight, no love in your heart at all. All you need is an owl on your shoulder and a sword in your hand.”
221B Baker Street
Victor smiled fondly at Sherlock. “Too true, but he saved my arse a time or two as well. Would  never have passed any of my science requirements without him.”
“Siobhan,” the redhead whispered.
She finally smiled then, a mischievous spark in her eyes. “I’ll be damned. He finally told you he loved you, didn’t he?”
Violet had taken the bait. “Never find who, Eddie?”
“John because… because he would have insisted I stay behind and go after you by himself.” Violet rolled to her side. “I think… I think I always knew something was wrong with me. I just didn’t want to deal with it, didn’t want to deal with one more goddamned problem.”
“John, it’s alright,” she said simply as she carefully put the pistol down on the floor. “It’s alright.”
“Couldn’t deduce it?” Mycroft crossed his thin legs.
wasn’t exactly a normal name either and made him clear off. He then told me that he too had a very silly middle name: Sherrinford. It was an amalgamate of his mother’s name. Sherrin Ford. Apparently Aunt Beardy and Uncle Rudy thought they were being very clever. But from that day on, Ford always called me “Sherlock” and I called him ‘Ford’. It was the best I could do at the time. I was only four years old. Sherrinford was a bit much for any child that young to spit out. Mother overheard us calling each other that. She thought it was ‘cute’ and for better and worse, the nickname ‘Ford’ stuck. Everyone continued to call me William until I got older and I made them call me Sherlock.”
He remembered thinking about his gun as Sherlock had half-dragged him, half-carried him to a chair after the NICU doctor said he was so, so sorry about his loss. The old, suicidal thoughts that had plagued him before his chance run-in with Mike Stamford all those years ago came roaring back with a vengeance. Insidiously they had enticed him, beckoned him, whispered seductively to him
“Oh,” he said faintly. Then he furrowed his brow and thinned his lips. “
most important question. Did Mycroft sign off on that order of his own free will or under duress? That’s the real case, Violet. Mycroft does not do anything capriciously. My mother, as you also just learned, also worked for MI-6. We have a polite fiction going on between us, Mother and I,” he smiled grimly. “I pretend I have no idea that she was a code-breaker and a spy and she pretends to believe me.”
“Long story,” Trager snapped. “Shut up and pay attention.”
. Don’t worry about what you
Rolling her eyes, she opened the first text message:
4:51 PM
“Appledore,” Mycroft breathed.
Nothing!
“We’ll have all our European cells operational by March, the Asian ones by June and America by end of 2016.” Jim couldn’t help but sound smug. “What took Holmes two years to dismantle, has taken me less than a year to rebuild.”
“Do you know how sexy you sound, saying my name. Is that why you only refer to me as ‘The Woman’ when you talk about me to the press and other people?” Irene laughed..."
“You can visit any time you lik-” Mary started but Marion shook her head violently.
“You were enjoying yourself as well until your nerves got in the way. But now I finally understand why you always had a slew of girlfriends and why they all stayed with you longer than they actually liked you. I had suspected it was due to your performance in the bedroom, I just didn’t have hard data to draw an accurate conclusion, until now, of course.”
That little comment pushed John over the edge. “Alright, you pretentious dick, since you insist on behaving like an arsehole, hey, eyes up here.
He never understood why she had published it under “ML Holmes.”
“So, dear,” Mrs. Holmes had patted Violet on the arm. “It’s like you and William will have your own house all to yourself. A bit of privacy for the two of you.”
“Sherlock?”
But curiosity killed the cat as usual. Sherlock had to ask: “What?”
“That woman is a
“Mind your head,” Miss Smith cautioned him, holding the lid of the boot up so Mitton could climb out. “Wouldn’t do, if you got a concussion before getting you inside.”
“You can be friends with her too. I think… I think she’d like that,” she wiggled her newly freed toes with absurd delight as the second boot went flying. Before the conversation grew sloppy, she added, “Anyway, you haven’t slept in two days and we’ve got another big day ahead of us. We’ve got the Sons to deal with tomorrow. Plus we need to go over the plans with her,” she gestured towards Violet with her hands, “About what happens after we get her out of Chicago.” She now gave him one of her rare crooked grins, “Go to bed, take the bedroom, the bed is big enough for two, but not three.”
Violet texted a “ :-P “ back to him, erased her messages then slipped her Smartphone back into her pocket just as Mrs. Toller popped her head into Edward’s nursery. “Tea in fifteen minutes, Miss Smith.”
“Go on,” Violet whispered to Mrs. Hooper as she “casually” let her arms fall to her sides. Molly’s mother gave Violet a panicked look. Only after Violet nodded, then did she approach Jim, wide-eyed, pale-faced but bound and determined to retrieve her grandson. Violet watched with great trepidation as Jim eased the howling baby into Mrs. Hooper’s shaking hands. He even ran his hand over Henry’s fuzzy auburn head one last time, his gun pointed to the floor.
Heathcliff shrugged. “The game is on, then.”
Mrs. Holmes had burst out of the house by then, talking a mile a minute. She hugged and kissed Violet then hugged and kissed Sherlock (who looked like he was enduring some horrible torture rather than a maternal embrace) while she simultaneously praised his new hair-cut and bemoaned his injured hands and face. As Mr. Holmes shuffled out to help with the dogs and the luggage, Mrs. Holmes ushered Sherlock and Violet inside the cosy cottage, explaining that this actually had been two smaller cottages, but Mycroft had cleverly found a way to merge the two tiny cottages together to make a much larger house. (“Wasn’t that clever of him, William?” “Three cheers for Fatso…”)
) He opened his eyes and saw Lestrade hovering over him. Sherlock let his body go limp with relief at the sight of Lestrade’s brown eyes, soft brown eyes, gentle eyes, soothing, like chocolate, (
“Thanks. Bugger this cast.
“Yes, because I need more memories of that mausoleum,” Sherlock jeered at his brother. “To add to the
“Anya?” Violet furrowed her brow, shook her head. “Who’s Anya?”
“Anthea followed a false order planted by the mole to terminate Miss Boyle.”
(See the end of the chapter for
She nearly wept with relief as she half-limped, half-ran towards the cab, waving her hand at the cabbie just as a young couple wearing White Sox gear started strolling towards the cab. Violet added another burst of speed and nearly launched herself at the bright yellow cab, ignoring the sparking pain in her knee. She jerked the door open and threw herself in.
“Sad.”
“Consider it your punishment for running off for two days,” Mycroft purred. “Ta-ta.”
“Go after him then,” Dupin murmured.
Violet, despite her irritation and exhaustion, smiled.
The juxtaposition of Sherlock’s elegant voice and the crude imagery the vulgar words produced did John in. He started laughing like he hadn’t since last November. Seconds later, Sherlock joined in, his deeper, lower chuckles harmony to John’s higher-pitched giggles.

“Testify?”
Then, for the second time that night, Sherlock turned and bolted, leaving John and Mycroft struggling to catch up.
She never told John her real motivation for wanting Violet back. They hadn’t been friends, but they had been allies. They had a common interest: staying off of Mycroft’s radar. She also had been helping Mary find Maisie.
When he learned the truth, he wasn’t angry. But he had been deeply hurt… and jealous as hell.
Chapter Fifty-three: Brilliancy
After that, Donovan quit London for good.
The Watsons Residence
“I don’t think,” Victor finally said slowly, “I have hated someone so much as I do right now.”
I didn't post last Monday because I'm an idiot. I sent my long suffering beta an email saying "Look, two chapters!" and I didn't attach any of the chapters. So, thank you for bearing with me!
“But what if-”
“Let MI-6 get The Fucking Letter,” Violet seethed as quietly as she could.
He studied her intently, weighing her words. He brushed a long, blonde strand from her wig off her freckled cheek, his gloved fingertip barely touching her. Then he placed the same finger under her chin and tipped her head up. “Not even if it’s in
She had swatted at him and a month later, they had returned to Utah.
When Lady Smallwood paused by the door, lifting her ash-blond eyebrows questioningly at Mycroft, he did not look up from his mobile. “Close the door on your way out, please.”
Dupin sucked in a breath, shook off Sherlock’s hand. He seized the blue and green wires, sawed through them, then recoiled from the chair.
John and Mary Watson’s residence
Then the old woman thumbed the smeared make-up off Violet’s face, revealing the scar.
As they walked, two girls wearing Guy Fawkes masks, black Halloween capes, flowered baby doll dresses and platform heels stumbled past them, giggling and clinging to each other, obviously inebriated.
“Wonderful!” Rucastle boomed, “Just wonderful. Toller, she’s wonderful!”
Harry, meanwhile, took no notice of Violet and Sherlock. Her glazed-over eyes were fixed on Clara as a mean-spirited smile crossed her face. “Oh, which rehab you want me to try now, Clara? Where are we going to dry out me out at this time?”
Sherlock shrugged. “If they did, I’ll just say it was for a case.”
“Fuck, this reminds me of a horror movie,” Trager groaned.
“Why are you even here, Clara?” Harry stood, weaving on her feet, but at least she stood.
“Do we want to involve Ronnie in Family Business?” Papa Bella frowned, still on the phone with the Professor, who was probably listening to every word.
The Professor let himself out.
me you wouldn’t hurt him!”
“Wrong,” Sherlock droned. “That would have been the first place your father would have looked. However, I would not be surprised if your mother had hidden something at the Copper Beaches, just not in a place so obvious.”
Without a second glance at Sherlock, she ran towards Mycroft. “
“Best you don’t know right now, not because I don’t trust you,” Sherlock cut John off before he could protest. “I’m being practical, not distrustful. When the risks are this high, it’s best to play
“Nothing to be sorry about,” Mrs. Hudson crooned as she fished her handkerchief out of the sleeve of her dark purple cardigan. She gave it to Violet so she could mop up her tears. “You’ve lost so much and you and Sherlock been joined at the hip since you’ve moved in here. Now he’s out of the country for a case at the worst possible time, so of course, you’re upset.”
“By allowing his connections to the Red-Headed League to be exposed, the last two cells left in America were compromised. Didn’t you say that the last two Red-Headed League cells were in New York and Washington DC?”
As she climbed the stairs and ducked inside the building, she was reminded how her husband’s family had despised her, except for Rudy, of course. He thought she was great fun. Her friends and colleagues thought she was an idiot, getting involved with a civilian.
“Now,” Mycroft said quietly.
Then there was another pip, a hum, then silence. “Shakespeare,” Sherlock finally said, shaking his head, perplexed. He had just as much use for fictional literature as he did the solar system. “
“He was executed while I was still using,” Sherlock resolutely stared at the ceiling. “He never saw what I made of myself.”
, he’s my little brother. Of course I want to save his life. I worry about him, constantly. But when it became obvious that he did not care what his death would cost me and my parents, I guided him towards risks where if he did die, it would not be a waste. Does that make any sense?” he pleaded.
Fuller Park, Chicago
“Errm… an American politician is dead?”
Without another word, he slipped out, umbrella hooked neatly over his elbow.
He dialed and got voice mail. He rang off and texted.
Then there were the years she and her family had gotten leave to go back to the States and they had spent the long holiday at her grandparents’ farm, playing with her cousins. One year she had gotten into trouble because she had taught some of her cousins how to cuss in German. But she had overheard her dad laughing about it with her aunts and uncles so she knew she wasn’t in
Escaping Dupin’s rubbish-filled flat after sleeping most of the day away, Sherlock and John had met Dupin back at the shabby hostel where Lucas had died to search for additional clues. Dupin had idly asked John if everything was alright, and John only grunted that his shoulder hurt, then ducked into the bathroom, even though Dupin had just finished searching in there.
, John thought as he finally got out of the van. It didn’t help matters John still felt cross with Sherlock for interrogating him about his latest nightmare.
“I’m sorry,” she giggled. “I couldn’t resist… she was being such a
But there was no one he could talk to about it. His parents wouldn’t understand. Mycroft wouldn’t care. He would just tell him to grow a thicker skin and get over it.
27 November 2015
How?”
“Don’t worry, love,” Victor whispered, coming close to Sherlock again.
Violet quickly and expertly put her camouflage on her face. She had been nervous, sitting in here with her bare face, freckles and scar visible, but Mrs. Toller had seemed too consumed with stuffing her into this miserable corset of a dress to remark on her face.
worry about such a thing like that?” Violet rolled her eyes and took a bite. She was surprised how tasty it actually was, the tomato was fresh, the cheese a good mozzarella and the bread a nice toasted baguette. Her appetite, which had been lagging the past few days, perked up. She was suddenly ravenous.
here.”
“Where is he, Myc?”
After ringing off with Lucas, Mycroft called Anthea to have her make his travel arrangements. Once done with her, he rose from his chair, slowly, his ribs still bruised from the car accident last August.
“I’ll talk to her,” Mary used her best and gentlest “Mary Morstan” voice, even though she looked more like “AGRA” at the moment, with her heavily made-up eyes and her platinum hair slicked back. “It’s OK, boys, I’ve got her, could someone bring me a first aid kit? She’s got some scrapes on her hands. And, perhaps a drink? Whisky?”
“Stop stealing my clothes.”
Sherlock saw the murderous flash in John’s eyes and quickly joined them. “Jeff, I need the loo, where is it again? I can’t remember.”
“The lion don’t sleep,” Papa Bella put the cell to his ear. It only took two rings before the Professor picked up. In rapid Italian that his children couldn’t follow (they only had a rudimentary knowledge of the language,) Papa Bella explained the dire situation to the Professor. “
At any rate, the thing that made him
“Pack your things,” Dupin smashed the cigarette out in the ashtray. He then ducked into the tiny lavatory. “Received a text from our mutual friend,” his voice bounced off the tiled walls.
Sherlock thought he should have been able to deduce this, especially when Victor said: “I’ve never hidden it. Not from my friends anyway, but cocks like Seb don’t need to know my private business. I just,” he shrugged. “Don’t advertise it. But I don’t lie about it either.”
Molly snuffled, tried to laugh. “Yeah. Didn’t think the ‘For worse’ stuff would come right away.”
He kissed Mrs. Hooper on her cheek when he reached her seat, then stood next to the officiant, hands clasped, looking nervous and excited. But mostly nervous. Sherlock couldn’t work that out; this was his second go-round after all…
Sherlock’s face did not resemble a scared baby bunny at all. More like an irate alley cat.
He also wasn’t foolish enough to try for any hostile takeover of territory. He was an old man, the last of his kind, the last Don of Chicago. He was content to rule his own kingdom but at the same time, willing to ruthlessly defend it.
30 November 2000
“Oh. God. NO,” Violet struggled to her feet. She hadn’t been able to sleep, so she had stumbled downstairs to the kitchen to make coffee and watch the sun rise.
But Sherlock saw Toller’s finger was not on the trigger. “You already informed me of that fact, plus you don’t plan on shooting her. That’s too quick. You’re planning on something horrifying and tortuous. Something painful so I suffer right along with her.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You lot really are unoriginal.”
Montmartre, Paris
“After you and Violet came to hospital and we had all learned how much of a sick fuck Magnussen was and also the depths of Mary’s deceit,” John started again. “I made myself calm down and cool off, so I could think instead of just… you know, blundering through everything, feeding off of adrenaline and panic and rage and… anyway. Violet had caught up with me and we had a good chat then when I was nice and calm, I returned to Mary’s room.” He picked at a nub on the chair’s arm. “I asked her point blank if she still loved me and without missing a beat, she said
. Especially when we all know he wouldn’t leave any cake for the rest of us.
Having now arrived at the Serpentine, with a sulky Edward in tow, Violet couldn’t help but smile. It was actually… kind of cool. Beautiful, really. She had been expecting a water park like the ones back in America, with the man-made swimming pools and water slides. Turned  out, it was actually a very lovely lake, called the Serpentine River for some odd reason. Part of the lake was partitioned off for swimming but more importantly, there were “paddle pools” for children so Violet wouldn’t have to worry about the boy getting sucked under the lake water. There was also a proper playground as well, a grassy area for the adults to sunbathe (although the grass was thin and brown) and a café near the Princess Diana memorial that Violet had never visited.
Hope paled. “Why would they want to kill us?”
Ohhh… this is happening, it’s really happening…
“I was around adults, not adolescents in their first throes of passion,” he hissed back at her.
“Told you that shit was good,” Violet sniffled through a giggle. “I’m not being noble, Sherlock. I’m being practical. It’s stupid to chase a man who’s in love with someone else. Even if I wasn’t going to turn into Living Dead Girl, I still would have ended it for the same reason.”
“Again, the contents are unimportant,” Sherlock butted back into the conversation, “Boring, in fact. What would launch a world war is
When John had told her about the dead puppy they found in the kiddie pool, she had gagged. Then became resolved to get Edward out of this dysfunctional, deadly environment before permanent damage was done… assuming it wasn’t too late, of course
While I still consider myself a die-hard fan of the series as a whole and hope for a Series 5, I do find myself liking TST and TFP less and less the more and more I read the original stories.  If if IF there is a Series 5, I really would love to see modern adaptations of either the scarier/gorier canon stories or the lesser know stories.  "The Problem of Thor Bridge" or "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot" would also be awesome stories to modernize. //end rant
“However, thanks to my darling brother’s incessant meddling, Victor Trevor has now been once again upgraded to the penthouse suite,” he pressed his pointer finger right in the middle of his forehead again, “Of my mind palace. It is dreadfully annoying. I have Work to do. I don’t want to waste valuable time and precious brain power pondering over an ex… an ex…”
“Not until it was too late.”
“Yes…” and Julia spilled her guts.
Violet froze. She whipped her head, her tangled curls fanning out. “What?”
2:45 PM
“Oh yes, terrible business,” Bodley shook his head. “She was crossing the streets and a Range Rover ran a red light. Never slowed down, just kept on driving. Pulverized her, poor girl.”
before the 31st. – SH
As they reached the ground floor, Sherlock’s mobile vibrated. Expecting one of Alex’s brief text replies, Sherlock’s eyebrows lifted in surprise when he saw Mycroft’s name lit up on the screen. And it wasn’t a text. He was actually calling him.
John took it without any guilt. This wasn’t about affection or flirting. This was two people suffering the greatest loss imaginable. No matter what happened between him and Mary, he knew Mary was the only person in the world who understood his utter desolation regarding his children. They didn’t even need to talk about it. They could give each other a glance and have a silent conversation only grieving parents could have.
Violet rolled her eyes but squared her thin shoulders and all but marched out of the room.
Sherlock looked down, looked up at her again then the light bulb switched on in his mind palace. “
But Gladstone broke away from Sherlock and started pacing and whining, obviously looking for someone… oh.
The second gift was the arrival of an in-high-demand hair stylist, who also just happened to be a member of Dupin’s
“Why do you want to know where my dad is?” John croaked out.
Somewhere in London
“John doesn’t quite know that Irene is alive,” Sherlock had mumbled.
. John promptly decided the American take on the sitcom was shit, but didn’t complain or change the channel. There was nothing else to do since Sherlock had lapsed into one of his broody silences and Dupin had left to buy food and alcohol as a conciliatory gesture to the boys for taking over their home.
“So,” John asked once they reached the idling car. “Now what? We don’t meet Dupin until tomorrow afternoon? Should we go check in at the hotel?”
Having John stay had been a God-send for the infirm flat-mates. He didn’t hover like Mrs. Holmes had. He let them sleep. He let them eat whatever they wanted, not just broth and tea, even though he gently insisted they drink extra amounts of water and orange juice. He even tidied up the messy flat while they slept and considerately waited until they were awake to give the carpets a much-needed Hoovering.
Molly felt her eyes welling up again, but for different reasons.
But John was only half-listening to Sherlock now. The file had opened and John started scrolling through the various photographs. The pictures were horrifically familiar. “Sherlock…”
, or whoever took over for Moriarty and
“And I’m not in the FBI, not anymore,” Violet crossed her freckled arms over her stomach as she made her way towards the men.
But it was slow-going and painful. Violet didn’t know if the muscle cramps were from the cold or from the Tasering. Her strained shoulder pulsed with every beat of her heart. Every step she lurched forward felt like she trod on razor blades. Hazily she remembered her mother reading her bedtime stories. Remembered how she drank in her mother’s dulcet voice as she read out loud the story of
“Conversations with my mother usually are. Do you have anything you’d like to discuss with me?” Sherlock’s voice was a trifle too innocent to be innocent, “Anything on your mind, anything troubling your conscience, perhaps?”
“Oh put some clothes on,” he batted her hand off his chest. “I am not in a gaming mood.”
“Lay it on thick,” he advised her.
I wish there was a way I could have posted my beta cadogan's running commentary on this chapter. It made me LOL for real. :^D
“Why are we friends again?” John asked as Sherlock darted around him and swiped the first file off the stack John had put on the coffee table.

From the backseat, Dupin quietly informed Sherlock, “My Militia has confirmed that Dr. Watson is on the
Of course Sherlock’s wolf-like hearing caught John’s voice. An expression not usually seen on his pale face appeared: confusion.
Swindle
11:57 AM
Meanwhile Violet squared her shoulders and gave herself a moment to mentally prepare for the unpleasant role she was about to play. She also refused to look at Sherlock while she began to speak. Keeping her eyes solely on John, she said an even, clear voice, her “Miss Smith” voice: “Clinically speaking, Magnussen was a psychopath with narcissistic tendencies as well as a penchant for sexual deviance. I read his childhood medical records and they were very disturbing. How he fell through the cracks, I have no idea. They documented his lack of empathy and inability to connect to children his own age all the way back to age three and no, Sherlock.” She closed her eyes. “There is absolutely nothing about you showing psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies in your childhood records, not even in the records that aren’t supposed to exist,” she added, referring to his secret sessions with Dr. Gloria Scott after he had stood up to the evil Earl of Winchester by setting the little monster on fire.
As they wove their way throughout the cemetery, John asked, “Did you tell Dupin?”
After Mrs. Hudson let him in, John climbed the stairs up to the familiar flat and knocked on the door labeled “221B.” A police file was tucked underneath his arm. “Hello?”
“Perfect.”
“Well,” Violet said, walking to the kitchen table. “If he really does have a case, make sure it’s not going to eat up too much of your time. I have a feeling you’re going to be hearing from The Met fairly soon, even though Lestrade’s on his honeymoon.”
her know his entire life, all of it. All of his scars, all of his sins so why did she insist on making him deduce
Mycroft held his lips tightly together, “Oh Sherlock.”
“Maybe if he’d just let his guard down and shag her, he wouldn’t be so frustrated,” Mary quipped. “Who knows, he might even like it.” When John hesitated, Mary said, “What? Did I say something wrong?”
“Where’n the hell do you think you’re going?”
“Yes,” she struggled to keep her voice from shaking. “I did as you requested. I called my brother-in-law and told him to call it off with Holmes.”
Something finally clicked.
His mobile hummed.
The name had been the first thing that popped into her head. But she was too embarrassed to admit the reason why it popped into her head was because she had stayed up into the wee hours watching a
“Leave,” Sherlock said, already surfing the Internet.
“The night of John Watson’s stag party. We were out. She was alone.”
, he thought as a goofy smile creased his face.
A heavy sigh, “They haven’t even been in Paris for twenty-four hours. Very well, I’ll tell Luc-”
He hummed and closed his eyes, pressing his steepled fingers to his Cupid Bow’s lips, thinking… thinking… thinking… remembering his conversation with Mycroft yesterday…
As he stalked down the pavement, the burning tightness in his chest loosened. The farther and farther he got away from the house, that perfect fucking house, the more he felt like he could finally breathe.
“Harry, I swear to God,” John picked up his butter knife and pointed it at her. “If you can’t be civil at a time like this, I’ll-”
“As I said, a tempest in a teapot,” Sherlock scoffed. “Two idiots have been letting their hearts rule their heads. A love letter was intercepted.”
“Just don’t overdo it,” John fussed as he opened the door. Once in the foyer, he could hear laughter and music.
221B Baker Street
“Yes,” Mary put the basket down, stood aside and pushed the little girl forward. “This is Lily. She’s the daughter of one of Molly’s old school friends.”
Sherlock gritted his teeth. “He is
And his parents had been wrong, as usual. The schoolwork
“I don’t remember hitting my head,” Violet had said hollowly.
He already deduced what  tedious ruse they were going to use to separate him from Mary and get him back inside the house. “Miss Smith has been planning a surprise for you, Mr. Holmes. She had asked Mr. Rucastle for his assistance. She’s waiting for you at the pool.”
“Mrs. Violet Holmes,” he leaned against the doorjamb, unable to resist teasing her.
“What’s going on?” Harry hissed at her brother.
“A baby? At Baker Street?” John couldn’t help sounding sceptical.
“You dirty bastard,” Chibs growled as Brother Morris walked over to a large laundry basket on wheels. “What are you people up to?”

Just in time too because as John slipped into the stairwell, he heard the front door bell chiming again as a female voice called out “
“And that’s why Harriet will never hit rock bottom,” Sherlock droned.
John didn’t want him to be alone…
Victor laughed and saluted the pissed girls, singing out, “Remember, remember! The fifth of November. The Gunpowder treason and plot; I know of no reason, why the Gunpowder treason should ever be forgot!”
“What does that mean?” Mycroft paled as John jabbed the lift button.

Violet looked insufferably smug. “A new personal best,” she smiled but sobered immediately. “Any update on Mary?”
tonight.
To be fair, it wasn’t always Mary who was infringing on their time together. John had a steady flow of friends and colleagues coming in and out the front door. John simultaneously felt grateful and exhausted. He didn’t know how to explain without sounding like an arse, that he just wanted to sit in His Chair in front of a roaring fire across from his best friend and just have a cuppa at 221B.
"Mycroft covered the mouthpiece of his phone, “Once they’re back up, I want all live CCTV feeds from Oxford to be routed to my computer at once.”
“Your school records, your hospital records. I know what room you stayed in at when you were in hospital. That is how I know you saw the snow falling. Just as I had deleted the memory of what happened to me during those Fifteen Minutes, you cut-and-pasted details from one memory to another, to improve the narrative. To rationalize your mother’s death, to be able to soothe yourself by telling yourself,
“It’s a ledger. An accounts ledger. Fancy a flutter on who their only customer is?”
she remembered, feeling the food she just ate start to swirl uncomfortably in her stomach. Sherlock’s “gifts” also meant that the abuse he suffered at the hands of the Earl had also been just that much worse.
Blindly, she weaved through the house, looking for the staircase. She paused, gripping the banister, trying to catch her breath. Gladstone whined and pressed his muzzle into her thigh.
He yawned, already bored and annoyed with this charade. But it had to be done.
Violet had long since funneled the money out of the now-deceased Jack’s account into various secure accounts across the world. Her years working at an insurance agency gave her insights into the finance world she never had as a federal agent. Her years laundering money in order to obtain evidence against Jack Woodley and his involvement with Moriarty’s people taught her how to hide money and how to convolute a digital paper trail, since the trail could never be completely eradicated.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock. She’s ill. She’s… she’s…” John spluttered.
Instead of his designer suits, he now wore crumpled overalls, a ball cap and workman’s boots. Then he put on a pair of sunglasses to his blue-green-golden eyes. He had fished out his toolbox again and he looked like a guy who repaired things for a living. An Everyday Bloke.
! You don’t give a shit about the cause; you only care about the money!”
“With pleasure,” Rucastle grinned, moving faster than a man of his size should be able to. He slammed the door shut and locked it. He grunted in relief. One problem solved.
“They won’t understand to stay put,” Lisbeth had pointed out. “They’re scared. They’ll run.”
MI-6 activities.” When Sherlock had clamped a hand on John’s shoulder, only then did Mycroft dare get closer to the two men. “He
Finally, he just gestured at John and said, “Come on.” And without thinking too much about it, thought overshadowed by the static of the cops' walkie-talkies and the clattering racket of handcuffs and restraints, he followed.
“How's Mary?”
He was so well-practiced that I hardly felt the twinge of the needle through my skin. His eyes took on a languid quality of concentration.
“No, but I've certainly observed enough human interactions to have cataloged quite a bit of information on the subject.”
their names, don't you?” Sherlock shot a glare at him as the doors to the lab swung open. “Hey, Molly. How are you doing?”
Sherlock whirled around to look at John, who was smiling smugly at him.
"No, don't give me that, Greg! We both know it's not true! I don't know why he said it, but it's a lie!"
“Not really.”
“A taste of things to come, my dear. I can do a lot more damage than blowing up some socialites and statues.”
She rolled her eyes. “Don't try to give me a redemption arc, I don't want one. Besides, you're helping me already.” Mary swung her arm, aiming the gun at Sherlock, and before John could react, she fired.
way to quit feeling so miserable and so goddamn angry.
He heard a yelp, felt Sherlock spin around beside him. The yelp turned into a snarl. John pushed at Sherlock, urging him to run, and then took off after him as he heard the snarl become a growl again.
John shook his head, laughing to himself, and Sherlock made every effort to remain as still as possible. “When are you going to actually tell me anything about yourself instead of all this dramatic secretive nonsense?” John smiled at him, and though the words made Sherlock expect irritation, instead he found something else, something akin to the expression he had had when he showed up on Sherlock's doorstep. The candlelight, the faint music playing over the speakers, the way John was looking at him, it was all too much. He had crossed a line into vulnerable territory without meaning to.
