"Look," Lucifer continued. "I just think that with the whole deal with him and Michael maybe we should just wait a little. You know, enjoy our time together for the fullest and all of that. And then..." He smirked. "... we can do your family thing."
To his surprise, Dean pulled out his leather jacket and shirt, both nicely cleaned as if nothing had ever happened. Sam's eyebrows shot up. He never would have taken Gabriel for the apologizing kind.
He wanted to say no. He wanted to spend the rest of this entire day with Lucifer if it meant he would get to feel those soft lips on his again. But he also knew he'd have to get home pretty soon if he didn't want to piss off Dean again.
He didn't want to but he couldn't help it either. He was thinking about something to say when he suddenly remembered something. "So hey, I heard your brother is back?"
He could ask of course, but if Dean really wasn't in a mood to share, that would only piss him off. Sam guessed he could also ask Cas if something happened between the two of them but he didn't the boy's phone number.
It was only when they were both lying in bed, not cuddling, that Misha addressed him again, being it with his back turned towards him. "I've got my first meet and greet at 2.30, so I'll be leaving for the hotel after lunch."
Dean's eyes grew big and he looked at Sam for support. Unfortunately, his brother was just as clueless. "Okay?" he tried.
So he had answered the phone and let her talk, although he didn't really listen to what she was saying. She had noticed something was off about him rather quickly and asked him about it, but of course he didn't answer. He just gave her some crappy explanation about being tired. He could tell she wasn't convinced though, her voice had sounded worried, but she'd dropped it anyway and Dean appreciated that about her.
The Winchester snapped out of it. "Yeah, sure," he mumbled while opening the passenger's door and taking a seat. "Where are we going?"
Sam was filled with relief. If they had a computer, that was the first step of their journey figuring this out. "Great. Let's do some researching."
"Lucifer's still in there, he doesn't even know I'm gone, you really want me to just leave him there?" he yelled, becoming outraged at Dean's indifference.
Apparently Cas didn't care to elaborate on the subject, so Dean decided to continue. "So anyways, I wanted to tell you Lisa and I are officially on a break."
Dean tried to think quickly. "Sorry," he said. "I'm just... uhm... it's the con, I guess. Bit nervous."
When Lucifer finally pulled away, Sam was left shocked to the bone and out of breath. The Shurley put a step back while Sam was still trying to recover from the kiss, and said with an amused grin, "So, guess that makes me your boyfriend now, huh?"
"What?" Okay, so he hadn't seen that one coming. Actually, Dean could hardly fathom it at all. Of all the Shurleys Michael definitely seemed closest to their father, so it would've made sense if he was the first one to be adopted too. "Then who was?"
They went upstairs and Lucifer opened the door to a very nice apartment. A big living room and a simple but seemingly flawless kitchen with a beautiful, modern interior.
"I'll have a cheeseburger, piece of apple pie and a beer, please," he answered without as much as glancing at the menu.
Balthazar and Crowley exchanged a look. This could either work or fail completely. It was funny how fate, or whatever was out there, had thrown them together like this. None of them had ever really been friend material and they weren't planning on changing that now. But at that point, they realized this might turn into something close enough.
was true. Sam would've told him. Sam told him everything, so surely something as important as this... He opened his mouth to deny it but nothing came out. What was he supposed to say? With the very few time he'd spent with his brother lately, what could he possibly say to prove Gabriel wrong?
Before he could process what was happening, Cas had already grabbed him by the back of his neck and pulled him forward. This time his lips found Dean's more urgently, as if Friday had left him wanting to discover more, and Dean almost immediately let himself drown in the experience. He wrapped his arms around Cas's waist to press their bodies closer while he kissed him back, and it was just as great as it had been before. The kiss lasted longer than their first one had, both of them taking the time to explore the feeling of each tiny part of the other's lips.
Sam desperately shook his head. "But why? You don't even know me, what could you possibly need to talk to me about?"
Sam on the other hand was perfectly comfortable with his friendship with Lucifer. He had told him everything that had happened Friday night and his friend had been nothing but understanding about it. He was angry at his older brother though, hell they both were, but he didn't blame Sam for any of it. In fact it brought them even closer together. Everything was easy when it came down to Lucifer. He made Sam loosen up like he hadn't in a very long time. Not since Jess. Sure, he was still a little unsure about the flirtatious comments Lucifer made from time to time, but in general he just brushed them off as jokes. It didn't even come to mind that they might be something more.
"Okidoki," Lucifer replied, walking to the kitchen. When he got back, he handed Sam his soda and put his own on the coffee table. Then he gave Sam a once-over that made a shiver run down his spine. "I like this."
During his break, Sam went outside. He just wanted some time for himself. Not that his friends had been anything but amazing and he definitely wasn't going to let it get as far as it had with Jess, but it was a tiring day and he needed a moment alone with his thoughts. So since his usual spot in the hallway was now tainted with its own painful memories and the weather was starting to clear up, he went to find himself a place in the schoolyard.
"Dean," Cas interrupted him and the boy put a comforting hand on his shoulder that made him go quiet immediately. As his eyes went to face Cas's, every muscle in his body seemed to relax again.
He saw his brother heading to the fire fighters to talk to them but he doubted if he wanted to hear what they had to say.
He imagined Cas smiling and automatically smiled back at the thought. A smile that only brightened when Castiel simply said,
Alright, so maybe he wasn't perfectly straight. He could have brushed off Michael as some strange impulse but Cas was more than that. When he was with Cas, everything felt right. Thinking of Michael that way had always sent him straight into a panic attack, but not Cas. Cas made him feel calm, like everything would be okay no matter how much he fucked up.
Unfortunately Molly didn't fall for it. "Which is a nice way of saying he knows of your existence but you haven't exchanged two words."
"Oh, this?" the friendly witch asked, picking up a small piece of candy. "This is Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, dear. Never loses its flavor!"
Dean didn't know how long he was sitting there like that, books in front of him but his eyes watching the boy next to him. Not that it mattered. This was the most peaceful he'd been in days and he was planning on making it last as long as possible.
Lucifer frowned at him and Sam immediately felt his gut twitch, afraid he'd said something wrong. But then the other boy said, "Does it really matter? No one will believe you anyway. They'll think you're just picking my side."
It didn't take him very long to lose his focus though. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed Cas going through the papers or opening one of the books, occasionally taking some notes in the process. Dean was curious what he was reading about. Not that he'd understand any of it or was even interested in trying to, but he actually liked to listen to Cas talking about it and getting to know the other boy a little bit better. Even if that meant talking about bees.
The younger boy slowly lifted his eyes to meet his and Dean got caught in how blue they were. He didn't know how long the two of them were just standing there like that, gazes locked - it could've been seconds or ages - but he did know when it ended. Because from the moment Cas broke the connection and looked down again, Dean knew, and the truth shot a flash of pain through his chest.
They both fell silent after that, equally surprised at the words that had come out of Dean's mouth. It took him a couple of seconds but eventually Sam was the first one to find his voice again.
Gym was absolute hell of course. There were way too many balls flying around the room that could and would hit Sam in the face. He didn't even care anymore the entire class was laughing at him. Well, everyone except the Shurleys of course. His five new classmates were rather distant, apart from a girl named Hannah maybe, who at least occasionally spoke to some of the other students, and the shy guy in the trenchcoat nobody knew the name off. Sam assumed he was just... well, shy.
"Oh, if they're the ones bullying you, they're gonna get it from me too, believe me," his brother agreed, immediately becoming protective of him.
"Now you two listen to me," the man started. "I'm not gonna tell you who to be friends with or not. I'm not saying they're all bad and I won't stop you from hanging around with them if that's what you want, but I am telling you that that is a seriously dysfunctional family. And I don't want either of you getting caught up in their messes. 'Cause it is gonna end bloody. You understand?"
Dean closed the remaining distance between them and kissed him. His eyes fluttered shut as their lips met. It was nothing like he'd expected, although he wasn't even sure he'd expected anything at all. Cas's lips were soft against his, and he tasted just a little bit like beer but also sweet, almost like... Was that honey?
"Ah, I don't know, man," he admitted. "It's different this time. I get the feeling the harder I try, the more I push him away."
When they were finally done, Misha took Dean's hand and started dragging him to what Dean could only guess was the bedroom. He started protesting a bit but what was he supposed to say? 'Dude, I'm not really your husband, just the character he plays'? Yeah, that didn't sound like the most bright idea.
His boyfriend just huffed and acted as if he was deeply insulted while he started walking ahead of him, so Sam grabbed his arm and pulled him back with a confident grin on his face. Lucifer bumped into him and all of a sudden they were standing very close to each other. Their gazes locked and if they weren't in public, Sam would've kissed him right there and then. Unfortunately they were and Lucifer knew it too, Sam could tell by the arrogant, I-told-you-so look on his face.
For a second his friend looked at him in confusion but then he just smiled at Ellen, so Dean guessed he didn't mind.
Dean already regretted his decision. Everybody knew Crowley had some underground business going. Dean didn't know what it exactly was Crowley did, but he was pretty sure it was illegal and he didn't really want to know either. "So what has that to do with me?"
Castiel's words resonated in his mind. The thing was that there was in fact a problem. So what did that mean then? Maybe he had to talk about it with Michael. Maybe talking about it with Michael was the worst idea in history. Dean couldn't remember ever feeling this confused.
Ps, if you're not ready for the slightly more mature stuff, I suggest you skip the entire fourth paragraph...
Not only was Castiel relieved to have found a potential friend, he was also very grateful someone could be looking out for Samandriel, even if it was a fellow Ilvermorny student. He knew his brother kept by himself most of the time and at least he already seemed to know this Adam boy a bit. The smile on Samandriel's face told Castiel he was just as happy to not have to face his first day all alone.
He was speechless for a moment. He knew it was meant as a compliment but it just made Sam worry he wasn't exactly portraying Jared too well. He really needed to learn more about the man that was supposed to be playing him, not the other way around.
Now Dean really started to get angry. "Well, then why the hell did you bring us here in the first place if you're not going to let us in?" he yelled.
Dean slowly nodded, not even bothering to look up. He didn't feel like facing the two pairs of worried eyes he could feel were on him. "Yeah sure," he mumbled. "I'll come over to work on her this weekend."
The brothers exchanged a look. Even if they remembered where Jared Padalecki's house had been last time, clearly this was another universe. Unless Sam's alter ego had divorced that Genevieve girl and decided he was more into guys after all.
"Dean, there are a lot of other things besides 'straight' and 'gay'," Castiel lectured, even making quotation marks with his fingers.
He heard footsteps and Misha strode over to the counter that was separating the kitchen from the living room. He placed his arms on top of the shiny marble surface and leaned down, his eyes focused on Dean.
But as it seemed, Dean didn't feel the same way. "Sam was at an underground club tonight with Lucifer Shurley."
Well, he hadn't exactly welcomed any of the other Ilvermorny students. Great. Some kid that wanted to be his friend because he was a Shurley. Why was he not even surprised. Gabriel immediately moved the arrogant-looking, well-built boy that was gonna be his number one victim to second place and decided on this Crowley dude instead. "Good for you, bucko." And he turned back to his food.
Castiel sighed. Of course the only thing on Gabriel's mind had been sex. What else did he expect? "What a surprise."
It took Sam a couple of seconds but then he remembered Lucifer'd left his car top down. The Chevy must be drenched by now. The idea made him chuckle too.
Cas was without doubt the weirdest person he'd ever met. "B-because it's fun!" He laughed incredulously. "You're lucky I like you, you know that?"
Leaving Gabriel to get out on his own, he smiled at the older guy. "It was nice meeting you and your brother."
During his last hour Dean got a text from Lisa saying she wouldn't be able to come along with him and Michael after school. Dean sighed. For a moment he contemplated cancelling the whole thing but decided against it. Michael didn't deserve that. And after all Dean still liked the guy. As a friend.
The pranks, the lollypop, it was about time Sam found out who they were from. He remembered clearly what Lisa had told him, about one of the Shurleys whose nickname was 'the Trickster', and he was determined to define which one.
"What's up, dudes?" Charlie grinned while squeezing herself in between Dean and Adam. His older brother's smile lit up at the sight of the redheaded girl that was not only his classmate, but also one of his best friends.
He heard footsteps approaching and could imagine Cas coming to a stop on the other side of the door, only two feet away from him. After a bit of fumbling with the doorknob, he guessed Cas was trying to pull the door open. Just like Dean's earlier attempts, the door did little more than shake a bit.
Sam immediately relaxed into the kiss, enjoying the feeling of Lucifer's by now familiar lips against his own. He closed his eyes in contentment and allowed Lucifer to part his lips by slipping his tongue in. He hesitantly placed his hand against the older boy's chest. This was all still so new and yet it was exciting at the same time. Apparently Lucifer took the gesture as quite the encouragement, because he slid his own hand upward, running his fingers through Sam's hair, and God, did he like that. He let out a moan of pleasure and felt Lucifer smiling in response. When Sam opened his eyes, he was staring right into Lucifer's blue ones.
Now Sam understood why he hadn't seen Lisa around lately. Actually, he couldn't even remember how long it had been since he had... "When?"
And he was. As he sank back into the mattress and Lucifer's body fitted against his, it was all Sam ever wanted. There was nothing he'd like better than letting Lucifer know how he felt, showing him how much this meant to him, sharing the joy that was rushing through him, telling him-
"Personally I would love nothing more than to get away from you and your new boyfriend, but I need you to come with me," the short guy said, not seeming very happy to be here.
Dean just smiled back and opened the door. As he got out of the car, Cas did the same and together they walked up to one of the stores. It was cramped into a corner of the square and the sign above the door simply read
He shook his head in confusion and tried to turn his attention away from them, but that turned out to be harder than he'd thought as soon as the girl whispered something in his... Was she really biting his ear now? Another one on his other side, a girl with a tanned skin and dark hair Sam remembered was called Kali, had one hand on his shoulder and the other one disappearing underneath the table. And from the direction it seemed to be in, Sam was glad he couldn't see where exactly it had taken place.
Sam smiled at him and turned around, but at the last moment he changed his mind. "Send me the song!" he called, and then finally left for his algebra class.
Lucifer's eyes turned stone-cold, as if he'd decided he'd had enough of this conversation. "That's not my fault."
Sam laughed at that, but then he got serious again. "Could we maybe keep it between us though?" he carefully asked. "For now, I mean. It's just that I'd like to tell my friends and family myself and right now..."
"Dean," Cas stopped him. "I love my family. No matter how much we may disagree on things, I can't just turn my back on them."
"I know, I know," he said putting up his hands in surrender. "I know you need time and I get it and I'm not gonna push you, but... I just think this might actually do you some good, okay? You don't need to give me an answer now but would you at least consider it? Please?"
"Perfect, I'll see you then." And like that Balthazar dropped the pen, folded the piece of paper in two, put it in Dean's hand and then ran back to his own seat since class was about to begin.
"We can also just go back to my house and watch a movie or something," Dean shrugged. "Or if you wanna go home, that's fine too," he quickly added.
John Winchester was one of MACUSA's best and most famous Aurors. He wasn't home very often, so before they went to Ilvermorny, Sam and Dean had spent a lot of time living with their father's friends. Bobby Singer, an old Thunderbird family friend, former Auror and one of the accompanying teachers on the exchange trip, was basically like a second father to them. No, if Sam was being honest with himself, he didn't think their dad would visit. Not unless he'd got a job in the UK too.
Sam was standing in the parking lot, frozen in awe and having trouble keeping his mouth closed. How had he never noticed the shining red vehicle before? "You own a '62 Corvette?"
"Dean, don't do it," Michael said, not once turning his glaring eyes away from Crowley. "You don't want to stoop to his level."
He spent most of his time with Lucifer, as usual, but they both knew his mind was elsewhere. After he'd zoned out once again during their final break, Lucifer apparently decided he'd had enough of it and Sam was awoken from his state of mind by the snapping of Lucifer's fingers.
Dean put a step forward, ready to fly at his throat, but Michael grabbed his arm and pulled him back.
When Dean finally let go of him, he turned to Jess' parents. They'd noticed them too and were now making their way towards him and his brother, Mrs Moore a few steps ahead of her husband. As soon as she reached Sam she hugged him as well. He didn't know what to say to her but apparently there was no need to say anything at all. They were both just crying silently, holding each other in an attempt to comfort one another though they knew they couldn't. This pain was way too severe to be swept away so easily.
Dean let out a sigh and finally opened the door. As they walked in, he said, "It's not your fault, alright? It's just, this day... Man, I don't even know where to start."
Misha let out an annoyed sigh. "No, it's fine... Just... If Rich's not home yet, you can crash here if you want."
"What? No, of course not," Crowley said, revulsion all over his face. Dean wasn't sure if it was because of the idea or his stupidity to ask about it. "The Cage doesn't really do ownership. Just think of Lucifer as one of the founding fathers. A board member, if that's something you can wrap your tiny mind around."
He was kidding, right? Sam stood up straight and took a deep breath before starting, "Well, I mean..." He cleared his throat and ran a hand through his hair. "Yesterday, at the library, you uhm... you... you kissed me and..." When he realized he didn't know how to finish that sentence, he made some vague gesture with his hands.
"So anyways, I was wondering if you'd like to join us for lunch? You don't have to," he quickly added. "I just wanted to offer, you know. As a chance to make it up to you."
In confusion Sam turned back to Crowley, who had shut the door and now told the guard, "Don't let any of them back in." The guard frowned a bit, obviously recognizing Sam, but didn't protest.
Sam huffed in disbelief. He thought he started to understand why Lucifer wasn't that close to his father. He guessed it wasn't that strange, Lucifer's dad had only planned on adopting one kid after all, but he had a bad feeling about where this was going.
The Hogwarts student shrugged. "Not a lot of exciting things to tell. Professor Holmes, the Headmaster? He's a Slytherin, first one for the position in years. It was about time we put those arrogant Gryffindors in their place, really. Like I said, Professor MacLeod is our Head and she teaches Potions."
"No no no," Dean quickly attempted to fix it. "I am, I just..." When he didn't know how to finish that sentence, he almost carefully shrugged.
The group of students came to a stop in front of a pair of enormous double doors. Professor Singer, their Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was waiting in front of them and was soon joined by Professor Metatron Shurley and Chuck Shurley himself.
"Oh." Lucifer pulled up his eyebrows and removed his hand, a bit of a disappointed look in his eyes. "I thought you wanted this."
Crowley just looked at him calmly. "It is hilarious actually. Which is exactly why Lucifer put it here."
He put away his phone and tried to focus back on class, in a way better mood than he'd been in before.
Dean was getting really tired of giving vague answers to questions he didn't understand. Luckily his brother jumped in.
"They actually aren't really twins, they just happened to be born on the same day," Michael elaborated. "They were 12 years old back then. Their names are Adam..."
That didn't seem to clarify much for Castiel but he didn't say anything else about it. Instead he looked back at Sam. "When he comes back, I'll ask him to take me home so you can talk privately."
"And that's supposed to stop me?" his brother mocked, raising an eyebrow. He turned back to Dean. "Just keep your brother away from Lucifer." He started to walk away, to a shiny silver car parked at the sidewalk, but at the last moment he looked back at him. "Actually, it would be wise for both of you to stay away from my family in general."
Dean texted his brother when class was finally over. He hated the idea of pushing Sam towards Lucifer even more, but hell, it was already too late for that anyway.
to stop it. He wanted to know everything there was to know about him, the boy who had peaked his curiosity, who made him laugh and blush and... happy.
Sam wanted to be angry at him, he did, but now that he'd said his piece, he honestly just felt empty. He didn't want to fight, he was just sick of everything in his life going wrong. So instead, he just mumbled, "Whatever," and took a seat next to Dean.
Dean shook his head, trying to express what he was feeling. "I don't... I can't explain it, but this," he motioned to the two of them, "I don't know why, but it just doesn't feel... right."
Not that he knew what he wanted to talk about. He hardly felt like reliving the events of last night. But he did think Dean needed to know at least some of it.
"No alcohol," Sam stated. He remembered his last experience with drinking very vividly and wasn't ready for a second round.
"Ellen, this is Cas. Cas, Ellen's a family friend who also happens to have the best burgers and pie in town," Dean introduced them with a grin.
A part of Sam felt a pinch of guilt at the worry on Bobby's face. He could see Dean was having the same reaction.
Somehow they eventually parted and Dean got him in the car, heading back home. Sam supposed he wasn't going to go to school today. Somewhere between Jess' house and his own he finally ran out of tears and the excruciating pain was replaced by a numbness. This he liked better. It prevented him from thinking and he didn't want to think, afraid this one thought might coincidentally pop into his mind. He really didn't want to think that one thought.
"Right." Dean looked around the hallway to make sure that the majority of the mass had cleared out before he answered. "There's something I gotta tell you actually."
"Cas" gave them a little laugh and shook his head. "Ahh yes, because that never gets old, Jared." And then he turned his eyes to Dean. "Anyway, how was your day, baby?"
"Yeah. Yeah, that's right," Dean agreed with a fake smile before turning back to his screen. He opened up a browser and started typing, 'Supernatural the french mistake'.
When it finally connected, he opened his mouth to tell his brother what he'd just realized, but he was interrupted.
"Yeah, right," his younger brother answered sarcastically. "Did you have a fight with Lisa or something?"
"Not to mention we don't have any lines and then there's that stupid director guy that apparently named Bobby after himself getting in our way!"
"Sorry, not sorry," she smiled. Benny followed quickly after her. The two of them had been Dean's best friends since they were children.
"He'll come around," Lisa said with a comforting smile. "He's just being his overprotective self, you know how he gets."
Sam just rolled his eyes at him and continued his breakfast. Dean sat down across from him and waited patiently. He knew his brother would ask eventually.
"I gotta go check something, I'll be back in a couple of minutes," he told his friends before getting up from his seat and heading to the entrance doors. If Sam was still at his locker as he suspected, there wouldn't be any getting out of having lunch together anymore.
When Dean didn't reply and the boy didn't seem like he had anything to add, Dean insisted, "Alright, four of your brothers are in my class. Which one?"
Lucifer suddenly looked at him defensively. "That's the grand question, isn't it? Why did the great Chuck Shurley cast out his own son? Well, you can ask Michael. I'm sure he has a very interesting answer."
Seriously, who did this arrogant asses think they were? Glaring at the guy, he started, "Okay, you listen to me, you dickheads..."
Thinking about his brother he quickly got out his phone. School would be over soon and he doubted he would be back in time.
Something was going on with his brother, that much Sam was sure of. If only he knew what it was. He suspected it had something to do with Cas, since Dean had so pointedly avoided Sam's question about him.
"It's all my fault, I know," Dean finished his sentence. "Now let's go to bed, tomorrow is gonna be a long day."
Lucifer raised an eyebrow. "Of course we are. You really think I'd let an opportunity like that pass me by?"
The world didn't end as they walked in. Of course it didn't, Sam hadn't expected it to but still. He knew things would be different, and it scared him.
"No problem," the boy answered and they started to walk in the way he had pointed to. "Are you new on campus?"
Okay, he'd been here how long and people were already getting on his nerves? He was gonna have to show what he was capable of fast. He turned over to Crowley, smiled and made sure there was no mistaking what he was gonna say. "Okay, pal, I don't do friends and I certainly don't do favors. So if you could please just hand me those sugar-coated strawberries and kindly fuck off, that'd be great."
His friend let out a sigh. "It's late. If I come home now, someone will certainly notice and they will wonder where I've been."
Sam smiled a little. Yeah, he knew Dean would never stop trying. "So what happened with you and Michael?" he changed the subject.
Dean looked insulted. "What's wrong with that? Come on, the guy couldn't have exactly named himself Misha Ackles-Collins, that's just a tongue twister."
They spend a couple of seconds in silence before Michael asked, "So since I've barely talked to you this week, how are you? And how about Sam? You two made up already?"
When their day ended, Dean had already told Charlie he wouldn't need a ride after school. He made his way to the park alone, headphones blasting classic rock into his ears. It would've been nice to have some company and have Cas join him (they could be taking the exact same path, it only made sense) but he understood that his friend couldn't risk being seen by his brothers. Not that Cas had turned the idea down... Dean just hadn't asked. He didn't want to put Cas in any uncomfortable situations. And besides, Dean had no problem having some time to mull over his thoughts while listening to AC/DC.
"Because you are terrible at being in a library," he softly answered the other boy's question with a smirk. "And someone needs to put these poor people out of their misery."
That got Lucifer's attention just as well and he smiled back happily. "I like the way you're thinking, Sammy."
By the time classes started, Dean knew he'd screwed up big time. Challenging Lucifer, getting Cas involved, it was all no good.
"Do you even want to sit with them?" Dean asked before he could stop himself. He hadn't meant to be that rude but he was really wondering.
Castiel looked at him in confusion. "The Trickster? Gabriel's not-" Then something seemed to dawn on him and his shoulders drooped. "Oh."
"Yeah, about that, Adam," Sam started, turning to his younger brother. "Did Jo eventually make the cut?"
"You- Wait, never?" Dean asked, that being the piece of information he could most easily respond to.
"So you wanna tell me what you were doing with Lucifer in an underground club after I explicitly told you you couldn't go?" his older brother elaborated in an annoyed voice.
"Dude, we're going to Hogwarts!" the older Winchester exclaimed, spreading his arms and nearly slapping Adam in the face, who was unfortunate enough to be seated next to him.
Some of the firemen took a couple of steps back when a part of the second floor collapsed. Sam knew what was behind one of those windows right before the foundations gave in. He remembered the blue walls, the messy desk he tried to put straight every time he came over, the double bed her parents hadn't yet allowed him to spend the night in. It was all gone now. But he didn't think he would even care if she was okay.
Dean's jaw clenched at once. "If that son of a bitch is just playing with my little brother for kicks, I swear to-"
He took a deep breath before walking into the school building. This was gonna be awkward... He immediately headed to his locker, where his friends were already waiting as usual. Minus Lisa, that is. He didn't know where she was, but he could easily understand she needed some distance right now. Hell, he needed it just as much.
He heard Dean following closely behind him but he didn't bother looking around. Michael was still waiting by the Impala and as Sam walked to the passenger seat he made damn sure to give him an icy look.
He hadn't seen that one coming. He hesitated a bit, then hastily said, "No. I mean, yes. Well, it depends, I guess. What does that have to do with this?"
Dean swallowed back a sarcastic comment and told him instead, "I need to find a club called The Cage, you know where it is?"
Dean nodded. He could understand that. From what Michael did tell him, he could guess whatever had happened, still went deep. "If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine too, I mean, I'd understand but I was just thinking... maybe if I understood better I could convince Sammy, you know."
"Come on, Sammy, get out of the closet. And by that I mean the one of antisocial isolation, not the other one."
"Now, how about you and that pretty, little ass of yours go find Jensen so we can start shooting in ten, and then we'll finish this...
Once Sam had set off to find Kevin, Dean started his own search. As expected, he eventually spotted Cas with a group of his siblings at one of their lockers. Well, so far for having a conversation in person.
"No, no, I'm sure he wouldn't," Lucifer tried to comfort him, putting a hand on his shoulder. When it didn't seem to work, he grabbed Sam's chin, turned his face back towards him and looked him in the eyes. "Hey," he said. "You're right. He would never do that. Okay?"
He found a hallway students passed less frequently and settled in a corner, hoping people would just ignore him and leave him alone. He didn't want company. He knew his friends meant well but he just couldn't. Their reactions would always be too much for him to bare right now, no matter what they would be. He knew it wasn't fair towards them but there just wasn't anything they could do right. It would always remind of Jessica. And above all, he just wanted to be alone.
Sam rolled his eyes at his brother's childish behavior but he also couldn't suppress a smile at the enthusiasm they all shared.
. Jim Moriarty. Weird kid, no one knows anything about him, even though he's been here for over four years now."
"Alright guys, listen up," Michael started a couple of compartments further down the train and Gabriel rolled his eyes at what without doubt was going to be his family's usual cheering on speech. Hooray.
The Great Hall burst out into applause and Chuck Shurley made his way towards the Head Table. "Thank you!" he said as soon as the students calmed down again. "Thank you, Professor Holmes, for that very warm welcome. Oh and please, just call me Chuck," he added with a broad smile on his face. "I couldn't have expressed better myself how happy we are with the collaboration between our two countries. I know we don't always agree on everything but I'm convinced our students can learn a lot from each other and I look forward to the results of this project. This is the first time in history something like this has been done and that's why I wanted to come over myself and officially accompany these children on such an exciting journey. I'm very proud of the young wizards and witches standing here in front of me, and of our students in general."
Sam stood up, in his head making a list of all the possibilities. All his fellow sophomores were way to serious, so he doubted if it was one of them, and Michael wasn't the type either. He did however have a perfect first candidate.
He let out a mocking laugh. "I wish. I have no idea where the hell he is. That's kind of the problem."
He went to sit in his chair again and handed one to Sam. They both cracked their bottles open and Dean took a big gulp because dammit, he needed one. As soon as the liquid entered his mouth, he made a face. "What is this stuff?"
He grabbed his phone, opened up a search engine and looked for a club named like that in the area. He came up empty however and swore under his breath. While pulling out of the parking lot he tried to think of something, anything, that could point him in the right direction.
He just shrugged while catching up with Michael and heading to his locker together. They'd talked a lot to each other the last couple of weeks and Dean even dared to say they were becoming really good friends. Most of all, Michael had been a huge support for him when it came down to Sammy. Dean had been lost for ways to help his brother with his loss and he'd started to become pretty desperate about what to do next. Luckily Michael had given him some advice and although Sam was still making it hard on him, he finally felt like he was making at least some sort of progress.
Instead he turned around and- holy shit, this guy was big. Okay, Dean wasn't too small himself and in fact he was still growing but he sure as hell hoped this dude was done with his bits. He was one of Cas's older brothers, a senior called Uriel. Dean only knew that because he'd seen him hang around with Michael before, but he'd never really noticed how intimidating this one of the Shurley kids could be.
"There you go." Ellen put down their drinks in front of them. "And your burgers should be ready soon too."
As Gabriel pretended to be deeply insulted and sat back with his arms crossed and his lips pouting, he noticed a little smile on his younger brothers' faces at his ridiculous behavior.
They were silent for a moment after that. Sam wasn't really surprised, Castiel hardly spoke in class too. But if he wasn't talking, he was thinking, and Sam didn't want to think.
Dean nodded to himself and took off, to the bathroom. At least he wouldn't have to face Michael and his following today. This was already going to be stressful enough without yet another argument. He quickly forced any thoughts of stress aside. That was
It was during the last break something finally gained his attention. He had been looking at his feet numbly, just staring off into nothing, when he'd suddenly heard a sound, very soft but surprisingly near. Then he'd looked up and there it was: a lollipop, lying at his feet. He quickly looked around the hallway in an attempt to find whoever dropped it but the only students present were too far off, engaged in their own conversations. Nobody even seemed to have noticed it happening.
"I begged him," Lucifer interrupted him, looking down as if he was embarrassed to tell Sam. "After he'd taken me aside and told me he wanted me to move in with him, I was over the moon. He took care of all the paperwork and before I knew it, he was taking me home. It was all nice and fun at first but I couldn't stop thinking about John - Michael. I missed him like crazy. Before the end of the week I was begging Chuck to take me back to the foster home or get Michael too."
Castiel tilted his head and frowned. "Don't you think that if you were really in love with her, you would think of her more often?"
"We don't really. Michael just wanted someone from our class. Hannah is the most sociable one but she already had plans, so I guess that's why he chose me."
"Rough day, I get it. I'll let you be," his husband said, and then he left and Dean wanted to bang his head against a wall.
He tried to avoid his friends. Sure, in the morning he had to deal with a hug of a crying Lisa and Kevin had come up to him to pet him on the shoulder reassuringly, but then he had left them with Dean and went to find a place of his own.
He should have gone to his class, but at the moment school was the least of his worries. Luckily he still remembered where Sam was during first period.
"Dean and I talked," he said, fingers caressing the other boy's. "He said he'd be okay with getting to know you a little bit better. Like, we could all have lunch together, or you could come over for dinner if you'd want to."
Okay fine, maybe Sam hadn't seen that one coming but that didn't mean he was gonna drop his guard. "No?"
They went in and picked out their usual seats. Dean let out a sigh, glad this day could finally return to normal.
Bobby frowned at him. "Of course not, you have any idea what time it is? I've been here for hours! I don't know where the two of you have been, but you sure as hell kept me busy. Called all of your friends to find you."
Something inside of Dean's stomach welled up at that but he didn't pay attention to it. He just smiled at the boy who was starting to feel like his best friend more and more every single day.
Everybody had told him the pain and hurt would fade away but so far they hadn't. But Sam had found another way to deal with his feelings.
For a second he didn't know what to say. Then he decided he might as well try to take advantage of Gabriel talking to him like a decent person.
His friend looked down at the absence of anything to break his fall. "That is an accurate question."
He sighed and leaned against the bus sign. He nearly hoped the thing would finally fall over and put some action in his day. Once again he considered putting in his earbuds but decided against it. He wanted to make sure he would hear if Castiel arrived. He heard another bus approaching and waved it away.
Dean felt a sting in his heart for his friend. "But still," he continued. "I mean... Shit, I don't know, man."
Castiel uncomfortably followed Dean and his brother to their car. Why did Gabriel always have to embarrass him like that? Not that he didn't like the Winchesters - on the contrary, Dean had been incredibly nice to him - but he didn't want to be a burden to them.
Lucifer tilted his head, a pensive look on his face. "Actually..." he started and for a moment Sam was scared of what he would say, but then he continued, "I kinda had something else planned for us."
leave us to ourselves without a proper reason why, without a promise to come back or without someone to have our backs in case of an emergency. Michael, you can't just put up with that!"
"You're kidding me, right?" he asked, eyebrows raised in disbelief. Even Cas couldn't be that sheltered, could he? With the parties Balthazar threw, how was that even an option?
Bored, he started swinging his stick a little. He had already folded the thing because he preferred relying on Castiel as they took the bus.
"Finally," he commented as they got out. Then he glanced at Michael. "I see you brought one of the wonder boys."
Sam couldn't believe what he was hearing. The way Lucifer and Michael talked about each other... He never could've imagined them caring that much about one another.
A couple of hours later Dean was again parked in front of Kansas University, waiting for his little brother to show. Sam was five minutes overdue now, but it wouldn't be the first time he was a little late because he had some questions for his professors. Dean didn't worry. His brother could manage on his own.
"Still doesn't explain why you had to drag Dean into all of this," Sam noted, and Gabriel rolled his eyes dramatically.
When he got to them, he turned to his girlfriend at once. "Hey, can we hang out after school a bit?" he softly spoke, so the others wouldn't hear. "I need to talk to you."
His family, his friends, they all tried to help but there wasn't really anything they could do. So he shut them out. He felt empty, he felt so terribly empty and he couldn't do anything about it, because the alternative was even worse.
"He's the school's latest newcomer, the one I told you about," Michael said softly. "His name is Lucifer."
Doing homework with Lucifer turned out to not be the most productive thing in the world. Which was a nice way of saying Sam didn't get a thing done because his friend kept doing things he wasn't supposed to do in a library, bother other people or distract him in just any other way possible. Eventually Sam decided to take matters into his own hands and leave before they were kicked out by an already looking annoyed librarian.
The thought of Michael having him made the corner of Dean's mouth turn up. Then he realized what Michael had just said and frowned. "Wait, are you saying your brother only has become friends with mine because we are? You're joking, right?"
Sam shrugged. "From the looks of it, it's got a pretty steady fanbase, even after all the years. They're all over the country."
Dean cursed under his breath and took another sip from his beer. "Was that what was going on there in the background?"
"I love you too," he replied. And that was the truth. He did love her. He just didn't know in what way anymore.
"Thanks, Cas," Dean sighed as he got up. The other boy let go of him and he rubbed the now painful spot on his upper arm. "Jesus, man," he joked. "Who are you and where did you get so strong? That's gonna leave a bruise."
Groaning in annoyance, Gabriel rolled his eyes. "For the last time, I don't want anything to do with the family feud. You think if I was doing this for Michael, I wouldn't have told him about you and Castiel being friends again?"
Dean moved up his pace and reached the entrance just at the moment the school bell rang. He hurried to his history class, not once looking back.
When the bell finally rang, he almost ran out of class and made his way to Sam's locker. His brother arrived a little later, busy talking to Kevin.
Michael looked at him like he'd just offended the guy. "He betrayed my father and everything my family stood for!"
"Actually we've never really met," Dean said. Not that it really mattered. Everyone at Ilvermorny knew who Michael was.
. But since it was about his precious daddy, it apparently is enough of a reason to shame me for the rest of eternity!" he finished sarcastically.
He guessed Castiel was just... really something special. And he swore to himself he'd be damned if he let go of that.
Sam shrugged. "Like I said, I knew you didn't like Lucifer. And also, I didn't know how you'd feel about... you know..." He made some vague gesture and then it hit Dean.
in a way, and to see it like this, dressed up as a set for some stupid TV show... It made Sam feel comforted and angry at the same time.
Even Sam couldn't help but smile at that. There was nothing his brother wouldn't do for family and he knew it. "And we always will be," he answered, meeting Dean's green eyes, and all five of them smiled at the thought of the small group of friends that was their home.
"I don't know where it is," Michael quickly added. "I only know it's a private, underground club Lucifer is a member of. That's all."
As soon as he'd spoken the words, he abruptly fell silent and Dean knew exactly what he was thinking. They exchanged a look of surprise, both realizing it at the exact same time.
he told himself, getting out his phone to text Cas. He really wished he could tell his friend about all of it. Gabriel had sworn him to secrecy though, and with all of the secrets the guy seemed to know, Dean was pretty sure he didn't want to piss him off.
Although he couldn't immediately spot someone he knew in the hallway, Sam felt a little uncomfortable having this conversation in public. "You mind going somewhere a little bit more quiet?"
"Alright kids," Professor Singer started. "I know it's late and you're hungry, so I promise after we go in and you're sorted into your Houses, you can all go stuff your faces. But some people gotta give some speeches first so hold it until they're finished, would ya?"
Lucifer looked at him with actual terror in his eyes. "Please tell me you're talking about the island."
"See you!" he called with a little wave as she walked away. His brother was lucky with a girlfriend like Lisa.
"I don't understand!" Lucifer basically begged. "I still don't get it, why?! I've been thinking and thinking and I... I mean, we had a fight a couple of days earlier but we had fights all the time! It wasn't any different so why..." He shook his head before burying it in his hands. Sam didn't know what to say. Everything he came up with just felt like it wasn't enough. So they just sat in silence for couple of seconds before Lucifer looked up again and ran his fingers through his hair. "He was my best friend. I trusted him. And then he betrayed me and I don't even know why."
Dean quickly checked to see if none of Michael's family members were around before dropping his voice almost to a whisper. "It's Cas, okay?"
He spent the weekend mainly in his room. He could see Dean was worried about him but he was too tired to care. The days flashed by one by one, seemingly endlessly. He hadn't slept properly since the fire. Every time he closed his eyes he saw the house, or worse, he saw Jess. The nightmares were eating him alive.
didn't even really bother him. Dean had been right, the height difference was kinda ironic, but at the same time Sam found something quite enjoyable about it.
"Yes, of course!" Sam immediately answered and he mentally kicked himself for forgetting to text the other boy. "Did you ask your mom?"
Dean squinted at him. "Why would I trust you? For all I know, none of this is true and Michael put you up to this to get to Lucifer."
"It was just him actually," Sam answered, embarrassed. "I don't really know any of the others. Although I have to admit they're all a little bit weird."
"Thanks, Dean," he softly said, and then, because he knew how much his brother hated chick flick moments, "You promise not to shoot him?"
When he'd arrived to his physics class, usually the most boring one of all, it had been chaos. Pure, absolute chaos.
He needed Cas. Shit, had he really just thought that? It was true though, deep down he knew it was. Ever since the Shurleys had moved to Lawrence, his life had been turned completely upside down, but Cas had been the one constant through it all.
The words made him fluster again but that didn't mean Sam completely lost all of his common sense. "I do have homework, you know."
He ran out of the apartment, down the stairs, through the building's front door. With every step, despite himself, he strained his ears, secretly hoping that maybe, just maybe... But Lucifer wasn't going to follow him. And it broke his heart.
Anyway, no matter how unfortunate it was that Cas couldn't sit with them, at least his little brother finally would again, even if that included Lucifer, and Dean couldn't be happier about it.
Dean laughed. "Dude, I'd be surprised if I knew the day before I started college. I mean, I honestly don't even know if want to go to college."
Michael nodded. "I know what they're called but that's it. I have no idea if they're more or less the same as ours. Their names are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Hopefully the teachers will tell us something more about them when we get there. I'll definitely try to find out what I can before the sorting ceremony."
"Okay then." Ellen looked from one to the other, an expression on her face that Dean couldn't quite place. "I'll be right back with your drinks."
He was tired. Tired of Sam being secretive and doing who knows what in his spare time, tired of Michael and that Naomi girl (who he didn't even know!) giving him dirty looks, tired of Cas playing hide and seek and fucking tired of school.
But now he was going to see Cas at school and there would be no avoiding it. That was if Michael hadn't locked him up in a dungeon to prevent him from seeing Dean anyway. A couple of weeks ago Dean would have said that even Michael couldn't be that crazy but nowadays he honestly didn't know anymore.
Dean turned around right on time to see the Shurley come to a stop a couple of yards away. They shared an awkward look and then Michael walked past them without looking back. Dean watched him go to his locker, where a couple of his siblings were standing as well.
"I don't believe that." Dean wondered to himself how it had gotten this far. Had it always been like this? Or had Chuck Shurley's departure just been the final drop?
Even though he should have known this would be the ideal place for a guy like Crowley to hang around, Sam was still surprised to see him. Not that it really mattered. He didn't know Crowley that well. For a long time yes, but he'd never really been friends with him like Dean had. So he just turned away and looked out for Lucifer to get back.
That definitely got Sam's attention. He suddenly had a feeling he might finally find out if there was more to his brother's friendship with Castiel than he had led on. He knew better than to say that out loud though, so he kept it at a simple, "Yeah."
"Hey," he started. "How about you stay here for the night? Sam's not home-" Dean didn't like that fact at all but he guessed he was gonna have to get used to it. He just hoped his brother and Lucifer weren't sleeping in the same bed yet. "- so there's an empty bed anyway. And you can borrow some of my stuff."
Dean suddenly realized he'd never told Cas exactly why he'd met up with Michael. "Cas, I... I did like him, I think, but I turned him down."
Lucifer got up and was already starting to walk towards the kitchen when Sam stopped him. "Lucifer."
Without further ado Balthazar tore a small piece of paper out of Dean's notebook and before he got a chance to protest, the guy had taken his pen and started scribbling something down. "It's Saturday night and starts at eleven. This is the address. You know King Avenue, right?"
Lucifer tilted his head and shrugged innocently. "You know, one moment you're messing around with Google and the next..."
Of course he knew he was acting like a complete idiot but he couldn't help it. Michael's brother was right, it really wasn't that big a deal but only the thought of Michael thinking about him that way made him feel extremely uncomfortable. On the other hand, Michael was a great friend and Dean honestly didn't want to lose him.
"By the look on his face I'm getting he got the Pukwudgie kid," Dean grinned and then looked at his brother. "Guess that leaves you and me, Sammy. Good luck."
And they were. The three brothers were in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, the final stage of the long journey they'd undertaken since leaving Ilvermorny. They were all beyond excited at this unique experience, Dean was just the only one showing it this much. But that didn't change the fact the Winchesters had indeed been offered an opportunity of a lifetime. As Sam looked out of the window, he wondered what the odds were of being selected for the brand-new exchange program between Hogwarts and Ilvermorny. There were about thirty children on this train right now, all of them at different years and from different Houses. Now, Sam didn't know how many applicants there'd been but he figured quite a lot. This was only a trial, so who knew if they'd get another chance next year?
There was another frown growing on  Cas's forehead and Dean had trouble not rolling his eyes as dramatically as possible.
"Alright," Dean mumbled, then turned his attention back to Lisa. "You wanna have lunch with my dad at the Roadhouse on Saturday?"
"Well, I'm sorry you had to come all this way for nothing," Dean sighed. After a couple seconds of silence he added, "I didn't know you two knew each other that well."
"Okay, Sammy, what's going on?" Lucifer asked with a frown. "You've been distracted all day. Did something happen?"
"Exactly." Balthazar leaned down and rested his arms on the table. "I'm hosting another party. Now, my brother may not be your biggest fan at the moment but you have a lot of friends, people seem to like you and it's not at our house anyway. There will be plenty of girls, or guys in case Michael completely turned around the way you're swinging, and booze. What do you think?"
"I don't think I can take this anymore," he sighed during the lunch break on Tuesday. Today had been the worst day of all and he couldn't wait to get home. "Who would do this to me? And why?"
"How would you know?" Sam answered, grabbing Lucifer's hand and taking a leap himself. "You barely know me."
"Yeah?" Misha answered, reappearing into view, and there was a slimmer of hope in his eyes. Great, now Dean felt even worse.
Dean laughed and shook his head. Then he held out his hand and helped Cas from his make-shift pedestal. Glad this hell was finally over, he opened the door.
"Oh no, you're not gonna 'see' anything," Dean said. He wasn't going to let Crowley fool him twice. "You're gonna get in there and when you come back, my brother is with you, understand?"
John shrugged. "Oh well, you've heard what the Sorting Hat said, we're supposed to represent courage. Our colors are gold and red, as you can probably tell, and our common room is in the Gryffindor tower, which we will show you later. See that man next to Professor Holmes?"
Dean shrugged. "Don't want some freshman kids to go gossiping about us before we even get a chance to tell anybody ourselves."
The fire fighters had already arrived and now tried to gain control of the fire. In the back of his mind he could hear Dean swear but the words didn't really sink in. When the car stopped, he immediately got out, took a few steps towards the house, then suddenly came to a halt again. His thoughts were racing through his head but he couldn't think. He didn't know what to do. So he just stood there, frozen in space and time.
"We were four years old," Lucifer told Sam, "when one day Chuck walked in. He was looking for a foster kid to adopt. Now, adoption isn't exactly like you're going grocery shopping so he came by several times, sometimes a couple of days in a row. He wanted to get to know us all a bit better, see who he got along with best."
"Okay, first of all," Mick retorted, "he's not a sociopath and you know it. And secondly, he loves me and I love him."
And then he saw it. The same house he'd visited at least twice a week for over a year now. The house that had welcomed him like a son. The house he'd gotten to know as well as his own.
Her eyes were filled with tears, but she gave him a small smile. "Just a break? Nothing permanent?" she asked in a weak voice.
Sam let out something that resembled a broken laugh. "I don't care what they want," he said in a near whisper. "I care what
"I'm sorry..." he quickly started. It wasn't like he didn't mean it, he did mean, but he hadn't been planning on telling Lucifer now, not while they were in the middle of-
by Kansas. Sam hadn't heard of them but he knew how much Dean liked to play cassettes in the Impala and after tonight he would have something to make up for.
His friend seemed to think about that for a moment, and Dean watched the way the wind played with his dark hair while he waited for a reply. He didn't know what he was hoping to hear. He never meant to start a vendetta with the Shurleys but he wasn't planning on letting them scare him either. Cas didn't have to get involved with that. Being friends behind Michael's back was one thing but Dean had the feeling it wouldn't continue to be that easy.
"Now we're talking," Dean said with a grin. "C'mon, you can bring Jess. And Kevin if you want to." Kevin was one of Sam's closest friends, which basically meant they were both nerds.
Sam really wanted to facepalm himself. Clearly the wrong answer. "Oh no, yeah of course," he quickly tried to correct himself. "He does, he just, uhm, isn't sure... when. Yet." He prayed to Chuck that was a reasonable reply and that it wouldn't backfire at him.
Michael's gaze dropped a little and Dean found himself finally able to breathe again, dropping his arms and quickly taking a step back.
When he didn't immediately get a response, Sam looked up at Gabriel again. The older Shurley was staring at his phone and Sam wondered if something else had come up on it.
Before his brother could get any worse, Sam decided to intervene. "All I'm saying is I'm happy for you, man."
They exchanged a look and remained silent. Sam didn't want to keep fighting about this. It was stupid and useless and he knew they were never gonna agree on the subject anyway. And he had to admit he also knew Bobby wouldn't be happy about it.
Dean nodded. "Sure." And then he decided he was just gonna ask. "So what happened with the meeting Lucifer plan?"
"He's not someone you should be worried about though," Balthazar filled in, then subtly pointed towards a slim boy with dark, neatly combed back hair who was sitting by himself. "If you want to worry about someone, do it about
He got his backpack and put on his trench coat, waiting by the front door of the small two-storied apartment they rented.
"Mike, I really don't see the problem, alright? I mean, I think it would actually do all of you some good. All this fighting, don't you see how stupid it is?"
Sam landed in a big pool next to Lucifer, who started laughing like crazy again. Sure, Sam had already been completely soaked from the rain but now there was dirt on his clothes too. Still he chuckled a little as well before getting back up.
Sam gave him a little nod. Dean had been so close to Michael for a pretty long time, he guessed it made sense Lucifer was nervous the older Winchester would still judge him.
Without wasting even a second he unlocked the door, got in and turned on the engine, all the while going through his contacts on his phone. Michael jumped in the passenger seat just in time before he took off.
Actually there was one person Sam would like to talk to. And apparently his feet agreed because after who knows how long he found himself at the entrance of the cemetery. He walked in and followed the familiar path. Passing by his mother's grave, he let his fingers trace the cold surface for a second before continuing to a patch that was a little further back. When he got there, he let his legs finally give way and dropped into the grass. Through his tears, he stared at the inscription.
Slightly confused at what was happening, Dean tried to figure out what the noise was all about. He could hear loud voices and maybe even a door slamming, so he gathered someone must have been having a fight. He waited and listened as the sounds started to fade out and then suddenly everything went quiet.
Misha frowned. "Nervous? Babe, you've done panels a thousand times. Jared will be there right with you, I'll be backstage... Everyone's gonna be there. Come on, you love seeing everyone at cons, especially the actors who aren't on anymore."
"Thought we could use some peace right about now," Dean agreed. "You shouldn't have done what you did this morning, Cas."
He took a deep breath and told himself to just ignore it. The sooner he figured out what exactly was going on, the sooner they would be back home, in their own bunker, without stupid lighting equipment. With that thought in mind he walked out of the set and followed the sound of voices coming from somewhere else in the building. When he rounded another corner, he finally found the source, a group of people, some of them talking to each other, others walking around the sets with a clipboard or other equipment. He was just about to approach them, ask if they maybe noticed something strange on set yesterday, when one of the guys started walking into the direction he was coming from. The man was a lot shorter than Sam and wore a white and blue baseball cap which made it impossible to see his face, being too focused on a bundle of papers in his hand that Sam assumed was a script. It was only when he did finally look up, that Sam froze in his steps. A fraction of a second was all it took for him to recognize that face, even behind the slight beard and heavy-framed glasses.
"We're Thunderbirds, yeah I get it," Sam finished the family motto their dad used to say when they were younger. He knew that wasn't what his brother was going to say but Dean'd sure as hell thought it. "Except that I'm not. And neither is Adam, even though no one seems to care about that since his mom was a Pukwudgie as well."
He turned to Cas to see his reaction. Like most of the time, his friend was slightly squinting as he observed their surroundings, but there was the start of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
"Nothing more than paying attention," the British guy proclaimed. "It's very easy, actually. Everyone could do it. On pretty much anything."
Sam was nowhere to be found and on his kitchen table lay a note from his dad, saying he got another job.
Unfortunately, they couldn't find any clues on how to get home. There had been no sightings of anything strange or even remotely nearing the supernatural. No suspicious activities or weird behavior. (Well, except for their own maybe.)
Castiel gave a little nod and walked up to his brother, who seemed to be listening to them very attentively. Dean waved them off before stepping back in the driver seat. As they walked up to their building, Castiel turned around a last time to wave goodbye to Sam, who was watching them walk away with a smile on his face. When they got to their front door, the Impala roared back to life and took off again.
He immediately shook his head, afraid that he'd accidentally maybe hurt Lucifer's feelings. "No. No, of course not, it's just that..." He couldn't stop a blush from spreading across his cheeks. "Don't you think that this is maybe moving a bit fast?"
"Oh yes, of course!" the witch called. "A piece of pumpkin tart then? I also have Cauldron Cakes if you'd like."
"So? How hot were they?" the smaller Novak asked. "I gotta say, I definitely thought the deaf kid was cute."
When they went their separate ways, Dean thanked the younger boy another time and they said their goodbyes for now. While walking to his classroom, Dean mentally made a list of all the things he had to do next:
"You know, we can still hang out a little longer," Lucifer said and then suggestively pulled up his eyebrows. "At my place, for example."
No, things weren't just magically going to be alright. If Dean wanted this mess to work out, he would have to make it work out.
"Until one day two years ago Dad came home again, this time with twins," Lucifer said and Sam could hear his voice hardening.
Within an instant Dean walked over to him, and Castiel took the mug from Sam's hands just in time before he got up and met his older brother in a tight hug. Dean held him close while Sam buried his face in his shoulder, crying silently.
"Okay, so obviously they've all been adopted," she answered Sam's question. "But more importantly, they're legendary."
Dean shook his head to himself while he opened the fridge to grab the bacon and some eggs. "You don't have to just keep standing there, you know. Those chairs were kinda made to sit on."
During his first break, Dean got run over by some dude he didn't even know who was speeding down the hallways on a skateboard? Then in his next class, all of his stuff mysteriously rolled off his table and when he had to crouch underneath to get everything, one of the legs gave in and the entire piece of furniture landed on top of his head. It wasn't very heavy and apart from a lump he was fine, but that didn't mean he wasn't getting a lot more pissed with every second. Hoping comfort food would help him feel at least a tiny bit better, he ate one of the small sausages he'd brought from home as a snack but ended up nearly choking on it. He quickly put them away again after that. Since he still smelt like a chemistry lab, every time he scratched his head, pink chunks would be stuck underneath his nails and he had an hour of anyway, Dean decided for the first time in his life to actually use the gym showers for a change. Maybe it was that same inexperience with them, maybe they were just remarkably slippy, fact was that he slipped in them at least three times and came out with even more bruises. At lunch, his tacos tasted funny and with the bad luck he was having today, he wasn't gonna risk it. When in his next class he got out his phone to text Cas to distract him, the thing actually sent a shock through his arm that made him drop/threw it out of instinct and left him with a broken phone. And then at last there was the dog. Oh, that dog. Dean didn't even wanna talk about the dog.
Gabriel smoothly slipped in between, blocking his way. "Whoa there, not so fast, buddy. I know what you're thinking but it's not true."
She came to a stop immediately and the shock in her dark eyes made him almost take it back. Why did it have to be this hard? He didn't want to hurt her.
After about half an hour, Bobby finally got there with his truck. He didn't question the situation, Dean's face told him enough for now. They loaded up the Impala together and drove home without saying a word.
Chewing his bottom lip, Dean thought about a way to answer that that he wasn't going to regret. "Look, you're right, okay?" he eventually acknowledged. "I don't know Lucifer. But what I've heard about him - and not just from Michael - isn't pretty. So," he sighed, "you can't blame me for doing everything in my power to warn you about him. And if you still like him after that, then that's fine by me. I can't tell you how to live your life. But just be careful, okay?"
"Everyone of us had heard what was going on," Michael said, a deep frown on his forehead. "Dad had made his decision. And then he called me."
If you've read everything that was posted before, first of all, thank you so much for your support!! Wouldn't be doing this if it weren't for you. And second, you'll already have read over half of this one BUT there's a final new piece underneath the squiggles. Hope you enjoy it, and I'll try to get the next chapter to you soon!
This was the guy who had been playing pranks on him? He didn't even know his name! What could he have possibly done to draw this boy's attention?
When he pressed 'enter', the screen filled itself with hits, the first one already being pretty obvious.
The red Corvette came to a halt in front of a fancy apartment complex. Sam looked up at the building in surprise. Lucifer had told him he got his own place after moving out of his dad's house, but he surely hadn't been expecting this.
His apparently husband rolled his eyes at the clear forlornness on his face. "Bottom cupboard at the far left. Seriously, what would you do without me?" he muttered, turning back to the food.
Dean had rarely felt like cringing this much. "Uhm... just, well, you know..." He cleared his throat. "I mean, after Monday I just thought... well, since things didn't exactly go... you know..."
A lump formed in his throat as he thought about the last time Dad had come back from a job. They'd all gone to the Roadhouse together, Dean and Lisa, him and... Jess. Had it really been that long ago already? It seemed like forever. He remembered the day their father had taken off again. It was the same day he'd met Lucifer and first gone to The Cage. He smiled at the memory and decided to focus on that one.
Since he was trying to avoid his friends - some more in particular than others - for the rest of the day, Dean sent his brother a text to ask if the two of them could have lunch together. He needed to talk to Sam anyway and it was a very reasonable excuse.
Mick greeted him quickly before his gaze wandered towards the boy across from Dean. The American kid with his neat, black hair had mostly just been eating in silence but occasionally looked up at their conversation.
"He just gave you a couple hundred bucks," Sam huffed. "Don't you think it's time to bury the axe now?"
He nodded while answering Dean's text. "It's been a while but I'm really looking forward to it. We've got so much catching up to do, so many things I need to tell him, I..." He fell quiet as he looked up to Lucifer's expectant expression.
When Sam looked back at his brother, Dean's eyes were filled with confusion, shock, disgust and just enough rage. "What did he do to you?"
The boy looked him in the eye and he was taken aback by how blue they were. The contrast with his dark hair was actually quite beautiful. But he also saw something in them he couldn't quite identify. Hurt? Acceptance?
"Yeah, I can see that," Dean laughed. Then he gave Castiel a soft smile. "And by the way? I think it's pretty fucking awesome."
"Wait, are you saying you don't like what it's done to me?" Dean interrupted his thoughts and Sam's jaw dropped. Was his brother being
His little brother stared at him. Then stared some more and realized Dean wasn't joking. Eventually, he opened his mouth to say something but couldn't figure out what, so he closed it again and just continued the staring.
Now he was completely clueless. "Dean," he asked his brother. "What is this? What's going on?" And then it hit him. Dean didn't like Lucifer, even though he'd never met him, and he hadn't wanted Sam to go out tonight. "How did you know I was here?"
Sam gave him a strange look but didn't push, and Dean went back to the living room to watch some TV.
Dean wasn't stupid. He didn't miss the slight fluster that suddenly appeared on Sam's face, he just told himself he'd probably rather not know. Sam was a big boy, he could handle himself.
Michael nodded and smiled. "That's right. And well, Wampus captain but I'm guessing that's not gonna happen here."
"Isn't it?" Sam snapped at him. He hadn't realized he was this pissed, hell, maybe he wasn't even this pissed with Dean, but the ball of frustration in his stomach had apparently chosen to come out at this very moment. "'Cause he was being pretty damn clear when he said you two concocted a way to get me to break up with Lucifer. You even gave him permission to mess with you!"
He hadn't thought it was possible, but now Sam was feeling even more guilty than before. He tried to think about a solution but with Dad home there was no way he'd have any spare time this weekend. He also couldn't cancel on Kevin, he'd already neglected their friendship enough as it was. But... he really did want to see Lucifer's place. He had been curious about it from the moment Lucifer had told him he'd left the Shurleys and lived on his own now. Sam cursed inwardly and got out his phone.
He let out a deep sigh and dropped back his head. You know what, it wasn't his problem. If Gabriel wanted to talk to Sam, Dean had nothing to do with that. Besides, if whatever Gabriel had to say really was bullshit, Sam would see right through it. He was more than smart enough.
He showed it to Dean. "Jared Padalecki," he whispered. "Vancouver. Jensen. That ring any bells to you?"
He watched as Castiel drew his phone from his pocket, and the corner of his mouth turned up automatically. He saw Cas reading his message and starting to type back.
That's why he'd wanted to tell the other boy about the note he got from Balthazar. Unfortunately, he eventually had to decide against it. The words had been very clear and Dean had to admit he'd feel bad about betraying that trust, even if it was Balthazar's.
Michael stopped laughing immediately and looked at Crowley in shock, while Dean's eyebrows shot up in disbelief. "Lucifer is the
Dean hadn't been able to find Gabriel yesterday but he decided to let it pass. It was very obvious the guy didn't wanna be found.
He'd done this, Sam just knew it. He didn't know how but he didn't even care. He looked back at Azazel, at the fire, then at the Shurley boy. Normally he might have laughed at it. Now all he could see were the flames Azazel was desperately trying to stamp out.
Right now, he was gonna look for Cas, which wasn't too hard seeing the Shurleys had also claimed their usual spots. Not that Dean was as stupid to actually try and approach them but he did want to see Cas's reaction to his texts.
He entered the room, put down his bag and leaned against the teacher's desk while Lucifer closed to door.
Dean was having the time of his life with the look on their faces and burst out in laughter. "So far for the smart kids, huh?"
Sam explained with a smile on his face. He found it pretty amusing that in that aspect, Dean and Gabriel were a lot more alike than either of them would probably ever want to hear.
Lucifer opened the door and walked out. Or at least he attempted to walk out. To his surprise however, Sam saw him stumble as he put a step forward before slipping and falling over, right on his face. As the younger boy looked down in shock, he noticed the floor was covered in small marbles.
Dean thought to himself, turning back to the front. He was well aware Charlie could be a very persistent person.
Desperate to change the topic, Sam brought up what had kept his mind busy while Dean was off to Cross Road. "Hey, what was Castiel doing here?"
He spotted the Shurley family table almost immediately. Michael, in the middle of them as usual, was looking their way, and so was the girl from his class Dean now knew was called Naomi. As soon as they noticed him watching, they turned away of course. Why the hell were they looking at them like that? Maybe it was nothing but Dean had a feeling it was the exact opposite. And he didn't like it one bit.
In the meantime Michael looked back in annoyance, trying to figure out what all of the fuss in the back of the group was about. He couldn't see who it was though, so he turned back just in time to hear Professor Hudson call the next name.
At the end, after a lot of misunderstandings and awkward silences, Castiel had agreed to meet up with him tomorrow morning before school. Normally he'd hate to get up that early but this was an emergency. He had to talk about this before he came face to face with Michael again and Castiel was the only one who knew what was going on. At least Dean hoped not all the Shurleys did.
The more Lucifer neared the car, the bigger Sam's smile became. When Lucifer finally reached him, he got in the car immediately, while asking "You ready?"
"Apparently they're all very religious." Then Lisa remained silent, making the rest of them lean closer in tension. When she was satisfied with their interest, she continued, "And bisexual."
Still slightly out of air, Sam gave a small shrug. "Just... checking, I guess..." he tried but he knew he'd fucked up again and immediately regretted his decision. He never should've brought it up, he couldn't believe he'd actually been so stupid. "I'm sorry, I just thought... Well, you never really told me..."
His friend sighed, "Don't you think it's a little bit coincidental we become close friends and then one day they suddenly do too?"
how he wanted to go into this. This was Cas, and Cas was the exact opposite of stressful. Dean knew how he felt about him. If he was being perfectly honest with himself, he knew what he wanted. Now he just had to find a way to actually say it.
For a moment they both considered telling the other what was going on. And then refrained. Sam because he knew Dean just hated Lucifer, and maybe also a bit because he didn't know how Dean would react to him having kissed with a guy. Dean because he actually still didn't know what there was to tell and because he simply was being an insecure piece of shit.
He opened his mouth several times, but... nothing came out. Groaning in desperation, Dean buried his head in hands. "I suck at this."
They kept on talking like that for hours, John ordered them pizza and they spent the rest of the evening chatting about school, their girlfriends and the places John had visited for work this time.
"I'm sure they'll be an example of the same values they were taught at Ilvermorny and try their very best to complete this exchange successfully. We are incredibly grateful for the chance they've been offered and the welcome that they're given, which I'm sure is just as warm as the one the Hogwarts students are receiving right now at Ilvermorny. Now, it's been a long trip and we're all hungry, so I won't keep you any longer and just want to wish you good luck and a wonderful, enlightening experience. Thank you."
Either way, he dropped Cas off at Cross Road and made his way back home. There he grabbed another beer and went to lie on the coach.
"Michael, that's not an excuse!" Dean interrupted him. "Oh my god, did the guy really just drop all of you off here?"
The silence spread out between them again and Dean decided he needed another beer. Unfortunately, he was too lazy to get it.
Sam knew Dean well enough to realize how this conversation would go long before he stepped through the front door. The way his brother's eyebrows slightly furrowed and his mouth turned into a harsh, straight line only confirmed it. Sam couldn't blame him. He knew he looked like a mess. He felt like a mess too. He could tell there were bags underneath his eyes due to lack of sleep without even having to look into a mirror. All of the crying he'd done probably had an impact on that as well.
"I sure hope so," Dean joked. "You free that night?" He immediately realized how that sounded and quickly added, "I mean, I'd maybe like to talk to you about it afterwards if you don't mind. You don't have to, I'd understand, I've been bothering you with my shit enough lately and if you don't want to..."
Gabriel walked towards the elevator while Castiel locked the apartment. By the time he joined his brother, Gabriel had gotten his jacket on and was patiently waiting for the elevator to arrive.
Dean was in front of his bedroom, building up the courage to go in. Of course it was his room too and he knew he was being ridiculous but since the fire Sam had barely left it and Dean only got in to sleep, wanting to give his brother some privacy to deal with his emotions. It didn't help he knew Sam wasn't going to be very happy with what he had to say.
He was wandering through the Lawrence city center. After crossing basically the entire town he had decided to park the Impala and search the shopping centers by foot. He ignored the shops he usually would at least take a look at and hastily paced through the hallways and streets. He knew the chance he would come across someone he knew was one in a million but he had to try.
Crowley shrugged. "You asked if I knew where The Cage is, so I showed you. You'd think you'd be happy I did you a favor."
"Only Sammy here." He motioned towards his brother, who by now probably got he wasn't going to be very involved in this conversation. "He's in law school. I'm working as a mechanic."
Normally Castiel would probably just have turned away and continued eating, maybe smile polite first, but he remembered what Michael had told him about "making friends". So he decided a first attempt wouldn't hurt and smiled at the girl, raising his hand in a small wave.
Then he heard a series of movements and he tilted his head in curiosity, trying to figure out what it was. The sound stopped but was then resumed a little more to his right, with a little change in pitch.
The Shurley boy walked past some lockers and tapped one of them. A couple of seconds later the owner tried to open it and it slammed right into their face. Sam couldn't help but laugh at the practical joke, although he had no idea how the guy had pulled it off. It didn't matter, the Trickster was long gone. He hadn't even turned around to watch when the locker had burst open.
"Nooo," Sam sang. "I only had water Dean I ssswear. But... something is really really really wrooong." Then his brother whispered, "I think somewone is... tricking me."
"He couldn't make it," she said, quickly exchanging a look with Dean. They both knew Benny probably just hadn't felt like coming. Sure, Dean was his best friend and he also liked Charlie and the others, but he wasn't that keen on new people and Dean and Charlie respected that.
His thoughts were interrupted by the door of the compartment opening and Charlie and Kevin walking through.
"No," Gabriel said to his relief. "Despite the grumpy arrogance you're a good friend to him and he deserves someone like that. But, Dean?"
Crowley slowly walked up to him, Michael following behind and immediately taking place at Dean's side.
Gabriel may or may not have snorted at the man's name and Michael may or may not have slapped him against the back of his head for it.
Dean decided he was gonna have to take the poor guy out way more often to show him the many joys of life outside of the classroom.
"I don't know, honey. Maybe you just have a bad day," Jess tried to comfort him. "Don't worry about it. School's almost over and tonight we're going to a party, remember?"
They got in and as they drove off, the only thing Sam could think about was the words that had almost come out of his mouth earlier.
Apparently his brother felt the same way, because he cleared his throat before mumbling, "Right." Then he added, "Wait, so you just got here?"
"What do you want for dinner?" Dean asked. "Don't really feel like cooking to be honest. We can order take-out. Or go to the Roadhouse, say hi. Wait," he interrupted himself. "Never mind, we
He didn't even have to think twice about it. "Yes, I'd also like ten Chocolate Frogs, five packs of Jelly Slugs, two boxes of Bertie Bott's and... what's the blue thing?"
When Dean gave him a defiant look in return, the kid put up his hands in defense. "Sorry, didn't mean to offend you or something."
Gabriel rounded his lips. "You know, height for starters. I had a feeling they were tall. Were they tall?"
When it came to the Trickster himself, Sam hadn't had any contact with him anymore. Whenever he passed the Shurley, he just gave the other boy a glare before looking away. He was ignored completely anyway.
"What the..." he started mumbling before it suddenly dawned on him that the entire hallway had burst out in laughter.
Lucifer looked at him and the silence stretched out between them. Sam felt as if his heart was slowly cracking in his chest. It was horrible, trying to keep himself together with all the strength he could muster while his entire body seemed to want to break down every second now.
Okay, maybe he wasn't really one to talk. But Gabriel also would never be one to go complain to his dad. "Fine," he grumbled and snapped his fingers again.
Misha huffed and then smiled fondly. "Well, it was kinda a whole out of the ordinary episode. I just remember all of us having a lot of fun with it."
Dean nodded, his thoughts now wandering through the memories of his mother. It was moments like these, all alone in a new House without anyone he knew, that he missed her the most. Not that he'd ever let it show.
They spent the drive back to the small house where Misha and Jensen lived in silence, and he even remained quiet as they went inside. It wasn't that he was trying to be rude or something but Dean really needed some time to think this through and figure out a solution. Besides, he didn't know Misha, not really, not like Jensen would. Hell, he didn't even know Jensen the slightest bit.
"I guess, yeah..." Sam answered hesitantly and drank from his beer again to give himself a bit more time to think.
"Pretty obvious, don't you think?" Sam answered. "Looks like Jensen Ackles is married. Or at least got a steady relationship."
The stranger let out a little laugh. "I do, but you're not exactly close. Just follow the signs pointing to Green Hall, it's that way," he said, pointing in the direction Dean had just come from.
Gabriel's eyes turned dark and when he spoke again there was a sadness in his voice that Dean didn't understand. "And I probably never really will. But at least my brothers will drag two people less into their eternal vendetta."
"Well, if Dean tells them about us, how do you think they're gonna respond to him and Michael being friends?" Lucifer snapped.
Dean thought to himself. Cas was so passionate about this stuff, you could tell by just the way he flipped the pages or hastily scrabbled something down.
Sam let out a little laugh. "Well, that shouldn't be a problem anymore, my supposed husband being the new director."
But Sam did. And he was getting hella pissed that that stupid Trickster was now taking it out on Dean. His brother didn't deserve the pile of shit he'd had to get through today, especially not because of some asshole like Michael. And this was only one day. The guy had ghosted Sam for a week, who was to say he wouldn't do the same to Dean? He'd only stopped because of Jessica... Lucifer had assured him the Trickster had nothing to do with that and Sam believed him - he had to, otherwise he'd lose his mind - but there was no way in hell he was gonna let it get that far again. This drama with the Trickster was coming to an end.
Sam shoved his shoulder. "Don't worry about it. Now that Dean knows, the rest shouldn't be a problem."
"I wonder why," Balthazar huffed sarcastically. Then he patted Crowley on the shoulder. "Cheer up, mate, what did you expect? Not everyone allows you to bait them into your debt."
"Seriously, how did you get to be Head Boy?" an American, mocking fourth voice suddenly chimed in. The three other boys turned their attention to a tall, blond guy. Gabriel thought he recognized him, down to the disapproving look on his face. "I mean, did your mom give it to you or something?"
Misha laughed and put his coat on one of the hooks before walking away towards the kitchen. "That's new. Normally that's my job. Jared, you wanna join us for dinner?"
They all turned towards the main entrance of their school, where a group of teenagers was making their way through the corridors. The group consisted of children between 14 and 18 years old, who showed no resemblance whatsoever but clung together like they were some kind of gang. But the strangest part was the fact that Sam knew none of them. At all.
Cas gripped his arm with one hand and used to the other to hold on to the partition so he wouldn't fall off himself. With a lot of effort, hitting his head and praying the container wouldn't fall off the wall, Dean managed to wriggle the upper half of his body over the partition. Lifting his foot from the container and risking his balance, he then tried to swing his left leg over again. It was a bit of a gamble but with Cas holding him steady, he got there. Now the only problem was that there was no place to put his foot down again.
"I know right?" Dean smiled. He was even more fond of his dad than Sam was. "He also asks if we wanna bring the girls for lunch on Saturday at the Roadhouse?"
They wandered through the hallways, accidents happening all around them, even more than before. Sam smiled.
He was just putting some books into his locker when he got Sam's agreement. He quickly let Lisa know about his plans. She would probably tell the others.
"Just saying. It might be me but this school is starting to feel like a war zone lately. Ever since the Shurleys got here... We've got enough trouble as it is, without you looking for more fights with Lucifer," she said.
He'd known his brother way too long to miss the way Dean's green eyes lit up. "Oh, we hung out," he casually answered but the corner of his mouth turned up. "It got late so I offered him to stay over."
Lisa shrugged. "It hasn't and I mean, I'm sure they're awesome and stuff, but they don't really seem to do the making friends thing very much, do they?"
Sam watched him go in utter confusion. Okay, so obviously that wasn't Gabriel but the actor playing him. But holy shit if the two of them didn't act exactly the same. It was freaking Sam out, really. Sure, he'd met Misha but that was different. Misha and Cas were different, very different. Cas was pretty quiet and kept to himself, Misha was as outgoing as could be. Cas didn't understand sexual puns, Misha loved sexual puns. Cas was awkward with social conventions and personal space because he didn't understand those either, Misha just deliberately ignored them. Even their voices were different. But Gabriel and... whoever his actor was... just the way they both talked and acted alone... they could've been the same person.
"And I'm not going to!" Dean replied before heading back to the kitchen. He grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat down at the kitchen table. God knows he'd deserved it.
"Yeah alright," Dean eventually gave in and followed Misha outside to their car. It was a nice car, a black Audi, but it wasn't
His boyfriend bit his bottom lip, as if still being in doubt, so he added, "No matter what, I'll always believe you. And I'll always be on your side."
Dean was a junior, while Sam was still a sophomore. "Six? Ish? I don't know, I've only met Balthazar. How many have you counted?"
What did he know about Lucifer Shurley? He was the second oldest one of the Shurleys. His father, Chuck Shurley, kicked him out of his house and nobody in his family wanted anything to do with him anymore. In general nobody seemed to like him, except for Dean's brother of course... Crowley had even asked him to get Michael to keep him under control, because he was threatening his "business".
Now that he thought of it, Dean'd had enough of that. He wasn't just gonna follow orders from some kid like Gabriel without knowing what he was stepping into. If Gabriel wanted his support, he was gonna have to tell Dean what that big secret weapon of his was, and otherwise the guy could go screw himself.
Cas looked at him and even with the only light in the room coming from the TV, his eyes seemed a little brighter. Then he turned them downwards, as if he was considering the offer attentively. Eventually he simply told Dean, "Okay."
"Yes, how did that happen?" Michael wondered. "Since the two of you are in different years and all."
As soon as the door closed, Richard put a step closer to Sam and squinted his eyes. "Is something wrong?"
The day went by that way. During every break he went back to his corner, just sitting there on the floor, waiting for his next class to arrive.
The remaining hours at school passed by like that, one hour fading into the next, until he eventually found himself waiting by Charlie's car. She'd driven them to school that morning. She and Dean joined him a couple minutes later and the three of them got in.
Michael let out a sigh and ran a hand through his hair. "It's just..." He spread his arms in desperation. "Why does he always have to ruin everything?"
"Okay, stop," Sam interrupted and took the computer from him. This way it was gonna take ages before they actually got to researching. "What else should we know about?"
"Well, I didn't mean to disturb you but I couldn't help but find your ignorance amusing," the boy answered in a posh accent. Or maybe that was just because he'd just more directly insulted them than anyone Sam ever met.
Dean gave him a curious look, wondering what his friend possibly could have meant by that. He doubted he'd find out.
Lucifer slammed the door to his apartment open without breaking the contact between their bodies for just as much as a second. They stumbled inside, lips connected and hands roaming each other's bodies.
Dean didn't respond. Instead he rushed past Crowley, towards the door and the man who seemed to be guarding it. He was planning on just going in, but the guy blocked his entrance with a stern face.
A frown appeared on Cas's forehead. "You mentioned Gabriel had something to do with that this morning. Why would you think that?"
Sam blushed like crazy at the idea alone and decided to put the thought out of his mind. Lucifer and his comments were gonna kill him one day.
Castiel sighed and looked annoyed. "Dean, you are the one who wanted to meet up with me. So I suggest you tell me what you wanted to say."
"What a coincidence, I'm in fifth too," she laughed. "That's great, that way the four of us can keep each other company."
"Mike, you know I like you, right? I mean, you're an amazing friend and I want you to know I really appreciate everything you've done for me."
For a moment, Dean had no idea how to respond. He had barely processed what he'd just done, he might just as well have gone crazy, and now Cas was telling him that kissing him was nice. And strangely, Dean agreed.
Cas frowned, clearly missing the humor in his voice. "That isn't a lot of time. What did you want to talk about?"
Gabriel rolled his eyes and walked over to the fridge to fetch himself a soda. He held up a second one towards Castiel, who declined the offer.
"No, I didn't actually, I was busy worrying about you." This gained him a little smile, so he continued, "Why don't
Lisa went on a little further, but Sam didn't bother listening to her anymore. He was just staring at the Shurleys, wondering how so many children could possibly live together in the same house. He had trouble enough getting along with Dean alone. A boy next to the guy Lisa had called the oldest in particular drew his attention. He seemed quite bored, his golden eyes wandering through the crowd while his siblings kept on talking to each other quietly. When his gaze met Sam's he stopped for a moment and for a split second they stared into each other's eyes. Sam quickly looked away and directed his attention back to Jess and the gossip Lisa was still sharing with his friends. He didn't notice the guy watched him for a few more seconds before turning back to his brothers.
Sorry, I forgot how long it had been since I last updated! Thanks for sticking around and let me know what you think :)
Every fiber in Sam's body seemed to tremble with excitement and admittedly some nerves, too. From the way they were going at it, he didn't think it would end with just some making out and touching tonight. No, this time was going to be the one, and after the day they just had, Sam couldn't wait for it to happen. They tossed aside their bags and pulled of their jackets, not bothering where they landed. When Lucifer started leading him backwards to what Sam guessed was the bedroom, his heart leaped in his chest. Normally, he probably would've made use of the situation to take a look around in Lucifer's room but at the moment Sam was a bit busy with kissing his boyfriend and trying not to trip. Although that turned out to be all in vain when he stumbled into the bed and fell backwards, dragging Lucifer down with him. For a moment they were pulled apart and Sam had to laugh when Lucifer landed on top of him.
Dean had made his decision. Despite the surprising... feelings of attraction he had towards Michael, Dean wasn't ready for something like this. Yes, he liked Michael, the guy was nice, funny and definitely not unattractive. He'd helped Dean multiple times, got him like not many people did and they got along fine. But at the same time he just couldn't shake the feeling they didn't... click. Maybe it had something to do with him being used to dating girls, maybe it was something else entirely, fact was Dean just... couldn't.
"I know, I know," Sam was quick to add. "But that doesn't change the fact that..." God, this wasn't going as smooth as he'd hoped. He took a deep breath and decided to just tell the truth. "Listen, Dad and Bobby, they warned us about your family. I know you're strictly speaking not one of them," he hastily said before his boyfriend could interrupt him, "and maybe it'll work out fine. But if Dean starts telling them all the stuff he's heard from Michael? They won't like it, Lucifer."
Not that Dean really caught that, because his friend had just put an arm around his shoulders. And just maybe he was silently freaking out about it a little. But instead of doing something awkward he told himself to calm down, let it be and move on.
Honestly, Sam wasn't that passionate about music but Lucifer had told him it was his favorite shop in town and he had gotten curious. He glanced around a bit while Lucifer started flipping through some vinyls. A couple of electric guitars hung above the counter, next to some of the most famous record-jackets in history. Sam had to admit he didn't know enough about classic rock to recognize all of them but he knew a few.
"Sorry," Sam shrugged, back to not knowing what to say. "Didn't wanna... bother you or something..."
His brother successfully found the vase and even realized he should probably fill it with water first. Tap. Misha was standing right next to the tap. And Dean really didn't want to get that close to the man who had just kissed him on the cheek. He looked from the vase to the tap, to Misha, to his brother, and back to the vase. Yeah, he was so screwed.
"Are we going to drink alcohol?" Cas asked, his voice as neutral as always while he was looking down at the beer.
Dean still didn't quite know how to handle the whole situation. He couldn't even make out his own feelings, how was he supposed to know what to do about Michael's? Were they really having a moment at Friday? And did the fact that he'd possibly shared a moment with Michael say something about him being gay? Or bi, pan, whatever, anything that wasn't straight? And how did he feel about that?
"No, I didn't know," the Winchester protested. What the hell was he supposed to do with this? "Why?" Probably not the most rational question at the moment but his brain seemed to have problems functioning.
Lucifer answered and for a moment Sam was scared he was really annoyed, before he received a second one,
"Well, he told me the story," Dean said. "Then I insulted his dad, and he wasn't too happy about that."
The other man walked towards the couch and dropped down on it, putting his feet on the armrest. "Details, Cassie."
Don't get your hopes up too much, this one was already close to done and it will probably take me too long again for the next update... I am oh-so grateful for all of you sticking around <3
The younger Novak just rolled his eyes. Gabriel was in the last year of his Master in History at Kansas University. This dissertation was extremely important for his education but Gabriel had a habit of not caring about important things in general.
Sam checked his phone in case Dean had sent him a text but that wasn't the case either. He had to admit he was twenty minutes late, so maybe Dean had gone to find him. He'd had some questions for his professor but unfortunately he hadn't been the only one. Since he knew some of his classmates had buses to catch and conversations in signing language tended to take a bit longer, he had waited 'til the rest of them had finished. Dean knew that happened sometimes, so surely he would come back to the car as soon as he realized Sam wasn't in class anymore.
Still a bit shaky, the younger boy couldn't immediately get out a word. He couldn't help but smile though, and when he finally seemed to have retrieved his voice, he basically sighed, "I guess it does."
Dean slowly nodded. "Alright, here goes nothing I guess." And without thinking twice about it, he swung his other leg over and fell off.
Dean opened his mouth, then realized he still didn't know what to say and closed it again. Should he apologize? Make his intentions clear? What were his intentions anyway?
After pulling off his clothes carefully so the paint wouldn't get on even more parts, he turned on the tap and started to clean the pink layer off of his face. Not to mention, that crap had gotten in his hair too. He let out another sigh, muttered some very not so nice things and just decided to put his entire head in the sink. When he'd gotten most of it out, he turned back to his clothes. How the hell was he gonna get that stuff off? He could hardly walk around the school bare-chested. On second thought, maybe his flannel hadn't suffered from the paint attack so bad after all, so he decided to start with that. Forcefully scrubbing the rim of the grey fabric while trying not to soak his entire shirt, he wondered who could've possibly done this. Normally, Sam was the only one who'd play a joke on him like this but they hadn't had one of their pranking battles in ages. Plus, if it were him, his brother would've been first in line to laugh at him and declare the war opened.
They looked at him expectantly. When he didn't know what to say and just stood there in confusion, Jo asked, "Isn't he a Shurley?"
Dean was so sick of this. He hated this place, he hated these people and he hated Jensen freaking Ackles.
They didn't need to say anything. They both knew who lived in the street the fire seemed to be situated in. So instead Dean took a turn in that same direction.
Sam laughed and shoved him playfully before opening his locker. As he did so, he saw Lucifer move and a second later he felt a presence right behind him. With an annoyed sigh he turned around and slightly looked up at the Shurley, who was a lot closer than he had anticipated. "What are you doing?"
"You think I wanna take that risk?" Bobby joked, causing both of the boys to grin. "Nah, I'll leave you boys to it. See ya tomorrow."
Sam shrugged. "I don't know, okay? Fact is Dean still doesn't like you. And I don't know what to do about it."
They spent the rest of that weird evening mostly in quietude and let Misha do the talking. Or in other words, the man would ramble on about subjects they didn't understand a thing about and they would nod and make agreeing sounds as if they did. Luckily, Jensen Ackles's husband turned out to be quite the good cook, so the Winchesters had an excuse to focus their attention on the food.
"Sure, no problem," she assured him, just before her eyes turned to his side. "Oh hey, there's Michael."
Sam put on some other clothes, while Dean was downstairs, telling their dad some story he'd come up with about them having a movie night at Charlie's place. Sam knew Dad wouldn't question it, he had enough on his plate already.
As expected, Lucifer was waiting for him next to his locker. He gave Sam a girly wave while the younger boy approached him. "Hi, Sam."
Again Cas looked at him for a moment but remained silent, and within a couple more minutes Dean turned into a little side road. He hadn't come back here for a while but the place seemed just as empty as usual.
They were actually just having an argument about it that morning when Sam had walked in and told the both of them, to their surprise, that he wanted to go to school. Dean tried to reason with him but he wouldn't give in and their father didn't try to stop him. So he went to school.
Sam entered the building with the built sets and immediately noticed they were completely different from last time. He could actually look into a pretty big one and...
With every second they neared their destination Sam could feel his heart beating a little bit faster, his breath becoming a little bit heavier, his thoughts jumping back and forth but always coming back to the same one: it couldn't be her...
Sam sighed, "Lucifer... You know I'd love to tell them but..." He bit his bottom lip. There wasn't really a way to tell Lucifer his family wouldn't like him without hurting his feelings. Just thinking about it caused a knot in his stomach to tighten. "They're not exactly a fan of your family," he decided to say.
"Alright." Misha got up and started piling the plates. "Baby, could you start on the dishes? I got a GISH announcement to post and then I'll join you."
He let out a sarcastic laugh. "The tricks he played on me? Well, he pulled a similar one on Sam those first few weeks, although maybe not that bad. It was funny at first but the guy just doesn't know when to stop, I guess."
"Yeah, you're right, thanks," Dean quickly said. Now that he had what he wanted, there was no reason to waste anymore time.
When Dean woke up the next morning, the first thing he saw was Cas. His friend was curled up underneath Sam's sheets, eyes closed and his hair tousled and laying over his forehead. It was... kinda sweet. Dean tore his eyes away from the other boy. Then he looked back. Maybe he should go ahead and make breakfast. He didn't really feel like getting up though. And he also didn't know what Cas would like for breakfast but everyone loved bacon, right?
Dean turned with a huge smile on his face. Charlie was practically running towards them, Jo a couple of steps behind her. They all exchanged greetings before they sat down.
Was it him or did that really sound like Lucifer had some very specific plans in mind? Before he knew it, Sam was slightly blushing again but he managed to shake it off. "So you're saying we skip school."
That sentence finally seemed to flip Dean's switch though. "So what?! I am your brother! When something as big as this happens, I deserve to know!"
His friends came rushing to his side, the worry on their face slowly changing into a suppressed grin.
"Why?" Sam huffed. "I knew you wouldn't like it, I knew you would try to talk me out of it and I knew all of it would just result in another big fight and I am tired of fighting, Dean! I'm done with you and Michael conspiring against Lucifer while you don't even know the whole story!"
Why on earth would Gabriel want to know how this worked out? Unless he was closer to Cas than Sam had suspected.
Right before Dean opened the door, he shot Sam one final questioning look. Sam smiled, and gave a small nod. The sooner he'd get this over with, the better.
Dean looked down at the bouquet he'd forgotten he was holding. "Right. Vase." He looked around the kitchen. Where the hell was he supposed to find a vase?
The other boy rolled his eyes and Gabriel decided to step in before things would get out of hand again. "So which one is she?"
He tried calling Sam again. After leaving the umpteenth voicemail he tried Lucifer's number another time. Charlie had pulled it up for him, but Lucifer didn't answer either. Dean wondered if the guy could sense it was him calling.
A few seconds of silence, then Castiel let out an exasperated sigh. "That would be great, Dean, thank you."
Richard smiled up at him. In the heat of the moment, his cap had gotten slightly pushed back on his head. "Well, whatever it is that has gotten into you, if this is your way of apologizing, it can stay."
Sam shrugged and looked down in an attempt to hide the blush that was slowly covering his cheeks. It wasn't that he was embarrassed at how close they were standing but the rush that came with it. Everything with Lucifer was a rush.
"Hey Bobby, it's Dean. I was just calling in to say I won't be home for a while and Sam's out too, in case you were planning on stepping by."
When Gabriel didn't respond, Castiel poked him in the ribs. Nothing. He tried again. Then two more times...
He was immediately bombarded with exclamations of surprise and questions of all kinds. "Calm down, does the whole school need to know?" he interrupted them loudly. Then he told them everything that happened Friday night. He didn't skip a detail, he explained all of it, from Sam's disappearance and his trip to The Cage with Lucifer to Michael's help, Crowley's sort of help and even the other Shurley kid's interference. Some of his friends had already heard the main parts but never the whole story. When he was finished, Dean was met with looks of confusion, surprise and horror. While he went quiet, the others started asking questions again.
"Right," Dean agreed. He'd already forgotten about their original plans. He grabbed his homework for Calculus and started on some of the exercises.
Castiel smiled at him. "It's not his fault, Dean. In our family it's impossible to have such a close relationship with all of your siblings."
Sam really hated the Trickster. But maybe... Well, it wouldn't hurt, right? If anything, it could only make this day more perfect. He had told Lucifer he loved him, surely it was his turn to hear those words? Maybe Lucifer hadn't been ready before but after the day they had? Now that they were about to have sex? It only seemed reasonable that he had to be.
No matter how tempted Sam was to ask about how he slept, he knew they had more important things to worry about and changed the subject. "You wanna get ready? Misha's gone for a run but he told me our driver Clif called to say he will be picking us up in fifteen. He would've told you, but he said you were still asleep."
The pensive squint returned as Cas thought about an answer. Eventually he said, "School, I think. Getting good grades is important."
"Lovely doing business with you, Dean," Crowley said, pocketing the money with a smile on his face. Then he turned towards the entrance. The guard opened the door immediately and let him in before quickly closing it again.
"Yeah," Sam shrugged. "Been a while since I've really hung out with my friends. I thought it could be nice."
"I don't know," he told Lucifer. "Dean could get home any second and if he finds out I'm not there..."
I'm praying to Luci, Chuck and Crowley that this chapter works out. I did a little POV experiment and well... Let's just say that if something isn't perfectly clear, that means I'm leaving it open for interpretation xD
"You didn't imagine that," Lisa said, still looking at the end of the hallway where Sam had disappeared.
Sam and Dean were running for their lives, being chased by a couple of very angry hellhounds. If they could just make it to the car, they'd be alright. Just to the car, that was it.
"I don't know," Cas admitted. Dean noticed he looked a little lost. He knew the feeling all too well himself.
"I don't know, I just thought maybe we could go have some fun. You can bring Lisa and the others too if you want."
"Come on," he whispered while snatching one of the paper pellets that Lucifer had been throwing at anyone who came within reach from his hand. "Let's go."
"Yeah, you too, man. Anyways..." He turned back to Sam. "So I was wondering if you maybe wanted to come over after school, maybe game a little?"
Still with a slightly pensive look, Cas elaborated, "I value our friendship too and you are right. Michael shouldn't decide who my friends are. So, he doesn't need to know but I'd like to be your friend."
Cas was still frowning. Then he said, "I have never drunk alcohol before," and Dean thought Cas had a better chance getting them into a car crash than the beer would.
Michael had been playing with his food absentmindedly up until now. "So Gryffindors and Slytherins aren't really supposed to hang out?" he asked carefully and added to himself,
Gabriel made a face while Lucifer burst out laughing at that. "I like him," he told Gabriel, pointing towards Balthazar.
Dean snickered. "Told you." Then he let out a satisfied breath. "My dad used to take me here once in a while when I was a kid. Sometimes I like to come back when things get messy, you know?"
"Seventh. But Mick here is in sixth too." He patted the shoulder of the dark-haired boy on his other side, who looked up in surprise.
Sam barely realized he'd said the words out loud, it was like they just escaped his lips without anything he could do about it. It only hit him when Lucifer froze in place and Sam saw the look in his eyes. Those bright blue orbs were big with joy, shock and a gazillion other things Sam couldn't place.
Lucifer had come to a stop too, with a horribly amused look on his face, and was then joined by two girls, Ruby and Meg. Sam knew Ruby because she'd tried to get together with him a couple years before, and when he'd finally felt the same way, she dropped it. He was sensing a pattern there. Meg had actually flirted with him a bit too but that had never led anywhere. What either of them was doing with Lucifer he had no idea about though.
That was probably the thing that bothered him the most about his disability. How was he supposed to find his soulmate, already one in a seven billion, if he couldn't even talk to a small fifth of the population?
No matter how much Dean would like to freak out, he decided it might be better to stay calm for once. He was in the back of an unknown car, what was he gonna do? Jump out? So he took a deep breath and went for the driver instead. "Excuse me? Where are we exactly?"
Dean had reached the next hallway by the time it really sunk in what had just happened. Cas was officially his boyfriend, and while he couldn't be happier about it, holy crap. What was even weirder was that now that he knew Cas definitely felt the same way about him and they agreed to be together, none of this suddenly seemed like such a big deal anymore, especially not worth all of the internal crises. It was like he could suddenly breathe again and think like a rational person. Sure, he still didn't know how to define his sexuality or anything, but as long as he had Cas, there was no need for him to find out anyway, and everyone else could go to hell if thought about it differently. He knew Sammy would be happy for him being with someone again. His dad too, even if he would be surprised and maybe a bit skeptical about Cas at first. Charlie was going to be over the moon, and the rest of his friends would be fine with it as well. The only real problem was that Michael would probably kill him once he found out Dean was dating his brother. Then again, he was already on the Shurleys' bad side; it could hardly get much worse than it was right now.
Dean just shrugged, seemingly not impressed. "Let's go." He shut off the engine and got out, the rest of them following him to the front door.
Oh. Lisa. Dean felt horrible about it but he'd almost forgotten they were technically on a break. "Uhm... no."
After they were done eating Michael got out a football and they all got up and began messing around, kicking or throwing it at each other randomly, no rules. At a certain point Dean was running around with the ball in his arms when Michael tackled him. They fell to the ground, laughing so hard it hurt, and it was only after a couple of seconds that Michael got off of him and offered him a hand, which Dean gratefully took.
The older boy stamped into the room and shot Dean an angry glare before moving to pass him by, but he wasn't planning on letting that happen.
"Because I knew you would get angry!" Sam called out desperately. Despite his brother's current calm demeanor, they both knew it was true. Sam thought Dean had no right to play the victim here.
"Good." As much as he liked Cas, the guy wasn't the easiest one to have small talk with. He was just about to ask another question when he heard Bobby calling him. "Hey, I gotta go, but I'll see you at school, alright?"
Sam rolled his eyes. Lucifer had been trying to convince him to ditch class again for ten minutes now.
Jess, who had been waiting for him in the hallway, quickly came up to him. For a second she was worried about him but when she noticed he was fine, she started laughing before helping him up. Sam couldn't blame her. He teased her about it a bit, pretending to be angry, but soon he had to give in and laugh along with her.
At the exact moment their hands both touched the bowl, he mumbled two simple words and snapped his other hand's fingers. And then Crowley was suddenly naked.
All of the other students, however, including his brothers, were looking at the adults in anticipating silence.
"Are you okay?" Sam asked, worry clear in his voice. A couple of kids in the hallway had chuckled a little at the event but most didn't dare really laugh at them. Lucifer could be quite an intimidating person if he wanted to.
"But your dad obviously isn't! If he even cared the smallest bit about any of you, he wouldn't have left all of his children completely alone!" Dean could hardly believe he actually had to spell it out for him. Why couldn't Michael see how bad a parent Chuck had been?
Ellen soon brought them their food and they dove in. Cas was especially digging his burger. (Actually, his exact words were, "These make me very happy.") And at the end of their meal, Dean had to admit he did end up finishing Cas's pie too. They got the check and said their goodbyes to Ellen before they left for the Winchesters' place. Since Cas didn't know that much about pop culture, Dean got to choose the movie and he went with
Adam walked up to the front and the Hat had barely touched his head before it shouted, "HUFFLEPUFF!"
John nodded. "He sounds familiar to me too. I actually think you boys better stay away from his children. They're known to cause a lot of trouble."
Lucifer let out a dramatic sigh and took a sip from his butterbeer. "Unfortunately I'm just trying to make his life as uncomfortable as possible."
"He's coming home?" Sam asked surprised. "That's amazing, Dean!" It had been months since their dad had left for his latest job. He was a professional bounty hunter, so he was away from home a lot. It sucked, but Sam and Dean grew up in this life. They were used to it.
The students walked up the aisle until they were standing at the front, where their teachers came to stop.
"Yes, you are," Lucifer said without hesitating, making Sam blush just as quickly. Lucifer had that effect on him quite often.
"Fine," Michael grumbled. "I'm gonna go, I'll see you guys at lunch." And with that he turned around and started walking away.
He was relieved when the older boy smiled back at him. For a couple of seconds they remained silent, then Lucifer said, "So no Cage tonight?"
"No," he answered in a voice that didn't sound as his own. "You just didn't tell me the whole truth."
"For God's sake, Sam, where the hell have you been?" he yelled. "Have you got any idea how worried I was when you still weren't at home at 9pm? You don't think you could at least let me know where you were or what you were going to do after school? And why the fuck do you look like you just came out of a fucking swimming pool?"
He laughed but there was little humor in it. He hoped she was right because Dean didn't think he'd be able to give it a rest anytime soon. She made a good point though, it did feel like a war zone. The thing was, Dean honestly felt about ready to kick some ass.
Crowley turned a very dark shade of red. "First of all, you bastard, who do you think you are? And secondly, not that it's any of your business but I became Head Boy long before my mother, who I'm not exactly close to by the way, got installed as a teacher here."
The brothers exchanged a look before Sam turned his eyes to the smaller man. "Uhm yeah, sure," he said, feeling a lot more insecure than he hoped he was letting on.
They headed off to the cafeteria together and after grabbing some of the crappy food there, they picked out a table for the two of them. When Sam looked around, he saw his brother and his friends at their usual spot and to his surprise Michael wasn't with them. Maybe next time he and Lucifer could join them. He really wanted to introduce his boyfriend to his friends properly...
"Stop it!" Sam interrupted him. He opened his mouth to say something else but it took him a couple of attempts before he got the words out. "This isn't about your brothers! This is about us, so why can't you answer the damn question?"
Sam motioned for him to remain quiet. Not only was there a stranger in the front seat, something about the highway they were taking seemed awfully familiar. Of course they'd seen plenty of roads with their way of living, but this one was different...
"Fine," Sam said, putting up his hands defensively. He stayed silent for a couple of seconds, then started, "So uhm... if you're not angry anymore..."
After maybe five minutes he spotted the boy he'd been waiting for, and as soon as Dean saw him, he couldn't help but smile. To his delight, Cas was smiling just as broad.
When he didn't get a reply, he started patting his pockets, just before he realized he'd put his phone in his backpack this morning. The same backpack that he had left sitting next to his clothes, outside of the stall.
"But he brought up the idea, didn't he?" Gabriel muttered and Sam couldn't find the strength to answer him.
He was just about to introduce himself to Michael's brothers when someone behind him shouted, "What's up, bitches?"
When she spoke again, he could hear a smile in her voice and knew the game was over. "Don't flatter yourself."
"Actually, yes," Sam replied. "This whole new family moved to Lawrence a couple of days ago and some of the kids are in our school."
Dean realized. He had to say it now or he didn't think he ever would. "Well, that really would make me kind of a hypocrite."
Dean took a deep breath and took a moment to lose himself in those deep blue eyes. He had never seen eyes as blue as Cas's before.
Michael pulled up an eyebrow at him. "I know your way of "trying", Gabriel, so could you please for a change really put in some effort?"
Sam decided it might be a good idea to get some of the pressure off of his little brother. "Well, Dean, let's just say not all of us flirt as easily as you do with every living being you encounter."
Before he'd even properly processed what Gabriel had said, the archangel started talking again. "Oh hey, is Jensen in his trailer yet? At least I'm assuming you two love birds got here together," he said and even winked with it. And then he walked right on by. "Go get him for me, would ya? We're starting in half an hour!"
Kevin shrugged. "We just had class together but I haven't spoken to him. As soon as the bell rang, he rushed off."
"Maybe..." he wondered aloud. But it didn't make any sense. Why now, it had been weeks since he and Michael fought. And he didn't even know who this Trickster was. He'd never been able to figure out which one of the Shurley kids had been playing his brother.
"Will do," Dean answered and he even managed to force a little smile. Then his little brother and him got out of the car and waited for Bobby to disappear out of sight, taking the Impala with him.
"I don't know," he admitted. "It was just... it didn't feel right, you know? I'm way too new to this and... I don't know."
Kevin laughed a little. "A club? I don't know, Sam... I mean, I'd like to come with you, but you know stuff like that isn't really my thing."
"Yeah no... just uhm... went down the wrong way," Sam waved it off. He was really gonna have to find out who Rich was. Preferably sooner than later.
The guy looked satisfactorily taken aback by that and quietly passed him the bowl of strawberries. Unfortunately, that wasn't gonna do for Gabriel.
"No problem," she smiled excitedly. "Welcome to the team." Then she turned back to the Shurleys. "Now, who's next?"
When Cas noticed him smiling however, he took it the wrong way and shut up immediately. He looked down hastily and muttered, "Sorry, you probably think it's ridiculous."
He knew he'd been an ass to Castiel and definitely deserved the guy's sharp comment. But now that same comment kept rankling and Dean was out of options of how to handle it. Surely he'd messed up all his chances of getting any more help from Castiel. Jesus, the Shurley boy had really tried his best for him and in return he'd acted like a whining bitch.
When Sam got out of the Impala, he took a deep breath and determinedly walked towards the school. He had been planning what he was going to say the entire morning and by now he basically knew the words by heart. He was confident he would need them too.
Dean got out of the Impala and walked towards the school's entrance. The boy with the dark hair and the trenchcoat was already standing there, waiting for him.
Lucifer's icy blue eyes turned to him at once and a corner of his mouth slightly lifted at the sight of Sam's now very big smile. "Well, don't you look happy," he commented amusedly.
Dean looked at him. Then before he could help himself, his eyes dropped to Cas's lips for a moment. He hadn't considered how closely they were sitting until now. Without even realizing what he was doing, Dean leaned forward a little. Cas didn't react, didn't even so much as flinch. He just kept his eyes on Dean as if he were the only thing he could see.
As Dean finished his drink and got up, Sam added with a pensive frown, "I can't stop wondering who he is... We didn't meet anyone named Rich last time, right?"
Dean let out a curse and ran a hand through his short light brown hair. "Sammy, listen, it's not what you think..."
Since his friend would have to walk, Dean got there first of course but he didn't mind the waiting. He just went to sit on a bench, the same one as always, and looked at the few other people walking around. He'd come to grow fond of this place. It gave him some room to think.
"Thanks, you too," Sam politely replied, realizing just in time he didn't even remember the guy's name. Guess they'd have to find out about that later.
doesn't know about what happened between you and Michael? That's why you didn't do anything about it, you didn't have a clue about what was going on!"
"There's nothing wrong w-" Sam started but then stopped himself. "First of all, that's not Gabriel and second, I'm not Jared!"
The other boy turned to him and again Dean was taken aback by those eyes, like blue fire. "And I want to be your friend but I can't just betray my family for you!"
Michael looked just as shocked, if not more, and turned a bright shade of red before glaring at Dean a last time and walking away again.
"Okay then," Dean said, trying not to show too much of his disappointment. Cas probably had his reasons, even if Dean didn't know what they were. "Whenever you like."
Dean took a deep breath, before starting to talk. "I really didn't see him as anything more than a friend at first. That I'm sure of. I mean, I have Lisa, she is the most beautiful and sweetest girl I've ever met and I love her." He let out a mocking laugh. "Or at least I think I do. There's nothing I'm completely sure of anymore. Anyway, we became close friends real quick. He tried to help me out with Sam and honestly I think I needed him myself too. Jess was gone, I was starting to lose Sam and don't get me wrong, Charlie, Lisa, Benny, Jo, Kevin, they're amazing friends and I love them to death, but I guess I just needed to get out for a moment. Out of my old life. Michael helped me with that. And then you told me he was into me."
"Crap," Dean mumbled. He should have known that. On the other hand, he was pretty sure that wasn't the building where Sam had his first class.
He spent the rest of the day basically waiting till it was over. And apparently he wasn't being very subtle about it either.
After school Dean returned to his locker to wait for Lisa. They'd had different classes in the afternoon, so he hadn't seen her since lunch. He didn't really mind. Every time he saw her, it made him worry about what he was going to say even more.
He looked at his friend. "But Cas, if you ever need something, anything, that they wouldn't do for you, just know that I'll be right here, okay?"
fearless, as one of you pointed out. She does get scared, she was even nervous about the Sorting Ceremony, although she proclaims not to care about what House she would get into. Perfectly normal of course, especially since she was first to go, but still something to keep in mind. She knows how to manage on her own, she's had to in the past as the child of at least one Muggle."
They walked to the cafeteria together, where Kevin, Charlie, Jo and Benny were already sitting their regular table. Sam couldn't help but look around for a moment, only to find Lucifer at a table with Ruby, Meg and that jerk Azazel. He still didn't understand how that had suddenly happened. Not that it mattered anymore.
"No, seriously, you've basically been living with this guy for years now, how is it you still haven't made a move or something?"
Dean nodded with a fond smile on his face that had Sam wondering how much time he'd spent with Castiel.
"Yeah, about that," Sam commented. "When were you gonna tell me you've been talking to him about me?"
"That's what I'm here for, isn't it?" Crowley commented before turning around and starting to walk in the direction he'd just pointed at.
Lucifer didn't give him the time to think about it any further, dragging him towards the library's entrance. "Let's go read some books!"
Cas didn't move and Dean was too busy trying to understand what exactly was going on to talk, so for a couple of seconds they were just staring at each other in silence.
Either way both boys finished their meals and spend the evening without realizing their secrets were a lot more similar than they would have anticipated.
The rest of the day passed by in a blur. Sam told himself he didn't believe two words that had come out of Gabriel's mouth. He wouldn't. But the thought was there and as hard as he tried to just erase the entire memory, it kept nagging at him.
He couldn't help but laugh at the scenario and the blind one turned to him immediately. He was met by two of the most beautiful eyes he'd ever seen. The sunlight reflected in them perfectly, like sunshine going through a glass of whiskey.
"Did he..." he started, then realized he didn't know what he wanted to ask. There was so much about the Shurleys he didn't understand. Except for the fact that he'd been on the wrong side all along. He shook his head and mumbled, "I've been so stupid."
He shrugged automatically. "Because she was fucking perfect? Nice, smart, beautiful... God, I loved her, Cas. I never expected to say this but I even thought she could be the one."
"Rock me momma like a wagon wheel, rock me momma any way you feel, heeeeey momma rock me! Rock me momma like the wind and the rain, rock me momma like a southbound train, heeeeey momma rock me!" Lucifer and Sam screamed at the top of their lungs.
Lucifer shrugged. "That's just my family, I guess. They only think about themselves, never about the people around them. They don't care who they hurt as long as they can have their way."
"Yes," Cas simply said and Dean was happy to hear the determination in his voice. "Go stand on the toilet seat."
Sam looked at his brother in panic. He had no idea who this "Rich" was. Dean returned the gesture just as desperately and shrugged.
And so they danced. After a while Sam got them drinks, a beer for Jessica and a water for himself, not just because he wasn't that into alcohol, but also just in case Dean took it a little too far and Sam had to drive them home.
He didn't get any further because Lucifer was already dragging him into The Cage. And he wasn't getting out of there for a long time.
"I'm guessing T is for Trickster," Dean commented. "Don't know why the asshole didn't just sign with his name."
After ten minutes, Dean still hadn't spotted his brother, or Lucifer for that matter, anywhere in the cafeteria. He knew it was stupid, there were a thousand good reasons why they could be a little late, and yet he couldn't shake the feeling that it was too much of a coincidence. And even if he was wrong... it couldn't hurt to take a little look, right?
Sam followed him toward the front door and when Lucifer let him in, he allowed his eyes to scan every corner of the building. "How did you get a place like this?" This apartment, the car... it was all pretty fancy for an eighteen-year-old.
When Castiel let out a sigh, Dean had the feeling he was starting to get on the guy's nerves. "We are a family, Dean. We're supposed to stick together."
Dean's face fell immediately. "Hey, no talking like that, alright?" he said, his finger pointing at Sam accusingly. "We're Winchesters..."
"Really?" his brother asked in shock. "Holy shit, I thought this were my jeans. I'll go change!" And then he ran back up the stairs.
He gave her a loving smile as a reply. He didn't know what he'd do without her. Probably crash and burn. "Thanks, Jess."
As Dean opened the door, he was immediately attacked by a loud pop and a wet substance splashing all over him. He jumped back in shock and automatically brought a hand up to touch his face. It was covered with a rather thick fluid and when he pulled back his hand... it was pink.
"Oh really?" Sam snapped at him. "So you're not gonna try and convince me that Lucifer's evil and a bad influence and using me to get back at Michael?"
Sky blue eyes turned towards his. "I'm doing well, Dean, thank you for asking." Then they gazed ahead again. "What about you, after Tuesday?"
He greeted his friends and they talked for a while before eventually Jo asked, "Hey, where's Lisa? I haven't seen her all morning."
When the signing stopped, there was a clasp of hands to his left and a soft, almost careful voice saying, "Hi."
"It isn't," Dean sighed. "He doesn't like it any more than I do but for God's sake, it's ridiculous that he has to to begin with. What kind of brother does that? Me and Michael had one fight,
"You just saw it happen with your own eyes, what more proof do you need?" the guy answered and looked at them patiently, as if he was actually expecting them to come up with another challenge.
And that's when it hit Sam. He patted his pockets, looking for his wallet, and when he'd found it, he took out his driver's license. Exactly what he'd expected.
"I was angry at Lucifer. For his behavior towards Dad but also because... You see, we'd had a fight a couple of days before that, the day before Adam and Eve arrived. Not about Dad or anything, just a stupid fight between friends. Except that... it wasn't. It was different... worse, and at a certain point Lucifer said some things... things that... hurt me. He'd hurt me so much." Dean could've sworn he saw a flash of pain shoot through the older boy's eyes. "Then he pretended nothing had happened and I was just so... incredibly pissed at him! In that moment I hated him, I wanted revenge, so when Dad asked me to show him the door, I... I did."
He suppressed a sigh and realized he'd probably have to fix this by himself. He looked the tile over again and let his finger slide over the letters. It was only when he touched the lower semi-circle of the ampersand that he noticed. It was loose. Sam pulled his fingers away in surprise and a frown formed on his face when he took a step closer to it to investigate it further. He carefully touched the circle-like part again and discovered the slight edge that separated it from the rest of the tile. It moved a bit without issue, so Sam tried to pull it. It came out perfectly smoothly, and sure enough it turned out to serve as the bow of a key.
Cas still seemed pretty uncertain but he did stand up from the bench, and Dean couldn't help but be amused at the calculating look his friend was throwing him. He shook his head a little and started walking back to the car with a smile. Cas followed and went to walk beside him. He remained quiet while they drove but it was a nice kind of silence, it wasn't uncomfortable. He never really felt uncomfortable with Cas.
"Come one," Sam said while grabbing his hand and dragging him away. "Like you said, we've got classes to catch. We'll deal with the Trickster later." He offered Lucifer a reassuring smile, which was quickly reciprocated.
Lucifer nodded, a little bit of surprise on his face, like he hadn't expected that himself. "Yes, I guess so. That's what it used to be like at least. Michael and me, we were like role models to the rest of them. Not very good ones, but they still looked up to us." He let out a mocking laugh. "And look at us now."
"Don't we all sometimes?" he said and looked at Michael. Their gazes locked and Dean was startled by the Shurley's eyes.
Sam was glad it was too dark in the club for Lucifer to see the blush that appeared on his cheeks. "What, can't a guy be happy anymore?"
Sam smacked him against the arm and Kevin certainly didn't look amused either. All the while Adam was trying to hide a smile behind his hand.
Cas watched him stutter with a worried look on his face. Then when it became clear nothing useful was going to leave Dean's mouth, the younger boy put a step forward and laid a hand on his shoulder. It was strange but somehow that comforted him a little right away.
. And Samandriel was looking just as surprised. Castiel turned his gaze to the direction the napkin had come from and saw a smiling brunette diagonally across from him. She was a local, already wearing the colors of their House, which the Ilvermorny students would only get later tonight.
Sam gave his brother an incredulous glare, but was ignored completely. So he decided to give his brother a taste of his own medicine. "Yes, it is," he said in a confident voice and shrugged. "We became friends after Dean made his older brother Michael his new bestie."
Eventually he managed to do what he was told but still he couldn't stop crying his heart out. The pain in his chest was beyond everything he'd ever experienced. The truth was like a needle slowly piercing itself through his heart, no matter how hard he tried to fight it and deny what was right in front of him.
For a couple of seconds a heavy silence hung in the air. Dean was clearly trying to contain himself, fists clenching and unclenching, his jaw set. Sam was simply waiting for him to burst and get it over with. Castiel just looked from one brother to the other.
Luckily Misha nodded understandingly and threw a portion of the vegetables in a pot. "Yeah, I can imagine. With everything going on..."
"Hey guys!" Michael joined them cheerfully. Dean could barely suppress a sigh and noticed too late Charlie was eyeing his reaction attentively.
Once he noticed Mick watching him, the English boy dared to ask, "Excuse me? I don't want to intrude but weren't you one of the Shurleys?"
