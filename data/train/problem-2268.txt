John grabbed Sherlock’s face again. “I’ll be there the whole time, I promise. I’m not letting you out of my sight. Not ever again,” he said, as he pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s. They both smiled, enjoying the new closeness they were allowed.
“Of course, anything you need,” he replied more formally, before flicking his eyes to Greg, who turned away to look at the bookshelves suddenly with great interest.
They leaned in and kissed each other again. A kiss that was so filled with aching hearts and sadness they could taste it. The bittersweet kiss of finding someone to love, only to have it ripped from you. This would have to be enough. For now.
. He had always been blind when it came to John. Moriarty had known that. How very fitting that his blind spot was his undoing. He thought that doing all of this to save him would have been all worthwhile. But he had miscalculated it to a monumental proportion. He always knew the risk of going away to destroy Moriarty from the ground up, to keep everyone safe. It had always been a possibility that he himself would not survive. But a risk he and his brother had agreed was worthwhile and important to take, for the sake of the others. He had never considered that taking that risk would have a completely other side effect. He did not factor it into his calculations at all. He and Mycroft had both missed it. With no real life experience, it had not occurred to either of them. A fact his brother was now painfully unable to accept. The constant checking in was irritating.
“Stop that, it’ll be fine,” Sherlock says stubbornly. He lines the nail up and swings the hammer out wide.
John wondered if he was truly just referring to the pillows.  “Want me to help lie you back down?” John offered.
he thought to himself. He had hoped that giving Sherlock some cases would be good for him, that the challenge would motivate him to heal faster from his injuries and get out of Baker Street and about London. Sherlock loved London. John had relinquished a modicum of control and allowed him out to start investigating a minor case, or so Greg had been led to believe. It seemed that John had done no such thing and now Sherlock was in all kinds of trouble, and John was not coping well. Greg would deal with John’s wrath in the coming days he was sure, but at the moment John was still reeling. As were they all.
Silence descended upon the house as the mysterious man lay unconscious at the bottom of the stairs, John sat, leaningagainst the hallway opposite, and Sherlock tried to stem the bleeding of his leg in the front room. In that moment, the shriekingsirens, getting increasingly closer, was the sweetest sound John thought he’d ever heard.
John was settled into his old chair, to read a book. He had been up to unpack his things in his room, as if he’d only been away on a vacation. Initially, he had found himself sitting on the bed and resisting the urge to cry or scream for the first few minutes, breathing heavily to calm down and stop the swell of emotions. He was an expert at that. But now, after settling himself in the lounge and for the first time in almost two years, he felt surprisingly at peace. All this time, he had been trying so hard to wrestle with emotions and deal with what had happened, and he had really started to believe he would never be able to let it all go. He had thought leaving Baker Street was the best thing to help him move on. But now, sitting here like this, it felt so right; he finally felt like he was home. This was where he belonged. Sherlock was alive, the network had been dismantled. Soon, Sherlock would be exonerated, and they would be able to go out in public.
John put his head in his hands, expecting that’s where it might end up. Greg stood suddenly, looking past John, so he turned his focus back to the interview room, to see Mycroft and another well-dressed man – presumably the lawyer – entering the room, led by a young officer who appeared to be shaking in his shoes. Mycroft had clearly put the fear of god into him. John turned back to Greg to gauge his reaction.
He was offended at being shushed, but the dramatic overreaction was lost on John, who refused to look in his direction.
“Here.” Mycroft walked back around his desk and grabbed them – they had been close-to-hand already. “You know I have to say, I’m actually relieved that you know.”
But he spun around and grabbed Sherlock’s shirt front, to pull him closer and kissed him again. This time it was less awkward, and they both sighed as that feeling sparked in them, the knowledge that there was chemistry between them, that years of wanting to do this had come to fruition and it felt so very right.
“Guys I have to go grab some stuff from my locker – I’ll see you tomorrow alright?” John said, wanting to get away from the conversation altogether and not have to lie any further.
“Don’t remember, right?” John checked. “Someone’s been playing you. Someone who had access to either the production or the delivery of your medication. It’s been tampered with. For a few weeks now. You haven’t been taking what you should have been. And they’ve been priming you to fall off the wagon, to lose control.”
Sherlock muttered some more incomprehensible things, words that didn’t make sense, some of the words sounded foreign, possibly even Serbian. He was delirious.
“Spend a whole week with you, pretending everything is fine and normal, and falling for you... only to say goodbye.” He put his head in his hands.
room. Something in his memory was not settling on this idea though. He did not feel any relief that he was here. He felt a sudden movement and glanced down to find a person – a man in fact – snuggled against his chest, the warmth between them suddenly coming into focus. From the smell and the sight of his hair, Sherlock knew immediately it was John. His mind went into overdrive.
,” John swore with bile, walking slowly closer, his voice lower and more fierce, between gritted teeth now. “A club you’ve had ready access to, that you would have
Sherlock walks down the hallway and finds John, sitting on the edge of the bathtub, deep in thought.
John’s confusion was still surging through him, his brain and his body still catching up with what had happened, his eyes still searching Sherlock’s for answers. The shock made him numb to any pain. The eyes that didn’t look right.
Greg leaned over to look closer at it and noted one side of the blade had teeth or ribbing and the other side had decorative cut-outs or holes along the knife which would explain the unusual shape to the wounds. The handle was, once again, silver and with a Celtic design.
A loud bump made John spin around, gun and torch pointed in front of him with confidence, only to find nothing but Sherlock.
“John Watson, I believe that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me,” Mycroft said, raising his eyebrows. John laughed into his glass and they both sipped silently for a moment. “Stress will do that,” Mycroft finally added. John nodded and made a hum in agreement.
He straightened his shoulders and gave her a nod. Looking down the narrow street, he could see there was a chemist on the corner, and a hair salon, as well as a couple of restaurants and takeaway joints in the other direction. He looked behind him, to the lamp post opposite the café, and sure enough, there was the CCTV camera, taking in the street.
But at the same time, John was completely overwhelmed. Not only was his mind elsewhere, he also hated being the centre of attention. He had planned to spend some time with Sarah but right now he needed air and an escape. The room was suddenly very stuffy and he could feel his blood pressure rising, the stress of the situation suddenly building in him and he needed a release. He needed to get outside. Making his apologies to the boys, he snuck back out the front door - the fastest exit point - awkwardly wrestling his crutches over the little lip at the doorway.
“They’re just stills – print outs from the security footage – not great quality, but they show enough. Told you it didn’t look good,” Greg explained, as John handed them across.
. He rolled his eyes at his own stupidity. It was better than being at home, alone, and sober. It kept him distracted from the fact that he had gone another Friday without collecting from James, and he was edgy. Somehow when he was around John, that didn’t bother him. He had a new interesting distraction to focus his mind on. So now here he was rugged up in a big coat and planning to sit. With people. Watching football.
find him,” Mycroft reassured him, walking to the side of the room and pouring them both a nip of scotch. He handed John one glass and took a sip from the other one, resting his weight against the front of the desk, observing John. John was too thin, too pale and unshaved. He had definitely not been doing well.
, he reminded himself. He couldn’t bear it if John asked to leave. He had seen the look on John’s face at the lab. John was not going to be able to deal with this case. He could see Rosie in this little girl too. No, it was better if he dealt with this one alone, as he had planned from the beginning. Curse Molly for bringing John into it.
“As usual Anderson, always missing the point,” the teacher said with an eyeroll, “not what I asked…uh Watson what about you? Perhaps the new student can give us some insights?” The class turned to place their eyes firmly on him. He felt sweat instantly on his brow and the colour drained from his face.
A doctor was standing in the corridor with them, in scrubs, his surgical cap in his hand, hanging by his side.
“Okay,” Greg nodded in reply, looking at his feet with a slight blush at the compliment, at the respect being given to him by this man, regardless of their relationship outside work.
“Yes, you did.” John smiles back at him. It feels like a perfect moment. It’s the first time in a long time, that John really thinks being around other people might not be such a terrible thing. “Shall we go again?” he asks.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry I know I’ve been distracted,” he said rubbing his hand over his face before looking at Sherlock deciding how to tackle this.
“Sorry I just. This is great thanks,” John said awkwardly. Sherlock looked at John, really looked, while they were still sitting so close and rested his hand on the front of John’s chest where the scarf ended for a moment.
Sherlock knows that Mycroft is worried, with good reason. Sherlock has never done relationships. Neither of them have. His career has been their entire single focus for years. This is a new problem they are both going to have to face.
“Shall I hand you a towel as well?” Mycroft continues the onslaught, well aware that he’s winning this battle of wits.
Suddenly he heard familiar voices, speaking: Sherlock’s voice sounded a bit slurred; Mary was sounding concerned. He pressed the phone harder to his ear to try and hear it over the noises in the street.
“You don’t have to say anything, John. I love you. My brother is happy because I’m more settled now since I’ve found you. He can see that now. He’s giving us his blessing. The house is ours. There’s nothing else to say. Except to say yes, of course.”
“Greg will be round to get me soon and I’ll be heading out for the day,” John said as he breezed back towards the bedroom to get ready. “Mrs Hudson will be up to watch you shortly, and then your brother is coming over later,” he added loudly back down the corridor in warning.
Throwing on his pyjamas and his dressing gown, he strolled out to the lounge room and stopped short.
John dusts off his hands on his trousers, and heads straight up the hill, a little buzz beginning in the pit of his stomach – partly excited that he might see Sherlock, but partly worried something is wrong. He can see people walking in and out of the big truck, busying themselves with moving things back and forth. Mrs Hudson had just told him recently of a poor fellow a few towns over who had their whole house robbed in one hit, while they were out for the day, a truck driving up and just taking everything. No one questioned it because they assumed the neighbours were moving. It was a testament to how people these days didn’t want to get to know their neighbours. He feels nervous and suddenly regrets not having his gun handy, just in case. Sherlock’s house is filled with lovely things. It would be an easy target out here in a secluded area.
“Yes, well, that’s all very well until the next star comes along,” he says flippantly, as he grabs the hammer and the nail from amongst the grass and repositions himself, waiting for John to help again. “It’s fleeting John, I promise you. The fame, and being a touring musician, isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.”
“Sherlock, you aren’t allowed out on this case, we talked about that,” John said, with a huff of disbelief.
ok!!” John yelled, his voice cracking and exposing the hurt more than the anger. Sherlock moved towards him and carefully opted to sit on the floor beside him, placing his hand on top of John’s hand, which was gripping the box so tightly. He was like a wild animal, likely to bolt at any second. Sherlock’s heart was breaking. He knew this feeling. He understood all too well the desire to make pain go away. The battle with that little box. He had lived this too many times before.
“Excuse me?” Sherlock asked, trying to prop himself up on his elbows but surrendering back down on the pillow in frustration and pain.
There is an unexpected knock on the door of 221B, stirring Sherlock from his daydreaming. He has been wasting hours, trying desperately to write new music and struggling, failing, which dissolves into daydreams of John instead: imagining the curves of their bodies tangled together. Even the memory of John’s body warmth is stored carefully away in his mind palace, so Sherlock can recall it at a moment’s notice. Leaving Germany, the last time, had been particularly difficult. Now that they have crossed over into new unchartered territory, into a relationship, Sherlock has no idea how to make it work, but for the time being his mind will have to fill the void with happy memories.
And with that Sherlock was able to relax. No one had ever got this close before. He was a little nervous about Mycroft, but John had already stood his ground there. So he hoped it might be okay.
Lestrade looked at him for what was too much of an extended time, checking. Eventually when Sherlock gave no sense of planning to speak further, he handed over the files in frustration. Sherlock was a closed book, much more than usual.
Sherlock was standing very still behind Lestrade. His chin raised slightly in… was it defiance? Or superiority? John couldn’t tell. Sherlock did always get this way when confronting criminals, but this was worse than usual. It was always unnerving when he got like that. But after the last few days, John was genuinely unsure how this would play out. Lestrade had gone against protocol and let them both be in the room during questioning. He hoped to god Lestrade didn’t regret it. John shuffled nervously on his feet, arms crossed, waiting.
There were three on the wall, and two sets of empty nails that were now empty, where knives used to hang. John grabbed at his phone in his pocket, hoping to get a photograph of the knives as proof. This could indeed be the home of someone involved in this. It could be the owner of the murder weapon. He reached towards the lamp, to switch it on, just for a moment, just long enough to take a clear picture of them, when he heard a gunshot, and his heart stopped.
He had taken a place at the Academy, hoping to learn some policing skills, hoping to take his medical and military skills and do something different. Being a GP was far too tedious, but the only medical work he could realistically take on as an invalid. No one wanted a limping doctor in Emergency, and he couldn’t bear the ennui, the sheer monotony of a private practice. He needed excitement, he needed something to get the blood pumping through his veins again.
better qualified,” Mycroft answered smugly. The accompanying smirk broadened as John made a perfectly timed entrance into Sherlock’s room, to punctuate his point. John took in the mess of machines and cables still attached to Sherlock. He was still too thin, too pale, too bruised. But definitely alert.
“John,” Mike sighed, shaking his head. “I don’t know about you, but I think it’s pretty great, actually. I’d be
It is unfair, he thinks, how the only problem is the distance. That everything would be solved if they could just cut out parts of France and Belgium from the map and push London and Allgovia closer together. It’s a stupid notion, and John keeps it to himself.
John could tell he was wanting to walk over and look too, but he clearly had no energy to move. “Have you been… eating this week?” John asked, feeling guilty that he didn’t really know the answer himself.
“Right. So are we knocking on the door, or breaking in?” Sherlock asked quietly, his voice sounding far too excited by the prospect.
Mary positioned the tea in front of them, before returning to the chair with her book, trying to stay out of the way. Mycroft wondered what she thought of all this. He was certainly impressed by her professionalism and being as invisible as possible during their discussions.
. They each had a certain skill-set and background which made them attractive to us. None of them were on the books anymore, you understand.”
“Brain injury?” Mycroft tried, enjoying having someone medical it the room to quiz in John’s absence. “Should we be getting him scanned?”
“No records, no trace of any identity. They had no identification on them, and their prints are coming up with an unusual error code in the system that I’ve never seen before.”
Sherlock was quiet, sulky even. His hand was entwined with John’s, rubbing his thumb against John’s hand in a hypnotic rhythm but staring out the window, not talking.
“Just…I don’t know, this is a nicer end to my day than how it was looking an hour ago,” Sherlock admitted. John smiled at him and they stood there quietly for a moment, the awkwardness lingering. Neither of them knew what to say.
“Oh right,” he nodded, wincing again at the movement of his head. The silence between them was uncomfortable. His dad was never good at making conversation with him.
“Watched a bit of Doctor Who in my time, yeah,” John said with a sly smile. “Can’t say I really understand it entirely, but I get the gist.”
“Sherlock? Sherlock!” John stopped on the spot and listened for just a moment before he dropped the takeaway without thinking and ran straight back to Baker Street.
“Sherlock…” John tried to interrupt again. He had no idea what he wanted to say to Sherlock, it had caught him completely off guard. His heart had started hammering in his chest. He felt completely unprepared. He doubted Sherlock would really hear anything he said in the state he was in. And he didn’t seem to be able to stop talking long enough for John to say anything anyway.
. But she quietly stepped away, giving them space, swallowing her awkward smile between her pursed lips.
John sits there with his eyes closed, just taking in Sherlock’s plan, a light smile on his face. It’s a lovely fantasy, one he never dared picture until now.
The fireplace was going, in an attempt to help warm the flat against the evening chill, so that Sherlock could rest properly. John took a sip of scotch from his glass on the side table and returned to reading his book. Even from the lounge, he could hear the machines and Sherlock’s still laboured breathing. He tried to shut the sounds out and fall into the pages of his book, to escape the worry he couldn’t shift. His eyes struggled to read the words on his page and he realised they were filled with tears, distorting his vision. He was going to have to try harder if he was to get through this.
We last left you in 2011 with Sherlock and John reuniting (and not much explanation of why yet... you’ll have to stay tuned for that - pun intended) and now we go back to 2010 before they have met. Thanks for following our story
“Fantastic!” John had said enthusiastically, breathlessly, without thinking. He was sure his eyes had blown wide in surprise. It was the first time someone had laid his history bare like that, as if it was being surgically explored, and admittedly it was the first time he hadn’t felt incredibly uncomfortable about it.
Sherlock didn’t reply straight away but his face expressed a need to say something. He opened and closed his mouth as his brain ticked over and John stared, waiting for him to speak.
John returns to himself and squares his shoulders. This is a beautiful looking cabin in a quiet part of the forest. Just standing here, with his phone in his hand, listening to the birds chirping, is enough to remind him why he had agreed to this in the first place.
John shook his hand and looked him square in the eyes with a full military-level threat, to establish that he was ready for anything. Greg would have to watch him closely. John had warned that he was pitching for a battle earlier.
He has no more tears to give after last night, but his heart is aching, trying to pump blood through his body while simultaneously clenching in pain. He knows how these things go. His family had moved a fair bit when he was growing up. People never did stay in touch as they promised to. Last night may very well have been the last he would ever see of Sherlock Holmes, and for the first time he realizes how much he really felt for him.
“John,” Sherlock suddenly turned to John and put his hand on John’s leg getting his full attention, “I don’t want you anywhere
As he focussed back in on the microscope, at the flecks of dirt off the girl's shoe, John came storming in to the lab. Sherlock didn’t even look up from the microscope. He couldn’t bring himself to look at John but he recognised the sound of his angry footsteps anywhere.
“Well maybe he’s right,” John said, annoyed at the conversation, starting to walk out, unable to keep fighting. He was so angry at Sherlock for going out on a case when he wasn’t supposed to, and for leaving him, to have to try and solve this case alone. He suddenly felt guilty, stopping himself at the door. The silence between them was thick in the air.
“It’s my pleasure. I mean, he helps me with my cases, but he’s also my friend. I count him as a friend,” Greg said gently, nodding.
you. So… ball’s in your court. When you’re ready.” She smiled at him and then returned her eyes to the road. And that was that.
“I know it…” Greg began, feeling stupid yelling up the bar at him. Realising the sulking alcoholics were all watching, he grabbed his pint and walked closer before getting on the stool next to him. Mycroft followed him with mistrusting eyes, appearing to be almost insulted that Greg had dared. “I know it looks bad,” he went on. “But I just couldn’t watch him like that. He’s not himself, and I don’t even know where to start.”
“Stabbed,” Anderson offered bluntly. John found himself craving Sherlock’s retorts reserved only for Anderson for always stating the obvious. John was too polite and worried to point it out, though.
“Yes?” John sat forward, a little straighter, with interest, putting his food down on the table to listen properly.
“Tour is over. I have some days off before I’m needed in London. Thought I might come here, enjoy the snow.”
“I’ll be in touch–” John said, looking back at the man with a polite smile, as he rushed out, colliding with something in front of him.
“If he’ll let me. He’s pretty wired. Hasn’t said much yet. I thought he might be better with you in the room.”
Sherlock had blushed, taken a big gulp to hide his embarrassment. “Not quite. A Wildpinkler, according to this article, is a wild pee-er, someone peeing outside.”
“John's probably just gone for a walk and he’ll be back soon. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about, Molly.” Sherlock tried to sound confident.
“I can come here more often. We can try and email, I would even try doing phone calls. I’m sure Mycroft can help with a better internet connection, too. And when you are ready, you could come back to London. We could find a flat, you could accompany me on tour,” Sherlock mumbles against his neck.
Rosie on the slab. Rosie is at home, safely in bed. There is no earthly reason to transfer our feelings onto this poor soul. I’m a
“Okay great, thanks,” John nodded, hoping his dad would be okay with all of that. He wasn’t going to tell Mike that.
“Well Donovan tried to get the extra footage from the bar but apparently the owner was being a little bit unhelpful.”
Sherlock carefully edged his arm off John’s shoulder and stood up to put as much distance between them as possible before John realised the situation, so he wouldn’t feel uncomfortable – and besides, he needed to move his legs and buttocks around and get rid of the pins and needles.
“It’s walking distance from bloody Barts, Greg,” John said under his breath in disgust. “It’s probably not even his first visit here.” His voice prickled with distrust and Greg was trying to think as fast as possible of ways to keep John calm.
“What is it Molly?” He was getting impatient with her. She always thought it was funny that someone as difficult as Sherlock could have ended up best friends with someone who actually had
The class started to jeer and react. John turned bright red and leapt up in his place, grabbing at his crutches.
. I just don’t think I can hear it. You’re going to tell me to reconsider the letter, and that you’re sorry Mary died and how it wasn’t your fault and you had every intention of…”
Sherlock thought to himself. Well of course he knew why, didn’t he? John Watson had captured his bloody heart. The more time he spent with him, the more he couldn’t stay away. And now here he was.
“No.” Sherlock was genuinely surprised that he and Molly had that in common. “Not at all. In fact, I completely agree.” He gave her a half smile, in appreciation for their shared understanding. For a moment he took Molly in. Her pony tail dripping down her back, which was so neatly created and yet, she always had fly-away hairs around her face.
He makes a slight detour to get to the house that is only about a hundred metres from his own – John’s house, if he deduced it right. The garden is empty, and Sherlock doesn’t notice any movement from inside, so he places the can on the doorstep. He might be a rude arsehole, but not cruel enough to deprive a Brit of his beans on toast. Not looking back, Sherlock makes his way down the hill and to the lake.
Sherlock is used to waking up in unfamiliar places – touring the world means he has stayed in hotel rooms more often in the past years than he has in his London flat. It hasn’t often happened that he wakes to the sound of bird song, though.
John smiled at him, “You know, it’s not her fault you have a ridiculous name that’s impossible for her to say.”
“Well that went well,” he heard Mycroft say sardonically to his stubborn brother, as he passed through the doorway.
The next couple of weeks away touring, without being able to go to John and explain, are going to be torture, and Sherlock has a very bad feeling that John has already made up his mind to have nothing more to do with him. He only hopes it isn’t too late.
“No. I feel I should, though, John. The thing is…James and I…we…that is to say, we used to…and then…”
He replaces his own outdoor coat with the suit jacket. It slides on smoothly and makes John sigh from the ease of it. It’s a little big on his shorter frame, the arm seam hanging past his wrist and the bottom sits lower on his frame than it should, rendering his good-arse jeans pointless, but he nods in thanks politely. The manager, in turn, nods at Gilda and gives John another once over before handing him the ticket and walking away without another word.
John turned to look towards Sherlock’s room, but as much as he wanted to rush in, couldn’t get his feet to travel the two metres to the doorway. Suddenly it felt like too much to bridge that gap.
“Sure,” Sherlock said, casually, although his heart still beat fast whenever he spoke to the footballers. Amazing how intimidating they could seem. Even Mike.
“Yeah I gathered that already from his dazzling personality,” John interrupted with sass, shifting uncomfortably on his feet, still not making eye contact with the patient.
“That looks ridiculous, John. Like some sort of a death frisbee.” He would say anything to make John laugh and it works.
John, and this was probably far from how John really remembered their first meeting, he knew he could have used his time – trapped in this dungeon with imaginary John – better. And now it felt suddenly so much more important to say things, but he had so much less strength to get the words out.
“Yes. I have,” Mycroft retorted, hands on hips defensively. “You’ve been talking… constantly, I might add.”
Greg had left with Sherlock in one of the police cars and John was thankful no media had taken interest in the commotion outside the hotel in this quieter, less exciting part of town. That was the last thing they needed – Sherlock being walked out in handcuffs caught on camera. It was newsworthy at the best of times and there were many people who enjoyed seeing the likes of Sherlock put in his place – including many at the Yard. John knew they would normally enjoy tipping off the media, but something about this case had quietened even Anderson and Donovan. Something about the scene and the state Sherlock had been in had spooked them all, and John had been relieved, if not a little scared, to realise that everyone had taken the scene very seriously this time. Not a hint of an uttered joke or dig at Sherlock’s expense. They gave Sherlock the wide berth he so clearly needed and deferred to John and Greg’s judgement on everything as they quietly investigated the evidence. It had been so completely out of the ordinary that John had struggled to pin down why he had felt unsettled. Aside from the pathetic plea to John, Sherlock had barely spoken a word and had been led out of the building quietly and gently by Greg. John had briefly argued with him about the necessity of the cuffs, but Sherlock hadn’t even fought them. He hadn’t spoken another word – no smart remarks, no sass. Just compliance – eerie, terrifying compliance.
The question lingered in the air as Greg came bursting through the door, making a dramatic example of how out of breath he was, throwing Mycroft a frustrated look for leaving him behind, before flopping onto the couch to catch his breath.
In the distance, the police sirens started to wail, heralding their arrival in the area. Without a word, the man lurched forward to grab John and without thinking, his training came to the fore and he fired the gun. The man was stopped in his tracks as he fell to the floor. The sirens grew closer and John breathed a loud sigh of relief, before leaping up to run into the sitting room.
It did feel a bit stalker-ish to have figured out John’s address and be standing here with a pile of school work.
Donovan stepped closer and flicked the switch for him, a little rougher than necessary, giving him a stern look. “Focus, Watson.”
“God, you must be bloody freezing. You’re completely starkers! Get out of there, come on. Let’s get you back in the room and dry you off. Jesus, Sherlock. What are you doing?” he said, in a panic as Sherlock shuffled towards him, into the blanket John held open for him. “This is getting a bit scary Sherlock,” he said as he hugged the blanket around Sherlock and rubbed it a bit in an attempt to warm him up. “You’ve got actual patches of memory missing, now, it seems.”
“Ugh, you really are… quite the pair – you and Sherlock,” John said, frustrated. “Stubborn to a fault and that bloody childish feud of yours!” John shouted in frustration, dismissing Mycroft by heading to the kitchen to prepare his tea, without offering one to his uninvited guest. He knew Mycroft would read it as an insult and John meant every bit of it. He could be just as petty as them, when he wanted.
Mycroft takes a moment to look at his little brother. He can’t remember seeing him look so happy. Not for many years. His eyes are bright, his face relaxed, some more skin on his bones. He had seen a hint of it when Sherlock had come back from his first hiatus. But there was a sadness there still, on his return, despite looking healthier. A sadness he hadn’t deciphered yet. The fresh air and sunlight had done wonders for him. His arms were more toned, he had clearly been eating better while he had been away. It had been reassuring. He had figured out for himself that John was the reason. Giving him the ticket was the very least he could do. But encouraging a
“It’s perfectly reasonable to venture out and explore one’s surroundings,” he says to the empty room, reassuring himself, as his inner child bounces up and down inside him like a puppy waiting to be taken out.
“I’m not telling John,” Greg said firmly, giving Mycroft a look as he sat on the end of the bed in defeat.
“Thanks Mycroft. See you this evening,” he offered in a rush as he followed Greg out, his legs unable to keep up with him as they left the building in a hurry. John had to jog to catch up to Greg before he was left behind.
“Oh, sorry. I just thought… I remember Sherlock was helping you the other day when you were cooking. I thought that maybe…”
“Right. Then, I won’t confuse you with the science. But time travel has always been known to be possible. Time is accepted to be flexible, in the science world. It can bend and warp with the right combinations of speed and gravity… and technology.”
“Right. By the timing, he came straight from there with the match-card in hand, to this location. He may have gone back to her hotel after. There’s still some time unaccounted for though. Depending on how long he was here.” Anderson looked to Greg proudly. He had done good work, and Greg was definitely impressed. John was clearly not. “Donovan is scouring the hotel camera footage back at the Yard to find out when he arrived there.”
“That’s right. You don’t want to think about the unpleasant things, do you? You just assumed I would get over it, right? But I didn’t. Not for a very long time,
“Anderson might have laughed at you, but he took a full week off work after his first jump, and hasn’t done field work since, so don’t take any nonsense from him.”
All Sherlock can manage in response, is to kiss him, and John, for another night, is allowed to forget. To just feel, to love.
“Exactly. Get out of here. Boys messaging my son! Coming to our door unannounced! He’s not interested in…
Lestrade smiled proudly that she had heard of him already. “Detective Inspector, yeah. That’s right,” he corrected, letting his pride show a little too much.
John knew Sherlock was never one to show weakness or admit defeat and he wondered if maybe Sherlock was just deflecting his fear and trying to rile John up for sport. It wasn’t the first time he’d done it. John was always an easy mark. He let out a long steadying breath.
“Right, well I’m off out to pick up our dinner,” he said, jingling his keys nervously between his fingers, as he stood awkwardly in the doorway. “Will you be ok?”
Sherlock just stood there. He had heard everything his brother said but he just couldn’t grasp what he was watching in front of him. He knew he was the one to always be messy, and unpredictable and a bit of a menace, not John, never John.
“If you stop the bombing, it negates the need for our existence, or the need to go there to stop the bombing. Therefore meaning you don’t need to go back, but then the bombing doesn’t get stopped, allowing it to actually happen. A paradox.”
“My brother didn’t want to let me come here, to rest. He wanted me in a clinic somewhere,” Sherlock admits. “But something made me think of this cottage.”
” Sherlock was talking more to himself now, than John. Muttering as he pushed the tips of his fingers into his eye sockets, shaking his head as he continued pacing.
This was far from the first time John had needed to check Sherlock over. There had been many post-case assessments but usually for more obvious and superficial cuts and bruises. John had managed to sew a couple of stitches on one occasion – something he wasn’t in a hurry to repeat. Sherlock was a far from exemplary patient. John tried to use his best bed-side manner – his soothing doctor voice, his gentle patience. All the things he wouldn’t normally be when Sherlock was being irritatingly stubborn.
to. I’m open to trying all sorts of things with you. Very much. I’m not stopping you because I don’t
Sherlock’s brow creased in confusion. Was this what they did normally? This seemed like such a normal, domesticated moment and yet… something in his chest hurt… something still felt… off. He smiled tentatively at John, uncertain.
“I’ll go and find them shortly. Just tell us what you remember, Sherlock.” She tried to get his attention, but his eyes continued to dart around the room and back to the mirror.
The loud sounds of Sherlock’s ringtone interrupts them, and they pause in place for a moment, deciding what to do.
John wanted to at least kiss him goodbye, but that wasn’t going to be a good idea with his dad watching over them. He was already preparing for the lecture on the way home. After what his dad had said at the game, about Sherlock. And now here they were together again. His heart rate picked up, the anxiety already climbing. “Okay. Thanks.” He flashed Sherlock a reassuring smile before heading to his dad’s car.
“Mmm-hmmm,” was all Sherlock said in response. John knew that meant he had heard but was deliberately not committing to anything.
“Right. That’s sorted.” John said as he walked back into the flat. “She can help tomorrow.” Sherlock felt a stab of guilt but said nothing.
John let his hands come out of the wild curls to cup Sherlock’s face. “You’re so gorgeous. I can’t believe I get to even do this,” he sighed.
“You sure you’re okay?” John asked, looking concerned. Sherlock’s heart gave a happy, heavy thud. How he had missed John’s looks of concern. Why had he missed them? Why was it strange that John was here? Like this?
“John, you’re already altering things, it’s dangerous, what we’re doing. Just by interacting with him, you’re risking things.”
“Here,” he said, pulling Sherlock’s scarf off his neck and squeezing it onto he wound. “Hold that firm,” he instructed, as he took his phone back. He hadn’t stopped to really take Sherlock in, needing to focus on triage first. Finally he took a moment to put his hand to Sherlock’s jaw and look at him, the concern finally in his eyes now that he had sorted the medical necessities.
He leaned forward, and scrolled back the footage, choosing to stand this time as he watched the explosion happen and the screen go blank from the dust and debris again. He rewound it one more time to take it all in. As he watched, he bent down to grab his chair and right it, all while keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the screen. Watching.
possibly remember? You admitted you were half out of your tree, talking to an imaginary friend in that dungeon!” he deflected, louder than he meant to.
“Shit,” he said to himself under his breath as he grabbed his shoes and shoved them on his feet without socks. He pulled roughly at the blanket that had fallen off the end of their bed, tugging it out of its tightly tucked housing, and ran out of his room without a second thought.
time travel?” he asked, feeling stupid just saying it aloud, as they reached the team, who were busily working.
Molly was working in the lab when Sherlock strolled quietly in. He hadn’t noticed her at all and was muttering quietly to himself. He gave a small chuckle to himself as if laughing at a joke and Molly looked around to check, surprised that he might not be alone.
Sherlock thought as he eavesdropped, packing his belongings slowly into his bag. He glanced up and once again, John Watson had looked over at him. He was feeling intensely self-conscious and roughly packed the rest of his things up in a hurry to get out of there before he had to make conversation or eye contact again.
“Yes I have. And I still think you need to come back to Baker Street. Live here, with me. Mrs Hudson would love to have Rosie about. I could leave you behind on the dangerous cases. Lestrade would love it if I let him tag along for a change, or Molly. John, what kind of a father would you be to Rosie if you are isolated and miserable? There is so much I could teach her. Oh please, John, just think about it." He let out in a flurry of excitement and pleading. "I know you’re scared. I know you’re hurting and you’re angry and all of those things. But look…you came back to Baker Street. Even when you asked me to never speak to you again, you came back here. Why did you come back here?”
“I needed to look at the files and make some calls first anyway, so I’ve been hiding in there and letting Donovan take the lead on this bit. I’m keeping a close eye though, mate. Don’t worry,” Greg tried to reassure him. “Just heading back from a loo break, but they only just went in.”
“I sincerely hope you’re joking… it was buried beneath his skin so how could it… I see… I see… yes, I understand that… fine.
“Oh. Yeah, I’m sure he is. Everything’s fine,” John said, not really wanting to commit to an answer, or discuss it with her.
And before he can even reach out to stop him, John has walked quickly past him, out of the flat, and out into the night.
“Sure. Maybe after lunch? When we’re set up, and I’m settled into things? This set up process may take a little while yet to get going,” he explains.
“Yes, there’s been a second body brought in. Well, a first body really, I suppose. It got here before your young lady did,” Molly said enthusiastically, grabbing for her notes. “Actually shouldn’t have even been brought here – came from Chelmsford. Must have had a clerical error. But here he is. Point blank shot to the head.”
“Understood.” Mycroft doesn’t even let him finish that thought. “Are you sure that’s what you want?”
John sighed heavily. “My dad has been posted somewhere new. I’m going to have to move on to a new school
“What are you even doing here…? And on Saturday? You don’t even like football!” John let out in a frustrated laugh. "And I mean, on Friday I thought maybe... there was something... but then..."
"Sherlock," John seems a bit amused by the mistreatment of his shirt and Sherlock makes sure to kiss that smirk away, arms wrapping around the back of his neck, bringing their bodies flush.
to. “I was young and inexperienced, and I fell under his spell a bit. And then he persuaded me to try the drugs, and I’m not good at moderating my behaviour…”
“Don’t…” John didn’t lift his head, his voice muffled but the intent clear in his voice. It was a strong warning.
“Hmmm,” Greg hummed. “Not many. Alcohol dependency perhaps, from what I can gather. He’s been seeing a therapist.”
John laughed and shook his head, passing his books to Sherlock, and grabbing his crutches from the locker beside him that they were leaning against. “Fine,” he accepted. “Sorry I was late this morning.”
“I’m sorry,” he offered to Mycroft. “I shouldn’t have come to dinner. It’s my fault he’s upset. I've... well I should go and...” he began to stand up already.
The two of them have worked together a long time, they know the routine. This tour has, thankfully, been a success and audiences have been forgiving of Sherlock’s absences and cancellations. If anything, they managed to sell
John stood watching the back of his head a moment longer, just long enough for Mrs Hudson to appear at the door.
He had spent twelve hours beside Sherlock on his bed, probably now looking a bit worse for wear himself. He hadn’t showered or shaved. He was not leaving Sherlock’s side until he knew Sherlock had come through this.
“Not today, I have a couple of other errands to run. I will pop by again in the next couple of days, though. Just grabbing a few essentials for now. The pantry was looking a bit bare last night,” he says with an embarrassed look.
Sherlock was perched on a tall stool, using the bench to support his weight and looking frailer by the minute. John sat beside him on another stool, sifting through a medical book from Molly’s shelves, while simultaneously googling on her laptop, and asking Sherlock an incessant string of questions about his symptoms. Sherlock was answering in annoyed monosyllables, without the energy to argue, and John’s eyes were flicking between the research and scanning Sherlock constantly for any change.
John had frozen to the spot, his eyes wide, looking to where Mycroft had been standing in the doorway. Being caught in a compromising position with the little brother of a man who had unending powers he still didn’t fully understand was more than a little bit disconcerting. He couldn’t pull himself away from staring blankly at the doorway to the bedroom, trying to decide if he was okay with all of this. His brain had officially gone offline.
of theories for you on mind palaces,” she added affectionately. She could never hide her admiration of Sherlock, even after finding out they were together. There was an awkward silence after she realised her error. “How is he anyway?” she asked nervously to regroup.
“Oh John.” Lestrade grabbed the other arm now too, to steady John in support. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Whatever this is, let’s just take this hour by hour. Okay?”
John waited for a breath – just long enough to close his eyes and picture Sherlock’s beaten body one more time. Then, he dropped his hand and ran into the cave, the team following close on his heel.
John then tried to surprise Mary, lurching for the gun on the coffee table instead. Not quickly enough though, with his head still pounding and fuzzy. Mary was ready, half standing to meet him as she pulled a knife from her pocket and stabbed John in the side.
“You could have emailed it through, or phoned you know?” Greg said, almost teasingly. “A three-hour car trip was a bit excessive.”
John’s legs can’t hold him any longer, and he flops back into his seat, his breathing heavier at the intensity of the emotions rushing through him. He suddenly feels hot and flustered, and he can’t stay in this space. He needs to leave, he should never have come. Before he can move, Sherlock comes back out to the side of the stage, without his violin, bowing again, as a lady walks onto stage to give him a large bouquet of flowers and the audience cries out more. Shouts of “encore” and “Zugabe!” flow around the auditorium amongst the applause. John genuinely thinks he’s going to pass out or vomit if he doesn’t leave. His heart is thrumming at a ridiculous rate. He grabs at his program, fanning himself, as sweat forms on his brow, and he stumbles out of his chair, just as Sherlock walks back off the stage. John doesn’t look back or wait another moment, he runs out of the theatre as fast as he can.
He looks more relaxed already, Sherlock notices. His shoulders are less tense, and he has been humming some of his stupid rock songs ever since they got off the plane and into the car. He’s taken off his jumper too, looking very attractive in his black t-shirt, jeans, and dark sunglasses.
“What? Wait… what the hell Sherlock? What are you doing with these?” John said, shocked as he pulled out a set of handcuffs from Sherlock’s jacket pocket. “What else have you got hidden in there?! Are these real?”
“Thank you,” John said, leaning in and kissing him on the nose sweetly, before following Greg out of the room.
“I had a headache for a good week afterwards that I couldn’t shift. But my brain works differently to most, so that’s not surprising. It’s nothing to feel embarrassed about, John.
“Only… I think he needs you. Sherlock. He’s… I think you should come to Bart’s.” Molly sounded incredibly guilty. “He’s here.”
Sherlock stood there shocked by his reaction. It had not occurred to him that John would be unable to process the sight of him, to be upset, or confused, or angry. He thought there would be relief, that seeing him would fix everything. Another miscalculation.
“Tehrok!” She screamed as she ran a little unsteadily towards him. Sherlock bent down with his arms open to accept her, Rosie throwing herself into his arms.
“You really are lazy. You could help, you know,” John grins, getting back an annoyed huff in response.
is the place for me though, Sherlock. I thought coming here would solve everything, that it would be easy, but it’s not.”
“Yes, well I’ll have a few weeks in London and then we’re planning the next long leg of a tour – a couple of months again. But this was just what I needed to take a breather,” Sherlock says, sipping his wine.
For now this was just a random body. How Sherlock happened to also be here could be completely unrelated.
Before Sherlock, he had never needed anyone, and now John is becoming irrationally angry at the idea that this man has caused him to feel so much. Without even looking at the clock or registering time, he leaps out of bed and throws on his thick dressing gown. Running down to the front door, he grabs his jacket and slides it on, slipping his boots over his feet to run out of the house and up the hill to give Sherlock a piece of his mind. The sun hasn’t graced the hill with its presence yet. But Sherlock was always awake at odd times and he hoped… as he stormed up the hill he tried to remember what time Sherlock had said he was leaving. Why hadn’t he checked a clock before heading out into the chilly mountain air? He wraps his coat tighter around himself as a gentle breeze invades the fabric, making him shiver. The condensation comes out thick and fast in front of him, as he puffs his way up the hill. The house seems quiet, the lights aren’t on inside. He pushes the gate open, more roughly than usual, taking his frustrations out on it. His unfastened laces trip him as he tries to get up the stairs, but he catches himself before face planting, stumbling towards the front door and banging at the wood fiercely.
“I wouldn’t be very good at my job if I didn’t already know everything about you, Doctor Watson,” he replied with a satisfied smirk.
get to raise his voice, but what he really wanted, was to scruff someone up – just a bit – to let out the frustration he was feeling.
John spins around to find an older gentleman, very well dressed, watching him. “Yes?” he asks, assuming he is in the way, or doing something wrong.
“How about I just go into the kitchen, out of the way, and fix us all some snacks?” she offered, putting her wine down and moving out of their way.
“You were unreachable Sherlock. I told you. It took me six months to find you with all my resources.”
“You’ve just been so irritable and so… I don’t know, absent with Rosie since this case. Everything changed this week. I thought…” John didn’t know whether to finish it. He was still a bit afraid that Sherlock may agree with him. “I thought you wanted us… to go. To move out. That I’d overstayed my welcome.”
When he makes it back to the safety of his dressing room, he places the rose gently on the counter after sniffing it once. The heady scent makes him think of the roses they had planted in John’s garden at the cottage. He sits down and reads the note over and over. His brain replays it a thousand times and it feels like an age has gone by. He doesn’t even notice his brother’s arrival. The smell of his cologne is the first signal that he is being watched from the doorway.
“Well… we don’t let it cloud our judgement, let’s put it that way. Disinterest is probably the wrong word,” Mycroft explained further.
” John encouraged more. Sherlock gave the bathroom one more glance and then followed John back towards the library.
“She’s been very helpful on the case, Sherlock. That’s all it is,” John explained, a little embarrassed.
“I don’t want you to change your career trajectory because of me,” John sounds irritated and Sherlock isn’t sure how to settle him. He thought this would be good news.
As he placed the phone back down, he could hear a commotion in the corridor outside his private room. The Diogenes Club had strict rules about noise and admitting people to the more private area where Mycroft enjoyed working through the night. He only knew one person, aside from his reckless brother, who was prone to making loud visits, unannounced and sure enough: when he looked up, it was just in time to see John Watson storming into the office. The club’s security was trailing behind, trying to grab at his arm.
“Molly, can I take these photos?” Greg asked, noticing them all on the bench. She had documented all the body markings and injuries from her autopsies on them.
about it all the time. God knows I’ve used it many times to convict killers. Love. But I haven’t ever experienced it for myself. Not really. I didn’t realise what it was. My logic centre of my brain had clearly gone offline and I didn’t notice. I did it to protect you. All of it. I’d do it again. I just didn’t factor in the… the human condition… how humans react to death. That you’d have moved on before I could say…”
Rosie had somehow arrived back at the blanket and interrupted them to grab Sherlock’s arm, surprising them both. “Tehroooooook!”
oblivious aren’t you?” John teased. “Everyone has been assuming we were a couple since the day we met – your brother included! I’ve clearly favoured
“No, I just mean. Um…” Sherlock began looking very unsure of himself, John pausing mid-way to standing to look at him. Sherlock took in a loud breath, “sure let’s walk to class together.” He smiled at John.
“No, it’s all been gathering data to this point. Experimenting with the tools. We don’t know yet what the effects of the technology are. We’re using it very sparingly. To gather data. Observe. We don’t—”
“Yes, that’s fine. Let’s get to it, though. We don’t want the family waiting longer than they have to, they deserve answers for her.”
“I was giving him some space. The last lot of questioning was… unpleasant to say the least. He was resting when I left him.”
The police lights flickered from their cars parked below, outside the hotel. It was too early in the morning for any sunlight to have risen yet, creating alternating patterns of blue light splashed across the plain walls of the room, oddly creating an ambiance that reminded John of a nightclub. Once again he had to stop himself from losing focus. This was anything but a nightclub. They were anywhere but at a party. This was anything but hilarious. And Sherlock was far from stable right now. John clenched his jaw and felt his toes curl in his shoes to grip against the soles, as if it might ground him. He tried with mammoth resolve to return his focus back to Lestrade.
“I should be getting back,” he decides to say instead.  “I need a full night’s sleep to be ready for tomorrow. And my manager will be ringing with feedback soon, I’m sure.”
“Well yes, I deleted it. I’ve got a doctor in the house. So… I just… deleted it,” he explained, as if it should be apparent.
“Wait no!” John yells and Sherlock drops the hammer in fright. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to… it’s just… you don’t want to swing that big. You’ll take a finger right off!”
John understood this feeling completely. For that brief moment in the morgue his heart sank. He knew Rosie was at home but for a brief moment he lost his grounding. He needed to go straight home and make sure she really was there and hug her tight. But he was a doctor. He was able to compartmentalize things in a way that perhaps Sherlock had never had to before. Of course, as Sherlock’s record went, losing important people in his life did hit him hard. John had never really thought about it much, and they hadn’t talked much about it together, either. He should have realised that it would hurt Sherlock much deeper than it had himself. He was ashamed that he hadn’t realised what his best friend had been going through.
“Yes, once he’s out, I’m just going to make him lie down and rest,” Mary said from John’s shoulder as she pushed her way in past him, a pillow in hand, trying to get to the cupboard.
there, but it has been interfered with, nonetheless. That’s why he’s been off the last couple of weeks. It’s got to be in the tablets. It’s the only thing he still takes regularly. I’ve bagged them up. I’ll need Molly to run them at the lab to confirm. Sherlock has none of the right markers in his system that he should have. His brain chemistry is being messed with… on purpose. I don’t know why or by whom.” John felt a sense of relief at being able to say it aloud finally, to someone he trusted.
On arriving home – the two of them completely overwrought – Mary had the wonderful idea to get Sherlock into a bath. It was something he hadn’t enjoyed in a while, not since returning to Baker Street, in fact. John continued tearing up the flat, his anxieties expressed through loud yelling and aggressive re-organising that wasn’t helping anyone relax. Sherlock knew it would take another month to get him to come back down from that ridiculous moral ledge again. It was upsetting after they had finally been starting to make progress. Despite the fact they should feel relieved, with the final piece of the puzzle found, Sherlock essentially off the hook, and the case nearly closed, neither of them were particularly relaxed. Sherlock would be lucky to see outside of 221B again any time soon, if his overprotective John had any say in the matter, and that in itself made him sulk.
“Mycroft, leave him alone,” Sherlock chastises as he returns, already dressed in some black jeans and a gorgeous green button-up shirt, sleeves folded to the elbow. He takes a moment to straighten up his curls, glancing in the mirror for a moment, before flashing John a reassuring smile.
“Oh, just a work breakfast,” John offered. “You know, bring the team somewhere local, coffee and muffins and the like.”
“No,” he said firmly in response. “I want you to stop because you’re coming off a high and you’ll regret this later. And John’s done nothing to deserve it.”
“No. John, no. It’s really not necessary,” he continued on his mission - still keeping his eyes busy.
Sherlock grabbed at the books and avoided eye contact, aware that others nearby were staring as well. The whole school knew about James and Sherlock and their history. He was sure this would be great fodder for the gossip.
“Hell yes, I do. But that isn’t it. Don’t you just want to make sense of this? All those people dying? Have you even
How could he have been so negligent? Obviously, Sherlock shouldn’t have slept for twelve hours straight unchecked. John put his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face. “Don’t bloody go leaving me
“Water?” he asks. “Or something stronger?” He knows he is a coward. He ran from the concert hall, from Munich, like a coward, and he is running now too, still clinging to the safe little bubble they have created for themselves on top of this mountain.
“What?” John asked, the tone of Sherlock’s voice catching his attention, forcing him to open his eyes.
“Oh yes, of course. Sorry,” Molly said with a characteristic eye roll at herself. “Honestly some days I think I’d forget my own head. Yes I um… a case came in. And it’s ummm… It doesn’t
Five minutes on, they have managed a few of the palings and Sherlock’s confidence grows. Once they are in a rhythm – John grabbing the wood, Sherlock finding a new nail and joining together on the task – they are able to start chatting away to one another. John tells Sherlock his favourite pieces from his evening viewing on YouTube, commenting on Sherlock’s playing and his outfits and asking questions about the performances. Sherlock tells John about the many cities he has visited while on tours, which orchestras are the best to work with.
“There’s plenty of spares in lost property or whatever. The coach can kit you out,” Mike offered, trying to sound completely relaxed, like kitting out the poor kid was an everyday occurrence, when John knew in reality that was unlikely to be the case. He didn’t want to be a charity case but he also wanted to find a way to fit in.
Sherlock worked his way slowly down the hall from his room on the crutches, grimacing as he dealt with the pain. He had been okay with weaning off the pain meds slowly when he was still lying prostrate on the bed, but as he was starting to move about, he was regretting pushing John on that decision. He knew it was all part of the process, and he was no stranger to pain, or detoxing, but it tended to make him grumpier than he meant to be. He didn’t want to upset John or make him regret committing to Baker Street or their newly altered relationship so early in the piece.
. Because this thing with us... who knows if it will last. You have to do it for yourself. Because you
“Oh cheers, just a latte, thanks. That’d be lovely,” he said vaguely as he took in the café, allowing his lapel camera to view different angles.
After settling Greg down, they agreed that John would head back with Sherlock in the morning, after they had all had some sleep first. Greg would finish the rest of the inquiries alone and bring anything back with him to Baker Street, to fill John in then. He had not been happy either, to see Sherlock – who they were trying so very hard to protect – wilfully ignoring their instructions. It took a good twenty minutes for Greg’s blood pressure to settle and for him to head to his own room.
Sherlock guides John to the edge of the bed, lips never straying far, until John sits on the edge of the mattress. For a moment, Sherlock looks down at him, into the oceans of his eyes, at the lines around his eyes that tell of war and loss and laughter and which make Sherlock only love him more. This man deserves the world and Sherlock can only attempt to give him a small part of it.
“No. He’s very dead. We took custody of the body. That much we know,” Mycroft could safely confirm that at least. He’d seen the body personally.
“Sherlock?” John asked, momentarily confused and unable to place what the sensation was. For a moment, he pondered how they were even allowed to stand here like this, unsupervised, touching one another. Surely that wasn’t allowed?
He was never one to be emotionally expressive, so it surprised John, pleasantly. He sat silently, processing that, and realised he needed to say something now, more than ever.
“I can tell I’m getting myself into worlds of trouble,” Greg teased with a smile, giving him a cheeky kiss on his collar bone, “engaging with a Holmes brother like this, and the enemy – at least in Sherlock’s eyes,” he chuckled.
At the front of the stands, a group of girls, led by Sarah, grinning broadly, were attempting to be the team’s cheer squad. They cheered loudly holding up hand painted signs and ribbons. John couldn’t help smiling at Sarah and her excitement. She was a lovely positive force. Mike was still trying to convince him to just ask her out and be done with it. Sarah was too polite to take charge, and John was too damaged to want to involve her. But she was pretty to look at and she seemed to think John was interesting enough to follow him around. Maybe he would take the opportunity at the party tonight to investigate that further.
Mike noticed and stepped up to the microphone to speak on behalf of the team. “Sorry we’re missing part of our team, actually. Sherlock, can you please come up here as well?” he said with captainly command. Sherlock sank down into his seat, embarrassed, as some of the students turned to look at him. Mycroft’s eyebrows raised, not expecting him to be given the acknowledgement.
that was true. That was why he was here. He looked back to the game, unable to keep looking at him if he was going to do this.
“Fine. But you’re there to observe. No interfering,” he gave Sherlock a stern look. Sherlock didn’t move or reply.
“He’ll be all right, love. I’ll make sure he eats and rests,” she reassured him, giving his arm a squeeze as she walked by him and into the kitchen.
They spend some time unpacking. They came straight here from New York, so there is laundry to do and the groceries they bought at Mrs. Hudson’s to store in the kitchen. They get it done without talking a lot, but the silence is far from uncomfortable. After so many hotel rooms, they have gotten used to just working around each other for a bit.
Mycroft was standing behind his desk, facing the cement wall. From his posture, John could tell he was tense, cradling his mouth in his hand; deep in thought, clearly not happy.
“Right, thank you sir,” she said. John hadn’t met her, but he knew there were two shifts for his team. He’d been working the afternoon shifts, to enable them to sneak around at night, so there were a few members in the meeting he’d never spoken to.
“… scare the life out of you. Something clearly already did that,” Mycroft commented casually, connecting the dots for John in a patronising lilt.
She replied with a forced smile of sympathy but said nothing. “Who’s the girl, Sherlock?” she finally asked.
The last three weeks had become a blur of violence and wrath. As body after body was added to the headcount, John felt – hoped – that Sherlock’s injuries were healing, that he was surviving. As if each body accounted for each of Sherlock’s injuries, John hoped each person he took out, equated to Sherlock inching closer to recovery. Mycroft had been right; he
John turns away, unable to watch. He can feel the days melting away into merely a few hours. How quickly would Sherlock’s manager be able to send a car and cut their wonderful time together short? He tries to busy himself: laundry, long overdue; checking up on the lettuce plants and watering them; putting away the dishes. Anything to try not to think, until Sherlock is back. He catches himself looking out of the window, but Sherlock is nowhere to be seen.
“Yes,” Mycroft continued, ignoring Sherlock’s threat. “Our parents travel so much for work these days. I’ve been appointed as his legal guardian in their absence and well, you know he has issues - of course you do. With James back on the scene, I was… concerned. Sherlock needs to be regularly assessed as part of the agreement with our parents. It was a condition of being allowed to have you for dinner, that he agree to see the psychologist this afternoon,” he finished.
“Brother, I know it’s…difficult. But he is dealing with a heavy loss. Remember he doesn’t know what you know. He’s grieving you. We discussed this. It’s what you wanted,” Mycroft said more gently than usual.
. So many things that had broken him over and over until he was lost to the world of friendship. He was never going to trust another person to care for him in friendship or anything else in this life. He and Mycroft had both learned that lesson the hard way at school and had made a pact to only trust in each other and their intellect. Mycroft had been so jealous when John had come along, before they had even shown a semblance of the friendship that it had become. Even then Mycroft envied the loyal, steadfast soldier and how he was able to stand up to all Mycroft’s jibes and insults. But those times were long gone and Sherlock had to accept that.
