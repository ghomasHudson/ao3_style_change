"It doesn't mean we can't act well."
Sherlock’s annoyance is palpable, temper ticking like a time bomb.
(See the end of the chapter for
"There are limits to that kind of narcissism."
“How young?” Sherlock enquires with a smirk John can see through the back of his head. He grits his teeth and breathes through his nose. “Mary’s age?” Sherlock prods again, almost as if he delights in John’s anguish.
Mary turns to John, concerned,. “You ok?” she asks, and caresses his face in attempt to console his bitter sentiments, “Yes I’m fine,” he whispers back.
Sherlock disinterestedly resumes his trek and catches a glimpse of his better half poised by the alcohol reserves. John is tolerantly bored and leaning languidly against the wall in his trim suit, hands relegated to his double besom pockets, front panels misaligned under the strain and falling asymmetrically over his waist, sloping off from the wall. The slightly disheveled state of his jacket suggests some level intoxication, however his overall appearance- from his posture to his steady gaze- betrays artful control and composure. So the tousled look is more likely a product of emotional disturbance, or of his newly-adopted philosophy of not giving a shit.
“Alright,” John relents with a sigh, turning his attention back to his flatmate with great reluctance, “What did happen, then, that was so bloody enthralling?”
John bolts up from his chair so that it legs screech along the floor, having decided that he can’t stand the insufferable hunger strike a moment longer.
7. DO YOU BREAK THE LAW OFTEN?
the monster again, but he’s not afraid. Neither is the monster. It sits in the water, the setting sun turning its scales red, letting him approach, betraying no emotion. And then John steps within it’s grasp.
“Are those tears supposed to be for Sherlock?” he says. That hits a raw nerve and earns him some biting words and a drop kick out of the building.
“Where is it?” she contemplates, pushing the fringe out of her face, “Maybe I have to ask Sherlock where I put it.”
He glances at the ceiling and spies a camera posing as an innocent fire sprinkler, for once grateful his brother is so paranoid he has even the lavatory under surveillance. Now was the time to use that convenient scientifically proven fact she was attracted to him to his advantage and manipulate her into slipping up. If he could get her to say something on record only the killer would know, it would be enough to put her behind bars.
"That is EXACTLY the problem."
“No. I’m a parent retrieving my daughter from school. Isn’t that routine?”
“Mary?” he turns his head and asks through the door.
That should be his line. He was half expecting
It’s a beautiful day. The central courtyard at Barts is vibrant at lunch hour, the fountain sparkling in the center under a canopy of bright green European beech trees, nurses, administrators, and doctors passing by.
"I woke up female today," John says once he descends from his bedroom that morning. Sherlock looks at him perplexed. John then goes to make himself his morning tea. They don't discuss it.
Her saying that was certainly an effective way to cut those lofty ideals down to size. But what did she mean, in saying that?

He retires to his room, the door slamming behind him.

“No. Of course not.”
a rapist. And you thought it would be a good idea to go on a date with said rapist. All by your lonesome."
“I..’m sorry... family?” John tilts his head, eyebrows contorting a tinge. It's the last part that confuses him most of all.
“Yes.”
As he continued to follow the him, not even hearing the angry honks as he commandeered the crosswalks, gradually his suspicions were confirmed. John was headed to the Diogenes club with the intention of seeing his brother, which was fine, perfectly fine, not that it was consuming his every waking thought or anything. One car screeched to a halt six inches from him and was rear-ended by another. When the drivers started yelling abuse at each other, causing something of a scene, Sherlock simply ignored them and walked around, more pressing matters on hand.

"I think he's dead." Rose says eventually.
“Or a dream that I could wake up from at any second.. and you’d be gone,” John looks at him sadly, “How would I.. how would I know?”
"John if you want, you can visit again,” he says, taking John by the shoulder as he guides him back out, “We'll give you the appropriate clearance and security briefing."
"I can't have you thinking I'm fragile," he says mechanically.
“Oh— No, come in. I won’t kill you, I don’t want to kill you—” the current replies tenderly, and John feels unnerved. The words he says are ammunition, manipulation thrown back at him by some unknown invisible force, parroting him with increasingly apparent ingenuity, “Come back into the water. Come into the water, John Watson.”
“Hm?” Having selected a brand, John is withdrawing a box from the shelf of cereals.
"You're not very affected by this." Rose notes.
Sherlock's phone chimes as they're are walking back from the station. He stops, his thumbs hovering over the keyboard on his mobile.
"Midlife crisis, I imagine," Sherlock shrugs innocently, licking his fingertips and carding through his loose-leaf case files again. Yes, he'd brought them downstairs with him.
JOHN: WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?
, when it's Sherlock who has every right to be angry with John right now. He had
“Molly, you haven’t seen Sherlock’s body lying around, have you? Dr. Gibson says it’s been misplaced,” John says playfully, although he’s clearly not in a humorous mood.
“Fair enough. Deal.”
"No." He rejects the idea outright. He can't accept it. He can't even think it.
SHERLOCK: DOES JUMPING OFF BUILDINGS COUNT?
"They're turning it into a rom-com."
He absentmindedly goes about doing the dishes, pointedly avoiding the sight of Sherlock's silent violin sitting in its satin-lined case, untouched, or the empty coat rack that just looks wrong, or his unmanned microscope sitting on the countertop, mocking him.
Mary raises her eyebrows at the suggestion. “Oh I can do better than that,” she says, pushing off the floor to her feet.
Sherlock gives him an underhand glare, a sudden spurt of razor blue that John sees but fails to observe.
"I know," he says.
His bold blue eyes stare straight ahead at the island, temple flexing, jaw rearranging the taste of mineral salt in his mouth. His mouth flattens into a defiant frown and he stands.
Martin unfolds his arms and holds his hands up in the air, which basically means he doesn’t want to hear it.
until now.
"It's a little late in the game don't you think? To realize you are in love with him now that he's dead," she says, rosining the bow, shedding the dust flecks of amber into the air.
Lestrade looks at him blankly.
He breaks the surface for a split second, and in that second it occurs to him, to his imminent horror, that the creature, the monster, is playing with him. It's a game of Tug of War.
“Sherlock, have you paid the rent?” he asks as they pass Sherlock on the way to the kitchen. Sherlock is unresponsive, rubbing his aligned forefingers against his open but silent mouth, so John turns to his young companion in quick succession. “Did he pay the rent?”
Located on the far left periphery, John, armed with his friendly aid the champagne glass, glares with equal ammunition at the priest. The glass, on second thought, is perhaps not so friendly because it has done nothing to curb his pained suffering, and has rather exacerbated it by the look of things. His expression, tight-jawed and menacingly humourless, demands tiredly, impatiently, and plainly of the priest,
“I didn’t-! Listen to me, I'm telling you this isn't what it looks like,” he raises his voice compellingly, and the sound of it rings with earnestness, “Don't listen to him, Mary. He's trying to make you come back."
He sees that it is a drowned human corpse, covered in fabric, probably fallen victim to the riptide. The creature gapes gleefully at his luck and shoots in front of the shark, snagging the specimen before the curious carnivore can take a chunk out of it. He braces his arms around the chest of the body, which, as he inhales against its skull, smells delightfully fresh, and plunges downward to evade the nosy great white. The creature quickly discovers how drastically the body slows his speed and that he can’t possibly outpace a shark with it in tow, so he spirals around menacingly with a deft swerve of tail, growling at the toothy monster, and kicks its nose in a threatening flounce. The shark veers off in an askance direction, and drifts further away, seemingly deterred from its investigation.
“I don’t care,” she retorts icily, apparently not in the mood.
“Everything alright with Sherlock, I trust.” Mycroft had offered his usual slimy, polite smile. John hadn’t said anything.
Sherlock takes a step back, the curtain falling from his fingertips, forgotten.
He stares into its eyes, the way that the irises, alight with fluorophores, open into blackness, and he’s instinctively reminded of what it looks like, staring down the barrel of a gun.
"I'm sorry for keeping this from you, and that you had to find out in this way. It was a necessary security precaution," he explains, seeing the look on John's face. "The building is currently on lock down, so it's best that we take our leave," he says.
Sherlock remains uncharacteristically silent.
Sherlock looks perplexed. “What? What’s wrong?”
“Consolation sex?”
After a brief hiatus just long enough for it to grow bored, it tags him and drags him down again. John releases a frustrated scream, garbled by the water. He tears his foot away and it lets him struggle upward for a moment, before tugging him down again, and again, insidiously halving his progress, not making it fruitless, but maddeningly, unbearably slow. Each time, he feels like his heart is sinking in his chest. His lungs ache and contort with pain, his throat twisting with voiceless emotion.
Sherlock eyes her warily as she circles around him, a smirk on her lips that’s been irrevocably woven into his memory. The room is empty except for them, with a few distant voices talking in the parlor room adjacent. The lamplight scatters a dim, diffuse glow across the floor in an otherwise darkened room. She steps nearer, boxing him into the corner of the room, the wall ever present at his back. Her fingers linger on the small table between them and the wall.
,” she corrects herself. Sherlock smiles as she slams the door to his room.
“Case then?” Sherlock asks, stomach flipping anxiously.
I'm breaking the final part up into scenes because it's too long for me to do in one go. I get tired after about 1000 words. That last chap was a stretch. v.v also, if you want faster updates, do ask.
John can't say he actually disapproves of his taste- he'd just never liked her, for whatever reason. He could say it was because she had been in league with Moriarty, or because she had double crossed him a number of times, but the truth is he could never really pin down why she bothered him.
“Which is why you’re dying,” she says.
"This is a potential murder investigation and you're missing the body?" Sherlock asks, having a very hard time wrapping his head around the fact that they can’t locate a body that fell less than 24 hours ago.

“What do you mean gone?” Ben turns on him.
"You go home, Sally," he sighs, "I'll handle this."
“I know.”
“If you knew, you could have said something, spared us the trip back.”
“What’s he dreaming about?” she asks, seated on the floor so that she can better observe him.

" He imagines Sherlock's ego must be having a victory dance at his expense right about now. He really needs to stop handing Sherlock free reasons to over-inflate his sense of self worth.
“That wasn’t your first time was it?” he asks after he’s finished, throwing away the some bloodied antiseptic dressage.
Of course, the answer, for Sherlock, is a unequivocal
” the voice sounds incredulous, “
," Sherlock says emphatically, resisting the urge to flail his arms.
John swallows, knowing he shouldn't go there, shouldn't let himself buy into the obvious tricks she was playing on him. He knows full well he is going to regret what he's about to ask, indulging in the false and impossible. "She told me that she could fix him."
"Of course it is," she sighs, returning the violin to her case. "So now that you've finally realized he's not a sociopath you've come groveling to me for his life."
falling to the floor. She picks up the volume and slowly slides it back in place, leaving them inches apart. She watches him swallow, his throat dry, silently chiding himself at the way his stomach turns.
"If you think this makes me want to mock you, you're very,
John groans. He knows what he needs, but he’s not sure if Sherlock will understand.

You’ll emerge on the other side, stronger than before. I’ll see to it. I’ll be beside you. If you fall, I’ll help you up. Again and again, as often as you need me to. Always.”
“Say it, please…” he growls.
“Look up. I’m on the rooftop.”
“Hello,” I say and make to get up to greet him. “I’m Dr Watson. How can I---”
"I've read about it, John. It's quite common to feel an improvement like this shortly before--- before the end. Something like… a last hurrah."
He’s breathing heavily, his hands holding my head in a tender grasp, his long fingers caressing the nape of my neck.
“Go to the bedroom, John, and get out of those clothes.

The corner of John's mouth twitches upwards in a brief smile.

He tells Sherlock everything in the end – how the plane didn’t end up crashing after all, how Lily tried to get him to confess his feelings to him, how he thought he could never do that because of his responsibilities, how he threw away the napkin and then went back for it, how he decided to just suffer through it and try to forget, and how it didn’t let him sleep three nights in a row.

Peter bites his lip, still looking cold and angry, but doesn't say anything more. John nods.
He doesn't want to get high as badly anymore, so yes, it did.

I close the distance between us and look up into his expressionless face.

", I gasp. "Keep going--- Just--- a
“Not now. Maybe later,” Sherlock mutters, his gaze never leaving John, who’s beginning to feel like one of the specimens his friend loves to scrutinise under the microscope.
His thrusts lose their rhythm when he spills himself inside of Sherlock, and nothing has ever felt as good. He feels dizzy from the pleasure throbbing through his nerves.
"Are you--- sure this is okay?" John asks him and positions himself, his thighs trembling with the strain of holding back. "No condom?" His voice is deep and breathless, and Sherlock can tell that he has to fight to keep himself in check. "Talk to me."
He purses his lips. It looks guilty.
“I saw your face above me, and you played your grief so convincingly that it tore my heart apart.”
It's been there forever.
Sherlock gestures towards his bed.
“When you touch yourself, it will be my hands pleasuring you. Just imagine it, and I’ll be there.”
Without another word, Sherlock turns and leads him through the living room, then into the hall and towards his bedroom. He follows, his heart beating wildly.
My head is filled with nothing at all. I am not even scared anymore. “Dumbstruck” might be the best word to describe it. What does Mrs Hudson know that I do not? How come she is not surprised, or disgusted? I feel like a blasted idiot, and I am sure I look it right now.
Sherlock is so fast asleep now, tired out by the events of yesterday, and John smiles and suppresses the urge to touch his pillow-tousled hair. He doesn’t want to wake him. Most days, he's up even before John is, which says a lot, since Rosie usually wakes her father up shortly after sunrise, and after half an hour of cuddling in John's bed demands to be fed and changed and entertained. When John carries her downstairs, Sherlock often sits there in his chair, clad in his pyjamas and a dressing gown, and reads, or works on a case, or simply stares into space.
"No," a silky voice says, and before John has time to be surprised, a hand grabs his upper arm and pulls him back.
to ease the almost unbearable tension, I am aware that now it is
She blushes.
…" I hush him. "We don't have to talk about it now."
Sherlock lets go of John to follow her, but not without planting one last kiss into John’s hair and mumbling, barely audibly: “I suppose I’ll retrieve my reward later.” John shoots him another look as a reminder that this is neither the time, nor the place for amorous innuendo, and Sherlock grins and allows himself to be dragged out of the room.
He drops a small lump of sugar into my cup and then stirs, and I watch his jaw work restlessly, as if there is so much more he wants to say, but he somehow cannot find the strength to do so. I am touched by his worrying about my well-being, but he is wrong in thinking that it is he who is responsible for my injury.
"I'm sorry," he repeats. "I needed to protect you. He--- he'd have killed you if I hadn't pretended to jump."
Sherlock lost his hair, his gorgeous salt-and-pepper curls, first. Then he lost his appetite, and the little weight retirement had put on him as well. He lost his strength. In the end, when it became clear that nothing they did made only the slightest difference, he lost his will to keep fighting. And that was that.
When Sherlock nudges his thigh and signals him to turn around, he complies willingly. He rolls onto his back and opens his legs for him, and Sherlock lies down on top of him, so slender, all his muscles quivering, and that's when John snaps out of his stupor and remembers that Sherlock has never done this before.
"What if we--- What if I do it wrong and this--- it doesn’t work out? Or--- Or what if she doesn’t like sharing you with me? I mean, she shouldn’t have to. She should be your first priority."
They kiss for long minutes, the breath they share growing hot and heavy, and then John reaches down and between Sherlock’s legs to rub against his hardness, and Sherlock moans and breaks the kiss to stare at him out of ample eyes.

"God, me too," he says, because it's true.

in love.
“Do not do yourself an injustice, Mrs Hudson,” Holmes says and sits down in his own chair again. “You are far from old - or deaf, for that matter. You did not hear me come home because I was never out in the first place.”
His voice fades out at the end, and a surge of possessive power John hasn't felt in ages almost overwhelms him with its intensity. Sherlock rarely ever begs. Hearing him do it in such an uninhibited manner tonight makes John go insane with pride and desire.
Sherlock purses his lips and shakes his head.
"You won't," he breathes back. "Whatever happens, you won't."
He waits with bated breath, but Sherlock shakes his head rather vehemently in response.
“Yes.”
“Sherlock--- Thank you for apologising. I--- I’m not even sure you have to. But please believe me – I’d never leave you. I’d never want anything,
He takes his time getting ready for bed, taking a shower and cleaning himself very thoroughly, and even as he leans into the pleasantly warm spray of water and loosens his tense muscles, he wonders who he's trying to kid. Of course he's losing his head over this. This is not simply sex. It's not about feeling good and having a bit of fun together, and it's not even about love. Or rather, it's about all of these things, but combined, and

Then they settle back against their pillows, Sherlock with his head on John's chest, John with his arms wrapped around Sherlock's bony shoulders.
She spits the last part, her expression filled with rage and condescension. It's not like her to speak like this, but John doesn't blame her for reacting the way she does. He deserves it for what he's doing to her.
Sherlock looks back up at John. “You think so?” he asks.
idiots."
"You didn't learn it any other way. And I gave you many reasons to be furious with me. Too many," he says quietly.
When he reaches for the vial and the water bottle, Sherlock doesn't ask him if he's sure – not this time.
John gets up. His legs feel like they don't belong to him.
"You're amazing," he tells him, and there's no envy involved in it whatsoever today – Sherlock deserves this, deserves to feel this kind of pleasure, and he'll do everything to keep it coming to him. "You're---
“Are you comfortable with this?” I ask him.
“Okay, I’m ready now,” he says, sits down in his chair, and looks into the camera. “Hello, John. I’m sorry I’m not there at the moment. I’m very busy. However, many happy returns.”

rhythm of in and out and
“No. Please,” I rasp, not recognising my own voice. “One more minute.”
Sherlock's eyes, wet and wide open, then heavy-lidded and unfocused.
On impulse, he pulls the slip of fabric towards himself and off its hook, digs his fingers into the smooth, expensive wool, and then buries his face in it.
John takes a deep breath, relief flooding him.
It's good to banter, Sherlock thinks as he watches John rise and adjust himself in his jeans. Unlike relationships, and love, and sex, and all their complicated implications, this at least is familiar territory. And it shows him that their old selves are still there, still hiding underneath it all. With time, they can get them back, and then they'll move on.
“Make that a double, please.”
"I'm sorry I hurt you, John," he says.
Sherlock hesitates, then bites his lip and makes himself ask.
Thank God.
John knows he needs to stop this before his friend’s brain short-circuits.
“Ever---” he croaks, and stops to clear his throat. “Ever the romantic,” he then whispers.
I rise onto my elbow and for a moment my eyes meet Holmes’, which are mirroring the panic settling in my chest.
"I wasn't sure if you'd want to, after all this."
The scenario runs through my head in mere seconds, and suddenly I'm seeing it, as clearly as if it was real.
"Yesss…" he slurs, John's hard, hot length inside him all that he can feel, all that he can
to die… Not
“Yes, we are,” I answer. “You can move now… I’m alright.”
"Your beauty is beyond words," I say and kiss his hip, then his left buttock. "I could look at you forever and never get bored."
Sherlock raises his head, which seems to take some effort, and finds Rosie lying between them, and for a second John sees something like panic glint in the younger man's eyes. It’s gone before he can analyse it, and then Sherlock smiles back at him. It doesn’t look entirely convincing.
John shivers at the soft sound of his voice.
"John, what---"
“I'll help you down the stairs.”
I feel terrible, knowing that he’s trying to protect himself from my pity and self-loathing by dealing with his demons on his own, but I can see why he’s been doing it. I’ve been handling the whole thing like a bloody idiot.
If he starts crying now, there’s no way I’ll be able to keep it together myself.
Sherlock watches him reach out in slow motion, all of a sudden not sure anymore whether he's still here in his messy kitchen or in his mind palace, where the world is different, and then John's hand is in his and he holds on to it as tightly as he dares to, and as his sense of reality collapses in on itself, he eventually stops thinking altogether.
So John gives him what he asks for.
“That’s the most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me,” John says and smirks back at him.
night from now on.
We move together like that for a long while, slowing down as our pulses stop racing and our breathing evens out, and eventually he stills and sinks down onto me more heavily to put his cheek on my chest.
Sherlock is at a complete loss. What does this mean? What is John trying to say?
“Mm,” Sherlock hums happily. “Much better.”
When, if not now?
After a while, Sherlock stops moving, and John with him. They lie there, legs entwined, arms slung around each other, catching their breath.
And it'll be alright.
John remembers Sherlock's bloody face and the way his pulse fluttered against his palm as he almost strangled him. He feels terrible, mind-numbing fear take over his whole body, chilling him to the bone. How could he promise that he'd better himself? It's inside of him, and it's always been there, ever since he was a boy. Why should it disappear just like that?
to. I want to grab him, push him, my fingers are itching to weave into his hair and finally subdue him – but I can’t. I need clear permission. He’s my treasure. I’d never risk hurting him or making him uncomfortable when we’re together like this.
“You make things easier for me, too,” John says. “It’s one of the many reasons we make a great team.”
"Well, your brother is not fucking here,
"Do you mean the
I smile back at him and card my fingers through the ruffled hair sticking up behind his ears.
"Fuck me; fuck me---" he hears himself whisper, and he can't control his voice; it just bubbles out of him, like an involuntary mantra.
Sherlock utters something that sounds like a purr, deep inside his chest, and slides his palms up and over John’s hipbones until he can hook his fingers into the waistband of John’s trousers, and although the skin-on-skin contact is minimal, John can’t help but moan in response.
He doesn’t sound irritated by my question, and I let out the breath I was holding and slide my hand under his collar to get more skin-on-skin contact.
He takes another long, deep breath, and then his tongue is there, nudging me,

“You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,” Sherlock mutters, very seriously. “You’re
Sherlock). He's scared that what happened, what Sherlock did, will stand between them somehow.
Sherlock nods and sucks at John's tongue when it comes within reach, and they deepen the kiss for a long, blissful moment. John tastes of tea and himself, and there's nothing Sherlock likes better. He could spend the rest of his life kissing John, and it would be perfect.
But he doesn't.
The girls giggle.
It was the truth.
“Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty.”
We’ll apparently just carry on where we left off.
He sort of expects them to fail spectacularly and end up in a painful knot of limbs, but, to his pleasant surprise, it works out fine. He gets on his knees while Sherlock sinks back and onto the mattress, and he catches himself with one arm and almost slips out of him in the process—but only almost. When it’s done and John has come to rest on top of him, Sherlock gazes up at him and grins tenderly.
Sherlock smirks.
He complies without a word, and before he knows what's happening, John has gone down on his knees behind him to nip at his hip, then at the back of his thigh.
not gay!"
His hands come down to stroke my shoulders then, warm and comforting, and I realise that I need to sleep. I feel sated and content and absolutely wrecked, and I could sleep for a whole week now.
“Yes,” he answers. “Whatever you wish, John.”
“Daddy! Papa!” she exclaims as they pass a small ice cream parlour. “Hudders says when you do something good, you get ice cream as a reward. I think you should have some ice cream, Papa.”
” he complains, his voice vibrating with the impact of our coupling. “Do--- it!”
He gives me a brief look that holds several messages all at once.
“Slowly,” I murmur. “Slowly.
"I love you," he says. "
I can see him swallow.
He doesn't feel drunk anymore, which is probably down to the amount of adrenaline and endorphins coursing through his system right now. He's tired, exhausted even, but his head is clear.
Sherlock raises his head and looks at him, his face flushed, and it's such a stunning sight that John simply
"Remember when Mrs H used to complain about the noise?" John wants to know, and Sherlock has to concentrate
It's often hard to pretend not to notice, but John gives him enough material to work with, being so busy pretending himself. Pretending to care.
John smiles at him and brushes his cheekbone with his thumb.
"Please," Sherlock repeats and lies down beside him again. "John."
Sherlock hums, and John is glad to hear him sound more like his old self now – pleased with himself and clearly amused, with a slight undertone of
He swallows audibly.
"I've been dreaming about kissing you against this wall one last time for ages… ever since we moved away, in fact…"
The sky looks dark, even though it's only late afternoon. Bad weather's on the way.
“Come in my mouth, John…
, John thinks.
She's grasping at straws by now, and somehow he senses that she knows it, too. He raises his hands in a placating gesture, hoping against hope that she'll sit back down, that she'll allow him to touch her, to hold her. He wants to hold her so badly.
much," he repeats to ease the pressure behind his ribs.
John puts his index finger on Sherlock’s lips to shush him. “Sleep apnoea’s treatable. And stop trying to ruin my sweeping romantic sentiments with logic.”
"Come inside," he tells him. "You're freezing."
“Sshhh,” he says again.
“And he’s mine,” John murmurs coarsely. “
you. I promise."
“You never cease to amaze me,” I reply as I lower my heels back to the floor. Then I reach up to tuck a wayward curl behind his ear. “But we might as well shout it from the rooftops then. You know every wall at the Yard has ears.”
“It’s okay,” he lies, trying to keep his tone steady. “I’ll get over it. Don’t worry.”
John, flabbergasted, looks around the room. There's no one there.
Then a memory comes back to him that makes his blood run cold with yet another wave of shock and self-loathing.
He sounds so calm, so at peace with everything, and I want to shout at him to be more upset, to allow himself the fury, the pain - he deserves it! He's been wronged!
It is the only coherent thought my confused mind is able to settle on.
I think about your face, your cheekbones flushed with pink, your lips parted in anticipation. You were nervous, but not embarrassed. You trusted me, you said. With all of it. I have no idea what I’m doing, I told you. It was meant to be a warning, but you just grinned. There was nothing I wasn’t allowed to do with you.
He seems to notice what’s happening inside my head and smiles down at me, his eyes bright.
Then she lets go.
Sherlock snorts loudly.
His heart is stumbling, but it's okay.
They're standing by the window, looking down at a rainy, wind-swept Baker Street. Dusk is approaching fast; the street lamps have already come on.
He gets up and lies down on the couch and goes to his mind palace to sort through the images and scents and sounds of whatever it was that happened to him – to
Sherlock gives John a half-smile and squeezes his hand back. “I’m...alright.”
"What would you like to eat? Pick anything! Anything on the menu, on the house. For you… and your date!" he says exuberantly and winks at John, who chuckles and fidgets with his napkin, wondering where you can still get gold teeth nowadays.
He swallows and closes his eyes for a moment, bracing himself. It's more difficult than he thought. Telling himself that it has to be like this, that there's absolutely no other way, he then opens his lids again and slowly reaches out to put the key into the lock.
"He's weak," she says.
John smiles to himself. Although he knows he shouldn’t encourage Sherlock with his crazy ideas, it’s always difficult to say no to him when his face lights up like that. “It’s wonderful to see your enthusiasm,” he says, “but I’m...not quite sure severed body parts are allowed inside a primary school.”
I don’t think it does.
Sherlock sits down on his rickety motel bed, nursing his arm. He knows he should go and clean himself up so as not to get too much blood on the bedsheets, but he's exhausted, and a minute of rest might help to get rid of the dizzy feeling slowing down his brain right now. He hopes it's not another concussion. They won't ask about the sheets, he thinks as black dots dance across his field of vision. This establishment has seen worse.
He is shaking beneath me, his whole large frame rigid to the point of discomfort, or so it seems to me. Regardless of what he says, he
“It was an accident. Heat of the moment.”
They have to separate so that Sherlock can rummage in his drawer again and find a condom, and John watches him and runs his hand down his back and thigh in a tender caress.
"I want to kiss you all over," John mutters into their connection. "Please… let me."
"John. Are you… jealous?"
John’s eyes begin to prickle, along with a slight tickle of his throat. He squeezes Sherlock’s hand, nuzzling his nose against his cheek and placing a small kiss there. “You owe me nothing,” he insists. “We’re partners, Sherlock. Partners in crime, and partners in life. And everything we’ve done together…it always has been, and always will be, my honour and privilege.”
His eyes, so incredibly coloured in blue and green and gold, bore into mine.
John is sure.
“That’s all for now… Oh, wait, no. There’s one more thing. Have fun at the pub, Dr Watson.”
Sherlock frowns at him in indignation, and John is astonished to see him blush.
I open my lids, slowly, afraid of what I’m going to find in his eyes, but he’s looking at me with such tenderness that it makes my stomach clench.
Sherlock's lips open and he wets them with the pink tip of his tongue. John can't help but stare.
He still can't sleep.
, yes, let me in,” he whispers and thrusts shallowly, using the way Sherlock’s body is rhythmically convulsing around him to push further and further inside without having to use too much pressure himself. “You’re lovely,
"Why?" Sherlock asks without meaning to. His head feels like it's going to explode. "Why did you do that to me?"
"It's intuition, not sentiment. And you're
“Sshh,” John hisses, wincing in pain.
“Shooting was easy, much easier than I’d thought before I had to do it for the first time. The bomb was more difficult, because I was scared that I’d also hit innocent bystanders… and once--- once, I had to--- with a
“Oh, lots,” Sherlock states. “In fact, just last week, I discovered a man who’d had his entire skull bashed in by a—“
, remember?”
you’re alarmed,” he teases him. “I bet your pillow talk sounds so… so
"You do," I reply, because he does. "You're so thin. We'll have to feed you."
Sherlock half-smiles at him and crinkles his nose the way he does when he's about to lecture someone on something, and John has been that someone so often already that he can easily identify the sign.
“Yes,” he breathes, running his hand up and into my hair again. “Yes, John.”
“Mm,” Sherlock sighs, but makes no move to disentangle himself from John’s embrace. Instead, he slips his hands beneath John’s jumper and pulls at the shirt he’s wearing underneath, trying to get at more bare skin to stroke and knead and scrape against with his blunt nails.
He snorts at his own joke, and I furrow my brow and look at Mycroft.
“You’re so sexy, Sherlock, oh God…” he pants, brushing the spot again and again, and Sherlock whines and follows his movements with small thrusts of his hips. “Fuck, yes, show me how you like it, come on…”
He’s quite drunk, and Sherlock is drunk as well, and it’s so different, seeing him with his guard down like this – maybe that’s what makes him talk about these things with him. Or maybe it’s the Madonna marathon they’ve been watching on YouTube because Sherlock didn’t know who she is, bless him, and now he does, but he’s also slightly taken aback by the more explicit lyrics and stage outfits. It’s endearing, actually.
He holds on to John when he begins to establish a rhythm, presses his heels into the mattress to give him leverage, and after a minute or two his mind goes blank. He stops thinking about doing things wrong, of losing control, of losing himself in this. Maybe it's supposed to feel like that, even. What does he know?
"You didn't come," John suddenly says, his voice hoarse.
"You two go on inside. You're not even wearing a coat, love. I'll get Sherlock and Hettie."
"I wish we'd woken up earlier," Sherlock whispers and chuckles. John's heart stumbles over a beat when he feels the other man grind his hips against his behind, because the thin material of their pyjamas doesn't do anything to hide the fact that he's sporting an erection, a very impressive one, considering everything that happened last night.
“Gosh, you broke it clean in two,” John remarks.
Sherlock decides to join him and stands abreast his partner, observing the celebration from the outskirts as the semi-pariahs that they are. “I think I’m the only parent here who’s actually in a celebratory mood. And I don’t even like weddings,” Sherlock mentions amidst the chatter.
“An academic exercise,” John voice is tenuously raw, “You really are the king of detachment.”
“I don’t want to eat it,” Sherlock has to be honest, put off by how unappetizing it looks, because food, by default, is unappetizing to Sherlock.
Mary and Sherlock nod enthusiastically, and John is a bit puzzled by the overt display of obedience. He looks between them, his suspicions roused. Are they usually this quiet?
Nigel looks amused. “You didn’t have to do that,” he says.
Later that day, Mary discovers Sherlock loitering by the schoolyard fence on her way to the gym. She stops and backpedals, eyes narrowing in on his distant, aimless, wandering figure.
It's an odd question to ask. "Well, how else was I meant to catch you?"
John is momentarily taken aback.
“What is this? You sound like somebody’s paying you to keep you quiet,” she laughs, “Has this game of keeping yourselves in the dark warped into some sort of giant conspiracy?”
“He’s not seeing anybody else,” Sherlock admits tenuously, and John is satisfied. But Sherlock is restless, unable to resist the temptation to add on, “
John strides into the waiting room of the clinic at a brisk pace, ready to see his next patient. He plops manila folder to a mesh wire bin situated on the administrative desk, where he recognizes one individual amongst the assorted crowd of drop-ins, a teenage boy coincidently seated closest in the line of chairs to him.
they would just move on, go their separate ways, but-
“Problem?” Sherlock ventures inquiringly in response to the overt confusion on the adolescent’s face.
Shrouded in the dark recesses of the tavern, an air of ominousness hangs over the stranger like a dark cloud. By chance, the soldier catches the fellow's eye when he occasions a fleeting glance toward him, the shadows unveiling his pale face. The stranger returns the his gaze for a drawn-out minute, during which the taunts and jeers of his more boisterous counterparts fade away. The stranger's eyes are striking in color and vaguely preternatural in their compelling hold, thrilling and terrifying and electrifying in a way that quickens the pace of his pulse.
“That was me getting married to your mother,” John explains.
“You actually
“Well I don’t think you have to do anything special really.”
"This man died just as she was leaving- a man who just happened to have killed her mother and is a paternal match. That doesn't strike you as odd?"
apparent,
He stops when he realizes she's chuckling to herself-
Yes, he did say that. He'd said a lot of things. So many things and they were are all so dreadfully wrong. Hearing them again is as sobering as a punch in to the face.
Nigel’s error in word choice presents Sherlock with a new fatherly challenge that he has not encountered before. How to split up a fight. Noting that boys generally excel in height and strength relative to girls starting at age 14, Sherlock is hoping the boy at the approximate age of 15 and 4 months, will be able to defend himself, but unfortunately that isn’t the case.
“Hey Watson!” Sherlock hears someone yell, so he turns around, family name and all.
“Instead of
It's plain and simple process of elimination, as to who Gabriel is going to kill next. Assassins killing assassins. Just lovely.
"Sherlock?" he asks but it warrants no response, just a cavernous, resentful silence in which one might hear their own echo. "You're shaking."
“Sorry,” he says, looking a little fazed. “If my wife sees me talking to you she might completely lose it,” he says curtly, to Sherlock's surprise.
John turns to him with a smile across his lips, eyes deep sapphire blue. “I’m just relieved it hasn’t gotten to that point yet,” he replies, then he leans forward, stroking his fingers through Sherlock’s fringe. His eyes widen in amazement as the digits string through the darkness of his hair, picking up stray carbon particles.
When he meets Greg at the evidence locker, the inspector tries to remind him that he’s not his lapdog, which he is. Passing the meshed security gate, they turn on the lights to a dilapidated vault containing racks of boxes that have been collecting dust since 1997.
Sherlock lists all of this in 2.5 seconds and the two of them are barely able to discern what he’s saying, much less realise that he's included John in his list of "women",
His eyes once-over its striking figure and sharp tailfins in appraisal. He scoffs amusedly with a cockiness that rivals the creature’s own, and resumes his ministrations, accumulating wood. But as he carries on down the beach, he feels the urge to look again, and this time he takes a good look.
“Aren’t they upstairs?” John tilts his head out the door.
“What you just said.”
“Useless,” he tsks, temperamental.
That’s the one.
“Put. Me. Down.”
Mary doesn’t deign to respond, merely glares, scoffing internally at his pettiness.
passive aggression. "Tell me, when, during the course of your little investigation did you deem it necessary to have her hands all over you?"
That triggers some mild alarm on the other end, “
Sherlock: Oh.
When he wakes it's to the sound of muffled voices. His vision comes blearily into focus at the excited sound of a young cadet. He thinks the cadet is saying something along the lines of 'look, this one's alive!', hollering the rest of his patrol over to his find.
John, Sherlock, and Mary are seated in the head administrators office.They all seem particularly interested in the unremarkable, ashen grey walls of the room. John stares ahead to one portion of the wall, spine ram-rod straight, rubbing the digits of his left hand together. He turns his gaze over to the other wall with a playful tilt of the head and discovers, yes, he does like eggshell white as a wall paint color.
"What?" he fumbles, "Of course not." Sherlock groans internally at his idiocy and returns his attentions to Lestrade.
"Now, listen Mary.." he says gingerly. He takes a reconciliatory step forward, but Mary takes one back.
"Just drop it, Sherlock. Your whole theory is ridiculous," Anderson says, smugly crossing his arms, "You know, I'm curious, how did you even get her DNA, anyway? Did she 'rape' you too?" he asks. Sherlock's mouth opens with a response, but then clicks closed.
"Have you been talking to her again? I warned you about her, didn't I?"
Mycroft’s expression falls. “You’ve taken issue with

can shut up now,” Sherlock throws her words back at her with a smirk, though he is clearly more annoyed with himself than his dance partner. As they continue waltzing, he directs most of his attention to Mary, but is continuously aware of John’s presence beyond the corners of his vision, and absently wonders how much of their conversation John might have heard.
or some permutation of invectives thereof. But he doesn't actually know how to finish that sentence. What was he supposed to say? That this was because he loved him? That that was something that Sherlock had no chance of reasoning with, talking him out of, or arguing with-- that it wasn't a logical or rational thing?
"Now what am I going to do with you?" he hears her say almost playfully now that she has him within her power, deliberating her options. Only now does he realize the danger he's placed himself in. He's the only one who knows she did it. He hasn't shared his findings with anyone else. He didn't even mention she was a suspect to John. John thinks he's on a
“Alright,
John shudders a sigh, completely convinced his mind is playing tricks on him now. A sane man knows talking water doesn’t exist. “Stop talking.”
John glances hopefully at Sherlock and sees he’s still not paying attention, staring dazedly into thin air. He sighs and towels his sooty hands off, going to the check the door.
He heads through security, that is, the legal way. The number of security personnel has ramped up significantly from last time, although they don't give him much trouble, which is likely a byproduct of Mycroft's influence and the fact they already have him in their system. He can't imagine they get many visitors.
"Did you kill him?" Ben has the sudden urge to ask.
“Are you f—king mad?
"You don't wear ties," he objects before he can stop to wonder why he's arguing about this. John doesn't like to think he's jealous. Why should he be? Sherlock was his friend. Admittedly, he was a touch over-fond of him, but he didn't see any reason why he should feel possessive about him dating someone else. Yet there it was, an eerie flutter of disquiet in his chest at the idea.
“So. Anyone wanna explain to me what the hell happened,” John chirps.
was the last time Sherlock set foot on a crime scene in the light of day, the last time Sherlock basked in the glory of his mind palace without infant screams shattering its megalithic walls, the last time Sherlock was anything more than just a rotting mess of neurons fulfilling the banal chores of a housewife, the last time Sherlock was Sherlock at all.
“She… forgot?” John repeats, trying to get the story straight.
“After you.”
“I’m sure you’ll patch it up. Tell her something encouraging- like there are plenty of fish in the sea.. or something,” he says awkwardly.
Instead he'd buckled and ran like he was still in grade school. He veils his face with a hand that infuriatingly insists on shaking.
But that is not to say it isn't beautiful.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. John huffs and looks at him, in awe of how, with just one effortless look, he can reduce everything he'd planned to say into cat-caught tongues and white noise.
“But you know everything,” she insists and Sherlock sighs.
"Are we even talking about case files, anymore?" John asks, lost.
John clenches his hand, digging his nails ino his palm. Mycroft doesn't seem to be understanding him. "She... She's done something Mycroft. She-" John struggles, but it catches in his throat. He can't say it.
As the two of them dip under the threshold into the homely expanse of the living room, their faces and shoulders are bathed in sepia from the artificial, overhead lighting. The room is carpeted in ivory synthetic and furnished with warm brown tones, leather sofa, sapele coffee table and ochre fireplace mantle. A secondhand, previous generation television sits on a stand, flat against the far wall, tuned to BBC one. Clara stands across from the pair on the far side of the room in the kitchenette alcove, helping a blonde three-year old into her miniature down jacket.
“Well, it’s—“ Nigel standoffishly tries to fumble for an understatement, but John raises eyebrows in a plea to spare him the deceit.
it cries desperately,
the exception?" John thunders, looking directly at him, and the expression on Sherlock's face is as though John has just stabbed him in the back.
"Well, as you know he was on life support, so not on the whole, dead, just legally dead. Instead of pulling the plug or letting his condition deteriorate, we had him preserved."
Whereas it's a struggle for Sherlock to understand her, she finds him remarkably easy to read. It's a delight to witness how transparently his face betrays him despite his best efforts, and great sport to watch him slowly break apart under the weight of his own convictions. He expects himself to handle it coolly and rationally when really it's absurd to think he even could. He tries to convince himself what's happening is merely injurious to his body and not to his mind, which he holds in such esteem it doesn't occur to him that it can break too, that it's no more immune to torture than his body is.
"Just talk to me will you?" he asks, "Tell me something. Anything." John is looking at him pleadingly but he won't meet his eyes, staring fixedly at the kitchen tile. Desperate, he reaches for Sherlock hand across the table but Sherlock retracts it. It's such a small thing, but it probably would've hurt less if Sherlock punched him straight in the face.
“Adler has proven… difficult to extricate," Mycroft explains, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, "She's got a number of high-ranking officials in parliament as well as the chief superintendent under her thumb, which is why I presume you've encountered some... difficulties."
“Well it must have been because it’s not here,” Sherlock indicates his temple then flourishes his hand helplessly. John narrows his eyes at him haughtily, knowing that if this had been a case file that had casually disappeared, Sherlock would be going ballistic.
You think so?   John’s expression blinks wordlessly. He rights himself, shifting his body upright again so his hold softens, kindly relieving Sherlock of his death grip.
," he insists, "They know their master."
It occurs to him that he's stalled and she's waiting for his move. Realizing it's his turn, quickly he returns his attentions to the game, rearranging his pieces to entrap her elusive queen.
John realizes he’s actually farther out than he expected. Looking across the vast expanse, the notion that anything could cross the distance in one breath seems purely fantastical to John now, and he seriously doubts the obscure memories he has of a mermaid dragging him out here in the darkness; it was much more realistically the riptide. He remembers seeing the creature, and thinks about it constantly enough while swimming that he begins recalling recalls instead of the original memories. The more he thinks about it critically, however, the more convinced he is that the mermaid is a complete work of fiction, a fairytale and not even an original one. And the voices from the water were, well, very obviously a cry for mental help. He really ought to get himself checked.
Sherlock blinks up at the wall, then sideways to Mary, who blinks back at him. There is an unspoken consensus, that this cannot be explained.
“It’s not just Hudders. My friends think it, their moms and dads think it, even my teachers— even the principal— thinks it. Basically I’m just trying to understand how we became a family in first place without you knowing what everyone else seems to know.”
“I agree it’s kind of..” Sherlock mutters, a little off kilter, struggling to place what exactly the vague, hypnotic vibe is, coming off the motions they’re going through. Maybe Sherlock left some lethal chemical out to dry that’s making them fuzzy.
John can’t really tell if a taxi is honking at them or at the other cars or just plain broken. The traffic is awful at any rate, bumper to bumper and even the bikers have dismounted in favor of worming their way through on foot, so it’s a J-walking free-for-all. They cross through a half-dozen red signals, which John thinks is the funnest thing in the world, although it’s hardly considered unusual in central London to do so and mildly suggestive that he should get out more— if he didn’t spend his days locked up in an asylum, that is.
Sherlock sighs wearily at the ceiling with the lack of response, arms resting flat against the wall, then turns and barges into the room at the speed of light.
says his phone, and he freezes in my arms. I close my eyes and press my cheek against his shoulder.
"Look at yourself," John tells him, and Sherlock obeys and inclines his head and sees himself in John's arms, his cheekbones, neck, and chest flushed pink, his penis enveloped in John's fist, his eyes heavy-lidded and almost entirely pupils.
Now he's standing outside, pretending to need a bit of fresh air, and somehow, everything
“Did you plan on confronting me in front of her?”
“You feel amazing, Sherlock…
His thumb brushes my cheekbone, then my eyebrow.
"I don't know how," Sherlock tells him and swallows.
He growls and shakes his head and pulls his nameless bedmate off his cock, breathing heavily.
"God! That's
“Sure.”
"How did you escape?" he asks, just to say
"I--- I don't know. Would
"Ditto," he just says.
"They were. But you didn't know, John. You were upset, and rightly so. I don't blame you."
She watches them standing beside the door, observing the proceedings, the outsides of their arms touching so very subtly,
He takes a step back again, and now it’s me who’s on the receiving end of a deadly glare. I shake my head.
sorry. Do you--- do you need me to leave you alone?"
“Turn around and walk back the way you came now.”
"They changed the wallpaper."
"Did you believe Mycroft when he claimed I was a virgin?"
Sherlock looks resigned at that.
him, the man behind the mask, more loving and passionate than I could ever have imagined.
He reaches out with one arm to pull the duvet up and over their naked forms to keep Sherlock warm. Then he pulls him closer again and shuts his eyes.
“He can’t go out to investigate yet,” I say firmly. “His back hasn’t healed. He needs another week or two.”
“I’m on it. I’ll try not to kick the laptop off the bed this time.”
He hears John give a small, barely audible scoff.
,” he says quickly. “I promise, John. Please trust me. I don’t want the past to overshadow---
Sherlock does, too.
“Sshhh…” he tells Sherlock and himself in equal measure. “Soon.”
He raises his eyebrows and uses his own fingers to trace my cheekbones.
“I'm sorry, John,” he breathes and places a light, barely-there kiss onto my exposed skin, right next to the bandage. “I'm sorry.”
John notices him studying him and smiles a little nervously. He still seems to be struggling with the realisation that Sherlock didn't throw him out, and Sherlock returns the smile as warmly as he can to reassure him.
“I know. I mean--- hi. I’m John.”
"Do you want to get cleaned up?" he asks him.
"Thank you," he says. "That means a lot."
scared."
John leans his forehead against the door and closes his eyes, half-wishing for Sherlock to hear him and call his name, half-terrified that he really might do exactly that.
He somehow expects
Then he's in their living-room, his hair wet, shivering.
He sighs.
“You do not… disappoint,” he suddenly pants. “That probably
"I suppose it would be, yes."
She shakes her head in disbelief. John can't tell if she's angry or desperate. Or both. It's probably both.
"Thanks... I blacked out a bit at the end. Sorry. That's never happened to me before."
"Something like that," Sherlock replies lowly, and John is surprised that he doesn't sound wistful at all.
“Sure. We’re good, John.” She gestures towards the door. “Are you ready for the first one?”
John digs his fingers into his shoulder blades and smiles breathlessly.
John wants to give Sherlock all of himself. He doesn't know what he'd do if something, and be it his own body, kept him from doing so.
John goes down deep, then flicks the sensitive spot right under the crown with his tongue on his way up again. When he pulls away completely, Sherlock mewls involuntarily.
He kisses the soft patch of flesh where my chest meets my armpit.
I flex my jaw and nod, glowering at him.
bare skin, and he remembers a half-whispered, breathless conversation about STDs and bedside drawers containing (John's) and not containing lube (Sherlock's, and that will have to change) that should have felt significantly more awkward than it actually did.
He's thankful for it. As hard as it is to admit it, and as much as it goes against his deep-seated instincts of not allowing anyone except John inside his walls – he doesn't know if he would have survived it all without Mrs Hudson, whom he has long stopped perceiving as only his landlady. She's become so much more to him.
He buries his hand in her dark hair and pushes a little, his hips bucking into her mouth, and she stills and just lets him do it.
, John. I’m exhausting myself analysing it, and I don’t know how to stop.”
tight, incredibly so, and he's glad they're using a condom now, because he knows that if he'd felt this skin on skin, he wouldn't have lasted five minutes.
Sherlock is
"Can you--- finish like this?" John asks, still moving, still raining kisses onto every part of him he can reach, seemingly oblivious to what’s going on inside his head. He might just be too far gone to care. "Because I’m--- I’m gonna come.
“Does Mycroft know?” I ask.
"You're perfect," Sherlock whispers, hoping John won't take it the wrong way and feel belittled. "You're doing so well…"
"Get comfortable, love," I murmur and glide my hands down his flanks. His skin is smooth and warm. "I want you to leave it all to me now…"
Later, John goes and takes a walk in the park with Rosie, bending down and kissing the top of Sherlock's head before he leaves, and Sherlock senses that he's giving him space and is grateful for it.
"I won't," John tells him, his heart aching with affection. "Never."
With my medical kit located so handily close by, the latter is achieved in less than five minutes, and after dressing ourselves and attempting to fix his hair and my moustache in order to look presentable for the task lying ahead, we move to the sitting room and Holmes rings the bell.
The despair in his eyes becomes more prominent. I want the annoyance back.
His words are fluttering against damp, over-sensitive skin and Sherlock's heart beats faster. He still doesn't know what all of this is about, what John wants for the future, but the way they're talking now gives him hope that it might be more than just a one-night thing caused by grief and self-loathing. He is aware of the fact that their relationship is messed up, has been ever since he got back from Serbia, and that adding sex to the equation is unlikely to make things easier. But maybe, just maybe, this is not only about sex. And that is why he decides to be brave and open up, regardless of what it might cost.
The morning of the event, Sherlock is a bit of a nervous mess.
. How can you forgive that? How can you
Sherlock doesn't seem to mind, though. He shrugs.
"So you're bisexual. I fail to see the problem," he says.
John reaches down and gropes around until he can wrap his fingers around Sherlock's hardness, which, despite his reeling, stuttering mind, makes it known that it is interested, very much so, by twitching into his gentle grip right away.
I straighten up again and spread my fingers inside of him to stretch him a bit more.
Sherlock has already left. John doesn't know when – or why, for that matter. He's disappointed, and lonely, and he misses his friend. His best friend. He's tempted to leave, too, and go to Baker Street and ask Sherlock what's wrong and why the hell he went and fled from the scene after giving a speech that was basically a vow of unconditional, undying… love.
I purse my lips, wondering if I should say what’s on my mind. Then I just do. Whatever’s happening in Serbia right now, it’s highly probable that it’s not good.

I scoff and nip my way up his neck again, enjoying the warm, rich scent of his skin.
“I wish we lived in another time, John,” he murmurs, suddenly serious. “I wish I could look at you and not hide my true intent, even when we are out on the street - or in the bathhouse. I wish I could kiss you in the back of a hansom, and hold your hand while we walk in the park. I wish we did not have to live half a life.”
"Brother mine," Mycroft says. "How are you today? Can we tick off yet another item on our list?"
John's body is gloriously warm and smooth and compact in his arms.
He's glad that Mary's been transferred to gynecology for the duration of her pregnancy - she's safe from catching God-knows-what in the ER, and, which is especially important to him right now, he doesn't have to deal with her and his guilty conscience at home

"I'm---" he starts, but trails off again, feeling silly.
He moved back in as soon as the rooms were inhabitable again, because Sherlock asked him to, and because nothing in his life had ever felt so right.
“Yes,
"I'm happy you can't, and I hope you'll never have to find out what it feels like. But please understand why I'm doing this. I'm not… dying
“Alright then. Thanks, Sherlock. John.”
“I don’t deserve you, John.”
He disentangles himself from John’s embrace and gets up from the floor. Then he holds out his hand. John looks up at him and takes it, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet. His legs are still shaking.
The one he'd die for.
"I know. I'm sorry."
John worries his lip between his teeth. He guesses that Sherlock is right – he’s sure he’ll feel better if he gets it all out in the open before they continue to do… whatever it is that they’re going to do.
… It's alright…" he breathes against my temple and puts his palm on my forearm to keep me from moving it away from my stomach.
John closes his eyes. The last thing he sees is Rosie's head, turning in the direction of the door.
Shyly. Quietly.
much.
Lying with him like his, John can feel every tremor running through the other man’s body as he thrusts in and out, and it’s so much better than what they did before. He has to concentrate hard to find Sherlock’s prostate from this angle, but when he finally does, Sherlock rewards him with the most beautiful moan, shuddering in his arms and hiding his face in the crook of his neck.
He raises his head and purses his lips, and I get the hint and shuffle closer to kiss him. His lips are hot – his whole face is glowing.
"They caught me. I was trying to sneak into their headquarters, but I wasn't careful enough. Of course they were very interested in finding out who I was, and if I was part of a larger organisation. When I didn't speak, they tried to... persuade me."
“We’ll have to go through it again and again. It has to look convincing. We’ll have to… practise.”
“When I said I was responsible for what happened to you today, I meant it, Watson,” he says, sounding almost as passionate as he did the moment I was shot. “It was
“Put your hand in my hair,” I tell him, and, his gaze fixed on mine, he raises his right hand and weaves his fingers through my hair, tugging softly.
Sherlock stares at me, his gaze unreadable. Mary raises her eyebrows and puffs out her cheeks. Then she grins at me.
Sherlock probably doesn’t do hugs.
, or, when he’s feeling playful and/or aroused,
The last word and the stress Sherlock puts on it send a jolt of arousal right between John’s legs. He can’t breathe. What’s going on? Why isn’t he stopping this; why isn’t he already running from the flat and home to the woman he’s going to marry in a few days? Why is he more turned on than he can remember, more than ever,
He looks up at me and bites his lip again.
His voice has always been my weakness; even in infuriating situations it made it hard to resist him (“John. Hand me my phone.” – “John. I’m bored.” – “John! Tea!”), but now I realise that it’s like a drug, clouding my brain with its soft, velvety drawl. There seems to be a direct connection from my ears to my lower regions, too, because right now it feels as if I could come if he just kept talking to me.
Wilkes looks him up and down slowly and raises his eyebrows appreciatively.
"The guts? I thought it was supposed to happen in the heart."
“I trust you with my life, John. This, however, is about
I breathe him in, thinking about the obstacles lying before us and trying to ignore their existence for the time being.
“Want me to stop…?” he asks huskily, moving further down still.
," Sherlock whispers. "Cold."
“Do what?”
, and I go down on him as deeply as I can, suppressing my gag reflex when he comes close to hitting the back of my throat. I'd never manage to swallow him, not until he teaches me how, anyway, but I want to make an effort.
She hasn't forgotten Sherlock's fear.
“I’ll go and freshen up. And yes, I’d love a cup of tea then.” She turns to leave the kitchen. “Oh, and boys - the conventional kind, please.”
Sherlock hums non-committally, and John knows he's not listening anymore.
John wants,
John sinks into his embrace and holds him tight.
I shrug.
Her almost business-like tone falters, and she blinks rapidly a few times. John isn't brave enough to lean forwards and touch her face. She looks so desperate, and he's the reason for it.
"I'll try."
It's not like the pink-cheeked, flustered smirk tugging at the corners of Sherlock's mouth as they stumbled into his bedroom after dinner, joined at the lips, hands twisting in offending fabric that needed to go, and
Sherlock's Adam's apple bobs up and down and he pierces John with a look that sets his whole body on fire.
I did it?” John blurts out, aware that he’s not dealing with this in the most ideal way, but unable to stop himself.
John chuckles darkly, exhaling a puff of air that feels cool on Sherlock's damp skin.
“I could kiss you all day,” I mutter and pull his luscious bottom lip into my mouth to suck on it. “You’re so fucking
Breakfast in bed, even though Sherlock can't eat.
"Why did you want to come back here, Sherlock?"
“John,” he says quietly.
"You're ready?"
His voice cracks, and John's tears rise up inside him and spill over before he can prevent it. A small whine bubbles out from between his lips, despite his efforts to stay silent.
… please…
His head is empty. He takes off his jacket to buy some time and watches Sherlock take off his gloves, coat, and scarf, revealing his black Armani suit and that ridiculously expensive purple shirt that's just the tiniest bit too tight (and most definitely too sexy for someone who keeps insisting that sex is "not really his area").
Sherlock shrugs.
“Hello?”
Sherlock shudders. Then he nods and opens his mouth to nip at John's bottom lip, takes it between his own to coax his mouth open with gentle pressure, his tongue sliding out to dip against John's.
"I want--- your
"Just overdose and die, why don't you?" he asks, his voice hollow.
"You're not shutting me out now, Sherlock," John says lowly, his voice level, but tinged with a subtle trace of annoyance that Sherlock doesn't understand.
He can hear the unspoken
That's good. Reasonable. There are dark circles under John's weary eyes. He looks terrible.
John smirks, toes off his shoes, and sits down next to him, his limbs cracking loudly as he folds them to accommodate the limited space next to the lanky form of his better half.
"Mmhh, God, Sherlock… You drive me out of my mind; you're so perfect like this…" he says in a rough half-whisper he's sure Sherlock won't be able to resist. "You're so hard for me tonight…"  He's caressing him slowly, taking care to loosen his grip on the down-stroke to alternate between firm and gentle, and Sherlock falls apart more and more the longer it lasts, trying to set a rhythm with his hips, whining impatiently when John doesn't follow. "Sshhh… not so fast… I love your beautiful cock… I want to make love to you all night…"
. This
, he thinks. Why did he say that? Why did they fight? Why did Sherlock send him away under false pretences? Why did he tell him he was a fake, when only yesterday he tried his hardest to convince John that he wasn't?
"I'm scared," he whispers. "I've never been this scared before, John."
,” he says, giving his voice an air of seductive darkness. “Tell me…”
John nods, his lips brushing the corner of Sherlock's mouth.
of him, even. I want to spend the rest of my life with him, want to wake up next to him in the mornings and nuzzle his curly head, want to hold him, taste his mouth, feel his fingers leave their imprints on my skin as we make love in his bed.
"Come," John whispers, his ocean eyes boring into Sherlock's with such intensity that he forgets how to breathe, how to think, how to stand upright and not fall to his knees in front of him. "Don't go. Come with me. Come upstairs with me."
Whenever he calls, we really
"Me too."
beautiful like this, yes… Pull me in, baby, just like that… God, you feel so hot inside, so
John puts his hand into his pocket to hide the fact that it's curling into a fist.
Still trying to grasp the scope of what has just happened, I shake my head in amazement and look at her, hoping my gratitude will show on my face.
For you finding new spots to inject yourself? Am I neglecting my daughter, my job, my
He walks in on him just like that, naked, and joins him under the warm spray, and John is surprised, but goes along with it.
He utters a vague sound of acknowledgement.
There are things he needs to say, and he's scared he'll never find the words before it's too late.
He should go; he should laugh it off.
Sherlock tries to gather his wits, but fails miserably.
He had intended not to wonder what this all means until later, but now he’s forced to follow that train of thought, and he doesn’t think he’ll like where it is going.
"I'm not going to wander off on my own; don't worry," Sherlock's voice comes floating from out of the half-light, and John stares at the ceiling and the shadows dancing across it, willing himself to not lose his head. "Your phone's in your inside pocket – how would I get at it without waking you?"
John's body wonders how to deal with this confusing mixture of arousal and emotion coursing through its system at that, but gives up immediately when Sherlock goes in for a second, deeper kiss.

"Yes," I say. "Maybe I will. Thank you, John. And I'm sorry."
Sherlock snorts softly. “I was contemplating downing both glasses myself. But I suppose I could make an exception for you.”
Going home is impossible.
He gets what I mean and keeps going, harder, a little faster, and every thrust hits right home. Although I’m a doctor and obviously know the theory of it all, I can’t believe how great this feels. I’m right on the verge of orgasm, but not quite getting there, and it’s the most wonderful kind of torture.
"Do you think I could have bees too? When I have my own house?"
"I'm---
John is perplexed. Leave it to Sherlock to surprise him yet again and get to the point straight away.
"Christ, Sherlock," he whispers. "Are you hard again?"
slowly, lets his hand slide from Sherlock's backside to his front, his fingertips ghosting over a sharp hipbone, over the trail of curls starting below his navel. Sherlock freezes, his chest heaving against John's.
. I can’t think of anything more noble, more…
“Are you okay?” I ask.
"Okay. Who wants some tea?"
John finally sets down the book he’s been reading and turns to face his partner, ready to grant him all of his attention. “Listen, love,” he says as he takes Sherlock by the hand. “I don’t mean to jump to conclusions, but is there something bothering you?”
Sherlock drops the phone. Then he spreads his arms and lets himself fall forwards and over the edge of the roof.

“Fine.”
When Sherlock utters something that can only be described as a sleepy purr of contentment and puts his head back on his shoulder to close his eyes and doze, John grins at the ceiling.
“Yes, John,” he moans, his voice even deeper than usual. “And I want all of you.”
He pulls Sherlock with him, walking backwards until his legs bump against the wooden frame of his bed. Sherlock's heart is hammering as if this was the very first time they'd been together like this.

“It's not a dream. You’ll have this each and every day, Sherlock. Each and every night, if you want it. Please excuse me getting emotional, but I'm just so utterly,
Sherlock shivers.
at me until I am there, inside him, and he inside of me, two souls as one even though our bodies are not joined this time, and in a final, desperate crescendo of lust I spend myself against the bed, making a right mess of everything, but utterly unable to care.
“Make love to me,” Sherlock tells him.
Sherlock turns his head and sucks in a large gulp of air, then grabs John's arms and holds on to them as if he was a drowning man and John the only fixed point in an endless sea of pain.
He keeps going, slowly and steadily at first, then faster, a little harder, lulling himself into some sort of lustful trance until he forgets that his arm is cramping and his lungs are burning with exhaustion, and John keeps making those wonderful noises, groans and sighs and sobs that Sherlock will never, ever forget, and presses the back of his head against his shoulder in mindless ecstasy.
be at home right now, in front of the fire, steaming cups of tea in their hands. He could have taken a hot shower after dinner and then put on his soft flannel pyjamas and a dressing gown. It would have been just another cozy, uneventful evening at Baker Street. Or they could have gotten two rooms at the pub and waited until tomorrow to go and investigate here. They could have sat together and had a pint in well-practised, peaceful silence, and everything would have been nice and normal and---

"We do," he answers softly.
He’s dozing off when Sherlock stirs again.
” I grunt and thrust a little harder. “You’re a fucking---
Warm, salty droplets get smeared on his skin when Sherlock rubs his face against his arm.
“Then it will have been worth it,” I interrupt him, tightening my grip on his face. We are in this together, and I need to make him see that I would do anything just to know him mine. “If it happens despite all our best efforts to protect ourselves, then it will have been worth it to me. Even if they take me tomorrow, I will have had this night. Nothing they could do to me would ever make me regret having you here with me.”
As they leave the flat, John holding the door for Sherlock:
"What does it look like?" he demands, blowing him off in favor of recapturing the suspect he's set his sights on.
“Experimented. A little.”
“Sherlock, you have an eidetic memory with better recall than the bloody camera,” John informs him with hundred percent certitude, “I think you can
“So. Characters now,” the words twist bitterly in his mouth and he grimaces, letting Sherlock know this really isn’t what he needs to hear right now.
“Yes, I
Sherlock starts up to sitting, his mind barreling forward. They knew each other. Gabriel was familiar to him- an
"Why do you have so much faith in her and so little in me?" John wants to know in earnest, "Why don't you trust me?"
19. ARE YOU PATHOLOGICALLY EGOCENTRIC AND INCAPABLE OF LOVE?
As they proceed further into the interior of the bulding, which is cordoned off behind locked doors and security panels. They encounter an armed guard at a security checkpoint, who Eurus engages in conversation before promptly snapping his neck.
John doesn’t seem to understand what this means and stares at her with a sort of blank, lost look on his face.
When he looks up, Eurus has already taken off down the hall. Forced to keep up, he reluctantly leaves the fallen guardsman behind.
He turns to glance at John and sees the look on John’s face. It's condemning. “Oh, don’t look like that,” he sighs tiredly and turns back to face the hall.
“God damn it,” Mary says petulantly. (She watches too many American TV programmes rated MA)
"How would you like it if someone asked you to hand over your medical license John? Hm?" John opens his mouth, then closes it. "Not very, yes, I thought as much." he says, then "I'd sooner start cutting off digits than have my cases taken."
“Yes, well. You’re my daughter. I can tell you anything. I have plenty of collateral- like how you can’t dance—”
“It’s just… your voice. It sounds so much like you,” he explains, horribly nostalgic.
, Danny,” Nigel corrects him exasperatedly.
“Oh,” Sherlock realizes, then waves him off, “Even so. Our daughter has a case.”
A couple days later at Bart's, John is walking back from the ER to the west wing when he sees Molly. He meets her eyes in the hallway then looks away, unable to return her gaze. He can't even speak as they pass by each other.
"If I do this, you'll show me?" he asks, hating how much his voice wavers with indecision. He's vaguely aware of the odd sensation that she has him wrapped around her little finger, but dismisses it as unimportant.
“I suppose you could try,” he remarks absently, flipping through the mail, “not that it’d be any use at this point, seeing that he’s going into REM.”
SHERLOCK: WHATEVER GAVE YOU THAT IMPRESSION? THERE'S NOTHING PATHOLOGICAL ABOUT IT.
It takes every ounce of control he has to keep his face from betraying the dark, simmering anger the words elicit, or what's worse, the nagging fears that she might be right. While it's not something he likes to admit, he's losing traction, his footholds slipping, scrambling to hang on to the way they were before.
He hears those haunting words over and over in his head that evening. You should let him go, John. The way she'd said it with such plain, factual conviction gave John the feeling he ought to listen to her. But he can't. He tries to sleep and gives up at some point past 4 in the morning.
“Mr. Holmes you have to help me,” he says gripping John’s arm. “I'll tell you where the bodies are- all of them.”
Does he even have a phone?
“Wait, Sherlock—” John stammers as the brunet excuses himself and heads toward the bedroom. “Where do you think you’re going?” He asks, peaking around the corner of the hallway Sherlock vanished into, “Whatever’s happened to your back you can’t fix it by yourself.”
, and John has no idea whether that makes it more or less unnerving.
John looks at him, startled.
” the voice seems to be trying to level with him, groping for the right verbiage.
"And stay away from Eurus, please, if you know what's good for you,” Mycroft pleads with him on his way out, “She is extremely dangerous."
“I need the full ballistics report on a case from 2011," Sherlock tells Greg when he picks up, "Fax it to me. I need to confirm something.”
“You two are officially an open gay couple in a CW TV show. Congrats. Sorry we had to skip past the wedding stuff, it wouldn't fit in the time bracket.”
They're watching the life cycle of the black widow on the nature channel, which involves the little-known practice of sexual cannibalism, wherein the female of the species eats the male following copulation as a sign of undying affection. The female has taken the male and is in the process of tearing off its head. Such betrayal is, naturally, the source of John's horror.

As he’s ascending the stairs, there are all kinds of alarms that should be sounding, telling him that it’s bad, that it’s dangerous, that he shouldn’t. But it’s pin drop silent. There’s only that old, dogged command from brain stem to foot, that tells him to take another step.

"Your DNA
“Is that what you tell yourself?” she asks in frustration, then immediately regrets it, “Sorry. I didn’t mean that.”
Sherlock: I know.
I'm saying we have to tell him."
JOHN: WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT?
11. DO YOU DISPLAY A LACK OF REMORSE OR GUILT?
John’s self-control cracks in that split second and he steps forward on impulse, reaching for her. “Mary—“
“She doesn’t know her mother,” John says tersely, stiffly.
Sherlock knows he should be racing out the door right now, he knows this with every crawling fibre of his being, but every time he so much as thinks of doing that, the doorknob inconveniently stops working.
"Tell me how you did it," he insists, locking eyes with her in the mirror.
Silence on the other end, it seems to be processing. “
Sherlock is getting the irksome, disgruntling feeling he's missed something. Confessions are meant to be like pulling teeth, not like giving away free donuts.
Sherlock seems unimpressed, like 'all the women' isn't that much of an achievement and doesn't do him full justice. He settles for "That's interesting coming from you." It takes John a minute to play catch up.
<<Sorry to pull you out of work, Doctor, but there was an incident at school today…>>
John: This is about the Listerine isn't it?
SHERLOCK: NO, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES.
“In any case, it's wonderful to see you again, Doctor," she smiles, "So glad you could make it.”
is to
“I’m an old friend,” he replies. Despite being seemingly benign, it triggers some uneasiness in Sherlock’s mind, although, at the moment he can’t remember why.
Correction. And then his phone rings.
“Father,” Sherlock supplies, his eyes softly, unfazedly alight with mirth as they return her scathing glare.
"Alright, this isn't working. Go back home, John."
Sherlock playfully shoots him a half-lidded gaze that wishes to know why-ever-not.
When John does not answer, his lips curve upward with mischief. He smirks and asks, tilting his head as if genuinely curious, "Am I seducing you too?" which if there was any question, is his intention, clearly.
He glances sidelong at John, playing a sinister vibrato note. “Open heart surgery.” The note wears on.
Mary looks confused at what sounds like some vague riddle he’s concocted, and Sherlock sees the need to elaborate, as inarticulate as he may be on the subject.
Sherlock gives her a doleful look.
By the time they get back to the flat, he still hasn't typed a word. For ten, twenty minutes he stares at the screen, not knowing what to write. John raises an eyebrow at his apparent fixation with the screen and asks him if he's alright, at which point Sherlock seems to finally realize he exists.
He’s about to say something stupid and Sherlock catches him. “John
Donovan eyes Sherlock. "I don't know if I like leaving you alone with him, sir-"
“What’s the matter, Watson?” he asks, “Didn’t look where you were going?” And they giggle at that too.
"Everything is a competition to you," she says, moving her queen to the side. She seems to be not be entirely engaged in the game, giving off the impression she's not actually trying to win, which is, in itself, puzzling. Though she takes some small pleasure in taking his knight. "A challenge to see who's smarter and you don't like to be bested."
“Sherlock..” John voices weakly, and Sherlock’s silhouette scatters in the buildup of water in his eyes. He can't go over now, not with Sherlock's image standing in the way like roadkill.
John turns toward the corridor she indicated and steels himself. The moment he sees his face he's going to kill him. It's decided.
"A copy cat?"
“Only been married a week and we’re already keeping secrets?” John arches an eyebrow as she enters, undoing her gloves.
“Is this a recording?” he asks off-hand, tilting his head into the reciever.
John stares, elbows resting against the table, rubbing the fingers of his left hand together.
“We’re filming a few sequences here, but we’ll be filming mostly in Toronto, alright? Sign and date?” Stephanie clicks the pen and hands him a 2 year contract. Benedict backs off like its on fire.
"Waltz."
She can read the thoughts on his face, his lips mouthing the words but nothing comes out.
Sherlock pauses, curious.
-cat in the engine look goes to sherlock
"Mycroft thinks he can get me to do what he wants by holding the violin hostage," he admits ruefully. Oh my god. Brothers.
John ultimately finds himself on the pavement again back at square one.
John is flipping through cosmopolitan magazine in the ER waiting room. His five year old daughter is seated beside him, looking more worried than he does.
“Suffer in silence. So they won’t hear,” John listens to Sherlock say. Sherlock is staring at him intently, eyes intense, compelling, geared to persuade.
Sherlock: Yeah alright.
Mary and Sherlock exchange looks.
"I was worried she would try to dispose of the body," he says as an aside, then goes on to explain, "When Sherlock died, we took him here. This is a cryogenics laboratory owned by the government for national security purposes."
“Well!” she huffs at him as he’s bolting out the door.
,” John quips immediately in response, annoyed by the speedy deduction, finger hesitating over the buzzer while he turns to Sherlock, “It’s my
There are those last few steps. The counting down of the seconds.
But he did say them, didn't he?
"No, I don't know what you're talking about and alas, I've lost all interest. As far as I'm concerned the only problem is
Sherlock: Of his Listerine usage?
“Go ahead. Take it. It’s a get out of jail free card,” John urges him with a shrug, trying to resolve any extraneous feelings of obligation, “Never look back.”
“Please,” he says, all redundancy, sounding nothing short of traumatized.
the award for best
“Enough of that. I’ve had it with your delusions and paranoia and pleas of insanity. You actually almost killed yourself, do you know that?” Sherlock snaps, sounding like a CO, even paternal. The anger in his voice seems to get through to John.
. I've fallen in your eyes- so you go running to my brother. Is that how it goes?" The splitting pain in his voice, and what’s worse, the hateful the way he displaces it all with a cool casual drawl, is unconscionable.
That does it. John grips him by the collar and pulls him downward so that they are face to face, practically vibrating with anger. He has half a mind to lock Sherlock up in an ivory tower somewhere where he will never see the light of day if that's what it takes to stop him from putting himself in danger for stupid reasons.
"Whatever you have to say today I don't want to hear it-" she says, brushing past him. It's as he sees her go that the guilt flares up in his chest and he feels compelled to apologize. "Molly, wait-" he says, grabbing her arm.
“No?”
“Sherlock, you have to eat something.”
“Yeah, that you’re both stupid.”
"Legally dead is not usually a good prognosis."
He sits down, indicating they have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement.
“You would know, wouldn’t you?” John says as he wavers over the brink, wind breaking against him, no less bold nor sassy even in the face of death.
” the voice remarks in honest surprise. If only it were surprising. If only he were infallible- no perfect pressure point, no fatal Achilles heel. But judging by the appearance of the sheer dropoff where his toes end, it’s not the case is it?
"After all, he only loves you because you outsmart your opponents. If you can't do that then, well, what are you?" His hands clench helplessly at his sides and her eyes flick immediately to the gesture. Then he becomes aware she's keeping track of all his tells, the tension of his shoulders, the defensive set of his jaw. Her gaze is trailing over him in appraisal, searching for any hint of vulnerability, like a shark sniffing for blood in the water. "Now that you've lost your luster, I wouldn't be surprised if his infatuation with you came to a screeching halt."
“Give him a break, ok?” she gleams at him, and John complies and gives her a kiss, distracting her for a moment while Sherlock falls apart, briefly losing control, unable to keep the pleasure from culminating on his face. John and Mary come back into focus a split second after, a open, loving couple in bliss. The most confused feeling of ecstasy and mortification washes over him as John kisses her with his hand still on him. John withdraws from the kiss, and his wet hand relinquishes him beneath the table cloth.
“Do I look like an idiot to you?” Sherlock asks back, pointing at himself, “If John finds out about this
Greg wedges the handset in the crook of his neck and keys in his login credentials into the criminal records database. After clicking around for a few minutes Greg says, “You wanted homicide case seven-eight-three-four?”
SHERLOCK: NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
“Unless you want the person you love the most to suffer like you are, unless you want to put that on them—” Sherlock warns him, kneeling down to eye level.
“Oh,” he remarks with carefree nonchalance, like he’d casually forgotten about their alleged matrimony, but considers it forgivable because it wasn’t really that important anyway, “I think there was a long conversation about tax evasion or something. John must’ve seen things my way.”
"You left your lipstick at the crime scene," he informs her, revealing the smear of pigment on his fingers. "You appropriated his MO and killed 7 men, that is, within the borough of London, outside the numbers escalate. Your intent was to psychologically derail, torture, and literally scare the man to death by leaving bodies everywhere he went-- which to your credit, might have actually worked..." he says, vaguely impressed, "Your motives for this are less clear. But I imagine your intent was to exact your revenge on him and the male sex as a whole for its crimes." The only flags on her record were a few dated infractions for child prostitution, which he suspects is probably where she developed such an extreme perspective on men.
John licks his lips, looking nervous.
And again.
close to where he needs to be touched, and then his tongue is there, only the tip at first, circling his opening with slow, deliberate pressure.
like to go upstairs?"
Sherlock feels dizzy, but nods and pushes himself up into a sitting position.
"Sshhh," John says, bumping his forehead against his collarbone. "Stop. Please."
He leans forward and caresses the underside of my penis with his bottom lip in one long, tantalising, barely-there stroke. It’s teasing, torturous
Soon. No more pain for Sherlock. No more fear for John.
“Me too.”
Sherlock---
“Wh---” he starts, but Sherlock interrupts him before he can ask.
John clasps his left hand in his right to hide the tremor (it always gets worse when he's upset) and nods.
John says it will get better. Easier.
I smirk.
"It's not okay," John mutters, and Sherlock shakes his head against the memories, but then forgets everything around himself when John twists in his chair and slings his arms around his hips.

Sherlock has gone very, very quiet.
Faster,
I grab my t-shirt from where it’s lying on the floor behind me and wipe my hands with it, and then I dab it against his cock to clean at least some of the come off his skin. He shivers and purrs deep inside his chest.
“God, I wish your back had already healed…”
It's the one word, the one name, that has been keeping him grounded for the last two years. Attached to the one person who's ever managed to peel away the layers and layers of cold, hard arrogance, to dismantle the walls he'd built around his ego bit by incessant bit, and Sherlock had allowed him to, just like that. He'd
"God,
And he's sad.
“Well, stop being ridiculous, and put on your coat,” Rosie demands. “We mustn’t be late.”
Sherlock lets him slide from his mouth and gives him a crooked smile. He’s panting ever so slightly.
The straightforward question surprises me, but I want to tell him the truth.
He steps right in front of me then, so close that I have to crane my neck to be able to properly see his face. We’re not touching, but I can feel the heat radiating off his body.
We do that for about a minute, our breathing slowing down in the process, our bodies relaxing into the sparkly warmth of satisfaction that follows amazing sex, and then I stop moving and gently pull out of him. He slumps forwards and against the mattress, boneless and limp.
He moans again when I squeeze his buttocks and then push at his hip to get him to turn back around to face me.
One corner of his mouth twitches in what I take to be a small, grateful smile.
"Hm?"
"It's alright. I'm fine."
My mind is reeling, trying to catch up with what I'm hearing, but I'm not fully there yet.
“Oh, I could get lost in you… listening to you,
Rosie’s teacher wanders over into to the newly-formed crowd of children. “Friends, let’s allow Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson to settle in and take a seat, shall we? There will be plenty of time for questions later!”
"All I ever do is think," he murmurs, and he looks so small and crestfallen that John wants to throw himself at him and hug him, shower him with love, show him that he's perfect just the way he is.
“John.
From the way the lovers behave around each other, Sherlock deduces that they can't have been involved for longer than a few months – half a year at most. He himself doesn't have any experience when it comes to personal relationships of this kind, but he's sure that such a short time together can't offer enough grounds on which to build a happy marriage. It simply
He looked so beautiful, and so sad, and it brought to the surface emotions I had once, right at the very beginning of our acquaintance, discovered within myself and then, out of fear and cowardice, never allowed myself to acknowledge for what they really were. Right then, staring at the raindrops painting glistening trails onto his cheeks, it all came back to me, and I hoped he would not notice what must have been written all over my face.
“We…” he starts, but then does not finish his sentence.
“I love--- all of this,” he answers and clears his throat. “Sorry. I’m lost for words.”
"Is there any chicken curry left?"
He removes his hand from John's lips to stroke it along his jaw instead, and it's a gesture so tender, so out of place amidst all their combined moaning and panting and their sweaty, exhausted chasing after John's climax that it sends him right over the edge.
He shudders violently and moans, the sound of his deep, throaty voice vibrating inside my head, and then his lower body jerks forwards and he comes, spilling himself into the space between us and drenching me in warm, wet heat. At the same time, I feel him convulse around my finger, and the two sensations combined are so wonderful that they send me over the edge right after him.
John chuckles, hoping the emotions he's experiencing right now are shining through. Sherlock trusts him, and he's determined not to disappoint him. He is a treasure, the most important thing in the universe. He'll cherish him forever.
the one who has to look into your eyes and see exactly what you're thinking."
He resumes his work, despite the fact that Greg looks vaguely horrified by him.
"And it's torture worse than anything she could do," he continues with dark, rueful shadows hanging over him. He steps back under the overhead lights, casting light on his tormented features. His eyes are burning like molten iron, and John has a very weak understanding of why so little of his rage is directed at
Sure enough he is. The creature is posed on one of the mid-distant rocks, presiding over his actions with a sort of majestic nonchalance, arms leaning against basalt rock. Its tail is so long it curves over the edge of the platform and thumps idly against the side slope, mixing the water. John glances for a moment, then shakes his head, peeved with his treacherous brain. Gathering up the fragments of his crazed and delirious mind, he executively reverts his eyes to the task at hand and resolves to mind his own.
“well, he—“ Sherlock starts, then realizes it’s surprisingly not a question he has an immediate answer to. ”Hm…” he hums in thought.
"Because I'm terrified of losing you," he snaps. The words sort of tumble out, unintended, and he realizes his mistake too late, immediately regretting blurting that out. John blinks at him in surprise for a moment, then a sad, half-hearted smile tugs at the edge of his mouth.
He wonders what he was thinking coming here, why he's doing this to himself. Then he realizes he can't bring himself to leave, either. He literally can't pull his eyes away from his pale, phantom-like form, laid out the a stretcher like he's in a casket.
John swiftly parses out and disposes of most of the tissue collection, relocating some of the salvageable specimens to the fridge. He cleans the knife under the faucet, wipes it dry with unerring deftness, and shunts the blade into its holster in the knife set. He grips the handle of the lackluster kettle situated on the stove, divests its contents into the sink, sets it on the base of the basin, and flips the tap. As he sets his hands against the counter, scalding hot water rushes into the kettle at a streamline pace, hissing softly.
“Darling, I can’t,” he says awkwardly, side-stepping around her.
, as he’s called, that are worthy of acknowledgement.
"What does that say? O.S.?"
Her steely eyes shift gracefully over to Sherlock, harboring a contained look like that of a provoked rattlesnake. “And you brought your..”
“Lets get this over with,” she decides, eyes thinning as her lips tighten into a smile, “shall we?”
"What are you getting at?" he asks his gaze narrow, crystal-blue, serpentine curls of dark fringe magnifying the sharpness of his features.
SHERLOCK: NO.
“Hm.”
“Yeah, why not? It’s pretty,” Mary decides, admiring its classic shade of white-gold, and giving the hem a twirl.
"Do you normally frequent the men's restroom or is this a passing fancy?" he says, looking over his shoulder. He can feel her eyes all over him, ghosting down his back. He rolls his eyes, thankful he's not been infected by the influenza called lust that turns people into salivating animals.
“–Hello?” he says, taking his phone out as he exits, but pauses momentarily in the doorframe when he sees the bizarre look on Nigel’s face. His eyebrows creasing perplexedly in response, android pressed to his ear.
For what it's worth, John greatly disapproves of how he's taken to mock flirting as a source of amusement. John's mouth goes through a couple iterations of opening and closing, unable to find a proper comeback for that. Sherlock gives him a parting smile smugger than a marshmallow on chocolate and closes the door behind him, after which John casts the mail aside and retreats to the sofa to nurse the strange discomfort that's taken lodge in his chest.
Greg remembering this singular event was his last hope; he can’t connect the cases with hard evidence if one of the cases is missing, or according to new Scotland yard, doesn’t even exist.
A growl rumbles from the creature’s throat as the human takes a few steps toward him, toes kissing the waves. The creature’s shoulders rise with tension and his fingers claw the sand.
Its face is a slate wiped blank: indecipherable, unperturbable, paralyzing—its head cocked in a way that makes him swallow dryly. It's like a cross between a runway model and the
"I really think it can,” Nigel insists.
She didn't call him a freak but it's what she's thinking, along with the fleeting thought that the juxtaposition of his weirdness with his pretty face is very odd to behold. He holds himself in check, despite the fact that she's leering at him the way a wolf looks at meat (he's not sure whether it classifies as lust, cannibalism, or something in between).
“Yeah,” John offers a sympathetic smile and fills out the rest of the paper slip, “I’m going to put you on pain killers and we’ll set you up with a sling.”
Always so curious, even if it's about something as stupid as this, he thinks, looking at the doctor, to his disbelief, with a longing way about him.
John glares balefully at the fridge, an innocent bystander nonetheless. “I ought to do him in,” he growls with a weary, strained inflection of voice that betrays nuisance to the point of suffering. He cracks open the fridge and fetches the milk. “
"Wait," he says, as her hand starts to stray downward toward his belt. His hand grips hers, temporarily waylaid.
John is taken aback, seeing that this seemingly harmless, elderly man on his knees is actually one of London’s most wanted. Even so, he’s disinclined to rescind his assistance and leave the suffering man to his fate-- technically, his profession requires that he abstain from making character judgments.
When he sets foot on Sherrinford after a miserable clipper ride to the island that drenches him head to foot, it's the usual beastly, tempestuous weather, with flailing birches and flooding shores. When he arrives at the main entrance, locked doors bar him from entering and no one comes to open them. Eventually he discovers his government clearance also affords him limited access to the asylum and keys himself in.
"It could've been an accident," Rse says, "Just because he died doesn't mean he wasn't a sociopath."
"We don't have to report anything," Sherlock replies curtly, dismissing the idea outright.
His recovery is quick and the touch seemingly harmless, but it appears it was just an experimental touch. It comes back around his leg and a spark of shock runs up his spine. He flinches violently with a splash, before it’s dragging him down again, several feet.
John moves him to settee and is about to undo his collar when Sherlock does something that makes him stop short. He flinches from John's touch. John freezes.
“Not in the mood?” she asks and John actually smiles at the silliness of the question.
"I don't eat while I'm on a case," he smirks, handing her her own case file.
SHERLOCK: NOT SURPRISED.
“Oh, shove off!” He grouches tetchily, warring with a full-on grin that’s threatening to break out on his face. He plants a hand on the head of curls in an effort to push the obscenity face-planted on his chest
“Oh, I calculate he’ll come. He’s wrestling with the fact he’s not the love of your life. He’ll get over it,” Sherlock replies, all nonchalance.
Mary notices the mounting danger in John’s eyes and intervenes. “Alright! Alright, I believe you,” Mary steps in between the two of them, looking amused. “No violence. Violence is bad,” she tells the father more prone to violence, keeping him back with a hand.
“No,” John has him laughing nervously, “No, you’re very mixed up John—“
“Likewise.”
As he's washing his hands under the running water her hands wrap around his waist from behind. The gesture elicits a huff of surprise from him, even though he should have seen it coming a mile away- a testament to the state of distraction he's in.
"And here I thought I'd never see the day you actually said yes," her sultry voice sounds from behind him, interrupting his thoughts. She sits down across from him with not an ounce of suspicion or concern. "I had half a mind you wouldn't show," she admits, looking pleasantly surprised to see him.
"Damn it, Sherlock, I love you," he finally says without thinking. That seems to pour gasoline on the fire.
"Come on, what was he doing when you left? He was up to no good am I right?" Sally tsks. John doesn't really know how to respond to that. Teaching him about the vices of spider sex probably classifies as not good.
"What's this?" she asks, flipping through the series of crime scene reports and photographs, which detail nothing short of a bloody massacre.
” such a distraught, passionate voice. In some perverse way, it almost makes sense to go and kill yourself over something that beautiful.
Omg you can't be helped.
“Tea?” he asks, leaning on his hand, absently outstretched toward the blonde.
"Right, so this is you just... figuring out how?" John asks, so stunned he's almost amused. Leave the man alone with a piano for five minutes and
“You want to play chess,” he clarifies to see if he understood her right. “With me,” he indicates himself, the
He's borderline incredulous he could be so easily off-set by a single touch.
“You know what I mean. Why can’t they know that you like us, or in particular him?”
“And I’m not,” John scoffs.
"He probably just cross contaminated the samples," Anderson shrugs, waving it off.
"You’re not actually afraid he’ll catch on?” The words come unwittingly and without warning, producing an air of astonished silence. Sherlock’s face betrays no expression, staring at Mary intently while his mind whirs in the background. Mary catches a hint of something that suggests he’s trying not to laugh, which grows increasingly obvious, until his lips begin to crack into a faint but devilish smile.
John is trembling with rage. "Sherlock!" he yells in a way that commands him to turn back around him and answer to him.
, I—“
"On the contrary. I adore men. You are so fun to play with. It's fun to watch you think you're in control." She watches his reaction, cataloguing how he becomes nervous beneath the facade of his- the slight temperature rise of his skin, his subconscious picking up on the threat of danger in awkward, fleeting sensations he can't categorize. Criminals had always been to him what prey was to a predator, but now he's not entirely sure who is which. "But you don't actually want to be in control, do you?" she points out, lips against his ear. He turns to her sharply, the confusion legible on his face. He meets her eyes, searching them for her meaning. "Don't look so alarmed," she laughs. The patronization in her every gesture, remark, her very presence seems tactically designed to make him feel awkward and out of sorts.
"Sir, we need you to calm down," the resident says. John tries to force his way past but to no avail, making an over-large scene.
As he,              by necessity,                comes closer,
A few seconds elapse before she resigns in defeat. “I think we need to have a talk about sex,” she says.
When he does, he bolts after her. "Wait-"
“God, dad!” she exhales in sheer frustration, taking her fingers out of her hair.
"No- no, I've got it," he says kneeling down to retrieve the mincing knife.
“I had an
even look at me."
“Sherlock, what are you doing here?” she asks as she approaches the wire-mesh fence. He looks trim and dapper and horribly misplaced.
JOHN: I LIKE TO THINK THAT I’M
Sherlock turns away and disappears up the stairs, abandoning John in the threshold where a few gloomy rays of light leak into the dark corridor. John covers his mouth, feeling sick to his stomach, and sinks to his knees, trying to breathe and resist the counterproductive urge to scream.
"Sherlock-" John starts, his voice wavering uncertainly. He knows he has tread cautiously but he can’t even seem to find the words.
“Subconsciously want to kiss someone? Seriously? Because of the Listerine?" he presents the question again, taking apart his logic with a sort of derisive rhetoricalness, "Are you listening to yourself, Sherlock? How on earth do you get that from
“What?” he turns to her again, releasing the instrument from his chin.
“Ok, what’s the deal?” John deflates, trying a straight forward approach, “It can’t be that bad.”
"Sherlock-" he breathes hesitantly in disapproval, unable to shake these perplexing, deep-set anxieties he's at a loss to explain but can't really place. His hand tightens on his sleeve. “It’s not just that, it’s- you’re..“
“With so much reluctance, it can only be one thing."
SHERLOCK: I GET IN MORE TROUBLE NOW.
" John nearly jumps out of his skin. Sherlock makes no motion on his part, staring wordlessly at some fixed point in space. "What are you doing sitting around in the dark?" John asks, once he's fully recovered from the initial scare Sherlock has given him. Sherlock seems to have managed to sit so miraculously still and motionless so as to evade even John's notice, who by default is always wary of his surroundings sometimes even to a paranoid extent, particularly in the dark.
"It's silly of you to think that being a man changes anything," she says, like he's been terribly foolish, "You and I both know what you really are, behind all the posturing and keeping up appearances."
John feebly scrambles upward, at least what he thinks is upward, the dearth of oxygen in his chest growing. He doesn’t know how far up he needs to swim or if he can make it, and the fact that the monster is likely circling him doesn't exactly ease the increasing sense of desperation.
“How did you do it?” he asks.
“Aren’t you going to miss me?”
Something in John snaps at the way Sherlock looking at her, listless and resigned to being hers. It’s something willful and rageful and suddenly, irrefutably
He finds him reaching into his dresser to grab a new shirt and stops him from rummaging nonsensically through his collection of Dolce et Gabbana.
"That's good right? That means you know who did it?"
“Good job,” he says fondly and gives her a kiss on the forehead, cupping her head with his hand.
“Denial?” John asks, he checks the time on his phone, and gets sidetracked into the living room looking for his workbag, “What are you talking about?"
“I’m not really supposed to be here,” Mary mutters distractedly, panning her gaze over the room.
John, And only one jar—" the voice is annoyed, exasperated, and a bit hysteric, "
“Look at me,” he demands, turning John face so their eyes align, “Can’t you recognize me, of all people?”
"Don't thank me!" he breathes, aghast, as if John has somehow offended him. Sherlock rids John's hand from his sleeve before John can even approach, in a motion so rapid he could swipe the tablecloth from beneath a set of crystal dining ware without displacing anything. John's fingers almost sting of rug burn.
"And when he was left with no alternative he got between you and that gun-"
“As that would defeat the purpose of all of this keeping you alive business,” John tails on ironically.
short chap better than no chap am I rite?
, to anyone in the room, but John. Not to Sherlock, who looks perfectly content in the present, and not to Mary, who’s convinced of the guise that he’s fulfilling his paternal duty, but it certainly hits John— seeing the decades connect in front of his eyes, the way he’s dancing with her, the spitting image of the way he danced with him, it hits him like a freight train with the weight of all those years. It’s not happenstance, not a coincidence, and certainly not by accident, that in the aftermath he’s still there, retracing the footsteps he made decades apart.
“A bit. Yeah,” he admits, give or take.
John studies his reflection but all he sees is a man who would be drunk if he wasn’t so pissed off. He chuckles at how transparently his bitterness shows, from the slight touch of discord at every clean-pressed edge, to the subliminal colouring of every line of inner trim. He takes off his jacket and sets it on a chair.
The doctor is looking at him with a stunned silence as though he's worried he's inadvertently caused some sort of glitch in his machinery. Sherlock drops his hand from where it's raised in the air, looking irked. His dagger sharp eyes leer at John. The silence rings so loudly in the absence of his voice, vibrating like a string. "For god's sake, don't make me spell it out for you.
He remembers the thrill of a shiver when those long, human-like fingers had closed around him, the dismal, nightmarish canvas of cold blue tones with bubbles that trail upward, the memory of salt burning against his eyes, but he shakes it off as a fantasy. Certainly he would be dead, if that game of life or death had been anything more than a dream.
John grimaces, eyes closed, brain hurting. He cocks his head to the side against the tension in his neck, and rests his head wearily against his fingers. “Sherlock you really should've thought of this
“No, seven-eight-three-
“Sherlock—” His voice sounds squeezed. He’s breathing rapid again, vexed, shallow, short, little breaths.
“Spare me your concern. I have champagne,” he replies blandly, holding the glass he's swiped off the mantle near eye-level. Then he brushes past his brunet counterpart, treading over to the assortment of wines to fill it.
