“No, no, it’s...” Steve takes in a breath. “Where I grew up, it was, uh. Real traditional, let’s say. My soulmate and I don’t-... I know that our soulmates are supposed to be chosen by God, but I. He’s, uh, he’s quite liberal. So I messed up, when I met him. I did some things that I didn’t realise were hurtful to him. Because of my upbringing. And now no matter what I do, I feel like I do it wrong. I’m always upsetting him. And I don’t mean to! That’s the last thing I want to do, but I just can’t seem to get anything right. And I-“ Steve swallows, rallies his courage. “I ache for him. I...that’s probably been my biggest sin all year. I...my job requires me to hurt people. I’m not- I mean, I work for…I’m a soldier. I kill people, even, sometimes, although of course I try not to, but. But the...” Steve blushes. “Lust. Definitely, definitely lust. More times than I can count or quantify.”
His eyes flash a warm, spring green, enough to make Tony suddenly very glad that he made the choice that he did. He sits back on his heels as Loki comes to sit on the edge of the bed, close enough that Tony can tell he wasn’t lying. There’s no coolness where his body comes close to Tony’s knee, no wafting scent of alien forests in snow. The bed doesn’t dip under his significant weight.
“Is that what I’m doing?” Tony asks, terror creeping over him in a prickling wave. “Oh, god, I couldn’t even manage one relationship with one of my best and oldest friends. And I was
Steve goes to rest his head against the wall, but all that does is put his head through and into the shower. For a moment, he pauses there: halfway between rooms, his disembodied form floating between. Tony grunts, low, and Steve takes a quick two steps into the shower. He sits down on the tile, puts his face between his knees.
With all of the new players appearing, there wasn’t always much to do for The Avengers. Petty crime was a little below their paygrade, and that wasn’t just Tony being a snob. The fallout from any Avengers battle was massive just due to sheer firepower, and it seemed like a little much to break out the big guns for a mugging or a gang problem. Besides, Tony has an eye on things. He can see the moving parts, the way that Hell’s Kitchen has suddenly become a mecca for hipster heroes, or Reed Richards suddenly being made of rubber, or even that punk dressed up like a spider in Queens. The landscape is changing, and the Avengers are just an admittedly big piece of a bigger puzzle.
“Don’t worry, I ran into some friendlies. I’m all healed up.” He glances over at Minoru, who has the grace to shrug sheepishly. “By some definitions, anyway.”
Y E S, Steve taps, because the faltering expression on Tony’s face is too much for him to bear. W E W E R E
“Gone. They’re all gone, no sign of them.” Rhodey huffs. “Flashy and green teleported them all out. You know we can’t trace that.”
“I will,” Steve said, and pushed himself to standing. He brushed the dirt off of his knees. “Thanks, everyone. For everything. This week, and the last. I’ve been a mess, and you’ve all been great.”
Tony is supposed to deliver the eulogy again. Steve isn’t sure whose harebrained idea that was. Probably Tony’s. The man never did learn how to give himself a break.
Steve’s arms were up before he even consciously processed the request, hands slipping around Tony’s shoulders to crush them together. He pressed his face into Tony’s neck, mouthing at his alpha’s bondmark, and Tony groaned so forcefully Steve almost wondered if he’d hurt him. Tony leaned back and turned his head blindly, catching Steve’s mouth in a bruising kiss, and Steve melted into him, moaning. Tony’s hands slipped down his back, fingers questing for the dip above his arse, the dimples there that he loved so much. He fit his fingertips to the hollow in Steve’s spine, tracing a back-arching line of heat up to the nape of his neck, fingers clenching in Steve’s hair as Tony took his mouth. His tongue pressed inside: measured, claiming, hungry. He sucked Steve’s lower lip into his mouth, dragging his teeth over it so slow and sharp that it felt like he’d found a direct line to Steve’s cock.
. He’d lost years, because some masked, enhanced assailants had appeared and attacked him and Cap while they were trying to run off a drug dealer outside the centre.
Hulk grumbles. “Hulk not smart. Not good talk. Star Man ask Banner why fight.” He turns and frowns down at Steve, his wide brow wrinkling like thick leather. “Ask.”
Tony whirls on him, eyes flashing. "I am, Steve. He had nothing to keep him from giving in, and I had everything. I had people who loved me, a global empire to return to as a conquering hero." His bitter smile is full of shrapnel. Steve aches with it. "He discovered his great betrayal before the fall, not after. I remember-...it doesn't matter."
Steve had done a lot of reading, but he hadn’t been able to figure out if Tony’s birth nature was omega or beta. It didn’t matter, not really, but he couldn’t help but be a little curious. There had never been a confirmed record of an omega-omega bond in all of history. There were rumours, of course, and some who felt that such things had been supressed by a sexist society. If Tony’s birth nature was omega, then he might have no hope of ever bonding to Steve. And if he bit Steve and it didn’t take, then what? What was he planning to say? Was he planning to come out if he was forced into it?
“Am I not disgustingly assured for a poor kid from the tenements dating a suave, gorgeous, super-genius, multi-billionaire?” Steve asked, biting playfully at Tony’s ear. He was rewarded with a quiet gasp, Tony’s hands clenching deliciously in his hair. “It’s just a fun raffle, a thank you for all the employees who put up with working in the tower after we made it a target for every supervillain in the nine realms. Just this month, nearly half of the building was magically lulled to sleep.”
“Hey,” he said, quietly, and Rogers blinked sleepy blue eyes open at him, smiling easily. “Can you eat a bit of this for me?”
Tony lets out a rough hiss of breath, pulling his fingers out and slicking himself up. Steve watches him with dark eyes, quietly ravenous, and Tony spares him a single kiss to his jaw before he presses inside.
Tony whimpers. He’ll cop to it. He totally, 100% whimpers at the way Steve sounds half-drunk just talking about how hot his reactions to being blown halfway up a wall were.
Tony rolls to the right as something slices through the space he’d been occupying only seconds before. “What the fuck is that?”
Steve takes a breath, turning it over in his head. “I guess I’d just like to think that everyone would do the right thing, when presented with it.”
[SPOILERS] Tony doesn't know if Steve is real/if Steve is really Steve. Desperate and a little high, he kind of joking but not really invites Steve to stay, then jacks off while imagining Steve is there. Steve, of course, is there, and has a ~~moment of weakness~~ (aka totally jumps him.) Tony is on board with it in the moment but has a Big Emotional Time afterwards. This is not about the sex, but about the fact that he thinks he's literally going crazy. However it is a potentially triggering sex scene. If you need to skip it, it'll be pretty heckin' clear when it stars. You can control/command + F for the sentence "Fuck, I’m going crazy." to skip.
“Yes, it’s unfortunate that Captain Rogers had to miss this meeting,” Senator Cochran says, eyeing Tony with a wry twist to his mouth. Tony smiles blithely at him.
“Perhaps he’s afraid of hurting you with his enhanced strength. Perhaps he’s a traditionalist, and only wants to have sex after bonding. Perhaps he's inexperienced and is worried about his performance with an experienced lover such as yourself. We can’t know unless you ask him.”
Tony huffs and takes a long drag of his coffee, draining half the liquid in one go. “You don’t trust me?”
Tony scrapes his teeth over the skin, grinning when Steve lets out a choked-off moan at the feel of it. He presses wet kisses across Steve’s chest, running his hands over all that smooth, firm muscle. His fingertips trace the lines of Steve’s abdomen, the cut of his hips, up his arms and over his grasping fingers. It’s not as much sexy as it is claiming, but he can’t stop touching Steve. He’s warm and sweet under him, tilting his head back, exposing his throat, and that’s just an invitation Tony can’t ignore.
“Sorry, what? Can’t hear you. I’m too tired after a brutal heat where my soulmate, who is supposed to at the very least want to jump my bones and stuff me full of incredibly well-proportioned babies, fucked off to evacuate refugees from Chad or wherever the fuck he is.”
“Yeah,” Tony says nonsensically, pulling out and adding a second one. He slips them back into Steve’s body, aiming for Steve’s sweet spot, and grins when Steve gasps and tries to bury his face in his arm. “No, I want to see your face.”
He picks up the coffee, toasts her with it, then swallows it down piping hot. Natasha waits, barely even blinking.
“I can imagine,” Steve says. He shrugs. “Well, think on it. One of the issues Tony and I came up against was the idea of incorporating new players into an established team, but we’ve fought together.” Steve holds up a hand to forestall Logan’s rebuttal. “I know, I know you don’t remember. But I do. It’ll make my job easier, as field commander.”
“You shouldn’t be drinking this,” Natasha says, frowning at Clint with her eyebrows. It’s a skill he hasn’t quite perfected, despite Tony’s valiant attempts and impassioned attestations to the power of his ‘judgy face.’
Pepper clears her throat, and Tony grins at her. Loki eyes them, then swallows the oyster with a hilarious expression, wide eyed and caught between disgust and something else.
“There’s nothing you can do, Reed,” Tony says tiredly. He offers his old friend a small, genuine smile. “But thank you, for coming.”
Pepper sighs, and Tony can hear her begin to move again, murmuring something to someone before putting the phone back to her ear. “He wouldn’t want you to go in guns blazing, and you know it. You’re not just sitting there. You’re strategizing.” She clears her throat a little, voice prim. “You know he hates when you just rush in.”
But Steve has never been the kind to quit, no matter what it costs him. And the Buck in his dream had been right, in his own sick and twisted way. By some fluke of fate Steve had been given a second chance, another fiery brunette in red to tangle him up in knots all over again. No matter what Tony said, as long as he knew there was something there to hold onto, he wasn’t ready to give that up. He would never be ready. And if Tony doesn’t choose him in the end, well. He supposes that he’s survived worse.
“No, it is I who should apologise,” JARVIS says. He sounds frustrated, which makes Tony’s chest ache all over again. “You wish him to…appreciate you in this form for the sake of it, and not simply endure it because he loves you. Because you are aroused by it. And you think he will find your desires repulsive. Is that correct?”
Steve put the little bottle back into its canister, then replaced everything exactly as he’d found it in the cabinet. He checked the objects against the photo in his phone, just to be sure, then deleted the photo. Natasha had taught him about making stupid mistakes more than enough times.
“Let me guess, a student of Loki’s?” he asks. She looks startled, and Tony laughs. “Nail on the head.”
A shared drink at Casino had led to a hand of poker at the jailhouse, and then a friendly bout of wrestling on the ground of the jailhouse back office as a laughing Rogers accused Tony of hooking his chits. He’d demanded to check up Tony’s sleeves, and Tony had fought him, and then Rogers had been straddling him, bright and handsome in the lamplight, and Tony had been hard beneath the tempting V of Rogers’ legs.
Bruce doesn’t say anything. He’s watching Tony with the kind of tired pity that Tony hates, because it’s an expression people wear when they think that there’s no solution to a problem. There is always a solution. Always.
It hadn’t mattered, really. He’d had Peggy, and she was beautiful, and she’d never thought less of him for what he was. When he’d first met her, he was half-sure she must be an alpha with the way she’d taken down alphas three times her size. Peggy was dominant, and beautiful, and she took control of a room just by walking into it. She’d fought against every alpha who’d told her a beta female had no place doing what she was doing, and she carried herself like it. She’d been incredible, and more than Steve ever thought he’d have.
If Tony’s responding laugh is a little wet, well, he knows JARVIS wouldn’t judge him for it. He closes his eyes and leans back in the arm chair, tips his head back and just breathes. For a few minutes, he luxuriates in the comfortable silence. It’s so warm in the bathroom, certainly JARVIS’ doing. The fight against the outrider army had been exhausting beyond belief. Tony just wants to sleep.
“Well you’d best ask him, then,” the priest says. “And if you don’t get an answer that you can work with, ask again until you do. That’s the only way to make anyone happy, but especially your soulmate. You have to talk to him, find out what he needs. Maybe he’s quite modern and liberal and he doesn’t want to be bonded. You’ll have to accept that, and that might be hard for you. But it’s your duty to love and support your soulmate. That is the divine commandment of our Lord. It’s your task to find out how best to go about doing that.”
“No, I mean we,” Tony sighs. He gestures with his sandwich. “If we’re doing the talking about it like adults thing now, we both know you know about Loki. So.” He clears his throat. “There’s that. And we have the team to think about, and whatever the hell has been going on to cause all this fucking trouble for us, and the fallout from the mission-”
“Agent Barton has told me to inform you that he doesn’t have to be awake for that, and that you should just ‘dump’ the captain in bed next to him and be done with it.”
A soft hiss alerted him to the arrival of the armour, and he turned to see Tony standing in that damned flight suit of his. A wave of arousal washed over him at the sight of his alpha standing there in skin-tight black, but it was a passing desire. Tony winked at him, then took off at a run, vaulting the railing before Steve could even shout at him to be careful, to not be such a reckless posturing alpha. Steve screamed, more instinct than fear, but overlaid was the sound of Tony’s whooping laughter, the whine of the repulsors as the armour chased him as he fell.
Peter blinks, poleaxed. It’s a reaction that Steve is deeply grateful for, because he doesn’t know what else to do with his body, his hands, as he listens to the words coming out of Tony’s mouth: one nightmare after another, endless, like a magician’s colourful scarf. “Okay, aside from that horrifying two-sentence persuasive essay on why Title IX is an important piece of legislation-”
Pepper’s mouth twitches infinitesimally. “Did you really imply that he was your blue-balled sugar baby?” she asks, and Tony stifles the bout of mad laughter that threatens to escape. If he starts, he may never stop.
“Tony,” Steve murmurs, and Tony blinks himself back into the world rapidly, eyes struggling to focus. Steve’s voice is shaky, slightly overwhelmed. “Tony, I…”
The heat room was held off of the master bedroom, an addition that Tony had installed after he and Steve bonded. For their honeymoon had Tony taken him to Pachino, Sicily: a place where Tony had rare, happy memories of his mother. It was where her family had immigrated from in the 1890’s, at the height of the Italian mass immigration. Steve had thought it a bit of an indulgence, but when they’d gotten back to the penthouse, he’d found the guest room next door had been converted into a heat room, complete with a separate hermetically-sealed double-door hatch for safe item exchange, and a biometric lock keyed to Steve’s baseline pheromone signature.
“Next time, see if we can just unleash Hulk on them, kill two birds with one stone,” he tells JARVIS absently, fighting a little with the seam for one of the suit’s more important chest plates. “Tell Thor we’re presently stocked up on burgers and pineapples, and start a fresh pot o’ joe for him, yeah J?”
Sam smiles softly at him. He nudges him with an elbow. “What do you wanna do, now that you’ve got your body back?”
After the parade, the float gets parked in the Memorial Park below Avengers Tower, dedicated to all of the civilian lives lost in the battle against supervillains/alien invaders/vengeful gods/etcetera the world over. Tony had been firm about that when The Avengers had moved in. The SI Saint Patrick’s Day planning committee had been remarkably efficient at getting a small fair kind of thing going, fit as promised with educational information about the history of Irish American immigration and Irish American contributions to New York City. Some booths offer food, and the lawn is crawling with hyper-engaged children ready to pose for photos.
“What else can we do you for?” Tony adds. Steve moves to stand abreast with him, eyes slanting towards him with something cautious. He’s only wearing the top half of his battle armour, his bottom half decked in sweatpants. He looks oddly vulnerable, caught between Steve Rogers and Captain America, soft and dangerous all at once. At least he has the shield.
Steve raises his eyebrows at him, and manfully does not make the obvious joke. Tony stares at him, then rolls his eyes, rocking back on his heels. “Really, Steve?”
He can see the quinjet’s shrinking distance in the corner of his display as he speaks, shooting Loki’s hands as he tries to raise them. Loki hisses, then whispers something foul, and Tony lets out a shout as he begins to sink down into the ground. He shoots at Loki again, but Loki deflects it this time, so Tony shoots past him and hits Amora in the back of her pretty blonde head, knocking her into Barnes. Another shot hits him in the back from behind, rattling his teeth, and JARVIS flashes warnings about damage to the armour’s plating as he struggles to get up. The woman in white must have woken up.
Steve huffs into Tony’s neck. He drags in a shaky breath, then pulls away, bright-eyed and unashamed.
“Steve,” Tony said, reaching out a hand, but Steve couldn’t bear feeling the barrier between them again. He took a step back, then another, feeling as though he was tearing his skin from his frame with every step he took away from his alpha.
Steve rubs a hand over his face. He surveys the barrel warily. “Look, not that I don’t appreciate what you’re trying to do, because I know this is you trying to…help. But, you know I can’t-“
“Yes,” JARVIS says simply, and Steve nods, rubbing a hand over his mouth. “Sir demanded that you not be disturbed, considering the ordeal you’ve suffered. Clearly you needed the rest.”
“What’s wrong with me?” Tony repeats, turning to look at where Rogers is leaning over the metal table he’d been lying on with fear writ large across his face. He’s grown a beard, which is just. No. “What’s wrong with
His living quarters felt neglected when he took the elevator down. Maybe it was just his imagination, but he hadn’t slept in his bed in weeks, and when he pulled out the old Dell computer he’d bought on his own before moving into the tower, it took what felt like ages to boot up properly. He was probably being paranoid, but it seemed like a stupid mistake to do research on Tony’s personal medical information on one of the communal StarkPads. He had his own laptop, too, but he knew that Tony was always fiddling with it, adding one thing or another to make it better. Tony did that with all the StarkTech that the team left lying around, more habit than anything else. He’d be sitting at the table eating a bowl of cereal, and next thing Clint knew his phone was keyed to vibrate in a specific way that it would transmit through most objects more noticeably.
Steve arches like he’s been electrocuted, eyes wide and sightless. His mouth drops open on an unvoiced sound of pleasure. His eyes roll back into his head, and Tony just keeps going: slow and hard, back and forth.
The silence in the quinjet is deafening. Tony sits in the back, Bruce curled up at his feet in twitchy misery. He’s wrapped in a thick white blanket, and every so often he reaches a hand out and touches Tony’s shin, knuckles resting there a moment before he pulls away, anxious and unsure of his welcome. Tony puts a hand on Bruce’s head, just resting there as Bruce settles slowly. His body shifts into something a little less strung, a little more weary.
Steve politely averts his eyes. He follows them into the workshop bathroom, if only because the idea of being snapped against Tony while he’s wet and naked in the shower is. Well. It wouldn’t be right, is all.
“I hear you, alpha,” Steve whispered, pressing his forehead to the glass near Tony’s thigh. He wanted nothing more than for Tony to stroke his hair, to kiss him, to tell him this was going to be okay.
“Not for a while,” Rhodey replies. He’s thrown back by the might of a blast from Amora, her eyes wild with fury. The Winter Soldier is back up, shooting at his faceplate. “I got this.”
“I was so dirty, and it was our first time having each other. I was so embarrassed. I hadn’t washed. I hadn’t shaved-”
A slightly personal note about the content of Steve and Tony's reconciliatory conversation to follow. Feel free to ignore it if you so desire.
It was a strange juxtaposition to now, knowing mothers and old men he’d never met have mourned his passing. He’s read countless of his own eulogies. He’s woken up in a body he thought should be dead three times over more times than he knows, which is truly saying something. It isn’t like a good Catholic boy to take miracles for granted.
“Nah,” Clint says, and Tony drizzles a little more of Clint’s magic sauce over an apple layer before starting again. “Nat and I love each other, and I expect we always will. But she’s my best friend, you know?”
“You’re handling nothing. You’re being a bluenose yellow bastard, and you know it. It ain’t like you.” Bucky throws the towel back, catching him in the back of the head, and the razor slips against the pad of his thumb. Dull metal slices into the meat of him, and he pulls back, hissing and sucking at the cut. Fat drops of red curdle in the washing bowl, mixing pink in the cloudy water.
there was hunger there. He stepped forward, scenting, and Steve tamped viciously down on the sound that wanted to crawl out of his throat. “Like…lying in the grass in August. Living, growing things. The sweet, vanilla scent that comes off of crisp, freshly unrolled paper vellum.” He paced forward again, his face swimming a mere half-foot from Steve’s, closer. “A sweet New England summer wind, with that faint hint of ocean salt to it that makes you want to strip and dive straight into the nearest body of water. Sticky heat. God, you smell like long hours over a drafting table next to an open window in high summer.”
He can feel whatever it is that keeps him attached to Tony pulling. He resists it, mostly out of pique, but then something exciting happens. Tony stops in the middle of the gravestones. He rubs at his chest, a small furrow appearing between his brows.
“If I had offered this information a year ago, it would have destroyed the burgeoning bonds between us,” Natasha tells him, and Tony nods, because yeah. That’s true. “We trust each other, now. You can forgive me.”
By the time Steve staggers out of the bathroom and falls into bed, he’s ready to change his name and move to another state. Tony
Pepper is staring at him, bright eyes searching in her freckled face. She’s gone from defensive and stinging to open without Loki in the room, and now Tony can remember when they’d shared this space, when late dinners from restaurants that only do carry away for Tony Stark were a norm for two brilliant people with busy schedules who can’t cook to save their lives. She looks scared, which isn’t anything new to Tony either, and he reaches out and puts a hand on her knee, trying to gauge her expression.
National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE): advocacy! If you’re looking for info, any info at all, their
“Let’s go,” Tony says, stone faced, and Steve bites back a growl of frustration. He waves his hands in front of Stephen’s face, then through him when he doesn’t react. “Clearly we’re wasting our time here.”
Tony turns dutifully around at the kitchen island to glance into the dark living room, rising and bringing his bowl of pasta with him as he stands behind the couch. Thor follows, curiosity beating out his voracious hunger, as Fox News comes up on the screen. Dana Perino is sitting at the usual desk, hands gesturing as she sits across from a commentator that Tony recognises from the usual news circuit.
“We’ll do a blood test tomorrow morning, make sure everything checks out. Honestly, you’re fine now, but I’d like to give it another injection just to be safe.” Bruce let out a huff of laughter, taking off his glasses and polishing them in his shirt. It was a nervous habit, betraying how worried he’d been for Tony throughout the whole process. Steve maybe felt a little bad. Maybe.  “We’re lucky that you’ve been on hormones and blockers for as long as you have, Tony. Trying to get your body to produce omega hormone after only ever producing it once in your life…it’s a slower process than it would have been for a lot of other OTA individuals. Mostly the issue was with not having enough alpha hormone in your bloodstream.”
“Gonna convince me?” Tony asked, a smile breaking over his face as Steve nipped gently at his neck. A hand tangled in his hair, tilted Tony’s head back so Rogers could lick at the corner of his mouth in a teasing kiss. “Steve.”
Tony can feel Loki shift behind him, restless and tense. “He’s being held in a compound in Lagos. They are trying to find the secret of the serum that runs in his veins, but he was unharmed and sedated when I left. However, our little performance may have made his stay much less comfortable. I know Amora. She is a vengeful creature, and she lacks finesse. She may yet harm him.”
“I wouldn’t say easily dismissed,” Steve says, slowly. “I think Tony’s an optimist, actually. People disappoint him.”
“No!” Steve barked, sharper than he’d meant to. His own anger took him by surprise. The idea that someone else could come into this space, could taint the last bastion of Tony’s scent- “No, JARVIS. I’m sorry. Just give me a minute.”
Tony huffs a laugh, and pulls his hand out of Steve’s warm, beautiful fingers. There are no calluses, probably because of the serum. He’s got artist hands: long, tapered fingers with pretty pink nails. They’re soft. Gentle.
“You’re reckless,” Loki says, sounding somewhat astounded. Tony pops the faceplate and grins at him.
. Tony’s wanted him, and with the dizziness of arousal swimming through him he can’t think of why he shouldn’t… just…
Tony stares down at the workbench, fingers drumming on the metal surface as he thinks. The lines of his shoulders are tight beneath his singlet, skin stained with black viscosity and sweat. Steve licks his lips and waits.
Steve wrenches his mouth away from Tony’s hand with violence, eyes glittering wetly. “That isn’t fair, Tony! You gave me no choice-”
The fridge was scattered with leftover Thai food. It looked like the bits and bobs left over from a pre-mission fuel up. The image of the team gathered around the dining table with Loki and Sam came to mind unbidden, everyone gathered and working together to try to save him from harm. The thought leaves something warm and aching in his stomach, and he startles when the fridge beeps at him.
The professor leads him into an office, walls the same polished mahogany as the rest of the mansion. The carpet is plush enough that he can feel the difference under his feet despite his shoes, and he takes a seat at the magnanimous wave of one thin, long-fingered hand. Xavier’s old money pedigree shows in his bones; a strong brow, sharp cheekbones, fine fingers. He has grace and presence that no one in a wheelchair, bound and at a height disadvantage, should rightly have.
“This is Fletcher Traynor. His mad scientist father was killed on a SHIELD op, and in his quest for revenge he turned himself into this toxic waste creature, codename Biohazard. He was, to be clear, born 100% human, and he was one of over a hundred prisoners being kept in a brainwashing internment camp in Connecticut known as Pleasant Hill. Remember that one? I know you all do.” He flicks through to another video, this time of Traynor throwing a teenage girl to the ground. “This is from five days ago. That girl is in a coma. Her name is Hayley Gonzalez. She may never walk again.” Tony pauses to read the room. It’s silent as a church on a Thursday. Only Collins is willing to meet his eye. “See, after the recent breakout, Traynor made his way to his native Brooklyn. Somehow his condition was triggered, and he tore through one of the most high-target areas of the city on a Sunday afternoon. There are fifty people injured right now, and four dead, including two-year-old Kamali Zaidi. He was trampled by the crowd and then crushed under falling debris.” Tony smiles mirthlessly. “I’ll spare you that video, but trust when I say I watched it, and it’s as horrible as you can imagine. Traynor was taken down after seventy-three minutes by Agent Barton with a chemical compound of my and Doctor Banner’s making, created same-day based on intel received from SHIELD. Barton and Romanov controlled the scene with SHIELD assistance while Banner and I worked in the lab.”
“Bless me Father, for I have sinned. It has been, uh.” Steve stops, huffing a self-deprecating laugh. Right. “It’s been a really, really long time since my last confession.”
“You’re such a little shit,” Tony said, tugging painfully at Steve’s hair in a way that made him melt bonelessly into the couch.
The sound Tony made above him was nearly pained, and Steve hummed in quiet pleasure at hearing it. Tony arched off the mat at that, and Steve hooked an arm each under Tony’s thighs, curling over the tops to splay his fingers across Tony’s hips. He knew Tony’s hipbones were sensitive, and his engineer loved to be held down like this. It helped him to feel like Steve was taking what he wanted, and what he wanted was Tony; nothing more, nothing less. For years, Tony’s long string of casual sexual partners had been there for the wild ride they were promised in the papers. Steve wasn’t going to lie, Tony was…skilled. God, who was he kidding, Tony was fucking incredible in bed. But sometimes, Tony needed to know that all Steve wanted was to pin him down and watch him come undone. He might not have been quite as experienced as Tony, but he made up for that with stamina and enthusiasm, and he had yet to hear Tony complain once.
Steve smiles that bashful, boyish smile of his that always makes Tony’s stomach turn over like he’s a kid in middle school with an awful crush. He opens his mouth under Steve’s when he leans in for a kiss, his lingering smile making it a little sloppier than usual as he reaches down, the cold, liquid touch of his fingers on Tony’s entrance enough to make him shiver. His tongue presses inside Tony’s mouth in tandem with his first finger, and Tony arches up under him, a soft sound escaping his chest at the dual sensation.
Tony’d had self-defence training growing up, as befitting a Stark heir. He knew some karate, a bit of wing chun, and was an excellent boxer. What was most fascinating, though, was the way he moved; his sharp eyes picked up everything, that scintillating brain of his always trying to find the trick, the way to get around Steve’s barriers, the way to trip him up. Sometimes he copied motions Steve hadn’t even taught him, just picked things up that Steve used on him enough times that he could watch and figure out the mechanics. He was brilliant, and infuriating, and always a surprise. Steve loved working with him.
“You used yourself as a honey trap,” he says, because he can see it. “Was that Tash’s idea, or yours?”
Tony doesn’t answer. He’s kneeling on the floor, and bent backwards like he’s doing the limbo, his head between the Iron-Man armour’s thighs. It’s a shockingly suggestive vision after he’s spent the better part of the morning desperately trying not to look at Tony, and Steve bites down hard on his lip and curls his hands into fists over his knees.
Sorry about posting late! I came down with the worst flu and kinda forgot what day it was, let alone to post. But hey, check it out, we're done! I wrote some extra stuff this past week because it felt like I ended it too soon, so I'm really glad I decided to split the last piece into two.
The look Tony gave her was scorching and knowing all at once, and in that instant, Steve understood several things: first, that Tony and this woman had slept together before; second, that Tony had expected all of these questions and that was precisely why he’d done the interview; and third, that afterwards, Tony and the interviewer had probably slept together again.
“It’s not magic. I would have to see a body, for the bond to break,” Steve said, unable to say ‘his body.’ He was impressed he’d managed to say that much at all. “Something about the pheromones, or something, I don’t know. That’s part of why it’s so important to get a soldier’s body home. There’s nothing worse than the constant ache of limbo.”
“You’re right,” Rogers said shortly, and Tony took a deep breath as Rogers’ fingers loosened. Tony stumbled into him, offering comfort in the press of his body against Rogers’ stalwart form. “Can’t fault me for wanting to spend the holiday taking care of the best friend I’ve got left.”
“Oh, don’t worry Maria. I’ll be getting to you in a minute,” Tony says with a plastic smile, glancing around the room. A few government cronies, clearly out of their depth, the rocky remains of SHIELD leadership, and a few uncomfortably familiar faces stare back at him with varying levels of chagrin. Maria Hill is the only one who doesn’t look at all cowed, and Tony fixes her with a long stare, trying to read her expression. At least Coulson has the decency to look a little sorry.
He watched Tony take a long swig from his water bottle, throat bobbing in the bright sunlight streaming through the clerestories. Steve licked his lips, eyes tracing a drop of sweat as it slid down one tendon and into the warm hollow of Tony’s throat.
“I was going to spin some bullshit about why Rogers couldn’t be pack alpha and try to goad you into doing it.” He smirked. “Looks like I don’t have to.”
There was a sharp intake of breath, and Steve opened his eyes to see that Tony looked bewildered. His eyebrows were furrowed, expression fierce.
Hope you're enjoying! Leave a comment and I promise I'll reply sooner rather than later. I really do love to get them in my inbox!
“I’m glad,” he tells him, and Steve smiles at him. It’s brilliant. “I went to church a few times as a kid, mostly for holidays. Easter, Christmas. My mother always liked St. Vincent. Beautiful, stately, but not as crowded as some of the other places.”
But Tony doesn't want to ask Steve for anything. That's the thing he hadn't been able to say to Bruce, that he's kept hidden behind the arc reactor next to his battered heart all this time. He doesn't want Steve's noble sacrifices. His careful, smothering sense of duty. His beautiful tears. After their last conversation, he'd expected shouting. Recriminations. He'd expected all of the weighty force of Steve's anger to come bearing down on him, just like it had on the helicarrier. He was prepared for that. He'd expected that. He wasn't ready for this coy, teasing campaign. He wasn't prepared for mischief and flirtation, for Steve to bare his heart like it was easy and then ask for Tony to do the same.
“Are you alright, sir?” JARVIS asks, alarmed. Tony raises one hand with the bird. “I shall take that as a no.”
“Some people have referred to the post-Potomac Crash investigations as a witch hunt. What do you say to that?”
Steve placed a gentle hand between Bruce’s shoulder blades. He knew that the man hadn’t even wanted to come, but Bruce, like Steve, was weak to Tony’s charms. As a rule, someone tried to stay with him at all times: not because they didn’t trust Bruce, but because Bruce didn’t trust himself and he felt safer with one of the Avengers. “You’re okay.”
“We’re going to dinner,” Rogers said, stubborn now, and Tony let himself be bundled towards Jarvis’ house. There was a long pause. “And then, maybe, if you’re good, we can play a few hands at the forge.”
“I think about it a lot,” Tony admits quietly, and Steve turns to look down at him, intrigued. All he can see is the barest sliver of Tony’s face; his temple, his ear, a bit of eyelash. His expression is placid. “He said it was ok to have those kinds of feelings privately, but I couldn’t act on them, because it reflected badly on him, the business, my mother-...” Tony huffs, blowing some of the hair out of his eyes. A single, perfect curl falls back onto his brow, and Steve wants nothing more than to push his finger through it. He puts both his hands back on the leg of the armour, where it’s safe to touch as much as he likes. “It was really careful phrasing, y’know? And I was smart, even then. I knew what he was implying. But I was so…angry, I guess. So I told him just because he’d spent his whole life in the closet, doesn’t mean I had to.”
It seems trite to think it now, but Ty had been different. Ty had known intimately what it was like to suck on a silver spoon all your life and still feel like everything was spinning out of your control, like nothing you did mattered to anyone. Ty had made him believe that he was going to be Tony’s forever. Even on the days when Ty had been a shithead and it was clear that the relationship was doomed to fail, Tony had imagined a future that vaguely resembled what Barton and Romanov have; friends, even after the amicable break up, because their stories are so closely aligned it’s impossible to imagine ever meeting someone else whose broken edges might match up. He’d imagined that Ty would be someone he could always rely on. Tony had been foolish, then: young, and easily swayed by Ty’s perfectly coiffed aesthetic and porcelain smile. In retrospect, Tony had been lucky. He doesn’t think Ty would have stayed loyal even if Tony had Bonded with him, and the last thing in the world he wanted to do was follow in the steps of Maria Stark, bless her soul. Turing forbid Tony had thrown his whole life away like that for a noxious young love.
Tony turns towards Bruce with an apologetic expression, but Bruce is already shaking his head, expression one of wry, disbelieving amusement. “Why do I bother giving you advice?”
Tony taps his fingers against his chin a few times. “Okay. Run it through simulations based on both Amora and Loki’s readings, poke at the variables, and I’ll see what I can get from Thor in the morning.”
"But no, I swear I do not intend to cause harm to you or your people, as you say, nor am I plotting your demise." Loki’s mouth twists into something like regret. It throws Tony off, leaves him unstable. “You have my word.”
He did not say: you are useless like this. He did not say: you are in the way, here. He did not say: you are making things worse for your mate.
It’s a beautiful day. The sun is shining, and the road spreads out before him in an unending black ribbon, no other vehicles ahead to impede his pursuit of the upper limit of his speedometer. He revs the engine, laughing, and accelerates down the blacktop and into the trees.
Steve has come back before. There’s no reason why he can’t come back from this. But even with the blood transfusions and the healing factor, he hasn’t shown any improvement. He hasn’t healed. Eventually, they’d made the call to put him on ice.
“Please what?” Tony asks. He leans back, spreading his free hand over Steve’s ass and pulling him open for the camera. “Gimme a colour, baby.”
“I love you,” Tony called, and Steve took a sharp breath, holding the memory of the words inside of him. “Steve.”
“There is one who follows her, like a pet to its master. He more than desires her; he is dedicated to her, to his last breath. He cannot be killed even if you cut him apart, for his flesh will regrow faster than even our captain can imagine. He is called the Executioner, for to face him is to face a chance at death.”
A part of Steve is glad. Steve doesn’t know what would happen if Tony had to fly while Steve was stuck on the ground. Bad things, he’s guessing. He’s imagined Tony stepping into the suit and hitting Mach 4, and being yanked along on the world’s most horrific bungee jump ride. It isn’t something he’s interested in trying out.
“Where?” War Machine demands, but Steve’s pushing out of Tony’s grip, sliding down the cable and swinging into the floor in question before Tony can react.
Maria rolls her eyes. “No, but I’m just saying, you’ve been here before and it’s never been good for you. Go home, Stark.”
“Captain Rogers is exiting the shower,” JARVIS says crisply, and Tony slumps into the bed, regulating his breathing as the water shuts off. He flattens himself to the mattress, pulling the sheets back over his hips and tucking his clenching fists under the pillows.
“Thank you,” Rogers croaked, the first sensible thing he’d said since Tony found him. His blue eyes were gaining clarity as he warmed, and he reached out a shaking hand to clutch at Tony’s fingers. “My thanks, for finding me.”
Steve heard them anyway, and nodded tightly. His hands were shaking, whether from want or exhaustion he didn’t know. He clenched his fingers, ducked his head, and stepped out into the light.
“Supposedly,” Maria agrees. She looks as though she’s swallowed a lemon, and Steve laughs a little, tired as if he’d been the one fighting. It’s been a long few months. He’s ready to go home.
"Should I text you his number? Or maybe I should give it to JARVIS. He can schedule an appointment," Steve goes on, and Tony drops his head into his hands.
“Wonder what these are made of, that they held you. Kevlar titanium weave, maybe? They’re a little shiny. J, grab a sample, maybe we can steal-”
I did not think this series would get so out of hand. I also did not finish even a single line of BINGO. Sometimes these things happen. Still working on my WIPs, if you’re waiting, so sorry about that. Just trying to muddle through this shite winter. Hope you’re enjoying the angst I guess?
“I meant what I said, you know,” Tony says easily, walking around Steve to survey the damage. There are a few flecks of melted metal left on his skin, and Tony picks them off with his nails, ignoring Steve’s flinch and hiss of pain at the first, his stony silence after. The skin beneath is red and raw, but not nearly as burnt as it should be. He circles back to Steve’s front, ticking a list off on his fingers. “I got you home. You’re my friend. We can talk about whatever you wanna say later, but you’re not okay right now. You’re gonna be.” He grins, lopsided. “And if you still want me to tie you up later, we can do that, too.”
“Come on, you can do it,” Tony says encouragingly. Then he shifts, his body turning lissom, insouciant. “Or do I have to get naked again?”
“Alright, Tony,” Rogers said, and Tony couldn’t help but stare at his throat as it worked. He’d never seen Rogers so biddable.
DUM-E lifted the blanket off the couch, offering it, but Steve shook his head, still chuckling. He felt better, after spending a little time in here. Good enough to laugh. That might have been the fact that he knew Tony was downstairs, safe and sound, though.
He thinks about the book that’s sitting in his duffel bag, although he’s only about thirty pages in. Romanov had recommended it to him when he’d asked about the word “intersex.” After the mission, on the flight back to D.C., he’d looked for the kind of bookstore that was likely to carry information on omega rights and anti-dynamic activism and LGBT+…things, and East City Bookshop had been the first place that had come up. The omega boy manning the till had bright sunset-pink hair and matching nails, and he’d been more than happy to talk to Steve. Steve had ended up walking out with a whole stack of books, including one that was supposed to be a historical examination of consent and/or lack thereof in heat and rut.
Tony cuts off the comms again. “There, done. Go to bed. Nat and Clint can get a flight out from Seoul when he’s patched up. Some breathing room will be good for everyone before shit hits the fan.”
. All of the little historical accounts are modified from tales of female warriors IRL. Feel free to hmu with questions about that, if you have ‘em.
“Alpha,” he sobbed, and Tony’s fingertips curled viciously into the meat of Steve’s arse, hard enough to bruise. “
“Now you know how I feel when you jump off of shit.” Tony’s tinny voice came from his phone in his pocket, voice muffled, and Steve pulled it out with his heart thundering in his throat.
“That’s not funny,” he says, because it isn’t. But now that she’s said it, he can’t stop thinking about it: Rogers’ hand brushing his hair back, his pained expression, the careful way he’d moved through the room while Tony was getting his bearings.
Tony feels as if his heart would climb out of his throat if he let it. He pulls back to stare into Loki’s face, not sure what he expects to see there, but when he checks, Loki’s mask is firmly in place. The only thing that betrays him is the slightest twitch of his irises, as though he wishes to break eye contact but can’t quite manage it. Tony moves his other hand to cradle the other side of Loki’s face, so his head is pressed between Tony’s hands. He can feel coolness slipping into his demeanour as he examines him, but he can’t quite mange to stop himself. Tony knows that this is a habit of his; as he studies opponents and allies alike, runs back video footage, surveys spending habits and daily routines, he is always asking,
A familiar figure appears silhouetted in the glass pane, and Tony has the barest moment to gather himself at the sight before Captain America is shouldering his way into the burnt out boutique. A hand reaches up and pulls the cowl back, and then Steve is on him in the next second, his hands coming up to cup the sides of the armour’s neck.
For those who are worried, Loki is coming back, I promise. This is not going to become a fic where Loki gets tossed aside (again) and Stony rides off into the sunset. You will eventually find out what the deal is with Bucky. Everything will be fine. Do not fret.
Loki grins, then shifts so Tony’s other leg is hooked over his elbow. Tony shivers with anticipation, intentionally staying relaxed as Loki presses in. He moans a little, and Loki just keeps going, all the way to the hilt. When Tony opens his eyes, Loki is staring at him with an unreadable expression, patient as he adjusts to the stretch, and when he flexes the leg slung over his shoulder to spur him on Loki smiles and begins to move. His pace is slow, maddeningly so, and Tony groans in frustration and pleasure, reaching up one hand to brace against the headboard.  Every thrust drags over his sweet spot in the position Loki’s shifted him into, and he squirms, trying to get more friction.
Is that all it took, Tony having different parts? Is that all that Steve was, in the end—a bigoted bully who’d hit his lover if they were a man, but not if they were a woman? Or was Tony so fundamentally a different person born as a woman that she would abandon her ideals for love of him? The idea of his Tony capitulating to his anger in order to appease him makes something foul curdle into his bowels. He wants to be ill. He knows, intimately, what Tony’s own demons can so easily convince him of: that he is unworthy of love and that he must prove himself. Was the other Tony like that? What was so different about them, that had led them down this murky and distorted road?
She turns her head, sharing the look with Tony: an offering of commiseration. Tony tilts his head, trying to gauge her sincerity. ”Nick read the file to you, and you gave us funding,” she continues. “You leveraged your military connections for us.”
Steve nods. “You think Natasha wouldn’t have tried to kill him, if she was in her right mind and found him on her sweep?”
, the voice said, and well. That was a pretty good argument, wasn’t it? He didn’t want Tony to know what he’d done, and if he let it eat at him, this tension would only build.
Tony watches, adjusting the intensity of the wave and the compression rate. “Oh, that’s messy. Inelegant.” Tony tilts his head to the side, considering. “But, it’s all we got. Do you think, maybe…if we were able to replicate this…?”
Franklin beams at him. He clutches his stuffed friend to his chest. Then he turns and sets off at a run, peeling down the hall faster than Steve can manage to tell him to slow down.
Tony is silent as he works. It’s one of the only times he is: all of that manic, whirlwind energy focussed in, a hurricane narrowed down into a tornado. In the beginning, he’d blasted music so loud Steve’s head ached, but once Steve started spending the afternoons down here he’d turned it down to more manageable levels, or put on headphones. It was such a minimal thing, but it means a lot to Steve, because it shows that Tony is trying. Despite everything, he’s willing to make concessions, however small.
Tony smiles, pleased at his own deductive reasoning. "Same one? St. Joseph's right? Wasn't that your dad's name? Was he named after the saint? No, wait, sorry. Backtrack. I mean, how was it?"
“As you know,” Pepper took over smoothly, “all entrants’ employee ID numbers have been entered into a program that will make a completely randomised choice. Now, once the program produces your number, we’ll match that against the SI database and follow it up with a name. Please make your way to the front if you hear your number and name called.”
Steve barked out a laugh, throat clogging with tears. God, he was just so fucking tired. He wanted to just sit down in the wreckage until Tony came and found him, until he could hold his alpha in his arms again. He wanted Tony to take the suit and carry him home.
“Like me?” Steve says, trying his best to hide his bitterness. By the huff of air that escapes Tony, he’s not sure he succeeds.
Reed smiles: it’s an uncanny, wise sort of smile. There is an age to him that separates him from Tony. If asked, Steve might attribute it to his years of fatherhood. He’s been the patriarch of a family longer than he’s been a childless superhero now, and it shows sometimes in little ways. He’s never had the boundless enthusiasm and spark that makes Tony run and run and run until he collapses under his own exhaustion.
Steve takes a moment, then tries his most winning smile. “Sure,” he says, easy, “that’s why I’m asking if I could just stop in and have a quick chat with her. I won’t be a moment.”
“Right,” Steve says, hitting the button again. Tony keeps humming his song, tapping one finger on the base of the car window.
“I was so afraid,” Steve whispers. “Clint was so sure he saw you go down hard, but we couldn’t find you. And you weren’t on comms, and I’d been ‘bout half a mile up trying to corral the civilians in Grand Central, and-”
,” Tony tells him. He laughs a little, shaking his head. Bruce’s fingers tangle in his curls. “You think I’m being kind? Bruce, I am the richest man in the
“Okay, Tony,” Steve says, visibly disappointed. He turns and sucks a painful bruise into Tony’s thigh, a low growl building in his throat. “The things I want to do to you.”
Xavier studies him. “That is up to you, Captain. I know that you had a severe flashback at the very mention of Stark’s death this week. Do you think you’re ready to be in the field and watch a building fall on him?”
“If the military knew what elegance in design was, we would have never needed Iron Man,” he retorts. He pulls the helmet off of the suit and lets JARVIS walk it over to the rig to do the heavy duty repair. A hissing breath escapes between his teeth when he sees the damage. “If this had taken any more hits, it would have gone through my actual occipital. I would be blind, maybe dead.”
“Does anybody? This life doesn’t leave much room for romance.” Sam heaves himself up from the grass, dusting himself off a bit. “Come on, let’s get your sorry ass on the road so you can save the day and get the boy, or whatever it is you people do for fun.”
“You tried to avoid me, after you realised how badly things could go wrong,” Steve says, which is technically true, but. “I was the one who kept pushing. I should have respected your space.”
“Stark is the Lead Engineer and Creative Director for Stark Industries. Thor has an entire realm that he bears responsibility for. Doctor Banner has published four groundbreaking and highly technical papers on radiation, neutron decay, and the effects of heavy metal and radiation poisoning on Asgardians just this year.”
He has two shoulder missiles hit the enhanced woman in the sternum, blasting her into the dirt without even turning around. Now that he’s seen her in action, he knows it won’t hold her down for long. He prefers enemies that he can go all out on.
“No, you’re the other brain on the team and Loki’s right; I’ve got some tech wrangling to do before we ship out, even if it’s only to amp up one of the secondary suits a bit.”
“A wild card,” Steve says, more fondness in his voice than he’d like. “A live wire. A rigged bomb. He’s always moving, always changing, always running off to do something dangerous.”
“That person is clearly not in their right mind,” he deadpanned. The crowd cackled. “You know this is gonna be front page tomorrow, Cap.”
After that, things happen quite quickly. Romanov is pulling a duffel bag out of the SHIELD car she, Banner, and Barton arrived in and tossing it into Banner’s arms. He shoots her a smile that’s closer to bewildered than anything else, and Steve thinks,
“It’s okay,” Tony says quickly. He shrugs. “This is perfect, actually. You do…whatever you’ve gotta do for SHIELD. I have six million things to take care of at the SI campus. The plan was to slowly transition to a bicoastal operation—NY for business, Cali for production. There’s a lot left to do, Pepper’s been driving me crazy, so. This is great. It all works out.” He’s babbling, he knows, but this wasn’t part of the plan. This is so far from the fucking plan. Tony’s a futurist, but he couldn’t have imagined this outcome. He feels so
Steve leaned forward, curling up in Tony’s lap. He clenched his fingers in the worn cotton of his shirt, pulling it up so he could press his face into skin. His nose burrowed against the slim line of hair at the base of Tony’s stomach, leading down below the waistband.
“Right,” Tony said, but his eyes were soft, now. Steve leaned in closer, enough that their noses brushed together. He swallowed. “The fridge door is beeping.”
“Yes, I see you have the way of it.” Thor shakes his head. “There is a reason my brother has chosen you, although for what purpose I cannot ascertain.”
Tony melts under Steve’s hands. He always does, for him. He trembles, his arms coming up to grip the corded muscle of Steve’s forearms, sliding up and over his shoulders, then down, firm, all the way to his ass. Steve makes a luscious sound into his mouth, tips his head and kisses him deeper, like he’s trying to crawl into Tony’s skin. It flushes him up to the tips of his ears, makes him ache with longing. He can feel Steve with every tentacle—wrapped around one ankle, and over the back of one knee, and the soft, lightly-furred place between his thighs-
There was a quiet, dangerous silence. “You’ve been locked in with Tony Stark in an alpha rage for the past four hours?” Natasha asked, voice flat. “And you didn’t think to mention this before?”
the voice coos, and Steve is crying, curled and small, over Peggy’s dead body. She took the bullet for Erskine before the experiment could be completed, and he knows this wasn’t how it went, he knows, he knows Peggy is old and greying and still so beautiful-
“But…” Tony sighs. “It would probably be a big help if I didn’t have to worry about him poisoning the well.”
Hulk growls, his scent spiking with anger. “Voice stupid. Tin Man hurt inside, not outside. Inside hurt bad, too.”
Tony sits up and folds his legs in front of him. He tilts his head to the side, considering, and one long, grease-stained tendon stands out in his throat. Steve swallows, watches a bead of sweat slide down and settle in the hollow at the base there. His mouth flattens into a thin line.
There were a few confused murmurs. Tony scratched the side of his jaw. “Uh, that can’t be right,” he said, sounding a little baffled, even as his name appeared on the projection under the number. “Um. So, that’s
“You’re…all my life, I heard all these stories about you. The man you were, and the man I should try to be. And I thought it was bullshit. Nostalgia, rose-tinted glasses, whatever. And then when I met you, I mean. Hey, fault’s mutual, but you were kind of an asshole, which is because you were going through some shit so, whatever. I could have been less…me. Maybe.” Steve's mouth twists into a moue. He shakes his head. “But you’re actually just a really awkward sweetheart, aren’t you? You’ve got a soft, gooey centre under all that muscle.”
Then the interviewer had asked her final question. “A lot of people have wondered, how have you managed to keep your dynamic a secret all this time, when you’ve been so prolific in…sharing your affections?”
Now, he was standing at the doorway to the workshop with his fists clenched at his sides, not sure if he was strong enough for this next part. He didn’t exactly know how it would feel to walk into the workshop without Tony there, blasting music and welding something or other, but he knew it wasn’t going to be good. He knew Clint would have come with him if he’d asked, but he didn’t know if he wanted an audience for this part, either. He felt like his skin was on too tight.
“It’s never over,” Steve sighs. He pulls back, rolling his neck around his shoulders. He tugs his left arm back, the crunch loud enough that even Tony hears it. “Damn it, Tash.”
Outside, true to form, Logan is staring down at Steve’s Softtail with a covetous expression on his craggy face. An unlit cigar hangs from his mouth, and Steve considers him, arms folded over his chest.
“But someone might tell, in order to maybe gain favour with a future ruler,” Bruce posits, and Thor nods, expression grim. “No offense, but why are you back here? Shouldn’t you be in Asgard, helping to smooth things over?”
Steve laughs shakily. He rubs his hands over his head. “This is a really important mission, Franklin. Only you can do it. You’d really be helping me out.”
Steve grinned. “Well, are you a mortal scientist that needs assuring?” he asked. “Because, you know, I can hold you like this for a long,
CW: severe panic attack, disassociation, some p heavy arguing, emotional manipulation (but not from who you think hahaha...ha...)
“Rhodes is an excellent asset.” Natasha shrugs, elegant as ever. “Ross respects you, as much as you annoy him. He wouldn’t work with anyone else, except maybe Steve.” She pulls out a sharp smile, an old joke: “And Steve’s shit at politics.”
“Bruce says I’m too far into the bond-sickness to take suppressants,” Steve muttered, and Natasha speared him with a glare. “I waited too long. If I take them now, it will throw my biochemistry all out of whack. It might damage the bond.”
, Steve told himself firmly, embarrassed at his own betrayal. He licked his lips, skating his fingers over Tony’s chest.
“Yeah,” he managed, chest so tight it was a wonder he could get the word out at all. “Yeah. Two humans of the same nature can’t bond. But they can get married, the way betas do, now. That was only legalised recently. In some rare cases, beta-omega pairs can bond, too. But there’s only a small handful of documented cases where an alpha was able to bond with a beta. It’s almost unheard of. I’ve heard it hurts like hell, too, but that might just be the propaganda.”
“I can’t imagine Sheriff Rogers had any dearth of offers to spend his Christmas at a warm fire with a grateful citizen of Timely,” Tony mused, letting Rogers bully him down the street. “Gonna toss me in a cell for public disturbance and go on up to the Parkers’ homestead for supper?”
“Sir.” JARVIS pauses, hesitant, and Tony turns to the nearest camera and offers a raised eyebrow. “He is bringing dinner for the both of you. I suspect it is an apology.”
did not, to my knowledge, dismantle a Japanese war camp in the fashion described herein, but I wouldn’t put it past her. She’s pretty badass. If anyone has any further interest in the history I'm sneaking in here, please feel free to ask! I’m happy to chat about them and provide plenty more.
“You’ve been carrying all that for a year, huh?” Tony asked, and his voice was so gentle it felt like a caress. “Through our bonding, and our honeymoon, through everything, you thought I was an unwilling partner?” Tony sounded hurt, and Steve’s eyes flew open as he turned back to meet Tony’s gaze.
