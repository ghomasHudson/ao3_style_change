"Make love?“
Obviously yes, because it didn’t stop at all, especially when Dean’s hand was on his butt, pressing him even closer. Again a moan escaped him.
Dean’s face felt unnaturally warm. He couldn’t tell what had just happened, but he felt that this had meant something.
Dean released a hand from Castiel’s cheek and immediately Castiel missed that physical contact. Then Castiel felt Dean’s thumb on his forehead. Very gently, Dean stroked it, again and again, as if to internalize every single spot. His thumb moved on, stroking through his hairline, and Castiel smirked as Dean briefly tousled through his hair.
"I agree with Sam,“ Cas interrupted them. "He is a true hero, pure to the core. I enjoy watching him take care of Frodo.“ Honestly, who would contradict Cas‘ sincerity?
Obviously, Dean knew about the pain Cas had felt when splitting up. He knew about the guilt and the remaining confusion. Cas had admitted to himself that he was gay and couldn’t be with her anymore, that was the part Cas had mentioned several times before. Apparently, Meg wasn’t innocent in their break-up, though. In a way, she had hurt him, too, but Dean didn’t want to push Cas to talk about this. Maybe another time. They had shared so many painful stories lately, and he wanted to avoid darkening the mood further – after last night.
"Show Me Love" by Robin S (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps2Jc28tQrw)
“Good morning, by the way.“ He grinned all over his face, kissed Andrea on the cheek who whispered softly, “You’re a master in diplomacy“ and gave Benny a quick hug.
The material seemed to be leather. It felt soft under his fingertips and the back of his hand. The smell was there, but it was not overpowering and unpleasant, rather musky in a good way. Also, there was a robust buckle. On the bottom left Dean could make out a small engraving – "DW“. He swallowed hard because with what did he deserve all these cute surprises?
A beautiful smile was painted on his lips, and Dean watched him with this kind and soft expression in his eyes Castiel could never quite place.
"You serious? This is almost 2000 years old?“
"Sexual intercourse was not strictly consummated, but yes, one could speak of sexual activities. Mostly it was kissing and touching. On top of that, we-“
Why everything just on this day? At some point, he reluctantly realized that there was no point in wasting any more time unnecessarily. Castiel glanced at the clock. Almost 8 a.m.
The next chapter(s) will feature more interactions in real life again.
And so, once again, Dean pondered the one question that had been on his mind for more than 20 years. Would his dad ever stop torturing him with his words?
Screw it, this time Dean wasn’t afraid of the sexual implication, he wasn’t. He wanted that, he’d wanted all of that for years, but had stopped himself from being happy only because he’d been an idiot. He wanted Cas.
Then, finally, we two dumbasses met again
"I knew you were bi from the beginning, I just found it interesting you did not try to overcompensate and tell me how you’re off to hooking up with a chick later, that’s all.“
Apparently Sam caught his gaze and said something to the woman. A few minutes later he returned to him and laughed.
He sighed and dove into the tune again. Her voice really sounded amazing, he was kinda mesmerized. Then he thought about the fact the lyrics spoke to him on a deep level, and he felt so much pain and despair and also comfort. All at once.
"M’kay,“ Dean replied indecisively, fixating the car again.
And now this plush bee.
Probably all the bar patrons thought he was a loser who drowned his self-doubt in alcohol because otherwise he couldn’t find happiness and redemption.
He rolled to the side, laid down on his stomach, so he could still face the screen. "Climb on my back, it’s easier then.“
He rubbed his nose, and took a deep breath. Maybe, he had to be the bigger person here. Maybe, he had to swallow his pride once more.
"Cassie, you nighthawk. Do I have to bail you out of jail?“
Seriously, what had he ever done to deserve this?
"Of me ogling a stripper?“
Cas was too important to him. He needed him so much. Cas was everything.
What had gotten into Cas? Why was he suddenly acting so dismissive? His reason told him that this guy was one of the reasons Cas had suffered so much in the past. Why he had wanted to hide his true self. Why he had been ashamed.  Before he could share his thoughts with Cas, Hannah returned to the table. She had changed her clothes and now wore her hair down. Although they were not biological siblings, Dean imagined he noticed a resemblance between her and Cas. They had a good conversation, and Hannah was genuinely accommodating and attentive.
Again, he looked to the side, caught Cas’s gaze, and smiled at him. Without ironic or mocking or embarrassed overtones. Just the way he felt. And Cas smiled back, as openly and freely as Dean had ever seen.
It was one of the first romantic songs he had listened to over and over in boarding school. He had hidden from his bullies, had hidden from the outer world, had gotten lost in his dream of showing the world who he really was and wished for this special someone described in the song.
Without thinking long about the lunacy of this situation, Dean left the clothes on right away. They looked damn good on him. He asked the man to take a photo of him - from the side and without his face being recognizable.
"You know you’re driving me crazy right?" Dean murmured affectionately, while letting his nose and mouth wander alongside Cas‘ throat and ears. By now, Dean had learned Cas was very sensitive there. Cas cracked a smile while surpressing a groan. "I noticed. Though one might say we were always driving each other crazy in one way or another.“
"I noticed,“ Cas commented on his first remark. Dean rolled his eyes playfully, and grinned at Cas.
Sam never minced words, so it came as no surprise to Dean that he pulled him into a hug. "That’s what I’ve been trying to get you to understand for years. You’ve always been my hero.“
I appreciate your patience, for making me understand in the last few days that you would not disappear from my life when I am not able to answer (yet). You show so much thoughtfulness and understanding. I’ve noticed from some of your short texts that you are at least as curious about my responses as I am about yours.
"What are you doing?“ asked Castiel, falling into a nervous laugh. Any amusement drained from his voice when he saw Dean’s legs and back. Castiel didn’t want to stare, but he immediately saw the fine and numerous scars that were there. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t want to pity Dean, didn’t want to offer him hollow phrases, just wanted to show him that he was there.
"Nah, man, I’m awake now. Let’s… I don’t know, go for a walk or something.“
Dean grinned at him afterwards, removing some crumbs from the corner of Cas‘ mouth. When he kissed him, he still tasted the icing on his tongue.
He looked at the two most important people in his life and grinned broadly. "Sam, please just cover your ears with your hair or vanish to your room for a few minutes. This is the sappiest thing in the existence of Dean Winchester.“
Next to him, Dean always felt like a wet sack, even though he also exercised, but ate much more and slept less than Garth. He was lucky that his metabolism was so good.
"Why don’t you have a chat with him? He’s a few years younger than you, and so far he’s showing a lot of promise. I just thought it would be nice for him to meet you.“
Soon he tried on a pair of shoes. Lace-up shoes, Oxford style, in a classy black. They were elegant, Dean liked them. Immediately, he felt more sophisticated and open-minded in a way. His mind developed new thoughts, all of a sudden he had so many ideas, so much he wanted to do. It was odd and awesome.
He wrapped his arms around himself as to protect himself from his anger and doubts and his father’s yelling.
Dean beamed. "I’m proud of you. You’re getting really good at the whole irony thing, ya know?“
"Yeah.“ Dean tightened his arms around Cas, crossed their legs, and it felt so right, so natural to lie here with him. He could get used to that. "Yeah, maybe I do.“
Now the woman looked at him like he had just gifted her a fancy house. Suddenly, she hugged him, right in the middle of the street. She patted his back, and Dean didn’t know what to do with himself. Cautiously, he returned the hug before they separated again. Feeling awkward all of a sudden, he scratched the back of his neck.
I don’t want to give you phrases, I don’t want to tell you that everything will get better. Certainly, everything will get better, especially the surgery will hopefully take a big burden off your shoulders. However. All this does not undo the fact of how your father treats you.
Despair and fear made room again for other, more positive feelings. Before he could decipher them more precisely, tears were rolling down his cheeks again. Once again, he no longer understood himself.
As Dean asked him what was so interesting to see there, Cas simply mouthed, "Everything“. He didn’t stop the staring, and honestly, Dean wouldn’t want to have it any other way.
Garth looked ten years younger in his old baggy sweater; his wife had worked the night shift the last two days and was still sleeping it off. She was going to join them in the early afternoon.
"Fancy a little spontaneity?“ That had been Cas‘ first comment on the 14th of December. It had sounded so free, and honestly, Dean hadn’t expected to ever see Cas so relaxed. But it was such a good feeling he was responsible for this. In the morning they laid curled up in bed – shirtless – because Dean really enjoyed being skin to skin too much. Cas held him in his embrace, continuously stroking Dean. His fingers touched his chest, very lightly, yet with so much tenderness.
"Oh you change my mind, that it? I remember the other day when you were explaining to me why Hell Hazers is illogical and stupid – and I kissed you until-“
Quote from Cas's message: "Homo sum. Humani nil a me alienum puto"
"Gabriel, but please call me Gabe.“ Gabriel winked again, and seriously, was this guy a hobby comedian?
Dean thought about all the coincidences, the resemblances. He thought about Angel with this black fuzzy hair, the handsome profile and Angel’s remarks that he had blue eyes and a deep voice, then the thought about Cas’s appearance and the fact he had been attracted to him the very first second they had met in the supermarket. Dean thought about Angel’s brother who seemed to be a genuine person who brought out the best in Angel, then the thought about Cas’s brother Gabriel who was exact this way.
"Cas, you’re so mysterious. It’s kinda turning me on,“ Dean said in an attempt to lighten the mood. Cas rolled his eyes, but he caressed his cheek. Dean kissed Cas passionately, never stopping to think about the pendant. What had Cas meant? He wouldn’t forget about it, but he wasn’t getting anything out of him either.
"I was sitting beside you guys and couldn’t help but notice someone’s having an important day. When I was your age, I couldn’t wait for dessert. So happy birthday.“
Dean wrapped his arms tighter around Cas, feeling so much bliss and peace inside. "I love you, Cas. I love you so frigging much.“
When Dean had shown up at his reading and responded so enthusiastically to his work, it had touched him deeply. The encounter with his parents, where Dean had defended him, and their subsequent conversations had also meant a lot to him. That was why he felt better now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Still, he had to figure out the meaning of Angel’s message.
"Dude, what the hell.“ Dean glanced at the note, shook his head, looked at the note again, and smacked his forehead with the flat of his hand.
By now he seemed to have gotten the general idea, too, because he nodded with satisfaction and then climbed down the ladder as if it were the easiest thing in the world. “If we keep at it, we’ll be done by tonight. I guess we can leave two-thirds of the tiles in. The condition is nowhere near as bad as you described.“ He patted Dean’s shoulder encouragingly, then climbed onto the huge pile of tiles and began sorting. “I can tell I’m not needed here.“
He punched in the wooden back rest, threw his glass from the nightstand, taking a book and the vial with it in the process. It didn’t help though, the next words came out in a rush.
“You are attempting to amuse me, aren’t you?“ it finally burst out of Cas. “You’re formulating my exact thoughts. I had a hard time with my coming out. Many tears were shed. I lost a dear friend at this time, simply because I decided to be selfish, to be myself. After all those years. I even wrote something about these feelings, this phase.“ Toward the end, his voice had grown quieter and quieter, so quiet that the bar suddenly didn’t seem intimate enough to Dean.
Keeping himself permanently occupied comforted him over dull and unwelcome thoughts. He was still at loggerheads with his parents, although they had come to terms and talked things out in the meantime. Nevertheless, there had been a lot of bad blood between them, and Castiel grew tired of these discussions.
There are still several chapters left. :) And I promise this story has a happy ending!
"Can you do anything other than literally hiss at me?“ Touché. "I get it now. You're strong. If anything, you’re laying the guy and not the other way around.“
On the 19th of December Cas gently shook his shoulder. He’d been staying with him again last night, and honestly? Dean hadn’t slept so well in – forever. Cas presented him flowers as a surprise, and Dean was baffled, at first, because he’d never gotten flowers before in his entire life. There were red sweet maries and Jasmine flowers* which smelled wonderful. Dean was full of bliss.
"Dean, you don’t have to give me your clothes, you know that I technically do not freeze.“
Shortly after him followed a woman who could not have dressed more provocatively. A skirt that she actually didn’t have to wear at all and a top with the neckline almost reaching the floor. She looked very embarrassed, which made her outward appearance look a little shaky. The man rushed on quickly, and he zipped up.
"That will remain my secret for now.“ That answer had been satisfying, yes, that had sounded plausible, Castiel decided.
Even from a distance, Castiel caught her irrepressible energy and positive aura. With a broad grin, she stopped in front of him and put her hands on her hips.
Maybe Cas had long since come to terms with everything and wouldn’t have it any other way. Didn’t want to dive into that swamp of deceit and contempt anymore and sink deeper and deeper and deeper. After all, everyone processed these negative experiences in their own way. Cas hadn’t uttered a single word, yet. This was all going in the wrong direction. This visit to the beach had been so beautiful so far. Now there was a strange tension between them.
Again, he asked himself why Cas made him feel so nervous all the time. It shouldn’t be an unusual thing, right? Buying clothes for one’s boyfriend. Dean’s pulse quickened at the term. This was them now, two guys being boyfriends. He was in an actual relationship. Holy shit.
"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.“ from "Anna Karenina" by Leo Tolstoy
"What?“
But Cas was already grinning mischievously, clearly enjoying himself. He then couldn’t get out of grinning at all, and Dean didn’t know whether to punch him in the arm or jump on his lap. Cas was amusing, he made him laugh.
"I’m glad you got loose of those assholes. And that’s not only because we value your qualities and your insights and teaching skills. Nobody deserves a treatment like that. Prejudices are a lot of bullshit, most of the time. And they are hurtful and destroy people’s lives when there are enough indulging in those hate campaigns.“
And yet.
Dean clicked his tongue. "Yeah. Can’t promise you to stop that.“ He shrugged, still grinning broadly. "So, it worked out. We’re both here. Same place, same time.“
Maybe Cas was some kind of guardian, and he saw it as his duty to save weak persons from danger and from themselves.
Dean paused, taking his chin between his fingers before leaning forward a bit, his face hidden between his thighs again. All Castiel could hear was his rasping breath, drawn-out snaps, and a few clicking noises. Castiel suspected that Dean was frustrated with his own reactions, which he really had no reason to be. After some time, Dean raised his head, sniffled, and reached for Castiel’s hand.
Again, Dean shot him a look, studying him in an intense way. "Can see why. Still, that’s way over the top. Hope you’ll get rid of her soon. Lemme know if I can help you in any way.“ Then, he patted Castiel’s arm for a few seconds before cursing loudly. When Castiel looked at him bemusedly, Dean laughed. "Should’ve dried my hands first.“
"Night Moves" by Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mRFWQoXq4c)
Dean and Cas go on a winterly horseback ride on which Cas shows Dean a secret spot. Then, Sam and Dean have some brotherly bonding time.
RambleOnIm67 had gotten into an emergency, otherwise Castiel could not explain the sudden disappearance without further explanation. The quote was the strongest indicator. Castiel wished he knew what had occurred. This condition overwhelmed him. What could he do?
"Hello from me, too.“ Now he was looking directly at them, and Dean immediately noticed his dark eyes. He also wore glasses with black rims. "We are glad that you are interested in the club. By the way, our club is called "
"Just come here.“ Without waiting for his reaction, Cas pulled him onto his fucking lap, as if Dean weighed nothing, and kept talking to him.
Another picture showed a stairway, a really impressively drawn stairway, but it didn’t point up, it was curved, showing different directions. It had no real end. The stairway had different types of steps, angles and patterns. And it sometimes bore the tiny inscription "blissway“.
Here comes part 10. :) We’ll have more talking, they put some of their misunderstandings out of the way.
Dean removed his hand again and found that only a few inches separated them now. Again Cas smiled.
A mother with her son amused him. The boy raved enthusiastically about the cacti in the nursery, but couldn’t understand why his mother wouldn’t buy him a large specimen.
Castiel averted his gaze. He wasn’t used to being called the most interesting person. He didn’t usually stand out, there were always louder people who knew better how to put themselves in the spotlight.
Dean just puffed and nodded.
"Do you want my professional or my friendly advice?“
"Mm,“ Balthazar replied, silent for a few seconds. "Structure is key, if you ask me, but I see your point. You know what helps? Distraction. You need to do more, be around people more, and you’ll get back into a more natural writing flow. Inspiring meetings with your students alone is not guaranteed to get the next romance novel down on paper. Unless you, well, shift those relationships a little.“ Castiel snorted in annoyance and sank deeper into the water.
"Ohh, the reference. Always forget how bad you are at this stuff. Seriously, sometimes you have so much in common with this guy I’ve kinda started romancing, by now.“
“I’ll have a white coffee,” Cas muttered absently. Hannah nodded and said she’d be right back. She mumbled something about taking a prolonged break so she would have enough time for them. Cas whispered so softly that Dean could barely hear him. “Why is she so nice? I don’t understand.”
"What’s the matter with my coat?“ Castiel asked, his voice immediately defensive.
By the time we’ve learned about it, he was in his twenties. He collapsed one day, just stopped breathing. Crap. Turned out he needed a special treatment with antibiotics (regularly) and other checkups.
Hello! :) Truly, I was sooo excited to finally post the chapter where Dean figures it out. That being said, I still want to resolve certain topics in this fic. Oh, and the next chapters are rather fluffy – I think they deserve it. :)
Cas laughed lustily, and really, there couldn’t be a simple sound in the world which was more beautiful and satisfying to Dean’s ears.
Castiel felt happy, wrapping his arms around Dean's lower back now.
"You can drop me off at the Gas-N-Sip,“ Castiel said coolly.
“Now tell me what’s really going on. Anna and you were literally jumping on each other. And now she’s standing at the back of the bar digging some other guy.“
Only now did Castiel see that Dean was holding two coffees to go in his hands, one of which he handed to Castiel. Perplexed, Castiel accepted the coffee and sipped the hot beverage to cover his confusion. Still grinning, Dean didn’t seem to want to stop.
"Another cocoa for me, dearest kidnapper.“ Dean shook his head and headed toward the kitchen. Immediately he heard hurried footsteps behind him and a door being slammed.
"Okay,“ Castiel whispered after several minutes of kissing. "Let’s go see Hannah tomorrow. I don’t know whether she will let us in but I want to try.“
Not to mention, it touched me deeply that you have now told me the complete background of your scavenger hunt. It is one of the most beautiful and stirring things I have ever witnessed. Your idea was truly wonderful, and I’m glad you decided to put it into action - because that’s how we met. :-)
As before, it strained him to keep his eyes open, so puffy were they. All the tears after his confession had exhausted and wonderfully cleansed him. At last, he had been able to speak openly about his mother’s death, he had opened up to Cas and confided in him the secret that had always been on his mind while exchanging their messages. And yet, fear had held him in chains.
"Soon, yeah, I wanted to check out this cool location at first.“ Dean grumbled on the way there, because it had to be some eco-shit, and he wasn’t in the mood for that. But he would get more tired there, that’s for sure, and consequently he’d sleep better. So far for his logic. They headed to a barely lit building and then it hit Dean. "Sammy, this is a strip bar.“
And because he didn’t know how else to express his gratitude and many, many feelings, he kissed Dean even more intimately, with so much urge. Their lips had melted into one.
"I cannot thank you enough. For everything. You seem like a purely kind person, it’s a rare character trait.“
"And for your information: I took the little plush bee with me you gave me. I think it’s a lovely welcome home gift. I named her Alissia because the name means righteous, kind and worthy. So I will always associate her with you.“
The first time I saw the movie was about 10 years ago. My brother, who is a big movie lover with extensive home theater equipment, hosted a sort of themed movie night back then. Since I’ve already told you how he flew to Italy to find the perfect speakers for me, you can probably imagine that his movie equipment choices were also specific and targeted.
“Were you gonna tell me?“ They’d been driving for 6 hours now, and Dean knew he needed to rest soon, even let Sammy take the wheel for a while, but his latest insights didn’t exactly calm him down. At first, Sammy pretended he didn’t hear him as if Dean would fall for that bullshit. Two minutes passed until Sam made a frustrated sound in the back of his throat. "No.“
Gabriel put a hand on Dean’s back and padded it for a few seconds. "My car is in good hands, I see. Ya know, I did study law, but then I found it too boring. You, kiddo, are the right guy for this.“
Sometimes they just wrote short one-liners back and forth. Very teasing, sometimes provocative, usually with a flirtatious undertone. Then again, the topics quickly struck more serious tones, so profound that Dean sat spellbound in front of the screen. When Angel answered him, he never thought long about his answer. He wrote down everything that came to his mind.
Many of his fellow students were there, many people who were unfortunately very aloof and limited with their insights. To this I should perhaps mention that my best friend had studied law, and is now an excellent lawyer.
His heart beat faster, faster, beating solely for Cas here. Dean was so full of emotion that even though he still listened to the song, experiencing it with all his senses, he could only look at Cas. Cas, who saw and accepted him as he was, with all his insecurities and his burdens and his quirks, and who for some reason couldn’t get enough of it.
A blue-green flannel? How dumb could he have been to not see that? And the coffee? Damn, of course it was Cas‘ doing as well. But not to do something for himself, no, he wanted to make sure Dean felt good in the morning. He wanted to give him at least that because he knew how badly Dean slept and how many nightmares he experienced.
"I gotta give it to you, man. That’s a frigging wonderful car. You have taste.“ Dean wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, now that he knew the man was not interested in him.
Two hours later, Dean was sure he was going to have whiplash or similar the next day, because they went on every damn merry-go-round that existed on this fair. At least once.
Love was reading together in the Men of Letters‘ Library. Conversations and discussions on a wide variety of topics. Bickering.
"Okay, my friendly advice is - run as fast as you can. Don’t go back to that coffee shop you’re so fond of. That should do the trick. Really, you should never have told that in the interview.“
Dean, however, was on pins and needles, seemingly unable to wait to speak on the subject. Castiel found this interesting. Although "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" in particular had become a pop culture classic and had been adapted as a movie, he had never seriously considered the novel series or the author.
He had not liked the film of the same name. The book by Nicholas Sparks, on the other hand, on which the film was based, had been beautiful, if the ending was a bit too tragic to make him hopeful now.
If he kept this up, he would probably accidentally poke someone else’s eye out. Benny snorted playfully, and Dean wondered how his friend was able to produce such sounds.
A squeak interrupted his thoughts. The dean’s office door opened. "Mr. Novak,“ the dean greeted him warmly as always. Castiel nodded to him and reached for his briefcase. "I apologize. Please come in.“
"I know every constellation and star on the night sky,“ Cas muttered and this time Dean didn’t feel the urge to comment, because he was certain Cas solely tried to explain his musings to him.
Dean’s entire face glowed and Castiel was unable to look away. He didn’t mean to stare at Dean but Dean’s aura was radiant. Dean’s expression and especially his eyes told him so much, yet at the same time created more questions with every second.
His sister-in-law just smiled mischievously and looked apologetically at Sam. "Well, Dean is right,“ she showed. And with that, Dean’s peace of mind was restored.
"Cas,“ Dean muttered, trying too hard not to cry. Here, on this damn fair.
"All right, but then I need to look at your leg. My home is not far, just a few minutes from here. Can you stand up?“
Here comes chapter 22! Things are intensifying - further.
Green Eyes laughed harder and harder, and his entire body vibrated. Castiel felt warm, and he became unusually comfortable around this stranger. Only now Castiel’s attention was not only on the extraordinary eyes. Castiel settled into a comfortable sitting position. A loud throat clearing sounded, and he suddenly sat stock-still.
"Knew it,“ Dean said without any context before engaging him in another tender kiss.
“I was thinking something like that. Which I don’t have a problem with now either.“ She said that very relaxed, a bit too indifferent for his taste. Did she even want to be here?
You are you, and also considered solely on your core worth everything. I just wanted to tell you that in this way. If you like, keep me posted on your brother’s condition. Through you, I care about him as well.
I wish for your brother that he can return to a more normal life. I wish all of that for him, even though I don’t know him. But I know and feel how much he means to you, and that is enough for me. This person that you care about so much, that you love so much that you give up your own dreams and goals, if only for the moment, this person must be a great person.
"That sounds nice.“
Castiel liked Dean, he was a fascinating and captivating person. On the surface, he seemed to be a very attractive, flirty and quick-witted man – which he was, objectively speaking, but Castiel didn’t really pay attention to these matters at this point.
Meanwhile, Dean had pushed him further into the room, now tossing him gently onto the bed while shifting his weight onto him. Dean propped himself up on his elbows, and cradled Castiel’s face with his hands, finally only stroking his cheek with his thumb.
“Angel,” he murmured, nudging Cas’s nose with his own. “Wake up!” His words were only a breath, quieter even than the gentle whisper of the wind that brushed the window, almost unnoticed. Instead of opening his eyes, Cas wrinkled his nose and frowned, much as if to playfully reprimand Dean even as he slept. A short laugh escaped Dean, then he pressed a kiss to Cas’s lips.
“Sounds like a plan for the future.”
“Good night, Dean.“
"You wanted me here.“ Okay, so Cas had come to the bunker only because Dean had asked him to. Dean didn’t have the slightest idea how to feel about that.
When Cas stayed with them, Dean often sought him out in the library. In silence, they did their research or whatever they were working on, but after a while Dean usually couldn’t focus anymore. He couldn’t put a finger on the reasons, but in those moments he felt lost and weirdly contented simultaneously.
He took his book, tried not to worry too much. Of course, he was familiar with this situation. Sometimes, feelings could get intense and Dean only tried to get control of them again. He worried, however, and couldn't quite concentrate on reading.
"No,“ Castiel said, narrowing his eyes. That was a rude answer, he found. "I mean. Yes, I want to continue talking to you, but this is not the best topic. My-“ He wanted to say sister, but family topics still brought more pressure to a situation. Besides, he’d have to elaborate for that, and he didn’t want to scare Dean away with sad life stories at the very beginning of their friendship.
Then they sat on the bed, just holding hands. Saying nothing, just breathing together. In and out. In and out. And it was good.
Cas looked like he wanted to say something, but Dean shook his head. No, he didn’t want to talk now, he had to savor this moment as long as he could. He pulled Cas closer to him. Surreal about the whole situation was that Dean felt like a different person.
Maybe one of the reasons he provoked Cas so often was because Dean needed to have this one person in his life, who told him when he behaved like an asshole. Dean was such a twisted person, no wonder Cas was angry at him.
Their lunch date was so beautiful. The food tasted delicious and – as usual – they had lots to talk about. They talked about places they had already traveled to and areas they still wanted to see. Although Dean felt a slight twinge while retelling tales because so much of his travels so far had been professional, he enjoyed talking about it with Cas.
“Oh man, what are they up to?“ First Benny insisted for weeks that there was no way they could skip this great friends‘ day, and then he disappeared before it even started.
The evening was well advanced, and he had busy days ahead of him. He spent the rest of the evening writing, because in this way he could indulge in the illusion that he could simply write away his worries. In the process, he typed away into the blue, letting his creativity drive him.
In the impala, Dean also told him once more to live a normal life while sitting so Dean-like in the driver’s seat, with his thighs spread, that Castiel admired him for his strength. On top of that, Castiel simply wanted to ask how exactly he was supposed to achieve that. He wanted to grab Dean, demanding him to answer, but he refrained from doing so. Suddenly the car was too tight, and he panicked. After a few minutes, Castiel clicked his tongue.
As if of his own accord, he reached for Cas’s hand, stroking the back of it. As he did so, he felt as warm and comfortable as if he were sitting at home in front of his fireplace. A smile quickly turned into a wide beam that he just couldn’t get off his face. And he didn’t want to either. Cas caught his gaze, studied his features, and smiled at him so genuinely that his heart was in his mouth.
All notes contained the same message, just worded differently. And in every note the words "Angel" and "car" had been highlighted with a green marker pen, therefore the addressee, him, would see the relevant words immediately.
He thought of Cas’s past with all the hurdles, with the homophobic assholes, with the fear of coming out. He thought of Cas’s parents, who had turned out to be quite the assholes in real life, and who had caused Cas so much grief since he had come out. It hurt him how much pain Cas felt just for standing by his identity.
Dean groaned and sat up, taking in the surroundings. He was in a living room, currently sitting on a sofa. He recognized a desk, a secretary, like in those old movies, a comfortable leather armchair.
In fact, "Rebel Without a Cause“ is even one of the movies I know. I’m grateful that you shared your take on it because now I’ve gained a different connection to it. Two days ago, I watched the film - as I already wrote to you in my short message - and was emotionally involved. Thank you for this recommendation.

"You don’t have time to take care of such a big cactus. Isn’t a small one enough for your windowsill?“
Cas was so right for him. Good. Cas understood him, he got him and this life, Dean didn’t understand how or why Cas tried to grasp him in the first place – but it was the truth. Maybe having gripped his soul a.k.a. the profound bond thing was responsible for this as well. At this thought, the corners of his mouth turned up.
Was he still himself or had he become himself again just now?
The first kiss. Well, I can justifiably say that it was not what a young man searching for his identity had fantasized at night. It was a cliché: spin the bottle. In college, I wasn’t exactly what you’d call a party animal, yet my friends made me break out of my comfort zone every once in a while. The party was at the dorm where my best friend lived.
Dammit, Angel was such an adorable dork. Dean had to swallow.
"This is not the way to...“
"All right, sweetheart. You can choose. Either you order the thing you want or you let me give you the Dean-Winchester-feast-treatment.“
Although he only used his acumen in private now, he enjoyed still being able to in this way. He always looked for opportunities to sharpen his wits. Without Bobby, he would never have gotten into college in the first place. At the age of 26 Bobby had given him a harsh speech, telling him he was wasting his life at his father’s stupid "missions“. The fact Dean still flinched at the term his dad had used instead, really showed what a mess he was.
Shaking his head, Dean returned to the moment.
After 10 minutes of driving or so Cas made a confused noise. "Why aren’t we driving into town? The Christmas trees are there.“ Dean fiddled with the radio and searched for a station. "That’s right. Still, I wanted to do this thing differently.“ He coughed and damn, he shouldn’t always feel uncertain when doing something nice.
I miss the years I’ve had with her. I miss the person she could’ve been for me. I miss the future we never had. I miss that she never saw me grow up, that she never saw what I was capable of. And I miss someone inside my family to be proud of me, not to condemn me. I have Bobby, yes, and he’s so frigging awesome and I wouldn’t be the same without him, but still. My mom’s my mom. And in quiet moments I think, I hope that despite all the guilt I’ve assembled I’m entitled to miss her.“
More and more until the instruments vanished, leaving behind Plant’s voice only. Until his voice and Dean’s breathing synchronized. Until they became one. Until Dean was like the mentioned rock, not rolling away out of fears anymore. Until he felt grounded. At peace for now.
You are the one, my love for you is true
"C’mon. Let’s breathe some fresh air, yeah?“
He tipped the contents onto the floor. Various resins, stones and branches. But most noticeable were two small carvings, a bear and a fox. They did not look perfect, but were clearly recognizable as the animals. Of course, Dean knew immediately that the forest animals stood for the two brothers. Dean was inevitably touched because David and Michael had such a close brotherly relationship.
Bobby shrugged his shoulders. At the same time, he grinned so broadly that you would have thought he had won the lottery. “You were saying?“
Castiel knew something profound had occurred the day he had found the notes in the library. Call it fate, an ethereal power planning for them to meet, a pull stronger than a magnet, or the best coincidence Castiel could ever have wished for: In fact, the exact definition didn’t carry grave importance.
Dammit. Accidentally, he had put on his playlist Angel Traxx And now, this song that he had listened to in some night-time-yearning-hours intensified his pain. However, he didn’t possess the strength to pause the song. His mind rattled.
"Is this a serious question?“ Cas finally groaned in disbelief. "At first, you looked at me like I’m about to kill you. I had to check if I’m sending off crazy vibes.“
“’Kay, then. Shoot 'cause I’m kinda in the middle of something here.“ He winced at his words, trying to ignore the fact he wasn’t really into this thing with Anna.
"Dean,“ Cas whispered hoarsely, and his voice made Dean look up, caused him to watch his face intensely. The familiar features calmed Dean, in a way he had never dared to hope for. A question was written all over Cas’s face, something he didn’t say out loud. What was it?
A few weeks ago, Sam had said he didn’t want to talk to him and that he definitely didn’t want to see him. After everything.
“Like a Dream” by Francis & the Lights (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqhaMewA2K0)
Thank you for reading! Please let me know what you think. :)
Cas nodded, a small smile was painted on his lips. Dean couldn’t talk further, couldn’t say he wanted this in the future. His actions and gestures should be obvious, he thought. Cas was an angel, but he was on earth long enough.
He HAD intended to say "friend“, and instead this had happened. No more booze until they had their movie night, he decided.
“It’s gonna be okay, man,” Dean whispered softly.
Meanwhile, Castiel had sat down at the table, folding his hands in front of him. Many seconds passed without a single word being said, and Castiel strongly suspected this was not the ideal way this conversation could go.
"If you like it, I wear the belt today. Gotta make a good impression out there, right?“ He didn’t specify who exactly he wanted to impress, but he thought it might have been noticeable in his voice.
As he slowly woke up the next morning, he felt Dean’s breath on his neck. Dean’s arms were enclosing his upper body, and after a small movement on his part, he instinctively pulled Castiel closer to him. Although it was unusual for him to wake up so close to another person and not alone, he felt immensely comfortable.
Crowley was waiting outside the large front door and had dressed even fancier than usual for the appointment. The suit showed at first glance how much money it had cost, and the matching patent leather shoes completed his business look just perfectly. In contrast, Castiel felt almost underdressed in his shirt, jacket and suit pants.
"Should tell me my features as well.“
Right. Dean wasn’t allowed to upset him, to pick a fight. They would talk the issue out like two adults. They would either go their separate ways after a few minutes or talk for a while longer, finally spending time together again.
In the next few minutes, he wrote these thoughts to Angel, describing to him what was going on inside him. Only rudimentary, since he had really wanted to focus on Angel’s situation. Still, it did him good to talk a bit more openly about his emotional state.
Without warning, Cas reached for his hand and laid it on the ground. Dean vehemently ignored the tingling on the back of his hand. "Do you discern that?“
Dean swallowed hard. He looked to the side. Cas showed no emotion, probably didn’t know the song. But Dean knew the song, and how he knew it. Even though Nutini had written it about a woman, it was so easy to replace "she“ with "he“ in his mind. And so tears formed in his eyes as soon as he heard the first notes. "
They kissed and kissed and kissed until Castiel’s jaw hurt and lips burned. It was the most delicious pain he ever felt. Still, his body wanted more, demanded almost as much as his heart yearned.
Oh. Castiel had not anticipated that. He had been fairly certain Dean, who was not fond of these kinds of conversations, would remain silent. "For one, I was interested in your opinion.“
"Yeah.“ Dean coughed, and now he did feel embarrassed at last. "Got a problem with that?“ he pumped Cas.
"Come on, let’s keep walking,“ Charlie whispered, and Dean reached for her hand. He was still drifting off, feeling a little sick and woozy at the sight.
"Are you up for some TV?“ Dean required. He stretched, and Castiel’s eyes darted over his upper arms, his back, moved back to his face. "Yes. I cannot concentrate on reading anymore,“ Castiel admitted, leaving unmentioned that it was entirely up to Dean.
*"imprisoned by my doubt“ → a line from the song I mentioned: Crossroads by Calvin Russell
Where the hell was the bathroom? Once the guys got over the element of surprise, they would surely be on the lookout for them. Would try to beat them up outside, and yeah, Dean could do without that.
Okay. Damn rude. Not only did this lady talk about him as if he wasn’t present, no, she also insulted him immediately. Wow. That was just terrific. Such behavior made him angry, not only because he was familiar with it, but also because it was so illogical.
That was so fucked up, and Dean wouldn’t be able to simply forget that.
I think about standing next to you at the box office while you enthusiastically study the scoreboards and brochures to find the perfect movie. You would look at me, explain to me why we should go see this particular movie, have a bright smile (which I’m sure is dazzling) while doing so, and convince me by that alone.
The moment the demon had decided to kill him, Dean had woken up. Tears running down his face, he had needed a few minutes to convince himself that his Cas, the real Cas, was still alive.
Dean felt his and Cas’s tears wetting his skin, felt his lips twisting into a smile, felt his breath, his lips now breathing a kiss on his skin, his lips saying something. He only noticed the vibration of Cas’s deep voice at first, until Cas lifted his head slightly, still merged skin on skin with him. And then he heard it: "
Perhaps she was looking for the right person to brief him. Then Castiel heard a shout. "Marlin! Where the hell are you?“ Charlie really was a wild one. Laughing, Castiel shook his head, ignoring the awkwardness he felt. In social situations like this he often felt the urge to vanish. A few times he tapped the soles of his feet on the ground until he heard Charlie’s voice again. She was still looking for this Marlin, apparently.
"Dean, this is— When did you have the time to...? Since when are you so—?“
“No, Dean. Why would I be happy about you being miserable?” Cas’ lips trembled and he flared his nostrils. Soon, his head moved closer into Dean’s personal space. Dean fixated his eyes and fought a battle with his inner demons.
Cursing, he reached for the device, wincing briefly as he looked at the display. Dad. Fuck, that was all he needed.
Thank you for your warm and encouraging words, your sincerity and your effort to comfort me. I’ll be honest, I was at a crappy low point. Again. I don’t know how I always manage to get myself deeper into the shit. I guess it’s just my nature. Anyway, I resolved to at least not completely drag down the mood today.
"A sex dream?“ he blurted.
Dean had beaten up Cas horribly, almost to death, and Cas was still here, still cared about him. Why? Why would he stay? Dean had always wanted him to stay, but now he felt like a case of guardianship, someone who needed to be observed.
he went jogging, before he drove to work. To wake up and recharge his batteries for the day and simply to escape the hectic pace of everyday life. Between the dense foggy clouds the ochre-colored rock towered majestically. The mornings were cold and it already smelled like winter. Rain drops covered the dirty road that led into the woods.
Dean held out his hand. "Deal.“ Cas grinned and returned the handshake. With that, the awkward outburst was settled.
Dean’s face reddened, and suddenly he felt hot as if he was standing in front of a bonfire. "Pal, those aren’t mine. I bought them for you the other day.“ He coughed, fiddling with the bag again.
Balthazar cleared his throat. "I’m just saying that I learned what this can lead to. One of my clients thought she found true love online. A dating platform. They texted each other. So much. They were writing raunchy messages to each other. Do you know what it all led to? He got her to send her most of her savings, and on top of that, used naked pictures of her as a means of blackmail. This will be a tough case in court because he covered his tracks so well. I’m just saying, watch your back.“
"Shit, Cas. You’re so amazing, so, so frigging wonderful. Look at you. Nobody’s like you,“ Dean murmured, and Castiel’s body trembled, this time with endorphins and bliss.
He didn’t know how to deal with it, having avoided even reflecting about such feelings for so long. But they couldn’t disappear completely, now that Dean had escaped from the deafness.
She winked at him, sweetly, yet cheekily, and now Dean knew for certain she had been dazzling back in her days. They exchanged some more words before they parted ways again.
"Castiel.“ Again he used Cas‘ full name, he didn’t know why exactly, just knew that he was so emotionally charged right now that everything inside him was rumbling and wanted to surface.
"Howsoever, I am aware you feel guilt because the Darkness is released, terrorizing the earth now. You feel like you failed nonetheless.“
Enjoy! :)
For a brief moment Castiel was befuddled, almost forgetting everything else except Dean. Now Dean pressed a loving kiss on his lips and immediately proceeded to kiss him passionately and wonderfully gently, driving him crazy. Castiel enjoyed these moments, every time he enjoyed them and they were always new to him.
"Your most attractive feature. It’s your frigging character, all right?“ Dean quickly averted his eyes, clicking his tongue as if being annoyed at himself for saying this wonderful remark.
"I’m gonna cook on Christmas, give me some suggestions if you fancy, but I’m gonna make the last call.“ Another thing to think about: Which food was Christmassy and also tasty? He needed something to show his cooking skills a bit. Cas didn’t need to eat obviously. Still, Dean was pretty sure Cas would try anything he would prepare. And that was a thing which made him happy.
Dean continued walking through the corridors of this dimly lit, run-down building, smelling rotten. Decay. The building was past its prime. Irreparable, no longer restored to its former state. Exactly like Dean himself.
What? No. That would mean he wasn’t crazy. That would mean-. But no. That was impossible. Right?
"I’m not dirty,“ Cas protested and stood up. Dean snorted at that because from their snogging he knew damn well how dirty Cas could get. He knocked some earth off his trouser leg and kneaded his hands. "Well, I do need a shower. Gotta smell good for our trip, right?“ Cas simply narrowed his eyes at the remark, which made Dean laugh way too hard.
Castiel was confused, so he filled in bits of information everywhere, leaving questions or comments where he was at a loss. He wouldn’t use this profile anyway, just wanted to know if the other person was still registered there. Since he was named after an angel, he used the nickname "AngelMuses“ without further ado.
"No doctor!“ She winced, sliding backward with widened eyes, but Dean gently held her hand. "Please don’t, I’ll be fine.“
Dean couldn’t stand it anymore, having the same conversations over and over. Again and again feeling the guilt, again and again suffering from the pain. He wanted to disappear from his body, wished he could just vanish like a ghost. “Just tell me what you want.“
I hope I didn’t offend you too much with that. I just think that you deserve to have someone tell you that you are not just there for others to benefit from you and your achievements and intelligence.
Dean turned on the TV, flopped down on the bed, and moved back and forth until he had assumed an obviously comfortable position in front of the pillows. Castiel rose as well.
Nonetheless, he bolted upright a bit, kissed Cas‘ temple and finally started the movie. Cas chuckled, enclosing Dean’s thighs with his very possessively.
"But mom, the cactus would fit so well next to my desk. I’ll do my homework right after, too.“
Dean made an apologetic gesture towards Cas because he felt very embarrassed. It would be good if he gained distance from this scene, he should let the family have their privacy. While he was still debating how to get up from the abandoned chairs unnoticed and leave as quickly as possible, he noticed Cas right next to him. He motioned for him to come along, and okay, now that was a little weird.
Christmas and the holiday season belong to my favorite times of the year. So writing a longer Christmas fic for these two dumbasses (affectionate!) was such a delight. :))
Finally, he opened the book and enjoyed the thick paper of the pages. Then he registered some words, written with a fountain pen, directly on the first page besides the inside of the book cover.
Black fuzzy hair, dark brown jacket, leather briefcase, fancy trousers. Trench coat over his arm. Even as Dean perceived the appearance, Milton was seen from the front. Dean almost fell off his chair.
"With pleasure.“
He couldn’t believe that he really had met Angel through the unlikely way of handwritten notes, and also had met Cas in real life. He couldn’t believe he had found his real Angel on Earth.
Apparently, he knew Angel. He knew him. Not only from his messages but for real.
"Okay, fantastic. I’ll order some pizza. I’m starving.“ Dean scrolled around on his phone, apparently looking for a nearby pizza place that offered delivery service.
"We’re not exactly talking in private here. I, um, might have accidentally turned on the speaker, and cannot turn it off anymore.“ That wasn’t a lie, not really. He could turn it off, but then he would have to leave his very comfortable position between Cas’s legs. And oh, that was so not gonna happen.
"Where do I start?“ Cas frowned, and actually thought about it for a beat-up minute.
"I think that’s it. Lie low, go on living your life as normally as possible, and ignore her for now. She’s harmless. I mean, she just talked to you and left, right? Just adores your book - and gay sex, obviously.“
. Can I buy you a coffee to make amends? Oh, and you know what? Here, take this.“ He handed the man 50 dollars and blushed.
In fact, Castiel thought, they were not looking in a different direction at all. In fact, they were still looking at each other, just as spellbound, just as consuming and engaging.
"You heard me.“
Without a warning Dean crashed his mouth onto his, claiming him, immediately licking Castiel’s lips. One arm was wrapped around Castiel’s waist, and Dean pressed himself into him so urgently there was no space left between them anymore.
Dean helps a stranded girl and mixes well with her. Later that day, Cas calls Dean, and they have a clarifying conversation.
Dean crossed his arms in front of his chest and grinned.
"Beg your pardon? What the fuck, Cas? Then I would go to a bar and hit on somebody. Except some random person would NEVER be you. And oh, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I haven’t done that for months now, so spare me with your rubbish excuses. Screw you, Cas, really.“ He hung up, and his chest burned.
"How ‘bout cookies?“ he said out of context and watched their reactions. They both only stared at him, though, and seemed to be at a loss for words. "Baking. I thought we could make Christmas cookies tomorrow,“ he grumbled because he certainly wouldn’t suggest it a second time. Sam watched him curiously, but Cas smiled broadly. Well, that was a start. "I think that’s a wonderful idea,“ Cas replied, and Sam nodded.
Dean flinched at the thought of dad hitting him in the face several times. He took a deep breath, and Cas looked at him so reassuringly.
Afterwards, their baking marathon started, and that wasn’t an exaggeration. They made so much dough they easily could’ve fed 10 more persons with it. When they could finally cut the cookies, Cas got so fucking eager Dean almost kissed him on the forehead right there in the kitchen. While Sam made some respectable spritz cookies, Cas announced he would roll the pastry. He took the first dough out of the bowl and massacred it with the rolling pin.
"But my heart was already yours.“ The sincerity in Cas‘ voice made his heart stumble.
Every action, every word, which somehow showed his real feelings took so much effort, and it was difficult to act on his feelings, as he tried to, and still not knowing how Cas felt. Cas processed everything so differently, maybe the emotions he felt weren’t comparable to the ones humans had normally. Dean shook his head, since it definitely wasn’t the right moment to overthink this stuff. He just wanted to be now.
For a change, he would save no one.
They stare into each other’s eyes, so intensely and passionately that any fire would have fled as quickly as possible at the sight of them. Their faces come closer and closer. The angel's breath is a gentle breeze on his face, his smile melting Dean like butter in the sun.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sounds like the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard. What’s the catch?“ Castiel frowned, certainly not wanting to discuss now that initiating an online acquaintance was dangerous and often hopeless.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then the song started playing again, and Dean felt crazy. In a good way.
Wanted to pretend that they hadn’t treated Dean like a blunt instrument. Like that was his only worth.
Castiel breathed. Inhaled, exhaled, inhaled, exhaled. The way he had done his entire life, the way he had done for 33 years. Breathing was natural, it happened automatically, it was in his genes. He didn’t need to think about it. He just did.
Perfect timing. Dean took a deep breath, as if he was about to jump into a battle. Or about to plung into a passionate night of love. He contorted his face – because oh no, no, no – wrong time for such an inner cinema.
Dean sniffled, and due to the awesome luck he always had, now, the frigging tears returned he had wanted to avoid at all costs. The tears ran down his cheeks. Salt, again he tasted salt. A few seconds later he was sobbing, howling his head off, wanting only to cry and run away. He was so weak.
For example, on a tranquil Sunday a few months back, Castiel and Dean had researched for a case in the kitchen. Eventually, Dean had cooked pancakes, and had asked Castiel whether he, as the undisputed bee expert, thought there was anything better than letting the taste of honey combined with a small portion of whipped cream linger on one’s tongue. While saying this remark, he had watched Castiel curiously and licked his lips which had carried the most dazzling smile.
The pace slowed, they drove slower and slower until they finally came to a complete stop.
First things first. Check-in.
Castiel inhaled sharply because he had never heard the dean talk like that. "Mr. Novak - Castiel,“ the dean continued. "What do you see behind me?“
Dean smiled. “Thanks, I hope we can add a little more charm here.“ Slowly, he turned to the side to get a better look at her. She had stopped in the doorway, seemingly undecided whether to follow Andrea or stay put.
Dean ran through the forest for another hour, making his way through the trees. Just as he was on his way back and had almost reached the spot where Baby was parked, he suddenly heard a voice.
He couldn’t help but take in the absurd dimensions of their conversation. Again Dean studied the paper, and his grin grew wider and more liberated by the second.
The best thing about their friendship was that they were so different and thus complemented each other so well. Benny needed someone to rein him in now and then, but also to support him in his sometimes insane ideas.
"Your lip chewing. Very distracting. Can hardly take my eyes off your lips.“
(See the end of the chapter for
The man clicked his tongue, again grinning broadly. "I’m not sure I’ve got rescuing a damsel in distress on my vita.“
"Damn, I wish I’d look that good with dirt all over me,“ Dean said out loud, only half joking. Sam mumbled something that sounded a lot like "kinks“, and Cas, he seemed to be… flustered? No, that couldn’t be the case, perhaps he thought Dean was a crazy person and talking nonsense again.
Here comes chapter 26. :)
"I know, I know. I deserve good things, I get it.“ Dean raised both hands in the air, and winked at Cas. "No need for fighting today, alright? We’re gonna have an awesome day.“
He took two fingers and whistled once. Just a few seconds later, Lucky ran up to him, who had visibly enjoyed himself in nature. Dean hummed, and shook his head with a laugh.
Cas smiled at him, returning the handshake before pulling him into a hug. And here in this situation, after their encounters so far, Dean kinda hoped that maybe they would become friends. It would do him good to have someone else to talk to so openly.
His brother giving him money to spend on a stripper. Dean’s disgust must’ve been visible on his face because Sam sighed heavily and looked at the ceiling. "It’s about Cas.“
“Mm, that is indeed a first,“ Dean replied dryly, annoyed that he had not been present. A vocal performance from a musical movie, that was new. Instantly, he had an earworm.
The bacon cheeseburger must’ve been Cas‘ clever idea of giving Dean a second piece of his favorite food without him actually ordering one. He remembered one time the two of them had been in a diner and the chef told them they could play for a gratis burger. Suddenly he’d been in a competition, and he’d won the second burger and it had tasted so much better than his actual food. Holy shit, how could Cas remember all of that stuff?
In fact, it had been the second time he had discussed with her over the past week – the first time being the morning after his library adventure. He had been so annoyed after the call he had shortly considered not leaving the house – but he had needed some groceries.
"Hey, you saved me that day. And you have an awesome stereo that produces beautiful sounds. Plus, you write your stuff there, so that’s the entire truth. Don’t contradict me on this, I have made up my mind.“
"I am gay,“ it then shot out of Castiel, still fixing his eyes on the shelf. "Since you offered me the job at the time, it never really came up why I left the old job. I think I told you about how the job didn’t fulfill me anymore, and it wasn’t right for me. That’s true, too, but probably only scratches the surface.“
Momentarily, his breathing quickened and he leaned against Dean’s torso as his rambler breathed kisses onto his neck. His skin caught fire again and every place he touched tingled immensely. Dean’s hands, meanwhile, had ventured under his shirt to his bare skin and continued to move upward. Castiel turned so that he could look at him, and their mouths melted into a kiss.
Again everything spun, and he sank to the ground, feeling as if quicksand was pulling him further and further down, taking away all control of his body.
In between all the angst I wanted the scavenger hunt to be something hopeful. So it's fluffy again. This fic still has several chapters left, by the way. :)
"I want you to know that I’m serious about us. I—“ Dean cleared his throat again and clicked his tongue softly. "Man, I really suck at this,“ he cursed. Cas was the person he imagined his "ever after" with, and this was frigging terrifying.
“It was so captivating. I’m sorry I was such a bitch. You- There was this part about the young woman and I felt reminded of myself. And I realized some things. Castiel, I-” Suddenly she burst into tears, and Dean felt uneasy. As if he was disturbing a very important private moment between the siblings.
(See the end of the chapter for
He pressed “send“ and regretted the text immediately. Sure, that hadn’t sounded desperate at all. But he missed his best friend, and he was tired of pretending he didn’t want Cas here all the time. He sighed and sipped his coffee, reflecting on the tasks for today. Maybe he should look for another hunt after all, he definitely needed to distract his mind.
They were watching a drama, Into the Wild, and the theme of breaking out of the usual and the little stories the protagonist experienced on his journey, the people he met, caused a whirlpool of emotions.
Dean carried his regular clothes around in a fortunately not so conspicuous shopping bag. As he strolled the streets, he definitely felt different. Again, he put on his headphones, listening to "Footloose" by Kenny Loggins which always lifted his spirits.
Snorting, Dean shook his head, and they painted the rest of the room without much exchange of words.
"Gabriel. I haven’t had sexual intercourse in a while because of all the appointments. I’ve been reflecting on the subject in general.“ Now this had really sounded like pseudo-intellectual excuses, Castiel observed.
In the afternoon they decorated their Christmas tree. Initially, they put fairy lights on there, so many of them. Cas was beaming at every light which found its place on the tree. "We are able to bring illumination, more brightness into the world.“ Dean’s body felt warm, and he was so frigging smitten with Cas. Little moments like this only intensified the sentiment.
The letters and mails will be an essential part of the fic though.
Damn, the use of language is phenomenal. The descriptions are so precise, beautiful and captivating. Some of the first-person narrator’s thought streams are so familiar to me, or rather the way they develop. It was illuminating.
"Yeah,“ Dean replied hoarsely. "He is. Can you tell Sammy I said Hi at least?“
"Good morning, darling. How’s our prodigy on this wonderful morning?“ As always, Crowley appeared completely focused, nothing could shake his determination and professionalism. His lips carried the usual slightly ironic smile, but Castiel knew how to handle Crowley’s behavior.
“Don’t make it sound like an insult. The fact that you trust me of all people is an honor. And I will cherish this gift every day.”
They talked about how his work was commonly classified as apolitical and associated with escapism because of the strong wardrobe metaphor. At this, Dean interjected the short phrase, "It’s about creating a sweet harmony between reality and fantasy“ which somehow stuck with Castiel.
"All I want for Christmas and beyond is you, Cas.“
They visited each other regularly, and also had dinner together once a month. Now that he had moved back here, they saw each other even more often. Castiel was happy about that, because he always had a lot of fun with his older brother. On this day, however, he wasn’t in the mood for family. He patted down his pants and took off his gloves.
They had stools and two awesome leather armchairs, but they were three people, and he couldn’t exactly tell Cas to sit on his lap while watching TV. His face turned red at the thought. Hence he talked to Sammy and told him they had an emergency. They took Baby, drove to the furniture store and purchased a sofa.
Castiel was still sleep-deprived, could not rest anymore. In addition, his office hours had been exhausting. So many freshmen had shown up that two hours had turned into four. Normally, he did not extend the regular office hours if no appointments had been made beforehand.
He looked at Cas, and if he hadn’t known better, he could’ve sworn Cas was embarrassed. Cas cleared his throat and nodded delayed, barely noticeable. Dean shook his head in frustration. This strategy wasn’t working at all.
"I agree, by the way,“ Dean said, winking at Castiel. "I wouldn’t exchange Baby for any other car. She’s the best.“
(The chapter title was inspired by the song "Take Me For A Ride" by Holy Oysters. It also fits Dean’s mood and gives strong Destiel vibes, just saying. https://youtu.be/z1Qj4aYaODU)
Adventure and rebellion all well and good, but she might have to wait a few more years until the next one. "Check. Now will you tell me what’s going on?“
I mean, I was 6, that happened over two decades ago. I still hear dad’s voice in my head though, probably because he kept repeating the words over and over in a modified form the following years. Dad said, "This is your fault, Dean, this happens when you’re selfish. Mom's dead because of you.“
Why was it important that Dean knew? Why? Right now, the surrounding noise hindered him from thinking further.
Instead, Dean thought about getting hugged, the most meaningful comfort he knew, which he had experienced in his early twenties for the first time in his life. When he had gotten to know Bobby better. His heart hurt and smiled simultaneously.
"Holy shit, Cas, you’re driving me up the wall here. You gotta stop looking at me like that, I mean it.“
He felt bold and gave in because otherwise he’d probably never move a step forward.
“Um. I’m gonna get some fresh air. You guys talk.” Never had he expected such a positive reaction. Had Hannah really come to her senses? Due to Cas’s devout father, of all people? How was this reality?
He shot the photo because he feared he would have an emotional meltdown. Dean knew Angel would like the photo.
"See? I get your man.“
"Convert. From what?“ The young woman let her gaze sweep over him again. Not suggestively, just curious and inquiring. "Oh, I get it.“ Now, inexplicably, she gave a thumbs-up.
Out of all things reading had always been Sam’s thing. His little brother was the nerd after all. Still, over the years their roles had changed somehow. Sam had accepted his role as a hunter more willingly than Dean had ever been able to. Sure, he loved the job, and killing monsters always gave him peace of mind. They saved people and prevented some evil bastards from doing more harm.
It was a hot summer day, I was in a great mood, ready to leave my bad experiences behind. At this point, my breakup was a few months behind me. I’m not sure how much you want to know about this painful part of my story, so I’ll leave it out at this point.
“I see,“ Dean replied, not knowing what to say next. Failed relationships were not among his favorite topics. As they probably were for 80% of the world’s relationship-capable population.
