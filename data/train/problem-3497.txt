That was the second time today someone had tried to convince Dean he’d be getting the better of the two twins. He didn’t buy it though, not when Jimmy was so kind.
“Did you just Princess Bride me?” Dean asked. At night, they’d worked hard filling in the gaps in Castiel’s popular knowledge left there by his focus nothing but education for so long. They’d watch The Princess Bride a few days back and Cas had been quite taken with it in a way he hadn’t been with most of Dean’s choices.
He did eventually fall asleep and didn’t wake until it was dark outside. On the other side of his door, he could hear music and laughter, the sounds of a crowd. It was a bar after all. He only woke because Bobby entered the room with an armful of blankets, comforters and even some of those fake fur throw blankets, He tossed them down on desk and sniffed the air.
The snow started perhaps an hour after they’d set out, pretty little drifting flurries at first, but soon gathering force. Within half an hour, the snow whipped around them furiously, not a blizzard yet. He could still see the track under Impala’s hooves and for a while up ahead, but it was heavy, wet snow, getting him damp quickly, chilling him. They could only take so much of it, even staying on the move wouldn’t kept them warm after a while. They’d freeze to death out here at this rate.
It was then that Castiel’s eyes settled on the room off the kitchen. Dean’s office. There was also a formal ranch corporation office on the property, but most of the actual book work of the ranch got done there. On the desk, what Castiel mostly seemed to be looking at, was a big, black telephone.
“I’m just saying that you should consider it,” Michael said. “You have few enough friends at court.”
It was a big, family affair. Everyone was there, all pretending to be ecstatically happy that Michael was marrying Dean. Much was made of Dean’s looks. While it was true that there probably wasn’t a prettier Omega in Lebanon, it was spoken quite a lot more than truly necessary by the family. It was said so much to justify the fact that Dean’s background was best ignored, or at least that’s what Castiel’s family did. Went on and on about how beautiful Dean was, even though Castiel knew for a fact that pretty much everyone from Chuck, the family patriarch to Zachariah had told Michael not to marry Dean, because he wasn’t from a quality background.
“Hey now, none of that,” Bobby said, as Dean started shaking, overwhelmed with emotion. “It’s going to be okay now.”
“Easy, Cas,” Dean said when Cas pulled him closer yet, as if he were about to devour him or something. “Easy. I want you too.”
Angel stepped up to the podium, “Firstly, I wish to apologize for the unnecessary distress and worry that I have caused to so many during my recent absence.”
It was everything Castiel had ever wanted. He shed his clothes quickly wanting to be naked with Dean, bare to him in all ways. Wanted to start showing the love that he had felt since his hand first touched Dean. He just hoped that Dean was ready to receive it.
Castiel spoke cautiously, “There is an Omega that I love dearly, but I don’t think he wants to mate me. You know, I think I promised you a shopping trip and dinner. Perhaps we should get a move on.”
“Ash and me LARP together,” Charlie said. “You could come. I think you’d have fun. No. I know you would have an awesome time. You probably already have the clothes for it.”
More mildly, Jimmy added. “The younger son almost always ate too. It wasn’t solely an issue of poverty, though it sounds like there was some of that too.”
When he saw that, some knot inside of him that had been drawn tight for nine months loosened. They were going to be okay, all of them. Him, Castiel and the Bean. He was able to relax and slip back into a deep, comfortable sleep.
“Perhaps more the enemy of my enemies,” Castiel admitted. “But the Devils have been broken. That would be several of them she’s bringing in for the reward, including Lucifer. I gather the reward was still wanted dead or alive.”
He had to clear his head. He couldn’t go to Folsom and find Dean and try to talk to him when he was like this. It would be a tactical error. A delay in the apology that was owed would be bad, but trying to deliver it when his head was so foggy like this? Far, far worse. He did the only thing he knew would clear his head- went on patrol. Alone. Setting himself a punishing, demanding pace, one that very few people could keep up with.
Castiel thought. “The redhead? She’s packless. Was it wise for you to allow Dean to spend time with a packless Beta?”
The threat still hanging, Sam left, with Dean. It took a while for their scents to fade, but he helped it along, opening windows, spraying scent blockers. He sighed as he worked, willing the pain in his chest to subside. He would not die from not claiming his mate, he told himself. It was what was best for Dean and that was what mattered most. Cas dragged the plastic tub of panties from under his bed and without opening it up, carried it down the hallway to the garbage room. He dumped it, plastic tub and all, into the compactor. Back in his condo, he deleted links to the chat service, cleared his internet history, did everything he could to wipe that particular slate clean.
Castiel’s eyes traveled from the ground, up the length of Dean’s body, where they lingered longer than was decent on the way his sweat had that undershirt clinging to his chest and abdomen. He took a drag and forced himself to meet Dean’s eyes—he had taken off his sunglasses and hung them on his shirt—and very nearly lost all sense of self-control. It would be so easy to just…
So when Dean finally wakes up, smiles at him sleepily before he ambles to the bathroom, he reaches under his pillow and sends up a little prayer for himself.
Castiel took a drink of his coffee and they ate in silence for some time before he asked the question that had been crowding his thoughts all morning, “Have you ever been with anyone else before?”
“You absolutely can,” Dean said. “It’s not a big deal. Things just lined up. Ever since you told me you sold your old bike, I haven’t been able to get it off my mind. You know, it- it brought you to me, and I know how much you loved it, so I wanted you to have one again. And then Jack turned up, and it just seemed right, you know?”
Dean shrugged again, and leaned against the wall next to the other side of  the window. There was maybe a foot and half of space between them.  “I wasn’t sure how good of a poker face you had. It was easier if you didn’t know. Now I know. It’s terrible.” He smiled and swatted Castiel’s knee with the back of his hand, “It was fun though, wasn’t it? Once you knew. I’d say we could do it again, but you’d probably blow our cover.”
As it happened, an hour turned into two; two turned into three; and three became dawn before Castiel was driving himself and Anna back to town in her car. He’d had a few drinks, but along with his chain smoking, he was more or less known for his high tolerance for alcohol, so he didn’t end up as wasted as Gabriel would have liked. Anna, could hold her own, and she frequently partook in drinking competitions, which had been exactly why he was always reluctant to leave her alone any time they all went out together. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust the others to look after her, or that he didn’t trust her to look after herself, but that he knew he’d never be able to forgive himself if anything ever did happen to her when he should have been there. She could also be a bit of a handful when she drank, and Castiel was just the most used to keeping her in line.
Dean collected himself a little, pulled away from him enough to wipe his eyes and nose. “Sammy’ll probably be back soon. We should clean up.”
Castiel dropped by the shop after work, half convinced that if he showed up any sooner than he had, Dean’s affection for him would have evaporated and left him right back where he started, and he didn’t think he could stomach that.
Once he’d found a place for himself, gotten established, he’d written to Dean too. Nearly every day for two and a half years. Some of those letters were even tearstained. None of them were signed with anything more damning than ‘Your friend, Cas.’ And none of them had been sent. Or, at least, they hadn’t been sent until he’d found out he was going to Vietnam.
Castiel sat at the bar and sipped his coffee, his heart rate up from what it had been when he started. He had no problem getting in a fight, even pulling a knife if he needed to, but this was something scarier. He wasn’t particularly daring when it came to getting close to people, even his relationship to Anna had been born of proximity rather than any effort on his part. She had approached him. And here he was planning to actively foster a friendship with the Winchester brothers, which was something he never would have imagined himself doing before.
He knew it was a terrible, frightening idea. He had been prepared to reject the request, if for no other reason than to keep a short leash on his own desires. He might run with hoods, but he didn’t consider himself particularly reckless. Self-preservation, or at least the preservation of the Garrison, was usually at the fore with any action he made. But even before he had gotten to know Dean at all, he had known he would be weak to any request he made of him, and so he nodded just once. He thought this was what it would feel like walking himself and his gang into an inferno.
“There’s nothing between me and Anna. Like I told you, she’s like my sister.” Castiel tried not to sound snappish. He wasn’t a moony teenager, and he had no business getting worked up just because Dean paid someone else a few compliments.
Castiel reached for a cigarette, stuck it unlit between his lips, “No. I’m fine. Thanks. I’ll find you guys later,” he told him evenly. Gabe didn’t seem like he quite believed him, but after a pause seemed to accept that was the only answer he was likely to get out of him and headed for Inias’s pickup. Castiel waited for him to disappear from sight completely before he turned and headed in the opposite direction. He’d take the long way home, past the drugstore and the school. He could pick up more cigarettes. He was down to his last two, which was why he hadn’t quite been able to bring himself to light the one he had pulled out after he left work.
“You sure you don't want me to just drive you to your place? It's really not a big deal. I can leave Sammy here and drop you off and then swing back by for him if you’re worried about too many people seeing where you live or something.” Dean approached him, and Castiel fought the urge to immediately cross the lot and put as much space between them as humanly possible.
Dean laughs, and Castiel imagines that this time it sounds less hollow than the one he had witnessed from afar probably had.
his head, visibly deeply disappointed in himself and looks his brother dead in the eyes. "He died Sammy... Cas died to protect me."
Dean, who successfully fought his tears raises his head in confusion. "I thought you don't want to help us."
Dean's heart is pumping heard, he can feel a adrenaline rush in every fibre of his body. There is a chance to bring him back?
"Jack?" Castiel exclaimed stunned and darted towards him, pulling him into a hug. Hearing his voice again made Jack's decision so much more worth it. "Hey Dad" Jack said, inhaling Cas' smell. It's been only a day and he still missed him so much. Cas turned to Kelly, smiling at her brightly. "Kelly" he said with a soft heartwarming voice and hugged her tightly. "It's good to see again" expressed Castiel. "Even though I am not sure how I got here." And with that he turned back to Jack, realising that something has changed. He pressed his eyelids together and rubbed his eyebrows. " Jack, your presence feels different... It kind of feels like-" he stopped mid-sentence and shaked his head.
His father didn’t understand. Yes, the life of a ranch hand was hard, even treacherous and dangerous at times, but to Dean, it was freedom. Mating would be the death of that freedom.
He was, ostensibly, a bee-keeper, but he’d never had the heart to raid their hives for the precious honey and beeswax. He pulled out and looked at the frames every now and then, but just often enough to be sure they were doing well, not attacked by colony collapse or varroa mites, taking only enough honey for scant, personal use. Mostly, he left them to their pollinating and gathering of nectar and marveled at how beautiful they were.
Dean’s face was pushed into a firm, lightly haired chest and he was breathing in a scent that was a stranger’s even as it was also a scent that had sunk its hooks deep down into his soul. He could not remember ever waking with another body in his bed and it took a second until his brain helpfully supplied that the Alpha in bed with him was his Alpha. His Castiel. Who was still solidly asleep, snoring a light, gravelly snore, while having claimed the bed’s only pillow for himself and most of the blanket. Just like an Alpha, claiming the best of everything for his own self.
"Not scared of you," Dean said and it mostly wasn't a lie. This was his first time since his change alone with an Alpha who wasn't staff at St. Jensen's. "I want you. Not just because it means I can be with Cas."
“Please, Jimmy, can’t you mate me instead of Castiel?” Dean asked, not even sure where the words were coming from, just that he felt desperate not to mate with Castiel, even knowing there was no way to avoid it. When the Pack Alpha asked for you, you said yes. Castiel wasn’t a bad man. He would give way if his twin asked for Dean instead, wouldn’t he? Especially since he didn’t want this mating either. “I know the law. You can have a Beta and an Omega mate both.”
Amelia took in the scene of the two sets of dishes and forks at the table, “Oh, we should probably make ourselves scarce. I didn’t realize. Jimmy, we should hurry. We should catch the very next shuttle.”
If you really want to leave me a message, comments are open at my sweet, fluffy knit-shop AU “Curse of the Boyfriend Sweater.”
Meanwhile, Balthazar was already on his phone, dialing someone. “Yes, Fergus, lovely to speak with you again. Could you hold for his highness? Yes, he would like to discuss how possible it would be to split off Grace Industries from the Crown Properties.”
“No, that isn’t the way she operates. Slunk off into the night when it was clear which way things were going, yes. Outright betrayal, no. Most likely, the camp was on alert since Azazel returned with a gunshot wound and the story of meeting you on the riverbank. And Meg may surprise us yet.”
The Marshal’s eyes widened a little and then he swallowed hard. Before Dean could get another word out, the man turned his Pinto around and set out on the last stretch to the trading post.
“All my older Alpha brothers went to St. Carver’s,” Castiel said. “I remember visiting day when I was a young pup. We went every month to visit Michael when I was very young.”
He worried about how he was going to tell Castiel he was pregnant when Castiel hadn’t wanted that. He worried about whatever the hell was going on with the veils and the Goddess’s ravens he’d seen this morning.
“Okay, fine, Mario Battali,” Dean said. Cas had shown him a picture of the celebrity chef a while back, wearing bright orange Crocs, apparently his signature footwear. “I’m going for donuts. Just, you know, promise me you won’t wear them to the wedding.”
“Ah, wouldn’t do that if I were you,” the man said. “Your Omega there will be dead before I drop to the ground. Hand it over.”
“Your customs, laws and traditions are your own, Ishim of Eden, and I can have no say in them, however, I would invite you to keep them and your people as far way from me and all that is mine as possible,” Castiel said, the start of the words to the formal social cut. It would give Ishim an opportunity to respond, to make some kind of defense that there had been a misunderstanding, a reason they should not part in this formal way.
Garth stopped by, noticed how perplexed Dean was and chuckled a little. “Yeah, I kinda stared like that the first time I saw the grass. I guess the turf roof is even more traditional than thatched. Supposed to be longer lasting and more insulating than thatch too. More protective from the elements. Someone ought to get those goats off it though. I think we’re supposed to let the turf settle in more before we let them graze. They ought to be in the barn for the night by now anyway.”
For now, Dean knew a place in the Hall that would be private and quiet, he didn’t really belong there but no one else should be using it. There was a little alcove to the south end, under the eaves with a curtain that could be drawn across. Mostly people left that space alone. When they had a mother denning during a Full Moon, as happened sometimes, she or he and the new baby could hole up in there and feel safe and protected. Yes, he found that it was empty.
He was striding to the bedroom, sure to find Cas there, now that Cas had taken up residence in his bed (and hadn’t that turned out to be the greatest thing ever?).  He came across Cas wandering towards the bathroom with a blanket over his shoulder, sniffling and looking miserable. Still, a man had to try.
“Godly people do not live with or mate with Omegas,” Mirabel said. “The Divine makes her displeasure clear.”
“Must think an awful lot of yourself if you think the mere presence of you in my company is enough to tarnish my virtue. Don’t mistake reputation for virtue,” Dean said. He cared little about his reputation and his virtue had always done a damn fine job looking out for itself. Honestly, he could care less about virtue. Not wanting to attach himself to an Alpha had nothing to do with virtue in his case, but about what an Alpha thought that kind of connection meant.
Angel shook his head sadly, “No, I did not conceive your child that night, no matter how much I wished I had. I am putting on a little weight now that I’m out from under my mother’s thumb and I can eat as much as I wish. My assistant Meg assures me it looks good on me, but I’m not certain.”
Castiel was just silent for a moment, then said, “Sometimes those who aren’t the marrying kind change their mind, but circumstances keep them apart from the one they would love.”
He had Azazel in his sights a second later, the heavy, long barreled revolver raised unsteadily in his hand. “Halt! You’re under arrest!” Dean shouted across the river. “The U.S. Marshals are here to arrest you and drag your sorry ass back to justice.”
It was wrong, Castiel always thought, to call him an actor, though there was no better word. He never acted. He just did what he was told and reacted to the other players in the film.
“Dean, it’s okay,” Cas said. “I’m glad you had an orgasm. You should have as many as you want whenever you want. It’s not like you’re an Alpha. It’s not over just because you came. An Alpha comes and he’s done for the day. You’re just getting started. You aren’t getting soft, are you?”
“The dam is fine. We should be heading back,” Jimmy said. “They’ll be closing the Hall before too long.”
“He’s too young,” Gadreel said. “He’s a lovely boy. No Omega in the pack is prettier. I’ll give you that. But he’s weak. He’s been sick and he isn’t fully well. Probably never will be. You can smell it on him. You need a mate that can give you Alpha children. Someone strong and healthy. Someone that won’t die in childbirth.”
Suddenly, he was face to face with his mate, standing less than inches away. Part of him wanted to shout about needing personal space, but the rest of him wanted to close the distance between them, to engage in more of the scenting they had been doing. It just didn’t make sense that he wanted the scent of this Alpha all over him. He didn’t love the Alpha, sometimes didn’t even want to be mated to him, but still, he wanted to be around that scent. Hell, he wanted to kiss the Alpha, which made no sense to Dean, given everything that was going on at the moment.
About six weeks after he arrived, he was sitting at the bar, looking at one of Bobby’s books. He didn’t have a chance in hell of reading the spiky, gothic printing. He was pretty sure it was in German anyway. He liked looking at the primitive woodcut prints of the monsters that illustrated the pages.
Jimmy got a glass out of the cupboard and filled it with water from the sink. Dean wasn’t entirely sure why it was important that there be a glass of water, but it was what they’d agreed on, a signal from Jimmy that he wasn’t taking any of the food that was on the table. He sat on the bench opposite Dean.
“Hey, Dad, look at the both of you,” Garth said with a beaming smile. “We’ve got some things we have to get taken care of for this little angel. You know, just weigh her and get some diapers on her. You just come this way.”
“We have come through the night unharmed and would walk out into the morning sun,” Castiel said. “Unbar the door.”
The tent canvas opened and someone entered the tent without his invitation or permission. It was a burly, bearded man, a doughy but powerful looking Alpha and it took a few minutes for Castiel to place him before he put the revolver that had naturally found its way to his hand back down on the table. He didn’t remember picking it up, but then, it was an automatic reaction. A gun belonged in his hand when an intruder entered. He put it down again as soon as he identified the man.
“I have to stay,” Sam said. “Dean needs me. If it were me in that bed instead of him, he’d have walked to town from the pack lands and banged on the hospital door until they let him stay.”
Anywho. Dean reached for Cas’ full plate, swapped it out with his own now emptied plate, when his phone buzzed. It was tempting to ignore it. At least for a while, but they were in the middle of some important research and Dean and Cas were supposed to just be out on a supply run, not getting beer and burgers at everyone’s favorite place without bringing the rest of the gang.
Dean grabbed Castiel by his string tie and then they were kissing again, lips pressing together as if every moment they had spent apart could be compressed into and compensated by this brief time. Castiel had not kissed anyone else for a long time, not since Meg in that cabin. He’d missed it. Not that he didn’t have his chances but it would not have been right. He knew who his Omega was.
Dean found himself wrapped between the two of them, crushed in a Dean sandwich and he dared, for a little while, to think that maybe, just maybe, it was going to be all right.
Castiel was handsome. So was Jimmy, maybe even more so, the way his sunny disposition shone in his face. Dean always did his best to squash his feelings about that down hard. Jimmy had eyes for no one except Amelia, so Dean didn’t have the slightest hope with him. Castiel had eyes for no one in particular. Everyone talked about Castiel and Hannah, but as far as Dean could tell, Castiel didn’t look at her that way. Castiel certainly didn’t look at Hannah the way Jimmy looked at Amelia.
“You seen the Marshal?” He asked Bobby, folding up his serape. Someone had washed it clean and hung it to dry, so it smelled fresh and clean, like soap. He remember vaguely vomiting all over it, fouling it with sick. He fingered a hole with singed edges, where the Colt had gotten tangled up and the shot gone through the serape and gone wild, missing Azazel. If he’d made that shot, he’d never have fallen into the pit with the rattler.
“So, it’s true,” she said, looking out past him to where Castiel was having his moment with Cabrón. “No wonder none of the Alphas in Yell County ever had a chance with you, Dean. You went out and got yourself a damn movie star. You are now officially the envy of Omegas in all thirty states and the Republic of Florida.”
“It’s the same damn test, they just charge you three bucks more for the Omega version,” Charlie said. “It measures the same hormone. There’s like, lots of ways Omega and Beta pregnancy are different, but this one thing is the same.”
Just to stick it to this Crowley, Dean added, “I’m thinking that though its convenient to run our horses just up to Fort Smith, there’s plenty of livery places in Kansas City that would take a string of ponies when we drive the cattle up for sale.”
“I don’t. It doesn’t come natural to our pack. I made sure we took good care of the car for you though. I didn’t think you’d want it to drive, but maybe to sell some day. It’s a collector car. It’s worth quite a big of money, actually. So I made sure it was always insured, maintained, ready to go.”
Dean stared at the gift he was being given. He hadn’t even heard before that the pack had one of these in their armory. Around them, the pack seemed shocked too. Gasps were heard. Dean almost couldn’t reach out for the gift. Castiel couldn’t be giving such a thing to him, could he? It was worth more than all the pack lands and assets combined, more than the long house they were in. More than the pack’s radio station. It was a staggering and confusing gift.
“Yes. We are as we have always been to each other?” Castiel asked, wanting Jimmy to affirm the status of their relationship to each other. People often thought that Jimmy was the weaker of the pair, because he could have had a chance to take Pack Alpha for himself and hadn’t. That Castiel was stronger, more dominant. If anything, Jimmy had the slight advantage over Castiel, the strength of their bodies an almost equal match, but with Jimmy having a clear advantage with his people skills. In truth though, if Jimmy had wanted to be pack Alpha, he would have been, even if Castiel had tried to take it from him, not been begged to take it. Jimmy was always the better of them.
“Huh,” Castiel said, brow furrowed a little.  He wondered again if Bess could possibly be right. Could Dean be pregnant? Emergency contraceptives were good, but they were not perfect. Any form of contraceptive short of absolute abstinence had a failure rate. But he would be experiencing symptoms by now beyond fatigue, wouldn’t he?
Dean was surprised to find himself grabbed and totally wrapped up in the kid’s arms, squeezed tightly and fiercely for several minutes, almost so tightly it hurt, because damn, the kid was getting Alpha strong already. Finally Sam let him go when Dean said, “bitch.”
Dean snorted and shook his head. “That happened a long time ago and didn’t change things a damn bit.”
Bobby loaned them some money and Cas was finally able to pull investments money out safely, but they’d done it. Dean looked around the building. The shelves were still empty and dusty. There was a lot of work to be done before they could open the doors again. This was their happy ever after and soft epilogue. Two best friends turned lovers living their best lives together without an Alpha to tell them what to do or hurt them in any way.
“I’m torn. I want another, but I also want to get out of here,” Angel said as soon as he had finished the last crumb of burger. He hadn’t touched so much as a single French fry though. They compromised and before long, Dean and Angel were walking out of the Tip Top. A carry out order of several burgers only, no fries, was in a brown paper bag in Angel’s hands.
“Yes,” Castiel said. “This is my Mate and Pack Omega, Dean of Novak Pack. Dean, this is Ishim and Mirabel of Eden.”
Castiel snapped. Ishim had been deliberately provoking and Castiel didn’t understand why. There were ways of talking around each other when you met someone from a pack with values that opposed your own, but you were in a public space. Ishim and his mate were not taking those ways. They’d deliberately dishonored Castiel’s mate, had been offensive, in a way that they had to have known that Castiel could not ignore. He had to respond.
Novak had just debarked from the ferry and he seemed furious to catch sight of Dean and Impala, climbing up the riverbank. He turned though and set his big Pinto down the trail at a fast canter. Dean put the Colt back where it belonged on his hip and took off after the Marshal. He followed, giving Impala her head. She seemed to understand that her mission was to keep up with the Pinto stallion and though the other horse was bigger than her, longer legged and able to cover more ground with each step, Impala had heart and stamina. It felt good to be back on a horse, boots in the stirrups, feeling Impala’s body move and follow under his, working with each stride she made. As he’d told Novak, he’d been riding for as long as he could remember and it felt as natural as walking. He grinned, feeling oddly happy. It was a good feeling, letting a horse have her head like this.
The pack’s emergency radio was brought out and someone cranked it up. They listened to dry reports of storm lines and counties where hurricane force winds had been reported, how tornadoes had been reported mere miles from them, where there were flash flood warnings.
“I don’t see that this is helpful. You recognized each other as true mates and had many years to court Amelia before you two mated.”
She called to someone across the room, saying, “Ash, this dude has the computer clap. Can you get him sorted?
And, while the baby was there in Dean’s arms at least, he treated Dean like Dean was a denning mother and Jimmy was the proud Alpha father of the baby. It was like a little time apart in his life where he could just be taken care of and in turn, take care of the sweet baby in his arms. He felt such achy, blissful bursts of love for her swelling up in him, sometimes he felt it was a wonder he didn’t just spontaneously start lactating or something.
Up closer, Dean could see there was a sort of primitive barn, hardly more than a half open shed, attached to the main cabin by a dog trot, but it would get the horses out of the weather. Step by step, they got closer to the cabin, then Dean could see in. A woman was sitting by the fire in a chair, her booted feet propped up on the stones of the fireplace. There was the remains of a table next to her. She wore riding clothes, not a woman’s dress, but her dark hair was down and long and her close cut shirt revealed her shape.
Hannah frowned as she took them all in. Amelia wore a plain lavender blouse with gray pants, much like she would wear to work in Folsom. Hannah’s hair had been carefully styled and braided. Amelia’s was pulled up in what Castiel had heard referred to as a “messy bun.”  For himself, Castiel wore his usual black, but then no one really cared what the Alpha wore to the mating, at least not in their pack. Jimmy had borrowed some of Castiel’s clothes to patrol in, the business attire he’d been wearing not suitable for running through the woods, but neither of them wore traditional clothes.
"This must be Dean," Michael said. His voice was deep, sure. He smiled and held out his arms. Cas tugged Dean along with him and piled into Michael's arms for a hug. The Alpha smelled good, like wood and leather and spice. He smelled like that come Dean so loved to clean up from Castiel's pussy. He was muscular and Dean felt he could just melt into his arms, even though it had been just minutes ago they had met.
“No you don’t. You love me and you know it, baby brother,” Dean said, with his biggest grin. “I gotta go. He’s waiting. I’ll come home with groceries before midnight. I promise.”
Dean hopped off the shuttle and hustled to the common. He was shocked to see the Hall looking so different. There was grass growing on the roof? A couple of goats grazed on top. He just couldn’t stop staring at the bizarre sight of it.
He’d light the lamp on his bedside table and he’d pull out two cards he’d kept stored carefully in wood box on his bedside table. Two Ace of hearts from two separate decks, each shot right through the middle of the heart. He’d found the one from Meg’s deck tucked carefully away in Impala’s saddlebags after his return from the Territories.
“Then you know as much as I do,” Castiel said. “We have real estate agents and attorneys for the technical details. The work, the true work, of the pack Omega is to keep the best interests of the pack in mind and be a balance to the Alpha. That’s not something a paid administrator like Hannah can truly do. I suppose I shouldn’t assume. Is it something you even want to do? Would you be my Pack Omega, Dean? Not just my mate, but the one who stands next to me, sits next to me? In front of our pack?”
"It still hurts," Dean complained after his belly was full and Castiel's breasts had been completely drained.
Then the moment ended and Dean pushed him away weakly. He was still far from total recovery. Castiel helped Dean back to bed.
Dean woke up in his own bed again, the house below him silent. Not empty. He sniffed a little. Yes. There were the people around him. Jimmy. Amelia. And ugh, they’d been having sex again. That particular scent had always given him a little pang in the chest when he’d scented it, a little jealousy. Maybe not so much now that he knew what sex was like.
“Yes, the mechanic, who is the kindest, most wonderful man I’ve ever met. Who I must go to if I have any hope with him.”
Dean already knew the man was ordained but that was common to lawmen, for helping with hunting the unnatural. Dean tried to imagine Castiel as an actual preacher. Castiel who openly fornicated with another Alpha and drank alcohol eagerly when it was offered. It was an image that both fit the man and yet very much did not.
“Back in surgery, last I heard,” Sam said. “They thought they got all the bleeds but his blood pressure was still dropping, even though they’ve given him four units of blood.”
“No offense, but your mother is full of shit. I like an Omega that wants to eat and you are just about perfect the way you are. Well, perfect as far as I’m concerned.”
With that, Jimmy leaned in and he placed a kiss on Dean’s head. Not his lips. Not even his cheeks. On his head, like you would kiss an ill or fussing child to check their temperature. Then Jimmy pulled out a handkerchief and dried Dean’s tears. Like he was a child. Dean got it. He did. He didn’t need this further humiliation, so he forced himself to stop crying. He shouldn’t have let any of it out at all. He shoved his feelings down hard and lowered his eyes to the wood floor. When he looked up again, Jimmy was gone and Ellen was by his side instead. She was carrying some kind of sword with her, which was weird.
He never thought this kind of thing could happen to him, this grand passion and unlikeliest of loves. He’d been so content with Amelia, even though they couldn’t have children. It had been a happy home. She was Beta and they made for a happy home, even if they usually weren’t fertile.
“Isn’t he supposed to ask me for your hand or something?” Dean asked, not even certain why he was angry. He’d known his Ma had stopped grieving John Winchester long ago and was making time with Bobby. He hated the thought though that she would no longer be his father’s wife, but another man’s. No matter how much he loved Bobby and how much he wanted her to live a life of her choice like he lived his.
Just at that moment, Claire woke from her nap. Even though she was a toddler, two and a half, and almost ready for pre-school, she woke cranky from naps and today was no exception. She went quickly from a few grousing noises to full on crying in the space of a few seconds when she realized that Dean wasn’t near, that she was away from everyone else that she could hear talking. Dean hurried to go get her and comfort her crankies away.
Dean looked around, making sure all of the people he cared about were here, safe behind the doors of the long house. He was eager to get to his mate, really wanted to see Castiel. But he had to do this before he could settle down. First he found Sammy with a cluster of his young Alpha friends. Sammy was sewing again. He’d gotten good at it too. He was embroidering something pretty intricate looking. He seemed intent on what he was doing and from what Dean could see, it was actually very good. It looked like maybe he was making a fancy tunic, something much more intricate than an Alpha ever wore.  Very fancy, in ivory and gold thread on soft green wool. He’d gotten even better since he’d made the sling a while ago. A lot better. All that fancy work was not something an Alpha would wear. Maybe Sam had gotten sweet on someone and he was making them a gift? Probably a girl. Dean was the youngest boy Omega in the pack at the moment.
“Fuck, I didn’t think I could get hard anymore,” Dean said. “I haven’t been this hard since high school, haven’t gotten hard at all since I married Michael.”
“I have to go to the closet,” Dean explained. It wasn’t a proper bathroom, seeing as those weren’t technologically fitting with the era of the longhouse, but you couldn’t gather all these people together over a long night, every month, and not have some kind of facilities available. They had a couple of small rooms, each with a composting toilet, that in the scheme of things, wasn’t so bad, so long as people used enough of the bedding material to cover the waste.
He found Dean sitting on his own on the floor in front of the box bed, waiting for him, looking drowsy. He’d found a dry sheepskin to sit on for a bit of cushioning and a dull brown piece of fabric to make into a kind of sash around his waist, which he’d stuck the Angel blade into. His wedding outfit, the borrowed white linen pieces, was looking a little worse for the wear, as they all were, but there was something that looked like baby throw up on the Smokkr and smudges of dirt on the knees of the white pants.
They were off in moments, Castiel leading the way. They didn’t ride easy, but it wasn’t the roughneck pace from earlier when Cas had been trying to lose him. Still, it was clear that the Marshal expected a stiff pace and he would not make concessions to that. It was a surprisingly enjoyable ride because of that. Dean didn’t get this kind of opportunity to ride often enough. Cas didn’t make idle chatter, didn’t expect it from Dean either. The morning sun and the wind dried the river water off him completely before long.
“Love?” Dean asked, stunned. He never thought this was about love. This had been a transaction, hadn’t it? He put out and Cas gave them what they needed, but as he looked in Castiel’s electric blue eyes, he realized that Cas wasn’t kidding or lying about it being love, at least not on his side. Looking at the things Cas did for Dean, this was pursuit- courting maybe. An Alpha who was serious about mating a quality Omega would show the Omega he could provide for a mate and children by presenting gifts. Certain fancy pieces of jewelry were the traditional gifts, not groceries or clothes. But Dean had memories of when they first took up together, of Cas trying to gift him jewelry and Dean had always refused, because he didn’t want to be obligated. Because it had been too much.
“How about that barbecue shack out on County Road Two,” Castiel suggested, sitting up and reaching for his abandoned shirt, concealing the tattoos again. “The shuttle goes past all the time but I’ve never been.”
Dean and Castiel do talk a little, but it will be a while before they could possibly say the things that need to be said.
“Ah, hell, no. You’d wipe the canvas with me,” Dean said. “You’d have me on the ropes in thirty-seconds.”
To Castiel’s surprise, the hives were not abandoned, but well tended. He could even see a few bees file in and out of the small openings. It was a warm day and there were flowers for the bees to visit, an explosion of all shades of purple and yellow. Only, there were about a dozen hives scattered over the field, and he had only left Dean with six.
Castiel turned to Dean, squinting at him as quizzically as he’d stared at the busted down house. As if he wondered what this little, inconsequential Omega was even doing here, talking to him.
Castiel frowned for a moment and seemed to think deeply about it, then smiled, “I should have thought about that sooner. Of course my Omega will have a car and license. But not instead of the fourth gift. In addition to. I already have the fourth gift bought for you.”
I have had so many wonderful, thoughtful comments again!  I replied to as many as I could tonight, but if I didn’t reply to yours, I will get to it soon.
They’d bought the old U-Pick Orchard on the highway that ran out of town and towards the interstate. Everyone going to or from the interstate had to pass their roadside stand. Cas was setting up some more hives in the furthest corner of the orchard. They’d move them closer to the trees in a few weeks when they were due to blossom. They probably wouldn’t get a good crop this year. The U-Pick place had been closed for a couple years and the trees hadn’t been pruned properly in a while. They’d do what they could though.
Today, he’d been wearing jeans and a bright yellow t-shirt that had a floral print and said, “Plant Kindness.” He thought maybe it might have been a woman’s shirt once, but Dean, keeping with his new policy of not saying a damn thing if it was harmless and made someone else happy, hadn’t said that. Dean didn’t think Cas was trying to dress in women’s clothes. It was just a t-shirt with the usual kind of neck and sleeve length. He thought maybe it wasn’t even that Cas didn’t know that certain colors and prints weren’t gender appropriate for the very male body he had. He probably just didn’t care. Once, when Cas was wandering around wearing a particularly clashing t-shirt/flannel combo, like painfully bad, Dean had said something like, “You just wear whatever the hell you want these days, don’t you?”
Dean helped her finish up putting the last of her things in her travel case. The furniture would stay, except for a few small thing. The house and its contents were technically Sam’s. Now that Mary wouldn’t be staying any longer, they’d be renting it out to Charlie, so she could live closer to the horses. When the last drawer had been emptied and packed, Dean went to pick up the cases and Mary opened her mouth as if she were going to say something.
“Whatever. It’s totally messed up in all ways! They just tell you you’re mating this dude with less than a day’s notice? I mean, yeah, mating the Pack Alpha is something, but give a guy time to prepare, you know? I know matings are traditional at Midsummer, but couldn’t they have waited a few months for you to get used to the idea? Did it at Equinox or something.”
“I am happy,” Dean murmured, looking away to the tree line at the horizon. It was an early summer afternoon and the green of the trees along the river still looked fresh and new. It was a time of new beginnings, new growth. He had the life he had chosen and his freedom. He had the management of land stretching to the horizon and his own stretch of land besides. If it didn’t include a certain someone, well, it just didn’t and nothing he could do about that.
As Dean seemed unlikely to get up, even to the point where it seemed like it’s own form of defiance, a submission, but an angry submission, Castiel got up off the bench and walked over to where Dean was kneeling and sat on the floor beside him, so that he was lower than Dean even. He didn’t dare touch Dean, not yet.
“I’d prefer you stay home,” Castiel said. “When the honeymoon month is over we’ll see about you visiting with Bobby and Ellen. I know you must miss them.”
They stopped at the registry office in Lawrence. It was not the most romantic of places. It was more city office than marriage venue. The floors were that pressed plastic tile they always were in the most institutional of places. The walls were white, the waiting chairs more plastic. They stepped up to a series of windows, glass separating them from the functionaries that would process the paperwork that turned them from unrelated persons to Alpha and Omega, mated pairs. At least mated in the eyes of the government.
“I believe I may have passed muster,” Castiel said, taking Dean’s hands in his, pulling him close. He thought about the picture of the premier last night and wondered if he could kiss Dean better this time around. He vowed to improve at it for as long as he lived.
“You might have Grace Industries. I never wanted it to be formed in the first place. I never imagined anything at all might come of your pet project, but you will not have the mine. You squander the Angelthenium.”
“Dean, are you okay?” Castiel asked, reaching out and touching Dean’s cheek. It was only then that Dean realized he was crying.
“I’ll organize it,” Pam Barnes said. She owned a business in Folsom and lived on the pack lands, commuted back and forth every day. It would be easier for her to get back and forth to the hospital. “Does the kid have comfort items that haven’t gotten to him yet?”
That wasn’t right. He’d gotten good pretty fast, but Maggie and Eleanor were better, he thought. His satin stitch was still a little ragged compared to theirs.
Before long, their boots were hitting the trail. Castiel let Jimmy take the lead and set the pace, which was punishing. Jimmy had, for all that they should have had the same genetic blessings, a slight advantage when it came to running, a just leaner enough body. It shouldn’t have made a difference, but it did. They hit the periphery of the pack’s lands and all the thin spaces and then the dam, quickly, in half the time Castiel normally took. Then Jimmy looped them back to the forest glade at the northern boundary where the pack lands backed up against the national forest.
“Sir, an attack from behind like that in full fang could be charged as attempted murder,” the officer said.
She disappeared to the back but came up to the counter a few minutes with two small pink and white boxes which she handed to him. Dean started to pull out his wallet and she said, “I already pulled my drawer. It’d be a bigger pain for you to pay. Besides, I’m pretty sure Abner would have my head if I made his Pack Omega pay for something he’s giving to the pack anyway.”
“There have been some issues at the pack lands. Set backs. Issues with the Hall. Conflicts with those who don’t like how I’m handling the situation,” Castiel said. “It’s been a long, hard day. Perhaps I could use the shower before dinner?”
Whenever Dean saw Sam from that point, it was with needle and project in hand, so he wasn’t surprised when Sam presented him with a tied up bundle of cloth a few weeks later, in Bobby’s living room. Sam had come by to help Dean wrangle some firewood, making sure Bobby had plenty good, seasoned wood in the rack near the door where Bobby could bring it into the house himself if he wanted. Dean could carry armfuls of wood, but he wasn’t allowed to do something as athletic as splitting logs. That’s why he’d asked Sam for help. The kid was getting stronger by the day. They finally got all stocked up and each carried an arm load into the house and built up the fire. It was one of those late winter days where it wasn’t so much cold as just frozen completely through, so the fire was appreciated. Once they’d warmed up a little, Sam had grabbed the bundle out of his bag and shoved it at Dean, who opened it.
At this moment, he didn’t care that he was Omega and Dean was Omega and that their parts didn’t match up and that society and the Church forbid it.
“Exactly,” Angel said. “The pool of nobility that Mother would consider suitable for me is laughably small and all closely related to me, but she will not be ruler for much longer. It’s long custom that my mate would be a noble from Eden, but the law states only that my mate must be an Alpha, unmated, either a bachelor or widower, and freeholder of a certain amount of land, with an income of his own. People assume that the land must be within the borders of Eden, but that’s not what the law says.”
“Look like you’re about to crawl out of your own skin, kid,” the man said. “You know how to play checkers? Bobby Singer, by the way.”
“Why me? Why do I get appointed some fancy guardian thing?” Dean asked. He hadn’t expected anyone would care enough to get some court worker involved in a dispute between two packs and he said so.
“Even if that’s true, wouldn’t it just all go to Sammy anyway,” Dean asked. He knew he wasn’t in line for it, but Sammy would be due to get what little John Winchester had to hand down- the Impala and the weapon collection John had amassed, including the Grigori killing sword, would be Sam’s property in a few short years.
“But I would never say anything I don’t mean,” Castiel said. “You are my mate and it was wrong of me to have even worked on the purchase of that land without you at my side.”
“You? Heart surgery too?” Dean asked, sounding surprised. He took Castiel’s hand in his and guided it under his shirt to the scar on his own chest, where eventually they had done a repair to Dean’s heart. Not quite the same place where his own scar was. Dean’s scar was bigger, fresher, and more prominent. Castiel’s was older and faded, smaller to start. You could hardly tell it was there unless you felt his skin.
“Not tonight. I think we need to spend tonight together, but we’ll appear at dinner in the hall together. Some nights,” Castiel said. “I’ve been enjoying family dinner with Jimmy’s family and you too much to give it up entirely, but we need to appear in front of the pack as a true mated pair. We need to start working on pack business together. Not tonight, but soon. Until then, I hope maybe you might accept my gift. I know it’s not enough. Not nearly enough for what I did and what I allowed to happen, but think of it as a token. Things will change. Starting now.”
“What is this? What are these vehicles doing here on our sacred lands?” She demanded, gesturing at the Bobcat that was now being used as a loader, to move wire crates of stacked river rocks off one of the trucks. She’d said ‘vehicles’ like other people might say ‘pile of manure’. Of course, given her work, a pile of manure was a positive thing. Apparently earth moving machinery was not.
“Your EKG today looks good though, nice, even rhythm,” he said, looking down at the read out. Despite the confident doctor attitude, the kid was a bundle of nervous energy, flipping rapidly through Dean’s chart, faster than he could possibly read. “Dr. Lennon seemed to think you’re on your way to a complete recovery. Everything else good? Anything change for you recently.”
Angels exist for real in this AU and sometimes walk among humans. But they’re different Angels. Castiel and his family are just human and always have been.
“We both lost our Dad that day, didn’t we?” Dean asked. He hadn’t resumed scrubbing, but he had leaned against Castiel’s back, resting his face on Castiel. It was a comforting weight, his slight body on Castiel’s. In talking, it was like they were no longer naked or something. Or maybe that the nakedness didn’t matter. They were just two people, talking of the people they missed and mourned.
“The one your mother hates so much?” She said, wrinkling her nose a little. She didn’t like it either.
"No, cher, you're gonna have to press harder to hit his spot just right," Benny said to Cas. "Like so."
The Omega nodded and tilted his head to give Dean access to the scent glands. Outside, he smelled even better without the grunge of Alpha musk and spilled beer to cover it up. Dean could feel himself getting hard, just from the scent of it.
They were at the ball not long after. They’d rented out this big fancy room in the University of Kansas student union. Sammy had work stuff for the event to do first before the actual guests started arriving. Dean got roped into moving chairs around because the event planner hadn’t like how the rental service had set them up. Generally though, the place had been fancied up like crazy. There were spray-painted silvery curled branches in big bunches on the tables, all laced through with those fancy little Christmas lights. White tablecloths on everything and the chairs were the delicate gold ones that Dean always feared breaking. There was some kind of filter thing on the lighting over the dance floor that gave a pretty good impression of it snowing, little glittery flakes drifting in the air. They had popped for a real orchestra too, setting up and tuning up now.
“Retired? Don’t you have to be old to be retired? Like ancient? I mean, I know you’re a lot older than me, but you’re not old.”
“We’ll talk later. I’m supposed to get you up to speed on the McLeod portfolios. They’ll be in your hands for the next month while I’m on family leave.”
“And then I’m done and I can quit?” Dean asked, excitedly. He’d promised Amelia and Jimmy that he would get his GED at least. More like they’d extracted that promise from him one day when he’d been on the verge of dropping out.
Castiel, of course, was there, mug of hot tea on the bench next to him, working on a wood carving of some kind with a pocket knife and a long piece of wood. After a moment, Dean recognized it a replacement piece for the second best box bed, the one that had been crushed during the storm. Castiel carved wood by hand, like a lot of the men, Alpha, Beta and even Omega. To Castiel’s left, sat Cain.
Seemed. Castiel could see the doubts under the surface of this hero worship but you didn’t talk about these things with Dean.
But Dean seemed to be getting frustrated too, even whined a little when Castiel’s hand slipped down his muscled back a little lower.
“Well, ain’t that kind of you to concede,” Dean snapped. “We seem to have a fundamental failure to communicate here, Marshal. I’m not heading out with you. You’re heading out with me. Perhaps I ought to rummage through your kit and see if I think you’re ready for a long, hard ride.”
“That’s as may be. My point remains the same, Bobby,” Rufus said. “You’re working for the man when you could be working for yourself.”
“Yeah, okay. Buy me a pretty little something,” Dean said. “But fair warning, just because you buy me something tonight doesn’t mean you’ll get to see me take it off tonight or even tomorrow. I’m not fast or easy.”
“You wouldn’t have to wear the apron dress thing. In Moondoor, you don’t have to be your own gender, either primary or secondary. You can be whatever you want. I’m an Alpha Queen. You could be my shield maiden like Ash is. Or you could be a badass Alpha Warrior.”
Cas sniffed the air and said, “I believe it’s spinach today. You might consider some vegetables every now and then, for the sake of the baby.”
It was just a short kiss. So short. Mere seconds long. It could have been just a brush of lips against lips, but it wasn’t. It was electric. It was like they touched and were thrown apart by a shock.
Well, shit, Angel was definitely, officially, his problem now. It wasn’t like he could take an adult Omega back to his family if he didn’t want to go. Even if he could force the Omega, Sam would kill him. Shit, Sam was going to kill him anyway. Sam knew not to hold dinner for Dean on Thursdays, but he had to check in if he was going to be out past bedtime and he hadn’t. Dean checked his phone. No message but just a single surly, text, —Dean, where are you?—
“I built you a home at the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow,” Dean said and it was the line that Castiel had waited his whole life to hear without knowing he had needed to hear it.
“So, I thought we’d stop at Garth’s farm,” Bobby said after they’d said their thank you kindlys and goodbyes to Jody. “Got some horses to get back to the ranch.”
Dean was tired, having gotten not near enough sleep, and he should have been a lot more cautious than he was. As it was, Impala’s even, smooth lope along the trail was soporific and he was all but dozing off in the saddle before long. It was a comfortable feeling, being on the back of his horse again, just riding, worries forgotten for the moment, in that half dreaming, wool gathering state of mind.
Sam was cataloging yet another box of ancient scrolls, wondering when the supply of them was going to end. The Men of Letters were hoarders of the magical and the mystical. Every time he thought he’d come to the end of the boxes, he found another.
“You’d think that, yes,” Missouri said. “It would be a better world indeed if my services were never needed and we could guarantee that what a pack wants for an Omega is truly what’s best for that Omega. Now, here’s the court order. I’d like to speak to my client alone for a while, if you don’t mind. We’ll just be next door in conference room C. Dean, it will just be a few minutes.”
“Dean, honey, I swear, you are the only man in existence that I have to scold for doing too many chores,” she said. “Laundry folding is supposed to be me this week and don’t think I missed that you cleaned the bathroom that Jimmy was supposed to.”
Dean just had to get on with the work and if there were a few tears on his face, they might have just been drips from the sweat of his brow. He hammered on those wedges as hard as he could, making good progress, until he was breathing hard, chest heaving, until he was starting to feel played out, worn to a raveling, still, he kept working until he heard someone call from some feet away.
Dean had a nagging thought that he should probably go home, that there was something he should be doing right now. He didn’t get up though. It had been a long week. It was getting close to Christmas, so people were getting ready for the long road trips home. They wanted snow tires put on and hoses and belts checked. A lot of little piddly stuff that didn’t earn him a lot of money, but it was his shop, so he took on the extra time this stuff took. Then, there was the evening class he was taking so that he could get certified to work on cars with the new Grace Industries motors. Not that you ever worked on a Grace Industries motor itself. The motor was a black box, sealed and mysterious, but enough power came out to power a car and then some. No one outside of Grace Industries knew how the engine worked, except that it was powered by Angelthenium, which was an ore they dug out of the ground in this super small country somewhere. It was all super mysterious.
The woman just looked blankly at Dean, then down at her paperwork, checking things off. “Okay, no problem. If you got an Alpha father that would actually object to this, he has three months to prove you weren’t abandoned. If he can, this is all invalidated and the mating will be annulled. Don’t worry, I’ve never heard of a deadbeat Alpha that bothered. Okay, that’s it. You pay the fee at the other window and you’re done.”
Castiel was talking with a teenage Omega who called himself “Dee”. Dee was wearing nothing at the moment but a thin robe, nearly see through and a pair of pink lace panties that didn’t seem to hold any kind of cock or balls. Dee had the most gorgeous pair of breasts, visible through the open neckline of the robe, tea dark nipples. They were about the size of a pair of plums with eraser sized nipples that were hard and poking through the robe.
Ash seemed to understand Dean’s hesitation. Maybe they got this reaction all the time. He said, “It’s not devil worship. That’s a Solomon’s Seal. It’s protection against the devil. All of this is protection against demons and Lucifer.”
Michael had been waiting for him and stood up to greet him, then bowed. If Castiel could get rid of one thing, it would be the bowing. Instead, he stepped forward and embraced his older half brother as if they had the warm and loving relationship that was presented to the world. Michael was stiff in his arms at first, but then yielded just the right amount to appear to be hugging him back.
“I’m Jimmy. I’m his younger twin brother. He sent me to find out how you were doing. He would have come himself but pack matters prevent it.”
Canonically, Charlie is younger than Dean, but I decided that in this story, he needed a big sister. So, she’s a few years older than he is here.
He thought he was about to lose his mind with boredom when when of the Betas came up to him. Rolled up to him, exactly. The Beta was seated in one of the only modern things in this whole longhouse- a wheelchair. There was a chessboard on his knees. No, checkers, Dean thought, noticing that there was a box of round pucks in two colors, not chess men, balanced on top.
But eventually, the red blood spots in the white of Dean’s eye’s (petechiae Castiel’s brain supplied, unhelpfully) faded and Dean could get up out of bed and walk around on his own, mostly. He seemed to have avoided traumatic brain injury, mostly, but he had lingering balance issues, so they gave him a cane and still discharged him from the hospital.
Actually, it's kind of awesome. Dean finds he's very much happy to be an Omega. His body seems right to him now. He likes the lacey panties they wear. He likes being pampered. He likes the stability of the home he's sent to. Yes, the home ec classes kind of suck and yes, there is some sexual training. but the teachers are very gentle and the training is more about how to get pleasure as an Omega than how to please an Alpha. And Dean has one dedicated instructor (Cas maybe?) whose job it is to encourage his lactation and suckle on his new Omega breasts all the time.
“Absolutely that will never happen,” Castiel said, pleasantly. “I would die before I would consent to you impregnating me, much less mating me. Be sure to tell mother that she will not run her games around me in this way. I am the heir and you will never take the throne no matter how much she schemes for that.”
“Good for you, Cupcake,” Meg said, like he was some child that had done well in the Sunday school Scripture test. “Not me. I don’t eat vermin.”
Once Jimmy was gone back to town and Castiel had a chance to ice the newly emerging black eye, he decided he had to talk with Hannah first thing. It seemed that the evidence that she was being deliberately unkind to Dean was mounting, as much as he still found it hard to believe that she could be so petty. There were Amelia’s accusations. The matter of the wedding clothes. While it wasn’t that the cabin was ever locked, no one else had normally gone in and out of it with perfect freedom. He didn’t want to believe it of her.
Dean’s side of board was wiped clean before long and Bobby was the obvious winner. They set up again, but Dean played harder and paid more attention and he was still beaten soundly, but not quite as bad. They played for hours, until the last of the light from vent faded. Oil lamps were lit to provide a soft, flickering light that cast the long house into long pools of shadow with small islands of glow. They brought food in and all the games were cleared from the tables. It became obvious that this was not a simple hunt Dad was on because the meal was done and he hadn’t returned. Then, the dishes were taken away and people started settling into sleep. Dean was given a place in one of the bays and it was pleasant enough. The piles of pelts were kind of creepy, but they were soft and somehow, it made for a very nice nest.
Castiel held up a dress for Dean. Apparently some Omegas were wearing dresses again. The fashion regularly tipped back and forth between dresses for Omega or not and it was tipping towards again these days. Dean shook his head and scowled, so Castiel put the pretty, flimsy thing back on the rack. Apparently, there would be no dresses. He did not mind. He found a pink tunic he thought was pretty but thought better of it even before Dean looked his way again. Dean pulled a pair of very skinny pants off the rack. They looked sort of like denim, but extremely stretchy, like they would conform to his body, but they were also thick fabric, warm looking and sturdy.
He showered, but couldn’t bear to use actual soap. The smell of Dean did not seem to be fading from him, at least that he could smell. He couldn’t bear to cover it up or cause it to diminish in any way. All that he had read indicated letting the smell go away slowly on its own was as helpful as anything, despite song lyrics that advised you should ‘wash that man right out of your hair’ and similar. So, he used just the water. It was hot and plentiful. He wondered, if like Dean, the hotel used Grace Industries tankless heaters.
“You’re not supposed to,” Dean said. That was the rule with the shuttle. Even if you were the only rider, you got on or off at one of the official stops, period. The shuttle was supposed to make life easier, but they didn’t want to make the shuttle too convenient for the pack.
Castiel had been a number of things in his life- a soldier and killer, a student, a businessman. He’d been very lucky and he’d been fortunate with family connections. None of that seemed like what he was, his true self. In some ways, it was like he hadn’t come to life until that day that Dean Winchester walked up his driveway, looking for yard work. He thought about how battered his heart had been until that day, how empty his life had been. He’d wanted retirement, of course, but it had been stale, meaningless, until the day he met Dean.
Dean shrugged and took the bucket, then headed down to the river. By the time he had returned with water, Castiel had gathered dry wood and made a small fire.
“Hey, Ash, can you hold down the fort? I’m going to take Dean here home and wrap him up like a human burrito in my nest.”
Several days later, while Dean was sitting in the ranch office, going over some figures, Sam brought Dean another advertisement, this one also from the Fort Smith paper. Dean sighed, pushed aside his ledger books for the moment and humored Sam by reading it.
Dean took the seat that Castiel had pulled out for him and sat down. Castiel pushed the chair in behind him. Then Castiel served Dean pie with his own hands. He cut a wedge out of the pie. Kind of butchered it a bit getting it onto the plate, but Dean didn’t care that he’d gotten a lump of pie parts, not a whole, unbroken piece. In the end, it would all be mush inside him anyway. It was beautiful anyway, that pie. The red cherries coloring everything, but still with chunks of deep yellow peaches marbled through. He almost grabbed the fork and started in on it before Castiel had gotten his own piece but stopped himself in time.
Crushers, so called because they were nut crushers. They were the strongest, biggest doses of turning hormones manufactured- super illegal in this country, but like most turning shots, they found there way here from other countries.
Castiel walked the longhouse, looking for Dean, not seeing him with any likely group. He was starting wonder if he was losing his mind. The Hall was big and their pack was large, but it was not that big and mostly, it was one open room, with a free view from north end to south end. How could Dean be in the longhouse and simultaneously not in it? He tried to scent for his mate, but with the whole pack there, he could not pick out Dean’s scent individually, just that the whole of the pack was here. He’d be able to smell if one of their own was gone, but not able to discern why he knew that. Yes, every one of his senses, except for his sight, was telling them they were all gathered, that all was as it should be.
Dean’s mood obviously lifted as they crossed the border from Nebraska into Kansas and lightened as they drew close to Lebanon. He was outright smiling as they got out of the car at home. Castiel could have smiled him at him for it. That was one of the many things Castiel loved about Dean- the man’s unabashed love for and pleasure in his home.
"How do we know we can trust you?" Sam asks. "You could work for your father, this could be a trap."
"You changed me too Cas. I could have killed Chuck today, but I didn't, because of you. You are an angel and you still teached me so much more about being a human than anyone ever could. Dammit Cas I-" Dean grabbed him by the collar and pressed their lips together. Those stupid butterflies in your stomach are appearantly not a myth, cause Dean could feel them. After a short, but passionate kiss Cas backed up.
He’d agonized. His need to get his Hall back under a roof again, a roof safer than the one blown away, before the next full moon had won out over any other considerations. They could have organized the labor themselves, had a roof-raising, but everyone was engaged in getting their own houses in order after the storm and he would not pull them away from that. So, he’d brought in workmen and their modern tools to do the job. He knew that not everyone would be happy about that, but in the end, he was the Pack Alpha and it was his decision.
“Yeah. Mrs. Olson down the street has Claire until later,” Dean added. “I can make anything you like.”
Then he was gone. A moment later, the bathroom door down the hallway closed and Dean could hear the spray of water. Castiel was taking a shower. He’d chosen to jerk off in the shower rather than stay with Dean and maybe do some mated people stuff.
“Twenty four,” Crowley countered, “There’s wear and tear on the paddock. She nearly took a finger off my hired man when he brought her in for the night last evening.”
A nurse greeted him, a skinny Omega named Garth, according to the name tag hung on his green hospital scrubs. “You’re Castiel Novak?”
The answer Dean got disgusted him. Cole had looked Dean up and down in an appraising way, like Dean was a horse he might be buying, then said, all but openly leering, “Let’s just say I really like the look of your spread.”
It was everything he had ever wanted, Castiel’s scent rising around them like a cloud, strong, powerful, like a storm. Dean had always thought at this moment he would feel weak in the knees. He thought he might surrender, like you always heard in those radio dramas, where the Omega is unable to resist his Alpha. Where he faints dead away and the Alpha wraps him in his arms and what happens next is implied not spoken, but that the Omega most of all, surrenders to the Alpha.
Finally he said, “My father John Winchester would have sold you that horse for fifteen dollars. That’s what he was planning on. She’s worth twenty-two, maybe, but we understand you stock merchants have to make a profit. I’ll pay you twenty, cash. You know and I know that if you do convince some poor sucker to pay the two hundred you just asked for, that would be highway robbery.”
“Yes, of course,” Castiel said and then Dean’s fingers were touching the skin on his upper arm, along the inner and back side of it, where the ravens’ wings extended, the place where the skin was most sensitive and the tattoo artist’s needle had been the most painful, had hurt like burning. Not that the rest of the big piece had been pleasant, but it had been mere irritation compared to the back of his arms.
Dean turned to go. He could be the one that walked away this time. He pushed his way through the little crowd as fast as he could, meaning to head back to his automobile. And then? Just get in and drive as far as he tank of fuel would take him. He wished it were back in the days when he could just get on his horse and ride, chasing the horizon. Nothing holding him back. Nothing before him but the endless prairie and hills, nothing above him but the sky. Those days were over though. The frontier was now the settlement and the settlement become the town on its way to growing up into a city. But Dean could still walk away.
“I was hoping you could help me find a tail light for my Baby here,” Dean said. “I got to get it fixed today. I’ve gotten four tickets from Deputy Doug this month already.”
“And what would you receive, in exchange? I assume you would not be content to stumble off into the night with nothing.”
Castiel swallowed hard and surrendered his revolver, then let the man take the other one, then pat him down all over. The man found and seized a long, silvery knife, more of a dagger really, a derringer and a second, smaller knife. Other men, about five of them, shimmered into existence, coming out from behind buildings, piles of rubble and from the scrub ringing the compound. One of the men was Azazel, still wearing the same bloody shirt, hole in the sleeve clearly visible. Meg was nowhere to be seen, disappeared somewhere. Maybe she’d betrayed them. That was exactly what an evil bitch like her would do.
"Well, I'll definitely have to take you out for a drive in the country soon," Michael said, pulling Dean close, then kissing him.
Carrying Dean on his shoulder, he ran to where the horses had been left. Just before he got to the small clearing, a shot rang out through the woods. Meg’s gun. It was a very distinctive sound. Then the horses squealed in alarm, stamping their feet. He broke into the clearing just in time to see the smoke still rising from the muzzle of Meg’s revolver, Lucifer on the ground, big, red hole dead in the middle of his forehead. Lots and lots of blood and less identifiable spatter around. She must have gotten him at close range. The back of his head was a big mess of blood and things far less pleasant.
One of the dude at table nine pinched him on the ass, though there were plenty of signs about how the customers weren’t supposed to touch the waitstaff. That was always sort of more honored in the breach than the observance though. Dean’s instinct was to slug the guy, but he kept a lid on it and just said, with a plastered on smile, “Oh, you! You know you can’t handle this jelly.”
Instead, it looked like there was still a serious chance of them being able to take him away with them. This was an Important Meeting, it was suddenly clear. It wasn’t just Bobby, Castiel and Jimmy that were attending. It was the whole pack council except Hannah who never left pack lands. Jimmy and Amelia. Pam Barnes. Ellen. Jody. Benny. Cain. Meg. Everyone was wearing suits, except Jody who wore her sheriff’s deputy uniform.
“That’s all that’s needed,” Castiel promised. “I didn’t expect to come across Ishim like this. I would not have brought you out if I’d known, if I’d had any clue we would run into someone like him.”
Issa, one of their regular counter girls, came out from the back. She had a big mess of curls, tied back in a pink head scarf and pretty pale olive-toned skin. She wasn’t Novak pack, but Abner, the owner of Upper Crust was, and Abner was protective of her. Not pack, but almost a pack affiliate. A friend of the pack.
Sam threw himself into Dean’s arms. The pup was only fourteen and he really shouldn’t have be left alone like this, but Dean had to do what he had to do. At least he brought home a lot of food. At least Sammy could be fed. It would have to be enough.
“She did not,” Castiel said, after he took the last sip of his coffee. “Because I don’t own a ball gown.”
To make a point, Castiel scraped his claw over the skin, just deep enough to make it bleed a little. Finally, Winchester did not fully submit, but he stopped fighting, stayed still and silent.
Dean retrieved it from his room and put it into Sam’s hands and the kid’s eyes were shining bright. He knew what it was, what it meant. Even if the kid was never a hunter, and Dean hoped like hell he never would be, he should have Dad’s journal.
Dean had been in the stable, working with the horses when Sam had come with the handbill. He’d been currying Cabrón. The horse really had been all but ruined by Castiel. He was still, after all these years, more or less lame. He couldn’t be ridden and was turned out in the pasture most of the time. He did however, have excellent blood and turned out to be an ideal stud. He’d cut quite the swath through the Winchester mares, including Impala, and spent his retirement siring a good looking assortment of foals with varying amounts of white markings and patches. Those foals grew up to be horses with remarkably fine temper and heart, as if they took the best their sire had to offer. They made good working horses for the ranch and for sale. A retirement like that was the least Dean could provide for the horse that had saved his life.
“Maybe he gave it to Ellen or Bobby,” Amelia mused after they exhausted the possibilities of the cabin. “That man of mine. Once he gets talking with Cassie, anything else just flies out of his head. Well, let’s go get you ready as best we can without. Hopefully Jimmy will show up soon enough before Hall doors close. You go to the bath house. I’ll check with Bobby and Ellen and I’ll be there soon.”
Meg suddenly appeared. She literally grabbed Ben by the ear. Not hard or anything. They didn’t go in for physical punishment in their pack. It was more to imply that she could box him in the ear if she wanted to, but didn’t think he was worth the bother. She had that eerie way of just appearing when they were getting into trouble, as if she were always watching.
The night before, he and Dean had spent the night together in Castiel’s old room. They laid together on the bed and watched movies, ate snacks and pretended they were back in high school still.
“I should go. I’ll try and catch an even earlier shuttle home than the five o’clock. I know I haven’t been as timely as I said I would be.”
"I don't want to go back," Dean said, then he couldn't look up. "Not at all. I want you to mate me and put a pup in me now."
Dean turned to Castiel in fury, “I do not consent to this woman riding along with us and this is my trip to find Azazel. Am I not the one paying expenses and paying your reward besides?”
The builder had the upper hand, in the end. Or rather, as the phrase went, he had Castiel over a barrel. There were very few builders who had the kind of expertise needed, longhouse construction being a fairly specialized enterprise, despite the recent fashion for them in packs that didn’t have direct connection to the old country and the Islands. There were even fewer builders that would contemplate the kind of roof and building alterations that Castiel had settled on in the time frame available. Only the one would take the contract. He and his crew of skilled workers were flown in from Norway, filled out with some local day laborers.
Dean shouldn’t have let anger control him but he did. He pulled the trigger on the big gun, shocked at how loud it was, how strong the kickback. Not that he hadn’t fired the Colt before but it was different standing in a pasture shooting at a fence post, calm, ready and prepared. If he’d been more in control of himself, maybe the shot wouldn’t have gone off so wide, but it did. It just winged Azazel, scraping a flesh wound on the man’s upper arm that bled great drops of blood down his arm, but didn’t really seem to hurt him that much. Far from a killing blow. Seconds later, while the boom was still ringing in Dean’s ears, hoof beats came up from behind.
He hadn’t even tried to make Dean wear prettier Omega clothes. Offered them, yes, but forced- no. The few clothes Dean had allowed Cas to get him, Dean had picked out himself, well, other than the lingerie.
Stomach growl taken care of, he made his way to the computer lab to do his homework. With luck, Charlie would be working. She wasn’t a student though she was about the right age, only two or three years older than him. She worked there, fixing stuff, not just hardware, but he’d seen her pull papers that seemed to be permanently deleted out of the depths of a computer’s hard drive and wipe out computer viruses like she was virtual antibiotics or something.
“Sam found that in the attic and thought it would be a funny housewarming gift. He had it framed and everything,” Dean said, holding out his hand again.
The brothers ran to each other, Sam catching Dean up in his arms, wrapping him up safely, squeezing his Omega brother tightly while kissing the top of his head. He didn’t seem to be crying, but it seemed like he was close to it. Sam’s Alpha scent, woody and strong, not particularly unpleasant as other Alphas went, flooded the condo, making Cas bristle at the intrusiveness of it, but he kept himself locked down tight. Sam was marking Dean with it. That was right. An Alpha had the right to protect those close to him by marking them.
Sam slunk away, shamed, angry. He hadn’t meant to say those things. He was such a rotten brother. Goddess knew he sure as fuck hadn’t meant to invoke the ghost of John Winchester.
Dean had kind of been hoping they would head out to the country side and cut one down themselves, but instead they'd driven to a large snow covered parking lot full of trees. They stomped from one side of it to the other, Castiel deciding one tree wasn't tall enough or another was not full enough. All the trees looked about the same to Dean. They'd never gone out and bought one when he was a kid so he couldn't see what the fuss was about. But the moment Cas found the right tree, Dean understood. Castiel's blue eyes twinkled and his face lit up in a huge, toothy grin.
Thankfully, after a few rough turnovers, the Impala coughed, sputtered but finally roared to life, so Dean could pull out in time. Things were going okay with his day. He got the packages mailed off, got to class in time. He took his quiz and he thought maybe he didn’t do too bad. He even would have time for some lunch today. Then it was off to the Dew Drop for his afternoon into evening shift. Only suddenly there were sirens and red flashing lights coming up behind him. Dean pulled over with a sigh and reached for his license and registration.
“Hey, it’d be a bit of a crunch, but if you take five classes this session instead of just your normal four, you qualify to take the GED at the end of the session.”
Jimmy was dabbing Dean’s face dry with a handkerchief. Cole was an asshole but what the hell was going on with Dean? It didn’t look like Dean wanted to mate with Castiel. There was no way that Cole was right. Dean couldn’t be pregnant, certainly not by Jimmy. Sam knew Dean better than that and Dean wouldn’t let himself be ruined that way. As for Jimmy, it was ridiculous to think that he’d have sex with anyone but Amelia.
“Nah, I really like my showers, so when I inherited the cabin, I upgraded the hot water tank to the Grace Industries tankless water heater. You could take a hot shower all day if you want. Go on. You shower. I gotta think.”
