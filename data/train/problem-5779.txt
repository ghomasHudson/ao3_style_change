Before Steve can digest that, Tony is heading off down a hall, telling Steve he’ll give him the tour. Steve follows, doing his best not to touch anything.
It comes like a flood: the soldiers in the convoy with him, the kid holding up a peace sign before the world blows to pieces. Pinpricks of painful light. The deafening stutter of gunshots as men and women in uniforms grab guns, as Tony tries to grab a gun but it’s jammed and everything is happening too fast. Yinsen bleeding out with multiple gunshots in his chest -
“Anytime,” Tony says. He gives Steve a pat on the back as they pull apart, and then they both stand there, trying to come up with something to say.
or the usual bullshit that Tony gets from guys who were around in the 40s, but the guy just stands there looking uncomfortable and tense.
They also give Bucky and Natasha a ride, because by this point both of them are drunk enough to start getting frisbee injuries from pulling increasingly risky moves. Steve stops Bucky as he’s about to jump off a scaffold and drags him to Tony’s car.
Tony shrugs. “He loves telling that story where you tried to punch that bully in the face but overswung and fell down three flights of stairs.”
It’s very slow going with just Tony, which is how he ends up getting a few people over to help him out. People are, as it turns out, very happy to help in this town. The fertilizer guy, Clint, comes over a few days a week to help him with the silo, and even brings along a few friends: Sam, the guy who runs the cafe near the river, and Bucky, his co-manager who might be married to him or might hate him or both, Tony can’t really tell. They’re good for manual labour, anyway, and also for conversation and bringing food to share when they’re working on the silo.
When they pull apart, Tony’s hands are on his face. A thumb strokes along the side of it, at the hairline.
“Two plasters, then,” Steve says. It’s only as he’s leaving the laundry room that he looks back and remembers it all over again - he just had his first kiss. He and Tony kissed. It was really nice.
“Here’s the thing,” Steve repeats. Eye contact. Eye contact is important, even if it’s terrifying and Tony is still looking at him like he’s going to reveal a dick-tentacle secret.
“So Tony might be coming to sit with us,” Steve announces as he sits down at his usual lunch table. “Or something. Details were unclear.”
. He barely thinks on The Hobbit until a moment of panic as the doors close on him just before the experiment starts. He breathes in hard and shaky through his teeth and reaches for the first thing that comes to mind, trying to ground himself.
It’d be nice, Tony assumes, to be able to look down at your hands and have something that didn’t change.
Clint says something else, but it’s illegible through the waffle and Steve doesn’t put much effort into figuring it out.
They walk in silence for a length of hall. The adrenaline from getting his arc reactor replaced is far faded now, but the coffee isn’t helping relax him. Tony’s wired enough that he’s gonna need to stay up for another few hours at least.
Breakfast is quiet, even if it isn’t the comforting kind that Steve usually gets on Ma’s days off. This quiet is more tense, since Steve can’t make himself forget Tony’s there, and the shoes are still on the couch, and his Ma is sitting there like all of this is totally normal while the other two at the table squirm.
. I broke up with him, it’s been two months and he won’t leave me alone. I figured if I found someone new, he’d get the hint that I’m really,
Tony’s face probably does something. Obie’s definitely does, though it all happens behind his usual friendly blankness.
This year he gets actual wrapping paper, and a lot of gifts - or, ‘a lot’ from his perspective. He gets at least one thing from everyone he’s friends with, which is more friends than he ever thought he’d have. It’s humbling. It’s a good birthday, a fresh reminder of all the things he’s gained in the future.
, Tony’s jaw locks. For a moment his smooths out into something that reminds Steve of that one time someone called Rhodey the n-word and Tony had made the guy cry with two sentences.
A series of groans run through the table. Tony watches as Sam drops his bite of casserole and turns to Bucky, who is already defending himself.
“Thanks,” Tony says in reply, quiet, and it clicks - Sarah keeps complimenting him. Tony doesn’t seem to know what to do with it, which is just - even weirder. Tony gets compliments all the time. He must. He’s Tony Stark. Why is he being all weird over Sarah telling him he’s smart? Tony knows he’s smart, Tony must know he’s smarter than most people know.
Steve nods gratefully. Tony blinks at him for long enough that Steve starts to ask if something’s wrong, but then Tony gets up and holds out a hand. Steve takes it and follows.
“Yeah. So unless he starts sneaking into my room in the middle of the night to watch me sleep, I’m sticking with using you to ward him off.”
He knocked on Steve’s front door and fought the urge to juggle the dish from hand to hand. Even through the dishtowel it was still hot enough to be uncomfortable.
Steve gives another laugh. He runs his hands through his ruined hair and looks out over the city, all those lights, then back at Tony and his suit.
“What’s your commission for the guy in Ohio,” Tony asks as they eat. “Are you taking furry commissions yet?”
Rhodey’s face changes: his eyes get all big and soft and he smiles like it hurts, like Rhodey’s the one in pain watching Tony lying here, and there’s so much relief and - and
Steve latches on. “I can’t believe we can just grow herbs by ourselves now. We just have all this stuff available. Aren’t you excited to use your very own chives on something?”
. The party kissing was just - we were discussing if kissing was allowed, and I said I’d never been kissed, so he just. He just-”
Tony shrugs. “Ah, Dad had moved on. Surprised he was even home. He’s usually - overseas, or somewhere else, anyway. Mom’s gone on holiday again.”
There’s a test coming up in Algebra, so Tony comes over the next day. He sits on the bus like he’s never been on one before, and this turns out to be the case when Steve asks him.
last night and went to sleep feeling strange, and woken up feeling like he hadn’t slept. He’d tried to get himself to stop thinking about it, but the words had hit something inside him that he didn’t want to think about. So he’d gone on a run with Sam, which only made things worse, not because of anything Sam did, but because of the fucking quote that Steve had been repressing since he’d read it the night before.
“Looking forward to the press conference,” Steve asks after hour three of ‘sitting on the couch watching movies, no you can’t work on anything, you can have one day where you don’t work on anything, JARVIS lock the workshop please.’
“Yes, men didn’t start having sex with each other until the fifties,” Steve says. He says it so dryly it takes Tony a second to realize he’s fucking with them. He wastes a good few seconds staring at Steve trying to puzzle out what the hell
“See you,” Steve says. He wants to say more, but can’t find anything that would work, so he lets Tony guide him out the door and gets in the limo with Jarvis, who politely avoids questions about Tony’s home life until Steve stops asking.
Steve decides to relent. “We’ll see about that,” he says, and tries not to feel too warm at how Tony’s eyes light up.
“He likes you,” Pepper continues, still stroking Ferdinand, who is now dozing in Pepper’s hand. Tony wants to take a picture. He also wants to avoid this conversation, which feels like stepping on hot Emotion coals, so he goes with misdirection: “Ferdinand?”
He collects winter produce from around town when it starts to snow - he finds a lot of Snow Yams and Crystal fruits, both strangely starchy but still enjoyable. He spends a lot of time indoors with the fire roaring, finally painting the inside of the house and reading books and learning how to cook things with all the eggs the hens keep laying now that they’re old enough. He sends Pepper and Rhodey a lot of egg pictures, way past when it stops being exciting that they’re laying. He can’t help it. He’s a proud chicken dad. He even admits to it now, and chats excitedly with Thor about it when he runs into him in town, which is less now, because Tony makes less trips to town once the cold really sets in. If someone wants to see him, they text and then he comes over to theirs or they come over to his.
talk on how to take care of chickens, and what breeds are available, and what breeds work best for whatever you want to do with chickens, and then takes Tony out back and introduces him to his chickens - his main ones, anyway, the ones he keeps around. He does give away chickens, but only the chicks of these chickens, and sometimes keeps the chicks and raises those ones until they have good long chicken lives and then die. The chickens he keeps are all named and Thor seems to love each of them passionately. He takes their eggs and does eat his chickens, but only when they die of natural causes. He gives Tony three books about raising chickens before he leaves.
“I know,” Tony says. “But this is faster. What’s up, got a scandal you need me to cover? I could be your alibi. We could say we were in-”
Steve wants to do something that’s better than putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder and shaking him gently, because it feels like he should. In the end he gives in and pulls Tony into a hug, which Tony goes into willingly, if a little surprised, by the way the hug goes: at first Tony flails a little, arms only coming in and hugging after a second or two.
He pictures the apartment they’re heading towards, the small rooms and the thin walls and the shabby furniture. None of their dishes match. None of their
“What if I get up there and - and there’s something in my heart I gotta say? It just has to come out? That’s not on the cards, but I gotta follow my heart, right?”
“Huh,” Sarah says. She wiggles her fingers that are still poking through the hole in the shoe. “Guess you have a new pair of shoes, Stevie.”
“Maybe I’m taking a break from the old life,” Tony says. “Taking something else up for a bit. What’s with you, then? How are
“I’m fine.” He smiles, but it must be just as convincing as his crappy small talk, because Tony’s face doesn’t change.
Steve gets up and pours them two glasses. He gives Tony the bigger glass, because he’s a good host, and sits back in his chair. The break seems to have worked: Tony is looking around at the apartment again, lingering on the crappy TV and the shaggy tablecloth and the chairs with chips in the wood.
“Tourists are my main customers, anyway,” Natasha says when Tony finally asks her about why she helped him learn how to fish rather than directing him to her shop. “Also, sabotaging your fishing would probably be harder in the long run than helping you out. Besides, you say you’re sticking around. Might as well be friendly.”
It niggles at the back of Steve’s head in a way that doesn’t feel unlike unease, but Steve pushes that away before it can register.
Steve shrugs. “Sometimes you just know. I’m not saying your suspicious are confirmed, just that something seems off about him.”
Jarvis twists to look at them all: Bucky is sprawling, Natasha is sitting straight but her gaze is very hazy, Steve is holding his ripped, bloody shoe in his hand and Tony is looking as innocent as possible.
Obie nods. Doesn’t try to touch him again. “Good. I’m glad. I want things to be good with us, Tony.”
“So what are the shoes about,” she asks, nodding at the couch where they’re sitting, shiny and - and - god, probably worth more than the couch, now that Steve thinks about it.
,” Steve says. He pauses. “Just got to this really good quote that kind of sums up what I’m thinking about the ending.”
“My last copy - my first copy, I guess - my, uh, Ma gave it to me. She wrote something in it. So, uh. Thanks again for the offer, but I don’t think even a copy Tolkien’s signature can replace that one.”
“Boys,” he says. He nods at Natasha, who nods back with blood on her teeth. “You’re all coming with me.”
Tony narrows his eyes at him and then at the argument that’s going on across from him. Steve shrugs. Eats another bite of shepard’s pie.
He takes a deep breath through his nose, then breathes it out. “All I’m asking is for you to explain it in a more
“What happened,” a voice says, and it takes a second for Tony to connect the dots and turn to see Steve at his other side, his eyebrows furrowed. He’s bleeding heavily from his forehead and cradling his side, which is also pretty fucking bloody.
It’s only after about a month that Tony realizes that some of the residents can be aware about how weird they are, especially to someone from the city, and
Ty immediately curls up in pain, whatever threat he was going to spill fading off into an agonized groan. He can’t even wear at Tony, though he obviously wants to, if the tear-filled grimace is anything to go by.
. Steve smiles. He has one already, but knowing Tony, this is probably one signed by Tolkien, or a special collector’s edition with rare drawings that everyone wants -
He makes his voice as calm as he can, because Tony is visibly holding down his excitement and by now Steve has caught onto the fact that Tony will eventually find it annoying if Steve acts purposely calm about this kind of thing for long enough. Not the
“Watch your step,” Steve tells Tony as they start on the rickety stairs of the building. “Lotta people fall down these.”
When Steve goes into the lounge the next morning, Tony is gone. The blanket is folded on the couch and the mixing bowl is on top of it. It’s clean, thank god.
Tony thinks as they come up to it. It’s a perfectly normal door with the number 34 on it in gold letters. It’s a little shabby, but not overly so. What the fuck would Cap’s apartment look like on the inside? Would he have knick-knacks on his shelves? Would he bother with shelves at all?
“Thanks,” Steve says quietly. His hand twitches in his lap like he’s going to cover Tony’s hand, which is still on his knee. “Hey, uh. Tony, I...”
Tony quickly turns into the guy to go to when something breaks down. Doesn’t matter what it is - anything vaguely mechanical, Tony can fix it. If it’s not mechanical, if it’s just some piece of equipment, Tony will do a quick search on how to fix it and then do it like he’s been doing it his whole life. The townsfolk are delighted and Tony is - well, Tony’s honestly happy to be contributing to the community after they’ve helped him out so much. He fixes Natasha’s broken door at her shop and the oven at Sam and Bucky’s cafe, and then the stove when that breaks down later that day. When he walks through the town, everyone says hi and stops and talks to him about his farm or about something Tony fixed and how nice it was of him to do it. They give him tips about the farm - because there’s never a limit to what Tony has to learn, apparently - and Tony takes it in and stores the knowledge for later, and it always ends up being some kind of useful, even the woman who tells him to go down to the beach and rummage around. He finds some very cool shells there, perfect for making his house look more like a home rather than a place he’s staying in for a holiday.
“I think he’s longing, too,” Natasha continues. “If I’m reading him right. Which I always am. Reading people right.”
“Uhhhh.” Tony tries to remember his list. “Well, I need to fix everything up first - the chicken coop, especially. I gotta built a silo and a greenhouse. I gotta learn how to - do fertilizer, and plant crops, and where to put them and why you put them there, and also where to get chickens, and how to, uh. Have chickens around. And - everything, basically.”
Tony’s face is very close. Steve could count his eyelashes if there was more light, but there isn’t. There’s some light coming in from the window, maybe from the moon but probably not, and all Steve can see is shadow and vague highlights: the shape of Tony’s face, his shoulders, his hand coming up to touch Steve’s arm.
“Yeah. Maybe.” Tony runs a hand down his face, careful on the cuts. “We just - me and Pep - Pepper, my assistant - we’re trying to confirm if Obie’s - if we need to do something about Obie.”
This is when Thor shows up, his arms ladened with snacks from the vending machine. Before he can ask what he missed, Natasha says, “Tony’s fine, we just gotta make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid and give himself blood poisoning.”
Steve moves into the Tower about a year after waking up from the ice. It’s a little awkward, fitting into a space that Tony apparently prepared years back after their first fight as Avengers - they’re more familiar with each other by this point but they’re not exactly close.
Tony’s gaze flickers up at him like Steve’s caught him out on something. He rubs some more at his beard.
. He gets it when he’s probably too old for it, and he’s also probably too old for his Ma to read it to him as he’s half-delirious with scarlet fever, but neither of them mention this. It’s a nice little adventure story. Ma never finishes reading it to him, she gets caught up in work and Steve gets well enough to read it himself, but he keeps the memories of her voice, as comfortingly warm as the thick blankets they can’t afford, telling him about something called a Hobbit.
“Hi, Ma,” he says, straightening up. “Uh. It’s a really nice day today, you’d like it. Sun’s out, but it’s not too hot.”
“Alright,” Clint says. “You’re awake! Great. I’m gonna go get some sleep somewhere that isn’t a hospital chair before my back is permanently deformed. Steve, Bruce, we’re tapping out. Thor, Nat, you’re barely tired, you can stick around.”
Later, Steve can’t pinpoint the moment that Tony ends up staying for dinner, but he thinks it starts with Sarah asking Tony about himself from the kitchen - how did he and Steve meet, how did Tony get so good at algebra, why does he like it, where does he live - and Tony keeps giving startlingly polite answers.
“I loaned it to her ten years ago,” Tony says. “A few days later she came in crying and hitting me with the book.”
Steve does. He tries not to flex the book he’s holding too much, but it’s all he can do not to twist it up into a pretzel now.
Pepper obviously has a lot to say after that conference, but she seems to be waiting to say it. Tony’s relieved. It was a lot, with seeing Obie again and all those cameras in his face, which he never thought could freak him out after living this life. Three months of a dark cave will do unexpected things, apparently.
Steve fries them up some fish to go with the salad and they sit on the porch to eat, plates in their laps.
“Could you-” Steve does some more deep breathing. Reminds himself that Tony is an okay guy when he’s not being impatient, irrational asshole.
meant, because it could mean about thirteen different things and Tony absolutely couldn’t ask which one it was. Then he tries to work out how to respond, which Pepper also seems to be stuck with, since her mouth is moving and nothing is coming out.
Cap pours them some instant coffee. They sit around the kitchen counter, because there’s no table anywhere.
Rhodey lets out a long sigh. “I would be with Sam, but unfortunately I have a deep-rooted love for the series that makes me overlook the whole ‘black people don’t exist in Middle Earth’ thing. Damn you, Tones.”
instead of - kissing him, or asking him to dinner, or to bed. Would you want to be with me, like - like Steve just wants his company, wants Tony next to him while they fish, or while Steve paints; wants to wake up next to Tony and eat breakfast together and have quiet evenings together.
Tony looks away from Steve to realize that the argument has ended and everyone’s focus is on them now.
Tony puts a performance into a stretch. “Pep, you should probably head off, too. Get some beauty sleep. Not that you need any.”
“Hi,” she says. Her gaze flickers over them both - their tight, closed-off postures, Steve holding the shoes like he wants them out of his hands. “How’re things?”
Tony thinks groggily, and then he forces his shaking, jerky arms and legs to shuffle him towards the elevator. It’s a slow, agonizing journey and every minute that passes carries the shrapnel closer to his heart; sharp jabs of pain as the blood flow restricts.
and some new, satisfyingly pulpy science fiction, which slowly loses some appeal as he encounters more real-life versions of it in HYDRA. He himself is science fiction, he supposes. That takes some fun out of reading about fantastical inventions and futuristic cities.
“Yeah!” Steve’s shaking with it, the laughter and probably the cold and the same nerves that Tony is shaking with inside the suit.
“The,” Steve says, and has to swallow. His mouth is suddenly dry despite having Tony’s tongue in it. “The failsafe? The contract said - uh, no groping.”
Steve is still giggling weakly. There are tears streaming down his face, but that’s probably from the wind. He wipes at his face clean.
He should’ve brought along the notes he’d drafted. No, that would be even worse than making a dick of himself and stumbling over his words.
There’s a lot to say to that, but Tony can’t think of any of it. Instead he says, “I thought you’d lived in this house your whole life. It’s - really homey.”
He reads it to her in those last few days, after the doctors tell him the only thing to do is to make her comfortable. Steve does his best - loads her up with all the blankets he can find and makes soup as hearty as he can, which is still pretty thin. And he sits by her bed and starts:
Obie takes out the arc reactor from Tony’s chest and all he can do it watch, so rigid that it hurts - not that it hurts enough to drown out the pain that comes from the arc reactor being forcibly removed. The second it leaves the metal cavity his chest is already screaming with it, and
For the second time that night, Tony passes out. Just before he does, he thinks he feels someone much closer than Pepper say his name, a figure with large shoulders and a worried, urgent voice that follows Tony down as his vision tunnels into darkness.
Steve takes it. He rubs at the wrapping paper - it’s a beautiful design, all cream colours, and it’s probably more expensive than his clothes. He would do this anyway, but he takes more care than usual as he tugs the tape off and opens the present without tearing the paper.
It’s a very normal evening coffee, when Pepper stops shooting furtive looks at Steve like she’s expecting him to break out into the national anthem at any second. After some incredibly hit or miss conversation which is really not Pepper or Steve’s fault - they’re both out of their depths, what do you say to Captain America who was in the forties a few months ago, and what does a guy like Steve say to the PA of a multibillion dollar company - they find common ground in what they’d studied in college. Specifically, Pepper had Minored in Art History and Steve had gone to art school after finishing high school.
“Little guy,” Bucky says. He gives Steve another elbow, gentler this time, so Steve doesn’t dodge it. Then he reaches up and scruffs up Steve’s hair like he used to do when they were kids, when Steve came up to his shoulder, and Steve lets this happen because they’re more or less having a Moment.
He reads to her a lot in those last few days as she gets weaker and frailer. He keeps his voice steady and even and focuses a lot on the scenes in the beginning where the dwarves eat the lush spread of food. At some point he looks up and she’s fallen asleep, so he trails off.
“This was my plan all along, by the way,” Tony says when they pull apart. “Lure you in with your progeny. Had this all lined up when I named him. You should hear the rest of my cunning plan.”
“Hi,” he says, flashing his own smile, not slimy but not quite trustworthy, either. “What’s going on?
There’s a moment where they both realize that this could be very awkward, and Tony turns around to present his back. “Uh. Grab on, I guess.”
It’s Tony. He’s a little rough around the edges in a way that confirms that his hangover’s hitting him a lot harder than Steve’s. He’s holding a pair of new shoes.
At this point Steve’s grades have improved enough that he’d probably get by without help, but he sits back and lets this happen. He waits for Tony to say something about the shoes - his feet are toasty dry even with the rain, damn it - but Tony stays quiet the whole ride up to Tony’s apartment.
“I think we just have to imagine it,” Tony says. “What Max and Liesel’s lives were like after Himmel Street.” He pauses. “So, Rudy-”
“Ah,” Steve says, in a faux-casual voice that sets Tony more on edge than it probably should. “You got mentioned. It wasn’t a big thing.”
Steve pauses next to him, but only for a second. “Good night,” he says. He gives the smallest of looks towards Tony that Tony takes to mean
but then the press gets a little firmer and Steve responds in kind and that’s - well, that’s. Something.
He’d waited for more, but for the hour she’d been home before dinner and then through dinner, through Tony coming over and them explaining how the fight had happened, all Sarah does is make interested faces that Steve goddamn
Steve does. Tony leaves and soon his voice joins the argument with a breezy, “Dad, I didn’t know we were going to get graced with your presence.”
When he looks up at Tony, that’s when it clicks. Tony’s expression is carefully blank, but in a way that is hiding something very big.
Tony thanks him and starts undoing the wrapping. It’s not a fancy wrapping job, which Tony is grateful for - all he has to do is move things out of the way and there’s the painting, already framed, which is nice of Steve.
He eats his way through the energy bars he’s packed, and by the end of the day the place is marginally cleaner - manual work takes longer than he realized, there’s still a long way to go - and he’s out of food and his stomach’s rumbling. He goes inside to grab his wallet, then hesitates.
Pepper looks at him, but just purses her lips. When he raises her eyebrows at her, she just shakes her head.
He looks around at the cupboards and drawers, and Steve goes to point out the cutlery drawer when Tony takes a ragged breath and says, “Hey, would you. I mean, if you wanted, we could. Keep dating. Just keep it going. For real, though.”
He gestures hard at Steve, then at the shoes. Then he turns around and strides for the door, only pausing long enough to say, “Thank you for breakfast, it was great,” to Sarah, and “I’ll see you at school,
“I’m Tony,” Tony says. He’s smiling, but it has a little bit of the panic in it that he’d had before with Ty. Still, he stands and heads over to Sarah to shake her hand.
It’s not something he wants to do. He tries everything to subdue rather than kill, but in the end Obie is weak and finished and reaching out a hand and saying
He takes the book out of his jacket pocket, opens it to the cover page. His Ma’s handwriting is faded, but still very much there. He ghosts his fingers across it.
Bucky picks up a sandwich a customer hadn’t finished, cuts around the bite mark and lets that bit fall to the plate, then starts eating the rest of the sandwich. When Steve and Tony make twin faces of disgust, he starts chewing with his mouth open.
“You’ll do a good job, Tony. Look at what you’ve done with this place - it’s only been a few months.”
He looks down at his feet. His shoes are better than anything he’d been able to get before the Army, or even then.
Wordlessly, Steve hands him the tomatoes. Tony gathers them up and watches Steve tear off giant leaves of spinach, then some lettuce.
“I miss you,” he repeats. “And I look forward to seeing you again. Don’t think that’ll be for a while, though. I think - Ma, I know this won’t make much sense to you, unless you really are looking down on me with all this otherworldly knowledge I don’t know about, so. Uh. These books have this character called Frodo, and as I was reading them I thought - I thought I was him. ‘Cause he couldn’t move on. He couldn’t go back to the home he saved, he’d changed too much, he’d been through too much, so he had to leave. But now - I don’t know. I’ve had some time to think about it. If I’d read it a year ago I’d definitely still think I was Frodo, but now - there’s part of him in me, but I don’t think I have to be him. I don’t think I
He re-reads his collection of Auden when he gets home, and when he goes to bed that night he’s still thinking about it, the painting and Tony’s voice close to him like a secret.
“Nope!” Tony gets the suit to start assembling around him. “You’re staying out of this, this is my problem.”
Then there’s a chirp and Tony looks up. Dummy is holding the arc reactor in his blessed little claw and nudging him with it.
Steve nods. “Sounds like you’ve got a lot of work ahead of you. Again, when you run into problems, everyone here’s happy to help.”
And so starts the poetry. Tony throws him poetry collections in the workshop and Steve catches them one by one: Mary Oliver, who Steve reads when he’s feeling calm and nice, or when he wants to feel calm and nice. Robert Frost, who Steve and Tony both grew up with, who is easy to get back into. Sylvia Plath - Steve can appreciate her, she’s certainly impactful, but he draws the line at all the Nazi imagery. And some Richard Siken, who is a lot different than what he’s used to, and conjures up emotions Steve doesn’t really know what to do with, so he doesn’t read him much. He’ll stick to Mary Oliver and feel calm and nice and, okay, maybe a little longing.
Tony speaks from the heart. Maybe. Later, Rhodey tells him he was speaking from his dick, and Tony can’t tell him that’s 100% false.
Steve flounders. “Uh,” he says. “Other than the people we’ve already told, we don’t tell anyone else. Like - our parents. It’ll be too difficult to explain.”
“You’re welcome to keep helping Steve with his algebra, I’ll just be in the kitchen shoving stuff around. Won’t be too loud.”
, but stops. He pulls out his phone and looks over the co-ordinates he’d found as he was hacking into some databases that shouldn’t have been so hard to get into.
“So,” Fury says. “On an unrelated note, Tiberius Stone will no longer be attending this high school as from next week.”
“I’m not saying it’s bad,” Bucky says. “I’m just saying it’s very obviously your kind of book. Quit looking at me like that.”
Steve shakes his head. “Nah. Unless you don’t look after them properly, Thor won’t resent you for anything.”
“You won’t drop them in the bath,” Tony says, waving away Steve’s worry at being lent the books. “Come on, if you can’t trust Captain America with your prized Lord of the Rings editions, who can you trust?”
He’s barely made it halfway into the second when a car pulls up beside him. Steve ignores it, but then a voice is yelling his name and Steve looks to see Tony waving at him from -
“Yep.” Tony tips his drink to his mouth. It’s empty, but it’s something to do and he suddenly wants to hide his face. He wishes he still wore sunglasses as much as he used to.
“So,” Tony says, and then pauses. Pepper is eyeing them both from the car, window rolled down, her hand on the handle. Tony sighs again, louder this time.
Honestly, Tony thinks he does it because he doesn’t have anything else. After everything the guy has been through recently, why
Tony looks up at Steve and then back at the painting like he wants to keep staring at the painting for a long time, like he’s distracted by it. Steve hopes it’s a good distraction - the painting is not quite abstract, but it does blur out around the edges. The middle, though, is a figure that is caught between Iron Man and a knight in Arthurian armour, walking through the woods. The figure is walking through the only light in the painting, dark behind him and dark ahead. Below it is a quote that Steve had agonized over for a month before deciding to go with it:
He makes his way through the chips, then looks up when Clint beans him in the arm with a chocolate bar.
He looks over at Steve, who looks back. His back is straight, his shoulders are back. He meets Tony’s gaze.
Tony’s drafting the preliminary designs of his own version of a reinforced punching bag before he even exits out of the text.
Tony hesitates. Even bringing Steve down here feels like a massive risk, he doesn’t want to break down the suit’s secrets.
“For drawing a face,” Steve says. When Tony just looks at him: “Gotta make it convincing. Those birds are smart.”
In several minute-long bursts where Sarah is particularly busy with dinner, the worksheet gets completed. Tony coaches Steve through it with a patience that is definitely helped along by Sarah’s presence, and even he seems surprised when they reach the end and they haven’t yelled at each other again. They’d bickered, sure, but nothing that didn’t make Sarah laugh at them.
“What the hell is SHIELD anyway,” Rhodey says when Tony has rambled himself to a standstill. “I’ve never heard of those guys before, but suddenly that Cap is walking around, they’ve got their fingers in everything.”
Tony’s panting. He’s not unfit, his muscles can tell you that straight off, but he’s also not a super-soldier and hand-to-hand is especially tiring.
Tony is anxiously watching over the chickens that he’s just put down in their pen, watching them huddle and scratch around at stray shoots of grass, when he hears footsteps coming up the dirt drive.
“The rest of you get a warning,” Fury says. “No more fights in school, alright? Leave it for the weekends. Dismissed. Get out so I can finish this apple in peace.”
Even sitting in the Seats of Doom, which are what everyone calls the chairs outside the Principal’s office, Steve can’t help but feel a little good about the whole situation. He finally got to punch Ty. His friends remained ride-or-die. As Bucky nursed a black eye from being elbowed in the face, Sam sat wordlessly with them and Natasha gargled water from a fountain and spat it into the drain to get the remaining blood off her teeth, a little kernel of pride glowed in Steve’s chest.
“Thanks, Pep.” He waits until the door closes behind her, then says, “I gotta say, this is impressive. Even I believe I’m not Iron Man.”
One time she walks up behind him while he’s reading this poem and he slams it shut like he’s been caught gawking at a pin-up girl. He has to show her the book to prove to her he hasn’t been doing just that and she takes the book of poems and looks at him with a gaze that threatened softness, but didn’t give fully into it.
, with working parts that just needed to get fired up to be functioning again, and instead he gets to build this place from the ground up.
“Peachy!” Tony sits up, starts pulling electrodes off of him. “Hey, how much did you see when you were playing peeping tom?”
is after he’d taken them for a fly. Steve had been alight with energy after that, grinning and for once not standing at parade rest. He’s been more at ease around Tony after that, but it still looks like it takes him effort to put his guard down.
“I told you not to give me a discount,” Tony says, and Steve gets halfway into what’s obviously a lie before giving in.
Tony tries not to think about it. But if Obie got him kidnapped, if he’s trying to wrench the company out from under him - that means Rhodey could do something like that, too. It’s crazy, but Tony used to think that Obie would never hurt him, either.
Tony wonders just how much Pepper has told Rhodey, because he sure as hell hasn’t talked to him about it.
“I’ll hold you to that,” Steve says, and then they’re pushing in through the open door and into the party.
They all agree to shelve it for a different night than this. They can try to make it a lighter time, but no one really wants to settle in to watch any movie right now, let alone 12 hours of movie.
comes after the dinner, when Tony catches him in front of the elevator before Steve’s about to head up to bed.
“Oh, that was nice of him,” Obie says. “Tony doesn’t talk much about his old man, I’m glad he gets to do it with you. I gotta say, though, if it’s Howard stories you want, you’d be better off talking to me. I have the best ones. Not to say that Tony doesn’t-”
The Principal’s office door opens and Ty comes striding out. He doesn’t look at any of them, keeps his head high and his gaze straight ahead as he heads down the hall. He’s limping, which is gratifying - Tony must’ve gotten him even worse than Steve thought.
They soar skywards and then Tony turns them sideways so they start skating along the edge of the city. The lights blur, but only slightly - Tony keeps it slow, or thereabouts, for about thirty seconds, before twisting upwards and shooting towards the stars.
He suspects that it’d be his favourite story even without all the sentiment behind it, but nothing can take the spot of his favourite story after that.
“What? Shit.” Steve turns back to Tony, who is indeed pawing at his IV. Steve pushes Tony’s hand away and keeps it pressed against the bedsheets.
Less than a day later, Tony is in a car with Pepper, who keeps glancing at him like she’s waiting for him to disappear, on the way back from a press conference.
“This is simple,” Tony all but yells, and then lowers his voice like he’s visibly restraining himself. “It’s simple. This is as simple as I can get it. If you just do what I-”
Tony flops back against a pillow, sighing. He pretends not to notice the look that everyone trades - Obie’s dead, whatever, they keep looking at him like they expect him to break down over it. Tony’s had an adjustment period. He’s fine. He’s his brand new version of fine which is surprisingly less full of sharp edges than he thought it had to be.
Steve is suddenly very glad he’s not drunker than this. A few more beers and that would’ve definitely earned Ty a punch. As it is, Steve swallows the surge of anger that had risen in his stomach and says, “Wow, Ty. That’s more explicit than you ever get. Unless you get people alone a lot and then intimidate them the way you really want to, which wouldn’t surprise me. You seem like that kind of coward.”
“The most high tech piggyback in the world coming up,” Tony says. “Come on, no homo, lock those legs around me, Cap.”
At 1 on the dot, Steve shows up. Tony is already on his porch, with some planks of wood, nails, an old shirt and jeans, some hay, a hammer, a pillowcase and some twine.
That takes a second to click. “No dewdrop - it was good,” Steve says. He clears his throat. His voice is a lot hoarser than it was a few minutes ago. “‘S nice.”
He stops, reigns it back in. He hadn’t expected that, and now he’s breathing heavily. His eyes are shiny, heavy, so he blinks hard to get rid of that and hoists up a smile again.
“Yeah. Less-” Faraway stares and nightmares that JARVIS mentioned and talking like it took effort, like everything took effort, like he wished they had just left him in the ice. Tony never catches him crying or anything, but he walks into rooms and finds him staring out of windows, not moving. All of this still happens, but less so now.
Not long after, Steve opens his eyes. It’s quiet, except for the rain making comforting static outside. He’s lying in bed, and when he turns over, Tony is lying next to him, just starting to stir.
He brushes the weeds off her gravestone first. Then he polishes it the best he can with his jacket, then places a bunch of flowers against the stone.
“Are you going to get more animals,” Pepper asks - whispers, really, as she squats barefoot in the chicken coop holding a teenage Ferdinand.
Thus starts one of the most surreal times in Tony’s life: he watches Steve Rogers and Pepper Potts discuss their favourite art pieces. Steve is apparently excited to find out everything he’s missed while he was in the ice, and Pepper gives him some recommendations and tells him about some new things that have come up, art-wise. It sounds like gibberish to Tony but they’re both hyped about it, so he nods along and makes interested noises and keeps refilling their expresso cups.
ready for whatever’s about to happen, right until Tony gets through the slow-growing crowd and comes to stand next to Steve.
“Done,” Tony says. He finishes his coffee. Thinks about getting Barnes back out here to get him another one.
Steve pauses. Looks up at Tony again. He’s the same as ever - an effortlessly cool button-down and jeans that cost more than Steve’s monthly rent. He’s also uncharacteristically nervous, bouncing from foot to foot.
“-and quite a lot of thievery,” Pepper says as she emerges into the kitchen, tablet in hand. “Why are we talking about The Book Thief and can I join in?”
Tony doesn’t make a comment on why he hasn’t bothered to do so in the last few years, which Steve appreciates. After their rocky start, both of them have come to understand that there’s a lot of territory they probably shouldn’t bring up.
He’s idly coming up with a mental blueprint of the repulsors - one in each palm - as he hacks into a gym’s security cameras and watches Captain America break three punching bags, one after the other. He pays for them, because of course he does. Then he comes back the next day and breaks another couple punching bags. Rinse, repeat.
“I am going,” Ty says, all bared teeth as he lowers his voice to a hiss, “to get Tony back. You just watch.”
She comes forward and kisses both their heads, then heads into the kitchen saying something about ice cream. She’s in there for maybe a second before poking her head back out again.
They’d been running through Brooklyn and Steve had looked down a street that would lead him to the street his old apartment was on. His old apartment was a barber’s shop now, and he’d long since stopped going out of his way to stand and stare at it for five seconds before moving on, but he wanted to. He almost told Sam to change their route, but instead he kept running. Steve ran like if he ran fast enough, he’d get away from whatever he was feeling, but this time it didn’t work. He ended up getting overwhelmed and stopping in the middle of a park, just standing there until Sam noticed and jogged back. He’d asked Steve if he was okay, too, and Steve had given him the same wooden answer, and Sam hadn’t believed him either but he’d kept on going when Steve asked, though he did try to talk him out of it.
Rhodey gives him a look. Tony gives him one right back, and continues not to flinch as a bolt of pain hits his chest. Still healing - yeah, okay.
Steve eyes him. “Sometimes,” he says, and swallows. Folds his arms. “When I was out, I saw - there was a TV in a shop window. Your press conference was on it.”
They stand there until Sarah comes back into the lounge and they almost trip over each other trying to look normal. Going off of the look Sarah gives them, they don’t do a great job.
Tony nods. Squeezes Steve’s shoulder again, then drops his hand. After a few seconds, he says, “I’ve been thinking about doing another re-read. I always think about books differently if I re-read them every eight years or whatever. All this new context-”
“No one cares, Steve! If we raid the bathroom cabinet and leave it bare, no one will care. Come on.”
“I’ll live with it, then!” Steve realizes he’s yelling when Tony’s face tightens. He lowers his voice. “Look, I - I appreciate it. It’s a nice thing you tried to do. But this is too much-”
it?” Tony says, but ups the pace as they head for the next bus, which has indeed pulled up as their last bus had.
Obie has, thank god, given up on trying to talk Tony back into weapons manufacturing. He still obviously wants him to get back into it, but after a week he stops mentioning it. Tony assumes he’s biding his time, but he’s not worried. He’s not going to go back for anything.
“He doesn’t hit me,” Tony says, and it’s muffled in Steve’s shoulder. “Rhodey was worried too, at first. But he doesn’t hit me, so don’t worry about it.”
She kisses Steve on the head as she leaves, then she circles back around and kisses Tony on the head like an afterthought.
Tony’s getting eggs ready for transport into town when he gets a text from Steve, asking if he can come around. Tony sends back
It’s a Pablo Neruda poem. The fact of this sets something off in Steve’s brain, because he’s heard of him and he’s definitely read a few poems by him, and what he knows about Pablo Neruda is -
They stand there in the hall, and Tony waits. There’s an energy here that he doesn’t love, and he doesn’t know if he’s inventing it or if the others feel it too.
Steve keeps staring. When all she does is put the shoe down and keep eating her eggs, he says, “Who are you and what’d you do with Ma?”
“They finally let me go! I got a few naps under my belt, but I’m going to need to collapse in a big way...” She trails off. “Steve? Something wrong?”
, this is normal, we’re constantly around people who have grown up in one small town and stayed here their whole lives, or people who, who - fill their days with fishing and foraging and running small businesses-”
Tony shifts on the spot, but his smile turns more genuine. “Yeah, that’s fine. As long as everyone’s quiet about it.” He doesn’t look much convinced that they will be.
“I did have to get my English qualifications somewhere along the line,” Tony says dryly. “I do read, I just don’t have much time anymore. If I want to read I have to really carve out a time to do it.”
There’s not much anyone can do during the surgery, but the team stays in the waiting room for all six hours until the doctor comes out and says they’ll be able to see Tony soon.
Tony does jazz hands. It’s not his proudest moment. “And I’m fine now! Look at me! Hap, I’m just - I’m going to go talk to someone. It’ll take five minutes.”
“Done,” Tony says. He takes another chug of his water bottle, then checks his watch. “Lunch should be on right about now. You in?”
She laughs. It’s watery, but she covers that up fast. “Don’t worry,” she says. “I’ll be yelling at you soon. Give me - half an hour.”
“‘Course.” Steve is glad he’s already been sweating. It’d be embarrassing if sweat started showing up out of the blue. “It’s a bit of a step up from
“Okay,” Steve says. He wonders if he should - rub Tony’s back, or something. His Ma used to do that for him when he got sick, though she stopped after he told her he was too old for it.
to that question on the first try. “I - Tony stayed the night. On the couch,” he adds when Sarah’s face does a complicated series of expressions.
“I have a driver,” Tony says, like that’s a normal fucking thing to say. He does have the sense to look uncomfortable while saying it, which Steve - might give him credit for.
frowny face,” Natasha says, leaning over Bucky to take his chin in her hand and squeeze. Steve lets her do it for three squeezes, then bats her hand away.
Anyway, the quote. He’d been standing there in Brooklyn, on a street he'd once known off the back of his hand, thinking of Sam asking him what was wrong and it’d come to him as easy as anything:
It starts at the MOMA, where Tony tags along with Steve because “his schedule is suspiciously clear today” and he wants to hang out. Steve had originally meant to pay attention to the paintings, but he can do that and hang out with Tony. He’ll just have to come back someday for a more thorough look.
“Don’t talk about exes on the first date, Steve, God.” Tony taps something into the contract, then shows Steve:
He stays awake until he crashes or until Pepper comes down to check on him or Obie texts him or Rhodey calls. He eats when he remembers and tries to stay hydrated enough that he doesn’t get headaches, and tries to work on a thousand different things at once, all the while with the suit in the back of his head.
I ran into Rhodey and Pep and had friends for the first time in my life, and realized that I’d take them over college in a heartbeat. College will always be there when I get around to it. So what if I’m letting the Stark name down? I’m - I’m being a normal teenager. I have friends. That’s better than college.”
“Thank you for the offer,” Steve says. “But I do already have a copy. It’s not as good as my last one, but it does the job.”
Steve reads an unexpected amount during the war. War, after all, is mostly waiting around. He finds and reads old favourites like
a waste, or you sell them and get new shoes with that money, which doesn’t make any sense because you already have shoes here, so how about you just-”
Steve nods again. “I’ve heard that,” he says. “It’s on the list. But, uh. I might not read anything war-related for a while.”
“Also good,” she says. She meets Steve’s eyes, then says, “I was just about to make breakfast, how about you two boys come in and help out?”
Steve nods and digs into his cake. It’s lemon flavoured, which is nice. He’d mentioned that he’d like to try it a few months ago, so someone must’ve remembered. He doesn’t remember who he told it to, though, so he doesn’t know who to thank. He’ll have to come up with something later.
He just has to finish the suit. Everything else is slow - green energy and foriegn aid takes a lot of meetings and politics, but the suit is solely his. It’s his in a way nothing else has been before, in a way that makes him think he might have a soul after all.
Tony blinks at him, but before Steve can wonder if he’s messed up, Tony’s whole face creases in a laugh.
Tony snorts, but goes inside and grabs a marker. When he comes back out, Steve is already arranging the slim planks into a frame for the scarecrow.
It’s long since gotten dark out, but the Hammer house has so many lights up the driveway and around the house that it barely matters. One time, Steve has heard, they got a floodlight, but there are mercifully no floodlights tonight. Just the usual array of lights that were probably put up by workers, because Hammer is the kind of guy who doesn’t like to do his own work. He pays someone to do his homework for him.
“It obviously DOES, because look!” Tony grabs the sheet and scribbles out the workings, then the answer. “I just did it!”
“Damn,” Steve says. He straightens up, tomatoes in hand. “Sorry for making you come out here for two minutes of work.”
Tony’s laugh, when it comes, it less pitched and more relieved. He gives Steve an unreadable look, says, “Yeah. Hence, you. Good job back there, by the way. Didn’t give him an inch.”
The caution leaves her face, lapsing into pure brightness. “I can’t believe going for a walk worked! I thought you two were going to keep being dense until college. I’m a genius!”
But then comes the ordeal of making a scarecrow. A quick search tells Tony that it’s pretty easy, but when he mentions it around town when he’s buying groceries, Steve offers to come around and help.
“Nothing’s wrong with it, so unless you sneak into my room to sabotage it, you’re not getting at it anytime soon,” Bucky tells him. He nods towards the couch. “What doesn’t Sam know? Do we have enough time to get into this?”
“I want,” Steve says, and swallows. “I want - look, I don’t know how to say this, so. I figured I wouldn’t.”
Tony is feeling raw and vulnerable, despite his steady voice, which is probably why he starts to say, “I don’t have anyone but-”
Steve gives him another look. It starts off exasperated, but quickly turns heavier and sadder in a way that Tony has to look away from, because it’s not just about Obie, it’s about everything Tony isn’t Fine over. There’s an understanding there, a deep kind that says
. That’s one word for it. Tony runs over his plans in his head - not fully formed, sure, but they’re solid. Solid like a machine in his chest. He has it like a list, full of things to be ticked off. First off -
Clint emerges from his hoodie. “We should do a movie night,” he says, his voice rough even as it tries to be light.
He doesn’t expect a reply, and it doesn’t come for a while. Tony is finally heading up to bed 12 hours later, stumbling with weariness, when the text comes in.
It doesn’t get old. Tony flies them around until JARVIS mentions that someone’s posted a grainy photo of it online and Tony lands them on top of a building. It’s a skyscraper, and from here they can see most of the city.
bedroom. Tony introduces one of the bedrooms as “my second bedroom,” and then next to it pushes open a door that makes more sense.
Tony sighs. Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk, he thinks, and asks, “Want to see it in action?”
Tony makes another noise, not disgusted this time, but not much of anything else, either. He looks over at Steve and, hesitant, like he’s not sure it’ll be welcomed, he raises a hand and touches Steve’s cheek.
The jug finishes boiling and Tony pours each of them a cup, dumps the expresso in, then lets Steve handle the milk. He has his plain, which Tony can respect. He’s also eyeing the expresso machine like he’s judging Tony a little, which is fair. Small town folk, after all. Tony can’t bring himself to think anything bad about Steve for it.
“Okay, just-” Tony gets up. The chair scrapes. “Sorry, I’m not - this was a great breakfast and I’m sorry for being rude, but Steve, you’re a great guy and the least you deserve are shoes that keep the fucking
“I didn’t have any friends, either. Not until Bucky. But before that…” Steve shrugs. “You’re not pathetic.”
Steve texts Tony that he wants to meet up and Tony keeps the phone next to him, glancing over at it every thirty seconds, for about half an hour before he gives in and replies,
Tony looks over at Steve, who is watching and eating and looking pretty happy with himself. Tony feels himself grin, just in time for Steve to glance over and catch him at it.
Their lips touch, first gently, and at first it’s not much of anything. It’s a mouth against Steve’s mouth, like a hand against his hand, and Tony tastes like vodka, and there are no fireworks at all. Steve is vaguely disappointed, and a little panicked because
“Yeah. Rhodey made them.” Tony smiles against his will, the most genuine smile since he’s got here, which is a problem. He generally tries not to do genuine smiles if he knows he’ll be faking it around someone, and this seems like the kind of situation where he’ll be all fake, all the time. Or at least - strained. Hidden. When he notices he’s smiling into his coffee at the thought of Rhodey, he pulls it together into something more casual.
Steve straightens. Ty hasn’t left this time, instead he’s standing there like he’s waiting for something. Steve so badly wants to give it to him.
“Just wanted to say it, since you’re the kind of guy who’d finish a book out of sheer stubbornness.”
“Quit looking sad,” Bucky says, slinging an arm over Steve’s shoulder when Steve squishes into the small space left behind on the couch. “Your boyfriend’s gonna notice and ask why you’re all frowny-face.”
Steve laughs loud enough to startle them both. Tony watches him apologize and thinks that Steve might also feel weirdly grateful that he’s not the only one who’s this fucked up right now.
He clicks on the poem, and there it is. It’s a love poem. He reads it four times over, tracking over each line and sticking.
“Yeah!” Steve smiles hard, then tries to figure out how much is a normal amount to smile. Probably less. He smiles less, then says, “I’m most of the way through it.”
Time is not on his side. Tony can’t - he can’t move. Or, he can move, but so pathetically that it barely counts: thirty seconds of struggle after Obie leaves and all Tony’s done is slump sideways on the couch. Another thirty and he slides ungracefully to the floor, face slapping into it sideways.
“Fuck yes I will,” Tony says. “You want As? I can get you them. I’ll be a better teacher than Ms. Frizzle. And you can get a car or something with the ten grand. Do you have your license yet?”
Huh. Steve touches the spot Tony had flicked, right in the middle of the ‘O’ of ‘Hobbit.’ There’s been a lot of this kind of stuff in the future - remakes and sequels and the like, things he’s familiar with have morphed over time into something he doesn’t recognize. Sometimes that’s disconcerting, but other times -
“So we’re all hanging out in the kitchen,” Obie says, all fatherly friendliness with shit hanging on underneath. Tony is noticing all the underneath stuff a lot more since - well.
doesn’t know the depths of Ty’s antics. Omitting a lot of details, Fury gives them the low-down about how Fury has been looking for a chance to expel Ty, or at least force him to transfer schools, since sophomore year. It hasn’t been just school that Ty has been getting in trouble: there’s been trouble with police, even though all of it got smoothed over by some bribes to key people.
The next half hour is another kind of blur. Less so because his body’s giving out and more so that everything’s happening at once - he finds Pepper and then Obie and quickly realizes okay, taking Obie
, Tony thinks, and remembers the wide-eyed wonder of flight, gasping air, each breath a hard yank in his chest. The reactor had saved him, sure, but it had also taken about a quarter of Tony’s lungs.
, Steve thinks. Then he feels weird for thinking it, even sarcastically - this isn’t romantic, this is just. Him having his first kiss with a maybe-friend who he’s pretending to date.
No. That’d just give her fodder, and as far as Steve’s concerned, Tony was just looking for comfort. It seems like the kind of thing he’d do, looking for comfort in strange places. He dated
“Anyway,” he says. “That’s all I wanted to say. Oh, and I love you. I love you, Ma. I’ll see you later, okay? I hope you’re having a good time up there.”
Steve is having a perfectly normal day right up until Tony Stark appears in front of his desk in Algebra.
Steve nods, the pressure soft against Tony’s head. There’s a day ahead but for now there’s this bed, and the kind of rain that only adds to the quiet, and Tony lying in front of him, looking at him in a way that Steve’s read about a thousand times, but never tires of reading again.
“So are you two dating yet,” Sarah asks, and Steve is glad he doesn’t have egg in his mouth, because he would’ve choked.
Steve thinks about texting him, asking if he’s okay, but he doesn’t know if Tony will appreciate it.
Tony twists away from the blast that follows, and the heat hasn’t gone away when consciousness starts to slip away from him. There’s air on his hands - both bare now - and his heart is thudding, but weakly. He thinks Pepper might be calling his name, which is nice. Also means she’s alive, which is what matters.
Sarah heads into the kitchen, which is half-separated from the lounge by a counter, and is otherwise more or less the same room as the lounge. She hums as she starts getting things out of the fridge.
thought he was nice,” Sarah calls, and Steve turns around out of the sheer wrongness of that statement.
which he blazes through and then picks up the biggest collection of James Baldwin essays that he can find.
“I feel like your idea of outrageous is different than my idea of outrageous,” Tony says, coming forwards to drape his arms around Steve’s shoulders.
you gave me - I didn’t mean to lose it, it was out of my control, but. I did lose it. But - someone found it recently and gave it back to me.”
Tony snorts. “What if I am up to something? Gonna turn me in? That guy, whatsisface - Coulson, he’s been sniffing around and I don’t know if I buy his whole ‘my suit’s too big and I totally don’t notice, this definitely isn’t a farce to make me seem unthreatening’ schtick. I know the type.”
He’s cut off by Sarah Rogers, who comes inside in her scrubs, pulling her hair out of her ponytail and chucking her handbag on the couch and shucking off her jacket onto a hook, all the while saying, “Stevie, remember how you said no one would throw up on me this week and I told you to touch wood so you wouldn’t jinx it but there wasn’t any wood about ‘cause we were in the supermarket, well,
Kissing is nice. Making out - it feels like this is what they’re doing now, what with all the touching - making out is
“Wow,” Tony says after a pregnant silence. “That sounded way more pathetic out loud than it did in my head.”
He takes the book with him whenever he moves. He stores it somewhere safe. When he gets into Eriskine’s experiment, he almost leaves it behind - something to come back to - but changes his mind when he runs his fingers over Ma’s inscription. He takes it, leaves the rest of his books behind, and instead reads books with titles like
Tony starts into the lawnmower with a screwdriver. He spares a thought, as he does much less often now, to this situation: repairing a lawnmower in a friend’s backyard as the guy goes inside to get him homemade lemonade. He never thought he’d end up here.
“Alright,” Tony says as they sit down. “I did some examples of this new theory we’re on. You can copy it down, then we can apply it to new problems. Sound good?”
Ty smiles tightly down at him, because he’s the kind of guy who uses his height to intimidate people. Not overtly - just enough to make it clear who’s winning in this big dick contest.
Tony stares at it. Looks up at Steve uncertainty, but also with brimming panic, which - isn’t great. Panic wasn’t an emotion that Steve wanted to be present with this.
Sarah hums, eyeing the bowl, but she doesn’t bring it up. “So, you’ll never guess what I heard at work last night.”
“Now,” Tony says. “You have superstrength, so if you fall off it’s your own fault and I will not stop to catch you. You did it to yourself.”
From the other couch, where he has disappeared into his hoodie, Clint says, muffled: “Are you two nerds quoting
“It’s not,” Steve says. “It’s - you went to boarding school with kids way older than you, right? And before that-?”
But when Steve doesn’t say anything, Tony slowly reaches up and takes the book. He flips it open to the bookmark, looking up at Steve like
He turns and starts to leave, but he does a double-take upon seeing Steve. His mouth opens and closes.
It invades his dreams: Tony in the suit, falling, except The Hulk never gets there to save him, but it’s alright because the ground never comes up to hit him. Tony just keeps falling, glinting in the light like a star.
“I know what silkies are, Pepper, I’m friends with Thor. He has a lot of Opinions on chicken breeds. I’m thinking about it.”
He’s still thinking about it, unsuccessfully trying to shake it off, when his phone lights up with a text. He’s trying to sleep, so he ignores it, but then his phone vibrates with more texts, one after the other, so Steve picks it up.
Tony squeezes his shoulder. Steve waits for him to kiss his cheek, but Tony just walks off, back to his table, where Rhodey and Pepper immediately start in on him in, Steve expects, the same way that his friends immediately close in.
Should he have offered a handshake, Steve wonders? Before he can do anything about that, they pull smoothly out into the street.
“Maybe,” he allows. He clears his throat, sits back. “Anyway, you’re - distracting. Do the work, you big layabout.”
“So you…” Steve skims a finger over one of them. It looks like some Good Will Hunting shit. “Decided to get started on your college degree in Math-That-Hasn't-Been-Officially-Invented?”
Tony slaps a hand on his arm. “I thought you would. Little guy taking on impossible odds for no reason other than he can and should.”
“Right, of course.” Coulson seems to notice the handshake has been going on too long and lets go. “You haven’t been announced to the public yet. I’m - yes.”
“Everything,” Steve says. “I see you in class, you don’t do anything, but you always score high on tests. And you correct the teachers sometimes. Everyone says you could be in college already if you wanted, but you’re keeping yourself back. There’s a bunch of rumours about why.”
Two hours later, he’s still hungry. He’s hunched in a tiny chair next to a river, he’s properly baited the line, and he hasn’t had any nibbles for the last hour and a half.
“Oh, no,” Sam says. “No, definitely not. Tony kissing you at a party. Tony coming to you when he’s at his lowest, asking for support. Tony trying to fool around with you. No, he’s not your boyfriend at
There’s still a lot of maintenance to do, and Tony slowly crosses things off his (intimidatingly large) to-do list. Clear up the entire goddamn farm: check. Fix the chicken hut: check, apart from replacing the rusted chicken wire. Learn how to chop wood effectively: check. Get the equipment and materials to build a silo and a greenhouse: check. BUILD the greenhouse and silo - ongoing.
Their joint refusals get waved down. “Come on, it won’t take long and I’m making eggs on toast. Everyone loves a good old eggs on toast. In you come.”
His graze tracks over Steve’s face, eyebrows furrowed. He breathes in like he’s about to say something, then stops. Then he leans in and kisses Steve, soft enough that Steve thinks faintly of blessings; and then firmer, opening his mouth, at which point Steve doesn’t think of much at all.
“I’m focusing,” Steve says, pushing the textbook up so he can see a sliver of what Tony’s been working on. “Tony, this looks really complicated. You should be in college. You should be doing
You can forage for mushrooms and find fish in the river that are edible and no one yells at you for taking them home and you can walk literally everywhere and all the while people will wave and ask you about your day and actually seem to give a shit when you tell them about it.
“As always,” Obie says. He laughs. Keeps his hand on Tony’s shoulder. “So how did you two meet? Steve, when I got to meet you at SHIELD, you mentioned that you hadn’t gotten the chance to meet Tony yet.”
“I know,” Steve says. Judging how Tony’s gaze drops to the floor, his brain goes the same place Steve’s does.
“Just ordered it in,” Steve says, settling back into his chair. It’s one of those absurdly comfy ones, which are opposite the absurdly uncomfy ones which look a hundred times better but aren’t worth the back pain.
Tony lowers his glass. What contacts does Steve have with SHIELD, and how fucking tuned in were they?
Steve fights the urge to roll his eyes. “Oookay. Look, just move and you can insult me at school on Monday, alright?”
“Of course not,” Fury says. “Tiberius has just decided that this isn’t the best place for him to finish his high school education. His
He’s hoping to grab some food and retreat up to his room for the rest of the day, but Tony intercepts him just before he can leave the kitchen. Tony tries to make small talk and Steve does his best to reply in kind, but something must be off in his face, because Tony puts a hand on his shoulder and asks, “Hey, you doing alright?”
“Sounds good,” Steve says, and peers over the notebook Tony slides over to him. He looks at the algebra, but his gaze quickly slides up to the series of complicated equations in the first half of the page. “What’re these?”
“Happy to help,” Steve says, and finds he kind of means it. Even with the whole he-used-to-date-Ty thing, Tony is an okay guy.
“No thanks,” he says, and looks back down at his algebra worksheet. He’s supposed to have answered ten questions, he has five completed and the class starts in two minutes. He doesn’t have time for whatever shenanigans Tony is involved in this week.
Steve is quiet for a second, then: “Fine. Thinking about how long it’ll be before I get sent back into active duty.”
“I guess I’ll make an appearance,” Tony says, then looks sideways at Steve. “Orrr… we could make a joint appearance? It won’t help you if you want to get laid-”
“Can’t abandon my boyfriend,” Tony says at some point, and Steve has had enough beers that he lets himself imagine it: things would still be the same, they’d still be standing close together and touching more than necessary, but there would be a weight behind it. It’d be
“She’s fine,” Tony says. “She fought off a hedgehog the other day. Did you know hedgehogs are dangerous to chickens?”
Sam throws a pillow at him. Bucky catches it in mid-air and lobs it back onto the couch. Steve notes that he somehow finds the maturity not to throw it back in Sam’s face.
The couple apologize, but they take a while to get enough coordination to get themselves out the door and close it behind them.
“You get what you signed up for,” Steve says, which effectively stops the conversation in its tracks. They stand there for a few more seconds before Steve says, “Well, bye,” and Tony blurts the same back at him, and Steve leaves Tony to head to his class.
Steve considers. He usually doesn’t go to Hammer parties either, content to hear about them on Natasha’s snapchat story, but -
Steve laughs. “What, I should fight you because Tony used to date you? He’s allowed to have dated other people before me.”
Some days are better than others, but Steve hasn’t had a day like this in months. The first six or so after the ice had been like he was experiencing things with a sheet of glass between him and the world, able to see things but unable to interact with them properly. He’d learned some helpful words about this from the therapist he’d been ordered to see - words like
“I’m still not taking the shoes,” Steve says, but he steps back to allow Tony to head inside before following him in. He puts the shoes on the couch - they haven’t been worn yet, so it’s fine - and goes into the kitchen, where Sarah hands him the egg carton and tells him to crack six of them into a bowl.
She’d stared at him, halted where she’d been halfway through pulling off her jacket. Then she’d let it hang off her as she slowly massaged her forehead.
She’d sighed and finished pulling off her jacket. “I’m sure you had a good reason,” she’d said, and come to inspect his bruises. As she was tilting his face around,  she’d added, “Also, you’re grounded for the three days you’re suspended.”
Sarah hands him a capsicum and an onion, then gives Tony a knife, and when Steve finishes cracking eggs he watches Tony chop vegetables next to his Ma, who is chopping mushrooms, and realizes that Tony probably hasn’t had to cook anything in his life. He holds a knife like it might leap up and bite him. When he dumps his veggies into the eggs mixture, Tony’s vegetables are wildly uneven next to Sarah’s mushrooms.
“Yup,” Tony says. “Got instructions from Wikihow. But since you’re the scarecrow master - do we need anything else?”
AF guy laughs. “If it’s an emergency, there are quicker things than fish,” he says, and bends down near Tony’s feet. He rummages for a few seconds and comes up with a startlingly large number of mushrooms.
and Steve had to relent, but made him start hand-to-hand training anyway - Steve says, “So you read the
He’s groggy, and of course he tries to take the IV out of his arm and looks affronted when Steve stops him.
of that, at least not right now, but the idea of Sam Gamgee circles around in his head for a long time as Tony heals. Sam Gamgee, but also Liesel Meminger, who lost everyone she loved and then built up a life from the ashes; a life and a lot of loves.
,” Steve says. He glances behind him, closes the door a bit more with his foot. “I can’t take them.”
“I-” Steve sighs. Bucky and Natasha are coming in, both of them giving him a look when they notice him talking to Tony. They’re going to have a field day.
Thor claps him on the shoulder, gently, as to not disturb the chicks in the box, and then sends Tony on his way.
Tony touches the frame. It’s easier than touching the painting, which is… a lot. Tony swallows over a sudden lump in his throat. It’s ridiculous, and he feels stupid for being so effected, but - it’s his house, which he’s fixed up. There’s his crops peeking out of a corner, sunflowers in full bloom - it’s summer in the painting, with rays of light coming in from the distance.
Steve laughs. “Thor loves it when someone else gets chickens. He doesn’t like to send them off to faraway farms, but when someone in town gets them - he likes to know they’re being taken care of. So he makes sure people know what they’re doing, chicken-wise.”
Ty laughs, louder this time. Steve watches the crowd, which is patchy as people slow and then just stand there, waiting. Ty has never gotten into a fistfight, but Steve used to be notorious for them, and there’s not a student here that doesn’t want to see Ty get punched.
That gets him. Tony’s eyebrows pull inwards. “Feel like I should be asking you that. How was - I mean, do you - dewdrop?”
Tony looks down at the ticket he’s been holding onto ever since Steve told him to keep it, and then apologizes when he bumps into a woman as he follows Steve off the bus.
Happy checks it with Tony twice - yes, he’s really going to be fine if he leaves - before he heads off down the hall. After he’s out of earshot, Tony says, “Sorry to interrupt. You go for a lot of runs?”
Next to him, Happy looks like he’s about to have an aneurysm, but doesn’t want to let it show. Tony knows how he feels, but he’s hiding it better.
Tony does. As Steve hammers the frame into place, Tony stuffs straw into the pillowcase and the jeans, tying them all off with twine. Then he directs Steve into the right position in the middle of the field and watches Steve hammer the frame into the ground, then hands him the shirt, which Steve drapes over the frame, and then the straw, which Steve stuffs into the shirt, and then they split the twine and tie off a sleeve each.
“Kinda,” Artist Farm guy says. “This is a notoriously bad spot to fish. You’ll have better luck five minutes up the river.”
“I just,” Tony says, and pauses. “I said - I offered to get him out of his apartment. Told him I had the room. Said I’d try to make it so no one could throw him at the first random threat that pops up.”
Tony’s wearing goggles, welding a blowtorch. He starts grinning when he sees the book in Steve’s hand. “Come to hit me with it and cry?”
Steve is heading to pick up the bowl when the front door open. He jumps, but it’s just Ma, who comes in and sighs when she sees Steve.
because people stole things from his actual room, and Jarvis might care more about Tony than either of his parents do, even if he seems at a loss at how to help his situation -
. Steve used to watch the TV and wonder how people didn’t get bored by it, all the kissing, but now he gets it. This is electric. It’s at the very least static electricity.
“Ouch,” Tony mutters. Then, louder, “I could help you with your algebra. If that’s something you’re having problems with.”
Steve makes a noise not unlike a yelp and pulls away. He’s not sure what to say at first, and then he opens his mouth and “Dewdrop” comes out.
“He moved in,” Tony says, pulling on his shirt. When Pepper’s wide-eyed look returns, tinged with incredulity: “We didn’t sleep together! Come on, Pep, he’s from the
“If it’ll give you something to do,” Tony says finally, “I guess I’ll let you watch over me, Mother Hen.”
“Yeah,” Tony says. “Uh. Didn’t think I’d adjust well to farm life, but - it’s growing on me. I came here so I wouldn’t have to go back to the city, but I never thought I’d actually do it. But - I don’t know. I might actually stick around.”
“What would you say about getting out of that shithole SHIELD put you into,” Tony says. “An easy, convenient location to store you until they need you. You just know they’ve bugged the place.”
It’s pretty chilled out, honestly. Steve gets more or less used to holding hands with Tony in the halls, and sitting with him at lunch - Tony drags Pepper and Rhodey over more often than not after the first week, and they turn out to be cool to talk to. Both of them are smart in a way that intimidates Steve, but neither of them are haughty about it, so they get along. They’re both down to earth in a way that makes Steve wonder how they ended up friends with Tony, but Steve is also kind of friends with Tony, so he can’t judge.
it is, so he rocks back and forth a few times. It squeaks. He should fix that later. He could do that before he leaves.
“Hey,” Steve says. “The, uh, group dinner is happening tomorrow, by the way. I know you’re probably busy-”
The thing is, Tony’s been distancing himself from everyone since he got back. Obie, sure - but also Rhodey, Pepper, Happy. They’ve all mentioned it to him, been worried about how deeply he’s digging into his work, all that intensity, like nothing else does matter.
“Shit,” Tony says, quiet enough that no one without superhearing could hear it. He thinks about shoving Steve into the nearest room and acting casual. He has a bizarre moment where he seriously considers shoving Steve against the wall and making out with him as a distraction that Obie will walk away from, but he disregards that just as Obie turns down the hall.
“Let’s hope I’m wrong,” Tony says. “I’d prefer that I’m just a paranoid dick who thinks that the closest thing he’s got to family is plotting to kill him when really he just wants me to be okay.”
Obie cuts off when he sees Steve. There’s a moment of undisguised shock before he recovers, coming up and clapping Steve on the shoulder.
Tony blinks. “Sure,” he says, and then with a teasing smile that doesn’t go all the way to his eyes: “What a good boyfriend.”
Tony nods, eyes on his tablet. Obie’s been saying a lot of things about assets and who Tony should talk to and what Tony should do for the company - he’s much more involved than he was before Tony’s kidnapping, but Tony isn’t surprised. He did announce a huge overhaul of SI, which means that there will be changes abound.
okay,” Tony says, and waits for Steve to laugh and nod before scrawling a smiley face onto the stuffed pillowcase. He adds some angry eyebrows for good measure.
It’s overflowing with stuff. Where the second bedroom was bare, this room had blueprints over the walls and a star map on the ceiling; desks were scattered with sheets of complicated equations and half-finished experiments and what look like gears from a car. Or maybe not from a car. Steve doesn’t know much about gears, but Tony has definitely been making something in this room.
“It’s no problem,” Tony says quietly, down at his food. He’s eating very fast but very neatly, like he wants to get out of here as soon as he can but he won’t make a mess to do it. “Least I can do.”
“Uh-huh,” Steve says. He’s scuffing his feet. It’s a habit his Ma scolded him out of as a kid, but apparently he’s just been repressing the feet-scuffing and it’s been waiting to resurface. Who knew?
Steve visits once a day and sits around as he and Tony talk about James Baldwin or a scifi novel one or both of them read as a kid, and sometimes poetry, during which Steve determinedly doesn’t bring up Pablo Neruda.
A few weeks later, Steve and Sam emerge from the elevator into the lounge. Both of them are sweaty, but Sam is the only one who’s panting. Steve is struggling against it, but he’s not about to give Sam the satisfaction.
Steve and Tony get dropped off at home and they head straight for the workshop. Iron Man is running on every news outlet, but Tony doesn’t think about that as he stares at Mark II. He’s already formulating new versions.
Tony’s head rolls sideways to look at him. He snorts, and Steve realizes that Tony is probably drunk. Then Tony shifts closer and Steve gets a whiff of his breath and realizes that Tony is
Tony sends Pepper and Rhodey frequent updates and is relieved to hear their twin confusion at the town’s generosity. At least it’s not just him who’s confused.
Tony wonders what the guy’s been doing with his time, other than beating gym bags to pulps. Does he read? Watch sitcoms? Do crossword puzzles and lament his tragic lot in life?
Pepper is only partly into a frown before her face smooths out again. “Well. There’s the subject matter, but-”
It takes some convincing - along with a promise that JARVIS won’t get audio or video of Steve unless it’s an emergency - but Steve moves in that night.
Tony nods and tries not to feel weird about holding a box of living creatures, all of whom are peeping adorably. “I’ll let you know.”
He turns. There’s a guy coming down the hall in a new-looking pair of sweatpants and a hoodie, which is enough to make Tony think
“Wow, thanks,” she says, but she’s already in the middle of putting her cup in the sink. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Tony. Don’t forget, you’re supposed to take a call-”
Tony and Rhodey make twin hums of agreement beside him. Their eyes stay locked to the screen. Steve watches them with vague amusement, but only for a moment, because then his own gaze goes back to the screen.
There’s a series of noises of agreement around the lounge, some more exasperated than others, but it’s better than the grave silence than before.
“Aw,” Ty says. He doesn’t stop stroking Tony’s face, even as Tony unfreezes and tries to pull back. “You don’t know what Tony likes.”
Tony takes in the view. It’s still strange, all this land rolling out into the distance - no tall buildings, nothing to puncture the horizon, all of it just going on and on. It’s strange, but Tony is getting used to it, and even if he wasn’t - he still likes it. He likes a lot of things about living here.
“I don’t know how well I’m gonna take care of it,” he admits. “I’m, uh. Very green. Is that a term you use? Green?”
age. That’s hilarious. I love it,” Tony says, still giggling weakly. He takes a gulp of juice, then looks into the glass, swilling it around. Steve assumes he’s thinking about how watery it is, considering to his usual pulpy juice that rich people drink. Do rich people drink orange juice? Or do they drink fancier fruit juices? Pomegranate juice, or - kale juice. No, that would be awful.
When Tony looks over, Steve’s eyes are on the screen and his face is impassive. Is this how guys flirted with other guys in the 40s? Is Tony being flirted with? Tony is 90% sure he’s being flirted with.
Tony forces his shutting-down body to turn his head and look at Obie. Or, more accurately, slump his head in Obie’s direction and move his eyes so he’s looking into Obie’s face again. Obie is smiling, calm and satisfied, and claps him on the shoulder like a full stop,
“Cool,” Steve repeats under his breath, and is jolted from his worries when the bus pulls over at their stop. “Come on, sometimes the next bus comes when this one parks.”
He’s grudgingly thankful that she did when he walks out of school at the end of the day into rain so heavy it’s hard to see far ahead. He sighs and starts for the bus stop, which is a few blocks away. He’s soaked after one.
Steve does a double take. He stares long enough that Tony notices, and when Tony notices, Steve looks back at the painting and takes a chance on sounding like a pretentious asshole.
“Great,” Tony says. He clears his throat loudly, flashes his teeth in the way Natasha now won’t have to. “I’m good. I’m - relieved! Thank god he’s gone. He was getting really irritating.”
Flight, the wonder of it, along with the first glimpse of the sky in a long time. The crash, climbing out of a metal skeleton. Looking into the distance and seeing nothing but sand. That first step, and then the second. The thousandth step. The ten-thousandth. Walk or lie down and die, and even if you keep walking you might die anyway -
Which, as it turns out, is easy to do. One reason fake-dating gets so easy is that it’s pretty easy talking to Tony in a way a boyfriend might - that is, Steve can look deeply engaged in their talks and laugh a lot. It’s also far too easy to let his gaze linger on Tony’s face, his eyes and lips; to lean in close when he talks; to touch in a casual way when they’re within touching distance, entwining their hands or pressing their shoulders together or sitting close.
“I don’t know!” Steve looks around where he’d been standing. “Do rich people just keep knives lying around the laundry rooms-”
“Hello,” Steve says. He takes a Fiddlehead Fern shoot and presses it through the chicken wire. “You hungry, fella?”
Around about this time, the scarecrow that Tony has been using - which had been leftover from when his mother’s family owned the farm - gives up the ghost for good, which is fine, because Tony has been meaning to replace it anyway.
Steve doesn’t have to think hard. “She became a writer. She wrote prize-winning novels and everyone loved them. She got a husband who she could argue with, but the good kind of arguing, the kind she likes. She had a few kids and was nicer to them than Rosa, but uses Rosa’s methods sometimes. Uh. What do you think?”
Yeah, Tony’s definitely being flirted with. He doesn’t try the ‘arm over the shoulder yawning trick’, but it’s a close call.
Steve feels his smile get looser. He reigns it in and determinedly doesn’t look at Sam or Bucky, who he
Steve concentrates on his own steps, because it doesn’t matter how long he’s lived here - whenever he gets too confident, that’s when he trips. He makes it to the top of the stairs, unlocks the door, and steps into the apartment.
“Yeah! Of course.” Steve does his best to smile with his weight behind it. “Want to keep sitting at lunch together?”
Tony sighs. He’s sitting very straight and has been fiddling with his watch like it’s going to give up the world’s secrets since before they sat down.
Right as he’s looking over at Tony, Steve’s grin freezes in its tracks. If Ty leaves the school - leaves the
weird,” Steve says. “Also, the most depressing compliment I’ve ever gotten. The first time someone sees my dick, says it’s nice, and it’s
He falls into a car and crushes it when he flies back to the workshop, which is - fine. Tony honestly doesn’t care about the car, or his more-than-wobbly landing. He pries the suit off of him, vibrating with adrenaline all the while, yelling notes to JARVIS as each piece falls to the workshop floor.
“Sure,” Tony says. He gets up, brushes himself off and steps into the vegetable garden. “Need any help carrying things in?”
“We were having a normal conversation,” Tony says. “Are Sam and Bucky finished going for each other’s throats? Can we continue with dinner now?”
“I’m rested! I’m good. Don’t give me that look. I’m - locked and loaded and ready to party, let’s go.”
It’s in this line of thinking that Steve almost doesn’t give Tony his birthday present. He paints it the week before and then wrestles with himself for the whole of Tony’s birthday week about whether or not it’s too much. The only reason he ends up giving it to Tony is the fact that Tony had given him his copy of
Then she goes on eating. Steve resists the urge to give her a pointed look and keeps his eyes on his plate instead. He can feel a pair of eyes on his face, but this time it might be Tony. He doesn’t look up to check. He pierces another pea on the tine of his fork.
Steve circles the suit slowly, eyeing it in a way that makes Tony want to vibrate out of his skin. Steve bends a little to get a look at the suit’s waist and legs, and then reaches out. He glances over at Tony, hand in mid-air, and then when Tony nods, he touches a plate than runs down the hip.
Steve gets a few more hits in and receives a few back before Bucky can pull Ty off, at which point the fight ends when Tony runs up and brings his foot down hard on Ty’s groin.
“Why would it be a dig at you,” Steve says, and before Tony can answer, Steve says, “We wouldn’t have to - do anything, right?”
He gives Steve his number. Steve has a cellphone, and neither of them comment on that, which Steve seems grateful for. Steve texts him so Tony will have his number -
“No, I’ll get it,” Tony says. He pushes himself up, wobbles a bit, but the walk to the kitchen is straight and unwavering. Steve watches Tony skull a glass of water, then another, then come back to the couch.
Steve almost wishes he would bring it up. He’s not happy about wearing the shoes, and only wears them because there’s supposed to be a downpour today - that, and this morning his Ma caught him trying to leave in his torn shoes and argued him out of it.
The driver - old guy, kind face, very smartly dressed - blinks, as if he hadn’t expected an introduction. “Oh, hello. My name is Jarvis.”
Steve picks up his shoe and puts a finger through the new hole. It’s a lot bigger than the gash in his foot, which is both lucky and unlucky.
“I try not to, with bullies,” Steve says. He squeezes Tony’s hand again, because it feels like the thing to do and also he’s constantly hyper-aware that he’s holding someone’s hand. It’s a weight at the back of his head in a way that he hadn’t expected.
Tony’s stomach grumbles again. He makes a face, scrubs at a mushroom and then pops it into his mouth.
Tony waves, breaking out into a grin. Steve waves back, with a sense of relief he doesn’t know how to pin down, and heads over.
He reaches into the lawnmower, screws in something that had come loose, then starts it up. The lawnmower roars to life.
“Anything about Tolkien, apparently,” Steve says. “And the release dates for the Lord of the Rings series.”
“Nope,” Tony says, and Steve looks up at him. Tony’s very relaxed, in a way that he never was in the first few months of their friendship. Nowadays he’s relaxed in a way that Steve didn’t think Tony could get.
“Nope,” Steve says. “I went once in freshman year. Someone puked on my shoes and I had an allergic reaction to a cake because I ate it and didn’t realize it had nuts in it.”
Tony’s opening his mouth to say something when Steve scuffs a little too hard and a shoe catches on something sharp and rips hard enough that it impales the shoe and slices into Steve’s foot.
“The city friends?” Natasha raises her eyebrows. “That’s nice of them. Let us know if they end up coming, we’ll give them a Stardew Valley welcome.”
They meet up on the football field after school to go over the details. Steve sits down on the grass and after a moment Tony sits, too.
, which he re-reads until its lavish and frequent descriptions of homecooked dinners make him long for non-ration food enough that he gives it to a soldier and tells him to keep it.
“I’m glad you stayed, by the way,” Steve says. He picks up a glass of lemonade from the porch, just beside his chair. “We thought you might get your fill of Stardew. Take off back to the city.”
“Quiet,” Steve says. He takes five steps and is in the vegetable garden, where he starts plucking tomatoes off of their vines. “I’m gonna make lunch, then work on a commission for someone in Ohio. Oh, also, I - should be finished with your soon.”
Steve tears through the book in two days. It’s partly because he doesn’t have much to do, and partly because - well, he wants to talk to Tony about it. Sometimes when they get the time they’ll talk about
“Steve,” Cap says, in such a rush that Tony thinks that he’s been holding back on it. “You don’t have to call me Cap. My name’s Steve.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Bucky pats her knee. “You’re a secretly trained government agent. Or a. I don’t know, who else gets training into reading people?”
Tony gets Pepper down in the workshop for her tiny hands. She deals with the situation - ‘the situation’ being changing over the reactor - very competently, except for the part where she pulls out something she shouldn’t and Tony starts heading very fast towards cardiac arrest. Even then, she makes sure he doesn’t die, just like he knew she would. Her voice gets all high and panicky, sure, but so would anyone’s if they just got told they put their boss-slash-friend towards life threatening peril and had a limited time frame to prevent it.
The next morning, Steve wakes up with a hangover so mild he thinks he imagines it. It gains traction the more time he spends awake, but then he chugs a few glasses of water and it subsides. He really doesn’t get how people can drink so much that they wake up with destructive hangovers - he’s done that one time and quickly decided that once was enough.
“You’re way too happy about this,” Tony says. He’s also in the Seats of Doom, but Fury has clarified that he’s only there to add his own side of the story.
Steve glances over at the punching bag. He doesn’t say anything, but Tony finds himself wondering what demons Steve has hiding under all that barely-constructed calm.
“Tell me about Pablo Neruda being an asshole,” he says. “And you can give me your blue M&Ms if you’re not going to eat them.”
Behind them on the TV, Rhodey is telling the crowd that Tony is about to come out. Tony heads for the door. Steve follows, and just as Tony’s about to step out he touches Steve’s arm and gives what he hopes is a reassuring smile.
Obie’s eyes are on him and Tony knows he’ll want more details later, that he’s going to ask why Tony hadn’t told him he’d met Captain America before this, why he hadn’t been planning with him on how to make him
“Oh,” he hears someone say, and it must be him, because the voice sounds just as choked as his throat suddenly feels. He takes a breath to steady himself, but it doesn’t help - there’s heat stinging behind his eyes and the lump in his throat just keeps growing.
“How’s the farm going,” Bucky asks as he picks up the fork with the hand that’s not holding the sandwich.
“We’re not,” Steve says, and then kisses Tony on the cheek, making it smack extra loud. “Schnookums.”
“You were on your yaucht,” Coulson says, and he keeps talking but Tony tunes out, looking over at Steve, who is leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. Steve is watching the TV, but Tony has barely been looking at him for two seconds before Steve meets his eyes.
The week after, when the guilt has mostly faded and Steve has talked about the incident to his therapist - he’s not the only one, all of the Avengers go to therapists semi-frequently - the movie night commences.
“Don’t go,” Tony says, and then swallows. His eyes are closed and he doesn’t sound very coherent as he mumbles, “
“And delusional,” Steve continues. He dodges Sam’s halfhearted punch and then bends to take off his shoes.
“Just the chickens,” Tony says, and pauses. “Actually, Pepper and Rhodey have talked about coming to visit.”
Tony’s more coherent after that day, which is good, because it means he stops trying to take his IV out every time he wakes and remembers, again, that it’s there. Granted, he only does this because whenever he wakes up there’s someone in his room glaring at him and telling him not to, but still.
After she clicks the last bit into place and stands back, shaking. Her hands are slimy and she holds them in front of her like she doesn’t know what to do with them.
“Uh, the author wrote some more books after this one,” Steve says. “They’re good. You’d like them, I think. Maybe it’d take you a while to get into them, but I think you’d like them. The ideas in them, anyway. I, uh, I miss you.”
Steve turns the tap on so cold water runs into the newly-plugged sink. He squirts dishwashing liquid into it and waits. He leans against the sink as Tony stands in place like he isn’t sure what’s safe to lean against.
Tony heads down the hall. He doesn’t make it far before he runs into Steve - he’s only a few feet from the kitchen doorway.
He pockets the book and touches the gravestone one last time before turning away, just over the date of birth.
“Hey, does the series have, uh.” Steve pauses. Folds his arms, then wonders if he did it to mimic Tony. He’d read those articles about how mimicking people makes them feel more at ease. “This might be a naive question, but does it have a happy ending?”
He sees Steve around town, sometimes out and about, sometimes buying something at a store, sometimes with his canvas propped up on an easel and painting a landscape or someone’s kid. He always waves when he sees Tony and asks him how things are going. When Tony mentions that he’s thinking of getting chickens soon, Steve directs him to the chicken guy, Thor, who - upon Tony’s request - doesn’t give him any, but gives him a long,
“Yeah, but you always - the things you say sometimes, Tony. You go off on tangents about something that no one knows anything about, and when you do it to teachers you leave all of them in the dust. You know it and they know it.”
“Not as a rule,” Tony says. He squats down next to Steve’s foot. “There’s probably a first aid kit if we hunt around.”
“I know, a mere two bedroom apartment,” Steve says. “You can put your bag on the couch, we’re sit at the kitchen table.”
He glances over at Steve, who is digging into Tony’s shepard’s pie. He doesn’t look concerned, so Tony continues, “Virgina, Ferdinand, Henrietta, Mary, Kit and Steve Jr.”
Now they’re coming back in full force, and Steve wants to say that he doesn’t know why, but he kind of does. It’s the usual mix of bad small things, bombed with not following his therapist’s advice, combined with finally getting to the end of the Lord of the Rings series.
Steve watches him read it. He can’t tell if any of this is good or bad. Tony blinks and then keeps blinking, the blinks getting faster the more he gets down the page, and Steve hopes like hell that’s a good sign.
“Hm?” Tony looks over the flashing lights coming from the Hammer house. “Sure. Jarvis has been in the family - employed by us, you know what I mean - since before I was born.”
“Oh, fuck, 1954. Shit.” He looks up at Steve, an incredulous smile tugging on his mouth. It keeps threatening to turn into something else. “Steve.”
Steve has been leaning against the wall for a while now. He pushes himself off and goes to sit on the big couch, next to Tony.
“It’s okay,” Tony says. He stares out at the yard: the vegetable garden, the mower in the middle of the yawn, the rest of it yet to be mowed. “I, uh. Now that I think back on it, I did get - hints. The first
The chick chirps and bobs closer. It darts forwards, grabs the shoot and runs off back to its siblings.
“I bet.” Cap won’t stop looking at him. He only seems to notice this when Tony raises his eyebrows, at which point Steve hastily drops his gaze and starts drinking his coffee.
“Look,” Steve says. “Either punch me or say whatever you’re going to say. Let’s just get this over with.”
He works on the suit. This doesn’t take up most of his time, but it’s at the back of his head the rest of the time - when he’s drawing up other plans, he’ll be distantly thinking of the left gauntlet, the fine-tuning of the torso plates, how it’ll all fit together. It feels purer than anything else, pure in a way that burns through him, incinerating anything that isn’t his
There are indeed seven bedrooms, though only two look very lived in. One of them is Tony’s parents bedroom, which Steve assumes has his mother in it, and the other is Tony’s bedroom - or, his
“I’ve lived here forever,” he says. “It sounds normal to me, but - yeah, I can get why it sounds like a bit much to someone who hasn’t heard of it before. When did you hear about Stardew?”
“They are! But they’re not-” Tony pauses. Kicks at a loose rock as they walk. “Our… people. Not in a bad way, just - they’re not what we’re used to. Right?”
Steve looks at her, but she doesn’t relent. He pushes his chair out and goes to his room, comes back with his torn shoe. He hands it to her and she turns it around in her hands. She pushes her fingers through the hole and makes a face.
“Like sugar,” Tony says, with a pitched laugh that makes Steve a little worried. “Anyway, me and Steve are busy right now.”
He rinses his cup - because of course he does - and leaves it upside down on the bench before giving Obie a tight smile that goes smoother when he looks at Tony.
Clint also sits him down and give him the ins and outs of how to actually, y’know, grow crops without killing them, since Clint has a farm about ten minutes down the road, mostly growing fruit and flowers.
Natasha nods towards a casserole. It looks about as good as Tony’s, which is to say, very obviously done by someone who doesn’t cook much.
“Uh-huh,” Tony says. He drinks from his coffee cup, which is empty now, but he wants something to do with his hands.
Plates get passed around and Tony takes whatever people give him, which means he ends up with a strange and huge assortment of foods. He hopes they don’t serve dessert after this, or he might have to go outside and puke and then come back in for more, like the ancient Romans.
“Yeah,” Steve says, equally quiet. He keeps watching Tony as he drinks, keeps his eyes lowered, something brewing behind them.
Rhodey pauses. He’s holding Mary. Tony can tell it’s her due to the distinct tuft of feathers on her head.
“Oh, yeah.” Tony grimaces. “Yeah, no movement on that front. I thought he’d… but no, he’s. Pretty determined.”
. Thank God.” Tony links their fingers together and does his best not to feel like a grade schooler with a crush. “Okay, good. Just wanted to make sure.”
Tony gives his shoulder a punch, this time. Steve rocks with the impact good-naturedly. No one can move him with a punch anymore, even when they’re putting effort into it, but as his therapist said once when she was getting insufferably metaphorical - he should probably let someone move him one of these days.
“You and me both,” Tony says. He waves a hand at Steve’s canvas. “Have a good - painting. A good time painting.”
Tony gets injured on a routine mission, which isn’t unusual. What is unusual is that he requires hospitalization for it, and that he doesn’t put up a fight about this. The reason he doesn’t put up a fight is because he’s unconscious, but still.
“Give me a second to breathe,” Tony says when Steve brings it up, after he’s gone around and gotten the rest of his stuff - which is a small suitcase of clothes and books, pathetic in any means, and he refused to let Tony send a car for it - and Steve, surprisingly, lets it rest for now. Another casualty of the ‘sure, whatever, why not,’ in Tony’s opinion. Despite this, Tony makes a mental note to check if Steve starts skulking around anytime soon. Somehow he wouldn’t put it past him.
They arrive the night of the bi-monthly dinner, and they get welcomed with the enthusiasm that Tony has gotten used to, but Pepper and Rhodey are irritatingly less phased by than Tony expected. They keep rolling with it, and every time Tony looks over expecting them to be politely not widening their eyes at all the mentions of fishing and domesticity, the slow, hard work and farm life, they’re nodding like all of this is perfectly normal.
Tony looks up a Youtube video on fishing, grabs the right stuff - he’ll buy bait when he’s in town - and sets out with only vaguely romantic ideas involving catching and eating his very own fish.
tonight, but as far as Steve knows, this is normal, as well as Tony not seeming that drunk despite having been drinking hard liquor while everyone else has stuck to beer.
The movie starts up. They make it thirty seconds in before Tony says, “I’m gonna send Pepper in to Obie soon.”
Steve eyes him. Tony had given the driver the most awkward smile as he’d handed him the ticket, like he was visiting a foriegn country and wasn’t entirely sure of their customs, but wanted to make sure he was doing it right. Tony also keeps glancing around like he might be missing something, or like he’s taking it all in.
The town can be stifling. It’s small and instantly knowable and Tony is still surprised how much he loves it.
But Tony doesn’t. All he does is tap something into the contract, then hold the phone out for Steve to see.
“I don’t like anyone right now, alright,” Tony says. “If I fake-date someone, we’ll be on the same page and we won’t break up until the problem’s solved. If I was to actually date someone, there’d be too many variables. So, are you in or not?”
There’s no rush after they make it on, but Steve moves fast for a seat anyway, since the drivers are never the type to wait until everyone’s seated to take off. He has to grab Tony’s sleeve to steady them both when the bus pulls back into the street just as they’re sitting down.
Tony opens his mouth. Then he closes it. “Uh. You seem like the kind of guy who might not screw me over,” he says slowly. “From the little I know about you from attending the same school for years. And, y’know. You were the first person I saw when I walked into class.”
“Thanks,” Steve tells him, and is about to break into it when a nurse comes out and tells them they can see Tony now.
“Thanks,” Tony says. He starts getting up and his stomach rumbles loud enough that he winces. “Jesus.”
Steve thinks, but the thought it distant. Parts of his brain are switching off all at once, nerves narrowing down to Tony’s mouth on his, moving gently, then tilting a little more, mouth opening, coaxing against Steve’s. Oh.
Steve blows out a breath and leans back in his chair. He can turn the homework assignment in half-done, or finish it during class.
Tony’s eyes fly open. He sits up. Steve is still, yes, sitting ramrod straight on the couch, like he doesn’t know how to be anything else. Maybe he doesn’t. How can he not? Even with seventy years of history behind them, Steve had only been Cap for two years before he went into the ice. Before that -
There are still sounds, but Steve doesn’t notice them. His tunnel vision is all entwined in his body: Tony’s face in his hands. The rasp of his stubble against his fingers, his lips. Tony’s hands on his shoulders now, pulling him closer. Their bodies press together in a line, continue to press, and it’s only when Tony says
“I don’t know. Kick him out of the company, at best. Have him arrested for attempted murder at worst.”
he means Pepper is going to reach that same pitch she’d hit when Tony had said he was headed towards cardiac arrest.
“Don’t I always?” Tony adjusts his grip on Steve’s hand and Steve lets him angle their joined hands so they’re more prominent. “Hey Ty, have you met Steve?”
Steve laughs. It’s one of those laughs that surprises them both, and Tony grins at hearing it - he wants to coax those out more and more, until they’re no longer a surprise. He wants to get them to a place where Steve laughs easily and doesn’t wander around the house at 3am after waking up from nightmares and go off into thousand-yard stares at random times. Tony had assumed, coming back home, that he’d be this new, fucked-up version of himself for the rest of his life, and he knows Steve thought so, too. Neither of them could see a version of themselves who weren’t constantly on edge and holding on by their fingertips, and they’re both still very much riding on the edge of Absolutely Not Okay, but Tony thinks that maybe they can get further away from it. They can build themselves into two people who are okay, maybe.
It’s the leftover adrenaline. That’s what he tells himself. If he hadn’t just been punched in the face a bunch of times, he would have never said it so easily. Still, adrenaline doesn’t keep the panic from setting in as he waits to see how Tony will take it.
Steve hovers over a blueprint on Tony’s desk. He has no idea what the hell it’s for - some kind of motor? - but it looks complex, and Tony’s drawn little notes all over it. Possible improvements, it looks like.
Tony cocks his head. “General G-rated couple stuff? Holding hands. Whispering sweet nothings. Whatever makes it look convincing, but nothing that’ll invade your personal bubble too much.”
“Oh, it’s easy.” Sam spears off a hunk of dubiously coloured meat. “It’s this or I make my own lunches, which means I gotta get up before 5. If you’re really sad for me, though, can I snag a piece of sushi?”
Fury waves his free hand. “I get you. He tried to pull the victim card, shockingly, but I’ve heard enough about Ty’s antics to know that he absolutely deserved it.”
Eventually Tony finds the path, also hidden by bushes and grass, and heads up to the house. It’s not much better than the surroundings, but at least there are no holes in the walls or roof. Tony guesses that’s as good as he should expect.
Tony folds his arms like that’ll stop Steve from trying to give him the shoes back. “That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Tony has had too many near-death experiences for one night. He disengages the gauntlet Obie’s holding, wrenches his hand out of it just in time for Obie to fall into the reactor, screaming all the way down.
“Yeah,” Tony says quietly. He clears his throat. “Uh. How are you feeling about - the ending? The series as a whole?”
Tony stares at it long enough that Steve starts to worry, then he doubles over in laughter. It shakes him until Steve is fighting it back, too, and when Tony straightens back up there are tears in his eyes.
“One day, Tony,” Steve says absently, and makes a mental note to clear enough of his schedule to get through the first fifty pages.
Steve touches his empty plate for the smoothness of it, picturing it: Frodo next door to Sam, having afternoon tea and trading gardening tips, laughing at Pippin and Merry causing trouble - the more tame kind nowadays, since they’ve had more trouble for a lifetime. Steve imagines that Frodo might go on the very occasional adventure, because Steve doesn’t think that Frodo will be able to leave all of that behind, not really. But he could make a life, maybe, just like Bilbo did.
and finishes with the eggs, sets them to the side so he can take them into town after he finishes with Steve. He assumes they’ll be drinking coffee or having lunch, like they sometimes do these days.
“I did say I’d get better at it,” he says. “And you’re not so bad yourself. Earlier, when you were zoning out because you were staring at me? That looked really real.”
The day after he finishes it he goes for a run with Steve, because Sam asked and Steve feels strange and wants to get out of his head. Sometimes when he’s feeling like this, a run works, or time with a friend. Neither of those work today, and Steve returns home to the Tower with a heavy stomach and an inescapable distance between him and the rest of the world.
“Thanks,” he says to the driver, who gives him a prim smile with more warmth in it than Steve expects.
Steve tells the others to go ahead when they make it out to the hall, then he falls into step with Tony.
Nat and Bucky are all too happy to. Steve eats his sandwich and doesn’t look over at Tony, or really anywhere else - he’s been getting looked at more today than he’s been looked at in the whole of high school, which means the news is spreading fast.
The elevator doors slide open again and Steve cranes his head back to see Tony and Bucky come into the lounge. Bucky, like he often is when Tony is around, is watching bemusedly as Tony talks about his metal arm.
Ty keeps looking at him like he’s the one being ridiculous. His shoulders shift as he glances around at the gathering crowd, then twitch, like a cornered animal. But then he’s stepping forwards and Steve braces.
His chest throbs in time with his heartbeat. He’s been assured by the doctor back at the base that will probably stop at some point, unless it’s psychological, then - well. Tony hopes it doesn’t become psychological.
Steve thinks about it. The buses are complicated, so he’d rather just go home straight after school than hang around and risk getting home much later than he wants.
-ing Rhodey awake, who would moan about it and then resigning himself to getting sucked in after maybe a minute of Tony talking about whatever he’d come up with. Knowing their relationship, Steve suspected that Rhodey would’ve ended up just as excited and awake as Tony was.
“I like Pablo Neruda,” Natasha says. She gets to a blue M&M and adds it to a pile of blue in her lap, then eats a green one from the bag. “Even if he was an asshole.”
“Uh,” he says. “Yeah, but - still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.” He regrets it immediately - surely that wasn’t helpful, the context was off, for one -
Tony nods, eyes a little wide, and it’s at this point that Steve realizes Tony’s probably never taught anyone anything before this.
- or, Steve is, and Tony’s on his phone glancing up sometimes - when Tony looks up, notices the painting, and says under his breath, “
As the end credits roll, Steve doesn’t look away from the screen. There’s a lot to absorb, even after the slowness of the ending that let him think about the rest of it.
him. There are some other characters who do go home, and they just - live their life. After everything happened, they just went back and… lived. And I think I can do that now. I don’t think I need to go anywhere, Ma.”
It’s infuriating. Tony catches onto the weirdness after about five minutes, glancing over at Steve like,
“What am I going through?” Tony skulls his coffee. He could ask for something stronger, but he doubts there will be anything. “That’s all over with. Nothing’s going on with me now. I’m back.”
“I’ll be outside,” Pepper says. She puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder and Tony nods at her, gives her a quick smile.
,” Tony says. He’s almost vibrating on the spot, squirming with the effort of holding it in. “But the books are better.”
“There’s no rush,” Steve says. They lapse back into silence, and Steve nods towards the chickens. “We all thought you’d put these guys off for a while longer. You seemed pretty, uh-”
“Sorry,” Steve says, after his panicked silence has gone on for an embarrassingly long time and Tony is starting to shift on the spot. “I, that was inappropriate. Never mind. Sorry. I’ll see you in a few days.”
He’s a little surprised when Tony doesn’t make an appearance, but he supposes that a guy as busy as Tony doesn’t have time for things like this. He thinks this right up until the birthday dinner and Tony bursts in half an hour late, in a three-piece suit that’s been recently wrinkled, holding a present.
And Auden. There’s a lot of Auden, and Steve and Tony get into a lot of discussions on Early Auden versus Late Auden and which poems from each era are better, and what counts as ‘better,’ and how much of it is personal preference.
“It’s fine,” Mr. Stark repeats, in a loud, mocking voice. “Like it was fine with Sunset? Remind me again, which important fucking documents did she steal away with? Which documents that might have endangered the existence of the Stark company? Was that
The rest of the night is pretty uneventful. Steve doesn’t run into Ty again, no one pukes on him, they find a bandage (which is, admittedly, better than band aids would’ve been) in a bathroom and then they call Jarvis to come pick them up.
he looks. It’s only for a second, then Cap is pulling a blank face on, but for that second Cap looks like he’s lived through all that time he spent in the ice. Oh god, was he
Tony holds still as Pepper finishes dabbing concealer on his cheek and blends it in. “What’s this whole story that it’s a body guard? He’s my body-? That’s kind of flimsy.”
Jarvis makes a noise in the back of his throat that sounds a lot like a rebuttal, then says, “Call me when you want to go home.”
“You showed up for dinner. It’s more than I ex - I mean, I know how busy you are. I appreciate that you showed up. It means a lot.”
“It’s unfortunate you had to involve Pepper,” Obie says. “I would’ve preferred it if she lived. Captain Rogers, too.”
She approaches again, more cautious this time. “You never know. Could go well. I think he really likes you, too.”
Steve doesn’t say anything. He pushes off the wall and comes closer until he’s standing in front of Tony. He looks him over and Tony feels his gaze like a weight, but not an unwelcome one - more of a comforting pressure than something dragging him down.
Rhodey is silent for a while. He keeps taking a breath like he’s going to say something, then letting it out.
Tony plants and harvests his winter crops. He fishes when he can be bothered and buys fish from Natasha when he can’t. He does repair after repair - fridges, laptops, someone else’s lawnmower. He even fixes a roof, since being the Town Handyman apparently covers a broad scope of duties.
Tony beams at him. Steve smiles back. It thrills him way too much that Tony likes his answer, but he’s long since accepted that Tony is going to stir up some unexpected things in him. He’d realized this even before they’d become friends. Back when they were still on uneven footing and were tripping over each other, accidentally offending each other on every second sentence on complete accident, just stumbling into each other’s hurt spots - Steve had recognized that there was something in Tony that would always hit him harder than most others could.
“I would,” Natasha says, “But if I’m going to watch 12 hours of movies I want to watch movies where the men to women ratio is more than 50 to 1.”
“I’m not doing anything,” Bucky says. Then, “That was nice of him. Giving you a book. That was the book he was getting all quivery over last month, right?”
Tony sighs. Rolls his tongue around his mouth. “Steve, the world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places.”
“You gotta grin as hard as you can at him for the rest of high school,” Bucky tells her. “Like, a hair away from baring your teeth.”
At this point, the person Steve is closest to - other than Bucky, once he gets more or less deprogrammed - is probably Sam and Natasha. Everyone else gets polite smiles and occasional jokes if he’s relaxed enough. He knows it’ll get easier, but for now he’s waiting to stop feeling his nerves prick up every time a teammate walks in.
He chins himself on the edge of his glass, which he’s propping up in his hand. He looks at Steve. Steve looks right back at him.
He extracts himself from the couch - Bucky tries pushing his back to help him, which is more hindering than helpful, but Steve nods at him in thanks anyway - and goes off in search of a bathroom. It’s now late enough in the night that he has to push past people instead of asking them to please move, because people aren’t listening and also when he nudges them, most of them move, unconcerned, out of the way without checking who or what Steve is.
“Looking forward to it, Potts.” He turns to look out the window, but the silence is deafening, so he continues, “Want to stop and get some honey for your throat? Really loosen up those muscles. After this long of no me to yell at, those yelling muscles gotta be flagging. Happy, where’s the nearest honey place-”
seems too dramatic but he thinks Rhodey gets it anyway, even though Tony just says some stupid nothing-phrases about getting Steve out of that shitty apartment and out from under the government’s thumb.
He extracts himself from Steve and sits up straight. It looks like hard work, and then suddenly easier. “I should. Drink water.”
“And overhauling your company,” Cap says. He pauses. “Going back to the old life, then? Should we expect photos to come out of you with four dames on your arms? Shirtless and climbing national monuments?”
Tony doesn’t know if he should be insulted by that, but he can’t think of a snappy comeback, so he lets it go.
Tony gets that bouncy, no-I’m-not-bouncing-what-are-you-talking-about stance again. He folds his arms like that’ll keep it in. “You’re reading it?”
There’s a perfectly good fishing rod in the shed. Tony doesn’t know how to fish, but Rhodey, after giving his blessing on “this stupid farm idea” had done some research and told Tony that this place is great for fishing.
Steve bites his tongue. He glances over at Tony, who is watching with his fork halfway to his mouth. He puts the fork down, raises his eyebrows at Steve.
“Look,” he says, dangerously low. He’s not entirely sure what he’s going to say, and he’s almost grateful when the door open and his Ma appears in the doorway.
Steve is at the bottom of the steps leading down to the workshop. Tony can see him through the glass - he’s not at the door but he’s looking like he had been heading towards it not long ago. He’s wavering, looking at Tony like he wants to make sure he’s okay to leave.
It’s the first time Tony’s heard him yell when he’s not being flown around by the armor. Tony ignores him.
He winces at it from the car. Suddenly he regrets coming, but Tony drove him here, he can’t just get back into the car and leave.
“What is with you and sueing people,” Steve asks. “I’m not gonna sue Hammer for - for me sticking my foot somewhere it shouldn’t have been. That wouldn’t work in court anyway. Let’s go find a plaster.”
Tony’s head swims with nervous energy. He wants to - do something for this guy, because he just seems so lost in his bare apartment, his shoulders squared, his expression measured and very obviously faux-calm, the calm that’s hiding something.
Steve snaps his fingers. “Yes! Like - how are Frodo and the rest of the Hobbits going to go back to the Shire and, and - grow their vegetable gardens?”
“He was nice,” he says. He pulls a face. “I mean - I knew he wasn’t NICE, but - he could make me believe he was nice when he was with me.”
Tony leans against the wall, folds his arms. Steve watches his fingers tick against the inside of his elbow - a nervous tic. One of many, Steve had been surprised to realize. Tony Stark is, apparently, a pretty nervous guy despite all the flash and glamour.
At first he’s worried about bringing up a breakup literal minutes after they’ve gotten together, but Steve just laughs.
It’s annoying. In their messages they’re openly incredulous about Tony keeping chickens and tending crops, but now they’re here they’re just - happy for him. A bit bewildered by some things, sure, but happy to sit and listen about Thor’s endless chickens and stories of Stardew life.
Tony grins and dips into a loop. They spiral downwards, then even out, and all the while, Steve laughs like a maniac. It’s enough to drag Tony along with him, both of them laughing like idiots as they fly through the night sky.
“Where to,” Happy says from the front seat. He’s been especially chatty today, like he’s trying to lighten the mood.
“No, I know,” Steve says. “Just - not a lot to do today. And it’s more interesting than getting coffee.”
Steve doesn’t react to the shoulder clap, or the prolonged squeeze that happens before Obie drops his hand. He smiles and it’s perfectly polite, but there might be something underneath it. Or Tony’s projecting. One of the two.
With that, he steps past Ty. Ty tries to get in his way again, but Steve shoulders him hard enough to send him back a step, helped along by the alcohol Steve catches on Ty’s breath as he pushes past him.
“You did all this?” Steve gestures at the room - all the things he’s making, the blueprints and constellations.
“Thanks,” Tony pants, and collapses into the chair that Sam pulls out next to him, the only empty one left. “Sorry for the lateness, I had to-”
In front of him, Tony seems just as mortified, though he’s doing a better job at hiding it than Steve is. His hands are in his pockets, but Steve knows they’ll be tapping away a storm.
They like the farm, which is - gratifying. Tony tries not to feel too proud of himself as they compliment the new additions - silo, greenhouse, half-constructed second greenhouse, the fixed-up chicken pen and the crops that are flourishing for real now - and then fawn over the chickens.
“So you guys are - you’re, like. Actual roommates. Instead of - two people who avoid each other in a huge house.”
Tony scrunches up his nose. “Dad’s always angry,” he says, and closes his eyes, letting his head drop onto Steve’s shoulder.
“Yep,” Sarah says. She hangs her handbag up and shucks off her landyard. “Guess who she said you were dating?”
Steve scrubs their plates, then the utensils, and hands them off to Tony, who dries and stacks them on the counter.
Steve mouths. “Yeah, well. You should be sorry. Give me that back, it’s Tony’s, we have to be careful with it.”
Tony’s mouth twitches. “Actually, Ty will need at least three sex tapes - no, you won’t have to ‘do anything.’ We’d hold hands,
“Were you conscious in the ice,” Tony blurts, and then backtracks when Cap’s blank expression flinches into something more urgent.
Ty nods downwards. “You got a nice dick there, Steve. Surprisingly big for someone of your frame. Or most guys’ frames.
Bucky’s face twitches a little, like he isn’t sure if he wants to let this go or keep ragging Steve about it. Steve waits, trying to come up with something else to distract him, but apparently Bucky is feeling merciful today.
He has to clear his throat. It’s embarrassing, but he doesn’t let himself think about her that much, so he supposes it’s fine if he gets worked up about it when he does.
“Thanks,” Steve says as he comes in, after he’s also shaken snow off his jacket. “God, it’s freezing out there. How are you holding up?”
After Tony and Steve grappling next - Steve had been appalled about Tony having no training right up until Tony had said
Bucky picks up the book again, turning it over in his hands. “Can’t believe all of this came out of that tiny book about Bilbo.”
“Forever, in my case.” Tony’s hands itch for a scotch, any kind of booze really. Why doesn’t he have a bar in this room? “Uncle Obie,” he continues, and hesitates.
“It wasn’t any trouble,” Tony says, and then when Steve makes a noise, he says, very quietly: “You’re welcome.”
“He’d blackmail us!” Tony drops the watch and starts chewing on a hangnail. “I’m shocked he hasn’t tried before. This is a preemptive strike. I’ve started coming up with potential blackmail plans before we broke up.”
“Just wanted to confirm that we’re still on,” Tony says. “And get your number so we can talk details.”
“And I know we’re fake-breaking up, but-” he stops. Thinks back to Ty touching Tony’s face, the way Tony had frozen up for a few seconds. Ty is 100% the kind of guy to pressure people into things they don’t want to do, and he probably did that to some extent to Tony, and now Steve is standing here realizing he might be doing the same fucking thing - Tony’d been grabbed less than an hour ago, he won’t be in the right headspace to want to kiss Steve even if he
“After my mom died, I guess. In her will. She mentioned it a few times, but never the name of the farm.”
Tony orders a reinforced punching bag to be sent to Steve’s apartment. He doesn’t think much of it, and then gets back to the repulsors.
“You got it,” Sam says, and gets up a little more vigorously than necessary, leaving Bucky to plummet into the couch and then spring up in dazed confusion that Steve probably shouldn’t laugh at as hard as he does.
“Ohhhh.” Sam clasps a hand over his chest and puts on his quoting voice. “My brother. My captain. My king!”
Tony waves him down. “No, okay, let’s just - how about you try a problem, and tell me how you got it, and we’ll go from there.”
“Look,” Obie says, voice low. “I know things haven’t been good between us lately. But you have to know that I only did it because I care about-”
Pepper strokes a finger down Ferdinand’s neck. She looks out of place in her pencil skirt and white shirt, but she doesn’t seem to care. “You should get silkies next. They’re the fluffy ones-”
“Jesus,” Tony mutters. His chest throbs again, this time hard enough that his hand flickers up to touch the reactor, glancing off of it when he remembers that Rhodey’s right here. Rhodey’s obviously not comfortable with it, though he’s considerably more comfortable than he was when he thought it was a bomb strapped to Tony’s chest.
Bucky shoots him a look as he comes out - apron donned but otherwise looking like he’s just walked in off the street without brushing his hair or showering or putting on clean clothes - to clear plates from the next table.
Tony nods. Smiles some more. Wonders what the hell you say to a guy who’s been woken up to find that seventy years has gone by without him.
Saturday rolls around and Steve is waiting outside the apartment when a very shiny car pulls up to the curb.
. Tony has lived alone since his parents died, and even before that a lot of it was like living alone, if it wasn’t for Jarvis.
Monday is tense, to say the least. Tony and Steve still sit next to each other at lunch, still hold hands, but they don’t talk except for polite small talk. Even when Tony notices that Steve’s wearing the new shoes, there’s a second where Tony seems like he’s about to say something, but then he lets it go on a breath.
Tony leans sideways, bumps their arms together. “I don’t know,” he says. “Actually, I was hoping you’d help me figure that out. Also, unrelated note: you know that homosexuality is legal now, right? You’ve run across it on your Googling, I know you Google, JARVIS told me-”
He clears his throat again, harder this time. He feels silly standing here talking to a grave, but he likes to believe his Ma is listening. He’s almost sure he believes it entirely. One thing he knows for sure: if there’s any way she can be listening, she’s doing it.
Cap’s eyes narrow, then widen. His expression sharpens with shock, then softens into something that makes Tony want to hide, then tidies up into something more normal.
Tony meets his eyes and Steve thinks for a second that his heart has reverted to his old one, the one that had murmurs and tended to skip beats.
“Ha. Not tonight.” Tony rubs a hand over his forehead. “How are you going on movies? Caught up yet?”
As Tony approaches the apartment door, he becomes increasingly sure that he’s being an idiot and he should just go home and focus on his work - make the arc reactor with actual tools instead of what he could cobble together in the cave; start in on re-building his company from the ground up - but he assures himself that most of it is from the absurdity of the situation.
“Okay,” Tony says. It comes out strangely loud - there’s noise going on outside, but the cool bubble of the laundry feels like a new place. All the noises outside are muffled, they could be somewhere else altogether.
“Don’t change the subject,” Rhodey says. “Yes, I am, but we’re talking about you, here, and how you somehow got Cap to move in. What did you even say? Why did he agree to it?”
“Sorry,” he says. He’s having one of his moments where he’s made out of sharp edges and is sure none of them will ever smooth and he’s going to go through life cutting everyone on them. “Shit, just ignore me. I don’t mean to be - you’re obviously, uh. Going through a lot. I don’t mean to be a dick.”
“Oh,” Tony says. “It’s a small story really, about, among other things: a girl. Some words. An accordionist. Some fanatical Germans. A Jewish fist fighter-”
“Order up,” Thor says, but Bruce and Natasha are already up with their plate waiting. Each of them takes a single waffle, gives Thor some kind of shoulder pat, and then heads back to the table.
It doesn’t get better from there. Every time Tony tries to speak up his Dad shouts him down, and when the mother tries to interject, she gets shouted down, too. Eventually Tony mentions that he has someone over and Mr. Stark’s voice starts getting closer and Tony’s increasingly worried voice follows.
“No, this was just a bit of fun, you know, the whole fake-dating thing,” Tony says. “Yeah, he’s really been bothering me.”
Sarah smiles and it cracks into a yawn. “It’ll be fine, alright,” she says on the tail end of it. “Go to school. Maybe tell Tony how you feel, legitimize this whole dating thing.”
“I can deal with that,” he says. “Responsible dads should pay chicken support anyway. Sorry I haven’t been paying it up til now.”
“Yeah, I know Ty.” The slimy asshole who bullies indiscriminately, not through punches, or anything teachers can punish him for - no, Ty is the kind of bully you don’t want to run into. He’s devious about it, saying something so innocent that he can pass it off as an accident as he chips down a student’s self worth with each comment. The fact that Tony had dated him says a lot about his character, since Steve doubts Tony was fooled by Ty’s Nice Guy act - Tony’s smart. He would’ve picked something up.
Tony stares. Steve keeps looking at his hands - they’re the same size as they were before, that skinny frame had big hands and feet and was rumoured to have
, his blazing attempt to fix what hes’s done, his weapons turned on the people he was meaning to protect, his weapons getting turned on the bad guys and catching innocents in the crossfire.
“Not yet,” Tony says. When Steve looks over at him, doing a bad job of covering up his worry: “I’m not going anywhere. I put a lot of work into my place. Besides, if I go back to New York, where are my chickens going to go?”
“I don’t get how you can eat that stuff,” Rhodey says, pointing a fork (also brought from home, like his lunch) at Sam’s food.
Tony blinks at him. Steve’s just as surprised as he is that they aren’t still arguing, but Steve had figured that with everything he knew about himself and the small things he knew about Tony, they could keep arguing until they screamed themselves raw, so a break might help that not to happen. Or at least delay it.
“This is a good place,” she says, with a soft face that gives Tony the impression that Natasha has been to some very bad places in her life and views Stardew as a haven, a soft place she’s very happy to be after a lifetime of hard, jagged places.
“God,” Rhodey says. “Don’t you dare become chicken buddies. I don’t want all our emails to be about how you and Tony’s chickens are doing.”
“You won’t,” Steve says easily. “Those kind of mushrooms are a while off. Gotta make a trek if you want those. Anyway, it was good talking to you. I hope you get settled in soon.”
“Right,” Steve says. He gets out his phone, gives it to Tony, and takes Tony’s phone to type his own number in. When the phones are handed back, Steve has Tony’s number under the contact name ‘BF <3.’
Christine Everheart confronts him at a party and the persona Tony puts on for these events evaporates. Gulmira - that was Yinsen’s hometown. And it was getting destroyed by Tony’s own weapons.
Bucky starts to say something else, but then he gets hit in the face with a frisbee. This somehow leads to Bucky and Natasha surging up and joining an impromptu frisbee match, with stakes and a goal of hitting the basketball net outside the house. Steve and Tony are invited - or, they’re not being deliberately excluded - but both of them stay on the couch, watching in bewilderment as the new frisbee gang charges outside.
Obie hugs Tony. Tony lets him, and then Obie leaves. Tony waits until he gets out of the hall, then gestures at Steve to walk with him.
“Well,” she says. She spears a piece of chicken. “That’s a shame. You two were good together, even if it was fake.”
They won’t let him out of the hospital after Tony wakes up, even with all the money he offers the doctors.
Tony returns his smile with a little less gusto than Steve would like. His fingers drum against his fork, when he picks it up, and when Sam tries to take the present from him to give to Steve, Tony pulls back on it.
“Hi,” Steve says when Tony opens the door. “I hoped we could talk. If you’re not up to it right now, that’s fine.”
He still leaves it until the last minute, waiting until the celebration is over and Tony is in his workshop doing some last-minute things that “no, can’t be delayed even because of a birthday, stop giving me the pinata stick, Clint.”
out, so I’m just gonna go and I’m leaving the shoes and I’m not taking them back, so either you throw them out, which is a waste, or you give them away, which is
As he’s climbing into bed, his phone vibrates, but Tony’s already gone. In the morning - or, 14 hours later, which is actually the evening - the text is still there.
and clear, righteous anger and sheer embarrassment, a lifetime of never having enough, of wearing the same shoes until they get thin enough that it’s barely worth wearing them anymore, and then wearing them another six months after that. Wearing things until they literally fall apart, then fixing them up, then wearing them until they were only good for scraps. Keeping the scraps, every time.
, yeah. Couldn’t keep me away from them. Lord of the Rings and Arthurian legends, I was a real…” Tony trails off. Scratches at his beard with his fingertips like he wants to be covering his mouth instead, which pulls into a hasty smile.
He seems kind of lost, so Steve clears his throat and says, “Uh, let me know if Ty bothers you again.”
Ty smiles. It’s just as slimy as every fucking smile Steve’s seen out of the guy before now, and he’s so,
Tony nods. Hesitates. Puts a hand on Steve’s arm, but only for a second. He looks - upset. He’s hiding it, but Steve knows him now.
“Nothing bad like what,” Natasha says. Her face is the picture of innocence, but Steve knows her well enough by now to take that as a dangerous omen.
Tony blinks. He has a bit of that same expression his Mom has, the looking-from-a-distance thing. “What?”
Steve stares determinedly at his plate, picks up one pea at a time and eats them so he doesn’t have to look up. Ma’s eyeing him. He can tell.
“Jesus,” Rhodey says, sitting back in the dirt and narrowly missing the spot he’d rubbed chicken shit into.
Steve goes over this more than he’d like to admit. He goes over a lot of things more than he’d like to admit - he pores over poetry and seeks out lines in books and folds the page over. He doesn’t dare highlight them, but he can zero in on the lines as soon as he opens the page.
“Just keep driving, Happy,” Pepper says. Then, to Tony: “Thank you for your concern, but my throat is fine.”
Steve thinks about suggesting Tony might want to visit the counsellor, but it probably wouldn’t get a good response, so he keeps quiet.
have hours worth of talk behind them, but she just says things like “Huh.” and “Well.” and asking Tony about how classes.
Steve shrugs. “She gets married! Who does she marry! She never tells her husband about Jack, does that mean she isn’t fully happy with him, that she doesn’t trust him? She has kids, what was that like?”
“How many bedrooms does this place have,” Steve says as he looks around. One hall alone has at least five rooms attached to it, and there are more halls than that.
, but then he remembers his homework, which has eight problems to go and Steve only knows how to do three of them.
Steve thinks about it. Then he thinks about that thing his therapist had said about self-isolating. Damn her for making so many good points.
it is. Steve feels out of place just stepping on the carpet, which he all but sinks into. This carpet belongs in a five star hotel suite, not an apartment where people
. He leaves that in a bunker with the rest of his belongings, his old clothes he’s not sure what he’s going to do with when he gets back. He doesn’t know quite what he’ll do with anything when he gets back - his sketchbooks and old textbooks from art school, the knickknacks from his apartment. Sometimes, when he’s not distracting himself well enough, he’ll let himself imagine an apartment where he’ll move his old things. He’ll sometimes try to imagine getting a place full of new things, but he likes to picture all the old stuff there. It’s easier, anyway. He’ll use his old, too-small clothes to stuff cushions or he’ll turn them into rags for cleaning; he’ll stack his books in a shelf he builds himself. His sketchbook will live beside his bed and his copy of
Pepper takes the book out of Tony’s hands, ignoring Tony’s noise of protest, and hands Bucky the book.
Afterwards, they’re sitting around the Tower and going off of everyone’s faces and postures, he guesses they’re thinking the same thing he is - if they can’t take down one untrained guy with flame powers, if they can’t stop him from killing himself and others, what the fuck are they here for?
It’s a big house, and after opening six doors and not finding a bathroom, Steve steps outside and pees in a bush. It’s fine, he reasons. It’s a party. No one’s gonna call his Ma and tell her that her only son was found peeing in public, on someone’s
Steve tries to make himself look as proper as possible - it’s a lost battle, he’s still drenched and in crappy clothes, minus the shoes - and then Mr. Stark storms down the hall, going right past Tony’s room and then halting, coming back, staring at Steve.
AF guy shakes his head. “Nope. These are safe. There’s a lot of stuff around here if you know where to look.”
Sarah takes a breath like she’s about to say something, then holds it for a few seconds before she says, “Well. It’s a very generous offer.”
It does mean that Steve has to explain what’s going on, which is less fine. He stumbles over all of it, the kissing at Hammer’s party, going over to Tony’s house, Tony coming onto him after asking to stay the night at Steve’s -
Steve rolls a tomato in his hand. He glances back at the vegetable patch. “If you have time, do you want to stay for lunch? If you can’t-”
Tony nods. Looks around the table, where the argument is dying down. One other thing he doesn’t miss about the city - there was never much of a sense of community, there. Everyone was out for themselves, and fair enough, with how the city behaved. Here, though - here, people talk to you when you go to the store. Everyone knows Tony’s name, and for once it isn’t because of what his last name is - people here know his name because he fixed their TV or got them a decent internet connection or because they helped him find the best spots to find wild herbs. Here, you can find
Steve waits until Tony’s settled back into the Tower and isn't in danger of sending himself back to the hospital, then heads to his room.
And some of it’s less quotes and more abstract - he thinks a lot about Sam. Gamgee, not Wilson. He thinks about Sam going home to the Shire and settling in, settling down, marrying the love of his life and having children and gardening and living peacefully.
