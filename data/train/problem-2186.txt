‘Sherlock.’ John spoke up after a minute or two. His friend was beginning to worry him slightly. ‘What’s going on?’
This continued for a while, the two of them going about their daily lives like they normally would, with the added extra that they were both insanely happy. They didn’t think anything of it, until they were standing around the caution tape which signalled the end of the kidnapping case.
John reached over and took one of Sherlock’s hands, giving it a squeeze. The detective looked up and John seized an opportunity and leaned forward, pressing his lips firmly against his. Sherlock’s breath hitched and he pressed forward, sliding a hand up onto John’s jaw.
John, himself, was only sporting a long-sleeved t-shirt, one that Sherlock had given him for his birthday after he glanced at it in a shop window but decided it was too expensive.
‘Why do you kiss me when you’re stuck on a case?’ He asked, half accusingly, half simple curiosity.
John followed his gaze and softened. ‘Yeah,’ he looked back at Sherlock, ‘two real things.’
During the first week, John made it abundantly clear that Sherlock would be the one to advance their relationship via the subject of physical intimacy. While Sherlock admitted he had previous sexual experience, it was never in the context of a relationship, and John didn’t want to push too hard, no matter how much his I’m-over-40-why-do-is-my-teenage-libido-back mind was calling to him.
‘Okay. Thanks, Sherlock.’ Greg walked to Donovon to order closer examination of the cigarettes found in the area, in case there were more with DNA on them. Sherlock watched them for a moment, before turning to John.
‘You’re spiralling again.’
It wasn’t a feeling of anticipation for the years ahead, it was a feeling of home.
John picked a table outside, determined to enjoy the heat while it lasted, and soon two glasses of John’s favourite wine were placed on the table by an enthusiastic waitress. Sherlock was silent for the cab ride and stared ahead as he picked up one of the glasses to take a distracted sip.
‘Don’t you boys look nice.’ Mrs Hudson said from her spot on the couch. ‘Now, if you want to go out and enjoy a nice meal before you get back, be my guest, there’s a rerun of Corrie on tonight.’
Sherlock’s baritone broke through the cloud of unwelcome thoughts and brought him back to the present. His friend was watching him carefully, a slight lift in his left eyebrow told John how worried he actually was, even though the rest of his face remained passive.
‘Sorry, Sherlock, you’re going to have to spell this one out for me.’ John admitted, taking a tentative sip of his tea. It wasn’t often that Sherlock would make him tea or coffee, and more often than not he had an ulterior motive.
‘It baffles me that people think their idols will praise them for becoming a carbon copy of them. Who would want to be mirrored like that?’ Sherlock huffed and glugged some wine. ‘For example, you admire me-’
He looked at the man, who was busying himself with the wine in his glass instead of looking at John and smiled. He would be able to handle that, he was old enough and ugly enough to deal with a relationship like that. If giving up something like that was the cost of finally giving this thing with Sherlock a name, he would do it. He would take the risk of it going south to see if this was where they were meant to be the whole time.
‘Why?’ Sherlock whispered back.
John felt his face turn bright red. ‘I didn’t do much for this case.’
They lulled back into a comfortable silence as John watched the small breeze ripple the surface of the river. It struck him that nothing felt out of the ordinary. Normally, when you confess your feelings, or want a relationship with someone, you would get a buzz of happy feelings, excited for the days ahead. John didn’t feel that way, however. No, he felt at perfect peace, possibly for the first time since he joined the army.
‘How do you know that the victim didn’t smoke?’
John almost spit out the wine he had sipped. ‘Is that your insane way of asking me to be your boyfriend?’ He asked, a smile playing on his lips.
He heard movement behind him and looked to see Sherlock getting up and joining him at the crib side.
They finished their meal in silence. London’s nightlife surrounded them in a peaceful lull of noise. Sherlock, to John’s surprise, dug into his meal like he was a starving man and finished before John did, gracefully wiping his mouth with his napkin. One look at his, should he say boyfriend? John shook himself. One look at his partner told John everything he needed to know.
‘Hang on. Are you guys together?’
‘Loopholes, John, always think about the loopholes.’
His friend hummed, chewing on his lip before turning back to the Thames. ‘In these cases, the copycat is often the most violent. We have to be careful.’
Apart from the increase in touching and light kisses, nothing else really changed in the first week. Sherlock continued to work on his case and look after Rosie when John was too tired. He would make John a cup of tea every morning, and have it waiting for him when he came downstairs, often already having fed Rosie and had lulled her back to sleep with the use of his violin.
‘I do’ John immediately answered.
‘Because Mary stole another’s identity to become ‘Mary Morstan’, she married you under a fake name.’
‘Are you sure?’
Sherlock stared at John for a few moments as if he should already know the answer. ‘Kissing you restarts my brain.’ He said simply.
‘You know you were never actually married, right?’
Taking his hand back to begin eating again, he was amused to see the look of shock Sherlock gave him. Decidedly ignoring it, John began to eat in earnest as his hunger grew. After a few seconds, Sherlock began to eat again.
‘I’m sure.’ Sherlock said. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever been more sure of anything in my life.’
‘I told you, I’m not expecting you to change. If that means you sometimes forget about me to rush off when your mind is solely on the case, then so be it. You’ve been doing it since the day I met you.’
At first, when her death was still fresh and the wound was still wide open, he found himself wishing for her return, much like he did Sherlock’s. His memories were filled with good times and kept away the reality of their relationship, which was a strained one.
Sherlock didn’t answer, instead, pulling out his phone. ‘You always look tense when Lestrade brings the subject up.’ He observed. ‘Am I to assume a romantic relationship with me would be that terrible?’
‘By UK law, that makes the marriage invalid.’
While Sherlock busied himself with discarding his experiment, now in record time, John texted Greg back and jogged down the stairs to knock on Mrs Hudson’s door.
‘You’re my partner now, I need to be more considerate.’ Sherlock’s head hung low, his hands in his lap.
‘Fantastic. Let’s get our drink on, boys!’
‘Only since the first day you guys met.’
Greg quickly stepped aside as John went to elbow him. ‘Besides,’ he continued, ‘if you both get your arses in gear and admit you’re in a relationship by Sherlock’s birthday, I win £50.’
‘And two, the dynamic between a crazy fan who idolises someone is entirely different from a friendship. I want to spend time with you, not be you.’
John sometimes hated viewing Mary in that way. After all, she was the mother of his daughter, but his mind never listened.
‘Something’s worrying you about the case.’ John said. Sherlock glanced at him before nodding.
Sherlock started off slow, occasionally brushing his hands through John’s hair when he was sitting at the kitchen table, or tentatively giving John’s temple a kiss when he dropped off his tea. John loved every minute detail of it, making an effort to store the little moments away so he would never forget them. While Sherlock’s mind was a palace, John’s was more of a run-down shack. He tried his hardest to file things away as his partner did, but more often than not he would forget them the moment a distraction appeared. It frustrated him, but Sherlock never seemed to mind.
After the first kiss, it seemed Sherlock had made kissing John part of his daily routine. If he got stuck while working on the case, he would march over to where John was sitting and plant a firm kiss on his lips, going immediately back to thinking.
‘You bastard.’
Thanks for your support, guys! Should I continue this? What do you think?
‘This person is clearly unhinged. The practice was messy and unplanned, most likely getting the necessary information from what the Police had released. My best guess is we are looking for someone who idolises the original killer enough to try and earn their recognition and praise.’
It was, for a lack of a better term, bliss. John thought of the three of them as a family, and he was pretty sure Sherlock thought the same. All they needed was each other, the only thing left to address was the nature of their relationship, but John was too scared to lose what they had.
John chuckled. ‘Obviously.’
When they both leaned in for a quick kiss, the moment was broken by Donovon’s voice.
They ended up in Angelo’s. The man had since upgraded and moved restaurants, and now had the option for outdoor seating with a gorgeous view of the Thames.
Sherlock smirked, bending down to duck under the tape as Donovon held it aloft for them. ‘I could say the same about your hair. Your forehead is missing it.’
‘Ooh.’ Sherlock appeared behind his left shoulder, gloved hands stretched out of the way as he read the text. ‘Seems worth a look. Ask him to send me the address.’
John smiled up at him. ‘Yeah, just been to a crime scene, though, so I doubt I can get Sherlock to order anything.’
‘Okay?’
John shrugged. ‘If we are to ‘advance our relationship’ as you like to put it, I’m not expecting much to change, you know. You’re still you. I’m not expecting you to magically turn into Romeo.’ He regarded his surroundings; the lights from the city illuminating the water in front of them, a warm night, the two of them sitting in the glow of the candles on the table. ‘Besides, this is pretty damn romantic, when you look at it.’
John looked at him through the corner of his eye. ‘What do you think?’
‘Wrong.’ Sherlock piped up, a hardness to his voice that the others hadn’t heard in a while. ‘...It was the day after.’
The second week, however, brought some excitement. Sherlock had managed to track down the copycat killer, who had killed again once he realised the Police were covering up his first murder and had run off before John had a chance to follow him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Well, sometimes he tried.
‘The level of smell shows that the person was a very heavy smoker. The victim did not have any signs of yellowing around his fingers, a trademark to someone who would smoke that much, neither any form of tobacco or cigarette lighter in his pocket. Also, more often than not, a heavy smoker’s clothing will have evidence of burn holes where they have dropped their cigarette, but the victim’s clothes are free from them. There’s also the case of this.’ Sherlock lifted an evidence bag in his hand. John peered closer to see a squashed cigarette butt. ‘I doubt you would stuff one in your own mouth when you were being murdered.’
‘I love you too. Always have.’
Sherlock took stock of their position. ‘So it is.’
Sherlock graced him with a warm smile that reached his eyes. ‘Two real things,’ he repeated, nodding in thought. John watched his fingers steeple at his chin and his eyes glaze over, signalling Sherlock had also begun to go through his thoughts.
A twinge of pink appeared on Sherlock’s cheeks and he looked away, picking up his glass and swirling the wine in it. ‘Maybe.’
John watched him talk with a smile. It was always fun to watch that brilliant mind at work, and, now that Sherlock had put effort into educating rather than condescension, the others were beginning to appreciate it more.
During the next couple of weeks, John began to notice something different about Sherlock. He had taken to solely wearing tight, satin-Esque shirts due to the heatwave, and it was only after Lestrade mentioned it one day that John got his answer as to why.
‘Sherlock, you promised you wouldn’t bring body parts into the flat with Rosie here.’ John scolded.
John loved it, apart from the time he had been woken up at 3 am by an enthusiastic Sherlock kissing him, only for the tall bastard to run back downstairs again.
‘So.’ John said, opening the other bottle of wine and breaking the silence. ‘Are we considering this our first date? Crime scene and a lovely dinner?’
‘Okay…’ Sherlock’s mouth opened and closed a few times, reminding John of a goldfish. ‘Are you sure?’
‘Evening, boys. Out for a nice dinner without the baby? What can I get for you two?’
‘You can smoke, Sherlock.’
John shrugged. ‘It didn’t seem like a big deal, to be perfectly honest.’
John laughed. ‘I said ‘okay’.’
‘So, a copycat?’
They hadn’t officially announced anything to their friends yet, because, in all honesty, there wasn’t much to announce. Sherlock had been busy with the kidnapping/killings case enough that his focus wasn’t on his and John’s relationship.
John rolled his eyes, not quite believing he had to explain. ‘Well, for starters, you aren’t a crazy serial kidnapper and murderer.’
John smiled, turning away to try and hide it. He had noticed, throughout his time with Sherlock, his part in his mind palace growing. Sherlock didn’t mention it unless it was brought up and didn’t see anything wrong or worth mentioning, but to John it was a lot. He had started with a room, which had then upgraded to quarters, then an entire wing. Now, knowing that half of Sherlock’s mind was taken up with him and Rosie made a part of his heart flutter. Sherlock was a softie, regardless of how much he denied it.
There was a wave of cheers, mostly calling Sherlock’s name. The man in question froze with his glass halfway in the air, confused.
Ever since John had moved back in, something unsaid had fallen into place between him and Sherlock. John had given updating long ago, since taking care of Rosie and, more often than not, Sherlock was a full-time job in itself. Sherlock kept the three of them afloat with money, something he insisted on doing so John could enjoy the first few years of his daughter's life without a job getting in the way. He showered Rosie with gifts, to the point where John put his foot down and told Sherlock ‘there is such a thing as too many dinosaur toys’, and never made a fuss when John presented him with a full meal.
After a quick glance at each other, John reluctantly nodded. It wasn’t that he didn’t like drinking with Greg. Before Rosie was born, he quite regularly joined him in their local pub. Now, however, he was older and a lot more tired. Even with an almost perfectly behaved baby, she was still tiring to look after. John had seen more wrinkles on his face than ever before.
"Sherlock, the last time I left, or at least tried to leave you wouldn't let me."
"Maddie." She answered in a slightly shaky voice.
John stood just behind and to the left of Sherlock looking down at the bomb, the bomb he wanted off his rig as soon as possible.
"JOHN!!" Sherlock screamed again, this time ending on a sob.
"I know." John stood, stretching his back out and rolling his shoulder.
“You can’t have more Sherlock.”
"No." Sherlock whispered, his lips moving over the pulse in John's neck.
“Everything is.” She responded seriously.
Sherlock sighed angrily, his fists clenching as he tried to rain in his emotions.
okay so tiny chapter because well the next chapter will hopefully be a lot bigger, I just needed a little bridge of a chapter before starting on the next part.
For example, when Sherlock resurfaced after closing his eyes for what felt like seconds, John had changed his clothes as well as shaved and had a shower.
"Mindpalace." Sherlock said with a smile.
They had kept them apart, telling John only that Sherlock was stable and his wounds had been cleaned and bandaged. They refused to tell him anything more, telling him only to sort himself out first.
"How are your dreams?"
The silence that followed that was not at all comfortable. They both knew what had happened to the gun and where it currently was, also it would probably take at least three psych evaluations before Mycroft even let John have it back.
“I was three when my parents died, five when my anger became too much for foster carers to deal with, six when they came and took me to be trained. I killed for the first time at the age of twelve, completed my first mission at sixteen, went dark at eighteen. Since then I have killed, I have saved, I have tortured, I have done everything that has ever been asked of me.” John looks at Mycroft, tears in his eyes. “I’m forty-two years old, I have had enough. Erase me, let me sleep for the rest of my life and I will do everything in my power to keep Sherlock safe.”
John laughed. "Scared is not even blip on the radar of what I'm feeling Sherlock."
“Missed what?” Mike asks with a frown.
"See." Was all Mycroft said as he pulled his phone free and started to write.
.~.~.~.~.
"Mr Holmes, if Sherlock wakes alone-"
"Morphine and adrenaline." The paramedic offered John. "Teams are being assembled to get people out, we are just the first wave. I'll put him on the priority list. We need him out and into surgery soon, possibility in the next hour."
“Yeah, all the information you need to work out how it happened, even who did it.”
“Baker Street? And you work at a coffee shop?”
Molly smiles as she watches the two then turns back to the monitor and frowns as it starts to go haywire with interference.
"You were a surgeon." Mycroft suddenly said as he lowered his phone, the device only being lowered twice before since John had arrived.
“Sherlock, doctor Ansari has come up with a few solutions but we needed you awake before we tried.” Mary said as she wrote on a chart.
Sherlock’s eyes flashed to his, his defences were still down, his eyes overly expressive, and right now he saw guilt and sadness.
"You okay?" Sherlock asked, his hand now placed over John’s heart. Enabling him to pull John closer.
"Will I ever be able to do everything I want with you John?"
"Does Mycroft know?" Cathy asked, leaning forward in her chair.
John knew, he knew about those watching him, Mycroft had told him, had told him everything. So he understood, but understanding didn't stop the pain.
The nights had started to close in early, darkness having fallen totally by five in the afternoon so John found himself either walking home in the dark or risking the over crowed tube train.
"Well remember to take care of you as well." The man let go of him and John took a step back. "Well got to go, see you around John."
"We can't give you anything love, I'm so sorry. I really wish we could but it just won’t help you, your tolerance is just too high."
His first sight of his friend had hit Sherlock hard. John had lost weight, his skin was pale, his hair now more grey than gold, bandages wrapped around each wrist and IV lines attached to his inner elbow on both arms.
“Then change the name-“
"What did you say?"
“Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.” John barked.
“Thanks My, keep searching?”
As he entered the bay John was greeted by the sight of Flatbed descending into the water with Coffey driving and his three Marines clinging to the side.
"I had thought that by doing as John asked was what he needed, I now see he needs you. But you need to understand that when he wakes, if you are like this still he will not react well. His phobia of touch is unlike any I have seen in any other, even in his uncaring state he reaction was violent."
"I see you’re not...coping very well, two cakes in the last...fuck!" Mycroft took hold of Sherlock’s free hand as his younger brother turned back to John, pushing his face into John's arm as his body succumbed to the pain.
“Why?” The man shrugged.
"Dusk...I think." Maddie frowned. "The sky was pink to the left of the windows."
"Maybe they forget? Or maybe they don't have the capacity to do what you do. You built this place before this happened, not everyone can do that. So maybe they dream, after all most people talk of extreme dreams or strange things happening when they are in a coma."
"You're bluffing."
"Yes John." Sherlock nodded then caught John's eyes. "Will you?"
When he had woken everything had been perfect, blissfully perfect. He was happy, he was relaxed, but he started to panic as soon as everything came back to him.
"You could have taken me with you." John whispered, his anger suddenly draining away, with it his strength. He had been trying for too long to stay strong, he had enough.
"Harry?" Cathy questioned.
enjoy :)
Sherlock glared at him. "You have to operate on yourself, remove a bullet and stitch yourself up while high on painkillers."
"Ah well, John has..." He stopped talking as the door downstairs opened and the foot steps were heard on the stairs.
John spins around, it is clear from the look on Sherlock’s face that he has been standing there for some time his eyes on the screen before they flick to John showing them to more silver in colour, then he was gone.
Looking up John glares at Sherlock. “Don’t what?” He asks pulling his arm free, still hating how his body reacts to just the simplest of touches from Sherlock.
"You fucking bastard!" John yelled. "You total utter prick! Why did you let go?" John said as he pushed at Sherlock’s chest causing the taller man to step back.
“Just take me there if you don’t want any part in this Greg, but yes, I am sure.” Once finished dressing John moved back to Sherlock. “I need to find this cure.”
Closing his eyes he tried to order his thoughts, his feelings. What was important, what needed the most attention.
"Fuck." He hissed then just kicked out pushing the table he had ate at that morning across the room. "Fuck!"
“First date.”
"I'm nothing special, not like him."
"No, I have what I always have. It's why I just let you order."
“Move.” John ordered causing staff to still at the command in his voice, then move back as he headed to Sherlock’s bed. Reaching him, he grabbed Sherlock’s hand bringing the knuckles up to his lips and just holding on tight. “I’m here, Sherlock, I’m here.”
"Still here." John said confused.
"So now what?" John asked pulling the gloves from his hands and throwing them into a bin.
Silence answered the a sigh.
Sherlock felt himself blushing as the nurse smiled and John looked back at him with a glint in his eye.
"It's okay, it was another flashback."
Sherlock nodded then fell back ontohis pillow with a sigh.
"Yes, you have heard of them?" Mycroft raised an eyebrow, something John came to realise was Mycroft's way of expressing his surprise.
Reaching a door he pushed it open and stumbled at the sight before him.
"Fuck!" John hissed feeling Sherlock's own hardness rubbing against him.
They walked slowly. John carried the bag on his shoulder and kept his arm around Sherlock’s waist while they walked. Sherlock leaned against him to keep himself upright as well as to soak in his warmth. He’d just been on the pavement, in December, at night. At least it wasn’t snowing. He shook his head. Even his thoughts were cold enough to stutter.
John laughed as he stood. "Yeah, but it's how it has to be. Tea?"
Dont hate me ;) :p
Minutes later found them walking outside in the crisp night air.
Crouching, Sherlock picked up the belt, his eyes never leaving Moran as he straightened and continued to walk forward.
"John" Sherlock's voice was so lost when he spoke "John please, please don't go."
"Your mission ended." John started as he opened his eyes. "You came home, in fact you were ordered home."
Pushing himself up he moved closer to Sherlock to look down at him.
As he drank he let his mind wonder, working through what had happened and what he had planned with Molly. However, John’s soft snoring from the bunk closest to where Sherlock sat became louder, distracting Sherlock from his thoughts. Turning towards the bunk he reached out and gently touched John’s shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was woken as they began to prep him, the nurses needing the room to get around the bed. Standing he pulled his chair out of the why while lines were unhooked and new lines added, the staff working with practiced ease and years of experience.
"Yeah...do you remember?" John asked as he woke up some more, the fog of sleep lifting from his mind yet his body still refused to come back online.
After a minute or so she gently pulled Sherlock back and giggled at the look John shot her, both a how dare you and a thank you. Turning to Sherlock she gently ran her thumb over his lips, clearing them before kissing him softly, a small moan coming from deep inside of him. John, knelt then taking Sherlock from. Her and kissing him soundly, his tongue obviously lapping up the taste of himself on Sherlock lips.
“John, something really important is happening here.”
"Yeah, I'm fine." John answered his hands wrapping around Sherlock’s wrist as he tried to move. "No, stay. I really am fine."
“Not like this.” John whispered, but he lent down, his lips brushing at Sherlock’s cheek, running over the sharpness of it, shivering at the feel of warm skin, before he moves closer to Sherlock’s ear. “Not like this my love, I want our first kiss to be remembered, to be mutual, to be ours. If I kissed you now it would be his, would belong to him and I won’t have that.”
Sherlock had gone still, his heart having stopped, along with his breathing and all his thought processes, the only thing that moved or worked was his eyes which followed John as he walked around and took the chair in front of Sherlock’s.
“Not like this, please god not like this.”
"Okay. So what do you want to tell me?"
Sherlock stood a good twenty feet away, his hair was cut short, so short that his curls had disappeared, it was also dyed, now more brown than black. He wore dark blue jeans a white button down shirt and a brown leather jacket. He didn't look at all like himself but John knew it was him, he would always know it was him, would always know when those eyes were on him.
.~.~.~.~.
"Yeah, did you want to dress him?"
"Yes, but only to those you don't know. You remembered me in the end so I think if it happens again we just make sure I stick with you."
"Why now?"
“Okay, we need to get him back on the bed.”
John kept his eyes close as the voice spoke around him, or rather he found he was unable to even try to open them he was that tired, but his mind was on high alert and it refused to stay down for too long, only giving him an hour or so of rest before it forced him to wake up yet again.
Cathy.
Sherlock frowned trying to remember. "When?"
Before he took his shirt off however Sherlock paused as he went to free his arms of the wet material. He knew John had seen his back the other night, but it was dark and they were both in a rather bad place, not that they weren't in a bad place now, but then had been worse, or so he thought.
"Seriously it's fine, no orders to force you lot to do anything." Moran was leaving but John needed Maddie to leave.
He watched her as she sat back down and sipped at her drink but said nothing, waiting for her to continue.
"Oh." Once seated he let his head fall foward as he tries to process. "I dont understand. He...I thought he... he was fine!"
"Yes. But they don't matter if this is real."
“When do you start school John?” Molly asked as she helped Mike with the worms.
Opening his eyes, he looked back to John, his breathing had changed, becoming harsher as he felt his heart rate increase.
"Of course I did." Sherlock opened his eyes taking John’s hand in his own and pressing a kiss to the palm. John watched him with dark eyes, lust building up in his stomach while love filled his chest.
Sherlock pulled back first, his breath hot and fast against John's cheek as he pressed his forehead to John's.
John paused and then shrugged. "He's dead."
“No, just that I knew someone here.”
"Okay head down." A voice order and he followed, lowering his head and crouching down. "Okay just try to keep breathing, long slow breaths, in and out...that’s it."
John finished sort the dressing and looked up to find Sherlock with his eyes closed.
Sherlock searched John’s eyes, searched for the lie in his words but didn't find it.
"But...oh god...Sherlock he was so small!"
"He could be a danger."
The two Marines unhooked the object concealed within a black bag as John glanced over at Sherlock his eyes asking the other a question to which Sherlock simply shrugs. As Coffey walks past John glares at him then jumps up onto Flatbed and looks down at Sally.
John stared at the pills, once again taking in a shaking breath and letting it out slowly before popping the pills and taking a mouthful of water, all the while holding Sherlock’s hand.
"Sherlock does care, he has always cared."
The scream was unlike anything he had heard before. It was deep, coming from a place deep within, it was terrifying in it intensity, long and unending, it was heartbreaking, ripping at him as he listened. But above all it drove him forward, forced him to continue on, it made him fight all the harder.
"What if...this surgery is risky and he might not pull through. What are, I mean...did he have any thoughts on donation or anything?"
"I love you." Sherlock whispered raising a hand to John's face. "I am so in love with you John Watson and I will never do what I did again. I want to have you with me, always."
"John." Sherlock grabbed for John's hand, not thinking, just needing to be grounded as images flooded his mind.
“Maybe.” Sherlock said as he faces John. “It was small enough to be in the sub.”
The hands left his face and then Sherlock was gone leaving John alone with Moran and Moriarty.
The divers are working head-first in the missile's launch tube. Monk reads from a plasticized card, directing the other two step by step.
"Two have ripped." She said moving to the cabinet full of medical equipment. "I guess today will be a good day to learn how to stitch, I've been watching you all day."
"They are very lucky that they are. Come on, you make tea I'll call for Cathy."
"I want to say it doesn't matter anymore, that it happened and that is that."
"Welcome home, love." John whispered causing Sherlock’s eyes to open.
"Can I help you?" John asked, not caring about his blood stained clothes and hands, he even had blood smudging his face and neck where Sherlock had touch him, but he didn't care.
“Hit me with it ‘Lock.”
"Sherlock?" This voice was different, but he knew it.
Pushing himself up John looked down at his friend the hand on Sherlock’s chest moving to his face. “No, it’s not.”
"No. No you wont. Or if you are then I wont be...infact yes. Return to Bakerstreet, but have my stuff packed and stored. Afterall I think I may be sectioned by the end of the day."
"How deep's the drop-off here?" Dimmock asks looking around in the darkness.
“I won’t.” Pulling back, he took hold of Sherlock’s face and stared into pain filled eyes. “I promise this ends tonight.”
"So, odd right?" Lestrade said from the otherside of the body while Sherlock knelt before the dead girl, magnifier in hand as he searched her.
“No!”
"Yes, but it's okay. We will find him first." John reached out, delving his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, an action that lightened Sherlock’s eyes and brought his attention fully onto John.
(2:58am)
Sherlock lowered his head then turned, leaving the flat that was his home.
“Molly shut up!” Sherlock near enough shouts causing John to turn before he reaches his bunkroom. Grabbing Sherlock he looks to Molly and Mike his looking telling them to get back to work while he pulls Sherlock into the room and closes the door behind them.
"Process this Sherlock, take your time and work through it all."
“Right.”
.........
“No…I guess a locked room, with no way out is totally normal to you.”
"No, John please."
But the man next to her had been interesting at first, a banker, dressed in a suit that looked immaculate, expensive, yet it was a fake Armani, his shoes, though well looked after were cheap and his hair was clearly dyed. He was stressing over an over sea’s account and was emailing on his three-year-old blackberry. He was low level banker, working his way up, he had money, but he saved everything he could to help pay for his mother’s rehab clinic. A banker with a heart, he had revaluated his interest to boring and moved onto the next person.
"Yes." Sherlock and John answered together.
"As you are to me." Sherlock said as a hand fell onto her waist.
“Right here, this will help, just try to keep breathing, in and out as slowly and as comfortably as you can.” John had gloves on, a syringe in hand which he was putting into one of Sherlock’s IV lines.
John felt the tears run hot trails down his cheeks, he left them, let them dry only to be replaced by more tears.
Sherlock smiled slightly, it was one of those rare smiles that would normally light up his eyes, but this time failed to do so.
"Bye Mycroft." John lowered his phone and stared at the screen for a moment. His life had totally changed in such a short amount of time. He was sitting vigil at the side of a man's bed, a man he was sure would change everything, as well as talking to a man who seemed to have access to everything, a man who knew a lot about everything and seemed to pretty much run anything he wished to at the drop of a hat.
He tried, he really did but the earth just gave way causing more rocks and dirt to fall down into the sea below him.
"If i ever get like that again, leave me, just dont let me hurt you! I could never forgive myself for that and I would never ask you to forgive me."
Sherlock looked out at the garden, at the sky slowly changing to dawn then back to the man.
"I just did."
"What?" Suddenly Greg disappear from the screen and another replaced him. John kept his features in check as eyes the same colour as the deepest greenest and bluest ocean looked at him with anger. Dark curls where wet and sticking to a pale forehead while water ran freely down sharp cheekbones and dripped down onto a black shirt.
Once settled John helps Sherlock, with pillows, to getting into a position he is comfortable with before crouching down before him.
John stared openly, the man was stunning, he was captivating in a way that no other could possibly hope to be and when he turned and looked straight at John the world went silent.
"He lost me close to fifty million John, I think my reasons are justified." The blond replied, so that was MaCormick. John wasn't so sure, the last picture Sherlock had showed him of their target was grainy and the details hard to extract. Apparently MaCormick had dealings in human trafficking, his main business dealing with young girls.
"...fine...I'm fine."
"Yeah, it's going to hurt when we move him." He looked up and smiled brightly. "Which will be any minute now."
The hand in his hair stopped causing John to reopen his eyes. Sherlock was looking up at the ceiling, towards one of the hidden cameras.
"John." Sherlock’s voice said his name in a way John knew well, he was asking him to stay.
"Yes, defensive move on my part. It was either a cut to the hand or to my face." John dropped his hand meaning it fell on his chest.
"Your crew?" Coffey said smiling slightly. "I thought it was Watson's crew."
“John?” Sherlock moved his hands to hold John’s face. “John, it’s okay.”
Lowering his eyes for the first time, taking them from the curled up form before him he just followed the bars that was his cage.
The door opened behind him and he closed his eyes, he really didn’t want to talk to anyone unless it was John.
John smiled, and then he was kissing Sherlock.
“Sorry.”
Time after that moved in spits and spurts for Sherlock. Some days the hours seemed to slip through his fingers, other days it seemed as though the hours lasted a year each.
John smiled slightly. "Army doctor."
"Right."
Andromeda is our closest sister. One day she will be so close that she will fill the night sky."
"It's nothing, I... Mycroft disagreed with my action's."
"I care on a basic level."
John went to touch Sherlock’s hair but stopped himself. He didn't know if Sherlock would welcome his touch and though it pained him not to touch him, he would hold off until told otherwise.
"I'm sure he will reschedule your dinner. "
"You know you keep me from floating away, don't you?"
John laughed, "right."
“What? Say again.”
"Good."
"You said his mind was unlike anyone else you know." John spoke over the doctor as he looked up at Mycroft, causing the two men to look at him. "Explain."
Back in Flatbed Sally finally got hold of the de-coupling mechanism when the cable pulls taut sending the sub sideways and dislodging the grip causing Sally to be tossed about inside the sub as it is pushed violently off course.
As Sherlock walkes back into the living room John stood, his body settling into attention as he felt the discomfort and tension rolling off of Sherlock.
Mycroft started as John said his name and he found his legs taking him to the other side of the bed, as nursing staff still worked around them, attaching leads and making sure all IV lines and ports were clear.
"Its your brother." John said as he walked across the room and placing the phone in Sherlock’s hand.
John felt his hopelessness rising, he could do nothing when they were with them, he was trapped in his cage like an animal with no choice but to watch. The problem with that though was that once he got out there would be no stopping him, meaning those in the room hurting the man he was in love with would wish that they never put him in a cage.
"We need all the information on how he got out and what happened after that."
"Sherlock!" He shouted as in the distance he saw the life boat appear, moving ever closer.
"One on one? Yes. We can see each other when ever you wish."
"Get out."
"We have enough bandages, gloves and particularly everything else to last around a month."
"Derek would have you all infected with flu within the week." Sherlock said as he pulled the cab up to the Leviathan and attaching.
(5:00am)
“It’s okay John.” Sherlock said with a nod. “Turn your back.”
"It's okay." John picked up the towel Sherlock had dropped and slowly started to run it over the pale chest and back were water from dark curls was breaking free and running over the cold skin.
A scream sounded down the other end of the carriage causing John to look up and for the first time, took in the whole carriage. People's were still moving about, helping those that they could, while some where helping others off the carriage and into the underground tunnel, getting as far from the smoke and fire as possible.
John glanced down at Sherlock, finding the man's eyes closed.
"Okay good, its three steps just three." Sherlock's grip tightened on him as they slowly took the first step then the next before finally reaching the chair.
"John," she pulled back once again, then turned to Sherlock and he was kissing her instantly. She heard John's gasp, but her attention was on the man kissing her. When Sherlock pulled back he smiled slightly at her then looked at John with shy eyes. As she took in the captain she saw the heat in his eyes and she knew he was close to caving. "You liked that, seeing him that way."
"Exhausted." And confused, but he didn't say that out loud.
"Yes."
Finally Mycroft stopped pacing, his cold blue eyes now alight with silver fire as they turned on Cathy.
"What can we do?" Mycroft asked.
Trying his hardest not to look at Sherlock he slowly stared to make his way back towards the last of those in his way.
"Mycroft won’t think that."
John had finally said that he loved Sherlock, yet it was said in a way that left Sherlock with no doubt to how John felt now. John didn't want to love him, yet he did and it had gotten to a point that caused John to do what he had done. Sherlock didn't know what was worse, having John not love him or having John love him so much that he felt the only solution was to join Sherlock in death.
“Don’t.”
"Very well done Watson!" Moran clapped, still laughing, all the while the others continued to strip Sherlock.
“Good, then let’s start with the painkillers.” John turns to Mary. “Go back to basics? Start with Co-codaprin, just to see if it helps, if not then up to Co-dydramol.”
"But you're not there anymore Sherlock. We are currently in a hospital, its posher than any hospital I have ever been in but its still one."
"Mycroft, I needed someone to help plan it all. Molly helped with...she...provided the body you first saw."
"How? How do you know about that?" John asked, his captain’s voice coming out slightly.
"Expecting someone?" John asked, his smile returning to a frown. They hadn't discussed a vist from anyone and Cathy had already come to see them today so why the third cup?
"No, thank you, but no. I want to stay, to make sure he is ok."
:D Happy 200 plus Kudos! Love you guys.
Cathy smiled.
Pulling away slightly John moved his hand from Sherlock’s hair to his face, his palm catching on the stubble on Sherlock's face.
"I'm so sorry...so sorry." Taking in a rattling breath he tried to ground himself, to breath normally but the air kept catching causing him to continue to cry.
“Hey, you guys...” She paused looking between them as John let go of Sherlock’s wrists and stepped away. “You best come see this, it’s all over the news!”
Leaning so he could rest his head against the top of Sherlock’s John just soaked in having Sherlock with him a feeling he had been waiting so long to have.
Sherlock held John's eyes as he opened his mouth allowing John to place it on his tongue. Closing his mouth, he relaxed as the cold ice eased his dry mouth, letting the cold water ran over his teeth and gums, relishing the feel.
The Phycologist had returned half an hour ago and had not left. Sherlock was unsure to the meaning of this, if the longer she stayed the more likely John would be section or if the longer she stayed the more like John will be free to leave by the end of the day.
John glared before leaving his chair and making his way down to the compression room, where Mike was already talking to the newcomers.
"No." Sherlock shook his head again. "I was stupid, I never thought, never knew that he could, did feel that way."
"Yes."
“Okay, this might pull a little, your wound is clean but it still weeping slightly.” John warned as he started to take off the last layer.
"True." John dropped his hand to his buttons and started to undo them, once done he suffled on the bed slightly before pulling off the offending clothing and dropping the to the floor.
Sherlock took two long strides forward closing the distance between them and wrapping his arms around John, pulling him close and whispering comforting word into John's hair.
"True." Sherlock smiled back then picked up his phone with his free hand to look into ordering food. "They have a pizza place, Chinese and and Indian."
At once alert, Sherlock spun to face his assailant, and collided with a fist to his temple. Falling to the ground, his head hit the pavement with a thud. All thoughts scattered as his vision blurred and pain overtook him. Closing his eyes, he lay still, trying to breathe through the pain.
Sherlock watched all this, his smile slipping slowly away, a frown taking it's place as he tried to work out what has gone wrong.
"John?" Sherlock moved then, placing his hands on John's face. "John, my mind is working against."
"Yes."
“I don't know.” He answered. “I DON'T KNOW!” He repeated his hands delving into his hair.
"The messages?" John asked as he moved his hands to Sherlock’s hips.
"I think my aversion to touch was due to only wanting yours." John whispered before pressing his lips harder again the increasing pulse in Sherlock’s neck.
Standing John placed one of the guns down the back of his trousers and slowly made his way through the small maze of machines till he came out facing MaCormick and the last two of his goons.
(3:05am) Anyone of importance? JW
"Utterly ridiculous." Sherlock muttered causing John to smile.
“He was here. Was he in the explosion?” John watches as Sherlock turns the screen to his brother pointing out the man.
“Yes.”
John frowned. “I really wish you would let me take you to hospital.”
"Then bring him with you." Sherlock found himself staring at John through the glass door. John had come on much in the months Sherlock had been there, but he still wasn't ready to leave, to work cases, to be woth other people.
Blinking slowly he stared up at the ceiling for a moment before turning onto his side, tucking his hands under his head and finding Sherlock led facing him with worried filled eyes.
"It could have been worse." John shrugged. "So how did you work that out?"
John walked back over to the chair next to Sherlock’s bed and sat with a sigh.
John froze.
“But you think it's something else. What? One of ours?” John asks not paying attention to what Sherlock had first said.
“Dead. Mycroft will cover everything up, he has the others.”
"So what does that mean?"
"Yes John, he is very much dead."
"What is?"
Sherlock was a mess, of course he was. Tortured for three days, still recovering from his wounds and now given something that just made every cut, bruise and broke bone even worse. He was going through hell and John was useless, he could only watch as his friend suffered alone.
"Sherlock you were dreaming, it seems to have induced a flashback and hallucinations." Cathy said as she made her way to the kitchen and started to make tea and coffee.
Searching John’s eyes he felt a calm ease over him. He really was home, with John, with the love of his life and he would always be home as long as John was with him.
“No, there is more to it than that.”
"Stop it!"
"Tell me John, if I did kill him, slowly pushed a blade into his heart, would you feel it? Every single inch of it, slowly killing what means the most to you."
"Sherlock...I nicked Cathys phone. Most fun I've had in a while.
"John...where are we?" Sherlock now looked slightly panicked, a look John was not used to seeing on that perfect face.
“Okay, explain.” John ordered as he crossed his arms.
"Sherlock what the hell are you doing?" Greg’s voice came over the headset just as Sherlock prepped to launch.
"Jackson?" His therapist asked.
"Really?" Moran, still facing Sherlock, pointed his gun behind him, aiming it right at John's head.
"I know." John finally whispered.
"I won't apologie." He finally said expecting some sort of reaction but she did nothing.
"This is real Sherlock." He whispered. "You are  having a vivid flashback and I will help you through it. But I need you...please I need you." He felt stupid and weak as his voice broke and tears started to fall.
"Sir yes sir!" John could see the mock salute Moran would have just given in his mind’s eye, his tone of voice leading those around him to think he was joking, but John could hear the undertone, the tone that said 'don’t fucking underestimate me.'
"Breath Dimmock, nice and slow. Come on mate, concentrate and just breath."
“No, don’t…. stop!” John tried but it was no use. Moran was stronger, he hadn’t been given the time to heal and so he was easily forced into the cage. It was tall enough for him to stand in, but he wouldn’t be able to lay down in it, probably only sit with his legs stretch out before him. As the door closed he grabbed hold of the bars and just looked at Sherlock.
Until.
"How long?" Sherlock asked, licking his lips and frowning at his dry lips.
Mycroft looked to the nurse sat at the desk, the dark hair woman looking Mycroft with a raised eyebrow before turning to John.
A low moan escaped Sherlock’s lips as his face scrunched up and he started to shake violently.
"No need, it was an understandable reaction."
John frowned then sighed. "Oh...how long did MaCormick have you?"
"Bad..." the man whispered and John was taken back by how deep his voice was even in a whisper.
“Why?”
"Where are you looking?" John asked moving his head closer to Sherlock’s and looking up his arm to try and work out what Sherlock was asking about.
"Why? You must be lossing your mind by now? You must want to leave by now."
"The divorce isn’t finalised yet."
Walking to the head of the bed John reached out for the first time and gently ran his fingers through the soft dark curls.
"I know; I've been watching you."
Breathing a few shallow breaths, finding it hard to take in any more he pushed himself up off the floor groaning in pain as he did so.
Donovon’s usual natural curls had been pulled back into a painful-looking ponytail, John guessed because of the heat. She scoffed, attempting to look angry at Sherlock but failing miserably. She led them to the murder scene where Lestrade was waiting for them. He gave John a hearty smile as he came to stand next to him, both turning to watch Sherlock begin his deductive dance around the body.
Sherlock’s phone dinged on the table, and, without thinking, John moved to pick it up.
John broke apart, only then remembering where they were. He looked around, noticing that all of the officers had stopped their conversations and were watching them. Greg was sitting with the brightest grin on his face, whether it was from being happy for them or owing Anderson money, John didn’t know.
Looking down at the dark curls sprouting from Rosie’s head, however, he knew it to be true.
John had once marvelled that Mary could put up with so much from him. Even before Sherlock’s return, he would have violent outbursts, where he would just snap and start shouting. Mary did nothing more than sit there with a calm expression and open arms when he had eventually calmed down.
Sherlock’s lips curled around his cigarette. ‘If you want to. I would have thought you’d want more of a romantic setting than looking at a dead body.’
Greg cleared his throat. ‘Anything?’
Twenty minutes later, John and Sherlock were seated around a large beer garden, string lights overhead illuminating everyone’s eyes as they drank like they were in University.
John rolled his eyes. ‘Betting on us again, are you?’
More often than not, when he was left alone to contemplate things, his mind usually landed on Mary.
And, to John, that was exactly what he wanted. He knew what kind of a man Sherlock was when he was trying too hard to please the people around him. The way his partner reacted before John’s wedding came to mind as an example. It was good that he wasn’t thinking too much of it, as it meant John could do most of the observation.
‘How’s your experiment?’
‘I couldn’t have done it without you.’
‘Hm?’ Sherlock finally turned towards the table, giving John his full attention. Grey eyes bored into his own, but John refused to break eye contact. ‘Why am I being stupid to think that you abhor the idea of a relationship with me?’
It was because of this realisation, then, that John cornered Sherlock in the back of the cab on the way home that night, pushing himself into his space and muttering in his ear.
‘Wait, the night you went for Chinese was the night you got together?’ Greg asked incredulously. ‘And you didn’t bother letting me know this has been going on for a month?’
‘John.’
‘Come on, you have to! You’ve got the entire night to yourselves!’ Lestrade was pulling all the stocks, for some reason determined to get the two to join them.
John was still on his first, along with Sherlock, who had wisely only chosen a beer. It was strange seeing Sherlock drink something so...pedestrian. It made him seem a lot more approachable, as they both found when he began to get engaged in conversation more around the table.
‘Donovon, if you carry on making obvious deductions like that, you’ll make detective by next year.’ Sherlock said as casually as he could, taking a sip of his beer.
‘What?’ John managed incredulously, Sherlock’s initial words finally sinking home.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped back to John. ‘What?’
Sherlock pulled back only enough to look him in the eye. ‘You did. You took care of me like you always do.’ His eyes were sparkling in the lights above. John felt tears well up in his throat.
‘Roger.’ John nodded, noticing Angelo as he made his way towards their table.
Sherlock’s eyes rolled upwards. ‘Do you want to advance our relationship to include a romantic element?’
John chuckled and leaned into Sherlock’s space. ‘No, sorry, I really didn’t hear that, what did the brilliant Sherlock Holmes just call me?’
The answer shocked both him and Greg when it was announced, and the brilliant bastard continued his work on the crime scene like it was nothing.
‘Yeah.’ John skimmed the text, then wrinkled his nose, ‘pretty disgusting murder, apparently. Greg said it could be linked to those kidnappings.’
“Makes sense.”
“You were sleeping John. You hadn’t slept properly in forty-eight hours, me and the doctor thought it best to just let you sleep. But now that you are both awake we can go through what is planned.” Mary looked up, her pale blue eyes gentle. “The opioid rout is obviously not going to work, your tolerance is too high.”
"I could...should have gone with you."
(3:07am)
John moves over to Schoenick but his eyes stay on Coffey.
"Right. Well...goodnight Sherlock." John said as he opened the door, not waiting for an answer before he walked out.
Coffey and Schoenick bring Monk through on a stretcher. He had been caught under fallen pipes, his leg broken badly. Sherlock had been able to free him with the help of Molly and the two other Marines. As the placed Monk on a table he moans slightly, out of it on painkillers. They had splintered his leg as best they could, he would defiantly be out of action for a while.
Sherlock's mind raced through ever small touch of lips since John had kisses his hand, every touch, every sigh, every thought of want, every feeling if needing John near him. This was right, this kiss was theirs, and he was so glad John had waited.
(10:13am)
"I don't even know you. But damn, if you don't pull through, I will make sure to bring you back myself just so I can kill you again." John smiled, his other hand reaching to cup the side of Sherlock’s face. "Come back form the surgery, just do that one thing, then we can move onto the next."
Sherlock’s high diminished as John fell onto his chair his head resting in his hand as his eyes closed. Standing, Sherlock quickly sorted himself out then just stood as he watched John. He knew he should go, knew this was a mistake but he also knew that if he didn’t come today then he would have tomorrow, or the next day or the next and he would have never been able to concentrate on what he really had to do so it had to be today.
Cathy raises her hands as she sits down across from the two men.
Enjoy x x
"I know. Believe me I know. Can you trust me?"
"I...I need to-" John started.
Doctor Ansari turned as John came up to the bed and smiled.
"No clothes, allows for a better canvas, or so I'm told." Moran shrugged, showing that he really didn't care.
Pulling back, he licks his lips as his eyes open, losing himself in crystal clear waters of greens and blues.
“John?”
“Do you mind?” John asks indicating the hatch. Lestrade hesitates only a second before grabbing the handle to the hatch and pulling. The sight that greats him causes him to step back as the hatch falls fully open, the sound of it falling to the ground echoing through the empty room.
"Of course not. John you need to sleep, you had maybe an hour or two in that chair but that is not enough. There is a family room with a shower and a bed down the hall. Go sleep, I will get someone to wake you when we are ready to wake Sherlock."
"Dear god..."
Sherlock pressed two not waiting for the confirmation that the message had been saved as he lowered the phone. Staring out into the darkness of the flat he felt tears fall down his face. He missed John, missed his voice, had wanted to here anything from him. But the message only served as a reminder of how damaged John was, he sounded dead, sounded empty, useless, defeated. Closing his eyes he resolved himself to the fact that over the next few months this would be all the contact he had with John, these messages, these snippets of what was happening in the life of John Watson, he had done it for nearly two years, he could do it again.
"Sebastian please!" John called dropping the object in his hand and knelt to conceal it at the same time that he grabbed hold of the bars. It was pathetic, his voice hopeless, his eyes brimming with angry tears, his knuckles whiting as he gripped the bar.
“What explosion?” John asked having not heard of one.
"I know John, and I failed you. Both of you."
Thinking over what had been talked about, he felt himself tighten his grip on the man in his arms and then slowly ran through all possible options. There was no way he was leaving Sherlock, even if he was allowed in on the operation to catch the criminal mastermind that seemed to want Sherlock's attention. He would never be able to forgive himself if anything did happen while he was gone. So no, he wouldn't be leaving.
"Right...trust a man I've never met before?" Pain suddenly laced through his abdomen, causing Sherlock to double over, his arms wrapping around himself as strong hands found his shoulders, stopping him from falling to the ground.
When they broke apart, their breathing harsh he slowly opened his eyes to find Sherlock smiling smugly.
"Umm." John nodded as his eyes closed and he just gave in and let his head fall back to rest on Sherlock's shoulder.
"Don’t leave." Sherlock whispered.
"John...please." Sherlock whispered look up at John.
Watching Sherlock's face drop slightly he can not help but smile slightly, which in turn causing Sherlock to smile back and the butterflies once again return.
"He needs to shower." Sherlock said walking the distance between him and Greg. "Dont take it personally."
The doors swung hard hitting the walls, interupting the silence for a moment before a long suffering sigh escaped the man waiting at the end of the hall.
Kicking the covers from his legs he got up and pulled on his dressing gown. He was able to leave his room when he wished, even at night, perks of going up in his recovery, he just couldn't go outside without someone being with him.
“Yeah.” John nodded, though he was far from cold.
"I can't." Sherlock said quietly as he nodded his thanks to John while he dropped his unfinished cigarette and took the tea.
Sighing she turned from the window but before she could take another step the panic button alarm sounded. Looking across her room to the light board that indicated the room, she was less than surprised to see the apartment light flashing at her.
"Yes I am a ridiculous man, I'm a doctor who went to war, I run towards danger not away from it and you Sherlock scream danger and my god am I addict to it all ready."
Mycroft arrived and John lost Sherlock’s attention as his brother handed over the USB holding the tapes from the explosion.
(9:33am)
Thank you x x
"No, it's not."
“It’s okay I have you.” John’s voice was gentle as he spoke to Sherlock, bring the longer fingers up to his lips and brushing over then softly.
"John, why?"
"Mycroft."
.~.~.~.~.
"I was chained up, was forced to stand with my arms above my head, I had been stripped of my clothing in the first night. This guy came in for the first time and he didn’t hurt me, his touches were gentle, soft. He cleaned me, washed away the dirt, the blood, sick...everything. He then talked at me, I didn't talk back, I didn't talk to any of them. He then...he made me hard, he made me...ejaculate."
“I’ll be the judge of that.” Strong hands turned gentle as fingers feathered at his temple, making him jump. Sherlock’s eyes flew open for a moment to catch the image of a man, concern obvious in the downturn of his brows. As he tried to focus on that face, his world tilted again and he closed his eyes.
He moved instantly across the floor taking Sherlock’s face in his hands and lifting it so he could check his eyes: dazed and unfocused, his fingers moving to his neck checking his pulse; fast and unsteady.
"Panic attacks do that." The man held a hand out and John took it. As he was pulled to his feet the man placed his other hand to John's arm, steadying him. "Easy."
"Never ever leave. I know I ask this a lot, just please, don't leave me." John asked.
"Can't."
Turning back to the water, Sherlock needs to know more, has to know more so he reaches forward, a gasped ‘Don’t,’ coming from John before his finger touched the water shaped like John and pushed in sending ripples through the surface. Pulling it back he looks at the drop of water on his finger before touching the finger to his tongue.
“They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level. They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever. Put it under intelligent control.” Sherlock answers, his mind running through every which way that water could be controlled.
"Myc-"
Their destination was behind a set of double doors that swung both ways. It was a large open area, taking up most of the floor with what looked like small offices off to the left hand side. Windows took up most of the right but they had been blocked by card and black paint, leaving the only light source to be the strip lights overhead. The room itself was sparse with only a cage of some sort set up in the middle of the room.
"Blue, bluer than any other sky I have seen. But at night, it came alive. The light pollution at the main base prevented you from seeing much. But if you got a night patrol you were compensated with the view of the stars. So many stars. You can see the milky way as clear as day, stretching right across the vast darkness." John stopped and pointed up. "You can see it here, just not as clearly."
Sherlock watches as Mycroft gets his things together.
(2:13am)
“Yes we should.” He turned with a smile on his face that instantly left as he noted blood dripping onto the floor. “Sherlock?”
“No, but I think I know who he is.”
Another crack and another jolt of pain but still he kept quiet.
“I didn’t even think of this happening.” John said as he gently took Sherlock’s hand in his own.
"I'm sorry...I'll tell them to not come, to leave." As he said this a knock sounded on the door causing John to jump, his hand grabbing Sherlock’s wrist in such a way that he could feel Sherlock’s pulse.
A burning pain started in the pit of his stomach and slowly started to spread.
Sherlock sat before his legs gave out.
Sighing he sat back in his chair and looked about once again before picking his glass back up and downing the amber liquid then holding it up to indicate he wished for a top up.
"He might wake; just tell him I'll be right back."
Watching Coffey walk away he shakes his head and starts to pull on the rest of his gear. As he pulls on his oxygen tanks he struggles slightly until someone hefts the tanks onto his back. Turning as he goes to tighten his straps and say thank you he pauses as Sherlock takes over and makes sure everything was securely fix and in its right place.
Time was a none existent thing when you are in pain. You have no concept of it, it’s like the whole world stops, even the sun stops so that night and day no longer happen and everyone you meet just happens to be there all that the same time. But then that’s not true, only one person is there constantly.
"Umm, few more minutes." John muttered as he closed his eyes.
“What do you think he saw?” John asked gently catching Sherlock’s eyes for the first time since entering the room.
“John?”
"Please John."
(See the end of the chapter for
Turning fully, Sherlock slowly sunk down to sit on the stairs as John came and stood on the bottom step causing them to be at the same hight.
John watches her go then looks back to Sherlock, his eyes were closed and for a moment John thought he had fallen back under.
"No."
"Please."
“So do as I ask, get rid of it all, delete it all, every bit of it.”
Nurses covered in blood and dirt darted about while doctors shouted orders, stabilising patients, and preforming lifesaving procedures in the middle of the ER.
“What's the matter with you?” John finally asked.
John would wake soon, to find he failed.
John lent over the back of Sherlock’s chair as he did as his brother instructed. When it go to the last ten minutes the image paused then started up once again.
Some hours later, after refusing to leave, a heavy blanket was wrapped around his shoulders and a warm cup of something pushed into his hands. He didn't drink it, but he held it, letting the warmth melt his sore stiff fingers.
"About a week after coming here. It was just small reactions at first, but it soon became evident that his phobia had increased, epically when he broke one of our orderlies arm. His anger doesn't help either."
"Home." He whispered leaning against the door. "John something is wrong."
"You wont even touch me now." John stated as he chocked back a sob, pulling further away from the frightened man before him.
"Yeah, he will know."
"Six months."
The doors when opened revealed the man he didn't know and when he stepped in John kicked out landing a hit but not able to give it much strength. The man raised his eye brown then looking behind him a second before stepping even closer.
"It's okay John." Lestrade said as he righted John then lowered his hands stepping back and giving John his space.
Lifting her eyes she locked eyes with John.
"That..." John stated then he begun to laugh causing Sherlock to pull back and frown down at John.
"It's good to see you. Sherlock has said you are getting better and you are hoping to come home."
“Dead then?”
"Take me home Sherlock."
"I don't care! Get in there and get them out!" This caused Cathy to catch her breath but she didn't allow herself to overreact until she knew the whole story.
"I trust you."John answered with a frown as the two men sat on the sofa.
Lowering his head John gripped the bed rails and closed his eyes for a moment.
John was given a whole week off school when they moved into their new home, a week to explore, to get a feel for the place that he would have his first birthday party at, the place he would have his first sleepover, the place he would have his first ever friend over for tea.
However, don't hate me!
"No!" John almost shouted as he pulled Sherlock back to him. "No, god no, Sherlock that was fucking amazing!
Closing his eyes, John clenched his fists and just concentrated on his breathing.
"Half way to the hospital. He's stable, just concentrate on you now." The younger man said as he hooked John up to monitor's and started to clean up some of the smaller cuts on his face and arms.
Once they had gone and John heard the lock slid into place he made his way to Sherlock and lent over him as though to check his eyes.
“John.”
“No,” Sherlock wanted to protest, but it sounded more like a whimper.
"Gravity?" John asks.
"Sherlock please, please open your eyes. Please." John lifted one of his hands and gently shook at Sherlock’s shoulder. "Sherlock!"
Shifting his attention he took in the man stood before Sherlock and with no doubt or hesitatency he raised his hand and shot the man through the head.
“What? Your training? Your former life?” Greg asked as they walked through the halls, John leading. “Ex-military, that it obvious, doctor again obvious. But there is more, so much more. You’re a crack shot, that much became clear after you shot the cabbie.”
A gun shot rang out causing John to jump from the bed and position himself between Moriarty and Sherlock. However, the gun wasn’t aimed at either of them and when Maddie fell to the ground he reacted instinctively and went to her. In that instance Moran moved, grabbing John and pinned him to the floor, holding his arms behind his back. John struggled but as Moran pressed into his side his vision whited out as pain ripped through his body causing him to gasp back a scream that threatened him.
Sherlock stood stunned as they pulled John away. He had seen the dark intent in John's eyes just as he had lifted his free hand, he knew John had intended to harm, to at the very least break Sherlock’s arm. As John fell unconscious and the orderlies took him from the canteen Sherlock spun to face Cathy, notat all caring about the others now watching him as they all lost intrest in their food.
