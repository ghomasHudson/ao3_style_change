John was drying one of the dinner dishes, holding both it and the towel as he watched Sherlock pull an item from the bag and set it on the mantel, right next to his own violin-serenading frog. Although it had been a rather whimsical piece, he recalled that it had meant a lot to him, seeing it in his previous bedsit, the challenge from his therapist to find something pleasing and decorative that he enjoyed. It had been joined by ...
"Yes." John's throat is suddenly dry, but he will not evade this now. When Sherlock is ready to talk, John must be ready too.
They said farewell to some of the other team members, and John waited until they were out of earshot before asking Sameer what was troubling him.
"It's Dan." The voice was breathy, higher pitched than usual. "I can't stop shaking." Under the words, John could hear the tremble and the oddly audible breathing.
Mycroft's last recollection was the burning, the stinging, of IV medication. Of beginning to feel claustrophobic approaching panicky, what with the oxygen and the bite block and the monitoring equipment, and thinking that he'd made a terrible mistake and that he was going to call the whole unnecessary, ridiculous, dangerous thing off. Pressing up with both arms, toward his face, resisting everything he could reach, he tried to wrench his body away. The sedation waved through him and he could distantly hear the voice of John Watson as his eyes closed of their own accord - unacceptable, out of control, stop this right now! - and then John's voice, calmly, "You're fine, deep breaths now, that's it," and there was the faint squeeze of a warm hand holding onto his shoulder, also John's hand, warm and dependable.
. And then slowly, cautiously, silently, he tucked his foot under the blankets until it brushed up against Sherlock's bare foot. For a few moments there was no response as the warmth from John's sock-covered foot meshed with Sherlock's, then slowly Sherlock pulled at the blanket, lowering it slowly, just enough until his face was visible.
John doesn't take the piss. "Okay. Don't wake me if you do, so, either way, I'll see you in the morning then."
The nurse and John exchanged small observations in the bathroom, and they could hear the sound of hand-washing, a toothbrush, of the light flicking off. And then John was back, exhausted from the activity and tucked into bed again, the pillow adjusted.
Sonya waited until John had closed the door again before speaking. There was a bit of surprise, of shock, amazement even. "His eyes, I had seen pictures, but my god, they are so
"He's been ... asking for you, and is ... quite anxious to return to his room." She leaves unstated that he has likely been complaining or a bit demanding. The message comes across plainly in her tone and inflection.
Through the door, the secretary from earlier pokes her head in. "They're finishing up soon, back to ICU then. Radiologist is already scrubbing in on the next case, but sounds like another twelve hours, give or take, on that infusion, and they're going to want him back down here, re-study."
"Not really. You push his buttons, and it won't take much." Mycroft looked back steadily, so John clarified. "You excel at it. Both of you seem to thrive on it. In fact, there are times I'd wager that you love it."
, John had eventually hissed with a few curse words interspersed. "I could have bloodied your nose!" His broken words, forceful and clear: it'd be risky to do that again.
Briefly, Mycroft was tempted to reach into his pocket, pull out a few notes. He considered that helping someone took many forms, that to be someone's safety net - or cash - was not always in their best interests. Moreso, he doubted this man could find Sherlock when CCTV and some others in his realm couldn't. "Not today."
John half expected to receive some sort of communication from Sherlock, either on the volunteer hotline, or to his mobile directly. It wouldn't have surprised him to have found Sherlock loitering outside his bedsit, either. But it ended up being just as quiet, forlorn, and dismal as usual.
"Medical futility." Sherlock uttered the phrase that cut to the heart of the issue. Survival in some cases, a possibility; in others, highly unlikely.
"I never agreed to this. Why isn't she with Mrs. Hudson?" He frowned as John handed the leash in his direction while Sherlock shouldered the bag that included her food, bowl, brush, blanket, and a couple of toys. "Or at a kennel?"
On the screen, Mycroft's eye narrowed. John made that sound again, deep in his throat, that he hoped was inaudible to Mycroft. Sherlock glared, sidelong, but added a quiet and mildly threatening, "Please."
"What is it? What's wrong?" There is a little fear again, back in his tone of voice and in the set of his face. "John?" Sherlock's voice sounds young and uncertain, whether from anxiety or from laying flat or something else, but it carries with it a large amount of emotion.
"The one we don't know for sure he even has?" She doesn't really wait for him to agree, simply shakes her head good-naturedly with a smile and one raised, amused brow. "We're tabling this discussion, for the moment." In the pause that follows, she sees John's frown, his concern, and softens a little, knowing his worries are beyond most peoples just given his background, his knowledge. "Because there are two sides, and it's complicated. There are compelling reasons for either option, you know. So not to brush you off, but let's proceed by getting the info first, okay?" He nods, smile, nods again as her wise words sink in. It is helpful that his concerns are validated as very real and not ignored. Satisfied for the moment, Marjorie turns to assess Sherlock and the totality of the situation, checking the IV pumps, eyeing the ventilator, the monitor, and raising Sherlock's eyelids one at a time before placing her stethoscope to his chest and listening in four fields plus Erb's point. She flips the chestpiece to the bell, listens further - lungs, abdomen, back to the diaphragm and listens to carotid arteries.
"Different," John agrees, smiling as they hold out their hands, appreciating the matching simple, plain rings.
John smiles against his pillow at Sherlock's submission, his languor. "Seems you have a fondness," he leans forward as he speaks, presses his lips against Sherlock's jaw, "for this," and as he delivers the last words he crooks his fingers again against Sherlock's sensitive follicles. There is tension and togetherness and the pull of Sherlock's head back against John's shoulder. John is fairly certain that, although in the present moment, the sensations are relaxing Sherlock, under different circumstances, he might find it ... different. Escalating. Arousing.
John ran the towel through his hair, briskly, enjoying the feel of skin open to air again. With a gentle rub, he dried his face, where the N95 had brushed and rubbed, leaving his nose, the areas over his cheeks slightly reddened still and oversensitive, a little pressured, but there were no open areas, no rash, like he'd seen on some of the providers. Not yet. His eyes met with Sherlock's and he brushed the towel over the rest of him, breathing in and enjoying the steam, the restorative shower, the promise of dinner shortly.
Gazing steadily, Ella smiled warmly, and her eyes conveyed trust and confidence, reflecting how much progress the man opposite her had made. "I do. But the rest, the other issues, are going to have to be up to you." She eyed the papers in front of her and gave him a hopeful smile. "We should keep moving, then. As you said at the beginning, you have a job interview later today. Let's be sure you're there on time."
"Perfect, then. I can manage that." Although his words could have been spiteful, he takes care to back down, to let Sherlock vent, to freely speak his mind.
One such time however, when there was no warning and no time to prepare, they were out simply returning home from dinner. The kerb was crowded and there was some shoving ahead of them. Jostling and trying to simply stay out of the way, an angry young man happened to catch sight of them and as he pushed past them - thankfully on a mission to go somewhere else - and despite John's attempt to get between his path and that of the kids, there was a quick moment. The man took them all in, seeing in a flash the family, the two of them, and as he shoved past, happened to become even more agitated, come closer to where they were walking, and unleash a few derogatory words.
"Saved his leg." The surgeon spoke quickly, emphatically, cutting off John's rationalisation. "Your presence was ... fortuitous. Good work."
"I know. You need this first." With his other hand, he found Sherlock's fingers clenched beyond tightly to the rail. "Let up a little here, before you hurt yourself. That's it, feel my hands? Sorry about the gloves, but ... at least I'm here with you. I'm going to help you relax, and the medicine will help, and then ..."
His brother made a vomiting sound which earned him a glare from Mycroft, who was preparing to sit down and enjoy his dinner, and he gestured with annoyance at his food and his unappreciation at the bodily noise Sherlock mimicked.
Most of his alerts were tied in to particularly delicate situations that would require his intervention, and triaged by colour of severity. Scandals involving high-level officials or international incidents were also most often reported to him. He of course monitored his parents and their safety, as well as Lady Smallwood, Irene Adler even after all these years, and John and Rosie Watson. London in general. Volatile situations involving other strong economic players. Brexit. The former Mary Watson. He chose not to dwell on some of the previous alerts - John's fists, Mary's mortal wound in the aquarium, the showdown between Sherlock and Culverton Smith. Sherlock's alerts had drastically changed over the years, and thankfully no longer involved the overdose or ASBO. Of late, they had been fairly benign.
"No." Rob jerks his head at the monitor, where the oxygen level is flashing, reading only eighty-four percent, and everyone, John included, understands what the answer was and why.
Another round of coffee later, and a small meal, and they lounged around the house, vaguely referring to possibilities for the afternoon or evening now and again. Sherlock eventually began deducing the home's owners by their decor and library, while John unearthed a small, handheld puzzle contraption out of one of the cabinets in the sitting room. "They're immigrants from one of the former Russian countries. Uzbekistan perhaps."
"Good morn --" and he broke stride. The familiar face, eyes, hair, and personae seemed to take over the area as Sherlock waited. A cool but engaged expression met him. "Okay," he said with a brief hesitation. "I didn't know you were coming."
John thanked both the nurse and the phlebotomist who scanned and bagged the lab specimen, then sat there in silence until the door was closed.
"Just in time," Dean says. "John was just trying to connect some of the details, figure it all out."
When it came time to retire for the night, they discovered they needn't have bothered with the dog bed.
Until that moment, the afternoon had also been a run of the mill sort, with the both of them puttering around until John put on a movie. He'd enjoyed it, but Sherlock had been less engaged than usual and, sulking, managed to fall asleep.
- for refusing to engage in any of the decisions at the moment. "You're not going to help. Not interested in it at all, yeah?"
Staff returned into the building, except for a few who stood, staring off. The nurse pushed the empty wheelchair back slowly into the building, and the area had mostly emptied of personnel, people returning to their offices or units, going who-knew-where, leaving only a few in the hollow entryway.
"You know what else'd make me feel better?" Although John's first thought is something of a sexual nature, his tone and his expression make it clear that he is referencing a cigarette when he looks again at the pack in front of them.
"I couldn't wake her ..." "oh god, I'm sorry" " ... I tried to get through ..." "... extremely high fever ..." "... my mobile battery died ..." "... and when I did, they said you'd already left ..." "... I know, I'm sorry..." "... of course they needed consent to treat ..." "... I was scared shitless when no one was home ..." "... I didn't think it would be an issue, no note ..." " ... they were asking about a spinal tap, for gods sake ..." "... so when I finally tracked you down ..." "... I didn't know what to do ..." "I had stopped to pick up dinner ..." "I even called Mycroft while waiting for the ambulance." "... Oh Sherlock ..." "I was ... so worried ..." "... if I could do this over ..."
His report, along with photos, observations, and times were passed along to his supervisor. He was thanked and, according to the plan, dismissed. It occurred to him that he'd worked himself right out of a job. Part of it, the undercover assignment part, he had really liked.
There was a deep chuckle, and Sherlock skimmed his long fingers down John's front, pinching very slightly against John's pectoral muscle before coming to rest at his belt, just barely resting over it. "Don't make me resort to these sorts of devious tactics tonight."
"What are you, two?" John braces one foot in front of Sherlock's and then leverages his weight while supporting Sherlock's arms and uses momentum to gently but firmly ease him to his feet. "I know you're exhausted, but come on," he adds gently. "I'll help."
The nod is stronger, more agreement. Sherlock's eyes open, and he blinks, then his pale eyes stutter about. He gazes from one side of the bed to the other, finally settle and stay on John. His pale eyes are foggy, but open and tracking him.
A raised brow, the stress-induced heightened awareness, a question in his eyes - can I? - the hesitation of consideration. Normal days they would never, but today, with a close call, the fear of what might have happened, inhibitions fall away and they plunge ahead.
"I will stay," he said as Sherlock offered his hand. It seemed that he was trying to mesh with the furniture in an attempt to stay.
"Patent foramen ovale. Remnants of foetal circulation, direct opening between the right and left upper chambers of the heart. It's an atrial-septal defect. It's common, and actually stays open in, somewhere around maybe twenty-five percent of the population but it's never a problem for almost everyone. It usually closes up in the ... oh I don't know, first couple weeks of life in the newborn." John blinks, sees Greg looking ... perplexed. "That was more than you wanted, wasn't it."
"Or give it to me," Sherlock said, demanding although teasingly. "I can figure it out without opening it."
"Have to hold pressure here, make sure there's no more bleeding inside." With three fingers, John presses tight through the pyjamas, adding some bulk to the area by pulling off a pillow case with one hand, folding it inexactly, rolling it into place under his hand, pressing again. "Tuck the pillow under your shoulders if you need," he suggests when he notes that Sherlock's breathing is a little deep, heavy. "I'd help, but I'm a little --"
Both the disease and the vaccines are new. While we do not know the long-term effects of the vaccine we also do not know the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection. We do know COVID-19 is a very contagious infection and can be a serious illness for many people. Vaccines are a safer choice for protecting everyone.
"Do you bring news?" Sonya was still hopeful after all this time, and her dark eyes were bright and searching.
"It's to check your coagulation studies. To be sure the heparin in your IV is running at the right dose." This was explained by a nurse who had come in behind the phlebotomist. "Good morning," she said to John, then frowned a little at the cocoon of sulking patient.
"Thanks for coming," he said. His voice was weak but his words were clear. After so long on the ventilator, John was impressed and told him so. “And thanks for everything back when I first got sick. I don’t remember everything but ... you were there for me.”
"I'll ring you with a time, then." He considers John's rumpled state of being. "Keep your mobile charged. And do speak up if you, or Sherlock, come to need something."
She could have looked at a room full of other friends, adults, role models, influences from friends of her parents to school mates to neighbours and mentors all along the way. Instead, her eyes light on her brother, who is beaming. She's heard the term before but never seen it. Beyond excited, he is alight with joy from the inside out, and it radiates, casting a happiness about the room.
"Of course I do." Sherlock made a face when John contradicted him, so John continued. "I certainly enjoy it while
The doors opened into the hallway, which were deserted, no visitors, minimal staff even, hospital-wide trying to keep contact and exposure down. Out of the unit came the morgue stretcher. Again. The metal base, wheels and pedals and brakes, silver and cold and boxey held up another hard, cold, gray stainless steel platform under a rigid cover, but the plastic wrap had got stuck so I could see the white shroud pack underneath it. I don't know why anyone bothers to hide that it's a body anyway, obvious, it's a morgue cart and no one is hiding anything. But this time, two nurses in gear, gloves, gowns, masks, shields, booties, pushing it. One of them had recently been crying. The fatigue is carved from inside to the very edges of their PPE. It is in the set of their shoulders and the lack of spring in their steps.
More photos. One of Sam playing football, and one where he is holding Rosie's hand as they cross the street. "The little girl is cute. Also Dr. Watson's child?"
"Are you by yourself?" The words on the other end of the line were slurred and somewhat slow. "Dan?" In the background was some murmuring that stopped abruptly into a dry, hacking, fierce-sounding cough. He kept the mobile up against his ear and made a snap decision as he picked up a land-line.
"Congratulations." He taps at his own ring-adorned hand while grinning at them both. All three are smiling as they continue on with their evening, Angelo to work the room and assure a great dining experience. John and Sherlock have a similarly great experience that evening, there in the bedroom back at Baker Street.
"Hmm," Dawn says from the bedside, "perhaps he's not too much a fan of being awake, or even a little bit awake, with this tube."
"Watch my son ... plays football ... Mann City farm team. We go to their games," and he would have said more but he couldn't catch his breath just then.
The echosonographer presses a few buttons, clearly recording the images, while Marjorie explains, pointing to the image of Sherlock's beating heart on the screen, the heart chambers visible, the valves. "Appendage is right here, see, this curved segment here? Zoom in there, thanks. Perfectly clean, no clot. Not that we expected it, but it indicates a much less likely explanation of afib causing some - any - of his symptoms." She obtains a few more images and viewpoints, then nods at the nurse.
Had another flashback to the hospital, just another memory, of overhearing conversations at the nurses station. There must've been a cardiac arrest or something and they were laughing afterward and the patient had died and while I remember that of course it just struck me. Actually I remember from Barts too, as well as the army, about going to pronounce someone and then going to grab lunch. And I remember vividly giving bad news to patients, many patients and sometimes the families were there too. And afterward you just kind of move on and do what you have to. Meanwhile somewhere in some room or at home or in a waiting room there are people who have just been absolutely devastated by what has happened. These I dunno defining moments, where a very peripheral happening for one person completely alters another persons life. I didn't find it upsetting or anything. But it kind of hit me being on the other side of the bed so to speak, that someone is always listening.
Rosie cast a glance about her across the kitchen table there in the cottage outside Ipswich. It was a cabin, a rustic little getaway, a connection of her papa's that they visited occasionally, sometimes the adults without her, now and again all of them. Regardless, she'd been before and really liked it. For her tenth birthday, she had requested and been granted a long weekend there with all her favourite people. They'd made the trip by car the night before, stopping as they always did every hour or so in order that her papa could make them all get out of the car, stretch their legs.
A file folder was produced, and she took it. Somberly, the solicitor patted the paperwork. "Everything I could find. His address and contact information. I was able to locate him, as you instructed. The boy Sameer goes by Sam now. He turned ten a few weeks ago. He has a little sister, who is about five. Some photos." The solicitor knew the ice on which they were treading was thin and growing thinner, and that Laila's mother was likely going to have a difficult time with the rest of what he knew he had to disclose. "He looks happy, healthy. He's thriving there. He goes to school, some activities. Excellent grades. A very talented football player. Fast runner."
Sameer's already big eyes went absolutely huge, and his smile was not far behind as the news finally sunk in. "I get to do that again? For real?"
"Wow, we've just about got it. Your skin is sensitive, and very very prone to a good bond. Not everyone’s skin sticks like this. Lucky for them I guess." John works slowly, carefully, being attentive to not exposing Sherlock's skin to more chemicals than necessary. When almost all of the residue is gone, he daubs a few more times to remove the last traces, and then secures mild soap and water to finish cleansing and then rinsing. "Had I known, we would have done that before your shower."
"Don't jump off the roof. Don't jump. Please. We just want to get you some help, get you down safely --"
There was something of a glare. "That's not your style. You jump in, both feet. You shoot the cabbie first. You ... react."
"It's to protect your teeth, that's all." John moved one hand from where Sherlock's rested so that he rubbed lightly along his forearm, hoping it would be distracting. Or comforting. Or anything at all that would work. "And they have to get it in so they can give you more medicine. Too late and your jaw sometimes clenches." He watched the swirl of white medication mix within the IV tubing. "He's giving you more now, I see, so take a deep breath and in a moment, we'll have you open your mouth while you finish going to sleep."
Blue irises looked back at him, lids slowly opening to half mast, the fog as obvious as any thick, humid day in the city. Blink, blink. His brow furrowed in confusion before everything relaxed again as he fell back to sleep mid-thought.
Mycroft followed the direction of the driver's gaze, seeing a man leaning against a storefront, shuffling. Initially he dismissed it - too haggard, too thin, far too old to be ...  For gods sake the man wasn't even wearing shoes. And then the figure turned and immediately he recognised the profile.
, with two mouths smirking. The connection between them, the way their eyes had stayed on each other, along with the awareness of the smile, the openness, the crack in the wall of their reality.
By the time the toilet flushes, the water runs, there is the sound of oral care, Sherlock shuffles back to the bed a little more slowly, his equipment, the foot pumps are all connected, John opts to visit the bathroom, brush his teeth as well. They settle back under the blankets, close as they'd been. They restart the movie, and the room is bathed with the faint laptop glow. Sherlock slides his pillow a bit closer to John's shoulder, then nearly abandons it altogether, and their fingers find each other, meeting in the middle, tentative and curious at first, then there is warmth and strength as they twine and settle. Neither one of them is awake when the movie comes to an end.
"My grandson's about your age, I think. You're about, what six? Seven?" Sameer didn't answer that at all, so the guard continued. "His name is Philip. What's your name?"
John was waiting for him, staring back at him, his full attention riveted on the man in the bed. Sherlock was silent, as if expecting John to confront him.
He dims the classroom light and returns to the podium. "Okay then. Placing the magnet, sprinkling the metal. There's our pattern, the image, the forces at work. I'm just going to set this aside, here's the metal shavings first, equal amounts. Now the identical magnet placed on top." The magnetic poles pull and align some of the metal fragments, moving some areas closer, farther, the arching around each side and both ends in an orderly design. He angles the camera so the students can view the findings laterally, to see the sections of magnet that have stood some of the fragments so that they are standing upright, defying gravity, whisker-like.
"Obvious?" Molly is downright worrying, but gets a bit distracted, lifting Rosie to the sink to help her wash her face and hands.
The man's chin lifted, and Mycroft could see that he wasn't well, that he was shaky, pale, and jittery. "If the price is right, I can maybe find him for you."
As always, please let me know (gently) if you find a typo or something is unclear. I'm not always a fan of writing in present tense but this piece has smiled, flipped up its collar, and imperiously resisted any other tense.
Sherlock's teeth worry at his lower lip and he scowls just a little at the building. "It might need a new roof soon."
"And waste a perfectly good bathroom that is conveniently located a few feet from your bedroom? Perish the thought."
John filed the football papers and photos in one of the desk drawers before returning to the stack.  A few papers further down in the pile, and John came to his and Sherlock's marriage certificate. They had briefly discussed civil partnership instead, but opted for the marriage option - mostly because John had every inclination of standing up in front of their small group of friends and family, exchanging vows, and speaking the words he'd always wanted to. Mycroft agreed that it was the better option, but he didn't tell them that until after it was done, for which, just given Sherlock's oppositional nature to his brother's very existence (let alone his opinion), John was extremely grateful. All it would have taken to throw a halt to the proceeding was for Sherlock to hear ahead of time, that Mycroft actually approved.
His food was certainly invaded from time to time, morsels stolen from his plate, leftovers that he'd coveted and labeled
Sherlock's breath is hot against John's back, and he sighs. The rest of the night, slumber is sweet.
Sherlock's mind engaged immediately. Even upon being awakened (rudely), he could still fire off insults at his sibling with very little effort. "Missing out on what having a normal sibling might have been like. Must you, at this godawful hour?" In the pause, Sherlock waited only a second. "I think there's an all night bakery across from Victoria Station.”
A shorter one, but I wanted a bit of tenderness for these guys and for Molly. I hope I have done it justice.
"Exorbitant." Before John could comment further on that, Sherlock was speaking again. "And yes, managed to sneak another of Mycroft's credit card numbers."
"Let's wait and see how --" John stopped speaking when there was a sudden flail within the bed and Sherlock tugged at the sheet and blanket hard, flinging it up over his head and just staying there. John tried very hard to keep the chuckle from his voice but knew it was evident in the tone. "Let me ask, did you learn that from Rosie? Because that's exactly what I used to get from her when she didn't want to hear something." The lump under the covers sighed and movement at the top of the bed indicated that Sherlock had indeed turned his head as far as he could in the direction away from John. He left out the fact that Rosie had long ago outgrown that particular childish tantrum. "One thing at a time. I know you don't want to hear it."
Shortly before midnight, Sherlock's mentation seems to clear and he finally recalls that it is Tuesday. When he is awake, he is a little more conversant, less forgetful, and even manages to ask who was home with Rosie. Rob and Kathy, Dr. Nguyen, come back in the room together, give and get an update, and encourage Sherlock to settle in for the night. John and Rob end up getting Sherlock comfortable, positioned finally fairly far over on his side, and John thinks that perhaps, he will get a little bit more sleep at home. He is a little uneasy leaving, but after a while he is watching Sherlock's closed eyelids mostly, and he is extremely confident in the nursing and medical care, that he feels he can leave the building without much worry. Both Rob and Kathy encourage it, and John stands at the bedside, torn. His breathing is much improved. His vital signs are relatively stable at the moment. They are all trying not to disturb him if he is resting. They haven't really talked much yet, and John is loath to leave. The deciding factor is Sherlock himself, who reaches for John's hand once it is only the two of them in the room.
Carrie's words were calm, quiet, and still a little apologetic, but all of them knew that John opening the door, giving permission, had started it and they listened quietly as the tale continued. "The bitch of it all, she couldn't be with him. So I held the phone out for her to say ..." Her voice broke, and in the space, Rosie found John's spoon, tapped it twice on the table and then flung it, and Carrie nearly bobbled her coffee as she made a mid-air snatch as it launched off the edge. The action allowed her a moment to catch her breath and calm herself. "... to say goodbye. But it was me holding his hand, not her." She didn't describe the actual terminal extubation or the sedation she'd given, the tubes she'd removed to allow him a more natural, peaceful drifting off.
The reflex, the way John has reached out, taken hold of Sherlock, was almost subconscious. He works hard not to pull his hand away.
The oxygen level drops a bit more, and he feels Dr. Nguyen's hand on his arm. "His ABG is back, and he's working harder. He needs to be intubated. It'll let him rest, take over the breathing for a little." Although he wouldn't have challenged her on it, because he can see that Sherlock's work of breathing is not improving, nor is his oxygen level. This effort can't be sustained long term, and she holds out the printout so he can see for himself. For all the values being slightly abnormal, it is the arterial oxygen level that is the most abnormal, quite low, an indication that they can wait no longer.
John desperately wants to stay in the room, to watch, to be close if Sherlock needs anything, and the thought of leaving, of missing something, of being needed and not being there, is ... well ... sobering at the least. The sentiment must be plain on his face, because before he can even whisper 'no thanks' the doctor pats his arm gently, "It's fine if you stay, too. We'll get you a chair, one more comfortable than that." She indicates the folding one, low-backed, that is tucked into the corner.
tells you to do," Mycroft says with quite the veiled inference in his words. He looks pointedly, specifically, almost fiercely at John, but underneath that is some pleading. John lets his smile twitch briefly enough, to reassure, to convey trust.
of you. That's definitely taking it one day at a time, wouldn't want to inconvenience you or anything --" Annoyed, Sherlock glared as he spoke, but there was not a lot of venom in his words.
There is a chuckle as John tilts his head to consider the close intimacy of their positions, and both of them turn to consider the sepia image of the video baby monitor across from the bed. "I don't suppose Rosie will miss your presence upstairs."
"I'm counting on it." An idea began to grow in the back of his mind, and as the driver pulled away, he changed his mind about going back to the office just yet. "We're running an errand first."
He disconnected the line, forced a goofy smile at Rosie, who grinned back and flashed all her teeth at him, and pressed another button on his mobile.
They discuss the weather and the food and the rest of the day. They discuss the fact that they chose this day to be solely for them and that their family and friends may be less than thrilled. Sherlock reminds John that this was the only gift he wanted - to do this without fanfare and to focus on just the two of them. The conversation comes full circle back to the year they've had, the journey, the difficult phases since they'd become friends, the scare of something happening - of worse things nearly happening. It is poignant and refreshing and ends very hopeful: that no matter the journey ahead, they would not walk it alone.
Greg cannot hide the sparkle, the interest, the passion for the opportunity, that flared in his expression as he pocketed the card.
Sam nodded, his eyes moist. He blinked quickly, and then looked up to find John's. "Are you going to send me back because I got in trouble at school?"
He'd known all along, despite Rosie's words and Sherlock's assurances, that the care and keeping of the dog would most certainly fall to him.
"I'm Dr. Steinberg. Dean. Vascular surgery. You know, it's funny, I thought I recognised your name. I think we might've been in med school together. You were a few years ahead, I scrubbed under you when you were chief surgical resident at Barts?"
"And I said bed." He feels like he is dealing with Rosie at her worst and is grateful that for now anyway, Rosie is only a fraction of Sherlock's weight and can be picked up and relocated when necessary. And she is still occasionally motivated by the smallest amount of fear or parental respect. "You can visit the loo on the way by. Do your teeth. Pee. Whatever you want to do with your hair." Although Sherlock's eyes stay closed, John can tell that he is listening. "You know, like brush it or something."
"Let's get your milk and a book and your blanket," he murmured to Rosie. "And we'll go snuggle on the couch." The cries drifted down briefly by only a decibel or two, and John found it sweet that she was trying, attempting to regain control, wanting his comfort and his focus. Her hands, arms, legs clung, fingers nearly pinching his skin a little in their desperation.
The physician smiles just a little, understanding John's tactful question. "We know about his remote history, if that's a concern."
Sherlock's feet had already propelled him out of bed, toward his clothes, and there were trousers and a shirt donned without consciously deciding, the mobile on speaker so Sherlock could fire off the opening words of a question only for Mycroft only to shush him. "I don't know much more than that. We'll talk later, but Sameer is all right for now. He and Dr. Watson are together. And safe."
"Long as it's okay with you." Sherlock looks away as if he is embarrassed. John feels that too, opts to be the instigator. "I would feel better. Much better." The awkwardness is ... disconcerting. "At least for a little ..."
His pyjamas donned, he wandered from the bathroom to be met with Rosie, rushing to get to him, tripping over her own feet - growing again, he knew - and falling forward in her haste and excitement to see him. Her hands barely came up in time to prevent a split lip. Again.
Sherlock's chin rises, his brow furrows in contemplation, there is a single nod, and John can tell he is pleased with the analogy, that it has calmed his worries at least a little.
"Be careful next time you refuse to help, refuse to get involved, and leave a decision to me." John looked over, where both Sam and Rosie were in the middle of a litter of adoptable puppies who were licking, climbing, wagging, and stepping all over both of them. Both kids were giggling, the gut-bubbling, belly laughing variety, and it was downright adorable, amazing, the joy that was radiating between children and dogs, dogs and children. "Well, Sherlock. I did, in fact, as instructed, make a decision."
It is not pulsatile like a pseudoaneurysm, John thinks, though he can't be entirely sure at this point. Not yet. John wonders at the seriousness, the risk of retroperitoneal haematoma, where the bleeding is even worse on the inside and harder to tell. "Back pain?" he asks.
"Sherlock," he murmurs once, then louder, tapping just slightly on his arm. "Hey, gonna run home for a bit. Rosie's fallen, needs me there."
"I'll see you in the morning." The rest of the evening had passed rather uneventfully albeit a little subdued.
John tries to close his eyes there in the room after the echo, which Dr. Nguyen - Kathy - has read as RV strain and mildly reduced ejection fraction. Sherlock was a little more awake and John was working hard at updating him, keeping conversation to a minimum, assuring him that he'll be getting some relief soon. "So the plan," the intensivist, Dr. Nguyen, explains to John who is listening and Sherlock who is not exactly paying attention to anything but his discomfort and his breathing, "is to let these meds get in, infuse the clot, dissolve it, restore blood flow. IR will take another look at him later tomorrow. Or today, later this morning." She shakes her head at herself. "Bloody night shift. Despite his risk factors for clot, the travel, the recent nicotine, primarily, I'm going to bring in a haematologist in the morning. We could be looking at platelet dysfunction or something intrinsic that is contributing here."
"While the movie is paused, I need ..." Sherlock begins, and it takes them a few minutes to remove and unbuckle what they can, and to unplug the IV pump from the wall so that he can push it into the bathroom.
"I want to go home." His words come hard and are far more emotional than he would have liked. More emotion than he ever showed anyone. But the man on his knees needn't have bothered. And needn't have worried. He is speaking to an empty room.
But, the address must've been bad, and in the settling dusk, John couldn’t locate the house. His GPS was simply circling, and there were no house numbers along the stretch of road. John was ready to ring his supervisor and just about to turn around when he spotted a nearly hidden driveway, a space in which a small lane wound in and between some carefully manicured hedges. John nosed the small company owned car into the lane, found a long drive that managed to eventually deliver him to a small estate, several outbuildings, a car park, and a very expensive looking home.
Tea was a special thing for John, or it used to be. He still couldn't abide generic or cheap tea, choosing his favourite blends and making sure he didn't run out. Along with milk and a touch of sugar, tea used to be a very comforting beverage, an association, a reminder of better times, an echo of what used to be actually enjoyable when consumed with family or friends or comrades in the army. It wasn't as good in his hand as it was in his mind, but still, on some level, it attempted to reach down and ... stir something inside, and so he kept up with it.
John returns in four, and Sherlock has already levered himself out of the shower and is clumsily wrapped in a couple of towels, having apparently run out of steam, and he looks positively out of gas and lacking any further motivation. With serious eyes watching intently, John finds himself feeling grateful that Sherlock didn't fall over.
"I don't." It was only a few seconds, but once John held the candle, he could see that the splintered branch wasn't terribly huge but given the angle it was embedded deeply within Sherlock's leg, whether or not the artery was involved was the bigger question. "This might need to come out in a surgery suite."
He thought about clarifying that although he had indeed worked hard, carrying significant burdens of patient care and decisions in a time when there really weren't proven correct patient care paths, he understood that the nurses carried more of the emotional toll - longer times in rooms, more conversations with patients, families, providers, and had taken some of the losses personally. Loss came in so many forms: patients, fellow staff, family members, freedom, security, or socialisation.
Sherlock was definitely resting deeper than he had been, but upon hearing the get started phrase, he opened his eyes again and reached his hand up toward his face. When John held it fast, he tried to tongue out the bite block. Leaning forward so that he was directly in Sherlock's line of vision, John brought his hand to Sherlock's shoulder. "No, you're okay. Leave that in. Eyes closed again. Deep breath, in through your nose. You're almost there." His eyes drifted to half mast but didn't close. "Little nystagmus."
"He's all right?" John asked as he followed her into the department. They went through the holding area toward one of the procedure rooms. John saw some observation windows, a lot of equipment, other staff and patients in various stages of procedures. He wondered if he should have alerted Mycroft about this, feeling his own pulse hammering in his chest. Absurdly, he thought about the irony of having heart troubles of his own right here in the cath lab area of the hospital. "What's happened?"
"No, I mean, unless you want to." They had both been quietly aware that the current situation, the stress of the unknown, didn't exactly put either of them in the mood. It was very mutual, and perfectly okay. Bedtime cuddles were usually a bit tentative, very low key, no expectations - somehow they both just knew and were fine with it, this season, and like the virus, it was not forever. "No, just, for bed. You know, relax together, safe under the covers."
Faintly, John pressed in closer, narrowing the distance, and with little pre-amble and without faffing about, he touched his lips simply against Sherlock's. It was warm, and gentle, tinged with the faint exhalations and muscles moving to broaden their contact. Lips on lips, the lightest touch becoming stronger, chemistry building between them, the connection and intensity of the moment. Inhaling, their attention focused totally on each other, their bodies connecting at other points - Sherlock's hand on John's face, John's palm on Sherlock's leg, their chests angling though not touching. John deepened the kiss, his lips parting just enough for Sherlock's to do the same, the faintest awareness of the kiss, their first, the innocence and newness of it, of tasting, of the sweetness of attraction, of pleasure, of
"Any number of us could stand here tonight, we all have our stories. And we have all been traumatised in some ways, to some degree. As some of you, I served in Afghanistan and there have been comparisons. This is different. This has been our own trauma - longer, drawn out, more horrible on many facets. We have been through a trying time. And it still hurts." He looks about the room, sensing the truth reverberating among them. "It's raw." A few heads nod in response. "So, for starters," he begins without the expected ice-breaker, the hook of how he would normally have begun any sort of moment like this, "take a deep breath. Feel the air, the lifegiving oxygen, the lung expansion." He demonstrates, low keyed and calm as he breathes out. "Good. Now, again, and ... exhale."
"Oh, I know." His smile was indeed genuine and relaxed. "Just thinking, this was fun. I'm glad we included her."
Mycroft interrupts, and the quickness, the sharp reply accompanies Mycroft folding his arms in front of him. "I will grant you that the pyjamas are far more
"Obviously." With a confident lurch, John's hands and arms guided Sherlock's body as they rolled together. John leaned into the mattress as Sherlock's upper torso rested overtop him, up on his elbows. Their breath intermingled. "Like the skull." The words were quietly spoken, but as he'd hoped, ended with a chuckle from Sherlock.
"I don't have a mum. She died." There was a rapid blinking, a faint twitch of a mouth trying not to cry.
Discharging a patient out of the hospital was much different than it used to be, when it was handing papers back and forth, signing here and there, pointing, sharing a biro. Now it was usually giving discharge instructions by phone, speaker phone in the room on occasion, sometimes over video calling, with a family member or caregiver. It involved coordination of when the patient's ride was coming or whomever was able to drive over to pick them up and a limited contact exchange at the doors of the hospital. It was often an ambulance to another facility and involved oxygen and transfer devices.
A TEE is a trans-esophageal echocardiogram, and I guess in the UK this is a TOE? Anyway, the procedure is the same, an ultrasound probe on an endoscope that does, as one of the characters says, get a front row seat to some parts of the heart that are more difficult to see using a TTE (trans-thoracic echo). That pesky left atrial appendage, for sure. And while a bubble study can be done with regular echo, in this case, the providers wanted to check out the entire thing in this manner.
"Lydia, the au pair is coming too. If it's too much, they'll take off." John brushes his hand along Sherlock's arm. "She's going to be glad to see you, but ..."
Now, seems like there's something we should discuss, unless you want to carry on this conversation via your not-exactly-secure, poorly-password-protected blog.  SH
He steps to Sherlock's side and peers down at him. It is uncomfortable to really look, tubes and lines, tape on his face, and the way he is artificially sleeping. But he knows it is his time to be strong for them both, so he brushes at his fringe, speaks low. "You're okay. Just rest if you can. Things are going all right. We're all keeping a close eye on you." He can feel his heart pounding, tries to settle himself. "I'll be close by, and I'll come back --" John wants to finish the phrase with a promise that it'll be only a few minutes. "Soon. Soon as I can." The lie comes out oddly, but John knows that with the sedation and other pain medications, time passes very differently for Sherlock, and that he won't specifically realise it.
"If you're going to continue to be annoying and make unacceptable noises, please remove yourself while I attempt to enjoy this." Clearly, Sherlock was undecided on what he wanted to do - stay and annoy Mycroft or go find something else to occupy himself. "Though, on a more serious note," Mycroft began as he picked up a fork, "it is strangely good to have you here. And I'm glad you're doing well."
There are some holes here. Please squint. Thanks for reading. And as always, please let me know gently if there's something awry - I had an issue with John's torch in this chapter but I chased it down - I think.  ;-)
"Shut up. And listen. If something happens, more clot, more places, if it comes to it, I do not want ..." His breathing becomes even more laboured and his exhales are now sharper, through pursed lips in order to appease his air hunger a little bit.
A hoarse, sleepy chuckle sounded then as Sherlock laid back down and stretched out long, long, long, under the covers. "John."
"Are you aware," John says with a little more force, quickly, speaking over the few times that Sherlock continues to try to interrupt him, "that people can get into serious trouble with this. I know you're not interested in what I have to say, but listen to me: there are things we can try, or that you can do, to help. It doesn't mean that anything necessarily ...
"Please." John raises up on his toes just a little, finding his legs to be sure and confident, his posture strong and upright. The stoop is gone. Their lips come together, the sweetness of their relationship, their affection, their years of intimacy. Although the kiss is brief, it lasts long enough for their bodies to come in contact, for John's hand to steal into Sherlock's curls, for Sherlock to pull them close from the small of John's back. Although time has elapsed since their last shared kiss, the touch, the scent, the taste is as familiar as can be.
Chagrined, John shook his head. "Of course you're going. You have to. You said you would." He was still offering an occasional assurance - trying to convince whom, he wasn't sure - as he led the way down the hallway, preceding him into the bedroom, knowing he'd follow. "Which suitcase?"
In return, he gets several things:  a photo of Rosie bundled in a towel, grinning, her cheeks flushed and happy, her wisps of hair tousled.
He turned, getting a feel for the house.  He would, apparently, be spending the next several nights there, and stood a moment, puzzled at something.
We had other things in common too, like learning critical thinking and creative insight, attention to detail. Or what I like to consider that would be how to commit a crime and get away with it. Of visitors in the flat at odd hours. Of not knowing much of what it was like to visit an actual doctor's office, when we had a live-in one. Well, except for that appendectomy, right Sam? We had an honourary grandmama living downstairs, who loved us both with everything she had. And still does. Mrs. Hudson, I heard a rumour that you were going to share that secret family recipe for your ginger biscuits with Sam and Christine as a wedding gift, no? I think they're entitled. And by the way, thanks for all those times you would let us in when we forgot our keys. And for all those times you caught us doing all of those ... oh wait a minute, those stories
Some other random things about this adventure. Finding out that my arm cast is blue because Sherlock picked it out.
Later, after they'd eventually tucked themselves into bed, John wondered at the potential benefit of this particular evening. He knew that although the specific incident, of Rosie testing the boundaries of touching the microscope, would probably be forgotten, hopefully Rosie would learn to follow directions from the beginning and not challenge them in the future.
"Yes, but --" And the argument dies a premature death and Sherlock's frustration builds again. "John!" Sherlock's fingers drum out a quick rhythm, a chaotic beat, evidence that he's nearly climbing out of his skin.
"I don't kick." Short minutes later, they were awkwardly standing at Sherlock's bedroom doorway, pyjamas on, teeth brushed along with other necessities, and John hesitated again. "Are you sure?"
John tries to keep his runaway fears in check. "Not good." He gestures at his mobile, gives her a sign with a finger that he hopes means to give him a few minutes. Clearing his throat, he unplugs his mobile, presses a few buttons. "Is Dawn available? John Watson, looking for an update on her patient, Holmes?" There is a pause, a few moments of listening, and John nods somberly. "Okay. Thanks. I'm reachable, if you need ..." He lowers the phone, meets Molly's eyes. The update is choppy, abridged, and sufficient. "Massive PE, hypoxic, confused. Alteplase via groin line. Then threw a clot to his left arm. Blood gas was critical, he needed intubation. Had brachial artery clot retrieval, angioplasty, and stent. Still vented on diprivan. Art line's in." He leans back, hearing the unbelievability of the update, and sets his mobile aside. "No change since I left. Sedated. His nurse was in the room with him, couldn't come to the phone."
"First, reach out to two other people. Family, friend, whomever. Don't share anything more than what you're comfortable, but see if you can schedule a quick, casual, meet up. Coffee, lunch, whatever." Glancing at him until he nodded, she then held her pencil over his open file. "So, who are you going to call?"
Footsteps were returning; Sherlock's eyes drifted closed. He followed the sensory input, the stimulation, acutely aware of his arm position, the proprioception of his legs. It was
His service weapon was across the room in the drawer. It might as well have had a strong magnetic pull on him. And he might as well have been wearing a suit of armour, the attraction was that strong.
The nurse continued, "And your heparin is going to stay at the current rate until you head over. The lab value was within range."
"Fine. But if you want to fully embrace that, we should probably get going. Take advantage and not waste any time." John slid behind the wheel, waited until both seat-belts were fastened. "So," he smiled as he manoeuvred into traffic, "perhaps while we drive you can think of all the things we can't do at home, with the kids around, that maybe we could capitalise on now. Perhaps you can make a list."
"Listen, just because previously you had very vocal partners does not necessarily mean they were enjoying it."
The inhaling he was next aware of was quite different - pain, smells, a high level of background noise, people talking, moving, the sensation of nausea. There was something over his face and he experienced quite a bit of confusion until he recalled the burst of gunfire catching them all, he and his unit, unawares. The acrid, chemical plastic smell was unpleasant and he heard a groan that echoed back in his ears as he turned his head to escape it. When he was unable, he tried to reach up with his dominant hand only to find it was not only exquisitely painful but anchored across his waist, preventing all movement.
He relishes the notion that he is no longer dealing with the anxiety of Sherlock being out of his sight, concerned at the idea that something would happen. It had been a gradual relaxing, an abatement of fear that happened in waves, a little better one day, plateau, another day where he needed to reach out, text or call. But, thankfully, it is quite well managed now. He works full shifts, and has for a long time, and both of them are a little sensitive, a little more sensitive, toward the needs of the other.
John awakens when the door opens, more from the atmospheric change than the noise, the sensation of air movement, and initially has no idea what time it is. There is faint, early dawn light just beginning, barely coming in through the window, and Sherlock is still sound asleep, his face relaxed, the oxygen still in. His long eyelashes drape down toward his cheeks, his fringe still much fluffier than it has been previously, clean and washed but without his usual product that tames the curl, the wildness. His mouth is slightly open, just the faintest little bit, and his chest rises and falls comfortably. Now and again, the IV pump with its protective medication, makes a gentle, motorised pulsating noise, its usually silent function just faintly audible in the absolute stillness of the room. Another blanket has been spread over the two of them and the laptop screen is completely dark. Both of their mobiles lie on the table, the empty beer bottles absent.
Sherlock sighed as he headed back to a less commercial part of town, setting his bloody brother's office behind him. He would go find some familiar faces, hopefully a place to crash. He did not see the curtains move back as Mycroft stood waiting, watching, hoping that this glimpse of his brother's back was not going to be his last.
The nurse blinked and then chuckled at the unexpected humour, the reference to movie classic Princess Bride, chuckling as she reiterated the actual contents. Sherlock still looked a bit skeptical, but he swallowed both, then made a grimace of a face. "This water tastes terrible."
From the foot of the bed, where Jack has returned, come the words, "Ask him to pick his head forward, up off the pillow."
"Looks like you could use more than a few, if you don't mind my saying so." Lydia smiles. "Your daughter is doing well. Minimal meltdowns for her age, all very quickly resolved. Normal stuff. I'm having a good time with her." Though John has no way of knowing for sure, he doubts she would have said that if it weren't true, and it is touching.
think it makes me look distinguished." He raised a suddenly interested and charming brow, his crooked smile engaging his whole face, then punctuated it with a wink.
John doesn't necessarily disagree and mentally compares them to chemotherapeutic agents, which are even closer to poison. "It's all benefit risk assessment. Do the benefits outweigh the risks?"
"Yes, I'm sure, I want to ... let me ..." and his hand reaches in, his fingers closing around John's length, and there is as much rubbing as two men can manage while laying as they are, Sherlock's hand and his pelvis, met by John's back and his own hips, pressing and rubbing and stroking, his hand along Sherlock's hip, guiding and urging and as the tension builds between them, so does the intensity of their movements. John twists his head, his mouth coming back to make contact with Sherlock's face. There is not enough breathing nor enough room for much more than kissing, and John manages to notice that Sherlock seems fine, breathing as expected and not wheezing or panting out of character for their activities.
Football quickly became a passion. He carried a ball to school with him when he could, and on nights when there wasn't practice, or when it wasn't raining, he almost always asked to go out and kick the ball around, or for a partner to keep practicing John's least favourite, headache-inducing skill - heading the ball - with whomever would accompany him. He hung his football kit on a hanger in his closet.
On silent feet, Sherlock stepped into the room a little farther, seeing them resting, the two of them close in the small hospital bed. John was on his back, the faint light from the bedside heart monitor casting a dim shadow over one side of his face. Even in the almost darkness, Sherlock could see that John was haggard, his skin turgor poor, bags under his eyes, and he could tell that it had been a rough night already.
Meanwhile, out in public, the virus is a hoax and just stop paying so much attention to it, and you can't make me quarantine. It's no wonder there hasn't been a healthcare provider taking drastic measures against the rampant idiocy. It's why mostly none of us watch the news, have sworn off social media, and on so many levels, being at work (distracted and busy) is easier than being home (worrying and trying to act normal).
John stopped his words mid-sentence, giving Sameer his full attention then cutting his gaze over to watch the teacher interact with another child. He tried considering this afresh, to imagine this, imagine her, as if he were Sameer. She was affectionate, warm, smiling, and oh, so sincere. And although John hugged or held Sameer, or sat with him during activities, occasionally holding him on his lap when they watched the telly, John was not at all like this teacher. He was muscle and angles compared to Rosie's group leader, who was soft, and curvy, and cuddly.
Out of I see you. No I see you. Oh for gods sake I'm not trying to fix that. My new room is quieter. Chest tube is out broken ribs are still a bitch. They brought Rosie in I guess it was yesterday and it was a disaster. Absolute bloody nightmare. She hates me because I deserted her and I don't blame her and this is what I get for all my misdeeds and for disappointing everyone in my entire life and for bad choices and for the accident and being selfish by coming here in the first place. For losing her mother. Abandonment. For hurting people and I'm not elaborating more about that. I asked for medication for pain and to sleep and it isn't working and I suppose I deserve that too.
doing here?" He stood imperiously, unmoving, a human barricade in his front door. "I distinctly remember not including ... it when we spoke."
Sherlock's eyes crinkle just slightly, a small snort of laughter, of openness. "Please, yes. First implies that more will follow."
"I was on scene, and they'd forwarded the texts. Your name came through." There was a moment of appreciation as Greg complimented him. "Nice job, by the way."
Sometimes it was quite blunt:  he overdosed again. Or, he overdosed, we reversed him, and he's already bolted before we could stop him.
John settles onto the small, two-seated couch tucked in a nearby alcove at the end of the hall, trying to decide how long to wait, how long to linger in the building before actually heading home. He can see into the corridor, and a few minutes later, predictably, he sees the call light over Sherlock's door go on. A nurse enters and comes back out after a few minutes, closing the door behind her. By this point, John is standing in the hallway, and she catches sight of him. With her fingers, she gestures under her nose and then over her ears - replaced the oxygen, she tells him by charades - and she gives an 'okay' sign, her expression pleasant.
"Of course." The other physician smiled, genuinely pleased with their meeting. "I'm glad you're willing to give this a go. With your experience, and your background, I'd been afraid you might find this a little, I don't know, too mundane. Too boring."
"Oh, this has been awesome!" Rosie crooned, holding the mobile as she wrote her name in multiple colours inside the journal while wearing the new jewellery. "But you know what I'd really like for my birthday?" She hesitated, letting the adults really look at her, wondering. She could see that her
John sighed as he signed his name to the death certificate. Although death was never the desired outcome, some deaths were merciful, a blessing, an end to suffering; this was one of those, and the ending had been comfortable, swift, a painless release. He had already notified the family, advised them of the unfortunate turn of events and assured the patient's daughter that in the final moments, the family matriarch had not suffered. The daughter, a few tight words later, stifling tears, had thanked him for his care, for the notification, and John frowned a bit as he stood up, still acutely aware of the sting of loss, of finality, of ... medical failure, no matter how he looked at it. The daughter had informed him that they would be coming to the hospital shortly to collect her belongings, say their final goodbyes.
Rob has seen the activity, spies the urinal, and is ready to say something positive when John's voice cuts through the intention. "His arm is ice-cold. I think we need Dr. Nguyen."
"I'll catch up with you in the ICU a little later, then. Okay?" Dr. Benson makes sure John nods, that he is okay before leaving.
Dr. Benton - Jack, he says - stands at the bedside. The sedation is fairly low, and the official wean, the ventilator changes, hasn't even begun, and already Sherlock is restless, becoming more agitated. His heart rate climbs, and now that he is sitting with the head of the bed elevated, he is reaching for the breathing tube, first one hand and then the other. When he's not doing that, he's trying to bend forward from the waist, trying to bring the breathing tube closer to his hands.
The sigh motivates John to a complete sentence before he is verbally lambasted for his grammar. "You okay if I take off? I'd like to make it home before Rosie goes to bed, but I can ..."
2. No guests, no study groups, no meetings, no gatherings, no outsiders at all without prior written consent of homeowner. Homeowner hereby declares that no consent will ever be given and the audacity of any employee/housesitter/security service to even ask will result in immediate dismissal and forfeiture of any and all wages, expenses, and salary.
"Change my plans, in other words." They'd worked their way around the stages of grief and John realised he might be nearing that fifth stage - acceptance. "Stage five." It wasn't actually a question.
"You know, here I thought you were supposed to be a genius." Sherlock's brow raised in curiosity, and the man offered a lopsided smile. "I know who you are. Lived in this city a long time, read about your ... adventures. On Dr. Watson's blog."
"Listen. We can appropriately treat him here, keep an eye on him. Monitor the head injury. Hydrate him until the vomiting passes." Sherlock remained stonily silent at that, and he didn't care that the displeasure and willingness to bargain was evident on his expression. "Look here, Mr. Holmes. Isn't it about what's best for John?" More retching, the deep hollow kind that was followed by the sound of fluids into a basin and then suctioning again. "And I'm hoping not to put him through it, but if the meds don’t help him, he might end up needing a tube, a nasogastric tube - through the nose, into the stomach," and Sherlock was nodding and frowning at the same time at that unpleasant suggestion, "to decompress his belly and give him some relief."
He was not willing to gamble, to risk his brother's well-being. Not in the least. John was in the trenches with Sherlock, and Mycroft knew that his job was to keep him there, keep them both fighting, and do whatever he could do on every possibility, every contingency plan, from the background.
"Just suit up." Both men, breathing hard, a tense decision of 'I could beat the crap out of you' and a 'I'm not letting you win' being battled, wordless. Suddenly it seemed not the worst idea, a sweaty, exhausting, anger-releasing way to get rid of the angst, the horror, the absolute nightmare of what they did, day in and day out. "You'll feel better. And I'll let you set the pace."
It had been a long while since Sameer had asked for word clarification with her, as usually he picked up enough on the conversational nuances of the words. "Pleasure?" he repeated. "Like,
under stress - and not communication or connection. Of the two, attack is probably the more healthy option whereas retreat doesn't deal with any of the baggage, the problems, or the deep-rooted issues. It just
"You got me a scarf. I thought you liked my neck." His eyebrows waggled as he lifted his chin, both of them recalling the prior times when John nearly worshipped the area. There was a sweet half-smirk on his face until he really dug his fingers into it and realised. "God it's so soft."
" -- to be responsible. She'll reach out when she needs. If she needs." He fusses briefly with his tea. "And yes,
He hovered, biding his time in the hallway, keeping himself out of the way and out of the room for the moment, where providers in PAPRs at the head attended to the airway, glidescope in use, sedation given and paralytics to minimise coughing. One of the nurses asked if he needed anything else, for the line or his protective equipment. He did a mental check, head to toe:  bonnet over cap, faceshield, gown, double gloves, shoe covers. He smiled even from behind the mask, knowing all she could see were serious dark eyes. "Just size seven and a half gloves, thanks." He flexed his fingers. "Maybe an eight too, for the layers." Both were retrieved, set by the central line supplies, with a minimum of fuss.
Sherlock startled a little at the timbre of John's voice, that low, don't mess with me version that he pulled out from time to time. For a moment, their eye contact held, John's gaze with one brow elevated in austerity. Sherlock sighed. "You could help me."
"Then I'm glad Sam was good with this, that we didn't just meet as adults first. Who knows what you would have done if Sam weren't a factor."
"I haven't, exactly. Simulation, several times. And I'm a third-year, so I've already done a lot of surgery."
Since coming home from the hospital, Sameer had been hyper-vigilant about keeping one eye on John. On knowing what their plans were. On asking their plans, on doing his best to stay in the same room if possible. He'd even become alarmed a time or two when John had visited the bathroom and was out of his eyesight.
"Yes it is. You're going to get comfortable in recognising normal so that abnormal will absolutely feel differently."
The telepathy between twins, their connection, propensity toward another genetically similar person, non-verbal communication on a level not well understood -
"Oh?" John would have simply frowned, let his expression do the asking, but Sherlock's vision was impeded by the pinch he was still holding over the bridge of his nose. "I suppose you want to donate your brain to science?"
John found a couple of miscellaneous notecards in the stack of things to be put away, and into the bin went a random birthday card from Harry that had arrived three weeks late. He recalled the way Rosie had explained his sister to Sam, that mostly they didn't see her, but that she was family. Rosie pondered something else then, and turned her head to look at some of the photos on the wall, of Sherlock and Mycroft with their parents when they'd been young, one of John and Harry from years ago, the framed Christmas gift that Sam and Molly had put together for John.
Sherlock couldn't stop the quick burst of a laugh. "Speaking of undersized genitalia, you mean?" Sherlock nuzzled John's shoulder with his chin, then wriggled his body deeper down under the covers. "Or oversized would be more complimentary."
There is another knock at the door, and a tech enters along with a nurse close behind. "Thought we'd descend on you all at once." A little concerned at more strangers in the room, Rosie snuggles into John's neck as she watches them attend to Sherlock - obtaining vital signs, checking his oxygen level (mid nineties, so another adjustment is made to the flowmeter), and the nurse makes a few pokes at his arm in which the IV is running. "This bothering you at all?"
"Thanks, I uh... " John points his thumb over his shoulder toward where his flatmate, best friend, and, right this moment anyway, the main focus of the day, lies, "I should get back I guess."
She purses her lips. "Welcome back, Mr. Feisty, good to see you again. Clear liquids now, healthy heart diet for dinner," she says, not really even missing a beat, "provided you're not nauseous and can swallow okay. There are pain meds if you need them. Looks like the heparin will continue." She continues looking at the orders. "Clopidogrel will be once a day, to start tonight. Apixoban is twice a day, starting in the morning. These are both blood thinners, one to treat the PE and prevent another, the one starting tonight is protective of the stent, helps keep it safely open." She clicks a few more buttons, reading through what seems to John a ridiculous amount of time-wasting things to document on, read through, and verify. "Urinary catheter comes out at midnight, you'll be at some point expected to urinate by six or so tomorrow morning. And those foot pumps stay on, at least for now. Keeps blood flowing and prevents clot development."
"Good. I just ..." His smile was just short of shy as he looked into Sherlock's eyes again, knowing their history, the length of their acquaintance/friendship, and sensed a fullness as they orbited each other again, their bodies aligning to bring eager lips together once more. It as John who pulled away first. "We should ... I mean, I don't want to, but we should go slow."
John glanced at Sherlock, then at Sam. "I have a request, though." Pause, explanations in Dari. "All communication tonight is to be done through your interpreter. Sonya, I know you and Sam could easily communicate in Dari, which is fine and probably easier for you, but understand that, as his father, my job is to make sure he's safe, happy. To ... protect him." Pause again, and John watched Sam listening intently to the relaying of the messages, smiling a little at the familiar sounding language. "To do that, I want to, I
"Napping." He snickered at the memory, remembering the boredom that ofttimes grated on him. He remembered telling some of the men in his unit that sleeping was a great way to pass the time. Some of them - himself included - could sleep anywhere, anytime, almost on command.
He'd opened the next book in her nightly repertoire, that of Good Night Gorilla, before she finally reached for her sippy cup of milk.
"No you're not." He looks back at the movie. Another action film that they'd watched a long time ago that was passably good. Enjoyable even. "Bloody rule follower."
John does, and so does Sherlock, following the directions. His eyes are open again, his focus still somewhat blurred, but he continues to seek and find John and then keeps his gaze there.
Sherlock hadn't listened to any of these, hadn't responded to any of the admissions, the rehabs, the conversations.
"No, I have no issue with it. And absolutely it's a wise medical decision." He pinched the bridge of his nose, brushed at his face, and sighed. "Look, if you're expecting me to give you all sorts of praise or hand-holding for doing the right thing, I have to tell you, that's not really my style." He hoped his expression was encouraging. "But I'll be there if that's what you want. And I'll make sure it all goes smoothly."
Sherlock is glaring, and John waits for a moment, listening to what he is really saying. He hopes his face isn't glaring back, although part of him would like to.
"Nothing recent." John feels a lot of things welling up, squelches down the defensiveness. "That I know of."
"We'll see," John said, as noncommittally as he could. "But I guess you should think about brushing up on your Dari."
"Piss off," the man breathed back at him, and at that phrase that Sameer had heard a few times since coming to London, the boy's head raised and his eyes lit up a little. Noticing that, the guard chuckled. "Oh, you like me getting into a bit of trouble, do you?" Shaking his head with another sigh of amusement, he said, "Come on then. I'm to deliver you to the nurse who's with your papa. They're waiting on us."
