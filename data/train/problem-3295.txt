Isn't this a good trip down memory lane?
And Charlie had her suspicions that something was up. She just didn't push it, knowing that she would be told in time. Besides, she had only met these kids a few months ago.
The Winchester nodded. "Lead the way."
Ellen led the two professors to the living room where the four boys, Bobby and Lupin already were. In the corner of the living room, there was a brightly lit Christmas tree. The tree sat right next to the burning fire place that gave off a nice heat.
When he walked in the room, both Adam and Benny stared at him. Cas' face was already starting to heat up.
Castiel rolled his shoulders while he walked. He looked around, trying to see if anyone had noticed if he was uncomfortable. No one seemed to notice.
"Novak!" Madam Hooch called from across the field. The Quidditch coach stood with Professor Donna Hanscum, the Head of Hufflepuff and the Wizard Art Teacher.  "Come over here!"
Gabriel Novak - Young Richard Speight Jr. because no one can play Gabe the way Speight does and I also couldn’t find anyone who would fit. (Couldn’t find a picture either- sorry)
Cas nods, "yes, ma'am, a few. But our friend group is mostly a mixture of houses. And years, to be honest. There's Meg Masters and her Slytherin best friend Mazikeen Smith. Maze is a second year, Meg is a first year Slytherin. Dean and I met her on the train. There's Charlie Bradbury, who is also a first year Hufflepuff. We met her on the train as well. And then there's Chloe Decker, who is a first year Gryffindor. And then there is Lucifer Morningstar, a third year Gryffindor. Actually, my brother who is a third year Slytherin and also named Lucifer, says that Lucifer Morningstar is his sworn enemy, but Morningstar claims he has no quarrel with my brother."
Cas takes the thing from Lupin and unfolds it. Cas looks at it for a moment before looking over at Lupin and thanks him. The cursed deva slips on the trenchcoat that Lupin had just given him. And it fit, covering up his wings, without it being too painful.
The storytelling was interrupting when there came a knock at the front door. Everyone exchanged looks, as no one else was expected to arrive. Bobby stood up and went over to the door, glancing back at his guests quickly before opening the door.
"I don't usually do this, you know," Dean says, looking right at the angel in front of him. "Ask people out like this, that is. Usually it's right back to my place and then the next morning, it's done and I never see them again. But now that I have a chance to stay some place a little longer than usual, I want to try it out."
Meanwhile, Sam spoke to Gabriel about showing the Novak some things in his room. Gabriel was all for it. The Novak liked Sam.
With no idea if whatever Freyja did worked or not, Dean and Castiel went back to the motel room to join back with Sam.
There was a moment where the group of friends took in the sight of all the enchanted decorations. The fake bats had been turned real and were now flying around near the top of the ceiling, though not going close to any students or teachers below. The group found their usual seats at the Gryffindor table and sat down.
“On the subject of your parents, the holiday break is like two months away. I was wondering if maybe you would want to come over to my house for that time? You have a brother who is Sammy’s age, maybe you could bring him too so Sam could have someone he knows when he goes to Hogwarts? I know it’s a while away, but it’s just a suggestion.” Dean suggests this to Cas.
"Really?" Sam asks from his seat, amazed.
Dean forced himself out of the warm, comfortable bed and got dressed into the Hogwarts school uniform. Dean's school uniform consists of a black robe with the Gryffindor crest on it, a grey sweater, some black pants, as well as a red and yellow striped tie.
Demons partnered up with angels,
"What? He did that all the time to us when we were kids, can't I do it back? Besides, what's he going to do about it? Tell Jack? Kill me? I'm already dead!"
Meg had gotten over Castiel a long time back. She was, honestly, kind of used to the rejection from other males who did not find themselves in any way attracted to Meg. And she was fine with it. Didn't take it personally or anything. In fact, she was even glad that she still got the chance to become friends with Castiel. He's a nice kid. And you know? He deserves someone who will treat him nicely, god damn it.
"Sure thing." Dean let Cas lead him away from the costume party. Cas led him to an empty classroom, Dean followed him a bit concerned and almost worried about what Cas wanted to talk about. "Cas?" Dean looks at his friend, ready to hear what he has to say.
Although Sirius joked, he did care about Remus and he was genuinely curious about the scars on his best friend’s face.
Dean gives a nod of understanding. Taking a step towards the two brothers, Cas reaches up and places two fingers on their foreheads. A bright light swallows the trio. When the light fades, Dean and Cas stand in the middle of the Men of Letters Bunker.
Before long, dinner is ready. It was a simple meal. Pasta with the option of adding sauce and meatballs. It was simple and super delicious.
“Goodnight, Cas,” Dean responded but Castiel was already asleep. Dean followed shortly after him.
Charlie sat up tall in her sleeping bag. Her arms (that were not in the sleeping bag) flicked, like the way one would do if they thought they were about to do something funny.
"Good to meet you. How long are planning on staying around?" Meg asks them.
"Right. Well, I want all of you to take out your books and start reading the first two chapters. It's okay if you don't finish, it won't be for homework. You don't have any homework from me today. I will be in my office if any of you need me." Lupin left the room to go to his office.
Only for her to be taken away from my dad
"So let's go." Dean gives a shrug. "I mean, if there's a chance Jack isn't Jack and Chuck is still kicking, then I'll continue kicking too." He gives Cas a look. Castiel finally looks at Dean. It's a short glance, but it's there. "If we go back to Earth, will it be like when Sam died, after, or closer to when I died?"
"Sam!"
The pure-blood rolled his shoulders and his wings appeared on his back. Cas let out a sharp exhale of breath that he hadn't realized he was holding. His black, beautiful wings stretched out behind him, as far as they could go without hitting the dirty walls of the bathroom stall. Which, by the way, was not far at all.
Sam shows him the mark. The angel looks at it for a few moments. "That is not a Cupid mark. But I do know what it is."
The hunter shakes his head. "Far too long. It's been a year and a half. Sam moved out a few months ago to be with Eileen. He's considering asking her to marry him. Jack's usually up to the tips of his wings in work. It's just me here most of the time."
With a split second glance at Cas, Dean replies, "a boy."
"Go," Cas breathed out.
Castiel  nods.  "I don't understand that reference but I see that your brother must mean a lot to you by the way you talk about him."
From inside the house, Ellen and Bobby watched them through a window. "They've got a big future planned for them, don't they?" Ellen asked, looking over at her husband.
"Cas!" Dean yelled, racing over to his friend.
Cas nods. "Yes, Professor, they are."
There's a moment of stillness before Dean finally gives in and opens the wrapped present. Dean unwraps the item. He freezes when he sees what it is. It's a framed picture of Team Free Will 2.0 and it was a picture that Dean didn't have. The picture was from a few years back. If Dean remembers correctly it was just after Michael had unpossessed  him. It had been Castiel's idea since they didn't really have an updated picture of the four of them. Dean though that picture had gotten lost forever, but apparently not.
The other boy adds in his name, "and my name's Benny Leffite."
Dean smiled gently at Cas and reached over to pull the blanket back over himself and Cas. He did so before falling back to sleep.
To think you were never truly happy in life
“So are only the top two wings real and the bottom two are.. I don’t know, fake?” Dean asks.
"Is this like a magic-only library or something?" Gabriel asks, looking back over at Sam and then Vanya and Sissy.
With each passing second of silence, Cas got a bit more worried. Lupin’s words rang throughout the pure-blood’s head ‘the wings would start to hurt, and loose some feathers, before becoming very frail and weak, and then loose all feathers’. Would that happen if Cas’ mate rejected him? Cas did not want that to happen. He didn’t want Dean to reject him nor for him to go through all of that.
"You have seven years to do that, Charlie. I think you'll have time for another try," Dean said, making himself comfortable on the school grass.
Ellen was the one who made it to the door first. She opened the door wide and let Kelly Kline and Asa Fox inside. Kelly, who was only a few years out of Hogwarts herself, had a bag of gifts hung over her arm. She was the youngest professor at the school. Asa was slightly older than Kelly.
Aaron hesitated, not sure if he should tell the boys or not. "We do not believe that it was just a house fire. We think that someone may have caused this fire." He took out a picture. "Do either of you recognize this man?"
“And is he....?”
McGonagall stood up at the Teacher's Table and gave a short, rather quick speech before she allowed the meal to start. Food appeared all over the tables when the headmistress sat down. Many of the foods were fall-themed but there were some regular meals for the kids who were picky and didn't like any of the festive foods.
The three boys sat still, silently thinking about their absent mothers. Gabriel walked in to the room, "I convinced Ellen to make some pie, if you guys want to help."
Charlie laughs a bit. "Sorry 'bout barging in. It seems fourth year girls don't want to hear my stories about muggle online roleplay. I was honestly surprised that I got my letter. But super happy. I mean, I get to live my own story, not just me on my computer all my life."
Dean shakes his head, "I appreciate the thought, but I'm really not in the mood to accept gifts right now."
The second teacher to have this job was Bobby. As there were no other students yet in the Great Hall, the professor went over and talked with his adopted son and his new friends. Though, Bobby didn't ask any personal questions to Dean as to not embarrass the boy. But Bobby did take notice to the glances his boy threw Cas' way and took note of that.
But you would always be forgiven
Lupin raises his chin slightly, curious as to where Cas was going with this.
The front door opens and Gabriel and Sam walk it. "What did we miss?"
Charlie, Kevin and Ash had gotten closer during their time in Heaven together. They turned out to be quite a chaotic duo. Jo and Charlie had become friends through gossip and just being girls. Pamela and Mick talked some.
Dean looked at Cas, frowning a bit. “No, I won’t do any of that stuff, what kind of friend- or mate I should say,” Dean added a smile, “-do you think I am?”
Dean dropped to his knees so he was at the same height as Cas. The Winchester reached out and tipped Cas' chin up so the angel was looking at him. Dean's gaze immediately softened. The hunter moved and wrapped Cas up in a hug.
"And they are feeling fine?" Lupin asks.
The angel doesn't answer for a moment. Finally, he replies quietly, "you. Dean, I love you."
(Dean's wand)
"Yes, just a slice. We have to save some for later or you'll probably regret it," Ellen says.
Bobby looked up from his coffee and over at the young boy. "Well, Lupin should be coming over soon for lunch. The rest should be showing up an hour or so after."
The black haired girl who took their order looked at the pair individually before turning and telling the other two workers what to make. The worker told them that their orders would be right with them.
A few minutes later, both Dean and Cas were walking up to a big house and knocking on the door, their fake FBI badges out and ready.
"Have you actually used your wings for flight before? Are they strong enough to hold you?" Dean asks him, curiously.
"With Dean and I back and alive, the timeline is already changing, it wouldn't be any use trying to keep it in tact."
"I hope so too," Dean agreed with a nod.
Lupin took a step towards Garth and Cas, trying to find what Garth was talking about. "Did what? Who did what to Cas?"
And so, dammit,
Cas jolted awake, his wings getting into a defensive position behind him.
"Goodman, Howard"
The group of friends all growled but obeyed Michael's orders and seperated to go to their own house table. Michael nodded and patted Dean's back before going back to his seat.
Translation for spell is literally ‘become winged beast’ in Latin. With one change to make it “original” XD
Castiel hesitates before starting. "Well, I started working at the Roadhouse about six months ago with my older brother Gabriel. We used to stay with the rest of our family, but we all had to separate and leave when our family was bank robbed. What about you? What's your family like?"
Dean rolls his eyes. Maze and Meg chuckle at that. Mazikeen stands and pats Meg's shoulder before going back over to the Slytherin table.
Dean looked around. "Do you live alone?" He asks the woman.
Please comment, share, and give kudos if you haven’t.
Jody and Donna had brought their twin girls Alex and Claire, who were both four years old. Gabriel and Sam had left pretty early to go play- or as they claimed, hang out-  with the younger girls.
Blaine Anderson and one of the other Hufflepuff prefects led the first year Hufflepuffs to the common room that would be their home for the next seven years.
"We can head to your place, unless it's too much of a problem?"
Gabriel decided to answer for his brother. "We're just squatting here for now. I'm Gabriel, by the way, Cassie's brother."
"If you're nervous about our first day, then don't be. You'll do fine. And even if yours you, it's okay. You can learn how to do it better," Gabriel says.
Dean sits forward a bit in his beanbag. He runs his fingers gently through the soft feathers before going back through and trying to straighten out most of the crooked ones.
"I don't know honestly. Are
Immediately, Cas stepped towards Dean like he was picking a pattern on a school project. Dean smiled at Cas.
"This is a really good costume. How'd you manage to put this together in under 24 hours?"
Cas smiles at Dean. “I know. Maybe one day, I’ll become brave enough to show you that part of me.”
Sam nods, "okay!" He says cheerily.
But you weren’t the only one in love
Ellen had chose "Nightmare Before Christmas", despite it being a half-Halloween movie. Cas brought his wings back out and settled into the couch next to Dean. Cas sat next to Sam, who sat next to Gabriel. The four boys watched the movie while Ellen and Bobby cleaned up.
Cas had a panicked look on his face. It was the man who had chased his mother, there was no questioning it. Cas had never seen this man in his life before last night, so how could he have possibly known that he was suspected for the murder to Dean's mother.
“Should we go back to the party or do you have something else to add?” Dean asks, looking at the deva with a gentle gaze.
Charlie threw her arms up at them in a what-was-that-for kind of way. "C'mon, I was just getting to know her!" Charlie pouted at them.
"I did," Cas replies in a voice somehow quieter than a whisper.
And I cannot tell you how excited I got when I realized Meg and Maze could be a ship! I may or may not have even created a short edit for them haha. Megzikeen anyone?
It wasn't long before Sam and Gabriel came racing up the stairs and into the room. They were grinning at each other. "Careful, boys! The oven's on!" Ellen warned them. They ignored her and sat down with their brothers.
“Balthazar went to go find Michael and Lucifer?” Cas asks, addressing Gabriel.
The pair of brothers joined their other siblings at the breakfast table after making their own, quick breakfast of cereal. Michael wasn’t there, it was Michael’s first year at Hogwarts. But everyone else was there.
What came as a surprise to Dean, was one of the first year girls came up to him and started talking to him.
The Novak shakes his head, “no. We can go back.”
The pure-blood thinks for a moment. Hanging out with Dean for the holidays does seem nice. And he isn’t exactly the glue of his family. Plus Gabriel would like to meet another wizard his age, as well as Dean (though Cas could only imagine the joking taunts Gabe would throw his way when he’s told that Dean is his mate).
The angel turns to the other workers, perhaps a bit too confident for someone who just encountered his first crush. Castiel was sure of it, though. For some reason, he felt attracted to this Dean Winchester.
Seth and Aaron exchanged a look.
To Gabriel, Sam was like his first real friend, which is probably the best thing Gabe has ever felt. Sam felt a similar way about Gabriel. Of course Sam had gotten the chance to make friends during his childhood and had a bunch of muggle friends around the town. Gabriel just seemed different to Sam from all of his other friends.
The nurse got Castiel to a bed in the corner of the hospital wing so if another student were to come along sick, she would easily be able to put a divider up to hide him. The nurse got some medicine and brought it over to Cas.
"Decker," Maze challenged quietly, "would you rather be a muggle or a squib?"
"Yes, much. Thank you."
Cas' feet hit the ground lightly as Cas landed. The deva grinned widely at Dean. Dean beamed back at him with an identical grin.
With few more words, McGonagall hung around for another minute or so before getting up and leaving.
Dean went next. From Sam, he gotten a small Walkman that he could bring to Hogwarts so he could listen to music there. He thanked his brother and opened his other presents. Dean's second present was a small box. Within the small box was a green bracelet. Dean had seen this bracelet before- Castiel had received it in the mail a few weeks back. Gabriel or one of his other siblings must have gotten it for him so Cas could give it to Dean. The Winchester smiled at Cas with a look of gratitude as he said the bracelet onto his wrist. Cas muttered something about how the bracelet matched Dean's eyes. The final present Dean got was an o je the he could already make out through the wrapping paper. Dean grinned over at Ellen and Bobby as he unwrapped the object to reveal a nice, slick, black broom. A Skysweeper 1967.
Cas looked at the picture for a moment. The man in the picture glanced up from whatever he was doing and met gaze with Cas. The man's eyebrows furrowed before he looked back at whatever he was doing. Castiel shrugged and continued walking.
Dean eventually pulled away. However, Cas' wing didn't like that and tried to get Dean to keep doing it, but Cas moved back so his wing couldn't try anything that could raise suspicion. Though Cas did admit, Dean's carful and soft movements did feel nice.
"Apparently."
Ellen watched as this went on, she was smiling a bit to herself.
Cas smiled. "I can't wait."
Dean and Charlie were talking around, not noticing that Cas was panicking as he finally realized something that he probably should have realized a while ago. Dean was his mate.
Sam, not being the biggest fan of this particular movie, wasn't really paying attention. No one really was. Dean had his arm wrapped around Castiel and Cas' head was resting on Dean's shoulder.
Gabe thought for a moment and decided to copy his brother's choice. "I'll stay with Sam, if that's cool?"
Sam ignored this glare and yelled at the top of his lungs, "MERRY CHRISTMAS!!"
Cas made his way over to her, his wings relaxing and spreading a bit when he saw her. Charlie had a similar reaction to everyone else. "Whoa, Cas, solid costume you got there. You look great!" Charlie grinned at him.
Dean looked at Cas, easily noticing how nervous his friend currently was. "Of course, Cas. What's up?" He responds.
The charms teacher took out a load of feathers and passed them around, giving one to each student.
Dean thought for a moment. "Hey. You mentioned Michael saying you were a natural on a broom. Is that because you were literally born to fly?"
"Sam!" Dean scolds. "Cas, you don't have t-"
A spell hit her leg, causing a large gash to appear on her calf. Vicky let out a cry of pain and fell to the ground, hitting the ground hard.
Oh, hey! Some actual MoonStar! Wow!
“I know...” Cas sighed and made his wings disappear.
Cas took a breath, his wings ruffling behind him. Now, he really wanted to find out if he was right. All signs were currently pointing to Dean, but there was only one way to find out for sure if the half-blood was truly Cas' mate or not.
The Winchester looked at Cas, wide-eyed. "Nice trick." Dean laughed as he got off his broom.
"Yes, ma'am. I did have breakfast," Castiel confirms.
Gabriel walks in. "I was able to buy this last time I was in Diagon Alley. It's a new lotion for wings, I thought Cas would like this." Gabe put the lotion down.
Castiel stepped in. "Get whatever you want and I can pay for it," he said seriously. "Really."
"Merry Christmas, Cas," Dean said softly before laying down and falling easily to sleep.
Cas looks at Dean in a you-haven’t-told-him-yet way. Dean shrugs.  “Yes,” Cas answers him, looking back at the younger boy, “it’s my broom that I use to fly. The school got it for me when I got onto the Hufflepuff Quidditch team.”
One by one, the guests start to leave. Eventually, the house is quiet again. Ellen tells the boys that if they quickly change into their pajamas, they could watch a holiday muggle movie before they would have to go to bed.
“Are you and your brother staying with the Singers for the whole break or just part of it?” Ginny Potter asked, aiming her question at Castiel.
On their second day at work, Meg and Castiel were talking with each other. It was a quiet hour and no one was waiting in line to order. Castiel had been assigned to take orders with Meg, while Gabriel had been told to work with Jo and Ash in making the orders and preparing them.
"Nice to meet you. Mind if I call you Cas? 'Castiel' is sort of a mouthful." Cas shrugged in response. Dean looked at him for a moment, "where did your parents come up with Castiel anyways? Not really a common name."
Dean was doing pretty well with school as well. He definitely wasn't the top of all his classes, but he wasn't at the bottom, instead somewhere in the middle. The Winchester did miss his younger brother more and more everyday. He was secretly counting down the days until Christmas break, and whenever he would receive a letter from Sam, he would write back as quickly as he could.
You made me want to keep going
With some thread, Dean tied his letter to the leg of his owl. "You know where to take this," Dean whispered to his owl, petting his feathers. With a soft coo, Dr. Whoo flew into the air and was soon out of sight with Dean's letter. Dean smiled a bit to himself as he watched his owl go. Only a few months until the holiday break and he can see Sam. Only a few months.
Cas notices a picture of four year old Dean and a two year old Sam, holding hands with a dark-haired man and a blonde woman. "Was... was that your mother?" Cas asks, glancing over at his mate.
"You two open your presents and then we'll have some homemade cinnamon rolls," Ellen says to them when she spots the two boys.
There were a few whispers of "who is it" from the guests as the living room didn't allow a visual to the front door. No one could hear what Bobby was saying so when the old hunter came back into the living room, there was a chorus of questions about who was at the door.
The few hours before the game, Cas was nervous and seemed out of it with anxiety. He got an awkward good luck from Dean before the game started.
A second later, Cas moved forward and wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. Dean then gently took Cas into a hug. "It's okay, bud. It wasn't real. I'm here.. you're safe," Dean said, doing his best to calm Castiel down.
Vicky ran and ran as fast as she could. Her speed was becoming slower, however, as she was loosing stamina as well as breath.
Cas had gotten a bit nervous about his decision for his costume, but he never changed his mind. He could actually be himself and no one would care or even notice. That's right, for his costume, Castiel was going to get out his wings. He wasn't going to judged one bit if he had his wings out! It was a perfect plan.
"No problem, kid," Bobby says, patting the boy's shoulder while being careful to not disrupt the two pairs of hidden wings.
Charlie booed but shrugged, thinking that was the best she was going to get.
"We'll be using these to practice. I want to see how good you really are," Dan says, while getting a school-used broom for Cas to fly on.
The class continued on with Bobby describing one witch who tried to find the ones causing all the confusion. He explained that this witch did catch a few people in the act but not nearly enough to stop them all.
Dean recognizes the last name. "You're Castiel's brother?" He asks Michael.
Cas laughs softly. "Yes, you could say that."
With her own broom, Madam Hooch showed the students how to get on their brooms and press off of the hard ground, launching her into the sky. After doing a circle around the group of students, Madam Hooch came down to the ground. She told the students to just raise themselves a couple feet off the ground and not moving
"No, you idjit, I stepped up, not you," Bobby interrupted.
I just watched Prisoner Of Azkaban earlier today so I had some inspiration for the boggart part. Also someone get me some headcanons where modern day muggle-borns print pictures of memes and take the memes to school with them to show their pure-blooded friends to confuse them.
Dean missed his brother a lot, but reading this letter made him miss Sammy even more. Sure, the two brothers could get into nasty fights, but they were still brothers and Dean loves Sam. The Winchester put his letter away.
At last, the doorbell rang for a final time. Ellen got up to go open the door. Dean and Cas both watched her go, trying to see if either of them could catch a glimpse of the famous Potter family. Shortly, Ellen came back into the room. A red headed woman with a dark brown haired ,an came into the room after her. Ginny and Harry Potter. Clinging to Ginny’s side was a three year old boy, Albus Severus Potter. Hanging on to Harry’s hand was four year old James Sirius Potter Jr. A third boy came running in. This boy was nine, the same age as Sam and Gabriel. The boy had sky blue hair. He raced over to Professor Lupin and hugged him. Lupin smiled widely and hugged the boy back. This was Teddy Lupin, Professor Lupin’s son.
"Sam, come on, cheer up! We get another chance at life together! All three of us together," Dean says, a smile spreading upon his face. He pulls Cas close. "We wait a few months or something, maybe go on a few more hunts, and just make sure that Jack Kline is actually Jack Kline. We've won free will, and as far as we know, Chuck is just trying to keep his appearance up for now. So in the meantime, we just do what we want and keep our eyes peeled."
Castiel listened intently, nodding whenever Dan checked to see if he was paying attention. Dan seemed really into Quidditch and seemed like a really good team captain.
Gabriel and Castiel have only been on Earth for about a month. The angels had all fallen from Heaven just after news spread about creating the apocalypse and destroying the Earth. Apparently word had gotten to some higher power, some theorize God, had caught word of that idea and did not want the apocalypse taking place on Earth. The angels were all forced into human vessels. They each only had so much of their grace remaining, if any. Their wings are now featherless, though only visible to other angels unless they gave certain humans permission, and stand as reminder as to what they once were. Gabriel and Castiel had stayed with two other angels Balthazar and Anna, but had recently departed to go off on their own.
Cas finally relaxed a bit, believing that Dean was actually telling the truth. The deva really didn’t want another person he should have in his life up and leaving him.
The pair went silent again, going back to watching the stars above them.
Dean huffs a laugh and stands up. "We just got back from the dead, Sammy, I don't want you burning down the bunker with your terrible cooking skills. I'll do it." Dean takes Cas' hand again. "Help me, will you, angel?"
It didn't take long for the cake to disappear. After it is gone, Sam, Eileen and Jody stick around for a bit and hang out with Dean.
Dean flung his arms out at Cas in a "What-did-I-tell-you" sort of why. Cas smiled and rolled his eyes at him.
See, there had been a fault in the plan to kill God. And the fault was that he's God. Chuck knows everything, every little outcome from every little choice. So he was prepared for the Winchesters to come up with the plan for Jack to absorb all his power. To prep for that possibility, Chuck came up with a plan of his own. If Jack absorbed all of Chuck's powers, Jack would become God. But Chuck made sure that a fraction of hisself was taken along with his powers: the immortal part. That left Chuck's body mortal, but a fragment of himself immortal and attached to the new God. It took less than a few hours for Chuck to power back up. And when he did, he took control of Jack's vessel, ensuring that his planned ending still folded out the way he wanted.
Dean finally speaks. "What does that mean?"
Dean watched as Bobby stood up to leave. This was his chance. Dean stood up and made his way to catch up with his adopted guardian. Bobby turned when his boy caught up to him.
Cas' wings fluttered behind him, his mind traveling to the group of people that would be showing up for the party. He didn't know Professor Longbottom, Kline, Fox and Turner well. And he didn't even know the Potters, so he only had so much time with his wings out left.
The sun is set by the time Cas arrives back at the Bunker. He parks his car in the garage and enters the Bunker.
(See the end of the chapter for
Once done, the pair got up and left the restaurant. They got back into the Impala and drove off.  "Back to my place or do you want to leave it at that and I can just drive you home?" Dean asked Castiel.
"You aren't going to take him back, are you?" Dean asks suddenly, looking over to Jack.
Outside, Dan didn't lead Cas to the field where his Flying class had recently taken place but to the Quidditch pitch a bit farther away from the school. Firstly, Dan showed Cas to the Hufflepuff changing room. Cas was showed the Hufflepuff Quidditch uniform that he would have to wear while playing. Dan explained that he would be getting his own uniform made as well as his own broom bought for him as the school brooms couldn't compete with the other brooms students had.
Castiel gapes at them. No. Absolutely not. He was not going to just go over and give this Dean Winchester his number! That's ridiculous!
I know this was a bit rushed, especially the restaurant part. It’s mostly just filler.
A teacher seemed to be on "child duty" and about every half an hour, that teacher would get switched.
For the first hour or so, they had the Great Hall all to themselves. They talked loudly and laughed as loud and as long as they wanted.
A two weeks of classes passed. The Ravenclaws won the game against Slytherin so the final match of the year would be Hufflepuff vs Ravenclaw. Castiel spent hours preparing for the match. He took out some of his upset emotions by flying around on his broom.
Gabriel looks at Cas and opens his arms wide with a snarky grin on his face. Gabriel was jokingly mocking Sam and Dean. Cas shakes his head a bit and ruffles Gabriel's hair.
Cas smiles softly. "Sure." He rolls his shoulders back and his four wings appear on his back. The deva's wings don't spread out to their resting position. Cas was showing his wings off to a person he had only just met. And sure, it was Dean's little brother, but still.
"I know you idjits are excited for the feast and the costume party after, but there is only one more class so I want you all to concentrate and listen to me when I speak, okay? It's hard for you to listen on a regular day, just try." Bobby looked at his class and huffed before starting the lesson. "Wizards in Greece did not have the best tactics at staying hidden. Some of them went along and tried to confuse muggle citizens."
Dean nods. “Yes sir, I do.”
Sam stood up, Dean however, grabbed Cas' hand. "Cas comes," Dean said, leaving no room for argument. Bobby only shrugged and showed the Winchesters and Cas to the two men.
"When I was born," Cas started quietly, "my mother... she didn't want me with the way I was. She thought I was a mistake. So... she left. My father was really upset that she left. And he, kind of, needed someone to blame. He took his blame out on me. H-he called me so many things that I still believe to be true today.” Cas paused. “And... he hurt me. Only me, not my brothers because I was to blame for my mother’s exit. He called me a monster. A-and with the way I am, I’m afraid other people, people I trust and care about will start calling me that too, if I ever show my real self...”
Lupin is silent for a moment, taking in Castiel's story. And then he lets out a soft chuckle. "Yeah, actually, I do believe we have similar secrets." Cas looks at him, silently asking the professor to explain.
Lupin stood and watched from afar, his arms crossed and his face filled with concern.
Vanya and Sam stepped inside after Gabriel. Sam smiled at Gabe's reaction as Vanya makes her way over to Sissy, her girlfriend, and Sissy's kid Harlan.
Sorry for the shorter chapter (it’s like 300 words shorter than I would have liked but whatever). Just wanted to get this out before later. Before the juicy parts start up.
Sam wrapped Dean in a tight hug. After the hug and a few fought back tears ("come on, dude, no chick flicks, remember?"), Sam began to share his life experience with Dean. Sam shared how he went on hunting until he was fifty before retiring with Eileen and having a kid, of course mentioning that Sam's kid was named after Dean.
"Dean? Dean, you still alive in here?" A voice calls.
Professor Kline smiled at the four boys, Asa only nodded as a greeting.
The officiant turns to Dean and Cas. "Do you, Dean Michael Winchester, take Castiel Novak to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
“No, both sets are real. The bottom two are newer. Way newer, actually. Remember at the first four house sleepover when I left in the middle of the night and went to the hospital wing? That was when my bottom two wings came. Garth, you know the keeper of the grounds, said that devas only get another set or two of wings if they find their true mate. And it seems, I did,” Cas explains.
Castiel takes the folded napkin and walks with Gabriel over to an empty table. There, he unfolds the napkin.
Cas gives a small smile in return.
(And the amount of times Charlie would go around just saying "fuck you!" to anyone was too many to count. And sometimes, she would accidentally say it to a muggleborn and either get laughed at or get yelled at. Either way, it was still fun. Dean certainly had some laughs watching Charlie do this.)
Lupin chuckled. "Wouldn't be a bad choice," Lupin commented. "You two really remind me of Sirius and I when we were young." The professor smiled sadly, remembering his past.
The pair of them went silent. Castiel looked over at Dean's owl. Dean noticed him looking and brought Dr. Whoo closer to Cas.
Sam and Dean are getting ready in the same dressing room together, while Eileen and Cas have their own dressing rooms.
Cas bends down so he's eye to eye with the dog. For a moment, both the angel and the pup are still. Then Cas reaches out and pets Miracle. Miracle immediately wags his tail, a grin seemingly crossing his face, revealing his white dog teeth.
The pair talk more as Quil brings over their drinks and asks for their main course orders. When Quil left again, they continued to talk.
"I wouldn't be surprised either."
Cas paused for a moment. “I think it was just some bad sickness from being too stressed out.” He shrugs, trying to play casual. “It isn’t contagious anymore, do not worry.”
"Yes, that's all." Is the response.
So yeah. Sorry for the late update. I promise I haven’t given up on this book. I hope I don’t but things have been pretty crazy, so it is a small possibility. But I doubt it.
"....maybe."
Dean started, "I remember running into the hallway from my room and seeing how my little brother's room was lit up. I remember my dad running out of the room and handing me Sammy, telling me to run outside and not look back."
"Of course you can! You just have to go over there and talk with her! But don't mention being an angel, that isn't something humans take well," Gabriel warned.
Cas nods, standing up. He quietly says goodbye to his friends before leaving to go back to the field outside with Dan.
Quickly after retrieving his trench-coat, Cas travelled to the bathroom to change. It was a shared bathroom, so Cas hid in the corner stall to change. Already inside the bathroom, some dude seemed to have stolen his sister's makeup set because he had it open and was covering his face with makeup to look like some sort of zombie. Cas nodded a greeting to the guy as he passed him.
At breakfast the next day, Dean apologized to Castiel about not being there, saying he had been distracted by Lisa and forgot. This hurt Cas but he didn't show it on his face.
Charlie grabbed Cas' hand in a platonic, friendship way. "C'mon, we don't want to be late. I hope there's a costume contest going on because, oh man, you're gonna win." Charlie led Cas out of the Hufflepuff common room. The two of them walked through the halls of the school, Cas' wings spreading out a bit now that there were no other eyes around besides for Charlie's.
Headmistress McGonagall sat down at the edge of Cas’ hospital bed and looked over at the cursed deva with a sad look in her eye.
"Oh. Well, the Potters too then," Bobby said, correcting himself.
The two boys enjoy this for a little bit more before Dean gets an idea. With a mischievous look on his face, Dean sneakily reaches down to the snow and grabs a handful. The snow isn't thick enough to make a snowball, so Dean just throws the fistful of snow as is it.
The coffee shop door opened with a little jingle as the bell on it moved as the door slid open. Castiel looked up to see who had just entered. And for a reason he knew not of, the angel felt his stomach turn at the sight of the figure.
“Get up, get up. Come on, Castiel, you slept in late again! Pops is certainly not going to be happy! He’s already got into a fight with Luci.” His younger brother, Gabe, stood over Cas. “Wake up, wake up!”
Eventually, the group of Hufflepuff students arrived in the basement of Hogwarts. They passed what looked like a kitchen. Inside the kitchen there were small creatures working their butts off inside of the kitchen. Castiel recognized the creatures as house elves.
The angel's facial expression got a bit more worried. "It... it's Jack. Although, I guess I should really be saying that it's not Jack."
Professor Mills smiled at all of the students. "Right this way, students," she said, leading them through Hogwarts.
When Cas felt a hand on his shoulder, he jolted and turned around, his wings suddenly coming up into a defensive position. Lupin chuckled a bit and raised his hands in surrender. "Novak, may I speak with you? About the paper you handed in last Tuesday?"
"Oh, dear," Garth whispered quietly at seeing Cas' state.
"Spiritual things like this takes time. Plus Deano is doing this for the first time. Can't exactly rush it," Garth replies.
"Can I please have an acid pop and a pack of Bertie Bot's Every Flavored Beans?" Dean asked.
"Well, I wish you look because those things are super cool!"
Dean nods with a smile. “What is your ‘current situation’ anyways? Lupin wouldn’t tell me what happened.”
With the brooms already lined up and ready for the oncoming students, Madam Hooch stood, waiting on a field outside of Hogwarts.
Castiel, Dean, Charlie and Meg all made their way through the halls of the castle-like wizarding school. By now the rumor had, somehow, already spread that Cas was going to be apart of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team. And Cas was not at all liking the attention.
With Garth supposedly on the way, Bobby and Ellen helped Dean get Cas inside. They sat Cas down on a stool. Dean had taken Cas' hand by now and was trying to soothe his friend's pain.
"Thank you for letting us stay, Professor Singer," Cas says to Bobby.
Dean was planing to show Cas around the town when breakfast was finished. In fact, they were just about ready to leave when the doorbell rang. Almost immediately after the doorbell rang throughout the house, Cas' wings disappeared into thin air.
The angel doesn't respond. "I'm telling you that it would be safer if the Winchesters were back on Earth in case my theory is correct."
Meg, Gabriel, Jo and Ash- who had been listening in- all turn their heads to see who Castiel had his eyes set on.
Cas shrugged. "I don't know what this class will bring. But I hope it's something good. With that desk, who knows what this class will bring."
"Just do whatever feels right," Dean tries to provide some help, but as he doesn't have wings of his own, he doesn't have the personal experience nor knowledge to help.
And as for Cas, for the first seven-eight years of his life, he believed the things his father said. That he was a monster for having wings. That he was a disgusting little thing responsible for all of his family’s troubles. That he was a failure.
Please note, that I’m also writing this on Wattpad. On Wattpad, it seems like this chapter is long, but here it looks short. So, my apologies.
Back in the kitchen, Sam was getting some food together. He had gotten out two burgers for Dean to cook when he returned. And if in ten minutes Dean wasn't back, then Sam would make his own food.
"Gabriel came in looking for you. He wanted to give that to you. Said he bought it last time he was in Diagon Alley and said you might like it."
Dean glared daggers at Charlie. "Both."
The other boy nods and goes over to the pile of clothes on the floor. He picked up the clothes and sorted out his clothes from Cas'. "Here." Dean handed the deva his clothes. "Mind if I change in the corner? I don't wanna bother going out and trying to find a bathroom just yet."
The four boys and two adults walk up to the house. Ellen unlocks the front door with a key because of the 'no magic outside of the house' rule.
There's loud laughter coming from the basement which was probably Gabriel and Sam messing around downstairs. No one had any idea what they were doing down there. But they weren't bothering anyone that anyone knew of, so they were fine.
Castiel goes quiet as he takes his stuff off of his bed. He takes out one of the school uniforms he had bought at Diagon Alley and sets it out for morning. Castiel didn't bother packing or even changing into some comfortable pajamas before slipping under the warm sheets of his bed and doing his best to fall asleep.
"What did she do?" Dean asks, look at Cas. He didn't feel anything different, nor the urge to kill someone or kill himself.
Dean eventually came to a compartment with a small, black-haired boy inside of it. The boy looked nice enough, so Dean decided he could try sitting there. Dean opened the compartment door and knocked a bit to notify the boy that he was there.
Maybe we can continue what we never got to start
After a long list of students, it was Meg's turn to get sorted. She got called up and walked rather confidently up to the stool. The hat sat on her head for less than a minute before shouting out "SLYTHERIN".
Cas, Charlie and Dean found a few of their other friends. It took awhile before Cas finally looked at his wing that Dean had been touching and noticed something off. The feathers in this wing had been straightened out, when Cas hadn't been able to do that for a while.
"Whoa!" Charlie exclaims. "Nice going, Cas! I'm so proud!" Charlie pats Cas' back. Cas pulls away from the touch on instinct but smiled at Charlie in thanks.
With the agreement in place to go to the party, Sam and Dean get into Baby and drive down the road to Bobby's place.  It didn't take long for the boys to arrive. Since they knew where they were going, the road that went all across Heaven, gave them a shortcut and allowed the brothers to arrive in under ten minutes.
When McGonagall finished her speech, Dean just wanted the meal to be over. He hated not being able to talk with most of his friends. Sure, Chloe and Lucifer Morningstar we're both at his table, but they mostly stayed to themselves.
Sam and Gabriel were both still in Sam's room. So either, they were both still sleeping, or they were talking with each other and unintentionally missing pancakes. When the two younger boys did arrive, they were both still in their pajamas and both had tired looks still on their faces, so they had probably slept in.
Cas grins at Dan’s save. Up here was really the best view for watching the Quidditch game. It was the Novak’s first game so he was really mesmerized by how it all worked.
Lucifer partnered up with Michael
"Well, there is actually someone," Dean says quietly.
"Hey, guys. So you wouldn't believe what just happened to Cas in flying today," Dean started, getting both girls' attention. "Cas and I were fooling around up in the air and we raced down to the ground when we got called. Cas made an incredible move and beat me to the ground. He got called over to Madam Hooch and the Head of Hufflepuff was there. So the Head took Cas to meet the Hufflepuff Team Captain so now Cas now has a position on the team as seeker."
Right?
In response to Dean’s reaction, Cas’ wings immediately cowered, as Cas thought it was a bad oh.
"How long have you been excited to go to Hogwarts?" Cas asks, noticing all the Hogwarts posters up.
The three of them talked and talked while the train went on. They shared Dean's pack of Bertie Bot's Every Flavored Beans. Together, they laughed and enjoyed each other's company. Eventually, they decided they should change into their school uniforms. It wasn't long after that did the train come to a stop, having finally arrived at their destination.
Castiel suddenly froze. He didn't know what to say. "U-uhm, I don't think I gave you my name. I'm Castiel."
“You know, when your brother Michael was in his first year, he came to me to talk. And he told me everything that had been happening. He didn’t know who else to tell, so he came to me. I wasn’t upset about it, more glad that he did talk to someone about it. He told me how his life back home was. He told me about his loving little brother who was cursed to be different from everyone else. His brother that was too nice to everyone even when he was treated terribly in return because of something he never did. I told him that it had always been in his hands to do something to help his little brother. And that’s what he did.” The headmistress looked at Castiel.
Cas stands up from his chair, whispering to Dean, "I'll be back."
Dean easily found his room. When he entered his room, he grinned when he saw Dr. Whoo, along with his other things, on one of the five beds. He walked over to his owl and gently patted him through the birdcage.
When Cas reaches the bedroom hallway of the bunker, he sees multiple red rose petals on the ground, leading away down the end of the hall.
Charlie and Castiel said goodbye to each other before separating, Charlie muttering about hoping to have some cool girls as her roommates.
How could a 4 year old boy take care of his brother
The group walked passed the kitchens and over to a bundle of about six barrels. Blaine took out his wand and looked over at the first years. "Now, to open the entrance to our common room, you must tap this barrel five times in the way you would say 'Helga Hufflepuff', okay?" Most of the students nodded. Blaine demonstrates and taps the barrel five times. The barrels all move aside and a wooden door is revealed. The door opens and the Hufflepuff students are all allowed inside.
Vanya smiles and stands up. "Of course. Right this way." She leads Sam and Gabriel to the farthest wall from the entrance. Five feet high bookcases block out most of what they're doing.
I love you too, Castiel.
On one side of the table, Professor Sinistra of astronomy sat next to Professor Remus Lupin who taught Defense Against the Dark Arts, who sat next to Neville Longbottom who teaches herbology, then Bobby Singer who teaches History of Magic, then Rowena MacLeod who teahces potions, Missouri Moseley who teaches transfiguration, Madam Hooch the Quidditch coach, the ancient runes teacher Kevin Tran, who sits next to the arithmancy Professor Vector and then the charms Professor Jody Mills.
Cas let out a sign of relief. If that was Dean’s first question, Cas was probably going to end up fine.
"I can take you both back to Earth after you died, Dean, I'll place you in your body, heal that; then put Sam in his body, hopefully Sam's older consciousness will take over for the one in that time. It'll change the known timeline and you can still die again. But if Chuck makes a move, we'll be there to stop it," Castiel explains.
Dean sighs, and takes some food onto his plate when the meal appears. He eats quietly, thinking to himself. He knew what his costume for later was going to be. But he had no idea what Cas was going to do for his costume, and Dean was pretty excited to find out, because Cas seemed like the kind of person who could come up with amazing costumes in literal seconds.
Dean and Cas sat beside each other, hand in hand. Castiel had hidden his wings, not really comfortable showing them off around teachers he didn't know well. Next to Cas, Gabriel sat with his legs crossed. Gabe had an oversized sweater on that he had stolen from Lucifer. Sam sat next to Gabriel and had a cup of hot chocolate in his hands. Bobby and Lupin sat farther down on the couch. There were two couches and three chairs. Everyone was on the first couch (which was rather big) because it was easier to talk instead of sitting from all different corners of the room.
Yes I did the Vanya/Sissy thing.
Once again, Cas feels small arms wrap around his waist. He looks down to see young Anna hugging him. Cas reaches down and picks his little sister up. “Hi, Anna.” He greets her. “Anna, this is my friend Dean and his little brother Sam. Can you say hi?”
"Step back, I know a healing charm," Ellen says.
Lupin smiled to himself, thinking about that memory.
Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin students were all cheering in the stands and watching attentively as the game begun. Colors of the two competing houses were all over. The Ravenclaw team played well and was a challenge for the Hufflepuffs, but the yellow-themed team did their best to stay strong.
//Author's note: hahahahaha\\
Dean, still with a joking manner, rolls his eyes.
Sometimes, his brothers would play Quidditch on their own brooms and Cas would play along as seeker because he was the lightest one of the bunch. But he almost never used a broom, instead using his wings because that was much easier and far less expensive.
Both boys look at the moving picture for a moment, before Sam steps in and breaks the sad moment. "Can I see your wings?" He asks, looking up hopefully at Cas.
Castiel, Michael and Lucifer all met up with their siblings. Cas waved farewell to his friends before turning to his family and giving a small smile. Anna wrapped her arms around Cas' waist in a childish greeting. "Did you have fun?" Anna asks in her small voice.
Castiel stood up, relieved that the sorting for him was over. He made his way over to the yellow and black color themed table and sat down next to Charlie, who had squished herself next to the older student she was sitting next to just so Cas could sit with her.
Sam made an announcement, making sure to tag the hunters close to them that had been the most worried and/or upset about Dean's previous death.
"Of course," Lupin smiles.
About an hour later, Jack leaves to go back to Heaven. This leaves just Castiel and Dean to themselves again. When Jack leaves, Dean makes a burger for himself for dinner. Cas just watches him cook silently. When he finishes up cooking, he gets another beer for himself and one for Cas.
Dean pulls away from Cas. "Who is it? Is it Sam?"
Eventually, Lupin really started the class. He went over the rules and basics of the year. Lupin asked for questions once he finished. A couple of kids did raise their hands (or two kids raised their wands).
The two professors, Ellen and the four boys talked with each other for a long while- their conversation having gone on after lunch, but it didn't feel like that long. So it was a slight surprise when the doorbell rang once again.
Dean looks back at Cas.
The journey to the playground took about three and a half hours to get there. When he arrives, Cas took a good look around. He wonders where in the name of his dead father, could Dean hide another note.
The Winchester hesitates before going on, "before you let yourself... before the Empty took you, what you said... was that true?"
You made a deal
Jody laughs softly at his response. "Excited to get class started or so nervous that you just couldn't eat?" She asks.
Dan threw another, faster golf ball into the air. This one zipped around rather quickly. Cas focused on the blur that was moving in front of him and chased it, more focused than ever. He caught the golf ball in less than twenty seconds.
"Sounds like a plan."
"Winchester?" Gabriel repeats. "Well, they're the last in the direct bloodline from Cain and Abel. If I remember correctly, before John Winchester, they were all Men of Letters. The last of their family line, Sam and Dean, they were supposed to be Michael and Lucifer's vessels during the Apocalypse. But that obviously isn't happening anymore." Gabriel looks at his younger brother. "Why you suddenly interested in the Winchesters?"
Castiel caught a glimpse of Dean all the way across the room. Cas looked sadly at the boy he had already gotten to know and like. He watched as Dean disappeared with the other Gryffindors, while silently hoping he would be seeing more of the Winchester despite being in different houses.
Dean stood up with a smile on his face and went over to the Gryffindor's table. He sat himself down, his grin still plastered on his face.
There was the familiar breeze of invisible wings flapping as Castiel appears. "Hello, Dean. Sam," he greets.
"This is the big day, Sammy, can you believe that?" Dean asks his brother.
The Hufflepuffs are called out to the field. As one, they walk out and join the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Donna stands in the center of the field, one of the Quidditch balls tucked under her arm.
"I would rather be with anyone than with you. I don't hang out with monsters."
Dean thought it was just him and Cas in the Panic Room, but he was wrong. A Hogwarts house elf worked silently. The house elf had clothes in her hands. Dean recognized the clothes as Hogwarts uniforms.
The Winchester stands up and motions for Gabriel to follow him. Slightly amused but also curious about where Sam was leading him to. Sam brought Gabriel into town. This town was full of muggles and a young lesbian wizarding couple. The town Ackles was a nice small place.
"Alright, Dean I want you and your brother to start measuring the sugars. You know the measurements already, so you should be good." Ellen started to instruct the boys. "Cas, I want you to get three tablespoons of flour, okay? Gabriel, can you get me a quarter teaspoon of ginger and another quarter teaspoon of cinnamon."
Another thing, he didn't even have a phone! He and Gabriel had very little. They had the clothes on their back and a hand full of money that Balthazar managed to steal from some store. They didn't have a home or nothing.
Right?
Castiel looks over to the woman Meg was talking about. He turns back to her and shakes his head. "N-no. Its the guy in the corner, table 17."
Cas wouldn't possibly think that there was a chance his mother was still out there. Everyone thought that Vicky had left home one night and then died on the streets. She wasn't still out there.
Bobby nods. "It's just a few people. Professor Lupin, Professor Kline, Professor Longbottom, Professor Fox, Professor Turner, and the Mills with their twins: Alex and Claire."
"Cura ipsum!" Ellen cast her charm, her wand pointing at Cas' injured wing.
“Yes, sir,” Cas answers. “He has told me about Ellen.” Cas greets Ellen with a small smile, before going on to introduce his brother. “This is Gabriel, my brother.”
The students discussed quietly between themselves as time ticked on. The time for class to start passed before, finally, Lupin came out of his office and came over to his students. "Sorry for the wait, kids. I had to make sure a few things were in order before we start. Usually, this lesson doesn't come until third year, but I decided to have a lesson change." Lupin explained why he had been late.
Prompt: Sam and Dean start a hunt, only to realize that they need Castiel's help to pull this hunt off. What none of them realize is that this particular hunt will lead to everything changing and Sam finally becoming the official third wheel.
"Or we could be making things a lot better," Dean argues.
The fallen angel looks at Dean's face. "Should I go? I should go-" He moves to leave but Dean stops him by grabbing on to the trench-coat sleeve. Dean pulls Cas closer to him and connects their lips. The hunter kisses Cas for a few seconds before pulling away and muttering, "I love you too," against the angel's lips.
Thinking that was enough wing time for now, Cas puts his wings away. Dean frowns ever so slightly, as he could tell Castiel was a bit uncomfortable with his wings out around other people that weren't him.
"He was. His name was Jerry Con. He... he used to date my girlfriend. I think he was jealous of us together." The woman told the pair her story.
Castiel's face went a deep shape of pink. "N-no!"
Dean nods, "yeah, I felt that."
"And, Novak," Lupin stopped Cas. "You do know about the four-house sleepover, right? All four houses are welcome to come to the Great Hall for the night. It happens once a week on Saturday. Might brighten up your mood with that Gryffindor boy of yours." Lupin smirks.
Cas stands up and moves a few inches before sitting back down on the cold floor. His wings sitting relaxed against his back.
Quil takes their drink orders, Dean getting a type of alcoholic drink and Castiel just getting a simple water. Quil then walks off to get their drinks prepared for them.
"Why are you asking us these questions?" Dean asks. "It was just a house fire. Do... do you think it was something else?"
"Will you be going to the costume party?" Dean asks, turning his head to face Cas.
They practiced on and off for the next hour or so before Cas flew down to the ground and landed. Cas took his broom into his hand and walks over to Charlie. Charlie is grinning at him. Cas smiles a bit back.
The window of the car is pulled down and in the driver's seat is Dean Winchester. The Winchester grins at the other. "Sorry for being a bit late, got caught up in something."
It was now a few days before October 31 and Halloween. By now, Cas had gotten used to his new wings, though they did get sore more often than not. Cas had been struggling. His wings would no longer stay clean now. Apparently only his "mate" could clean them and they would stay clean. That was very hard to go on with, but Cas managed.
Gabriel sighed. "How about after we finish, I go with you up to talk with her, okay? I want you to have fun, even if we are stuck here on Earth." The archangel reached over and ruffled his younger brother's black hair.
To think your happiest moment was confessing
The screen went static for a moment, the annoying sound of it’s glitching filled the room. And then that sound stopped. The static screen changed once more. It showed a woman on the screen.
Cas had won the game. And all was good.  At least, for now.
The welcome back feast felt shorter than usual but wasn't short of perfection when it came to the presentation and taste of the meal. Loud chatter filled the Great Hall as the students and teachers all enjoyed their first meal back at Hogwarts.
"Dad, I-"
Charlie Bradbury - Sophia Lillis (obviously younger in the earlier years at Hogwarts)
“Yeah, I can do that.”
After saying goodbye, Cas left the Great Hall to get to the Owlery. The deva walked silently through the halls. He passed a few other students on the way but the halls were mostly empty. One of the moving pictures caught Cas' attention for a moment.
The pair of prefects led the Hufflepuffs to the right once out of the Great Hall, while the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws went to left and the Slytherin went straight on.
"I've got a code 9-18," Castiel announces.
Cas and Dean exchanged a look before following their professor out of Rowena’s party-holding office. Lupin leads them to the staircase room. The three of them travel across the moving staircases as Lupin tries to find the best way to get to their designated location. After about five tries of getting to someplace, Lupin finally brings the two boys to the second floor.
The half-blood smiles. “I wouldn’t care if I got sick, I get to see you.”
Ellen leaned back on the counter as she looked at her boys and their friends. And oh what a group this was. It reminded Ellen of the days when she was young and at Hogwarts. It reminded Ellen of her daughter. Jo would've gotten along with these boys.
For the rest of the meal, Castiel sits there, not speaking to anyone and not eating any desserts. Eventually, Professor McGonagall stands up from her chair.
Sam sees his brother's face fall slightly in the mirror. "What is it?"
"And do you, Castiel Novak, take Dean Michael Winchester to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Eileen smiles shyly up at Sam. She looks absolutely stunning in her white, long wedding dress. Happiness sparkles in her eyes as she walks up to her future husband.
When Cas went back over to Dean and Charlie, Charlie was talking about her costume with Meg. "You really don't know 'The Labyrinth'? With David Bowie and everything?" Meg shook her head. Dean was laughing at them.
“Ooh look at this, two faggot children. How wonderful!” It’s a fifth year who has a snarky grin on his face. He stands laughing with a couple of his friends.
Mom had said
Dean, Sam and Eileen all sit down at the table while Jody gets out one of the knifes to cut the cake. Before Jody cuts the cake, however, the cake is placed in front of Dean with the candle burning in the center of it. Dean blew out the candle after everyone wished him a happy birthday again.
There were multiple bright lights from curses that were flying her way. Each time a curse came, she threw it off with a protection spell. She was rather good at running and using her wand to defend herself. Which was lucky, because if she wasn't, she would be in deep trouble.
Ellen looked over at the four boys. "Any of you want to help prepare for the big dinner? Got a roast that needs to be ready by seven."
The scrawny man led the students over to the bank of a lake. A bunch of boats sat ready for the students.
"I'm going to go back to the Gryffindor common room, my brother'll be expecting a letter back," Dean says before breaking away from his friends and heading up to the Gryffindor common room.
Cas got in line behind Dean, the pair stood towards the end of the line so they would have to wait a bit for their turn to come. Cas, was honestly, super worried. What if this boggart revealed all his secrets? No, Cas couldn't think about that right now. If he did, then the boggart might become that particular fear. Right now, Castiel just tried to focus on finding something that was truly amusing to him.
The student hesitated before asking her question, "is it true you fought in the Battle of Hogwarts?" She asks.
Cas and Dean got their pajamas on rather quickly upstairs and went back down, excited to start the movie.
"No." John interrupts Dean again. "You. Leave. I'm going to deal with you once we're alone."
Gonna be way more time skips coming up. But not yet.
Cas stands up with him. “Yes, lunch.”
Cas rolled his shoulders like his back was uncomfortable or something. "Castiel is the name of an Angel, actually. My parents are slightly  religious."
"Cas... we've known each other for thirteen years. That's a long time. Before we met, I didn't even believe that angels were real. Because if they were, how could they let everything that happens in the world happen? But then I met you. Everything changed. This is pretty chick-flicky but you have made me so much better as a human. And I never thought that I would want to marry someone because of this hunting life, I never thought that I would get a chance to do that. But I do now. And I want to, Cas I really want to." Dean looks at Castiel. Slowly, he brings out a small box and sinks to one knee. "Castiel, will you marry me?"
"Nice car you have," Castiel compliments, to start a conversation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Garth has Dean move so they are both looking at Cas' back and his wings. Garth motioned for Dean to follow his movements. "So I want you to put your hands like this," Garth instructed Dean. To demonstrate what he meant, Garth stepped back and out stretched his arms so he was an arm's length away from Cas' injured wing.
Cas doesn't respond.
(See the end of the chapter for
If Dean didn't care about Cas when Dean was the only thing that made Cas feel alive, then what was the point of being alive? What was the point of living?
Dean walked over to the light and turned it on before going over and closing the door. “Who’s Sirius?” Dean asks, mentioning Lupin’s mate.
"Decker, Chloe"
It’s September 1st, so happy gotta get back to Hogwarts day!
Cas shook his head, "I appreciate the offer but I don't think that would help much. I've barely spent time in my room and I don't think I'll spend a lot of time in there. And then there's the rest of the day. I can't stretch at all... I'm sorry for pushing this onto you, Professor."
"Just call me Bobby when we aren't in school," the teacher responds.
Cas took the medicine, it didn’t taste as bad as the one the night before, but it still didn’t taste good. Almost immediately, the pain was less intense.
Dean looked up and scanned the Hufflepuff table before spotting Cas. Cas sat hunched over his food. Well, now Dean knows why he's always so quiet. Just at that moment, Cas looked up and locked eyes with Dean. Dean blushed ever so slightly and looked away. At the Hufflepuff table, Cas shrugged and continued on with his meal.
Cas' voice brought Dean out of his thoughts. Dean looked at Sam and Cas. "Yeah, what?"
Dean turned to Lupin, "I can talk to him, Professor," he offered.
With a sharp turn, Dean turned and went to wait for his drink. Castiel's eyes followed him for a few more moments before he forced himself to look away.
Since then Heaven has fallen,
"The guy you saw in your dream last night, you think he's the same guy as the one in the picture?" Dean asks for confirmation.
Cas and Eileen walk arm in arm down the aisle. Since neither of them have their parents present, they decided to go together.
Lupin shook his head, "no. He and I were more than friends. Mates. True mates. He was everything to me."
"Are you okay, bud?" Dean asked him softly.
Dean waits patiently, understanding that whatever Cas has to say, it could be hard to come to terms with. He lets Castiel take his time coming up with the right phrases to use to explain whatever was going on.
Castiel jumps in his seat and looks up over at Jody. "Oh hello," he says sheepishly, his face turning a light shade of pink.
The picture was of a man wearing a blue coat, however the frame was only of his shoulders and above so it couldn't be determined if the coat was long or not.  The man had floofy, light brown hair that curled at the ends. He wore a Hufflepuff-themed scarf. The man looked like he was plucked right out of the early 1900s. He looked distracted and seemed to be working on something below frame. His hands were full so he held his wand between his teeth.
Charlie shrugged. "We've only known that kid for a day or two, we'll get to know him better and find out. I'm hoping it's only him."
"It's the twenty-fourth? Already?" Dean asked, taking the gift and looking at his brother with a confused look.
Like, can he just casually walk up to the teacher table and ask Bobby if one of his friends could come over for the entirety of the holiday break? It would probably seem odd to the other students, but Dean wanted to try.
"Just a slice?" Dean asks, jokingly whining.
"And now?" Castiel asks, "after your father died, is it just the two of you?"
"Hello Dean."
Dean and Cas listened to Charlie speak. Dean had a small smile on his face.
"The Men of Letters, huh?" Gabriel says.
"Finn Calrissian."
Sam and Gabriel were out at the lake while Bobby and Ellen were inside.
Together, Dean and Cas forced themselves to get up and ready for the day ahead of them. Cas got a small spike of energy when he realized what day it was, despite Sam having yelled it few moments before.
"Yanno, he has that same look in his eye when he's with you."
Michael looks over at him. "Castiel actually talked to someone? You must be special or something. But, yes, I am Castiel's older brother. Apologies, he doesn't really talk to people much, it surprised me that he talked to someone on his first day here. Though, I'm glad he did. That kid really needs to socialize himself."
(See the end of the chapter for
Chloe thought for a moment. "Muggle." She looked around at the same ground. "Charlie, would you rather loose the ability to see or the ability to hear?"
Bobby had gotten back to Dean about Cas spending the vacation at his house, he had said yes. Bobby had even asked Michael if Cas could stay, as Bobby knew of the not-so-great household the Novaks lived in. Michael had told Bobby about his life back home, as he trusted the Head of Gryffindor. And although Bobby didn't know what Cas' condition was when Michael told him, he knew he had one. Michael had also agreed to let Cas go. To make it better, Gabriel had decided to go with Castiel to Dean's house too.
“Yeah, really. You’re my friend, deva or not, and if I can help you with being your true mate or whatever, then I’ll do it.” Dean says.
The cursed pure-blood stuck close to Dean, using the half-blood as some sort of protection from all of the unwanted attention. Dean didn't mind, he had to hide the half-smile that grew on his face was Cas started using this particular technique.
Sorry for the chapter delay. School started up like two weeks ago and I haven’t had much time to finish this chapter.
"Cas and I have to work on our holiday homework together," Dean explains. "The teachers gave us quite a bit." Dean looked over at Bobby as Bobby had given a lot of homework.
"Cas is a seeker on the Hufflepuff Quidditch team," Dean announces, knowing that Cas was never going to say it unless asked. "He's the first, first year to be on the team since Harry Potter."
Castiel nodded and stood up before rushing out of the room. It took the Novak a little bit to find the bathroom, but he eventually found one and almost ran inside when he found it. Cas made his way over to one of the stalls. Now, Cas didn't really have to go to the bathroom. He was far more in need of something else.
Just some thanks from the author
"For the next couple of classes, we will be working on a levitation charm. You work this charm by gently flicking your wrist and saying the incantation 'Wingardium Leviosa' while flicking your wrist. Remember to point your wand at the feather, I know it's supposedly common knowledge but you wouldn't know how many students have messed that up."
Then a thought hit Garth. “May I move your wings a little bit?” Garth asks Cas softly. He had an idea of what could be happening and it seemed like his idea was matching up with everything that was happening, he just needed to see proof. Garth had never dealt with a deva in real life, he had only read about them in books. But he had read lots about them, so he knew quite a bit.
Dean smiles. "Get in. Don't worry, I'm not a creep. Not really." He winks as Castiel opens the black car door and steps in.
Apologies for the short chapter.
Breakfast went by pretty quickly, with Cas eating a bit more than usual and talking more than he usually would. The Great Hall had already taken down all the Halloween and fall decorations already. The chatter in the dining hall was a bit quieter as everyone seemed tired from the night before.
The hot chocolates were gone pretty quickly. Now both boys were warmed up a bit from the hot drinks. They decided to go upstairs to Dean's room.
Cas didn't bother hiding his wings, not yet. He trusted the professor, he didn't need to hide from Lupin. He and Dean walked down the stairs to see Bobby opening the door to reveal Lupin standing there. Bobby let Remus in and Lupin thanked him.
"This place is great, Samsquatch. I've never been much of a library person but this is cool," Gabe says, looking at his friend.
But the deva didn't know how much longer he could last without him tearing all of his feathers out. His wings hurt and they itched, and there was really nothing he could do about it because he wasn't his own mate. To add to it all, Cas didn't really know who is mate was. Sure, he had an idea, but he didn't want to go see through with his idea, in fear that the suspected mate would hate him.
"If that wing isn't fixed in ten minutes, we're taking him to the hospital," Bobby says to Garth.
True to the waiter's word, another worker made their way over to the pair's table.
Castiel and Maze nodded at each other in a way of saying "good luck" to the other.
Interrupted and unable to complete the lyrics
Sleep who?
So uhh... filler chapter.
Professor Mills led the students to a large room, before stopping and standing in front of them. "Inside of there is everyone else. Students, teachers and ghosts alike. In a bit, you will be led inside and you will be sorted. You will be sorted into one of four houses. Each house will be like your family for the remainder of your time here at Hogwarts. The four houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin."
"I am fine. Just a bit worried that I won't fit in, that is all," Castiel said, "you do not have to worry about me, Dean, but I appreciate your concern."
A bit confused, Castiel walked over to his father. "Yes?" He asks as he enters the room.
Cas signed his letter before tying it to one of the school birds and sending the bird off. He watched as the owl flew away into the distance before turning and heading back to find his friends.
Bobby went on to explain about different wizards who succeeded in confusing muggle Greece citizens but their plan backfired when Greece muggles started a religion because of it. Some of the wizards found it amusing that the muggles started sacrificing and praying to them, so they continued tricking the muggles.
Charlie was super excited for this party and was talking about her costume options. There weren't many options as the students were allowed to buy costumes and had to use what they already had. Charlie being Charlie, she already had about ten costume ideas.
"The family buisness?" Castiel felt his curiosity spark at that. Didn't the Winchester family buisness end before John Winchester came along? If John Winchester is Dean's father, then how does he know about the family buisness?
"May I go to the bathroom?" Cas asks, sounding urgent.
The pictures were old and crinkled, but still in tact. They were moving pictures, too. Dean looked down at a picture of him, Sammy and both of his parents. Just before his mother died. Dean studied his mother's wide smile and the brightness in all of their eyes. They were still a family back then. Oh what had a changed. Dean took his time, looking at each picture and studying it.
Everyone got out of the car. Ellen went to the trunk of the car and unloaded Dean and Cas' luggage. She handed the bags to them, correctly separating Dean's stuff from Cas'. She also got out Gabriel's things which he had packed in case he needed them.
"No, actually. Sam and I got adopted by one of the Hogwarts teacher. Bobby Singer and his wife Ellen. He teaches History of Magic," Dean explains.
Since Dean had become his mate, Cas realized that his wings were far more sensitive to foreign touch. Gabriel could probably run a hand through his feathers, and it would feel strange.  It was like the only person allowed to touch Cas' wings were Dean.
"Thank you for hosting a great holiday break," Cas says to Bobby and Ellen with a smile.
Cas shook his head. "No. No, Dean, I'm not okay." Cas' voice was even more rougher than usual.
"Mind if I join you?" Dean asks, brining his stuff inside of the compartment.
Before long, Lupin is seated at the table with the four boys. Ellen and Bobby bring out a simple lunch and serve it to the boys and the Professor. It's a small meal as dinner will be quite a feast. For the first few minutes after Lupin's arrival, he and Bobby discuss Hogwarts business. That, however, quickly changes.
Charlie laughs, "yeah, you're right, I'd probably get along with him."
"I think I might go, I haven't decided yet. I could probably throw together a costume. But I won't go if you don't." Dean gave a small smile to his friend.
"Yeah. And you also made free will."
Lucifer Novak would constantly send Cas glares for befriending his sworn archenemy. Although Morningstar said he had no conflict with the other Lucifer.
It didn't take long for the pair to arrive at a nice but not too nice restaurant. Dean parked his Impala and got out. Castiel also exited the nice car. Flattening the trench-coat down, Castiel met back with Dean and together, they entered the restaurant.
"This is a nice home you have here," Lupin compliments, looking over at Bobby and Ellen. The couple thanks him.
Cas has to think a bit on this one. When was there first last night on Earth? And then he remembers it. The strip bar! Dean had tried so hard to get Cas laid, only if he had known that Cas only wanted Dean and no one else.
Opposite of them, on the other side of the table, Garth sat next to the centaur Firenze who teaches Divination, Professor Asa Fox who teaches Muggle Studies, Rufus Turner who teaches Ancient Studies, Donna Hanscum teaches art, muggle art is taught by Katie Bell who sits next to Donna, and then the Earth magic professor, Kelly Kline, then the music teacher Professor Boot and finally the ghoul studies teacher, a Professor Campbell who is a ghost.
"GRYFFINDOR"
But I just want to say thank you to everything and everyone.
Cas only requested one person to visit. But instead, he got two visitors.
Anna hides her face in Cas’ neck. Dean smiles at her, mouthing “awww” at Cas.
"Well it was witches and wizards who came up with flying broomsticks," Charlie says, giving an understanding nod without really knowing what Cas was talking about.
"Does he still- is he still doing it?" Dean asks, his voice and tone quieting down to a more worried  voice.
In front of the teacher table, stood a small, wooden stool with an old hat sitting on top of it. Jody Mills went up to the stool and picked up the hat as well as a scroll.
The next few months passed seemingly quickly. Hufflepuff won a few more Qudditch games. Classes got a bit more difficult and to make things a bit worse, Dean was starting to hang out with Lisa Braedon more.
A silhouette of your wings behind you,
Thinking they couldn't possibly be much longer, Dean decided to walk a few paces away from the door (as to not eavesdrop on whatever the hell they were talking about) and leaned against the wall, waiting for Cas to finish his conversation.
Cas slowly calmed down. When he was fully calm, Dean pulled away and made a move to get up off of the mattress. Cas, however, stopped him, whispering the word, "stay." Dean obeyed Cas and lay down. Cas followed his movements and laid down next to Dean. The deva, once again, wrapped his arms around Dean and soon fell back to sleep.
Castiel nods. "You and Jo were talking about it a little while back. I believe it is what's said when one of us workers feel attracted to a customer, is it not?" The angel's head tilts, suddenly worried that he had messed up and this random phrase meant something entirely different than what he meant.
Vicky Novak.
A tall, beautiful woman steps out of the shadows. "I did," she says. The woman who Dean guesses is Freyja, looks at both Cas and Dean in turn. The woman chuckles. "Well, that was a lucky pick. Two- pardon me- one hunter and an angel! That is a new one. An angel in a male vessel with a human male hunter. I've paired up a few demons and humans, one set of an angel and a human. But never have I got a pair like you two."
Who is bothering him and why are they here?
Madam Hooch told them to get started and the students kicked off the ground, a students only raised themselves about a foot off the ground while others went about six feet off the ground. Madam Hooch watched all of the students carefully. She made many corrections to help the kids stay steady. The teacher went around, giving tips to each student. When she came to Cas and Dean, she only nodded at them and gave a small tip to Dean to keep his hands a bit closer to him.
Castiel knocked on the office door and Lupin opened it, looking at Castiel with a confused look.
Castiel bows his head, ashamed that Dean found out before Cas could do it.
Ishim growls and walks away, leaving Cas and Dean alone.
"Isn't it rude to stare?" Castiel hushedly hisses at his friends.
them, no, he hated them. He just couldn’t bare the feeling of someone else touching the marks of where his father previously carved into his wings.
"He's cute!" Jo exclaims.
Castiel cracks a small smile. Dean had heard his discussion with the other workers. Castiel gave a quick glance over back at Gabriel, who was giving him an encouraging nod, Castiel then answered, "I get off my shift in an hour."
Dan looked over Castiel's figure. He seemed to be thinking for a moment before he turned to Donna. "Yes, he could work well. He could work quite well. Thank you, Professor."
But in return, you replaced his life with yours
Cas walks over and sits down in the other beanbag. “Oh yeah, these are comfortable,” he says, trying one for himself.
"Yes. But not terribly. It should be an easy fix." Garth pauses. "Dean, I think I'm going to have to teach you and Cas how the deva healing process works."
"I know..." Cas looked nervous.
Sam slowly took Gabriel to the back. The slow pace was to allow Gabe look around at all the books and decor. Eventually they reached the back. Sam turned and Gabriel followed him, now more curious than ever as to what Sammy would be showing him.
"Sam, Dean," Bobby looked at the two Winchesters. "It's for you."
They were both happy with the other and everything was good.
The hunter nods, silently asking him to go on.
“What are you talking about? They match your eyes perfectly!” Sirius says, grinning.
Castiel chuckled under his breath. Gabriel was two years younger him, Balthazar only a year younger than Gabe and Anna was five.
"I assume so. I know a curse that can turn someone into a deva, a winged human. And devas have mates." Lupin looked at him for a second. "Is that about the boy you were talking to?"
When Castiel found the classroom, a bunch of other students had already beat him to it. One of the students was Dean. Cas couldn't help the spark of joy that lit in his stomach when he saw Dean sitting there.
Cas looked around the Panic Room. “Now we don’t have to be apart,” Cas said softly. “Unless you get sick of me, then you are free to go. But I think I’m going to stay here. It’s a nice room and I don’t have to worry about hiding from anyone inside here.”
Castiel gave her the four sickles to pay for Charlie's candy choice. Charlie thanked him after the candy witch disappeared. Castiel said that it was nothing.
Dean didn't quite understand what Cas was meaning by 'this', this what? He looked perfectly human to him. Besides for the costume, but it's Halloween, so Dean didn't even think that 'this' meant Cas' wings.
//homemade mood board/aesthetic for this book. Just thought it would fit nicely.\\
you since the day I first met you. You taught me to love the world, to love humanity. Maybe you made me more human than any angel before The Fall, but you made me stronger too. Dean, you helped me to be better. And I-I know you don't feel the same; but just know that even if you don't love yourself, there is someone who does."
There was a loud sound from above. A couple of the muggle-borns jumped at the new sound. Everyone looked up as a swarm of owls came in to the Great Hall through an opening somewhere in the ceiling.
“That would be nice. I will have to ask my family before I get you an answer though,” Cas says.
"Yes, it is. Open the present."
Back in the classroom, Castiel walked back over to Dean. Dean looked up and smiled over to Cas, Cas smiled back and sat down next to his friend.
"Are you supposed to be a lumber jack?" Charlie asked, confused about Dean's costume.
After some time, they finished up their small amount of food. Together, the two angels threw their trash out.
Bobby and Ellen came running out from inside of the house. The couple ran over to Dean, who was kneeling beside Cas. Castiel was writhing in pain. His wing had been bent at a bad angle.
Dean copied Garth's movements, standing about the same distance away from Cas.
Okay, here we go!
Meg smiled. "Good job, Clarence. Before Potter, no one else had managed to do that in more than one hundred years."
Madam Hooch separated the class in half, allowing the first half of the students to pair up and practice flying while the other half went with Madam Hooch to practice the basics.
We’ve stood together
With some uncertainty, Cas tapped Dean's shoulder. "Dean. We... we need to talk. Alone."
Dean and Charlie were getting more excited by the moment. Charlie was almost jumping up and down. Castiel, however, looked slightly worried.
As the line went on, the boggart was turned into multiple things. A very evil looking dentist to a bubblegum bird that flew around. A vicious dog to a small, fluffy kitten. A small cyclone to a weird looking frog face (the muggles know it as Pepe the Frog, the meme).
Cas nods, "oh, okay."
The group ignored the kid. "The ability to hear," Charlie replies eventually. "Winchester! Would you rather kiss a boy or kiss a girl?"
“Now, devas are a very peculiar sub-species of humans. Just like werewolves-” Garth’s wife is a werewolf- “devas have mates in life. Their subconscious mind finds someone who is compatible enough to be their mate and latches on to that person, that person then becomes in their mate. It most situations, for devas, after they set their sights on a mate, they have to do everything they could usually do with any other person that involves their wings with their mate or else it won’t work. For instance, cleaning and preening your wings will not work unless it’s your mate doing it. Another thing is, after getting a mate, the deva will go into a sort of heat. Though, that only happens when one is of-age, so you won’t have to worry about that.”
Sam looked between his brother and Castiel. "Yeah, let's step outside."
Dean nods. “Don’t feel like you have to show me this ‘side’ of yours, only do it when and if you feel comfortable enough, okay?”
Curious as to where the trail of petals leads, Cas follows the red colored petals carefully.
No one else raised their hands, or wands. Lupin nods after a moment. He looks out at the silent class.
"Then we'll go. Just don't disappear on me mid-way through, okay?" Cas decided for the both of them.
“Is that a flirtation?” Cas asks jokingly.
Quidditch!
Before long, Jack comes back into the room. He joins the two of them, not bringing much attention to himself.
“Quite a family you’ve got,” Dean says to Cas.
The strip bar is still there and it looked the same as it did when he and Dean visited it all those years ago.
Also notice that Castiel’s room number is 41, which is the episode number Misha’s Castiel first appeared. 4x1, Lazarus Rising.
"You'll just have to wait and see," Sam replies with a smirk.
About once a week, Michael would check in on Cas to make sure his younger brother was doing well with both school and his secret. Each time, Castiel would respond the same, saying that he was doing just fine and he didn't need Michael to worry about him. But Michael kept checking in, and Cas, honestly, didn't mind it, knowing that he had a good older brother at his side who cared enough to check in on him once a week.
You were an angel’s angel
Meg Masters - TJ McGibbon
You were so different back then.
Castiel had pulled Gabriel aside before their first day. "Gabriel, I-" he starts.
Gabe smiles up at his brother. "Heya Cassie. This is a new coat you've got. It fits you." Gabriel walked around Cas so the Winchesters could see him and he could see the Winchesters.
Finally, Castiel spotted a blur of gold. He had spotted the snitch! He dived after it, keeping an eye on the fast moving snitch. Cas speeded up to catch the snitch. Sturry had caught on by now and was close behind Cas. The snitch turned sharply, and Cas followed it with little struggle. Though Sturry did take an extra few seconds to change his decoration.
However, before he could disappear and join the other Hufflepuffs, Dean stopped him by grabbing his wrist. Cas looked back at Dean, confused.
Castiel Novak - Aidan Gallagher
Slowly and tiredly, the pair got ready for the day. They changed out of their pajamas into clothes. Cas kept his wings out as the two of them walked downstairs.
It was the night before the holiday break. Tests had just been completed in multiple different classes to "see how far everyone has gotten". The students were all tired and ready for a long break. The Holiday break lasted three weeks. Starting about a week before Christmas Day and ending just after New Years Day.
If Castiel could stretch his wings out further, he would. But he had a 12 foot wing-span and he could not risk his wings being spotted by any passing student. So, he tried his best to improvise by bending his wings around the walls of the stall. It didn't work. Instead, his plan caused more pain.
"Hope so," Cas says.
Platform 9 3/4 is filled with families waiting to reunite with their children. There's loud chatter that fills the wizarding platform. Cas rolls his shoulders back, not at all liking the noise. Cas sticks close to his friends and the trio zigzag their way through the crowd.
Inside this room, there were two comfortable looking muggle beanbags as well as two tables. On one of the tables, there was a light. On the other table, there was a small wizard clock that was set to alarm at the same time the rest of school got up. Lupin swished his wand and an old looking, knitted blanket came flying from somewhere down the hall to his hands.
The deva smiled back. "Thanks, Charlie. You look amazing in your costume."
The app was only accessible to open after a few simple tests. An appearance check, a voice password and reaction test to silver.
Dean grins at his brother. "How about we go visit Bobby's place? Word is likely already spreading that you've arrived. There's probably going to be a huge 'Welcome to Heaven' party set up. We'll get to see the friends that we haven't seen in a long time," the older brother suggests.
"Dean!" Charlie called, having apparently spotted the boy.
Dean listened to Cas speak. Cas practically just told him, what Dean thinks to be, his darkest secret. Dean was glad that Cas trusted him enough to tell him this.
Mylie apologizes to Cas and Dean once again before placing their clothes on floor before disappearing with a snap of her fingers.
The petals lead to room 7B, which was opened. The petals led to the bookshelf. Knowing that there is something behind the bookshelf, Castiel cautiously pushes the bookshelf out of the way.
“Thanks, Sirius,” Lupin growls sarcastically.
Cas came back to his room and gathered the stuff he would need for the day. Though not really knowing what to bring and what not to bring for the first day, Castiel grabbed his Potions, DADA, and Charms book as well as his wand.
“When I was at school, Sirius and I found this room. We found it completely by accident. We had panicked and were searching for a way to escape one of the teachers. Because of the way we found it, we decided to call it ‘the panic room’. Over the course of our years the Hogwarts, we spend so much time in there, just the two of us. We brought down those beanbags and the tables. It was mainly used for a space where we could be alone together. Now that I no longer have a use for it, I think you two would benefit from having it. I don’t believe anyone has been here in years. It’s all yours.” Lupin smiled sadly to himself.
Lysander went on to introduce each member of the two teams. "The Hufflepuffs have two new players, Jae White, the keeper and Castiel Novak, the seeker."
Cas went to the stall and changed out of his school uniform. He kept his white shirt on as well as his Hufflepuff tie and his school pants on but took off the rest. Cas slid on his trench-coat and pulled it tight over his body. With a roll of his shoulders, Cas' wings appeared. Both sets, four wings. Cas looked over his shoulder at them. He inhaled deeply and stepped out of the bathroom stall.
"May I see the mark you found on the bodies? I want to check to see if it's another Cupid." Castiel requests to see the mark.
"I'm not a monster, sweetheart."
The Novak shakes his head. Cas looks around. There's no one around. Cas lets his wings phase through his clothes. "I mean it's literally natural for me to be flying."
Charlie and Castiel smiled at him. "I'm Charlie," Charlie greeted him, "and this is Cas." She introduces the two of them to Blaine.
Dean gives a small laugh. "Jack rebuilt it so everyone shared the same Heaven. Dad's here (though I haven't brought myself to visit him yet), Mom, Bobby, our Charlie, Jo, Ellen, everyone. They're all here. Plus, Jack made it so monsters could also have the chance to come here or Hell, though most still go to Purgatory.  And... Cas helped too."
Both Dean and Cas turn. Dean grins when he spots his little brother. "Hiya, Sammy. Miss me?" Dean asks, walking over to Sam and taking Cas along with him.
"Hmmm... top," Gabe answers. "The top always seems more fun." Gabriel throws one of his bags onto the top bunk. Sam's own stuff was already on the bottom bunk.
"Cas, buddy, you okay in there?" Dean asks, standing outside of Castiel's stall.
“Your wings are pretty, Cas. I don’t know how anyone could see them and think otherwise,” Dean comments with a soft smile.
Dean smiles proudly. "Thanks. Decorated it all by myself."
Lupin frowned, trying to decided what to do to help his poor student. "Do you think you can last through the pain a bit longer? Long enough for me to fetch Professor Fitzgerald. He should know the most about whatever is happening with your wings. Unless you don't want me to tell him?" He let Cas decide.
Cas copied his movements and stood up, stretching a bit. His wings reappeared on his back, stretching out to their full extent.
Cas had been waiting for that question to pop up. The angel shuffles in his chair a bit. "Angels and demons, when they are sent to the Empty, they are forever forced to dream about their regrets."
The blonde woman behind Meg turned when she hears Gabriel say the pair needed a job. "Well, we're hiring now. I'm sure Meg here wouldn't mind having you two around. I'm Jo, by the way." She introduces herself with a warm smile.
"Today," Cas replies almost immediately.
There's no mention of what Castiel said before he let the Empty take him. That just isn't a topic that the two want to discuss just yet.
Dean, Cas, Charlie and now Dorothy, Meg and Maze all were ready to claim their sleeping bags the moment the set-up changed. They all got into sleeping bags in the far corner so they could discuss things away from everyone else. They were the first to arrive but they didn't give a damn.
Freyja laughs. "Wow, this is better than I thought." She flicks her hand. "Good luck!" She says with a smile before both Dean and Cas reappeared on the road.
Castiel looks surprised. His facial expression is blank for a moment, before a smile forms on his lips. "Yes, I will."
The boys took of their shoes, coats and scarves. Cas also took off his trench-coat, as that had gotten covered in snow as well.
The pair of them talked for a bit, catching up on what Cas had missed. Dean kept mentioning how Cas was lucky as he got to skip classes because he was sick. The Winchester jokingly complained about how everything is terrible and school sucks when they both know it’s not that bad overall.
"I know." Jack pauses. "I just wanted to give you my gift after you were visited by everyone else."
"Can we ask Bobby for the mattress?" Cas asks.
Blaine nods, "welcome. You'll love it here at Hogwarts. It takes a bit to get used to everything, but it gets easier later. You learn loads here, it's really interesting."
"Dean Winchester."
Triggers: slight angst, thoughts of self-harm (almost does- but it's stopped)
Dean realizes he isn't yet alone when he senses a presence behind him. Dean turns, once again taking out his angel blade in self defense. Sam, Eileen and Jody had just left, so who is bothering him now? Can't they just leave Dean alone?
"Dean, do you want to make the burgers or would you rather risk me making them so you two can hang out more?" Sam asked, raising an eyebrow and smiling at his older brother.
Castiel gives the man the cost and in return, he gets a few dollars in cash that was enough to pay for the drink. "Name?" Castiel asks for the man's name so he would know when his drink would be ready and which one would be his.
Cas didn't hand in any papers last Tuesday, but he nodded, already knowing what Lupin was going to talk to him about.
She was running and running fast. Her wand was out and she has a black cloak over her shoulders. Her black, crazy hair whipped in the wind as she ran.
Gabriel was quiet for a few moments. "So you made a friend in school?" He asked, a few seconds later.
Eventually, it was time to get onto the Hogwarts Express. Bags were all packed and the students were back in their causal muggle-world clothes. Dean, Castiel, Meg, Charlie and Maze all packed into one train apartment. The train ride back to King's Crossed seemed to go by quicker than when they first came to Hogwarts.
The witch thought for a moment. "In my opinion, fizzing whizbees are rather great. I suggest that you should try that. And I will be back through if you want something else."
This made Dean smile. "Yeah, I pretty much raised him. Our father... he almost was never there for us, so I had to take care of him. We have a good relationship." Dean looks at Dr. Whoo, thinking about his younger brother.
Dean circled around Castiel, smiling at his friend. Cas grinned back and started to chase Dean around. The two of them laughed and raced. Castiel quickly caught up to Dean and managed to tap his shoulder before calling "got you!"
"Right!" Lupin clapped his hands together. "Let's get started, shall we? Now, I'm sure you all are wondering why I borrowed Professor Moseley's desk. And I did borrow it for a certain reason." Lupin paused for dramatic effect. "Inside of this desk, there is a boggart. Now boggarts can be tricky little devils. This is because they take form of whatever we fear most when it faces us. However, they can be repelled with just one simple charm. The incantation for this little spell is 'riddikulus'. Now, to really over throw a boggart, you need to have laughter. So when you cast this spell,  picture something you find genuinely amusing and that boggart should change into what you picture."
Dean was just about to go grab his new broom so he could join his friend up in the air, when Cas suddenly lost control for no apparent reason. Cas came tumbling down from about five meters in the air. And landed right on his right wings.
"Shorter one or taller one?" The blonde asks.
Lunch came and went rather quickly before Cas was pulled aside by Dan and asked to meet him and the rest of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team. (Mazikeen had already left to joined the Slytherins.) Cas said bye to his friends before following Dan.
Castiel watched as Gabriel walked off to go back to their small apartment Ellen got them. It was around midday now. The trench-coated figure looked around. A frown crosses his face when he doesn't see Dean. He doesn't even know if the human is going to show up or not.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas takes his clothes. "No, I don't mind. I'll change in the corner opposite of you." Cas makes his way over to one corner while Dean goes over to the other. The two of them change into their school uniforms. They make sure the other is finished changing before both turning and meeting back in the center of the room.
"Bitch, do you know me and my type? The taller one!"
"How'd it go?" The question was asked the moment Castiel stepped behind the counter.
John Winchester stood, a ghost of a beard on his face. The elder Winchester's eyes found Castiel beside Dean. "Who is this?" He asked and Castiel could hear harshness in his tone. So much for being welcome at this house.
Castiel shakes his head, "no. I did not get expelled. Or in trouble, actually. Professor Hanscum, I think that's her name, just asked me to be on the Hufflepuff Quidditch Team! The team captain and I will be meeting up out here after lunch."
Sometimes, even to this day, those terrible words would float around Cas’ head and the poor kid would do his best to stop those thoughts, but it sometimes just wouldn’t work.
And so, an hour or two later, Cas and Dean were in the backyard. The backyard was surrounded by walls of tall bushes, so it wasn't likely that Cas would be seen.
The younger Winchester sighs. He reaches into his coat and takes out a gift wrapped item. He hands it to his older brother, "happy birthday, Dean."
About halfway through the movie, Cas fell asleep on Dean's shoulder. Dean smiled softly over at Cas. Though Dean wouldn't admit it, Cas was really adorable. Even when he was practically drooling on Dean's shoulder.
Dean felt his throat tighten up. For so long he had kept this a secret. And now he was finally telling Cas, he couldn't find his voice to finish up his speech.
Each student says the incantation, others with a lot of hesitation, some with confidence. No one was able to get the feather to float more than a foot off the ground, but at least a couple students got it moving a few inches.
Cas let out a whimper as he pulled his wings back and folded them close to his back. He heard the door open, which made Cas jump. Quickly, Castiel hid his wings, making them disappear. But, doing that made Cas let out a quiet sound of pain.
Garth walked slowly over to Cas, going over to the boy's side to notify him that he was there. Cas looked up at Garth when he spotted him. His wings, on instinct, pulled close to Cas' back, which made the boy wince in pain.
His wand was rather pretty. It was apple wood, 12 1/4 inches, and Phoenix feather. His wand was slightly bendy and Cas had been told it would do better dueling and was quite loyal to it's owner, so that was good.
Elsewhere, Dean Winchester was getting his own schedule for school. He and the other new Gryffindors stood in the red-themed Gryffindor common room. When he got his schedule, Dean looked over it, mentally trying to prepare for whatever classes he had to do tomorrow. First he would have Herbology with Professor Longbottom (he almost snickered at the name), and then Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, and flying lessons. Dean, honestly, couldn't wait to do flying lessons. Though he was scared of the muggle version of flying (planes or just free-falling), Dean rather loved using a broom. Unlike on a muggle plane, Dean felt like he could control his movements on a broom. And, oh, how he loved the feeling of flying free.
"U-uh, this is Casti-"
"No, you don't need to be sorry, Dean. You couldn't do anything, Dean. The Empty made it so I could almost never see the light of day again. It was luck that Jack managed to make that deal of me for Lucifer," Cas says.
After all the students had arrived in the classroom and sat down, Bobby started the class.
"There's a student, Castiel Novak, he's a deva and his wings are in a lot of pain right now for some reason. I don't know what's going on with him, but I thought that perhaps you would have an idea?" Lupin explained rather quickly.
"I don't know who that man is. And neither does my friend. However, he does recognize him from... something." Dean looks at Cas. "He doesn't know his name, but Castiel suspects that this man had also cursed his mother. We don't know if it is actually the same man or not, but I think that may help as a lead?"
Dean immediately hugs him back. They stay there for a bit, just enjoying being back together.
Dean smiles. The Winchesters pats the winged Wizard's shoulder before walking off with Lisa to go to the stands.
The brothers were working on a case in California. And so far, they had no idea what they were facing or what they were facing was after. As of yet, there were four dead of a mysterious cause. Sam and Dean had managed to check out two of the latest victims. On both of them, there was some sort of mark. The mark was placed in different spots on the victims, so they couldn't yet find a pattern for that. The symbol was three swirls connected that sized at about an inch.
Garth nodded immediately. "Show me to him, there's no time to waste. A deva's wings can be very fragile if not taken care of properly."
The last class of Defense Against the Dark Arts, they got to create their own, fake, curse and explain what the curse does, what it helps with and what the reverse charm is. It had been pretty fun, because it seems a lot of students in this class have very creative minds.
Dean smiles at Gabe. "I'll make sure he gets it, don't worry. And Gabriel?" Dean makes sure Gabriel is looking at him before continuing. "You're a good kid."
Each of the Novak children learned how to take care of themselves since Chuck was never there. Chuck was always passed out or quite drunk in his bedroom. Of course the other boys did their best to make sure that Anna, Balthazar and Gabriel were never left to fend for themselves until they were ready.
Cas' favorite gift out of the four he got was probably the book from Lupin. The book he received was a detailed, informative book on devas that was at least four hundred pages long. Though it was likely a boring read, it would certainly help Cas understand how take care of his deva self a bit better.
"I don't know either!"
When the Hogwarts Express arrived at King's Cross, the Novak siblings were all there waiting for their older brothers to come back.
Something turns in Cas' stomach. He feels his invisible wings ruffle at the thought for Dean with that Lisa Braedon. Cas didn't like her before and now, he just hates her.
Sam and Gabriel were currently elsewhere. They were having a good ole time at the lake. The lake was mostly frozen over, but there were some parts of the water that had melted. The ice that was still there was thin.
The Winchester was currently thinking about what he could write back in response to his younger brother's letter. In the honest truth, Dean was having a hard time adjusting to his new life at Hogwarts, without his brother. Though he did his absolute best not to show it.
When Castiel told Meg, he was surprised that she took it quite well. Though he could tell, a small part of her was hurt, she didn't take it the wrong way and was just glad that she would get to hang out with Castiel and possibly become friends with him.
Garth walked over. "First, kiddos, I need you all to take a step back." His eyes landed on Dean and his intertwined hand with Cas'. "Except you, you can stay." Dean nods and stays by Cas' side while everyone else moves back to give them space.
Sam left them alone as he went to go gather up some food that he hoped dearly was still there because he was, honestly, starving. The younger Winchester hoped that the pair would talk and discuss the huge ass elephant in the room. Dean had told Sam what happened before Cas was taken. Of course it was about a week after the event, but Dean still told him. Dean had told Sam everything. Sam, of course, accepted him and told him that it wasn't going to change the way Sam viewed him.
Just as Michael prepared the meal, Chuck called in to them. There was the familiar smell of alcohol around the house. "Castiel, boy, come here," Chuck orders from the living room.
"Should we take him to the wizarding hospital?" Dean asks, knowing that the muggles working at a muggle hospital would flip if they saw a human with actual wings coming in.
They walked to the Grand Staircase where multiple, smaller staircases were moving around and connecting rooms to other rooms.
Amara was silenced as the angel the two celestial siblings had just discussed walk in. Castiel, in his dirty trench-coat, walked over to his adopted son. "Jack" had given all the remaining angels their wings back. But even with his wings back and complete, Castiel was never going to be the angel he once was.
Dean lightly traced a scar on Cas' wing. That scar led Dean to other scars. Slowly, Dean discovered more and more of Castiel's scars. Cas was tense. He knew that Dean had spotted the marks on his two bigger wings.
Dean and Sam look at Cas expectantly. Both brothers wanted to know what they were dealing with so no one else would get injured or killed. Cas looks at them in turn. "It's not an angel, it's a goddess. This certain mark is used by multiple gods. But with what you tell me about the victims and what they were doing before they died, I suspect it is the mark of Freyja, the Norse Goddess of love."
The fire was blazing in the fireplace. The fire lit up and warmed the whole room as well as the guests in it. There was chat between the guests. The teachers all talked together and Ellen would occasionally add to the conversations. Cas and Dean sat together at the corner of the couch. The two boys didn't speak much, they mainly listened
