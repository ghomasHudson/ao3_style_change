“I love you, too,” Dean whispered in Castiel’s ear, giving him a quick peck to the temple before turning to face their family. “So,” Dean clapped his hands together, “who wants to play Santa and hand out the gifts.”
“Anything for you, my Omega.” Dean gave Castiel one more kiss before he pushed up and sat back on his haunches. The Alpha added a third finger and watched in awe as his Omega’s body welcomed them. Dean pumped them in and out, making sure to crook them just right every so often to strike Castiel’s prostate. The Alpha’s cock hung hard and heavy between his legs, but he didn’t give a single thought to touching it; he was too lost in providing his Omega pleasure. The sight before him of his mate twisting in rapture against the sheets, his mouth open in a silent moan, and a fine sheen of sweat breaking out over his skin… well, Dean had never seen a more perfect sight. He slid his fingers in deep and teased Castiel’s prostate, loving the delicious sounds it drew from the Omega’s lips.
“You gonna let us in or what,” Claire asked through chattering teeth, breaking the silence. “It’s colder than a witches tit in a brass bra out here.”
“This is gonna be cold,” Dean warned before he pressed the wipe to Castiel’s back. The Omega hissed and flinched as Dean ran it over each and every scrape and cut, pulling out a few bits of dirt and gravel. Dean winced quietly in sympathy, something he wasn’t used to; he took care of sick and hurt people on the daily, and while he had compassion for things they were going through, none of it ever made his stomach flip and his heart ache that he was causing them pain -- despite the pain being necessary. Maybe that was the difference between caring about someone’s wellbeing and caring about someone…
“Fuck, Dean,” Benny swore beneath his breath, reaching for Dean’s arms and pulling up his sleeves to look at the damage Lucifer’s nails caused. He waited for Benny to say something, but the Omega just shook his head and pulled his sleeves back down. “You’re a fucking moron.”
Castiel opened his mouth to retort when a loud bang in the hallway cut him off. It was followed by another, then another, he jumped and wrapped his arms around Dean, clinging to his Alpha tightly as he whispered, “What was that?”
His brother, Sam, thought he’d lost his mind a little bit. His friends and associates just thought he was burned out and would sit on a beach for a few months before coming back to real life as they called it. And his Uncle Bobby, just thought he’d gone plumb loco—his words.
King Triton hummed in agreement before clearing his throat to gain everyone’s attention. “Now that you have chosen to remain among us, proven yourself a warrior by rescuing my son, the time has come for Rowena to bless you as a true Atlantian and a warrior. To make your weapon a part of you, give you the ability to call it forth as needed.” He stared down at the younger Alpha, “Are you ready?”
lithe hips with, little Omega.” His pearly whites glinting in the moonlight as his canines lengthened.
“Alright, alright,” Dean called back as he cuddled closer to Castiel. “We’re done, get your panties out of a twist and get some sleep, Sammy.”
“Cas, Cas baby, you feel so good,” Dean mouthed against his throat, rolling his hips and twisting his fist around the head of Castiel’s cock. “Come for me baby, I want to feel you come on my knot.”
“Here kitty, kitty, kitty,” Arthur cooed as he stepped closer, pausing at the bottom step. He poured a mound of treats into his hand and held it out to the cat. “Come here you stupid cat,” the Alpha sing-songed sweetly.
Castiel’s hot hard cock throbbed as Dean’s hand enclosed around it. The Alpha stroked his Omega slowly at first, covering his length with the precome that was dripping from his slit. Once Castiel’s cock was slick Dean began to stroke him at the same maddening pace the Omega was riding him.
Dean snarled and clenched his omega’s hips and as he rutted forward his knot expanded, swelling to completion. His cock throbbed and emptied hot and wet inside his mate, filling him with wave after wave of his seed. Castiel shook and moaned as the head of Dean’s cock pressed insistently against his prostate, causing him to come untouched, his dick jerking and painting the bed in thick bursts of cum.
is as serious about your walk with God as you are, helping you discover his will for all areas of your life, including relating to your family, dealing with friends, work, sports, Alphas, and so much more.” He glanced over at Gabriel, “I don’t…” Castiel trailed off and shook his head. “What is this brother?”
Dean opened his mouth to answer just as the oven timer dinged. Castiel yelped and spilt his coffee on the countertop. The Alpha let out a loud bark of laughter as he tossed his mate a roll of paper towels. Dean heard his Omega mumble ‘ass’ as he watched as Castiel begin to sop up the mess. Dean smirked at the disgruntled look on his Omega’s face as he slipped on an oven mitt before opening the stove and pulling out a tray of gooey pumpkin and apple turnovers.
“Yeah,” Dean licked his lips before drawing the bottom one in between his teeth, clearly thinking. “Okay, I got a plan. You're gonna go answer the door and tell them you're a maintenance man. Tell them there has been reports of a gas leak and you are checking the cabin. Then tell them to go to the main lobby and wait in the sitting area and that you will come get them when you're done.” The alpha met Castiel’s eyes, “Can you handle that?”
Dean raised an eyebrow and lowered his fork. “Oh yeah?” he asked, smiling at his mate’s excitement. “I’m ready for that!”
Lucifer’s stomach flipped as he remembered looking down at the yellow prescription bottle Ellen had on the table before them. He shook his head immediately, Castiel stiffening beside him. Father Metatron wouldn’t have
As she swam into the room, Finn flitted past her and launched himself in Castiel’s arms. The Omega smiled and ran his hand down the slope of his pet’s back. Finn had been especially clingy ever since Dean and Castiel had decided to spend some time on land. The sea lion followed them everywhere, and at night wiggled between them in the nest. It was as if Finn
“No offense, Mom,” Dean stopped chopping the celery for his stuffing to meet her eyes and smirked, “but you could burn water.”
“We need to get you a ring that matches,” Castiel leaned back against his mate as he lifted his left hand and admired his ring.
.” Castiel squeezed Dean’s hands tightly. “Yes, there’s a part of me that enjoys being a hunter because I want to help people, but I would give it up in a heartbeat to live a long, happy, human life with you.”
“Can you help me?” William asked again. “I don’t want to risk hurting anyone else. I can’t bear the thought... and I want my suffering to end. I want to pass over, to go to Hell where I deserve to be for what I did to my family. And, if possible, I want to help that poor young man Abigail has spelled. He doesn’t deserve that, he deserves a chance at
“Whiskey and brownies?” Bobby asked, throwing his hands up in a surrendering gesture at the glower it earned him. “Okay, Irish coffee comin’ up. So,” he reached for the pot and began to fill the mugs, “how do you know for sure Dean and Cas are having sex?”
Jo smiled and shifted so she was sitting beside him again, leaning her head onto his shoulder. The air around them was cool, but the blanket was keeping them warm enough. After a moment, Lucifer started rocking them slowly again.
Castiel hummed in agreement. “The first few weeks of summer break is like that for me.” The Omega plucked another bunch of weeds from in between his rhododendron bushes. “It’s like I don't know what to do with myself.”
“Dean,” Cas groaned, his fingers sliding into the Alpha’s hair and tugging gently. “Get back up here.”
“Castiel, Lucifer,” Dean snorted at the names despite having heard them before, earning him a death-glare from Bobby, “this pack of animals is Dean, Joanna, and Sam.”
. When he, Castiel, Sam and Jo had finally made their way outside to help carry all of the food and coolers, he had nearly stopped in his tracks on the back porch. There were five folding tables set up, decked out with plastic red and white checkered tablecloths, large tubs in the center already filled with paper plates, napkins, plastic cutlery, and condiments.
“I trust your instincts, Dean.” She pressed a kiss to his forehead. “You’re turning into such an amazing young man, and I’m so glad to be around to see it happening.”
“Don’t worry about it,” the Omega impishly grinned up at his mate. “We can always reheat it after...” Cas trailed off and spread his legs, letting his Alpha settle between them as he bared his throat again for Dean’s lips attention.
Castiel hummed as he smiled back, his Alpha thought Atlantis had been the most amazing place he’d traveled. That made the Omega feel a twinge of hope. If Dean liked it so much, maybe, just maybe, he would be willing to stay there with Castiel. Make Atlantis his new home. But then there was the Alpha’s family. Would he be willing to leave them behind for him?
“My mother always told me never talk to strangers.” Castiel narrowed his eyes. “Especially if they were Alphas.”
The cat licked its lips and grumbled before abandoning it’s stoop to see what was going on. Dean watched as he sidled up to her and batted at the string. After a few minutes, Amara moved to kneel, but the cat jumped back, eyeing her warily. “It’s okay,” she promised as she paused in her movements and shook the string again. “You can trust me.”
“You know,” Dean started as he glanced over at his Omega, “last night wasn’t the first time I heard you sing.”
“Don’t know.” Gabe shrugged. “That all depends on William here.” He looked over at the spirit. “What do you want first, William?”
“Bite me!” Dean yelled back, twisting out of the way and storming across the living room to the front door. “Everyone in this fucking house can
“Dean,” Castiel drew in a sharp breath, his rhythm faltering as his mate’s fingertips grazed his prostate. The unexpected touch sent a delicious shiver throughout his body.
“Would you truly be happy with only a few hours here and there throughout their remaining years?” Castiel asked softly. “Because remember, Dean, if you choose this life you will age differently, you will watch them all die.” The Omega’s fingers gently scratched Dean’s scalp as he pressed on before his mate had a chance to answer. “What about your home? I know you said last night that you owned your cottage outright, but what about property taxes? I once read in the Atlantian library that you are required to pay taxes on the land you own. How are you going to do that from Atlantis?”
“That’s the Crystal Cave,” Castiel replied after a quick glance at the grotto. “I use to play there with friends, when I was a youngling.”
bed. It taunted him with its one floral comforter, and the pillows that were in such close proximity of each other, and —
He grabbed onto the table just to ground himself, to steady his shaking hands. Truth be told he was still reeling that his father pulled his trident and threatened his true mates life, or that he would have looked at him with such disapproval in his eyes. How was he going to get through to his father? How could he prove that the Gods choose Dean for him for a reason.
Dean growled again, his inner Alpha howling inside of him, and he knew he couldn’t deny his Omega anything. He slipped his hand beneath the waistband of Castiel’s shorts, groaning at the slick coating his fingers. He circled Castiel’s slick soaked rim with two fingers, pressing gently against him. “So wet for me, baby,” he whispered, finding Castiel’s lips again and claiming them.
“No,” Castiel shook his head, reaching for Lucifer’s hand and gripping it tightly in his own, “something is
“Because,” Jo replied, exasperated, and dropped two more into the pail, “it gets us out of kitchen duty. You and Castiel were excited to help this morning, but you two have no idea the sheer, utter
“That you did, Alpha,” Castiel purred as he wiggled underneath Dean until he had turned and was now facing him. The Omega reached up and wrapped his arms around the Dean. “I’m all yours,” Castiel whispered as he pulled Dean into a very heated kiss.
“May we come and sit?” Bobby asked, looking between the two teenagers and waiting for Dean’s nod before stepping into the room. He pulled out the desk chair, holding onto the back of it as Ellen took a seat, giving them a small smile. Bobby took a step back, leaning against the wall and crossing his arms.
Dean stared out his window and into the room directly across from his. Cas’ bedroom. His inner Alpha practically howled when he saw the light switch on and Cas walk into his room. The Omega was beautiful with his dark brown hair, bright blue eyes, and lithe little body that his wolf wanted to lick and mark all over.
Castiel took a deep shuddering breath as Dean continued to rut inside him, his cock trapped between their stomachs, getting the most glorious friction. The alpha clutched his mate’s hips tight and shoved in deep, striking his prostate. The omega let out a low groan as his cock pulsed between their bodies, he could feel the hot, slick spread of his cum between them soaking their chests as he came untouched.
“You gonna close that door,” Dean teased as he removed his jacket and hung it on the hook by the door, before walking further into the living area. “You're letting all the warm air out.”
Dean stared at him, knowing his eyes were wide as he listened to Castiel say everything he never thought he would. “I…” Dean whispered, voice breaking, and he cleared his throat before starting again. “I didn’t hit my head on that gravestone, right?”
“Ohhhh,” Dean whispered softly as he watched the younglings. He chuckled softly as he watched a little girl grip one of the larger sea turtle’s hind flippers. He watched as the aquatic animal zipped and zagged, pulling her along for a ride.
he can get pregnant as an Omega? Does he even know what he’s doing? I don’t know how much he’s discussed with Doctor Shurley about his sexual health but-”
“Cas,” Dean whispered as he reached up and pried his mate’s hand from the shell. He held it in his own as he rubbed his finger along the indentation left behind by the shell he’d clasped so hard. “Not that this necklace doesn’t look good on you, but why are you still wearing it?” Dean’s eyes flitted over the brown spotted Tiger Puka shell choker. “Your father knows the truth now.”
“You!” Dean growled as he twisted in his seat to face the Archangel. “It was you, wasn’t it?” He narrowed his eyes and stared at Gabe. “You let the air out of Baby’s tires and spray painted ‘Free Candy’ on the side of Cas’ car, didn’t you?”
Grayson watched with a lustful gaze as Castiel held the glistening cherry by the stem before placing it on his tongue and wrapping his plump lips around it. “So,” the incubus cleared his throat, “where’d you go last night?” He pulled the towel from his shoulder and began drying a tray of beer glasses.
“Not fast enough,” Castiel whispered, leaning back to rip his shirt off the rest of the way, then reaching for Dean’s. Dean let out a small chuckle, sitting up enough for them to free him of his white shirt, then pulled Castiel down against him.
“I don’t know,” Castiel shrugged as he scooted a little closer to Dean, “but we are.” The Siren’s brows dipped in consternation, “Can’t you tell from my scent?”
Castiel sighed blissfully as he rested his forehead against Dean’s. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his ruined clothing and let out a low groan. “My clothes are beyond a doubt destroyed.”
“Yeah,” Dean smiled as he pressed a gentle kiss to Castiel’s lips. “Sounds like fun.” The Alpha took his mate’s hand and let him led him from the room. He knew the quick change of topic meant Castiel wasn’t ready to talk about it just yet, and Dean couldn’t blame him. He probably still had a lot to process. One thing was for sure though, when he was ready to talk, Dean would be there for him, whatever he needed.
“Alright,” the Alpha flashed them a smile as he and Cas started down the steps. “You boys have fun and don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. Oh,” he paused, glancing back at the Betas, “and use protection!”
Dean smiled and looked down into Cas’ basket, reaching in and pulling out the blue long sleeved shirt. “Got a good selection here,” he said as the fabric slipped through his fingers. “Don’t forget to grab some socks and underwear, too, or Ellen will have a fit.”
Gabriel cleared his throat, then asked, “Can you honestly tell me that you were happier a year ago?”
Dean chuckled and nodded his head. “It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you love it. And the fact that you love doin’ one of the hardest jobs there is? Well, I applaud you for that. You’re doing awesome.”
“Here’s to us.” Dean winked and lifted his bottle, clinking them together and taking a sip. They ate the rest of their meal chatting about various things from work and about the cat until Dean brought up the subject of the ad.
“Dean!” Castiel cried out as his cock throbbed in Dean’s fist, spurting his hot release on his Alpha’s hand and the nest beneath them.
Castiel let out a shaky breath as he left the bathroom. He slowly walked down the hallway, making his way back to the living room and to his True Mate who was waiting. Hell, they had so much to talk about... He didn’t know where they would start.
Dean growled and pushed up onto his knees as Cas scrambled to roll over and present for his mate. The Alpha settled on the bed behind Cas, spreading his Omega’s ass cheeks apart, watching his quivering pucker pour slick in rivelets. Dean nipped at Cas’ ass, parting the cheeks even wider before he started licking and sucking at his hole. The Alpha’s eyes rolled into the back of his head and he moaned at the delicable taste before delving in deeper, plunging his tongue in and out scooping up as much of the ambrosia his mouth would hold.
When the man was in clear view, Dean let out the breath he was holding and slumped against the tree. The skaters eyes had been closed, a look of peace and joy on his face. He soared by with one leg extended straight as a board behind him as he leaned forward with his arms spread wide, and Dean couldn’t fight the smile that spread across his cold chapped lips.
“I can work with that.” Ketch pulled Castiel towards the dance floor, winking at Dean and Sam over his shoulder.
Dean held his mate tight around his lower back with his left arm as he maneuvered his right hand to reach between them and grip his cock, guiding it to Castiel’s wet hole. Dean bucked his hips and ran his length between his Omega’s soaked cheeks, coating his cock thoroughly before pressing in past the tight ring of muscle. Castiel’s fingers dug into the meat of Dean’s shoulders as his Alpha bottomed out in one smooth thrust.
“Go the fuck to sleep!” Dean called out as he turned to glare at the wall. He shook his head as he flopped back down on the bed and rolled over to face Castiel. “Can you believe them?”
Dean served himself some of each salad and then grabbed the largest piece of chicken, cutting a good portion from it and slicing it up on a small plate. He purposefully avoided Charlie staring at him as he put the plate on the bench seat for the cat. The cat meowed happily and started eating the chicken and Dean glanced up to see Charlie staring at him.
“Fuck,” Dean hissed at the sudden pain shooting down his arm. He rolled over, his backpack uncomfortable under his back and squinted his eyes against the sun as he reached his left hand up to hold his right shoulder.
“Not true.” Castiel placed a kiss to the shell of his mate's ear. “I knotted you in the tent after I had knotted you in the lake.”
“Its at Happy Paws Pet Shop. When we were trying to figure out where the Vampire’s nest was, I questioned one of the associates there - the girl whose boyfriend went missing.” Cas shook himself free from his brother’s grip and continued, “Outside the store there were two trees side by side, and a large web connected them. There was a bunch of tiny spiders throughout the web and a huge one dead center.”
“You deserved that! You deserve more than that!” Dean huffed as he leaned into Arthur’s space. “You act like he’s your friend yet you were going to mate him against his will.” His hand gripped Arthur’s chin tightly and forced him to meet Dean’s eyes. “You should consider yourself lucky I don’t kill you where you stand.”
Dean broke the kiss, smirking as Cas chased his lips with glassy eyes; he was clearly lust drunk and Dean’s inner Alpha preened that he was able to cause that reaction from a kiss, a very hot kiss granted, but just a kiss nonetheless.
“You know how important mating gifts are.” Rowena rolled her eyes playfully at Triton as she uncorked the vial. “How many times have you taken off the Wentletrap shell bracelet Cordelia gave you?”
Finn wiggled his way onto Castiel’s lap. He glanced up and Dean before dipping down and nudging the Alpha’s folded hands that were resting in his lap.
he noticed – but he was kind and funny. He went to work every day to work with kids under the age of five who haven’t learned how to use a toilet appropriately yet! That, in itself, meant Castiel should be given every brownie point in existence.
“Dude,” Gabriel cautioned gently not wanting to upset the riled up Alpha more. “That sea lion is so damn dramatic. Cassie probably went for a swim or to get something to eat.”
Cas sauntered up to Dean and playfully swatted him on the shoulder. “Don’t get sassy with me Alpha, or I won’t give you any pie.”
He could wait until tomorrow, but what if Cas was home and saw the collar was off the cat and got worried? What if he sat up all night, expecting and waiting for some strange Alpha to waltz through his front door and demand they be mated? The idea of Cas sitting up anxious all night made him feel like a jerk, and it really only left him one option.
“Mm-hm,” Castiel nodded with a small smirk aimed up at his mate. “Roaming electricity, way better than what you Landfolk have.”
Castiel laughed and took another bite of his sandwich before replacing it in the ziplock and tossing the bag of cookies to Dean. Dean opened it and took one of the cookies, passing a second over to Cas.
,” Sam replied before going silent, and Dean just knew he was gathering his thoughts. He waited patiently. “
“That’s great news,” Castiel blew out a deep breath. “Now we know where to find the ring. Speaking of the ring,” Castiel shifted in his seat and looked over at Dean, “do we know what it looks like?”
Castiel licked his lips in hunger as his eyes trailed up Dean’s body. The Alpha’s head was thrown back, eyes closed in ecstasy as he let out a low growl. The sight made the Omega moan and produce a fresh wave of slick. “I need you, Dean. I need you so bad, Alpha.”
Triton held his hand up to forestall Cas’s protest and his lips lifted in a smile, “Not at all, Dean.” He gazed lovingly at his younger son and swung his gaze back to Dean, “Castiel is a Siren, and so, someday he will lead them. He cannot do both.”
“Do I know I’m dead.” A loud humourless laugh filled the room. “Of course I do. And I’ve known for over a hundred years! I knew the very moment I passed.”
“Amazing,” Dean whispered as he stared at the gazebo in awe. Was everything in Atlantis ethereally beautiful? His eyes roamed over the six large gold columns, spread out perfectly to form a cylinder. The colonnades were dotted with a variety of precious gems, and seaweed twined up them in a manner that reminded Dean of the way Bobby wrapped tinsel around his porch posts at Christmas time. As the Alpha’s gaze followed the trail of seaweed up the pillars his eyes landed on the stunning Larimar Stone dome. It was a whirling galaxy of spiraling blues and greens, mixed with white. It was mesmerizing.
“Can’t he just go to his room for a while?” Dean gave his mate a charming grin. “Give us some time to get to know each other better?” The Alpha growled as he yanked his Omega flush against him.
Dean nodded as he rose to his feet. He stripped slow and methodical, aware of his Omega’s hungry gaze on him the entire time. He kept his eyes trained on his Omega, his Alpha posturing with every soft gasp, the increased scent of slick on the air. Once Dean was completely nude, he gave Cas time to admire his human form, to let him glance over every square inch of him before he looked up at the moon and let go.
“You see them?” Sam asked as he dodged a drunken beta, narrowly missing getting a beer spilled all over him.
“Doctor Shurley told me last session that I should be looking at things from a different perspective, that I should stop thinking about what Father Metatron would think, or how he would feel, or what he would say. I suppose I would disappoint both of them today…” Lucifer trailed off and leaned back into the wooden swing. “Do you think Father Metatron would be unhappy with us, Castiel?”
“That sounds nice,” Castiel answered softly as he shifted in his seat, climbing out of the vehicle, his eyes never straying from the ground. Ellen bit back a forlorn sigh as her hands twitched at her side. She wanted so much to reach out and pull him into her chest and tell him he was safe here, but she knew that was too much too soon. So instead, she put on her best reassuring smile.
The entire group burst out laughing as Benny blew Castiel a kiss, the latter pretending to put it in his pocket. After the raucous laughter and teasing about how Dean was too jealous to let anyone lay a finger on Castiel died down, Sam cleared his throat.
Castiel’s eyes flitted back to Dean’s, whose was already on him. “After I left the diner, and dropped my suitcase at his house, I went to a bar to drown my sorrows. Yes, my parents were assholes, but they were
Dean looked over to his mom and rolled his eyes fondly before turning his gaze to Castiel. “I do,” Dean nodded, “do you?”
Castiel blood pulsed his in veins, his skin felt like fire was licking against it. He knew the only way to cool this inferno raging within him was with his Alpha’s touch, his bite, his seed. As the flames claimed him from the inside out, he undulated in Dean’s lap as he continued crooning the lyrics to his song of seduction. His breath hitched and he faltered slightly when he felt his cock slide against his Alpha’s.
!” Dean glared at him, snagging the bag from his friend’s hands and hiding them in his lap. “If you had eaten the cookies on me, I’m not sure our friendship could’ve been saved.”
Dean felt his body really relax for the first time in weeks. He felt Castiel melt against him and it felt so right. They had both waited for this moment for far too long. And now that it was finally happening, to say they were both deliriously ecstatic, well, that would be an understatement.
“Well...” Ellen moved over beside Bobby and leaned against him, leaning forward enough to see Lucifer moving back and Dean stepping up to Castiel’s bed. “Dean just informed me Castiel is his true mate.”
Dean pushed up on his elbows and looked down into his mate’s lust filled eyes. God, his Omega was beautiful like this. The Alpha reached up and ran his fingers down Cas’ cheek. “I’m gonna make you feel good, baby.
Dean pushed back up onto his knees and Cas’ chest rose and fell with impatience as he looked over his shoulder and watched his mate's eyes roam hungrily over his body. The Alpha’s fingers trailed down the knobs of his spine, stopping to grip his hips. “Ready baby?”
Big thanks to Ani-make-me-girl for beta’ing this chapter, and zephyrchrysalis for Alpha reading and providing art.
“Not just yet,” Castiel cuddled closer in his Alpha’s arms. “Let’s look at the stars a while longer.”
“What’s going on?” Castiel asked shakily as he clutched at the blanket pooled in his lap. “Why am I in your room?” The Omega’s eyes fell to his hands as he whispered, “Why am I in your bed in such a state?”
“I guess you're right.” Cas pouted as he took Dean’s hand and let the Alpha haul him up. The two of the walking cautiously, side by side, hand in hand to the porch where they could trade the skates out for their boots.
“Sam,” Eileen slapped him on the shoulder. “It’s a special day, he should be able to eat all the pie he wants.”
“Wait.” Dean paused in thought. “It’s not gonna work, you’ve clearly forgotten one very important thing. Cas is now mated, and he
As the Omega was bringing the plates back to the island he caught Dean eating the ice cream straight out of the container
“Naturally!” Dean beamed back, finding himself relaxing in Castiel’s company. Castiel opened up the salad while Dean ran back inside for butter and sour cream. While he was grabbing the stuff from the fridge, Dean hoped the Omega felt as comfortable over here in his presence as he appeared.
“There’s really not a lot to tell.” Gracie leaned back on the bench and crossed her legs. “How did you guys solve the riddle?”
A small smirk spread across the Omega’s lips and he turned his attention to his mate. “That’s deuce to uno now. We’re catching up! Better watch your back, Alpha.”
, and they decided it was time to get ready. Sam went back to his room to get dressed, telling Dean and Cas he would meet them in the lobby at six.
“I assure you I’m not from there either.” Dean subconsciously shifted closer to his mate, earning a frigid glare from Triton.
“I think we managed to keep a pretty good lead on them.” Sam shrugged as the couple looked over at him. “We’re good at what we do.”
“What do you want to take the Ibuprofen with, water or juice?” Dean called from the kitchen. After a beat of silence, he peeked over the refrigerator door at the Omega sitting on the couch. “Earth to Cas, water or juice?”
“Well,” Gabriel grinned, “Mom ‘n Dad were True Mate’s like Dean-o and Cassie. Mom was having a girls’ night out at her favorite restaurant and Dad just happened to be their waiter.” Gabriel huffed a laugh. “He didn’t even get through the drink orders before he had Mom on the table claiming her, her friends on either side of the booth watching.” His smile turned soft and he shook his head. “They go there every year and have dinner on the anniversary of the claiming.”
“Hey!” Dean added in his protest. “I was ready but when you didn’t start right away, well...  I can’t help that I became distracted.” Dean motioned to Castiel with a grin. “It’s not my fault my alpha is sex on a stick and smells like heaven!” The omega reached up and smooshed Castiel’s cheeks together, causing his lips to pucker. “Just look at those lush, kissable lips!”
“Oh! yeah, sure.” Dean placed his mug on the coffee table and pointed to the hallway. “First door on the left.”
“Mick,” he whispered, voice cracking as his eyes darted around the darkened gym chasing the scent of ginger and citrus with a hint of leather, a scent that had haunted him the past five years. All too quickly, his gaze landed on
As they kissed, Dean slid his hand down Castiel’s body, between his legs, and coated his fingers in slick. The alpha plunged two fingers into the tight, wet heat of Castiel’s quivering hole. Slow and teasingly he moved his fingers in and out of the omega, scissoring and spreading them, getting Castiel’s body ready to take his knot. Dean added a third finger and pressed against the omega’s prostate.
Cas waited for a moment, watching Dean watch him before he furrowed a brow and asked, “Why am I stopping?”
Castiel furrowed his brows, “I don’t like the thought of you guys driving home so late. The roads could be very slick with all the snow and ice.”
“Like hell!” Dean fired back, twisting out of her reach and walking back towards the front of the house. He found himself petting what he
“Son of a bitch,” Dean whispered as he looked down at the drunken Omega in his arms. Castiel was his True Mate. Seriously?!
“Great, just fuckin’ great! See,” Dean groused, “now you've gone and tore your stitches! Okay, just butterfly ones, but still,” Dean scolded as he grabbed Castiel’s arm and led him over to an oversized stuffed armchair. “Sit.” Dean nodded towards the chair as he mumbled, “Knew I should have just sewn it up.”
Alcohol brought out the worst in some Alphas and Dean didn’t want to end his peaceful night of relaxation with a brawl in the middle of the street.
Dean immediately pushed back from the table, coming around to give Ellen a quick kiss on the cheek. “Come on, Cas,” Dean said as he moved for the doorway. “I think Sammy wants to kick your ass in Mario Cart.”
“Okay,” Dean stood, Cas joining him. “First of all, we need to make sure the other participants in the hunt do not come out here. We need to keep them safe.” Dean shifted from foot to foot, his brows scrunched in fierce concentration. He looked back down at Gracie and Eric. “Where could we set up another party?”
The Omega grinned salaciously as he leaned closer and murmured his response. Dean let out a breathy sigh as Cas leaned back and met his Alpha’s eyes. “I think I’m gonna do that even if you don’t win.” Dean reached up and ran his thumb over Cas’ plump bottom lip, “my sweet lil’ Omega.”
Dean ran a hand over his face, closing his eyes. “If… if he had a book… that means someone told him. Who the fuck told him?” Dean looked over, meeting his brother’s eyes. “You? Jo? Ellen or Bobby? I mean, no one else knows!”
“Sorry, Babe,” Dean snorted as he pressed a kiss to Castiel’s fresh mating mark before his eyes landed on the sweet confection on the counter. “Oh! Pie!” The Alpha exclaimed as he reached for it.
Instead of answering, the Omega reached up and twined his arms around Dean’s neck, threading his fingers in the Alpha’s hair and pulling him in for another kiss.
“Dean,” Castiel whispered and waited until he had the Alpha’s full attention, “you said having an Alpha around can calm heat. How? Does it have something to do with why you’re shirtless?” The Omega’s eyes flitted down to Dean’s chest, feeling that same spike of heat in his blood as he did before. A warm feeling that made him want to bear his throat, and he didn’t understand why.
Sam handed the folder to the sheriff as he toed off his shoes and stepped into the boots. “You get anything from these?” the sheriff asked.
“What on Earth is going on in here?!” Bobby’s voice was loud and all Alpha, making Castiel jump and release Dean who went pitching forward onto his hands and knees to the floor. “Christ, what happened?”
because they were Omegas.” Jo paused and glanced over at Ellen. When she saw no surprise in her mom’s eyes, she continued, “Of course, implying anything bad about Sam set Dean off, and I guess they yelled at each other or something before Cas stormed back here. But…”
“Yes, it was nice.” Castiel swallowed hard as his thoughts wandered to the Playground. It had been a while since he thought of his life there... thought of how different it was, compared to his life now. When he sat here in this office  just a year ago, he would’ve given anything to be back at his childhood home. But now, now he would give anything to never see that Compound again.
The woman glanced up from her computer, her eyes widening as she took in their appearance and nose wrinkling as their aroused scents assaulted her senses. “Excuse me?”
“I want that too. I want romantic evenings, late nights making love. I want to have many adventures with you.” The Alpha grinned as he took the vial from Castiel’s hand and uncorked it. “Kids being one of them, just not now.”
Once the Alpha placed the tray on the cooling rack and removed the oven mitt, he reached into the cabinet and pulled out two wine glasses. The Alpha spun around and shook the glasses. “Who’s ready for some wine!”
“Come on, Sammy, Ketch,” Dean barked as he paced the room. “How do we get the incubi venom out of Cas’ system?”
He focused on the younglings, studied their movements until he recognized the game they were playing. Then Castiel found himself smiling. What he wouldn’t give to be that young and free again, to not have priorities or a care in the world. Despite his gloomy mood, he found himself waving back when a little girl swam by his window laughing and waving both her hands at him,  while two young boys chased after her with large grins on their faces.
Dean thought as he watched his omega cross the room towards Ketch. “Take Sammy’s bed, then,” Dean coaxed as he moved Sam’s duffel to the floor.
ached for him to. “I don’t… Cas, I don’t have a good excuse. I can explain why I kept it from you at first, I can tell you my thought process, but… you’re right, okay?”
Castiel leaned against one of the wooden support beams and scanned the faces of all the men in the sitting room. No Julian Drake though. Just as he was about to move on to the shops he felt a hand clamp down on his shoulder. The only thing that prevented him from jumping was that he’d smelled Dean’s approach. The earthy scent of pine and spicy cinnamon filled his nostrils long before Dean’s hand touched him.
The silence that followed was comfortable, content, and Dean felt himself lost in it for a moment, suddenly overwhelmed with emotions. Castiel was here,
Cas took a deep shuddering breath as he nuzzled Dean’s mating gland, darting his tongue out and lapping a broad stroke across it before biting down, tasting the coppery flavor of Dean’s blood as it seeped into his mouth. The Alpha groaned and pushed his hips forward, more seed pulsing from his cock as Cas’ hole massaged his knot. The Omega shuddered, his cock twitching, and his entire body overwhelmed with the pleasure of mating. He felt like he was floating in the pheremones they were both giving off and the feeling of being full of his mate’s come. Cas’ cock throbbed between their bodies, he could feel the warm, wet spread of his come between them soaking their chests as he came untouched.
Cas shook his head, “I gotta grab my duffel from my locker, then I’ll be ready.” He shouldered his backpack as they started walking and glanced over at Dean. “Where do you want me to meet you?”
The Omega stared up into his father's eyes that were beaming with pride, and a little bit of melancholy. “Castiel,” he gave his son’s hand a squeeze as he continued. “It’s been an honor being your father and watching you grow into a wonderful young Omega. Now that you have passed your Rite, now that you are a full-fledged Siren, the time has come for me to stop holding you so closely.”
“All yours,” Castiel agreed, breathless as he arched into the movement of their bodies. His hands dug into Dean’s shoulders as the Alpha sucked the spot harder. Castiel scraped his nails down the Alpha’s back, leaving welts in their wake as he wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist and rutted upwards. He let out a soft moan as his cock throbbed against Dean’s, precome and slick soaked his underwear. “More,” he pleaded as Dean worried that spot with his teeth and grinded against him harder and faster.
“So good,” came Castiel’s breathless reply as he swiveled his hips and took Dean’s fingers deeper into his body. “More,” the Omega cried out as the Alpha’s fingers struck his prostate.
“I’ll tell you why,” Ketch spoke up, causing both men to jump and look his way. “It’s because you both are stubborn arses, especially you, Dean.” Dean shot him a glare and the alpha just snorted. “Seriously, I was flirting hardcore with Castiel, and nothing. I thought I was going to have to bloody well plant a kiss on his lips before I got a reaction.”
“Not much, Sweetheart.” Castiel barely repressed rolling his eyes at his mate’s jealousy as he leaned into the touch and continued. “Just talking to our tour guide, Lucifer.”
By the time Dean and Castiel skidded through the opening to the fifth floor they were both panting to catch their breaths. It was only one flight from the roof, but they barreled down it like the devil himself was after them. And Castiel wasn’t quite sure he wasn’t! Dean turned to Castiel with a small smirk. “See, no ghosts or goblins.”
Gabe snapped his fingers, his hands instantly holding a thick packet of papers. “Ask and ye shall receive Sama-lama-ding-dong.”
“I’d love to.” The Omega laced his fingers through Dean’s and bumped his shoulder against his mate’s. “Lead the way, Alpha.”
“I one hundred percent agree.” Castiel held out his hand for Dean to take as they walked around the mausoleum and back towards the hill.
“To my house,” Dean answered, nodding towards the large cape-style home across the street. “That’s where my medical supplies are, and it will be much easier to check you out there than on the sidewalk.”
Dean’s body thrummed with anticipation as he felt the first press of his mate’s cock slip between his cheeks, the head teasing at his rim, barely catching on it. The Omega let out a low whine and Cas huffed fondly at his mate’s impatience as he gripped the base of his cock and guided it to Dean’s hole, pressing in past the tight ring of slippery muscle and thrusting forward until he completely bottomed out with his thighs resting snug against his mate’s ass.
He’d taken two steps when he faintly heard something. Dean paused, that voice, it was the voice he’d been longing to hear again for what felt like an eternity. And it was singing the most alluring sound, like a lullaby, the words drifted to the shore, carried by the wind, to his ears.
“No,” Castiel hissed as he swatted Gabriel’s hand away, blushing at the other students who were whispering and watching them. “I assure you I did not get mated.”
Dean cried out his response, clutching the sheets on either side of him and rolling his hips down to push back onto Cas’ fingers. “Fuck, fuck, Cas,” he gasped out, eyes snapping open as he wildly searched for Cas’. “Please,” he whispered, reaching a shaking hand up and grabbing at Cas’ shoulder to pull him up.
“Please,” Ketch snorted as he looked from Sam to Dean, “don’t even act like the two of you have never done that.”
Sam glared, shaking his head, but shoved out of the chair. He ripped Dean’s door open and stomped into the hallway, the open door letting Dean and Castiel hear him head towards the stairs and then down them.
Lucifer swallowed hard, his throat thick and eyes burning. For the first time, he allowed himself to wonder what it was he’d done that was bad enough to be punished this way. He’d always behaved in the best manner, appropriate to Father Metatron and the Elders at the Playground. He did his chores, his classes, his prayers… he listened and only spoke when spoken to.
Castiel stopped Dean’s movement by reaching back and finding his hand, linking their fingers together and pulling their joined hands over his heart. He found himself smiling, sinking back into his Alpha’s heat, comfortable, sated, and content. Happy, Castiel found himself drifting off.
“I have an idea that I think is fitting,” Cas proclaimed as he ran his fingers over the locket in his hand.
Dean lunged down and attacked his Omega’s lips, tangling his fingers in Cas’ hair, pulling it and causing a wicked moan to pour out of his mate’s lips. Cas’ head burrowed deep into the pillow, his body drenched with sweat and slick, he was pumping out pheromones of lust and need for his Alpha. The Omega’s core felt molten hot, hotter than he’d ever felt, even during a heat. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean and arched up. The Omega needed more, he needed much, much, more.
“Yeah,” Jo nodded, leaning back on her hands and watching him watch the blue sparks, “and so we celebrate it. Usually, that’s done with a big old cookout and with fireworks. Sparklers, snap and pops, firecrackers… all the fun stuff comes before the big show of fireworks. This year, Mom would only let us do sparklers though because
The snow that had been lazily drifting down had now accelerated to a more frenzied pace. Dean chuckled as he noticed just how much the tiny glistening snowflakes had covered their clothing as they had laid there kissing. Dean placed one final kiss to his mate’s lips before he shifted his weight off of Cas and carefully stood up.
much more.” Cas quirked a playful yet challenging brow. “I believe you said something about fucking me so full it leaked out of me and then doing it over and over until the sun comes up.”
“What kind of Alpha are you,” Crowley growled forcefully, cutting his son off. “I raised you better! Quit whining and be a
“This was a mistake,” Cas murmured as he pushed back the willow trees branches. “I have betrayed Father by breaking his rules and being alone with an Alpha Elder.”
“Well,” Dean licked the icing off his lips as he propped his elbows up on the table and carried on. “You ever felt an overpowering sense of fear you can’t explain? Kinda like someone watching you, or something behind you in a dark room?”
“Awesome.” Castiel sighed, a bright grin spreading across his face. “I was kinda hoping you would offer. I already have my duffel in my locker so I don’t have to go home after school.” Castiel leaned closer to Dean and looked around to see if anyone was listening in before he whispered, “I even have a special surprise in my bag.”
“I know.” The incubus smirked as he walked quickly, maneuvering passed drunk partiers to get them out of the club.
Castiel blinked his eyes open, letting them adjust to his surroundings. He was met with the sight of the most handsome Alpha he’d ever seen. The man had honey color hair, artfully tossed, and a sharp jawline. His eyes were a stunning green that shone with mirth as he looked back at the Omega carefully. Castiel swallowed hard and his eyes flicked down to glance over the set of plush lips that matched the emotion. But what was even better than the gorgeous Alpha before him, was the fact he was holding a mug of steaming hot black coffee and some ibuprofen.
They ran until they felt as if they would drop if they took another step. With Waverly a good distance away Dean felt it was safe to stop now. The Alpha let go of his mates hand and doubled over, trying to catch his breath.
“You are one whipped alpha...” Gabriel grinned at Castiel as he made a whip cracking motion, complete with sound, before darting out the door.
Dean pressed his nose into the base of Castiel’s throat, scenting him deeply, and letting his mate’s scent calm him the rest of the way.
“Come on,” Jo grinned brightly as she motioned to the stairs, “your room is this way.” The Omegas gave one last look to Alpha and Beta Singer before following the perky blonde up the stairs.
The Omega scooped up a huge spoonful and groaned around the first bite, savoring the spicy flavor. “This is
“Cas,” Dean reached up and ran his fingers through the Omega’s hair, “how could I not accept someone as amazing and courageous as you? Now,” he gave the Omega a gentle squeeze before unwrapping his arm from Castiel’s shoulders, “what d’you say we eat this wonderful dinner before it gets cold.”
“Beautiful,” Dean repeated, sliding his hands up Cas’ legs, pushing his thighs apart slowly. Castiel moaned softly, a fresh wave of slick leaking from his hole. Dean met his eyes once, then moved forward, sucking his mate’s cock down in one smooth motion.
“What’s all the - Luc!” Ellen moved forward, reaching for Lucifer’s cheeks and surveying his face. “What happened? Why are you bleeding?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean started as he sat down beside the Omega, “you know how you told me at dinner that you had your Master’s in Business Administration but you haven’t been able to find a job yet?”
Dean inhaled sharply, the air punched from his lungs. He tore his eyes away, closing them quickly in case they were ringed red, and just barely managed to bite back the growl that was bubbling its way up from his stomach. Dean forced himself to smile, not trusting himself to speak, and blew out a slow breath as he looked back up to watch Castiel walk back towards his yard.
Dean looked confused as he listened to his brother’s words and looked to Castiel and Lucifer. “Wait, why do you guys think you’re in trouble? Am I missing something?”
. They were abominations, punishments from God, and learning about the gender would do nothing to absolve those sins one was being punished from.
“It’s a beautiful night,” Castiel said cutting his Alpha off, not wanting his sympathy. “Would you like to take a trip up to the surface?”
The other three followed Sam’s voice to the center of time square, looking in the neighboring jack-o-lanterns for their coin. Gabe was holding the green pouch, shaking it jovily when he sidled up beside Dean and Cas. “I found the team coin!”
Dean bobbed his head and picked up the silverware on the island and followed his original footsteps back into the dining room. He hesitated once before setting the two plates side by side, instead of putting them across from each other. One he placed at the head of the table, the other to the right.
So here Castiel stood, three days later, his hand shaking when he raised it to knock on the motel door where Dean was staying, his stomach twisting with nerves as he waited for it to be answered. The Omega held his breath as he heard movement from within the room getting closer to the door. The look of pure shock on Dean’s face when he swung open the door, as if he was questioning the fact that Cas was really here, made the Omega smile as he whispered...
“Four,” Dean replied as he shifted from foot to foot, subconsciously moving closer to his Omega as the scent of numerous unmated Alpha’s wafted up around them when a group of other participants walked by.
Dean let out a loud bark of laughter and wrapped his arms around his mate. “God you really are perfect.” The Alpha planted a huge wet kiss on Cas’ cheek. “And you’re totally right,
This Fic was originally supposed to be a one shot (as you can tell it ran away from me and ended up being way longer) based on this....
“I’m not going back with you.” Sam shifted his duffel over his shoulder. “Jody called Ketch this morning— possible wendigo in Lost Creek, Colorado. And since you,” Sam smirked at his brother, “stole his hunting partner, I thought I’d give him a hand. Oh, and she said to congratulate you two,” he playfully slapped both Dean and Castiel on their shoulder, “for finally getting your heads out of your asses.”
Dean gave a small laugh. “Yeah, I was kind of glad to get out of that job this year.” He smiled and glanced over at Castiel. “Bobby will spread out some sand beneath the fireworks, and he also will fill in the empty cartridges with it so they can’t keep burning and won’t light the grass on fire or anything.”
“Let’s go in.” Castiel rose and ran his hands down Dean’s chest before standing and holding out his hand for his mate. “Let’s shower, heat up the leftovers from yesterday, enjoy more pie, and have
and lost spectacularly. After that he threw in the towel, but watched as Sam taught Jack and Claire how to play
“How about you show me the bedroom, Alpha.” Castiel pulled back, eyes locked with Dean’s, “I haven’t seen it yet and I think that should be remedied.”
“I’m in on the next race, Sammy,” Dean said, clearing his throat. Jo sighed, knowing the conversation was officially over for now. She slouched down, kicking her legs up to rest them on the coffee table, and was content to watch Sam kick Dean’s butt another four times before Mom called them all down for dinner.
Dean jerked forward, moving deeper inside his Omega’s body, the head of his cock nudging Castiel’s prostate. The Omega gasped as his body shivered and he rocked his hips, rutting his hard cock against the bed.
Cas snuggled back into his arms as they both watched nine-year-old Ralphie dream of getting a Red Rider BB gun, and how he set’s out to convince his parents that it is the perfect gift.
“Ummm…” Dean cleared his throat willing his brain to come back online. The last thing he needed to say was ‘naked, just like that’. He shook his head, clearing those traitorous thoughts from his brain. “Turn around, back facing me. And try not to fall off the couch.”
“I try,” Dean shrugged as he rounded the island and sauntered up to Cas. “You know what happens next, don’t you?” the Alpha whispered hotly in his mate’s ear.
Dean smiled as he taped the latest article into the scrapbook he’d started keeping after he and Castiel mated. He looked up to see Castiel smiling back at him fondly from the doorway, his arms crossed over his bulging stomach.
“We need a room,” Dean repeated as he pulled his wallet out of his back pocket before removing his credit card and sliding it across the counter.
“I just, I need a minute.” Castiel took a deep breath and let it out slowly before meeting Gabriel’s concerned gaze. “I never thought I would see you again.”
as humane as Charlie’s, and a woman who dressed up in a cat costume and spent the better part of an hour on her hands and knees
“Yes,” Dean exclaimed as he snatched Castiel’s hands and pulled the laughing Omega into his arms. Castiel did a small spin, then pressed into Dean’s space, the two of them swaying back and forth, pressed chest to chest. Dean hummed a few lines, then smiled and began to sing.
“Gods, Cas,” Dean’s breath caught at the feel of his Omega’s hardness brushing alongside his. The Alpha dipped a second finger into Castiel’s wetness as he whispered in his mate’s ear, “Take us both in your hand, baby, and make us come.”
“I’m sure it’s not.” Dean tentatively cupped his Omega’s jaw, urging him to meet his eyes. “Tell me, please?”
The four of them stared at each other for a few moments before theirs eyes started darting up and down the street.
“Absolutely ridiculous.” Castiel grinned at his mate before he furrowed his brows and asked. “What are we doing all the way in the back? I figured you’d want to be up front where you can hear better and see things first.”
love you, that we all do, just as you are. Out here, in the world you’re living in now? Omegas aren’t bad. They’re just the same as Betas and Alphas, you’re important and special in your own way. I love that you’re an Omega, because you’re not a hot headed dick like most teenage Alphas are. But… you have to come to terms with that on your own, I’m just here to tell you how I feel and I’m always here to listen to how you feel.”
“You won't be able to feel them,” Castiel shook his head laughing. “We have internal gills. They are located around where you were touching just on the inside of our throat.”
“You were going to tell me about your uncle.” Castiel responded as he laid his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“If you meant everything you said,” Castiel placed his hand on Dean’s knee, squeezing it, “and if you really want me too.”
After a beat of silence, the alpha spoke, “I’m so sorry for so many things, Cas. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner. I’m sorry I made you think I didn’t want you. But what I’m most sorry for is how I’ve treated you since you fell from Heaven.” Dean squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head, shame permeating the air around him.
Castiel gasped again as Dean pressed down against him, his own cock growing stiff from the delicious friction.
Cas stuck his tongue out in response before cackling again and slipping out of the bathroom. Dean huffed, as irritated as he was amused, until a sponge was thrown at his head.
Omega males go through heats every three months and it is only at this time where conception is guaranteed. Conception out of a heat cycle is not impossible, however it is rare. Betas go through a mild form of heat cycles in which they are more fertile, but it is nowhere near the intensity it is for Omegas. There are heat suppressants available that stop the heat completely, but long term use has the potential to cause damage to the female reproductive organs. Once someone comes off of the suppressants, they immediately go into proliferation heat and risk for pregnancy is increased from that of a normal heat. Alpha males go through a rut once a year and during extreme times of emotion. It is common for teenage Alphas to go through multiple ruts due to changing hormones and has led to many teenage pregnancies. A rut is common during a mating ritual and can occur multiple times during the first few years of a new mate bond. Ruts and heats are not necessary for conception, but if both partners are in their cycles, it is highly likely a pregnancy will occur.
“Mm-hm,” Castiel stared at his mate, noting the mischievous glint in his eyes. He was one hundred percent positive there was more in the pack than some jackets and water, but was it worth calling him out? The Omega sighed and shook his head as they approached the walkway leading to the Welcome Center, deciding the less he knew the better.
“Okay.” Sam blew out a deep breath. “We all know Grayson has his eyes set on Cas. So we should go back to the club tonight, and since Cas is now bonded with his soulmate, the incubus’ venom will have no effect on him.”
Dean swallowed hard, searching Cas’ eyes for some sign that he was joking. For some sign that this was a goddamn dream. “You… you want me… as your mate?” Dean asked, watching the fond smile grow over Cas’ mouth. “Holy crap.”
gallons of water later, Castiel, along with his lips and eyes were back to normal. The omega’s features once again resembled the ones Dean had fallen so deeply in love with. Castiel’s lips, now a plush pink, and his bright blue eyes were no longer glassy, but as clear as the sky on a cloudless day.
“Your turn now, My Sweet Omega, My Beautiful Siren.” The Alpha leaned forward and tilted his head, giving Castiel better access to his throat to seal their bond.
Gabriel let out a long contrite sigh, “I apologize for treating you like some helpless Omega, that needs saving by his Alpha big brother.” He grumbled and rubbed his sides, “With a fin-slap like that you can take care of yourself for sure.”
“Lucifer, can you put on the soft light?” she asked gently, crossing the room with the light coming in from the hallway. “I don’t want the big light on, it’s too bright and he needs as much privacy as we can give him.”
“Okay,” Ellen nodded, “we knew it was coming soon.” She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Carry him up to his room, Dean. The boy is in no condition to walk. Put him in his bed and I will tend to him.”
Dean looked like he was about to protest but Castiel shook his head firmly. “I don’t want my pheromones to sway your decision. I’ll wait for you in my room for your answer.” The Omega cupped his mate’s cheeks and kissed him, softly but passionately, pouring all his adoration into this one kiss. When Castiel pulled back breathlessly he trailed his thumb across Dean’s bottom lip with a small smile before turning and swimming towards the castle. As he reached the gates, he spun around and called out, “No matter what you choose I will understand and respect your decision.”
“Bite your tongue,” Castiel shook his head as he paused outside their bedroom. “You know they will never wanna hear such things about their parents.”
ales and popped the tops. Usually Dean didn’t go for flavored beer, but this time of year he went for all things pumpkin. The scent and flavor reminded of his mate, and he just couldn’t get enough.
. It had been a Birthday gift from Dean, the Alpha said it was a Winchester tradition as they each had one, and Castiel needed one, too. That small gift made the Omega’s heart swell because he knew it was Dean’s way of saying Castiel was family too.
“So,” Dean began as he popped one of the piping hot cajun wedges in his mouth and looked toward Ketch. “You got a pretty sweet ride, ‘78 Trans Am, right?”
“Absolutely fuckin’ not!” Dean snapped, cutting his brother off as the scent of irate alpha immediately filled the car.
“And this Alpha you have chosen,” Gabriel wriggled in the nest, settling deeper in the sand. “You were drawn to him because of his aura, no scenting needed?”
“Jealous omega,” Castiel whispered back just seconds before Dean turned and planted a rough kiss on his mate’s lips, thoroughly staking his claim.
“Good luck with that,” Gabriel snorted as he met Dean’s eyes. “He’s a possessive little asshole that hates Alphas.”
“Because,” Sam burrowed deeper in the covers and laid back with a soft sigh, “something is clearly going on with you and Cas.”
“Is that a gun in your pocket, Officer Winchester? Or are you just happy to see me,” Castiel teased.
“Okay,” Cas reached out and took it, clutching it in one hand as he slammed the trunk shut with the other. He glanced to Sam then to his Alpha. “You guys ready?”
Cas slid to a stop, wrapping his arms around Dean. “Everything okay?” he asked as he looked up into the Alpha’s eyes.
Dean smiled and looked down at his hand, still tingling where Castiel’s hand had been. God, under any other circumstances, Dean would be over the moon right now from what Castiel was saying. Hell, if he was so great, then why didn’t Castiel want him as a mate? Why was he sitting over here as a friend and watching as Alpha after Alpha chased after Cas’ cat to try to win the most perfect Omega’s affections?
As Castiel continued to survey his surroundings he noticed quite a few stores. One that specialized in slope gear and warm clothing, another that sold a variety of sweets and other treats, there was even a specialty coffee shop.
