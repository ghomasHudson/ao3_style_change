Tony dropped his hand and looked away. He went out of the room without waiting for an answer and left the smoothie on the table. Steve drank it up — let nothing be wasted.
“It’s a long story and I don’t have time. I just know about Avengers, Loki and Chitauri, we study all that in school,” Peter waved his hand on a smoking cityscape. “You won’t believe it, but I came right from the future, just like in that movie with Marty McFly but without hoverboards!”
Pierce threw the magazine aside and a small piece of paper flew out of it. There was only one word “Run!”
Tony glared at him and ground out with a lopsided grin, “Now I can believe that your rose is intact, Cap, you have such big thorns. Listen, the most risk you’ll get is a media scandal and a slightly sullied reputation. Would you mind knowing what I think?”
“Oh no, you are a family tyrant!” Tony cried in delight. “We’ve come to blows even before we’re married. Although, we’ll be quits because I’m going to marry you right now no matter what.”
“I can’t resurrect dead people,” Tony reminded. “And it wasn’t like you were really alive at the moment.”
“No, thank you,” Steve answered after a minuscule pause. After all, if there is no difference, then..? No, he was never inclined to escapism. “But what can you do in general? For example?”
In the bedroom they stood still for a moment just to look at each other with new eyes. They were familiar and unknown at the same time.
“Captain won’t murder us immediately for the simple bugging. He understands that standard safety measures should exist. Probably. Stark is doing something with him, don’t you see? Jenkins was the first victim, who will be the next? Maybe you? How do you think, how long Rogers will hesitate if Stark asks the permission to take your arm to pieces?”
“I am in the past now,” realized Peter dumbfoundedly. He had realized that before, of course, but distantly. Only now he felt that he was on a field of the Battle for New York which he knew only through history lessons and Youtube videos… And it was a somewhat different feeling. “I am in the past, Mr. Stark’s just flown in the portal, almost died there, well, the city almost died… but for now it’s a happy ending without a bad start, and a bad start wouldn’t follow if…”
Tony quirked his lips and resettled the goggles to the forehead. The skin around his eyes was lighter than weather skin on his cheeks—well, recently he and Rhodes had spent good ten days on a proving ground, launching a capricious helicarrier; it’s how they called a giant zeppelin with four steam engines which could carry almost a whole army…
“But someone has to remember what could have happened there and what we hardly avoided?” Peter mouthed. Footsteps of two men were already heard from the stairway, and Peter knew what he would see on fathers’ faces: true burning curiosity—and equally true love. “So it’d never…”
It should be followed with choked gasps of motherfucker who crossed the line and who had been sucking the blood of literally all Hydra members for many years. However, Rogers was surprisingly peaceful.
They stared at him as if he was an alien. Or maybe he was someone strange who couldn’t exist, who didn’t have a right to exist there—well, it was true in some sense.
“Let’s assume that you are neither a prankster nor a boy who was hit too hard in his head,” Tony said. “Tell me, o young Pheidippides, what news do you bear? And cut the long story short.”
Wanted to know that be it five or even ten tentacles, they wouldn’t divide him and Tony forever, crippling one of them with shame and the other one with disgust.
Steve suddenly realized that something was painfully and smartly tugging inside, squeezing his heart, and he was frightened at once, but it was too late. He couldn’t stop himself, and the whole bucket of soft tentacles broke through with a loud crunch, sticking through the hole just under the abdomen. They swayed back and forth, pomping up with a liquid rapidly and hardening.
He looks furtively at other Avengers. Clint whistles, sometimes even dances excitedly; it seems like he is quite content with his life at the moment. Natasha doesn’t whistle, but she seems mildly disdainful and deadly as usual, so mosquitoes keep away from her. Well, at least she doesn’t show intent to kill someone. Bruce smiles softly, and Thor tries to knock off a cone from a bough. It doesn’t go well. Tony will pay for damage, okay. Ancient pine?.. What a pity. But the god is satisfied, what could be more important?
Peter heard, but he didn’t think the fucking imaginary grandfather would matter so much for his life.
“Well, I guess you won’t,” Steve muttered thoughtfully. Peter could bet that he thought not only about complicated relationships between Tony Stark and society. “You’d rather bite off your tongue than confess something like that… You know, okay. I’m in.”
“Don’t fall asleep,” Cap repeats. Tony hears his big and strong heart pounding—like the heart of an elephant, “or else you’ll freeze.”
“Maybe I had to do it a couple of times,” Tony chuckled. “When the engine core refused to produce quasi-neutrino and the navigation rods gave me trouble since they were overheating…”
“Okay, okay,” Tony understood him in his own way, groped his ass firmer and let go immediately to get rid of his buckle. “You will get all of it right now, I promise.”
“We need something flammable. Firewood or at least brushwood, okay?” Cap explains patiently as if Tony is a baby or an idiot. “Do you see something like this here?”
The magazine “Technology for the Youth” appeared in the stack of newspapers as if by some invisible force and it was the last straw. The cover showed Stark in the most obscene way: a dirty face, disheveled hair, a white tank, a hammer in his hands. Pierce could swear that he spotted a prominent hickey on the back of that nasty neck. The article explained to young engineers how to repair a bionic arm prosthesis using a set of screwdrivers, a piece of wire, a foil sheet, and a petroleum jelly. The article also contained a photo of the Winter Soldier in a boy scout camp where he was rewarded with a badge “For knotting”. His face was dreamy. Obviously, he was imagining how he would try his new skills on some of his colleagues.
“He found its location through the Internet,” Tony explained automatically. “Yes, there is one nearby, but it wasn’t lucky, Hulk’s direct hit and all that…”
“I’m sorry, I plunged into some shit and washed it off longer than I intended. Have you ordered something?”
“I’m totally okay,” Steve held the bowl like a lifeline: Tony turned, leaned on his shoulder, and wound fingers in his hair. He moved locks apart, probably, to examine the lower parts of stems. “I feel well. It’s nothing.”
“What happened in Budapest?” Peter blurted and recoiled, raising his hands—Clint made such a distorted face. “No! I don’t want to know it, I just want to prove that I don’t lie, that I am really from the future and we really have a problem!”
Coulson shrugged. They threw first-rate parties in Triskelion; confetti still covered his shoulders.
“But couldn’t you go there and tell them all of that by yourself?” he asked, looking at Strange almost pleadingly. No, he wasn’t afraid to appear in front of Avengers in the most terrible timing, but Strange gained a much better understanding of all that time travel stuff than Peter.
Five minutes past ten is still after ten, right? Steve didn’t have a chance to knock, because JARVIS let him in right away. Tony stood with his side to the door and did something with his miraculous holograms. He looked like an orchestra conductor with his powerful but economical waves of hands, sharp gestures, energetic and passionate movements. Steve could look at him forever — but suddenly he noticed something blue on the table. It was a fading flower of gentian in a scotch glass — the one Tony picked when Steve gave himself away. Steve remembered it because one of the petals was shorter than others and also because it was crumpled badly. The flower darkened and dried up, and the water drop on the bell made it look even worse.
Tony was already kneeling between his legs. His darkened straight cock bobbed heavily under a line of black pubic hair, a drop of lubricant glistened on the tight latex — when did Tony pull it on? Steve couldn’t stand thinking about it — about anything at all — so he grasped himself under his knees to spread himself completely. Through the sound of his beating pulse he heard a ragged sigh and momentarily felt a pang of sharp pain.
“Tell me,” Steve asked wordlessly, peering into the desperate brown eyes. “Maybe it isn’t that bad. I thought you’d cringe forever if you saw me like this”.
When a couple of smoking bones were left of Rumlow — figuratively speaking, but Pierce was sure that it’s not for long — Captain gave all of them a heavy look.
“And are you able to draw them in, after..?” Tony asked. “I didn't mean it!” he added hurriedly when Steve blushed and tried to cover curves and bends bulging everywhere. “I meant, do you need help or..?”
The cork gave in suddenly easily: it familiarly hummed to Steve’s hand and flashed with blue and white, showing a strange mechanical pattern on it. The bottleneck belched a long trail of hissing blue smoke.
What little air remained between them heated up quickly. Steve pushed it into Tony, who was panting heavily and trying stubbornly to return every boiling sigh. Steve felt his hands stroking his back and waist — and then pressing hard on the small of his back…
“Whether you are outdated or not, you clearly don’t want to let me consider my wishes,” Steve noted. “What about turning time backward?”
Pierce just swallowed hungrily. He was driven wild with such news and inevitable meals from preserves.
Pierce thumped through issues and pages one by one. The solemn necrology of Red Skull. The photo series: Rogers in a sable parade uniform, Stark with sour face to the right of him, profusely decorated Viewing Room. A new program of Hydra development. The severe article promising internal probes and arrests of some Hydra showy figures who abused the cloth…
Tony frowns. He has a headache despite yesterday he didn’t drink any alcohol at all and even went to bed at eight hours before getting up. Even a year before it would seem unbelievable to him. “Maybe, I’m getting old?” he wonders internally, but then he drinks a coffee and considers it nonsense.
“I was carried away,” Tony shrugged. “I decided to make a big boom and slam a door as loud as I could. Why do you look at me like that, Cap? Don’t you suppose I’ll begin to confess my endless love for humanity, do you?”
Schmidt watched it in bewilderment like the other compound inmates, and it wasn’t good kind of bewilderment. Sitwell retold Pierce what he had heard during the last parade. Rogers watched marching soldiers and Stark stood behind him when Schmidt interested: “What is he doing here? Here and not in the torture chamber?”
“I shall not give you such advice.” Tony spun around. “We, genies, don’t crawl into bottles for nothing, as you can see. They drive us there and seal for our sins, and we atone for these sins while we grant others’ wishes instead of our own. Usually, everyone resigns themselves to it very soon.”
Tony breathed out and screwed up his eyes as if he saw a bright light. The next second the light flared up for real: golden and steel bracelets shone white-hot, steamed, and disappeared. The seal that Steve still held tightly in his hand seemed to flow out through his fingers, and the thin blue smoke faded away. The bottle was the last one: it flickered like air upon the road on a hot day, flashed up with golden green, and vanished.
He, Tony thinks, can’t even answer properly, but he often becomes embarrassed—very funny—and sometimes even blushes. Although, in truth, nothing is interesting in blushing and stuttering Captain Stars And Stripes. Hasn’t Tony seen enough blushing and stuttering people? Also, it’s unpatriotic.
Meghan looked at him with sympathy. It was faked, for sure, but Tony didn't mind. He just had to keep a straight face. Many years' experience helped him pass his painful spasm off as a wry smile.
The next morning started with the stuttered report of Commandant of the most northern Hydra compound. He informed commanders that Alexander Pierce was missing.
“I’m here,” he answered, focusing on coming to his senses. He hardly remembered that he was in the conference room and there were people all around. “What’s the catch? When someone promises to fix it all, there is always a catch.”
Captain Hydra paused for a couple of seconds, kissed him thoroughly and deeply, and confessed, “You know… I think it’s the same for me. I need only you and fuck them all.”
“And then I kissed with the common good, no less,” Tony said in an equally angry tone. “And it was so exciting that I couldn’t stop for a good five minutes.”
Barton turned to Peter and said, “I warn you, not a word about Budapest… And by the way, how do we know that it worked?”
Tony was widening his eyes more and more, his brows were crawling up. Steve’s jaw was just hanging open.
Blue petals with a triangle edge. Steve found them in the sink after he took a shower, dried himself with a towel, and combed his hair. He stared at them for a minute, trying to understand where they came from when he just spent half an hour under the hot water, and before that, he wore a helmet. This very helmet he didn’t take off the whole mission until his coming back. And they didn’t go out of the city for a month so no flowers could get inside the helmet.
At night there is such a beautiful sky upon the forest, that in no way Tony could guess it can be like this. It’s dark, and deep (by the way, Tony scarcely avoided death in a space, so he should have known that it’s a vast abyss), and full of stars. Tony isn’t like Lady Gaga or someone else, he can’t parallel these things with brilliants, he can only describe them through formulas. But formulas don’t work here. Other teammates exchange jokes, roll open sleeping bags, carry water for morning routines, drink tea from camp-cups. Tony keeps staring in the sky.
“Electricity preserves everything,” Tony said. “You just need to know how to deal with it. And now kiss me again… by the way, could I..? You know? Count them?”
“What, you haven’t found marigolds?” Steve forced himself to say. His head turned into complete flower chaos. All thoughts vanished away.
“You are a machine,” Steve said quietly, trying to perceive how it’s possible. These thick eyelashes, brown eyes, tiny wrinkles around them, a bit asymmetrical earlobes—how? Furious and tender nature, unique manners—how? And how it seemed that Tony was able to live by the brew of coffee seeds, and machine oil, and nothing else… machine oil, good God!.. and why nobody saw him sleeping, and… “But how! Only God could create such perfection!”
“I’m not Loki. I’m really not him, believe me. I need to meet Mr. Stark and Captain, it’s urgent. You… we… have a great problem, Hawkeye. Avengers have a great problem, and even a rocket through a portal can’t solve it.”
Meghan McCain met him with a smile a couple degrees warmer than the official grin of a popular talk show presenter.
“Fuck! Fuck-fuck-fuck! They’re too light and soft. I’ve told you, SHIELD devices should stay in SHIELD so it won’t make people laugh. And won’t ruin people’s lives. Come on, sunshine…”
When flowers started to grow under the cap, it felt awful—as if something unrelentingly crawled across his skin. They were too short on space, and Steve wanted to pull off the cap, shook his head, and combed the whole garden with his fingers. Or Tony’s fingers.
Yes. Steve Rogers, the Captain, had a terrible secret. But Tony loved secrets? Maybe he would be interested in it? Steve didn’t doubt one thing—that Tony wouldn’t think worse of him. Whatever the yellow press wrote, Tony had a golden heart.
“So, nothing at all?” Peter looked miserably at a big screen—which was quite a refreshing feature for the dark archaic interior of the house down Bleecker street. News tickers matched chaotic footage from Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt; there were no signs of a smile on the flashing faces of passersby, journalists, and politicians. “No chance whatsoever?”
“It’s gentiána vérna,” JARVIS intervened, “or the spring gentian. It can be found everywhere but in the Arctic. It’s early flowering, buds are produced right after snow break.”
“You imagine that,” Stark said, but it was clear that Rogers didn’t imagine anything and that this bastard was going to keep it up.
“Mr. Stark!” Peter shouted so loud that Clint’s comm choked in surprise. “I need to talk to you, right now!”
“...Stark,” Strange finished ruthlessly. “He and Captain are the keys to every Universe, and there is only one exception. Just listen till the very end before crying that I give you an impossible choice. Because in fact, we have no choice.”
Meanwhile, Hulk settles up his affairs with plaster and takes up on Tony. Maybe he also thinks that Iron Man looks like a cute bee.
She makes wonderful reports. Her diagrams, schemes, plans, and pyramids are so nice. And Pep is so nice too, Tony needs to tell her, show her, make her feel it with all her body…
“And I don’t give a damn about your opinion,” Peter snapped, because he had nothing to lose, “do you hear me? I mean you can eat a raw frog if it helps to save someone…”
“No!” Peter shrunk back. A bright station break with the White House appeared on the screen, the President surrounded by star-spangled flags taking over the place of frightened presenters. The time came to address the nation; to confused, shocked, vulnerable people who had no protection in the face of the upcoming threat. Peter would give up everything to get things back to normal, but Mr. Stark?..
Also, Rogers was used to see Winter Soldier beside him since early childhood, and it was one more reason to delay his murder in the case of failure.
“Why do we make a fuss of him?” Rumlow surprised theatrically. He didn’t notice oncoming danger. “Punch him in his teeth a couple of times, he’ll be obedient.”
Peter listened to all that while rushing from hope to desperation and from desperation back to hope. Maybe, he thought, Doctor Strange was watching us right now, chewing popcorn. Do wizards eat popcorn? Do cats eat bats?
“Something like that, yes,” Peter stared at the priest intently. Judging by his face, he was practicing his Christian patience and humbling before hardships. “You won’t run with screams of horror, will you? Trust me, so much depends on this marriage!”
“Your rank won’t let me send you to jail,” Schmidt added dully, “but it doesn’t mean that I will stand such behavior from the officer who should give an example to privates. As soon as doctors let you, you’ll go to inspect Alaska. Cool your heels a little bit.”
“I haven’t lied,” Tony tried to step back, but the tentacles moved faster. They caught him by his waist, preventing an escape. Steve didn’t have time to think of something properly before it. “Although, I’m not clockwork but electrical, so…”
“Do you think that in all five hundred years no one has tried such a trick?” Tony’s face fell for a moment. “Don’t forget about the damn Codex. Howard tried to break it too, but sometimes ancient technologies are so stubborn… although, you already know it. You’re a guy from a bottle, a product of laboratory experiment, and look at your persistence.”
So Alexander Pierce provided himself with bugging in the hallowed principle. Barnes’ arm was clear from suspicion, the security system considered it as its part, and the sound transmission was quite good, despite sporadic noises.
After that Hydra lost many of its security specialists, and Rumlow was returned to the cell in the heat of the moment. Alexander Pierce decided to discover no matter what which black magic Tony Stark was using to lead Rogers a dance.
Now Mr. Stark looked at him with amazement of a man who didn’t use to feel amazement, while Captain looked at him warily and a bit angrily.
“Please,” Steve asked, “just say yes or no. My mind switches off when I hear something about correlations and quantum jumps. And when you are near me too.”
“I’m a busy genie, I have no time to wait while you consider something,” Tony said arrogantly, but Steve seemed to see in his eyes relief mixed with annoyance. Obviously, he didn’t want to return to the bottle so soon. “I could turn time backward but for the Codex. If it was so easy, every genie could get into their last day of freedom and change something there. Although, I can create an illusion of the past for you, and it will be so real that you can’t distinguish it from the true world.”
“Give them to me, kid,” Clint reached his hand. Hesitating, Peter dropped two simple rings on it and took a step back. It was just in time: Romanoff pushed forward the puzzled priest in a dusty and slightly burned soutane.
Sitwell was smarter and more experienced in team communication, so he moved very carefully and inconspicuously into the relatively safe distance, away from the heavy Cap’s look.
There he got news only from reports (he had learned to read them between the lines long ago) and rare messages from Rumlow. Pierce didn’t expect that Rumlow would keep in touch with a disgraced fellow officer, but it seemed he just needed to release his annoyance and bewilderment.
“I’ll knock you out,” Steve promised, carefully spreading dust and soot across his face. Peter saw him reddened even through all this dirt. “I’m serious, Tony.”
Steve kissed him. Just couldn’t help it. Lightning from the wide-open chest jabbed him sweetly and sharply, the soft bitter mouth let him in, and the electrical heart broke into a gallop. Steve longed to hug Tony closer and tighter, but it was way more terrifying to harm a fragile mechanism. So Steve just said, “You have it. The most alive heart on Earth, Tony. And if it was a single reason to…”
“What you’ve heard,” Steve snapped back. “The boy is right. It’s not a big sacrifice if it provides the safety of humanity in the end. We went there ready to die, and this isn't death…”
“I talked with Logan,” Strange said. “His case is the only precedent of successful change of our reality I know. He is a rare churl and foul-mouthed man, but he managed to do it.”
“Tony, I…” Steve started without even knowing what to say. He knew only one thing—he had ruined everything. No flower could fix it, even if all his petals predicted “yes”, and “he loves you”, and “it will be okay”. To release his tentacles in the face of a guy that you had been pining for so long… “Fuck. It’d be better if I just came here without my pants, right?”
“I have no idea,” Tony shrugged with tan shoulders. “I grant wishes and not pry into people’s private lives.”
“You have something,” for sure, Natasha saw what it was. Maybe she even knew the specific name, area of species, and practical uses, but she just waved her hand around her head, “blue in your hair.”
To be honest, it would be better if Cap had screamed it. It seemed, they all felt close to a thunderstorm, so they all hunched. Everyone was praying for the same as Pierce.
“...then we’ll overcome the time-travel paradox and make adjustments to the continuum of events, and we won’t even need Strange’s help! How do you like it? Cap? Hey, Cap, are you still there?”
Hulk becomes bored, and bored Hulk is totally unbearable Hulk. So he finally catches Tony. Holds, nuzzles, and hits a wall with him.
“Well, I have to go,” Rhodes said and disappeared at an amazingly quick speed. Captain watched his going.
“So you recommend enlisting this man — this man, who is a genius, a pain in the ass and the most persistent Hydra enemy — with a couple of punches in the teeth?”
Friend, yes. Whose name was… how was that… Rhodes. Pierce managed to forget about him and it was inexcusable negligence. Rhodes was seriously injured during the last mission; the broken spine wasn’t a joke. Pierce would liquidate him if he wasn’t the lever of pressure for Stark. Where was that Rhodes now? Most likely, he went into his bed in the prison hospital...
The next day, the Daily Bugle published their photo full of flowers. Along the bottom edge, there was a huge title “AVENGERS SET A NEW TREND. Florists are excited.” With amazing delicateness, it ignored the fact that Steve and Tony were holding hands.
Tony still dozes off, but in his sleepiness, he clearly realizes that Rogers stutters and flusters only with him. He gives sassy answers to everyone else. Tony realizes it—and falls asleep. Where is justice?
"I imagined for a second that it's all real. That you really left me and I have to live without you somehow. And I... I don't know how to do it." He nuzzled between Steve's neck and shoulder, enjoying familiar warmth.
“Almost six. It would have been six years next week.” Tony sat back in his chair, trying to look relaxed. “But 'almost' doesn’t count, does it?”
“I’ve eaten them too,” Steve grumbled. “We were in an encirclement, we counted even a frog our good fortune.”
“I guess so… and I’m afraid to ask why,” Steve understood already that he let out chaos. He only hoped that the magic bottle wasn’t an analog of Pandora’s box. Although, Tony struck him as a guy with whom you could come to an agreement.
“And it’d kill at least half of the live creatures in the northern seas,” Steve said. “I am not worth such a price… but why do you tell me this?”
“Sorry. I needed to balance them.” Steve honestly tried to say it apologetically, but failed. “Before we go… You know, it seems it’s dangerous to complete my to-do list. There is “Star Trek” there, and from what I know the characters talk science while they are not adventuring.”
A rabbit hole. A vacuum cleaner. A tunnel with a light at the end of it. There were so many ways to describe the indescribable. Peter heard a distant shout—somewhere in many miles from him, although in fact it was many days—of Nat, and then something red and soft enveloped him and squeezed from all sides.
“I don’t doubt.” Strange took Peter by the hand and whispered hurriedly, “They’ll remember what they need to remember. You’ll forget what you need to forget. Then both realities will unite in one because, in fact, it is one…”
“I just wanted… I know, it’s silly, but I wanted to tell them how much…” Peter sighed. “How I need them, both, how… and by the way, didn’t they have questions when I disappeared?”
But look at him now. Twenty-first century. The full sink of flowers (three! three petals and a stamen were more than enough). And he thought that it was just a short passion.
“You’re a wise guy,” he said. “So it isn’t all about your muscles. I have to confess, I’m glad even. It’s boring in the bottle and I have no one to talk to except for myself and maybe Friday… but I become tired of it too soon. Okay, I’ll brew you coffee for free, you should appreciate my generosity.”
Although he knows exactly that right now he is extremely cold. He is so cold that he is ready to complain, whine, and ask to do something right now. Get a fire going, for example? He doesn’t know where to start (he specializes in conflagrations), but he isn’t alone here, and Captain I Can Tell You How To Survive At War should be able to do it, of course!
“I broke my tailbone,” Peter grumbled. “Couldn’t you warn me that you began to pull me out? I didn’t make it to…”
Tony won’t tell anybody, but he hasn’t been to a cocaine party the day before. In fact, he’s never been to one of those. Tony doesn’t like drugs—they make a person stupid. Also, he’s never had enough time because of endless ideas in his head. And because he feels too much alive (especially considering those people who died for him). Psht.
Steve rubbed his cheek, leaving a long black line on it, and mumbled, “Well, it isn’t so obvious, but… Stark, are you serious?”
Tony huffed softly in his shoulder, “That’s for sure, Steve. Don’t worry. Once you’ve made a quantum jump, it’s almost impossible to turn the clock back. Do you remember what I said about time loops and quantum-entangled particles?”
On Tuesday evenings Avengers meet in the common room and watch movies. It’s a tradition. Tony always picks a movie first, because: it’s his Tower, his popcorn, and his sofa. Rogers is after him because he is the oldest in the room (“Hey!” Rogers smiles in his manner. “I’m only twenty-six!”). Then Natasha, because Tony isn’t suicidal. Bruce said at the very beginning that he doesn’t lay any claims, so he is the last one. Thor picks a movie right after Natasha, if otherwise, he drives everyone mad with endless, “Why do you say that it is not my turn? It cannot be that we won’t watch the movie about the brave quest of tiny but fearless hobbits today!” It’s easier to play “The Lord of the Rings” than explain to him that they really won’t watch and it’s really not his turn. Therefore, Clint’s turn is after Thor but before Bruce.
“You should fall out of the habit of speaking for other people, Steve,” Tony said. He paused for a bit dramatically and continued, “Yes. Of course, I don’t deserve this knight without fear and reproach, but this is a chance of a lifetime, and in no fucking way will I lose it.”
“This is something worse, Cap,” Tony grinned sweetly. “Believe me, it’s worse. And don’t forget about Pepper, she’ll skin me alive… but you know, I don’t care, such opportunity is given once in a lifetime. It’s not my style to reject fun on the verge of lunacy.”
“Sir, the concentration of aminazin vapor inside the suit is over the allowable limit in twelve… thirteen… fifteen… I recommend you to…”
“Okay,” Steve muttered. He was still slightly dizzy from drinking last night despite not being able to get drunk properly. “Okay, old friend. What could you leave me apart from some bomb in the box… ugh, machine in the bottle… or even deus ex machina ex lagoenam, I wouldn’t put it past you.”
All in all, everyone had one question in common—what did Captain America forget in such goddamned society? And Steve was the only one who knew that he, with his secret, belonged here like nowhere else. Moreover, he knew how much the superpowers of other Avengers cost them. Bruce Banner paid for his scientific curiosity in the form of his alter ego, a giant green monster. Clint Barton became an orphan when he was three years old, and then he went deaf after falling from a circus trapeze; now he had to lip-read. After her first successful mission, Natasha gained an ugly scar across her left side. Peter was obsessed with chemistry, and he was shy as hell around girls so he didn’t have a single thought about sex yet. Yes, he had fully functioning spinnerets, but as far as Steve knew, his cock was firmly attached to his groin.
“There is no such thing,” Rogers says in his dream. And covers with an outrageous, nasty, pretty blush, taking off his shirt.
Running in parks. Long hours in the workshop. Tony letting him ride on the new Mark and Steve scolding them both for reckless driving. Problems in school—some smart person did the equation in the end. The most official and boring Christmas in Washington—but then Steve took them to the Arctic, and the aurora borealis was better than any firework. Tony crawling in the kitchen in his pajama pants and grunting about a cruel life with mornings and normal business hours. Training with Steve. A long and hard talk with aunt May. Strict redhead woman named Pepper—she accepted their strange family with surprising ease and always looked after Peter (although he always tried to get away from this care). Cars in the garage. Posters on the walls. That damn spider from the laboratory of the evil guy. Steve drawing him and Tony with charcoal and paint, Tony laughing and asking to apply cubism, for example, instead of realism. Calling from school—Peter punched one asshole in the face with a web because he bullied younger kids. Tony coming to the director in a wig and with makeup—was the deepest shock for everyone, especially Peter. Long waiting and fear while both fathers were fighting with evil somewhere else, and Peter could just… no, in fact, he could do so much!
“Yes, I do believe in them.” The wood creaked — maybe Rogers sat on the stool. “Also, I believe in your sense. You won’t kill me because my dead body is completely useless for you, and the serum will protect me from anything else. Oh, and I want to let you know that I’m not alone here. Winter Soldier is with me.”
“Well, I grabbed the first bouquet I ran onto and rushed back. As if I knew that you would fall to…”
Steve sighed heavily and took him by the arm, squeezing his elbow. Tony paused and lifted his eyebrows in surprise.
Steve couldn’t remember for the life of him what he had said that very first second. It seemed it was something stupid, like “but how?”, or “where have you been?”, or even “for the love of God, Tony, did you finally forgive me?”.
But sometimes it’s just necessary to maintain his image created by the media. It’s not that Tony even remotely likes this image (although, the rumor about twelve Maxim girls was quite nice).
Peter took out his phone and started typing in. “I can get a license in a second. Then I’ll pay a marriage fee… or no, I don’t have an account now, damn it…”
Peter turned away wisely. He suspected that he had enough shock today. Romanoff nodded approvingly and whispered, “I suppose they have the shield instead of a bouquet. Will Cap throw it? What do you think?”
Tony nodded dazedly and took the flower. He brought it to his face as if he wanted to smell it and breathed in deeply. He drew in a lungful of air, and something tinged in his chest. Or maybe Steve worried too much and it was just ringing in his ears.
He needed allies in his investigation, but the search of them dragged on. Even in the past, everyone had been afraid of Rogers, but now everyone gave him an even wider berth. There were rumors in the compound that a young agent assigned to Stark once wanted to flirt with a prisoner. He still was a most famous bisexual billionaire, and the Blue Hustler channel declared him the most wanted bachelor of the year three times… until that hotbed of vice was shut. So Agent Jenkins brought him a cheeseburger, triple strength Starbucks coffee, and a box of donuts, cracked him a couple of cheap jokes, and arranged a tomorrow date. Tomorrow he was tied to a rocket ready to practice shooting in Mexico, and Rogers commanded “fire” turning a deaf ear to everyone around him.
“Because he managed that, Peter,” Strange repeated calmly. “Only you and I will remember the other possible outcome. If we succeed, of course.”
“He is working,” Captain answered shortly. “He needs to see ammunition in action so he can improve it afterward.”
“Come on. They’ll fetch us from here, but no less than in two hours. I’ll get a runny nose at the most, but you…”
“By the way, I saved your digital copy to my computer,” Rogers said blandly. “It’s very interesting to talk with him.”
“Rogers became even stranger than earlier.” That was at the end of the letter. “He says that democracy is the decent evolution of Hydra ideals and that true order is impossible without freedom. I think he has gone mad. He let Stark experiment with the Cube and all that stuff. You are a smart son of a bitch, Alex, Alaska is safer right now.”
“As if it will be much more of them if I accept your offer. World order, are you serious? Where am I with this world order, Rogers? And I still want to know how you plan to control my loyalty. Which collar will you put on me?”
Tony kept it from sheer sentimentality; it was an old robot that survived through steamvolution. Like Steve, Dum-E was a product of the past, but it could have adjusted to the future and didn’t feel as if it was an ancient artifact. Steve looked in its back for several seconds.
“You almost died for all of us,” Steve reminded. It seemed that he continued to argue through habit. “It doesn’t look like an egoistic deed, does it?”
Steve nodded, and the feeling of being hit with a ton of bricks intensified. When Tony said the magic words “time-space continuum”, Steve’s mind tried to switch off and give room to cheeky instincts. If he were to be completely honest, to one specific instinct.
At first, it was comparatively harmless: yes, Cap became a frequent visitor in a jail complex, but it was even good in some sense! At least, everyone sighed with relief at first, from sentries to Herr Schmidt himself, because Cap literally harassed him with long talks about the inevitable victory of progressive Hydra formation.
“Anyone who will try to oversee him will definitely be in danger,” Winter Soldier countered. He was visibly tired, his artificial arm was covered with soot and his hair was grimed with whitewash. They worked like mad to reconstruct the destroyed compound, there were no exclusions for anyone.
“Winter Soldier,” Pierce said with meaning and thoroughly measured warning, “was glad to have his prosthesis at first too. But then…”
It was clear for all of them. Pierce shivered involuntarily, feeling nasty tickle between his shoulder blades. Okay, maybe Stark had his reasons to not blow up and poison Captain, but right now Captain was telling them with crystal clarity that he also needed alive and mostly unspoiled Stark. Mhm.
To his shame, Steve could only stand there blinking dumbly. The blue smoke drifted away, leaving a tan guy around twenty years old. He had brown eyes, dark hair, an elaborate beard, and plump cherry lips—it was obscene for a man to have such lips. This guy reminded Howard as a son would remind his father, except Howard always wore Rolex and diamond cufflinks on his wrists and not a pair of fancy bracelets made of gold and steel.
Mosquitoes buzz, hover, and sting. Tony is extremely bored; he already regrets that he has accepted the offer and even organized this boyscout dream.
“You know,” he said, “probably I won’t wait till universal suffrage becomes a thing. Cap is too perfect, I’m afraid that someone can take him from me.”
“Did you?” Steve went around the angry spouse and tousled his hair—to Peter’s amazement. Tony didn’t say a word; however, Peter gave a gasp of surprise when the big callous hand tousled his hair too. “Son, are you alright?”
“Please, take the “but” aside,” Peter begged. “Listen to me, I’m not crazy, I swear, and if you need a priest, I’ll bring him with my own hands! Or at least I’ll ask somebody…”
“You are such a dick,” he answered blatantly and gracefully. “Tony was right to shoot at people like you, and it’s a pity that it wasn’t enough. Are you able to be strong only with disabled people? Although, I can beat you even with my prostheses if you dare to come closer with that brainwashing thing of yours.”
Well, long story short, sometimes Hulk gets very naughty. It’s not like Tony doesn’t hint at Natasha that she should keep an eye on her boyfriend, but it’s no more than a hint—if you go too far, you can expect knives under your ribs and needles under your fingernails. But that’s the problem: Natasha doesn’t understand hints. She stares at you deadly and doesn’t understand expressively and pointedly, and you sweat between shoulder blades.
That’s a hell of a question. Steve imagined how he would come to Tony and take him by the hand, or, maybe, just sit beside him and blurt that he dreams about their happy life together: lazy morning sex, city walks, nature trips (okay, maybe his fantasies didn’t go further than picnics in Central Park), and holding hands during press conferences. Even if only under the table. Right after feverish fuck in a service area. Just as Steve thought that they would sleep in one bed, about five flowers bloomed on his head. The one above the left brow had an especially long stem, and it fell on the forehead, tickling him awfully.
“If it’s contagious, I want… how that’s… marigolds! They are orange and smell nice!” Tony touched one of the flowers, caressing petals, and Steve closed his eyes. He didn’t groan and considered it a victory.
One of the tentacles hugged him by shoulders. The second one touched the small of his back as if trying to prevent an escape attempt. It was indecent, almost obscenely so, but it looked like Tony didn’t mind it. Quite the opposite, he stepped forward and it seemed he was afraid that it’s the last time, that Steve would push him away at any moment, that…
“Yes, yes,” Stark interrupted him. “For example, you lost your mind from your loneliness, for you came to the criminal without any guards. Do you believe in your reflexes to this extent, Cap?”
“I still won’t,” he says heavily, “catch up with you. You’ve been frozen, in the first place. For seventy years.”
“Ohhh,” he groaned loudly. It seemed his head was going to burst. And it wasn’t surprising: the whole eight years were pouring into it right now and everything was falling into place, like an automatically gathering puzzle, so it’s no wonder to go mad from all that… But Peter knew that he wouldn’t go mad. He was raised by the two bravest, strongest, craziest, and the most stubborn fathers in this Universe (and every other Universe too), so he… he…
“It’s nothing,” Steve assured patiently. “I’ll start. Tony, I’ve known you for a lot shorter time than I’d want to. But it’s fixable, you know. I understand that it all should be different, and that we do it on the run, and that we don’t really fit together… but we have something in common. Something that is the most important thing on Earth. And I can give my life for that.”
Alarms were blaring around, someone was shouting in a loudspeaker, an unknown city bird was tweeting hysterically, searching for its lost nest.
“I know, it’s risky,” Tony nodded. “But there is no other way, I’m sure as only a physicist can be sure, and since I know the difference between Bohr and boron, and between Thor and a torus…”
on a date with him than go, but nobody asked him out. He shrugged; it’s needless to say that Tony got distracted by something and didn’t see it.
To Stark’s credit, he didn’t startle. He didn’t even shout—he just froze, staring at unfolding tentacles. Then he put the shield aside slowly, sighed equally slowly, and stood up in the same slow manner.
“I decided to visit you. They say that loneliness can result in crazy actions, and you are already…”
Steve and Tony exchanged looks, and Tony asked in a completely different voice, “That thing that you wear. Can I have a look at it?”
This evening the whole Instagram discusses a photo of Tony burrowing his face into papers. He is rather unshaven, rather dirty, and looks like a person who catches up his sleep after a drug trip. The next day Tony signs a pile of documents, including one where he delegates the CEO post of Stark Industries to Pepper.
“Then—are you ready to take children with love and bring them up as worthy men?” the priest asked. He definitely decided to follow Captain’s example and do his duty no matter what. “Bringing up future generations is an important and crucial task.”
Before that Widow listened closely to their dialogue. Suddenly she said something to Clint and dissolved in debris. Peter could only hope that she didn’t go for some terrifying torture device. He stared pleadingly at the potential newlyweds.
“Hydra and you are not the same. Yet. I could try to be with you, but Hydra doesn’t tolerate me, and it will bite my head off at the earliest opportunity.”
Pierce heard quiet noise — Stark tapped his fingers on a table. It seemed as if he imitated Morse signals: “t-e-l-l-m-e, t-e-l-l-m-e”. Pierce shook his head because it was too crazy of a thought.
“And I will forget,” Tony said in the same tone, “I swear, I’ll forget everything and beat the shit out of you, Steven. How many times have I asked you to stop driving Peter crazy with your damn magic!”
“I want to cry,” Tony muttered. “Joking. Cap, this story is completely foolish and totally incredible—even for me. If this is our start, I’m afraid to imagine the continuation. Yep, this is scary… but interesting, so I won’t regret it, that’s for sure. We can deal with other problems through my bank account or workshop and your vibranium principles. We’ll work it out.”
Tony sits, rubs his eyes, sips a cold coffee, and promises full-heartedly, “It won’t happen again! I’ll bet anything! I… I’ll even shave!”
Captain didn’t let anyone into his plan of how to win Stark over to the right side, not even Schmidt. Everyone heard just slightest hints, like yes, Stark was kept in prison, but his cell could outrank a good hotel. He had a personal shower, not only with hot water but with a hydromassage as well, a full-sized bed, a workbench, and a small library. He had even a drawing board, and at first Pierce chuckled, because there was no reason for that son of the digital age to know how the real engineers had worked back then. Rogers somehow felt his fun and promised that Stark’s first task would be the project of Pierce’s cinerary urn. Admittedly, no one hurried to give him projects to work on, but Stark proved that he could use the drawing board professionally. At least, the words “FUCK YOU” were written according to all the rules of a technical drawing.
All in all, Tony got angry at the wrong moment—the day before the board meeting. All night he was working on a concept of maybe not exactly a pluggable brain but an additional data storage for the human nervous system. That’s forty-eight hours on pure caffeine. At least, JARVIS counted forty-eight hours. In fact, it’s closer to sixty. And Pepper Potts has just returned from her China business trip to present her report to the board.
“I didn’t mean it.” He assured quickly, turning the watches on his wrist nervously. It contained a voice record of codes that controlled Hydra's live weapon. It was made after one unfortunate incident with Winter Soldier’s bionic arm and the throat of his curator. “But if you would have to choose Schmidt or Rogers, who would you choose?”
After a pause Captain said almost gently, “Stark, have you really just complimented me and made eyes at me? Do you think that I’ll go all soft and become an easy mark for you after that?”
Steve wanted to kiss him so badly. Wanted to press his lips to those soft and tender eyelids, feel a mild prickle of those eyelashes. Wanted to stand like that, breathing scents of lead, and salt, and kerosine, and fashionable ether, and leather cover pieces in goggles, and Tony himself—an unbearably and insufferably desirable man. Wanted to know that Tony let him do anything, that Tony wanted it too.
Everybody knows since a long time ago that it’s forbidden to disturb Avengers on Tuesday evenings (apart from cases with Moon falling on Earth). And if someone doesn’t know, then JARVIS communicates with them. He can carry on really fascinating phone conversations. When he has a worthy companion, of course. Sometimes people simply forget why they call (once it’s happened to Fury; nobody should mention it).
“I’m sorry, Steve, it’s a pretty garden but it’s far from okay. Let’s come to the lab.” Bruce threw the remote to Natasha and stood up. “We’ll watch Gremlins after we figure out what your attack of flower-bearing is about.”
It was sound advice, so Steve nodded, stripped off the rest of his clothes, met Tony’s wild stare and turned around slowly. He showed off and felt like dying because it seemed that Tony was touching him everywhere just by looking, and they both were falling into a hot dark abyss.
Tony sighed mercifully and asked him almost in a friendly manner, “Holy father, are you serious? Could you find anyone in New York, or, if it comes to this, in the whole country, who wouldn’t love Cap? And even enemies respect him; it’s gospel truth!”
“What do you think it is?” Rogers’ voice was full of amusement. And of excitement, too. Pierce heard such enthusiasm from him maybe a couple of times in all his life, no more. “Total control, despotism, executions every Sunday, firing squad for every dissenter, all for the bloody world order, where every person is a little cog in a huge, perfect, heartless, and unrelenting machine.”
“I’m not from a bottle. It’s just my strength and health, I must say,” Steve corrected him. “I don’t know what your Codex is, but I am sincerely sorry about it. What do you need to break free?”
“Hi, Meghan. You know, my silence will only result in wild rumors and fantasies, and I don’t want that.”
Meghan nodded and said, addressing the public, “So, today’s topic is infidelity and divorce. Who could guess that famous playboy Tony Stark would come here as an injured party? For how long have you been married, Tony? Five years?”
...not only brought danger but gave you a lot of chances. Of course, if you were smart and cautious enough!
“You brought in the big guns, didn’t you?” Stark was saying at the moment. Pierce imagined his face so clearly, that he was itching to smother him despite the distance: narrowed dark eyes, naughty half-smile, healing abrasion on his cheek. “Do you try to snatch the initiative?”
“I hope no,” Barton chuckled. “There is no crowd of jealous girls around. Hm, will they stop kissing? Somewhere in the near future?”
Before Steve could blink away this smoke, the shield was already in his hand. Unknown voice in a surprisingly well-known tone said through the thick shroud, “Wow, what is that? Let me have a look, it’s something new… why, if it isn't vibranium!”
To Clint’s credit, he didn’t hesitate even for a second. He grabbed Peter and ran so fast that Peter’s ears were almost blocked.
Tony’s breath was even hotter than his fingers, and his beard didn’t prickle but caressed. Steve barely held down his tentacles which strived forward stronger and stronger with every second. He wished to squeeze this waist, tear off the long leather apron, reach for this olive, sweet-and-salty, cherished body… Tony wouldn’t let it, nobody would let it, but…
“I know that neither collar nor cuffs can hold you.” Rogers’ voice sounded almost wistfully. Pierce didn’t want to know about his fantasies at that moment. “You like to invent and hate to be bored. I will allow you to invent, provide with any materials, and…”
“Howard strived to find you on his own,” Tony said after a pause. “He almost spent his second wish to turn the Gulf Stream towards the Arctic. So the warm water would help to find you. It’d melt ice.”
Rogers blushes, despite all his strength and muscles. Tony cuddles to the hot and firm chest and decides that his complex feeling towards Cap Great America is a mix of hate, admiration, and amazement. Yeap. Grim and thrilling cocktail.
His fingers slipped further, got into his briefs, still wet from the recent impromptu orgasm, and tightened on his cock. Steve groaned again, making sounds he didn’t know he’d been capable of producing. Such hungry, greedy, pleading sounds. Tony had little rough calluses on his hands, and every time they caressed the sensitive head and the swollen shaft, it gave Steve a full-body shiver. There was only one thing he wanted.
“I couldn’t because someone needs to control the travel and get you out of there when it’s all over,” Strange explained patiently. “And look after the reality. You are a good guy, Peter, but reality can’t deal with two Peter Parkers at once all by itself. And take that, you’ll need it.”
The priest (Peter sincerely sympathized with him) looked around, drew some conclusions, and just asked, “Are you Christians at least?”
Pierce felt that he was sweating from head to toe. Stark flirted shamelessly and dropped hints, searching for a weakness. A day ago — an hour ago! — Pierce would stake his life that Rogers wouldn’t buy on such cheap tricks. Well, he was lucky that he didn’t stake anything. It seemed that Rogers was too deeply affected by his past when he had pretended to be one of Avengers. Of course, he kept a straight face… yet, but even baby Sharon Carter couldn’t provoke that purring in Captain’s voice. “They lack only music.” Pierce thought angrily. “Argentine tango. It’s too obvious how they go round each other.”
Winter Soldier was slow-witted after his resettings, and the last one had been yesterday, Pierce had controlled it personally. The maintenance of a weapon of mass destruction was a constant pain in the ass, just a small distraction or safety violation could cause many big troubles. Although, Winter Soldier was impossibly quick on the uptake right now, maybe because of the stress.
“I’ve made this uniform,” he said. “And don’t ask me, how it is possible, I see this boy for the first time, but clearly not for the last. He knows not only about fucking Budapest and the rocket, he knows what will be next. Do you understand? Somewhere in the future, maybe in ten years…”
And it helps! Grass snake slips out of the sleeping bag and disappears in a moment. And it’s enormous! Two yards, maybe. Or even three!
“Listen, Stark. I know you won’t get it. For God’s sake, you always don’t get the simplest things that even a baby can understand. So, maybe, you should learn it by heart. Or write it down.”
Screens lit and showed those photos. Tony knew that blonde woman: it was Steve's colleague, Sharon Carter. He closed his eyes.
“Forget about it,” Winter Soldier cut off firmly, although in a flat voice. “If you want to meddle there, I’m out of the game.”
Once Tony’s chest had been smooth and beautifully sculptured. His strong muscles were still attractive, but the whole area from the collarbones to the abdomen transformed into one uneven scar, as if someone cruel peeled skin from there, tore it apart, and stuck back—roughly, wryly, ugly. It seemed even more surreal because a round glass was shining with blue light in the center of this monstrous scar, and wingnuts along the edges of this glass held it all together. Tony noticed Steve’s shocked gaze and twisted his mouth. Then he unscrewed one of the wingnuts and opened his little porthole. The light shone even brighter, and Steve seemed to let out some indistinct sound.
“But I don’t want to!” Steve removed the cap and breathed out relaxingly. As much as his heart pounded right now, squeezed flowers had bothered him way much more than embarrassment.
“So, are you convinced now?” He started right off the bat when Winter Soldier came round the corner. “Rogers is dangerous, and Stark…”
“And… when?” he asked. He childishly hoped that Strange would give him a couple of days or at least a couple of hours. He could go and say goodbye to this world in case he wouldn’t return or there wouldn’t be anything left for him to return. He could eat Danny Meyer’s hamburgers, he could risk his life and ask Miss Romanoff whether it’s true that bees sting redheads more often than others, he could try and cope with a full nut roll made by aunt May…
“Mr. Stark! Captain!” He appeared near them in one jump. “I need to tell you something very important. It’s the most important thing! There is nothing more important than that!”
He even managed to pull Tony closer and feel his damp prickly cheek against his shoulder — was it tears? It couldn’t be. After, Steve laid motionless, living through those priceless intimate moments for the first time. At last, Tony stirred and murmured, sending goosebumps all over Steve’s damp skin, “The damn quantum jump. Do you know what it is?”
And it would be fine but for one thing: Rogers said they need as little comfort and as much overcoming as possible. So they leave the car (“That means the Iron Man suit as well, Stark!”) and walk to the camp.
“Right now. Hurry up, I can’t put this world on hold for more than a few hours. And don’t worry, Peter, they are the same Captain and Mr. Stark you know. Maybe they’ve made a bit fewer mistakes because they haven’t had so much time, maybe…”
“I’m a genie, after all,” he said. “Your wish is my command and so on… So what about coffee? I’m really good at this, and by the way, now I can—I can, but I don’t have to, that’s the most precious thing—fulfill your every wish… or our wish if we want the same!”
“I hate to build weapons,” Stark said slowly. “And I hate captivity. You offer me a long beautiful lead and sweet carrot, but what about everyone else? What’s the purpose of Hydra? What’s your purpose, Rogers?”
“It’s nonsense. Steve, you’re still my friend, and…” he sighed heavily. “You’ve already guessed it, right?”
Barton pretended that he lost something, and Nat gave him a hearty slap upside the head. He immediately remembered that he is the best man and placed dimly sparkled rings on Steve’s broad and strong hand.
Nobody looked at them. Of course, all the people there just ate and someone else’s confessions didn’t concern them at all—that’s why different parts of the Avengers team went there at least twice a month. Steve caught Tony’s gaze, with pointed meaningfulness and slowness pulled three flowers out of his mobile garden and held them out.
It turned out that he really went, although it was quite literally: he went around corridors of the compound wearing some fantastic corset of metal and plastic. Two doctors mother-henned him chirping something about a revolutionary breakthrough in the rehabilitation of polytrauma. Pierce spitted, moved the doctors aside, and stared at Rhodes heavily. He looked at Pierce naughty and calmly and that was not the way how injured captured rebels should look at the Hydra commander.
“Yes,” Peter answered. He stared at them—they were almost like he remembered them, although something was completely different. Mr. Stark didn’t have that bitter wrinkle in his lips corner. Steve didn’t look like his own propaganda poster “Life for Fatherland” (Peter hated it); now he looked like himself—an alive, warm, and solid man. “And how are you two?”
“Thank you, but no,” Steve chuckled. “I’ve had plenty of those earlier, and judging from Coulson's slip of the tongue, I’ll have more than enough in the nearest future. I need to think. I hope it won’t disappoint you too much?”
The end of his phrase was swallowed up with hum and flashing. It seemed that a giant vacuum cleaner surrounded Peter and he was pulling like a mote in the unknown depth, swirling, turning, dragging further and further back…
“Doctor Strange told me,” Peter answered desperately. “He is a magician, wizard. Or else, right now he is just a neurosurgeon, but he’ll become a magician. Very good magician. He searched through every reality and every world, and chaos is everywhere because you two can’t come to an understanding. Only one world is normal. Where Natasha Stark is the wife of Captain Steve Rogers.”
“But you look like his son.” Steve frowned. “I don’t think that Howard created you. It’s too much even for him. How is it possible?”
“Parker’s paradox,” Strange answered calmly. “And don’t be afraid, it’s a scientific term now. No one pays enough attention to scientific terms, and those who pay attention are too clever to talk about it.”
“He rather lacks crushed bricks and a brain,” Tony mutters. He reminds himself Maya the Bee at the moment: he flies and buzzes, when he needs only to aim properly and plug in a couple—or dozen—tranquilizer darts. Usually, Clint does this crap job, but right now he’s stuck on a secret and very important SHIELD mission (as for Tony, he thinks that Clint and Coulson use this code phrase when they arrange themselves a week-long sex marathon on a tiny island somewhere in the ocean; but Tony never mentions his guess near Cap—you never know what could happen).
It turns out that hot dogs on sticks are tasty. Why has Tony never tried hot dogs on sticks? Oh well, he’s never gone on boy scout trips, thank you, father.
Their trip starts early on Tuesday morning, because which sober-minded villain could risk and bring their evil plan into effect on this day of the week? On the other hand, if someone becomes a villain nowadays, it’s already a sign of insanity. There are so many opportunities in this world, and those idiots as one still want to destroy New York. Where are their fantasy and inspiration, huh?
“It’d be too much,” Steve said, recollecting himself. “Yes, too much. Who are you and why were you given to me?”
“So,” he said slowly, “you’re insisting that if we don’t marry, the world will end. Would you care to tell me, Peter, how did you get that knowledge?”
A small package took its place in Peter’s pocket. The President finished his speech, news filled the TV screen once again, and Peter decided.
“May the grace of God descend on those two,” the priest began, and Peter rushed to search for a band. Clint sighed, looked around, and pulled a piece of star-spangled cloth from the pile of broken bricks.
He let out a moan, and Tony caught it with his lips too, but this time he claimed the kiss without giving back. It was so right and long-awaited that Steve wanted to cry for joy. So many years, so many times they orbited each other, fighting over every little matter just because they couldn’t walk by, and now they were finally together, together for real…
Pierce would continue to listen to them, but his receiver crackled, rustled, and Winter Soldier said with suddenly rich emotions: “Fuck it, I can’t stand their cooing no more. I’m back.”
Peter leaned forward, drinking in his every word. He loved life, for God’s sake, and he didn’t want to give up like that. He was raised better than this. And if Strange found an appropriate reality… well, Peter just needed to make the impossible real. And it wasn’t so complicated when you had determination.
“Barnes won’t let it happen,” Rhodey snorted. “Do you remember that… Carter junior? Barnes just asked her for a dance and after that she doesn’t even look at Cap.”
Peter looked at them. They were his family for so long that he couldn’t remember when it started. As if it was forever, as if they forever existed in this world to protect and take care of him—to protect and take care of all imaginable realities… By the way, how did Peter know about it? He couldn’t remember exactly, and just…
“I’d be really surprised and I’d try to tell him as kindly as I could that I am not interested in him. I’m sorry, Steve,” Bruce turned away from new data for a moment and looked at him, “but you are not my type.”
“They say young people get rip-roaring drunk while eating these hot dogs,” Bruce comments Tony’s surprise.
“I’d take a blood analysis,” Bruce looked concerned even though he smiled. “Just in case. Even if I’m not that kind of doctor.”
"You baked an apple pie for me." Tony lifted his head at last and kissed his husband for real. "May I have the dessert first? Last week was difficult."
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Pierce's mind was racing; all things considered, that situation couldn’t end well. Whether Rogers would win over Schmidt or Schmidt would win over Rogers, commanders would be a scapegoat as usual. And Pierce wouldn’t escape many and many problems just because any shift of power…
“What do you think? To almost die suddenly, of course!” When Tony ventures to open his eyes, he sees frightened and angry Rogers.
Tony has one more dark secret which is known to nobody apart from Pepper, Rhodey, Fury, Coulson, and a bunch of other people. He sincerely hates Cap because his father used the perfect image as an example at any opportunity. Forcefully fed a young mind with tasteless oatmeal. Or how they say.
Steve considered it right to follow his advice; he remembered about the gift only in the morning, when all Triskelion was dead to the world. Steve knocked in the convex shell-covered glass and shook the bottle. It seemed something rasped inside rather than plopped.
Tony reached to the flowers, and Steve felt even more goosebumps. They ran down his spine, tickled his fingers, and gathered in his groin.
They turned away and went outside in synch, and Pierce closed his eyes hopelessly. Right now Alaska seemed to him quite a good place.
“I’ve eaten frogs,” Tony commented out of place. “In a cream sauce. It wasn’t as bad as it could have been.”
Rhodes turned right away as if he waited for that and Pierce didn’t have a chance to step back this time. The first big fist hit him in a jaw, the second big fist knocked the hell out of him. Pierce bent trying to catch his breath and punched off the alert button on his wristband…
Steve jumped when he heard Tony’s voice from a moving loudspeaker. It sounded like Tony hadn’t been sleeping for a year or even more. It was time to intervene and take care of him, no matter how much he’d oppose. Steve thought for some reason that Tony wouldn’t disagree too much. The hardest thing was to keep calm and silent, hide feelings that were boiling in his heart—but Steve did that drudgery on the daily basis so he got used to it. He nodded to Dum-E, and the robot took away the loudspeaker, breathed a cloud of steam, and moved somewhere else, its hydraulic system joints creaking on the way.
“Just… don’t stop,” he gasped and once again locked lips with Tony. Then he kissed his stubbled chin, his neck… Steve lingered on the neck to leave some quickly darkening marks, enjoying the sensation of a hurriedly beating pulse. “Oooh…”
“I begin to doubt the successful ending,” Steve muttered but collected himself. “Yes. I’m ready to respect Tony and… and love him. I think there is so much more in him worthy of love than he knows.”
But look what had become of that! After that son of a bitch Stark managed to create his digital copy and put it into the computer system of the compound! The ruins of the armory and jail complex were still smoking, not to mention hangars and weapon depots. Of course, Stark was safe and sound, and he just gave a guiltless gaze and stepped behind Cap’s back when he was faced with the threat of punishment.
Mother had a wood sorrel. He saw it only at the wedding photo, of course, where father sat on a chair in a clumsy costume and mother stood behind his shoulder. She wore a light-colored dress and a thin wreath made of tiny small flowers with pointed petals. Or rather he thought for a long time that it was a wreath, but then mother explained to him. She said that when he loved someone, he couldn’t hide his feelings even for a day. And it would be good—mother stroked his feverish-hot chest—you wouldn’t be deceived, you would know for sure that it isn’t a mistake and you love this person with your whole heart.
“You do have a fever. We’ve just agreed to continue tomorrow. Thor is going to cook a festive dinner and grill something for us. I hope he won’t be fined for poaching. Do fines for poaching still exist?”
“I think that life in the bottle is enough punishment for almost any kind of sin. Even without this thing about others’ wishes,” Steve frowned and shook his head. “What if I simply wish for you to become free?”
Maybe Rumlow was drunk. Or maybe during the last fight, Stark hit him hard in the head. Normally Rumlow wasn’t such an idiot, but now it seemed he lost his marbles, so Pierce followed the example of Sitwell and slowly moved away.
“The compound is safely secured for the first time, and that’s all because of that security check,” Rogers retorted. “Stark just had a wrong education. Now that he sees the power and the truth of Hydra, he will make it up to us. Moreover, we have one of his friends.”
Well, maybe there were other ways to introduce yourself: polite, decent ways meant to win a new acquaintance over from the very first words, but Peter didn’t know them, and even if he knew, he wouldn’t remember at the moment.
The girl screamed so loud that Peter’s ears started to ache. Barton winced, looked at Peter, and asked, “Are you going to have hysterics too? No? Okay, then would you help me?”
Well, now Steve knew what the phrase ‘jaws hung open’ meant in real life. It looked almost fun, but Steve was too nervous to laugh. On top of that, Tony jumped suddenly, looked around, said “umm”, dropped his chair, and ran out to the street.
That’s the problem. Tony doesn’t see anything apart from his discharged suit in this prison cell. It isn’t luxurious at all: a tiny room five on six yards square and from ten to twelve yards high. Even Captain Skipjack can’t jump to the small window just below the ceiling. And it’s barred, for good measure.
The сomm crunched and cracked, and then Mr. Stark’s voice said, “Legolas, welcome back to the real world, I’m glad that you wake up at last. What do you think, we’ve had a moonlight walk till now?”
Steve nodded: he began to understand. Even why Tony had cried too. Steve wasn’t the only one who had taken their sudden intimacy much more seriously than just sex (even the most delightful sex). Tony had something to lose too; he had bridges due to be burned, he had his past that pulled him back and kept from flying ahead. From flying with him, Steve. If they manage to come back and make things right…
Tony jerked suddenly, and Steve shook his head and breathed, “Stay with me. Please. Do you hear me? Please, Tony, I’m… I’m begging you. You have lightning in your heart, it is so… so in your style, only you can do something like that. Maybe, all this time I’ve been waiting for something like this.”
The bottle was fully covered with corals and seaweeds—undoubtedly, it had laid in the water no less than Steve. On top of everything, Coulson handed  it over with the same unintentional deference that Steve had already been fed up with, but not quite used to. Well, one relic definitely could serve as a present for the other relic, so Steve carefully scraped with his nail an intricate seal on a cork.
Herbicide made his head awfully itchy. Bruce changed the formula twice, but Steve suffered from itch and dandruff no matter what, so he decided to use Bruce’s shampoo just if he needed to go public (also, he decided to choose only light-colored costumes). Unfortunately, he couldn’t go out for running anymore; although, wonderful treadmills were at his disposal at the Tower’s gym. They helped to clear his mind equally well. And he wore the helmet during missions. Always. Out of missions, he stopped feeling shy beside the team very soon. Only if he could stop reacting with new flowers to Tony as well… Steve almost gave up on this though.
Tony looked at him with sudden seriousness and did something unexplainable: he put the flower in the cell carefully. The blue light momentarily turned a simple daisy into an impossibly beautiful masterpiece, into a wonderful creature made by God and a human together. Before Steve could say something, Tony closed the cell with lightning and screwed the glass deftly.
Pierce decided to stick to several rules. Firstly, he tried to avoid Schmidt at any cost. Of course, Pierce couldn’t avoid him completely, and it would be dangerous not to keep up to speed, but Pierce couldn’t take a risk to see the head of Hydra face to face. Secondly, Pierce reactivated safe houses in Argentina, Germany, and (he squinted internally) Mongolia and provided them with all things that were necessary to withstand a year-long siege. And thirdly, Stark. Perce was going to find a way to neutralize him, despite all the reasons of frozen Soldier, and he wasn’t going to let Stark out of his sight till that moment. It was easy because Rogers took Stark from the cell and now he was constantly standing behind Rogers’ shoulder when he wasn't hanging out in his laboratory.
His jeans soaked through with hot sperm. A telltale blush crept up his cheeks, his palms sweated, and a short satisfying relaxation gave place to cold fear. If someone noticed… If Tony… What would he think? Steve lowered his head and took several deep breaths, and then he suddenly realized that there was only Tony and him left in the room.
“I’ve deleted all of them. My personal computer is constantly offline, so I didn’t break my promise.”
Peter was listening to him for the whole ten minutes. All this time the President was soundlessly moving his lips, and anyone could guess what he was saying even without hearing his words. The world crisis arose, we all need to keep calm and support each other, panic is our enemy…
No one would risk and call Tony Stark a coward. Although, it’s one thing not to be afraid of enemies, but when a light purple tentacle of your teammate was delicately trying to give you a daisy, it’s hard to stay without batting an eyelid. And Tony just stared at Steve not moving a muscle. Then he very carefully touched one of the tentacles and, judging by his face, he didn’t feel disgusted.
Hulk roars and smashes walls with Iron Man—Tony Stark—and Tony just can’t concentrate and do something. His head refuses to think what he could do.
“I’m Steve Rogers,” Steve corrected without lifting his head. “I remember someone said that all my specialness is out of a bottle.”
Steve shook his head, grabbed the nearest pillow and tucked it under himself. He opened up in front of Tony, who took a bottle of lube from somewhere, and all became fuzzy. Another touch made him groan and bite his lip, as a shamefully deep but sweet caress made him spread his knees.
Steve went through all magical tricks stoically. So he nodded, accepting Tony’s promise, and just asked, “What about your… Friday? Did it… she disappear with the bottle?”
Sleeping Pepper is much nicer. And Tony needs to stop being the constant reason for her insomnia and premature gray. They're all right, it’s all his fault.
“Have you coughed recently?” Bruce interrupted Tony, so Steve didn’t have a chance to know what this hanahaki was. Well, he would google it later.
It was a complete disaster. Why had he never experienced such stunning effect neither from Erskin’s lectures nor from Howard’s presentations? Steve thought that he had outgrown it, gotten rid of silly and inappropriate reactions to Tony Stark excitedly speaking science. It happened for the first time in the helicarrier, when Tony was talking about astrophysics with Bruce, slightly but obviously showing off. The damn costume grew tight in the groin, and Steve thanked his lucky stars that he was sitting at the desk and not standing at attention. It hadn’t helped much then, and didn’t help much later, when Tony was sleepily muttering formulas and intricate theorems, falling asleep after a rough day, or when he was spouting off his ideas, sticking with Bruce in the lab, or when he was trying to explain some of them to the Avengers — which was the worst part.
“You… but why?” he asked perplexedly. “What’s your interest? You have only three wishes, and no more!”
Steve touched the cork again. The seal was round and depicted a triangle in a circle. For a moment Steve seemed to feel a barely perceptible hum under his fingers. Coulson stared at him, and his very presence suddenly annoyed Steve—despite Coulson being a reliable and nice guy.
“Strange!” someone shouted from below. Peter jumped, feeling familiar and at the same time unknown warm in the heart. It was Tony’s voice, and shortly after that, he heard a second voice. “Just so you know, the shield can easily break those magical barriers of yours!”
“Yeah, but why?” Steve repeated patiently. “Why didn’t he use his three wishes when he had a genie?”
They sit. Then they lie and hug, and Rogers says, “Sleep, Tony. Tomorrow we need to report to Fury at ten.”
“Don’t say anything, please,” he asked, pressing his forehead to the tentacle which bounced a little. “Let me… Let me dream for a moment. Then it all will go to hell, but for now…”
Possibly, he thought, at one moment it became equally frightening to keep silent and to confess. Invisible scales come to a balanced standstill and only one’s determination defines where an arrow goes, which pan outweighs… So maybe if Steve tore apart the daisy's petals one by one, the last petal would predict something he dreamt about for so long, against all odds? Maybe a tiny daisy miracle would happen amid steel and steam mechanisms, robots and zeppelins, amid a new strange world which almost forgot how to walk and started to run and fly?
“You have a stupid habit. The stupidest habit of all your habits, Stark,” Tony hears in amazement. He hasn’t planned to hear anything else—and feel his full body, holy God—in this life anymore.
“Well,” Peter mumbled, “I don’t ask you to kick puppies or betray your followers. I just want to show you that this is the key to everything. You need… you must do it—for me, for humanity, for future generations, and I… I am panicked, that’s why I’m saying some nonsensical things. I don’t want to die virgin, for fuck sake!”
For history and justice: it’s someone else's idea and doesn’t belong to Tony. Moreover, it doesn’t belong to Clint, he overheard it from the SHIELD young agents. And brought it to the Tower, like a mongrel that brings fleas to its masters. And Captain Enthusiasm heard it and became infected.
“Why do you think I’m going to divorce?” he asked. “I didn’t lie about anything. Although, if I seemed disgusting to you and you did all that just to save the world…”
“I appreciate it,” Steve nodded automatically. “But wait… if I don’t wish for anything, you can just live freely and not be imprisoned!”
He had to sweat badly for the test because Tony wanted to check the hygroscopic improvement. After that he hardly put on his jeans and came to his room, dreaming about the shower (and what he would do there under the refreshing water: how he would imagine that it is someone else’s hands gliding from the abdomen to the groin, it is someone else’s fingers pulling apart his ass cheeks, that it is someone else’s tongue touching the lips from the inside). When he stepped out of the bathroom, content but still irritated, he saw Tony’s message on the screen of his Starkphone: “Half past six, Wong Foo. Your crush is an idiot.” Wong Foo was a usual fast food just a few steps from the Tower, but the meal was tasteful, plates were big enough that even Steve didn’t order second helping, and neither staff nor guests paid attention to Avengers eating pho bo.
Pierce preferred plotting behind the scenes to a shoving match, so he stepped backward involuntary, and Rhodes went round him screwing up his face in revulsion. His grimace was so similar to Stark’s (nasty habits were easy to pick up) that Pierce’s cheekbones ached, mouth opened as by itself and the quiet “nigger” slipped out of it.
“Everybody will know right now why we are late. They will tell stupid jokes,” Tony grumbled, putting on his t-shirt. Hickeys on his neck stood out in a beautiful leopard pattern, and Steve’s artistic flair begged to leave another two to complete the composition.
Tony raised his eyebrows and muttered, “It was shrapnel, you know. I needed something to keep it in the distance, I tried magnetism, but electricity is much more reliable. But it doesn’t matter anyway, I’m not a human anymore, and you are a zealot of traditions, you need someone with a normal human heart, made of flesh and blood…”
“Marry me,” Rogers said straightforwardly as usual. “It will strengthen relations within the divided society, prove your loyalty to Hydra…”
“I’ve made it somehow without magic help before, right? Not to mention the very idea of receiving a human as a gift…”
“Hydra respects my wishes,” Rogers said dismissively and hoarsely as well, distracting Pierce from the infernal nature of Herr Schmidt. “And I wish to see you on my side… Tony.”
Tony smiled brightly and nodded. Even before the year ended, he willingly and freely fulfilled—oh!—so many of Steve’s wishes. Nobody counted them, and Steve didn’t know how many of Tony's wishes he fulfilled in return. Because it didn’t matter.
“You made it all just in time,” Strange said in an indisputable tone. “The reality was creaking at the seams, and I decided to cut the postering.”
“If it were in some quiet place.” He felt his cheeks heated and a new flower bloomed right on the hairline at the back of his head. He would have to hide it under the helmet or pull it up if he needed to leave the Tower in the next three days. “Where you can leave a baseball cap on.”
Tony’s eyes brightened for a moment so that Steve thought he’d never seen anyone or anything more beautiful. Although, those eyes darkened at once because Tony clearly reminded himself of common sense and the whole situation so to push sudden hope somewhere deep.
This time it’s Clint’s choice. It means exactly two things: first, a movie is about archers; and so, second, it’s tasteless. Hence, in the beginning, Tony will laugh his head off (and Clint will mope), but then the imaginary nonsense on the screen will tire him and he will fall asleep in the middle. Who would think that someone makes movies about archers? Tony needs to talk Pep into lobbying for a law that forbids such movies under penalty of death.
“I didn’t expect that from you, Pierce,” he said very calmly. “To call the war prisoner awful things… The prisoner who has a huge experience in air combat and squadron commanding, who is ready to come to our side…”
Somewhere at that point Steve switched off. All his blood moved south anyway. After all, he had lost hope and motivation, too. He found solace only in helping others who needed his sheer strength.  He cleared away the debris, extinguished fires, pulled apart wrecked cars, searched for lonely elders and children in empty houses. They all slept for two or three hours a day. Every night Steve fell into a black, unconscious swamp and every morning he swam to the surface, gasping for breath. A sharp-toothed longing watched him from a bedroom corner, waiting for the right moment to bite him in the neck, but he somehow managed to keep its rotten teeth away. And when Tony came back, literally fallen from the sky, Steve woke up. It seemed that his body had awakened too and demanded he tend to its needs resolutely and irrevocably.
“Bitch,” Pierce whispered, hanging on by his eyebrows. If Rogers let Stark tinker in the prosthesis, it would be the death of conspirators. On the other hand, it would be useful for Barnes to know that Pierce didn’t lie when he warned about future problems. “Cap, come on, punch him, he deserves it!”
Steve pressed his hand to Tony’s mouth and stared into his surprised eyes as Tony still tried to talk.
“So there is nothing dangerous here. Your lungs are clear. Your heart is perfectly healthy. If flowers bother you, you can add herbicide to your shampoo. I’ll synthesize a skin-safe formula, I need no more than a couple of days for it. Tony,” Tony paced around the lab, “calm down.”
"I'm not ready to speak about my divorce, Meghan. And to be honest, I don't think I would want to marry ever again. I'm going to move to Malibu for some time. They say that a change of scene distracts you from bitter thoughts."
There weren’t doubts that casualties would follow. Maybe even mass casualties. Captain Hydra was obsessed with Tony Stark, ever genius, billionaire (i.e. ex-billionaire), playboy (fuck knows whether he could act like this among rebels) and philanthropist. Stark definitely didn’t stop to act like the latter, because from time to time he tossed his little “presents” to Hydra. Once it was a self-destructing jammer, and thanks to it rebels could complete a mission and transferred a vibranium under the very nose of the East compound. Once it was an email with a computer virus. Holy God, how could you create such an idiot, who ordered goods through their workstations with a direct connection to the control center? Of course, such an idiot didn’t exist anymore, but this was irrelevant.
“Steve,” Winter Soldier answered as fast as he shot. “We have known each other much longer. And so you know, Pierce, I’m watching you. I’m sick of your resets, and about your codes… well, if Stark is so smart, maybe he will help me with them.”
Stark was glad. Bastard. Boy Jenkins had shown promises, he even had led a couple of punitive expeditions!
“Well?” he asked aggressively. “Are we going to divorce right now and there or wait for a couple of days? Just in case he returns?”
Thin steam fountains were hissing all around the den; little mechanic rats were whisking everywhere—their only goal was to pick up sweeps and rainbow curls of metal chips; a steam hammer was banging steadily somewhere in the depth, lightened with gold and red. Tony was bending over the shield and screwing something enthusiastically; he wore a long apron and goggles. He didn’t notice Steve, so Steve took his time to admire Tony. Disheveled feathers of hair, turning bluish-grey because of metallic powder; sharp nose; fixed eyes behind the thick protective glasses—the most beautiful eyes in the world, Steve knew that he hadn’t seen and wouldn’t see anything alike; strong shoulders; tan arms, carrying signs of fire and acid burns; long fingers…
“In eight,” Tony agreed casually, “I’ll have made this thing for the boy. Believe me, I can recognize my work. This means that he isn’t lying about anything else.”
Romanoff rounded the corner of the nearest crashed building and glided forward like a dark shadow; Clint caught her and said something, shaking his head. Peter would thank him if he could distract for a minute—he didn’t want to talk about Budapest. Besides, it wasn’t much to talk about, Mr. Stark just asked him never to mention Budapest near Widow if he wanted to live.
Steve shifted his gaze to Tony as if waiting for explanations, and Tony rubbed his dusty temple. It looked like he went grey from dust, weariness cut wrinkles on his face, but it didn’t matter. Peter knew best that age had no influence on such a great man.
“I’m not joking,” Peter repeated, taking an opportunity in dead silence. “You need to marry right now. Or the world would die—no, it wouldn't happen soon, but it’d be inevitable. I understand how it sounds, but this is true, and by the way, I googled the nearest church, it’s less than two blocks from here.”
“Because you must be an idiot to try and get between those two.” Winter Soldier said. “Steve needs this smart son of a bitch, and even I won’t risk getting into their business.”
He downed his hands, still staring at the table. Now Tony should say that Steve had frozen off his brain after seventy years in ice. At best.
“Uh,” Steve said most intelligently. He still held the shield in front of him because he simply forgot about it. “Hello?”
“Hi,” Peter said to her. He felt an awful awkwardness. “It’s all right, really. Avengers protect you, they have Widow, they have Hulk, and this isn’t the end of the world, it’s just the army of Chitauri, and… oh.”
“There is nothing extraordinary here. Of course, I need to divide everything by twelve,” Bruce adjusted his glasses and waved away one of the holographic spreadsheets. Tony opened his mouth and breathed in deeply to… Steve didn’t know why. Tony always had what to say, and Steve never could guess what he was going to say. It seemed Bruce had a better understanding, because he explained right away, “By relative supersoldier twelve! He has the hormone level of a man on a peak of romantic love, considering Captain’s correction. No viruses or signs of bacterial infection.”
They watch a movie about a man in green tights, by the way. Natasha laughs for once in a while. Bruce is exasperated at latex and nylon because they didn’t exist in the thirteen century, for sure. Thor drops his hammer.
“Do you want to be complimented too, don’t you? Do you remember I mentioned personality? Your genius, your imagination, your will to push the limits every possible moment — all of it guarantee that Hydra won’t become a musty swamp. You know, I’m able to learn from past mistakes. Entropy is growing in isolated systems, and you are…”
Tony flirted. It was a fact, a public norm, an axiom, whatever you called it—he was able to be likable, he could find an approach to anyone, he attracted and made advances. When Tony got down to business, nobody could resist him in any meaningful way. But now he seemed to switch off his superpower and asked simply—like Steve himself could ask.
“Photos of your husband Steve Rogers in compromising positions made headlines last week. He was pictured during what appeared to be a date with an unknown blonde woman. There was cake, champagne, and kissing. Was it unexpected for you?"
“Fuck Hydra,” Stark said, stepped forward and closed his hands on the back of frowned Rogers’ head. “I need only you.”
"And I'll repeat it as many times as you need. You know we had to do it. And it worked. Ten Rings dutifully came to your Malibu house..."
Even for the two of them, it’s hard work to get the girl out of her shelter. She fought back, cried something about celestial monsters and the end of the world; finally, Clint squinted and slapped her on the cheek. The shout stopped as if it was cut by a knife, and the girl opened her eyes for the first time.
“I’ll open it… later,” he said, putting away the gift. “Maybe it’s dangerous to deal with things like this on your own, but it can’t be worse than drinking alcohol chugalug with Natasha. I’ll cope with it. Also, Howard wouldn’t leave me some deadly jack-in-the-box. Jack-in-the-bottle.”
And because of that Steve wanted to shout, turn cartwheels, explode with burning sparkles like a firecracker on the Fourth of July. But he managed just to groan.
“Wait a minute! Does the reputation of a ladies' man count?” Tony asked, breaking out this relative silence.
“You said it back then too,” Stark said nonchalantly. “And I’m still telling you that Rogers is a good person. He just caught up in an unlucky coincidence. I think he is really happy that Schmidt isn’t here anymore, and freedom… now freedom is closer to us than at any other moment in the past. You’ll wait and see that in five or ten years we’ll make out of Hydra a normal society.”
“Take it easy, I’m okay.” Steve tore his hand from the bowl and put it on Tony’s knee. It was a big mistake because he felt at once how a whole bunch of flowers bloomed on the top of the head.
“...where is he?” The sound was so clear as if Mr. Stark stood a few feet from here. “What do you mean by ‘disappear’, Natasha, nothing can disappear from you…”
“The memory of Herr Schmidt is enshrined in our hearts,” The leading article assured. “The loyal Hydra soldier will inherit the helm…”
“Honestly, Steve,” Tony grabbed chopsticks wrapped in a napkin and began to fiddle with them, “that love interest of yours doesn’t know where happiness awaits despite his genius.”
Tony shook his head and did the most strange, the most unpredictable thing on Earth—he reached for a tentacle, took it with hot fingers, and brought it to his lips. It seemed he even imitated a curtsy in an old-fashioned manner, how it’d looked before the steamvolution. Steve saw them only in pictures where ladies were wearing crinolines and bustles, where gentlemen were flaunting silk hats a couple of feet high, and where protective glasses were used as a lorgnette. It seemed it meant something in that old language of high society, but as ill-luck would have it—Steve was a son of poor immigrants and didn’t have a clue about such details.
He definitely should go through another reset. Former sergeant Barnes started to look and behave almost like a normal human, and Pierce didn’t like it at all.
“Because I think that now I understand why he sought for you so desperately,” Tony sighed and lifted his arms shackled in heavy bracelets. “Steve, just consider thoroughly what you want to wish for. Every word could become a mistake. This seal is merciless to ambiguities, so I doubt that you’d have a chance to say “ouch, that’s not what I meant”.”
Steve turned to him and flashed a smile. "Tomorrow we are going to a Korean restaurant to eat impossibly spicy food with unpronounceable names. And today... Tony, are you okay?"
“The compound looks like a public thoroughfare,” he wrote in an email which was sent to Pierce’s top-secret mailbox. “Recruits training was passed to a woman named Romanoff, a former KGB agent. Recruits cry at night and beg to return them to their Mummies. Also, she is a friend of Stark and I don’t know why she hasn’t choked him yet… A certain Doctor Banner joined genetic experiments, and Zola became quiet so as not to anger him. Stark emptied all coffee reserves at the compound and suggested installing coffee machines and vending donut machines in all the corridors. Rogers let him do it, and now everybody is constantly chewing because donuts are tasty.”
“Of course!” Steve burst out suddenly. “Everything is just entertainment for you! Family, vows, conjugal ties—everything!”
“Are we discussing it seriously? What the hell, we are really discussing it,” Steve acknowledged. “But…”
At six-thirty, he was at the place. He wore a tight white t-shirt that—he knew for sure—Tony liked very much and jeans which Natasha had helped him to find. It had been a struggle to shove all the flowers under the Dodgers cap, but he had managed to do it. Tony was fifteen minutes late.
“Okay, let it be so. Receive a sentient being! So, this idea wouldn’t be welcomed by any normal American after 1865!”
Then he understood that to have flowers in the head he should not only let someone come closer to him but meet them halfway—and he stopped thinking about it. No one needed him. And he needed no one (apart from Bucky). So flowers were out of the question.
“I could build a spaceship to fly with you to the very edge of our Universe,” Stark suggested. His eyes were shining like stars.
Damn Stark was standing behind his back in a magnet cuffs and watching the execution with such a face that worldly-wise Pierce picked out immediately.
Tony waved him with a bowl of popcorn and patted the sofa near him as if Steve was a dog. If Steve had a tail though, he would definitely wiggle it. He saw pictures on the Internet where he and other Avengers were drawn with cat or dog tails and ears and it didn’t surprise him anymore. He could do nothing but to be glad that he wasn't supposed to have a tail or else he would give himself away at once. Although, he gave himself away anyway.
“That I have no idea what lokum is, but I accept your invitation, of course,” Steve smiled. “Wait, was I really able to turn you into a human with one indiscreet wish?”
“If I say that I really want coffee and you hear it, you’ll consider it my wish, am I right?” Steve asked, smiling slightly. The genie (was he a genie in the first place?) was resourceful, cunning, and charming… like Howard.
“It doesn’t matter in New York since 2011,” Tony answered instead of Peter, who wanted to say that since 2015 it wouldn't matter for the whole country, from Massachusetts to Nebraska. “But I don’t care about it, because—me? Marry this boring guy in tights? You must be kidding me. Well, he has a nice figure, of course, but…”
“We’ll look for Peter Parker from Queens,” Steve suggested. “He’ll look at us like two idiots, because he doesn't know us yet, but… don’t mess me about, Tony Stark. In my day an honest man would marry once in a lifetime.”
“Oh,” Tony said. “More than anything I was afraid that you’d blurt out something like “and live a usual mortal life.” But I’m still a genie and I’m able to do so much… don’t frown, Steve, I won’t destroy palaces and flood deserts. I’ll content myself with technical miracles, Howard has taught me to love them.”
“So answer him,” he advised, “that social prosperity and democratic liberty should be the first thing and only after that you could think of marriage. Hey, what’s the look on your face?”
“Sometimes,” Strange said in his imposing manner, “people need just one little push to do the only right thing. The rightest thing in their life. It could be unobvious, it could look trivial or crazy, but the heart knows best. I think that’s their case.”
“I don’t know. Dr. Erskin said no, but I haven’t checked for myself. You know, primarily Hydra was designing the serum.” Steve said apologetically. “So it was tested too little before the first volunteers were injected with it. Maybe Zola planned this metamorphosis from the very beginning, who knows?”
“For me,” Barnes suggested flatly, still standing quietly at the side. Rhodes looked at him with wild angry eyes, nodded readily, and lifted his fist up.
“Well, I have to start somewhere. Actually, I count on your… hm… firmness in some matters. And you still haven’t answered me. Nazism was based on the idea of race supremacy, communism was based on the idea of ideology supremacy and class equality. What is the base of your new world order?”
Tony nodded silently. His throat bobbed as if words stuck there and couldn’t get out. Steve drew his finger to the cheekbone, to the chin, then his hand slipped to the back of Tony’s head. The tentacles readily and hungrily hugged Tony’s waist and hips, at the same moment squeezing his strong forearms. Steve realized what amazement that Tony didn’t draw back, no, he moved closer, giving in to the hug. That’s it. It meant that those harsh rumors weren’t for nothing, that…
“We…” Steve considered the answer. Then he cast an uncertain look at Tony and nodded resolutely. “We’re alright if you’re alright. What have you studied there?”
“Even the slightest deviation from favorable biological terms can stop vegetation development. At worst, it can cause plant’s death.”
“Oh,” Commander of the best Hydra airwing (James Rhodes) commented when the head of the Science department and the unspoken favorite of Captain Hydra (Anthony Edward Stark) shared the news with him, “we could expect that. Barnes missed too. Mind my words, he will find Pierce wherever he goes, even in Mongolia, and bring him here. Like a post package.”
After short thinking Pierce decided that Brock was right. An experiment, the Cube, and Stark combined together definitely should result in some catastrophe.
He moved his eyebrow one more time, and the screen showed smoking debris and upside-down cars. Peter quit asking and froze.
Tony stared at him surprisingly and muttered, “The most wonderful thing about you, Steve, is that you don’t lie, that you really think so. I don’t know why in heaven’s name, but… no. I am not a machine, or at least, I am not a machine in all my parts, but it is not helping. Look.”
“Only Clint, maybe. Others won’t risk it or will pretend that they are considerate enough not to pay attention,” Steve chuckled. He has already come to his senses, and now he was appreciating the world anew, getting to learn it from scratch. “Except that they will pay attention.”
Tony Stark was as lonely as they all were, and no money could prevent or fix it. Stark’s atomic submarine had found frozen Steve six months ago, and since that memorable day, Steve had never seen Tony dating, let alone sleeping with anybody. It seemed he didn’t sleep at all, because he spent all his time on other things: upgrading Avengers arming, poring in the lab with Bruce and Peter, managing his company somehow in between…
“Then why?” Tony squinted even more. “I’m sorry, this question just stuck, you can pass it if you want.”
After that Pierce lost consciousness and woke up three days later in a white sterile medical unit. He was all bandaged up and his head was heavy as hell. He moved and groaned, the attached device beeped anxiously, the door opened, and Rogers and Schmidt walked through it. They wore medical scrubs over their uniforms, and at first Pierce assumed that it was only his hallucination. Unfortunately, Rogers immediately chased away that nice thought.
“Nobody,” Pierce felt how Captain shrugged at that moment. “Nobody could give this right to you, you can just take it yourself if you have enough strength. And I have enough of it.”
“Well, really! I have been talking for half an hour, trying to explain why there is no catch in this case, at all,” Tony rolled his eyes but started to explain once again. He spoke like a patient teacher explaining a lesson to kids in elementary school. “We can use a gap in the time-space continuum… you remember that time and space are the same thing, don’t you?.. to blink to the past for a short time and create a loop. A loop is bad, it causes time-travel paradoxes, for example, we can meet ourselves. As for me, I would think of what to say to myself, and I guess that you too, but such meetings are fraught with troublesome consequences to the extent that our reality might be destroyed, so we won’t do it. Instead, we will stay away from ourselves and use a wonderful device that I found on that damn ship and upgraded a little. It’s not the Eye of Agamotto, but it’s similar to it, and it definitely works, or else I wouldn’t be here. Am I making myself more clear now?”
“I don’t approve meaningless deaths.” Rogers retorted. “And the answer to your question is that, in my opinion, humankind got lost and has been going the wrong way for a long time. It has been wandering somewhere, wasting time and resources on some rubbish, and making mistakes. Now I’m in charge and I will change all of it.”
Steve breathed out and relaxed visibly. The tentacles rocked around Tony happily and freely, stroking his cheeks and hair, caressing his shoulders.
“Captain Primrose! How is your running?” Obviously, Tony didn’t go to bed at all. The shadows under his eyes seemed especially dark this morning. Wrinkles around his mouth became deeper and, on the whole, he looked not so good. He seemed older, tired, and wretched. Steve felt an upswing of aching tenderness and the flowers started to grow like crazy. New sprouts appeared, shot up, formed buds, and opened petals. In a matter of seconds.
That very evening Pierce’s receiver croaked and squeaked. Then it broadcasted the sound of steps, the rasp of a grate, and Stark’s arrogant voice.
Winter Soldier came after 40 seconds, estimated the situation, and stood in the corner to watch meditatively how Rhodes was making mincemeat of Pierce. Some patrolman stepped closer, but saw a wicked movement of the bionic arm and returned to his previous position.
There was a short pause, and then Steve smiled widely and admitted, “It was always about you. Remember, Thor once said that there was nothing that could not be explained, apart from you? He was right after all.”
“You are a flatterer,” Tony smiled despite his words. “There are some other unexplainable things, and we definitely should talk about them.”
Tony wanted to say something, but the door opened and Captain Hydra entered the room. It seemed that he took up all the space.
“Loving,” Tony commented sarcastically. He became silent at once because Steve hugged his waist and pressed him closer. Then he whispered in Tony’s ear something unrecognizable, but it gave amazing results: not only Tony lost his tongue, but also blushed as though he was a young bride.
“I could die on the spot from your impossible humbleness.” Stark reacted immediately. Pierce ground his teeth, swearing at both of them: Stark be damned for he was hundred-percents-Stark, and Captain be damned for he was visibly ready to let Stark go on further and further. Even now he didn’t snap, didn’t punch…
“And I remember that someone was under the influence of Loki’s scepter, and also that someone didn’t have proper time to get used to your return in this world. But that’s not what I want to talk about! Who is she? If you can’t bring yourself to do it, I can put in a word for you! I’ll tell her how good you are, huh! Just in case she has poor eyesight and her moral compass is hacked by Al-Qaeda. I already have a couple of presenta…” Tony became silent suddenly.
Tony drifts asleep. He hasn’t looked his fill, he just can’t keep his eyes open anymore. He climbs into a tent, and there is Captain Pitch Perfect. It’s hot for him, so he stretches upon the sleeping bag, taking the whole floor with his huge body. Tony freezes despite his uncontrolled yawn. Like an idiot. He has to bend double and twist in some impossible pose (later he’ll create a perfect tent; it’ll be the most spacious, comfortable, and luxurious tent in the world) to fit in a small space and avoid all heroic limps. Huh. Tony makes an effort and realizes that Natasha had reasons to giggle when she assigned tents for each pair. He wants to wake Rogers right away and tell him about this revelation but takes pity. He sleeps, so be it. And Tony needs to sleep too—pale light already appears along the sky's edge. Soon, others will get up, stomp, make noises; chances are good that they’ll water him.
"To our house," Steve agreed and kissed him on the forehead. "Happy served up wonderful bait, we caught them all, so now S.H.I.E.L.D. will find Mandarin and you'll stop getting those stupid threatening letters."
“Yeah, Stark was a good guy, that’s for sure. As for S.H.I.E.L.D., for example, he didn’t only find it—he also left his whole fortune to it as he didn’t have an heir… But if I were you, Captain, I’d still be careful around this thing.”
“Don’t you understand that we are on the verge of riot and rebellion? That if Schmidt knows about it — and he will know about it for certain…”
“Peter,” Captain said it like Peter was a small child, “do you understand how it looks like? You come like a bolt from the blue, explain nothing, ask something strange… We are both men, how about it?”
Steve pursed his lips. Another flower arose and grew up rapidly above the left ear. Tony stared at him and Steve couldn’t find the courage to look back.
No. How he could live. Live. Steve never saw a machine in him, Tony was always a guy who saved Steve from ice; a guy who forgot about himself for others' sake; a guy who was ready at any moment to rush in water, or fire, or malfunctioning zeppelin engine, or even hell itself—and then, after he barely survived, he was ready to mock endlessly so no one could accuse him of soft-heartedness, heaven forbid.
Tony stopped mid-word and stared at the wet spot on his jeans. Smothering shame choked Steve for a moment and then vanished because the thirst in Tony’s eyes was extremely obvious. Tony licked his lips and said hoarsely, “You know, I have an idea. Before tomorrow’s meeting I should explain the theory of quantum jumps to you one-on-one. I’d better do it in the bedroom. In private. Right now.”
It seemed that Strange managed to switch channels with his eyebrow. There were tigers in a snowy forest, a football match, dozens of talk shows, and some absurd program about aliens who disguised themselves as normal people. Peter breathed out slowly; the ice in his chest was melting bit by bit.
He pulled them all up—it wasn’t any more painful than pulling out a hair one by one. Only after that, he came out of his room. If he was lucky…
“Well, maybe, but I’m still glad it turned out so well,” Tony smiled, showing his white teeth. “And I can throw parties! I can travel! I can fix and create marvelous devices! I can buy costumes, spit from roofs of towers, maybe even fly! And I can kiss. I desperately want to kiss, can you believe it?”
“Build for you a tower higher than Babylon one?” The genie snapped his fingers, and a marvelously detailed design of some strange construction appeared in front of Steve. It shone and turned in the air, and Tony watched it proudly. “It’ll be full of mysterious wonders. Invisible servants will help you, you’ll never feel bored and sad, joy will settle in your heart, the love of beautiful women will last forever, and you’ll have fun from dawns till nights and from nights till dawns. Or,” Tony’s voice became mellow and thick, “you long for glorious wars and victories over all your enemies? Just say it, and I’ll grant you the delight of battles. If you need it, I’ll even turn into your ally and stay with you side by side…”
“Kill him, he is either a chitauri spy or time traveler,” the voice from the comm said, and Peter jumped. He heard a lot about Romanoff’s intuition, but he’d never had a chance to try it on, so now… ”Or Loki’s illusion. Or some other shit. Clint, I have no time for…”
“I haven’t done that… and I’ve just built the Tower,” Tony said confusingly. “Portraits… yes, I have portraits, but this is just my collection, so…”
But today of all days Tony doesn’t want to fall asleep, because Captain Team Spirit sits beside him, mumbles shyly something like, “it’s too little space here”, and presses in with his warm side. And it’s so wonderful to tease him that every opportunity is a real groove for Tony.
“...sleep, work, fight, draw. Though I don’t like swearing, and that’s the reason why you drew that shameless draft, isn’t it?” Pierce heard something in Rogers’ voice… smile? Shit, exactly. And hope too, and Pierce couldn’t wrap his head around it. “You consider my taste too, Tony. Only in the opposite way.”
“I won’t let you die or be harmed during the mission. I have protected you and I will protect you. I’ll survive no matter what.”
“No.” Tony put the smoothie on a table and reached Steve. His fingers were cold because of the glass, and Steve got goosebumps from their touch. He sighed. The fingers started getting warmer, but Tony kept stroking his forehead and staring… somewhat strange.
Rogers makes a confused pause, trying to do his thing with blushing. Tony remembers his strange notice and plays hunch, “Listen, Rogers, I don’t comprehend one thing. Why have you never flipped me off?”
“One more word, Stark, and my patience will disappear too,” Romanoff said. Peter saw Tony sighed in exasperation and turned to… yes, his spouse before the law.
“Promise me,” Steve whispered, “that we won’t forget… this? That we’ll stay together? Because I want it, Tony, I want it so much, you can’t even imagine. I’m not perfect, just like you, but we… deserve it, right? We deserve each other.”
Tony has just read one of those articles (God help him, these people don’t understand their subject even for a little bit) and felt furious. He starts to think whether he'll be able to invent a pluggable brain. Not for himself, of course, but some people need such devices.
Clint crossed the last obstacle from a fallen tree and a half-burned bus and got out into the relatively open space covered with scrap bricks. Construction dust hung in the air like a mist, and Peter hurriedly pulled a mask over his face. He saw Captain and Mr. Stark at once: Mr. Stark was sprawled in a crumpled car and talked with Captain through a window. Their faces were tense.
Moreover, Strange was an adult. If you don't consider that an argument, just imagine a kid who tries arguing with a teacher.
“Marry this genius and playboy?” Steve asked in the same tone. “Let alone his philanthropy and sarcasm. No way. Although, he has a nice costume.”
Tony Stark didn’t have a heart and he’d never had it. Everyone knew it, and yellow press journalists often wrote about it, connecting that obvious fact with stories about the broken hearts of poor girls. At first, Steve was honestly horrified because of those stories until he understood that they were worth even less than the cheap paper they were printed on. However, Tony loved to tell the same nonsense about himself, as if his goal was to surpass journalists who blackened his reputation. They wrote that Stark valued money more than anything, that his father gave newborn son’s soul to the devil to make Tony the most talented mechanic on Earth, that Stark now and ever preferred to be around his tech rather than people. Although, they wrote more than enough about the other Avengers too. They said that Natasha started her agent career by killing the Second Ripper who tried to murder her because of her profession at the moment (the oldest profession in the world). That Doctor Banner had dealings with demons and summoned them to his service. That Barton had a cursed bow that stole victims' souls and that’s why he never missed. That Spider-boy had real spider claws and spinnerets, and his cock peeled off after sex.
Pierce cursed him silently but then thought that it was for the best anyway. Firstly, they would definitely lose Winter Soldier after another half an hour of that talking, and even reset wouldn’t help in that case. Secondly, Pierce had one idea…
“What’s your name, son?” Steve asked tiredly, and Peter saw a wrinkle between his brows. His success hung by a thread, the future of the whole world depended on whether he could convince this serious guy, holy God, the very Captain America—to believe him.
Tony sighed and said slowly, “It should make a quantum channel for teleportation. If we manage to take over the Infinity Stones before Thanos does, we will make their quantum copies in our present. We will transmit quantum-entangled particles in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation, because if we put them in the Bell state…”
Steve had to give the flowers to him. They had too short stems so Tony tried to take them properly for a minute, occasionally caressing Steve’s fingers. Then he just held out his hand, and Steve could swear that he felt when petals touched hard calluses. He blushed but Tony pointedly looked away from him to place the gift into the glass, adjusting every stem so it would reach the water. To Steve’s big surprise, he gave a little shake to the worn-out flower and put it between the pages of a tattered notebook—which he hid immediately in a drawer. The next second he threw the new version of the costume to Steve and asked him to undress.
He wriggled out of Clint’s momentary weakened grab. Clint snapped back behind Peter, but it didn’t stop him.
Maybe the flower was guilty of everything that happened later. Pepper had put it in a vase, and Steve drew it out on his way to Tony and hid behind his back. Tony made Pepper out of golden threads, a powerful steam engine, delicate porcelain, rubies, sapphires, pins, and incredibly intricate mechanisms. There were horrible rumors about her too though she was just an angel, however mechanical.
Steve shook his head. He was short for words, but he had no doubt that Tony could talk for the both of them.
“Not from me.” Winter Soldier’s voice suddenly seemed like a combat knife aiming right in the eye. Pierce shivered. “And not from you, is it clear?”
Tony sighed and said in a perfunctory easy tone, “Howard couldn’t have children. But he wanted an heir so badly that he used his first wish to make his heir from me. I didn’t mind it; as he said, previous me was an outdated model. All those palaces and treasures of worldly empires… well, it doesn’t matter anymore. What do you want, mortal? Tell me your wish.”
