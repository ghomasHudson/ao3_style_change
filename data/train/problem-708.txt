Mike nodded and left John by himself, but as he opened the door he heard John say, “Cathy? Yeah, this is John, we need to talk.”
Sherlock blushed. "So Mike told you about that, huh?"
Mycroft threw his arms in the air, "Why does everyone insist on harping about prom? I don't want to go." He got into the car and peeled out of the parking lot.
"Yes, Sherlock, days."
John kissed her cheek. "You are a gem, Mrs Hudson."
And that wasn't even the worst of it, each new day Sherlock Darling would come in and find some new thing to belittle and sneer at.
He abruptly straightened and turned on his heel without so much as a backward glance, leaving behind a very flustered Sherlock.
Mary blushed and pushed a loose hair behind her ear.
Greg pulled it out John's hand, "Let me see that!" His eyes bulged as he looked at the black card. "Christ! Just how much is on this thing?"
John shook his head and instantly regretted it.
Mycroft wrote a series of numbers on a slip of paper and stood up. "Are you aware of how much is in there?"
"How did your meeting go?" John asked.
"Fine," Sherlock bit out, "but make sure it's the last."
And every piece of Christmas spirit brought a smile to John's face. And each time it grew bigger and more genuine. There was only one thing left to make it all perfect. He needed to get John the best present possible.
Sherlock smiled and kissed John back.
His eyes flew open and his mouth formed an oh. "Oh!" He had been blind. There was another option. A better option. He really should have thought of it before. It was the perfect solution to their money woes.
Sherlock scooted back further on the bed to give Mycroft room to sit and Mycroft immediately filled the space.
John laughed, "It was, yeah. What? You didn't do that kind of shit with your mates as a kid?"
Mycroft shook his head, "Get in the car."
"A million years wouldn't be long enough as long as you were by my side, Sherlock," he breathed.
Returning almost three hours later, he made a few trips to take all his bags and packages up to the flat, even with the help of the driver.
And John did, and as he lay in the dark chatting with Mike, he knew he had found a friend for life.
"Do what?"
Mycroft rolled his eyes. "What I mean is that were John not in the picture, Miss Ricoletti would have remained only a devoted fan of Sherlock's and president of his fan club."
"Christ, live modestly, my arse!" John cursed.
And then let the woman lead him to a car. She slid in on one side and John on the other. The lizard side of his brain was telling him to ask for her number, while his actual brain was practically screaming for him not to. He told the lizard brain to shut up and ended up making small talk instead.
"Ah, of course," Mycroft replied. "I'm glad one of us is creative. I simply don't have the head at all for making things appeal to a wide range of people."
"I could follow you around and carry things for you," Sherlock replied.
John and Sherlock looked at each other, not sure if he meant the drinks or if the chef meant to choose their meal for them. But before they could ask, Angelo had hurried back to the kitchen. Skipping.
He chuckled, unrepentant.
He came out shaking his curls with his fingers to get out the damp snow.
Mike grinned. "On it!" Then he pulled out his phone, dialing John to find out where he was.
"Oh," Sherlock said softly. "So you honestly don't know?"
Mike took him up on it but John declined. "Family issues," he explained, "but thanks for the food."
"Well, grab your things," Mike said. "Looks like you're stuck with us for the weekend. Me and Div will be happy to have you."
Seb took a swing at Sherlock, but his fist never got there. John stopped him by grabbing his wrist and twisting it. Seb struggled and security came running.
"Honestly? You aren't taking the mickey on me, are ya?" he asked, surprised.
John looked down at himself and then started to giggle. Sherlock's deep rumble joined in and soon they were both laughing.
"All that is Mycroft's," Sherlock replied with a huff.
"Red?" Sherlock asked.
"All right," Bertie said slowly. "I'm listening."
"I will burn the paper and get you something else."
"Any other good books in your brother's library?" John asked around a mouthful of food.
Mike shrugged. “So what are you going to do?” He held out his hand to John. The rugby player took it and let Mike help him stand.
"I didn't figure you wanted to explain to an entire room of strangers why your panic attack wasn't as out of the blue as you thought," Sherlock replied with a smile.
"Currently being pissed on so badly that everything has flooded and I'm stuck here," John groused. "Most likely for three days, at
"You should come over to the dark side, we have pretty male dancers," Victor teased.
"Oh no," Mike protested. "There is no way."
"Sherlock can date‒" she began, but was cut off by Sherlock's cheerful giggling and Mycroft's outraged objections. "I'm not finished!"
She looked at them in expectation, but when they gave her blank looks, she rolled her eyes. "Have you seen him?" She had completely forgotten that she hadn't told anyone she was coming to prom.
As they were walking out of the closet, John threw his arms in the air.
"You could always ask-" Sherlock stopped. "Oh!"
"Huh," John said looking out the window, "sounds like the storm is moving on."
"Promise?"
"Yeah," John agreed quickly. "I just didn't want to say, you know in case..."
Mycroft stood outside Sherlock's door a moment trying to muster up the courage to finally do this. On the other side of the door he could hear the sounds of the telly going full blast. He should just come back later and turned away. He got only three steps away when he sighed. He had put this off long enough. He turned around and knocked on the door.
Once he and Mike got everyone served, they grabbed their own mugs and plates and went to sit down. Mike sat down in the open spot to Divya's left. John looked for Mary, but she was flanked by Molly and David. David smirked. But Molly went to stand up.
Mr Holmes threw his head back and laughed. "Yeah, and I
"Just make him happy."
John opened the door to reveal the older blond. He had retired from the army with distinction and was working at 221Books as way to fill his time. He was broad-shouldered and striking in a way only those in the military could muster.
And just like that, the psychopath was gone and a charmer stood in his place. "Well aren't you just as pretty as a picture," Brook cooed, "The telly just doesn't do you any justice."
"Let's go home," John suggested.
They stepped inside and faced four boys who were outcasts of the outcasts, the bottom of the barrel.
Sherlock shook his head, "Some day you'll use up all your chances."
"Oi!" Greg bellowed. Sherlock turned his head to the editor, but John kept looking at Sherlock's lips a moment longer before he turned, too.
"I don't suppose there would be any junk food like that in this house, would there?"
John looked up from his phone, the frown deepening. "This one is, I assure you."
John smiled softly. "It's all right, Sherlock."
"Yes, the man of the hour," she purred. "Have you thought about branching out to other genres?"
It was too damn hot to live, let alone move. The unfortunate thing was that the criminal classes thought the same thing and there hadn't been a decent case in weeks. Which left Sherlock cranky and irritable. Worse, it left him bored. And that meant hell for literally everyone else.
John looked around. "Did–did Prof. Weston tell you about me?"
"Don't panic. You've got this. Good luck- SH"
He couldn't let Sherlock see how much this last month's estrangement had affected him. After all, it was his fault for chasing Mary when all he had to do was wait for Sherlock. The evening and their lives would be better than they were now.
John took the books from James and looked them over. Both books were by American fantasy writer, Brandon Sanderson.
Sherlock looked away shyly. "Do you think he'll say yes?"
"As in, am I or someone I know insane?" John snapped. "No, but I am far more qualified to speak on the subject than anyone else here."
"Sherlock?" Mrs Hudson asked, but was bustled aside as Sherlock made his way inside her flat.
It wasn't until David pointedly reminded them that they could continue their conversation in
Mike thumped the back of John's head.
might
And that wasn't last time that they had similar conversations, all of them ending in Sherlock walking off frustrated.
Greg followed Mycroft through the crowds and wondered if this was such a good idea after all.
"All right," John said, opening the door to the library, "I think we're set, for tonight anyway."
Sherlock leaned up against the door jam and said with a smirk, "I see you decided to go for something other than eau du rugby today."
"I simply know a good story when I see one," Mycroft countered.
John just waved him off, "I'll grab the things I'm borrowing and bring them in here."
To take his mind off the feeling, John asked with a wink, "So, what can you tell me about this place that wouldn't be cheating?"
Mrs Stamford looked at her son quizzically.
"Forgive me," Sherlock pleaded.
John laughed. He pointed to the coffee machine that was filled to the brim with Mycroft's best dark roast.
Sherlock nodded, breathless.
"Mummy is having a hard time comprehending Mycroft going to the prom and by extension myself, and I would really like to be out of here before she changes her mind," Sherlock explained, stopping only when he reached John's car.
Sherlock shook his head. "No, it's fine, it's soothing."
"I'm not supposed to, it could cause them to close," Sherlock replied, throwing his head back in pleasure.
Sherlock looked around, "Prom?"
Watson. I believe I let my prejudices against sport get the better of me."
She laughed out loud, causing everyone to focus on them. "Oh, John. You are so sweet."
John raised an eyebrow. "Sherlock's had a boyfriend?"
John laughed. "You would pick out that one detail out of all of that. But yes, you berk. I thought you were gorgeous. Still do."
"Yes," Sherlock agreed. "That is why Mycroft and I decided to send me to deal with the problem directly. I'll be heading out to Cork to kick their arses."
And they worked side by side, preparing the finishing touches for their meals in tandem.
Dale laughed. "You'll excuse us, gentlemen, I'm stealing my boyfriend back," he said, his eyes never leaving Victor.
Sherlock nodded, he leaned back from John to press against the back of the sofa. He lifted his hand off John's back and then ran a hand over his own chest. "I have ever since- ever since that day."
Sherlock refused to meet his eye. John gently took his friend's cheeks in his hands. "He did, didn't he?"
"I have accounts in several Savile Row establishments that pull directly from my trust fund. A trust fund that until three days ago, I didn't have access to."
"Oh?" Sherlock asked. "How did it go?"
"So what made you decide to swap the army for Mrs Hudson's indomitable bookshop?"
"We just need to offer him some incentive," Mike replied. "We'd pay him."
Sherlock shrugged. "It's not anything people haven't said before."
On the one hand it was a teeny bit stalker-y, but on the other, she would get her date to prom because she was damn sure that Jim would never do anything even remotely considered romantic and she would be safe in that quarter.
Bertie doubled over and Sherlock gently nudged him, causing him to fall to the ground. Mike and Sherlock helped John to his feet.
John almost doubled over with laughter. "About that..." and he launched into telling James about his and Sherlock's 'sleepover' in Sussex and how they got to be such great friends.
"What's point the of having a job at a posh place if you can't give your favorite rock star or sports player a little something on the side?" Julie grumbled.
"I'm not interested," John was continuing. "Nor will I ever be." The doctor leaned in close. "I'm a wounded vet with an adrenaline addiction. My best friend is a consulting detective, my wife was a former assassin. I have friends in the army, the Met. I even know the government himself. If you as so much as whisper anything ill about Sherlock again, I'll make sure you disappear." She squeaked and removed her hand.
"Of course you'd pick up on that. I was also going because I am a doctor. I spent years earning that right. But I recently came to the realization that even though I'm using my degree, I'm not using it the way I wanted. Out there on the battlefield." He waved vaguely out the window. "But what I have with you replaced that with chasing criminals. I'm okay closing one aspect of my life. After all, that's what change is about, and fighting it is just ridiculous."
After a couple minutes John handed the phone back to Sherlock.
"Not to bash the new place, Sherlock," he began, "but I've seen the other place a time or two dropping John off for the weekend, and this house doesn't even compare. What made you want to move here?"
Sherlock and Anderson shared a glance over John's head. The three men didn't have wives. Anderson's had divorced him two years ago and both Sherlock and John were single.
Anthea just shook her head.
Sherlock practically skipped off to his waiting car. It was a good day. There were three new fakes out of business and in the case of one of them, serious jail time. He had won
About the scene with John and the troll, I originally had it before Greg met with John as his editor. But as I was typing it up, it didn't work there. Not even as it was written. So I did a bit of juggling, and I think it works better here.
"When–" John asked, but was cut off by the sound of Sherlock's phone ringing.
"Mummy!" Sherlock protested.
So, of course he asked.
John looked down at his crepes and sighed. He was almost done, so he finished them up as quickly as he could. When he was finished, he pushed the plate away and clasped his hands in front on him on the table.
Greg paused for a moment and then sighed again, "I'm out at the bleachers having a smoke for the first time in weeks."
All right, John agreed silently, that was childish. "Maybe a bit childish, then." Sherlock wrenched his face away from John's hands, but the good doctor merely cupped his fingers around his friend's chin and pulled him back to look at him. "But I have been gone. Far, far too often lately and I didn't think about what that might do to you, and I'm sorry."
John slicked up his lover first and then himself. He slowly levered himself forward until he pierced the outer ring. Sherlock cried out and John stopped to let his lover get used to the feeling. Once Sherlock gave the go ahead, John slid all the way in and they both moaned.
Mycroft just rolled his eyes and waved off her concern, "Tell them I had a seizure or something. "
He walked by a pretty brunette and then turned back. "Anthea?" he croaked.
Greg shook his head, "I won. I hit you more times than you hit me."
"Happy Christmas, Sherlock," he replied, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist, burying his head into the broad chest of his partner.
Google French is always awful, but here's what I was trying to say
Mycroft sighed. Sherlock had a point. "All right, when do you leave?"
Sherlock blushed and bumped John back. But you can't kill a thought once it has made a home in your head.
He resisted the urge to see if Mrs Holmes was still staring at him, because if she was, he would have completely lost his nerve.
Bertie reached up and stroked Sherlock's cheek, "Don't you worry your pretty head about that. I've got it all under control."
But it wasn't all bad, John finally got an answer to a question that had been plaguing him since he started working at 221Books.
"You think I'm perfect?" Mycroft asked in confusion.
John slumped next to Mike at lunch and hit his head on the table. "It's hopeless."
"You're being an idiot and you know it. You either suck it up and watch it, knowing that it bores you to tears but you love him enough to come see him anyway, or you walk away."
Sherlock scoffed. "But barely. At that point my parents had become aware of the habit, and they wrote a new clause into the trust fund. I would have to show up in person to my brother and formally request access to the trust."
With grudging acceptance they agreed to the standing reservation despite wanting to be treated like other patrons, then bade her goodbye before walking out to John's waiting car, hand in hand.
Mycroft was lying on his bed listening to his music and reading, when he heard quite clearly, "'Oops'?"
"Oh shite!" the man groaned. "Sherlock must be shattered."
"Did you really blow up the science lab in fifth year?" Greg asked after a moment of thinking.
John licked his lips. "I don't suppose you've
"Oh, dear! I hope you haven't changed your mind, I've already sent them the check for the first semester."
Mycroft chuckled. "On his way, certainly."
"Oh hey, John," Mike replied. "What's up?"
"That's right. Just you. If I get another call from you about this, Miss Donovan, you'll be looking for work elsewhere. Do I make myself clear?"
John twirled to make the frilly pink apron flare out like a tutu. "I needed something fast and this was all my sister-in-law had on hand." He ran his hands over the frills and lifted up his chin defiantly. "Besides, I think I look pretty."
"I'm sure she would," John agreed. "Not that this hasn't been fun and all, but it's going to be nice to have time to myself."
"No."
The days slipped by, and summer moved into autumn and then winter. It was two weeks before Christmas when that black car pulled up beside John as he was coming back from a night out with his rugby mates.
Sherlock looked at the book and then back at John and said skeptically, "You liked it? No one
Sherlock took another sip. "What am I doing here, Victor? Seriously, what?"
Greg blushed.
John closed his eyes. Yes it had. It had happened before: not even two months into John's marriage to Mary, Sherlock had gone back to the drugs. Despite the younger man's protests to contrary.
He knocked on the door but there was no answer. He turned the handle and it opened the door. Will frowned. It wasn't like Uncle Sherlock to leave it unlocked.
Anthea sighed. Time to switch to best friend mode, she had a Mycroft to talk down. She pulled her phone out of one of the pockets that she put in the dress when she had it made.
"It's not all whips and chains," Irene said. "We also do mlm and wlw, smut or not."
Um... I sobbed uncontrollably when I wrote the graveyard scene the first time. I sometimes have characters do unexpected things and Sherlock certainly surprised me with his reaction to Mike's reveal. He was far more heartbroken then I could have imagined, but Mike needed his wings.
"This has got to be the worst sleepover ever," Mike said dryly.
Jim stood up and leaned into Sherlock's space. "I am the head of this company and you
Sherlock hears the steps as John heads up to his own room, and it’s a strange sensation; having been prepared to offer something he didn't really want to give, only to have his offer refused before he even got started, and still end up feeling like he lost something.
John says this like he’s saying that they’re eating lunch -
, but he doesn’t want to purge his life of John, and what Mycroft’s implying, what John might pick up from the obvious hints from his brother-- it would--)
“Of course it would be the eating disorder you found to be the most objectionable part of the deduction,” Sherlock says, sounding as if he's speaking to himself rather than the two people in the backseat, but John knows better.
Or indeed comprehensible.
Theorising without at all the data.

, distanced), a wide bed and far too many mirrors on the walls.
Uni is better, but it's inconsequential, because Sherlock isn't better, and he is unlikely to ever be.
It’s a decision made almost intuitively, and the words comes out of his mind almost before Sherlock is aware of having made the decision.
“So, that thing that Mr Michaels said, right as we were about to leave…”
Sherlock is, and has long been, an observer.
John interrupts him by holding up his hand, and suddenly, Sherlock becomes aware, for the first time in minutes, of the vivid colour scheme that radiates from him.
“Oh, doubtless, but you also find a pleasure in doing the opposite of what your brother wants.”
Decision height reached.
Playing this card against John is not desirable, not even after John’s own little ‘deduction’ this morning. Still, compared to having John start questioning other possible causes for the tension between them, it doesn’t seem like that high a price to pay.
“Yes! What now?”
Mycroft’s voice echoes, and Sherlock swats it away before John returns.
During his first - brief - admission, he’s in no state to participate in any kind of psychiatric evaluation. On his second admission Sherlock efficiently manages to circumvent any attempt at diagnosing his ‘underlying condition’ in order to address the issue of ‘possible self-medication’ by rattling off all the criteria he doesn’t meet for each and every diagnosis that he’s being evaluated for. He proceeds to refuse participation in any of the diagnostic interviews with reference to the significant variations in reliability that such assessments have shown in different studies. No further attempts at diagnostics are initiated.
“You know what Sherlock? I might not like being left out of the game, but neither do you. You, on the other hand, you like to be outplayed. You actually enjoy being defeated, as long as it’s done with an unexpected move. Perhaps you hate losing, but as said; you need a challenge; need to
“I hope you enjoyed your little trip,” John snaps, taking in all of Sherlock before his eyes widen, then narrow. “Are you high?”
“You do know why this is happening right now, don’t you, brother dear?”
He thumbs her name, and the image on the screen changes, revealing first his own initial text -
The difference between the estimated and the actual time is so unaccountable that a retrial is called for.
“That’s… Something I do not wish to discuss.”
Two single tablets.
Mycroft’s voice is a crude imitation of John’s as he says the word “amazing”, but it doesn’t hurt, because it’s not new information, it’s not a new consideration. It’s just an unusually low blow, coming from his brother.
It’s almost 2 am, the party that had been thrown together by the medical students at one of the smaller clubs down by Cherwell is reaching its peak at the exact same time as John is reaching his limit.
(It’s not disappointment, because surely disappointment requires there to have initially been some kind of hope?)
Sherlock wants to say something, to argue with his brother, rip apart Mycroft’s logic the way Mycroft ripped away the ground beneath Sherlock, but he has no words, and for once, he has no argument. It’s too shameful to voice, the fact that he missed this; a pattern that was clear in front of him. And if Sherlock has learnt one thing from the whole ordeal with the silver birds, that is never to speak up about the divergence of his mind or to admit to anything.
The lubricant makes his finger feel foreign as it returns to his genitals - his

As John leaves, Sherlock is already deeply focused on the new lead that he’s following, and being able to focus once again, to be absorbed into the data and the puzzle the way he’d taken for granted up until a few weeks ago is such a relief that Sherlock doesn’t mind the sound of the door closing behind John, or the sound of his steps as he descends down the stairs.
Finally, the failure to initiate and respond to social interactions. Sherlock does not initiate much at all here. He responds somewhat (more than I thought he would when I began writing this scene) to social interaction here, but part of that might be due to the fact that he decided for an approach/persona for this conversation in the last chapter, and is still attempting to hold on to that, since he has a goal; making John be less ashamed of what they’re doing sexually, so that they can continue doing it. One could argue that this whole conversation is in part about him not wanting/being able to respond to certain social interactions, especially during sex, something that John picks up on. I’m not saying that that’s the reason that Sherlock desires to be the submissive partner during sex, but I would agree with John’s reflection here; it helps him. He does not want to initiate, and he does not want to respond in this. Partially, it’s due to him actually having that sexual preference, but I think (in my headcanon of this story) that perhaps that part of it is due his brain wants to get a break from the constant effort that he has to put into social interactions and reading of social cues. He would likely find it to be somewhat hard to focus if he felt the need to constantly assess John, John’s reactions, John’s pleasure and so on during sex. It would likely be far more overwhelming - mentally - to him than the anticipation and the unpredictableness of what they’re doing here.

This is something Sherlock had been unable to deduce about John, something that's now making his pelvis feel like--)
After a few final deep breaths, Sherlock's on his feet, and whatever reactions are lingering beneath the haze of endorphins and overstimulated nerve endings, it will take a while before he will have to fully experience their impact.
Just like many others with executive dysfunction, Sherlock self-medicates. Coffee, sugar, nicotine, adrenaline… all these are things that will keep the brain awake for a short duration of time. So are cocaine and amphetamines, and a common hypothesis is that this is one of the main reasons behind the very high comorbidity between ADHD and substance abuse, and also why ADHD medications which contains very low doses of amphetamine or substances which work in a similar way as amphetamine works.
John doesn’t have a plan, had just begun something that he has no idea where he’s going with, and Sherlock is naked and male and without the prelude of kissing or making out that all becomes… very hard to ignore.
(He wants not to be at all, wants to stop this madness once and for all, because it won't ever get any better -
John isn't gay, isn't bi, isn't anything but plainly straight with a -consciously or subconsciously - repressed hint of curiosity, and so it hardly matters. Sherlock's own reactions might prove problematic, but that's assuming John will even want to proceed in this, and that's not something Sherlock will count on yet.
An interesting case is usually the best thing that Sherlock could hope for, but tonight it is more than that - it’s what he needs and it’s something that might possibly restore the fragile balance that has been tipped to the side due to the distortions in 221B during the past few days.
Sherlock leans down to rest his chin on his knee for a few seconds, bracing himself to continue. Stroking his hands absently down his shins before sitting up straight again, he can’t help wishing for the comfort of his old, threadbare pyjama bottoms.
John's breath is much slower, much steadier, than his own, and the obvious difference in their respiratory rates feels exposing, at least in the relative silence of their flat. There's nothing to distract him from the sound of his own heaving breath, and John's hand is still in his hair, effectively keeping Sherlock from turning to face him.
Sherlock refuses to acknowledge his brother’s question; it won’t make a difference anyway.
Another answer; yes. John finds himself actually wanting this.
“It doesn't matter. It doesn’t matter when I can’t
There’s no trace of sentiment in his voice as he puts these facts, these things he’s never before voiced, into words and the ice in his voice forces the words to linger in the space between them, too solid to be dissolved by the air.
John's voice, followed by a stream of pale colors as John appears in the doorway by the kitchen, his shoulder stiff and his face cold. The bags under his eyes are more prominent, and the way his mouth tics at the corner tells Sherlock that he’s in pain, but not taking anything for it.
which feels like a direct insult, as Sherlock’s always been careful to be nothing but specific.
He could jump straight to the issue; ask John what he thinks that means, but he won't, because there are words he'd prefer not to have any of them voice. He could bite back, pinning this on John needing to feel special and telling him it's only about efficiency, which in part, it is. He could also--
Sherlock wants to snarl. Sniping back or sulking would be appropriate responses to John’s sarcasm. Sherlock doesn’t, however, do either of these things. It seems like too much effort.
The sight is dizzying. Sherlock’s pale arms bracing his body against the impact of John’s thrusts. His curls are a mess as Sherlock’s head drops between his outstretched arms and then lifts a bit as John thrusts back into him.
It's the question, the one for all the marbles. The one that might make or break this.
Sherlock had, Mycroft always had
-bile-
‘Being in love’ is not something that he ought to feel; it’d led to… things, things that are no longer deleted. Things that are rather unpleasant to think about. And last time he had to think about those things - over a decade ago - he used chemical solutions to take the edge of those thoughts. That chemical solution led to other things that are equally unpleasant to think about, but right now that feels rather secondary to the relief that the solution could offer. The consequences would be a later problem, anyway. But he had told John about the box, and John had removed it. It wasn’t like he couldn’t get more cocaine, but the act of removing the box was symbolic; it had been a ‘just in case’ solution, a ‘worst case scenario’ solution, and now he’s eliminated that escape route.
Disbelief, anger, a hint of something akin to sadness and then… determination.
challenged.”
white cotton
And John is still suspicious, but he laughs in the same way he does when he shouldn’t be laughing at a crime scene, and Sherlock feels another kind of dizziness, and the pressure decreases a bit for a few seconds. John is deep, saturated royal blue with emerald green fused in, and when Sherlock’s distress returns, the thought from the broom closet returns too.
His skin is still sore in multiple locations after his… session, and while Sherlock had purposely avoided all kinds of direct sexual stimulation of his own body and had refrained from masturbation, he can still feel a low, simmering arousal every time he moves in a way that causes the ache to intensify.
The interruption couldn’t have come at a more inconvenient time.
“A lot of people do. It's nice, sometimes.”
Judging by the way John's eyes widen in surprise out there on the crime scene, Sherlock gathers that this might be a slight overstep of some social convention or another, but seeing how there's a murder to solve - and a tricky one at that - Sherlock pushes all such thoughts aside, just hoping that the young officer stalking behind John doesn't make any faulty assumptions about the situation, something that never fails to make John deeply uncomfortable and in need of defending his heterosexuality.
The next day saw Sherlock in the reading room pouring over books on how to take care of the hives that were still on the property, and John pacing in the bedroom, muttering to himself and clutching an envelope to his chest.
"They're all waiting for us," Mrs Holmes said. Molly started for the door. "Don't forget your bouquet, dear," she reminded the girl.
of the boardroom, that is.
"Thanks, Mycroft," Sherlock replied. "And say hi to that boyfriend of yours and tell him to send me another case, these classes are rotting my brain."
"Well, yeah, but-"
John licked his lip and gulped hard.
"I've never seen or heard of anyone who could do what he just did," John murmured.
"Molly Hooper gave up the medium gig and is now going to school to become a grief counselor. She said that the show was the best thing that had ever happened to her. She went on to say that she had been been living in the past and it was time to move toward a better future. Next up, Richard Brook."
John's head rocked back and he snarled, "I do not!"
He deposited Sherlock on their sofa and then made his way to the kitchen. "Mycroft's minions have been by, I see," he chuckled when he saw that it had been scrubbed clean. He opened a cupboard and it was filled with food; a check to their fridge confirmed that it, too, had been restocked.
"Oi!" Greg hollered. "I'm here for the game." He then launched into an explanation of the sport that everyone but Sherlock tuned out. He leaned forward, soaking up everything he could on the sport that John loved.
"What's James like?" Sherlock asked, aiming for nonchalant.
He knew the outfit had done its job when John licked his bottom lip slowly and then dragged his teeth over it, plumping it.
Minutes ago, John had been gripping Sherlock’s hips far too hard, almost breathless from the sensation of moving inside Sherlock’s body for the first time. He had heard uneven breaths turn into groans and had felt Sherlock’s shivering muscles as he came, his body clenching around John in a way that had made John’s own movements even rougher and more frantic until he finally came, spilling into Sherlock. Now, John is listening to the sounds of floorboards creaking and cupboards being opened whilst looking out over his own naked body and the soiled and rumpled sheets of Sherlock’s bed, illuminated only by the depressing, foggy evening light from the window.

The light outside the door to 221 Baker Street is relentless.
And love is - if one accepts the vague concept of ‘love’ - a chemical problem.
Without plausible deniability, this would run the risk of becoming far too real.
“Never?”
Almost instantly, Sherlock feels like he’s closed all the air out of the room.
Exhale.
One night a few months back, before any of this -  whatever
“It doesn’t.”
Love, in a romantic context, might be translated to
Joseph knows why Mr Leonard disappeared, but there is probably no way that Sherlock will get the boy to crack and tell him why. That in itself is an answer - there’s a sense of loyalty that could only derive from the knowledge that you owe someone more than you could ever repay. Joseph, in his poor attempts to seem laid-back, is not a secure or even overly mature teenager, but the way he speaks carefully and gives all the right answers speaks of another side of him, a side that knows more about the rougher realities of life than it does about fitting in or how to know where you belong.
Tegan laughed. "You could say that. You must be Anthea, William told us all about you."
"John!" Sherlock screamed as John's hands reached the edge of his pants.
"You're not my worst enemy," John said softly. "That honor goes to the rat bastard, who in one fell swoop of a bullet, ended my military and medical career. You don't even make my top five."
Mycroft shook his head, "I wasn't even there that day, I don't know how that one started to be honest. I blame Sherlock, honestly."
Once John was back on his feet, he turned to Sherlock, "Wait, how could you see her?"
"Yes, ma'am," John replied.
He sought Mycroft first, figuring that if Mycroft was as drunk as he appeared then Sherlock could drive home. He wasn't seventeen yet, but he had his provisional license and could use the practice.
John was on his way home from work when Greg called to tell him that Sherlock was in the hospital. He had collapsed while chasing a criminal. So, okay, it wasn't
"Fuck you!" Mycroft snarled in return.
Sherlock shook his head. "There are very few people I can tolerate listening to without picking out the flaws, and they are all professionals."
Don't worry, I will be explaining John and Greg's backstories later in our tale.
The blond sighed heavy and deep. It was reminiscent of his sigh when he first heard of Sherlock's hospitalization, only more resigned. But he squared his shoulders and lifted his chin.
"I know him," Sherlock noted. "He's the teacher's assistant in my chemistry class."
The part where there’s distance between them and John is unbuttoning his shirt while Sherlock stands there, almost unmoving, willing himself not to close his eyes. The critical part; visual input without the distraction offered by physical stimulation.
When John returns from lunch with a coworker later that day, Sherlock’s in the middle of trying to fix Mrs Hudson’s cordless. In front of him on the kitchen table, pieces of the phone as well as various tools are laid out in what might seem to be a random mess, but which very much isn’t. There’s an order and a reason for everything Sherlock does, it’s just that not everyone is clever enough to figure that out.

“Nope. So, do you?”
There's a loud bang; John's fist must have hit the side table. The beige, khaki and bright, pale green become almost nauseating even though Sherlock has his back to John.
In short: there has to be something wrong with him, because if there isn't - if this is how he’s supposed to feel, if this is as good as it will get - then he might as well end it all once and for all.
“It is what’s going to happen, but that’s irrelevant to what you’re implying,” Sherlock lied, voice now sharpened by surprise. He hadn’t thought John would be level-headed enough after the exchange of words last night to even attempt to find a reason behind the words except for the undeniable fact that Sherlock was just as inhuman as John himself had so accurately stated at the time.
(See the end of the chapter for

“No.”
He’s an intruder, and that’s not something he’s about to get overly sentimental about. It is what it is, and at least this way he’s an intruder in a more physical sense.
After sending a few emails to people who have no idea who Sherlock is, but who he has been researching methodically during the past week, Sherlock allows himself to sort through all the new clues about John, especially the new piece of information about Nate.
Eyes still on his, John nods slowly.
- and slips into the cab, eyes compulsively flicking back towards the pattern from the silver bird. As Sherlock enters the cab, John -
Their eyes meet again, and Sherlock knows it the moment he sees John’s pupils. The deflation is beginning to give way for something more intent.
It’s the fourth day of withdrawal and Sherlock’s stomach seems to have readjusted itself slightly to the reduced inhibition on the serotonin reuptake. The increased reuptake causes the amount of free serotonin in his synapses to decrease, which in turn leads to his cells binding and activating less serotonin molecules. In other words; his brain is once again in a state of below average serotonin levels. His stomach might have begun to acclimatize, but his brain will take significantly longer to readjust. The constant feeling of unease and discomfort - ‘
“Sherlock!”
“But I told you it didn't bother me.”
“You think I lead you on, and that bothers you?”
It’s almost noon, and John’s still asleep upstairs. Sherlock, meanwhile, is in the sitting room, trying to regain a modicum of control over his own breathing.
“Where would be the fun in that?”
“You don’t ever get to do that.”
He resists it, forcing his eyes to remain open, but what he sees and hears all feels distant. And then, just as he’s about to slip away, there is suddenly a steady pressure, one fixed point that grounds him momentarily. It’s moving over his cheekbone, and he hears a voice, but he can’t quite make out the words.
Three men, connected through a criminal organisation that mostly focuses on medium-scale smuggling. A few inquiries among his own contacts leaves Sherlock with an address where they’ve been known to meet.
And a snippet from (http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Opponent%20Process%20Theory):
“You used to… do that,” John begins, nodding his head, most likely trying to indicate Sherlock's scar-covered thighs where they are currently pressed against John's own. “I won't have any part in it.”
As an afterthought, careful not to attempt to minimise the devastating implications, he adds: “It's often said to be difficult to classify when it occurs in an eleven-year-old. For me, it was more like an… apophenia.”
“I don’t always put up with it. But when I do, I guess it’s because he’s usually not that brutal about it, usually he just slips because he’s too absorbed with solving mysteries or doing something else ‘not boring’ in that great brain of his to even notice that people might not like the truth too much.”
Between his legs, a patch of copper brown curls, well-groomed; order, control. His flaccid penis is eggshell white in contrast to the copper, and Sherlock tries to look at his body as if it were any other body.
“You're pride yourself on being open-minded, but the idea of anyone making the faulty assumption that you're gay is still very distressing to you. Now that you know that you're not only living with a man, but a homosexual one at that, you might subconsciously be somewhat unsettled by some of the previous aspects of our… friendship. All I've done is cut back on those.”
"I... don't know. I could check, if you like. You sure that your... poisoning is better?"
They reach the staff room thirty seconds before the bell clears the hallways, and they are shown to a small classroom where they can wait for their witness, Joseph, who will be another ten minutes. A teacher brings them each a cup of coffee before he leaves them. Sherlock sinks down onto one of the two chairs as soon as the door closes behind the young man, his senses filled with sounds and a childhood that should be forgotten by now.
John takes a step back, tugging his hair even harder, making Sherlock almost twist in his grip before releasing him. For half a second, Sherlock sways a bit, unsteady when losing the grip on his hair after having had his head inclined for so long.
That is something they always do; the not-talking-about-it.
(It’s a useful distraction, that.)
In an attempt to distract himself, Sherlock decides to gather up the data needed in order to compose a blog post on the toxic effects of common household chemicals.
Sherlock's not sure if John is taking the piss. He would hardly be the first to do it. But John licks his lips -
-  as do his colours, as he continues.
Whatever it will do to John, this is the only way.
A mundane little puzzle, really. A few observations that had formed a pattern. It happens to him all the time, and it's one of the things in his mind that's both a curse and a blessing. Usually, he doesn't voice his observations, not anymore, because school did teach him one thing: people did not take to them kindly.
(A firm landing is generally the safest.)
Sherlock's watched John leave before, watched him from this exact spot, and the next time he saw him after that, his mind had gotten things mixed up, for a moment mistaking John for the Moriarty he was yet to meet.
“I told you, you are an idiot to do this because you fear…”
“We shouldn't spend the night in here,” Sherlock hears himself saying, but Nadine shakes her head, so Sherlock makes his way to the crowded living room by himself.
. The possibility of more John
I said in Floodgates that I would return to this topic, and now it's time. Please, read with caution if this may trigger you. Self-harm part I was about the more general “why” of self-harm and didn't actually involve the POV of any person who had self-harmed. This chapter is the follow up on that, and without spoiling too much, we will get parts of Sherlock's “why” in this, as well as glimpses of “how”. The descriptions of self-harm are all in the past time, and I doubt this story will lead us to a situation that will make me write about this in present time more than I already have (if you count Sherlock's pinching/head banging, which I don't, since it's not tissue damage and since the motivation behind those actions are very different from those that made him self-harm in other ways).
once again filling him with a sense of control, of being where he’s supposed to be. John’s limp had once again vanished and he was smiling as he rolled his eyes at Lestrade when he thought Sherlock was being a git.
With his coat and scarf still on, the hot flashes caused by the retching are made worse and it feels like whatever fluid he’s not currently throwing up is instead being sweated out through his skin. The fact that he’s only been pretending to eat doesn’t help either; there’s really just bile to throw up, and the acid makes his throat twinge with every retch. John will see that there’s only bile, and he’ll know that Sherlock’s not been eating.
(Not a
On top of him, John shifts a bit and lets go of one of Sherlock’s wrists. When his fingers make contact with Sherlock’s jaw, stroking it in what’s probably meant to be a tender gesture, things go white inside Sherlock’s brain.
- a baby yells as a van backfires.
“It doesn’t. It’s imprecise, and its reliability when it comes to actual diagnoses is hardly up to the standard of most other medical fields. That does not mean that I don’t find the patterns observed or the descriptions offered to be useful.”
- followed by her reply.
(He never did, did he?)
[ ] IDK = I don't know
There are things - irrelevant things - he left out (‘
John shakes those images away, attempting to focus on understanding what Sherlock is trying - and failing - to say.
As it turns out, not being afraid of dying is something of an advantage when it comes to crime solving as a career path. Instead of walking on railings to balance his constant ambivalence over ending it all, Sherlock chases suspects and risks his life investigating crimes. At times, he’ll put himself into harm’s way simply because he can’t stand the idea of keeping on living, but most of the time he does it simply because he’s curious and will stop at nothing to solve the puzzle in front of him.
When John falls asleep a few minutes later - Sherlock can tell that his breathing has shifted to an even, slow rhythm from the way his chest moves - the room feels a bit empty, as if a waken John would take up more room than a sleeping one, which is illogical, even if you consider such things as shifts in the air and soundwaves.
Trapped. Held.
In Sherlock’s mind, things are almost quiet as he feels his heartbeat pulse throughout his entire body. He’s narrowly escaped death, and somehow that feeling never seems to build tolerance.
John's voice is half amusement, half frustration. His colours, on the other hand, are both intense and deep. The blend is so familiar, yet has been so rare lately, and something about those colours being back makes Sherlock feel more like he’s solved a hundred-year-old mystery than like he’s broken into a rehab facility in order to talk to a possible witness in a rather opaque case.
A tingle spreads outwards from his palms and the soles of his feet, and the patterns in his mind are suddenly genial and otherworldly instead of limiting and damaging, because Sherlock has seen it - a pattern where no one else did. It’s what he does, and he’s built a name doing so; observing when others just see.
(He knows now that it was never quite that simple.)
For those unfamiliar with the four horses; it's from the Book of Revelations, where Saint John is shown what will happen at Judgement Day.
Sherlock doesn't see the colours that radiate from other people, because they are not something that can be seen. He senses them the way other people sense moods and meanings behind words. Since perceiving things that way doesn't require any light, logic dictates that he ought to be able to perceive the nuances of someone even with without using his vision, but this is where his brain fails to obey logic. The colours always fade mere seconds after he’s closed his eyes, and he’s left with nothing but an afterimage.
Tyrian purple. Dark red. Deep blue. Tangerine orange.
“In fact, you keeping your mouth shut would not be a bad thing at all. All I need you to be able to say is one single word, and I doubt you'll feel the need to use it tonight.”
Sherlock is not sure if he's meant to answer that, not sure that he could even if he wanted to. He remains still, phone in hand and John's breath against his neck.
Sherlock, on the other hand, had chosen logic and structure, making it something larger than things that were perishable or senseless. Like life itself.
until I can’t make out your features anymore
He’s ended up here.
"What I'm saying," John says with that forced almost-smile that indicates that John's near boiling-point with built-up frustration, but is schooled not to let it show on his face, "is that nothing is ever about me. Not for you. And I could handle that before. Could handle how you used my skills when you needed them to make a point and then left me behind as soon as I was at risk of slowing you down, and how you led me on and then brushed me off just to lead me on again, using the fact that I exposed myself
Behind him, John’s picking up the mail on the sideboard - bills and a medical journal. Boring. Even John must think so. And John doesn’t handle boredom very well - that’s why the two of them get on like forest fire and drought.
“I'm not going all the way to your poncy hairdresser to get you your absurdly expensive hair potion. Anything else?”
“So, perhaps she got new friends who made her change her opinions on things? Or she might have just grown tired of everything that she'd grown up with and wanted to try something new?”
While the factors he’s previously taken into account - how the pain is inflicted, its intensity and whether or not it’s self-administered - are certainly valid, he’s failed to reckon the effect of such a raw, human factor as the intent behind the infliction of pain.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirms, uncertain of what to say next to keep filling the silence, to form their words into steady stream that will someway ease their way towards--
John, Sherlock realises
For tonight.
Interesting, if perhaps a bit… limited.
“It’s not like you didn’t know what that dosage and combination would lead to,” she concludes, her foot still wiggling. Sherlock wants to reach out and grab it until she keeps it still.
Sherlock is wet, tired and wishes very much that someone would provoke him right now, because he needs-- but around him, the police are getting into cars and talking to bystanders and there's nothing left for him to do here now that the puzzle is solved and the offender is arrested.
Sherlock regrets his words before he can even fully register what he’s saying and the further implications of the words.
“You really like that, don’t you?” John asks as Sherlock writhes and shivers as John’s fingers rub his nipples.
(The colors from the fire are so close to the colors that John radiates that for a minute, Sherlock almost believes that his wires have been uncrossed, and it’s a beautiful thought.)
The words suddenly rise up in Sherlock’s throat, and it unsettles him, because that's not something he's ever imagined wanting to say.
“If you simply wish to make me uncomfortable I am certain there are more enjoyable ways to go about it.”
- hardly romantic, more intellectual. Acceptable?)
“Get undressed. Now.”
- perhaps best known under its trade name Xanax, is “a potent, short-acting anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine class—a minor tranquilizer” (Wikipedia). It’s far more potent and also more addictive than Oxazepam, which Sherlock was given by Mycroft. Withdrawal symptoms are likely to occur are regular usage.
(It's more than effective as distractions go.)
Talking to someone requires the ability to  make out their words over the constant noise in your own head. Sherlock cannot meet this requirement at present.
A moment’s hesitation, but Mycroft’s expression is not nearly as pitying as it would have been if he’d known what problem Sherlock was truly turning over in his mind as he interrupted, and suddenly it’s vital not to let on.
With a grimace, Sherlock realises that he's reading an article about the occurrence of same-sex attraction in straight men, and that he has fourteen additional tabs with articles about the science of human sexuality open.
"A bottle of our best white wine, it will pair very nicely with your orders," Angelo said. "And I thought it would be charming if my nephew Mickey played for you while you ate."
Mycroft grabbed another one and was about to down it when Greg showed up.
"Okay," John took a deep breath, "I've tried being nice about this, I've tried ignoring it, I've tried explaining. So now I'm telling you. I assumed that because I was going to be going on tour soon that you would give up this idea that we were a couple, but clearly not. But this is beyond the pale. I. AM. NOT. INTERESTED. IN. YOU."
He could feel the man's eyes on him, and he had a feeling that he had been found wanting. He had a couple of COs that could make him feel like that; this man didn't scream military, though.
"I love you," Sherlock whispered like a confession.
John laughed. "He's my editor."
“I don’t know what the big deal is, it’s not as though I do this sort of thing often,” Sherlock defended, his arms crossed in front of his chest.
"And I'm driving," Mycroft said firmly.
Sherlock took the note back and opened it up to that extraordinary word one more time.
"You ran out of ammo first," Mycroft said smugly.
"Hey, Amy," he greeted. He and Sherlock had been to this hospital so often that almost all the nurses and doctors knew him.
"Really?" Molly asked.
Sherlock let out a harsh laugh. "He would have lost even if he wasn't as interesting as plain toast. I wouldn't spread my legs for him even if he paid me."
I told you I had the next chapter done. I thought about waiting a couple of days to post it, but...nah!
There were other things that seemed to change, in Sherlock's opinion, for the better. John would no longer run away when their arguments got heated, like he did before the Fall. It had hurt Sherlock when he had done that, and to see that John was trying to make concessions gave the taller man less desire to start arguments out of boredom.
As they got into the car Mycroft asked, "Why aren't you being more..." he waved his hand trying to find the right word.
"Well, considering we're both gay, you don't want me anywhere near them anyway," Sherlock pointed out.
Greg shrugged. "It's not like it matters anyway."
"My parents spared no expense. There is a large generator, a walk-in pantry, a tankless water heater, a state of the art kitchen, hell this damn fireplace cost at least £7000. You want to know when the last time they came up here was?"
Brutus was lying on the ground like that's what he had meant to do all along, and there were two men standing next to the dog. One was holding the scarf Brutus stole, he was standing ramrod straight, one arm tucked behind his back. The other was dusting himself off, wearing a suit that probably cost more than she made in a month.
John tapped his foot impatiently, refusing to do the toddler potty dance, but the need was starting to get a bit dire. Mycroft was the next to emerge from the bedrooms. He glared at John and the closed door to the bathroom.
"Indeed. After that Mr Trevor's health declined and the past came back to bite him in the arse. Victor believed that if I had left it alone, his father would still be alive today. He ran off to India, last I heard. But he never spoke to me again."
"Either he is or he isn't. For starters, Bertie isn't half the man you are. Secondly, don't ever let anyone make you feel you like you don't deserve something you want." Greg gave John a small shake, "Go for it."
They broke off the kiss and turned to her.
"I'm a cop. Detective Inspector, in fact. Homicide division. Found this little beauty," he raised the baton, "in the inside of the pocket of my coat. I've gotten so used to its weight, I forget it's there most of the time." Greg shrugged. "Came in handy today, though."
Greg rolled his eyes. "It was a joke. I was playing with the server and waved a bratwurst around."
When he got out, she was gone. But every time he went to take a shower, there she was, ever watchful. It was strange, though. It was only when he showered, never when he went to relieve himself.
John smiled at him, fondly. "I love you, too, Sherlock."
Sherlock laughed.
John's jaw dropped. "Bloody hell. It's a good thing we didn't play poker."
Sherlock flopped on the floor and pulled the blanket over his head in time for a lightning strike. The resulting boom was much quieter.
John, who was taking a drink of his beer, spewed it everywhere.
Like him coming home early, apparently. It wasn't so early that he and Greg never made it out for drinks, but far too early to have been the night out that they planned.
They strolled up to him at lunch and sat down at his table. Greg looked up at them in shock. No one sat at his table, ever.
You even make me rhyme.
She looked over, but recognition never lit her features.
Sherlock cocked his head to the side, "I live here. What are–" he stopped. "Wait, don't tell me, my brother has agreed to look at your book."
Sherlock shook his head and ducked his head to hide his blush. "John asked me out."
Greg thought about ignoring the other boy, but if school had taught him anything, it was that ignoring people like Bertie Gruner only made them more persistent.
The detective spread his hands on his lover's hips and panted into John's stomach, trying to catch his breath. Even though they had done this several times, for Sherlock each time felt as heady as the first.
Bertie looked Sherlock up and down. "Indeed."
"That's not fair!" Moriarty complained.
Sherlock was so shocked by the reaction that he took a step back.
John pursed his lips. "You know, I really think that is none of your business." He cocked his head to the side and the left corner of his mouth ticked up just a little.
Greg tapped the boutonniere box against the palm of his hand nervously. He didn't know if Mycroft was even going to show. When he saw John and Sherlock show up, he had started to hope, but a small part of him kept whispering that they had sneaked out and Mycroft wasn't coming.
He closed the doors and again struggled to his feet. He really should have asked Sherlock exactly where they were. He was about to give up when he spotted a green trunk by the door. He went over and opened it.
"I quit," Greg said, pulling up his sleeve and showing off his nicotine patch. "Apparently, they're bad for you."
John went to the fridge and opened it, "I swear, Mike if that's another short joke, I'll–" John stopped short. The fridge was packed with food. "Jesus Christ! There's enough food in here to feed my entire old unit for a week, maybe more!"
Greg had turned on the radio to drown out the oppressive silence in the car when the band Vauxhall Cross came on.
"Christ, yeah," John said. "So when are you leaving?"
Divya screamed yes and covered her new fiancé with kisses.
John chose that moment to knock.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock looked down at his toes and Mike tried to pull his arm, but Sherlock shrugged him off.
"Let me be the judge of that," John said. They ordered their food and Sherlock talked about what he did.
She waved her hand flippantly. "Only stating facts, darling." She pulled out a contract out of her briefcase and handed it to him. "Let's get down to business."
Greg slugged him. "Don't say that kind of shit around me. I've got a reputation to maintain."
one of color on your reading list!"
"No, thank you."
"Sherlock?" Mike asked. "Shit, it was Shercroft Publishing you were meeting with, wasn't it?"
for the privilege of printing
And so without further ado, "In which I introduce Irene Adler WAY earlier in the plot than originally planned!"
Apparently, Clara was a closeted lesbian who came out for the younger Watson sibling.
John frowned and then winced again. He smoothed out his face the best he could, but it was still pinched in pain. "Didn't– didn't Murray do that?"
"I have no idea what he meant," Victor whined.
Sherlock bounded up the stairs quickly and quietly, deftly avoiding the stairs that creaked. He opened the door and found, that as expected, John had crashed on the sofa. He dashed up to John's room and got the doctor's thick duvet and pillow. He brought them downstairs and made John as comfortable as possible.
"Good night, John," Sherlock replied, sleep stealing him away as well.
"Like you don't know
He squeezed Sherlock's arm and trailed his hand down, his fingers brushing Sherlock's palm before he let go.
The fire was burning low and they were starting to feel drowsy enough for bed. The wind howled through the chimney and then there was a pounding at the back door.
She added to his list and then sent him off to the shops.
Sherlock nodded, so John dutifully followed his editor back into the throngs of people.
John looked at Mary and suddenly it all clicked. She had this look of glee on her face. Like she'd won. He had be taken in again. Mary didn't love him. She didn't love David or this poor bloke either. She just wanted to make men fight for her. She liked overt displays of masculinity.
John stood up and Mary was forced to leap to her feet or be dumped on the floor. "I'm going to apologize. I know you won't."
John sat down on the chair hard. He had fixed his own limp, hadn't he? Well, maybe not entirely on his own. Sherlock over the course of that week had finally given him something outward to focus on. Even his writing was inward, a reflection of his injury. But Sherlock Holmes had changed all that.
"Now, don't go changing the subject‒" she turned to Sherlock, who was biting on his lower lip. "Wait, who took you home?"
Bertie cornered Greg in the boys' bathroom.
He ignored John's question. "According to his doctor, he fainted. Apparently, it has been over a week since he last consumed anything besides the occasional biscuit and a cup of tea or two. Usually because Mrs Hudson made it for him." He finally turned to John, casting him an accusatory glare.
"It seems Victor Trevor has been trying to stay 'relevant' for the last ten years," Mycroft continued, "first with the photos, and then a couple of years ago he admitted to leaking your name to the press on some blog."
Mycroft huffed, "I know the difference. But if you don't want to tell, that's fine."
Mycroft turned on his heel and walked away, but Bertie called out to him.
"Katie Dodd, age twenty-one. University of London student. Apparently there is a flaw in the shower door. If you keep the hot water on too long, the metal door seals itself shut."
His PA chuckled. "First up we have Molly Hooper. Twenty-five, single. Claims that ghosts have been speaking to her since she was thirteen."
danced on the air and settled into his heart.
Greg opened his mouth to speak, but before he could get words out, Prof Smallwood walked past. The riding instructor was a beautiful woman just past her prime. She was as gracious as she was graceful. She was in riding gear, her helmet tucked carelessly under one arm, and her grey hair flew about in gentle waves, suggesting that she had just pulled off her helmet.
Victor gulped, but didn't make a move toward the car.
Jeff looked at Mary and then turned back to John. "You've got a deal."
She just smiled and went back to work.
"You mean it? You want me to move in with you?" John asked.
"Played? Play what?" John asked.
The two men stood waiting at the door. Then the thumping returned, a little weaker, a little more desperate. As they were now closer to the sound, they could hear plaintive cries for help over the shrieking of the wind.
"John Watson," Sherlock began. "You have brought light to my life in ways I never thought possible, but more than your own glow, you are my conductor of light. Everything I thought to be abhorrent: love, sentiment, desire–you have shown me to be the greatest of assets. I was told that I was heartless, but it turns out that you held it in your hands all along." Sherlock cleared his throat and his lower lip quivered ever so. "Will you marry me?" He pulled out the ring and John gasped.
. Close enough to hurt, and the charge in the air is making John far more reactive than he usually is. Shutting his laptop and putting it under his arm, John makes his way towards his own room, disposing the empty tea cup on his way.
Then again, it might be better to simply have this over with.
This isn't like the kissing.
Things that, until this day, had usually been strong enough to cancel out some of the noise. One of them was no longer valid, because using it would disable him from The Work, and The Work was a far more potent distraction. A far more respectable one too, his brother might add.
- to follow the trail of a Portuguese leak. Not even he himself could berate--
Sherlock concludes early on that “living” isn't one of the things in which he's naturally gifted.
Getting up from the table, John bunches up the jacket he'd put beside him on the seat, folding it over his arm and letting it obscure what's most likely a fairly visible bulge. He heads to the stairwell, taking the stairs slowly as he thinks about how it would feel to once again get to teach such a brilliant man something, see him slightly out of his depths, looking up at John, waiting for instructions as he kneels in front of the woman John just picked up at the lounge and brought back to their room.
Perhaps (
It's just one word, but so far it’s promising. Sherlock’s voice comes out clearly and he's both clean and dressed.
. What's there to understand?
Being gay isn't contagious, but shame is.
The key to a shell game is to feint the spectator into thinking that they know under what shell the object is. And that’s what this is; making it seem like Sherlock has found the reason behind John’s actions, close enough to the truth to be believable, yet far enough to distract from any potentially more threatening explanations.
“OK, I’m sending the logs, but basically this girl was in some kind of loose network. There were loads of cells, didn’t know too much about each other, and it looks like they were out to protect victims of some kind of crime against
“And here I was, beginning to think you liked that riding crop for reasons unrelated to post mortem bruising, but that’s not it then, I take it. You prefer me to use my hands…
To Sherlock, that word comes from the dirty mouth of a soldier that knows he’ll soon get off, not from a man in a sweater vest who just got home from work.
(Two puzzles at once is more than enough when your brain is trying to disassemble itself for reasons that are chemical rather than circumstantial.)
(This is what a chemical defect feels like. Sherlock knows that better than most, so he won’t ever call it ‘love’ again. Things should be called by their real name, and so this is what it is; a chemical defect.)
Of course he’d known that the box wouldn’t still be there. Logically, he’d known. He’d told John about the box, and given John’s character and profession, it would be highly unlikely that he’d let a box containing illegal drugs remain in the possession of an ex-addict. Still, as long as Sherlock hadn’t opened the cupboard, he couldn’t be quite sure that the box was actually  gone. It was a bit like Schrödinger’s cat, but in this case it was ‘Sherlock’s cocaine’ that was the object or conception in question. And now he knew that there wasn’t a cat in the box, and no box in the cupboard. What he didn’t know, however, was if he ought to be relieved or distressed, but he found that his brain settled on feeling none of those emotions. Instead of reacting, his mind blanked. Sherlock stared at the empty shelf, trying to react, but failing to doing so. It was just an empty space on a shelf, and emptiness wasn't something new to him.
this; finding your libido slowly restoring itself to the state it had been in when you were seventeen.)
There are no questions. John was never one to grab for more than he was freely given. Never greedy the way Sherlock is.
John’s voice is a whisper over Sherlock’s skin, and as the meaning of John’s words register in his mind, Sherlock frowns.
Sherlock sighs.
It had never used to be about damage, or even about causing himself pain. The pain was just a mean used to regain control. His fingers would find their own way to the skin of his palm, pinching it to keep himself from lashing out or falling asleep. His head would hit the wall, repeatedly, just to make the chaos go away. He would bite the inside of his cheek just to feel that it was there, that his body was palpable and real and not dissolving the way it sometimes felt like it was dissolving when things had gotten too much and he was no longer sure where he ended and the rest of the world begun.
won't get any better-- he just wants this to stop so he can get some relief, a glimpse of peace--)
By the time John returns home from the clinic, slightly late due to having passed Sainsbury’s to pick up toothpaste on his way, Sherlock is lying curled up at the sofa, facing the sitting room, performing risk-reward analyses on every addiction he's ever had and ending up with results that could best be described as ‘inconclusive’.
This is not a conversation they have. They don't do
She’s waiting for him outside the library in the south of Edinburgh, but he doesn't recognise her from the photos on Facebook. Instead, it's a process of elimination. She's the only one remotely the right age and height currently on the street.
Around him, everything seems to be spinning, and beneath him, the floor is slowly swaying like it is attempting to rock him to sleep.
this - so his mind is curious and he won't brush John off again.)
“Sherlock. We need to talk.” John’s voice is determined as Sherlock looks up from the screen of his phone, afternoon light creating sharp contrasts on the kitchen walls. He’s just sent a text, asking Lestrade for the case files on the missing woman.
In the end, there are more than five trips to the same disgusting lavatory, the tapping, mumbling, touching and counting slowly giving way to pinching, hitting and pulling. The knowledge that things have not been this bad for at least fifteen years - the cocaine withdrawal notwithstanding - does nothing to ease the pressure and the hate he feels for everything - the toddler, the creaky doors of the train compartment,
The ghost of a grip around his wrist. That same voice, balancing between anger and something infinitely more complex. It's only sense memory, but it feels almost palpable.
But no. That isn't it, regardless of what Sherlock's own disgusting self-pity would like to suggest.
“Alright, that’s it, Sherlock. What have you done to yourself this time?”
When he comes, it’s with John’s fingers still inside his mouth and John’s other hand rubbing his nipple roughly, and the sounds he’s making-- John will hear, will be coherent to hear them without the haze of his own orgasm surrounding him, but the sounds slip out anyway and Sherlock’s hand eventually still, smeared with come and shaking ever so slightly.
Overcompensation, characterized by a superiority goal, leads to striving for power, dominance, self-esteem, and self-devaluation.
“So, she keeps in touch, does she?”
He’s not a good enough lier when it comes to John.
“That,” John replies with a smile in his voice, but the smile isn't his usual kind, Sherlock can tell from the sound, “was hardly my point.”
“Oh, brother; everything’s always part of somebody’s game. The question is whether or not you’re sitting at an empty table, moving all the pieces yourself.”
There’s a case and there’s a lead -
Although not as intriguing as the fact that there's restraint in John's movement; that there's something John is restraining himself from.
Sherlock has a vast experience in what psychology refers to as ‘sensation seeking behavior’. It's what keeps his brain from--
And while Sherlock still might not always want to live, he can often find himself  die either.
Outside, the rain is pouring down, and through the partially open window behind where Sherlock is standing he can feel how charged the air is. It’s only a matter of time before the thunder finally breaks loose, releasing all tensions in violent meteorological phenomena.
. Sherlock watches John through his own lashes, pretending to be lost in his mind palace. John relaxes a fraction, lowers his paper an inch, still eyeing Sherlock, who is lying motionless in the sofa. There’s an almost invisible twitch at the left corner of John’s mouth -
,” Sherlock says with a provoking half-smile.
One by one, Sherlock works his way through the different diagnoses.
An optical illusion due to how the water breaks the light, nothing more. Sherlock might be warmer here in the hot water, but his skin wouldn't glow from it.
Homosexual.
Some of the muscular tension in his shoulders eases a fraction as he realises that John hasn’t thrown out either the antidepressants or the benzodiazepines. There was a clear risk that he would; he’s been reluctant to keep even his own pain medication in the flat after finding out about Sherlock’s history with narcotics. Placing the narcotics amongst Sherlock’s own belongings is an unexpected course of action.
He’s slipping.
(It looks more like John's face when he's pulling the safety on his gun or when he's following Sherlock somewhere he knows they can’t escape from without some level of collateral damage, like--)
“Take your clothes off. All of them.”
There’s no time to revel in the surge of adrenaline, because a  smuggler is still  trying, rather competently, to end Sherlock’s life.
"He does like to meddle," Sherlock called from the sitting room.
"Detective Inspector," Mycroft greeted.
John lit up and readily agreed. Which is how they had gotten to this. Freezing their arses off at the closest ATM, as John tried his new card to get cash out.
John snorted. Pissed. In both senses of the word. She hadn't been a teetotaler to start with, but now he would call her a full-blown alcoholic.
departments, which I have complete creative and professional control of, and I am most assuredly
"My apologies," John told the customer. "I hope to get this fixed for you as quick as I can."
When she pulled back, she was practically vibrating. "Oh, god, John. The book was so good. I bought three copies. One to read, one for you to sign so I can have a collectors item for when you're famous and a third one to lend out to friends."
Greg wilted. "Of course not, My, I'm just tired."
Mycroft eyed him warily but elected to leave it alone, Anthea was happy and that was all that really mattered.
"All the way?" Sherlock asked in horror.
Sherlock rubbed his chin. "It's been so long now, but I'll talk to Mycroft. He has friends in journalism who might be able to dig something up."
“So, sneak out in the morning,” he suggested.
John blinked, his head achy and foggy. "Sherlock?"
Mycroft grumbled unhappily and packed up his things to head to Mrs Hudson's office.
"Um," John said, "we're not joking."
Mike looked over his shoulder and then back at Sherlock. "You like experiments, yeah?"
"You can't sleep in your work things," Sherlock explained.
Irene Adler," Mycroft teased.
"Mostly RAMC, but when I was studying for my medical degree, I was in the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers," John explained.
Sherlock groaned. "And only one of them actually cares about me as a person and not just some notch in their bed post."
John looked torn. "But I promised James that he could drive with me."
"You did? So you're the one who told him to write the sequels and to leave the first one at a cliffhanger," John growled. "Boy do I have a bone to pick with you!"
"The deal is off," John bit out.
Anthea decided to go right after school, Mycroft was off being angsty about Greggy asking him out to prom and wouldn't miss her. She rolled her eyes. Those two just needed to get their heads out of their arses, honestly, but it was not her problem unless either of them made it so. And so far they seemed content to just snipe at each other. Though she couldn't speak for anyone else that might be involved, she was just glad they kept her out of it. Well, other than Mike asking about Mycroft's take on the after-party meltdown.
"Look who found me, Mikey," Bertie sneered.
Greg rolled his eyes. "No one need know. As long you two don't suddenly start spending money like there is no tomorrow, people aren't going to notice or care."
John continued to card Sherlock's hair as the younger man looked up at him.
"I just have the
"Oh, Sherlock," Mike said, drawing close to the pair. "No, no, no. You've always had people who cared. They may have not have understood, but they cared. Mycroft, Greg, even Anderson."
Sherlock leaned back, startled. "But you're a rugby star, what would you need with a medical degree?"
The sound of footstep approaches and Sherlock continues to pace, faster now, but his footsteps can’t keep up with his tachycardia.
“Fuck,” John breathes, and Sherlock isn't sure exactly what about his list had provoked that reaction.
On his way out from his second appointment with the child psychiatrist with the yellow teeth and the questionable hang-up on Sherlock’s relationship with his own mother, Sherlock decides that if there is in fact something wrong with him, then he ought to be the first to know, not the psychiatrist. He should at least get the chance to be on slightly more even ground with the so-called professional if they are to keep discussing his ‘developmental delays’ and ‘oppositional behaviours’. He grabs the first book he sees on the nearest shelf that has ‘psychiatry’ in the title and puts it in his school bag as he follows the nicotine addict out of the office.
Failing to present itself when the pain and touch originate solely from his own actions, but is released when in closer physical proximity to another person whilst the pain and the touch is applied.
This was expected, but it’s still a sign of cognitive failure and lack of control over his own thoughts. Therefore it’s unacceptable, and needs to be surmounted. Not right now, though; now there’s a case and John’s finally beginning to let go of his suspicion about Sherlock’s recent behaviours. He will simply have to quarantine this problem until after the case. The dopamine and adrenaline from working the case should allow him to pause the urge to relieve more pressure by pursuing more patterns.
The only time John actually interacts with Sherlock that night is when John is traversing the short corridor to the bathroom. His steps falter before he reaches the room in question, and then there's a shout - an anomaly, considering that John rarely raises his voice when he perceives that Sherlock’s in a ‘black mood’.
In the end, he’d decided to end it himself.
In the distance -
“You mean that what I've seen so far is your brain being ‘slow’?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wasn't aware you had even started.”
Sherlock thinks as his body reacts, rocking up against John’s body even though he’s not even that hard anymore, even though he wants to snap and push away and hurt more than he wants to shag.
Sherlock is familiar with the conversation that is soon to follow. It’s a conversation they’ve already had once, a year and a half ago, during their first meal at Angelo’s.
Impulsivity (or impulsiveness) is a multifactorial construct that involves a tendency to act on a whim, displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought, reflection, or consideration of the consequences. Impulsive actions are typically "poorly conceived, prematurely expressed, unduly risky, or inappropriate to the situation that often result in undesirable consequences," which imperil long-term goals and strategies for success. A functional variety of impulsivity has also been suggested, which involves action without much forethought in appropriate situations that can and does result in desirable consequences. "When such actions have positive outcomes, they tend not to be seen as signs of impulsivity, but as indicators of boldness, quickness, spontaneity, courageousness, or unconventionality" Thus, the construct of impulsivity includes at least the two independent components of, first: acting without an appropriate amount of deliberation, which may or may not be functional; and, second: choosing short-term gains over long-term ones.
Sherlock’s reactions are, for all intents and purposes, not always similar to those of most other people, so John knows that he shouldn’t be surprised.
Sherlock just need something to take his mind off…
John licks his lip, that sometimes infuriating habit that Sherlock knows means that John is either nervous, searching for words or trying to get his head around something. In other words, it's a very frequent habit.
- and he doesn’t need colors for this, he can ignore them for now.)
John backs off a bit, giving Sherlock room to follow him. Sherlock feels naked, stripped of the proximity and neurochemical reactions from kissing. This is the point at which people change their minds, Sherlock realises. This is where people sober up from suddenly having all that space between them.
There’s one confirmed hypothesis.
Once again, the words escape before Sherlock has a chance to filter them. The deadpan inquiry seems strangely out of place given their positions and the way his blood rushes through his body.
Apparently that's the right answer, because Eva smiles as she plays with her almost empty beer glass.
“I didn’t mean-- I’m sorry, that was…”
Sherlock opens his eyes as another hand touches the back of his neck. It begins as a light touch but turns into a steady grip where Sherlock’s nape and tendon is held between a thumb and four dry, calloused fingers that feel so illogically warm against his own skin.
"They are all much bigger publishing houses," Irene replied. "Although, I suppose, you could be gobbled up to be one of their imprints...if you can suffer the indignity."
"Was any of it real?" Mycroft asked, tears streaming down his face.
Sherlock pushed the jacket off John's shoulders and after a brief struggle of limbs, it was on the floor. The whole time, their mouths kept seeking the other's, as if they couldn't bare to be apart for long.
"There's this kid that got stranded by his friends, would it be all right if we meet back up at your place?" John asked.
"Mycroft," Sherlock greeted warily. He hadn't heard anything from his brother regarding John's ill-fated meeting with Sherlock and whether Mycroft had heard back from John. Oh, they had exchanged pleasantries, and Mycroft had yelled at him for the disaster Sherlock and John had made of the house, but not what he wanted to hear. And of course Sherlock daren't ask Mycroft directly, because unlike Mrs Hudson's, the teasing would
"Are you following me?" Mycroft asked with a sneer, gripping the records tight.
John left Greg to his line control and went in search of Mike. He found his friend pulling out pots and pans from under the kitchen sink.
"You think he blew it up and blamed you?" Greg asked.
"What?" Mycroft asked defensively. "Worried I might be rubbing off on him?"
"Happy Christmas, Sherlock."
“Well there’s that, too. But hell, Sherlock, I’m not mad, I’m curious. Who has the great Sherlock Holmes smiling like that?”
"He did damn sight more than that."
Sherlock was up like shot, dumping John on the floor. He was nearly to bathroom when he called over his shoulder, "Well, what are you waiting for?"
"Where did you get that?"
There was some nervous twittering from the crowd. "I refuse to write another one," Sherlock continued and the nervous twitters became more anxious.
"Look inside," John prompted.
Mike beamed. "Hell ya!" His grin faltered a little though..
Sherlock shook his head. "It was the thunder. Lightning lit up the sky in beautiful pale blue but the thunder crashed almost immediately. It frightened me so badly, I fell out of the tree and broke my arm."
James smiled in consolation. "I know you're on your break, but she's with a customer and I don't know how to fix it."
Mrs Hudson flinched. "I called," she whimpered, "but you mustn't have heard me."
Will began to visit them every other day to make sure that they were okay.
"Julie!"
Mike shook his head. "Not in the way you mean. Did I think that you two would make a perfect team, sure. But love? Not until he winked at you did I even think that it might tend that way."
Enjoy!
"Oh, that's very kind of you," John said, amusement and delight coloring his tone. "May I borrow your phone?"
Sherlock blushed. Then he looked up at John and chewed on his bottom lip. "Where will you be?"
"Sherlock is around here somewhere, I'm sure he'll find you," Mycroft murmured. "In the meantime, why don't you go get yourself something to eat? You look dead on your feet."
Mrs Holmes was grateful that her birthday hadn't been ruined.
It was looking more and more likely that he was going to have to go to Cork and kick their arses into gear.
"Ghosts? Are you sure there are ghosts?" Sherlock asked.
Bertie hesitantly removed the glasses to reveal a black eye and a butterfly plaster on his nose.
"Anyway," Greg ploughed on. "Last year my papa was in a horrible accident and I spent six months at his bedside, helping him get back on his feet." He cleared his throat. "But while I was out there I was surrounded by horses and polo again and I loved it. So when I got back to England,
John shook his head. "I was too happy to see you again."
, Richard got Sherlock so wrapped up around him," the man gripped the handle of his umbrella until it turned his knuckles white, anger radiating up and down the lean figure, "that when he took off in the middle of the night with some Russian ballerina, Sherlock drowned himself in every addictive substance that he could get his hands on. I won't let it happen again. Not while I still have breath in my body."
