“What?”
But the day had stopped resetting and all of the commandos had died in the line of duty, following Steve’s orders.
Tony looked at him, his eyes wide and so very earnest. Well, shit, Steve thought. With those Bambi eyes, Tony could probably talk him into jumping of a cliff. And at this point, what did they have to lose? His hand was still resting on top of his. He turned his hand over, and laced their fingers together. Tony looked at him with such hope and gratitude. Gratitude, like he was thankful that Steve would even listen to him, after Tony listened through his whole sob story, complete with waterworks. That he trusted him. His hand was smaller and warm against his, his fingers and palm slightly rough with callouses. They were covered in the soot and oil that Tony seemed to unconsciously attract. He rubbed his thumb against his hand. That didn’t work, now they both had soot on their hands. Tony had soot all the way up his arm to the elbow, and a screwdriver tucked absentmindedly behind his ear, behind a lock of hair. His hair looked soft, and he wanted to brush it out of from Tony's bright eyes. Beautiful brown eyes like hot chocolate after the cold of working outside all day, warming you sweetly from the inside out. Brown like the first cup of coffee in the morning, reduced down with fresh milk, when the world was quiet and peaceful and there was a whole day to look forward to. Brown like a forbidden sip of whiskey, sharp and sweeter because it was stolen. It was too dark in the kitchen to see the flecks of gold that he knew were there, and he leaned forward a little to see better, and Tony was leaning forward too, and suddenly they were kissing. Steve let out a soft “oh,” of surprise, and Tony pulled back, his eyes fluttering open with concern. Steve brought a hand up to cradle Tony’s face, his other hand still holding his. Tony leaned back in with more confidence, and kissed him again. After a day of cold lethargy, he felt like he was on fire, that now that Tony was here, anything was possible. They’d deal with problems as they came, and they were going to do this whole crazy thing. Day or night, no cloudy thoughts on sunny days. Steve broke their kiss just long enough to whisper soft against his lips,
“Right.” Tony agreed with an exaggerated sigh, like being apart from Steve was the worst thing he could think of. What next? What would they do now if they were actually in love?
“Could have gone worse.”
“Sure. Easy. It’s this one.”
“God no, you've got the personality of a wet dish towel. Just… just like, get off your ass, and go talk to people. It's not that hard, and I'm sure you'll find someone as boring as yourself eventually. Christ, I need another drink.”
Steve took a deep breath. “Pretend to be in love with me.”
“So what do you want me to do?”
“You guys are so enthusiastic, it’s weird. In a good way!” He assured them.
“What did you do today? Captain America things? Did you fight for truth, justice, and the American way? Did you make your country proud?”
Steve still couldn’t see himself marrying Tony. But friends? That didn’t sound so bad. That didn’t sound bad at all.
There was a person inside there.
Bucky tilted his head to the side playfully. “Previous heir, oh my. You're practically royalty then, aren't 'cha? And handsome to boot."
Steve let out a roar of incoherent rage. He ripped off his shirt and dropped down and shifted to his wolf form, his skin erupting with white fur as his jaw lengthened. He wiggled out of his pants, the whole process from man to wolf taking less than three seconds. He lunged forward, lashing out. Tony jumped out of the way, and Steve paced, waiting to see what he would do.
“Money… money might be doable. Wolves though… wolves do what they want. I can't force them to join your pack, when they'd rather be here. Your pack does have a reputation as being… well, old fashioned. Out of touch with the times. Plus...how shall I say this delicately? Frugal? Yes, let’s go with that. Wolves just aren't interested.” he said with a shrug.
They all glanced around nervously.
“Oh yes you are. Where is it?”
, it was a whole new ball game.
“No, no! I have a plan for that too. When we go to Stark Industries, I’ll ask Obie for my wedding ring. It's tradition in my pack to pass down rings, so my Grandpa's ring has been put aside for me. I wasn’t supposed to have it until we’re married, but I’ll say I want it as a proof of our engagement or something. Then we go to the pawn store in town, and sell it. We can buy it back after we pay off the bank, a few days before the wedding, go get milkshakes, and celebrate our complete and total success. It’s perfect!”
He heard a creak as the door opened and shut, and he relaxed as he realized who it was. Tony came in and sat down beside him. He pushed himself around to lay his head in his lap and Tony brushed a hand through his hair.
They rounded the people up and Clint glared at them as Tony sat in front of the main computer and cracked his knuckles. Since he was in the Capital building itself, he was able to connect to the internal secure server and start disabling the defenses. Whenever it asked for administrator permissions he simply entered his own code. He had built most of these systems and the most top secret weapons, his security clearance was only short of the president and his advising cabinet. When he was blocked, the screen flashing red warnings, he paused, thinking. Obie was an incredibly smart and secretive person. He was also old, and like every other old person, had a complicated relationship with technology.
Steve let Tony go and looked over the mess of flour and bowls scatter across the counter. He had the feeling that he would be the one washing them later.
“There you go! That would get you to first base no problem.”
Steve nodded. “You and I will break in to the castle on the eve of the battle. With luck we will return before dawn and fight with the rest of the resistance. If we do not make it back, assume that we have failed in our mission, and Jan will be in charge.”
This was...fine. It was fine. Sure it felt like his heart been ripped out now, but he would get over it, like he got over everything. They had already broken up, it’s not like this was news. Steve stared at the ceiling and tried to convince himself that it didn’t hurt.
“What? No. Neither are you, so that doesn't make me any less of a pack leader-”
Steve nodded and stroked his dragon’s head one more time, promising that he would be back. He pressed a kiss to her scaled head and used the boulders to push himself to his feet. Tony wrapped an arm around his back, and they started the trip back. Tony felt an aching sadness as they left the dragon, and did his best to shake it off. It was a beautiful creature and he was sad whenever an animal got hurt, but it shouldn't have been affecting him that much. Maybe he was picking up the general mood from Steve who was clearly devastated to be leaving his dragon alone and injured.
“It wasn't a loan.” He huffed, “It was a dowry. I agreed to an arranged marriage, signed a contract, and came home with a check and a fiancé. That was the first time I met Tony.” He gave a small shrug and tried to play it all off as no big deal, like he hadn't spent days agonizing over it and more time after regretting it.
They broke apart to see Sam standing in the doorway with his arms crossed. “Do I need to leave again? The rest of the team is getting impatient.”
“It’s not a joke. You’re a superhero, you fight crime in a flying metal suit, you were attacked by a magic user while fighting downtown. You live in a tower with the rest of our friends. Any of this ringing a bell?”
“I don’t get fevers.”
“I don’t,” Steve insisted. “I naturally run hot. Part of the bond.”
In the tube beside him Steve was standing with military stiffness, his legs spread and hands behind his back. The platform started to rise, bearing them up to the surface and the waiting arena.
“Give me a minute and I’ll be fine.”
“The one and only. It’s April 26th, 2019. You’re at the hospital. Can you tell me where you are?”
He shook off his useless gauntlet and held out his hand. “Tony Stark, Iron Man.”
“I’m mature! I can totally handle it.” Tony insisted. Suddenly he didn’t feel like a maverick for going off script, he felt more like a disobedient child who had colored outside the lines and now his father didn't want to hang it up on the fridge.
Tony didn’t want to get up, instead letting his eyes unfocus and the sounds from the TV wash over him. Apparently they hadn’t been able to get any usable footage from Steve because they skipped his interview again with no explanation as Christine talked to everyone. Then Stane appeared on TV. Instead of the usual spiel about the glory of the Capital, he announced that he had some terrible news.
“Just stay out of my business!” Steve yelled. He grabbed his spool of wire and tromped back to the field to work on the fence. He didn’t know why he bothered, she hadn’t listened the last hundred times. He just didn’t want the two of them to go charging in and mess everything up when he finally had things going right. Was that too much to ask?
“More likely they didn’t want the US government to know that you were coming from their country after they signed the accords, and only trusted Wakandan stealth tec to make sure you weren’t tracked.”
Steve looked at him in confusion and concern. “We already said yes?”
“You know me, love trusting strangers.” Steve agreed and looked through a few recipes until he found some pictures he liked, and clicked on the website.
“No, shush, this isn't about me, tell me what you did, Steven.”
“It’s worse than you can imagine. Loki killed all who stood against him, leaving the castle empty except for his mercenaries. He raised taxes on the towns and sends men out every week asking for more. Then he squanders it all on clothes and wine and shows. The farmers who fight back have their fields burned, and the sky is black with ash. The resistance is gathering in the northern mountains, but our numbers are few, and Loki has weapons of the like which we have never seen. All of his men are armed with the finest forged Stark steal, and they rain destruction down from flying devices they call airplanes. Stark built those too. If I ever meet the man, I will run him through, and laugh as he begs for mercy as I watch him bleed out.”
“We don’t have a relationship.” Tony said petulantly, leaning away. “That was just an excuse to send me here.”
Vanko grabbed him by the throat and dragged him to the thick post buried in the center of the clearing. Sometimes they hitched the horses to it, when they were dropping off supplies. Now Vanko and a couple of his guards used it to tie Tony’s arms above his head to the top of the post so that his feet barely touched the ground. Tony struggled and Vanko slapped him, knocking his head back and making his ears ring.
“You’re a nice middle ground,” was the way he put it.
The sound of an audience clapping and cheering rained down from the speakers, drawing Tony out as he tried to figure out what was going on. He grabbed the arm of one of the peacekeepers. “What was he talking about? Why is Christine acting like nothing happened?”
“I thought it might be interesting?”
“No. NO!” Steve yelled. He patted Tony’s face. “Tony, come on, wake up, it’s ok, I didn’t mean to, Sweetheart, Tony-”
“Get bludgeoned on the head a few times with a bat and see how you feel.” Brian snapped. “Kane, the blonde bloke, stood in the middle of the street to lure me out, then
“You got your kiss, now leave me be.” He talked towards the road to rejoin the wagons, Steve's disappointment blurring into his own.
“What’s wrong?”
Pepper was not happy with him when he called, and he lied about why he needed the name and number. Pepper wouldn’t understand and he didn’t have time for a lecture. He scribbled it down on a napkin, thanked her, and dialed the new number.
She sighed. “Steve, he told off a stranger who was twice as big and twice as angry. Your ma would have loved him. Just give him a chance, alright? You've both had a rough day, you might find yourself getting along a lot better when you've both had some time to settle.”
Steve mentally shook his head. Ok. This whole friends thing was going well. No fighting yet, at least. His younger cousins had been joking about him liking him right? Oh course they were. Weren’t they? Suddenly that was all he could think about.
Steve pulled him down and pressed their lips together as snow fell from the sky in a scene straight out of a story book. Tony had a feeling that it was going to be a very Merry Christmas for the both of them.
But now he knew Tony would be able to shift, and in a less than a day they would get to have their first run since Tony joined. Steve couldn’t wait.
Tony stood as well. “Mission accepted, Avengers are incoming, ETA thirty minutes. Team, suit up.”
“What? I built them, I can take them down.”
Tony pulled his arm from Steve's grip irritably. “We gotta wait for everyone else to get back from chasing the birds, and our team is taking their sweet time as usual. I swear, one of these days I'm going to build you all rocket boots and be done with it.”
Jan's eyes narrowed. “What did you negotiate with?”
“No, seriously Clint, he just disappeared.” Steve said with a frown, gesturing to the empty seats at the table. Clint nodded.
Tony frowned at him. “What? I’m not that dramatic.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The guard glared at him through narrowed eyes. “I know the bloke who fixes these things, a chatty skinny fellow. Neither of you have permission to be up here.”
Tony wished he had enough energy to tell Steve that he was helping, just by being there. It felt good not to be alone, to feel someone else’s warmth and comforting touch.
“You like him so much, why don’t you marry him?” Steve shot back.
“You just told me that wasn't possible, I don't understand what games you're trying to play with me….”
Steve handed them over then grabbed Tony’s hand as he brought it to his mouth. “We need to make sure your foot is set in the right position first. If the bone is misaligned it’ll heal wrong and you still won’t be able to walk.”
Raza nodded and went back to sit under the lean to, where he slowly sharpened his knife in a quiet threat. Tony heaved out a deep breath. He had no doubt that Raza would follow through if Tony didn’t produce something, but he didn’t want to give him a working bomb to hurt someone else with either. They would have to try to make a run for it. Tony pretended to work, while keeping a close eye on Raza. When he got up and wandered away to go to the bathroom in peace, Tony grabbed Yinsen by the arm and started dragging him into the woods in the other direction.
“I’m going to go find it.”
“Apparently it’s a lot, since I’m not going to ask you to go skinny dipping to prove your loyalty.”
“Move and I shoot you.” Tony growled, his eyes too sharp to have been sleeping, his hand encased in a gauntlet.
“I was tossing hay. It was fine.” he stuttered out, suddenly overly conscious of every word.
Steve laughed. “You guessed right.” The smile dropped from his face. “I’m sorry I acted like that last night, you’ve been upfront with me from the start about this being about Christine. I shouldn’t have tried for more.”
Or option two, Tony was being a sentimental idiot about his security codes. Not everyone was as nice as Steve and Tony was going to be in a world of pain if he had other cracks in his security like this. That was probably all this was. Tony being careless. The man who had never had a security breach in all the years Steve had known him, who reset the codes every month, who had Friday double checking everything. Maybe, for once, Tony forgot. He certainly forgot his jacket enough.
“Enough,” a voice said, stopping Rumlow attack and silencing the cruel laughter of the men. Rumlow kneeled and held his head low.
Tony grabbed his wrist and looked him in the eyes. “I do. I’ve gotten to know every single person on this base and in all of the towns near here. And I keep coming back to you.”
“Tell me something you’ve never told me before.”
“Then I would have to wash another bowl. I think I’m going to go for it.”
“It wouldn’t be the worst thing I’ve been caught doing. Come on, it’ll be fun.”
Tony shook his head, choking back tears. He didn’t have anything to say.
In this chapter, Steve remains conflicted over Tony, and things escalate into a fight.
“Is this the guy you’ve been tagging on Instagram? The whole world is already convinced you’re dating.”
He kept his hands over his ears and his eyes to the ground until the leaves were once again hidden in shadow as the broadcast ended and the light faded away. He let his arms fall to the ground and he closed his eyes.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “Have either of you two seen him, yes or no.”
In the previous chapters, Steve agrees to marry Tony in return for a dowry to pay off the debt on his ranch. They don't get along at first, but after a fight they work out all their tensions and tentatively decide to be friends. Tony agrees to stay, at least until the ranch is fixed up.
“Alright you glorified turkey, now you’ve pissed me off.” He raised his arms and tried to fire his repulsors. One shot out a weak pulse that pittered out before it hit the bird, and the other remained dark. Jarvis was never going to let him live this down.
During his rounds a thought had occurred to him, and he asked Steve. “Will your fellow riders be looking for you?”
“That’s not the only reason,” Steve said, the words coming out more heartfelt than either of them were ready for.
And with that Cap walked forward into the eye of the storm.
“I didn’t say that, quit putting words into my mouth.”
his mind kept trying to revert back into its usual routine of chores and work, and gloss over the fact that Bucky was right there, asking about his fiancé. Two distinct sections of his life were suddenly combining, and he still couldn’t figure out how to make them overlap.
Steve laughed and pulled Tony close, like he was telling him a big secret in a crowded room and whatever he had to say was meant only for the two of them. His breath brushed lightly against his ear and Tony shivered.
Steve looked over at the dirty pots and spoons over flowing from the sink and the mess of baking powder and raw egg covering the counter.
“Hmmm,” Tony said doubtfully.
“You were the one to tame her?” Even as Tony asked Steve was shaking his head.
“I thought so too.”
“You’re a great friend and I love spending time with you. Nothing is going to change that.”
“Liberty!” Tony shouted in panic. Most of the arrows bounced off of her hard scales without causing any harm, but one lucky shot hit the glowing blue light in her chest. It shattered and Liberty let out a heart wrenching scream.  Tony dug his fingers into his chest around his own battery as he whispered to himself, “No, no, no…”
“I am content, though a thought plagues me. How long was I asleep?”
“Well, I’m ok.”
Loki stopped moving, and whipped around to stare at Steve. “...Lord Stark?”
Thanks for reading! I posted these two chapters close together so make sure you caught the last one too!
Steve nodded and noted which room Tony entered, so he wouldn’t have to pay Natasha any more 4AM visits. The door closed before he could see inside, and Steve felt his curiosity spark to life. He would have to make an excuse to see.
Steve grabbed some twine and started to rope the bale back together. He tried to act casual. “You would say Tony likes me right? And we did pawn his ring, so he’s pretty invested in our ranch, right?”
Tony turned his head to see Steve sitting on a large bed, holding ice to his head. He wasn’t looking at Tony, instead watching the large TV that took up most of the back wall. Tony got up and sat on the corner of the bed, the blanket wrapped around his shoulders. On the TV contestant's scores from the skill tests were flashing. Steve received last place.
“Could you use the ones at the library in town?”
“Sorry, I don't seem to know my own strength today.”
“Glad to see we finally got ahold of the holy hand grenade,” joked Tony. “But why did they decided to come here?”
There was a loud clatter from the kitchen, loud enough to drown out the sounds of the baseball game on TV. Steve twisted over the back of the couch to see the source of the noise, just in time to see Tony knock an entire bag of flour on the floor in his desperate bid to keep the measuring cups from falling off the counter top.
“You really going to post that?” Steve asked. “I was joking about a picture looking stupid on a metal horse.”
There were gasps from the audience and Stane nodded his head grimly. “Shocking, I know. He had always been a good and loyal citizen, and I believe that he would have remained that way if not for the influence of this man.” They showed a picture of Steve glaring at the camera on the screen while Stane continued to talk. “He is the tribute from District 12, and he has been a threat to our citizens and our way of life since he arrived. He has no respect-”
Tony sighed forlornly. “He does, and more. He is brave beyond measure, and works with great perseverance through his ill health.”
Everyone turned to look at him, as he used his thin frame and sharp elbows to fight his way to the front of the crowd where the other boy had been forced on stage.
“Itching means they’re done. It’s a huge pain when I heal over them and have to cut them out.”
“Fine!” Tony shouted back. He forced himself to his feet and was able to stand with a slight wobble. He climbed out through the hole and into the courtyard. People were fighting everywhere he looked, with swords and bows and fists. Tony limped around to the front of the building and went back inside the prison. He grabbed the keys from where Hank had left them on the wall and let the other prisoner out. The man grabbed his shoulder in surprise and thanks. “You came back for me.”
Steve brought him to the equivalent of a mall made up entirely of restaurants. Perfect smells wafted in from every direction. Tony looked around with his mouth open.
“We agreed to meet at the tree if we were separated!” Steve yelled back.
“You’re the first person I call when I want to get wasted. We’re not friends, and I don’t know if we ever were.”
“I don’t know. I’m going to need to find some food eventually, but I haven’t thought beyond that. Speaking of food, do you want some jerky?”
“More?” Tony had asked over the phone. “What do you mean?”
Tony sat on his couch and checked his phone. Three missed calls from Rhodey. He called him back, and as the phone rang the tv turned itself on with a burst of static.
“Yeah!” he responded. “I did it!”
Tony cautiously sat in the chair meant for guests, and Obie blew a thin stream of smoke from between his lips, tapping his cigar on the tray on his desk. Tony hated that the smell reminded him of solid hugs and a comforting supporting presence.
Steve shook his head. “No, we’re not getting separated again. Look, we were able to get you something to help your ankle once, let’s do it again.”
“And if they all refuse? Then what? They starve to death, one by one, until the Capital has their champion?”
“The ranch isn't worth you tossing away your future and marrying some spoiled brat you'd never even met! Look, I'll go talk to Stane, I'll find you a way out of this, some loophole since we already have the cash.”
After a train ride and a brisk walk, Steve lead them under a high ceiling stone tunnel filled with tables. He held out his arms dramatically. “Welcome to the Brooklyn Flea.”
The next morning Steve’s alarm went off at 5 as usual. He shut it off. Ten minutes later his second alarm sounded. He picked up his watch and shut that one off too. He didn’t get up. He laid on his bed, and watched the shadows shorten as the sun worked its way across the sky. It was cloudy outside. He could have whatever thoughts he felt like. If he wanted to spend the day being sad about Bucky and Ma and his pack and the ranch, no one was going to stop him. He couldn’t believe how little he had been thinking about Bucky and Ma. He was forgetting them, he was a terrible person. And now he was letting their memories down again and again and again. Steve tossed fitfully in the bed.
“Oh, I know who Steve is.” Tony said with a lot more emotion than he had intended. Bruce raised an eyebrow and Tony cleared his throat. “So all the districts have the ability to take and upload video?”
“Right,” muttered Steve, unconvinced at his sincerity.
“See you at dinner,” Steve agreed. He didn’t take his hand off his eyes until he was sure Tony was gone. He felt himself blushing red. Looking back, he had dragged Tony to his bedroom and told him to take off his clothes. He was lucky he didn’t get slapped.
Tony stuck his tongue out at him and settled in deeper. “Think of it as revenge for earlier,” he replied. On the surface he was referring to Clint stealing his chair at breakfast that morning, but it also held a barb for Steve, who was sitting alone in the spot they usually shared and shoving popcorn into his mouth and pretending not to listen. Clint sat of the arm of the love seat next to Steve with a grumble. “I’m picking the movie then.”
“It’s not gone, it's in Wakanda right now. They were kind enough to give us a ride here.”
“We can’t afford-” Steve started, before Clint stomped on his foot. The younger man then tried to act casual as Steve glared at him.
“I think you better just wait…”
“I’m not going to make excuses. I shouldn’t have-”
The peacekeeper stepped forward and hit him again, dragging him from the stage.
Tony had put his name in, more to make Steve happy than out of any expectation that he would win. It had been a surprise when the ballots were counted and Tony’s name came back with twice as many votes as the next highest name.
I've been so busy this week, but I'm back! There's one more chapter to go, then the conclusion and some art. Hopefully this story will be fully complete by Monday? We'll see. Thank you for reading!
“Hell yeah.”
Tony could see the blush building on Steve’s cheeks. “It’s not like that.” He dug the notes out of his pocket and the group passed them around, everyone getting a chance to read.
Steve sat back up. “No more pissing off witches.”
Steve’s eyes widened and he opened his door, gesturing for Tony to go inside. “I think we have a lot to talk about.”
Tony stayed in his cave until nightfall, shivering as his clothes dried slowly from the river water. Occasionally another cannon sounded, marking the death of another tribute. He thought he heard footsteps, then they faded away as quickly as they had come. Tony didn’t see any wildlife, not that he would be able to kill it anyway. He ate a small amount of jerky and his stomach still growled. Tomorrow he might have to start eating leaves and hope none of them were poisonous. Once the sky had completely darkened, loud music played, and the dome of the arena lit up with the symbol of the Capital. 12 of the 24 tributes had died today, their pictures flashing by quickly as a cannon sounded. Tony was relieved to see that both Bruce and Steve had made it through the first day. Tony waited for the announcement from Obie clearing his name and saying that he could come home. Instead the screen fizzed then transitioned to a shot of a ostentatious office. Justin Hammer stepped into the frame and Tony hissed in disgust under his breath. Hammer had always been a thorn in his side, copying whatever Tony did then passing it off as his original idea. He always talked a big talk and didn’t deliver, all flash and no substance.
Tony looked up at him, and all of his energy seemed to bleed from his body. “What if we stayed here for a bit? There’s a couple of beds upstairs.”
Clint had a suggestion. “While we were running from the fire I saw a few large trees we could climb. We could stay up there, no one ever looks up, and if anyone tried to climb after us we could jump branches to a new tree.”
Thank you for reading!
“A day?” Tony repeated in shock. “But-”
“Yeah.”
“I’m getting married!” He yelled back gleefully. His joy immediately switched to panic. They had an hour before they needed to drive out, and Steve spent ten minutes getting ready and the rest of the time pacing while Clint snacked and threw peanuts at him.
“Tony!” Steve called desperately, still holding out his hand.
All of Stane’s guards shifted to wolves, and the men who identified themselves as being of the Shield pack shifted and started fighting them.
The notary nodded, and handed them both a pen. They signed their names on the marriage certificate, hands steady.
He still didn’t respond, hoping she would go away. Instead she walked over, and ran her hand through his hair a few times. She sighed, and he closed his eyes, feeling the soft puff of her breath against his cheek.
Tony continued. “Good. My secret is, that there is a whole world of supernatural creatures out there, existing right beneath your very noses. And though I appear normal to you now, I have powers of the most wicked kind. I have the unnatural ability to transform myself from the normal human you see before you, into a twisted amalgamation that is equal parts a creature most dreadful.”
Steve’s hands were gentle and cool as he undid the bandages, and the relief from the tight pressure felt good. Tony sighed and let his head tip back to rest against the wall. After taking a look Steve rewrapped it again, much looser, more to keep Tony from accidentally jostling it than to try to force it to support the weight.
“What’s on your mind?” Jan asked him.
He hadn’t been a traitor before, but he sure as hell was planning on being one now.
Also, are you guys ready for Endgame? I can't believe they gave us a trailer today out of nowhere but I'm not complaining...
“I’m the smartest guy around, and if I say it doesn’t count, then I know best.”
“You’re trying to spy." Tony said dismissively. " You wouldn’t be here if Obie didn’t tell you to come. Get out of here.”
“You must have heard all of this before.”
Steve shook his head. “Captain America is a symbol someone else made up, and it’s one that I gave up when it became too heavy for me to bear. I’m not a perfect soldier, and I don’t think that I ever was, despite what all the newsreels say.”
“I’ve never tried but I’m feeling pretty confident.”
There was nothing that Steve wanted more. Even if she wasn’t real, she sure looked it, and the chance to talk to her one more time, to say goodbye, when she knew who he was and where they were….
Now he was more confused than before. What had that symbol meant? It seemed harmless enough to him, something he might doodle on paper while on the phone. Not something that needed to be washed away with such urgency and brought the judges to their feet in shock and outrage.
Tony nodded cautiously approached. He turned the first man over, and Tony had to turn away. His arm was gone, leaving his shoulder a mess of splintered bone. The wound would have been too much to heal even with immediate medical attention; after several hours of being jostling in the cart up the mountain the man had bled out long ago. Tony gently turned him back over, and they moved on to the next man. This one was was still alive, though his breathing was shallow.
“Hi, my name is Anne and I loved this recipe for lemon muffins after I replaced the flour with beef stock and the lemons with meat and the poppy seeds with potatoes and served it in a soup bowl instead of a muffin tin. Best beef stew I’ve ever had. Five stars.”
Obie was going to answer for all of this. Tony could no longer pretend that this was all some mistake; the evidence had piled up too high. As President, Obie would have known the truth of the games and their needless cruelty and misused weapons, the truth about the people from the districts and how they were suffering, and truth about Tony. He hadn’t been a traitor, but he had been too close to uncovering things Obie wanted him to stay ignorant of.
Tony went back inside, and Steve turned to go to the barn only to be blocked by his two grinning pack mates.
was worth this.
“Probably. It says 1 t.”
“I will protect you,” Steve said with total conviction. “I swear upon my life that you shall never come to harm under my watch.”
Tony had stayed in the safety and darkness of his cave until this point, but Steve pulled him out with an insistent hand. “This is Tony. He’s joining the Avengers.”
How could the official channel be lying? All of the contestants wanted to go into the arena, right? Why would they have to fake it?
On the screen Hammer gave them all a wide smile and finger guns. “Hello hello tributes! Congratulations on surviving the first day! I have wonderful news for you all… After the unfortunate loss of our last Game Master, my best friend Tony who will be dearly missed;”
“Okay, yeah, I'm done. This isn't going to work. I'm not going to be your docile little husband who mucks out cow houses everyday and makes you dinner every night then lets you verbally abuse me over imaginary infractions.”
“I heard that the Captain is here, Captain Rogers,” the man next to him said. It was Rhodey, one of the castle guards.
Steve looked down at sparrow boned wrists and struggled to breathe in the cold air as his lungs closed up with asthma. He fell to his hands and knees, gasping. The Captain grabbed him by the throat and forced his head up. “The world has no use for Steve Rogers. A threat is coming, and the team needs a captain. It’s time to get to work.”
“I’m sorry Mr. Rogers, I’m afraid there must have been a misunderstanding. You’re still about fifteen thousand short, on the house loan alone.”
Tony rubbed his forehead. “Jesus, Steve.”
Thanks for reading! Things still aren't going great for the boys but I promise things will get better! (Eventually.....)
“Tonnnnnnyyyyy!!!!!”
“I don’t think-”
“I’d say so. You feeling up for changing again tonight?”
“Any emergencies going on today?” Tony asked as he topped up his cup and shuffled over to the table. “Hey, out of my seat, Katniss.”
“What you’re doing right now. Tracking down where things went wrong, and setting them right. It would only be for a year, that’s how long we decided a term was going to last. Put your name in, let the people decide.”
“Hey, you know where Steve Rogers lives?”
“It’s the one month anniversary of the rebellion, and our successful coup of the Capitol.” Steve paused to let the crowd cheer, and he couldn’t help but smile. He waved a hand through the air shushing them. “That's not why we’re here. All of the votes have been counted, and I have the election results for the next President. One voted for by the people, who will save us, not their own selfish interests.”
“Dragons cannot bond with more than one person. It is a single intertwining of heart and soul,” explained a woman with short brown hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Clint came charging up the stairs from the basement. “Steve! What the hell did you do to Tony?!?” he bellowed in rage. He skidded to stop inside the kitchen, and gasped at Steve’s bloody shirt and the scratches on his arms.
Tony stumbled, and played it off like he had tripped on a root in the dark. “Is it really so bad, what he has done?” Tony asked cautiously. “Are you not the king’s most merciful and righteous man?”
That was wrong on so many levels it was sad. Tony sat down next to him and started in on trying to explain. “You can’t cut out the center, it's a matter of resonance. It would burn your leg off, then explode.”
He sat down at the table and Jan slid him a plate of eggs. He ate quickly and gathered up the dishes. He tossed them in the sink to do later, and started herding everyone towards the truck. He took the driver's seat, and after a vigorous game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Tony claimed shotgun. The other two got in the bed, along with the milk and eggs. Steve started up the car, second try, and they were off. The half hour ride to town was peaceful, it still being too early for Clint and Jan to squabble. Tony dozed with his head resting on the window. The pack started to wake up more when he stopped the truck at the first house they delivered to. Clint carried a carton of eggs and a gallon of milk to the front door, and they moved on to their next stop. It was a Monday, so they had about six houses to deliver to. When they finished with the houses, Steve drove them the final stretch into town. He parked the truck, and they all helped carry the remaining milk jugs and eggs inside the grocery store. Steve did his usual haggling with the grocer, while Tony wandered around exploring the store. At this point it was almost eleven, so Clint and Jan left to go save them a table at the bar, where they could get lunch before they finished up their errands. After a few minutes of friendly negotiations Steve was able to get a satisfactory price, and the grocer handed over a chunk of cash. He would be getting most of it back anyway, after the pack came back after lunch to stock up. Steve wasn't going to suffer through the rest of the week surviving on canned ravioli if he could help it. He found Tony wandering through the cereal aisles, and they went outside to find the other two.
After an exciting few hours, Tony ended up with several cardboard boxes filled with old electronics. They went back to the hotel to drop it all off, and Steve lead him to the next restaurant mentioned in the book.
He forced himself to pull away. “We have to get Bucky to a hospital.”
“Really?” Tony mumbled around a mouth full of eggs. “I guess it slipped my mind. It's not too late for me to whip you guys up some omelettes.”
“Jesus Tony, why’d you do that? Sit down, I’m going to go get you some milk.”
Tony’s day started with meetings running from 8 to 2, with a short break in the middle so he could eat a soggy sandwich that was mostly bread and lettuce topped with an obnoxiously strong mustard that Tony bet was supposed to be artisan. He couldn’t wait to visit Steve and get some real food.
Tony sighed. “I’ve had too many people love me in a way I didn’t want to be loved. My father loved me as an extension of his legacy. Obadiah loved me as a means to make him rich. Hammer would tell anyone who asked that he loved me, then turned around and hired a man to kill me. Killian loved me like a fan loved a movie star until he blew up my house. Christine loved me as a piece of news, Maya loved me as a solution to her problems. I blew up all my Iron Man suits, I tried to destroy what I considered the best parts of myself, because Pepper loved me. I almost died in Siberia because you loved me. I’m tired, Steve.”
Tony was too good at this. Steve got up and unlocked the door, returning to sit on his bed. Tony pushed open the door and entered the room cautiously, eyeing his friend. He took a seat on the bed next to Steve, who was avidly avoiding making eye contact to stare at the floor.
The fake crowd clapped and he sat back in his chair, satisfied that he had done a good enough job even if he hadn't read any of the lines scrolling across the teleprompter at the back of the room. It was a live broadcast, they had no way of stopping him and what he was saying was much better than the stuffy lines they had written for him anyway.
Natasha yelled “No!” at the same time as Sam yelled “Oh hell yeah!”
“Don’t you talk to me about guilt when you-”
“If you say one goddamn word-”
Steve grabbed his hands. “This has been building for years, Tony. All the districts are ready, we have weapons and plans and we’ve trained for this. Our only obstacle was getting past the perimeter defenses. This is it; the Capital falls today.”
He’d rather walk into the snow and die with Steve.
“Who is Dottie?” Tony tilted his head, distracted for a moment from Steve’s embarrassment. Maybe that was why he was encouraging them. He wanted to see him squirm. That was a hell of a lot more likely than him actually having any sort of actual interest.
Steve nodded his head in frustrated agreement. “More like annoying. He doesn't think, he doesn't ask, he just does these things, and it drives me crazy.” He ran his hands through his hair and started pacing.
Thanks for reading! Everything I know about the crown jewels came from Wikipedia, so if I got stuff wrong I'm sorry. Hopefully you are are here Steve/Tony drama and not crown jewel facts.
Steve sighed. “Sam, please tell me you haven't gotten into betting too. Clint and Natasha were bad enough.”
“We’re in the basement of the Capital building. The Capital of the Capitol. I came here to wreck some havoc and found you guys.”
“You’re a bastard. I hate you.”
“Jesus, Steve. You’re not getting it.”
“I think it’s time for a plan B, Cap” he said, and stepped fully out of the stream of birds. He decked the man who had been holding the gun, knocking him out and sending the ball in his other hand flying. The rest of the birds disappeared. It rolled to a stop at the feet of the man with the bat. He grabbed it and ran, the birds appearing again and picking up his partner who was already waking up. The birds swirled around them thickly, until they were lost in all the smoke.
“Just a clumsy sort of day,” Steve said, rolling a few of the remaining unpopped kernels around in his hand. He dropped them back in the bowl and put it on the table with exaggerated gentleness and smiled when Tony laughed. He leaned back and let himself relax. “I’m glad you’re here, I thought you were mad at me.”
Clint whistled, long and low. “Oh yeah, that's rough. Last time a person gave me one of those, I was out for a week. Terrible things, just terrible.” Clint looked at him in mock pity. Steve sighed and put his head forward to rest against his knees where they were pulled up to his chest. “Tell me about it.”
“Pepper, how flexible are the rules around dating another SI employee?”
“You’re never going to guess.”
“Friday got her driver’s license. She’s not 16, so don’t tell the government,” he said with a wave of his hand. “I had to build a new jet since a certain someone stole the old one, so I decided to add a few upgrades and make a couple of them while I was at it.”
He played the longest video that showed up in his search results and watched shaky handheld footage of the tops of people’s heads as an overdressed woman dug her hand around in a fishbowl full of paper. She pulled out a slip and read, “James Barnes!”
Hammer pumped a fist into the air in a cheer. “I’ve been promoted! Please, hold your applause, you wouldn’t want to give away your position, would you? I’ll be running the games from here on out, and I’ll make sure it’s a show for the ages. Good night, and may the odds be ever in your favor!”
Tony slapped his hands to his face comically. “Oh no! However much could that be? Oh if it’s anything over $200 we’d never be able to pay it! We'd be right back where we started!”
“It's probably bad that I’m not even surprised at this point. Thieving birds? Sure, why not, makes more sense than the giant bugs from yesterday.”
“Ready?”
Steve was confused, and a little frustrated. He rubbed his face, and looked back at her, trying to explain what was so obvious to him.
They crawled out of their burrow and Steve consulted the compass and set off, Tony following a step behind, still favoring his ankle slightly.
“You missed the distribution of rations. I saved this for you.”
Jarvis stated an affirmative and Steve grabbed his shield and ran downstairs. Within a few moments everyone was assembled in front of the quinjet. Almost everyone.
“You enjoying the show, Cowboy?” Tony asked, not looking away from his work.
“Like Dottie doesn’t break it all the time. C’mon, it doesn’t matter! Because! I! Did! It!””
Tony had to laugh. They had sent him here calling him a traitor, when he was loyal to the bone, and now if he ever made it out he was finally going to be guilty of the crime he was sentenced for.
Around him the others started stripping off their coats and pulling off their pants, leaving them in their underwear and thin undershirts.
“Maintenance!” Steve yelled back.
“We’re going to try to do a speed run. Whatever you do, don’t stop running until you reach the parking lot of the other side of the hill. Get in the grey car and wait for me.”
“It’s just me.”
The problem was that all of the systems were unhackable, and Tony knew this because he had built all of them himself. He had also built himself a neat little back door. He knew it was going to come in handy.
Tony nodded. Everyone polity pretended not to notice how watery his eyes were. “I guess it’ll do.”
“We need a loan. An alliance. And, ideally, more wolves.” Stane's eyebrows drew together as he laid it all out on the table. The older man casually flicked a bit of ash off his cigar, and Steve watched as it hit the tray.
“That's because there's no one else competing for the title. Best archer for our team is more like a participation prize at this point. Now who's ready to break some eggs?”
“Let me bring the truck around first,” offered Clint. He went back outside, and Tony went back down to the basement where the radiator was. Steve followed him down, and watched as he packed up his tools. From the looks of things, he had brought everything from a socket wrench to twenty sizes of screwdrivers with him. He dumped it all into his suitcase, which was filled to the brim with tools. He vaguely wondered how he had even managed to haul it out of the truck and down here, it must have weighed a hundred pounds at least. He also wondered how much of the many suitcases he brought were clothes, and how many were filled with the equivalent of a small garage.
Tony wanted to curse at him. The self sacrificing jerk was relieved not to win. Why would it be such a bad thing, for Steve to go home? He could go back to his best friend and maybe he’d be upset for a few months, sure, but he’d be alive, and if Tony had to go, he’d rather do it knowing Steve was safe. It might even make this whole terrible experience worth it, to know that he had helped to get Steve out safely. Tony squinted at the remaining arrows, the feathers all sticking up high. If he drew the winning arrow, could he give it to Steve?
“Gee Janny, remember the time he found a baby goose and raised it himself after we found it's Ma splattered on the road?”
“Sorry Cap,” added Falcon.
Steve snatched it again. His eyes immediately locked onto the amount.
He handed the plate back to him. “Yeah, I’m aware. You bit me.”
“Do I?”
“Be safe Steve,” Tony cautioned him, more anxious than he'd like to admit, and still unhappy with the so called ‘plan’.
Tony squinted at him. “Yeah. Captain America would never be mean, heaven forbid. Look, if this is some weird team captain thing, you really don't have to.”
And we’ll just say screw it to all of them, and have a great time anyway and you'll come home with me, and any time you doubt yourself, I’ll be here, for the rest of our lives, to say that at least one person really, truly loves you, all of you, just the way you are. I love you Tony, I love you very much.”
“I wanted to protect you.” Steve said desperately.
Steve looked down and realized that he was still holding the red jacket. He tossed it on a chair and pushed the door shut. He sat on the ground next to the bed. He debated agreeing about the coat, then changed his mind, remembering his dream self’s leering face. Liar, liar.
“Did you know?”
It made Tony laugh, every time. Even at the end, when things were bad, and they were sleeping apart and barely talking, Tony would still come to him sometimes and they would sit on the couch a careful distance apart, and Tony would ask him what he did and Steve would make things up until Tony smiled.
Clint looked at him eagerly. “But if we got you the part?”
“You didn’t hear the situation,” he said with exasperation.
“Anyone would be devastated by the loss of my handsome face. I suppose they’ll just have to soldier on without me.”
“Then who would help you bake? Preheat the oven, then we need to mix the dry ingredients. We need flour, sugar, poppy seeds, baking powder, soda and salt. And beef stock.”
The problem was that Steve didn’t know of his plans, and was currently doing his best to win him over. He greeted him cheerily every day, and offered him the first portion of breakfast oats from the pot. He would hand him flowers from the path, and any ripe berries. At night he would set up his blankets beside Tony’s. Tony refused all of his affections, but Steve was not dissuaded.
“Oh. OH SHIT!” Clint yelled, with wide eyes.
Much like in the games, having Steve was the only thing holding him together. He woke up everyday overflowing with guilt, for the weapons he had built, for his misplaced loyalty, and even for killing Stane. He would hide his face in Steve's shoulder, and Steve would run a hand through his hair until his breath stopped catching in his throat. The first few weeks they were back they both woke up at any noise, fists clenched and ready to fight, the arena having trained them to sleep lightly. They'd sit back to back in the dark of Tony's house, eyes watching for a threat to appear, each others company the other thing allowing them to hang on to a thin thread of rationality. Sometimes Tony felt like he had never left, like cameras were still watching him and if he was too loud someone would be coming to kill him. All food seemed precious, and Tony found himself storing jerky and crackers under his bed, just in case. He felt stupid and irrational until he noticed Steve doing the same thing.
The things he had designed were never meant to be used like this, they were supposed to go on the borders to keep everyone safe from the mutated animals that roamed the wilds. Using his weapons to blow up innocents went against everything he stood for, and everything the games were supposed to stand for. The games were meant to show that when they were left alone, the people of the districts would tear each other apart. Instead, five of them had formed a loyal group and called themselves the Avengers, and welcomed Tony in to it. They had shared their food and protected each other and stood together even when they could have run. Meanwhile the Capital had used underhand traps, and sent in peacekeepers to hurt them when they didn’t follow the Capital’s rules. It made Tony think that maybe the Capital wasn’t the beacon of moral purity that he had always assumed. Seeing how the people of the districts reacted to computers and medicine made him realize that what they told him in the mandatory loyalty training was very different from reality. They were lying to him, and the rot ran deep.
“Do you think you have good enough stuff to fake a video?”
“He always picks up for me. Always.“ He said, tapping the phone against his leg. Inside he was going crazy with worry, but he was Captain America, he had to always be in control of the situation. He looked at the ceiling, and said “Jarvis! Where’s Tony?”
Steve shrugged with a guilty look. Clint waved him off. “Don't listen to him. He loves Dottie, he thinks that one of theses days she's going to escape and go on some grand adventure. Mostly she just ends up in the ditch and Steve has to haul her out.”
“Exactly, what point-” Tony said, and at the same time Bruce said “That’s already what happens-”
That got a smile out of Tony before he schooled his face back into indifference and Steve internally cheered. He went to the back of the jet and sat down next to Sam before either of them ruined it by saying something else. Sam punched his knee.
“Someone in the crowd? You can’t trust random videos, they’re fake. You can make up anything you want with computers anymore. You remember the movie we saw last weekend? You really think they found an octopus the size of a house and had him eat the actors? No. It’s not real.”
“I don’t know what you just said and don’t care.”
Scott knocked on the outside of a jet, the sound echoing. “Does anyone have a key? Or know how to fly a jet? I’ve stolen a lot of things and somehow I’ve never stolen a jet before.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve watched him from the other side of the table, head resting on his hand and eyeing the food sadly.
He lunged forward, pulling his small two inch blade from his boot. He stabbed Loki in the chest, the knife glancing off a rib and leaving a long red slash. Loki backhanded him to the ground, and slammed his sword through Tony’s chest with both hands. Tony gasped and shuddered, his mouth filling with blood, drowning out his scream into a tortured gurgle. The world started to go hazy and dark, and Tony watched as Loki stepped away, wiping his sword on his cape. “If he lives, put him in the mines. Maybe it will help change his mind. Now it’s time to take care of the Dragon Captain.”
“Tony, that’s not…” And then there was a beep and the message ended. Steve put down the phone.
Steve leaned forward and kissed him, and Tony put everything he had into it, trying to convey the love inside him that was so large and sharp it felt like it was tearing him apart from the inside out.
“I’m sorry.”
No cloudy thoughts on sunny days. Though technically the sun was set. He pushed himself up anyway. Tony was thrilled.
Tony scooted up the bed to lean against the headboard next to him. He offered him the plate and fork and Steve took a couple bites. “Is it really so much to ask to have a normal conversation?” he asked with a sigh.
“Steve. Please.”
Now he was regretting literally everything, as one of the best looking and smartest people he had ever met was standing in his kitchen looking at him and honest to god flirting, with Bucky nowhere to be found, and the only thing he could think of to say was ‘Um’.
“If the dragon dies, so does their rider. Mark my words, as long as the Captain is alive, his dragon is lurking somewhere on this mountain. I for one don’t want to be here when the dragon decides to burn this camp to the ground to help his rider escape.”
“Is everything in place?”
Without the heavy smell of cigar smoke in the air, Stane smelt wrong, unnatural. He smelt dangerous. Stanes face contorted in rage and he slapped Tony, the sound ringing loud through the barn. People in the audience gasped and stood. Steve caught Tony as he stumbled back, his cheek red and his eyes wide with shock. Tony’s groomsmen joined the Roger pack in facing off against Stane. The numbers were looking good until a group of rough looking men entered the barn and joined the ring of guards already surround Stane. Suddenly they were drastically outnumbered. As Bucky snarled Steve realized that they must have been the goons Stane had hired to kill his pack. Steve growled too, low and threatening, ready to shift at a moment’s notice.
The timer ticked downward and Tony tried to force himself to calm down enough to strategize.
Steve sighed. “Alright, Tony.”
Bucky frowned at him. “He’s too lazy to get his own breakfast? That’s-”
“We don’t get sick, not any more.”
He shrugged, and absent mindedly wiped his hands on his pants, spreading soot there too.
How was it empty? It couldn’t be empty. Tony shoved more snow to the side, and forced his way in, rolling down the slight hill of snow and hitting the back wall of the cave. Out of the wind he could finally fully open his eyes.
They walked back to truck, and found Tony elbows deep in the inner workings, and Jan sweating up a storm. Tony was chatting away as he worked, explaining possible problems and solutions. He greeted the men as they walked back. “Hey guys. While you were away, I figured I’d take a look at the engine, see if I could fix it. And I’ve never seen anything quite like it. It looks like the compression tube is gone. Just gone. That’s pretty wild. I might have expected it to be torn or leaking, but gone? That’s a new one. Almost like someone unscrewed it then shoved it in their back pocket.”
“What, you thought I was going to make you watch me eat? I’m not that much of a douche. Dig in, there’s like twenty pounds of food here and there’s no reason it should go to waste.”
“Anywhere.”
Steve walked around the loop, looking for something specific. He gently ran his hand over the head of an eagle. “This is the one I’d ride when I was little. When the carousel started, it felt like I was flying.” He pointed out a white wolf a couple animals ahead. “That’s the one Bucky would pick, he always wanted to pretend he was racing off ahead of me.”
“Screw this up’ implies that there’s something there to get messed up.” Jan said, perceptive as ever. Her eyes widened. “Oh my god, do you like him now? Like like like?”
“So? So do you. If it was a competition for who could get me redder you would be the winner.”
“What an unexpected tragedy.” Tony added dryly.
His mother spoke for the first time that night. “They don’t get a choice. Only one person can win. If they don’t fight, they die.”
“Leave him alone! What is wrong with you?” Tony pushed the man away and felt a sharp pain in the back of his head, and everything went dark.
“Our Game Master has turned against the Capital, and us as a people. As of today, I denounce him as a traitor.”
“Does it have to be a real one? I’m gonna say a phoenix. Don’t say yours, I’m going to guess. Ummm. Eagle? No, that’s too obvious. Dog?”
Steve took a breath. Ok, that was terrible insulting, yes, and he wanted to ram his fist into that basterd’s doughly mouth, alright, gotcha, but it wasn't technically a ‘no’. He could work with this. He was going to work with this. Janny would be so proud. Clint would be disappointed he hadn’t already punched him.
When he woke up in the future he had to start over a second time. He didn’t have so much as a single chair. Hell, he didn’t even own a pair of shoes. It had taken him a long time to start collecting things again. He had lived entirely in Shield issue t-shirts and pants for a depressingly long time. It wasn’t until Tony and Natasha dragged him out that he got some decent clothes, and moving into the tower was the first time he owned his own furniture and had more than a small barracks style bed and a metal desk. He had just about cried when he saw the comfortable chair, a neat desk, and drawers to put his clothes in that Tony had picked out and put in the room for him. When the whole team shifted to the compound, he had moved in with Tony, along with all of the stuff he had started to build up. An easel, his sketchbooks, a plant, a photo of Brooklyn. Little things, that made it a home instead of a hotel. If Tony had decided he needed a fresh start after their fight then those things would have gone straight into the garbage and Steve would be starting from scratch for the third time. With Thanos coming any day, he wouldn’t have time to waste on something like decorating so he would have to deal with living like it was temporary. For all he knew it was temporary; after Thanos it was possible that he would have to go back on the run. That was a depressing thought.
“They’re just animals, like a flying horse. My friend worked in the stables and he said they had to corral and muzzle the beasts to get them to behave.”
His work with a hammer was much quicker, and they made their way down the line smashing. They broke off the propeller of the last plane as guards burst through the door and surrounded them, swords raised threateningly.
There was a flash behind them, and the both turned. A girl dressed in an expensive pink blouse and skinny jeans was frowning at her bedazzled phone. “I always forget to turn the flash off,” she said with a pout. Tony put his hands on his hips.
“Is it such a bad thing, to want to be loved?” Tony asked.
Though he was now alone with the dragon, Tony didn’t feel threatened. Something about her told him that she was safe.
Pepper was less forgiving. “We have no supplies to carry us through the long journey. Vanko sends the same man to the closest village every time, if we try to go ourselves they will report us to the many guards who haunt the towns on Loki’s behalf.”
Clint grabbed him by the shoulders. “You need to go wreck our washing machine, right now.”
“You do not know who I truly am.”
“Did you watch the reaping for the guy from 12?”
They decided to look for a cave big enough to fit all of them, and picked a direction at random to start their search. Being in such a large group provided safety in numbers, and Tony felt himself relaxing as the others joked around. Clint loved to make stupid jokes and Natasha’s dry whit shocked a few laughs out of him. Thor was relentlessly cheerful, and this was the first time Tony had seen Bruce start to open up. Steve seemed happier and more open too, now that the group was reunited and everyone was safe and accounted for.
Steve slowly shut his eyes, digging his fingernails into his palms. He expected something like this, a slight variation on scenario three. He had prepared for a moment like this, made his plans.
“I know you are. And I’m sorry too, because I didn’t love you like you deserved to be loved either.” Tony closed his eyes and his hand stilled. “I’m going to sleep. Any more talking can happen tomorrow.”
“That is an excellent question.” Liberty flicked her tail and turned her eye towards Tony, who was still trying to take everything in.
“Tony changed the codes every month for security reasons, and that was before he had a reason to purposely lock us out. We’ve only been back a few hours, he hasn’t issued us new ones yet.” Sam explained. “I’ll try just in case; Falcon 1969 Charlie Epsilon.”
“But Steve! Heater!” he whined. Steve was unimpressed.
“You sure know how to flatter a guy.” Tony said dryly.
It cost a hell of a lot more than $900 but Tony knew this was one of those times he needed to keep his mouth shut.
“Right. There’s no point in starting now, is there? Let’s go.” He dragged him to the supermarket, and brought him to the candy display in the front. Steve pulled out the box of ring pops and rifled through the options.
“Can I do it?” begged Clint, practically dancing with excitement.
“I do. No more guilt, no more secrets. Let us in.”
He crossed his arms, smug, as Jan and Steve stared at him in total confusion. “Now, we wait.”
Tony kept his head bowed. “I’m sorry Steve, I’m so sorry-”
Tony squirmed under Steve’s steady look. “It’s in a drawer of my desk in the lab,” he finally admitted. Steve smiled and gave him a brief kiss.
“Why would I lie?” asked Liberty. “We have talked. And now we talk more. It is a human thing, to talk much and exchange little. Hello little hart, I hope that you will be more straightforward than my Steven.”
“You’re a little upset.” Tony countered. “What happened?”
“This is necessary, and
Oh, Tony was tempted. He sweetened the deal. “And I’ll make you muffins.”
The group all stared at the jet in silence.
Warnings for this chapter: Tony shifts and it isn't pretty but it's fast and he is unharmed at the end of it.
When it was time to go on, he sat perfectly straight in the chair with his feet flat on the floor, and made sure to follow the teleprompter exactly. Most of the contestants were quiet, answering most questions with a simple yes or no, their attention focused inward on the trials they would be facing tomorrow. At five minutes an interview, it took them almost two hours to reach the end. Tony was shocked when Steve stepped out onto the stage alone. Were they really going to allow this? What if he attacked someone, like he had done every other time Tony had seen him?
Then Brian chimed in and Steve tensed right back up.
“I never wanted to be a symbol, I wanted to do the right thing! I wanted to help my friends and protect my country, I didn’t sign up for the future and aliens and all this, I don’t want it!”
“Should we intervene?” Steve asked, watching Natasha put Clint in a head lock. Tony took a sip of his coffee.
“One of the contestants was getting aggressive, so they wrapped things up quick. Then Obie made me rerecord all my lines because I went off script.”
Tony kept his head down for the next week, steering clear from the Colosseum where the tributes were and staying inside his apartment. He had plenty to work on anyway, and maybe if he finished the perimeter defense designs then Obie would be less pissed. He’d work on Game Master tasks but Obie still haven't given him any information on how the games functioned from a practical standpoint or what he needed to do.
“A very happy birthday,” Tony agreed with a smile.
Tony shook his head, his face heating. His own mind was warping Steve’s words far beyond their intended meaning. He couldn’t possibly be suggesting…
“You know, just because you’re rich, doesn’t mean you can get away with being a total dick all the time. Guess what? I’m rich too, and furthermore, I’m your best friend, so you don’t get to treat me like this.”
Tony cleared his throat. “I’m only playing along with Raza until the Avengers find us or I can find a way to escape. I’m not going to build him bombs.”
“Hawkeye, stay up here and start picking people off. Sam, recon and report. Wanda, get us down then the three of us will work our way down 49th, reconvene once this street is clear and we start on the next. “
He pointed to the left. “That way. She’s close.”
“So?” She asked eagerly. Steve crossed his arm and leaned back into the sofa.
“Obie!” Tony yelled, and the office door open.
The comms were quiet for a second, then Tony caved, because he could fight you on anything until the ends of the earth, but was a complete sucker for a please and thank you.
“How are you?” A soft voice asked.
Steve scowled and kicked at a rock. “A couple.”
“What does that mean?” Yinsen asked, as more parachutes started to fall from the sky, all beeping loudly and glaringly bright white, coming down in a straight line leading back to the camp.
Tony noticed that nobody was crying for Steve.
One day I couldn’t take it anymore, and left without ever meeting you. I made it almost all the way. By the end of a month, I was there.
“That was when they thought you were a traitor?”
He pet Dottie some more. “No cloudy thoughts on sunny days”, he told her. She nosed the fence. It stayed solid. She looked at him with utter disappointment. More like 'udder' disappointment, he laughed to himself. Dottie walked off. No one appreciated his puns around here. He packed up the wire and pliers and took them back to the barn. He was making decent progress on his to do list today, despite all the interruptions. He picked up a pitch fork and started tossing the hay and sweeping up the barn. By the time he finished, it was dark outside. He put the pitch fork back where it belonged, and went inside the house to his room. He pulled off his clothes and stepped into the shower. The water was cold. He’d ask Tony to fix the water heater next. He dried off and went downstairs to the kitchen, where Jan was putting together sandwiches while Tony took apart the stove top. Ok, water heater after the stove top.
He decided to do the same thing he had been doing whenever he was in a shitty situation since the age of 14 and call Rhodey. He picked up on the first ring.
When the reached the right street Steve pointed out the direction Tony needed to go, and left to catch a train home. Instead of going into the bar, Tony ducked into an alleyway and called Pepper.
“We all used to work at the castle, that’s why we’re here!”
Tony leaned down in his chair. “Doubt it.”
Steve grimaced. “A youthful mistake.”
“We were able to find a sheltered spot further down the river and ride out the blaze,” the girl explained. “It was smokey but we survived. We’re still looking for Thor. Who’s your friend?”
Steve sat up. “- wait, do you hear that?”
“I am not aware of Sir’s current location.”
Last time I was about to marry you, Pepper came to me and spent the whole night going through evidence that Stane had your pack killed. I confronted him, and he laughed and said he was behind all of it, from the bank to the ring. He said if I breathed a word of it or backed out of the wedding, he’d kill you too. And in that moment I realized I absolutely could not live without you. You’re always there for me, and I know no matter how lost I am, you’ll always be there, standing solid as a tree, reliable as the north star, guiding me home. So I promise you in return, I’m always going to be there for you, in any way I can, as long as we both shall live.”
“Oh, I bet. I saw him helping you out in the woods.” Clint said, wiggling his eyebrows. “You guys didn’t get that far with limpy there and they don’t call me Hawkeye for nothing.”
“But Steveeeee…….”
“It’s too early for eggs,” he mumbled, shoving his head under a pillow. “I want coffee.”
“Jan says you get like this sometimes.”
Rhodey shrugged. “We are free of the overseer’s cruel rein. That is a good thing.”
There was a burst of quiet laughter. “Just relax.”
Clint paused from tossing hay bales to look over at his cousin. Steve threw the bale from the truck with unnecessary force, and one of the strings snapped, sending hay skittering across the dirt in a yellow wave of stalks.
Tony stood up and pushed him away. “What the hell is wrong with you?”
“What if I forget what to say?” Peanut to the forehead.
Steve wasn’t sure what to think.
Howard passed Tony over to her, and left the room. Maria let Tony hide his face against her shoulder, and he tried to ignore the awful sounds coming from the tv, as a tribute beat someone’s head in with a rock, laughing hysterically.
Tony had had the drug they gave Steve before, pretty fun while it lasted but it had a bitch of a drop afterwards. Steve would be fine in a couple hours. Tony did his best to hold him upright. Steve was small, but it wasn’t like Tony was some sort of weight lifter.
Tony pressed kissed to Steve’s neck and collar bones, holding him tight as he tried to lean away to grab the parachute.
“Ok fine, I’ll fill the bigger one with baking powder then use the little one to scoop out the amount I already put in.”
Clint, Bucky and Jan were going to be standing for him as groomsmen. Tony’s side had a tall red headed woman standing in heels that made her even taller, a stout and pale blonde man with a boxer’s nose, and a frowning African American man who held himself like he was career military. It was a weird reminder that Steve didn’t know much about Tony’s past, or his friends in the Stark pack.
“They’re cows! And Dottie is more of a lady than you’ll ever be!”
“Please, try anything you can do,” he begged.
“He’s checking you for a concussion.” Steve said brusquely.
He shook his head. “I don't know. They most likely believe me to be dead. Maybe have gone scouting and failed to return, as Bucky did. They warned me it was foolish before I set out.”
Loki lifted his sword and paced back and forth, gesturing at the burning wreck of the forge and the guards dressed in green cloaks matching along the castle palisades, swords red with blood. He crouched in front of Tony.
“I never stopped loving you.” Steve insisted.
He carefully pressed his palm to his chest next to where he remembered the cut was, and frowned. The skin was hot, far too hot. Infection was setting in. Tony dampened a cloth and laid it on the Captain’s forehead. He had no medicine to treat him, there was nothing he could do beyond cleaning and wrapping the wound. He would have to hope that the Captain would fight it off on his own, and either recover, or wake up long enough to give them the directions. Tony looked at his pale face and desperately hoped that he lived. The Captain had lived such a heroic life, it felt wrong for him to die of infection in a little mining camp in the middle of nowhere because they didn’t have any medicine and Tony wasn't good enough to save him. He took care of him the best he could, and laid down on his own bed, facing towards the Captain. He shut his eyes and was soon asleep, the day's work exhausting him down to his bones.
“Loopy. It’s time to go to sleep, honey.”
Was it weird to daydream about this stuff? Better than what he usually thought about, which was Bucky, and Ma, and how Bucky would never get to have a family of his own, and Ma would never get to meet his kids and spoil them rotten.
Steve felt himself relax a little. The ranch had belonged to his pack for generations, and he had grown up here. Every nook and cranny held a story, most now bittersweet as the people he had made the memories with were now gone. The bushes where he had played hide and seek with Bucky, the porch where he had sat with his Ma as she knit, the fields where the cattle grazed and he'd catch crickets with Clint and Jan. This was his home, and he would do anything to keep it safe.
“I don’t think that’s possible.” Steve said with a laugh.
“You do to have a crush. You’re just too mutton headed to see it. Don’t worry, Clint and I will help you out. You’ll be knocking boots in no time!”
Tony let his head thump back onto the desk, and pressed a shaky hand to his chest. He felt blood welling thick and hot between his fingers.
“Ok. That's nice.”
There was a scratch at the door. Steve dragged the table away and unlocked it. The door open with a small creak and the wolf walked inside, cautious with ears back and belly low to the ground. The wolf’s scent confirmed what Steve already knew.
Though his words were scolding, he seemed almost impressed.
Steve looked at him like he was crazy. “I… ok. Lunch. We can go to Brooklyn Bridge Park and walk around and get hot dogs.”
Thank you all so much for reading! We've finally reached the end.
The Capitol has ruled over the districts from generations, and I’m not going to let you mess it up.”
“He knows not of my past. There is a great hatred in his heart for all the weapons labeled with my name.”
“It stays in their mouths,
“Havok? I like the sound of that,” Natasha said with a feral grin. “Where do we start?”
“Stark Industries still has a few old ties to the military, and my friend Rhodey has some pull too… He’s back the whole week.”
“I don’t want anything to do with your warped ideas of protection.”
The man laughed at that, and Tony couldn’t blame him. Since waking up in the future Steve had decided to roll with the public's perception of him as the all American goody two shoes. Sometimes he pulled it off, his intrinsic desire to do the right thing shining through... other times, stuff like this came out of his mouth.
Steve caught up with the rest of the Avengers as Thor pushed the two criminals on to the jet. They would make a stop at the police station on their way back to the tower, and the NYPD could deal with the details of expediting them to Great Britain for trial. Thor handed Brian the golden orb, and he tucked it away safely in his bag.
“It’s a gift from a sponsor,” Tony said with delight. “What does the note say?”
The next year when the family settled in to watch the games, Tony had stared at the screen, uncomprehending. What were these loud noises? Why were people running and crying? He started to cry too, and tried to hide his face on his mother’s shoulder. Howard pulled him away and forced him to face forward, eyes on the screen as a tribute took an ax and hacked away at the girl in front of him. The first stroke was enough to knock her to the ground, the second cut deep into her stomach. She held up her arms and the next stroke separate her hand from her wrist in a spray of blood.
They all settled at the table and passed around plates of pasta and bowls of bread. They all told stories and laughed happily late into the night. Steve kept his arm over the back of Tony’s chair and they spent most the night shooting each other sappy looks. After dinner they moved to the living room to open gifts.
Steve whined at him. Really? A rug?
“I’m not a doctor, not even for humans, let alone dragons, I’m sorry.”
Tony looked down at the arrow then up at Bruce who gave him a sad smile. “Go on, Tony. Take it. Steve had a point, you could do some good if you made it back. And what do I have to go home to? A life living alone in the local victor’s house, trying to keep my head down to avoid the wrath of the Capital?”
“It’s alright.” Tony slide his hand down from holding Steve’s wrist to holding his hand. He tugged him closer, until his knees hit the bed. “Lay down.”
Tony buried his face in his pillow. “You’re being disgustingly honest for this early in the morning.”
“I found it in the dumpster!” Clint announced loudly, and the dog barked in agreement. Tony put an arm around Steve and hustled him out of the lobby.
Steve stepped back, hands held up non threateningly. Tony went back inside to the little room and collapsed on the bed. Now that he knew what to look for he could feel Liberty and Steve in the back of his mind, faint feelings of annoyance and worry. This was a disaster. The heroes of the Battle of the Keep deserved far better than to be bound to a man like him, who ruined so many lives with his carelessness.
“Rhodey? Pepper?” Sam offered. Steve interjected.
“I knew you were going to win,” Steve said happily. His eyebrows drew together in concern. “Tony? You alright?”
That was unexpected. That sounded too much like a retreat, from the man who always took challenges head on.
Was the cornucopia worth the risk of being caught? The number one cause of death in the arena was the bloodbath that took place on the first day at the starting point. Number two was hypothermia, three was dehydration. Tony scanned the arena and it looked like a normal forest, as much as Tony knew what a forest looked like. He had never left the Capital. Did forests get cold enough to kill? Would there be water?
“I thought it was live?”
Jan smirked, and casually bent over to check the eggs. “Ah, you're going to show Tony the town. I see, I see.”
Tony looked up, blood running into his eyes and clutching his stomach where he had been kicked.
Steve nodded and they walked out back and sat on the porch, just like they had every night for the past ten years, barring the last one. This was surreal, Steve thought as Bucky turned to him, hands clasped.
“I can’t lose you!” Tony yelled, standing up and knocking the chair back with a screech. Sam made a face and backed out the room. Steve didn’t blame him.
The Captain, Steve, heaved out a sigh and let his eyes fall shut.
“I know. Maybe I don’t want you to have to. I can stand to be a little hot. Come here.”
They hesitated and Loki waved them forward. They unchained his hands and Steve lunged to his feet, taking two steps towards Loki with his fists clenched before the guards held him back. Loki stepped forward, drawing a knife out from his belt.
Brian gave him a bitter close mouthed smile. “The Queen didn't want to advertise to any sorcerers that our gates are now wide open. I could be jailed for sharing such information with you, but if I can't trust the Avengers, who can I trust?” He said. “Besides, I couldn’t doubt a face as pretty as yours.”
Above him the wind rustled through the trees in a mournful whisper. A twig snapped and Tony tensed up. He pushed himself up to his knees and elbows then relaxed as he recognized the voice.
“There is no way I'm going!” Steve was horrified by the very suggestion.
“Like I’m not trying? Like I don’t wake up at four or five every morning and work until it’s dark, like I don’t save every penny I can, like I traded away part of my future so the bank could tell me I’m not good enough? Fuck it, if my best isn’t good enough, I’m not even going to try. I’m done. I’m going back to the ranch.”
“From the Stark pack?”
Steve passed over a cherry and a blue raspberry, and grabbed the same for himself. They went up to the cashier who rolled her eyes at two adults buying nothing but ring pops, and dutifully rung them up. They walked out of the store, and as Tony reached for the bag Steve pulled it away. “So which are for eating and which are for marrying?”
Before he could continue Clint walked into the room and promptly tripped over a desk and landed in one of the chairs. “What the… why are there chairs? Did you invent a chair gun? Like a ray gun that turns things into chairs??? That would be pretty cool. Wait, is this a super villain thing? Are you turning into a supervillain? Can I shoot you?” Tony clapped his hands together. “In reverse order, no, no, no, no, no, and because it's my birthday! And as Tony Stark, I'm throwing the party of the century! Music, food, as much alcohol as you can drink!”
“I don’t see what would be hard about it. I’m not asking you to return it.”
“Steve, why don't you go check on the cows while Clint and I help Tony get settled in?” She suggested. Always trying to make peace, make everyone get along. Usually he appreciated it, though it drove him nuts sometimes. Times like, oh, maybe right now, for example.
“You lied to me.”
Tony tried, the pain making it hard. Then it seemed to get farther away, the sharp burn slowly fading into a dull warmth.
He sat back down on the bed, his head hanging low. He felt the bed dip as Tony sat down too. The tension in the room simmered down into dull resentment.
“Sometimes I can't even wrap my head around your levels of cheesiness and team spirit.” He said to Steve as he switched to thermal images and quickly located the only heat signature not registered to his team. Make that two heat signatures. One was the man controlling the birds, the orb he was holding was showing up as colder than the surroundings.
“All the same….” Tony sighed, done with the conversation.
“Oh, you know, just enjoying the small town charm. Did you know they only have one bar? How quaint.”
Steve looked over his shoulder at Bruce who nodded. Steve let go of Tony and turned away, muttering. “Capital scum.”
“No, worse, he complimented me.”
“Anyways, What's wrong with bread? This a reference I'm not getting?”
Now here was some stranger, saying he was caught up in the same sort of thing.
All the same Tony damped a cloth and put it on Steve’s head, and though he rolled his eyes he left it resting on his head. “Mother hen,” he scolded Tony fondly.
Steve walked over from where he had been leaning against the sink and put a hand on his shoulder. “You should have waited for us to get there.”
Tony waved a knife at him threateningly. “I will kill you. I will actually, literally kill you, if you don't read me the recipe.”
Tony threw himself against the glass. “No! No!”
“I’m granting you a boon, Captain. You wanted to kill Lord Anthony Stark? Go right ahead.”
“Well, last night I picked out a room, all on my lonesome. And it was freezing, so I turned on the heat. Half an hour later, my room was even colder than before. So, I went down to the basement and took a look at your radiator. Much like the rest of this godforsaken house, it has been rotting away in neglect for the past fifty years, and as a consequence is a total piece of shit. So I took it apart.”
Above them there was a faint beeping and they all tensed, forming a circle and facing outwards with weapons at the ready.
“Dammit!”
So, yeah, I like you, Tony. I like running with you as a wolf, I like watching the faces you make eating canned ravioli, I like your refusal to be anyone other than yourself, I like how you take bad news as a personal challenge to fix things. I like that I can trust you, and you trust me enough to tell me this stuff. I like you, and Jan and Clint like you too. In a few weeks we’re going to get married, and it’s going to be as ugly as Indries can get away with, and it’s going to be long and I won’t know anybody and will probably spill food on you and we won’t have real rings.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, me too. Obie always told me I trusted people too easily. That I rolled over like a pup for a treat every time someone told me I did a good job. I think he took advantage of it a little to be honest. He only did it because he loves me, though.” he concluded.
Brian's eyes widened at the new information. “May I see the pendant?” He asked, stepping forward. The man, named Raymond, stuttered out an affirmative and opened his safe. He asked them to stay outside, and disappeared within. Seconds later he emerged holding a enormous diamond at the end of a golden chain. Britain closed his eyes and waved his hand over the pendant. When he opened them again his face was full of shock. He turned towards Steve.
Now he was invested in the skinny blond boy from 12. He pulled up the district 12 reaping ceremony. It wasn’t required watching for Capital citizens, so he hadn’t seen it. Nobody ever watch these, they were supposedly boring as hell. He was under the impression that they rounded up all the volunteers then did some sort of random drawing to pick who got the honor of going to the Capital and competing in the games. Tony would never volunteer for something like that, and couldn’t understand why the people from the districts would want to volunteer either. Fame? Fortune? There was a decent prize at the end, both for the contestant and their district. Maybe they just wanted an excuse to kill. Some of them were crazy enough.
Tony ripped off the bottom of his pant leg and held the fabric to Yinsen’s neck, trying to stop the blood. Yinsen grabbed his hand.
“I thought you were-”
Tony looked up from his tablet and Steve’s brain shorted out. There was Tony, right there. His Tony, after all these months, looking like he had just stepped out for a minute to buy more milk, and now he was back and they could pick back up exactly where they left off.
Honestly, screw Tony for this. Either he trusted Steve the whole time and Tony never should have fought him at all, because if he was willing to let Steve shut down the suit he should have been willing to shut it down himself. Had he spent the whole fight at the airport waiting for Steve to shut him down? Then again, at Siberia? Waiting for Steve to make the first move towards deescalation?
“Yup. Heaven forbid we break any of Tony’s precious rules,” Clint complained sourly.
She stomped on his foot.
All eyes turned to him. Steve spoke. “That would be useful it if were true. Then the dragons could burn all who stood against us.”
They were all hanging out in a little room off to the side except for Jan, and the tall woman, Pepper, who were both off somewhere with Tony. Bucky was missing too. They hadn’t seen him since he spent the night a week ago. They waited as the guests filed in and sat down in folding chairs lined up to fill the barn. It wasn’t a real barn, the floor was perfectly clean and fairy lights hung from the eves. He had been horrified at the rehearsal when Tony had explained to him that it was designed to look like a barn, but was only used for themed weddings. Waste of a perfectly good building, if you asked him. All they were doing was signing a paper and having a party, they could do that anywhere. His ma had gotten married out back by the grapevine trellis, and she had been happy enough with that.
“Much safer and warmer to have a partner,” he finally concluded, passing the ball off to Steve to see if he could do any better. Why was this so hard? He found himself stumbling over his words, his mind blank of any thoughts beyond wondering when Steve was going to kiss him again.
Stane hummed low in his throat, a speculative sound. “Normally it’s a pain. This time it worked out in my favor so I suppose I can’t complain. I’ve got you right back where I want you. Hard to believe that I once considered you my successor. That’s a pretty little mask you put on for the rest of the world, you had me fooled. What is it your father was always nattering on about? Stark men are made of iron? It works from a distance.” Stane got up and walked around the desk, grabbing Tony by the chin and forcing his head up to meet his eyes. “Tony Stark, the child prodigy, the boy running circles around everyone else, always faster, smarter, better, hiding behind an armor of of jokes and jabs. And underneath it all? A lonely child, a desperate one. All it took was a stranger offering you the tiniest bit of affection and now here we are; in a horrible mess. Neither of us wanted things to turn out like this.”
Tony snorted. He knew he had helmet hair, but he’d take the complement.
Dottie mooed.
“The districts and the Capitol.” Steve handed him a cup of coffee and sat down in the chair next to him. “The people of the Capitol think you’re one of them, and the people of the districts think you’re one of us. And after the Games there’s not a person in Pandora who doesn’t know who you are, so you’ve got the name recognition. You could win.”
Natasha remained seated at the table. “Tony won’t like that.”
“We’re engaged.” Steve said proudly, shooting Tony a loving look, which he returned.
“No," Tony mumbled.
“If it’s an account with one picture of me in front of the jet, then it’s me. And I’m keeping it.”
Everyone at the table froze.
“He’s going home tomorrow, and I’m not going to stop him.”
“To second chances and fresh starts!”
“Of course my boy, my pack has always had a long history with yours. Wouldn't want to disappoint old friends, even if said old friends are no longer around. My condolences. To lose so many so quickly….” He stared off into space, as if pondering the abstract cruelty of the universe. Steve gritted his teeth in something that could have been a smile.
“My sister is dead. She was reaped last year.”
“I know.”
“I’m Tony, you’re Steve, and I just broke a time loop.”
“Look. Let’s start over. You stop mentioning things I won’t understand, and I’ll stop assuming you’re making fun of me when you do make a reference. We both don’t want to fight, so let’s just talk about something else.”
“He’s probably just sleeping in, Cap. Where have you looked?” Natasha asked calmly.
“Um,” Steve said.
“There are many advantages to being dragon bonded.”
“I don't think he's gaining anything, so much as getting rid of a problem.” He looked out the window as a short man with wild brown hair marched up to the pickup, slammed his hand against the window, and started yelling obscenities at him.
“I am fine, give me a moment.”
“You and Tony have another fight?” he guessed, trying to figure out why he was on the floor. Steve shook his head sadly.
“No, no, no,” Tony whispered, still holding the blood drenched cloth to the cut. A canon boomed over head and he let his hand and the cloth drop. It was no use; Yinsen was dead. He bowed his head in grief and took a shuddering breath.
As Tony had been spending more time with Steve, he had been spending more time with the team by proxy. They had grown close, and Natasha and Clint hadn’t hesitated to abandon the mission to check on their team mate.
There, see, he was horribly cocky and self inflated and all those other spoiled brat things. No regrets at all. He grabbed one of his bags, and walked with him outside. It was time for him to go, so he could get things back to normal, and figure out some new plan for dealing with the bank. Clint and Jan were standing by the truck, arguing.
