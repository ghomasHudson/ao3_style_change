Tony slides into Steve again, fighting against the serum every inch of the way. He fucks into Steve, slow and quiet, and it does feel less tight.
Steve isn’t far enough from Tony and the man for his enhanced hearing not to pick up their conversation, and he really wishes he had some way to stop himself, but super self-control wasn’t included in the serum.
He wants to go looking for Tony, but doesn’t want to seem clingy. In a while, if Tony isn’t back, he’ll call him or try to find him.
“I love this place,” he tells Steve. “Almost all my ties, I get them from here. Handmade, one by one. This is top quality artisanal craftsmanship, Cap.”
Steve touches Tony’s face. They separate, just a tad, just to look at each other better, but Tony still struggles to keep his eyes open, and Steve is still fighting his Alpha instinct of kissing his Omega stupid. Tony would really like to be kissed.
He surprises himself thinking that he likes the way his body looks now. He’s lean and sinewy, slender. He used to be bulkier a few years ago, but he prefers himself this way. Maybe it’s because this means that there’s less of him, but he wants to think that it’s because he looks more like he did when he was young, when he first became Iron Man.
“Fuck you, Steve, shut the fuck—I’m not gonna steal him from you! I’m bonded! Look!” He grabs the collar of his henley to show him Natasha’s bite. It’s higher than usual, almost on the curve of his neck, to avoid the scar where the metal arm is connected to his body. But while Tony notices, Steve seems to barely look at him, and he growls again to keep Bucky away. “I’m married! I’m just trying to… Have you lost your fucking mind!”
. Tony moves his head, opens his mouth, and swallows Steve’s fingers, tasting himself on them and Steve underneath it all and he wonders how has he lived without this for ten years?
Tony still doesn’t get a full erection, but they get to this point faster than they did at first, which is a very good sign in Steve’s book. After a while Tony would come, sometimes on his stomach, or in Steve’s mouth, or on Steve’s hand. Once, on Steve’s face—it was
“Steve,” he sighs, right before he’s about to come, and then Steve does something that Tony really didn’t expect.
On May 29th, 1970, after many years of failed attempts, Maria gave birth to a child, Anthony Edward Stark.
Steve blushes even more when he sees Tony, and quickly stumbles to his side of the room to get dressed.
Someone wanted to steal Howard’s super soldier serum, and Maria, if left alive, would have been an inconvenient witness. So that someone decided to take Tony’s mom away from him. She wasn’t allowed to keep existing.
. Steve asks JARVIS if he can access Tony’s penthouse while Tony is in R&D, and leaves a yellow rose on his pillow.
His hand, the hand that was inside Tony’s mouth just a minute ago, makes its way between Steve’s thighs, past his balls, and Tony watches him slide a finger into himself, just the tip.
Tony feels like he’s about to cry again, but he presses his lips together until the feeling goes away, and then looks into Steve’s eyes, nods, and Steve hugs him close, cradling the back of his head with one hand, and maybe it’s only Steve’s incredible strength, but Tony feels weightless for the first time in his life.
The first time Tony puts his fingers inside of Steve, Steve sees stars. When he gets to reciprocate, Tony’s eyes are squeezed shut and he’s gritting his teeth, he trembles and shakes for minutes after coming. Steve offers to hold him through it, but Tony doesn’t really want to be touched.
He balances himself on his tiptoes, cradles Steve’s face in his free hand, and kisses him on the cheek. Steve keeps his eyes closed the whole time Tony’s lips are on his skin.
Tony grits his teeth, seems to think Steve’s little speech over, and in the end he nods, which is more than Steve expected.
Steve shoves Tony’s pants down just enough to push into him, and he begins to fuck Tony in hard thrusts made harsher by the slow and punishing rhythm he sets to inflict them. It’s like being punched, and every time Steve pounds into him Tony feels it reach so fucking deep into his body, he feels every thrust in the back of his damn throat. It’s amazing.
Steve comes, and Tony can barely feel it. The knot stretches him and his dick twinges, but he doesn’t get anywhere near even half-hard.
Or maybe, Tony thinks while he looks at the endless vastness of space stretching in front of him, maybe they won’t have to make any announcement at all.
It’s a Saturday morning. Steve wakes up with his arm still asleep because Tony’s head is resting on top of it. He tries to extricate himself as quietly as possible, but Tony stirs, sighs, yawns, and in the end opens his eyes.
They have lunch at a little restaurant tucked in a small alley. Tony orders pici cacio e pepe for them both, which Steve thinks are just thick spaghetti, but they taste different. They’re cheesy and there’s a lot of pepper in them. It kinda goes up Steve’s nose at some point, which makes Steve sneeze and Tony laugh.
“Here, take these,” Tony calls as he leans down to drop a few cherries in Steve’s cupped hands. When Steve’s hands are full Tony climbs down the tree, jumping to cover the last few feet.
“I remember what you like,” Steve replies, sounding a little more like himself, but his speech is still slurred. “Been thinkin’ ‘bout it for ten years.”
“The letter is from my mom. The last she wrote to Stella. Two days before her death. I guess she didn’t have time to mail it, maybe Jarvis forgot to do it, with the funeral and everything.” He pauses, touches his chest. “The necklace was my mom’s. It was one of her favourites; she’d wear it all the time. She had tons of jewels, infinitely more pricey, and yet she always... So I thought maybe it was something personal for her. Something that has to do with Stella, maybe, and their relationship.”
He comes to terms with it in an unplanned moment of mercy for himself: he’s spent more time with Tony than he ever spent with Peggy, he knows him more intimately than he ever had the chance to know her. He wanted to be inside her just as much as he wants to be inside Tony now; he dreamed about doing to her the same things he wants to do to Tony now, even though back then he’d blush at these thoughts, because it was unbecoming of a nice fella like him to think such things about his girl. He wouldn’t have those qualms now, he sure doesn’t have them for Tony. He knows Peggy wanted him just as bad, he knows Tony would too, if not for Steve’s betrayal. He knows Tony did want him, that night.
They eat in silence after that, and drink the water Tony bought. The trees shield them from the sun, but the air is hot and still.
“Tony, hey,” he whispers, but Tony doesn’t react at all, he just looks far away, at the hills, at the impending storm.
He knows that nothing he touches here, now, can connect him to Mom. He knows this is not the same water, he knows the rocks have been scrubbed clean of any trace of Maria over the years.
“Oh, damn,” Stella says, “I better start making some food or we’ll just stare at each other for dinner.”
“Oh, wow. I’ll call the Pope in the morning. Ask if he can canonize you while you’re still alive.” He pauses. “Actually, no, the Pope’s awful, I don’t wanna talk to him.”
“Take it,” he says, “Yeah, just like that. Take it,” and it does the trick because Tony moves up his length, and everything of Steve is lost inside him.
They’re distracted for such a small amount of time, but it’s enough for the man to rip a metal leg from a piece of furniture bolted to the floor and throw it at Steve’s head.
Tony must fall asleep at some point, because he wakes up in bed some time later, still dressed. His clothes are clinging to him again; it’s so hot in the bedroom. Steve forgot to open the French window.
He adores Maria. He plays with her, talks to her, learns how to feed her. Tony teaches him how to change her diaper and how to clean her up properly. Steve is scared at first, especially when Tony tells him he has to hold her still to dress her.
He passed out at some point, thank god, and he came to about twenty minutes ago with still a bit of consciousness to spare. That’s gonna change soon, he knows. It’s creeping up on him—slow but steady.
Steve swallows, and it changes the tone of his voice. “We should’ve maybe… talked about it first. It felt right and I went with it but—”
Tony starts moving, fucking himself so deliciously on Steve’s cock, with little teasing thrusts that drive Steve out of his mind. Steve’s balls draw in; his thighs shake.
“Don’t you dare say that he’s jealous Rogers” Tony may look wrecked, but he was using his media voice which broke Steve’s heart a little.
His face drained of life as he remembers what happened once he woke up, he snapped at Tony to go away and said he didn’t want him there. He said that Tony should focus on doing his job better so that the rest of the team wouldn’t get hurt.
Pepper settles gracefully against the soft satin backing and Steve follows with the grace of a new born deer, all limbs and jerky movements but she ignores that thankfully. Her lips are painted a delicate nude and her hair swept up into a graceful bun that isn’t quite unlike the style his mother would wear when going to work as a nurse, its practical and beautiful just like Pepper herself.
Steve laughed with joy and took Tony’s hand, setting both of them on his neck as he looped his arms around Tony’s curvy hips. They swayed to the song they danced to all those months ago and the lyrics still ring true, both of them laughing and smiling at each other, refusing to be more than a few steps apart because they are officially in the honeymoon stage.
“How you need to keep the bedside lamp on unless you’re sleeping with someone because you never want to be in the dark alone, how you hate the cold weather but can bear it as long as you get hot cocoa with whipped cream and only pink marshmallows as soon as you walk through the door.” Tony lets out another laugh as he reaches up to pat Steve’s cheek and it is only then that eh realises he is chewing on the inside of his cheek deep in thought. “You always do that when you’re thinking hard and your forehead creases up” He goes up on his tip toes and pecks Steve’s forehead gently, smoothening it out immediately as the tension leaves Steve’s body.
not to mess us up, yet I ended up doing it anyway.” The hole in Steve’s heart threatened to swallow him whole as he couldn’t bring himself to stare back into the broken eyes desperately trying to search for answers within his own shattered ones. Steve merely focused on one spot on the floor as Tony kept looking at him imploringly, knowing that he was only pushing the man away as he was baring his soul out in front of him.
“People around me don’t love me they just tolerate or use me. I am only good for providing and doing shit for people” Tony kicked a stray plant pot beside his feet making Steve jump, “You couldn’t even stomach looking at me until now!” Steve’s eyes glossed over as tears fell, wanting nothing more than to wrap the broken man in front of him into his arms and make this all better but how could he? He did this. He contributed towards Tony feeling like this.
of your parents but imagine how surprised I was to see that there is no mention of Howard in sight? Then again your daddy dearest did always say you were a complete disappointment so of course you didn’t even think of throwing a Gala in his honour in case you fucked it up like you fuck up every relationship you have. Perhaps death was a better option for him and your mother instead of dealing with you.”
to me right now. How long?” Tony’s voice was fierce, but his jaw was tight, and his eyes were holding an unknown glimmer.
and takes his coffee, mixing in two spoons of what he thought was sugar and taking a single sip only to spit it out again immediately.
I have never finished a story in my life and I know to some 6 chapters might not seem like a lot but I am so proud of myself for finishing this and sticking through with Steve and Tony's story until the end. I'm also extremely grateful for everyone who has stuck with this story despite lack of updates and not knowing when it would finish but here you are! It is extra long too because I had so much to fit in and couldn't leave it out so I hope you're feeling blessed haha!
“I understand that you have your own reasons involving the Avengers to do this and whilst your ability to be professional is admirable I want to make it clear to you Steven that if you cause any trouble at this Gala you are not only ruining the Avengers reputation but Tony’s.” She shifts to cross her legs, the pointy stilettos on her feet looking more threatening than alluring, as if she could stand on him and crush his windpipe with just one step. Yes he is very afraid of Virginia Potts.” If you do anything to damage his reputation because of the childish hate and blatant disrespect you have against him then you will regret it because if Tony Stark goes down then so do the Avengers as contrary to popular belief you aren’t the backbone of the team, he is. So please, behave yourself and don’t make matters difficult for me or Stark Industries by being an insufferable ass okay?”
Tony looks weary when he lifts his head and his mouth is set in a firm line, his usual smirk nowhere to be seen as he swivels his bar stool around, his feet barely skimming the floor as he faces Steve. This already sounds serious and he somehow already knows that he won’t like this.
Tony looked up at Steve with red blotchy cheeks and an almost child like innocence to him as he whimpered hopefully.
just because you refuse to admit you could love me?”  Tony’s words were like bullets piercing his skin because of course he was right. Steve didn’t have the fucking guts to tell the man he loves that he doesn’t need to fear being alone or not being loved because Steve is right here and will love him for the rest of his days.
“Tony, by everything I don’t just mean money and materialistic things. You have more than money could ever buy! You have the determination of a lion as Iron Man and as Tony Stark, you have lived through unimaginable situations yet have still found a way to thrive despite that. You have a heart of gold that is always ready to help others, the Avengers included as you didn’t need to give us a place to live but you selflessly did so. You have a family and people who love you more than you could ever know- “.
He fell to his knees and sobbed into his hands as Steve stood there frozen. His mind processing all that Tony had just said when the man let out a broken whisper.
Tony’s legs buckled from exhaustion but before he could hit the ground Steve grabbed him, lifting him off the ground and against his chest where Tony’s ear was pressed against his racing heart. His own tears were streaming down his face as Tony sobbed against his chest, gripping onto his shirt so tight that the seams were stretching but Steve didn’t care. God he was such a jackass to this beautiful man who never deserved it.
The amount of horrific situations running through Steve’s mind were enough to drive him crazy once the adrenalin had ran out. Running away and hiding when he was upset was Tony’s superpower, but Steve had found him plenty of time, he could find him again if he just fucking focused and stopped freaking out.
Steve’s throat closes up with emotion as those same eyes fill with tears and Tony smiles sadly at him. Tony loves him? Tony paid attention to all of these little quirks and things about Steve even when he didn’t have to? He remembers always having a cup of hot cocoa ready when he got in from a run on Winter mornings and sipping it gratefully as the smell of engine grease hung around the air. His room being slightly lighter than usual, he thought this was the default setting until he visited Natasha during the night and her rooms were pitch black. How Tony always pulled Steve’s head onto his chest when they were watching a movie and when Steve did fall asleep he laid there with him and kept holding him tight.
Tony frowned and tilted his head curiously, worry swirling around the melted chocolate of his eyes as a small v formed in the centre of his forehead. Oh how Steve wished he could place a kiss on it and make it go away.
“You don’t get it do you, Steven?” Apparently yes he is taking the wrong approach and they’re on first names now? Oh boy he is screwed. He can still fix this though he’s America’s golden boy, a feisty CEO isn’t going to wear him down.
Steve wasn’t alone for too long though as the elevator doors slid open with a cheerful chirp from Jarvis and out stepped Pepper and Tony. Pepper was wearing a cream gown with a plunging back and some expensive looking jewellery, to be perfectly honest he couldn’t bring himself to focus on the details because he was utterly
“Well I have missed you Stark, with all of your wit and loving comments” Thor’s smile towards Tony was gentle and full of affection, he clearly cared about him a lot, if it weren’t for the fact that Steve knew Thor was head over heels for Jane a familiar feeling of envy would overtake his senses.
“And then when I finally thought I was doing something right you left me too and the worst thing?” Tony looked up at him with bloodshot eyes and said the next words with so much pain that a bullet through the heart would have hurt less, “the worst thing was not knowing what I did to repulse you and make you run away from me. But I really must be that bad if America’s golden boy Captain
Tony’s warm hand was suddenly on his knee and he looked over to the shorter man, his own eyes probably exuding fear as Tony’s showed concern. The latter gave him a sweet smile as he tilted his head in a curious manner, not bringing any attention to Steve but still wanting to see if he was okay.
The God in question leaned back as he looked directly to where Steve was looking before, following Tony and Pepper with his eyes as Tony kept glancing over at them and let his eyes linger on Steve whilst he remained clueless and Thor chuckled at the idiocy of his friends.
Tony was the first person out of the Avengers that he truly became close to, the only one who understood his grief and understood why Steve acted the way he did. Meeting him was good for Steve and perhaps it became too good, perhaps they became too close and perhaps he became too attached because when it came to their first battle the pair sadly fell apart.
Romanoff stops sharpening her forty knives, why she needs forty he will never know, and gives him a bewildered look as though he’s grown another head which honestly he probably has or is at least going crazy. Looking over at his right Barton is frozen with a spoonful of Cheerio’s dripping into the bowl below, okay that reaction is a tad bit dramatic and honestly Barton had no one ever taught you to close your mouth when you’re eating?
They can hear music from the Gala on the roof and Steve pulls back and quirks his brow when the familiar instrumental starts up and tilts his head down at Tony. “Did you have something to do with this?”
Tony just looks shocked but not in a bad way. He looks shocked that Steve would ever agree to help him and agree to something so quickly but then again it’s not just for Tony it is for the Avengers as a whole and unlike Barton and Romanoff he can put his childish hatred aside for the greater good sometimes. Tony’s shoulders relax from where they were previously tensed up and he lets out a shuddered breath, a small grin on his lips as he lifts his head to look into Steve’s eyes, the brown vulnerable orbs relaying gratitude over to his simple sea blue. Steve tilts his head as a silent
“Miss Potts whilst I have great respect for you and your stature I think your thoughts of me are false because I don’t have a habit of moving out of line when on duty I assure you of that fact.”
“I always knew you were a pathetic low-life, but I thought even you had some sense of decorum and wouldn’t insult the dead, it looks like even a complete disappointment can continue to disappoint.” Steve pulled Hammer’s head back from his hair and relished in the howl of pain he released. “If you ever, and I mean
After that moment it was as though they were attached at the hip, wherever Tony was that was where you would find Steve and it was the true the other way round as well. Tony helped Steve find the beauty of New York again and Steve gave Tony a reason to keep his cool and not ruin his life.
I also have a Marvel Stan Twitter! It is @imarevenger so hit me up there for any questions or excited rambling or to just read my silly tweets!
His heart sinks in his chest and he looks down at his grey sweatpants, gulping audibly as images of Tony laying in a too big hospital bed weak and alone plague his mind, his stomach turning when he realises that Tony had immediately asked about Steve as soon as he came back. Steve should have noticed how his eyes looked sunken in to his face and he was using two hands to hold his coffee mug, but he was too busy complaining about the fact that his shoulder was still bothering him that he didn’t notice. God no wonder Pepper hates him.
“I told you the third night you were in the hospital with your broken shoulder and ribs I –“ he swallowed as his jaw clenched at the memory. “I was so close to losing you and it terrified me that you had gotten hurt so when you were sleeping I took your hand and told you. You didn’t hear me but I prayed to whatever is out there to give you back to me because I love you more than I could ever love someone and I couldn’t lose you. I couldn’t lose someone I would rather die than live without. Then your heart started beating faster and the doctors came in saying you were waking up.”
“I’ve loved you for so long that I don’t think I can remember when it actually happened. I don’t know when simply enjoying your company became wanting to come back home to you, when every little thing you did from wiggling your nose every time your ice cream is too cold to falling asleep during every movie we watched.” Tony shrugs again as he lets out a laugh, his eyes dazed in a memory and then looks down to his feet. “How you mean business as soon as the alarm sounds, how you can’t walk down the street without petting every single dog that walks past you, how you sketch everything you find beautiful and capture the essence of it perfectly.”
Steve frowns and drops his hand from Tony’s cheek, taking a step back as he says “But he is, Tony. You have everything.”
As soon as the words left his mouth he slapped a palm over it, shocked that he finally confessed the emotions that had been festering up inside of him since he met the bubbly genius. Tony looked up at Steve with the fragility of a broken porcelain doll yet the anger of a lion as he full on screamed now.
He thinks but his question gets answered sooner than later as Pepper invites him to sit down on the chaise lounge she was sat on previously.
I am planning on finishing it pretty soon I have chapter 5 written and a little bit of chapter 6 so I just need to finish that and we are smooth sailing with my first multi-chapter completed fic!
“Oh indeed. Tony refused to shift from your bedside even when were being an absolute prick to him. He demanded that his Stark Industries work be sent to him, refused to take any calls in case he disturbed you and was the calmest and most patient version of himself I have ever seen when dealing with you even though to be quite frank you didn’t deserve a second glance.”
That brings him to the one person he trusts the least in the team, Anthony Edward Stark. Admittedly when he first came out of the ice he was happy to have a link to his beloved friend Howard through his son but apparently the apple can fall far from the tree because they couldn’t be more different. Where Howard was professional and courteous towards others his son is sarcastic, flirtatious and oozes suave in a way that just strikes Steve as fake. But that isn’t his biggest concern when it comes to Stark surprisingly, his biggest concern is the fact that even with a cheeky grin on his lips he can’t shut out the vulnerability that lingers in those eyes. It only stays for a moment before his eyes glass over and become steely and bright in such a way that makes Steve sad. Tony is hiding pain so great that it tears him up inside every day and that is enough to make him a liability. You never take a suicidal soldier to war.
The cold air reminded Steve of when he would sit on the roof of his building with Bucky and they would spend hours stargazing and just talking about how they hoped to live long enough to enjoy their lives. Those days all they really wished for was survival and to settle down but now that Steve was finally able to do everything he and Bucky dreamed of he faltered. Tony was the only person he was attracted to after Peggy and he was off the market, he hadn’t built any close bonds with his teammates, so he had no friends either and he went home to a lonely floor every day. Is this really what he wants from this life?
“Glad that the two of you could finally join us” Pepper gave Tony a look that Steve couldn’t quite understand as she said this, and Tony just grumbled as they all entered the decadent hall which was prepared for the Gala. Steve felt positively overwhelmed as he was met with the sheer splendour of the room, from the luxurious burgundy carpet to the ancient paintings of cherubs gracing the ceiling it was all breath taking. He continued to scan the room until he saw a photograph on the stage under a large banner which read ‘The Maria Stark Foundation’.
With a sigh he lifted his glass of whiskey to his lips and sipped on it, watching Tony and Pepper laugh on the dance floor as he spun her around in a waltz.
So he’s in a team with a bunch of idiots who he can’t trust whilst they all need to save Earth over and over again. Perfect.
“Pardon my language but that’s a load of bullshit” Pepper sits up straight and ready to attack with her fierce gaze alone and suddenly Steve wishes he wasn’t on the other side of that look. Paired with her outburst he just knows that she has a bone to pick with him even though he hasn’t done anything, he hasn’t right?
A sleek black limo was parked outside with the driver opening the door as they approached the waiting vehicle, the group quickly piling inside as the chilly bite of the December air wasn’t bearable in the clothes they were wearing. As they settled into the warm seats Steve zoned out completely whilst the others laughed about that time DUM-E sprayed Thor with a fire extinguisher when he was trying to shack up with Jane in the workshop.
She lifts up her Stark Pad from beside her and walks out of the glass doors of the room, leaving Steve alone with his thoughts and crippling guilt as he sets his head on his hands and runs his hands through his hair in frustration. If Sarah Rogers or James Buchanan Barnes were alive they would have his head for the way he has been acting.
has something against all of those involved. If he had to choose a group of people to build a professional relationship with and trust them with his life it sure as hell wouldn’t be these bat shit crazy individuals. As Stark had so eloquently put it “Fury, do you think this is the breakfast club? Because I refuse to make out with Rogers” and although at the time he did not understand that reference, nor was able to hide his blush at the thought of talking about two men kissing and him being one of those men, he did agree with Stark after watching the movie. Fury couldn’t expect them to band together and protect each other with everything they had because they were so unbelievably different.
Tony walked past Steve in order to get away. but Steve grabbed onto the sleeve of his suit jacket and let out a hoarse whisper.
“I’m so sorry Tony, I’m so unbelievably sorry that the dickhead ruined today for you.” Steve squeezed the man’s shoulder and moved forward so that he could see his face, steps faltering as he saw Tony’s red tear stained face. Tony rarely cried, especially out in public, so what Hammer said must be hitting him hard.
Tony moved his hand from Steve’s arm and shook his head forlornly as a few tears fell, turning to face the New York skyline. “Sorry, I guess I’ve just been so used to looking for scraps of love from people that your outburst hit a little too close to the ‘has never been loved’ nerve.” He laughs humourlessly and Steve can tell that the underlying sobs are present under Tony’s harsh breathing. The man is broken and this is just another reminder of how he deserves better than Steve.
A hand reaches out and grabs Steve’s tightly before yanking him back to see fiery brown eyes, the face he is so used to adoring set in a scowl. Oh shit.
Steve felt ashen as he took in the information, shaking his head as his mouth went into overdrive and just let out rambles.
“I refuse to dress up and look like a trophy agent just to keep SHIELD happy! I have better shit to do than pretend to enjoy myself at one of your Galas, Tony” Romanoff spat out venomously as she sat cross legged on the maroon sofa, sharpening her knives suspiciously quick. Well he knows who he isn’t sitting next to then.
They arrived at their destination swiftly and they could already hear the clambering of the hive of reporters outside the venue, it was a Stark Industries event after all of course it would generate some buzz. One by one they got out of the limo and were promptly blinded by flashes, Thor grabbed Jane’s hand to ground her as the flashes spooked her and Pepper walked ahead to meet a few people standing at the entrance of the hall leaving Tony to walk along and give a few comments to the reporters for their articles. Steve followed his movements with his eyes, just to be on the safe side of course, then plastered on a fake smile as he got a few pictures taken of himself and answered a few questions about the Avengers.
“That proves that you were trying your absolute hardest to avoid me doesn’t it? Because the first person I looked for after it was
“Then why did you give up on me?” Tony replied in a voice that resembled an abandoned child and Steve winced as the words hit him hard. How could he tell the truth? How could he tell Tony that he loved him without, well, telling him that he
“Tony let me know that it will be you and Mr Odinson who will be accompanying him to the Gala is that true?” to any ordinary person it would sound like a confirmation but to Steve he could read the surprise in between her words and then saw it in the widening of her eyes when he nodded to confirm. “Well as happy as I am for Tony to have support during one of the hardest days in the calendar year I’m sure you understand when I say that Captain Rogers I do not trust you not to mess this up for him.”
I just want I just want to say thank you for the kudos and comments they mean a lot! My Twitter is @imarevenger if you have any questions or if you just want to read my silly tweets.
As more rockets and fireworks shot up into the sky the pair leaned in and shared what would be the first of many many kisses. Steve still had a lot of grovelling to do and you can bet your lucky stars that Tony would make it difficult, but the former would do anything because Tony was worth it. For now they stood in their perfect love bubble with two special stars going by the names Sarah and Maria looked down at them from heaven and blessed the couple with happiness that would last forever. And you know what they say about blessings from Angels, they are always heard.
As soon as he lifted the refreshed glass to his lips he felt a heavy hand pat his shoulder and turned to see Thor looking at him with amusement dancing in his eyes. He settled against the bar beside Steve and ordered himself a drink as he kept looking at Steve as if he knew something that Steve didn’t.
If he knew that he would be getting prod with needles and shouted at by a feisty Italian for moving too much he never would have agreed, not in a million years. But unfortunately Steve doesn’t have the ability to see into the future, like Thor’s friend Heimdall, so he’s stuck listening to a rapid speaking Italian scolding him and choosing a fabric that will apparently ‘bring out the colour of his eyes’ or whatever that means. Tony has already been fitted for his custom suit apparently, so Pepper is overseeing his fitting and making sure everything is up to Stark Industries standards which are surprisingly high for a company whose boss once mixed coffee with kale in order to get the caffeine and the nutrients (it was revolting, Tony isn’t allowed near the smoothie machine ever again) but then again Starks know how to command respect, Howard always did. Tony is much like him in that aspect.
“Dear friend, I am merely telling you to open your eyes and see what is in front of you. Your happiness may be closer than you think.” Thor lifted his glass to his lips with a twinkle in his eyes and Steve would ask him to embellish but Jane came up to Thor and excitedly dragged him away to meet someone she knows so Steve decided to question the puzzling man later. Honestly, a conversation with Thor was like playing Blues Clues.
Tony’s favourite place was the rooftop of his Tower. Whenever he was upset or angry he went up to the rooftop because it reminded him that he could get through whatever was bothering him. He wouldn’t be able to go to his own Tower right now, so he would be…on this building’s roof!
I have loads of ideas for these two but not with this story, this might become a series? I love irondad and superfamily so I really want to incorporate Peter into my idea of Steve and Tony so that might be next!
“Plus we couldn’t miss a chance to support you today, Tony” Jane smiled softly and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear “Friends support friends”. Steve met Pepper’s eyes when he heard that, knowing that the sharp look in her eyes was there to taunt him
Okay so I have finally realised that with writing you cannot force yourself to finish something by putting a deadline on it so I can't promise when the last chapter will come but when it does I'm sure it will be worth the wait.
He just oozed luxury and beauty, Steve felt like Icarus flying too close to the sun as he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Tony until he could hear the others exchanging pleasantries.
Steve inhales a deep breath as he rubs his hand over his face pondering over this current dilemma. He could easily just say no; the option is right there and Stark probably wouldn’t blame him either because out of everyone their relationship is the rockiest. But maybe that’s exactly why he
“You’re not exactly my biggest fan after New York are you, Cap? Plus you just point blank denied having feelings for me so what was I supposed to do? Get shot down earlier?”
Tony bit his lower lip and nodded before holding out his hand with a cheeky grin. “I think you owe your boyfriend a dance.”
Steve then had only one coherent thought as he ran out of the hall as fast as his legs could take him, his mind screaming at him as he looked around he numerous faces frantically yet couldn’t see the one he was desperately looking for. His heart was beating like a drum and the blood rushed to his head as he span around, gripping his hair in both hands in a frenzy.
Of course they danced to their signature song at every opportunity and every single time they make sure to say that they don’t dance, country might not be every person’s cup of tea but I can tell you this, at their wedding there wasn’t a single person who didn’t shed a tear.
He has to cough to hide his amazement at the fact that Pepper thinks he will mess this up over the guy who throws wine glasses onto the ground as a way to ask for another. Steve will be the source of Tony’s problems? Please. If there’s anything that Steve can be its professional.
time. Tony always found it difficult around this time of year and Steve intimately knew how much he struggled with the loss of his mother. A solemn look befell his face as he reminisced that sad night when Tony confided in him.
Steve stood in absolute shock as memories of that dance swirled around in his head and Tony’s defeated eyes stared right into his. He cleared his throat and whispered out.
think of anyone but yourself. Yet everyone should drop whatever they’re doing to care for you even though in my opinion you haven’t done much to be worthy of so much affection not when you have the cheek to look down on someone like Tony Stark who has taken all of you in and thinks of you as family.”
Tony pulled his hands out of Steve’s as he rubbed his arms in comfort more than just a way to conserve warmth, shaking his head in disbelief as though he couldn’t possibly believe that he just said and honestly, Steve couldn’t quite believe it himself.
“Tony don’t say that! You will feel romantic love and when you do you’ll realise just how wrong you are. That person will love you with all of your silly quirks and habits. They will love that look on your face when you’re so deep in thought because it makes a little v on your forehead that looks adorable. They will love your smile because it will never fail to brighten their day and make even the shittiest of days amazing. They will love the way you demand cuddles when watching a movie because ‘it isn’t movie night without cuddles’ which is adorable. They will love how your face lights up when you talk about all of your ideas and things that you are passionate about whether it be a new project or a new Game of Thrones episode. They will love the way your eyes positively gleam when a child is around. They will notice how you visit a children’s ward in the hospital at least every month just to make them smile and they will fucking love it. They will notice how you don’t truly function until your coffee in the morning and are snappy but will love it nonetheless because you snap at them with sleep mussed hair and sweater paws. They will notice how you can’t get into a pool until it is heated due to Afghanistan flashbacks and they will notice that you need to be held extra tight after a panic attack in order to be grounded but they will love you even more because of that since they’ll know that you got through something so traumatic on your own. They will notice how you can’t cook for shit but are still adamant to so they will eat everything you make even if it means they will be sat on the toilet for the next four days because they love you. They will notice how your eyes turn misty when you hear an old song and when that look is on your face you just want to dance because even if you say, ‘I don’t dance’? You’re a sucker for it and they will love that. They will love you so much that the past heartache will fade away and when they put a ring on your finger and you both have sweet children that you adore they will love you even more because you make their life complete.”
Completely unrelated note but I booked my tickets to see Spiderman Far From Home on the 2nd of July and I am so unbelievably excited!!! Are you guys going to see it? I hope it is amazing as the trailers show it to be!
“I just wanted to hug you and kiss you and look after you but you were so m…mean and it hurt so much Steve.”
“Ever since we sat in your office and you called me your family, I really do love you Tony and I would be the luckiest man alive if you gave me an opportunity to prove that to you every day for the rest of our lives.”
So that’s when Steve explains it to him, the whole thing with the articles and the— the dick gym or whatever. And it’s honestly kind of touching? Steve doing this thing for him, worrying about his health, putting up with him and his decrepit body and trying to keep him in shape, as much as possible, trying to make Tony’s dick behave like it did ten years ago so they can fuck like normal people and Steve can get
“Alright, enough with this nonsense!” Stella says, laughing. She points to a plastic bowl on the table. “Tony, be a dear and go out in the orchard, pick out some fruit.”
But it’s no use to think about that now. What happened, happened, and now the man that made it happen is dead. And Steve is different, he’s completely different, and Tony is, too—he stays hard from start to finish, and his skin is on fire, and he keeps his mind present and sharp, because he doesn’t want to miss a single moment of this. Of the beauty of this.
Steve pushes Tony’s robe down, uncovering his shoulder. He licks the bitemark, slowly, cleaning the dried blood there, and Tony feels soothed in more than one way.
Not that he’s trying to avoid Steve or anything, of course. That would be silly. Their date last week, their first (only?), went well, even though it was Tony who asked Steve out and not the other way around, as tradition commands. But as if that wasn’t enough of a bold move, Tony then decided to be the biggest idiot on the planet and kiss Steve goodbye. Him, a forty-
Steve lifts his eyes to look at Tony, but thinks better of it before he can reach his face. He just stares in front of himself, and his gaze lines up with Tony’s belly.
“Be angry. Be angry as long as you need. I just hope you allow me to... I don’t know. I don’t know where this is taking us, Tony, I just... I just hope you let me hold your hand on the way there.”
Tony pushes Steve up, makes him sit on the couch, takes off his own sweatpants and socks (he is sixty, he’s not gonna start wearing underwear when he’s home
Steve bites into Tony’s lip and makes him yelp and groan. He must break the skin because he tastes blood for a moment. He licks a long strip along Tony’s neck, finishing just behind his ear, biting hard into the lobe just as he feels Tony’s nails digging in the soft skin at the base of Steve’s neck.
Dinner is at a restaurant—an osteria—too close to the bed and breakfast to justify the use of the car to get there. They walk side by side. Tony orders for them both, something called cappelletti in brodo di cappone, and water.
A week later, news breaks out that the fugitive Avengers have signed the amended Accords, and are allowed back on US soil.
Steve inhales sharply when Tony says this. Maybe he can’t stand the fact that Tony thinks about his imminent death as something highly possible, something he needs to start planning ahead for, because it could very well happen. Maybe Steve wants to think about it as something improbable, or far away in the future anyway. Maybe Steve doesn’t want to think about it at all.
Tony’s shoulders sag in defeat while he’s touching his dick as though there’s something wrong with it. There’s blood on his fingers.
Tony closes his eyes, looks like he doesn’t want anything else in the world than Steve using him like this, loving him like this.
“Shut the fuck up, Tony,” Steve says, soft and quiet so it’s not an order, just a reference to Tony’s words from yesterday. “Thank you for staying. I’m glad you did. I’d be very happy if you stayed tonight as well.” He doesn’t have the courage to ask him to stay until he’s healed.
They eat sitting across each other on a stone bench in a semi-desert public park, with the trees shielding them from the sun and the noise of the city. The birds chirp above them and the breeze makes Tony’s curls flutter. A stray ray of sunshine catches on the necklace half-hidden under Tony’s shirt. He slips back into a good mood, and he shifts closer to Steve, but with the movement Tony’s knee touches Steve’s. The pressure sends a spark to the base of Steve’s spine.
Steve smiles, big and bright, and then kisses Tony and fucks him a little harder and he says, “I’m here,” and Tony says, again, “Steve.”
Steve feels his face fall. “Of course it’s for you, Tony. I mean, I’d be lying if I said it’s not fun for me as well, but if you don’t want to do this then just tell me and I can deal with it.”
“Wanna come with me? Take a walk? I’d like to show you something,” Tony says suddenly, in a friendly tone he’s never used in the past few days.
Steve takes off his own t-shirt and caresses Tony’s arms again, from the elbow up to the neck, lingering on his shoulders. He smiles, pure now, and kneels in front of Tony, slow as if they’ve got all the time in the world to dedicate to these kinds of little games. He touches Tony’s stomach and lures a gasp out of him, the sound rippling against the walls of the empty gym, of the night. Steve frames Tony’s hips with his hands, stares at someplace between Tony’s navel and his dick, hard and visible through his pants. He should’ve worn something thicker, he should’ve stayed in his room. He should’ve kept watching Steve from afar knowing that he wasn’t an Alpha to be trifled with.
Tony makes espresso, and they eat together, while Tony reads something on his phone and Steve tries not to think about the way Tony sounds when he reaches his orgasm.
They move to the couch after loading the dishwasher, and Steve zaps through the channels before settling on
“So. I got this email from a certain Sam Wilson. Pretty sure you know the guy. He sent me some very interesting stuff.”
Steve rests his hand on top of one of Tony’s, and that shuts him right up. It hurts to move for Steve, and he clenches his teeth to handle the pain, but in the end it’s worth it if he gets to feel Tony’s warmth through the bandages. A fingertip actually touches skin. And Tony doesn’t flinch away.
“Sometimes I…” Tony starts, wistful, interrupting himself immediately. “Nothing, nevermind,” he finishes, lowering his gaze to the ground and breathing through his open lips.
He’s not really thinking when he pushes his fingers in the cleft of Steve’s ass and finds his rim, massaging it until it loosens up underneath the pressure.
“Someone’s been here! Since the Chitauri. Someone else! And they didn’t want us to notice, they… they hid their weapons! So they’d have an arsenal when they’re back… Who knows how many other bases… I… I need to do something—”
Breakfast in bed after the second time they had sex—the first time in an actual bed—and Tony mocking Steve’s boxer briefs, good-naturedly and lazy, the soft light of dawn shining in his tired but happy eyes, the bond fresh and brilliant in their minds. Steve’s teeth sinking into Tony’s skin. Spending the night talking on the workshop couch and the day sleeping in Steve’s room. Bathing together in the tub, Tony’s belly swollen with Sarah or someone else that Steve can’t wait to meet. Their first kiss and their last kiss. The night they made Sarah. The night they made their second child, and the third, and the fourth and, and, and. Going through a rut with Tony, and helping Tony through his heats. Going on a vacation, Sarah and her siblings swimming in a lake and playing catch at the edge of the woods. Training Tony in hand-to-hand combat in the gym, at night, the compound silent all around them, and ending up mixing blows and kisses. Going out on a double date with Bucky and Natasha. Being Avengers together. Licking Tony’s slick right from the source and leaving the worst beard burn on the inside of his thighs; listening to Tony complain about it for days. Taking the jet and ending up on some deserted beach God knows where, Tony riding him in such a wild way that they don’t even care about sand getting in the most uncomfortable places. Knotting Tony’s mouth and kissing him right after, even though he says that he’s gross (he isn’t) and you don’t need to do it (you do). Not having to hide an old t-shirt of Tony’s in a drawer because he can have Tony whenever he wants. Not having to keep a broken grandfather clock in his room so he doesn’t lose his mind. Kissing Tony, fucking Tony, marrying Tony. Drawing Tony. Being able to show Tony the drawings without him getting angry, or sad, or mad, or all of the above.
He bandages Steve’s wrists and ankles as best he can, covering the wounds with gauze. He wraps up Steve’s broken fingers. He disinfects the slashes on Steve’s skin. Steve feels his eyelids grow heavy.
Tony is silent for a long time. He finishes his food, checks his phone, tidies up a few things around the kitchen. Steve has learned to leave him to think things on his own when he’s like this. He’ll say something if he needs to.
They’re close to Parma now, and Tony feels like tortellini in brodo for dinner, screw the summer heat. They just need to drive past Reggio Emilia, and then head for Scandiano. He knows just the place.
Tony, a red gauntlet on the cuffs, a whirring sound choked off suddenly. The cuffs fall open around Steve’s wrists—red with blood and infection, purple with bruising, white with bones protruding out of his skin.
“Oh,” Tony says, and a devilish expression dances, briefly, over his features. “Almost forgot. FRIDAY?”
But Steve isn’t one to give up easily on seemingly impossible feats. They have time, after all; no need to rush things.
He is exposed, utterly laid out, all of him, good and bad, successes and failures, shiny desires and embarrassing secrets, his mind scrubbed raw to find every cell that makes him, him, to catalog all the clues that lead to him, Anthony Edward Stark.
Then Steve wakes up, but not all the way, no. His brain makes him linger in that strange place between the dream and the real world. It’s just a moment. It’s always just a moment. The illusion never lasts for more than just that.
And it wasn’t a huge revelation in itself, Steve knew already, had always known, but had ignored it up to that moment, and then a minute later he wasn’t ignoring it anymore, and he was thinking it, he was thinking it with words, saying it with the voice of his mind.
Tony shoots him a serious look. “Don’t underestimate them. Look what they’ve done to you,” he says, thoughtful and sympathetic. “How you can possibly not be screaming right now, it’s a mystery.”
, Steve can’t help but hope). But mostly, there’s Tony staying. There’s Tony looking at him straight in the eye, Tony laughing while Steve’s inside him, there’s Tony with his mouth open in a moan, or a scream, Steve can’t decide. There’s Tony being the little spoon, Tony sleeping with his face buried in Steve’s ribs. There’s Tony waking up, Tony bringing breakfast in bed to Steve. There’s Tony offering Steve a flower, eyes bright with happiness and love. There’s the two of them out on a date, sitting at a fancy restaurant, and on the next page they’re at a crappy hole-in-the-wall italian place that Tony has randomly decided has the best tagliatelle al ragù in the city, while Steve just laughs because Tony thinks it’s cute to be this rich and eat there… except those actually end up being the best tagliatelle al ragù Steve has ever had.
And then, obviously, there’s the sex itself, which is simply mind-blowing. Tony’s body is like a present to Steve, something made specifically for him and him only, exactly how he wanted it. There’s nothing he doesn’t like about the way Tony looks, nothing he would change. He could spend weeks with his nose in Tony’s gray hair, caressing his slightly round belly. He could lay on top of him, kissing him, for the rest of his life. He could get lost into Tony’s eyes and he would never want to find his way back home again, because that would be his home. Tony is his home.
He doesn’t really say the word, though. He only mouths it, softly, and the effort to make his cracked lips form the ghost of a sound is a new torture on its own. He tastes blood, after.
After getting out of the car, they walk along the river, until they reach an old bridge, in ruins now. It is, possibly, the most beautiful thing Steve has seen in all his time in Italy.
He puts the strop back in the leather case of his grooming kit. He towels the razor dry and puts it back in too, but leaves the brush and the soap out to dry on the windowsill. It’s so hot that it won’t take much time.
Tony looks at him one last time, holds his nose with his free hand, closes his eyes, and dives into the water. Steve squeezes his hand.
“It went like this. I was scared you’d go after Bucky, but I waited because I wanted to be sure, and I came to you as soon as I felt that I was. I should’ve told you before. But I wanted to tell you. I was about to tell you.”
He likes it, Tony like this. He liked him before too, no question about it, but this change is… interesting. Even though Steve will have to restrain himself around him. He’ll do it. He promised.
Tony’s on top of him, moving, and Steve holds his hips to steady him and just lies there and takes it, until his head starts working again and he can form a thought.
He remembers existing in this room, their room, a room that suddenly felt like a place Steve had never been to, because Tony wasn’t there anymore, and Tony was
They walk back to the guest house while the sun is beginning to set, and the sky is striped with soft orange and pink. There are still a few hours of light.
He sits on the floor in a corner of the room, crosses his legs and lets his head hit the wall over and over, not enough to damage Tony’s property. He’s done enough of that already, to last a lifetime or more.
“I read kindness in your eyes and it makes me sick. I want a ruthless warrior who knows no mercy. I want someone with whom I can rule this disgusting kingdom. Who knows the power of fear and obedience. And instead I got you.”
Riri lifts her head again, swallows her tears, and says, “I should’ve told you. But he—” she shakes her head, and scoffs, “No, I can’t blame it all on him. I agreed to it… Hell, it was basically my idea. Well, not that he’d…
Tony walks and walks for hours, until he has to confess to himself the terrible truth: he’s lost. He can’t even get back to the first cave, the one with the staircase that led outside.
He’s not chained to the wall, but his wrists are cuffed. His bones will heal all wrong like this, and he’ll have to break them again, one by one, so the serum can fix them up properly.
Steve came to the penthouse late at night. Tony was surprised by the visit, because Steve had been avoiding him since he’d gotten back from D.C.
He wrestles a wave of nausea away with relative ease, and the pounding in his ears stops after a minute or two.
Stella’s—Mom’s—words fall into silence. Steve looks confused but concentrated, as if he was trying to understand as much as possible but failed.
“I’m sure,” Tony says, wiggling his butt in the air. “I’m just a jerk. I’m sorry. Now knot me. Come on.”
Steve is breathing quietly next to him. He’s lying on his side, facing Tony, one hand tucked between the pillow and his cheek, the other resting on Tony’s hip under the covers. Tony looks at him, at how perfect he is. He is just— flawless. The sun hits his skin and makes it glow. His eyelashes are the most amazing shade of gold. That single wrinkle next to his eye is still there, unchanged. His lips are the same pink they’ve always been.
I don't want tony to be unhappy. I don't want him to live even a single day like the many Howard gave me. I've always been unhappy, Stella, except for those two beautiful summers we spent together, except the moments when I take my child in my arms and I delude myself that I can keep him safe from the rest of the world.
I thought I'd clarify this because I know from the comments that a lot of you are interested in the places I mention here (I was thinking of making a little list? If you guys are interested? Let me know!) so it was only fair to say that the description of the bridge + river isn't exactly accurate.
“Dad had all the reels. If I was really really quiet I could sneak in his office when he watched them. I used to hide behind the ficus pot.”
“That’s the trick, isn’t it?” Tony says instead, voice unsteady, again on the verge of tears. He doesn’t cry, though. “That’s the fucking trick,” he repeats, tone harsh, letting his throat work over the K’s so that they explode in the silence of the bedroom.
Tony is naked in moments, his skin tanned but still flushed with arousal, muscles taut and sinewy in this dark corner of the lab.
“It wasn’t just... an itch. That night, I mean. I don’t know why I said that.” Tony can feel Steve’s sigh of relief shake his chest through the mattress, deep and unbridled. “It was important. For me.”
“Sure,” Steve says, and passes him a pencil and his sketchbook. Tony opens it, and scribbles something on the first blank page. When he’s done, he looks at the sketch on the other page, a doodle of Bucky and Natasha resting on a couch. He has his head in her lap, she’s stroking his hair. Tony brushes his fingers over it, over the place where Steve wrote
Tony stares at him for a moment that tastes like a lifetime of mistakes. His face, mostly composed and serious, still goes through a sequence of microexpressions that tell Steve more than he’d like to know about the way Tony feels about him.
“Right... Hey, I got you a couple of gifts. Nothing fancy or useful, but I thought you’d like them.”
, at his dick, which is a nice new low—before he’s engulfed in anger and shame, both directed at his own stupid self.
Tony twists on his feet and turns the oven on. He pushes the herbs in the mixer and presses down on the button, lets the loud noise it makes cancel reality for a few seconds.
His grip isn’t tight, but it’s by no means loose, either. Tony, again, doesn’t feel trapped or threatened; he’s not really safe, maybe, but he’s being... held.
The sweep of the felt tip of his marker on the paper is smooth and soothing. Steve draws over a line that didn’t come out quite right, and, there, now it looks better, but still not perfect.
“The objects I shrank during my experiments kept giving off a radiation I hadn’t accounted for. FRIDAY didn’t warn me immediately because it didn’t register as life-threatening for the first couple of days. But then my clothes weren’t fitting anymore so...”
He cries, and cries, and cries so much that the air gets stuck in his throat in such a way that he thinks it’s impossible he was ever able to draw a single breath in his entire life, that he’ll ever be able to do it again. His chest gives him another jolt of pain, acute and inescapable—it’s ice-cold water in his lungs.
He answers, and an excited voice from the other end of the line says, “Mr. Stark!” and then a billion other things, too fast and weird for Steve to understand.
His eyes are unbearably sad. He smiles a smile that’s all pain and sorrow and hate for himself, and Steve’s eyes fill with tears. He tries to hold them in by clenching his jaw, hard, to the point of pain, but to no avail. They fall down his cheeks, as hot as his shame.
Steve lifts his knees behind Tony, so he can lean back against his thighs. A warm ache settles into Steve’s bones, and his knot trembles as he releases another load of come inside Tony. Steve presses up into him, pushes him down so the knot is sheathed a bit deeper in his body, and the skin of Tony’s hole closes up around the very base of Steve’s cock, under the knot. Tony shakes and hisses and says, “Goddammit,” under his breath.
“Anyway, she wrote a book. Well, she wrote a bunch of books, about astrophysics, but then she wrote this other one. An autobiography. She talks about my mother there, and I’d like you to read that chapter.”
“Gonna… breed you,” Steve murmured in his ear, out of breath, while a sense of belonging stronger than anything Tony had ever felt surged across the bond. “Make you… mine,” Steve finished.
They stay like that for a while, with no rush, Steve working Tony open with clever and deliberate flicks of his wrist. Tony’s inner walls feel hot and tender against Steve’s fingertips, and when he finds Tony’s prostate he rubs at it very gently, just once, and Tony jerks in his arms, his whole body shudders and Steve holds him through it all, true to his promise. When Tony seems to relax again, Steve goes back to the knot of muscle deep inside him, and the more Steve touches it, the more Tony gets used to the sensation, handles it better, with deep groans leaving his chest to die into Steve’s mouth, against his skin.
Tony didn’t look. He only felt the blunt, wet tip of the man’s cock press into him, which he hadn’t been expecting at all, so he let out a small, terrified, “No, no,” before realizing that nothing he could ever say would change anything; that there was nothing he could possibly have to say here, to this man, to make him stop. So he never said anything else.
“We don’t have time for this,” Tony says while they fall to the floor in a heap of limbs and disturbingly annoying clothes.
“It’s okay, it’s okay,” Steve says urgently, and Tony wonders if he has inadvertently said something out loud. “Listen. Despite all our back and forth... and all the things we’ve said and done to each other, I want you to know… I—”
“Well, I’m not,” Steve replies, and Tony realizes he said that last thing out loud. “Tony. I’m not asking you to be perfect. I just want you to be you.”
