“I can be an amazing uncle. I love pups, yes, and I would love to have some, but Cas is my mate. I want him as is.”
It didn’t take but a few more thrusts until Cas could feel Dean’s knot was just about to lock them together. He thrust up into his alpha harder, wanting him to lock them together but he wanted his bite too. He brought his hands up and cradled his mate’s face forcing him to look up from where their bodies were thrusting together, to look into his eyes. When Cas was sure he had Dean’s attention, with no slowing down, he bared his neck to him letting him know with no uncertainty that Cas was ready to be his and his alone.
Dropping Cas’ hand, Dean reached behind his head and pulled his t-shirt off, making the omega groan. Dean threw the shirt onto the love seat across from the bed. There was even a fireplace if they wanted to bother lighting it, but Dean figured they would make enough heat between them to keep the room warm.
The kitten is named after someone I've come to love very much which makes me ever so grateful to this fandom. I have made so many friends,  and began writing again.
“Relax, Dean. I met your omega.”
The closer he got to Cas, the muskier his mate's scent became. He could see the slick shining on his ass and thighs as he kept just out of reach of Dean. Or so Dean let him think. There was little doubt in his mind that he could reach out and grab his omega, but he wanted this to be perfect for both of them. Somehow, he found the strength to resist leaping on Cas and claiming him on the cold, hard floor.
"Damn it! I just cleaned in here. Why don't you be helpful and help me?"
“What’s up, Cas?”
One moment he's having a good day making people happy with his baked goods and the next he's sitting on the floor behind the counter breathing into a paper bag that Gabriel thrust at him.
“Alpha.”
“Fuck you, you freak! What the hell kinda costume are you wearing? As soon as I’m done with you, I’m gonna fuck that bitch, and I'll make him watch me peel the skin from your body. I'll figure out whatever you got on, you can bet on that!” Oh, he was
“Did you call the cops?”
Cas woke about an hour later, according to the clock on the bedside table. Lifting his head, he saw that Dean was still asleep. He didn’t think the man could get any better looking, but seeing him at rest was a sight to behold. While he couldn’t see the verdant eyes of his lover, he could still admire the long lashes that lay across his cheeks. It reminded him of his mom’s false lashes, but Dean’s were better.
<3 Roo
“Mother! Thank you.” He gently removed his parent from his mate, and said mate looked extremely grateful.
“Are you alright, Cas?”
“Omega, tell me one more time. Tell me you want this, please.” He stepped back and spun Cas around so that he could look him in the eyes.
Did he have any siblings? Yes, Sir, two younger brothers.
He watched the two walk off and gave a huff of laughter looking at the differences between his alpha brother, who was close to a giant, and the human omega, who was just short.
After a breathy gasp of shock, the omega just groaned, flipped over to his hands and knees and presented. “
Cas was scared to death but so excited he was actually telling his brother to drive faster. The brother who had a record number of speeding tickets in his history. Bal had been known to pay thousands of dollars as well as untold hours of community service to the County Sheriff's office because of his speeding. He was continually lecturing him on being more careful, and telling him of the things that could go wrong, but tonight he was telling him to get a move on.
“Dean, please look at me.” The omega managed to flick his eyelashes up for two seconds. He’d take the win.
He only wished that he could be there when Castiel would report his claim to Lord John. It wasn't “done" to have the omega there for their obligatory meeting, but it was fun to imagine, anyway. Wonder if his father would think he was still unworthy. Guess it didn't matter, because his mate obviously thought he was.
Huh. That didn’t sound ominous, not at all.
“Here, cuddle this lil’ bug. Dean’s on his way over and I believe you two need to leave soon. I don’t want you to worry about her, Cas. She will be well cared for and Dean can call when you have a few moments of peace, so you can see her.”
"Shut up, Bal. I can't help it. Be glad you don't have to worry about your scent giving away your emotions with no way to stop it."
“Are you alright, Alpha?” He could feel his mate's heart beating wildly.
“That would be fine, Dean, but I should go in and register. We both smell pretty aroused and I don’t need the cops showing up when we can finally get our shirts off and let our soulmarks appear.”
“Anywhere, as long as it shows.”
The omegas didn't get an opinion.
"Just another bit and we'll be there. I would ask if you're excited for our night out, but I can smell that you are."
"They say opposites attract."
Time passed swiftly among the rows of color and foliage, and soon they heard the unmistakable sounds of musicians tuning up their instruments.
"What can I do for you, Alistair?"
The beta led him to the tents for a cool glass of lemonade. “I will stay with you until an alpha dismisses me. OK, sir?”
Stopping on a dime, he turned and went from a jog to a run, now that he knew which way to go. He saw a flash of a naked butt going around the curve of the hallway, making him flat out run after his omega. He flung himself around the corner and slammed into the wall. While he was ‘son of a bitch’ing at himself, he heard Cas giggle, moving away from him. Barking out a laugh, he pushed off of the wall and rushed after his mate.
“Oh, hello, Sam. I was calling Dean. Did I enter the wrong number?”
“Raise up a bit, Cas,” he told the omega, helping him raise his bottom up just enough so that Dean could move his hand down between their bodies. He wanted to reach through Cas’ legs to tease his hole with a finger.
He tortured his partner with pleasure until the need to mate was too strong. The stunning creature below him was more than ready—wet and loose from his vigorous activities, and he had never stopped vocalizing his appreciation for the alpha’s efforts.
“Yes.”
Castiel's eyes never left Dean's lowered face as he watched the most exquisite omega he had ever seen bow in acknowledgement. “Thank you, Charlie. You are dismissed.”
It took him about forty-five seconds to snap his neck. Lord Zachariah groaned.
“Cas, babe. I need you to relax and let Charlie help you til I get there. We’re going as fast as we can, so hold on, Angel.”
“Yes, Michael.”
The one Dean had just dodged, turned quickly, just in time to see the other drop dead, which caused him to roar and charge. The green-eyed alpha dropped to the ground and swept his legs at the approaching alpha. As he fell towards Dean, his alpha punched him in the throat before twisting his neck, killing him as easily as the first.
The beta squeezed Dean's hand as a goodbye and good luck, curtsied in a bounce, and the omega was alone with the alpha. So to speak.
“One hundred percent, no questions?” Aw, Gabe looked so earnest. He was very sweet, and it touched him.
Wrapping one of Cas’ knees over his arm, he raised the leg up so that he could grind deep. Using just short, hard movements without actually dragging his cock out, the alpha bent to bite on the man’s nipples.
"Cassie, I'll fix this, I swear."
Feeling Cas’ tongue tangle with his, inhaling their combined scent deep with arousal, knowing that he would be the only one to have Cas, it was all making Dean’s head spin. Backing out of the kiss slowly with closed mouth kisses, he kept his mate wrapped in his arms, just pulling back enough to look in his eyes.
“I was thinking, well, hoping really, that maybe after we ate we could shower or bathe, together?”
It didn't take him long to cook (he used a bit of grace to speed things up), and he was excited to get to pile into bed with his family. Carrying a tray ladened with food and drinks he carefully went upstairs and into their room, and the sight that greeted him made his heart full. Cas was settled with his back on the headboard holding Emmie's hands as she bounced on his thighs, standing on her feet with her wings trying to flap more than their normal flutter. Cas was laughing like a loon which was wonderful, but add in Emmie's giggles, well, it about brought the alpha to his knees in gratitude.
There was a lot to keep his mind busy. The estate they had arrived at in the early evening was imposing and impressive. He had never seen such a gigantic dwelling (not that he had much of an opportunity in his childhood), and was in awe of what people could accomplish. As he was escorted through the long halls to his temporary chambers, he had detected the heavenly smell of fresh apples and cinnamon and wondered if the staff had been baking pies for the Meet. Also to his delight, Dean's room faced the back gardens, and it was obvious that the lord of the castle took great care of the grounds. Before the sun had gone down, he had feasted his eyes on a splendid park of flowers, trees, shrubs and picturesque fountains. Perhaps he'd be able to see them up close tomorrow. With that lovely thought, he drifted to sleep.
“Come on, Master Dean. Time to get up and get dressed.” His beta servant didn't ever let him dawdle.
"An Alpha? Really, Cassie. I thought you would find a mild Beta more compatible with your bookish ways."
Sitting back on Dean’s knees so he could look at his pretty face (he was a goner), he wiped his tears away. He leaned forward to kiss those lips (he could write a sonnet about those lips, but maybe later).
"Michael knows what he's doing, Sammy, have faith." He was patting the younger alpha on the back when he heard Emmie squeal. Turning, he watched as Emmie's eyes (along with Gabe's) grew huge at seeing the bouncy castle.
Cas tilted his head back to look up into his amazing, green-eyed angel. He closed his eyes as his mate wiped the tears from his face. He heard his pup issue a ‘pay attention to me’ cry. He felt, more than heard, a whine from deep within his alpha’s chest. Cas kissed him chastely (man, he needed to be alone with him soon!), and pushed him towards the pup.
Mating and feels<3
“Um...”
Dean held his hand as he walked Cas back to his table pulling out his chair for him. He could see the teasing smile that his brother was giving them both.
Also know, that in this unique situation that comes with your mating, Heaven in behind you with its love and power.
This was it. Dean was just moments from getting to present himself before the Omegas. Oh, how he had talked to Michael! Laying out his need for his Original Sire to deliver his mate to him during the ceremony. Dean gave Michael his assurances that he and his Omega would raise good and faithful angels. He told him that he would provide an eternity of happiness, love, respect, and faithfulness to his Omega and his offspring.
He laughed along with Cas, watching as a blush bloomed on the man's face at his own words. Dean knew that others thought he was hot, but he never thought it himself. He just used it to make the money to take care of his brother and to further both their dreams.
“Oh! Deeeean...fuck.”
Cas smiled as his soon-to-be mate dodged a punch from one alpha, as he simultaneously broke the neck of the one who was trying to grab him from the side. Dean had grabbed him by the hair before gripping his head with two hands and, twisting hard, killed the alpha instantly, leaving only two, now.
A couple of mind-blowing orgasms, a shared shower, and a full breakfast later, they were on the love seat with his head in Cas’ lap and the omega petting Dean’s hair.
“Cast...Cas, Mom wants to speak to you. I'll wait for you in the dining hall.”
Sam knew that the human omegas believed there was only one fate for them when they were selected to be here for the ceremony. It would take time for them to realize that they would not be murdered after helping their alpha repopulate Heaven.
As all this was happening, his cock had been slipping around on Cas’s thighs collecting slick. Apparently deciding to move things along, Cas closed his legs with his cock trapped between them. Then the omega squeezed, causing Dean to drop his forehead onto his shoulder, and let out a roar with ecstasy.
“I don’t know how long it actually takes, Omega. That is the one detail that no one ever speaks of and when our pups are old enough to be mated, we won’t speak of it. I can smell your nerves but I can assure you that you will feel no pain, Honey.” Dean tried to push out a comforting scent, he just didn’t know if it could overtake his aroused scent.
“What??”
“I’m glad you like it, Cas. I wanted to build a comfortable nest and well, Mom helped a lot, telling me things that omegas like and that would make raising pups here easier.” Dean took Emmie from his arms, since she was falling asleep while still holding on the Gatorade bottle.
“Dean, are you happy, my child?”
“He what, Charlie?”
shoulders. Dean was making it very clear that his actions against his mate were the reason he was going to die by Dean’s hands.
They drove in silence after Charlie hung up, until they were just a few miles from the bunker. He knew he had to have a chick flick moment with his younger brother, and he hated it. But he did it, anyway.
“If you want any breakfast before you leave, you’d best hurry up. You do not want to be late.” Keeping his father waiting never turned out well.
Gabe stepped away with Emmie, singing a good morning song to her and Dean turned towards his brother. Sam was watching Gabe with such longing that it made Dean's heart ache for him.
“I want to wear your mark, again, too. This one won’t heal like the hand print did. I kinda always wished it had stayed around.” Cas looked down and started pulling on the hair at the back of Dean’s head. “What, Cas?”
“I began working in my uncle's shop after school and fell in love with the classics. The reason why I started the Alpha Review was that I knew a few guys that could dance, and we all needed money for one reason or another. I've slowly been handing the reigns of operations for the review over to my best friend, Benny.”
Cas had his mouth stretched tight around Dean’s cock and he couldn’t get over how much he liked it. He liked the salty, earthy taste of his skin, and how something so soft could cover something so hard. He tried dragging the tip of his tongue across the head and felt Dean’s body jump in response. He could tell it was good by his mate’s scent, which was quite strong in his current location. He only got to bob his head a few times to see how much of Dean’s cock he could fit in his mouth, when he was being flipped around again. Whee!
“What did you wish to ask me, Castiel?”
He watched as Dean leaned forward to softly whisper 'mine' in his ear.
“Cas... I know the first time, for the mating to really take, we can’t use condoms, but you could pup.” He hated seeing the worry on Dean’s face, so he sat up and pulled Dean down for a kiss.
"My Omega. Mine. My Soulmate."
"What the hell are you talking about?"
“Just need a minute, Cas,” he mumbled from his hiding spot, lips moving over his mate’s skin.
“Alistair! Surrender and submit!” Oh, that growl. Yep, Cas could definitely feel slick leaking from his hole and he needed his alpha to fill him up.
“You are determined, Sir?” (He wanted to call him "puppy")
He kissed the back of Cas' hand while winking at his brother, letting the Beta know he could take the teasing.
“Cas?”
He shook his head to get himself out of the past and into the present. He needed to finish his water. No drinking on the job was his one rule to the guys other than not touching anyone during club hours. If they wanted to hook up after, that was on them, but nothing could happen in the clubs. He had time to do one lap dance before he had to get changed for his slow number.
Slowly, as he still wanted to be careful with his mate, Dean pushed further in, an inch at a time with his eyes watching every twitch on Cas’ face, making sure there was nothing but pleasure there. When Cas began chewing his bottom lip again, Dean had to rescue it by bending down to pull it into his mouth with gentle suction. The change in his position helped him bottom out with his hips flush to his omega making his inner alpha howl, which came out as a fierce growl (with a slight sound at the end that could have been a whimper if he wasn’t an alpha). He'd deny to anyone (except for Cas) that he whimpered, but, damn did it feel good to be connected to his mate the only way mates could be.
The omega found himself on his back, laid out on the bed with his alpha hovering above him, waiting.
She saw his attention had drifted away as he scented the air. “What do you smell?” she asked.
” Dean saw that his father clenched his jaw, probably because he noted that Castiel had omitted his title.
“Can we sit and talk?”
Hiya! I'm back...n I've missed y'all so much.
his mate, Cas actually purred and hollered “Fuck!” at the same time, causing the alpha to bark out a laugh with his still tongue inside. Now that he had tasted his omega he couldn’t stop. Making his tongue as firm as possible he began fucking Cas with it while kneading those stunning ass cheeks, letting Cas relax his arms that had begun shaking with the effort of holding himself open while being overwhelmed with desire.
That magnificent alpha took down nine men before Zachariah’s man came forward. Of course.
Placing nips along Cas’ shoulder blade, he grazed his teeth up the side of his neck, causing Cas to stretch it further, giving his mate room to taste him. Dean let his alpha lead him to the perfect spot where he sucked a deep bruise. X marked the spot when he was ready.
He sat down next to his brother as he thought about what Bal was saying. It may actually be true. Omegas were the minority of the population with the majority split between Alphas and Betas. When people found out he was an Omega he was treated like royalty. Somedays it could be nice and other days he detested it. Mostly it was the way his parents tried to baby him and keep him over-protected. Luckily, he had a big brother who was a Beta and liked to enjoy life.
“He is, Cas. He just thinks, and Sam and I agree, that I should pack a bag for me and Sam. We’re gonna go to a motel for a few days. Dean wants me to come out before he comes in. He’s um...kinda worked up, and I don’t wanna see or hear anything. Get it?” She was looking at him bouncing her eye brows.
“There aren’t any pies, Sir.”
Dean had just done his fast routine to "You Shook Me All Night Long" and he would do his slow song later. Dean would pick a different song for that depending on his mood. He usually did four solo stage dances and one group dance each time they performed in a club. Including the lap dances he did, he made enough to help his brother with the cost of college, save to start his garage and survive day to day with a few splurges once in a while.
He grabbed Dean’s phone off the table while he leaned back to kiss his brother on the cheek, loving the feel of his alpha’s strong arms holding him up, protecting him.
Cas took one more look at the man’s jeans before looking back up into those green eyes and spreading his legs in invitation.
There's a bit more to this than I originally thought...stupid lil plot bunnies.
"Why don't you ya' know, wave your hands or whatever it is the other angels do? I've noticed that you and your family tend to do things the 'human' way." Dean smiled when he actually used finger quotes.
“Of course, Hon. Here. Actually I just programmed this old phone of mine for you and set up service. You can call or text Dean anytime. Alright?”
“Please kneel here, on these pillows, facing each other. I want you to listen to the vows and make sure that your inner alpha and omega can live up to them.”
"Of course, I want to stop this! I just know there's no way to do so."
He stood up and shoved his boxer-briefs down his legs and stepped out of them. There was no way he was going to be able to chase Cas in this underwear. If he wasn’t as hard as a rock, he might've been fine, but they were already a size too small (they were his back-up pair after all).
“Oh, Dean. I do love you.” He redoubled his purrs, snuggling into his alpha’s chest and began to feel himself drift off to sleep. Dean rubbed his back and left kisses on his head.
He went downstairs to eat dinner with his parents. Cas would have preferred to remain in his room to get ready for tonight. He wanted to take his time, bathe and pamper himself a bit. He also wanted to get off to the tatts on the body on the Alpha Review flyer that Bal had given him. It was a shame that the picture didn't include the Alpha's face, Cas was sure it was as hot as the chest was. He had done that several times a day since he had gotten it. Oh well.
“He’s in Vermont decimating a vamp nest. When did your heat start?”
Dean was surrounded by his friends as they patted him on the back and hugged him. He heard a lot of 'lucky bastard' as well, since he was the only one who had found their mate so far.
“We need to get back soon. Michael is calling us for dinner.”
“Forever, Castiel.”
"Nonsense. You only turn twenty-one once and we're having a party. There will be plenty of your friends and family there if the RSVPs are correct."
“You will be her Daddy?”
“Alpha?”
He waited until Dean’s eyes opened and caught his. Then he  slipped his hand between their bodies to guide his alpha’s cock to his open, wet hole. When Dean’s eyes widened and flashed red, he could feel his eyes flash gold in response. Cas nodded in consent.
Dean pulled into the driveway that Cas indicated and swallowed hard. It was a beautiful, two-story, brick home, the kind he used to dream about growing up in, had his mom lived and his dad hadn’t gone loco. He startled when Cas leaned over to kiss him on the cheek as he turned off Baby. Dean really was nervous if he forgot to shut her off!
“So...listen. If something happens, you have to take care of them.”
"Cassie, let me mate you. If we mated they wouldn't take you!"
His mouth never stopped exploring his new mate, moving from his mouth to his neck. He shoved his nose over the scent gland and inhaled that incredible scent from the source. “Mate.”
(See the end of the chapter for
When he thought about Naomi throwing his angel out of Heaven, he saw red. He had always believed that angels (except for a select few) were not worth a damn, but this was something completely unexpected. To throw the best of them out of Heaven? Yeah, he was gonna have to find a few minutes alone with that manipulating bitch.
"Let's do this."
"Thank you"
“Charlie gave me my own phone and some more water. I told her I would try to eat something with her shortly. I was going to try to rest for a few minutes, but...”
Dean was standing in a warehouse surrounded by alphas  lying on the ground, except for the ugly one who was snarling at him. Cas stood closely behind Dean.
But I’m not a man who falls too easily
He smiled in relief. “No need to worry. I am to go speak to Alistair.”
“Very well, Sam. I am Castiel and the idiot sitting on the floor eating candy is my older, stubborn assbutt of a brother, Gabriel.”
“Yes.”
happened in the past. You are so strong, Honey, and you’ve carried this for so long, please let me help you in the only way I can.” He rubbed soft circles on his hip bones to soothe the omega.
“Fuck, Sweetheart. You smell and taste so amazing. I need more.” He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Cas’ ass, because as of right now, to Dean it was the eighth wonder of the freakin’ world.
Enjoy!
There were a few murmurings, so he added, “I will have any alpha that does not obey me escorted off the property immediately, regardless of who you are. Now.
“Yeah, so not what you’re picturing. He's dehydrated and starving.”
His Royal Highness, Prince Castiel, was in A Mood. He was normally a mild-mannered alpha, not overly strict with his orders, generous to his servants and tenants and easy with his friends and relatives. Most of the time. Sometimes his relations made him want to pull out his hair. For instance, upon receiving the news that his brother, the king, had sent a request to host this year's AO Meet, Castiel wished His Majesty to jump off of the east turret of his castle.
Whispering “finally” Dean leaned down the few inches to get his first taste of the man he’d been in love with for years (he was finally honest with himself). He thought to keep their first kiss chaste out of respect for Cas, but when his omega purred and licked his bottom lip (well, what was an alpha to do), he scooped his mate up bridal style and carried him to their nest.
He couldn't help but rub his fingertips over each and every robe. It seemed as if there were robes in every color known to man in this Angel's arms. It seemed impossible til Cas remembered these were Angels.
He watched the alpha as he put his hands on his hips and glared at the growing crowd around him. “Well?” he asked. “Who wants to challenge me first?”
Cas couldn’t keep the tears from rushing down his cheeks. His alpha was such a good man. He couldn’t wait to mate with him and begin their lives together.
Dean leaned over and kissed his mom’s hand as she patted Emmie on her diaper-inflated baby-butt. Her other hand smoothed over his hair and he closed his eyes in pleasure. He took a moment to just soak in everything that had happened today. Opening his eyes, he watched as Cas laughed with his brother as they were eating. By his scent, Dean was well aware his omega’s heat was going to begin soon, but he figured they had a few more hours before Michael would dismiss the newly mated couples.
“Fuck. That word has never sounded better than it does coming out of your pretty mouth, Omega. I could drive us to your place...”
when she grabbed at the spoon.
Enjoy
“Yep.” Cas popped the P giving his sister his famous smirk. “He’s one of my in-laws.”
Oh thank the gods. He could breathe again.
“Soon, Honey. I'm always gonna take care of you,” he replied as he again licked some slick up and swallowed the ambrosia.
"Hey, Blondie-Girl, come here, puppy." He scooped her up from Gabe and sat down next to Sam (who was completely focused on the sleeping boy in his arms) so he could show Emmie her brother.
“Whatever he wants. I will do anything to make him happy.”
He had released a rumble from his chest and blushed. But he couldn’t help it! Charlie was covered in his omega’s scent, and it was glorious.
Castiel raised an eyebrow and flatly stated, “What did that cretin do now,
Feeling Cas undulating his hips so he could rub his cock on Dean threatened to break the hold on his inner alpha. He appeased it by sucking an impressive mark behind his mate’s ear, damn near drawing blood. On the next slide of his fingers deep inside Cas, Dean found what he had been searching for. The “Fuck, Dean!” letting him know that he had found his prostate. Now,
“Dudes!” He heard the pride in Charlie’s voice when she answered Dean’s call. “Yeah, no. Cas wanted to watch, but no sound though. Huh? Oh, OK, that makes sense. See you in a few.” She pocketed her phone and picked up the laptop.
"If I find out who it is...."
Dean led his mate to a chair, while he stood behind him with his hands resting on Cas’ shoulders.
And the girls say
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas walked into the living room holding his sister by the hand. When they stood before Dean, Cas hefted the puppybag on his shoulder before kissing her cheek.
"Gabe, please. I have just a moment left. Hug me before we walk to Alistair's office. I won't give him the satisfaction of seeing our tears."
“You will suffer me, Alistair, and you will die.”
"Brudders are the best." He bumped shoulders with Sam, acknowledging his agreement with the sentiment.
Dean was sitting on the couch in a bit of shock at how easily Cas’ alpha mother accepted that Cas was moving away. He knew not to believe in generalities, but he had always heard that alpha mothers were hard put to let their pups go. He was waiting for Cas’ omega father to come back. The man had insisted on making them lunch before they left and for once Dean was unsure if he could eat. He had asked his mate (he was mated!) if he wanted help to pack some of his things, but Cas’ mom had insisted it wouldn’t take them long and he got the impression that she wanted a few minutes alone with her son.
“Feel good?”
Dean was a happy alpha. He was sitting next to his omega (he was mated! Well, except for the…ya’ know) and his pup was sleeping on his shoulder with her little nose pressed deep into his neck. It tickled every time she took a breath and he loved it!
Dean went into his bag and pulled out his pink, lace boy-shorts. They weren't for everyone and he may lose some requests for lap dances but when he needed an extra boost of confidence he put them on. Making sure his cock was nestled just so, he then put on his leather pants with the laces on the legs. This was the whole outfit for his slow song, now he just had to pick the song.
"So, I take it that it's so you can grab him again during this number?"
I'm so thankful for everything QueenMaire has done for this. She's amazing.
“Dean...mmm. Wait...”
He could hear his sister scent the pup in her arms. “She doesn’t smell like him, anymore. She smells like Cas and...ginger?”
chose that worthless piece of—”
Pulling back from the kiss he watched as Dean tried to chase his lips, before opening those green eyes to stare at him again. He laughed to himself as Dean sniffed at the air smelling the happiness (and maybe a bit of slick that came from thinking about those nights of passion) coming from him.
Dragging his nails up Cas’ spine until he could pull his head back his hair, Dean attacked his neck again with lips, tongue and teeth. He opened his mouth wide right above Cas’ Adam’s apple and held on with his canines as he breeched his hole with his middle finger, causing the omega to shout his name.
“Omega??”
“So, you say he’s mine but you can’t tell me what he smells like? I don’t get it, Sam.”
“Cas!”
“Alpha.”
He watched with relief as his brother closed the door and came and sat down across from him. Dean was going to need Sam’s help to find the courage to go after his dream.
“No hiding, Sweetheart. We're mates, no hiding. Tell me.” He spoke so softly, it made Cas' heart gooey.
"Cassie, really, Dear. How long does it take to put a shirt on?"
Cas decided on some sinfully-tight, black jeans that hugged his ass to perfection and made his legs look phenomenal. He paired them with a white, button-up shirt that tucked in and kept the top three buttons undone. He wanted to show a bit of skin tonight. On top of that, he layered a simple, black, spring blazer which he wouldn't need once he was in the club with the hot Alphas.
"Dean?"
Once an alpha vocally “claimed" an omega, any alpha could challenge it. And since omegas were not as plentiful as betas (anyone wanting a beta just arranged it between the families), and were more desired as mates, it was almost guaranteed that there would be more than one alpha to come forward and challenge. All challenges were physical. Sometimes it was a free-for-all, where the alphas summarily jumped into one, large fight, and sometimes it was a tad more civilized, where the alphas would methodically pair off to determine a winner.
‘You are awesome, Baby.” He was impressed that in the middle of his heat, when his whole body was crying out for his alpha, Cas could still make observations like the leader he had been as an angel.
His mate whined louder and rolled his hips back on his cock. “Do you want me to slide into you? Give in to my alpha and thrust into your pretty hole, hard and dirty?”
"Just help me sweep up the feathers while I go put on my ceremonial robe. Please, Sam. I'm nervous enough without you giving me a hard time."
💙💚Roo
“Hmm?”
It took only minutes for Bal to hand him a glass of bubbly with a toast of 'to you getting laid, Cassie' coming out of his mouth. He was too busy trying to look around. He could smell his soulmate, he just couldn't tell where he was. He could tell however, that he wasn’t any of the ones doing lap dances around them.
Dean never stopped the movement of his body. After so many years the dance became second nature. He let his eyes roam all over Cas' face and chest. His soulmate was fucking gorgeous and was apparently enjoying looking at Dean as well. He could feel the Omega's hard-on underneath him since he had moved up closer to his body. Dean made sure that on every other thrust of his body his chest bumped against Cas'. He wanted to place his hand over his heart so desperately, but not in front of an audience. It was a private moment that Dean had dreamt of for years.
Dean was a bit thirsty and the intense stare of Cas’s brother was actually a bit unnerving. He grabbed Cas’ glass and took a sip.
“Sam, how do I claim my mate?”
He looked up to see Cas giving him what Sammy would call ‘heart-eyes’ so he brought himself up short and repeated his question of what was bothering Cas.
"This is such a perfect day, Omega." He pulled his mate closer to him so he could rest his head on top of Cas' as they watched their daughter chasing Pip-Pip (the pot bellied pig) around the swing-set, trying to put a beanie on his head.
Every heat he went through Cas dreamt of the Alpha: what he would look like, how he would take care of his mate during his heat. He came many times screaming out 'Alpha!', and it was that Alpha he thought of.
Dean turned to see his mate standing there with glassy eyes, sweat glistening on his skin, slowly unbuttoning his shirt. The sight of so much skin (and he had only gotten the top three buttons undone!) caused a growl to emerge from deep in Dean’s chest. He needed to take care of his mate, right
“I don’t know! He asked if I marked her and I said, yes.”
When Charlie had gone to collect some other things (after he had given her Sam’s bag), Cas went into overdrive. He didn’t really understand the need he felt, or why his inner omega was wanting Dean to chase him, but he was going to give in to it. His feet were itching to run, but first he was going to lay some false clues for his alpha!
“Dean, I'm a hunter. I pay attention. Yeah, I knew, and I also knew that he felt the same way about you. He needs you, Dean.”
The omega took a deep breath. “Ohhhhh.”
Cas thought about that for a moment before he answered. He walked over to Emmie’s changing table to give him time. After laying her down, he rubbed his nose against hers. No matter how she came to be, he adored his pup. Huh. Cas took a closer scent of her and discovered that the lingering scent of his attacker was fading and she smelled almost like an apple pie, with the combination of his apple scent and Dean’s ginger and brown sugar.
“Push it, Sammy.”
“I'm gonna make you feel so good, Cas. Gonna take care of you, Omega. I love that you’re mine. This may be quick, ‘cuz I don’t know how long I can last before I claim you. Fuck. I can feel my knot wanting to pop now.”
“Cas, God, you’re gorgeous, my omega.”
“Close your eyes and listen, Omega.”
"Oh, Bal. There was a lovely Alpha around here. I wish I could have met him."
What was his home like? My father has a modest estate, Sir.
Ah. His alpha—no,
Baron Invidus barged forward. “You can't do that!”
"Careful, Omega. Don't choke on that
‘’Sorry, Alpha. I don’t understand why...”
“Yes,” he replied, patting the hand that Gabriel had placed on his arm.
He heard the music in the background get a bit louder and then his Alpha was singing to him.
"Let it be known and recorded that on this day to Dean and Cas (Michael looked at Cas to wink letting him know that he was respecting his wish to not be called Castiel) Winchester that Colton Jack has been born." There was no stopping the tears as Dean heard all the angels in Heaven giving thanks for his son, CJ. They had decided on his name and nickname sometime ago, but had kept it a secret until his birth.
Charlie was now the one listening to him, since horticulture was a particular passion for Dean—and one that he was allowed to participate in, as it was an “acceptable” omega pursuit. He had enjoyed spending a great deal of time among the flowers and herbs, and many of his embroidery designs were inspired from the family grounds.
And the look in your eyes said you felt as much
“Come in and I’ll get your Father! This is so exciting!!”
“I just didn’t want to assume that it was something that you would want.” The omega was still feeling awkward about the whole thing.
“You...you won’t be long, will you?” the omega whispered.
“Dean, baby. It’s alright.” He loved the feeling of Cas’ fingers stroking through his hair and lightly scratching his scalp with his nails. Damn, that could make him purr for sure.
“Oh, that’s nice.” He drained his drink as he felt his temperature going up. They didn’t have too much time left before his heat hit him full blast.
“I know, I’m sorry.”
“I love you, too, Bal. Call me before you decide what time you are going home tomorrow, and the three of us will have coffee before you go. Dean?”
“The bond of alpha and omega TrueMates is one that cannot be broken when bonded here, in Heaven.
Being so lost in his thoughts of rubbing, he squeaked out in surprise when he was picked up and thrown over said Alpha's shoulder. He realized the position gave him the opportunity to rub his hands on the man's back. His glorious muscled naked back, so he did. He felt Dean climb on the stage after he had carried him from his table. As he slid him down, he could feel the Alpha shake as Cas kept his hands on his arms. He wanted desperately to rub Dean's chest but he was afraid he would rub over his heart and he didn't want his mark to show up while on stage in a club.
“I want to see you! I need to, please!” Each word was louder until he was yelling at the end.
He heard Cas whine as he pressed his hips against him and nipped his earlobe, before he reached around the flustered man and opened the door. He had Cas against the door again as soon as it closed with them in the room.
"Won't be long, Cas!" Bobby told him as he
“Me too, Honey. Hold on, Cas. Just close your eyes and picture our pup and I’ll fly us there.” He lay his head on Dean’s shoulder and thought of Emmie, lying in a bed between them, laughing and blowing raspberries at her two fathers. Cas would forever be thankful that his alpha claimed Emmie. Always.
Everybody says
I also apologize for not being able to answer a lot of my inbox messages, it just isn't working properly.
“Damn. I’m not some tiny omega, so it's kinda hot that you can toss me around like a damn pillow. Oh, look at the miles of freckled skin on display for me. I...I need you, Alpha. Please.”
“Come on, Omega. Let's take Emmie to her uncles, yeah?” He accepted Dean’s kiss, nodding his head in agreement.
“You could never disappoint me, Dear Heart. I have no expectations as to what we can do together. Regarding your past, I can take away your fears if you want. You
“Yeah?”
His shoulders relaxed and he slowly walked forward. Oh, my, he was even more attractive up close. And smelled utterly delicious.
? Dean jumped up in surprise. He watched as the prince strode over to Baron Invidus. As he desperately wanted to know what was going on, he quickly followed and heard Castiel growl out at the ugly alpha, “If both of your men challenge me, I will kill them, Lord Zachariah.”
“And if you find your alpha?”
“Are you here for mating?” The taller omega (his companion called him “Cassie”) asked Sam.
“Alpha, that’s....I can’t even tell you how happy I am that you’re mine, that you would buy a nesting bed for us, before we were an “Us.” Help me grab some of the blankets in the closet? They are the extremely soft ones that I use when I need a little extra comfort. I want them on our bed, yeah?”
It took her a bit to get Cas settled. He refused to go into any room other than Dean’s, and, weak from heat or not, he was much stronger than she, so he got his way. She got a couple bottles of water in him and forced him to eat some cheese and crackers. He babbled out parts of his story and, shit on a shingle! Dean was gonna freak. Speaking of whom, she had fifteen new voice mails from him and a few from Sam. She grabbed a beer before dialing him back.
“Nah, Cas. Right number, he’s just driving and had me answer the phone. Um...hold on. I'm gonna put you on speaker phone so you can talk to him, o.k.?”
And Dean was now the sunflower to his alpha's face as he placed his hand in Castiel's palm.
He came back to himself when he realized he was staring at the short omega’s ass and the other omega was glaring at him.
"The Angels. The Angels have called for sacrifices. You, Castiel, have been chosen to represent our most humble district. Report to my office by 5 p.m., and don't make me send someone after you. Good Afternoon, gentlemen."
“Yeah...ha! You as hungry as me?”
She had heard Dean growl before, since he was an alpha. He actually growled a lot. She had never heard him whimper before, though. That was definitely new. She could hear Sam in the background asking Dean what was wrong.
“Alright, it’s a few hours to my home, and I don’t think either of us really want that. We could go to a hotel?”
“Of course, Honey. Why you acting embarrassed about that?”
Huh. He kept looking. Perhaps he hadn't been notified about a last minute change.
“It’s time, the line is moving.”
"I'm sorry Dean. I don't believe he is. He's very stubborn, blast the angel! I'll be the one walking with you past the Omegas."
Yours,
"I love you, Alpha. Thank you so much for this life we have." Dean couldn't resist leaning over to kiss his teary mate.
“Dean.”
"Alright, alright. You guessed it. For the first time in his history of dancing, Alpha Dean is going to pick someone to come on stage for him to dance for, on, what have you."
The smallest Angel stepped forward and when he opened his arms he was holding a stack of the most beautiful robes. He could see in just a glance that these were softer than any throw on his nest. He needed to feel this on his skin and soon.
He was pleased that he had thought to bring his current embroidery project with him to help pass the time. It would keep his mind occupied, and away from sad thoughts, such as leaving his two younger brothers behind. It was a difficult and tearful goodbye the night before, and well away from their father, who wouldn’t have stood for that sort of thing. But Sam and Adam were young, and had sensitive little hearts, still, so Dean did his best to assure them that everything would somehow work out. Even though he knew it was a very real possibility that he might not see either of them again.
Dean stood, wiped his hands on his jeans, and looked like he had forgotten about the last alpha. However, Cas had fought along-side Dean and Sam for years, and he could tell that his eyes were taking in each twitch of his opponent’s muscles.
“Thanks, Cas.”
"I agree, Dean. I feel the same need to mate, soon."
"Do you like them, Alpha?" Cas whispered so only Dean could hear him.
Cas knew he was no longer an angel but he was surely in Heaven finally having his alpha inside him. Moving deep and hard, the large head of his cock rubbing against his sweet spot with each stroke was causing him to lose his mind, but in such a good way. He tried pushing his hips back to meet Dean’s thrusts but every time he tried the alpha held his hips tighter and growled. Damn, that was hot.
He realized the Alpha was asking for his name.
"I believe they will be. I can't tell you anything officially, but I can tell you that I have Faith that you will be a mated angel by tonight."
"I have one dance after this. It's a group thing, then I'm done. Will you go get something to eat with me, Cas? So, we can talk?"
“Alright, let’s say you two want pups, but for some reason can’t have them, then what?”
The three men hugged up til the last possible second. Balt bolted up the stairs to Cas's apartment above the now closed bakery. Gabriel linked his arm through his. He leaned to kiss Cas on the cheek.
He found himself with his arms full of his mate. Dean took just a minute to let them inhale each other’s scent, and then he could feel the last thread of control he had on his inner alpha snap. Reaching down he grabbed Cas under the thighs and lifted him, before he turned and dropped him on the bed hard enough that the omega bounced, causing him to laugh as he looked up at Dean through his lashes.
“Dean!” He heard some coughing before Cas’ voice came over the line.
"Damn straight I am. Now, shut up and listen."
Now, Castiel, do you accept Dean as your alpha?”
He didn’t know what he smelled like to his mate, but he could scent that it pleased Castiel. Dean was excited to scent him when he pulled back and bared his neck to Dean. He buried his nose in his mate’s neck and took a deep breath. Dean was glad he was already on his knees the first time he got a true scent of his omega. Castiel smelled like everything Dean loved the most. The scent was his mom’s apple pie, full of  ripe apples, cinnamon, sugar and cloves. He would have to ask him later what he smelled when he scented Dean.
"Cassie, darling, can it. I talk to your alpha, get his number, or....I call Mother Dearest and tell her that her little, bitty omega has found his true mate."
Cas couldn’t help but hide behind his alpha as Alistair spitted his hatred at Cas and Emmie, trying to place the blame of his attack on
“I want you, Cas. I want to get to know you, your sense of humor, your passions, your fears, your dreams. I want to laugh with you for all our lives, I want to explore everything your heart desires. I want to make you feel safe, and at the same time, help you face your fears and banish them. I want to support you and help you make each and every dream come true.”
"You aren't getting your grubby mitts on our Bakery, you slimeball, Alistair! I would never let your wife take it over! Its' Cas' and mine!"
He knew that his brother was giving him an honest apology and he did like bubbly.
Dean looked longingly back at the gardens. He whispered, “Thank you, Charlie,” and thought maybe she knew it was more than just a polite reply.
, but any angel or demon can see my mark I left on you if they saw your soul.”
“Gabriel! You brought candy?”
**********
“No, Dean. We have been friends for years and I believe that will make this next step in our relationship so much stronger than just being mates. Besides, you’ll still be my best friend.”
Dean moved back towards Cas, actually putting the omega between him and his ‘huggy’ mother. He took a few deep breaths, trying to get his mate’s scent in his nose to calm his nerves.
Cas had waited for years to get his mark. It was more important to him than a mating bite. There were stories of Omegas, years ago before times changed, that were mated by Alphas regardless if they were soulmates. He couldn't imagine not being with his soulmate now that he's found him and to think of a lifetime with another Alpha? Hell on Earth. So yeah, Cas had always wanted his mark more than a bite. Now, he wanted both, tonight.
"Congrats!"
"Oh, my." He heard Cas murmur, and he watched as the omega walked over to sit on the other side of him, pulling Emmie into his arms and she immediately began grasping (and gasping) at the omega's wings.
Dean had no idea how he had managed to follow Cas to their room without taking him right there in the hallway. The omega was gorgeous, and he smelled utterly delectable. When Cas was fighting with the door’s magnetic key, Dean plastered his body up against his.
"I'm a rough boy
He took the stairs two at a time, not bothering to count the doors, and just followed his nose, since he could smell Cas’ nervousness.
“Well, I'm not a betting angel, but I will wager that you only have about thirty seconds left to live. Any last words? Do you wish to repent for your sins, for the evil you have done?”
<3Roo
I'm a rough boy "
“Dean! Oh, God! Come on Alpha, show me what you got!”
“Hold on, Sugar,” was the only warning he gave before he starting pounding into Cas. The only sounds in the room were the smack of skin as their bodies connected, and their rhythmic grunts of pleasure. Cas had to brace his hands on the headboard, to keep his head from smacking it, since Dean was slowly pushing him up the bed with his momentum.
And you will see
And all the love it can hold that’s all I can do
Bobby had been in Heaven for a few years Earth time (more like a decade or so in Heaven) and working in the main library when he met Mary one day when she came in to borrow some children's books to read to Emmie. He had been surprised that she just didn't 'download' them like the other angels did (hold book, retain story forever), but instead, did it the human way. Mary had invited him to coffee to get to know the alpha who was about her age, intelligent, kind, and interested in doing things the way he always had before he died.
After the meal (he finally put Emmie down in his lap so he could eat), Michael interrupted his conversation to send him some information. He had been speaking to Cas, when he suddenly went silent, looked away and listened to his sire.
Cas yipped when he found himself being manhandled again. Holy batcrap, that was hot! In an instant, Cas was on all fours with Dean’s cock very close to his face and Dean’s tongue buried in his ass.
They walked back to the living room to find Gabe laughing like a loon, while Sam was looking at Gabe like he
“On three. One, two, three.”
Wrapping Cas’ legs around his waist he leaned on one arm, and took his cock in the other to guide himself to his mate's entrance. Locking eyes with him, he waited until the omega nodded before looking down to watch, as the tip of the head breeched his rim. Shit! He didn’t know if he was gonna make it. Cas was hot, tight, and wet, making him feel as if he was being squeezed in a vice, a beautiful, seductive, sensual vice.
Maybe Charlie would become his friend. It would be nice to have a friend.
And maybe Castiel would allow him to visit his little brothers.
Dean's stomach dropped to his feet.
Dean held his omega with strong arms as he cried and told him of the attack: about walking home from work, being grabbed off a busy street in the daytime and thrown into the back of a van after Alistair hit him on the side of the head. When he woke up a few minutes later, he was lying on the floor of the van, tied up. He could see Alistair driving and the sicko was singing along with the radio.
When he heard Dean ask permission to claim him, he could feel the slick soak through his underwear and pants. He was nervous, but he was ready to be claimed by his alpha. Breaking eye contact, he let his eyes roam over Dean's body. He had such beautiful ink over his muscles, and while he wanted to spend hours tracing them with his fingers (no, with his tongue!), right now what he really wanted was in those obviously tented jeans.
“The archangel?!?”
“Cas,” he muttered against his glistening skin, because removing his mouth from Cas was damn near impossible at the moment.
“You’re about to find out.”
After he had purchased the figure, some comic books, and a limited-edition Dr. Who card game, Bal had taken him to get a milkshake. As they were walking down the side walk Cas caught a faint sent of an Alpha. He stopped in the middle of the sidewalk to sniff the air. The scent was fading, the Alpha must have walked this way hours ago. It smelled so good. It was a dark smoky whiskey with a honey undertone. Damn it was delicious. He turned in circles but he couldn't find the direction to follow. The Alpha was long gone.
Son of a
How old was he? Seventeen, Your Royal Highness.
Please note that tags have been added. There is some graphic descriptions of PAST violence in the next chapter or so during John's trial.
"Absolutely, love. Here, you give me our pup and I'll feed her plums while you eat, then you can give her some milk while I eat. After that I'd say she'll be out." He traded the pup for the tray then proceeded to get more plums on his shirt than in her mouth. It was more her fault than his, but she was
“Has Michael told you how many pups we will be having?”
People began arriving in the early afternoon, and his steward took care of all room assignments. Since the prince wasn't particularly interested in meeting with any of them, he let his staff take care of everything. Just because he was forced to host this thing, didn't mean he was required to look for a mate. Castiel retreated to his library and had the servants deliver his supper to him there so he could enjoy his evening in peace.
Charlie threw open the door and the angel fell into her arms. He was burning up and slumped, unconscious. Oh, crap. Next thing she knew she was on the floor with a six-foot dude in her lap.
And I ride into the city
“What?!?”
“Castiel!? What's wrong with our pup?”
He got a bit distracted by the gorgeous wings that were shimmering and all puffed up to protect Cas and to intimidate Alistair. The glorious white with green shimmers at the bottoms and a hint of black at the quills had him staring from the moment he had spotted his alpha, but the way they looked now just blew Cas’ mind.
Well, we've come to the end of this journey. Thank you so much to all of you who took the time to read, leave kudos, and sent lovely comments.
It was glorious. The prince had never bedded an omega (those were reserved for mates), and betas never managed to feel like this! Dean's slippery channel squeezed him and he thrust with a need he had never felt before.
He had been so scared on his way to the bunker, and so afraid that the hunter would deny that they were mates. After those drunk alphas had chased him, he was incredibly thankful to Mr. Roche for putting him in a cab with a beta driver. He had even paid for the cab, as well as sending some bottled water and snacks for him and the driver. He was a good alpha and Cas hoped he found his own mate soon.
“Hmmm....Yes, Dean?” Cas smiled at his sweet man.
From that day on Cas knew that his soulmate would be an Alpha. He had met several since that were cute and wished to date him, but he always said no. They were attractive, sure, just not the one he wanted and they just didn't smell right. Bal accused him of still crushing on the scent from that day and he denied it to his brother, but it was true.
Just then, the last of the intruders turned towards the woods to see Sam jogging out, looking as if he had spilled red paint down one whole side of his body. Cas couldn’t keep the whine from escaping his throat at the thought that his friend and brother was hurt.
He apparently had a type and Dean hit every item on his list. Tall? Check. Built? Check. Tatts? Check.....wait. Dean’s tatts looked a lot like the ones from the Alpha Review poster. Shit.
Dean took his time pleasuring his mate and was rewarded a few moments later when Cas came, his cock untouched, shooting his cum across Dean’s abs. He watched as the omega tried to catch his breath, giving him a moment before he began moving his fingers again. While he began thrusting in and out of the tight channel, he did avoid his prostate this time, giving him a bit of a breather.
The vision of this alpha defiantly glowering at everyone in the sun had the omega stupefied. He was perfect and glorious, but the sight became even better when the challengers stepped up and he proceeded to take them down, one after another. Castiel was efficient, graceful and brutal. He didn't waste any time before each opposing alpha cried, “Yield!” The prince was surprisingly talented.
While Dean was happy that he would no longer have to jump every time his Dad spoke, he was worried that John would be that much harder on Sam. There was only so much John could get away with before their Mom, Mary, would step in and put him in his place, but he always found ways to put down his sons. When Mary was busy with her Cherub duties, John would work his sons til they dropped. He trained them hard telling them that they would be warriors in the apocalypse no matter what type angel Michael decreed them to be.
While his movements were quick and urgent, he kept his touch gentle on his omega. He pressed him into the door by plastering his naked chest against the skin of Cas’ back and slid his nose from his shoulder to behind his ear, taking in his scent.
Charlie grabbed Cas by the hand and they ran.
“Understood. I have a younger brother who is an omega and I would feel the same way. I live in Lebanon and my main job is working on the restoration of classic cars. Very soon, I will be buying out the business from my uncle. I'm also helping my brother through school, and he stays with me when classes aren’t in session.”
He watched Dean walk out of the nursery to give him a minute with Hannah. He knew this wasn’t good bye forever, but he wasn’t sure when he would see her again. He needed her to be assured of his happiness and to change the way humans thought of the Angel Ceremony.
certainly improved his mood.
Dean could hear her call to his angel as she walked towards him. The crying got louder and the ball of pain in his heart burned brighter.
“Oh, yeah. Sure. That makes sense, Cas. I’ve seen the news stories about that, too. I just... Well, I'm not exactly thinking straight. I’m surprised you can.”
“That’s what I mean, Babe. I knew as soon as I smelled you years ago that I wanted to have pups with the amazing smelling omega that proved to me I did have a Soulmate, and it’s why I've never been with an omega before, only you, Cas. Only you.” He smiled at his mate then said, “So, whatever you want, Sweetheart. Now, we’re set for furniture, but if there’s anything you want to bring, we will change things at home. I want it to feel like home to you too, alright?” He started folding the shirts that had apparently been dumped on the bed, handing them to his mate to pack.
“No way, stretch! I’m just here to make sure my brother doesn’t get murdered! Why would I want a single alpha when I can play the field? You would look good on my field, if you know what I mean.” He shook his eyebrows suggestively.
“Nothing, Dean. She scared herself. Let’s go to her room. I believe she needs a fresh diaper and we should gather some of her things to take...home. What am I allowed to bring?”
After his statement to Zachariah, Castiel proudly marched to the large, empty space on the lawn and took off his tunic and boots. Dean had followed and took a spot on the perimeter. He felt dazed. Who would've thought a royal prince would try to claim him? He certainly wasn't anything special. Maybe he was still in bed.
"About half an hour and we can leave, Cas."
"Gabriel. Stop. It's alright."
"Shut up, Bal."
“I will.”
“What did that
“Tell me, please. I will do whatever you need.”
“That’s perfect, Omega. Come on, let’s go inside and get Emmie’s bag.” He leaned to whisper into his ear, “I can smell your heat and it’s starting, Honey.” He was surprised to find that he was beginning to feel overheated and quite parched.
There were so many pillows, sleeping and decorative. Blankets upon blankets were draped across the foot of the bed. He knew without a doubt that Mary had taught Dean all about omegas loving soft things, being warm (thank goodness, because it certainly was
After letting Bal know that he was going out with Dean after his next dance, he sat back and enjoyed a glass of bubbly with his brother. Bal did insist that he have Dean's number and he wanted to know where they were going. He was happy for him Cas knew, but he was still a big brother.
“Lay on the bed, Omega, face down.” The moan from Cas made Dean’s jaw clench, trying not to come. He watched as he laid down with his arms under the pillow, but his eyes never left Dean's. As he stroked his cock a few times he heard Cas gasp.
The omega whined, “Pleeease, Alpha…”
“Dean!?!?!”
One last, hard push is all it took for Dean’s knot to lock them together, and with a roar the alpha leaned down and bit Cas over his mating gland while snarling the word ‘mine’ over and over. Cas muttered ‘yours’ as his alpha cleaned his bite before gently turning them to the side. As Cas  began drifting off to sleep he could still feel Dean releasing inside him. They were mated.
“Damn, Alpha. She’s gorgeous!”
“Honey. Cas. I’m fine and so are you. You just fainted. Come on, sit up for me, Sweetheart.”
“Well, you see, ummm...The mark is no longer on your
When Gabriel sat down next to him Cas slid down so he could lay his head in his brother's lap. This was how they used to sit all the time when they were little. Gabriel was always keeping him out of trouble. He would sit and read to Cas for hours on hours to keep out of his step-mom's way. It was usually a good idea to keep her away from Cas.
“Will I be able to do that?”
“It was in my pocket, Cassie. It’s not like I packed for a trip or something, ya’ know.” He looked back at Sam. “I’ll pick it up, no need to worry your pretty, little head, Angel.”
“Cas, Sweetheart, I'm fine, just getting old.” Taking hold of his mate’s hands he pulled them to his lips to press kiss after kiss on them.
“Well, I particularly enjoy walking among the gardens. Did you get a chance to see any of it, perchance?”
Alpha Omega Meets were just that: a designated spot where upper-class alphas and omegas met and found their mates. Alphas showed up whenever they felt they wanted to find an omega to mate (or when family pressured them into attending), and omegas were brought to the event when they reached the appropriate age. For centuries this meant after the omega had their first heat, which averaged from twelve to fourteen years of age. In the last century, society had finally figured out that omegas bred that young (even though they were more fertile than betas) were more prone to die in childbirth and their children had a lower rate of survival. So it was decided that omegas were “ready" to be mated at least four years after their first heat, or seventeen at the earliest.
“It’s something my Mom was talking about.”
Thanks for reading this and I adore the comments!
“That’s alright, Cas. No reason to get embarrassed. Dean and his brother still call Mary ‘Mommy’ most of the time, although they pretend like they don’t.” Michael spoke quietly from his seat.
“I can’t heal you, oh Dean! I can’t heal you...” Cas broke off speaking to start crying.
"Alright, Dean. I'll help but, listen dude, you got this. Michael said you were old enough to start presenting to the Omegas. He believes you are ready to be mated and create new angels. We really need to replenish our numbers after the last war with the demons. Michael, Dad, and the rest of the elders are still trying to find out who supplied them with angel blades."
“That’s my favorite lip your abusing there, Sweetheart. Yeah, I'd love pups, anytime, but if we were to plan for pups, I’d want to wait til you were out of school and teaching. I don’t ever want to stop your dreams. Do you want pups?”
Cas could smell his mate behind him, and heard him playing peek-a-boo with Emmie,  so he did what everyone else had done, he tossed her in the air trusting that Dean would catch their pup (prayed), and he did.
"What?"
Cas followed Mary to her seat, sitting next to her and handing over Emmie to Mary’s own set of grabby hands. He huffed out a laugh at her antics but was soon distracted by the plate of delicious food set before him by a young man who gave him a sweet, shy smile.
Sam stood up and admitted to himself that he enjoyed the look of wonder on the omega’s face when he was finally on his feet. He knew he was one of the tallest angels in his original sire’s line. Michael was forever teasing him that he still had an inch or so on Sam’s 6’4” height. He looked at the shorter omega and watched as a myriad of small, wrapped items fell out of his hands.
“No, Omega. My elder brother is, though. I will be the one walking him through the ceremony. May I say, you smell more upset than the other omegas. Michael did explain what was going to happen, yes?”
Dean woke up the next morning feeling amazingly good (which for him was a miracle, he hated mornings) with his mate firmly wrapped around him. He could really get used to this feeling of belonging and surrounded by their combined scents. He was going to have to send Crowley a “Thank You” basket or something.
"The crowd loved ya', brother. Thanks for getting them all worked up for me. I'll make sure to finish what you started."
"Yours" was all he was able to say before the music began. He recognized it as "Rough Boy" by ZZ Top.
"And by the way, I'm setting up Benny before any of y'all assholes! Peace, I'm out!"
"Sure thing, baby."
He jumped out and winced in apology to Baby when he slammed his door, hurrying around to open the door for Cas. Dean huffed when Cas gave him an amused look. He knew he thought he was trying to make a good impression on his parents (and he was!), but Bobby would kick his ass to purgatory if he didn’t use his manners.
Once Dean bottomed out, Cas wrapped his legs around him and locked his ankles. He had his alpha where he wanted him and he wasn’t letting go til he got his damn bite. He knew Dean was giving him a minute to adjust and while he didn’t have any toys that compared to the size of his cock, Cas was anxious for him to start moving. He squeezed him with his thighs as he shifted his hips, dragging a moan from Dean, who quickly took the hint and slowly pulled out a bit before moving back in.
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
“Who was that?” he asked while cutting his steak.
After finishing his morning business and a cursory wash, Dean came around the corner where the servant continued her duties. The omega was dressed into his traveling clothes: loose, soft, brown trousers with a billowy, cream-colored blouse, heavily embroidered with colorful vines and flowers around the collar and wrists. Dean was proud of his needlework. The young man loved to work on the intricate designs for all of his clothing.
“Fuck me! You look so good taking my cock. Love watching, all shiny with your slick. Damn, Cas, don’t know how much longer I can hold on. I wanna be caught tight inside you with my teeth locked onto your skin. I need to mark you as mine.”
“Not bad, Dean. So, do you believe that my brother is your Soulmate?”
“How...how do you want me?” he managed to get out.
“You are named after angels.”
a loon.
"Gabriel! Shut up! We're in enough trouble without you flirting!"
He began a slight sway of his hips to the slow beat of the song. The beat then worked its way from his feet, up through his body to his hands. Dean undulated his body like a snake while moving his hips in a rolling, figure-eight motion which pushed his ass out a bit.  Dean could hear the reaction from the crowd and while in the past he sometimes got off on the cat calls, tonight he was only interested in one person's reaction.
“Yes, a bit of a snuggle, and then a few days with you, my Alpha. I hope we are going to pup with this heat.”
.” He had to swallow hard to keep from sobbing but he could see that Dean knew exactly what was going through his mind.
Cas sat up and leaned on Dean’s chest. He buried his nose into his mate’s neck to calm himself with the scent of home from his alpha. Now that it was over, Cas could feel his body begin to shake. He tried to stop but there was too much bottled up inside him and then the shakes were accompanied by sobs. So much had changed for Cas in just a day, and he was simply overwhelmed. He calmed slightly when Dean’s arms wrapped him up and held him in a cocoon of his wings. Cas felt his alpha placing sweet kisses on his forehead, along his nose, and kissing away the tears running down his face.
“Well, let’s get on with it, Alpha. I need you, please.” Hearing his mate beg did things to the alpha. Really
“Charlie, we are just about ten minutes out. We're coming in hot.”
“Cas, not gonna last too much longer, Sweetheart. Wanna feel you come on my cock. Please. Come on Omega, stroke yourself. Let me see you,” the alpha growled.
“Yeah, baby. I wanna wear your bite. Show the world that I belong to you, just as much as my bite on your neck shows that you belong to me.” He gave him one last, chaste kiss and bared his neck to his omega.
Returning the frame to where it belonged when he heard someone coming down the stairs, he hurried to help Cas’ mom (who insisted Dean call her Mom which was just...no) with a large suitcase she was ‘trying’ to carry.
The music was just instrumental and actually sounded like it was on a loop. Just then he saw, or thought he saw, the Alphas jump off the side of the stage. He smelled Dean just before he could see his shape coming closer.
Zachariah’s man laughed. “What? You're giving up now?”
Save a horse, ride a cowboy"
His purr started up with an answering rumble from below. “Dean?”
The idiot champion waved his superior off and declared, “My lord, please do not worry. The prince has had nine fights and is obviously winded, whereas I am fully rested. And you know I am more than capable of beating him.”
Dean patted the hand on his arm in reassurance. “I was listening to Michael, he was sending me a message. I'm sorry, my love. I didn’t mean to worry you. Umm...can you take our pup? I need to go do something for him and then when I come back, it will probably be time for pie, then, well...we’ll be dismissed.”
"Yes, of course, Alpha."
“What, Cas? What do you need?” he moaned in the omega’s ear.
“There is something that you need to know and I was told, ordered, to tell you after the ceremony . I was given assurances by Michael, your mother, and Chuck that this was going to be alright.”
“I will heed your advice, Mary, but know that if he hurts Dean again, I will protect my mate and our pups from him, even if he is his father.” He had never been so angry at someone he had never met, so he found himself glad to be distracted by Emmie, who was babbling.
“Alright, Cassie. Dean, I just want some assurances before I let you leave with the most precious thing in my life.”
Who was he to deny his mate?
them to be alert and he wanted them to fight back. Dean looked over at Sam and knew the look of controlled fury that he saw on his brother’s face mirrored his own.
“Did you do all of this?” The redhead indicated the simple spirals sewn into his blouse. He wore a traditional mating top with a wide neck and large, billowing sleeves that were simply tied at the wrist. It was deep green with multicolored spirals around the collar, loosely tucked into a pair of thin, tan trousers. Those were casually light and simple. Nothing to restrict an alpha from getting to their mate quickly and easily.
"What the fuck are you doing here, Al?"
Cas was sniffing the air letting Bal guide him through the tables. His eyes were roaming over the club wanting to find him. He heard his brother order a bottle of champagne from the waiter that was there before they could sit down.
“D...Dean? Hello, Dean.”
If Dean was lucky enough to have his mate step forward, he couldn't look at them until his Omega was standing in front of him. They had to the one to instruct the Alpha when he could look at his mate. When the Omega lifted his head to look at him the human would lay their claim on Dean by kneeling in front of his mother to thank her for giving the Omega such a blessing as her son.
Comments, as always are welcome.
Cas just pushed his ass higher and firmer into Dean’s hands and purred louder. As he put his shoulders down on the bed in the perfect presenting pose (son of a bitch!), he couldn’t take anymore, pushed his ass back down and buried his face between his cheeks.
Dean felt the shock when their hands touched skin at the same time. Their heads flew back, jaws dropped, and their eyes slammed shut as their marks were created on their arms. It didn’t hurt like he thought it would, but there was a shock, and then it almost felt as if there were ants crawling on his skin. He held on to Cas tight with the arm not being marked for comfort.
Crap. Double Crap.
The redheaded and red-cheeked beta that attended him in the morning was named Charlie, and was one of the servants in residence. She regaled him with reports of the Meet preparations, gossip about the other arrivals from yesterday and descriptions of the prince (wow, a prince?) that was master of Novak Castle. Apparently, that was where he was. Nice to know.
He heard Dean slam into a wall and shout “son of a
), but knowing and doing were completely different. Right now, he was relying on his instincts. Dean wanted to make this as good for Cas as he could. Taking a deep breath, he stared into those bottomless blue eyes, and listened to his gut for his next move.
Dean could feel the slick coat his face and run down his neck before he could even open his mouth. At the first swipe of his tongue, Cas groaned. Oh, yes, he wanted to hear more of that. In fact, what other noises could he get Cas to make? He took long, slow licks, tiny wiggles with just the tip of his tongue, and sucked all around the rim. Cas did not disappoint him, and the alpha delighted in the myriad of sounds coming from his lover.
Cas felt warm at the look Dean gave to anyone unlucky enough to be at their car. He let himself be helped into Baby and drank in the scent of the leather seats and the embedded smell of his mate’s sweet whiskey. He flashed him a wink when Dean got in and looked at him.
“Gabriel, come with me, please, and we will go get something to drink while we wait for our time before Michael.”
He purred some more.
! Oh, Cas!
Hearing his omega challenge him had Dean thrusting into his tight body, pushing his forming knot hard against his rim. Fuck, he felt so good. Dean had had lots of sex, and while he wished he could have given his mate the same gift of being untouched, he was also glad he had some knowledge on how to please his omega.
"Mick, dude. Last thing Dean is thinking about is finding you someone to dip your dick into. He just met his omega. Besides, if he's gonna set anyone up it would be me, right Dean-o?"
"I only want you to see me....."
"That's perfect Mom. Just you and me. We should leave here in about an hour to get there a few minutes before it's my time to present myself. You want another cup of tea?"
Cas could feel his face heat in a blush (damn it!) as he looked at his hands in his lap. He felt silly, assuming that the alpha would want to shower with him. Gently, he felt fingers tilt his face up so that his gaze locked with Dean’s.
He was thrilled to see that they had many options for burgers, since they made him happy. Cas decided to order for both of them, but stopped when he noticed how badly he needed to clean up.
“Cas, son, relax. You and Emmie are safe and, Lord help you, Winchesters!”
His omega turned to him as he said, “Mom, this is Dean Winchester, my Alpha, and my Soulmate. Dean, this is my Mom...Mom! Don’t hug him to death!”
Charlie heard the pounding on the door and she fell out of her chair in surprise. No one should be here with the boys being in Vermont, neck deep in vamps. She grabbed her gun and stealthily moved up the stairs to the door, and snorted when she realized that she was being ridiculous, because whoever is here can’t see her. When she got to the door, she heard an omega whimpering. She could actually smell their distress through the door.
wet diaper. I think she'll nap after her fruit, because she played hard this morning, Dada. Michael left a bouncy castle for her-us, and a pool too." He couldn't wait for a late night skinny dip with his omega.
Well, then. “Sir, my father had arranged for me to mate with Lord Zachariah—the baron—without the king's permission, but the Alpha Omega Meet invitation from the king came a month before my seventeenth birthday. My father had no choice but to bring me. When I said I shouldn’t have been surprised to see him, I meant that he didn't get me like he planned, so it makes sense that he's here. He obviously still wants an omega.”
“Dude, chill. I had to help a fellow omega out.”
“His name is Castiel, and he is very beautiful, for a human. I believe he is your ‘type’. He stands a few inches shorter than you and he is very fit. Blue eyes and dark hair, that should mix with your looks for some adorable fledglings. He is carrying some type of stress and of course, there’s Gabriel.”
“When I was thrown from Heaven.”
“Yes, of course. Let’s go over to the couch, o.k.?”
They are so pretty
He gazed out the window for a minute collecting his thoughts, before he turned in the seat to face his brother. Dean wanted to see his face. He didn’t think his brother would lie to him, but he needed to be absolutely sure that Sam was alright with this.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled against his shoulder.
“Cas.”
His head jerked up. “What, Sam?”
“To their mating nests?”
“Yes, Omega. I am yours.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hearing his pup grunt, he looked down to see his baby's eyes looking back at him. They were a shade lighter than his with a tint of blue added, making a gorgeous teal--a true mix of him and Cas. The boy's hair was absolutely all Cas': dark brunette and looking as if he had been struck by lightning, for it all (and he had a lot) stuck up in different directions. He had his eyebrows but Cas' nose, and his lips were larger like his mate's but had Dean's cupid bow. Dean couldn't help how his wings kept shuffling in pride at how gorgeous his pup was and how strong, brave, and perfect his omega had handled everything.
The servants had packed all of his clothing and possessions (in the case he was claimed, there was no need to return to his home of birth), and Dean had been silently directed by his father to get in the carriage. He saw the baron's own horse had been saddled, so apparently he wasn't to have a travelling companion at all. Alone with his thoughts was a bit troubling, but it was a distinct improvement over his alpha’s constant, dark mood.
