And suddenly it’s so much worse than if his mother had told him that Dean is dating a guy because this is now about feelings. And Dean is famously incompetent with voicing his. Especially to someone like his father, who’s also inept in this area.
Bobby spit out the mouthful of water he had been drinking. “What in the blazes – ”
Dean smirked. If he wasn’t in any kind of physical trouble, but he still wanted Dean’s help… “What’s her name?”
The silence didn’t last long after the pizza was eaten. Cas decided that the best defense was an early offense, in this case. He took a deep breath. “Are you ready to talk to me about why dating me, or me dating, is such a touchy topic?”
Cas whirled around to face Dean, mouth gaping.
Eventually Dean reclaimed his boyfriend, and as Cassie left, his and Dean’s friends came to introduce themselves. Claire and Kaia met Jo, who had plenty of fun stories from working at the Roadhouse to tell, funny enough to leave the girls in stitches at Jo’s wild gestures and voice imitations.
That being said, Castiel was still a little pissed at Dean and was not going to make this as easy as Dean seemed to have thought it would go. “Okay, Dean, I’ll talk to your brother – but I want his phone number, I’ll contact him directly,” Castiel said firmly.
Dean spent the next day distracting Mom and Bobby from how absent Cas and Sam were as they researched; Bobby was definitely giving him some looks, but let it go, while his mom was more oblivious. Not that it was any sort of chore for Dean to spend time with them; he hadn’t realized how much he had missed their company until he was back home.
“And you might as well start now,” Bobby directed as he stood up. “Gotta start talking to your mom about asexuality, so you all should stay upstairs for now, okay?”
“Cas. From the moment we started talking here, almost fifteen years ago now, I knew you were special – I knew that I had to keep you in my life. We’ve been friends ever since then, and as much as I treasure you as a friend…I think I just hadn’t realized that I think of you…as more. Cas, if you’ll forgive me for being so dense for so long, I – if you’re up for it, how would you feel about going on a date? With, uh, me?”
Dean frowned as he stalked a couple steps closer. “Tell me what?”
And Cas didn’t seem to appreciate Sammy’s comments either, his blue eyes always dimming when Dean’s little brother opened his big fat mouth.
“You know how Adler can get, I just wanted him off my back,” she snapped, before turning back to face the table. (Claire did not miss the wink Bobby sent her behind Mills’ back.)
ull see
Dean frowned darkly. “My boyfriend’s a traitor,” he muttered.
Bobby sighed. “Guess I should start calling up their school – schools? – and see about getting them transferred to the local one here.”
Dean was nodding and humming in all the right places, but he wasn’t fully listening – listening enough to pay attention, but he also couldn’t stop thinking about how nice it was to see Cas so happy, so talkative. If it wasn’t about art, Dean had such a hard time getting Cas to talk to him; but now, now Dean had a secret weapon. And he was going to use it as often as he could.
“…Thank you, Sam, that was very enlightening,” Cas finally said. “I think Dean and I need to speak further. Thank you for your help.” And with that, Cas must have hung up, because suddenly, he was standing right next to Dean.
This time they weren’t visiting the Galleries for fun; they were here for an assignment. Their teacher had asked them to find two works to compare and contrast in an essay – works from different periods that contained similar themes or images. Dean knew that one of his works was going to be an Arcimboldo, considering the collection still in his room, but he wasn’t quite sure what he wanted to compare it to.
Panties.
Cas whipped back around to face Zachariah; if he looked at Dean, he was going to collapse, he just knew it. And he didn’t want to, not in front of –
Dean hugged him back, laughing, “Alright, alright!” He sat them both back up far too quickly for Cas’ taste, small frown on his face. “But speaking of – well, dating, I want…I want to make sure I know where your boundaries are.”
Cas nodded in agreement before refocusing on the adorable kittens playing behind the credits. Dean smirked to himself; he knew Cas would love this movie.
He checked in with Mary first, to ensure that he wouldn’t be intruding for the holidays, before making the call to his father, Dean right next to him for moral support.
“Alright,” Castiel sighed, spreading his arms, “impress me.”
“That’s definitely not the case, Sam, just – just drop it!” He growled before hanging up.
And when Lee accidentally found out that Dean’s nipples were sensitive – well. Nothing would do after that but Dean crawling into Lee’s lap, Dean’s back to Lee’s chest, so that Lee could rub up against Dean’s panties, whisper all sorts of nicknames and praise into his ear, and play with his nipples all at the same time.
“Yep,” Bobby replied casually. “Now shoo, you and Sam go – play cards, or something, but get out of my kitchen. Don’t let him peek, Samuel!” he called sternly as Sam raced out of the kitchen, Dean sulkily following.
“Neither did Castiel,” Sammy smirked. “Gabriel’s probably an audio learner, not visual like you, and it didn’t even occur to him that a new actor might need a different method of learning. Talk to Castiel about it tomorrow – ten bucks says you’ll have the choreo down in no time.”
The sheriff rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah, heard it before. I can always head over to Bobby’s if I bother you that much.”
“Ah, Castiel! It only took two calls this time to wake you up – progress!” came his father’s smug voice.
Dean flushed a light pink. “I, uh…guess I never said, huh. Or really mentioned it at all, otherwise. Um. Shit. Well, let me start off by saying that just because I like it doesn’t mean you’re in any way obligated to like it too, it’s not like I haven’t put it aside for a couple years at this point anyway, so – just, don’t pretend for me, okay? Promise?”
“That’s actually really helpful advice,” Dean chuckled wryly. “Thanks, Lee – and good luck.”
“I am definitely talking with James and Amelia,” Irene declared firmly. “Can’t let those two get separated now.”
“I mean…I’m with you on that one, but once Dean gets an idea in his head…” Sam trailed off.
Dean smirked. “You sure?”
Bobby sighed. “Communication is important, kid, but honesty might be more important – if this has been bothering you, you probably should have this conversation sooner rather than later.” Bobby squinted at him. “And the one about you being sexual while he’s ace would probably be a good one to have, too.”
Cas just cocked his head at him.
Bobby raised an eyebrow. “If you mean that I knew he wasn’t 100% straight, then yes.”
To: New Pain in My Ass
Sam chuckled. “No, I guess not.” He sighed. “Did you ever figure out when it ended? Or why?”
Instead, Charlie, the worst friend in the world, decided to stick her nose into it, and Dean, instead of explaining that he already had a plan, thank you very much, followed her lead. Then, Cas – Cas asked him to talk about the one thing he didn’t think he physically could, but…this was Cas. Cas, who made friends with his geek brother, who made sure to bring his favorite food to D&D, who always asked the strangest questions about pop culture, and who, apparently, just wanted to help Dean. And so Dean folded like a cheap suit and succumbed to Charlie’s threats, Sam’s requests, and Cas’ pleas; he was going to talk to Cas. About it all. Maybe it actually would help.
“And why do you say so?” Cas asked in his most deadpan voice, grinning wickedly as he continued to follow Dean, until Dean finally hit the wall of his bedroom and had nowhere else to go.
Cas waved a hand in irritation. “My interpretation of the saying is not what’s important here, Dean,” he growled. “You need to talk to me about this, now – or else…” Cas hesitated.
Just as Sammy predicted, once Cas started showing Dean the choreo himself, Dean picked it up pretty quickly. The single choreo, anyway. The partnered stuff was a little…trickier.
Cas hoped that Dean talking to him would be as effective as Sam seemed to think it would be.
Dean stared. “I – no. No, I didn’t think of that.”
Dean frowned and opened his mouth again, but Castiel merely scowled back and made the shooing motion more firmly this time. Whatever Dean wanted to say, it would have to wait.
Castiel sighed and smiled weakly. “Truly, Dean, I’m sorry, I – I had no idea you were thinking that, and – you’re right, we should talk about this.”
“Thank you,” Claire replied quietly, before shutting herself into the bathroom.
Cas stayed suspiciously silent.
Cas’ responding smile felt like it should have lit up the room. “Yes! Thank you, Dean. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Cas threw his hands up. “Dating a guy and dating an ace guy are two very different things, Dean!”
Sam stuck his tongue out at him. “For your information, Cas actually enjoyed playing Boggle!”
Cas shrugged. “I’m guessing a pretty long while.”
Cas wrapped an arm around his stomach. “But you are disappointed.”
Mary had decided on Sioux Falls, South Dakota for her new home due to the presence of one Bobby Singer. Bobby and John used to be friends, it was how he and Mary had met, but the two quickly formed a closer bond than John and Bobby had ever had – even after Bobby and John had an epic falling out and lost touch, Mary quietly stayed in contact.
Sam shrugged awkwardly. “He *is* kinda busy…”
As I mentioned, there will be a sequel coming next month - this fic was mostly dealing with Dean's family issues; next time, it's Cas' turn!
(Dean did feel a hell of a lot better after chasing Cas up and down the LED-lit concourses.)
Dean nodded.
A small part of Dean’s brain recognized that Sammy wasn’t alone, he was standing with the director of the play (Rowena Macleod, drama teacher and pain in his ass) and one of the leads (Donna Hanscum, a good friend who had been so damn pleased to get the role). Rowena had her usual smirk in place. “Our original actor for Link made some boneheaded decisions that landed him in the hospital and incapable of fulfilling his role,” she drawled. “Sam here has told me you can take his place.”
Seemingly to apologize for his earlier abrupt manner, Dean had arranged for them to watch The Princess Bride on his laptop. “This is a classic, Cas, and deserves your full attention,” Dean firmly instructed him before pressing play.
Cas was yanked out of his surprising train of thought by Dean’s tremulous “…Cas?”
Claire and the sheriff both turned to face him. “Yes, Sam?” the sheriff asked.
Of course, that was when the doorbell rang.
When they finally let each other go, both boys had large grins (and maybe slightly teary eyes, but neither of them was going to say anything).
“I’m not kidding,” came the unimpressed reply. “Talk it out now and set boundaries before you two rush into something one or both of you are going to regret. Ya hear me?”
Dean just patted him on the shoulder and pointed at the screen.
Sam groaned. “Of course, Cas is the first guy Dean’s had a crush on since his thing with Lee crashed and burned. Crap. Dean is not going to deal with this well,” he muttered as he turned back to look outside. “I have got to visit Dean sooner rather than later.”
Castiel hummed thoughtfully. “What you remember of the songs, let’s start there.”
“Sure, Dad.” Dean straightened up.
“No – no way!” Cas sputtered. “You don’t like me – you don’t even like men!”
And before Cas could say anything, he just took the top of the box off.
His testing hadn’t gotten off to the best start, but it also hadn’t gotten him punched, so Dean decided to continue forging onwards.
Claire offered them a relieved smile. “Thank you. It won’t be forever, I promise. I just – we just need some time.”
Kaia gasped delightedly as Claire whipped around to shoot a glare as Cas. “Watch it,” she gritted out.
Dean perked up at that. He liked looking at art, but Cas liked knowing about art – and the artist. Dean always learned a lot if he just asked Cas, “Yeah? What do you know about him?”
“Guys? Why – Cas, did you know your dad was going to come?” Sam asked.
“No,” Dean yelped, “no-no-no, please don’t. Just…maybe talk to Bobby? And be prepared for it – you know, happening?”
And after that conversation, Dean was suddenly less receptive to Cas’ touch.
Claire blew out a sigh. That definitely could have gone worse.
“Under Dean’s bed…?” Sam muttered to himself before groaning and burying his head in his hands. “Nope, nope I can’t,” he moaned before pulling out his phone and texting Dean, presumably.
“Hey, hey,” Dean comforted, grabbing his hand and interlocking their fingers. “I can take some parental nastiness.”
“Dean – and Cas! Welcome, what brings you by?” Mary asked cheerfully. “Bobby, out of the way, I need to hug my boys!”
As Dean drove them back to campus the next day, Cas couldn’t help worrying. Yes, Claire and Kaia were safe in the Winchester house – for now. He had the feeling that his father wasn’t done by any means, that trying to sic Jody on them was only the first of many tactics he had ready.
like a lot
“Cross my heart.”
Cas smiled at the heartwarming scene. Sam was so lucky to have such a supportive family.
Cas met his gaze, fear clear in his eyes. “What if we mess up what we already have? What if me not having sex with you leads to you wanting something that I can’t give you? What if…what if you end up hating me for it?”
Zachariah pursed his lips. “Well, you see – ”
“You haven’t earned nickname privileges yet!” Castiel yelled back, mouth moving before his brain registered what was being said.
Dean frowned. “Come on, I already know it, confirming it doesn’t change anything.”
Claire was distracted from all the food when she noticed that only a couple plates down – Kaia was sitting next to her, and Jody was sitting on Kaia’s other side and Donna on the other side of Jody – Jody was not only serving herself, but also Donna.
From: Lee
“Totally, Dean, I can do that. In fact, I’m going over to Bobby’s tonight – Mom wants the house Y-chromosome-free for Bunco night,” Sam grumbled.
Dean waved a hand. “I’m not worried about that, Bobby will get it and I bet Mom won’t even notice. But Cas – are you sure?”
Dean had let Lisa choose their first date – roller skating had been fun, if a little crowded and loud; not exactly Dean’s scene, but it had made her happy. Clearly Lisa loved it, and Dean had enjoyed seeing Lisa so obviously in her element.
…He just liked him, that’s all.
Cas sighed and patted the bed next to him. “Come on, then.”
“I’m fine, promise,” Dean interrupted. “Would you be okay driving us back to campus? I’m...really tired.”
“Indeed I do! Come on, sit next to me, they’re going to call the meeting to order soon. You look like you’ll need a guiding hand, and I’ve been coming for a while.”
Dean threw a hand over his eyes – he couldn’t let himself get distracted again. He was trying to make a point here! “Because!”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “So – your cousin Claire called you out of the blue, asking for a place to stay, and you volunteered Mom?”
Sam smirked. “You can say that again. But yeah, that’s basically what happened, and then…you talked him out of making what could have been the biggest mistake of his life. But talking about Lee today…I don’t think that Dean’s going to end up handling it well.”
“Yeah, Sammy?” Dean asked distractedly as he pulled up the next month on his calendar. He had shown Cas a couple Pixar movies by then, but it was probably time to at least think about adding in some Disney movies too…
“Castiel,” Cas replied as he shook her hand. “But Dean and Sam call me Cas, and you are welcome to do the same if you prefer.”
Dean sputtered. “Wh-why am I even talking with you about this anyway?”
Not that Cas saw it that way, so Dean did his best to explain to Cas exactly what had been going on in his brain – which, admittedly, was complicated and layered. It wasn’t all bad, was his point, and Cas seemed to understand a little better after Dean explained (yay for communication). Giving Cas a hug through his explanation might have helped too.
“No,” Cas frowned. “The last time I talked to them was before Thanksgiving, and we didn’t talk much aside from confirming that I wouldn’t be coming this year.”
“You’re…Cas’ dad?” Cas absently heard Mary respond as his breathing started to pick up.
As Valentine’s Day rolled closer, Dean was struck with a brilliant idea. He had a bunch of extra cash from working in the garage; why not buy himself a little treat? Despite his nerves, he visited the local mall with a mission in mind – a visit to Victoria’s Secret.
“No?” Castiel replied questioningly.
Both Dean and Cas were distracted during dinner, but even with all the thoughts whirling in his head, Cas noticed that Sam was uncharacteristically quiet.
“Sure, kid. Gonna unlock the door for him?”
Dean made sure to get a pretty equal distribution of his and Sam’s favorites, but realized that he wasn’t sure what Cas’ preferences were. He had brought a good assortment to D&D, but Dean couldn’t remember whether Cas actually ate that much of anything. He didn’t want to buy a whole bunch of things Cas might not even like, so he doubled up on what he knew he and Sam did like – maybe Cas would enjoy some of it too, and if not he and Sam wouldn’t mind.
But first, he had to talk to Cas. And not just asking him about the upcoming trip back to his house. He had to know Cas’ boundaries, so he never accidentally crossed a line or otherwise made Cas uncomfortable; that was the very last thing Dean wanted to do, so they had to talk about it.
Sammy’s sigh into the phone was long and exasperated. “Seriously? Do you listen to a single word I say?”
Nope. Nothing came to mind. “Nothing,” he grumbled, head hanging.
“Alright, alright,” Charlie called. “Don’t be jealous of Dorothy’s skillz with the dice, Dean, it’s not a good look,” Charlie chided, leaving Dean sputtering.
Sammy hesitated before saying one of the last things Dean expected to hear. “…Cas is worried about you.”
Dean blew out a sigh. “Okay, good. Secondly, I think – as boyfriends – while this is kinda sorta something we talked about, both Mom and Bobby made a point of reminding me honesty and communication are the best foundation for a relationship, and – I want us to last. So, they’re important to me; I want you to know you can talk to me, the way I know I can talk to you. About anything. Agreed?”
After his trip down memory lane, Dean was…out of sorts. He knew, if Cas asked the wrong question or said the wrong thing, Dean would bite his head off. But Cas was a friend – maybe, possibly, more than that, but Dean wasn’t willing to go there yet, nope-nope-nope – and didn’t deserve being the target of Dean’s building ire. So Dean was as silent as possible, willing himself to contain, contain, contain until he had a safe target – most likely his favorite punching bag at the gym.
One particularly hot makeout in the garage got interrupted by Sammy, and Lee couldn’t get out of there fast enough. Faced with Sammy’s probing questions, Dean caved. Yes, he and Lee had been making out a lot; no, he didn’t know why; no, he and Lee hadn’t talked about it – like, at all; and no, no one else knew. (Not knowing that Bobby had already come across them a few days previous and decided to not say anything.)
Cas gulped. “I – I’m ace too. And, actually, that’s how Sam and I met – Dean heard me say I was ace at a GSA meeting, and asked if…well. Asked if I would be willing to talk to his little brother about being ace, basically. Sam and I were friends before Dean and I were.”
“And most importantly,” Mary said seriously before tapping his nose and grinning, “have fun!”
“But…I guess, there’s still so much I don’t know about Cas. I don’t even know what his snack preferences are! Or his family, or if I’m his first boyfriend, or – well, a lot,” Dean trailed off, blushing as the rest of his thought, “what his kinks are” blared in his brain. Absolutely no way he was saying that in front of his mom.
“Oh thank god,” Krissy exhaled. “And – you haven’t finished it yet, right?”
“I’ve got just the thing in mind,” Cas hummed. “Let me just finish all the hot food, then I’ll go order it.”
“Please what, Dean?” Cas asked slowly, savoring the words and faintly noticing that his voice sounded noticeably deeper.
His mom smiled at him. “You think so? I can call Irene, see when she and Cas might free to come with us…”
Cas sat down while Dean paced, heart racing. He had to do this, he could – no, he *would* do this. No backing out now.
Dean held his hands up in surrender. “Wouldn’t dream of it. G’night, Cas!”
Dean took a couple steps backwards, a little awkwardly. The more distance he had between him and Cas right now, the better for his focus. “Because – because! Because I said so!” Not that the distance he already had was helping much.
Dean shook out his arms and straightened his posture. “Where would you like me to start?”
“Yeah?”
“Wait, brother?” Cas interjected. “I thought he was your boyfriend!” he exclaimed, before his face became even more red and he clapped both hands over his mouth, garbling something that sounded like an apology behind it.
The weekend hours continued to run together, Dean in performance after performance, then back to a week of relative normalcy (except for his evenings, no longer practicing with Cas; what did he use to do before that? He didn’t even remember) followed by another hectic weekend of performances that – suddenly – was over. They had given their final performance of Hairspray, again to riotous applause, and Dean was still a little in shock.
“Yeah,” Dean breathed. “Dad’s wrong.”
maybe
Dean perked up a little at that. “Yeah, that’d be awesome!”
Bidding Cas a quick goodnight, Dean made a break for the door again – only for Charlie to suddenly loom in his face, bright grin in place. “You have a choice, Dean Winchester. You sit down and talk to Cas tonight – or at the very least, make plans to talk at a better time, it is pretty late – or I swear to the geek gods, you stubborn bastard, I *will* lock you two in a closet. Capiche?”
“Poker tournament!” Dean and Sam cried at the same time. “Do you want to go ask Kaia?” Sam added as Dean ran off to grab the cards and the poker chips.
“Me too,” Cas whispered back. “She’s smart and opinionated and brave and – and she doesn’t deserve this bullshit,” he muttered as he twisted in his seat to check that the girls were still sleeping.
What he didn’t enjoy was all of Sam’s comments when Cas showed up.
“What? No!” Dean blustered. “No, we’re both dudes – that’d be – just, no!”
Dean snorted. “Of course they rolled out the red carpet for *you*, Cas, you’re family now.”
Dean smirked. “Aw, Sammy’s asking for tips on getting his first date!”
“I see,” Lee replied, smirk evident in his voice. “Nickname status and everything.”
“He’s at the university. We’ll head to campus, and I’ll call him when I get there. He’ll take care of us.”
Claire raised an eyebrow at Kaia, who shrugged but then nodded. “Guess I’m showering first,” the blonde stated as she collected her set of toiletries.
He knelt down eye-to-eye with his still-short little brother. “You don’t have to tell me now, if you’re really not ready,” he started quietly. “But Sammy, whatever you have to tell me – whatever you’re scared to tell me – I promise that no matter what it is, I will always be here for you. No matter what, okay?”
Dean stumbled back a step or two. “Because – because! Because I said so!”
John just chuckled. “Yeah – come hell or high water, I’m coming back by the end of your senior year and you and I will be making the trip out to the Naval Academy.”
Mary couldn’t help laughing at that. “Alright, alright, off we go – but not too fast!” she called as the boys started to race off, Cas tugging at Dean’s hand to slow him down after Mary’s warning.
He kissed Dean until both their heads were spinning, and their kiss was more like breathing each other’s air.
“Are you serious?? Did you even notice how, how – robotic you’ve gotten?”
“Would you say it’s a beautiful woman being depicted?”
“Great! See you two later. And don’t forget to let Sam know about this, Cas, he’ll help hold Dean accountable,” Charlie chirped as she left.
So everything was fine and hunky-dory, Dean living chin-deep in denial until Meg had to open her damn mouth and make it…weird.
Cas frowned. “All these?”
Sam beamed at him. “It went great! And Bobby said he’d talk to Mom, so I’m waiting to tell her til he gives me the all clear, but – I feel a whole lot better knowing he’s on my side.”
Cas sighed. “I know, I should have asked first, but – ”
Then he remembered – the restaurant wasn’t that far from the National Mall. He could walk over, visit the National Galleries – he hadn’t had a chance in a while. So he headed off.
“Hey Dean, what’s up?” Sammy asked distractedly when he picked up the phone.
Dean squeezed Cas’ hand. “I, uh…yeah, I think so. Basically…Lee was trying to help me figure out – well, how I felt about you. Figuring out what I wanted before I put my foot in my mouth – which I guess I kinda went ahead and did anyway,” Dean winced.
“Not much farther,” Dean replied. “Just a block or two, and then you guys can rest.”
…If only doing what was best for Cas didn’t hurt so much.
Cas was about to push it back under the bed – it wasn’t his business what Dean stored there, and he could always ask about it later – when Dean came barging in, hair still wet and a thick towel wrapped loosely around his hips.
“Not your thing, huh,” Dean sighed.
“Alright, girls, ready to head out?” Mary asked.
Bobby did raise an eyebrow at that. Dean had always been so careful in front of him and Mary, like he thought they were expecting him to fit a certain mold. Bobby didn’t care, of course – his boys were just his boys, nothing they could say or do could ever change that. But Mary…Bobby wasn’t too sure how Mary would react. She had always wanted her boys happy but…Mary was far more concerned about the status quo and the opinions of other people in general than the rest of her family (although she was certainly where Dean got his own unhealthy dependence on the opinions of others, in Bobby’s mind). So he could see her deciding to prioritize her son’s current happiness above all…or worry about his future enough that she might try to change it.
Their sex life, or lack thereof, going forward. Because Dean was not an idiot, Cas was definitely intrigued by his collection. On the other hand, to what degree was…unknown. And Dean didn’t want to assume…
Dean snarled wordlessly before spitting out, “Later.”
Dean shrugged. “Not if you don’t want to talk about it yet, no.”
Mary nodded, a little taken aback by all the information Irene was giving to a virtual stranger.
Which, as it turned out, meant that he got a decent amount of sleep before his father decided to call him at far-too-early in the morning.
Dean tried to text a reply, but he kept second-guessing himself and deleting anything he typed out. Finally he just hit the call button.
“Then let’s go,” Cas turned and started walking towards where Dean told him his car was parked. “We’ve got a bit of a drive ahead of us.”
Dean immediately snapped to attention, staring at the guy defiantly glaring around the room, as though waiting for someone to say something. When no one did, he smiled brightly and sat back, tension bleeding out of his posture.
Once they reached campus, Dean tersely instructed Cas where to park and walked him to his dorm, still silent otherwise. He only waved to Cas’ tentative “Good night,” but Cas had expected that – and the couple days of silence that followed. What he had *not* expected was the seven (and counting) days of silence, especially when Sam’s texts about Dean grew increasingly worried as Cas continued to have nothing to tell him. Sam wanted to visit, badly, but some big school project had come up and he didn’t have the time – which only left him more frustrated at his own powerlessness. Cas was on campus, but…every time he tried to talk to Dean, the older Winchester brother would wiggle out of it; he would find any excuse to be anywhere else.
Dean looked back at John and Sam before turning to Mary with a determined expression. “Dad’s got Sammy. I wanna see the lights!”
And for a few more weeks, nothing changed – Cas and Dean continued to spend most of their time together, due to Dean’s sudden availability.
Claire sunk lower in her seat. This might take a little while.
This was something that, even during the heights of his infatuation with Lee, had always felt…a bit burdensome, more like a chore than anything. Dean had a little brother to worry about, and his dates weren’t always the best conversational partners, especially when that topic came up.

RUBY clears her throat.
“N-no, Dean. I’m fine. It’s...it’s just…” Castiel takes a deep breath and runs a hand through his hair, closing his eyes and stepping back from Dean as he does so.
RUBY rolls her eyes, scoffing.
“Your hair. ‘S soft. I like it.”
"Quiet, you prat! Look!" Harry stops talking and turns to see the hare. It says in a soft, melodic voice, "Little Browning, Montana. A house by the mountains. In the center of the town. Find us." Then it disappears.
Dean always regrets that last fight.
You’re a useless- pathetic- excuse for an angel.
JACK bends down and heals the cut on CAS’S neck, then stands again.
We FLASH FORWARD and see Jack and DEAN standing in the middle of THE BUNKER, DEAN with a GUN and SILVER KNIFE in hand.
“Not much. The tree should be at the very top.” Castiel doesn’t even glance back at Dean, too set on his goal.
JACK ends the sentence with a nod
CASTIEL
Thank you, JACK.

He grabs Castiel’s face between his hands, and Castiel’s heart pounds in his throat, blood rushing in his ears.

It’s okay.
Thank you for freeing RUBY. I was going to, at least before-
Yeah, see? Your boyfriend said so, so you’ve gotta let me go!
Eat salt, bitch.
DEAN is ecstatic until he notices RUBY and immediately pulls an angel blade and puts it to her throat, one arm still supporting CAS.
I'm sorry it took literally exactly a month to post the next chapter, I've been having a Time TM & also working on other fics. (if you like this one, check them out maybe?)

Is everyone back?
The camera pans across the MAIN ROOM to the LIBRARY TABLE with the initials DW, SW, and MW, along with the names CAS (next to DW) and JACK. It stays there for a moment before it shifts, showing more names being added.
The music starts to fade, and through all this we hear voices and laughter. We don’t see anyone else until a small child, around 3 or 4 years old, runs behind  DEAN and CAS, a YORKIE chasing her and barking. DEAN and CAS smile at the girl and dog, and the camera pans to SAM and EILEEN.

“What?” Castiel asks, pulling back.
And another punch.
"Wait, you're a witch?" Dean says. I see him lift his blade again, and I hold out a hand.

SAM kneels down next to DEAN.
I cast a spell on him to ensure he is protected then turn to the house in front of me. I see a Death Eater, the one who had tried to kill Dean, staring at me. When I look at him he shoots a spell in my direction which I deflect with a wave of a hand. He calls out and two more Death Eaters appear from the house. I smite them all with a snap of my fingers, and their remains rain through the air and splatter the house.
Instead, Cas finally suggested a much more subtle, if simple, plan: Charlie should invite Dean to meet her for a meal – or a study session, *something* – and once Dean had agreed, Charlie could text Cas the details and when Dean arrived, Cas would be there instead of Charlie. If they were face-to-face, Cas was certain he would be able to talk Dean into staying and talking, no locked doors necessary. Charlie finally sighed loudly and agreed. She would invite Dean to discuss his D&D character leveling up, so they would meet in the same room they had played D&D in; Charlie would text him the date and time later.
Dean grumbled for a bit before caving. “I… Cas has been all up in my personal space,” he started abruptly, “and it was really nice, actually. But then he said he was interested in dating, and if anyone he might be interested in dating sees us all over each other…it won’t end well. So, you know, I’ve stopped most of it,” Dean half-shrugged, trying to play it cool before realizing Sam couldn’t see him and abandoning the gesture.
Dean turned around. “...Come with you where?”
So, to stay strong, Dean cancelled pop culture night. Just for one week, just to give himself a chance to breathe and practice being away from Cas (a state he was sure he was going to get awfully familiar with soon enough). He didn’t even have to come up with a way to distract himself that night; Charlie helpfully offered to meet him for a one-on-one session to discuss his D&D character leveling up at the same time as Dean would usually have been meeting Cas. She even split a George’s splurge with him (despite her weird insistence on cheese rather than her usual crazy toppings combo).
Both girls were, as expected, very wary of the gruff older man, but – to Cas’ surprise – the two girls were quickly won over once Bobby mentioned that he had gotten them transferred to a nearby public high school.
Castiel had heard of Dean Winchester; everyone in school with a pulse had heard of Dean Winchester. Devoted big brother, captain of the highly successful baseball team, could have run each semester’s auto class if he wanted to…and, apparently, now Castiel’s responsibility to whip into shape for the play.
Dean had decided that, in order to seriously think about Cas’ desire to date him, it was important to spend dating-levels of time with him. Which, based on previous dating experience was basically…most of the day, every day.
After school let out, Claire and Kaia met back up to head back home. “How’d the meeting go?” Kaia asked, wrapping her hand around Claire’s.
The line was silent.
“C’mon, Donna, I’m going to be doing it with you, it makes the most sense to actually practice with you,” Dean begged.
Castiel took a step back, not expecting the vehement outburst. “What do you mean?”
“Nope, none of them interest me, I’m trying not to think about it, can we just – ” Cas gritted out through a clenched jaw before sighing loudly. “Can we just walk around the museum without any more questions? Please?”
Dean’s smile grew even wider. “Great. That’s so great!”
Castiel – Cas, now, apparently – immediately straightened his spine. “Mrs. Winchester, nice to meet you,” he said quietly, smile slipping away.
Dean was a little worried about Mary’s unnecessary warning, but Cas barely even noticed it, so Dean wasn’t going to let it bother him either. He warned Cas not to snoop around his room while he got in the shower and enjoyed the far greater water pressure than anything campus had to offer.
He mulled over what it could possibly be while in the shower – porn magazines, perhaps? That would explain the rustling sound and some of Dean’s reaction, but not all of it, nor the lack of weight. Nothing else really occurred to Cas, though, so he focused on getting out of the shower and getting ready for bed instead.
Dean followed Cas’ gaze down and – somehow – his blush got darker. He stuttered some incomprehensible syllables before sliding down the wall until he hit the floor, wrapping his arms around his folded legs and burying his head in his knees.
Bobby nodded. “Anything I should know?” he asked Cas.
Dean took a deep breath. “I – uh. I don’t know how to say it. Donna said something, then Cas said something else, and I – I don’t know what to think anymore.”
“Uh oh, what’s got you all worked up?” she asked half-teasingly, half-genuinely.
“Claire. Who’s we?”
Dean grimaced. “I know. But dude, this is the first time you’ve been by yourself all week. What’s up with that, anyway?”
“I – I’m sorry? Martyr mode?”
In the moment, Castiel did – and meant it, but he forgot about how he was usually the last person kicked out of the library when they closed on Fridays and he was usually the only person left awake on campus for those stumbling home walks. Usually, that is; tonight, one Dean Winchester had decided to show up, and Castiel let his fatigue and annoyance get the better of him.
Not that he thought Cas would be anything like Lee, but…hindsight was 20/20. He never would have thought Lee would do anything like that, either, when they were just friends. Not to mention that Cas was ace, anyway – he vaguely remembered Sammy saying something about ace people not dating. So Dean just needed to ignore these stupid feelings; they would go away eventually. For now, he had movie nights to plan.
“I mean, technically yes, but – dammit Cas, the story is that we were friends and then I introduced you two because you’re both history nerds, alright?”
…How was he supposed to tell Cas that?
Cas sighed. “Big fight with your parents?”
“I’m fine, Sam, god,” Dean snapped. Sam blanched as the tone of voice registered, shrinking in on himself a little.
Speaking of, Dean pulled out his phone to give Sammy the good news.
“So, yeah, a lot of guilt mixed in with grieving, and then…Lee came along. And we were friends, it was good, but then – we kissed. And Lee ran away, so I figured that was the end of it, but…then it wasn’t. Next thing I know, Lee and I are – secret makeout buddies? I don’t know what we were, exactly, we weren’t exactly talking with each other’s tongues in the way,” Dean snorted.
“I’ve been trying to get you to tell me the recipe for YEARS and Cas gets to know after just a few days??” Dean exclaimed.
Charlie clapped her hands sharply. “Okay, people, enough chit-chat! It’s time we get back to where we last left our intrepid heroes – does everyone have their character sheets ready? Yes, good, then – we last left our intrepid heroes having defeated a horde of kobolds on their way towards their true goal…”
Dean opened the flap with the number 4 on it and chuckled. “‘Adventure is in your future.’ Yeah it is, Cas, a whole new art exhibit!”
Dean shot her a funny look. “Art’s more fun when you’re seeing it with someone, right? Isn’t that why you brought me with you?”
Eventually, Dean had to admit that he and Cas had basically been dating for a number of months (minus any sexual component that Dean had during previous dating experiences) and Dean was still excited to spend time with Cas every day. It was a great sign that their relationship would be better than any of the ones that came before, and it was time that Dean took the hint and answered Cas’ question that he had been waiting months for.
“Apologies if I sound like I’m rambling, dear, I just – I guess I’m debating with myself. If it makes sense to try and keep Castiel here in Maryland instead of letting him go back to the Bible Belt with his parents.”
When do you usually report for backstage duty?
“Very well, to business. What’s this I hear about you talking to your Aunt Amelia, yesterday?” he asked sharply.
“Not so out of the blue to you, huh?” Dean asked bitterly.
“Same to you, man – maybe we can get a coffee or something after the play’s over?”
Sam snorted. “Cassie? Where did that come from?”
Dean scowled. “Oh, you’re on!”
Dean pursed his lips. Okay, game plan time. Basically, divide and conquer – get Bobby alone and tell him first, then deal with telling Mom. But before telling Bobby, it was critical to do some groundwork; get the man some material to read and research.
Dean was so distracted he didn’t hear Sam’s yell up the stairs that Lee had arrived, Lee’s clomping run, or the perfunctory knock that heralded Lee’s entrance – but he sure heard the door open, just in time to whirl around and face Lee head-on. Definitely no time to hide what he was wearing – or, more to the point, what he wasn’t wearing.
Dean was in a daze for the next few days as he realized that his dad wasn’t going to let him have a say in his own future, that this was basically a done deal and there really wasn’t anything Dean could do to change it. He never really could stand up to his father – not for himself, anyway – and as much as he was dreading starting at the Naval Academy and all the expectations and pressures that would come with it, there was also a little, tiny bit of...relief. He wouldn’t have to worry about making choices when his dad was making them for him; no need to worry that he was making a mistake or doing something that would disappoint him. It wasn’t all bad.

“I – uh – no, not really,” Dean stuttered.
When Dean heard about the Arcimboldo painting exhibit that was coming to the National Gallery, he was delighted. “Mom, Mom, we *have* to go! And we gotta bring Cas, he’d love it!!”
She hummed in thought as they started walking through the store again. “Well, snack preferences seems like an easy one – just ask him the next time you boys have a movie night. As for the rest…relationships aren’t easy, Dean, and one of the best ways to create a great one is also one of the hardest: you have to communicate, and communicate honestly. I’m guessing that his family is definitely going to be a sore spot, so maybe don’t press too hard about it, but tell him about some of your family history, and your romantic history; show him that you trust him, and you want him to know about you, and if he’s the kinda guy I think he is, he’ll do the same when he’s ready. And if not – well, you just refer him to me or Bobby,” she finished sternly.
Dean stewed silently. How to explain this to his mom without getting too…detailed?
Krissy and Claire kept talking about FMA until the warning bell rang. “Hey, give me your number?” Krissy asked as they pulled out their phone.
“Right. Okay. I think we’ve been viewing the past few days very differently,” Cas started carefully.
Sam shook his head firmly. “No way. No, I don’t want you doing that for me.” He sighed. “I want to, but maybe…telling them is going to mean telling them *everything,* including that Dean lied, so we should definitely talk to him before we do anything.”
From: New Pain in My Ass
He hid the trademark pink bag in a much larger shopping bag he had purposely brought with him for camouflage purposes and rushed upstairs when he got home.
“ – was to talk to me, I know. But – I really enjoyed you being there. Not even just because you brought the best snacks, but…” Dean just shrugged. “I’d really appreciate it.”
Dean started to sputter something incoherent in answer but was interrupted by Bobby calling them down to dinner. Dean quickly stood up, yanked the panties out of Cas’ hands and shoved them in the box and the box under the bed before dragging Cas downstairs.
He finished putting the groceries away with the two adults, and thought about it. Did he want to talk to Bobby now, or check in with Cas and Sammy first?
Cas knew that both Dean and Sam were worried about Mary and her rushing out the door so fast; but he could also tell that Bobby was quite calm about it, which soothed most of his own fears.
“Lucky he met Dean, then – I swear the boy can make friends with chairs when he wants to,” Mary chuckled, shaking her head.
“Got it, I’ll get started on those calls,” Bobby grunted as he ambled off.
How long could it take?
Cas groaned. “You have no idea. And it’s not that I’m ashamed or anything, I just – they’re so awful.” He rubbed a hand through his hair. “I don’t – I don’t want to expose you to that. You don’t deserve it.”
Cas swallowed. “I’m going over to your house to meet Sam properly?”
Cassie blushed. “Claire! We’re not going to be – doing anything under his mother’s roof!”
Dean started to get up, but Cas held up a hand. “Not – not right now, Dean, please,” Cas whispered hurriedly before he heard the loud steps of his father entering the room.
“Alright, alright, I was a terror of a child and took years off your life, I’ve heard it a million times,” Dean grumbled. “Can I please go shower and get into bed?”
Dean sat down. “I just…” He fell silent as he tried to get his thoughts in order. “I want…I want Cas to trust me and tell me things now that we’re boyfriends. But – but it was so hard just telling him stuff about Dad and Lee, and I – I don’t want to pressure him, I just…” Dean sighed. “I just want him to know that I’m here when he’s ready to talk,” he finally mumbled.
“Hello, Kaia,” Cas greeted her, hand outstretched, only for Kaia to flinch and retreat behind Claire. “Apologies, I didn’t mean to scare you,” Cas immediately offered as he pulled his hand back. “I’m Castiel – Cas – Claire’s cousin, and this – ” He felt his face grow hotter as he cleared his throat. “This is my boyfriend, Dean.”
Sam was quiet for a second. “Okay. Okay, Dean, hit me.”
As agreed, Castiel waited for Dean backstage. When the new Link showed up, Castiel took him to an empty classroom.
So he was surprised when Dean suddenly brought up visiting his house again over break.
“You got that right, boyo. I’m sure someone here will be willing to give me a ride home later. Go enjoy the hotline to God you’re so convinced you have.”
“Fine,” Dean grumbled, “be that way. You’re a horrible boyfriend.”
Dean groaned. “That makes it so much worse, thanks Charlie.”
“You don’t what? You don’t like it? Or – perhaps – ”  Dean looked up at Cas’ pause, and noticed Cas wasn’t looking at his face anymore. “Perhaps you like it a little too much?”
Dean ruffled a hand through his hair. “Not that far,” he replied unconvincingly.
Claire blinked. “Hey, Sam. I’m Cassie’s cousin Claire, and this is my – ” She flicked a glance at Kaia before taking a deep breath and finishing, “girlfriend, Kaia.”
Dean cleared his throat awkwardly. “Yeah. Yeah, I – uh…I think it’s time the family met you as – you know. My boyfriend.”
Cas snorted. “Whether they are or aren’t, all it takes is an assumption on the part of her parents, and then – ” He waved a hand. “Then, it doesn’t matter,” he finished.
After breakfast, Mary suggested taking Kaia and Claire out shopping, to get some clothes and anything else they might want or need – new cellphones, Claire had muttered, after which Cas had made sure Claire was supplied with his credit card. The credit card that his parents paid for, anyway – Cas rarely used it, and he would have to come up with a pretty good reason for the charges, but it was far better than anyone else having to deal with it. Claire smirked when she recognized it. “Well, if that bastard is footing the bill…” she started gleefully.
Dean immediately forced an almost-natural smile onto his face. “Right, of course, thank you! I was just thinking about what else I should pack to make sure I’m the best prepared I can be.”
Claire had opened her mouth to reply when she heard a nasally reply from behind her.
Cas was frozen, staring at the phone’s caller ID like it was a rattlesnake as it rang, and rang, and rang, finally falling silent when Dean tore it out of his hands and mashed the decline call button. “Cas? What the hell?” Dean asked groggily.
From: Lee
Cas beamed back at her. “It was fantastic! And here, let me help – ”
Claire slammed her feet on the floor. “Don’t be a bitch.”
…Except. Cas didn’t seem to understand why Dean was suddenly giving him all his personal space back. Which. Dean was not going to explain it, okay, it was unspoken bro code and Dean was nothing if not a great friend; it was for Cas’ own good, no matter how much Cas’ sad face started to tear at Dean’s well-constructed reasoning.
“Alright, alright, stop making a scene in the middle of the store,” Dean grumbled, giving her a quick hug before hustling them to the checkout line.
“You a hundred percent sure about that, babydoll?” Lee rumbled in his ear as he roughly cupped Dean’s dick. “Cuz it sure feels like your bottom half has another opinion.”
“I – you can’t – you can’t just say stuff like that, Cas!” Dean squeaked.
“I see,” Cas nodded.
“Jody? What are you doing here?” came his surprised voice.
“Are you sure?” Dean asked quietly. “I don’t want to interrupt your museum visit…”
Dean just blinked as he tried to process that.
“But you don’t find her sexually desirable, do you?”
But if anyone deserved that kind of grand gesture, it was Cas. No matter what his mom might think or say, Cas was important enough to him that he refused to hide it from his family. No matter how she reacted, Cas was worth just about anything. So telling her, and the rest of the family, it was.
He couldn’t help himself; he had to try them on. Now. So that’s what he did, stripping down and slipping on the smooth underwear. He had guessed right, the panties fit him like a glove, cupping his ass and rubbing his dick in a really…new way. He angled himself in the mirror, looking at himself and just…enjoying the feeling.
Cas sighed. “Just not too outrageous, please? I am still going to have to come up with an explanation at some point.”
Then, with only a couple weeks of summer left, the letter came.
“Oh.” Mary replied blankly before hugging the boys again. “That’s – really great, kids, I’m happy for you!” She then stepped back. “This means a celebration! Let me head into town and get something nice, the fridge is pretty much empty here,” she laughed into the sudden awkward tension. Dean and Cas took that as their cue to escape further into the house.
By the time they wrapped up, even with all Cas’ jerky to keep up his energy during the session, Dean was *exhausted.* He just wanted to get some sleep, then talk to Cas until his face turned blue, once he had full control of his brain and tongue again.
Dean…well, maybe it made him less of a man in men like his father’s eyes, but he enjoyed every minute. He had no idea he was so damn kinky before this, but it blanked out his mind like nothing else, so he just enjoyed the ride.
The smug grin on his – on Zachariah’s face was unbearable. “My mother finally accepted a Christmas invitation, Castiel! Couldn’t have a family Christmas without my son around, of course.”
Claire scowled while Kaia’s entire stance stiffened. “You really wanna know, asshole?”
Claire let all the names and orientations wash over her – it wasn’t a very mixed bag, mostly lesbian women and gay men, with Kimberly and only a couple other people deviating from the pattern.
When Dean finished, he gave a theatrical bow. Castiel clapped his hands grudgingly. “Okay, admittedly, that was well done. You got me there. Now, I’ve got the script here – let’s see how well you know the lines.”
Cas beamed at him. “He agreed! I’m spending the holidays with you and your family!”
Dean’s shoulders relaxed a little. “Good. Good, that’s – great. Um.” Dean flushed. “This one is going to be the hardest, but – you’re gonna need to give me something after I’m done, so just…bear with me for a little longer.”
When he was back online, he felt his face get hot. “Cas! I told you, you can’t – you can’t just say stuff like that!”
“You’ve always been emotionally constipated, Dean,” was her extremely unhelpful reply. “Luckily Lee has a number of levels on you in that department and said something.”
Of course she got to the store and was immediately struck by the fact that she didn’t know what Cas liked to eat! What if she got something he wouldn’t even like, or was allergic to, or –
But Dean tried to put it out of his mind, tried to focus on making the most of his last summer of freedom – going to the movies with Sammy, flirting with cute girls at the local hangouts, eating his body weight in pie and popsicles, swimming and laughing and helping his mom with dinner, Bobby grumbling in the background…
“Yeah. Yeah, let me ask her,” Claire smiled as she headed off herself.
(He never figured out that Sam hovered by the door any time Lee came in with Dean, watching to see when Lee left so he could go give his brother the aftercare Lee was neglecting. Just because he was asexual didn’t mean he couldn’t look things up on the Internet. After the first few times Sam clocked Dean as being especially grumpy after Lee left – and knowing at least a little bit of what they were up to, because Dean was not very good at hiding all the new…additions to his wardrobe, which Sam wished he never had to know about – he looked up Dean’s symptoms and stumbled onto a BDSM webpage on aftercare. Sam knew that Dean would never talk to Lee about what he needed – too much the macho man, still – so Sam just quietly took the task on himself.)
Admittedly, Sam did have quite large portions of everything in front of him, Cas noticed, but he didn’t say anything. Eventually Mary stepped in and promised that Dean would make more for Sam later *if* he ate everything in front of him and was actually still hungry. Both boys grumbled but accepted the compromise.
…And with that, Dean started to really, truly fall in love with Castiel Adler.
Sam turned to look at Bobby. “What has Cas got to do with it?”
Castiel stared at him. “They’ve been worried about the guy stalking me!” The “you idiot” ending to the sentence was strongly implied.
Dean growled angrily. “Look, it’s fine if – if what I said last week upset you or whatever, but I wish you’d just *say* it instead of withdrawing or whatever!”
Maybe, one day, she and Kaia would know each other that well too. Claire squeezed Kaia’s hand under the table. “I’m so glad we ended up here,” she whispered.
Cas nodded enthusiastically; this was something he had been meaning to bring up soon, if Dean hadn’t, so to hear it from Dean like this was a huge relief.
He cut himself off at the look on Lisa’s face. “…or not.”
She gave him a wide, shark-like grin. “Excellent. Ta, boys,” she called as she stood glided regally off into the crowd.
“Well, as it so happens, you’re in luck – there was an amazing restaurant in the area I heard about recently,” Cas offered. “If you want to try it with me?”
Dean just stared blankly until Bobby groaned and took off his trucker cap, rubbing a hand over the top of his head. “I was hoping I wouldn’t have to do this,” he muttered tiredly before pulling a handful of –
“Wow...” Cas breathed, shocked. “That’s…that’s big, for them.”
By the evening, after dinner, they were ready. They were going to talk to Bobby, together, the next chance they could.
To: Lee
Cas smiled gently. “As long as you end up with everything that you need and at least a couple things you two want, I’ll think of something to tell them.”
Dean’s breath caught at that, and his dick started getting interested in the proceedings.
Dean blew out a breath. “You think they’re dating, then?”
Cas turned to blink at Sam. Had that actually just happened?
Dean buried his burning face into Cas’ shoulder as Cas sighed. “No traumatizing my boyfriend, please, Claire.”
“Or you’re in denial still, perfect,” Lee groaned. “Anyway. Think about it. And let me know when you get your head out of your ass – I’m still your friend.”
Dean laughed awkwardly. “Me? No, no.”
Cas flushed as he realized what Mary had been implying. “Oh.”
But apparently that wasn’t what Dean wanted, since the other boy finally said something the last day before the public performances were going to begin. “Alright, Castiel, what the hell is going on?”
Dean flushed another couple shades of red. “Bobby!”
After confirming that Cas would stay quiet while Dean got through all the things he wanted to say, Dean decided to start with what he was probably most worried about – asking about Cas’ past. Or, at least, asking Cas to consider trusting Dean with his past, so that Dean could do for Cas what his boyfriend had done for him. Dean felt like it all came out a little jumbled, but at least Cas didn’t seem angry or upset. So point to Dean.
Dean winced. “I’ve been a pretty horrible boyfriend, huh?”
After Cas and Dean had carefully woken the girls, letting them know they had arrived at the Winchester household, they waited until the two teens – more specifically, Claire – had squared her shoulders and entered the house like she was expecting a fight, Kaia her quiet shadow trailing behind.
(And it was. It really, really was.)
Dean stayed silent.
Dean opened his mouth to reply but quickly shut it at Bobby’s stink-eye, huffily pocketing the condoms and fleeing the scene.
No wonder Dean enjoyed it when he walked through the door.
Dean just raised an eyebrow.
Cas wasn’t sure how he could help Dean, not really, but…a hug couldn’t hurt. And the way Dean melted into it…it did seem to really help. Cas started to wonder if Dean was touch-starved, and resolved to try and alleviate it going forward. It was the least he could do.
“I – Sammy, I don’t know if I can actually say this to Cas’ face. You’re – you’re my test run, okay?”
Cas grumbled but couldn’t deny the truth of that statement, so he dragged himself out of bed and got ready to face the day. Well, ready to drink a few cups of coffee, anyway.
Krissy looked down at Claire’s doodles and lit up. “No way! Isn’t that from Fullmetal Alchemist?”
Dean and Sam looked at each other and shrugged. “I don’t know who started it, it’s just – something that happened.”
Dean glanced back at Cas before stepping closer to Donna. “Look,” he hissed, “it – it would be weird, alright? Just – please.”
Dean was in the middle of taking Cas’ order when Sam came over and peered carefully at Cas. “Wow, Dean, you were right -Cas *does* have the bluest eyes I’ve ever seen.”
Dean had made sure to text Lee in the whirlwind of leaving – he wasn’t sure if his friend was ready to see him yet, considering their relationship shift, but at least over text he was able to properly apologize. And Lee seemed to have accepted it fully – he was even talking about another guy, a cute geek that was in one of his basic requirement classes.
After a second, Cas responded, “Sam says you’re a jerk.” And with that, Dean was off, insulting everything from Sam’s taste in music to his getting-way-too-long-hair and his bad-news-friends (not Cas, of course, never Cas) and Dean was so busy being outraged and coming up with insults that he forgot to be nervous.
Sammy rolled his eyes. “Let me guess. Castiel’s been talking you through it, right?”
Lee grinned and licked his lips. “What can I say? I’m a lucky man, and it’s time everyone knew it,” he leered.
Underwear.
“…What?”
Cas blinked. That was not the tack he had expected, so his answer came out more bluntly than intended. “No.”
Still couldn’t stop himself from doing it though. Not until Charlie showed back up and smacked his arm. “Really Winchester?? I was gone for what – ten minutes?”
Lisa smirked at him. “Good answer.”
Cas growled. “Those things may be important, but so is my time! It’s *my* responsibility to whip him into shape now, and that is going to take more than a random schedule based on his whims and limited free time!”
2nd of all, what do u mean when?
“Yeah, thanks,” Claire muttered, shuffling into a closer chair. “…It was the right thing to do.”
As the time to talk grew closer and closer, Dean couldn’t pay attention in class. (He would have to get the notes later.)
Cas cleared his throat. “As it happens, it was true at the time – but. Things can change. I wouldn’t take it as an absolute or anything.”
...Her insistence made sense when Dean found himself locked in a room with Castiel, he of the picky tastebuds. At first Dean thought Cas was in on it, but Cas was quick to defend himself and Dean had to admit, it wouldn’t be the first time Charlie had gone rogue and betrayed him. (Probably wouldn’t be the last either, if Dean was being honest with himself. Which he wasn’t, at the moment, so he could shove that thought aside for another day.)
Mary smiled down at him. “Wish I could take all the credit, but it was Bobby’s idea.”
Cas tightened his own grip. “Yeah, me too.”
…So of course, right as he got settled and ready to play, who else but Cas walked in. Dean was all ready to get up and go, claim a sudden onset sickness, but Cas…Cas had bought his favorite jerky. Not just his favorite brand, but a number of his favorite flavors.
“But?”
“Hmm, interesting point, son,” Zachariah mused. “Alright. Alright, I’ll tell your mother, aunt and uncle the news. Merry Christmas.”
His father had always been like this – cold, calculating, taking pleasure in the downfall of others…and unfortunately, they were some of the many traits his parents had in common. They had always reveled in the failures of others, taking the opportunity to remind Cas that he was not to allow himself to become like them. And for his entire school career, Cas had been able to deliver the perfection that they required – perfect grades, chaste dates with his friend (and fellow member of the local church) Hannah, victories on the track field…
“Privacy?” Cas eked out around a huge yawn.
Finally they got to Cas’ house. Cas got in the backseat with Dean and Cas’ grandma got in the front seat, and then they were off to the museum!
“Oh, you’re on, bitch,” Dean retorted, cracking his knuckles.
congrats man!!
Dean immediately threw his keys at Cas. Cas huffed when they hit the floor and he had to bend down to pick them up (“handing people things instead of throwing them at them, Dean, it’s not that hard,” he’d told Dean more than once before) but he didn’t say a word as he walked off.
“What’s up, Cas, am I going too fast?” Sam asked.
“*That’s* what you’ve been stalking me for weeks over??” Castiel exclaimed incredulously.
Dean, of course, continued to ignore his little brother’s misunderstanding of the situation. Cas hated it the one time Dean really tried to flirt with him, getting uncomfortable and asking him to stop - clearly, that wasn’t why he kept coming back.
Dean’s roommate spent most of his time in his girlfriend’s room, so usually their pop culture nights were in Dean’s room, but tonight Cas’ roommate was going out to a party, so Cas offered to host for the night. Dean quickly agreed – Cas’ father had insisted on getting Cas a nicer mattress than the school offered, not to mention a nice headboard. Cas was embarrassed at the lengths his father had gone to, but enjoyed getting to share in the luxury with Dean.
The two girls exchange glances, Kaia’s fearful while Claire’s fell somewhere between pleading and encouraging, before turning to face Cas and nodding.
“They’re just…so freaking awesome, Mom,” Dean replied distractedly.
“Because unfortunately for you, you’re a stubborn ass who can overreact and Cas didn’t want to make whatever’s going on worse, so he came to me first for advice. Do you want to talk it out with me first, or just go straight to Cas?”
Sam groaned. “Yeah, Dean, I know. Why are you talking to me instead of Cas about it?”
“Yes, as I told her.”
Castiel nodded but internally decided not to give Dean the chance to ask his question. Surely it couldn’t be that hard to avoid one student in a school of over 10,000?
Castiel smiled back. “Thank you, I appreciate it.”
As the day of his trip home with Cas came closer and closer, Dean felt himself growing increasingly nervous. So instead of letting himself get psyched out and claim that something had happened at home so they couldn’t go (because he knew Cas would be disappointed but understanding and Dean would drown in his guilt), he called Sammy.
They’d ended up at different colleges, to the surprise of many who knew them. Dean planned to major in either physics or architecture at Cornell (or maybe both, he could if he really put his mind to it) and took art history (again) his first semester to fulfill a requirement (not to mention adding a little bit of familiarity to help ease him into this wild new world of college life). Cas, on the other hand, was planning to major in comp sci at MIT – and continue to work as a theatre tech behind the scenes of school plays (he was considering a minor in theatre or drama). Despite meeting so many new people and juggling such different schedules, Dean and Cas still kept in close contact through texting and video chats – and while Thanksgiving break had been too short and chaotic to properly meet up, they made surefire plans to do so over winter break, when they would have plenty of time.
Castiel sighed. “Why? I’m not interested in dating right now.”
Cas stilled. “...Did Sam not tell you?”
Dean scrubbed a hand through his hair. “I – um. I think so. Mostly. Uh. This…this is not a great topic.”
“Yes, I – I agree. There should be a spare classroom still open down the hall?”
Dean offered Cas a hand up from his seat. “Then let’s go.”
“Hmm. That’s actually not a bad idea,” Dean mused. “He’ll be more helpful than you, anyway.”
When they got down there, Mary and Sam were up but neither of the girls nor Bobby were in the kitchen. “I sent Bobby a text, warning him about our new houseguests, and he thought he should probably wait til dinner to make an appearance,” Mary told them before either of the boys could ask.
“Cas? About me?”
Soon Meg and other friends of his started telling Castiel that they had been – interrogated, was the word most of them used – by one Dean Winchester. Asking about Castiel’s habits and personality and interests and...all sorts of things that made Castiel more and more nervous about Dean’s intentions.
As the movie entered its climax, the cats finally home in Paris only to be confronted by the greedy butler at the last minute, Cas was starting to get agitated, grumbling insults at the horrible man.
Sam sighed after they all let go. “Now I just need to tell Mom. Any ideas how best to do that, Bobby?”
He snapped out of it when Cas took his phone out of his unresisting hand. “Hi Sam, this is Cas. Yes, I’ve been here the whole time, but I couldn’t hear your side, so – ”
Possibly-Straight Student snapped to attention at that, and stared at him on and off for the rest of the meeting. When the meeting was wrapping up, Castiel noticed that P.S.S. was slowly heading his way. “Meg – I should probably get going,” he said, slowly backing away even as he tried to be subtle about it.
To: New Pain in My Ass
Bobby pulled up two chairs and sat himself down. “What’s got you so twisted up, kid?” Bobby asked gruffly but not unkindly.
Dean sulked his way to the living room, Sam smirking as he brandished a deck of cards. “Bet you can’t beat me at Gin,” Sam taunted.
“You think?” Cas sarcastically replied. His hands, which were still planted on either side of Dean’s neck, pulled the hunter back down and he began peppering soft kisses all over Dean’s freckled face.
Dean was bad with words, but he was good at this. Cas had never had a birthday gift before, and Dean would be damned if he didn’t get the absolute best. Dean knew that if he wanted Cas to truly know how much he cared for him, he should flat-out tell the former angel. After all, Cas wasn’t always the best at reading between the lines. But, Dean was taking baby steps and this was the first step. Hopefully, this would help him work up the courage to tell Cas.
John continues to tinker with the rear axle as he waits for Dean to say something. A long moment of silence stretches out between them, but he’s in no way going to be the one to break it. Instead, he’ll give his son the time he needs to decide to open up or not.
“Dean,” Sam said with a pointed tone that Dean already didn’t like, “It’s more than that isn’t it?”
The rare moment of unadulterated joy possessed Dean to reach over and rest his hand on top of Cas’ on the clutch.
Cas started to show a confused look on his face and tilted his head in curiosity, “I don’t get it...why would you go through all this trouble just for me?”
“Okay, you can look!” Dean announced as soon as they crossed the threshold into the garage. They had just barely made it without incident, having almost crashed into every wall on the way in and nearly tripping on the steps down into the garage.
“How did you know you were in love?” Dean mumbles to the floor, his hands still nervously fidgeting where they rest on his thighs, “I’m new to this whole thing, how do I know if it’s love or just infatuation.”
Despite being asked about it constantly, especially by Jack who insisted on helping, Dean hadn’t shared any details.
“And you really expect us to believe that you haven’t started seeing someone?” Mary, the caring and gentle mother of two, asks her oldest son incredulously. She’s sitting on the table-top of her husband John’s work bench, ice cold beer in hand, watching as the three most important men in her life half-assedly work on her ‘69 Triumph TR6. The car was a gift from John for their 30th anniversary last year. Dean had told her it was his favorite car to work on, besides his own beloved ‘67 Chevy of course. She isn’t sure she believes him but she’s even more sure she doesn’t believe him about his relationship status as he awkwardly stands in front of the hood, fiddling with the label on his near-empty beer bottle with a faint blush painting his cheeks. Mary knows her adult son well enough to know that he never blushes at the topic of dating, or in his case (she hates to admit) hookups. She also knows him well enough to know that he isn’t exactly the relationship type, but she still believes he’ll want to settle down when he meets the right person.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I could stand here and tell you what it feels like to realize you’re in love. But honestly son, I think the fact that you’re even asking any of this means deep down you already know,” John says with a small smile, surprised that Dean hasn’t looked away again.
******
“Thanks, Sammy.” Dean lit up at the compliment, taking a step back to fully admire his work, “It better after putting so many hours into it in such a short amount of time.”
After a few more minutes of them unabashedly staring, Cas was the first to break eye contact. Dean was left cold at the loss of attention, but then Cas was scooting closer and laying his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“Dean, I don’t understand?” Cas spoke for the first time since seeing the surprise, “This is for me?”
If Dean thought Cas looked breathtaking in the garage, it was absolutely nothing to how he looked right now. Dean couldn’t stop staring from his spot in the passenger seat.
Or at least that’s what Dean Winchester thought up until his parents and idiot younger brother start grilling him about his love life.
Dean knew without a doubt that that was Cas’ new moment of true happiness and he couldn’t help but smile just as wide. The warm breeze was in his hair, his favorite band was playing through the speakers, and the love of his life was sitting next to him looking like a goddamn dream.
Dean curiously eyed Sam, trying to gauge what kind of reaction that was supposed to be. “What are you? Jealous?” He finally asked after coming up short for an explanation for his brother’s confusing reaction.
“Well, I suppose you don’t completely know, but the difference is if it’s just infatuation, your interest fades pretty quick. With your mother, I knew right away that what we had was different from anything else I had experienced. I had never really seen myself settling down, not until I met her. Not only that; she made me feel like maybe I did deserve a happy ending. I may have doubted myself a lot, but I have never doubted her and me if that makes sense.”
John can sense Dean’s uncomfortableness, so he tries to take the pressure off the conversation a bit by getting up and fiddling with some tools on a bench next to them.
“Your mother told me something interesting last night,” John says in replacement of a greeting when Dean arrives at work the next morning.
“I’m...not sure really, but I think I’m getting there…” Dean answers after a long several minutes. He says it so quietly that John almost thinks he imagined it.
Dean briefly pulled away in order to admire the gorgeous man underneath him. His pupils were blown wide, perpetual bed-head even more prominent, and lips kiss-swollen. He was everything Dean had ever wanted, and he was all his. His angel. For what felt like the hundredth time that night, they gazed into each other’s eyes with matching face-splitting smiles.
Cas’ birthday was coming up, and this car was to be a surprise present, but Dean knew he couldn’t trust Sam or Jack (mostly Jack) to keep it a secret. More importantly, he didn’t feel like dealing with the teasing Sam was sure to give him if he knew Dean was planning such a grand gesture for the former angel’s birthday.
Sam let out a low whistle, “Wow! This looks amazing.”
Sorry I'm a day late, I was putting together my new dining room table after work last night and was exhausted when I was done but I'm excited about this chapter! Mary is one of my favorite characters, I'm sorry. I have a feeling I might change my mind on that...I'm only on season 13
With that in mind, he decides to tell his dad the truth...or at least most of the truth.
Dean thinks he's subtle, but Sam has always seen right through him. They have a talk in the Impala, but Dean won't give Sam much to work with.
I hope you like the first chapter, I had so much fun writing it! Ever since rejoining the fandom, I'm completely obsessed all over again. It's literally to the point that my friend is a Destiel shipper without ever having watched anything past season 2. These two are just beautiful messes and they deserved so much better. Thanks to my bestie Abi (larrycocaine) for helping me get my crap together and write, check her out! Don't be shy, talk to me in the comments.

(See the end of the chapter for
Cas didn’t so much as flinch as if this was completely and totally how it always was and always should be. And actually, it really was.
“Of course it’s more than that,” He admits, voice uncharacteristically gentle. He couldn’t even have hidden the fond smile taking over his face if he had tried. So he didn’t try. Instead, he looked Sam head on and let the implication sink in.
Even with Dean’s hesitation, John is surprised at how easily his son had answered. He expected Dean to shut the conversation down very quickly, so it’s a pleasant shock that he answered honestly.
Dean has been really happy lately. It's suspicious, which is why Mary is convinced he's secretly seeing someone. However, Sam's not so sure, and John just thinks they're all crazy.
First of all, this specific model was his mother’s dream car and he needed something to keep her memory alive. But the second, and the arguably most convincing reason was that Cas had told him, after much nagging on Dean’s part, that the only way he would junk the Continental was if he were to have a classic convertible.
They sat in companionable silence, watching the sunset, but really Dean was just watching Cas.
“Don’t make me take it back.” As if he ever could.
“Dean, I would say you’re definitely in love. That sums up exactly how I felt about your mother all those years ago, and still to this day. Cas sounds wonderful, when are you gonna bring her around? We’d all love to meet her.”
As suddenly as they had started kissing again, they had stopped. But Cas’ lips were now roaming Dean’s neck as he whispered in a sultry, impossibly deep voice, “But you love me anyway don’t you?”
“I...I never thought of it like that…” Dean whispers almost to himself, while a smile starts to appear on his face. It’s a smile John assumes he has no control over. It's one of those smiles that just sneaks up and you have no way to prevent it from taking over.
The day of Cas’ birthday had finally arrived and Dean was leading Cas out to the garage. Against Cas’ initial protests, Dean was standing behind Cas covering his eyes to keep everything a surprise.
Dean looks unsure himself as he hesitantly perches on the edge of the stool across from John before answering.
He instantly freezes like a deer caught in the headlights, worried about what his mom might have said. He doesn’t think she would have outed him to his father, but he also isn’t sure she would have realized it wasn’t okay for her to do that. He knows his parents share everything and his mom also isn’t good at keeping secrets.
As it turned out, lying to Sam wasn’t very easy anymore. Dean supposed it never really had been. Sam had always seemed to know what laid beneath the surface of Dean’s words, it’s just that normally he was polite enough to let it go.
Dean fixes Sam with his own pointed look, one that screams ‘what the fuck did you tell them?’, but Sam just shrugs and lifts his beer in a toast as a small smile quirks the corner of his mouth up.
Sam knocked into Dean’s shoulder and they both started laughing. After a moment, they collected themselves and Sam started to walk around the car inspecting Dean’s handiwork.
Dean hated how he couldn’t even look at Cas right now, even though Cas had given Dean that shatteringly beautiful love confession all those months ago, he worried that Cas might have changed his mind. After all, they hadn’t talked about Cas’ speech, so it was impossible to know if Cas still loved him. And what if Dean had gotten it wrong, and that wasn’t the type of love he had been talking about.
“Not necessarily. Sometimes you know right away, but it’s okay if it takes some time too. But I think I pretty much knew with your mother right off the bat.”
The sun, low on the horizon, was illuminating him perfectly, the wind running through his hair, messing it up in the best way possible, and the smile on his face could not possibly get any wider. He was absolutely glowing. The thing was, Dean had seen Cas as an angel, eyes flashing, bright blue grace flowing out of him, wings shadowing behind him, and yes, it took Dean’s breath away. But it was nothing compared to this. He looked more ethereal than he ever looked as an angel because he looked at peace and genuinely happy.
ALSO, Cas is in the next chapter FINALLY!
“I- um...I think it’s probably too soon yet for Cas to meet the parents…” Dean stands up as he mutters out that sentence, clearly desperate to escape. Before he can though, John reaches out and pats him on the shoulder as if to calm a spooked horse.
Dean was surprised at the conflicting feeling that this was so brand-new yet also completely familiar. He responded with an arm around Cas’ waist, a hesitant kiss to the top of his head, and a “Happy Birthday Cas,” Dean took a deep breath, he felt that it was the perfect moment to voice how he felt, but that didn’t make it any less terrifying. He said it anyway, “I love you. And not the way I love Sam. Not the way best friends feel about each other. More than that,” Another pause, “I’m in love with you Cas. I have been for a very long time and I’m never not going to love you.”
Cas shifted slightly, lips still firmly pressed to Dean’s, as he reached his other hand up to rest where Dean’s neck and jaw met. As he dragged his thumb across the slight stubble, Dean deepened the kiss and Cas let out a small chuckle. Dean responded by smiling into the kiss which gave Cas the perfect opportunity to collide their tongues.
Dean casts his eyes to the ground, feigning interest in some old grease stain before he shrugs his shoulders. “Look,” He starts hesitantly, “It’s too new, I don’t want you all to get your hopes up. I’d really just rather not talk about it.”
It wasn’t saying it all, but as Dean watched the breathtaking smile spread across Cas’ face once again, it came to his attention that he had never said those words to Cas. That he loved him. Not even said it in a brotherly way. Not even said it when Cas had told him. Not even when Cas came back to Dean for good. Cas deserved to hear that he was loved every day. Dean promised at that moment to do better by Cas. To not just show it but say it. Repeatedly. He also promised himself to tell him that it was more than just in a brotherly or friendly way. He swore to himself right then that he would tell Cas that he was the love of his life. Soon. Baby steps.
I love how Dean describes Cas in this like omg how freaking cute right? (That really wrote itself I have no idea where that came from)
During lunch with his mother, Dean tells her about Cas.
“And I’m one of the people you love?” Cas asked, more tears gathering. Dean hated the uncertainty in his voice. He would fix that. He would make it his life goal to erase any doubt from Cas’ mind that he was loved by Dean.
“Holy shit, are you going to tell him?” At Dean’s nod, he continued, “I’m proud of you, Dean.” Dean rolled his eyes, an obligatory “no-chick-flick-moments” retort spilling out of his lips.
“Oh yeah?” Dean says nervously after a few moments of awkward silence, “What’s that?”
Now for the elephant in the room:
“When you know, you know. And judging by the shit-eating grin that just popped up on your face, I think you know.” John says. He abandons the socket wrench he was playing with and sits back down on the stool. “Tell me about her. What makes you think you’re in love?”
Dean took a deep breath, he was not quite ready to confess, but maybe he could gather enough courage to tell at least half of the truth.
Dean silently debates if he should lie; pretend he doesn’t know what his dad is talking about and act like the whole thing is no big deal.
They had made up a birthday for Cas recently as they realized he had never celebrated one (it was actually Jimmy Novak’s birthday they had chosen) and it was approaching in a few days. The car was on track to be ready just in time.
OMG first of all thank you everyone who has been reading!
As he braced himself and finally looked at the man he loved, the doubt was suddenly erased. The love in Cas’ eyes was irrefutable.
“I think you’re the love of my life.”
I hope this chapter was worth the wait! And don't worry, I've planned out the rest of the fic and started writing the next chapter, so it won't be a long wait again!
“So,” John starts, still unsure of how much Dean is willing to open up, “How long have you been together?”
Sam gave him a surprised look, but Dean assumed he was more so shocked at Dean admitting it and not so much about the context of the admission.
They drove for a few minutes longer, Dean absentmindedly rubbing circles over the back of Cas’ hand with his thumb, until the sun started to set. The only words between them were Dean’s directions that lead them down a short dirt road and to a clearing near a small cliff.
“I can’t believe how quickly you did all this! What was the rush anyway?” Sam quirked his eyebrow as he questioned the older Winchester.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean starts blushing even more, the color spreading down his neck at being put on the spot like this. He really would rather not discuss his sex life with his mother in the room, thank you very much. More importantly, he’s not ready to tell them the truth, but he’s worried they’re very close to figuring it out on their own.
This wasn’t part of the story!
"I told you Dean, it's warded."
Dean takes a swig from his current bottle, draining yet another flask of whiskey, before tossing it aside and grabbing his lighter and knife. He chants, moving in a circle around his pyre, slicing his hand and dropping blood into each of the seven bowls for different spells he has laid out.
You’re right, kid; we do...And, Jack?
If you were going to, you woulda done it already.
Yeah, that’s likely.
SAM smiles
As DEAN runs through the crowd of angels & demons, stabbing them in his fight to get to CASTIEL, THE EMPTY continues.
Heya, CAS.
JACK opens a rift and they rush through it. RUBY’S finger touches the rift after DEAN disappears & she’sucked through just before it closes.
“Dean,” Castiel says, moving across the room and crouching in front of him. “Is something wrong? You’ve been...
. Castiel looks around, frantically calculating what he can use to escape. He almost doesn’t hear the sound of rain- barely a drizzle, but it will do. Castiel looks at the rafters directly above him and uses his grace to gouge a hole in the roof, allowing rain to spill down on and around him.
"You can put your weapon down now Dean." I feel his arms move in a flourish before they hold me tightly. I peek out of his chest to see Sam and the witch talking animatedly to one another. I smile to myself, hiding it in Dean's shirt.
"Bloody hell! What do we do now?" Ron yells.
THE EMPTY grabs CASTIEL’S trench coat, heaving him up and looking at him face to face
“Cas?” Dean says, shaking Cas awake.
Jack mentioned that he’s noticed plants dying around him, and that, since then, he’s had tiny bits of his power come back. I think he could be an energy syphon. Sort of like a...black hole? But on a smaller scale.
If JACK uses his powers, won’t CHUCK be able to find him?
HERMIONE
leave me again,” Dean says, voice trembling, eyes full of tears that pour down his face.
"You're a muggle; you can't see it, but it's covered in ancient runes. I told you it was a useful subject, Ronald," Hermione snaps at Ron, whose ears turn red.
I just- I can’t do it, Sammy. Not again. Not this time.
THE EMPTY
EVERYONE turns to him.
DEAN’s voice cracks at the word
"Oh this? It's merely a scratch. They were trying to get me to help the thestrals to calm down. But dark magic unnerves them and one of them was a little harder to rein in," Luna answers, her thin fingers tugging and pulling at the knot. "Damn it. I think it's enchanted, I can't pull it apart."
Castiel smiles as he shakes, and Dean can see sweat building at his temples. Cas clears his throat, fumbles with his pocket for a second, then looks up at Dean.
AMARA opens her eyes
Ready for take-off.
Dean shakes his head, clenches his jaw.
THE EMPTY punches CAS again, letting him drop to the floor.
You two about done?
"Yeah," says the red haired one. "But...you can't get in?"
DEAN lays a hand on CAS’S cheek, and winces when CAS flinches away.
The camera pans around the room one more time, showing everyone relaxed and happy.

"Luna didn't do that - she wasn't alone. There are muggles involved...but what the devil happened to these two?" He leans closer to the other two bodies, whose eyes have been burned out of their sockets.

Jerk.
"Goin' to be the hard way, eh? Alright then. Let's have some fun, mate." The wizard with the bad teeth grins again and they point a wand at each of us. Oh, I could use some Blibbering Humdingers right about now; daddy always said they were useful creatures in dire situations...
I duck into the bathroom outside of the press room. I can hear the frenzied shouting of reporters through the wall. I close the stall door behind me and apparate to the location. The frenzied shouting is replaced with arguing of male voices. I struggle to not roll my eyes as I walk around the boulder towards the hushed voices.
CASTIEL. I...I need- I need to tell you…
You could say so, but not as beautiful as DEAN.

Yeah?

At the top of the cliff is a grassy meadow filled with golden flowers that sparkle with morning dew from the sun peeping over the horizon. And, in the middle of the meadow, is a giant, curving, crystal-like tree, shimmering like a million fractured rainbows.
What the hell was
I didn’t want anyone else getting out.
DEAN (cont.)
GABRIEL looks confused. MICHAEL/ADAM walks over with SAM and JACK from the LIBRARY SHELVES.
Well, he doesn’t know if it’ll work, there’s not exactly an instruction manual. But his cobbled together mix of about 13 spells and a sacrificial altar seem like the best option he’s had in half a decade. So, he tries it.
I don’t regret it.
Do...do you mean it?
JACK (looking hopeful)
“Of course, Dean,” he breathes. “Of course.”
RUBY (rolls her eyes)
What do you mean?
What’re you doing here?
CHUCK yells, scrambling to his feet, pulling AIRPODS out of his ears.
We see DEAN again, getting more desperate.
This is a great party!
JACK, watch her. And
The Death Eaters look at one another for a moment, then back at me, lips tight. "Alright." I raise my hand and tilt it in the air. The wizard on the right howls in pain; I am currently twisting his intestines.

December 2020-May 2021
I hope you enjoyed this! Please let me know what you think, and thank you for sticking around for all these months!!
CHUCK (to DEAN)
No...it- THE EMPTY. It...It was THE EMPTY.
"I'll give you one more chance," I say, looking up at the stars beginning to appear overhead. "One chance to tell us where Sam and Luna are. After that, you will wish you were dead, for the pain I will inflict upon you will be greater than you have ever endured - I can assure you."
"We'll head back to the car, Sam. Meet us there?" Dean asks. Sam nods and I grab his wrist and lead him the way I saw a young thestral go. We come up to it and I show Sam the proper way to coax it without scaring it. Just as we are getting back to the clearing where I'd had them corralled I hear a twig snap behind us. Spinning around I pull my wand from behind my ear and cast protego non-verbally. A spell rebounds off my charm and Sam draws his gun.
And how exactly-
The music abruptly stops.
Wow--two chapters in as many days after months of nothing? Could only be me :)
"Now I'm no expert on wizarding matters," Cas begins, "but I'm pretty sure that Muggle weapons can still afflict wounds on you right?" I flash my blade threateningly and the man's face flashes in fear for a brief moment. We got him.
DEAN removes the blade from her neck and lowers CAS and himself to the ground, CAS laid across his lap, head supported by DEAN’S right hand.
"Protego," she yells, deflecting the spell one of the masked figures shoots her direction. They engage in a whiz of flashes and bangs until he suddenly falls frozen to the floor. I can still hear Dean fighting until I hear an incantation and Dean falls morbidly silent.
too little, too friggin late.
"That is not very nice." Cas tuts in disapproval. He nods to me and I unsheathe my hidden blade, approaching the fuming dark wizard.
Novak- on yet another one of his adventures. Dean, as Castiel’s personal bodyguard (and best friend) is obligated to accompany Cas on every one of his escapades into the outside world, whether it be to get some of Garth’s fresh-baked bread, to practice sword fighting in secret with Knight Charlie Bradbury, or, on something like this
“Cas!” Dean says, toasting to him with his...well, he’d lost count of the beers at this point, but this was the only one not quite empty. “Welc’m to tha party!”
CASTIEL
CHUCK yells in rage, staggering to his feet again, and manages to get enough of a hold on his powers to throw MICHAEL and GABRIEL off and several feet backwards, MICHAEL landing in the OCEAN, and GABRIEL slamming into a PALM TREE.
"I-I don't know...it's like it's charged with magic! It's radiating with it. It burned my hand to touch it." He holds up his hand and I see his fingers are scorched where the wand touched it. Harry holds his wand with his uninjured hand and uses a charm to see what the broken wand last cast. A misty image rises from its tip showing an old house in the middle of nowhere. "Great. Someone - probably Death Eaters or whoever killed them - apparated. How're we supposed to know where that is?"
. So, when Castiel finds him in the wee hours of the morning slumped against the wall in a daze, Dean just rolls with it.

"With your help I can."

Castiel tilts his head. “What-”
Technically, yeah. It just has to be something GOD touches and puts a bit of his power into.
DEAN looks around the bunker fondly, then smiles back.
DEAN looks at JACK.
I stumble backwards and almost fall but Cas catches me by the arm. The two men hold up wands and step towards us. "Stop," Cas growls. He holds up his hand and I know he can blast them to smithereens with a snap.
SAM, what-
"What the hell? Why can't I get over there? Why can't YOU get over there?"
...We can’t just give up. Not after what CHUCK took from us. Not after what Cas sacrificed for you.
DEAN (scoffs)
They aren't talking. I walk over and grab Dean's tense shoulder. I feel myself flush, something igniting within me at the touch. I gently squeeze and he reluctantly turns his eyes to me. For a moment, a fraction of a second I can only detect by being an angel with enhanced senses, his composure breaks. He shows me his anguish. Then it's gone, and he gives me a hard look. We communicate without words that I will take over and he steps back.
Dean is having a panic attack.
DEAN anxiously scans the crowd for CASTIEL. They walk through for a while and get caught up in a few fights, then we see a close up of DEAN’s face as he faintly hears his own voice from afar. We see his eyes narrow in on a figure of NOT DEAN in the far distance, and CASTIEL, bloodied and battered, on his knees, struggling to stand back up.

We see a shot of RUBY noticing DEAN, JACK, and CAS for the first time, killing an angel with a stolen blade, and starting to fight her way across the crowd.
"What do you mean gone?" The shorter man frowned at me as he sheaths his blade. The unshaven man places a hand on his shoulder and the shorter man visibly relaxes from his tensed posture. The giant takes a curious step closer to the thestrals.
THE EMPTY laughs at CAS’s failing attempt to get up.
Yeah, sure, JACK. Of course!
...DEAN...what happened?
"What are you doing?" Sam's voice cut across the room. I can feel his curious gaze sharpen as I bump into the corner of the room.
Please let me know what you think of this, and if I should keep writing it! It is a fun story, and I'm sorry for the gap in putting out chapters. My motivation to write has been lacking.

DEAN looks up as we hear quick footsteps approaching
"Who are you?" the one with glasses asks.

Garth arrives and things get dicey
There’s a brief pause in the fighting around them, but then the ANGELS and DEMONS carry on.
Finally it's over, and the pain is gone. It's taken a lot of juice for Cas to heal me, and he slumps forward. "Hey," I pant, sitting up. I hold his face in my hands, tilt his head up to mine. I kiss him, then, because I can, because he saved me, because I don't really know what else to do. Our lips fit together perfectly, and I grip his hair in my hands.
We saved each other, sweetheart.
ADAM helped teach me that GOD is in everything, all the rocks, all the rain- everywhere. So...does that mean...I’m syphoning GOD’s energy?
DEAN nods at JACK and JACK grabs RUBY’s wrists, holding her still.
CAS summoned it...to save me. To- to take BILLIE. She was gonna kill us.
"That's a great idea."
And everything is pain.
DEAN doesn’t seem to hear him. His gaze is cloudy and unfocused as he stares at the chair in the middle of the room.
"Help is coming. Be ready to fight." Hermione's  voice spills out. I glance at Sam and realize I could see the etching in the chains they replaced the rope with keeping him in place. Perhaps I could get him out of the binds after all.
how long I’ve been- I’ve been in love with you.
CASTIEL
So, it’s you and me, huh?
DEAN gestures towards all the noise
CASTIEL’s eyes widen, and he jumps at first, then melts into the kiss.
I watch as Sam and Luna vanish in a puff of smoke. I grab the unconscious hooded figures from off the ground and slouch them angrily across the nearest tree trunk. Cas calms the baby thestral crying for its missing mother. The remaining hooded figures must have taken them as well. Cas coaxes it out from the brush it was hiding in and begins to stroke it gently, murmuring quiet praises in its ear. I grab rope from the impala and remove the wooden wands from the Death Eaters before tying them up. Cas removes their masks with magic, the thestral trailing behind him on wobbly legs. I take a moment to appreciate the cuteness of the little horse nibbling on Cas's coat. One of the Death Eaters stirs awake on the far left and glances around.
RUBY’s eyes widen and she raises her hands in a pleading gesture.
CASTIEL blushes as DEAN moves his other hand to CASTIEL’s right cheek, cradling his face in both for a moment before shyly pressing his lips to CASTIEL’S.
DEAN, it’s ok—
. There’s still us, and JACK, and there’s still a monster out there to beat. I mean, come on, man; do you think CAS would have wanted this? For you to just give up?
DEAN (cont.)
They were
Just before the song says-
I'm thankful for the time I spent in the Malfoy Manor. Although the Cruciatus curse knocked the wind out of me, my body had suffered much worse in that basement. I'm also grateful that when they took my wand, they failed to check for other... magical items. I still have my wood and daisies headband in my hair. I strain against the magical chains, my fingers desperate to reach the center daisy. I bang the sides of my head against my restrained arms, hoping to wake the bowtruckle sleeping in the headband.
next to him could be friendly- or it could be about to kill him. But Dean is not one to go down without a fight.
Dean’s voice is sturdy; even plastered, he’s more sure of this than anything else in the world. “
And I’m...human now.
Really overdue, honestly.
"I think we should check it out," I say, turning back to Dean. Sam is still gazing up at the horses in awe as the blonde witch circles around Sam in what looks like bewilderment. I wrap my arms around Dean's torso and nuzzle my head under his stubbly chin.
“I never
"Aurors. But...you're muggles..." his wand lowers and he glances at the taller man, confused.
DEAN (carrying CASTIEL bridal style) and JACK quickly move further from the crowd and we get shots of RUBY fighting her way tooth and nail towards them in slow motion.

a short chapter, a long car ride
CHUCK lays motionless on his BEACH CHAIR.
DEAN (cont.)
Castiel is blushing, but smiling like a fool. “Now you can whenever you want.”
here it is: the final chapter! oh, what ever could happen? :)
Hold on, just listen. I’ve been needing to say this for a while. I said before:
CASTIEL looks weak, as if this form of punishment had been going on for a while.
SAM and JACK are researching, we don’t see DEAN. SAM looks worried, and JACK looks scared and sad, and a little anxious.
"Yes."
DEAN raises his GUN to shoot CHUCK again, but CHUCK throws the GUN into the air and out to sea with a flick of his wrist. DEAN watches it fly and land with a splash, but has his SILVER KNIFE out in an instant, charging towards CHUCK.
CASTIEL’S eyes full with guilt, something that even DEAN can see as he makes it halfway towards CASTIEL.
JACK looks to DEAN and he nods. JACK looks back to the ring in his hands, carefully holding it between both pointer fingers and thumbs. He closes his eyes, and the ring begins to glow hot white-
CHUCK shakes himself at the thought, then-
DEAN swipes the blade at THE EMPTY and it starts bleeding black goo, screaming in rage
I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.
. “You left ‘for I could
DEAN pauses.
"It's not your fault, Cas." I take his hand with my right one - my only one. "And you're right. I can still hunt. But...maybe it's time we took a break from it. All the big threats are gone. And there are plenty of other hunters out there to take care of the vamps and stuff. Give it some time."
JACK, DEAN, CAS, and RUBY land in a pile, all a little disoriented.
My mind is racing. I can hear voices in the distance. Brits. Wizards. And my arm is gone. But i have to know... "Sam. Is Sammy okay?" I twist around, breathing shallowly from the shock.
Once his panic subsides, Castiel feels Dean shifting so as to be further encased in the warmth of Castiel’s palm.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam’s brows furrowed in confusion, and then raise in shock.
DEAN (softly)
If my choices are to be human or spend eternity trapped inside
Y’know, uncle CAS used to have
We pan up into the air to see CHUCK laying back on a BEACH CHAIR several yards in front of our heroes by the water line, wearing a HAWAIIAN SHIRT, LEI, and SUNGLASSES, hands clasped on his chest.
you can have it. All this time, all these
Let’s get out of here. That only stalled it- it’ll be back soon enough, stronger than before, and’ll put everything here back to sleep. You did good, kid.
DEAN shoots chuck in the leg
DEAN lunges and is able to grab the angel blade and get out of the goo, standing up just in time to come face to face with his doppelganger. We have a close up shot of them together, like a mirror reflection, noses inches apart.
Cas smiled shakily and cleared his throat. “I – thank you, Mary. I’ll make sure that they know that.”
…i may already know a good portion of the part
“Ah, Castiel! Calling to let us know about your travel plans?” his father asked.
Cas placed the order and paid before Dean could even think to protest. “My treat,” Cas stated firmly, “since it was my invitation and you’ve already had a long day.”
Once John was out of her life, Bobby became an invaluable presence helping her deal with the aftermath of John and the sudden loss of her two boys. He had been there through it all, helped get the boys excited to come up to Sioux Falls every summer, and Mary couldn’t have been more grateful for it.
Time passed quickly after returning to school from Thanksgiving break. It seemed like Cas just blinked and then it was winter break; he and Dean had over a month of vacation to enjoy. But when his father sent an email reminding him of the family Christmas celebrations, Cas realized he had a choice to make.
“Oh, that’s a good idea,” Cas replied thoughtfully. “I know Claire went to that convent school, probably Kaia too, one minute – ” He texted Mary to ask the girls. “Yep, both at the Holy Spirit Academy.”
Dean had to throw a pillow at that smug face. “Yeah, yeah, no bet, you’re probably right. Go do your homework or something.”
…If Cas interrupted, Dean wasn’t sure he’d be able to start again. So: he had to talk to Cas. That meant collecting Cas from Sammy’s room. Step one. He could do this.
As it turned out, Castiel and Sam hit it off majorly; both history nerds with bleeding hearts and a snarky sense of humor. Castiel had an underdeveloped understanding of pop culture that Sam immediately enlisted Dean in helping him change, so Dean and Castiel started spending a lot of time outside class together.
“Worth getting kicked out?” Cas asked numbly.
Claire nodded silently, awed. The Adler-Novak Thanksgivings had always been quiet, formal affairs, not much beyond small talk and an elegant dinner that never seemed to actually fill your stomach.
“Hey boys, I’m home – and I got the stuff for Bobby’s burgers!”
Once they were in the store, the two Winchesters split up – Dean with a basket to collect the all-important snacks, and his mom with a cart to get the rest of the also important but much less exciting groceries.
As it turned out, while Sam had almost certainly kept his end of the bargain, Dean had procrastinated and procrastinated on warning Cas until they were in the car and already on their way to the Winchester house. It was bad enough that he was giving Cas so little notice, Dean thought wildly, but no heads up at all was just cruel. He had to tell him. NOW.
Cas blinked back at her in surprise as Dean whispered loudly, “I told you she wouldn’t care.” He then cleared his throat and in his normal voice asked Mary if they could “pretty pretty please go back to the exhibits on the first floor? I was telling Cas about some of the ones we saw and I wanna go show him!”
Dean avoided looking at Sam as he felt a blush start to creep up his neck, “Um, well... Cas’ birthday is in a few days,” He blurted out without pausing between any words. Unfortunately, Sam seemed to manage to make out what he said.
“Because that’s what you do for the people you love.”
About a week before Cas’ birthday, Dean had caved and showed his progress to Sam.
It's been like two months...I was so stuck on this chapter that I had lost all motivation for it. But I'm proud to say that I'm very happy with how it turned out! It was really challenging to write in John's pov as a supportive and well-adjusted father. But I think I finally found a good balance. At first, this was really sappy and just completely unrealistic for these two.
“Mom, seriously? Have you met Dean? He’s never been with anyone for longer than a weekend-” Sam holds up a hand in Dean’s general direction in anticipation for whatever rebuttal Dean is about to make. “You really think Dean seeing some woman is the reason for his suddenly happy outlook on life?”
Wow, a chick-flick moment between John and Dean? Who would have thought?
That being said, Dean still hesitated for a moment, contemplating if he should just continue to deny everything like always, but ultimately he was tired of keeping this in for so long.
After a few minutes of silence, John assumes Dean is just done talking about it. He’s about to tell Dean to get to work when his son speaks up again, “I don’t even know the first thing about what love is supposed to feel like. What if they’re not right for me and I’m wasting my time and I’ll just get my heart broken. I’ve never trusted someone enough to give them that kind of power.”
“Wait, this is for Cas?” Sam asked, the beginnings of a bitch-face starting to form.
“No,” Sam answered and then seemed to change his mind, “Well maybe a little, I’ve never gotten a car for my birthday.”
“So you really went through all of this for him?” Sam asked in amazement after he had made about three laps around the hunter-green TR6.
So for the past month, while hunts were few and far between and he suddenly had hours of free time, he had been restoring the convertible, a 1969 Triumph TR6, to its former beauty.
Dean isn’t taking the bait. He pulls away from John’s reach and mumbles out an excuse, “Oh, shit I just realized I have to um...Bobby said he wanted to see me as soon as I got in. Don’t wanna give him reason to give me hell.”
John can’t help but be extremely aware of the fact that it’s slightly his fault his son is so allergic to feelings. Mary has recently given him multiple lectures on John's bad habit of encouraging his “toxic masculinity.” It was never his intention to discourage his sons from embracing their feelings, yet Dean is the prime example that he has inadvertently done just that. That ends today, John decides as he opens his mouth to share with his oldest more than he has before when it comes to notions of the heart.
Dean removed his hands and stepped beside Cas. As Cas was taking in the sight of the beautiful car in front of him, Dean was taking in the sight of the beautiful man in front of him. Cas’ bright blue eyes were wide and shining and there was a large smile threatening to take over half of his face.
It’s rare for the two men to have deep conversations that involve their feelings, but if Dean chooses to lead their discussion that way, then John will happily allow it.
LILLIAN
DEAN charges in with an angel blade in hand, Jack trailing behind.
We see various objects appear and disappear from the table, including: LORE BOOKS; a JOB APPLICATION with DEAN’s name on it; BEACH TOWELS, SWIMSUITS, a SUITCASE, and a PAMPHLET for a BEACH RESORT; a pile of NOUGAT BARS; a BIRTHDAY CAKE that says DEAN on it; EMPTY BEER BOTTLES; BABY DIAPERS; and then flashes of more and more RANDOM OBJECTS until it stops on a TABLE covered with CARVED NAMES and FOOD and FIRECRACKER BOXES with the date on the bottom of the screen:
, really.

“I’m sorry Dean, I-”
JACK nods and smiles.
We see SAM, shocked
CHUCK
DEAN stands and walks around the table, clapping a hand on JACK’s shoulder.
"Is he really back?" I stare into her eyes.
But, even then, on his own, he searches for a way to get Cas back. It’s the only thing he can think about. The only thing he
DEAN smiles, pulling his brother into a hug. He pats SAM on the back, then looks down when he feels LILLIAN tugging on his pant-leg.
DEAN (cont.)
“Dean, how-”
GABRIEL (smugly, with a shit-eating grin)
I blink and we are surrounded by hooded figures; Death Eaters. Sam fires quickly and shoots down two in a row. I take out another with a stunning spell before I am grabbed from behind. Three of them take Sam, and he calls out for Dean and Cas. I hear Dean yell, and I think quickly. Expecto patronum! My hare races away into the darkening sky towards the east - Hermione will get my message. They will send help. I elbow a Death Eater in the face, breaking his nose, and grab Sam's hand before they disapparate with us - then everything is black.
starts playing.
You think a simple freakin’ sorry’s enough? Huh?
You did it.
DEAN, that’s genius!
Dean yells as he punches the witch in the face. Sam is knocked out cold, Cas restrained by holy fire. And Dean’s gun, loaded with witch killing bullets, is uselessly lying across the room. This witch was prepared, Dean would give it that.
"Now. You two are gonna tell us where the angel is. Or else we're gonna have a little fun, eh?" The Death Eater grins and shows several missing teeth. Sam spits in his face. "Blimey!" He retaliates by punching Sam in the stomach, then uses the cruciatus curse on him. I scream for him to stop, and the spell that took away Sam's voice breaks; his screams echo off of the stones all around us.
I do, and he slumps, panting, crying. He tells us between gasps that the other Death Eaters went back to their base in northern Montana - several hours from here. That they needed an angel and several creatures of death to complete a ritual to bring back the Dark Lord.
SAM gives DEAN a look that clearly says ‘now is
"He's already on his wa-"
What about AMARA?
CASTIEL
to top it all off. Dean needs
JACK hugs DEAN tight.
"Sam! What the hell is that?" Up above me is some sort of skeletal winged horse. It's diving between the treetops, coming in and out of sight.
“Of course, Cas! I missed you- s- so much…” Dean trails off, looking confused and sad for a few moments.
He holds me tighter as i begin to struggle against him, heart pounding,nausea building,  adrenaline coursing and making me hyper-aware of everything. "Dean, I'm sorry. I couldn't heal it. It was a powerful spell, and you nearly died."
When you tried to play god? When you nearly
DEAN breathes a sigh of relief.
"Oh my god. Luna are you all right?" I asks as she tries to untie the knotted rope holding me up.
I yell "LUNA!" as Dean shouts "SAM!" he rushes the barrier and claws his way through. He takes off at a run towards the house, gun drawn.
MICHAEL
DEAN (voice shaking slightly)
DEAN pauses for a moment, looking at the handprint on his JACKET. He shakes his head and turns back to JACK
...Where’s CAS?
you Cas. You’re...you’re
We open on DEAN sitting where we left him last episode. We hear SAM running through the bunker as Dean stares blankly at the opposite wall. SAM finally enters the room.
Just a reminder, this takes place after season 11, but Charlene Bradbury is still alive and well and THRIVING in the background, so when she is mentioned just know that she is still with us. Might as well be immortal. Canon? I don't know her.
CAS’S breath hitches before going back to normal.
Do you hate me yet :)
DEAN Pulls back from CAS and holds his hands on his shoulders, looking at him as he always has, but this time without shame, without guilt; he lets himself put into his eyes what he feels in his heart-
of SAM, DEAN, JACK, MICHAEL/ADAM, and GABRIEL gathering books from archives and researching on the web. DEAN is Motivated™ the entire time.
Feels like forever. And I’m sorry it took me so long to say it. But it’s true, and you
We see a
"Maybe you should call Cas?"
"I'm perfectly fine. You can put the blade away, the vampires are already gone." I lower my wand as the last of the meat disappears.
Cas would’ve wanted you to keep fighting, DEAN. To fight for everyone we’ve lost- to fight for
that way…’specially about
(v.o)
JACK looks back, tilting his head in a CAS-like way.
But he’s cut off by a kiss, hard and fast, filled with years of longing.
We hear yelling and screams in the distance.
Stick to the plan, okay?
"Are you sure this is the right place, Ron?" Harry asks. We've been walking the woods for over ten minutes and haven't found any sign that Luna was here.
"Son of a bitch! What are these things?"
“I can’t imagine ever wanting to.” Castiel kisses Dean, then pulls him into another hug, touching their foreheads together and looking into those green, green eyes. “This is exactly where I want to be.”
...and you guys I guess
“Dean, it’s alright-” Castiel begins, raising a hand to attempt to comfort the hunter, but Dean shouts, still a tiny noise, and covers his ears as he sinks to the ground.
DEAN holds his breath as he slices a thin cut on CASTIEL’S neck and doesn’t let it out until all of CASTIEL’S grace has filtered out of the tiny cut and dissipated into the air. He heaves a sigh, smiling at the contented, peaceful look on CASTIEL’S face.
What’s left to do, Sam? There’s literally nothing left, damnit!
Ahh!! I can't believe I've gone this long without updating!! I am *so sorry* I genuinely did Not realize it had been that long. Time Does Not Exist. Anyway, enjoy a fluffy chapter!
Was it CHUCK?
DEAN grins even wider, picks LILLIAN up and squeezes her in a bear hug as she giggles.
Sam's calling in reinforcements to try and figure out exactly what that powder is, and how they can fix Dean.
Dean groans and rolls his eyes as he follows Castiel- soon to be
SAMMY,
I love you. I’ve loved you for so long, I don’t know what
"That's not how it works," he says kindly. I clear my throat.
Sam is quiet for a few moments, jaw twitching, notices the handprint on DEAN’s shoulder and his eyes soften .
The real DEAN hears this and growls in anger, fighting even harder to get to CAS.
I watch as Dean interrogates the two surviving Death eaters; there are three others dead on the ground, matching the three gunshots I heard earlier which had sent us running back to Sam and Luna. Dean yells at the wizards and slashes them with his blade. His face does nothing to hide his fury, but I can see a panic guised beneath it. He's scared. Any time Sam is in danger, no matter how small, he fears losing him. He won't show it openly, not even if we were alone, but he is terrified.
In which Castiel is old as shit, and Everyone Ships It TM
THE EMPTY
CASTIEL (grinning)
Castiel waves a hand to quiet Dean. He opens his eyes and gives a soft smile. Then, as the sun crests the horizon in full, Castiel kneels, the tree behind him igniting with an iridescent glow, branching like wings behind him.
That’s only half of it. You didn’t need to hear it
It’s okay, CAS. You’re out of there. You’re
JACK appears and grabs CHUCK’s face between his hands.
AMARA
DEAN (cont.)
CASTIEL
So, we need to get JACK fully charged, and we can take down GOD.
But isn’t that what we do? We save people! We’re gonna save the world, but I want to save AUNT AMARA too.
Castiel pauses. “A party of one?”
...It’s not your fault, DEAN.
(See the end of the chapter for
DEAN glares at her.
RUBY (looking unphased)
DEAN inhales sharply (& shakily), looks away, and lets it out. He turns back to CAS, hope sparkling in his eyes along with tears. He doesn’t care that they aren’t alone; he can’t wait any longer.

We cut back to SAM, MICHEAL/ADAM, and GABRIEL in the BUNKER. SAM is doing a TRACKING SPELL to find GOD. Right as it finishes, we see DEAN and JACK appear in the distance behind them.
He spends the first week after Sam moves out in a drunken despair, finally, truly alone with his thoughts. He doesn’t eat. He can’t sleep. He loses weight and gains eye bags, and neither ever return to normal after that.
Suddenly Luna's voice carries over to us. "You're an angel?"
Before I can respond, I hear a distant yell, and even though it's barely discernable through walls, earth, and distance, I hear it and I know it. I jump to my feet though my leg is still sore, and take off at a run.
Well, I like my odds.
Dean groans and covers his ears instinctively at the loud rumble- it only makes his headache worse. And boy, does he ache-
SAM walks up the stairs. He opens the door, and we see MICHAEL and GABRIEL.
Son-of-a-bitch stole my idea!
We do a bigger and bigger, faster and faster zoom out until we have the entire world in our view.
CHUCK heals his head wound and crosses his arms in front of him.
DEAN (shakily)
SAM (looking around the bunker)
DEAN...I’m sorry. I know how it feels, to lose someone you- that you care a lot about.
DEAN pulls back after a few moments, a shy but goofy grin on his face. They just stare at each other for a while, taking the other in.
“You’re an asshole.” Dean retorted, but of course, he didn’t mean it. Especially not with the way Cas had slotted their lips back together.
“Yes, whoever they are,” Mary states with a pointed look at John, one that makes Dean’s nerves kick up at the implication. “They’re clearly very special.”
Suddenly Cas looked over, catching Dean staring, which made the blue-eyed man smile impossibly wider. He was fucking beautiful.
So instead of saying more, he just mirrored Cas’s smile and threw him the keys.
Due to the intense nature of what they’re about to discuss, John rolls out from under the vehicle and faces Dean, grabbing a rag and wiping the grease off his hands. After tossing the rag onto the car, he grabs two stools for them to sit on. This is going to require his full attention.
Blowing it off seems appealing, but Dean knows he has to come clean sooner or later, and the more he puts it off, the more anxious he’ll become.
“Mary, he clearly doesn’t want you to make a big deal about this,” John says softly when Mary lets go of their eldest. He then continues, this time talking to Dean. “Son, that’s great, I’m glad she makes you this happy.”
The best part about having the whole family back in Kansas is getting to stop in at each other’s houses whenever there’s free time to spend some much appreciated quality time together.
To John's surprise, Dean looks him in the eye for the first time during this entire conversation. There’s a look of utter vulnerability on Dean’s face that John has never seen before. But it’s also mixed with something like hope. What he needs is encouragement that he’s on the right track.
“John, sweety, what do you think?” Mary points her beer in the direction of her husband who has clearly not been paying much attention if the utterly confused look gracing his face is any indication.
During a solo hunt a few months ago, (before the world had gone to shit and subsequently been saved) Dean had come across an abandoned classic convertible. He had always been of the opinion that convertibles were a bit overrated, but there were two reasons he couldn’t just leave it where he found it.
Raise your hand if you're ready for a talk in the Impala between the brothers *insert hand raising emoji here*
“Well, we hit it off right from the start. Charlie introduced us actually, Cas is one of her co-workers. Our first date was the next night. It was more than just instant attraction, Cas gets me like no one else ever has, and we have so much in common. Our bond is so profound that after just the first week, it felt like we had known each other for years. We fit into each other’s lives perfectly, like we were just waiting for each other. I guess Cas just makes me feel more alive, you know?” It’s extremely clear that Dean feels more alive than he ever has before as he word-vomits his feelings to his father. “I feel more comfortable when we’re together than I’ve felt around anyone. I feel seen and appreciated in a way I never had before. Cas makes me want to be a better person, makes me feel like I can be the truest version of myself.”
Cas hesitated, but tapped on the color green.
Cas blinked at him. “I genuinely have no idea what you’re talking about, Dean, but I promise that nothing you have to say is going to change my opinion of you.”
Sam and Cas put their research skills to work the next day, while Dean played interference with Bobby and Mary. Aside from giving some excuse for their absentmindedness and disappearances aside from meals, the two boys weren’t fussed about the details and focused on gathering a variety of useful and well-written materials.
Bobby scowled. “No, no I did not.”
Cas raised an eyebrow at Claire’s outfit, looking far more punk than he ever would have imagine his aunt and uncle approving, but managed to bite his tongue.
Claire and Kaia froze when “Jody” walked in – it was Sheriff Mills.
And for the first few days, it worked. Castiel went to classes, had lunch with friends (perhaps they were more like acquaintances, at this point, but so early in the year Castiel would take what he could), did his homework and generally led a peaceful existence.
“Any special reason?” Cas asked absently, finishing up the (decaffeinated, it was far too late for anything else) tea he was making them after yet another Disney movie – Moana, this time, and Cas had to admit it was definitely one of his favorites.
Sam just shrugged and looked away. “No reason. But…we’re good?”
Dean just kept wiggling, too excited to even bother sticking his tongue out at her like he usually would. He and Cas were going back to the art museum, *and* they were going to get to see the cool new paintings! Could this day get any better??
“And you didn’t call ahead?” Cas asked calmly.
In the meantime, Cas was happy to participate in whatever method of distraction Dean and Sam preferred as they waited for Mary’s return. He was surprised when the choice was a board game he had never heard of.
Cas sighed. “At our age, dating is so wrapped up in sex – it just doesn’t seem worth the effort to try and explain that I’m interested in romance but not sex.”
“Hon, this has been amazing. *You’re* amazing. But as much as I care for you, and as much as I think you care for me…I don’t think I’m it for you.”
“Don’t worry Cas, I’m on it.” Sam responded reassuringly.
Cas went home satisfied with the day’s productivity: he had finally gotten Dean to agree to talk to him, thanks to Charlie, and he had also discovered an exciting possible new hobby. He would have to participate in a future campaign to know for sure, of course, but he had a good feeling. He was…worried about what Dean might reveal during their talk tomorrow, but it was important for Dean to talk about whatever had happened.
The sheriff – who had raised her eyebrow when Claire mentioned getting kicked out – let out a sigh as she finished. “And of course that bastard didn’t mention why you two had left,” she grumbled to herself (but still loudly enough for Claire to hear and start to hope that maybe, just maybe this wouldn’t end with being dragged kicking and screaming back to her parents’ house).
“…Dean? Can we talk now? Please?”
Dean snorted.
“Another date, you mean?” Kaia teased.
Dean…didn’t reply, deciding to just bury his face in Cas’ neck instead and enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling Cas’ arms and words were giving him.
Which, Dean quickly realized, was a bad idea. The last time he tried starting anything with a friend was – well, Lee. And look how that had turned out.
Castiel clapped his hands together loudly. “Alright! Now that Sexuality 101 has concluded, let’s get back to practicing.”
Dean rolled his eyes and threw an arm around her shoulders. “Good for you, although I’m a little hurt you didn’t say anything,” he teased her lightly.
“And you?” Bobby asked gruffly after letting Sam go and subtly wiping at his eyes. “Did you come just to give Sam support, or do you have something to tell me too?”
Dean was silent for a few minutes – minutes in which Cas could hear nothing but the ticking of the clock and his pulse pounding in his ears – but then Dean sighed. “Fine. FINE. Lunch, tomorrow. We’ll get food in the cafeteria, then head to an empty classroom to…talk, alright?”
“No,” Cas forced out. “I had…no idea.”
Cas took a deep breath before turning to face his father. “I – what? What changed?”
Dean drooped. “But that’s forever from now,” he whined.
“Don’t get me started again,” Bobby complained, but he and Sam both enclosed Cas in a hug.
Cas raised an eyebrow. “Why not?”
“But is it?” Sam suddenly interrupted.
John had been called back to active duty, with no real idea when he’d be back, so Sam and Dean’s usual trip to spend the summer with their mom needed a lot more just-in-case packing. They had to make sure that if John didn’t make it back in time for Sam to start his last year of middle school and Dean his senior year of high school, they’d be prepared to start school in Sioux Falls.
