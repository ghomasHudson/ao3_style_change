"Asshole," Steve breathes, threading his hand in Tony's hair and pulling hard, just the way he knows Tony likes it.  Tony hums, and Steve arches his back, trying to force his dick further down Tony's throat, but Tony holds him down firmly.  Not that Steve couldn't shake him off - he could, in less time than it takes to think about it - but he likes it, Tony holding him down, Tony looming over him, Tony telling him what to do.  He's pretty sure Tony's figured out that he likes it, which would be embarrassing if things like that mattered anymore.
“Here they come,” Rogers says, and Natasha cranes her neck to see Clint dragging Banner out of the building.  Somebody shoots at them from the top floor, and Clint doesn’t miss a step, just shoves Banner into the back seat and yanks the door shut behind them.  Banner’s trembling as bullets slap against the pavement, and Natasha can tell it’s not with fear.
"Yeah, but I didn't think you would," Tony says.  He jumps to his feet and crashes against Steve, and his lips taste like a Long Island iced tea.  "You came all the way from
“Good,” Tony said.  “That’s - I’m glad to hear that.  It’s just that sometimes, I see you, and I think, huh, you know, he doesn’t look
Tony took a deep, cleansing breath.  These were his teammates.  His friends.  He loved them.  He wanted them to be happy.  He did not, under any circumstances, want to kill them.
“Tinkers with them, mostly,” Hogan admits.  “Races, sometimes.  He built three of them himself, see.”
“So SI releases his personnel file and we let that play out.  The DOJ has nothing. It’s not like it’s the first time somebody with a grudge has gone after you.”
“You don’t have to be embarrassed,” Tony said.  His voice was quiet and gentle, gentler than Steve could ever remember it being.  “I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have woken you up.  I just…”  Tony blew out a breath.  “I couldn’t help myself.”
“You sure you don’t like it?” Stark murmurs against his lips.  His hips speed up, thrusting forward to meet his hand.  “Cause it seems like you don’t mind my voice one bit.  Kind of seems like you wouldn’t have a problem with me telling you all about how next time, I’m gonna get some slick and open you up nice and slow - ”
“I’d been trying to figure out a way to ask,” Steve admitted, pulling Tony off balance just so he could catch him.  “I figured another month or so of thinking about it really hard might do the trick.”
“Hey, come on, we’ve done World’s First Something plenty of times before, right, gang?” Scott said.  “First superhero team, first time travelers, a bunch of you went to space in a ship piloted by a raccoon, I feel like that had to be
“We think we’ve implicated him in another jewel heist in New Jersey,” Steve says, settling himself in the chair across from Pierce.  “I’ve got field agents interviewing witnesses now, but we’re pretty confident we can add it to his file.”
Here’s the thing: Steve didn’t actually really like to cook.  He’d done plenty of it growing up, out of necessity, and one of the things he liked best about the 21st century was that he didn’t have to do it anymore.  There was no deep-seated love of cooking driving Steve’s all-day cook-a-thon; it was just plain practicality.  He had, after all, come of age during the Depression, and he didn’t like for anything to go to waste.  And after tonight, for one reason or another, anything left behind in the fridge would fall into the category of waste.
Barnes watches him.  “You know,” he says, “lotta things change in five years, I get that.  But you two being friends again?  I wouldn’t have put money on that one.”
Tony dug into the junk drawer for a corkscrew.  “I thought I’d be drinking these while I cried alone in the shower contemplating my imminent demise, but this is much better.  What are we celebrating?”
"Once in a while," Barton says.  He grabs a glass of whiskey and settles down in a chair gingerly.  "It's usually not quite that fun."
at home, at work, on the train, walking through the breakfast cereal aisle - always worried if he wasn’t looking, he might miss something, even though Tony had never had an issue making his presence known before.  He glanced over his shoulder on the street, kept the TV off so he could hear every sound in his apartment, let the phone ring itself off the hook at the office.  When he slept - which he mostly didn’t - he left the light on and a note on top of the blankets:
“Since you asked so nicely,” Tony said, and pulled Steve toward him by the hair until his dick slid back into Steve’s mouth.  Steve took it in eagerly, already an expert after all of three minutes practice because he was just
Tony’s mouth is dry.  “Yeah,” he says, and Peter turns back to the screen, content in a way that Tony will never be that everyone had done everything they could.
“Don’t move,” Pierce says, and as Steve whirls around he sees Pierce just a few steps away, tommy gun aimed right at his chest.  “I mean it, Rogers.  You move, you’re dead.  If
The last of the boiling hot anger at Barnes, the rage that burned bright in Siberia and cooled considerably over the better part of a decade, goes suddenly dark in the pit of Tony’s stomach.  He looks around the hallway and gives in.  “I’m just gonna - yeah, I’m gonna sit.  Is that weird, if I sit here?”
“And yet nobody ever believed me when I said Captain America was an arrogant douchebag,” Tony said.  “So where’s Agent Carter?”
"Not anything you learned about in the Army, soldier boy," Stark says.  "It's a prototype.  Experimental."
“Cheers to that,” Barton says.  “Any luck figuring out what kind of science mumbo jumbo we all almost got ourselves killed over?”
“Well, it’s 1955, right?  A couple more years and you can start going to civil rights marches.  Do you really want to spend time with these people?”
“That was supposed to be on silent,” Tony says, sliding it out of his pocket as Fury glares daggers at him across the table, “so I’ll just - ”
Tony grabs a bottle from behind the bar and dumps what’s left of it into his glass.  “I’ll have you know that my armband’s targeting his improved significantly over the past several weeks.  I had a clean hit tonight, you can’t deny that.”
A series of hard-to-catch expressions cross Banner's face: terror, relief, gratitude, discomfort.  "Oh.  That's - good.  Thank you, I - "
“Because you’re dead,” Steve said.  He swallowed a mouthful of walnut chocolate chip.  “And probably a couple of other reasons.”
Three weeks after they nearly kill Captain America in a fit of mob violence, the Returned, as they’re calling themselves these days, hold a rally in DC.
“You don’t,” Steve says.  “But if I am, you never know how that could work out for you personally, Mr. Vanko.”
"Of course Tony would have a baby grand in the library," Bruce remarks, his fingers idly tracing the edges of the black keys. "No keeping quiet in here."
He rents a car from a guy operating out of a defunct Honda dealership and drives an hour and a half to a cabin that overlooks Lake Tahoe.  It's not quite snowing but it’s cold enough to start, and when Steve walks in through the side door he finds Tony in bare feet, standing over a pot on the stove.
“Contact in three, two,” Friday says, and just fifty or so feet above the surface of the Lower Bay, Tony slams into Steve.
“Something like that,” Clint said.  “Bedrooms are up the stairs, kitchen’s in the back, and the wine cellar is officially open for business.”
," he says, and Tony smirks and slides inside.  Steve shudders, oversensitive and dripping, and Tony fucks him so hard that he can feel the carpet leaving red-hot burns against his back.
“Never said I was,” Tony said.  He watched Steve push eggs around in the pan and tried to figure out if they were going to have to talk about it.
made the call,” Steve says.  “We had no idea - anything could have happened, if we’d done it differently.”
“Better luck next time,” she says, patting the screeching man on the cheek and leaving the way Vanko came.  The next room is an office, and she grabs an armful of handwritten documents and shoves them into her oversized bag.  There’s a pile of photos on the desk, and she flips through them quickly, then drops them into the bag along with a pile of cash (because why not).
Natasha walks upstairs, slowly, pausing on the first floor to take the temperature of the slow-simmering argument between the married Ukrainians who keep--and sleep in the back room of--the deli that is her business's (admittedly thin) disguise. It sits on top of her bar like a cheap hat, cocked over the eye of the entrance, and to a certain eye, draws attention to what's below. That's fine. Natasha made a choice, a long time ago, between discretion and brazen outlawry, and she's never once regretted that choice. Besides, make a speakeasy too subtle, and the drunks can't find you.
Steve leaned forward and kissed Tony, his tongue tracing the seam of Tony’s lips and then sliding inside as if to try to taste himself, which was - yeah, Tony was going to have to stop thinking
“No one is getting condoms, no one is doing anything that needs condoms, no one should even know what condoms
“No, you’re right, I don’t, but they don’t have to say it, because I know it.  I ruined trillions of people’s lives, and then I did it
.  Even if it wasn’t for the fact that I could lose my job if anybody found out - you and me, it was fun, it was real fun, but it doesn’t make any sense.  You’re - ”
“Well, there’s no accounting for taste,” Steve agreed.  “But seriously.  Put on a red hat and throw a sack over your shoulder and you’re old St. Nick himself.”
He checks into a motel across the road from a Walgreens.  In the shower of the dingy room, he thinks about how he and Natasha used to dye each other’s hair during the years they were out of the country, sitting in the bathrooms of abandoned SHIELD boltholes and crummy apartments and motel rooms just like this one.  They’d compare shades of platinum while Sam called out the score of the game from the other side of the wall and Wanda made ramen in the microwave.
“We were playing around with the hormone and heart rate mix that Bruce hit the day you laid into him, and I told him it was his fault you’d taken off,” Tony says.  “The big guy showed up just long enough to call you puny and then left Bruce behind in pants 12 sizes too big.  But hey, it’s a start.”
Steve had left his phone behind, and he knows Natasha’s inspected his motorcycle for any tracking equipment because Natasha does regular sweeps of literally everything they come into contact with, but he’s
Pierce glances at him and smiles.  “We’re going on a raid, Agent.  Helping out the boys over in Prohibition unit.  Little place called the Black Widow.  Ever heard of it?”
“I’ll take a beer, actually,” Steve says, and pulls the cap off with his bare hands like a show-off.  “I didn’t think tonight was going to turn into a party.”
"And now you're a civil servant, a slave to good ol J. Edgar, because you don't know how to do anything else, do you?" Stark says.  "You've never been anything but Uncle Sam's good little boy."
“Wait, what’d you say?” Scott says.  “Man, I hate not being able to see everybody, how do I get one of those holo-thingies installed in my house, do I have to call Comcast for that or what?”
But there are a lot of things he didn’t used to do, Steve thinks as he gets on his bike and heads into the city, and, well, it seems silly not to do them now.
It’s only for a second, until Friday automatically flips on night vision.  It doesn’t help much, just gives him the outline of hundreds of tiny drones - of course it’s drones, fucking
Steve blew out a breath.  They walked another block.  Finally, he said, “I used to think about her all the time.”
Steve raises his eyebrows.  “I thought it was me doing Bruce a favor, but apparently I’m about to hear differently from you.”
“I’m aware,” Pierce says, “that you got some special treatment during the war due to what you signed yourself up for, Rogers, but you should know by now that special treatment doesn’t exist here at the bureau.”
“This honesty thing really makes things easy,” Tony said, stumbling toward his room with Steve trailing behind him.  “We should have done this months ago.  I mean, if you were interested months ago, when did you first, uh, you know, start thinking about me in that way?”
For the first time, the man's easy smile slips.  "I got out of weapons in 1916," Stark says.  "Any more questions?"
“It’s just that I think it’d be kinda nice, if you showed the kids of New York that Santa is alive and well in the city.”  Steve leaned back in his chair.
“It’s not going to kill you,” Steve said, factually, because he couldn’t help himself.  “You’re wearing too many clothes.”
“So what’s your plan?” Natasha says.  “Take on the entire New York mob outfit single-handedly?  Sounds like suicide.”
The room exploded around them: Scott let out a whoop, and Sam catcalled, and everyone rushed toward the ship, and Steve let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.
Steve’s entire search history was adorably typed out in full sentences.  He’d searched “Tony Stark” six separate times, which Tony mentally filed away and promised to pull out only if Steve
“The only other two people who live here who aren’t in this room!” Tony yelled, exasperated.  “Thor and Natasha!”
to talk, so I would probably just break down the door and I don’t want to cause any damage to Tony’s house.  Even though he always says it belongs to all of us I always feel like it actually belongs to
Clint snatched up two plates he’d just put down and started to juggle them.  “Does this look lucky to you?”
“Depends on what you mean by bothered,” Natasha murmurs as Stark slides through the crowd, Banner trailing reluctantly behind him.
“I don’t think you know me as well as you think you do, Tony,” Steve interrupted, smirking, and Tony felt his jaw drop, because if he hadn’t known better he would have thought Steve was
“Got it,” he says, because he knows Tony was injured in the war and he knows what that does to men, and when he cups Stark’s cheek, the other man leans forward and kisses him, hard.
“If it’s impaled him somewhere, removing it could kill him,” Banner warns from over Steve’s shoulder.
"Stan sent me," he says as a man steps into the light.  He's clearly the muscle of the joint: narrowed eyes, thick neck; Steve can't make out a weapon but he assumes it's there.
"Yeah, I mean, I know it's a hotel, but why is it a hotel in New Jersey?  I own an entire building.  You know I own an entire building, right?"
Thor smiles warmly at her; he's seen her play this game before.  He's brighter than he looks, her Norwegian boy.
He releases a deep breath in the hallway.  It’s empty, thank goodness, but from around the house he can hear the sounds of people waking up: quiet voices murmuring, throats clearing, water running.  He’s not the only one who spent the night in the mansion, it turns out.  At the bottom of the stairs he spots a young couple wandering out to the backyard with their shoes in their hands, and as he passes through the front parlor he finds Odinson asleep on a massive sofa with his arms around not one but two women.
“I’m sorry my sound system isn’t up to your standards,” Clint said, rifling through his CD tower.  “You’re welcome to go stay at that
“That sounds fascinating,” Shirley said.  “I was in a steno pool for a few years before Bob and I got married.  Do you meet a lot of important people?”
Tony stares at it.  It’s true, of course.  It was pointless and antagonistic and probably won’t win him many points in the long run.  He’s trying to come up with a response, because Steve’s
It's not a question, so Steve doesn't answer, just stretches out in bed and slides an idle hand up Tony's ribcage.
“You said he tried to hold your hand?” Bruce says.  “I feel like that’s not super ambiguous.  Wow, are you and Steve dating?  This is crazy!”
, a crowd of protestors, the kind of protestors who have started to think that all the cards in the post-Blip world are stacked against them.
Steve demolishes four burgers and two shakes before Sam rescues a few and takes them down to Wanda’s room.  When Tony looks up, Steve’s looking so miserable that Tony can’t help but say, “You wanna talk about it?”
Her first thought is that if only her joint was always this crowded, she wouldn’t have to keep such careful books.  The room’s full of goons, and front and center is the head goon himself, Aldrich Killian, flanked on one side by a kindly, smiling older gentleman whom Natasha assumes to be Pierce, and on the other by Rogers.  Rogers’ face is a careful blank, and Natasha notes that several of the men have their guns trained on
“Well, I’m glad to hear you didn’t think it was a year-long one night stand.  They say you’re smart, after all.”
“I can’t recommend it, sir,” JARVIS said.  “The mass confusion and potential for outsider intrusion…”
Tony watches the three hundred thousand names scroll by and sighs.  “Dopey, start cross-referencing every name on the list with known aliases, projected aliases, social media profiles, and favorite ice cream flavors.  That last one was a joke, by the way, just because Rhodey likes mint chocolate chip doesn’t make him a maniac, you’re not worthy of my comedy.”
Rhodey looks unimpressed.  “It’s not the kind of joke you can make around the secretary of defense and you know it.”
Tony takes a good look at him.  This time yesterday - or was it the day before? - he was getting pounded into mincemeat.  Today his bruises are going green and yellow, and the skin all around his eye is bright red, freshly scarred.  “Well, at least the ugly won’t last.”
Steve looked around Clint’s room, which was about halfway through the process of having every item in it covered in wrapping paper.  “You mean you think I should have bought more?”
So, of course, that means it’s only the work of a few seconds for absolutely everything to go wrong.
“So look, full amnesty, you can take any of it back, if you want to.  I’ll forget everything you said.  And, uh, did.  The whole - all of it.  No hard feelings.”
“Edgar would probably make a run,” Tony said, watching the water drip down Steve’s pecs - er, looking at nothing, in a casual friendly way.  Yes.  That.
“It’s a squeaky wheel,” Tony says.  “A vocal minority.  You don’t have to take it all on, you know.”
A large blonde bartender sidles up to him, wiping out a glass.  "A drink?  Not that we have any," he says, and then laughs loudly at his own joke.
“Ideas about how to stop the effects of a truth serum that SHIELD has always claimed didn’t exist?” Natasha said.  “Not at the moment.”
“For some value of trust,” Romanov rectifies.  “The nice thing about the mob is that they know everybody’s got ulterior motives, and they don’t much care what yours are as long as they get what they want.”
"It was our pleasure," Odinson says, starting to sweep of the mess of broken glasses on the floor.  "Truly."
“Pretty much,” Steve says.  He’s sketching something big, a building surrounded by trees, and it hits Tony like a punch to the gut when he realizes it’s the base that Thanos destroyed.  When Steve looks up and sees Tony’s gaze, he quickly covers it with his elbow.  “Any plans today?”
, because wanting that from Steve, of all people, is a liability and a distraction and god, it’s an embarrassment.
, we can’t just go around kicking down doors and knocking out bad guys.  I know you’ve got this big grand idea that we’re saving the city, but at the end of the day we’re just six people.  We can’t go up against all the criminals in New York.  We’re crazy to be doing as much as we are.”
“Who do you think helped Barton find a butler?” Nick said.  “Any eggs left, or should I come back after you two finish making out?”
give a gift to every kid in the city, if you wanted to,” Bruce contributed, the back-stabbing son of a bitch.
“I’m thinking about clothes,” Tony says.  “Barton could use something a little more form fitting for when he’s sneaking up on people, and we can’t have you popping a button every time you take a swing, you’ll be out of shirts by next Tuesday.”
There’s a clatter of chairs being stacked and glasses wiped out as the boys get ready to leave; Natasha watches Rogers beeline out before Stark can chase him, sees Banner head up the stairs toward his apartment.
Steve, freshly showered and looking like even more of a tightass than usual, cleared his throat.  “Should we really be drinking?”
“Don’t be a snob,” Steve said.  “This is state of the art technology in 1954.  I spent a month’s salary on this thing.”
“Okay, yeah, it’s bad.  But when I started looking for you I kinda thought I might find you somewhere worse than this.”
Tony sighed.  “All right.  One last dare for the year.  What’ll it be?  Want me to steal the ball from Times Square before they drop it?”
“Do you really think everything would have gone down the way it did if I’d died in Afghanistan?” Tony says.
it, and then Steve pretended not to notice when Natasha started passing around a flask under the table because look, if he could’ve gotten drunk he would’ve had a couple of swigs of his own, all right?
Steve considers it.  “The people.  The institutions too, I suppose.  The government, on a good day - ”
“Because if I had guaranteed muscles for life and no potential beer belly in sight I’d eat nothing but cheeseburgers.”
“So do you wish you were off getting trashed on wine coolers with the rest of your classmates?” Tony says as Peter polishes off yet another slice of cake.
“You are unbelievable,” he babbled, watching his cock slide between Steve’s lips.  “Can’t believe you wanted this and never told me - you are
"More or less," Banner says.  "Chemical weapons, mostly.  Some medical technology.  We did gas masks for a few months like everybody else.  You interested in the weapons?"
“I’ve always appreciated someone who knows what he wants,” Tony breathed into Steve’s ear.  “I swear I’m trying really hard not to take advantage of it, but the idea of hearing every dirty thought in your head while I make you come is
Above her, there’s an explosion and a crash and the whole building shakes.  She throws the last of the documents into the bag and goes back into the hallway as dust and plaster rain down.
“Not even close,” Steve said.  “I miss the shield.  I miss jumping out of things I probably shouldn’t.  Hell, sometimes I even miss your voice in my ear, pissing me off.”
“Give him a break,” Steve says.  “Before he was Spiderman he was just a regular kid.  Kind of a nerdy one, in fact.  That kind of upgrade… it takes some getting used to.”
“I mean,” Tony says, “to look at the tapes again.  If you don’t have anything else going on, of course.  We could see what Friday’s found out since we left, maybe something’s turned up - ”
was, I don’t hate you anymore,” Tony said.  “Which is a pretty big step, actually, because I did hate you, before.  When I met you.  You were pretty hateable.”
Steve looks at him sharply, like he thinks Tony’s giving him a hard time, and Tony watches him carefully until Steve relaxes.  “No.  No, not really.”
“As fun as all of those sound,” Steve said, “I was thinking that maybe I’d dare you to kiss me at midnight.”
“God, what are the odds, you try to pull off a quiet mugging and Iron Man and Captain America show up,” Tony says, holding out his hand repulsor first.  “Is there no peace in New York for criminals these days?”
Steve blinks into the light.  The room is mostly empty but for sun-faded wallpaper, a toy chest, and a few hunks of metal scattered around.  Through the open french doors that lead onto a moonlit balcony, Steve can hear the band playing and the rabble of the increasingly drunk.  “It’s… a nursery?” he says blankly.
“Don’t sweat it,” Tony says when Peter comes over one night and asks, hesitantly, how he’s doing.  “I’ve been the media’s favorite on-again-off-again villain for thirty years, they’ll move on once the next news cycle hits.”
“Have a good rest of your trip,” Tony says.  “Give me a call when you get back.  Or not.  Up to you.”
Steve stood up and joined Tony at the window.  He knocked his shoulder against Tony’s lightly.  “So we’ll figure it out when we get there.”
“One of my friends growing up, his dad had a still in the basement,” Steve said.  “It wasn’t a big op, just made it for him and his buddies in the neighborhood, but he let us keep it going after ‘33 because we were underage for a few more years.  Anyway, one time, I was maybe sixteen, we got drunk and took the train into Manhattan and went swimming in the pond in Central Park.  And it’s not like it was allowed back then, but it was a hot night, you know, and we were kids, but anyway some cop came by and chased us away and we ran all the way to Rockefeller Center carrying our clothes.  Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Oh, wait,” Tony says theatrically.  “Wait a second.  I feel like there might be some other people who know what that feels like.”  Tony shakes his head sadly.  “Too bad you don’t know any of them.  Imagine if there was somebody you could actually
Natasha drives a knife into the top of his hand.  His scream echoes through the building, just like Natasha wanted it to; now there are at least three hotspots.
“Do you think you’ll ever jump in and tell everybody what to do?” Tony said.  “I mean, don’t you wish you’d called up the president and been like,
The rules keep it in a box, taped shut and tucked in a drawer where no one - not even one of them - can see it, or question it, or break it.
and Steve was swallowing him down to the root.  “Fuck,” Tony said, and pulled out, “you don’t have to - ”
Tony pulls back.  “Jesus Christ.  You too?  You think I should have done it differently?  You’re on their side?”
“So what, you want to take it all on yourself?  Maybe get yourself killed doing it, just for good measure?”
"Not physically," Bruce says.  "I mean, you can, but we've pretty firmly established that won't work."
“Duck?” Pierce says blankly, and that’s when Stark pulls his hand out of his pocket, aims at the opposite wall, and fires.
Steve doesn't reply.  He has no idea where Tony and Pepper stand, and even though Tony's hand is currently working its way up his thigh, he doesn't really see it as his place to ask.  "I've never been here before," he says instead.  "Used to be ski resorts, right?"
“It’s a pleasure.  You’re one of Mr. Stark’s new friends, right?” Her eyes are bright and curious, and Steve wonders what exactly she knows.
The tower starts to fill up again.  It’s Tony’s employees, mostly, R&D and government affairs and a fully-staffed marketing department that hasn’t had a consumer product to market in going on six years, but the top ten floors hum with life too, because the Avengers are back.
"Man, without my suit I'm just a regular guy, the fuck am I supposed to do against the PED twins?" Sam said, gesturing at Steve and Bucky.
“You shouldn’t have done that,” Steve says as the last cameraman skitters into the elevator.  “He’ll be coming for you next.”
"I'm okay," he says, as blood seeps through the fingers he's got pressed over his shoulder.  "Let's get these guys out of here, huh?"
“Off topic for Captain America to talk about why he insists on protecting a killer?  How can you even call yourself Captain America anymore?”  Jameson leans forward, and Tony is reminded of a lion going in for the kill.  “You may have used your influence to avoid accusations of treason in the past, but there are still people who are determined to make sure you answer for the crimes we know about, and the ones we don’t.  How would you respond to them?”
“Hey, I’m just saying,” Tony said, holding up his hands in surrender.  “Stand down, soldier.  You’re the one who said - ”
” Steve gasped as Tony got a hand between them and wrapped it around both of their cocks, the lube and spit slick as Steve fucked his hand.  “I can’t - I’m not going to - I want to see you come - ”
Stark’s smirk flickers for just a moment.  “Funny thing about that is that I reported it myself in 1917.”
They’re up the stairs, half-undressed, against the bedroom closet door, before the Harley’s engine stops pinging.
“This is one of the top four most embarrassing moments of my life,” Steve said.  “The most embarrassing moment of my life was - ”
“It’s not really a question,” Tony says.  “It’s more of a - it’s an idea, really.  A thought.  Question is probably a stretch, actually, it’s really more - ”
“But maybe he wouldn’t have been able to if it weren’t for me,” Tony says.  “If it weren’t for me, maybe three of the Infinity Stones would have been a little harder find.”
“Good thing the police are on their way,” Steve says through the team’s comm line.  “I have them setting a cordon a block in every direction.  Think I can sneak up on this guy from behind?”
“If you say so,” Tony says.  He tightens the string of his undershorts.  “Sure you won’t stay for breakfast?  No, I guess not, I’m sure you’ve got plenty to do - Happy can give you a ride home.”
and slows down at the main entrance.  It’s already been a day, to say the least; what’s a little aggressive paparazzi action to round it out?
“You guys took ten years off my life,” Tony said.  “You ran away, you screamed, you cried, you ignored all the rules that I put in place to
here,” the man says, his voice all feigned surprise.  “I heard the lady who runs this place is a real fighter.  She wouldn’t leave those poor folks upstairs to fend for themselves, would she?”
“It stopped me for a minute,” Steve said when he came up for air.  “But then I had to start talking again.  I don’t feel like I can stop talking.”
He blinks a couple of times and looks down at the code he’s working on.  One of the (very few) positives from the post-Snap period was the continued shift away from fossil fuels, but it turns out that the battery breakthrough Tony had in ‘21 needs a few touch-ups, and if he can just get the last transistor right he can send it to QA and -
“As long as I can,” Tony said, and when Steve slid his hand across the mattress like a careful question, Tony threaded their fingers together and held tight.
"Miss Romanov," Stark says, flashing his teeth at her.  "So good to see you, as always.  How's business?"
“I should hit the hay,” Tony said, leaping to his feet.  “Big day tomorrow.  Planning.  Plotting.   Saving the world.  The usual.”
Here’s the other thing: even at the best of times, “stocking the kitchen” had never been high on the list of priorities for anyone currently living on the base, which meant that the ingredients Steve had to work with were a bit… haphazard.  Among the detritus he scraped up were six half-empty bags of rice, twelve avocados careening toward overripe, most of what appeared to be a cornish hen, and absolutely no milk.
Clint hisses, letting loose a flood into her. He collapses out of her and she gratefully lets go of the shelf, letting him pull her into the bed in collapse. She loosens his tie for him, nicely. She'll let him lick an orgasm out of her once he catches his breath. He cracks one eye and peers at her.
“After he went up to talk to them,” Sam says.  “Tried to talk them down.  When he wakes up he’ll probably say it’s his own damn fault.”
“I have no idea what you’re referring to,” Steve said, his face all innocence, and then he started coughing, a loud, hacking cough that made them all wince in sympathy.  “Just my asthma,” he said between deep breaths.
Bruce shakes his head as if to clear it, takes a deep, calming breath.  He's going pink again.  "I know that wasn't easy," he says.  "Thank you."
“For example,” Beck’s saying on screen, “who was the top contractor leading the clean up after the battle of New York?  Stark Industries.  Who had early notice that half the world was coming back, enough to put all his consumer facing businesses back to work so they were first to market with all kinds of post-Blip tech?  Stark Industries.”
“Clint,” Natasha said, shooting him a look that was probably meant to be subtle but which was, instead, extremely obvious.
be Tony Stark stumbling into the Opus Suite with a blonde on his arm.  It’s a purpose-built trap, custom made for just one target, and sure, if he’s wrong about what happens next there’ll be some explaining to do to Pepper and Rhodey and, oof, Steve, if he cares, but his reputation can take the hit and anyway Tony doesn’t think he’s wrong.
“So the thing about that is that I can’t,” Tony said.  “Nobody else can hear me or see me or, um, anything else with me.”
, so he eats a sumptuous breakfast in the palace ballroom and then hangs out in a conference room for twenty minutes before T’Challa shows up.  “Sorry to drop in unannounced,” Tony says, because his mother raised him to be polite to royalty.  “There’s a situation.”
Bruce shrugs.  “I’ve never really thought about it, but it checks out.  What’s that phrase?  It’s a thin line between love and hate?
“Don’t mention it,” Tony says.  “I mean seriously, don’t.  I didn’t pay import taxes on the vibranium, I’m not a billionaire anymore, this could sink me.”
“I have to take this,” Tony says, swiping through notifications as they pile up and walking blindly out of the room.  “Friday, situation?”
it, thank god you couldn’t die of a hangover because if he’d died before getting that ass in his hands he would have been
“Why not keep it clean and simple?  Just let me know in advance if you plan to run off for two years again, I’ll make sure to get your suit dry cleaned for you.”
“Thanks for coming today, Captain Rogers,” Jameson says, holding out a hand.  Jameson’s rise to online notoriety after the snap was laid on a foundation of conspiracy theories and built with bricks of panic and scarcity, so while Tony isn’t exactly surprised that a guy who made a living calling the death of half of humanity a “long-awaited judgment from a higher power” is still seeing enemies everywhere, that doesn’t mean he’s not taking it personally.
“That’s what I thought,” Bucky gloated as Tony pushed up his facemask and began the long, slow walk to the mound.
“What it’s about is that I’m in love with you and I want you to live with me and I should probably have just said that instead of trying to decode your fucking dental hygiene habits,” Tony said.
“Of course you don’t,” Tony said.  “I’m just a figment of your imagination.  What do I know?  Good luck with the double date, Cap.”
“I’m sorry, considering it was my shell launcher that saved all of your lives, you mean?” Tony says, sauntering out from the back room with Banner.  “Yeah, let me just pile on the apologies for the property damage, you have my deepest sympathies - by the way, Romanov, since we have to, you know, re-build the walls anyway back here, you want to put in a toilet?  Indoor plumbing’s the cat’s pajamas.”
She flinches even in advance of the belt, which lands with a fat leather thwack. She gnaws her lip against the advance of tears, which are already brimming in the corners of her eyes.
“Thor, out of there,” Tony snapped, and Thor jumped out of bed and sauntered out of the room.  “Same goes for you.  For all of you!  The rules apply across the board.  JARVIS will be watching.  Capisce?  Great.  Back to your regularly scheduled teenagering.”
before Pepper, nothing serious, and before she moved to Hollywood she’d actually gotten a degree in biochemistry from Harvard so the pillow talk had always been better than usual.  There’d never been any hard feelings, and in the sea of wealthy donors and Stark Industries execs swarming the fundraiser for May Parker’s Blip Displacement charity, she was a breath of fresh air.  “How are you these days?”
He froze.  Steve was at the edge of the pool, and he was - yes, Tony was pretty certain this wasn’t a dream, this was really happening - he was stepping out of his jeans, he was dropping his briefs, he was
“What, the party?  I throw parties all the time.  Gotta do something with all the booze I’m smuggling into the country - ”
“So if you were serious about that invite to our room we should probably go, because I don’t want anyone to walk in on us, but I also don’t care enough to stop,” Steve said, pressing kisses down Tony’s neck.
Pepper listens patiently when he explains it to her, and suggests, not unkindly, that she keep Morgan in Pennsylvania through the weekend so she’s not exposed to the media frenzy outside Stark Tower.  Bruce makes him a smoothie and hangs around looking generally troubled.  Fury sends him a text that reads, ominously,
Steve takes a sip of his drink and looks around.  The Hawk is still watching them, but nobody is in hearing distance.  "FBI.  But I'm not Prohibition unit."
“Edgar gave me a tour of the cellars,” Tony said.  “There were samples.  I’m in a good place.  Is Thor around?”
“Just stopping by for a little vacation, Mr. Barton?” Edgar said, accompanying them all up the front drive.
“I thought you said this wasn’t a vacation,” Tony said, leaning against the pillar next to him.  “Everybody’ll sleep off their hangovers tomorrow and then we’ll get back to business.  Plus, you guys weren’t going to get anything done today, not after - well, you know.”
, Steve.  I try really hard to get things right, but we both know that at the end of the day I cause a lot of my own problems, this one included.  I didn’t want you to see that side of things.”
) had emerged from their rooms by the time the pizza arrived, so Tony set everything up, leaned back in his chair, and just waited.  Frankly, he’d have happily locked them all in their rooms until they grew up, but JARVIS said that was unkind and not a long-term solution and also that he’d show the footage to Steve when they were adults again, so Tony eventually caved and called out over the comms system, “Dinner’s on the table, last one out does the dishes.”
Steve rolls his eyes and swallows Tony down, and doesn't call Tony out on the lie when they spend the whole night in New Hampshire, pressed together under the blankets and watching snow out the window.
“Considering it was his shell launcher that nearly blew up the whole place, I’d say he owes it to you,” Steve says.
On the second floor, Mrs. Letendre stands, hair silvering in the steam, over a boiling tub of diapers, tending to the sanitizing wash and a fuming kettle of cabbage simultaneously. She has flung open all the doors and windows in her family's tiny apartment to deal with the sweltering heat, and she nods to Natasha without recognition, her spectacles as befogged as a lobsterman's.
“Well, considering she’ll be the director in a decade, I guess you’ll have an in,” Tony said.  “Does she know?”
“Nah,” Steve says.  “I went all the way to LA in the middle of the night for a fella once.  Didn’t even get laid.”
“Please, Cap, spare me, everybody knows that when SHIELD found you in the ice, the plane you were in was full of other, slightly smaller planes.”
"No, I imagine it’s probably not," Stark says.  "So is it his wartime service or the mob stuff?  Banner, I mean - which part are you interested in?"
“It had to have taken you a while to set up this little stunt,” Steve snaps.  “So why weren’t we read in?”
They all spin toward the staircase to see a man in a dark suit step through the doorway.  Steve steps forward automatically, and out of the corner of his eye he sees Barton reaching under the bar and Natasha’s hand sliding to her waist - but then someone else steps through the door and Steve freezes.
"Good evening, gentlemen," Killian says with a smile as four goons fill in behind him.  "Funny seeing you here, Tony."
"Can I get a scotch, neat?" Stark says loudly, sliding up to the bar on Banner's other side.  "Hi, there.  I'm Tony Stark, haven't I seen you here before?"
have his head in the game: the opposing team's runs had been limited not because Steve was pitching a strong game but by dint of his being the actual peak of human perfection.  He was throwing balls left and right, literally, but luckily even blindfolded Steve probably could have pitched a better game than half the MLB, which was probably why he was preemptively banned from three out of four professional sports leagues in North America.  (The NHL kind of seemed to hope he'd enter the draft one day, just for the ratings).
“That’s disappointing,” Tony said, trying to be cool even though he was about one second from turning into a puddle of goo at Steve’s feet.  “Cause normally you’re pretty competitive, so I was kinda expecting you to be a little more focused on the game, you know?”
“I didn’t think so,” Pierce says.  “And we don’t know of any connections between Blonsky or Killian and Zemo, do we?”
Steve spun around, and the landscape completely changed, but Steve didn’t really notice, because Tony was standing right in the middle of it.  “Hey.”
“Cap, I’m joking, it’s fine,” Stark says.  “Half the house is full of people making good use of closed doors; if I ever had any privacy, I sure don’t now.  Jarvis!”
It was Tony’s first lesson in what happens when you walk straight into a teenager’s trap, but it would not be his last.  “No I cannot, because that’s illegal.”
Time passes.  Tony updates the rest of the team, leaves a message for Pepper, gets a coffee.  Sam comes by, then leaves again.  Barnes doesn’t move from his seat.  Finally -
“Your words, not mine,” Tony said.  “So if you don’t like cooking, why’d you spend all day perfecting your Ina Garten impression?”
, Tony thought.  “The Palace Hotel,” he said.  “Their trees are the best in the city, and I’ve always thought, wouldn’t one of those trees look
“I know that,” Tony says.  “And I’m not saying I need to keep track of you.  You don’t owe me anything.  That’s not how this works, we agreed on that a long time ago.  But it’s - it means something to me, okay?  It’s not supposed to, but it does.
“So here’s a question,” Stark says, popping up from behind the bar.  “You sure you want this place, Aldrich?”
,” Barton says, tipping back his glass of whiskey.  “It was nothin compared to Rogers with that shield.  Did you guys see him hit that goon in the face with it?  His nose is
“Somebody who works for Blonsky and Killian and Schmidt?”  Stark whistles softly.  “People don’t just
The kind of bad guys that they used to deal with back before Thanos - HYDRA, and the Abomination, and the Mandarin - all seem to be pretty quiet these days, but the creeping tendrils of corruption neatly fill the holes they left.  They get word of someone re-routing supply lines from upstate and track the rumor to a warehouse in Queens that's filled with black market weapons and gasoline and canned goods and manned by what seem to be mostly teenagers.
"Because I said so."  Tony opens up the hatch and walks right inside, and Steve considers putting his foot down, telling Tony to go to hell and storming right back to his room, but instead he follows Tony onto the jet.
Steve bristles.  “I wasn’t being nosy.  It’s just that a couple of ladies jumped in the pool, and now they’re walking around in just their underthings and I wanted to get them some towels to - ”
“I’m saying I’m out,” Steve says.  “And I’d suggest you all get out too.  Alexander Pierce is dangerous.”
It shouldn't be funny but it is, and when Steve starts laughing Tony does too, and they barely remember to turn off the burner on their way to the bedroom.
“We’re good,” Coulson said.  “We leaked a report that everybody came out of the fight pretty banged up so nobody will be suspicious if they just stay home for a few days.  Keep them out of sight and alive, and we’ll sort it out soon.”
Tony pulled away with a sly grin.  “Sorry about that.  It’s just that I met my childhood hero, and, well, you know.  Might not get another chance.”
Banner fiddles with the edge of his jacket and looks up at Steve.  "Emil Blonsky doesn't let his people socialize much.  You come in, you do your work, and if you're lucky you go home at the end of the night in one piece.  Your friend - "
Steve snorts and puts out his cigarette, grabs the apple off the railing.  Tony always brings snacks, even though Steve's the one who always wants to eat after sex, and as Steve takes a bite Tony asks, "Do you have to leave?"
“Wilson, heads up,” Tony says, sliding a beer across the bar in Sam’s direction.  “Anybody else?  Beer?  Wanda?”
That’s how he knew this one was a dream: Tony was staring at him, biting his lip and smirking.  Steve wanted him closer, and because it was a dream, suddenly he
“And now you want me to take a look,” Tony says.  “Send over everything you have and maybe I’ll forgive you for forgetting to send my invite.”
of them were suffering as a result of the newest and most exhausting one.  Pepper was sympathetic to his plight, and he’d mostly been able to appease her with photos he snuck of the kids (several of which she had promised to get framed and delivered to the Tower as soon as things were back to normal), but by late in the afternoon even her patience was wearing thin, so Tony went down to the workshop to make a few of the new models that he’d promised to her, oh, three weeks ago.
It’s like a grenade, Steve thinks as he throws his hands over his face automatically, but the shrapnel doesn’t come, just noise and smoke and a hell of a lot of confusion.  Several men stumble backwards, tripping over chairs and crashing into each other, and someone lets off a volley of bullets.
“Fuck, you look good,” Tony murmured, clenching his hands in Steve’s hair, and it must have been a little too tight because Steve groaned, all beautiful vibrations, and Tony released him with an apologetic, “sorry, sorry - ”
“You can’t act like you’re gonna enjoy watching this thing, Cap.  This is torture.  I have actually been tortured, multiple times, and honestly, this is worse.”
They watched a car trundle by on the street below.  Steve leaned into Tony’s shoulder; after a minute, he realized Tony was leaning back.
“Okay, buddy,” Tony said.  He leaned back, away from Steve, until he was almost on the other end of the couch.  “Whatever you want.”
go into the past and risk a catastrophic disruption of the flow of the entire 20th century just so you could get laid, but - ”
," she tells him, knowing she is the unquestioned authority. Knowing he would die for her. Knowing she holds the key to every one of Clint Barton's orgasms on her tongue. "I was thinking about you, while I was flirting with Thor this morning."
He looked around the table.  Bruce looked like he wanted to crawl under the table on Tony’s behalf.  Thor looked perplexed.  Natasha was clearly trying not to laugh.  Clint’s mouth was hanging open, revealing a disgusting mix of cranberry sauce and green bean casserole and, sidenote, ew, Clint, why
“A ball indeed!  One that seemed reasonably slow and hittable to me, but then again, that is why Son of Coul is the master of the game and not yours truly,” Thor boomed.
“So anyway, I just want to make sure to say that I… I had a good time,” Steve said, looking up and holding Tony’s gaze.  “And if that’s all it ever is, then it was still a good time.  So thanks.”
It’s pandemonium.  The men in the room are ready to kill for their bosses but if it’s all the same they’d rather not die for them, and they’ve never seen anything like a man made of metal who can light fires with his hands, a man who bullets bounce off as they empty their chambers in his direction.  Even Steve has to admit it’s startling, and he’s seen the clockwork man before and guessed its use; to someone with fresh eyes, it must look like a monster straight out of a nightmare, all shining tin and flashing fire and dark, soulless eyes.
"Yeah, I do," Stark says.  He advances on Steve in the dim hallway.  "Romanov might not think you're here to cause trouble, but I don't think I trust you, Rogers."
“Even though those years were shitty for a lot of people,” Tony says, and he hears his voice getting louder.  “Even though, arguably, we
,” Steve gasped, and he came, his hips stuttering as he fell over the edge with Tony’s voice in his ear.
“Okay,” Tony said.  “Now we’re getting somewhere.”  Steve could imagine him shifting on the bed behind him, and he reached down and grasped himself, just to relieve some of the pressure.  “Where was I touching you?”
They leave the warehouse in pairs; Steve and Miss Romanov go first and head toward the Rector Street station, while Stark and Banner climb into one of Stark’s cars and zoom off with a squeal of tires.
“I fired that guy,” Tony says.  “I can’t remember why, but I definitely fired that guy, and for good reason, clearly.  This is a
“I can,” Steve said, rolling his eyes and undoing Tony’s button, yanking his jeans down so that Tony’s cock popped free.  “I can’t wait to get you in my mouth.”  He looked up at Tony, a blush staining his cheeks again.  “Can you just - try to not listen to anything I say?  Thanks.”
“Friday,” he says, but he doesn’t need her silence to know she won’t reply.  It’s an EMP, intense and localized, and Tony has all kinds of defenses against exactly this type of attack but Beck’s a goddamn
.  The turkey was moist, the potatoes perfectly mashed, the stuffing bready and crunchy all at once.  The yams were like eating candy and vegetables at the same time, but in a good way.  Tony was, almost, for once in his life, actually enjoying Thanksgiving.
“For the record, I was against it,” Steve said, holding up a finger, and then they all burst into fresh peals of laughter.
"Over my dead body," Romanov says.  She ducks under a bodyguard's swing and snags his wrist, then twists his arm behind his back.  "Clint?"
“So, what’s next?” Tony asks quietly later, when Steve’s head is on his chest and their legs are tangled together under the too-starchy sheet of the motel bed.  He says it so casually that a few months ago Steve wouldn’t have heard the request in it, careful and quiet.
Steve doesn't get involved in whatever's going on between them.  He catches them together sometimes in the kitchen, heads bent close, murmurs passing back and forth, and on other days he sees them avoid each other's eyes as they pass in the hallway.  This, Steve thinks, is why
“I’m just being polite,” Tony says, but Steve’s smirk shows that he knows it’s a lie so Tony gives in.  “All right, all right, I missed this.  “New York, I mean.  Pennsylvania’s nice, but it’s not - ”
“I’ll let you take one for a spin, if you want,” Stark says.  “Look, there’s always going to be somebody in charge, and frankly I don’t give a shit which politician is which, but the mob bosses - they’re not just in it for the power and the money.  They’re in it because they get off on hurting people, and making people hurt other people.  And right now, they own most of the politicians and police officers in New York.”
“And it was good to see everybody,” Tony said.  “You know, in a casual way.  When we’re not actively planning a suicide mission.  So, thanks for that.  And, you know.  Other things.  A lot of other things.  Normally I would never say this because I don’t want to give you the satisfaction, but I couldn’t have done - well, a lot of things, without you.  We didn’t always get it right, but damn, when we did, it was pretty spectacular, right?”
wipe away five years from the people who Blipped, all because I was selfish and couldn’t risk disappearing my kid - ”
Steve wakes up to a subsonic rumble, far away, over the Gulf. Warm air is rolling in through the open shutters, and when Steve steps out onto the tiny balconet he can smell ozone. The breeze ruffling through his hair is warm and humid and yellow with pollen. Steve watches the faraway storm while rooting around in his front jeans pocket, finding only half of what he’s looking for. He sticks the cigarette in his mouth and waits, smirking when he hears the snick of a lighter behind him.
Stark barks a laugh.  “It was supposed to be a quick visit, just to see some of my weapons in action.  Artillery, machine guns, a couple of tanks I’d modified, the basics.  Our transport exploded an hour after I arrived.  Spent three weeks under heavy fire.”
Bruce wandered in eventually, so engrossed in thought that he didn’t seem to notice any of them, much less the rapidly-expanding spread that was starting to fill every available flat surface in the kitchen.  He was halfway to the fridge before he looked up.  “Oh,” he said, blinking his way into the present moment.  “Is someone cooking?”
“No, it’s,” Steve said, his eys slowly widenining with horror, “it’s that I’m worried that if I’m alone with you I’ll tell you how much I think about having sex with you oh god no.”
“Because until like a year ago I thought it was going to be me and Pepper forever, so I’m clearly pretty bad at working this stuff out, right?  Better to get it over with and maybe go back to being slightly awkward friends.”
“There’s no rush, really,” Tony says as Steve snaps shut the suitcase full of the most powerful items in the universe, picks up Thor’s hammer (
Tony rolls his eyes.  “Probably a safe bet, but I was talking about his suit.  Joints seem like a good place to start, should we go for joints?  Try ripping directly from where they meet the backpack part, maybe - ”
He drops his shield in the hallway and is about to clear the labs when Tony steps right in front of him.
“Nope,” Tony agrees.  “I see her more than my dad saw me, though, so I guess I could be doing worse.”
“I kissed you when I thought you weren’t real,” Steve said.  “And speaking of things I did when I thought you weren’t real - ”
“I mean, it’s not like I have a lot of options,” Tony said, taking a swig.  “When I asked Edgar if he had any McCallan, you’d think I kicked his cat.”
After much moaning and gnashing of teeth and Google searches for “hangover cause of death possible?” and “wine good with yams poison”, Tony dragged himself down to the kitchen.  Someone had cleaned it pretty thoroughly - Tony had to assume Steve, because at heart he really was a nice guy, the bastard - and luckily even the scent of burnt hair was mostly gone.  Tony dry heaved in the direction of the sink while his coffee brewed, which was classy, and halfway through his second cup of caffeine, just as he began to feel slightly more like a human being than something a Chitauri coughed up, the worst happened.
“I think you need to be able to open a PDF to get a regular 9-5 these days,” Tony said, peering into the wine fridge.  “Do we want a cab or a pinot?”
, sure,” Tony said, pulling off his t-shirt and dropping it on one of the lounge chairs, “but I didn’t think
Well, smarty pants, it turns out most of the Avengers live in New York.  Tony watches the news with everybody else, wonders about the guy in green with the scuba mask gone wrong, which, look, Tony’s done the secret identity thing, he gets it, but it’s inconvenient and when he’s really honest he kind of hopes Fury is all over this one.
Steve jumps back so fast he nearly loses his balance for the first time since the serum.  He spins wildly toward the door; in the bedroom, Tony’s butler stands behind a cart piled high with food and looks completely unconcerned at the fact that he just found his master with his hand down another man’s trousers.
Tony sat next to him quietly for a while.  If Steve had needed any more confirmation that the man beside him was a hallucination, he wouldn’t have needed it anymore; the real Tony Stark had never been silent for so long in his entire life.
The man behind him gives him a shove, and Steve, his heart thudding in his chest, stumbles down the hall after Pierce.
“If wine did anything to me I’d’ve been drunk by noon,” Steve admitted, a smile threatening his face.  “Which I… also didn’t mean to admit.”
“Every time somebody tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die,” Steve said.  “Every time.”
“Ugh, no, why, I don’t want to give that guy views,” Tony says, batting a hand out to close the screen, but Bruce holds the tablet out of reach.
There's a creak from the other side of the bar, and the door swings open.  A man in a long, scruffy coat and a fraying hat looks around nervously and then takes a seat at the bar.
"Not that it matters," Natasha says one day as they stand behind the glass in his lab, watching him pump himself full of epinephrine, dopamine, steroids, in different combinations and at dosages that would kill a normal man several times over.  "There's nothing to smash right now, anyway."
Then he noticed that the French doors were wide open, the curtains fluttering slightly in the breeze.  He knew there was only one person who could be out there, and it wasn’t like
“You really think you’re the only person in the whole galaxy smart enough to invent time travel, Stark?” Nebula says when he shares this perspective.
“Nobody’s buying beer,” Tony started, which was rich considering he’d definitely started drinking when he was younger than they were now, but that was the
They didn’t talk about it the next time Tony showed up, which was more proof (not that Steve needed any) that Tony was just a figment of his imagination.  The real Tony would never have let him live it down.
“I’m not working the Blonsky case, but I know who is,” Steve says.  “Could be a time when I know something about a raid or somebody they’re about to come down hard on.  A couple hours in either direction could make a big difference.”  Steve feels filthy even saying it, until he thinks about the number of bodies that usually get hauled out of a major raid, and the idea of looking under one of those sheets and seeing the face he’s looking for.
“Whoa,” he says.  He looks around at all of them and then grins weakly up at Steve.  “I hope somebody kissed me.”
Tony gets push notifications about the geopolitical instability caused by presidents and ministers and kings who think they’re still in charge when the reappeared after five years, but he leaves the politics to T’Challa, doesn’t pay much attention until his phone rings late one night.
“I’m aware,” Bruce says quietly, and Steve advances on him, doesn’t quite crowd him but doesn’t leave him a lot of space to breathe either.
,” Tony says, and they all roll their eyes.  “Look, for all we know there are people time traveling all over the place and we don’t have any idea.”
“Does anybody else have any secret businesses they’d like to share with the class?” Tony said, whirling on the other Avengers.  “Are you hiding a Peruvian banana farm from me, Bruce?  Cap, please tell me you’re not running a nail salon in Queens.”
suited for dealing with the dangers of today’s world,” Beck says in the background, where the video from Jameson’s site is playing on repeat, which even Tony can admit maybe isn’t the healthiest thing to do but look, give him a break, okay?
“Well,” Tony said, “at this point I kind of thought we already were and I got used to the idea, so.”
from a few weeks ago, please don’t apologize, it was the best thing that’s happened to me since I died,” Tony said.
“Of course not,” Peggy said.  She smiled, pressed a quick kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth.  “Perhaps we’ll break it in tonight?  I’ve got to take a call.”
All eyes swivel toward Stark.  “Mr. Stark,” Pierce says calmly.  “You’ve gotten mixed up with the wrong crowd.”
“Not too bad at the afterparty either, if I do say so myself,” Tony says, his hand sliding into Steve’s slacks.
“Yes, the Black Widow, a known assassin and spy,” Jameson says, and Tony feels Sam tense beside him.  “Responsible for at least fourteen known hits against American citizens.  Died a hero, I’m sure.”
“Oh, you know,” Tony says.  “The usual.  Blowing shit up.  Sitting around waiting for bigger and better beings to tell us how to get revenge on the galaxy’s worst urban planner.  We had a Code Green the other day.”
Natasha licks her lip and looks around. Clint has his finger resting on the trigger of his shotgun.  Thor’s grabbed a hammer from behind the bar, and he looks excited to finally get to use it.  Stark’s got his armband out, but his eyes keep darting toward the back door.  And Bruce is breathing deeply, his gaze locked on Natasha.
“So, the energy readings from this thing are weird, right?  Sure, that checks out, it’s supposed to be an elemental water monster, whatever, but the
“Exactly,” Tony says.  He turns back to the Mark LIV.  “Got work to do.  Catch you on the flip, Jolly Green.”
Stark fires again, and Barton barely jumps out of the way of a fireball.  "Goddammit, Stark!" he yells, taking out his anger by throwing another punch.
“It’s not an entirely different set of rules - there are some fabrics these days with tensile strength you wouldn’t believe.  You think Natasha’ll be angry if I guess her dress size?”
Friday projects the feed from the living room.  Steve and Morgan are in the living room with a giant pad of paper spread out on the coffee table; off to the side, there are a matched set of empty bowls with the dregs of milk and a few soggy Fruit Loops.
“Why, fingers getting itchy?” Tony said, watching as the energy sensor on the time machine approaches 100%.
With impeccable timing, Sir Mix-a-Lot blasted through the manor, and Tony released Steve’s face like he’d been burned.  This was getting dangerous, and stupid, and really short-sighted, and Tony knew that because he knew dangerous and stupid and short-sighted

of experience, with all kinds of people, women, men, younger, older, supermodels and politicians, CEOs and Oscar winners, a
Because Steve is a self-sacrificing glutton for punishment, when J. Jonah Jameson asks him for an interview, he takes it.  And because Tony is, for reasons he can’t explain and doesn’t care to try, apparently the newly self-appointed president of the Steve Rogers Cheerleading Committee, he offers to host it.
“So Peggy, what is it you do again?” Bob said.  “Steve mentioned you have a job, but he’s never said what it is.”
“Don’t worry, I do.”  Steve picks up some kind of distended light bulb, frowns at it, and puts it back down.  “You need something?  Because you know, most people, when they want to talk, they call you up on the telephone, maybe try to catch you at a diner or something.  Most people don’t send their driver to come pick people up off the street.”
her movies, and there’s something in the back of Tony’s head that makes him think this is a bad idea, but he can’t quite remember what it is right now.  He’ll probably figure it out in the morning.
"And ladies."  From out of the smoky gloom, a woman glides up to the table.  Her dark red hair is done up in tight, close-cropped curls, and her dress leaves just enough to the imagination.  "I hear we have an unexpected visitor."
“I very much doubt that,” Steve says, poking his head around a corner nosily.  “In fact, I can say with some certainty that - what the
“I’d love one, Miss Romanov, and how about an ice cold water for my friend Dr. Banner,” Stark says, pushing up to the bar.  “Almost didn’t see you there, Rogers.”
Steve looks up, surprised.  “Thanks, Miss Hill.”  He hurries over to the phone room and lifts the received to his ear.  “This is Agent Rogers.”
“I leave underwear in your middle drawer because my underwear always disappears when I stay overnight and I have to go back to my floor commando,” Steve said.  “Do you hide them? Do you have Dummy sneak in during the night to steal them?  It doesn’t make
“Probably because I think about it all the time,” Steve said.  “Even though I’ve only had it four times with three different people.”
Steve goes very still, just for a moment, and then says, “I have no idea what you’re talking about, sir.”
The stones sit in their case in the center of Tony’s kitchen table, and nobody seems to want to look at them.  Bruce keeps his eyes down, his arm held protectively against his chest; Rhodey kicks his feet up on the table; Thor stands in the corner, looking out the window.
“I was about to ask you the same thing,” Tony said.  “You’re out here pitching like you just graduated from t-ball, what’s going on with you?”
?  Who reads their bro’s biography?  Also, it’s weird that you have a biography, isn’t grown up you only like 30?  Anyway, maybe you’re totally doing it in your adult form!”
“We weren’t expecting so many people,” one of the men says.  The light gleams off his sawed-off shotgun, and Steve suspects he’s Ivan Vanko.  “I’m not a fan of uninvited guests.”
“Too much?” Tony says, and when he looks up at Steve he’s a little bit defiant and a little bit hopeful and Steve smiles at him, the muscles a little rusty but surprisingly willing, at least at the moment.
“No, it didn’t.  I don’t communicate with you via the subtleties of bathroom implement placement.  It’s hard enough to communicate with you via totally straightforward conversation.”
But Tony doesn’t always want things for very long, and when he does, he tends to break them.  This feeling, the tightness in his chest and the way his skin feels like it’s aching, it’s
“Am I going to have to dance on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Eve show?” Tony asked, resigned.  “Because if it’s that, I need to open another bottle of champagne
“A hundred times,” Steve said.  “Sometimes I imagined it would be late at night and you’d lean across the table and tell me you wanted me.  Sometimes I thought I’d ask you out to dinner and hold your hand under the table like I woulda tried when I was a kid.  Sometimes I pretended you would take off your helmet and pin me up against the wall so I couldn’t move and touch me until I came in my uniform Tony please kiss me again so I stop talking - ”
“Well, then, that answers that,” Tony said, undoing Steve’s zipper and drawing his cock out of his briefs, keeping his touch light and teasing.  “You want me to keep going?”
"What are you doing," he says, like he's lost. "Your man is right there in the hallway watching us from the shadows, he's been there since you got here. You tryna get me killed, Miss Romanov? Because I think you'll find that's not going to go well. For either of us," he adds as Natasha steps forward into his space again.
"Oh my god, you came all the way to LA," Tony said, pinching the bridge of his nose.  "This is the worst booty call ever."
And then there was Clint.  Somewhere between joining the circus and becoming SHIELD’s best medieval weapon, Clint had learned to Cook with a capital C.  Clint had Opinions on grass-fed vs. corn-fed beef.  Clint knew the difference between broiling and baking, and openly disdained of anyone who didn’t.  Clint
.  “We may have a situation in Mexico.  A small town was destroyed by a cyclone last week - only a few casualties, but destruction on a mass scale.  Problem is, I haven’t seen cyclones with faces before.”
“I don’t think ‘offended’ is the word he’s looking for,” Clint said, and if Tony hadn’t desperately needed the towel at that moment for various coverage reasons, he would have thrown it at Clint’s face.
“But it makes sense, too.  There aren’t a lot of people who know it’s like.  Being - being one of you.”
"You keep your hands on that shelf," he tells her as he yanks her hips into his, increasing the pace.
“Nah, that’s enough existential dread for one day,” Tony says, standing up.  “Thanks, Doc.  Do you bill my insurance?”
But really, it’s fine.  Tony can fly, after all. He can duck out for a few hours a couple times a week, make sure the team’s settling into the tower, check in on Peter’s suits, shoot the shit with Bruce in the lab.  Pepper won’t even notice he’s gone.
“Steve,” Tony said.  “Believe me.  You’re two peas in a pod with the guy who wears those clothes.  Just a little bit smaller.”
“Boys,” Miss Romanov says quietly, and they all freeze as the door slides open, allowing a sliver of streetlight into the warehouse.
Tony had never seen Natasha do anything in the kitchen more complicated than opening a Vitamin Water.
, but that’s fine with Tony because he leaves with more vibranium than has legally departed the country in years.  He finishes his designs halfway home, grabs a catnap in the pilot’s seat, and when he gets back to the tower he pulls on his welding mask and gets to work.  Bruce checks in around what must be some meal time - Tony only knows that because he brings a sandwich that he eats half of and leaves the rest for Tony to throw away hours later - and looks over Tony’s shoulder curiously until he gets it.  “Wow,” he says, unhelpfully, and then he claps Tony on the shoulder and leaves him to it.  Vibranium is an unusual metal but it’s pliable, interesting but not too hard to work with assuming you’re a genius, and it only takes Tony a few hours before he’s satisfied.  He tucks the finished product into a nondescript bag and drives across the East River, follows Friday’s directions to Steve’s equally nondescript building in Brooklyn Heights and buzzes the front door.
And then there were the rules.  Not the rules of baseball - everyone pretty much agreed to the rules of baseball, except for Thor, who firmly refused to learn them and had eventually been booed off the field for running the bases backwards so many times that he decided to take on the role of commentator.  No, the problem with the rules in an
But Steve didn’t want to hear it, whatever it was, so he leaned in and kissed Tony, twisted his hand in Tony’s shirt and held him tight, and when the world started changing around them he closed his eyes and thought, to
