He actually sleeps worse when Mary isn’t in bed than he does when she is. Her body next to him is routine by now. The norm. When she’s gone, the bed is a bit too big, the sheets a bit too cold, the room a bit too silent.
It’s three against one, but he gives as good as he gets. His gun gets knocked from his hand at some point, and he takes a brutal punch to the temple which dazes him, but he surrenders to reflex and muscle memory, taking down one guy swiftly and efficiently before moving onto the next. They have both height and weight on him, but he’s scrappy, dropping low and going for pressure points -
“Come on then,” he says, holding out his hand, and Sherlock places the necklace into it, chain coiling against his skin. “You’re needed elsewhere, yeah?”
The jumper slowly lowers to his side, but he doesn’t relinquish his hold on it. “The memory stick containing Mary’s past that John supposedly burned on Christmas Day. The night that everything changed.”
He knows he should have expected her - she’s a staple as much as Big sodding Ben - but the sight of her still knocks the air from his lungs. A punch to the solar plexus that he didn’t see coming.
The words winded John like a punch to the diaphragm. Because it was true: Sherlock sacrificed everything. For him. For them.
“Good,” she replies. “It’s not right for the two of you to be doing this all on your own.” She seems to look at him then, and he truly does wonder what she sees. If she notices how the past 24 hours have aged him. He feels old aches in new places. Or is it new aches in old places?
But instead of answering, Sherlock gets down on his good knee with a grunt and inspects Mary’s untouched side of the bed, sniffing the sheets before moving on to the bedside table. He scoffs at the bottle of Claire de la Lune before opening the drawers and rummaging around, muttering to himself. Slamming them shut, he heads back around the bed to John’s side and does the same to his table. Something he finds makes his ears go red so Greg steps closer and peers over his shoulder. Sherlock is holding an opened box of condoms, looking for all the world like he has no idea what to do with them. It takes every ounce of Greg’s formidable willpower not to laugh.
Rosie realizes it’s the first time she’s been alone with someone she knows since Daddy left her the night before (
He honestly doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. He hasn’t allowed himself to hope for so long, but only Mary would be that cruel. To make him beg for a dead man’s help. A dead man whom John still loves more than he ever loved the woman beside him.
They eventually go down to her flat for some food because Rosamund needs to eat, despite her protestations, and when they return, her belly is full and her eyes are sleepy. The minute she goes up to change into pajamas, Mrs. Hudson’s frail stoicism crumbles and she dissolves into tears she’s been keeping at bay all evening.
“I know he has,” Mycroft replies as he stares at a tablet that seems to have magically appeared in his hand. “Puddle of blood found at the scene was just confirmed to belong to one John H. Watson.”
“Do you have anything appropriate for a child to eat?” he asks instead as he leads Rosamund over to the table in the corner. “Breakfast was rather early this morning.”
A smile ghosts across Sherlock’s chapped lips and he wipes a clumsy hand over his swollen face. “Ugh, that was tedious,” he says, trying for disdain and falling far short of the mark. Luckily, neither Greg nor Mycroft calls him on it.
Rosamund wiggles and he sets her down, watching as she runs into his former landlady’s arms and buries her face in her predictably floral print dress. He has a strange desire to do the same.
He hasn’t been prepared for half the things that have happened to him today, but he’s muddled through on instinct and drive alone.
“Sherlock is dead, Mary.” His throat is tight, his voice thick. “You of all people should know that.”
He doesn’t think, he’s not sure he even breathes, he just bends down and pulls her into his arms, hugging her small body against his own as he walks out the door with her. She’s light and he thanks genetics for her father’s short stature. Her limbs are trembling and every sob that leaves her throat chips away at the mask of confidence he’s put up ever since Mycroft showed up at his sanctuary that very morning.
Sherlock looks back and rolls his eyes, but Greg can practically see his body vibrating with the itch to know
He listens as Sherlock slowly climbs the stairs and waits until the telltale creak of the bedroom door shutting before he lets his shoulders drop and pinches the bridge of his nose.
“One hour of quiet,” she dutifully responds, but her eyes remain on the weapon strapped to her father’s back.
He gives her jam and toast and declares he’s going to get her Daddy back in a tone that gives her no choice but to believe it. While he goes to pack and Mr. Holmes goes outside, she slides off the bench at the kitchen table and wanders into the living room, gravitating toward the bookcase next to the still burning fire. Most of the names she can’t pronounce, but she recognizes one:
And with that, all of the fight seeps out of Sherlock and he collapses into his chair, dropping his head into his hands. His breaths are ragged and wet, and Mycroft closes his eyes, every noise striking him like the lash of a whip. Releasing a heavy sigh, he runs a hand through his hair and adjusts his tie before going over and placing a hesitant hand on Sherlock’s shaking shoulder. His chest warms when Sherlock doesn’t immediately shake it off.
Greg can feel his eyebrows climbing, but he’s honestly not surprised. He’s seen Sherlock with kids at crime scenes. He’s honestly one of the few people he’d trust to do a good job with them.
“Don’t do that. Don’t play nice,” Sherlock admonishes over the roof before sliding into the passenger seat with a huff.
He shook his head and clutched at his hair, backing up until his heels hit the wooden feet of the leather armchair across from Mycroft’s desk. And it was like a switch had been flicked: the fight went out of him like air from a balloon, and he collapsed into the chair, the weight of the truth pushing him into the cushions, enveloping him in leather that was cold and unyielding.
No, the second conversation comes after they’ve returned to Baker Street, after Mrs. Hudson has opened the door and not (shockingly) burst into tears. After she’s gathered Rosie into her arms and pressed lipsticked kisses on her temple. After she’s straightened once more and run a hand through Sherlock’s longer hair, letting her palm rest on his cheek with a look that seems to say
Mycroft clears his throat. “Early this morning.” If he had time for guilt, he might feel it at the hurt look that crosses Lestrade’s face.
Nana stops and leans over, tilting Rosie’s chin up until their eyes meet. “He did. Because someone who was supposed to love your Daddy did something very bad.”
Martha Hudson is not the first to ask that question nor does Mycroft believe she’ll be the last. He doesn’t know what John has told her about Mary Morstan, but she’s no fool. Perhaps he is, though, if he didn’t realize they all seemed to have been waiting for this particular house of cards to fall. John was the only one who was prepared for it.
“There was an… incident,” Mycroft says in response to Lestrade’s confused look, and Sherlock nearly scoffs.
He slows for a second, just a second, and breathes out, feeling the thunderous thud of his heart against his sternum. “Mycroft, did John know Sherlock was alive?”
He runs a hand through his thinning hair and heads for the kitchen because tea seems appropriate. Or at least necessary. He goes about setting the kettle to boil, feeling like he’s just going through the motions because no one is in any fit state to consume it. Sure enough, he sets a cup down in front of Rosamund a minute later, but she doesn’t notice, buried as she is in Mrs. Hudson’s dress.
Which is why he’s able to hear the closing of a car door by someone who’s deliberately trying not to make a sound. Those skills and reflexes he honed during night patrols in the Army haven’t dulled in the intervening years. Stakeouts with Sherlock certainly helped.
She slides out of her seat and follows the man through the living room, past the bookshelf with the newspaper clipping, past the spot in front of the fireplace that looks like it’s waiting for a dog, into the sunlight that seems way too cheery on such a sad day.
His arrival lacked pomp and circumstance and it would have been a wasted effort anyway. After all, it didn’t take long to find them.
“You won't have a problem,” Mycroft clips, turning away from his brother, whose gaze still seems to prick him with a thousand accusations, and staring into the empty fire grate once more.
. He’d never let him live it down. He manages a tight smile for her, and she must see the emotion in his eyes because she pats his cheek and turns, holding Rosamund’s hand as she leads them up the stairs.
“Well, he’s not wrong,” he agrees. “But don’t tell him I said that.” Her smile turns melancholy at that, because she couldn’t tell him even if she wanted to. “Here,” he says, trying to salvage the moment, “I think I have something that belongs to you.” He pulls the stuffed bunny out of his pocket and she gasps, leaning forward for it before catching herself and looking back at Mrs. Hudson.
It was hardly ever a battle of wits with them, but rather wills. Who could cave first? But Sherlock, who had just spent two years trying to hold out as long as possible was simply… tired.
He thinks of Sherlock, who’s God knows where, if anywhere at all, and of Rosie, hiding upstairs and scared out of her mind. His breath is shallow, but he thinks of them. He thinks of them and is calm.
She stares at him for a moment that stretches, kneading a second into an hour and a response into an indictment. As it is, the almighty slam of the door answers for her.
Lestrade barks out a laugh, a surprising but not unwelcome sound that unwinds something within them all.
Greg pushes his need to reconcile the woman he watched pledge her life to one of his best mates with the cold-blooded killer whose crimes were laid out in black ink on pale paper.
Greg should have known his evening was about to go tits up the second he saw the blocked number on his mobile screen. Nothing good ever comes from a blocked number.
Mycroft tampers down his exasperation. If the situation weren’t quite so dire, Sherlock would most definitely be pouting. “Why does Dr. Watson do anything? Perhaps he didn’t want to involve you given the fact that his wife had just tried to murder you.”
Greg narrows his eyes and steps closer, arms still crossed over his chest. He’s spent every minute since that blocked number appeared on his mobile wondering why Mycroft called him. He’s a retired DI who could barely get Sherlock to listen on the best of days. Why on earth is he here? But maybe - just maybe - this is it.
Right turn, honking horn, thumping bass beat, motorway. The van is going too fast now to be able to track the distance with any certainty. He’s lost too much blood to try and estimate it anyway.
“Me?” he blurts, and he briefly wonders if this is what John Watson felt like when he had laid a similar accusation at his feet so many years ago:
“You’re Uncle Greg,” Rosamund’s soft voice interrupts and both he and Sherlock glance over in time to watch Lestrade freeze. If Mycroft had to guess, he'd assume it’s been a long time since he was called that.
“Mycroft,” and it’s her hesitation that has him guessing her question just before it leaves her lips: “Does John know?”
“Yes, love, and I need to get you somewhere safe.” He throws the covers back and scoops her in his arms. The air is cool on her unprotected legs.
The footsteps move away and the light is switched off. Air rushes from her lungs with a whoosh, leaving her lightheaded and nauseous. There’s a bit more banging before the front door is opened and then shut once more.
Nana wipes her mouth with a damp napkin, something she hasn’t done since Rosie became able to do it herself, and gently pushes her hair away from her face, cupping her cheeks in her hands across the table.
He almost expects another punch, but she merely leans forward and brushes her lips on the shell of his ear.
She’s not sure what she expected, but it’s not him. Daddy had once tried to explain what he looked like but she didn’t understand why his cheekbones were so important at the time. She kinda gets it now. He’s missing the coat that her father once said was like a superhero cape, but the hair is the same. Messy and curly and just a bit wild. She loves it. It makes her think of when she was small enough to ride on her father’s shoulders (she still is, though she claims not to be) and used to run her fingers through his hair and make it stick up straight. He never minded.
Mycroft stares at him for a moment, before holding out his hand and letting Lestrade coil the chain in his palm. The pearl in the red flower winks at him in a mocking fashion he’s sure he’s seen on Ms. Morstan’s face before.
“And she’s John’s, so what does that tell you?” He offers a hand and Sherlock stares at it for a moment before taking it and allowing himself to be hauled on unsteady feet. His limp is more pronounced after the day’s emotionally draining activities and Mycroft makes a mental note to force his brother see his old physical therapist while he’s back in town. John won’t appreciate Sherlock neglecting himself, even if it is in the spirit of saving him.
He had watched the plane until it was barely a dot in the sky, and he felt Mary’s arm looped through his like a cement block dragging him under the water that lapped at his chin.
He hears a heavy sigh gust over the line and then Mycroft again knee-caps him with two fucking words:
He wants to smash something, he wants to rail. He wants to wrap his fingers around Mycroft’s neck because he hasn’t felt this useless since Sherlock Holmes stepped off a fucking roof and made John Watson watch. Made them all grieve.
The light in the closet is turned on and it seeps through the cracks in the tiny square door she hides behind.
It’s not a theory Mycroft has dismissed. Still. “I know we’re doing this for John, but I do believe the video might bring Ms. Morstan some measure of comfort as well. I don’t believe she wants to hurt the child.”
A look of wonder ever so briefly crosses her face, before she schools her features into indifference once more. She’s been trained well. It breaks his heart a bit.
is what finishes that sentence, but Sherlock has never asked for company in his life. Or permission. So instead, Greg just says, “Shall we?”
“Not exactly, sweetheart,” Lestrade murmurs, placing her on the sofa. “We’re going to send him a message, but you won’t actually be able to talk directly to him.” He levels a loaded look at Mycroft, as if daring him to contradict.
The bow grates against the bridge for a moment, a jarring screech of self-consciousness as it tries to get reacquainted. As Sherlock tries to remember a past life he never thought he’d revisit. Eventually the noise becomes a melody, and the melody becomes a concerto. Of course Mycroft knows it. It’s Beethoven’s Romance Number 1 in G Major and he wants to roll his eyes -
He forces his face to do anything but the usual, and the minute muscles protest as they attempt to look non-threatening.
Mycroft stops his advance, but remains steadfastly on the path. He looks different yet the same. It’s an impressive feat considering Sherlock hasn’t laid eyes on him in five years.
His toes scrape the concrete as he stumbles between the two men holding him up, dragging him from his home.
“I don’t blame myself,” he says quietly, turning to him with a quiet fury in his eyes. “I blame you.”
“Go get to know your goddaughter. If she’s anything like her parents, I’m sure she’s been listening at the top of the stairs for the last five minutes,” Mycroft reasons and Sherlock smiles as they hear her scurry back to bed.
It’s small to be sure, but not claustrophobic. If he were the type to use those sort of words, he might even call it quaint. They pull to a stop in front of the cottage and he opens the door with, not quite a huff, but it’s close. He’d rather be anywhere but here, truth be told.
he very nearly says and then decidedly doesn’t. He considers the question carefully, though. “I’m not sure she does. Not entirely.”
John was sitting on the grass with the child toddling between his legs, running to pick up a stick or a rock and show him as if it was the first stick or rock that John Watson had ever laid eyes on. And because he was a good father, he acted as if it was, gracing the child with a look of utter amazement.
He had made one caveat, one exception, when he wrote his address down on a piece of paper with the succinct and irrefutable command that he was not to be bothered. Mycroft was not to come to him, but for one reason and one reason only.
“Got one back only to lose another. Quite typical, isn’t it.” She laughs self-deprecatingly and dabs at her eyes with Mycroft’s handkerchief. “Sometimes I do wonder if 221B will ever be full again.”
Sherlock drums his fingers on his knee and presses his fist to his lips once more, closing his eyes and pretending he can still feel the press of John’s palm on his skin.
Detective, whirling about the flat and tugging at his hair. Mr. Holmes and Nana watch him quietly, but carefully, and Rosie knows that this is not an infrequent occurrence. She just wishes the first case she saw him work wasn’t her father’s.
The sound of his daughter’s name jars him. It doesn’t deserve to be spoken in such an awful place by such a conniving person. A conniving person who was supposed to love her.
“I need to go back to the house. I didn’t get enough time there. Before...” he trails off and levels an almost accusing look at Mycroft.
Still, there was no French waiter routine. Upon his return, he’d spent two months in physical therapy, trying to regain the motor function he’d lost due to his haphazard attempts at healing while away. He spent a further six months meeting with a trauma specialist twice a week.
Sherlock stands, nearly losing his balance and needing to steady himself on Greg before limping over to the door and pulling his Belstaff off the hook. “Try not to traumatize her while I’m gone?”
Mycroft tries hard to gauge Sherlock’s disposition but he vacillates between a puppy that’s been kicked and a snake that’s a moment away from striking. He doesn’t even take the time to look around the flat he called home for so many years, too busy pulling at his hair while Rosamund quietly watches from where she’s tucked up against Mrs. Hudson’s side on the sofa.
He snorts and groans. “Can you still call me that if you married me under false pretenses?” His head lolls as he watches her step into the room, shadows throwing her once-soft features into sharp relief the closer she gets to the light. “I want my money back.”
Footsteps, soft and light on the carpet, ascend the stairs. They check her parents’ room first before passing by the closet and heading into hers. An innocent part of her hopes they don’t mess up her blanket fort and the other part hopes they step on the mousetrap behind the door.
“She does,” comes a tiny, but firm voice from the corner of the kitchen and Sherlock can’t help but hide his smile as he buries his head in the cupboard. John Watson’s daughter, indeed.
“Yes, well. Then I don’t hold out hope for you attempting to cope with this.” He follows the IV in the video down to John’s hand, where his wedding ring digs into his swollen finger. “Mary Morstan was born Sophia Moran, the right hand woman to the man known as James Moriarty.” He watches that revelation wash over Lestrade’s face, parting his lips as he looks at the video again and then back at Mycroft. “After Sherlock jumped, she placed herself in Dr. Watson’s surgery, to keep an eye on him. To make sure Sherlock really was dead.”
The flat is painfully quiet and, finally, Rosie asks the question that’s been beating at her heart ever since she heard two gunshots and not much else.
Mycroft visibly swallows which only stokes Sherlock’s anger. His brother does not get to be contrite now. “Yes.”
The little girl has Mary’s ears and nose and John’s everything else. His heart cleaves in two as he stares, thoroughly unable to look away. She is wearing jeans and a jumper which John purchased for her and her hair has been tied back in a sloppy ponytail. He has a feeling that this is also a task that usually falls to John, and John (through YouTube) has gotten rather good at it. The girl is on her own now, though, and not about to ask Mycroft Holmes for help. Not that he’d know the first thing to do anyway.
Funny that, in her head, Mycroft Holmes is Mr. Holmes, but Sherlock is just that. Just Sherlock. Her detective. And if there’s one thing Daddy taught her, it’s to follow the Detective.
Mycroft tilts his head in concession and Sherlock hums, but remains silent. It’s possibly the only thing they’ll agree on tonight.
Sherlock smooths down his shirt front to give his trembling hands something to do. He’s faced megalomaniacs and psychopaths, but who knew it would be a six-year-old that would be his undoing?
“Because my brother was right. I would know.” And he would. He would feel the loss of John Watson as keenly as if someone had hacked off part of his soul.
Mycroft huffs and stands up to his full height because, yes, she’s six, but she’s also the progeny of two of the sneakiest people he knows. He will not be blamed for something that could have happened to anyone, so instead, he latches on to the other particularly poignant piece of information in that sentence.
“Maybe,” he offers. “Probably,” he acquiesces. “She was gone more often than not, and Rosie needed someone to raise her. Stability.” He opens his mouth to continue, but stops himself. Of course, Sherlock (the bastard) picks up on it.
“Hey,” he begins, coming into the living room and kneeling down in front of his daughter. “Let’s build a blanket fort with the fancy quilts Mummy never lets us use, shall we?” He doesn’t mean to be the favorite; more often than not, he’s just trying to distract her from the fact that her mother isn’t here, but he dotes on her because how could he not?
He smiles faintly. “Yes, I believe you would.” He glances around the room for a moment, eyes flitting on things here and there, taking everything in. Storing it in his Mind Palace. “Your father used to sleep here.”
“Is he?” Mycroft had asked, looking at him hard. Forcing him to see what Sherlock was convinced he already knew.
Sherlock gives a sharp, singular nod and takes off down the hall. Much like the Roald Dahl book, Greg shoves the bunny in the pocket of his coat, its floppy ears sticking out, and follows.
And he doesn’t just mean the task at hand. He means the work in general, John Watson in particular, and all that that entails.
Excluding the aftermath of the fight, the house is relatively clean. Neat, but lived in, as evidenced by the basket of clean, folded laundry on the dining room table and the pile of toys and children’s books that have been carefully stacked by the sofa, an old Roald Dahl on top.
Greg notices Sherlock has yet to let go of John’s jumper either, and he watches as Sherlock physically shakes off whatever it was he’d been feeling - whatever ghost had been haunting him - as he pulls the phone out and answers.
He finds himself thinking of the photograph missing from the wall; the one he noticed just as he was drifting off. He should have known then - he’d seen Mary direct more than a few dirty looks in its direction - but he had let sleep carry him, comforted by the notion that he’d look for the picture in the morning.
“No one likes you, Sherlock,” Mycroft replies, and he’s grateful for the joke (accurate though it may be).
“You son of a bitch,” he hisses. “Do you know how many times I had to pull him from a pub when he could barely stand in the early days?”
And then Sherlock says five words that Greg, in all of his wildest theories, never expected to hear:
He’s washed, impeccably dressed, and judiciously packed in the span of 20 minutes, enough time for sodding Mycroft to enjoy his sodding tea and Rosamund to help herself to another piece of toast.
Consciousness is fleeting. It comes to him in flashes, fits and starts, like a memory he can’t quite recall. A dream he isn’t sure is fiction or reality.
“Rain,” a voice says from the doorway, and both Mycroft and Lestrade look up to see Sherlock standing there, pale and gaunt, a specter floating in his own home. “Look up where it’s rained in the last hour.”
“I’m going to get to talk to Daddy?” she asks Mycroft warily, and it hurts something bone deep that she’s already learned to check her emotions like that.
“Trust me,” Greg says, turning away and inspecting a nail in the wall where a picture obviously once hung. “They weren’t.”
“It was dark, but the light caught it. I thought it was a misaimed sniper laser.” He runs his thumb over the necklace, before pulling it from the stand. “I didn’t recognize it the last time she wore it. Granted, I was dying at the time, but…” He looks up and Greg inhales at the sight of tears in his eyes.
Mycroft looks over to find Lestrade hovering in the doorway, looking just as astonished as Mycroft feels. “Productive?”
He’s nearly halfway up the staircase when a shriek pierces the night, a broken “Daddy!” shattering the sheer veil of calm that had settled over the flat.
“Is my Daddy dead?” She looks up at him as her eyes swim and something in his chest twists. He refuses to acknowledge it’s his heart.
Mycroft swallows, but the words still stick in his mouth. After all, it’s not often he utters them. “I don’t know.”
He remembers it as clearly as if it had been yesterday, standing in the door to his brother’s office, nearly caving under the weight of the Belstaff that had finally (mercifully) been placed on his still-boney shoulders.
“You won't have a problem,” Mycroft clips, turning away from his brother’s damning gaze and staring into the empty fire grate once more.
The violin protests as Lestrade asks the obvious question, which Sherlock answers as the screen light dies on the text banner.
Leaning against the wall by the door, he crosses his arms over his chest and just watches, taking in a sight he hasn’t seen in far too long.
He stumbles from the room, preferring his brother witness this very human moment than wake the child who’s been through enough today with his hysterics. By some miracle, he manages to make it down the stairs without falling, still ricocheting off the door frame as he tries to make it to the living room before the sounds he’s withholding escape in earnest. He stops dead, though, at the sight before him.
“Bastard,” he mutters, moving towards the door and throwing it open before his brother can make it up the walk. “I had one rule!” he bellows, sending the redpolls on his bird feeder scattering to the sky.
But the child merely frowns and cocks her head, looking him up and down with far more insight than he’d like. “Like the detective?”
“Thank you,” he says to Nana, looking again like he might cry, but then he spins about and gives the skull a little pat before pressing his fingers to his temple and going utterly still.
“Well,” Lestrade grumbles, “it’s not exactly narrowing down our options.” He glances out the window as rain gently pelts the panes, proving his point.
Another voice calls to him as well, a voice in a timbre of a decidedly lower register, but John Watson has been whispering to him in the back of his mind for the last ten years whether Sherlock chooses to acknowledge it or not.
The plane ride out, with the ghost of John Watson’s palm print pressed to his mouth, was disgustingly simple. Turbulence free, even. If he was going to his death, he’d rather it be on his own terms, preferably with a crash over a deserted island where he could have truly lived out his pirate fantasies.
His phone pings a moment later, an encrypted email sitting unread at the top of his inbox. He loses himself to a timeline broken down by the minute (when it can be), to images of John, Rosie, and Mary looking like they belong in an advert for happy families, to images of just John and Rosie looking far happier than they ever did with the third member of their little troupe. There’s a bit of information on Mary, but most of it is vague at best and fucking terrifying at worst. The final attachment is a truncated medical report for W.S.S. Holmes. The majority of it has been redacted, but what he can gather has Greg nearly asking the driver to pull over so he can vomit in the middle of Marylebone.
The drive back to 221B is quiet but loaded. Greg doesn’t dare comment on the treasure trove they accumulated: a book, a jumper, a necklace, a photo. Sherlock seems lost in his own thoughts, staring out the window, breath fogging up the glass, so Greg leaves him to it.
It isn’t until she hears the pop of the car door with the wind biting at her cheeks, slapping her into focus again, that she realizes the person carrying her has a limp.
But the pain doesn’t lessen; it ebbs and flows with all the subtlety of a hurricane, throbbing in time with every thump of his rabbiting heart.
Sherlock never replied, though. His fingers ghosted over the key in the envelope hidden away in his pocket and he turned without another word.
Mycroft sighs. “Nightmare. Calming her down was apparently a task only her Detective could accomplish. Trust me, we tried.” He gestures to Mrs. Hudson who still looks a mess, so Greg goes over and bends down, placing a kiss on her cheek.
“Evidence,” Sherlock mutters as he elbows the door open - and then stops dead in the entrance so brusquely, Greg almost runs into his back.
Mycroft swallows and nods, but he can’t really refute that. He’s convinced that the only reason his brother lived as long as he did was because of John Watson. The army doctor is why Mycroft didn’t pop over one day to find Sherlock laid out on the floor mid-deduction with nothing to his name but a vitamin deficiency and a hoarder’s worth of cigarettes.
“Yes. So you knew all of this?” Mycroft began, steepling his fingers in a way that was so… Holmesian, John’s breath stuttered in his chest, “Yet you went
say anything), but he doesn’t nod either. He merely stares hard at his brother, because after everything they’ve been through, he must
He’s not sure he’s ready for the John Watson wing yet, though. He’s not sure he’ll ever be, but he can’t solve the case without it. He’s not sure he can solve his case without
He didn’t say anything for a while, too busy trying to tame his rage, too overwhelmed trying to calm his fear. Too busy trying to assure his heart.
“He’s not back by his own volition, if it makes you feel any better,” Mycroft offers and Greg scoffs.
“You don’t look like you climb over rooftops,” she says, nearly accusingly because Daddy never lies, but the so-called detective merely replies, “No, not for some time.” He wears a smile but she can see the hurt in his eyes and she feels bad. She saw him limp across the room. Maybe he did once climbs buildings.
But she’s six, maybe seven, depending on who you ask, when her father crashes through her door in the middle of the night. Her scream is swiftly silenced by his large, warm hand.
She rolls her eyes, but decides she likes him even more because he doesn’t know typical night-time routines. “The point of tucking someone in is that you’re supposed to
He watched her enter the world holding Mary’s knee instead of her hand. She was a screaming, red mess and quite possibly the most beautiful thing John had ever laid eyes on.
He lets the curtain fall back into place, listening to the car peel away from the kerb, and turns back towards the empty flat. Well, not entirely empty. He glances towards the stairs and listens again, but he’s met with silence. Sleep must have finally come for Rosamund Watson.
He leaves Sherlock rooting around in the kitchen and heads up the stairs, noticing the distinct lack of family pictures which he’s seen dotting so many suburban hallways. He pokes his head in the first door at the top - clearly Rosie’s bedroom - and glances around. It’s tidy, but her bed is unmade, hastily so. He’d read the file - he knew John had grabbed her in the middle of the night.
“Dear me, it must be an occasion. To what do I owe the honor?” she clips and he ignores the slight sting her admonishment brings. He loves her because she loves Sherlock and that’s enough reason as any.
Weaving around legs much longer than hers, she keeps her head down and her feet marching, all but barrelling through the front door that someone helpfully left open.
Mycroft hears the distant cry of a seagull the second before Sherlock says, “Eliminate anything not on the coast.”
It’s the way it should have been. The way it could have, had fate not had such a sick sense of humor.
It’s not far - she knows where she left it: on the side table in the living room. She and Daddy had read a chapter before watching a film (he does a great Miss Trunchbull). She’d ask Sherlock, but he’s already disappeared inside. His brother, too. Perhaps Anthea can help, but she doesn’t know her and she’s wary of strangers at the moment. At least strangers without the last name ‘Holmes.’
And there she is, the little girl beneath the veneer of typical Watsonian bravado. The six-year-old who probably misses her father more than she can adequately put into words. A child trying to be brave in a very grownup world.
She is quiet, but by no means a wilting flower. Surely the offspring of John Watson and Mary Morstan would be anything but. He looks forward to seeing the unstoppable force that is Sherlock Holmes meet the immovable object Rosamund Watson is shaping up to be.
John has a feeling he knows what it was, but the knowledge that he’ll never hear it said aloud in the voice he’d know at the end of the earth irreparably shatters his already broken heart.
Mycroft thinks of the version of his brother he left in the countryside and how far he’s come since then. Of how far he hasn’t still and how many wounds are yet to heal.
Mycroft’s always wondered why he didn’t take it to Sussex with him, though by his own admission and a doctor’s confirmation, his fingers are not as nimble. Mycroft suspects, though, that it had rather something more to do with the fact that he no longer had an audience.
She has a feeling she knows who Nana is talking about, but the thought makes her feel sick again and she suddenly wishes she hadn’t eaten so much.
“I was wondering when you’d get around to mentioning her,” he replies, grateful that his voice doesn’t shake with either anger or anguish. “Do you even care?”
Greg’s lips quirk in a half-smile and he shrugs. “Grew apart. Pub nights became more and more infrequent. John was needed more and more at home - ”
“Okay.” He can do that. He can do many things, like try to offer her comfort. He’s no one’s first choice for it, surely, but at the moment, it’s either him or Mycroft - and as Mycroft so cryptically said,
A quick glance around the hall tells him that the struggle didn’t extend beyond this area. The intruders, three of them, opened the door and moved immediately into the living room, waiting for John to descend the stairs before they began their assault.
Was Rosie merely an inconvenience? A further tether to the anchor of domesticity? John would like to think that the woman he conceived this child with loved her to some extent, but now - as he sits across from her and stares into her dead eyes - he’s honestly not sure.
“Don’t worry, dear,” she drawls, “ I’ve filled out more medical forms for you than I care to count.”
He heads into the living room and waits by the fireplace, catching his morbid reflection in the mirror and aiming a sigh at the skull. Frequently a better companion to his brother than he ever was.
“Long enough. Your biscuits are shit, by the way. Rosie hates them. C’mon, let’s get this over with.” He nods at the phone, and Mary’s face hardens, but she lifts it up and hits record all the same. “Sherlock. You dead bastard.”
“Oh thank God,” she breathes, and he must remind himself that, though Sherlock has been a hermit and he himself tied to his desk, John has lived a life. Has woven people in and out of the fabric of his days and his daughter’s until a tapestry had formed of family and connection and love.
“Guess John wasn’t getting a leg over,” he manages. At Sherlock’s confused frown, he points to the top of the box. “They expired two years ago.”
The mobile in his inside jacket pocket vibrates against his chest and he pulls it out to see a text from Lady Smallwood.
So he started to tell his daughter stories about a brilliant detective, and she listened wide-eyed and slack-jawed as he recounted their old adventures (heavily edited, of course). And when she was old enough, old enough to know there are some secrets you share with no one but each other, the brilliant detective got a name.
She really wants to stay awake because she knows they’re going to talk about her father, but it was a long night and an even longer morning and the leather seat really is very comfortable. She feels her head loll, not quite sure when her eyes closed, but the next time she wakes, the suffocating silence is back and she knows that all of the important words were said while she was sleeping.
“I’m bloody retired,” he all but growls, rolling his eyes as the man opens the back door for him but climbing in all the same.
Mycroft hits play again and watches the pain in John’s face. The determination in his eyes. The sarcastic hope in the curve of his mouth that the person he’s speaking to will actually hear what he has to say.
The ride to Baker Street is suffocatingly silent and steeped in memories he wishes he’d been better prepared for: the fish and chip shop where he and John spent many a late night (or early morning, depending on which of them you asked), the coffee shop that ground its beans
John’s throat went tight but he managed a nod and stood to leave. He had a part to play and it would take more emotional and physical preparation than a painted on moustache and bad French accent. Still, the memory made him smile.
“The two of you will have to eat eventually,” she says, handing it over. Then her breath hitches. “John would want him to eat.”
“I do. Very well, but…” he trails off and clears his throat, “it’s been a long time since I’ve seen him.”
“He was. In a way. He had Rosie and Christ knows he’d do anything for that child. But beyond that?” He inhales deeply and slowly blows it out. “No, he wasn’t very happy. But he became a far better actor than you ever gave him credit for.” He smiles ruefully, hoping to soften the blow, but Sherlock flinches as the words land all the same. “C’mon now. You’re doing him no good having a pity party out here.”
The following five minutes are a blur. Is it even five minutes? He honestly can’t tell. It feels like both a second and a century, saying goodbye to his daughter.
“It would be a location that Mary knows. One she’s been to before, a possible safehouse. She’d take him somewhere familiar.”
“I watched it well before John did. He handed the memory stick over to me and stayed at the hospital with you. He didn’t watch it for months.”
“Well,” Lestrade says, pushing himself to standing, “there’s no way I’m letting you go to the house of the woman who shot you on your own, so lead on.”
“That memory stick you keep bringing up,” Mycroft replies. “John is not the only one who’s seen it.” He doesn’t elaborate and the detective doesn’t ask him to. He probably assumes he’s referring to Sherlock, so Mycroft won’t let on that there’s a veritable army at MI5 whose sole job it is to track the moves and motives of one Sophia Moran.
There’s a moment of silence. It stretches. “I don’t know what John knew. I can gather what he assumed. I stopped giving him updates on Sherlock’s status five years ago.”
Mycroft listens to the heavy thud of his steps and waits until the front door closes before moving towards the window. On the street, Lestrade catches the keys Agent Mullens tosses at him, before looking up at the window and raising his fist. Mycroft nods, watching as his brother berates the Inspector for fraternizing with the enemy. His words are loud enough to seep the through the pane:
She must clock the confusion on his face because she smiles. “Oh, I’ll miss seeing that expression. It always was one of my favorites: dubious perplexity. John Watson, always a step behind.” She flicks the wedding band and it bounces off his knee before hitting the concrete with a tinny skitter. “Should be a view you’re used to.”
Mycroft was right earlier, when he said he’d been avoiding her. He sees John in her every feature and he finds himself both wanting to sway towards her and keep her at arm’s length, a futile effort at self-preservation.
She doesn’t hear much but she hears that, so she hops up and hurries back into the bedroom, throwing herself on the mattress and tugging the covers up to her chin, wiping her face clean with the sheet. There’s no way either of them will believe she’s been there the whole time - her exit was nowhere near James Bond-levels of stealth - but Daddy frequently says she’s lucky she’s adorable so maybe that will work in her favor this time.
Mycroft sighs, watching Sherlock set Rosamund back on the ground. “Nightmare. Calming her down was apparently a task only her Detective could accomplish. Trust me, we tried.” He gestures to Mrs. Hudson who looks like she needs a stiff drink and watches as Lestrade moves over to her, placing a kiss on her cheek and speaking to her in low tones.
John’s laugh carried across the lake and each beat of it poked a hole in Sherlock’s already fragile heart. Its cadence battered at his gates and the way John threw his head back, sunlight catching the strands of his silver hair, tore down his parapets. His wedding ring winked at him, coding out a message Sherlock knew only all too well.
John blinked, lips pursed, completely unable to move, feeling somehow overdressed in a t-shirt and pyjama trousers. He raised a hand stupidly in a small wave and smiled inanely.
"No, wait," Sherlock said, but nothing more immediately followed. "I'm still no good at this, am I?" he finally asked.
He was hurt, John had underestimated him. "I'm sorry, Sherlock, sorry, I- you've taken me by surprise, that's all," he said. "This really is good," he added, through another mouthful.
The line was quiet for a moment and John wondered if he might just hang up in disgust. He looked down at his suddenly unappetising lunch preparations and shook his head.
"Language John, please," Mrs Hudson admonished, but she seemed otherwise decidedly unalarmed to see them in this rather intimate embrace.
He took the tea from Sherlock and tried to avoid watching his friend over the rim as he sipped at it.
John laughed a little hysterically and grabbed Sherlock by the elbow, hustling him out of the front doors and locking them behind him while he went back to clear up his desk.
It took everything John had to tell him no. "I think we've just established that's not happening. Not right now," John amended.
"I don't know what I can give to you, physically. It's not something that I've ever considered for more than a fleeting moment, before very recently. But I'm drawn to you, John, I am."
Except it was only 5.30pm. He huffed as he went to make tea and checked his phone. John had replied with a convincing,
He very briefly considered leaving a kiss after his name, but he quickly decided that was inappropriate for both him and Sherlock. He stuck the note to Sherlock's bedroom door and called goodbye through the bathroom door on his way out.
John's breath caught. "I want that too." He leaned in, kissing Sherlock again, nipping a little at his lower lip. Before he could think about getting carried away he moved so that his head was level with Sherlock's bare chest, rested his head down and tucked his own hand under Sherlock's arm, curling his fingers around the curve of his shoulder.
John wanted to turn away, cover his warming face, but he didn't. He smiled a little at Sherlock's beautiful words and tried to breathe through his tightened chest.
John very carefully began unfastening Sherlock's buttons, very cautiously avoiding any direct skin contact and definitely avoiding eye contact, as he gingerly peeled back the fabric over a pale, freckled shoulder that sent John's heart into an immediate flutter. He forced his suddenly fogged up brain into doctor mode and set about some gentle prods and presses around where Sherlock said it hurt.
Sherlock nodded, a questioning look crossing his face but he called Angelo over without comment, and paid up while John was pulling on his jacket.
He reached out an arm and John slid into the offered hug gratefully. This bedtime cuddling was what put him most at ease. If they could do this, be this close and relaxed beside each other, then the rest should be easy?
"You look-" He breathed out heavily and climbed to the top step as Sherlock took a step backwards. "Bloody incredible," John finished.
He ducked quickly into the bathroom, taking extra care with brushing his teeth, and then, heart hammering, made his way tentatively to Sherlock's open door. He peaked in.
"What is it you're afraid of here? Letting your brother get hurt or letting him actually live a little?"
"I just mean," John said, placing a firm hand on that delicious chest, which certainly didn't help things in John's trousers, "I don't want you to think that I want to push you into anything further..."
Sherlock carried on despite his outburst. "You are drinking more, since we began to... have a physical relationship," he said slowly.
Harry nodded and John could see beyond the sad eyes to the little girl he had taught to jump from the garden wall into the compost heap, ridden bikes to the park with, helped up when she fell. Family. That was all John had ever dreamed about. Maybe they could get some of that back?
Sherlock was waiting when John got home. He stood quickly when John came in and could obviously see the recent distress. He stopped short of John's personal space and asked, "Will she do it?"
They said their farewells to Mike at the door, and John and Sherlock stood on the pavement as Mike went off for his train.
"It's a passable experience I suppose, I admit I enjoy the flavour of some of the drinks you've had me try. But as far as socialising goes, I can tolerate very few people for long enough to really make for pleasant company."
But Sherlock hadn't quite cleared up from his latest experiments and John had definitely seen some suspicious jars lined up on the counter earlier. He really, really wanted to believe they weren't there now while Sherlock was chopping carrots, or whatever he was doing.
"Oh, really," John said, advancing on him which made Sherlock's stomach flip dramatically and his palms begin to tingle. He could feel his heart reaching unprecedented levels already and they were merely standing in the hallway, talking about sex. At least, that's what he thought John had been describing to him last night as he kissed his neck and wrapped his palm around Sherlock's cock. At that point, things had become a little blurry.
"I couldn't even offer her tea, now could I," Sherlock told him. "So I took her downstairs for one."
On the off chance that he was right about the gifts, and because clearly Sherlock needed more clothes, John decided to get something for him. It really didn't matter whether the gifts were coming from Sherlock or not, John could still buy his friend something without issue, surely?
they were... So for another moment he kept quiet but it was impossible when he looked back into those kind, warm eyes. So close to him now...
John watched him closely. "I thought we'd agreed you would only wear those at home?" he whispered somehow managing to sound desperate and turned on at the same time. That was John though.
He grabbed Sherlock's arse with one hand, both of their cocks held in his other, and gritted his teeth as he pumped his hand. "Come on, come on," he whispered. "You feel so good, so fucking good in my arms Sherlock, can you feel it? I want to come with you, please," he gasped out.
John watched him closely. "Only if you want me to," he said, a little questioning tone in his voice.
When the door opened John jumped in surprise and Mrs Hudson jumped as well, hand clutching the front of her cardigan as she gasped and clung to the black bags in her other hand.
"Of course," John replied and he crossed to the entrance and pulled open the door while he waited for Sherlock. Sherlock marvelling at how gentlemanly John was, and always had been, nodded and went inside.
He ruffled his hands through his hair and sat down heavily on the edge of his bed. Why - why had he started that at all? A misplaced hand on a knee and now here he was even more frustrated than usual.
Before John could blink, Sherlock had pressed their joined hands to his own groin and John swallowed hard, not sure now why he hadn't supposed Sherlock's body would have the exact same reaction as his.
He finished showering, dried himself off and walked, naked, to his room. In the back of his wardrobe, on a high shelf, was a pair of dark blue jeans he had hardly worn because he was a creature of habit and had grown accustomed to his suits. He pulled them out now and threw them onto the bed, found some black pants from the drawer and tugged them on before finding his favourite purple shirt. They had both found clothes to be rather a distraction recently, but he felt that John might appreciate this small effort he was making for tonight. If John was planning a dinner date, it would be the first since they had begun to wank each other off at every opportunity and that made it a celebration of sorts, surely.
John watched his hands as he unfastened the purple shirt, revealing skin beneath that he had to kiss. He pressed in against Sherlock's body, humming against his throat as he felt Sherlock shiver under his palms. He had been hungry, ready for dinner, to take Sherlock out and spend some time together. But seeing him there, looking fucking stupendous in those jeans of all things, in the purple shirt that had never failed to make John squirm whenever Sherlock had worn it - John wasn't hungry anymore.
John was still sleepy, rubbing his eyes in the doorway to the kitchen and doing a double-take. He knew the jumper, it's just that it was usually him wearing it, and not Sherlock. Sherlock was taller than him, obviously, but still John wouldn't have considered how much longer his torso was, until he watched his friend stretch to a top cupboard and witnessed the pale line of bare skin that was revealed beneath the blue and black stripes of the top. John drew in a breath and held it as Sherlock turned to him and then John coughed and thought about going back to bed.
"I feel as if we do share something that I wasn't aware of before. Something I've not had before, which is why it's taken me so long to understand it."
John patted down his pyjamas, glad at least that he had bothered with a fresh t-shirt last night. Sherlock was still in his dressing gown anyway, so it really didn't matter. But all this domesticity... it was both pleasant and disconcerting.
Sherlock's arms around his waist always got John's heart racing, the feeling of comfort and warmth he had when they embraced was something he didn't ever want to let go of.
John sighed at himself, at his inability to be honest and clear about anything. "Wait," he suddenly said. "He gives you his washing? What- ahh why am I even surprised." He shook his head and crunched on his biscuit. Mrs Hudson waited. "I mean, with... talking though, generally. Or about his feelings?"
Lips. Lips on his - just a gentle press but it was enough, plenty to make the blood rush to John's head, focus completely on the connection. They came apart a moment later, bodies not close enough to hold the kiss without one of them moving. John's small gasp made Sherlock's eyes go wide.
John came closer, lowering his voice. "I mean, we've not talked about it, I don't know how you feel about it, I don't have a problem with anyone knowing, but it's your reputation-"
But he did allow a tiny spark to ignite, marvelling over the thought that Sherlock might actually, seriously, be considering this - considering them.
"Yes," Sherlock said simply. "Will you show me?" he said, repeating words from last night, and John knew even if they were both crazy, at least they were both sober, both on the same page - going into this together.
Sherlock frowned at him. "You have had more sex with yourself than you've had with any woman," he said, and John nearly fell off his chair.
Sherlock gently dropped the peas on to the coffee table and turned further towards John. John straightened up, clearing his throat.
Sherlock frowned and looked back to where they had left Mike at a little table near the stairs. "Maybe one more drink? I promise to attempt to be more... socially adept."
John frowned at the sharp tone, always immediately put on edge by Sherlock's brother. "What can I do for you, Mycroft?" he said, as he tucked the phone under his chin and carried on with making his lunch. He should have made his sandwiches last night but he was... distracted.
John looked at him, blinking away the remaining tears. His therapist had told him the same thing. If he could forgive himself he had a better chance of recovering from this. But what about Sherlock? And that's why he was here of course. To apologise. To seek forgiveness. To see if there was any hope for them.
"Um..." John covered his eyes for a moment. "A little bit, yes." He took a breath. "But you have lube and I have patient fingers," he murmured. "We'll be ok."
Sherlock looked across to him, his head resting on the cushion. "Yes, thank you John, it was very thoughtful of you."
"Oh, John! What are you doing standing out here? I thought you must be on an all-nighter?" She looked around and added, "Sherlock not with you, dear?"
John checked his watch. 21:50. "Ok, well, give it another twelve hours and we'll head out," he said, turning to leave the room.
Back at the flat Sherlock's coat was hanging on the peg where John had seen it earlier. The man himself was settled on the sofa reading when John opened the lounge door.
Sherlock frowned a little, emphasising the stitches on his eyebrow, the pain in his eyes too acute and John wanted to cry for him. He reached out, too far away to touch, not worthy to do it anyhow. He gave a choked laugh and scrubbed at his face.
"Only what? John, if you'd rather we went somewhere else, or I can get rid of the candle-" He went to blow it out but John covered the flame with his hand.
"Walk?" Sherlock suggested, and John looked up at the sky for some reason, cloud check maybe? He didn't even know.
Sherlock rounded the bed and pulled back the covers, watching John as he stood there. Finally he moved, well-aware of his lack of clothes when the air reached his damp parts as he closed the door.
He plonked John's shoes in front of him with his watch and wallet beside them. "Thanks," John murmured. "And, ah... sorry?" he added.
Seeing Sherlock here, seeing he was ok, getting better at least, it helped. A tiny amount, but it did help.
"Yeah, that's it," John gasped out, giving it his all now, desperate for them both, on the edge of something wild, needing this release so much he didn't know if he would come down from it. And if Sherlock came as well...
He raised a hand and snapped his fingers without breaking eye contact with John and called for Angelo.
Sherlock grabbed him by the shoulders and John all but fell on top of him, landing with their faces pressed close together.
John took a shaky breath, thanked him and walked heavily across to his chair. He could have done with one of Sherlock's crazy experiments to take his mind off things. He would settle for tea and just sitting with his friend for a while. Sherlock seemed to know just what he needed and it wasn't long before they were discussing a recent case and John could start to unwind.
John nodded expectantly but Sherlock didn't say anything, he just smiled. John looked down and Sherlock was reaching his hand across the seat, palm up, offering it to John.
John was frowning at him after this speech, and Sherlock felt sure something was amiss. But then John shook his head and seemed to shake himself out of a daze, before he responded. "No, Sherlock, of course not, everything's fine, this is great, a great idea. Only-"
Sherlock sat opposite him and held up a large serving spoon. "Ahhhhh," he said, rubbing his hands together, a wide and slightly manic smile on his face. "Are you hungry, John?"
They stayed that way for as long as it took for John's heart to calm. Eventually, he patted Sherlock on the back. "Whatever you want," he murmured again as he pulled back.
"Why? I don't want to burden you as well," John said, already regretting how far he had let Sherlock into this.
John cut him off. "Pretend this never happened?" he supplied. Sherlock frowned, but nodded which crushed John's heart a little more, even though they were his words.
"I'm not sure you can," Sherlock told him, and John really hoped things weren't about to become explicit. At least, not until everyone had left.
"Shall we get going?" John asked quietly, trying in vain to keep the desperate need that he had for more, out of his voice.
He didn't hold back, kissing Sherlock, holding him close while Sherlock leaned into him, the combination of Sherlock's warm body on his, the sheet gradually revealing more and more skin and the fact that Sherlock's tongue was in his mouth, it was more than anything John had actually imagined happening between them. It was hitting him hard, making his kisses more frantic, his hands grip Sherlock's hip harder and his moans grow louder. He felt Sherlock's hands in his hair, tentative, tugging lightly and he had to pull back, a difficult move since the chair was right behind him.
Sherlock smiled back. He looked relaxed and John had no idea how he was managing it. John wasn't expecting anything to happen here, he was too highly strung right now, he'd never manage it even if it was something that was on the cards. But he was nervous as hell.
They kissed again, John nudging his hips forward, desperate for more friction, unsure if this was ok, but Sherlock was hardening again too, John ran his hand down the length of Sherlock's body, taking hold of his own cock at the last moment, knuckles brushing against Sherlock's.
Sherlock stopped him with a kiss. Just the briefest of kisses capturing John's lips in his own. Then he stood back, expectant.
She nodded, a little flustered, a lot concerned, and went back to her door as John sighed and gave Sherlock a little shove to get them moving again. "I'm not really hungry, John." Sherlock told him.
"I'm just trying to understand you. That's a lot easier with some of this," he said, clinking the ice in his glass a little, before regretting his statement immediately. "I'm sorry," he added.
"John." No, it was the real man, calling upstairs. John got his breath back while Sherlock called his name again. "Have to go out - Charing Cross - new lead."
"I can't wait much longer," John huffed quietly as he bounced on the leather. "Baker Street, and hurry," he told the cabbie.
Finally, Sherlock looked back at him. "It didn't go exactly to plan, did it?" he admitted, opening the door to the taxi and holding it for John. "I apologise. It was my suggestion to go into that... fruit bar. I should have agreed when you wanted to flag that taxi down."
He pulled on his jeans, found a dark blue shirt to go with them this time and watched his reflection for a moment in the wardrobe mirror. His hair wasn't at its best but he gave it a good ruffle and brought out the curls which John told him he loved so much, and he was ready.
He always did wonder if Mary getting pregnant was a mistake or all part of the plan. It would tie her to John indefinitely, ensuring her cover, but that’s just it: it would tie her to John indefinitely. Assassins for hire aren’t known for putting down roots.
Mycroft watches as Lestrade slowly makes his way to the door, arriving in time for Sherlock to go collapsing into his arms. They’re both moving carefully, gently, like neither can believe the other is actually there. It is a hug between brothers, an overture Mycroft never could quite get himself to make.
But he can’t because the mobile feels ten stone in his hand, weighing down his palm as John’s bloodied, smug face stares back. How well suited they he and Sherlock were - are - to each other.
He leans against the door jamb to the kitchen and glances around. If he closes his eyes, it’s like the last five years haven’t happened. Like Molly is getting blottoed on the sofa with Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft is pretending to disdainfully work on his mobile, but he’s really chuffed at actually being invited.
But it’s not all of them. Not really. John Watson leaves quite a void; a gaping wound not even the finest doctors can heal. And he’s read Sherlock’s medical file, so he knows.
Sherlock pretends he’s the only one in the vehicle, trying to get his Mind Palace in order. It’s been so long since he’s had to use it for something more malicious than honey tampering at the local fair.
But it’s a seed. It’s a seed of a doubt that is already starting to grow, so Sherlock gathers his coat around him and turns on his heel, heading into a house just waiting for him to discover its memories, its stories. Its secrets.
“No!” the girl yells. “Is it Daddy?” If there were a way for someone to look both manic and mutinous, she achieves it - an impressive feat for someone so small.
“Oh well, my mistake,” he murmurs, hiding a smile as he digs the covers around her tiny body nice and tight. “Better?”
“There are threats we are assessing. Persons of interest we… have a close watch on,” Mycroft said nearly delicately. “It may be safer for you, for your child, where you are.”
She doesn’t want to get back into the car, but the car will take her to London and London is where Daddy is. At least she hopes that’s where she is. She’s seen enough James Bonds to know that bad guys can get places far away quickly.
“Yeah, I’m not as dumb as I look,” Lestrade replies, before pointedly looking at Mycroft. “I had my suspicions at the time, but the amount of shit redacted in Mary’s file sort of drove the point home.”
The years have not exactly been kind to Sherlock. Though, upon further inspection, perhaps they have. His hair is longer and his chin darker, but the purple half moons under his eyes have disappeared. There’s a lightness in his irises and an ease of the tension in his shoulders that Mycroft can’t deny wasn’t there before.
“Me, too.” Her tiny voice draws his attention to her once more and he listens, rapt, as she tells him what a good father John is. As if he’d had any doubt.
“Ah,” the Inspector says, whispering into Mrs. Hudson’s ear which has her murmuring something that might be “Poor dear” against the handkerchief that hasn’t left her palm all evening.
His limp is more pronounced but his spine is straight as he tosses his bag in the boot and slides into the back seat of the car, pulling his long-stored Belstaff around him like the armor it is. Rosie climbs in after him and Mycroft sits in the front beside the driver. Unfortunately, there’s no divider so Sherlock deals with this unbearable situation by staring petulantly out the window and watching his breath fog up the glass.
Daddy had had a small smile on his face by the time he finally wrangled her back downstairs, but it was sad. Very sad.
The road is quiet and the cars parked on it are non-descript. No doubt, countless government agents are watching his every movement at this very moment.
It had been a… trying afternoon for all involved, particularly his brother and Rosamund. They’re all feeling a bit raw.
He bypasses the roof and ‘leave a note’ and ‘you could.’ He’s replayed that conversation so many times in his head, he couldn’t delete it even if he wanted to. Finally, he gets to Mary Morstan and ‘not dead’ and ‘you let me grieve.’ His eyes are pricking but he pushes onward, forcing himself to witness the utter trainwreck that was their reunion. He examines abandoned train cars and skip codes and chip shops. He wants to skip wedding planning and all that that entails, but he can’t because it’s John’s wedding to Mary and she’s the reason he’s enduring this godforsaken exercise. He forces himself to remember the folds of the napkins and the taste of the wine and the discovery of one more deduction than he was expecting:
). The second comes much later - after he watches his brother pick through John Watson’s house, looking for clue after clue of his whereabouts, because where John Watson goes, Sherlock Holmes must surely follow. Watches him kneel by a pool of John Watson’s blood and stop just short of dipping his finger in. Watches him study the family pictures dotting the walls and end tables. Watches him observe the dishes in the sink (whiskey tumbler, a plate with biscuit crumbs). Watches him leave the bedroom until the last possible second, when he could no longer put off entering that veritable minefield of truth and consequence.
The footsteps on the stairs are slow. And uneven - Sherlock then. Maybe his limbs also feel like they weigh two stone each.
As it is, he has just enough time to clock the indentation of John’s head still on the pillow before a shout from downstairs draws his attention.
Lestrade’s jaw drops as Mycroft’s brows meet his hairline. “You’re going to give Ms. Morstan what she wants?”
When he next wakes, he’s lying down on a gurney, there’s a blood bag hooked up to his arm, and his not-wife is sitting beside him, fiddling with a mobile between steady hands.
She hesitates, because normally she’d say off, but she doesn’t want to be in the dark very much right now. At home, there’s a small light in the hallway that stays on so she can find her way to the toilet if need be, but this is a strange flat and these are strange people. Not as strange as they used to be, but still.
Whatever that meant. He shifts on the bed again and turns to her as much as he can, staring at her solemnly. “I want you to know that I’m going to do everything in my power to get your father back. I know I said it before, but I’ll say it as many times as you need to hear it.”
His thumb hovers over the video, but something halts his hand. There’s something inherently wrong about being the Holmes that hears John Watson’s words first.
“Right… um, I’ll just change,” he eventually mutters, glancing down at himself and realizing he’s still wearing pajamas and wellies, hardly city (or rescue) attire.
“I don’t doubt it.” He inhales deeply and holds his breath for a moment before slowly letting it out. “Listen, Rosamund - ”
She didn’t get long to pack and being so close yet so far from the things that remind her of her father feels like it’s pulling her apart. She wants to behave, because she’s good at that (relatively) but she is a Watson through and through and Watsons are brave (
Despite the restraints, his spine straightens, and he grunts through the pain as if facing a wanted serial killer instead of the woman who bore his child.
He heads for the stairs and disappears, leaving Mycroft and Sherlock alone. He studies his brother then, since his gaze is still studiously fixed on the phone in his hand, and catalogues the changes. As he’s done so often since he showed up outside a Sussex cottage and dragged him from the dark and into the light.
"She has you. Clearly,” he spits and Mycroft sighs again, but when he speaks, his tone is laced with annoyance.
The batteries of any bugs leftover would be long dead by now, but he passes a precious few moments looking for them for old time’s sake. He finds one behind the mirror and another behind one of John’s old medical textbooks that never made the move. He’s sure there’s one hiding in the Union Jack throw pillow, but Sherlock might never forgive him if he took a knife to it to check.
The lock screen has come up, and Sherlock runs a thumb over John’s face, much like Rosamund had done in the car what feels like years ago.
He steps onto the landing and pulls his mobile out of his pocket, hitting the only name in his list of Favourites and listening to it ring.
This. This was a mistake. She thought she could be big. She thought she could handle it just like Daddy would, but she can’t. She can’t, she can’t, and tears are starting to well and her breath is short and sharp, tunneling her vision and causing her ears to buzz.
She thinks of her father and that something sharp hits her in her chest again, causing her to gasp. The lady, Anthea, glances down at her in concern, but she turns away, blinking her eyes quickly and willing herself not to cry.
She finds her nose scrunching sympathetically as she watches him pace the length of the living room, pausing here and there, but not really seeing anything. He finally looks like a detective, like
“Hope you got the type right,” he mutters, because he’s a little shit and when he’s cornered, his filter is the first thing to go.
“What do you do with someone you don’t like?” he says slowly. Distractedly. “Someone who’s been naughty?”
He’s already had to deal with a John without a Sherlock - twice over, actually. Now he knows what it’s like to deal with a Sherlock without a John. Frankly, he’d prefer they remain a unified pair, thank you very much. For the rest of their days, if at all possible.
Sherlock places his hands on the counter so they don’t wrap around his brother’s neck. “I assume she likes toast and jam. She
- Sherlock is still alive, hurting John is the ironclad way to drag him out of the shadows. It is the only certain thing in life.” Death, taxes, and Sherlock Holmes’ drive when John Watson needs saving.
Yes, up until that point, life was pretty good. She liked school and enjoyed reading. She had a best friend named Naomi and her eye on a puppy at a local shelter that she met on a field trip. Negotiations to adopt him had stalled, but she hadn’t lost hope. She had a Nana that snuck her treats and a Dad she utterly adored and a Mum that was gone more than she was there, so she made do. She liked porridge for breakfast and turkey and cheese sandwiches for lunch. She liked Indian for dinner and pudding for dessert, which she only got when she’d been very, very good.
He presses the door open to find Mrs. Hudson seated at the little table in her kitchen. Remnants of Rosie’s supper remain stacked next to the sink, but the nearly full plate pushed off to the side proves Mrs. Hudson didn’t have much of an appetite.
"Christ, Sherlock," he breathes, taking a step forward and reaching for him - needing to press hand to heart, to feel the beat beneath his palm. What he tried to do and failed to find in the ambulance bay at Barts. What he wanted to do but didn’t dare when he was approached in a car park two years later. But this time -
Sherlock moves past him into the living room, picking up a copy of Matilda from a stack of books by the couch and sliding it into his pocket.
If Lestrade is surprised by that information, he doesn’t show it. He merely shoves his hands into his pockets and rocks back on his heels, and Mycroft wonders what it must be like to have a friend resurrected twice over.
His throat has gone tight, and he daren’t try to say a word because he knows his voice will break and Mycroft, the insufferable git, is
She scrolls to H and her finger hovers over ‘Mycroft Holmes’ but before she can press the name she was forced to memorize almost as soon as she learned her letters, the phone slips from her grasp as a gloved hand clamps down over mouth, muffling her scream.
She distinctly doesn’t pout because only babies do that, though Daddy catches her at it occasionally. Instead, she merely frowns and stares out of the window, playing with the chain around her neck her father gave her for her last birthday.
He pats Billy the Skull on the head before pressing his fingertips to his temples and blowing the dust off the door behind which his old life now lives. It’s been ages since he’s thrown it open. There have been the occasional peeks to remember a recipe or a fact about gardening or beekeeping, but he’s never gone for a walk, like he’s about to. He’s never actively sought those halls out.
Two years had passed since he missed the only opportunity he had to be true to himself for the first time in his life. Since he put Sherlock Holmes on a plane and pretended he’d be back in no time at all, popping up at Rosie’s daycare or something equally ludicrous.
Lestrade clears his throat, digging around in his pocket and pulling out something small enough to fit in his palm. A chain dangles from his fingers, a red flower catching the light from the corner.
He manages to make it to his chair before he collapses like a marionette whose strings have been cut, breath uneven as he presses trembling palms to wet cheeks.
Sherlock turns so Rosamund faces away and meets Mycroft’s gaze for a brief moment before flicking it down to the mobile. Mycroft can see the struggle in every line of his body - rescue John or tend to his daughter. He knows which answer John would prefer, never one for self-preservation.
He doesn’t know why, but he remembers the tarmac. Remembers the breeze on his face and the pain in his heart. He remembers Sherlock’s words, clipped and official but laced with something else. A melancholy neither of them could truly voice.
Sherlock stares, but doesn’t see, heart hammering in a rhythm he hasn’t been forced to keep time with in far too long.
Their reunion proves to be… tedious, but welcome. He’s more interested in his brother’s reaction to the child trailing in his wake than he is anything else, and Sherlock doesn’t disappoint. His eyes are drawn to her like a bee to honey, sussing out her temperament, cataloguing her features, inevitably wondering how their lives fit together now that their worlds have finally collided.
He turns slowly, haltingly, and offers a small smile as Rosie climbs back onto the sofa, huddling in next to Mrs. Hudson, fitting perfectly in the crook of her arm. It’s been ages since Greg’s seen her. She’s gotten so big, John shining through her every feature.
“He’s at the park. St. James’s. You’ll find him by the lake. They’ll be feeding the pelicans around this time.”
Rosamund’s eyes droop, given the emotional toll of the day and the lateness of the hour. Frankly, Mycroft’s impressed that the child is still conscious at all. Mrs. Hudson settles in next to her, beginning to quietly read again as Lestrade wanders over to where Mycroft stands at the window. Their eyes meet in the reflection of the glass, an uneasy look passing between them.
so, the Boots where John would routinely stock up on first aid items that he couldn’t pilfer from the surgery for the kit beneath the sink, Angelo’s -
Sherlock walks over to the bed, staring at the indention on the pillow, his hand hovering over where a head once rested before being abruptly and brutally shoved in his pocket. “Of John.”
“What now?” Sherlock barks in greeting, and Mycroft closes his eyes and wills himself to have patience.
Much to his surprise, the ride to John’s is actually still muscle memory. Greg made the trip enough in the lead up to Rosie’s birth and the aftermath of Sherlock’s departure. He even spent the night on the couch once, when he and John left the beers behind and broke into the scotch.
But until then, it’s blanket forts, biscuits, Indian takeaway, and a movie she’s probably too young to see.
He didn’t voice his question, but he couldn’t deny that he had no desire to see Mary Watson that day. Or any day, for that matter.
The door was not damaged so the intruders had a very good lock-picking tool (or a key. Sherlock hasn’t ruled that out yet). But a turned over flower pot outside accounts for the initial bangs Mycroft said Rosamund heard when John was still with her.
The hall light catches on the silver chain around her neck, the one she’s been playing with and tugging at all day. He leans over and oh-so-gently extracts it from beneath her pajamas, inhaling sharply when John’s dog tags follow.
He rocks back on his heels, unsure in the face of so much sentiment. “Well. If you wouldn’t mind keeping an eye out for Detective Inspector Lestrade, I would be most appreciative. He should be here momentarily.”
“Christ, Sherlock,” the DI replies, reaching for him as if to ascertain he’s real, and Sherlock is moving forward before he can recall doing so, all but collapsing into the arms of the man who, instead of kicking a kid high off his tits from his crime scene, took him to a hole in the wall and got him a cup of coffee and a hot meal.
His senses are a little sluggish, gaze taking a delayed second to catch up with the movement of his head. He tries to focus but wherever he is is dark, save for the fluorescent fixture hanging above, casting a small circle of light of which he is the epicenter. His bare toes are still cold on the concrete floor, and he’s lost feeling entirely in his hands. Probably for the best.
. She fell off the monkey bars last year and broke her arm. Her father pulled out the old book from when he was in school and showed her exactly which bones she had broken. She was fascinated.
He turns to his brother who’s carefully watching the scene on the sofa with a kind of calculated wonder - like seeing a beautiful creature and knowing it can tear you to pieces the minute you turn your back.
He tries to draw in breath while it feels like he’s taking a knife to the side. It’s fine, he doesn’t have a spleen to puncture anyway.
Lestrade returns from the kitchen and hands Mrs. Hudson a sherry, a libation that Mycroft envies, and the pluck of a string from the corner proves that Sherlock has found his violin.
Lestrade lets out a heavy sigh, weary with the task at hand. Or perhaps just exasperated by them both. “Yeah.”
And then her breath catches in her chest, hitching for an unbearable moment, before a wail that’s probably been bottled up for the past 24 hours tears out of her throat.
“Precisely. Well done, Watson. You torture them with ten square inches filled with glass and nails, poking and prodding every time you bump into it.” His gaze falls on the photo still lying on the desk. “Or look at it.” He reaches out and picks it up, running his finger along the glass, just as he had done to the mobile. “He had it on the wall next to the bed, which would have annoyed her. She hated me.” He weighs the frame in his hands, passing it back and forth between his right and his left. “Oh she was quite the actress, make no mistake. In the beginning, anyway. But she made one glaring error. It’s fine, they all do.”
When Mycroft looks over his shoulder, his brother is clad in his Belstaff and any traces of vulnerability from the last few minutes are gone from his face. “We made it eight hours together without you and she the six years before that.” The tone is lazy but the words are sharp. “I think we’ll survive.”
he had said to him that day in hospital so long ago. And John did. But when he tried to right his wife’s wrongs, when he stormed into Mycroft’s office and asked what the plan was, Mycroft let him down.
“Here. I think I have something that belongs to you,” he says to Rosamund, pulling a plush toy from his pocket.
Then Sherlock made a joke and John knew he was deflecting, but he let him get away with it anyway. Because he was a fucking coward. And it certainly wasn’t the first time:
throughout the whole ordeal that Mycroft had gotten complacent. He had forgotten, for a moment. So fate saw fit to remind him that she is just a child, a six-year-old who’s lost the only constant in her life; the only thing that truly matters.
Rosie wiggles enough that Sherlock puts her down on shaky legs on the pavement. She’s up the steps and vaguely remembering to be gentle as she barrels into Nana’s waiting arms, burying her face in her neck and inhaling her familiar perfume.
Upon further introspection, though, he thinks that perhaps ‘soft’ is what his baby brother has been all along.
Sherlock sighs and very nearly stomps off. Probably would have had his leg allowed him and he had been more prepared to make an exit. But Mycroft surprised him - foisted himself on Sherlock like an unwanted boil and now Sherlock has to improvise.
He barely recalls sprinting up the final few steps and shoulder-checking the door hard enough that it bangs against the wall. He’s fortified for crying; he knows how to navigate a strop. He grew up with Sherlock Holmes, after all. But years of watching his egoist baby brother throw a wobbly do nothing to help him against the sight and sound of raw, emotional devastation coming from the daughter of the man his brother loves.
She knows her Daddy is brave so she doesn’t reply. She’s not sure she could even if she wanted to. Her throat is still working very hard to not make a sound.
Sherlock started to bring in trays and platefuls of things - scrambled eggs, toast, halved grapefruits, pancakes - "Sherlock, this is amazing, what made you think of all this?"
I've been completely obsessed over a new fandom these last couple of weeks, and then my laptop died. I've also been reading an interesting mixture of things. Then yesterday I was watching the beautiful Peter Pan from 2003 and I fell in love with yet more characters, and suddenly there was inspiration to write! So here it is :)
"Sorry," he mumbled, dropping his hand. He immediately swayed and this time Sherlock grabbed a hold of his arm and linked them together as they stumbled on.
"Oh, for fuck's sake," John murmured, completely taken in by the adorable nature of his man-child of a friend. "We need to stop doing this."
John mirrored him and they lay there, smiling, blinking, breathing. After a moment Sherlock reached out of their cocoon, stretching to turn off the side lamp and John admired the flash of arm and shoulder before waiting for his eyes to adjust.
John hastily rolled off the condom and opened his palm, easing his own cock in alongside Sherlock's. "I can't, sorry - needed to -" and that was it.
"Yes, great," John said, looking around them. The bar was spacious and they took stools by the window.
Sherlock finally put the broken kettle back on the counter and huffed off while John got out a pot. He made sub-standard tea and took it into the living room. He couldn't complain about Sherlock's renewed obsession with his tea. It wasn't drugs and that was all that mattered to John.
"Talk," Sherlock repeated. "Yes." He gave John a sidelong look. "Never really been very good at that."
But Sherlock was only wearing black trousers, along with John's jumper. The man had no socks on - this was killing him. "You, er, ran out of clothes?"
Sherlock met his eyes again and then his lips, plunging his tongue between John's lips and John cried out, breaking the kiss as he came in his pants. "Oh fuck... fuck... yeah..." he gasped out, holding Sherlock close with his other hand as the convulsions continued.
John frowned harder and sat down beside him. "Is it..." God, he was being presumptive. "Is it me?" he asked quietly.
"You need a hand?" John managed, but all he heard in return was descending footsteps and the dull thud of the heavy front door two floors below him.
He looked up at Mrs Hudson and she gave him a knowing look. "Just be patient with him. It does sound like he's trying to process what you told him. In his own way."
He laid his hand on top of John's, fingers slipping around each other and a thought occurred to John. "Have you ever... you know,
"John," Sherlock murmured, and he clutched a little tighter, as John moved his lips to Sherlock's cheek, placing kisses wherever he could on the beautiful pale length of Sherlock's neck. He ran his hand through dampened curls, darkened by the water, and Sherlock put his head back under the spray, eyes closed, exposing more skin to John's gaze, to his lips. He hummed as he pressed his lips to the freckle beside Sherlock's Adam's apple, felt Sherlock shiver and held him closer.
He slid off the seat and onto his knees on the floor at Sherlock's feet. They had sat here so many times together, talking, discussing case after case, silent knowing (or sometimes certainly unknowing) glances over a client, drinking, talking, just being together. But now-
"I'll take this side," Sherlock conceded, as he sat down on the edge of the bed. "Will you join me?" he added softly.
They rejoined Mike and spent the next several minutes trying to define which current news stories Sherlock believed and which he thought were fictional. When they moved on to comparing stories about John, he tried to appreciate them for what they were and not turn into the grumpy arse he had been previously.
He wasn't cross, not exactly, he just wanted for once to be on the same page as Sherlock, to see inside his head and not suppose that they were on different plains of reality all the time. He pushed away the memory of the shadowy form of Sherlock outside The Viaduct. Whether or not it was him, John had no reason to worry about it, he just had to keep pushing through each day.
"No." John cut him off quickly. "Please, don't do that. I know what I have, Sherlock, I know who I am now." He squeezed his hand into Sherlock's shoulder. "It took me this long to get here, I want to stay, if you don't mind. And the only family I need is right here."
John closed his eyes and shook his head. He couldn't find any sensible words and he felt like a complete prick. He was an idiot. "I'm an idiot. I'm sorry." He held out his hands, palms flat as he apologised. "You don't need to answer to me, or anyone. I was worried, and I'm sorry," he finished, sitting heavily back on the stair.
"Oh, no, not at all, Sherlock. This is not your problem - I like a drink, I always have. I can't end up like last night again - I'm a bloody doctor," he shook his head, furious with himself. "But I don't blame
"I had a shit night," John told him, leaning forwards, elbows on his knees. "We could start with that."
Sherlock yawned dramatically from his place on the sofa, when the film they'd been watching came to an end. "It's cold," he said.
"Ah, just an argument with someone bigger than me," Sherlock told him vaguely, flinching as John started removing his coat and jacket.
Sherlock answered by sweeping his hand down John's torso and over his now flaccid cock. John flinched and Sherlock's hand stopped moving, raising both eyebrows as he waited.
John pressed him gently back against the tiled wall, careful that their feet stayed on the non-slip surface of the bath, and kissed him again, moving his hips in, pressing their groins together and grasping Sherlock's erection along with his own. He didn't falter, but he did wonder how he was still functioning when he was touching Sherlock's actual cock.
John considered for a moment. "I haven't slept like that before. I've never wanted to be wrapped up in someone. It was good," John told him.
Another date, but can they sit through a 'proper' date now that sex is on the menu? (Not literally, it's just Angelo's.)
"So, tube or taxi?" John asked, as they both shuffled their feet. He was feeling tipsy, not unpleasantly, just nicely drunk. Sherlock was looking a little flushed in the low light coming from the pub and from the overhead lights.
He really wanted to hold Sherlock's hand across the table. Instead he reached for his glass. Empty. Of course. John cleared his throat, Sherlock was watching him. "So," John started, genuinely at a loss now and feeling unsettled about that. Sherlock waited patiently for him to go on. "Greg," he blurted. "Haven't seen him lately, has he run out of work?"
Sherlock sat back, and after a moment John looked up and realised his friend was doing just that. He had swapped the card for his glass and was watching John as he took a sip.
"Hi," John began, and then he stopped talking, got that strange look about him as he often did mid-sentence these days, and stood looking Sherlock up and down as if he was a glass of whisky after a long day at work. "Oh, God, Sherlock," he added, just when Sherlock had started to feel that something might be wrong.
"I didn't argue, I was merely pointing out the flaws in his logic," Sherlock told him, finishing on a hiccup.
Sherlock started talking first, probably attempting to cut Mrs Hudson off before she could really get going. She was the happiest John thought he had ever seen her as she continued to chatter about how pleased she was for them, Sherlock and John both agreeing and insisting at every possible moment that they hadn't been hiding anything from her, this was all still new and they didn't mean to let her find them together on the sofa of all places.
But Sherlock had other ideas anyway and John was completely happy with those ideas when Sherlock grabbed him and pulled him back in for a kiss that John had certainly not expected.
He stood and smoothed down his shirt, cleared his throat and mumbled, "I'll... uh... I'm gonna have an early night." Why was he even saying that? They didn't normally feel the need to give each other the rundown on bed times.
"What do you mean, you have a date?" Lestrade had the tone and expression of complete disbelief, and Sherlock just smiled.
John wanted to reach across and yank him over their breakfast things so he could show him just what friends could do if they both wanted it.
lured his victims onto dinner dates." He raised his eyebrows to see if Sherlock had actually done this deliberately, was attempting to get rid of him by practicing the same techniques, or if he really had thought nothing of it.
Sherlock leaned his back against the closed door and John felt suddenly vulnerable in the middle of the room, as if he was about to become prey. He didn't mind that for a second.
They stepped out together and bumped hands reaching for a towel. John loved it that they were doing these completely mundane things and that they were doing them together. He dried himself more slowly than he would normally, glancing to Sherlock now and again as he did the same. John had a permanent smile on his face, he knew he did.
"Oh yeah, so I am," John said, grasping Sherlock's shoulder for support. "Sherlock, you're going to kill me."
"Yeah?" John said looking over his shoulder, wondering whether he should hang up his towel in here or take it upstairs to get dressed first. How much parading around naked was appropriate at this point?
"Um, Tuesday, I think," John said, after pulling the toast away from his mouth, still feeling far from awake, hoping a brisk stroll would help things. When he looked up at the vision at the top of the stairs though, he knew there was no hope of ever shaking the reality of how he felt for Sherlock. It was the sheet. Why did he have such an aversion to clothes? John blinked, turned his back before he could imagine anything more inappropriate at 7am, and called a resigned, "See you later," before opening the door and making his way to work.
Greg isn’t a member of the force anymore, but he does consider himself a satellite member of this rather broken family. The fact that he’s only just now being told nearly 24 hours after the fact is a bitter pill to swallow.
He eventually appears in the doorway looking unsure and nervous for the first time since they met. They eye each other for a moment before Rosie slowly scoots over and flicks her gaze to the space next to her on the bed. Sherlock takes it for the invitation it is and slowly sits down next to her.
“Oh well, my mistake,” he says, even as he digs the covers around her body nice and tight, just how she likes it. “Better?”
"Do you really think I'm the Holmes John Watson wants his daughter with? Perhaps I should procure a copy of her birth certificate to be sure.”
Lestrade pulls out his phone to do just that as Mycroft hits play on the video again, watching his brother instead of the man his brother loves. Sherlock nearly sags when John starts speaking again, and Mycroft wonders if Sherlock truly thought he’d never hear that voice again.
“You fucking idiot,” he hears someone say before he tilts sideways and his face mashes into the carpet he hoovered not the day before.
Sherlock shakes his head, before frowning and opening John’s bedside drawer again, rooting through bits and bobs before pulling out a small black frame. He must have been so flummoxed by the condoms, he completely missed the rest. He flips the frame and Greg huffs out a breath as a photo of John and Sherlock stares back at him. In fact, it’s a photo he took. The final case they all worked on together, before John got married and Sherlock left on an MI6-sanctioned holiday, when they were all so delirious, running on nothing but PG Tips, maltesers, and crap coffee. John had been laughing so hard, his forehead was pressed to Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock - well, Greg had never seen him so carefree: giggling, leaning against a wall to support John’s weight as his head tilted towards the ceiling. Greg can’t even remember what they all found so funny.
Greg grunts under the impact, but his arms come around him all the same. “Alright,” he says, voice hitching and fingers digging into his back, over scars Sherlock can no longer feel.
“Come on, then,” Mrs. Hudson says when she stands, showing remarkable fortitude when she meets his eyes for the first time. No doubt she’d prefer to clap him about the ears, but instead she starts talking about tea, which is so comforting, he could sit down right here on the stoop. “Well go ahead,” she urges and that’s when her false bravado falters; when she reaches up and runs her hand through his hair, so like his mother used to, and cups her cheek in a palm that’s frail, but strong.
His eyebrows fly up before he can help it and he shares an equally incredulous glance with his brother. “The very same,” he says carefully. What did John tell her?
They eventually make their way down the dirt lane, greenery coddling them on either side. He’d seen satellite photos of his brother’s home, but somehow, he expected it to be… more.
Sometimes he feels like his life is one long series of wasted opportunities. He could have the proof of it drawn up in triplicate.
at home. But right now, in this moment, as she stands in the doorway of the safest place on earth, she doesn’t account for the bullet holes in the walls or the puddle of dried blood staining the cream-colored carpet brown.
She pats his cheek, like she did to Sherlock when she first clapped eyes on him, and Mycroft startles enough that he sucks in a breath. He’s not sure he realized how touch-starved he was until this moment.
So much so that he blew into Mycroft’s office the next day with neither announcement nor appointment, but no one stopped him, not even Anthea.
“Brother mine, we have a situation.” He remains silent, letting Miss Watson’s cries through the open door do the talking for him, but there’s a pressing sentiment he must express. One he needs to make absolutely clear: “She’s asking for you.”
“Here,” he murmurs, pressing the tips of his fingers to the center of his chest. “I’d feel it here.”
Lestrade honestly looks like he’d love nothing more than to wrap his hands around Mycroft’s neck, and to be frank, Mycroft wouldn’t blame him. But before he can offer whatever passes for a meager modicum of comfort (because he feels a strange pull to he can’t quite explain), a noise he hasn’t heard in far too long comes from the stairwell - a sob that can’t be smothered.
She’s safe. She’ll be safe. She’ll call Mycroft and he’ll come get her and then, hopefully, they’ll find him.
But he had been. He’d made it a year. Through sheer force of will, he survived six months longer than his brother had anticipated. A decent amount of spite might have also fueled his endeavors, but he chalked it up to will power and deductive reasoning on paper.
him, at the very least. He itches to know what John’s said and whether he occupies a place of importance in her life the way John does in his.
She can hear him swallow where her head is tucked into his neck. It sounds like a gulp. “Yeah, sweetheart, I think she is.”
Sherlock sinks back into the cushions, leg already bouncing, fingers drumming a beat against his kneecap. “I need to go back to the house. I didn’t get enough time there. Before...”
“Mary never would have given John the only copy, though,” Sherlock argues, but Mycroft makes a noise of disagreement.
She eyes him somewhat warily through swollen lids, this stranger who’s entered their safe space, but then he watches something click in that gaze that’s seen far too much in her short years.
“I do not know.” Greg can tell the words are practically clawing their way out of Mycroft’s throat. “He’s been abducted.”
Somehow his hand finds his gun and he fires off a round into someone’s knee, but it’s the bullet he takes to the abdomen in return that really tilts the scales. And not in his favor.
“Wait - Didn’t you two look at it together?” Lestrade frowns and looks at Mycroft for confirmation. As if Mycroft has ever had any control over what Sherlock Holmes and John Watson do.
She swallows, but her throat has gone tight again. “I know you will,” she whispers, biting her lower lip to keep it from wobbling. “That’s what you do.”
she had exclaimed and a part of John died at knowing his daughter was forced to learn Mycroft’s name before Sherlock’s. Her middle names remained a mystery.
Rosamund scrambles for it, but Mycroft is faster, snatching up the device and swiping open the message conveniently sent from Mary’s phone. He can tell from the video’s thumbnail alone that he’s not going to like whatever comes when he hits ‘play.’
It doesn’t matter that he’s a man on the far side of 40. For the first time in far too long, he lets himself be held.
Mycroft stares at the quiet street, making visual confirmation with the few agents he can actually see. He knows there are far more scattered about. “Sherlock shouldn’t be seen.”
“Shouldn’t we wait for him?” Lestrade asks, nodding at the mobile and then back towards the stairs, and Mycroft pauses, acknowledging the risk of Sherlock’s wrath and weighing it against his need to save his John Watson.
“She did murder him, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said, rattling it off as if it were the morning weather report. “He died on the table.”
“And we will,” Lestrade says, looking at Mycroft for backup. “As soon as we know what we want to say.”
Now, he calls Sussex home, with the buzz of the bees in the yard and the sea salt in the air making his curls do all manner of impossible things. He has a schedule these days. He wakes around eight in the morning, makes tea, and putters with the newspaper. He does his PT stretches in the living room whose windows overlook the hives. He has more tea and then dons his beekeeping suit, ready to check on the kingdom he shares with a Queen he’s named Lola.
Sherlock stomps upstairs to pack, as Mycroft knew he would, so he leaves Rosamund to her toast while he steps outside to make a call, inspecting every surface as he goes. What he finds surprises him. There are wildflowers in a mason jar on the windowsill, carefully fluffed throw pillows on the sofa, and, for god’s sake,
He had hoped that the woman known as ‘Nana’ to Rosamund would be a comfort, but the child only cries harder, working herself into a right state. He’s sent prisoners to padded rooms for less.
“They’ll know we’re at 221B, though. Can’t hide that wallpaper,” Lestrade says with a huff of laughter that brings the hint of a smile to Mycroft’s face.
that won’t, even under these circumstances, ever leave his lips. The fact that Sherlock is willingly leaving John’s fate in Mycroft’s hands is quite possibly the most difficult sacrifice he’s ever had to make. And he’s faced down death on more than one occasion. It’s also the most stunning act of trust Mycroft has ever witnessed from his brother.
They pull to a stop and Sherlock gets out. Mr. Holmes follows and they exchange some words over the car but they’re muffled by the closed doors. She watches through the window as Sherlock makes his way to the flat, but Mr. Holmes remains near the car. She scoots across the seat and hooks her fingers around the metal handle, still warm from Sherlock’s touch, and pulls. For the amount of people mulling around her yard alone, they’re remarkably quiet, and she shivers in the cool breeze that finds its way under her jumper.
If Greg closes his eyes, he can almost imagine John in his chair, Rosie curled up on his lap, as Sherlock plays silhouetted by the window, as he’s doing now. He’d look at him as if he’d hung the moon, because that’s just how John Watson looks at Sherlock Holmes.
Mycroft hands him the mobile. “In your own time then,” he says softly, watching Sherlock’s trembling fingers take it.
“Detective Inspector,” she murmurs, stepping aside and gesturing to the warm glow emanating from the hallway. He wants to wrap himself in it.
Ah. He had wanted to leave that particular portion of the conversation until they could speak in person. After all, how does one tell a woman that she’s getting one son back only to lose another?
He sighs and watches a bead of condensation drip down the bottle of his beer, already pinching the bridge of his nose. “Perhaps you’ve forgotten, Mr. Holmes. I’m retired.”
“Likewise.” He wonders if any of the information he put down was right and promptly decides it doesn’t matter. Not anymore. “What’s that for?” he asks instead, nodding at the phone.
And it was true, she did go yesterday, but perhaps the shops weren’t the only place she went. John could vouch that she had left the flat. And if she ever hunted through his phone, which he had no doubt she did, he hoped she would merely think Mycroft was being overly doting. He did, after all, send them a teddy bear the side of a mini-fridge on the day Rosie was born.
She cups his cheek, more weathered than when she last saw him, before nodding towards the stairs. “They’re up there.”
But Rosamund simply grabs hold, hooking her little arms around his neck and wrapping her legs around his torso, confident that he will take her weight and carry her to whatever her intended destination. He doesn’t care about the tears or mucous she’s getting on his waistcoat or the fact that her continued cries are loud and piercing in his ear. He cares that she feels comfortable enough to do this, to cling to him, because no one has bothered to put that kind of blind faith in him since Sherlock was her size and holding onto him just as tightly.
Everyone is being unusually quiet and she realizes it’s because they don’t want to talk in front of her. She can tell when adults need to have adult conversations. Perhaps she can pretend to sleep, but exhaustion is catching up with her. Her eyelids feel heavy and the leather of the seat is nice and Sherlock’s shampoo smells good. Sure enough, Sherlock snaps a minute later, making her jump.
When Rosie was one, he took up boxing. He knew it was the only way he’d be able to get in bed next to his wife and not throttle her in the middle of the night. He performed his husbandly duties but barely, claiming any excuse he could find using his not insignificant medical knowledge. And when he did, he was militant about birth control. Not that he wouldn’t love another child, but another child was another chain to Mary and it was enough trouble trying to untether himself as it was.
She knows they’re trying to protect her by shielding her, and considering what happened last time she was here, it makes sense. But that’s the thing about being tiny.
Whatever he saw in that video seems to have given him newfound resolve and, oh if it isn’t a beautiful thing to behold.
“Doing what?” He can’t imagine Sherlock in the country, wearing cardigans, pruning gardens, and solving stolen bicycle cases. Then again, he couldn’t imagine him in a dungeon either, but he knows that’s what happened in Serbia. He remembers every word John told him drunkenly and devastatingly one evening while Chelsea thrashed Tottenham.
“Daddy talks about you a lot,” she murmurs. “He’s been teaching me football and he said your team is crap.”
The footsteps come closer and she forces tension into her muscles solely so she stops trembling. She clasps a hand over mouth and holds her father’s mobile in her sweaty palm like the lifeline it is.
Sure enough, they hear the pitter patter of little feet hurrying back into the bedroom and Sherlock can’t help but smile briefly before swallowing thickly. The look of worry on his face is uncharacteristic, but then again, many things are about this older version of his brother.
It’s a bit morbid given the circumstances, but that’s the sphere in which they operate. The shadows where they conduct the day’s business.
“Go ahead,” she murmurs and Rosie reaches out, clutching it to her chest, automatically rubbing the worn, floppy ear between her thumb and forefinger - a long-practised habit. Sherlock then places the copy of Matilda on the coffee table, and Rosie’s face lights up so much, you’d think Father Christmas himself came.
He cocks his gun and creeps down the stairs, throwing himself backwards when he gets to the bottom and a fist nearly catches his nose.
“And now John Watson might be dead!” The words are out before he can call them back and the potential truth in them hangs heavily in the middle of the home they once shared. His breath is ragged and his eyes blur, but dammit, he will not cry. Not now.
She thinks she may pass out, which she’s never done before and it’s all a bit scary, but then arms circle around her and lift her deftly, turning her away from the puddle of blood and pressing her wet face (when did she start crying?) into a strong shoulder.
“So, if he didn’t,” Lestrade says, thoroughly ignoring Mycroft who tries not to puff up in indignation, “then where is it?”
She nods and he stands to leave, but a tiny hand shoots out and grabs hold of his wrist. “Daddy, usually tucks me in.”
His inhalation is sharp, but his voice firm when he clips, “I’m on my way” in return. The line goes dead and Mycroft sighs, gathering himself as he steps once more into the breach.
The car lurches forward, and his face is mashed against the metal floor, the angle of his bound hands torquing his bad shoulder, sending fire through his already immolating body.
He’s up and pulling on his shoes, beer bottle still in hand, mobile held between shoulder and ear before he even realizes he should probably put proper trousers on first. Cursing again, he drops the bottle on the counter and toes off his shoes.
He watches himself get shot and fall backwards in a careful arc that has neither grace nor glory. He wishes he could see John discover him - to know what went through his mind - but the rest of the data is corrupted. He shivers at ‘you don’t tell John’ and he reaches for John’s jumper as medics try to restart his heart and he hates Christmas for the overblown sentimentality it tries to force-feed the masses and not at all for anything else.
“What if she doesn’t like me?” he asks, finally voicing the uncertainty that’s been plaguing him since he saw her in the back seat of his brother’s nondescript sedan.
“Yes,” Mycroft succinctly replies, and he probably does, the git. Goddamn CCTV cameras everywhere. “Detective Inspector - ”
“Shit,” he mutters, hurrying down the stairs as fast as he can, hand clumsy on the railing, but sure enough to keep him upright.
Is this it? The definitive word he’s been waiting for for what seems like decades, telling him once and for all that Sherlock Holmes is dead?
“Hm, what?” He comes back to himself to realize the car is stopped and Mycroft is looking at him like he’s (god forbid)
He can feel the weight of Sherlock’s gaze on his face; can feel the loaded silence in every second he does not draw breath.
They stand there long enough for his bad back to ache, until Sherlock’s sobs subside and the collar of Greg’s shirt is soaked through. He maneuvers him over to the couch and lowers him down to it, clocking the limp and the feel of uneven skin through the thin, poncy shirt at his back. Sherlock collapses into the leather and Greg takes a seat on the coffee table in front of him, lowering his head to try and catch his gaze, but never letting go of his shoulder.
"I've found it difficult to sleep, recently," Sherlock said, quietly. "I could only imagine you upstairs, lying there alone. I've missed you."
John stared at him. "The chicken that ended up being dissected before you fried it over your Bunsen burner?"
Greg on the other hand... "Ah, Lestrade," Sherlock finally said, as he continued to hold John around his waist and John clung to his shirt. Greg was open-mouthed, literally gaping at them, standing near to the sofa, cup of tea in one hand. "Did you have any success with your case?"
He needed to question his friend, find out exactly what Sherlock was thinking, doing all this, having such an appearance of being on a date with his boyfriend. But John couldn't allow himself to hope that far, and he couldn't risk spoiling the night. He would continue to enjoy whatever Sherlock came up with. To question would be detrimental, John was sure of it, and he refused to put either of them on the spot again as he had those several weeks ago.
"Could you, whisper?" John asked carefully, scrunching up his entire face as he stood and came up beside Greg to the door.
Sherlock's hand shot out and John looked down as Sherlock gripped his elbow. "Did you sleep well?" he asked, a slight smile on his lips but a definite accusatory undertone in there too.
He shuffled to the bread bin and pulled out a couple of slices, but as he reached for the toaster Sherlock plucked them from his hand.
When he did stir, Sherlock squeezed John in his arms, pressed a kiss to the top of his head and murmured the most wonderful "Good morning," that John had ever heard.
Sherlock considered him for a moment. Finally, he met John's eyes. "I woke up from a dream so fresh I thought you would be beside me when I turned over. I was cross with you - with dream you, when you weren't there."
He leaned down and kissed him, sucking on his lower lip, still trying to hold back and knowing that he couldn't much longer. Sherlock's erection was bobbing between them and John took hold of it, producing an immediate sigh from Sherlock who blinked and tightened his hold. "Mmmm..." he murmured and John enveloped him, running his palm up and over the head, trying to maintain the gentle rhythm he had created; needing to go faster and desperate not to.
John let Sherlock's hand fall and went over to put an arm around her shoulders. "Mrs Hudson," he murmured fondly. "Why am I suddenly surrounded by insatiable romantics?" he asked the room at large.
John nodded and let his hands fall, sliding them down Sherlock's arms to his hands. He held on while he stood up on his toes and kissed Sherlock. Sherlock's arms slipped around his waist and he pulled John close as the kiss continued.
Back at home, Sherlock greeted him as usual from his desk, looking not quite as fatigued as John had expected. Perhaps he had managed to go shopping himself and got the damn kettle? And that thought reminded John that he had in fact forgotten to buy one himself on his way home. He had been so caught up with trying to return his sister's calls and making sure he had all his paperwork finished after the surgery had closed for the day.
The voice in his ear continued. "How would you describe my brother, John? Would you say he was the sort of person for whom affection came naturally? Or would you say that he could be in severe danger of emotional difficulties if say, oh I don't know, perhaps someone was toying with his heart? You do remember The Woman, don't you?"
"I think I just need space occasionally," he murmured, not looking back to Sherlock, not wanting to see anything in his eyes, or to give away anything in his own.
With a smirk he shook his head. "No, it's nothing, thanks though," he added, when Sherlock's face fell.
And that was before the sex had happened. Now, when he was watching, being reminded by John to eat his own food, tapping glasses with John, drinking the wine, which this time had a certain dryness to it that made Sherlock's tongue tingle and want more, the whole process was just leading up to them getting back home to give each other orgasms. It was all heightened this evening by the fact that John clearly couldn't concentrate because of Sherlock's jeans.
When he put his head around the door, Sherlock was snoring. John considered climbing into bed beside him, but they had currently only spent one night actually getting into bed together... he wasn't sure how Sherlock would feel if he woke up with John there.
Sherlock's cheeks were already beautifully pink and the colour darkened even as John looked on, feeling his own face warm in empathy. Sherlock was really hot, he was making John completely crazy - brazen and reckless, willing to try this, to risk rejection because it felt so damn good. He couldn't resist another kiss before drawing back again, studying Sherlock's features.
Angelo brought their food over personally, as he always did for Sherlock. He appreciated the man's unwavering loyalty. What he wasn't so sure about was the wink he gave to Sherlock when he thought John wasn't watching and then the look John was continuing to level at him when Angelo retreated to the kitchen.
Lestrade drew back, eyebrows raised. "That's it? No further explanation? Come on Sherlock, you've never had a date in all the years we've known each other. Does John know?" he added, seemingly as an afterthought.
Sherlock was already lying down but his chest was fully exposed beneath the cream sheet and he was looking relaxed and interested while John climbed in beside him.
John opened his eyes, trying to dislodge the feeling of imminent crushing doom that would occur if he left here and never returned.
Sherlock looked down into those eyes, serious, but with a sense of wonder in them, his tongue peaked out at the corner of his mouth and Sherlock knew - they had skipped over the part of the evening that might have been considered foreplay. And he was already growing hard when John's hands slid around his hips and squeezed. "John," he murmured, eyes closing as John began to undo buttons.
He gazed down stupidly at his friend, stomach flipping and heart racing, and pressed a final kiss to the swollen pink lips so temptingly close.
"Ok," John drew out, pretty sure that if this was anyone but Sherlock then the current mood would be easy to read as 'pissed off'.
John's heart was thudding painfully as he slowly brought the parcel to his front and took a step towards the bed. He dropped it down beside Sherlock - still staring - and muttered, "If it's no good I can return it, just thought you could use it."
Finally, Sherlock brought a candle to the table and put down a bowl of salad in the centre. John looked twice at the candle but didn't mention it. When Sherlock had suggested he cook for them both John hadn't dared to think he had anything in mind except some cooking practice. But there it was - a lit candle in between them at the neatly laid dinner table.
"Lucky you," Sherlock murmured, letting his hand fall away. John left him with his tea, glad he had the tolerance these days to avoid a hangover.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment. "I was just thinking aloud," he said after a while before muttering, "No, it's all me. As usual."
John nodded. He knew how important that was. He had been there for Sherlock too. It was time he stepped up for his own sister, no matter how unreliable she had been before. John hadn't been there for her when he was in Afghanistan, but Harry's life had turned to crap at much the same time as John's had. The difference was, Harry hadn't had a Sherlock to put her life back on track. John needed to help her now, if he possibly could.
"Mycroft, whatever you think you know, Sherlock is a big boy now, he can look after himself. And for your information," he added, lowering his voice to a harsh whisper, "I am not going to break his heart. Don't ever compare me to that woman."
he could do this. He closed his eyes and tried to control his breathing so that his thoughts stayed calm as well. He felt Sherlock's hand against his cheek, resting lightly. "Do you want blatant honesty, or should I break it more gently?" John asked softly.
"Well, thanks for that, Sherlock," he said as they walked, still a little unsteadily, through the front entrance of the police station. "It was... it was something."
John looked over and Mrs Hudson was actually mopping at her eyes with a tissue as she stood there watching them. "Oh, yes, yes, isn't it wonderful?" she said. "I've never seen them so happy."
wanted to?" John thought back, surprised that through a fog of alcohol he had been clear enough to think about stopping for the night.
John picked up a Bourbon and looked at it instead of his landlady. "Is it just me, Mrs Hudson, or is Sherlock making more of an effort these days?"
"Sherlock, I regret what I did every second of every day and it doesn't matter how often someone tells me I was under stress, there was no excuse for it. I'm so sorry."
Sherlock began whispering his name, over and over, raking his nails down John's back and holding his hips as John's gentle thrusts lost all coordination. He pulled oh-so-slowly out so that he didn't lose control. Sherlock blinked at him and frowned.
John took in a hitched breath and closed his eyes. Without anything to compare this to, Sherlock had responded perfectly. John couldn't fault him at all. "Sherlock, no, you don't have to do that. I didn't have any expectations." He opened his eyes, took a look at his friend to see if that was as offensive to him as it sounded to John. Sherlock just raised an eyebrow. "We're ok," John finished lamely.
“Rosamund, stay here please,” Mr. Holmes instructs before heading for the door himself with a final look back at the lady from last night who’s magically appeared at Rosie’s side.
He can see Sherlock’s gaze clock the child in the car before boring holes through his skin and muscle and marrow. “Where is he?”
“Okay, darling,” Nana whispers, fire gone, before tapping her nose and holding her hands out to pull Rosie up.
“Uh huh,” she replies, lower lip already wobbling because she doesn’t like this. She doesn’t like this one bit.
His bare feet are cold, and the wind bites through the thin cotton of his threadbare pajamas. Rope cuts into the tender skin of his wrists, and he grunts as he’s tossed into the back of a van. The pain that flares in his side is enough to steal his vision for a moment.
“Yeah, I’m not as dumb as I look,” Greg replies. “I had my suspicions at the time, but the amount of shit redacted in Mary’s file sort of drove the point home.”
“Good,” he echos, reaching up, flicking the switch, and casting the room into darkness. He leaves the door open though, and true to his word, she hears him limp to the top step and slowly lower himself down.
“Good,” he echoes, reaching up, flicking the switch, and casting the room into darkness. Leaving the door open, he sits down on the top step with a grunt, letting recent events wash over him. He feels like he’s lived a decade in a day. Did Mycroft only come to get him that morning?
Annoyed, he limps to the top of the stairs, but what he sees when he gets there halts his steps and sets his heart to racing.
Mycroft clears his throat. “Quite. She got close to him, closer than even she expected or intended to, I believe. I suppose she was satisfied by what she saw.”
She hears the door open and she turns her head just enough to catch sight of Nana in the entryway looking older than she ever has. And she was pretty old to begin with.
A bang sounds from downstairs and he turns into the hall closet and puts her down, taking hold of her shoulders and forcing her to look at him. “Remember what I told you, sweetheart? The name I told you to remember?”
His brother appears in the doorway a moment later, pausing for all of a second before striding over to Rosamund who launches herself at him. He hauls her up into his arms without a hitch, supporting her weight as if she were nothing but air.
His home feels far colder than it did just ten minutes ago, but he leads them into the sitting room and makes a move to stoke the fire. He can practically feel his brother’s gaze on his back and, steeling himself, he inhales a breath and turns around once more.
“This was a mistake,” Sherlock says and his voice rumbles in his chest, louder than the noises that still escape her body, whimpers and sniffles that she doesn’t recall ever making. Even when she broke her arm.
