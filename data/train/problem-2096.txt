John leaned nearer to him and stroked his hair. " Shhh... Calm down... Just breathe, okay? "
'Of course not, you're just too nice and sexy for them... They don't deserve you...'
" GO AWAY!"
John's eyes widen, he looked so hurt. " WHAT? Why are you meddling with that! Those pathetic stories, as you're saying, are living you, you utter idiot! You'd be in the gutter!" He yelled at him.
Today 11:08 PM
John smiled slightly, how could such a magnificent bright man not understand this?  " Do you really think that I would stop loving you because of some stupid fight and even more stupid jumper?"
The doctor was sitting on his heels, head bowed down, his breath fast and wheezing. His head was spinning, it made him feel dizzy again. His tanned skin seemed to be almost greenish at the moment, the little streams of sweat flowed down his forehead and neck.
' He internally scolded himself for letting that monster influence him this way, shoved the imaginary man into the 'Forbidden Room' in his Mind Palace and slammed the door behind him.
" Sorry if I doubted you... Because you shop every day..." John said in his characteristic sarcastic tone.
Sherlock rested on his back, thoughts and various scenarios buzzed inside his brilliant mind, projecting in his Mind Palace. What if John found it uncomfortable? After all, he was disturbing his personal space. The cold High-Functioning Sociopath has never paid much attention to the emotions of people around him, he simply didn't care. But John mattered, he was somehow very important to him. The doctor pointed out many times that he wasn't gay, and here he was, pressed against him like a leech. He turned his head to look at his flatmate with an unsure face.
John's lips curled in the smile, Sherlock didn't stop surprise him today. He was acting like a completely different person, he was kind, generous. Maybe he was trying to decrease his guilt... " Sherlock, you don't have to worry about me. I don't want to steal your room from you, you need to rest too..."
After the third unsuccessful attempt, he felt the pair of smaller hands unzip his jacket and help him out of it. Sherlock let his shaky arms fall down alongside his torso and let the ex-soldier take off his parka.

The detective grinned and covered John's hand with his and pressed it on his cheek. " I think I should blather more then..." He muttered and almost purred with pleasure when John's thumb started drawing small circles on his pale skin.
The goosebumps appeared on Sherlock's bare skinny torso and arms and he shivered a bit.
But it was completely understandable that he didn't want to give up on it, it was the only piece of clothing which made him feel like himself. And God knew how much John wanted Sherlock to be himself again!
" Sherlock?!"
He grabbed his wallet and phone which both laid on the table and opened the third drawer of John's desk to take John's gun.
The younger Holmes looked him in the face, and Greg's heart clenched when he saw a genuine surprise in those big blue-green eyes that sparkled in the evening shadows and light from the fireplace.
The British Government sat down beside him and put his hand lightly on his bony shoulder. " Let me take a look, will you?" He asked he didn't want his brother to feel worse than he already was.
" Well, it's unsightly a little bit, but you made it with your own hands which it makes so beautiful... Thank you." John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist and pressed a kiss on his cheek.
John, you're scaring me!
" Oh... Yes... Here, drink this... It's just a coke if you were worried... It could calm your stomach a bit..."
When the floor seemed to be safe to stomp at, he rose up on his feet and threw the mess in the bin.
Sherlock squeezed the black fabric on Greg's back in his fists and tried to suppress the flood of emotions, but the more he tried, the worse it was.
Sherlock's body jerked when he remembered that maniacal look in Magnussen's shark eyes, which hungrily gazed at him from behind his glasses, those importunate fingers that rubbed, mocked and hit his well-fed belly, those hurtful insults and comments that struck in his heart like knives...
" SHERLOCK!!!!" John's loud voice roared from the kitchen.
" Morning! How are you feeling?" John greeted him and approached the bed where his friend rested, leaned against the headboard with a book in his lap.
" A jumper?" Sherlock stated, raising an eyebrow. If it wasn't such a serious moment, he would find it funny. But it wouldn't be, because this was John's favourite jumper, the oatmeal cable-knit one. He knew John loved it.
His sharp cheekbones and sunken cheeks so typical for him were gone, replaced by two tiny round cushions on both sides of his face and droopy skin under his rounded jaw.
Then he remembered something and raised his head a bit.
John nodded but his head remained buried in between his knees. " Yeah, go on..." He replied, his voice vigilant.
John's throat tightened with anxiety and guilt. He bowed his head and fixed his gaze on his toes. " Sherlock I'm sorry... I've never been in a relationship with man, I never wanted to be...until I met you..." He confessed.
Sherlock smiled in a reply, his face seemed clearer. " I wouldn't even think about it ..." Then he choked, his face gone unsure. " John... I... I'm not good in that but... You should know that I... I've never been in a relationship with anyone... So I don't know how it works sometimes... But I'm a quick learner and... I love you, Jawn... "
I've never met someone like you, who wouldn't judge me for the way I think, who would stay with me despite my bad habits, who wouldn't see me as a freak..."
The former soldier let out a sigh and covered Sherlock's wrist with his hand. " Sherlock, it's fine... I had the exactly same portion like you, and it wasn't a lot... It's just vegetables and bit of meat - if you're hungry, have some more!" He said, unaware of the disaster his sentence could cause.
Sherlock seemed to be in such a shock he didn't even protest and let his flatmate take off his shirt.
" Sherlock, none of this is your fault, I just got crazy... I'm the only one who is responsible for that... I'll understand if you don't want to talk to me anymore because I'm insane..."
" Everything is boring according to you..." The ex-soldier grumbled and bowed his head down in another fit of retching.
"Famously furious? What does that even mean? And softer side? This is libel."
It was risky, in a public place, with so many witnesses. But Sherlock couldn’t allow John to go alone—they needed to do this together.
He jabbed at the button to call him.
Thanks to everyone who has read these ficlets or participated in the challenge themselves! I wasn't sure if I wanted to do it this year, and I cut a few corners to make it easier on myself, but I hope they brought some joy and welcome distraction to those of you who have been reading. Merry Christmas!
Moriarty was still squatting next to him. “Hello, Johnny,” he said softly, and then jumped backwards out of the way as John threw himself forward, apparently trying to use his head as a battering ram.
"Oh, shush, you." Mrs. Hudson flapped her hand in his direction as if she could swat him from a distance. He turned back to his laptop, half-listening as she opened the bag of dog treats and then admonished Stone when he took one from her. "Oh, look at that, you bit the head clean off before I could show everyone how cute it was."
First impressions: the cuts to remove the fingers had been made fairly cleanly, but not by a surgeon's scalpel: a large kitchen knife seemed a more likely tool. And to make cuts that low on the fingers, below the rings.... Sherlock flexed his own hand, looking at where his wedding band sat. Yes, a large knife would have probably taken off at least the pinky and middle fingers, as well. He should check local hospitals to see if anyone had shown up missing most of a hand recently, on the off-chance that Moriarty had let his victims survive and go free. He grabbed his laptop and used John's credentials to log in to as many hospital databases as he could. Nothing. So. Moriarty had probably killed the victims, unless he was holding them captive somewhere. Maybe he planned to send additional body parts to Sherlock. He wrinkled his nose. Stone and Mrs. Hudson would have a fit, and even John would probably get fed up if this became a regular occurrence.
"Well, we'll see what we can do." He stood up. As long as she didn't decide to trade masks with Livvy or any of the other children in her class. Four more cases in three days. Maybe John should reconsider having her in school this year. Not that Sherlock wanted to be responsible for educating a five-year-old while John was at work, but he could do it if he had to. He certainly wasn't leaving the flat for cases very often, and solving crime via Zoom meeting was less than fulfilling, even if it paid the same.
"Hey there, little sweetie," John said. "Look at you. Did Gran buy you some new clothes?" He grinned at her, then looked at Sherlock. "I can hold her for a minute while you finish your tea."
"Ankle," he responded, and tried again to stand, but it was clear he wasn't going to be able to put any weight on it. He surveyed the distance between himself and John, and assessed how his whole body was currently shaking after a surge of adrenalin.
He apparently did a poor job of disguising his level of concern, because Sherlock took two steps towards him and then wrapped him in a full-body hug.
Sherlock spent the evening stretched out on the sofa, reviewing the case in his mind, trying to see what he'd missed and wondering what Moriarty's next move would be, if in fact he did have a next move planned.
"What do you think happened? Moriarty happened." Sherlock turned to glare at Mycroft, accidentally whacking John in the chest with his elbow.
"Oh." She looked down at the tag again.
John pushed the dog out of the way so he could get into the flat, then glanced at his watch. "Er, I really need to take him out. He's been waiting a couple of hours. You want to come with us?"
"It's not a mistake." Sherlock's hands stroked down his back and settled at his waist.
Sherlock put his feet on the coffee table and slouched enough to rest his head on John's shoulder. "So why are you growing your hair out so long, if it's not to impress someone new? You complain about having to take care of it. Why don't you just cut it the way you always have before?"
Sherlock made a quick pass through the rest of the house to make sure no one else was there, then went back outside. He could hear sirens approaching from opposite directions, but none were in sight yet. John still had the girl on his lap, her legs hanging over one wheel of his chair, her upper body cradled in the crook of his arm. He had loosened the collar of the school uniform shirt she wore and was speaking softly to her, though her eyes were closed as if asleep.
"Sherlock. It doesn't need to be immediately, but you will want to have Eve baptised. It's tradition. Rosie was baptised, wasn't she, John?"
"I told you, I had bloodwork at 24 weeks. I've been taking vitamins, avoiding everything I'm supposed to avoid. No scans, though. I hope it's a girl."
"This is the matter at hand," Sherlock said, without taking his eyes off of John.
"So? Not your problem."
"Hey, what's this talk about coffee?" Lestrade called, as he and Anderson emerged from the building and joined them on the pavement. Anderson was still wearing his protective blue coverall—if anyone had reason to be embarrassed to be seen in public, it was him.
"I'm deleting all of these comments," John said.
"It's not the first time today he's been embarrassed." Sherlock took his hand back so he could show John the video Moriarty had sent.
"Right, right. Of course. Okay. Good night, John. Ah, I hope you have a good day at work tomorrow."
"You have another pair at work, don't you? You don't need three pairs of reading glasses, John."
"You don't have to keep checking on her. She's not going to—"
"Your detective work or your toxic chemicals in the kitchen?"
"Upstairs? Brilliant."
"I can do better than that." Sherlock pulled the bag from his pocket and rummaged around on the desk until he found a pair of small, sharp scissors. "John, grab a couple of those specimen jars from my shelf in the kitchen, would you?"
Obviously. John inhaled. "But you never.... I thought you didn't...."
Mycroft stepped all the way into the flat as Rosie and Mr. Holmes left. He and Sherlock exchanged a few brotherly glares before Mycroft settled onto the sofa, sitting at the end opposite from his mother.
Unfortunately, no one, not even Daddy, had ever been able to make Mummy change her mind once she had decided on a path. "No. I will see at least one of my children happy! Mycroft, you know John better than we do. Is Eurus right? Could he be in love with Sherlock?"
"No. I never wanted to see you again."
"You don't mind if we spend the night here, do you, Greg? We plan to go back to Baker Street tomorrow, no matter what Mycroft says."
"That we know of," John said. Yes, people could change—Sherlock had, and he himself had, over the years—but he didn't know if that was true of Eurus. "I don't think—"
"I'm sure those two statements together make sense in your head."
"And then some."
(And thanks to St. Vincent for the fic title, from her song Masseduction, which doesn't have too much to do with this story, but the whole album just gives me Johnlock/Holmes family vibes. Probably because of all the drug references.)
Sherlock put Eve down in the cot again and John found a notepad on the desk so he could start making a list of items he thought they should get if Sherlock planned to keep her here in the flat. He knew he still had some baby stuff in the crawl space at home. Mary had been pretty organised about putting things away as Rosie outgrew them back in those early days. There were definitely a lot of clothes, though he wasn't sure what else they might have kept. He hadn't got very far with the list when the doorbell rang.
"Where are we going, anyway? Molly's? Do you think she's home?"
"I know, it's just...." John bit at his lower lip. "We'll be back really quick, all right?"
"So, you'll have roast beef and potatoes for tonight," Mrs. Hudson interrupted. "Oh, and I brought your post up, too." She pulled a stack of envelopes from her apron pocket and set them on the table next to the scones. "At least I don't have to worry about that man sending any more gruesome packages." She shuddered. "And I'm very glad to be back home again, not that I didn't have a perfectly lovely time with your parents, Sherlock."
He sat on a stool and let the smile he'd been holding drop away. He watched her absentmindedly, fiddling with his phone and glancing at it to check the time every few minutes, wondering when Moriarty would arrive. Just as he was about to decide that perhaps he should wait in the hallway, to keep Molly uninvolved, his phone buzzed with a message.
Sherlock shifted her onto one hip and raised a finger to his lips. "You can see baby Eve, but you need to be very quiet so you don't wake her up. Can you do that?"
He wrinkled his brow. "How did you know where I was?"
"Oh, I know," Mrs. Holmes replied, although John didn't recall Rosie playing with Mr. Bear when she was here on Sunday.
"Sherlock," John said, after a moment, then giggled.
Once John had everything on, he stood and then started up the stairs, leaning on the forearm crutches for support while he lifted himself up each step, his legs locked in place by the braces. Sherlock carried his coat and the folded wheelchair up for him, staying several steps behind so John had room to move, but ready to catch him should he stumble.
“Yes. He’s hacked into the station’s feed. Anthea is trying to shut it down now.”
"Maybe I'll wait down here while you go up. Might be something you can solve quickly, and it won't be worth it to—" John waved his hand towards the braces, quirking his lip.
Sherlock swallowed and wiped a bit of the apple's juice from his chin. "No, but Moriarty's been in prison for years. I just need to go back further in their records. They might not be obvious, but I should be able to trace any payments he made to them before he was arrested. God, how could I not have realised that I needed to go back further?"
"Yes, you can. I want you right here on top of me."
"The sofa bed!" Sherlock exclaimed. "In the rear living room. You still have it, don't you?" It had been there for years, but his parents rarely used that room at all, so they would have had little reason to update it.
Gemma's office was the last on the left. The building was old and the hallway was narrow, and it felt as if the walls got closer together the further he walked, which of course was not true; one glance at John behind him showed that though he had little clearance on either side, his wheelchair fit through the cramped space without problem.
"She seems lovely, Sherlock," Eurus said. "Reminds me of Mummy."
John twisted his torso even more to the side, his hands jumping another inch closer to the lock he needed to disengage.
John leaned back in his chair and let out another slow exhalation. "And on that cheerful note, I think I'm going to go have a shower. Would you mind turning off the telly once the programme Rosie is watching is over? And she'll need something to eat for breakfast." He knew Sherlock would find something relatively healthy for her, and with any luck he would eat something himself.
John put Eve back in her cot, then dug through the cupboard in the hallway in search of the softest flannel he could find, while mentally listing more items they should get for her. Some gentle soap, a bathtub to fit into the sink—how long was she going to be here? Was Eurus going to come back? His gut told him no, though he supposed anything was possible, especially when the Holmes family was involved.
John dropped his gaze after a moment, rubbing absentmindedly at the flesh a couple of inches below his collarbone, just next to the scar. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to brush his hand away and replace it with his own; he wanted to leaned down and press his lips to the scar; he wanted to glide his mouth across John's chest. This had been a terrible idea. The worst. What had Molly been thinking? And why had he ever listened to her?
"The victim I saw appeared to be suffering from a severe case of food poisoning," John said. He turned away from her and glanced up at Sherlock. "You ready to go?"
Mycroft wasn't paying much attention to the video coming out of Sherrinford. His parents were viewing it, of course, from the comfort of their living room, but Mycroft was at work and didn't actually care about Sherlock and Eurus's little musical bonding sessions, as long as Eurus was secure in her cell. He was only watching because he planned to be too busy to visit Mummy and Daddy for Christmas and Mummy would be less angry with him if he pointed out that he had just seen them a few weeks earlier, albeit virtually.
"So, Sherlock. You and John are...raising Rosie together?"
"Er, I'm not saying that."
"No, it's just been you and your hand and your unfulfilled fantasies, I see, hasn't it?" Mycroft turned his back on him, and John had to fight back an urge to grab him by the arm and spin him around, to demand that he say that again to his face. What right did Mycroft have to make insinuations about his private life?
"No! There's no way." He didn't have to think too hard about it, even if she had disguised herself. "I haven't slept with a woman since Mary!"
"Have you really never done this before?" John asked, as he let Sherlock take control.
John's eyes widened. "You—" He let out a short, bitter laugh. "I can't believe you fucking counted my Viagra. What the hell is wrong with you?"
"Of course I'm right. But don't you think I'm dangerous even when I'm clean-shaven?"
If he learned anything before Sherlock did, he was likely to show up in person for maximum dramatic effect, but he wouldn't have bothered to ring the bell. He would just let himself into the building and then rant about their lack of security again.
The woman in front of John let go of the hand of another small child and shifted the infant she was holding on her hip. "Take Eli," she said, and tried to pass the baby off to John, but Eli squealed and clung to her side.
"He told me to get out, this morning."
Sherlock handed the basket back to Rosie. He waved the wrapped glasses towards John. "These aren't your reading glasses—those are in the bedroom. These are your spare reading glasses."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at her tone.
Rosie knew that Sherlock thought she didn't know where he and Uncle Mycroft were going, but she did. They were going to visit Aunt Eurus. Sometimes Sherlock went by himself at other times of the year, but every December before Christmas he would go with Uncle Mycroft. She thought that they brought Gram and Grandad with them, too, because afterwards they always came to visit, but none of them would ever talk to her about Aunt Eurus.
John took a deep breath and buried his face in Sherlock's shoulder again, then spoke into the silky fabric. "Me, too," he said, then sighed and stepped back. "I should warn you, though. I'm not very good at having relationships that last. Mary was the longest, and by the end I almost cheated on her. With Eurus. Before that, I never even made it a year with anyone."
"Oh, Jesus Christ, are you kidding me?" Rather than turning and fleeing, Donovan put her hands on her hips and glared.
"Sorry, sorry." John panted. He wasn't sorry in the least. He shucked off his pants and climbed onto the bed after Sherlock; he had to crawl several feet to reach the middle of the huge mattress.
"Yes. We all are. Come on, Rosie." Sherlock twisted around to look at her. "It's warm by the fire and there's room for all three of us here." He patted the space on the floor next to him.
"I know you do, but come on, John. Three nights ago you came in my mouth and I came on the sheets and then we both slept in it. We don't need to isolate from each other. It's pointless."
Long enough for John to get all the way into town, certainly, though not long enough for him to get there and back. The road into town was mostly downhill, and John could probably cover it faster in his chair than Sherlock could on foot, but the two-mile climb back here would be harder. John might even be willing to accept a lift home. Sherlock checked his phone, but there was nothing new, which meant nothing, except that John was likely still upset.
"When? Before or after I've forgotten what year it is?"
John hesitated for only a moment before deciding. "Okay. Mycroft does need to know what's going on, but when he finds out, I won't let him take Eve from you." He held Sherlock's gaze until Sherlock nodded, then they both looked down at the baby who had fallen back to sleep on his lap. John's stomach flipped—not with fear but excitement, and a newfound resolve. With Eurus out of the picture, hopefully for good, he had no qualms about Sherlock keeping and raising her baby.
John frowned at him as if he couldn't quite believe that much time had passed, then shook his head. "I don't know why I was so dehydrated. He didn't have me for that long. Must have been from the gas he used on me."
“Are you saying that everyone in England can see this?” Mummy asked.
"Tedious? Mycroft, it wasn't from a number that I recognised, but you can track the phone and find her."
Though Sherlock knew that he had his own lifelong burdens, now that he'd admitted that his depression and anxiety weren't something he could control on his own. He blew out a breath. "God, we really are a mess, aren't we?"
“Maybe you just missed him by a few minutes. Maybe he turned down a side street because he didn’t want to be seen.”
Rosie wrinkled her nose. "But why do we draw hearts for Valentine's Day at all? We could draw circles and triangles, instead. Or rainbows!"
"Oh, everyone's ready, I see," Eurus said. "You'd probably prefer it if I stopped talking now, but I can tell you that's unlikely to happen."
"I want a baby sister!" Rosie threw herself backwards, rocking against Sherlock's arms until he lowered her to the floor.
"Yes, we've RSVP'd," John said.
Sherlock knocked once on the front door and then let himself in, only to find Mycroft sitting in the living room, in front of the wood stove. "What are you doing here?"
Sherlock frowned and made no move to accept it from her.
He went back to his spot at the kitchen table while Mrs. Hudson prattled on. "And then I stopped at a new gluten-free bakery. I've never had a problem with gluten myself, but I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about." Sherlock perked up a bit. He enjoyed gluten as well, but if there was enough sugar in whatever she'd bought for him he would eat it anyway. "And they had the cutest little doggie treats. Shaped just like puppies! I had to buy a dozen. I knew Stone would love them."
"Being bored, mostly."
"Sorry, love. Maybe you'll figure it out in the morning."
"Perhaps our best option is to order some piddle pads—"
John came into the kitchen and began to pile the biscuits into the plastic container where they kept Stone's treats. Mrs. Hudson continued to bustle around the living room. "Clutter everywhere," she said. "You'd think two grown men would occasionally pick up after themselves. No, you just pile stuff higher and higher. So many papers. You both use your computers for everything, don't you? Why do you have so many papers?"
A small laugh made its way through Rosie's tears, and Sherlock used his thumb to swipe away the wetness beneath her eyes. "Would some hot chocolate make you feel better?"
"Wha—?" John didn't finish his question because Sherlock leaned over, kissed his cheek, then grabbed the keys from his pocket.
"Please, John, please." John hadn't expected Sherlock to start playing the role so quickly, but he did. "I need to be in your mouth. Open up." Sherlock put his left hand out as if trying to coax John's jaw open.
“What? Of course not.”
"The police are advocating stealing now?"
"Yeah, when you sleep on your back you do. Doesn't sound like sleep apnoea, though, so I wouldn't worry about it too much."
John gave Mrs. Hudson an apologetic shrug. "I'll be there in a minute," he told Sherlock. "I need to go get some more boxes out of the car. We brought some of Rosie's old things for Eve to use."
"I'll ask him. Go find Mr. Bear—I think you left him on the sofa."
"Didn't have any." She stepped all the way into the kitchen. "Well, there's a chem test tomorrow, but...."
"Are your muscles bothering you?"
"Yes, you are. You're not working today. What else are you going to do?"
John frowned at him, and Sherlock grinned as he pulled out a pair of the clear vinyl disposable gloves he never bothered to wear when he was doing experiments. He didn't put them on yet, just dangled them so John would see.
"You—" Sherlock paused. It wasn't really John's fault he'd stopped the meds so suddenly last year, nor was it his fault he'd needed to take them in the first place, though he'd never admitted it to anyone else before. He cleared his throat. "John. There is a not-insignificant possibility that I have needed to be on antidepressants since long before I met you."
"The tub's deep and not particularly easy to get in and out of."
"Just checking to make sure he's really not here." He pushed the door open all the way. The bed was unmade, and there was a pair of pink cotton pyjamas strewn across it: too small for Lestrade, even if he had enjoyed crossdressing.
John swallowed, feeling slightly awkward watching the two of them have this discussion in front of an audience. He understood Mrs. Holmes's anger, though. John had grieved Sherlock for two years, and had been unspeakably angry when he'd found out his death had been a lie. How much worse must it have been for Mrs. Holmes to have spent decades believing she'd lost her child?
"We won't. This is a special occasion." He stepped back from the chair, unable to keep a smile off his face, knowing that when John got up, it wouldn't be because it was time for him to leave. He lived here now. Again. Finally. It wasn't everything Sherlock had ever wanted—John would still be sleeping upstairs, not next to Sherlock in his bed—but it was still very, very good. Nearly perfect. He exhaled, letting his shoulders sag as a tension that had lived in him for years began to dissolve. "Yes, we're celebrating today. Pizza, I think, so Rosie will eat it without a fuss."
Sherlock tightened his shoelace more than he needed to and finally looked up to meet John's eyes. "All right. Your decision."
He hadn't even texted her back to ask what was wrong, just insisted that Sherlock let her in.
Sherlock heard more police sirens approaching as they walked away. Without turning around, he dropped one hand to rest on John's shoulder and waved the other in the direction of the sound. "I'm sure the police will be happy to answer all your questions. We have no information on the case and no interest in what Moriarty might do next." He had a moment's regret that he wasn't wearing his coat so he could make it flare out dramatically behind him.
"Yes, and the kitchen table is, of course, the obvious place to undertake such an endeavour." Mycroft wrinkled his nose. "I was going to accuse Sherlock and Gladstone of causing most of the problem but it looks like your hair is well-represented in that tangled mess as well, John. There are as many blond strands as brunette."
"God help us all." Mycroft frowned at the cot again, then turned back to Sherlock. "Regardless of how suited you think you may be as a parent, I assume that this child does, in fact, have a father already. We'll need to locate him, of course."
John knew Sherlock hadn't told her that Eve would be staying here permanently, but of course she was his mother—she'd probably deduced it on her own.
He knew John was much more comfortable in his wheelchair than using the braces, but Sherlock wouldn't have asked him to wear them in public if he didn't think it was necessary. He always preferred to have John at his side, and that was even more true with this case, since Moriarty appeared to be targeting the two of them as a couple. Feeling much more optimistic than he had at any time since he'd opened Moriarty's gruesome package yesterday, Sherlock exchanged his dressing gown for his suit jacket once more, then picked up his phone to let Lestrade know they would be there as soon as they could.
"I know. I just—"
"Do either of you want something to drink?" Molly called out from the kitchen. "You want a beer, John? Sherlock? I think there's some wine left, too."
"Unlikely. Come on, I'll tip it towards you and you can take the light end if you'll walk backwards up the stairs."
Or maybe Mycroft would find a match for him. Sherlock didn't like to admit it, but he knew his brother had resources he hadn't yet figured out how to access. Or maybe Mycroft's minions would catch Moriarty and Sherlock wouldn't have to think about him at all anymore. This morning's macabre delivery had been an entertaining distraction at first, but it had also caused enough tension between him and John that it wasn't worth the bit of fun it had provided. He did like challenging cases, but perhaps it was better when they didn't involve a personal connection.
Rosie dropped the remote on John's lap and slid off the sofa, running sock-footed past Sherlock to the stairs up to her bedroom.
"We don't have any coffee, only tea."
"Look at him." Sherlock gestured with the knife. "He's sitting back, away from the package, even after you suggested it was from Eurus. If he thought it might be from her, he would lean forward, eager to examine any clue about where she may have sent it from. But he knows it's not from her, because he sent it himself."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "Are you breaking up with me less than 24 hours after our first orgasms together?"
He slipped a finger beneath the seal and tore it open, revealing a plain sheet of white paper folded around several pages that had been ripped from a journal.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at her and Janine laughed again, pushing her scarf down so she could speak more freely.
"Mycroft would kill me if I tried to marry a criminal who had escaped his secret prison."
Sherlock glanced to his left at the baby monitor, then picked it up. "We could go—" He tilted his head up, towards John's old room.
They did arrive at Mummy and Daddy's in time for tea. Sherlock only gloated a little over the fact that if he'd done as John asked and picked up their dry cleaning earlier in the week, they would have had to waste more time shopping today. As it was, they only needed to buy some new socks and pants, and to let Mrs. Hudson pick out a bottle of wine to bring as a hostess gift.
"I'm sure he's doing his best."
Dad laughed, a very sharp and unfunny sound. “Well, I don’t believe that for a second. And she’s never going to be a part of Rosie’s family—that’s where I draw the line. If you and Mycroft want to keep visiting her, that’s your problem, but keep her away from my daughter.”
"I know," Eurus said, and shifted her hands so they nearly covered Eve completely before looking up to fix John with a stare.
"Sorry." John wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand, prompting Sherlock to dig in his pocket for a handkerchief, which John accepted with another apology.
John nodded and tipped his head back so it rested on top of the sofa, squeezing his eyes shut.
"Mycroft...." John could feel himself tipping closer to violence. He forced himself to step back and lowered his head, trying to control his breathing.
"Yes?" Sherlock didn't turn around—he was arranging his wallet and keys in their spot on top of his chest of drawers. By the sound of his voice—calm, even, casual—his thoughts, unlike John's, were not spiraling out of control as he tried to understand what was going on.
"I told you I'm not going back to a therapist." Even talking about how he felt with John was traumatic enough.
"Understood." Sherlock put his hands on him again, feeling the warmth of John's skin through his vest. Normally, he would have appreciated the way the tight cotton stretched across his shoulders, but now all he could think of was how Moriarty had run his fingers up and down that very same vest only a few hours earlier. He pulled his hands back. "Take off the vest, too."
"Yes?"
"Unless.... Do you want me to distract you with an orgasm right now?"
"Erm, no, actually," John said, then gasped slightly as Rosie propelled herself out of the box that was now a car and into his chest. "I have to work tomorrow, and if I want to be functional, I need to get some more sleep than I did here last night. Plus, this little one has been away from home since yesterday morning."
"But she left again, Sherlock," Mrs. Holmes said. "She left us, and her baby."
"Clerical work," Sherlock confirmed, stepping around the blood on the floor to get a better look at Amy's body. "He found it boring. Wasn't planning to make a career of it."
"Oh. She must have used a burner phone. She won't be caught that easily."
Mondays were always the busiest at the surgery, and today was no exception. He didn't finish with the last of his patients until after six o'clock, but Zoe, who minded Rosie during the week, was accustomed to the unpredictability of his schedule and didn't blink when he was late picking her up. She was, however, surprised by the news that Rosie had shared with her that day.
John wasn't sure what he'd been expecting. Probably Sherlock curled in a ball on the sofa, not standing in the living room looking exactly the same as he did every day. John stepped into the flat, trying to catch his breath so Sherlock wouldn't see his panic, but he had to know, immediately. "Did you take anything?"
"No, no. I'm fine." She fiddled with the strap on her handbag, glancing around the room.
He decided not to think about it.
"My boyfriend? I couldn't leave him behind. We've been together for three years now. He's the father, not John." She raised her eyebrows at Sherlock, then splayed her hand across her stomach again. "I never thought I wanted kids or a family, but now that I'm pregnant...." She shook her head. "I'm forty-one years old. This is my only chance." She paused. "Oh, and Bowie. I came back for him, too. He's my cat."
"She asleep?" John asked, as Sherlock came down the stairs and into the living room, tightening the belt on his dressing gown against the chill of the hallway.
"Maybe I'll wait a bit." John shifted his crutches. "It's not worth taking these things off if I'm just going to have to put them back on in a few minutes."
Sherlock stopped pacing long enough to look at Mycroft, who returned his gaze but didn't say anything. After a moment, Sherlock cleared his throat. "Mummy, I hope I speak for all of us when I say I'm sorry for everything you've suffered because of us. I think we're all trying to do better now."
"Okay. I'll ask him to." Rosie nodded and sniffed, but didn't say anything more after that.
The response came almost immediately:
"I.... Okay. I guess that's true." John turned on the sofa cushion so he could face Sherlock, but slid back a few inches so they weren't as close as they had been earlier in the day. "But you—you sat right here in this room a year and a half ago and told me you weren't interested in romantic entanglements."
"Hmm—oh. Yes, that might help with the pain, but he'd probably say he's too busy or doesn't want to risk more exposure by scheduling an unnecessary appointment. Are massage therapists even open right now?"
"John!" Sherlock's voice cracked on the word, and John knew that he felt John's orgasm, felt John's muscles contracting around him, and that it was what pushed Sherlock past the point of any control, as well. Sherlock collapsed against him, his body racked with small, unchecked shivers that John could feel against his skin.
"I do, I—"
Sherlock pushed back a stray surge of emotion—why should he care if Dreyer was dead? The man had worked for Moriarty for years; he'd brought this upon himself.
"Well, you need to tell him everything." John leaned back in his chair again.
Mrs. Hudson failed to take the hint. "John, you have to see what was in the paper this morning. It's the most beautiful photo of the three of you together." She put her hands out for Rosie, who happily let herself be passed off.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth again, then squatted down next to Stone. He put an arm around the dog's neck to keep either of them from trying to follow, and watched as John made his way down the driveway and away from the house. Stone whimpered and Sherlock tightened his embrace around his neck. "Don't worry," he whispered. "He'll come back."
John should have replied to her text saying he would talk to her at work next week, or that he would give her a call later today if it was really that urgent of a matter.
"Mm-hmm." She sniffed and wiped her nose on the sleeve of her jumper.
"I know." He took a deep breath. "It's just, I'd have to be away from home for months again, even longer than rehab, and for something that might not even make a difference."
Of course holding the girl while she'd progressively lost the use of her limbs had disturbed him, though he'd now managed to shift back into objective doctor mode.
"Well then, you should pay your employees better. They have to put up with you. I, however, am under no such obligation." He strode across the office to the rack where his coat hung and slipped it from the peg, making sure it flared out around him as he put it on. "I'll have my secretary return your payment first thing in the morning."
On its side as it was, the box wasn't quite big enough for her to stand up in, but once she was all the way inside, Rosie turned around and sat, then whacked the sides of the box with the palms of her hands. "Sh'wock! Come in, too!"
"Shh." Sherlock leaned over, pressing an ear against John's chest. He could hear his heart beating, but nothing else. He shifted his position so he could meet John's eyes but kept his head on his chest. "Cough."
"Perfect. Put your shoes on and we'll be off."
Sherlock sighed, then tried to make the best of the situation. "That's an excellent idea. Why don't you all pop downstairs for breakfast?"
"But you like how I look right now." He stopped pacing directly in front of John's chair, clasped his hands behind his back, and looked down at him. "You're aroused, aren't you?"
"No." Sherlock leaned back in his chair. "I wouldn't have told you if she had been, but I didn't hear anything from her until yesterday morning."
"That one!" He took off towards it, stopping only when he reached the chest-high metal gate that blocked access to the property's garden. His inclination was to swing himself up and over it, but he made himself take the time to reach over the top and unfasten the latch so John could follow. He swung the gate open and rushed through it, skidding to a halt again a few feet later. Four steps up to the front door, steep and narrow: he'd have to help John wrestle his chair up them.
"Hey." John's hand was on the back of his neck, a few degrees cooler than his own skin. Sherlock leaned automatically into the touch, then glanced around the flat. Enough time had passed that Mrs. Hudson was gone and Stone was asleep on the sofa. "How's it going?"
Sherlock glanced at the small package she held out to him:
"Well, someone told her," Mycroft said. "And I will now be leaving." He stood up. "If Mummy is on her way here, I would prefer to be as far away as possible by the time she arrives. She's spent the last year and a half castigating me over my supposed mistreatment of Eurus, and I have no desire to listen to her again today. Enjoy her visit, Sherlock. Though do take any parenting advice she offers with a grain of salt. Her track record with raising children leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Lovely," John said, and rolled over to sitting, leaving a sticky trail as he moved across the bed. "I'll just need another shower before then."
"Function without taking an antidepressant." He couldn't believe he had reached this point.
"That's your grandad over there, Eve," Sherlock said softly. "He's my daddy." He slowly lowered himself to his knees, until he was sitting on the floor next to John again, Eve cradled safely against his chest. "You've got the whole family here to see you, now."
John laughed. "He has people for that, doesn't he?"
Eurus kept her gaze locked on him for a moment, then nodded. A second later she gritted her teeth and pressed her feet down into the mattress as another contraction started.
He'd expected more of an exchange, but she didn't send another text, and now that he'd admitted his desire, he was too embarrassed to pursue the matter any further. He went to bed, instead, and curled up with his phone next to him, feeling even more confused than he had been before.
"Of course. Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective. And it's turned into much more than just a crush, I'm afraid."
"I told him yesterday."
Sometimes Sherlock was the one who read Rosie her bedtime stories and put her to bed at night, and sometimes it was John. They almost never did it together, but tonight, after John had given her a bath and gone upstairs with her, Sherlock had a sudden breakthrough on the case he'd been working on. He texted Lestrade and then ran up the stairs, eager to tell John about how clever the killer had been in hiding his crimes.
"Aren't you in prison?"
Sherlock stood outside Molly's flat, hoping that Rosie hadn't forgotten her umbrella at school again, because it was starting to rain and he wasn't too proud to be seen beneath a five-year-old's bright pink umbrella if it meant keeping his hair dry on their walk home. He was just about to lean on the doorbell again when the door opened and Molly looked up at him.
"I was almost here already when you texted me."
"Why not?"
Rosie nodded and led him through to the kitchen, where he pulled the seldom-used pocket doors shut so they wouldn't disturb Sherlock.
Another 221B as I attempt to catch up on the prompts. But today I finished my final chapter of
"No. Why would we have a generator?"
"Show me what hurts." He dropped to his knees in front of her, inspecting her hands and face, then gently touching each of her limbs, but she had no visible cuts and hadn't fallen hard enough to cause any significant injury. "You're okay," he said again, and hugged her to his chest. "I know, it was scary, wasn't it? But nothing's broken except for those two very ugly yellow baubles that I never liked in the first place." He leaned back and looked her in the eye. "Thank you for breaking them for me."
He probably won't read it but this chapter is for
"Okay. You won't do it again, right?"
Mummy pointed to the sprig that hung in the doorway. "There's one in every room. Why don't we all go back downstairs? There's plenty of food to eat, and tea. And Sherlock, I think you and John must have some news that you want to share."
John chuckled. "No, I guess not," he said.
"I paid you more than most of my employees make in a year!"
“No, I’ve got a lead!”
"I—" Sherlock began again, and then stopped himself. He knew better. He knew better than to talk to her. And yet. "He loves me, but not the way I love him."
He started in surprise. "No, sweetie, she's not your sister. She's just...." How could he describe her to Rosie? Sherlock's niece? Rosie wouldn't understand the word, and it didn't seem to fully describe his relationship with the baby, anyway.
Sherlock picked up a scone and bit into it, discovered it had raisins, and gave it to Stone to finish. He reached for the pile of mail that Mrs. Hudson had left for them and began to sift through it.
As he closed up his med kit, he almost laughed out loud. Here he was, praying that Eurus was healthy and that she would have a safe and complication-free delivery. How the hell had he ended up in this position? Except he knew exactly how he'd got to this point, of course. He really only had two motivations for most of the things he did these days: Rosie, and, as always, Sherlock. He sighed, then went downstairs to get Rosie so he could drop her off at Molly's on his way to Baker Street.
Sherlock adjusted his knees to either side of John—the leg braces were going to have to come off completely. They were uncomfortable to press against even for him, and if John left them on for too long he was likely to develop pressure sores. Sherlock tried to think of a way to make removing them sexy, and wondered how John would react to that, but before he could reach any conclusions, he was interrupted by the sound of a phone buzzing against wood. John's phone, left back in the living room.
"Don't listen to what I've said! I didn't know what I was talking about. It's Rosie's fault."
"It's okay, Sherlock. Not a failure on your part." John stood up but Sherlock stayed where he was, on his knees next to the swing, looking as if he wanted to pick Eve up again but was afraid to do so.
"I hate touching those shirts. They catch on my skin. I like looking at you wearing them."
When it was his turn to choose a gift, Sherlock reached for the other gift bag that John had brought to the party.
"Yes, yes." Sherlock looked at Rosie and they both sighed.
"Have a seat, at least." John pointed to his own armchair.
Moriarty's voice, chipper and sinister at the same time, made Sherlock's skin crawl. He inhaled and reminded himself that he had chosen this path voluntarily. "You're the one who needs to face reality," he said.
"Not hungry," he replied. He turned around and tossed the crisps onto her desk.
"Do you have any idea how much it cost to rebuild this building? She's supposed to be in prison! Why isn't she in prison? Why is she sitting on your sofa with a baby instead of sitting in prison, Sherlock?"
"Okay. All right. That's probably a good idea." He sighed and stood up again, then lifted her into his arms and went back out into the living room. "I think we've hit a wall here, Sherlock. I need to take her home." She would probably fall asleep in the car on the way.
"Yes, of course." Mycroft looked around the room. "No sign of Moriarty?"
John let his eyes blink shut and a moan escape as he gave his nipple ring a final tug and twist, sending a smaller but still very welcome surge of pleasure through his body.
“Yes, I have. Sherlock. You need to take this seriously. John’s missing, and you know what Moriarty is capable of. You should never have let him go off on his own.”
"She didn't steal your phone, she borrowed it," Sherlock said, when John returned to the living room. "She scheduled that message to be sent, then left the phone so we couldn't use it to track her."
"Well." Mycroft shifted his gaze briefly to Sherlock. "As long of the two of you are happy with it."
"No, it's not. I wasn't embarrassed. I was...caught by surprise."
Sherlock tried not to smile but John knew him too well. He ate the sandwich while John questioned him about what he'd learned from examining the rings and fingers so far. He was hoping that explaining it all out loud would trigger a breakthrough, but had no such luck this time.
There was an untidy pile of shoes and boots near the door; Sherlock kicked them out of the way so John could get by. The flat was small, compared to Baker Street, though not by London standards, and it lacked much in the way of interesting decor. The living room was a decent size, but the kitchen was tiny, and based on the layout of the flat, the bedroom wasn't much bigger. Sherlock opened the door and peeked in.
"I know." John shook his head. "I told Lestrade that I'd hit you—he watched it on the recording—but he didn't even bat an eye. No one held me responsible. But you should have. And if I ever start to do something like that again, to you, or anyone else, you need to stop me. I know you can—you stopped me from punching Mycroft the other day. But I shouldn't—I shouldn't have to be stopped. I'm trying. I'm trying to be better."
"John," he said, and clasped his hands behind his back. He stood in the middle of the room, wearing his dark blue dressing gown over a thin white t-shirt and a pair of grey pyjama bottoms.
"He's not in here." Lestrade pushed the door open all the way so Sherlock could see. "He went out into the hallway about five, ten minutes ago. He told you he was going—I heard him."
—and watched as John buttoned his shirt and tucked it neatly into his trousers.
John wouldn't have minded if they'd kept talking, though he knew he should get some sleep. But that was always how it was, wasn't it? He was willing to do almost anything, as long as Sherlock was involved.
"I didn't count them. I could tell by the weight of the bottle that some were missing."
John turned his head slightly towards Sherlock's voice and then stilled, his eyes slipping all the way closed again.
"No. I feel more—excited. With anticipation. There's a bit of disbelief, too."
"Power's out," John said.
"Bye, Sh'wock," Rosie said, and stuck her tongue out at Eve. She was a well-behaved child. Most of the time. At least her behaviour was age-appropriate, he knew—no child enjoyed being replaced as the centre of attention when a new baby was born. Sherlock had no doubt done the same thing when his parents had come home from hospital with his new baby sister. Not a particularly comforting thought, but there it was.
"What did you say to me then?"
Sherlock nodded. "I understand. Though I expect fewer complaints about the dangers of my work in the future."
Rosie sort of smiled at her, which was probably the most Molly could hope for right now. "Do you want to go back out to the party, or do you want me to go get your dads and tell them you want to go home?"
"Erm," Sherlock said, and turned from the cot to the bed and back again before treading carefully across the room and lowering himself into the chair in the corner, holding his upper body still so Eve wouldn't be disturbed.
"Oh, okay. Well, you're welcome to sit and watch me work, if you want. Or I've got a cancerous heart in the freezer if you want to take a look."
Mycroft came into the room uninvited. “What happened?”
"Why on earth would I want a life with a normal person when I could have one with you?"
"I don't really speak it," John said. He stepped closer to Sherlock and then sat down next to him on the floor, reaching for the box of scones. "But I can understand some of it, especially if it's simple phrases like that, spoken slowly by an Englishman like you."
"I see," Aunt Eurus said, and glanced at her watch, which looked shiny and new, as did her entire outfit—her jeans still looked stiff and her trainers were perfectly clean. "Well, I think I have a bit of time before I need to run out of here. Where do you keep the Christmas decorations?"
"He's not a—okay, maybe he is. I'll catch him quickly, though. He's not as smart as he thinks he is."
"Because we have a young child who gave up naps years ago. But now...." John let his tongue dart out between his lips in anticipation.
Sherlock was far enough gone that it was hard to concentrate on what he was doing to John, but he kept his hand moving, feeling John stiffen beneath his fingers as they moved together for another deep kiss. He dug the nails of his left hand, short as they were, into John's shoulder, which made John break off the kiss with a moan. "Shh," Sherlock whispered.
"You gave him Gemma's name? How did you even know...?" He turned his glare on John. "You told her about me seeing a therapist?"
"You didn't forget. You were just thinking about other things." John swung himself out of his chair and settled on the sofa next to him. "Come on now, stop it. You are not being any more forgetful than normal, all right? You're not losing your memory."
"What did we get?" Sherlock wrinkled his nose, looking at the bags John held. One was heavier than the other. "Candles, and—"
Content warning/SPOILER: This chapter does depict a family, including two children, that Moriarty has harmed. I personally don't consider it to be very graphic (they were poisoned) but you may want to skip the part where Sherlock enters the house if this may bother you. I would say it's not any more graphic than the show itself.
He was sitting in his wheelchair, eyes closed, his chin tipped forward onto his chest.
"I got a text tonight. Three texts. From Irene Adler." He looked up and locked eyes with Sherlock. "She said you wanted to have dinner."
John stepped back and tried to school his expression so he didn’t look disappointed. "Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean to go too fast."
Sherlock put the calendar down on the desk and sagged back into Gemma's chair. John glanced at him and said, "This is a nice little office Gemma has here. The cleaning lady seems fond of her, says she hopes she's all right." He turned to look at the sofa and armchairs, as if the insipid decor of the room fascinated him. "You ever think about coming back for a few more appointments?"
Sherlock frowned at him. "I won't get sick. I never get sick. You—"
"Yes." Sherlock replied. John didn't usually check up on him like that anymore, but he understood why he might have expected Sherlock to skip the antidepressant tonight, given how much he always complained about it making him sleep too much. But right now he welcomed that irresistible pull of sleep; it would be better than lying awake wondering how to solve the mystery of the fingers.
Mummy called them for tea soon after, and while the food was excellent, the rest of the afternoon and evening were as tedious as Sherlock expected. Even watching Mummy and Mrs. Hudson pretend to be civil to each other soon grew boring.
"Oh, Myke." Mrs. Holmes reached across the sofa and patted him on the knee. "You do have a soft heart in there somewhere, don't you?"
"I remember it being in March. Are you sure about the year?"
Sherlock's elbow landed in a patch of cooling ejaculate. He jerked away, laughing in spite of himself. "Oh, God. Disgusting. Clean yourself up." He reached down to grab the sheet that had been covering them earlier, and pulled at the hem of it until he found a spot that seemed dry.
"The bearded man," Sherlock said, as he stepped into the living room during John's second attempt to introduce Rosie to an episode of
“There’s a helicopter on the way here,” Mycroft said softly. “We’re tracing the signal from the video broadcast just like we did with the phone. We’ll find them.”
"I don't know," Sherlock said. "And I can't check because I'm not allowed to put weight on my ankle."
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, frowning, then asked, "Who texted you? Not Eurus, I hope. She's not supposed to have access to a mobile."
As soon as he'd read it, Sherlock stabbed at the screen to delete the text, wondering how Moriarty was watching them. He probably wouldn't have risked staying nearby himself, though maybe he was that reckless.
He had the sound turned low, but he could still hear it when Eurus's violin stopped abruptly, and a moment later Sherlock's playing screeched to a halt, as well. He looked up from the file he was reviewing, frowning at the camera feed. On his second monitor, Mummy and Daddy were leaning forward on their sofa, their hands clasped together. What had Mycroft missed?
“Has he done this before?”
"Okay, as long as you think you can handle it. Wouldn't want you to wake anyone up shouting my name or anything."
Eurus's fingers curled slightly where they were splayed atop Eve's tiny back, and a slow smile bloomed across her face as she looked past Mrs. Hudson and John to meet Sherlock's eyes.
"Actually, I called the surgery and told them I wouldn't be in. Told them I needed time off for a family emergency."
"What? Tell me."
"If only life were really that easy. She'll have used a burner phone and disposed of it. Or borrowed one from some unsuspecting bystander. We would waste resources chasing after it only to discover that she's long gone—you have learned about the ability to schedule a text now, haven't you, John?"
"Not in your love life! Sherlock! Oh, John, I'm so sorry, we shouldn't be arguing like this on such a happy occasion. And in front of Rosie, too." She turned back to the sofa, where Rosie sat near Mr. Holmes, playing with her stuffed bear. "Rosie, love, show Daddy what Mr. Bear is wearing, why don't you?"
"You do?" John asked.
Sherlock was once more sitting calmly in his armchair, all traces of the panic he'd exhibited a few moments ago seemingly gone. He'd pulled the cot up close next to him, and Eve lay on her back in it, quiet at the moment but waving her arms and legs erratically in the air.
"Can we get pizza?"
"It's just a plant, John. You can buy tomatoes at the shops."
"Night, Daddy!" Rosie trilled. "Night, Sherlock."
"No." Sherlock sat up straight and frowned at him. "Why would she need to steal a card? I'm sure she has dozens of anonymous bank accounts. How else would she have survived ten months out on her own without leaving a trail of burglaries for Mycroft to discover?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Really? Did you figure out how to catch Moriarty?"
"Sometimes I hate the fact that you're a doctor."
"Thank God. I thought they would never leave." Sherlock dropped down onto the sofa and put his arms out to allow Rosie to climb onto his lap. "I can't believe my mother thinks I need her to stay and help me. I'm a 40-year-old man."
"We'll need to get a different duvet cover, though." Sherlock lifted himself up enough so he could straddle John and shed his dressing gown. "This beige is terrible and we'll have it stained inside of a week."
“Let him go right now, I swear—”
John let Sherlock's fingers fall from his mouth, returning his lips to his neck, then up and across the stubble on his chin and cheeks, until he finally found his lips again. He pressed their mouths together and Sherlock put his free hand on the back of John's head, gently holding him in place. John kissed him, and Sherlock changed his stroke once more, dragging his hand all the way to the base of their cocks and holding it there for a moment before sliding back up to the top.
Sherlock turned to face him, spreading his arms. He wasn't going to pass up an opportunity to put his arms around John, even if it wasn't in the context he would prefer.
John could tell that it was painful for her to walk even the short distance across the living room, but he made himself refrain from offering any assistance as she passed by him. She made her way slowly through the kitchen and down the hallway, then disappeared into the bedroom with Eve.
Before he could decide what to do, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and glanced at the screen.
"Yeah. But we've got the weekend to figure it out. I'm done hauling boxes around for now." John walked across the room and dropped into his armchair with another sigh, though this one was clearly one of relief.
"But I paid you to take my case!" Mr. Fletcher stepped around his pretentiously large wooden desk towards Sherlock. "You have to solve it!"
"No, I just—" John dropped his hands to the wheels of his chair and exhaled before nodding. "Yeah, I did. I saw the study last summer, a few months after it came out."
"Dog-walking can be aerobic. You just stop and talk to too many people when you do it."
"Okay, well. That still doesn't mean I like another man sending you wedding rings."
Next to him, John stiffened and Sherlock automatically took a step closer to him, slipping an arm around his waist, over the hard plastic support that covered his lower back. He could feel the metal joint of the brace that locked John's hip in place pressing against his own thigh.
Eurus wriggled the little finger on her left hand, testing the grip of the tiny fist Eve had wrapped around it. "I can see why Sherlock likes you."
John stayed as he was for a few long moments, though Sherlock was heavy against his back. When he felt he could once more breathe enough to speak, he opened his mouth and said one word, "Sherlock."
"She's not 80."
"Come on. Get up." John whacked him on the knee with the back of one hand. "Mycroft's people identified where Moriarty's phone was yesterday when he called us."
He blew a few breaths towards it and John's nipple began to pebble around the ring, though he clearly wasn't cold.
Sherlock elected to ignore their nonsensical exchange. "I assume since you already skipped town once on your own, you don't need our help escaping Moriarty's notice. You just want help getting David out. And your cat."
"Wearing a mask." His voice was a bit muffled through the mask, but he knew that John could hear him.
John let his nurse know that he needed a few minutes before his next patient. It would be quicker to call Sherlock than return his text, since he could get an immediate response rather than waiting for a reply. And Sherlock did answer, on the first ring.
He thrust them at her again. "In lieu of payment, you are to procure the items listed on these tags and return them to me by the 18th of December, at the very latest. If no one is home here, you may leave them with the staff at Speedy's downstairs."
"No. He's not ill or injured. He just needs to be checked out and given time to sleep it off. I'd rather be at Barts because I know it better. They'll give us a private room. Put a guard outside the door if you want to."
"Yes. Just give me another minute." He stretched his right leg out in front of him, testing his ankle.
"Patience," Sherlock told him. He slid his thumb back and forth a few times across the cleft of John's arse. The gloves weren't ideal—they caught and stuck against John's skin as he moved his fingers, but that wouldn't be a problem for long. He squeezed a generous amount of the lubricant into his hand, letting some of it drip off to land on John.
Their hotel room had a view of the beach, and though in John’s opinion it was much too cool for swimming, there were a handful of people who were braving the water anyway, mostly children Rosie’s age or younger, while their parents watched from the shore.
She was almost fully dilated before John realised that Sherlock hadn't returned to the bedroom, although the better part of an hour had passed.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
"What? Me? Yes, I'm calling to see if you're okay."
She began to apologise the moment they set foot in the house, explaining how she hated to impose but that Mycroft had insisted she leave Baker Street, even though her flat had suffered very little smoke damage. She'd spent nearly the entire car ride here expressing the same sentiment. Sherlock had feigned sleep and retreated into his Mind Palace, regretting the fact that he’d told the bodyguard he didn’t need to accompany them on their stay in the country. Leon could have kept Mrs. Hudson entertained, at least.
Sherlock went out onto the landing to call Mycroft, and John missed most of the conversation, because Eve started to fuss and quickly became loud enough to overcome his best attempts at eavesdropping. He took her into the bedroom and set her down in her cot, then rolled the whole thing out into the living room, so she would be nearby while he got a bottle ready. It would be a lot easier if they had a reclining swing or something similar to put her in—they'd have to get one if she was going to be here for any length of time. In fact, they would need to get quite a few more things for her. Babies might not need anything fancy to survive, but a few choice accessories sure made it easier on their parents.
"Okay." John pushed the notebook back towards Sherlock. "Why?"
"Why did they have to get married?"
"Who is Naomi and why would I bother going to her wedding?"
"No one paid—Mummy! Whatever happened to the rage you were meant to have if you found out who shot me?"
Sherlock pursed his lips and didn't reply. People always told him he looked younger than he was, but what was the use of that if it didn't actually prevent him from getting old?
Sherlock twisted his lip in objection but obeyed, walking past Mary to take his place in his own chair.
Rosie was in a much better mood after she napped in the car; she spent the rest of the day helping John sort through her old baby clothes and toys to see what they could pass on to Eve. Well, John did the sorting while Rosie played with the toys and pronounced each item of clothing either "good for baby" or "too ugwy." He did learn that she was still terrified of a plastic owl with spinning eyes that Mrs. Hudson had given her after Mary died. John tucked it away beneath a pile of winter clothes that would be too small for Eve by the time it got cold again—he would donate the lot of them when he got a chance.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose and turned in a slow circle, seeming to examine the room, though there was nothing of interest to John's eye. Just an empty cell, smaller than the one that had been Eurus's, no furniture or anything to break up the grey monotony other than the camera and speaker mounted overhead. "Okay, Eurus," Sherlock said. "Tell us what we're doing this time so we can get it over with."
"Indeed." Sherlock dropped the lube and the tree on the bed near the pillows, put one hand on his own cock and reached behind himself with the other. His eyes rolled slightly as he stroked himself front and back.
"I'm not...." John shrank away from him, drawing his shoulders in, both hands curled in his lap. "Hit me back."
He stalked through the kitchen, buttoning his shirt as he went. He would chase her away, though the guard outside should have already done that.
"Not that I know of." John slid one hand across the mattress and settled it on Sherlock's shoulder.
"I see that. Why are we screaming?"
"I don't know how to give a foot massage, but I'm willing to learn."
Rosie wrinkled her nose for a second. She used to sit with Sherlock like that when she was little, before she was even in school, and he would read to her in front of the fire while they waited for Dad to get home from work. He always made sure she was sitting on the rug; if she moved off it and onto the bare floor, he would say she was too close to the fire.
"It can," Sherlock said.
"Everything!” Rosie repeated, and sat up enough to speak. “It was terrible! First, it was Bella. She was drinking the spiked punch, and I knew she was doing it, but I didn't know how much she'd had. So then she came over to talk to me, and I smiled at her, and she kissed me. But her mouth tasted awful—I think she had eggnog, too, and it was disgusting, so I asked her to stop, but she wouldn't! She just kept trying to kiss me, like I owed her because she came to the party with me, until finally Uncle Greg saw us and started to come over and then I think she got scared because she knows he's a cop, so she left."
"I'm not—sorry, what?" He took the phone from his ear to glare at her imbecility and Donovan grabbed it from his hand.
John forced a smile as she tittered—he knew she indulged Rosie's sweet tooth much more than he liked when she watched her, but that wasn't high on his list of concerns right now. "I'm not planning on staying long enough for breakfast. I was just about to check in with Sherlock and then I'll be off."
"Why?" Sherlock made himself look at John's face instead of his gun, lamenting that there'd been so few opportunities for him to wear it since he got the new holster. "Since when are you bothered by a couple of extra body parts in the flat? I haven't had them near any food."
"You do." John knelt down beside him again and carefully reached out with one hand to touch Sherlock's chin. "Look at me. You're doing fine."
"Oh. Because...Eurus." John turned to face forward again, lifting his shoulder, testing its movement. "I can't imagine what that must have been like for your parents. All those years." He thought of Rosie asleep upstairs alone.
"No, Dad. Come on. Thrifting is where all the best clothes are, and stuff like records and CDs and Abby got this cool wooden duck last week. You can't buy that new."
QuickPro Accounting—the sign had been removed but the outlines of the letters were still legible on the door. The late morning light would have come through the windows inside the office at the correct angle to match the broadcast they had seen, and the door was cracked open—the only one that was.
"Why not? Call a cab, or an ambulance if the contractions are less than two minutes apart." He glanced across the room at Rosie, remembering how close she'd come to being born in the backseat of their car.
"Grandad!" Rosie shouted, and John had his answer, as Rosie's grandfather entered her bedroom with a string of fairy lights looped over his shoulder.
"Oh, not much. We're just going to the thrift store."
"No! Just you running down and then back upstairs. Did you see her leave?"
"God, don't be such a—" John snaked a hand into the huddle of Sherlock's body and pulled the phone from his jacket pocket. Sherlock let him. John deserved to have to deal with Mycroft right now. "Please tell me you have some good news," John said, by way of greeting.
He hoisted his work satchel over his shoulder and climbed the stairs, fatigue suddenly hitting him after a late shift at the surgery. It was nearly Rosie's bedtime, though he doubted that Sherlock would have thought to feed her and give her a bath, especially if he'd been focused on decorating all day. Which he must have been doing, because now here was a Christmas tree at the top of the stairs, tucked into the corner outside his flat. It was small, only about a meter high, and decorated in toddler-safe fabric and plastic ornaments, with a heavy emphasis on yellow and purple, Rosie's current favorite colors. Based on the clustered positioning of the ornaments, Rosie herself had been in charge of trimming this tree.
Sherlock frowned, thinking back. "You had it freshly cut for the wedding, I know that, though it was a little shaggy before that. And since then...oh." He shifted his position so he could get a better look at John's head. "You've been gradually letting the time between cuts get longer, haven't you?"
Rosie gave a vigorous nod as she tucked Mr. Bear beneath a blanket in the pram.
"Nothing, nothing." John lowered his arms and sat back, trying to control his laughter. "It's just—this. I can't believe we’re doing this. Finally. I'm not even sure what else will happen, but we just kissed. I—" He let himself slump sideways slightly, against the sofa back, basking in Sherlock’s soft smile. "Amazing."
—much too risky to ask him directly
Lestrade turned to Sherlock, but before he could start telling him what he had found in the victims' flat, Anderson appeared in the doorway behind him.
It took several passes with the knife to cut away all the tape that secured the package shut. Inside was a smaller box, perhaps six inches in length and half that in width, covered in bright red gift wrap and cushioned in a nest of shredded paper. A folded note sat atop it. Sherlock picked it up and read the handwritten text aloud. "
Sherlock was just as eager for her to be gone, and had no desire to take a cheque from her. He glanced one more time at the way she was dressed and the precision of her haircut and grabbed a handful of gift tags from the stash on his desk. "I'm feeling festive today. No charge, but I'll need these here by the 18th."
Sherlock's brow wrinkled for a moment, then he darted out the door and down the stairs. A moment later he was back, carrying a plain brown cardboard box, with no markings on it other than a label with Eve's name and the Baker Street address.
"I can't bring three dates to a party!"
Apologies if there are any typos. This one got long which makes it harder for me to find the mistakes.
John hesitated a moment, letting the implications fall into place in his head before speaking. Eurus had escaped from prison early last summer and hadn't been seen or heard from in...a little over nine months. Shit. This wasn't a joke. He stepped out of the living room, leaving Rosie just out of sight as he leaned against the wall of the kitchen. "Is she—is she going to try to kill us? Is she forcing you to call me so she can kill me when I walk through the door?"
"It was not all day. And I made a pizza after we got back from our sex holiday, but you wouldn't eat it."
"I also broke into your brother's house and put a camera in his fitness room. Then I got the hell out of town while I could, before Moriarty started asking me to do stuff I wasn't willing to do anymore. I told my boyfriend I had a sick aunt and dropped my cat off with him, then I left. But as soon as I was gone, I knew I had to come back."
"No need for that. I can take it from here." There was the sound of a heavy package being slid across the stoop, then Sherlock called upstairs. "John, I'll need a hand with this, I think."
"Hold an umbrella for me?"
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Sherlock seems to think she can't do any harm right now, which might be true if she's really in labour. But once she's had the baby...." He trailed off, unsure of what would happen. He certainly couldn't imagine Eurus as a mother.
"No, Dad! I'm not bringing a friend! I want to bring a date."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, wondering if he had miscalculated. "No. If you were trying to punish me, you would have done more than just toy with us the way you did. You would have hurt us."
"Oh, I happen to know for a fact that you've saved a life or two in your time. Don't discount yourself."
"No, she's…. She said she was going out of town for a family emergency. Something must have happened."
Sherlock raised his head, hoping no more than a few seconds had passed. John was on his feet now, in front of him, and still smiling. John was smiling at him, with his shirt off and his shoulders slightly glistening with oil as he stood in the middle of their flat. He was smiling at him, and waiting for an answer.
"I'd like to see you try!"
"No, I think I've got it," Sherlock replied, and sure enough, a moment later, there was a small crackle as the fire started to spread across the kindling and down to the large logs he had laid in the grate. Sherlock leaned back, settling to sit on the floor with a groan.
"It all worked out for the best, though, didn't it? Or at least as well as you could hope, with Eurus, I mean. Is the baby going to stay here? With Sherlock?"
"Oh, Sherlock, hi. I thought John was picking her up today."
"He's not going to take her and lock her up, Sherlock. She's an infant." Though now that he thought about it, he wasn't sure what Mycroft would do. "You—you plan to keep her yourself? Permanently?"
"And who's the father?" John asked. "Is he clean?"
John decided he didn't have time for a lesson on colours, especially given that she didn't actually own any green socks, as far as he recalled. He pulled two complete outfit changes and a nightgown from her drawers and added them to her overnight bag, then squatted on the floor to help her put on the socks. "Where are your shoes?"
"John! You can walk!" Anderson exclaimed.
Mycroft pulled the laptop back across the table. "He can't kill you, John. He knows that if he killed you, he would lose any chance of ever winning Sherlock's heart."
"What—who? I thought Eurus left. That's what Sherlock said on the phone. Has she come back? Is she—"
"Be careful," John shouted after him. "Don't inhale."
"Because, Dad." Rosie huffed and put her hand out for the money he hadn't taken from his wallet yet.
John made another noise of discontent and Sherlock tightened his left arm over his chest. John didn't relax at the touch, so Sherlock tipped his chin, meaning to kiss him on the cheek, just as John turned towards him again, bumping into Sherlock's still-sore nose with his forehead.
"Haven't been able to get through to anyone," Donovan said.
"Oh, you'll know it when you see it." She giggled again.
John waved the mother and her sons past him so he could shove one of the tables against the wall to give himself enough room to turn. Mr. Chatterjee had added a ramp out front last year after John had been injured, but the café's accessibility still left much to be desired. Sherlock had seen people with larger power wheelchairs or wide prams that couldn't even fit into the building.
They rearranged themselves so they were side-by-side on their backs, the floral bedsheet Sherlock recalled from his childhood covering them both to mid-chest. "I didn't bring any lube, either. Didn't think we'd need it."
"Well, I have to tell John.  And I'd show it to Mrs. Hudson, but she prefers heavy metal...." He grinned in spite of himself and used the edge of his t-shirt to wipe smudges off his phone screen, just in time to see another message pop up below the video link. A whole series of messages, actually, landing one after another in his text app, much too quickly for Moriarty to be typing them out live.
"You did no such thing." John slid off the bed and crouched down to look beneath the bed—the box had fallen against the wall at some point in the last few years. "You've never tidied anything up here in your life."
"No," Eurus said, and crossed her arms over her chest. "I can't. Not yet. I will, but not yet. You keep her for now," she said, leaving John standing at her bedside, her new-born daughter still crying in his arms.
"Yes, all right. Did you get your bag like I told you to? And Mr. Bear, I saw he was on the sofa."
"Morning, love." John smiled up at him and Sherlock leaned down for a quick kiss. "You'll have to reheat the kettle if you want a cuppa. And I'll take a second one while you're at it."
"She's staying," Sherlock said. "John, you were getting me a screwdriver?"
"I don't have anything in the flat."
"No, but it took you ages before you could pronounce your own name. It was adorable. John, you should have heard him. He said it just like Rosie does." She smiled at him, then continued. "Come to think of it, Eurus was able to say your name before you could, Sherlock. Mycroft tried to help you, but you wanted no part of that."
Sherlock expected an eye roll at the declaration, but John just gave a small shrug and seemed to pull his shoulders in closer, making himself look smaller than he was. Sherlock had to resist the urge to crawl into his lap again. Instead he leaned back in his chair, trying to appear casual. "I know you've never believed it, but it's true." He waved a hand dismissively. "And anyway, Moriarty is too skinny. And he's definitely going to go bald someday. Also, the criminal insanity is not a turn-on for me, as hard as that may be to believe."
"Why—?" The question was out before he could stop it. He knew why, could possibly even agree that John deserved to punch him, but that didn't change his need to keep him safe. He'd take a thousand punches if that was the cost. "John."
"I know. But he just told me that he needs to kill someone so he can be on the news. Then he mentioned you and your 'little gun.' I'm not taking any risks."
"Presumably they also know it's been a while since you've satisfied a woman, anyway."
"Turn on that little lamp over there and open the curtains." He lifted his chin towards Sherlock, who had stopped talking when he realised John wasn't listening. They wouldn't get much light through the windows at this time of day, but every little bit helped, and he was pleased to see that Sherlock did as he asked without question. He would have had him open the windows, as well, but it was probably best to leave them closed in case Eurus turned out to be a screamer, which seemed likely.
"Sorry, sorry." He pulled his hand away.
I did zero research into the type of drug that Moriarty used on John and just made up the effects it might have (and the fact that it could be used as a gas and an injection?) and also I've never really had a medical beta for this series, so just pretend all the hospital stuff is accurate.
"If it makes you feel any better, I didn't ask Mary for a plant. She said she had too many this year and didn't have enough room for them. Sarah and Robby and Sharon all took one, too."
"No opiates, if that's what you're concerned about." He sat back on his heels but didn't look up at John.
Sherlock inhaled, rapidly cycling through a string of emotions: disappointment, anger and a very brief burst of shame that he banished immediately. He glanced at John, who seemed to be having a more difficult time overcoming his embarrassment, if the colour of his face and the way he kept his head down were any indication.
"Who is it?" John frowned at him.
“Yes." John leaned over and kissed him again, and soon they had their hands on each other, pulling off shirts and vests. John ran his fingers over the bullet wound on Sherlock's chest, and Sherlock probed at the one on John's shoulder, and neither of them said any more about it.
"Most two-and-a-half-year-olds sound like that, Mummy." He made no move to join Rosie inside the box.
Sherlock complied, and when he was done John wiped at his own mouth. "You're a bit sticky from that apple."
John tuned out Sherlock's nervous chatter so he could watch Eurus. A contraction. She was definitely not faking it. His nerves unclenched a bit as he watched her grit her way through the pain. Three minutes apart, Sherlock had said. She was close, then, most likely.
"A cure," Sherlock said softly. "You're waiting for a cure."
"But you've changed your look since she started working with you more. You've grown your hair out, started to style it differently. As if you want to impress someone."
Sherlock stared at him. "You hate it when I try to do that for you."
John shone the phone's light on him, trying not to laugh. "His hair is a bit monstrous, but I think he's pretty harmless."
"She's 24, Sherlock. Not too young. That's actually an ideal age for childbirth. It was much riskier for Mary at her age."
"No, it's fine. I like it," John admitted. He always had liked cold things—sometimes he'd put Mary's dildo in the fridge, back before everything in their relationship had gone to hell. "Keep going, if you don't mind."
" Thanks, Sherlock... That's... nice of you...", John said, little dumbfounded. He couldn't recognise his best friend, the cold High Functioning Sociopath... What happened to him?
Detective raised a black eyebrow. " Isn't that obvious? I had a nightmare, it's nothing extraordinary..." Sherlock answered nonchalantly, trying to sound as if nothing happened. Although is eyes sharpened, all emotions were gone.
The psychosomatic limp started to come back in his right leg and made his already bad days even more gloomy. He had lost all his interests, there was no fun without the crazy but good detective. Everything he did, everywhere he went, reminded him of his friend so much! John had to move out from Baker Street, he wasn't capable of living in the empty flat, where everything in there screamed 'Sherlock is dead' at him.
" I'm sorry, John..."
" No..." Sherlock blinked, realising how his previous words must have sounded like.
" I should be the one who should thank you. You saved me, you don't even know how many times... How did you make it? I mean, how did you manage to go through...this?" The doctor asked. He knew that a lot of people had gone insane because of being tortured.
Sherlock's breath was growing faster and faster, it was dangerously close to the hyperventilation. He was sweating, the drops of sweat wet his forehead, but his lips felt dry.
" Hey, don't Jawn me, you know it's not working on me... Yesterday you crawled into the flat on all fours, just in case you've already forgotten about that..." He remarked ironically.
" I see that your brain has frozen too, you're awfully slow today... I'm trying to say that I care about you! I know you think I'm just a manipulative bastard, but I hate to see you suffer so much, you silly boy!"
What was going on with him? He wasn't gay, he had never been interested in men before! Why did he feel this way then? Did it mean that - Well, even if it did, there was one significant detail. When they first met, Sherlock made himself very clear that he's not looking for a relationship, that he's married to his Work. And what was he, a sidekick and friend against Sherlock's
" I'll be there in a minute... " Mycroft said, quickly hung up. His little brother needed him.
His shocked and angry mask melted from his face at the sight of the tired detective.
And then the doctor's phone rang.
Turning around, he found his friend standing in the doorframe, leaning against it nonchalantly, wearing black sweatpants and grey short-sleeved t-shirt. The doctor didn't have to be genius to see what a pretence it was and how much effort it had to cost him to leave his room.
About the half an hour later the detective stumbled into the 221B flat on the Baker Street loaded down with two full plastic bags and headed to the kitchen to put them on the counter top.
Beep...
John folded his hands on his hips and his normally calm voice raised in irritation at Sherlock's behaviour.
" Oh no..." Okay, maybe he would...
One little date! Did he ask too much?
The doctor reached his hand to the pocket of his jeans and took off his phone.
Sherlock nodded shyly. " I just wanted you to be happy."
Sherlock's cheeks gained even darker shade of red and he lowered his gaze as he peeked at his friend from underneath his long dense lashes. " Sort of..." He blurted.
John turned his head and was a bit surprised to hear his friend beg. But on the other hand, the detective needed support in these days and the fact he pleaded for it made that need even bigger.
He couldn't fool his older brother, at first sight, it was obvious that he's been attacked, but they had no time for an argument. The priority was to warm Sherlock up, his soaked clothes must have been terribly cold and he was chilled to the bone without a doubt. The last thing they needed was catching pneumonia.
He wished he could forget again.
He put Sherlock's favourite mug back and made himself a really strong coffee. He desperately needed it today.
His violet lips were ajar, he breathed through them rapidly. His breath shook wildly, it sounded too fast and too shallow for normal respiration. It didn't show any signs of calming down, it grew even faster if possible...
Sherlock took another gulp of black drink and then put it next to the plate with breakfast John has brought.
A flicker of horror ran through Sherlock's eyes, but just for a second, a moment later his facial features hardened with anger.
To : JOHN
Hope you like it!
The detective was laying in John's bed, curled into the ball. He was clasping something in his embrace, like clenching in it for a dear life. John took a better look at him. It was some dark blue stuff with red stripe and little white spots. ' Oh, God ... It's my Christmas jumper...' John realised.
" Well, it seems that you're in the gutter when you're crying over old jumper!" The detective noted.
" Yeah, he's insufferable, sometimes. Especially when he stores body parts in the fridge..."
Sherlock gritted his teeth tightly and the tremor in his body increased. He seemed to be in such discomfort with telling John about today's event. John really didn't want to push him into something the detective didn't want to but the trembling man gave him no choice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock sighed and began to unbutton his purple tight shirt, which clung to his lean torso even more than usual. He wasn't very successful, his hands trembled so much he wasn't able to unfasten his top.
Can you get a milk? We ran out - SH
John asked but cursed himself immediately. Who talks about the work on the date? The truth was that the doctor was a little nervous, which really surprised him. He has always been a sassy, quick-witted man, a soldier on top of that... But how was it possible that he could talk with Sherlock about everything, even about the merest crap?
He was caught by surprise when he found a pile of clothes in front of the bathroom.
Sherlock curled more into himself, but it was making it even worse. " I-I ca-can't! Hu-hurts!" He whined through his tightened throat.
Beep.
The pale man widened his eyes at him, it was serious. He had to speak with him like that and thought that he was still with him. " E-e-every day?" He was so upset about his friend that he wasn't even embarrassed about his voice.
The only other reason Sherlock could think of was a Hippocratic Oath - John was a doctor and his pride didn't allow him to treat his patient badly.
The soldier curled his lips into the sneer. " You're a Consulting Detective, the only one in the world... What do you think?" He tilted his head at him.
" Well, I gotta go, will you both be OK?"
What do you think? Don't you find it too crazy? Should I continue?
The doctor folded his muscular arms on his chest. " Because it sounds like that! And since you're so interested, I'm not feeling well today..." He snapped.
Anderson perfectly succeeded this time and he had gotten what he deserved. Sherlock felt a deep satisfaction when he watched him curse and press his hands to his bleeding face.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wanted to poke his eyes out so he wouldn't be able to see how horrible he had become!
The detective bent down beside the victim, pressed his hands together and laid his chin on his fingertips - connecting both brain hemispheres helped him to concentrate much more.
John blinked several times, sure he misheard the answer. " What?" It wasn't possible, was it? He was Sherlock Holmes, he has always gotten the criminal to the jail... Something wrong must have happened...
" I see... And that's why you have blood all over your face and you can't stand still, right?" Mycroft remarked sarcastically and wrapped brother's arm around his neck to give him some stability. He saw how much energy and effort it has cost him to hold his body upright, he won't let him fall just because of his stubbornness!
Sherlock bowed down his head and felt a sting of guilt for the way he treated him. Even despite all the teasing and sometimes very ugly remarks Mycroft still cared about him and fixed his mistakes - the detective couldn't understand what he had ever done to deserve such a patient sibling.
Beep.
The doctor nodded. " Yeah, Greg texted last night, he wants to talk about Mary..." He said and ran his hand through his hair, which was something John did when he was on the edge.
It was a complete huddle of bruises and another injuries he had ever seen. Nasty twisted scratches stretched along his torso, across his protruding spine, shoulder blades and ribs. Thin and thick scars entwined between huge dark purple stains, some of them began to fade and turn yellowish.
" Is something hurting you?" John asked and wrinkled his eyebrows.
He closed the door wildly, too resultantly they slammed with a loud bang. He tried to stop them as soon as he realised what he was doing, but it was too late to stop them from making the wham.
" Well, it's still the same - although they're not 'little'... They're brats..." Susan said, her voice hardened a bit at the end of the sentence.
He still saw hoards of food on the big wooden table that waited for him to eat it up, he still heard the cruel laughter and nasty insults of his tormentors, he still felt the mixed food pour through the big tube right down his gullet and cumulate inside his stomach, making it bloat nearly to the point of bursting!
John stripped his fluffy beige cable-knit jumper and pulled it over Sherlock's head." What awe you doing, Immot cold'- " Sherlock slurred through the knitted yarn.
After a few seconds detective nodded shyly, almost hesitantly. He trusted his brother, but he felt so ashamed in front of such an intelligent man. He always had respect for him, although sometimes it didn't seem like that. So he remained silent since yesterday he refused to say a word. He turned his back on him.
" Oh come here..." The doctor grabbed the black sweatshirt Sherlock wore, pulled him to himself and smashed his mouth against detective's. His right hand ran into his soft curls and he continued to stroke his cheek with the other one.
The detective nodded shakily. "So I borrowed your jumper. It helps me to forget about unkind words. I had some work in the lab and it slipped out of my mind I was still wearing it. And that acid I was working with... my tube cracked and I burnt myself... John, I'm sorry for your jumper - "
" You can sleep now, ..." John murmured, as he to stroked his hair. " Don't worry, I won't let anybody to hurt you ... " He reached out for a blanket and threw it around Sherlock who already fell asleep. John smiled at him, he looked so young. He pressed a light kiss on Sherlock's forehead and fell asleep with detective's head on his thighs.
John couldn't help but he had to embrace him again, he felt Sherlock needed to comfort. " I don't mind, you little idiot..." He mumbled and cradled them back and forth, like a small kid. " Will you tell me what's going on with you?" John asked he didn't want to force him to do something he didn't want to.
And he never forgot to point out that Mycroft had gained weight - the teasing about his diets was a daily occurrence...
"I don't get it! You proved that cousin guilty of murder by his trouser leg?"
One lonely tear escaped Sherlock's eye. " Th-Thank y-you Jo-John..." He whispered. He was so grateful to his blogger. He grabbed his hands into his and looked into the ex-soldier's face.
He sat in the foetal position, he looked like he tried to shield himself from something
He felt so guilty, but at least it wasn't anything life-threatening, it just made John really really nauseous. 'Well, just...' he thought sarcastically.
Take your time, just answer me, please. Just let me know if you're okay.
Sherlock groaned again and his arms wrapped tightly around his round belly and squeezed it with a pained whimper.
The detective continued to wriggle and bit his lower lip to prevent himself from screaming, his bed creaking a bit under his weight. Hot tears run down his soft cheeks and the doctor could almost hear his heart pound inside his chest.
John would be lying if he said that he wasn't shaken by the way his friend looked now. He almost didn't recognise him at first, only his luxuriant black hair disclosed who the man in front of him was.
Sherlock took care of the car, you would be surprised, but he knew how to drive. Although the passengers were a bit nervous about it, after all, the detective was an unpredictable man, you never knew what he was about to do...
Sherlock's torso looked incredibly thin and pale as if nobody cared of him. Unfortunately, that was a truth, the detective refused to eat and also sleep during the cases. Which was often... John swore himself that he'll take better care about this ridiculous man.
John gritted his jaw tightly and did his best to not grate his teeth. He was even more annoying and rude than ever. But after all, it was Sherlock Holmes - unpredictable arsehole... He reminded him of the spoiled kid, who are demanding for attention - but only because someone else was talking to him. He suggested that if he sat at home, Sherlock wouldn't even register he's in the flat.
Sherlock opened his tired eyes and blinked several times to get used to the light. His vision was blurry and his eyes were sore. He had to knead them a bit so he could see properly. His head was pulsating with pain and his teeth were killing him - he had to visit the dentist very soon. He was sure he had several cavities, on his journey, he couldn't care about the hygiene. The spies could be found in every corner, they were looking for him.
Were they still at Scotland Yard? What could Greg and John discuss? John said he would return soon, what was taking him so long? Maybe they went for a pint?
He tried to move, but his legs tingled, he felt all stiff and he just wanted to sleep.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose in disgust when he realised how pathetic he must look right now, bending on the floor and sniffing his former flatmate's jumper like some dumped puppy...
Sherlock sprang up in the sitting position and pulled away from John, his face crumpled with hurt. " Is this... s-some kind of joke?" He hated the stutter, but he could not help himself.
Unfortunately, genius' company seemed to call attention to his friend, especially from the side of his enemies. And they didn't even hesitate to use his weakness against him. However, it was hackneyed method, Sherlock would really appreciate if they could just settle their accounts with him and let John be...
" I think it can wait... If that's what you want... "
John's face reddened which looked quite terrifying on his pale skin and his nostrils flared in anger.
A little moan escaped Sherlock's lips as he laid down on his stomach. He folded his arms under his face and put his chin on backs of his hands. Then he realised something. " Jo-John?" He wasn't asking with a full sentence, it was exhausting him even more.
"Never!"
John couldn't stand seeing his friend like that. He began to get up and ran his hand through Sherlock's wet hair. " Hold on..." He told him and rose up on his feet.
And then the army doctor grinned at him. " I think we have found a cure for the fear..." He purred and pressed his lips to Sherlock's.
The black-haired man gathered his power, propped on his elbows and somehow managed to shake her off. He clambered up on his feet again and almost prayed for her to let him go.
His heart clenched at the sight of the ever-stoic man, whose brain has always been more important than his heart, lose control over his well-guarded feelings.
" But if you'll keep your mouth shut, then you'll have nothing to worry about..." The blonde said, rose up on her feet and dusted her trousers. " Well, that's all for now... It was great to see you again, Sherly!"
As soon as the ice pack touched his pale skin, the pain withdrew, driven away by the sudden coolness. He let out a sigh of relief and closed his eyes, enjoying the moment of the painlessness.
Why would she go after him? He never did anything bad to her, why did she target him? Then something occurred to him. What if he was an intermediary and she used him to get Sherlock? Only that thought was giving him chills, he would never let anybody hurt his Sherlock. He felt incredibly protective about the detective and he would bite off a head of anybody who would lay his hands on him again!
" I hope you haven't contaminated the crime scene. I don't want to have all clues stained with grease..." He used the same tone as the detective and chuckled at his own joke, together with the two forensics.
After some other several minutes Sherlock rose up from the ground and also helped his friend on his feet. " Well... I'll leave you there so you can take a shower if you want..."
John continued to stare at him. When he met with Susan and the couple headed to the restaurant, it rained. And the thunderstorm began just a while later. Which meant that Sherlock was terrified the whole time he was gone... The voice in the phone sounded scared, now he was able to distinguish the tone.
He was about to search the kitchen and other parts of the flat when the silent whisper alerted him he wasn't alone in the room.
As soon as he said that, another bolt with thunder emphasised his words and the detective gritted his teeth to prevent the scream which threatened to come.
" Come on! You've always been my proper brother and you always will be..." Then he shook his head and made a sour face as if he had swallowed a lemon.
John let out a deep breath and nodded, oblivious to the fact that the detective could not see it. " Whatever you say... I just wanted you to know that I would be glad if you kept me a company... Well, if you need me, I'll be in my room..." Taking a last concerned glance at the door, the army doctor headed to his room on the first floor, giving Sherlock some space to get used to the situation.
Some medication could cause a weight gain, but the detective didn't seem to have any symptoms of diseases which required that type of pills.
Now, John was staring at his best friend with arms across his chest, his left eyebrow raised, eyes sparkling with the amusement in the weak light of the torch. His thin lips were curled in a sneer.
Sherlock's crippled back was a mess! It was covered with an uncountable amount of scratches, welts, wounds and dark violet. There almost wasn't a spot without any injuries. Some of them were inflamed and some even infected.
As Sherlock talked, he saw it all again. All those horrible memories attacked his mind. " They caught me, imprisoned me and kept interrogating me for so long two months! I refused to talk to them. When they lost their patience, they became... violent. They wanted to know about... They knew about my pressure point... And they used it. "
" What are you scared of?" He asked, worried about him.
John was already used to Sherlock's sulking moods, but this was different, it seemed almost like Sherlock was scared of him...
Sherlock's narrow shoulders shrugged. " It's boring. I don't shop until it's an absolute necessity..."
John frowned and his eyebrows furrowed in worry. " What happened? Why are you wet as a drowned rat?"
John rolled his eyes, wondering how come this perfect man could be so brilliant and so dumb at the same time.
Then he remembered the glass resting on the bed table, took it in his fingers and reached out his arm towards his friend.
While the soldier fought with his own body again, Sherlock stood there like a pillar, unsure of what to say or do to help his flatmate.
It wasn't, he was back in Baker Street, at home, in his bedroom with familiar green walls and a periodic table of contents, surrounded by his stuff, alive!

To : JOHN
" Thanks." Holmes said abruptly and to his own surprise he really meant it. He would never expect Sally Donovan to defend him from bullies when about two years ago she was one of them.
Another shriek flew out of his mouth as he unfolded his arms widely. He kept screaming and shivers trembled his skinny figure, but he looked so still...
" Thanks to you, my life is a living hell!" John waved his hands furiously as he yelped.
Also, an appointment with dentist would be a good idea, his teeth weren't in a good condition, it was just a matter of time before it starts to cause trouble. His nastily scarred back was treated, but if would need a new bandage in a few days. Fortunately (and almost by a miracle) there were no internal problems, except for his stomach which was distended in a very aggressive way and would hinder detective's efforts to lose weight.
Sherlock jerked when the cold towel met his hot skin, he felt cold even despite the heat his body produced. For the first time in his life, he didn't complain when John handed him the pill and the glass of water and obediently swallowed it.
Sherlock tried to protest, but this time he gave up quickly. He let himself be led through the flat, trusting John with all his heart. He felt so safe with John's strong, muscular arm around him, he knew that he would cover his back no matter what. Sure, he felt really self-conscious about his figure, especially when the soldier stood so close, not to mention held him... But he was too exhausted to do something about it right now.
