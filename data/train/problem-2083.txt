Halfway up the main stair case something draws John's attention momentarily to the door hidden in the wall. For a flash Sherlock meets John's gaze and quickly disappears behind the panel.
John’s heart leapt as he crosses into the adjoining room, hands clasped behind his back. The air in the room is warm and thick, the summer heat having come upon the land at last. Sherlock stands at the open window breathing in the breeze as it moves by, rustling his curls.
Rosie reaches out across the space between the sofa and the coffee table to touch the cat again and gives a pitiful whine when she can’t reach.
John doesn’t remember leaving the room. He only remembers the resolve that solidifies in him as he made his way back to his own apartment where he establishes himself in front of the fire to ignore his cup of tea.
I've been going over my outline, what little i have, and i have a much better idea what I'm doing with this story now. i'm looking forward to writing the rest.
“Your highness,” Mrs. Hudson coos as she steps into the room, “I had forgotten to ask if you wanted me to—”
Carefully he opens the latch and lifts the lid. He is a little startled by a small something that falls out of a panel hidden in the lid. Sherlock picks up the something which turns out to be a frame in which a portrait has been fixed.
I have no excuses for how long this chapter took. Life got busy and then i had an annoyingly long depressive episode, that still hasn't really passed, that kept me from doing basically everything. I'm still going to finish this thing, so don't worry. i am still committed to this story!
“My dear Sherlock,” he murmurs in a voice meant only for the two of them, “in mere moment you will be all mine, eternally.”
“Perhaps, but they will be crying for vengeance once I tell them of how the southern king tortured their prince for weeks, refusing to relent until I agreed to his demands.”
He is itching for something to occupy his mind. He thinks a visit to the library might offer something in the way of distraction, but he cannot seem to make his legs move. His body feels heavy and lifeless, he feels lifeless.
“And how many of those habits were formed simply to deal with the pain?” John asks bluntly, and Sherlock tenses. “Believe me, I am no stranger to self-destructive coping mechanisms.”
The creamy suit frames his angles in a way that makes him stand up a little straighter and hold his head a little higher. He is every bit the proud prince and he only wishes he could have looked this splendid when he married John in the orchard.
“Well,” Liz give him a little smile and backs out of the office, “I’ll see you tomorrow. Or, whenever…”
John pulls Styrofoam containers from the delivery box and peeks inside to inspect the contents before placing them on their respective sides of the table.
Minutes pass in silence, and the tension begins to ease from John’s shoulders. Sherlock breathes him in, the scent of tea and wool fogging— consuming— his senses. He draws in a sharp gasp when he feels soft lips press against his neck.
They sink to their knees as the justice instructs the room to bow their heads in prayer with him. In the silence that follows Sherlock considers if it was all really worth it. Was it worth the pain of separation from his John only to inevitably fall back into the clutches of Moriarty and his brother? Was it worth the increased threat to the south? Was it worth the many nights to come when he will lie in Moriarty’s bed trying desperately to convince himself its John's hands on him?
Sherlock’s eyes shine with tears, his voice breaking. John can no longer resist, he pulls Sherlock into his arms and presses firm kissed into his hair.
Sherlock chewed his lip trying not to jump to conclusions. He paced back and forth across his room, running his fingers through his hair. What if he had been too forward, what is he’d presumed too much? What if his confession had simply frightened John away? And he would be rejected, if gently so, upon the king’s return.
I have had so much fun writing this, and your comments have been such a source of joy for me. Thank you all so much.
“John,” Sherlock says as gently as he knows how, “you are the king, your life is far too valuable to risk in an unwinnable battle.”
“I’ve not forgotten,” John replies in a way that says he understands Sherlock's inexperience and subsequent timidity, and that he would never dare betray the trust placed in him.
As the chamber doors close, Sherlock fights the urge to spew questions and accusations, instead choosing to curse himself for not being more careful and allowing that woman to see him, especially when he had been sitting so comfortably within John's proximity— she must have noticed.
He waits at the threshold as Mrs. Hudson steps in to announce him, “The king is come, your highness,” before curtseying again and sweeping away to tend to the rest of the world.
Mycroft finds a place to stand in the middle of the ornate rug, hands held over the cane grip. He waits there, chin raised, face blank. Clearly the only way to get this over with will be to give his brother what he wants. So Sherlock rises.
He grunted in thought as he decided he couldn’t think without a much needed a drink. His mouth was dry and he felt very odd. As he struggled to stand, he tried to remember why his body was so sore.
He thought as he twitched his ears, listening to the sounds of the forest. He sniffed the air, smelling so many different things at once. Watson climbed out from underneath the bush, and decided to try out his new body. He sniffed the ground, the trees, anything he saw just because he could. He put his head to the wind, and felt like he could taste all the smells on the cool air.
“You know there was quite a fuss when it was discovered that the prince had vanished. There were rumors that he’d been abducted or killed. The king pronounced him dead less than a week later, it was rather odd.”
They eat and talk about nothing, feeding each other the odd bite of this or that just for the sake of having their fingers in the others mouth. When they’ve finished with the food, John pulls Sherlock back against the cushions, and Sherlock is so in love he doesn’t know what to do with himself.
Sherlock shoves his way passed the kings guard barring his way, sinking his teeth into one’s shoulder when they will not let him though.
“I, John Hamish Watson,” he begins, and Sherlock is dizzy, “take you, William Sherlock Scot Holmes, to be my husband, my partner, my love. I vow to,
Sherlock gives a sardonic laugh, “There was never any fear of that. As I said, I’ve always been too preoccupied with myself and finding meaningless pleasure wherever I could to care much about affairs of state.”
Feeling his confidence return by inches, John places a hand on the small of Sherlock’s back. He turns a little face John, his eyes clear but apprehensive.
This is actually the scene that inspired this story. It turned out very different then how I first pictured it.
“That sounds wonderful,” Sherlock murmurs, and John is surprised to see his features have settled into something wistful and a little sad. “Our mother insisted Mycroft and I learn to play. I excelled, of course. It was the only occasion she ever seemed to find to praise me. So I dedicated myself to music in hopes of winning her approval.”
Their progress up the aisle is slow, deliberate, each step taken in time with music that Sherlock doesn’t hear. His eyes flit around the room, he recognizes many of the people who watch him so intently. Their faces are blank, and Sherlock realizes that not a single one of these people feels even a bit of affection for him. They will not weep with joy to see him wed, nor will they regret the long years Sherlock must spend bound to a man who has no love for him.
“Apparently, James Moriarty was desperate to find Sherlock and secure his place in the line of succession, and Mary was sent to us in hopes of finding some evidence tying us to Sherlock's disappearance, so at least Moriarty would have something to offer Mycroft to remain in his good graces while he continued his search. She never expected to find the man himself.”
He stepped forward, head high as the line of northern troops parted to reveal the carriage that waited behind them. As he crossed the space between the heaven he’d hidden in and the hell that awaited, he resolutely did not look back.
As the days wore on, groups of soldiers had fractured away from the party until only a small company remained. Sebastian Moran still leading the way. Sherlock suspected this war criminal would receive some reward for bringing the wayward prince home.
A rush unlike anything Sherlock has ever known floods through him, filling his trembling frame with warmth and a strange sense of triumph. But in an instant that pleasure turns to panic and Sherlock stops breathing.
Mycroft’s attention is distracted by something and Sherlock is momentarily relieved until he feels cool fingers slip under the collar of her shirt. He moves to pull away but refrains, knowing if he does, Mycroft’s finger would snap the strand of silver beads through which its hooked.
“He did. At first I was quite taken with him, he was charming and thoughtful. But it didn’t last. I pleaded with my brother to call off the marriage, but he refused. He sent me away as punishment for my selfishness, and it was from my exile that I escaped and found my way to you.”
“I didn’t know,” Sherlock says quietly, “that is, I knew my brother has a tight grip on this place, but I had no idea your people were having difficulty feeding themselves.”
He felt a bit less awkward speaking to her since learning about her life as nobility, he did not stop to ponder the implications of that. How to explain?
John huffs a laugh, even as— Sherlock observes— he debates with himself about whether or not to have Sherlock locked up for spying.
habits. Sherlock would often dream of his fiancé— with whom he grew more enamored each passing day— crashing through the heavy castle doors to rescue him from the hell that was his life.
It takes Sherlock a full minute of desperate kissing to realize that he is crying. John soothes him and pulls Sherlock up to kneel in front of him. He wipes the tears from Sherlock's face and takes his hands. And Sherlock feels his stomach knot up.
Sherlock's fingers flex on the door latch as he waits impatiently for Mary to exit John's chamber before entering.
Carefully, Sherlock unwraps the fingers protecting his wounded arm and presents his hand to John. The king takes Sherlock’s long, boney hand in his smaller, callused ones and tenderly runs his fingers over the inflamed joint. He applies the barest pressure to the swelling, and Sherlock stifles a hiss.
Sherlock's blood turns to ice in his veins, breath coming in shallow gasps, heart pounding as his mind races.
He steps up onto the low stool before the long mirror and lets his dressing gown slips from his boney shoulders and pool at his feet. The woman, old enough to be his grandmother with a weathered but kind face, gathers the discarded article before offering him a trouser leg to slide his foot into.
“Yes, you,” John replied with a little smile. “I’ve been corresponding with them for some months, and they’ve been reluctant to work with me thus far. They have resources we need now that Mycroft has cut off the last of our trade routes, but I need this to go smoothly. Will you help me?”
“Hush, sweetheart,” John coos, peppering kisses up and down Sherlock's thighs, “it’s alright, I’ve got you, relax. I’ll make it good for you, I promise, but I need for you to relax.”
Sherlock does not respond, just turns on his heel and marches out of the flat. He needed to get home anyway, it was his turn to watch Rosie in the morning when John left for work, and it would help if he could get a bit of sleep before then.
“No, I don’t think so. She’s attractive, sure, and absolutely hilarious, but I don’t feel that way about her.”
They stand as if in sync and Sherlock offers his hand to take John's mug for washing. John thanks him with a sheepish smile and Sherlock is grateful his skin rarely colors anymore.
At night when their procession made camp, Sherlock refused any food offered to him and he didn’t sleep. Instead he lay in his cot watching the roof of his tent ripple in the wind. The light of the fires outside cast the shadows of his guards long and dark across the grass floor of his fabric cell.
He couldn’t fathom where this forcefulness was coming from. The first and only other time he had been with John he had been down right timid, at least to his own perception. He had been reserved and self-conscious. It had been wonderful, but he had been so unsure. Now he felt no reservation, only longing and the need to ease the fear that lingered in him.
Sherlock crashes down on John with an intensity that surprises both of them, crushing his mouth to John’s with enough force to cause pain. John pulls him in and long fingers cup his head, holding him fast. Sherlock’s mouth opens for him and John’s grips tightens reflexively.
John gives a laugh that’s more breath than sound, “Not much. My sister did, though. She was brilliant…”
“No,” Sherlock croaks. His throat has constricted unbearably, trying to swallow blood he hasn’t even tasted yet.
“Come on, now,” he instructs, and Sherlock hauls himself into a sitting position, rubbing sleep from his eyes.
The sound that curls out of John is so horrible that Sherlock would have flinched away but he is no longer able to move.
John's voice vanquishes Sherlock's unease and he lets him in completely. It doesn’t take long before Sherlock is rocking back against John, meeting his thrusts and begging for more.
For a minute or so Sherlock listens to the housekeeper stack the neatly folded sheets into the cabinet. He hasn’t slept in his own bed once since the last time the linens were changed, there was really no need to wash them again.
Sherlock paused for a moment to take a breath and to question why he was bothering John with his meaningless troubles. He refused to admit a part of him just wanted John to reassure him, to tell him it was alright and that he was safe. What absolute nonsense. What absolute, childish nonsense. It wasn’t as though Sherlock could stay in the south forever anyway; he shrank from the thought.
“Do you ever sleep?” John asks with a chuckle as Sherlock takes a seat beside him. Sherlock knows that John is aware of the careful distance he leaves between them.
John sucks a hard kiss into the most sensitive part of Sherlock's inner thigh, making him sigh. He places the pad of his finger to Sherlock's entrance and begins to press, massaging to ease the muscle.
The king has gone on progress. Visiting townships and bases to offer what encourage he can to common people and soldiers across the territory. A necessary but spiteful tradition, yet one that John had seemed eager to perform.
After coming to John in the audience chamber, Sherlock had been led by the hand back to the king’s apartment where they had settled into armchairs in the sitting room. They drifted between easy conversations about nothing in particular and comfortable silence for hours, warmed by the little fire in the hearth and simply being near to each other. Neither had noticed the dawn approaching until pale light began peeking through the curtains.
Sherlock swallows hard and when he does he catches a scent and realizes he has arrived within feet of his destination. Across the street a man stands reclined against the grey brick wall of an alley. Sherlock's throat tightens and his lips pull back, tongue flicking over the point of his teeth. His breath scratches out in a low growl. He groans involuntarily as another cramp grips his insides— he needs to feed.
When John’s voice comes after a silence that seems to go on for hours, it is terrifyingly kind, “I’m sorry.”
John waits quietly, blood gone cold, watching Sherlock’s face intently as a darkness creeps across his ashen features.
Hands roam and clutch and mouths smear across sweat damp skin. They move and sigh and mend each other, and fall over the edge together, as one.
If there was anything at all Sherlock could do to lighten John’s heart in this moment--- and for as many moments after as John would allow— he would do it. He would find a way to catch the stars if this wonderful man so desired. Sherlock is certain he could, he feels he could do almost anything when he looks into John’s ocean eyes.
Moriarty steps forward clapping his hands together. “I know it’s supposed to be bad luck and all, but I just had to see you.”
There was a long silence before Greg spoke again. “We only captured three of the men connected to the assination, all of them confessed that the timing of the attack had been planned around the entire family being present at the manor. Yes, John was meant to be here, he still bares that guilt. I left immediately to find him. He was practically family, I’d known from the day he was born, I thought the news should come from me. When I arrived I was told that the prince— now the king— had been moved to a field hospital; he’d been shot.”
John says nothing, just pulls the sheet aside with a little smile and gestures Sherlock through. He is a little taken aback by what he finds on the other side.
They emerge from the trees onto the bank of the lake which is smooth as glass. Rather than stopping right there and dismounting, their horse continues plodding until they reached a small dock on the other side of the water.
He had stopped himself from going to Mrs. Hudson to inquire about the post, for fear that he just simply had not received a response. In the funny way she often did, the housekeeper appeared in his room just as he was thinking of her; the woman’s timing was becoming a bit unsettling now.
“Be careful,” John says reproachfully, gently prying Sherlock’s fingers from his shirt, “you’ll hurt yourself.”
John continues to talk to Sherlock as he examines him, not saying anything in particular. Sherlock is content to listen to the sound of his voice and doze lightly until the door opens and a man with greying hair steps through.
Sherlock watches Irene Adler cautiously as she leaves the room, giving him a nod rather than a more formal gesture.
John sits slumped in his arm chair, staring absently into the fire, his tea gone cold. He leans forward with his elbows on his knees, his hands twisting absently. Midday has not yet arrived, yet he can already feel weariness creeping up on him.
Of course John knows that eventually he must marry, or produce an heir at the very least. But on nights like these, when everything feels so hopeless, he wonders if it’s even worth the effort. Why not just surrender the south to that fucker in the north and give in?
“He took to striking me in front of others. At least my father cared enough for appearances to drag me into another room, Mycroft had no such compunctions. He would lash out wherever whenever, and it only got worse after our parents died.”
“And when you return,” James continues, massaging his fourth finger, “I will put a ring right here, and you will be mine.”
Sherlock feels the realization hit him with shocking force. This man was indeed his Jim, or the man his Jim had become.
Greg swallowed hard, “God, how he cried. Screaming with everything he had, as if trying to wake himself from a horrible dream. He trashed so violently he tore his wound open. When he finally calmed, council members came in to announce to him officially that he was now reigning king. I can still here the way they chorused
Holmes was getting more and more anxious as the day went on. It was nearly three in the afternoon, and these countrymen fools hadn’t been able to prove any sign of the beast.
The gangly, grizzled beast stalked over to the shaking body of John Watson. It quite resembled an unusually large wolf, with dark brown eyes. His body was tall and lanky, with a slim build standing just above the height of a man. His fur was a dark gray, tinged with black on the tips, and multiple patches missing all over it’s midsection. The creature seemed to enjoy watching the scared man tremble in fear at his very presence, taking its time stalking around his prey. The beasts’ nose twitched, breathing in the scent of his victim. With one final snarl, he jumped towards Watson, and sunk his sharp teeth into the man’s right shoulder.
Holmes stood and stalked out of the room. Watson stretched, yawned, and laid back on his bed. He couldn’t help but feel uneasy about the past few days. He closed his eyes and inhaled a deep breath through his nose. All the smells of his room hit his nose, he could even still smell Holmes’s sweet aroma.
Holmes thought as he walked on. He occasionally glanced at Watson and as they neared the park, noticed Watson seemed irritated. His eyes darted around, glancing at the people pushing past him. Watson wasn’t usually so uneasy in large crowds, he generally followed Holmes right at his side. Holmes thought his behavior was odd, and decided to try something. As if he hadn’t irritated Watson enough already, Holmes suddenly stopped and felt Watson bump into his back. “Holmes!” He exclaimed. “Why on Earth…” Watson grumbled. He glanced at Holmes, but his attention didn’t stay on him for more than a few moments. Watson had an anxious air to him. “Watson, something is troubling you. What is it?” Holmes asked. Watson didn’t answer. Holmes grabbed his arm, “Watson?” The doctors breathing had elevated slightly, and he turned to Holmes. “I’m not sure, Holmes. I…I think I need to rest.” He said with a furrowed brow. The detective frowned, “Are you still upset with me, Watson? If you want an apolog-” He was interrupted by hushed growl from Watson. “The flat, Holmes. Please.” Holmes, stunned from the desperate tone in Watson’s voice, led him back to the flat in silence. Holmes noticed the doctor leaned on his shoulder more and more each step. The pair made it back to the flat, and Holmes practically carried the man through the door. As Watson stumbled up the stairs like a drunk, Mrs. Hudson popped her head out from her flat. “Is he alright, Holmes?” Holmes rolled his eyes, he didn’t need his landlady distracting him. “Not now, Mrs. Hudson. Leave us be!” He yelled down the stairs. She cursed quietly and shut her door. Watson shed his coat and hat, not bothering to hang them in their proper place. He fell to the sofa, and curled into a fetal position. He arms hugged his knees tight against his chest. “Watson, what is ailing you my dear friend?” Holmes asked. He knelt by his partner, a hand on his shoulder. Watson’s body shuddered at his touch, and his eyes were closed tightly. “Please, just leave me be for a moment.” Watson whispered. Holmes slowly stood and moved to his chair across the room. He sat down and waited.
Watson tried to tell himself, but the overwhelming distractions were too much. He felt very on edge, and a peculiar sensation began prickling under his skin.
He thought with distaste. Watson was busy staring at his reflection when he heard a twig nap in the distance. He whipped his head up, suddenly frightened.
With another deep breath, Watson sat up and looked at his paws. He lifted the left foot, wiggled his toes and flexed his claws. He set his paw down and looked over his shoulder. His body as the creature very much resembled his human attributes; dark brown hair, tall limbs, and a long torso.
Watson screamed in his mind. Holmes then laid his hand on Watson’s flank, and he couldn’t help but sigh with a small amount of relief. At least Holmes wasn’t afraid of him as the beast. Suddenly Watson felt an agonizing pain all over his body. He couldn’t help but yelp as his bones and insides rearranged themselves, stretching and shrinking. His joints popped, and muscles rippled as they moved slowly back into the form of a human. Watson’s animalistic whines gurgled into human groans. Just as suddenly as it happened, the transformation was over. Watson laid on the ground shaking, his body covered in sweat, and his breaths jagged from pain. His body temperature was unnaturally high, this was made obvious by the steam rolling off his bare skin. Watson was barely conscious, seeing black spots in his vision. “Holmes…” he breathed out before he fell into unconsciousness.
He thought bitterly. Watson’s ear twitched and he picked up an odd sound. He turned his head towards the sound and listened. He heard the sound of hoofed animals, and voices.
Watson watched Holmes from his hiding spot. After twenty minutes of silence from him, Holmes turned to the other men and told them to set up camp. He declared he was going to stay out in the woods tonight, the second victim wasn’t dead, and he intended to find him. The eldest man started to argue, but Holmes was stuck on his decision. “You can stay out here tonight,” the man said, “But don’t expect us to come pick up the pieces tomorrow. That man is dead, and the beast is well alive.” The man tossed Holmes a small bag of supplies, and promptly turned his horse around to head back the way they came. The young boy also turned to leave. “I’ll stay with you Mr. Holmes. My name is Thomas. ” The thirty-something man said. “I’m going to kill that son of a bitch tonight, I won’t have anymore people die out here from a ruthless animal.” The other two left, leaving Holmes and Thomas to set up camp.
Watson thought as he left his eyes closed to enjoy the wonderful sounds of nature. His nose caught the smell of something he couldn’t quite put his finger on. He sniffed some more before he realized what he was doing.
He told himself as he slowly walked to the stream he could hear to his right. As he neared the running water, he hesitated, not sure he wanted to see his reflection looking back at him.
He thought as he hurried to catch up with Holmes. They didn't speak for a while. Watson, contrary to his statement about being normal, was focused on his abnormal senses. As they got closer to the park, more and more people crowded the streets. It was quite overwhelming, trying to sort through all the smells he was detecting. Each person he passed had a particular, individual scent. The street itself smelled of sewage, people, horses, and other things that weren’t describable. All the while, the sounds around him were just as consuming. People talking, laughing, and just the general sound of the street were beginning to distress him. Beads of sweat ran down his face, even with the chilly weather. J
Watson told himself. He didn’t like the panicked feeling the woods were giving him. He usually enjoyed his nightly walks, but the strange countryside was not peaceful at all. "Damn it Holmes, if only you were here." he whispered. Two days ago, a gentleman called upon Mr. Holmes’s help. His farm, and the tiny village that he lived in, were having many sighting of a “terrifying, heartless beast”. This creature has been slaughtering livestock and, until last month, had left the villagers alone. The bloodied body of an old drunken man was found in the ally behind the local pub, causing many to fear the creature was out for human blood. When examined by a doctor in town, he noted two deep cuts on his jugular, the cause of death; blood loss. Any man could have created those slashes. No sign of the “creature” had been seen since. But the family of the murdered man are certain it is still out there, certain it is in fact an animal, not a man using the livestock deaths as a clever cover for murder.
Holmes knew Watson was upset with him, his stark outburst made that evident. He was also giving him the silent treatment, which was odd since the doctor talked almost all the time.
He thought. “Sir, your needed at the Denvir Farm. They found something you might want to see.” The boy said. P
The cat gets lightly to its feet as John unlocks the door and its slips inside before John has even tucked his key back in his pocket.
John inhales deeply as he comes back to himself and rubs his eyes to clear them. In the quiet of the room he hears a sound that makes his heart leap.
He turns from Jim intending to flop onto his bed as though unconcerned, that quickly proves to be a mistake. He felt the decanter fly passed his ear before it smashed against the wall, shattering brilliantly.
Sherlock carefully extricates himself from John's arms and rises to sit beside his sleeping husband.
When he opens the door of the wash room steam wafts into his face, clinging to his curls. He undresses himself and slips quietly into the large copper bath. The hot water is a balm to his frigid skin, and he lets out a contented sigh as the tension begins to ease from his body.
Lord Moriarty steps forward with a quick stride, and Sherlock jerks back reflexively. With a derisive sniff, the man grips Sherlock's chin with a callused thumb and forces his face up.
“That isn’t— I don’t—” Sherlock makes a sound of frustration and slumps back down to the sofa, shutting his eyes tight. When he speaks again his voice is withdrawn, “I don’t know if I can, I don’t know how. I’ve never…”
“Well,” John concedes after a long pause, during which Sherlock’s heart bangs painfully against his ribs, “we can at least wait until he’s back on his feet.”
He writhes and kicks, trashing as hard as the pain ripping down his arm will allow. Moriarty’s fist clenches again but the blow never comes.
He pins Sherlock's right hand above his head and Sherlock holds onto John's wrist with his damaged hand. Bent over Sherlock so that their body came together John dips his fingers into the oil and takes them both in hand.
Sherlock is rougher than John has ever known him to be, scratching at his neck and pushing as close as he can get as though he is attempting to crawl inside John. But eventually he must pull away for air and John leans their foreheads together.
His words leave him as he takes in the stranger for the first time. Dark curls and icy cat’s eyes shining with health in the morning light. Sharp features and a long, elegant body covered in milky skin; he is breathtaking.
“Exactly, we are adults, and he is reigning king— he may do as he pleased. Whenever I step out of line,” Sherlock swallows hard and lets go of a shaky breath, “he brings me before his privy council and…”
“You were here when it happened,” Sherlock observed, and Greg’s posture straightened. He nodded grimly.
There is such passion and certainty in his voice that John is momentarily taken aback. But then a rush of need floods his body and he feels himself truly come alive for the first time in so long.
Perhaps that is why Sherlock does not at first realize that the figure that looms above him where he is sprawled in his bed his real
“Not at all, we’ve only lost a teacupl,” John says with a smile and reaches to collect the broken pieces.
“Your council has advised— no, begged— you every day since my arrival to evict me from not only this manor but the south, as soon as possible. It’s obvious you agree with them, but why? Though my arrival here was unexpected, I’ve not inconvenienced your household in any way, and I’ve done my very best to be respectful of your staff. Your guest wing is currently empty, so there is little chance of anyone discovering my presence here, and I am certainly not interested in being discovered.”
“Sherlock, before I found you I believed I would never know happiness again. And I was content with that— I was. But now,” he searches Sherlock's face and his eyes are so earnest, “now that I have you, I cannot bear the thought of letting you go.”
Thunder cracks and the sky lights up as Sherlock grabs the silk in his fists and rips it apart, tiny pearl disks scattering to the floor. John's answering growl makes heat pool in Sherlock's groin and he yanks down hard on John's collar so he can claim his mouth.
PS: Someone asked me recently if I hate Mycroft. Yes and no, he's one of those characters i love to hate. i think he fills the role of purely evil antagonist rather well, but i don't "hate" him ^^)
“Mike, Sarah,” John begins, his voice level but clearly unhappy, “I have made myself quite clear. I do not want to hear of this again. You are dismissed.”
Or at least as honest as its possible to be when two people have locked themselves away behind layers and layers of defenses in order to keep out the hurts of the world.
Sherlock feels the ice that had trickled down his spine thaw a little, and his eyes pricked. How did John do that? How could he possibly know just what to say even when he was so far away?
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, but words would not come as the horror of what his brother had planned began to dawn on him.
Sherlock realizes that he’s wandered further away from the guest wing than he initially thought when it takes less than a minute to come upon the origin of the voices, now much clearer with proximity. In another moment, he finds himself standing at one of the doors hidden in the wall panels, peering through the small window into a long, opulently decorated room. This was the grandest room Sherlock has seen in the manor, by far. The silk-covered walls are adorned with velvet hangings and paintings in ornate frames. One of which, a portrait hung beside a painting of a lush pasture, looks unnervingly like John. But the hair is a bit darker and the face bares deeper lines, and Sherlock decides the portrait must be of King David, John’s late father.
Sherlock seems to stop breathing for a moment before he slowly rotates to fit himself against John and lace his long fingers at the back of John’s neck. Its less of a dance, more a careful, synchronized swaying. John rocks and Sherlock moves with him, losing themselves in the music. Sherlock rests his head against John, and the king feels his every worry leave him. He had not been wrong; he had not misunderstood.
Instead he waited, spine straight and jaw clenched as Mrs. Hudson quickly swiped at her eyes, probably hoping he hadn’t seen, and carefully closed the door behind her.
Joh reaches his destination before he realizes. He hesitates before knocking but when he does he makes sure the sound is loud and confident.
When there are finally walls around him the ambient noise is dampened considerably, its disorienting. Sherlock fights the urge to be sick by attempting to take in his new surroundings. It’s dark at first, the air is thick and musty, they must be underground. Perhaps a cellar or servant’s entrance?
“I can see that I’ve made you uneasy.” She motions toward the bathing room, “There is a hot bath waiting for you. I’ll have your dinner brought up while you wash.”
“This is Mary Morstan, she works for southern intelligence. You needn't to worry, we can trust her. She is an old friend of mine.”
John's knuckles have turned white where he grips the arm of his chair, he makes a noise of confirmation.
Sherlock doesn’t look back over to the other man, but he knows there’s a look of incredulity on his lined face.
Next time: John leaves on a progress, and he and Sherlock exchange letters while he is away. Afterward, Sherlock confesses all that's in his heart.
Candlelight dances behind his eyelids and his breath comes in shallow gasps. Sherlock fancies he can feel the warmth of John against him. His back arches, his body coiled tight.
He thought.  Watson looked slightly disappointed, so Holmes decided to change the subject. He tapped the blanket where Watson’s torso was. “Let us change your bandages, shall we?” He said cheerfully. Watson moved his blankets aside and sat completely up. He looked down at his chest and torso, to see his whole upper body wrapped in bandages. As Holmes began unwrapping the bandages, Watson sat still in thought. “Are you in any pain, Watson?” Holmes asked as he worked. “No, not at all. I am sore, as if I had run a marathon. But not in pain.” He explained. With the last of the bandages off, Holmes examined the doctor’s wounds. “Hmm, interesting. Your wounds, even though they were very deep, have healed almost completely.” Holmes said. “Watson, those wounds should have been fatal.” Watson looked down at his chest and chuckled nervously. “I suppose you’re right Holmes, these wounds look to be weeks old, not days.” Holmes observed in silence, his ‘deducing’ face scrunched in deep thought. Without a word, Holmes began to re-wrap Watson’s chest. “What are you thinking, Holmes?” Watson asked. “Nothing important Watson. I suppose it is time for you to rest. I shall bring you some tea and perhaps, breakfast?” The doctor nodded in agreement.
Watson followed Holmes and the three other men though the woods, being careful to not be seen or heard. The horses knew he was there, they could smell him on the wind. Holmes seemed to also be very uneasy, casually glancing over his shoulder to scan the woods around him. Sometimes Watson swore Holmes was staring right at him crouching low in the brush.
He thought with glee. Watson turned his body to face the wind and just ran, his strides eating up the forest floor. He had never felt so free. Even in changed body, he felt at ease, like he had put on an old comfortable pair of shoes. Leaping over rocks and low branches, he ran faster and faster, pushing the limits of his new legs. Finally he stopped and stood panting, his breath hot. He sniffed the air again, and followed his nose to a creek, its water bubbling over rocks. Watson lowered his head and lapped up water until he felt he could vomit. Water had never tasted so refreshing. He looked up in the sky, and saw the sun was rising higher.
The dark brown fur retracted back into the skin, bones moved and reshaped themselves, and the shuddering form of the beast slowly changed into that of a man. Holmes watched the steam and sweat rolled off the transforming body. Even after the physical changes were done, the man still shook and breathed shallow, jagged breathes. Holmes hadn't realized he had been holding his breath, and exhaled sharply. He watched the man loose consciousness, and yet still couldn't move towards him. The man was his very own Dr. John Watson. His partner, and more importantly, his best friend. Holmes felt a flood of emotions; astonishment, worry, but above all, relief. Watson was not dead or gone forever, he was just
The evening air was cool and crisp, just as Watson liked it. He didn't tolerate the summer heat as well as others. "So Holmes, where have you been all day?" Watson asked as they briskly walked towards Hyde Park. Holmes did not answer at first. "I was doing some research." Watson frowned and glanced over at his friend. "Research on what? Did we get another case?" Holmes shook his head. "No new case. I was reading up on your... condition. No solid information, so I will have to gather my own." He stated cooly. Watson grabbed Holmes's sleeve and stopped abruptly. He gestured up and down his body with his free arm and glared at Holmes. "This...this is not a condition, Holmes. I am perfectly normal. Whatever happened to me in the country was..." He stopped for a moment, searching for the right words. "Well I don't know what it was, but I'm back to myself." Holmes didn't say anything, and continued walking. Watson inwardly growled in frustration and huffed out loud.
It was now dark, probably one in the morning. The fire had died down, but Holmes was still sitting by the coals for warmth. Thomas was asleep in the makeshift tent. Holmes was deep in thought, thinking of the most logical answer to what had happened in the meadow. He was drawn out of thought by a low, soft growl in the woods around him. Holmes reached for Watson’s revolver, and prodded Thomas awake. Thomas groaned and turned away from Holmes. “Get up you fool! There is something out there!” Holmes whispered harshly. Thomas rolled over on his side and rubbed his eyes. “Are you certain you heard someth-” He was cut off by rustling in the underbrush, no more than 20 yards away. Thomas scrambled up and grabbed his rifle, aiming in the direction of the noise. The two men didn’t hear or see anything else for a moment, but Holmes felt like he was being watched, being taunted by something. Thomas let out a shiver, his rifle quaking. He was terrified. Holmes took a step forward. “Come out now, or we’ll shoot. You aren’t fooling us, you coward.” There was no reply. Holmes lowered the revolver. Just at that moment, a large creature crashed through the brush to their right, knocking Thomas to the ground. Thomas let out a scream and fired a round from his rifle. The beast knocked the gun aside with a large paw, and bit down on the screaming man.  Holmes jumped to the side and nearly stumbled to the ground at the sight before him. A large, gray wolf had Thomas pinned to the ground, tearing apart his throat. Thomas’s blood was spraying everywhere, his carotid artery torn open by the creature’s large teeth. Once the man stopped moving, the beast turned it’s gaze towards Holmes. Holmes couldn’t move, he was paralyzed with fear. The wolf stalked towards him, his head low, a sinister set of teeth gleaming in the dark. Holmes closed his eyes, hoping his end was as quick as Thomas’s. Before the beast reached Holmes, a loud snarl rolled across the field. Holmes turned his head and watched as another large animal charged across the meadow, and promptly tackled the gray wolf. The two animals fought furiously, biting and tearing away at each others flesh. Holmes watched on in amazement, still unable to move. After what seemed like hours, but truly mere minutes, the darker wolf pinned the gray creature to the ground, his jaws clamped around its neck. The gray beast fought as hard as it could, clawing and snarling at it’s opponent. But the other wolf held firm, and finally the beast stopped struggling. The brown wolf bit down even harder and shook his head, snapping the neck of the now dead gray animal. The beast opened it’s large jaws and dropped the body of his opponent. The wolf’s tongue lolled out of it’s mouth, breath puffing out into the chilled air. It turned and looked at Holmes, and started to slowly limp towards him. His body was covered in deep scratches and teeth marks. Holmes noticed the wolf favored it’s back right leg, even though most of it’s injuries were on the front half of it’s body. Holmes scooted backwards, still afraid of his possible impending death, although deep down, he felt something was off. The beast wasn’t showing signs of aggression, no teeth baring, no growling. Holmes stopped backing away, and watched the wolf slowly approach. Once it got within a few feet, the wolf stumbled and fell onto it’s side. Holmes barely breathed, not wanting to make any sudden movement. The large wolf didn’t get up, and it laid on it’s side panting in apparent pain. It’s furry body shuddered. Holmes waited a few moments in silence, then slowly crawled forward. He got within inches of the beast, he admired the lethal predator’s features. He had a dark brown coat, with long limbs and tail. On his right shoulder, scar tissue spider-webbed into an oddly familiar shape. The wolf let out a quiet whine, now aware of Holmes’s presence. Holmes glanced at the large muzzle full of sharp teeth. He then looked into the creatures deep blue eyes, a feeling of unease tugging at his mind. He was no longer afraid of the wolf, but oddly comfortable. Holmes was drawn to the creature’s eyes, the calmness of them. He reached out a hand and stroked the wolf’s flank. The wolf let out a pained sigh, and closed it’s blue eyes. Holmes suddenly jumped back as the body of the large beast shook, whimpers of pain escaping the wolf’s mouth.
Mrs. Hudson meets him in the entry. “Majesty,” she greets with a smile, and gives as deep a curtsey as her hip would allow.
“It is clear to me,” Mycroft sneers, “that the stresses of court life have begun to take a toll on you. Perhaps some time to yourself at the marsh house will do you good; it’ll give you a chance to come to your senses before you are wed.”
John steps to a cupboard on the far wall and pulls from it a crystal decanter. “I feel I should explain myself,” he says sheepishly.
They pull apart with a wet noise and harsh gasps, John nuzzling his nose into Sherlock’s neck and kissing the line of his prominent clavicle. There is an intimacy in the gesture that startles Sherlock a little.
” he trails off with a sheepish little chuckle, “love you and keep you all the days of my life. And to cherish you, and tell you each and every day how blessed I am to have found you.”
He rises from the edge of the bed and stretches his sore body before stripping off his coat and boots and climbing into bed with his love for the last time.
“So I was wondering,” she begins, color rising in her cheeks, “if  you like to grab a coffee some time?”
This must have been what got John out of bed at an ungodly hour this morning, and Sherlock is slightly awed that he would go to all this trouble for him.
Sherlock feels hateful tears prick his eyes at the thought of a life spent as the husband of James Moriarty and he fears he may be sick. To be beaten is something to which he is accustomed, but the man’s eyes had held promises of a worse fate.
The following evening as Sherlock is hastily throwing his few essential belongings into his trunk, there is a knock at the door.
It was here that the tone of the letter seemed to change. The pen pressed just a little harder to the page.
John watches, transfixed, for just a moment before easing himself onto the mattress to kneel across Sherlock's thighs. John splays his hands across Sherlock's chest and runs them up his long neck to cup his face gently. Sherlock's fingers which had been twitching idly at his sides, find John's hips and dig in.
Sherlock cups his hand under John’s chin and pulls him down for a kiss. “Very well,” he breathes against his lips.
Sherlock barely has a moment to brace himself as he sees Moriarty’s arm pull back before the blow connects with his chin. Dazed, he doesn’t at first feel buttons of his bloodied shirt being torn away. But as he comes back to himself, mouth tasting of copper, something within Sherlock screams at him to fight; kick, scream, do anything he must to free himself.
There were signs, John can see that now. Little things here and there, almost as if Sherlock had been subtly trying to let him know.
Sherlock finds himself searching John’s face, though for what, he doesn’t know. “I will,” his answer comes out on a breath, “I will.”
John has been spending his every free hour with Sherlock, either lounging in their apartments or chatting about nothing in particular in the library, but always together. Sherlock is beginning to worry that John may grow tired of him before long if they do not have some time to themselves, but he is not inclined to initiate it.
Confusion and frustration play across Sherlock’s face and he bites down hard on his lip. John kneads Sherlock’s waist and smiles up at him with as much warmth as his twisting stomach will allow.
“Your fiancé pitched such a fit when he discovered that you’d disappeared. He swore that if he couldn’t have you he would tell his father our arrangement was off. That would have been inconvenient for me, Sherlock,” his voice is soft as though he were speaking to a child.
In the last chapter i promised i'd have this one up in a week, obviously that didn't happen. Long story short, after the last part went up someone in the family got very sick and has been since. My part in taking care of them and my other responsibilities have left me extremely busy and fan fiction just couldn't be a priority. Things have calmed down a little now, but i will not make you any more promises about when chapters will go up, its just cruel.
Sherlock sucks languidly on John's tongue, something he’d discovered John loved, and he finds the response of fingertips pressing hard into his back very gratifying.
They stare into each other’s eyes. Sherlock feels his resolve harden, a bravery he’d never known flaring white hot within him.
Sherlock melts into him, arms wrapping around John and holding tight, as though this wonderful man were the only thing keeping him tethered to the earth. He presses a hard, sucking kiss to John's neck and revels in the sound it elicits.
He sits at a small vanity table by the window, pulling carful fingers through freshly washed curls when the chamber door opens and James Moriarty strides in.
The morning following his confessions to John, Sherlock finds himself roaming the servant’s tunnels berating himself. How could he have been so foolish? Stupid man, he chided, he had let his emotions run away with his sense and had laid himself bare for this man he barely knew— in a way he’d never done before, and never wished to again. He felt exposed and ashamed, it had been years since he had cried in front of another person. The release of it hadn’t left him feeling lighter and more at ease, but rather, he felt raw.
“You run off without informing your big brother and come home bearing the trappings of a faith I outlawed years ago,” his tone is light now and almost sweet, it makes Sherlock's skin crawl. “Shall I have you executed for heresy as well as treason?”
It pained Sherlock to see John so defeated. This beautiful man shouldn’t have to carry yet another regret with him, his burden was heavy enough.
We just kept moving until we happened upon a half collapsed barn. Apparently the land used to belong to a noble family before the war, don’t know how I forgot that. We stowed away in that shack until we were finally found. We didn’t know if it would be wise to venture out in case those rouges were nearby, so we laid low.
He stands a good way from the rest of his hunting party, putting distance between himself and the noise of the other men. The only other soul present with him is his horse, who stands behind his shoulder, patiently waiting. John lets his head fall back against the animal’s neck, feeling the warmth of it's fur contrasted with the bite of the spring air.
Just as Sherlock is preparing to flee the parlor, even knowing he’d face his father’s wrath, a voice speaks up from behind Lord Moriarty; high and sweet.
“I did not appreciate your behavior at my sister’s funeral,” Moriarty’s voice is dangerously soft. “I expect better from my fiancé.”
It’s gone midnight before either of them says anything— anything that isn’t sweet nothings in the heat of love making.
Something hot and dangerous flared in his chest. He swallowed down the nervous lump in his throat, feeling like a love-sick fool.
John’s lips purse as he tries to find the right words. “It’s a bit like flattery, I suppose. If you’re only saying the words in hopes of gaining favor. You have to open your heart.”
Something crashes into Sherlock and he is shoved rather violently back against the wall, breath rushing from his lungs. Lips press against his mouth, warm and insistent. Sherlock barely registers what’s happening. He is kissing and kissing, and he feels firm hands dig into his hips and waist as his own hands come up to cup and caress.
“Thank you, thank you all,” says John's lovely voice, “but I think what my men and I need now is a good night’s rest.”
“They do this for the fun of it,” he bites out. “This woman doesn’t have any personal belongings with her because she was abducted and brought here. Check the lost and found at tube stations, you may find her things. She may have been headed home when she was taken. It rained earlier tonight but her shoes are relatively clean, so she probably didn’t walk her under her own steam, check traffic cameras and CCTV, maybe something will turn up.”
“Sherlock,” he says, voice hushed, “I enjoyed this,” he gestures at the table. “It was nice just to talk to you again.”
“I sent my baby brother away for some much needed rest, and that evil man stole you away. He tried to blackmail me into withdrawing my troops.”
“Hey,” John’ gentle whisper comes again, breaking through Sherlock’s rapidly tangling thoughts. “Stay with me.”
John pulls them down a narrow stone stairwell obscured by a column in the gallery. The light soon disappears and their air grows cold as they leave behind the light from the gallery windows the further they travel down the stairs.
What he will not admit he really wants to do is stride across the street and grab hold of then man leaned against the wall. To force his head back and sink his teeth into his throat. Feel the last few feeble pulses of his carotid as it leaks hot blood down their fronts, warming them against the cold night air.
“There may be one in the cabinet,” John gestures to a large, wooden piece against the far wall. Sherlock stands and goes to the cabinet, struggling with the aged latch before it finally gives way.
She freezes when she catches sight of John and Sherlock. How absurd they must look, John muses, cheeks burning. The two of them in bed, John straddling Sherlock's thighs.
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock,” he whispers into the darkness, “I was too late. I never should have let you leave in the first place. I should have forced you to stay with me, no matter the consequences. Nothing your brother could have done could be worse than this.”
Something moves across is field of vision, blocking out the diamonds twinkling above him. He thinks he can hear a voice, but he is unable to make out any words.
“Yes. Your brother, blind as he is, believed the late king David was responsible for the death of your parents.”
He had not bothered to ask where he would be taken, but after the first few hours it became obvious that he would not be taken to his brother’s court but to their ancestral home high in the mountains. For two days the peaks loomed ominously far in the distance, growing steadily closer with each passing hour.
Everything is a blur of teeth and tongues and fingers, and soon John is pushing into Sherlock. They’ve been intimate in this way before, but Sherlock still isn’t used to it. He bites down hard on his lip, trying and failing to will the tension from his body.
Sherlock looks up from his shoes to find he is behind a familiar door, the tunnel door that leads into the king’s apartment. As he places his hand on the latch to open it, he hopes that he will walk through to find John in his chair by the empty hearth, smiling and apologizing for being away for so long.
“Easy, the foods not going anywhere,” John say and hands Sherlock a fork before he can start shoveling butter chicken into his mouth with his fingers.
“I don’t know what it is about you, and I honestly don’t care. Call it what you will, but he has obviously taken an interest in you. You make my king smile, highness. For that, I feel I should thank you. Whatever there is between you, it can’t last forever, surely you know that— just don’t hurt him when it ends.”
Thoughts leave him, his body straining against the exhaustion trickling through him thick as tree sap. He feels heavy and sick. With one last push he is up on his knees and working against his rebelling limbs to get his feet under him. There, that was it, like that.
“To lawfully wed me would require written consent from the head of my family,” he states as simply as he can.
Sherlock felt a pang of guilt that made him feel heavy and cold inside. “How did they die,” he asked, voice barely more than a whisper, “John’s family?”
Sherlock is dumbstruck. The two chatter on amiably, but Sherlock can tell there is something about this woman that has John on edge. And hasn’t he noticed that a stranger has just seen Sherlock in his audience chamber?
The memory of pain is always sharper in sleep. Terror clings to him like vines, dragging him deeper. Dark eyes gleam with malicious intent as they flash across his mind’s eye— and then, Sherlock is jolting awake with a start.
He thought to himself. He licked his lips, trying to get an awful taste out of his mouth. Something just wasn’t right, and his legs felt like they were stuck in tar. He looked down at his feet and nearly fainted at the sight. Instead of shoes, he saw large, furry paws. He scrambled back, his mind not quite registering what his eyes were seeing. Watson looked over his back, and to his horror, he saw a light brown coat and a tail. He stopped and closed his eyes, as tight as they would go.
He growled sourly. The breeze blew against his muzzle, and he inhaled all the scents brought with it. He only had to smell it once to know it was there, suddenly more anxious to be following Holmes and his party. Gun powder. The men were armed, and would most certainly use it on him. Watson was deep in thought and almost forgot to hide himself when the group stopped abruptly. The oldest man out front called to Holmes, something about proof of a beast. Holmes trotted ahead into a small field, so Watson crept around to watch him from the flank. Watson looked out into the field and instantly recognized it; he was attacked by the beast here. It didn’t feel any less haunting in the daytime. Watson saw his clothing shredded on the ground, covered in blood. His revolver was in the grass a few feet away. Even he was disturbed by the sight of his own blood scattered across the meadow. Watson watched Holmes as he surveyed the torn clothing. He could feel and practically smell the stress coming off of Holmes. This made Watson very anxious, he couldn’t help but let out a small whine. He could barely keep himself from charging across the field to his beloved friend, to let him know he wasn’t dead after all. Watson started panting.
He huffed, and looked at the water. He wanted to scream at what he saw. An over-sized dog stared back at him, it’s coat the same chestnut brown as the hair on his once human head. Suddenly the events of the night unfolded in his memory. The growl, the large wolf chasing him, the attack, and the pain. He should’ve of died from all the blood he lost. Instead he woke up in a changed, foreign body. His legs gave out from underneath him as he tried to make sense of it all.
Watson turned and scanned the woods behind him. Nothing was there, just the dark canopy and patches of light coming from the moon. The full moon hung low in the night sky.
They sat in silence for a moment. “Watson, it’s okay, I know.” Watson glanced back up, unease in his eyes. “You were… not yourself. But only in physical form, you had your mind. When the same beast that had attacked you came to eliminate Thomas and I, you protected me. Jumped right into the fight, never once did you hesitate or back down until the threat was gone. The hero, as always.” Watson shook his head. “No Holmes, I can’t account for myself when I was that beast. I’d like to just forget it ever happened.” He said anxiously. Holmes looked away and didn’t say anything. “You never answered how I got back here, or what day it is.” Watson stated after a moment. Holmes cleared his throat. “Well, after you turned human again, I knew I had to get you home. You seemed ill. You went in and out of consciousness.  I covered you with my coat, and we rode back into town. I told Mr. Denvir, the eldest gentleman, that he was right; the beast was real. I told him Thomas killed the beast and saved you, at the price of his own life. Mr. Denvir was obviously distraught, but I had more important things to attend too. I hailed for a carriage, and we rode all the way back to London. You have been resting for two days now.” They again sat in silence as Watson absorbed what Holmes just said. “And what of Thomas’s body?” Watson asked. Holmes scoffed. “You of all people would be more concerned of a dead man than more pressing issues. But, if you must know, I covered his body with the tarp we used as our tent. I told Mr. Denvir where the body was so he could retrieve it for a proper burial.”He said passively. Watson just sighed and rubbed his eyes.
“Neither do I. I’ve not seen much of you these past few days, have you been avoiding me?” John’s tone is playful, but there is something underneath it that gives Sherlock pause; concern. Sherlock stares fixedly at the back of the bench in front of him, determined not to meet John’s eyes. Because, yes, he has been avoiding him. He bites down harder on his lip.
Something wasn’t right. This man couldn’t possibly be the sweet boy Sherlock had been presented to in the parlor. That boy’s face was kind and open, his eyes had sparkled. Through the fog that crept across his vision, Sherlock could see that this man’s eyes were empty and dark. This could not be his Jim.
John’s mind is awash with seemingly endless worries to worry about and considerations to consider. As the party begins its slow plod back to the manor he is soon completely lost in his thoughts. That is why he does not hear Greg at first, though he rides beside John.
The world warps around him as if he were under water. In his blurred vision, light from the high windows dances around the man’s frame, shining off of his flaxen hair like a halo. As they walk, the stranger— who seems much smaller from up here— casts his eyes back every few seconds to glance up at Sherlock. Each time he does, Sherlock feels his heart kick; reassuring evidence that he still lives.
