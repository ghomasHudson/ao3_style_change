John’s mouth opened several times as a million thoughts careened through his mind. “I think I want you to take what you need,” he said haltingly, “to take – take me.”
“Hmm. Yes.”
The vampire smirked and backed his boyfriend slowly up against the wall. Greg was tall, but Mycroft was taller by half a foot, and Greg let his head fall back against the wall with a soft thump and looked up at him.
“Fuck. Mycroft. Please!”
Greg’s jaw tightened. He nodded.
“Now, this next volunteer is a special one.” The crowd hushes as John steps forward. He’s wearing a black tuxedo and smiles a bit shyly at the audience. “May I present to you Dr. John Watson. This is no ordinary doctor, ladies and gentlemen, this doctor was, not long ago, a Captain in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. That’s right, ladies, you’re looking the genuine article – handsome, and he works well under pressure, and might I add that as a doctor, ladies, I’m sure he’s talented with his hands. As usual, you have 5 minutes to place the first bids.” The MC grins at the resulting twitter of laughter.
Stranger: No. That's boring. It's been hot anyway. SH
“I may have waived my wrist under his nose once or twice until he did.” John flushed a bit, remembering the intense look that Sherlock had given him that time. They had been in a dark sedan coming from the end of an investigation. Sherlock had nearly pinned John to the seat with his free hand as he had fed. It had made his blood boil and his cock ache.
Stranger: Greg nodded tiredly, wincing at the intensified aching, "God, yes. I hate hospitals, it'll be quieter at home." He squeezed Mycroft's hand lightly, "Must have looked like a cartoon, I never even saw him. One minute I was running, the next I was on the ground with a headache, bleeding all over the place."
“I prefer to think of it as being free of the distractions of sexual intercourse that, by its nature, would interrupt my deductive thought process.”
John opened his mouth to ask more on the subject, and then thought better of it. After a minute though, he said, “So…Greg mentioned that the mark you put on me, the….”
John had thought that he understood how this would be. Now, as the vampire pinned him down on the bed, head buried in the crook of his neck, and swallowing John’s blood in long languid gulps, he realized just how wrong he had been. He had never felt so much pleasurable pain before. His cock reached an aching hardness almost immediately. He wanted to touch himself. Some animal part of his brain wanted to push the vampire away in a desperate feeling of self-preservation. A big part of him wanted to pull Sherlock in for more. John settled for digging his fingers into the vampire’s bicep and holding on as his vision blurred around the edges.
“Are you surprised?”
You: John shivered. "Walking in on me. In the shower. While wanking."
Panting, Sherlock and Mycroft pull out with soft wet sounds, leaving John to collapse on the loveseat.  His cock is hard and leaking. He closes his eyes and groans. Strong arms wrap around him and he’s carried to the bed and laid down gently on the soft expanse of sheets.
“Sherlock! I’m going to - “
“No, love,” Greg interrupted. “I get you,” he insisted.
You: Sherlock's sharp eyes read over him. Shifting on his feet - nervous. Showered and shaved recently. Wearing a good suit. Trying to impress someone. His eyes widened. "You want to impress me."
“It’s a coagulant,” Sherlock said, answering the question John was about to ask.
“Oh,” Greg replied. “So I wasn’t imaging it.” He looked down. “This is going to take some time to get used to,” he mused.
Finally Mycroft sits back and turns to John. He runs his hand up John’s thigh again. “John, Sherlock and I…well, we came to something of a decision. About you.” John opens his mouth to protest. “Well, really I should say that I made Sherlock make a decision.” He smiles. “Sherlock was, shall we say, surprised to find that he felt a bit jealous at the idea of you being auctioned off. I had hoped that he would take the initiative and bid on you himself, but be that as it may, I placed a bid on you. I hope you don’t mind,” he says, squeezing John’s inner thigh perilously close to the bulge in his trousers. “So we came to a decision to share you.”
And John’s moment to be auctioned off to whatever moronic trophy wife who pays enough is almost here.  “£1,500! And what do you plan to do with Dr. Jones, may I ask young lady?” The MC  leaps off the stage and thrusts the microphone into the face of a woman in her early twenties.
Sherlock paused his movements and roughly held John’s head to the side. He bit down quickly, losing control of his self-restraint. John’s blood sang on his tongue. How was it this man managed to be so utterly interesting and erotic? He started to move his hips again.
Sherlock flopped onto the couch with a pout while John made himself busy in the kitchen and generally pretended that he hadn’t heard that last bit of conversation.
“Ok,” John says after a moment, having decided that it is clearly the safest thing to say. Sherlock crosses his arms and leans almost casually against the door jam. He’s wearing his red silk robe over pajamas. His feet are bare. He stares intently at John with a small smile playing on his lips.
“Anna and I stayed together until she gave birth. Xavier Leopold. My son. Our son.” Mycroft pulled out a portfolio and showed Greg a picture of a solemn looking teenager with sandy hair in a suit.
“Of course,” Sherlock said. He reached into his collar and brought out a gold chain with a small oval pendant swinging from it. John looked at it curiously as he placed it on the desk.
John paused, thought about it, and then blurted out the question he really wanted to ask. “Why me? Why is this – us – different?”
John groaned at his use of his own words. He spun them around and pushed his husband onto the bed.
Greg took his hand and squeezed it. “Yes, we’re….getting along fine.”
Swallowing a sigh, John sat and he smiled in thanks as the maid handed him a cup of tea.
“A-a vinidco mark?” John asked, chin still held in Sherlock’s fingers. He swallowed.
You: *cradling Sherlock between his legs
“We don’t. But we can’t have you dying of starvation while under my care, can I? Besides, that would make you somewhat useless as a donor. Also, your room is upstairs,” Sherlock said with a bored tone.
John arches up into the kiss. If he’s true to himself, he has been wanting this particular kiss for a very long time. Possibly since he and Sherlock first met. He reaches up caresses the other man’s neck, and nearly yelps in surprise when a hand cups his crotch over his slacks.
“Ah, that’s why you were sniffing my wrist the other day like a glass of fine wine.”
The elder Holmes brother smiled. “And how is John?”
Stranger: "Okay, dear. I won't tease anymore," Sherlock smiled, taking his fingers out and positioning himself at John's entrance. "You did," he answered. "I'm coming in."
John collapses and rolls onto the mattress next him. They both pant, staring up at the ceiling.
John gapes at him and then flushes, his eyes slipping down Mycroft’s chest. He finds a sudden interest in the delicate brocade pattern on Mycroft’s waistcoat. He notices that Mycroft has removed his jacket and tie, and that the top two buttons are undone. John rips his eyes away from the peak of pale skin.
John stumbled backwards. “Excuse me! You have no right! Besides, I’m under contract, and –“
Stranger: Sherlock moaned, pulling out, only to press back in quickly. "You're so tight." He breathed. "Fucking mine."
Around the room, at least a dozen people are typing their initial bids into the tablets provided by the auction organizers. He glances down at the tablet sitting next to him on the table.
“He wanted to ensure that we at least meet before you bond. Family is important to him.” He smiled wryly. “I’ve read your dossier. And now that we’ve met I can see why he likes you.”
Sherlock’s cell phone chimed. “Lestrade,” Sherlock said without looking. “I’ll be back later. Rest.”
You: "You are not broken. Nor are you old. But I do love you." The car came to a stop in front of their townhouse. "Ok, up you get."
“Trying? Not in the slightest. I was merely pointing out that you appear to be taking on your responsibilities as a master of a human in your care as a contract.”
Sherlock gently kissed his lips, making his touch soft and gentle. He pulled away after a few heated moments. “Take your jacket and tie off. This will be easier that way.”
John took a long sip of his drink, what was probably a very expensive bottle of wine. “Yeah. Right. Well….I mean what are friends for? And you know that Sherlock was going to be a witness and someone has to keep him in line.” John grinned.
I've received a number of requests for this to continue. The truth is that I ran out of steam when life happened, and now I simply don't have any plans for it. I've tried to write more, but it goes no where.  I did have an overall plot idea, but I'm having difficulty connecting one dot to the next. I may continue to add little scenes here and there, but consider the main story done for now. Thank you for reading.
you, John. I need….” His breath brushed roughly against John’s ear, and he shivered.
Mycroft places a bottle of lube on the side table next to the loveseat and sits down, one knee bent. He lazily rubs his cock, watching them rut against each other hungrily. He allows them a minute more before his own needs become too great. “You’re not sharing, brother,” he says softly.
Sherlock blinked at him a few times. “Don’t you wish to leave and return to your normal life?”
“Thank you. That will be all. I am not to be disturbed for the next couple of days unless England goes to war.”
Stranger: Sherlock buried his face in his neck, grabbing more soap before wrapping his hand again around John's cock.
For his part, Greg felt….stronger. He realized that he could feel Mycroft’s love and support flowing through the bond and he felt like he could tackle just about anything. He put his hand in Mycroft’s and squeezed it. “Thank you, from both of us. Shall we?” he asked his mate.
The car came to a stop outside of 221B.
“Now Sherlock, play nice,” Mycroft chides evenly.
Stranger: But what is the point? I'm not going anywhere. SH
“It is a part of the progression of healing. The protein strains in my blood are alien to your system, but they are helping nonetheless…It will subside soon.”
“Perhaps we should move to the living room?” Greg said, eyes locked with John’s. A small smile played around his lips, and John had an inkling as to why.
You and the stranger both like Sherstrade, and Mystrade.
Sherlock nearly leapt off the bed in his haste to shed his clothes. Once naked, he knelt between John’s legs so quickly, John didn’t have the chance to shift on the bed. Sherlock grasped John’s thighs from underneath and spread them out and up. He stared down at John’s tight hole and ran the tip of a finger around it.
John snorts. He can’t help it. He’s never had a partner make clinical assessments of him while in bed. “And I’m the one being distracting?”
Mycroft smiled and swiftly flipped them over so that he was on top of Greg on the couch. “I think that I should tie you down and not let you leave the house for at least a day. ”
Greg moaned but continued to lap at Mycroft’s neck. He knew he wasn’t supposed to stop until told to. It was an odd taste that washed over him. He thought he could feel Mycroft’s love and passion wash over him, too, drowning him in a wash of complicated emotions and maybe even memories.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then every sensation ratcheted up a notch when Sherlock, fangs still buried in John’s neck, pressed his thigh against John’s hard cock through his slacks. John hissed and, before he could stop himself, began to push up against the offered leg. He flushed as he rutted against Sherlock’s leg like an animal in heat, the pleasure of pressure against his aching cock tempered by the sharp burn in his neck. He vaguely realized that the vampire wasn’t even drinking anymore, just keeping his fangs painfully attached to his neck. Caught between the sharp pain in his neck and the sensations in his cock, pleasure shot between those two points, ricocheting back and forth until he cried out loudly and came hard. He shuddered his release, still pinned down to the bed.
Greg laughed and swatted his back. “But cold. Also, not so good for cuddling.”
You: John inhaled sharply at the feel of strong arms wrapping around him. "Um, I guess it is kind of warm in here..."
“No, but you want to be owned by me. Which is even more erotic.”
“I can hear your thoughts from here,” Sherlock says, eyes still closed, hands together, the tips of his long fingers just barely touching his lips.
You: "Your problem?" Sherlock asked. And then his eyes trailed down to the obvious bulged in Greg's slacks. "You're aroused." He boldly reached out and cupped him and whispered, "I believe that I am aroused, too."
He glanced at the hall. John had been sleeping for several hours in Sherlock’s bed following the claiming. He had read that humans needed to sleep after suffering a sudden pain like the burn. Technically, it was possible for John to go into shock, but he seriously doubted it. The man had invaded Afghanistan. He could just hear the man’s rhythmic breathing and heart beat from the front sitting room. Steady. Stable. Like John. Sherlock sneered at his own train of thought.
“You were wondering where we’re going. We’re going to Savile Row to see my tailor.”
“After all that, you think I’d say no?”
“It-it’s been a while,” John pants. “Take it easy, ok?”
“No. I want you to leave it there.” Mycroft gave him a lascivious grin.
Cheers.
At 11:45am John sat on the small bed in his room. He snorted as he considered that it had hardly been “his” for a while. He had been spending more and more time in Sherlock’s room. In Sherlock’s bed. He tapped his finger on the edge of the bed. The truth was that he didn’t really want to go. He knew he should. Most humans would probably be running out the door by now eager to be as far away as possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, been decent so far,” John replied with a shrug. “Nothing much really. He got me a load of new expensive clothes.” John gestured to his outfit of a tailored suit. “And so far I’ve been helping clean up the flat. Bit of a mess really, but loads of interesting stuff. He’s got these things that people have given as gifts, including this vase from the Duke of –“
Once naked, Sherlock joined John on the bed. He grasped John’s wrist and pushed his fingers in deeper, making the human gasp. “Only two fingers,” Sherlock growled. “I want to fuck you open.”
The next couple of days were a blur. Sherlock had a new case, and was, as usual, completely focused on it. It wasn’t until the third day of the case that John realized that the vampire hadn’t fed on him since the first time he’d fed from his neck. John waited until they were in a black sedan, headed back to 221B after Sherlock had solved the case.
“Besides, this is so much more…interesting, don’t you think?” Sherlock purrs before he leans down and claims John’s lips in a rough kiss.
The vampire snorted softly and stepped closer again. He stopped and his eyes narrowed, shifting to John’s left ear. He hissed softly.
that to me. You scared me.”
Greg raised his eyebrows in question. “Like?”
“I take it you like this,” John says with what would have been a smirk had he not groaned softly.
But he doesn’t say that. He’s given up on pointing out Sherlock’s eccentricities.
“You’ve had a long day, love,” Mycroft said, kneeling on the bed next to him. “This way you don’t have to exert yourself too much.” He carefully tied the silk around his lover’s ankles and then wrapped up and around his calves and thighs. These he tied to the bed posts so that Greg’s legs were held up and open.
“Yes, it’s a stupidly simple mark. A claim if you will. For that I would merely have needed to mark you with my blood in front of the Registrar. Rather…elementary,” Sherlock said dismissively. He ran one finger along the healing mark behind John’s left ear.
You: "Well, you could start moving at some point," John said, cradling Sherlock
Sherlock’s body hummed in approval at the sight. John’s muscular sturdy frame was a piece of art in his eyes. He possessively ran a hand up John’s right thigh, eliciting a shiver.
Greg looked at his beer and considered that this conversation was only made possible by alcohol. Lots of it. “Well. I mean. Ok. Where does he bite you?”
“There’s no need to be histrionic about it. Unless you plan to die in the near future.”
Mycroft laughed. “It’s my unofficial resume. Now sleep. I plan to use you thoroughly tomorrow.”
“Cheers. Can’t let a cold war get in the way of tea,” Greg said softly with a grin. John snorted.
“Sex with you is fantastic, Sherlock. You know that,” John interjected.
John opened his mouth to protest. The contract was over. Then he visibly relaxed, submitting. He closed his eyes and tilted his head back. “Yours,” he said, half-opening his eyes to look up into Sherlock’s.
Sherlock stood up swiftly. He let the journal fall to the floor and John took a step back in surprise. The vampire stalked towards John and backed him against the door frame between the kitchen and sitting room. John looked up at him, eyes wide. He swallowed nervously.
“It will be easier if you can bear down on me,” Sherlock said.
"Cosa pensi di fare, Alessandro?”
John pinned him with a wide eyed stare. “You what?! What do you mean handle?”
“How so?”
You: "Mmm," John replied, kissing back. He pulled Sherlock onto him, their bodies flush and heated
“That I don’t know,” Sherlock says. The way he nearly grinds out those three words makes John think that they are very costly to say.
Sherlock stood up swiftly and held out his hand to John. John stood and let Sherlock hold out his left hand. Looking him in the eyes, the vampire cut into the tip of John’s finger pad with one extended fang. John winced slightly, but didn’t resist as Sherlock held his hand palm up. He then bit into his own finger.
home. I do hope we’re not interrupting anything.” Mycroft smiled obsequiously, umbrella in hand. He walked in and Greg Lestrade followed.
“Allessandro, stop being so vile.” An older stately looking woman vampire approached them. Allessandro and Sherlock, nearly ready to attack, stiffened. “You must be John Watson,” she said with a thin smile.
“Come on, Myc, let’s go up to bed,” Greg said softly but firmly.
Greg grinned down at him. “I thought you might appreciate that. Besides, those trousers were kind of tight.”
"What are you doing, Alessandro?"
“It appears you are spending enough time with him that the family in Italy has noticed. Perhaps you should make a decision soon.”
Gregory Lestrade smacked another pint down the table. A bit of the beer sloshed over onto the table, but frankly at this point, John couldn’t care.
Greg struggled to keep his voice neutral. “And have you?”
“Have you ever been bitten by a vampire, John?”
“Yeah. Actually, Mycroft asked me to bond with him – to marry him – last night.”
“Ah. And how are things going between you?”
“What way?” John asked with a smile. He ran his hand up and down Sherlock’s side, ignoring the obvious bulge.
“It is clear, John, that you are surprised by my suggestion. I do not believe that it is practical to maintain cultural norms or even avoid taboos while conducting my…experiments. And since I clearly interrupted what appeared to be a very pleasurable activity when I entered your room, I thought I could, perhaps, join you.” He looks up, eyes brows raised in question.
Greg cried out in pleasure as he came hard, cock spurting between their joined bodies. He felt Mycroft’s hands on his head, silently telling him to let go. He pulled back, blood on his lips, and rested his forehead on his husband’s shoulder. Strong arms stayed wrapped around him, holding him close.
John’s pulse sped up, but he kept his eyes on Sherlock’s. “Do you – do you need me? I mean, my blood?”
“A surprise, I’m sure.” Mycroft closes the door and walks to the table. He pours two sifters of brandy and hands one to John and leans casually against the table. “I apologize for the deception, John. I certainly can’t be seen bidding on my brother’s flatmate, regardless of the motivations. You understand.” He gives him a smile that John is sure has smoothed over many political negotiations over the years.
A few minutes later, John walked into the kitchen. He blinked in surprise when he saw that there was a pot of tea already made. Sherlock never made tea. John glanced at the vampire, getting nothing but muttered mental notes that Sherlock voiced as he looked through the lens of a microscope, one hand making notes on a pad of paper.
“Take it off,” John said, nodding at the shirt. Obediently, Sherlock wriggled to get his shirt off. Half way through complying, John held up his hand. “Actually, stop there.”
And then John wrapped his smooth fingers around Sherlock’s cock.
Sherlock nods, eyes slipping closed, but John can still feel the tension in the other man’s body. Always in control. An idea forms in John’s head and he pushes the blankets aside. “Lie down.”
“Cheers, mate.”
“Why? We brought these to share,” Sherlock replied with a smirk.
Mycroft’s eyes darkened and closed his eyes. He stepped back and ran the loofah over Greg’s arse cheeks. Greg shivered. With one hand, the vampire spread the very enticing cheeks and ran the loofah down his cleft, knowing that the rough material would drive him insane.
Stranger: "Well you usually only smile at corpses so I feel quite special at the moment." Greg said softly, running his thumb across the back of Sherlock's palm.
Sherlock’s hand shot out and grasped the back of John’s neck. John gasped as he was caught in the vampire’s sharp grip. His eyes dilated for a moment and then darkened.
“He registered and completed an
John looked up at Sherlock from beneath hooded eyes. He was being fucked for the first time in years, and his body sung with the competing feelings of pleasure and pain and fullness and being taken and owned and possessed.
Stranger: "Erm." Sherlock nodded. "Am I doing this right?"
“I take it your drinks with Detective Inspector Lestrade was entertaining and worth your while?”
Sherlock grasped his left wrist, the one that he always fed from, and held it up between them. His thumb rubbed over the inner wrist, pressing hard. John realized belatedly that the way they were pressed together, Sherlock was sure to know he was hard.
Greg shrugged. “Until you die.”
“Here,” John murmured, “Right here. This spot smells so absolutely delicious that I think I’m just going to have to mark you. Right. Here.”
Melbourne carefully placed Sherlock’s sigil onto the blood and pressed it in. When he pulled it away, the sigil’s image was visible in the drying blood.
“That way is a dead end,” Sherlock said, adjusting his scarf. John noticed he wasn’t even winded. “He’s going to be trapped, but he’s still armed. John, stay here to head him off just in case. And get your gun out. You should be ready.”
“Anything else I should know about this? Sherlock’s not very, um, forthcoming.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and he snorted. “You couldn’t keep your sexual escapades out of my home, brother?”
“No – I’m not-”
Sherlock pushed John’s legs closed, picked him up and placed him on the couch. He zipped up John’s slacks and reached across him to press the button that would summon the Registrar.
“You’re stiff as a board,” John chuckles. He places his palm on Sherlock’s smooth toned chest and slowly runs it up, lightly tracing his delicate collar bones. Slowly, Sherlock breathes out, letting out a breath he might have been holding in for half of his life. His eyes slip closed.
“My wrist,” John said, turning up his left sleeve to show Greg.
You: Sherlock, I thought we talked about you needing to wear clothes around the flat. –JW
He had promised Mycroft that he would be home by 6pm. He sighed and closed the door behind him and hung up his coat, hoping Mycroft was in a slightly forgiving mood. He turned around and nearly yelped. Mycroft had snuck up on him and was standing less than a foot away, watching him silently.
You: Well, erm, yeah. But I don't suppose you could put a towel on or something?
“Ok, what aren’t you telling me, Sherlock?”
The door of the ritzy hotel suite closed with a soft click and John sat heavily on the couch. “I have to say, I kind of like the idea of not staying at the manor. That wedding planner…”
“Yes what?” Mycroft growled in warning.
John double checked the address. 221B Baker Street. Somehow he’d imagined something grander. He knocked hesitantly on the door. After a moment he knocked again.
Sherlock snaked his tongue out and slowly licked at the cream around the edge, a move that should, John thought, be made illegal it was so erotic. Sherlock popped the sweet into his mouth and then licked the rest of the cream off his fingers. His eyes met John’s, who shook his head good naturedly. Of course Sherlock knew of the effect he would have him.
Mycroft moved so swiftly that Greg didn’t have the chance to be surprised before he found himself pinned to the floor on his stomach, wrists held behind his back. “Didn’t anyone tell you not to threaten a vampire, Gregory?”
You: John pretended to read the newspaper, eyes flicking over to Sherlock, hoping he wouldn't be too obvious. He shifted in his seat, getting harder in his jeans. "So, no new cases?" -JW
“If you’ll have me,” Sherlock replies softly, pointedly staring at the ceiling.
Mycroft smirks and leans down to mouth John’s neck, which is temptingly stretched out beside him, and he gently palms John’s cock through his slacks. He’s pleased to find it hard and hot through the layers of fabric.
Sherlock obeys, lying on his back a bit stiffly, hands clenched at his sides. He looks up at the other man, and John thinks he can see something akin to hope in his eyes. It hits John how much Sherlock is trusting him at this moment. Always a pinnacle of control, Sherlock does not allow others to see him as human. As vulnerable.
“Too bad, I liked that shirt,” he muttered as he dropped the ripped and bloody shirt on the floor.
You: "May-maybe." John licked his dry lips and pushed his hips forwards. "You're too tempting. I think you do it on purpose."
Sherlock glanced down to where John was sleeping lightly on his shoulder and frowned. As much as he hated to admit it, Mycroft was correct. He should have laid official claim before now, but he couldn’t be sure…
“Mmm, but then, we always work best together when there’s a hint of danger, right?”
Stranger: "The tea can wait!" Sherlock grinned, triumphantly. He turned the stove off and pulled John into his bedroom, where he shed all of his flatmate's clothes and tossed them to the floor before staring at John's naked form with a smile on his face. "Better right?"
“I won’t refuse you. You don’t have to keep me out,” John said resolutely.
Greg shrugged as if it had been easy. “But I do trust you, Mycroft, whether I’m your partner or your submissive or your blushing virgin,” he said with a wink.
“Everything appears to be in order. John?”
Sherlock smirked. “Mine,” he growled again. He gave into temptation and leaned down to bite into the tempting bared skin. He ignored the whimper that John made and sucked out more warm blood, relishing the taste before he pulled away. He didn’t bother to lick the wound closed, instead letting blood ooze down John’s neck.
“I’m going to assume that by mate you don’t mean friends to watch rugby with.”
Sherlock starts a somewhat clumsy rhythm, hands digging into the sheets, letting himself feel. John leans on one hand, intently watching Sherlock’s face as pure pleasure washes over his features, all the while working his beautiful cock.
“Wait. Wait wait wait. I didn’t just get
Stranger: "Okay, dear. I won't tease anymore," Sherlock smiled, taking his fingers out and positioning himself at John's entrance. "You did," he answered. "I'm coming in."
Sherlock pulled back and looked him in the eyes. “Now I’m going to give you what you want.” The feral smile that slowly spread across his face showed both of his fangs as they slowly extended.
Mycroft smirked and began to lick and suck on Greg’s hard cock. It was weeping, and he pressed his tongue against the piss slit to get more of the taste of him. He paused, wondering idly if what he was about to try would be too much. He carefully watched Greg’s face as he let one fang slice straight into the side of the man’s cock. Greg whimpered, hands digging into the bedding, eyes squeezed shut tightly.
Stranger: "Oh, I hope not. Wouldn't want to share you with Moriarty," he murmured, sucking a hickey into John's pale neck and shoulder.
“Come,” Sherlock said simply and held his hand out. He positioned John so that he was sitting on the vampire’s lap, back to front. He pulled John flush against his chest.
"But he has no sign, cousin. You should take better care of your things. He might come to harm."
“And I suppose that as a doctor, you’re already used to needles,” Mr. Holmes said with a hint of disdain.
Later, the four of them were seated in the comfortable living room on plush sofas by the fire. Lestrade and John are drinking beer, and the Holmes brothers are nursing small glasses of very fine scotch.
someone would do that, but of course, the vampires, though there were fewer of them, lived much longer and had powers humans could only dream of, and, frankly, they controlled the banks. By law, a vampire could claim a contract any time between the contracted human’s age of 15 and 35. John was 34, and his contract has been sold by his struggling parents to the Holmes family when he had been a child. The poor veteran doctor had started to think the Holmes’s had forgotten about the contract completely. He’d thought he was safe.
You: John nearly fell apart as Sherlock pounded into him. His cock was hard and leaking onto his flat belly between them
John nodded. “It was….in some ways not as awkward as I thought it would be.”  He paused. “Mycroft made it better for Greg. He cares about him. Protects him.” He smiled. “I’m happy for them both.”
Stranger: Greg hummed contently and allowed Mycroft to settle him onto the couch, tucking a blanket around him. Another time, Greg might have grumbled about not being a child or some sort of regency heroine, but the blanket was soft, he was tired, and damn it if it wasn't nice to be comfortable. He leaned his head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes, waiting for Mycroft to return.
“Erm, I suppose I’m not entirely sure what those would be.” He shot Sherlock a glare, which was pointedly ignored.
John smiled predatorily. “Your body,” he said, pushing a finger into his husband’s hole, “wants a big alpha cock like mine to mark you.”
The car is now outside of London. It turns into a gated driveway and slowly pulls to a stop in front of a large manor house. He helps Annabelle out of the car and up the stone steps.
"Sono venuto per ordine di mia madre. Lei vuole sapere se le voci sono vere. "
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John asks, leaning away a just bit.
Stranger: Sherlock took a few deep breaths, before stepping out of his boxers and following. He could hear John moaning, he didn't hesitate before pulling John against his chest. "Enjoying yourself without me?" He rumbled.
John glanced at his wristwatch, an expensive gift from Sherlock. “Yes, the contract ended about 90 seconds ago. So I can do what I want. I’m a free man. And I decided that I want to stay. If that’s alright with you, of course. But not as your contracted human.” He lifted his chin defiantly. “As your...companion, periodic assistant. Flatmate.”
“Not at all. We simply wished to convey our concern about John’s welfare. And to communicate our news, of course.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked around to the people and vampires passing by them. “Come,” he said, and swiftly turned, making his long coat swirl around him. John hastened to follow. The vampire paused for a moment at the building directory.
The sound of the front door being opened by a servant interrupted Mycroft’s reply. “Ah. They’re here.”
Greg approached the bedroom quietly and gently pushed the door open. John sleepily looked up at him from Sherlock’s bed.
After a minute, the vampire pulled back. “You need to eat. I’ve kept your meal warm.”
“And what types of pieces would you like to order, sir?” the tailor asked Sherlock with a bow. John tried not protest that
Sherlock squirmed, blushing. “Like – I’m on display. And that you’d take care of me…even if I were bad.”
“It didn’t. Until I invited him to join me, that is. We are both invited every year, actually, and I usually make an effort to attend. But then I saw your name on the list of volunteers, and I thought Sherlock wouldn’t possibly want to miss the…opportunity.”
John’s penis was bigger than before. There had to be some mistake. Now that he and Sherlock were married and off the hormonal suppressants, his system should be flooding with the omega hormone that would enable him to be taken by his alpha. To bear his child.
When Sherlock released his wrist, John stared at it. Two small pinprick wounds were visible, but not other damage.
“Hey,” John said, “Thanks for listening. And for the advice.”
“Of course. I have questions for you. And the other?”
“Excellent. She will be pleased.” Alessandro turned to walk away. He paused as he passed by Sherlock, who was still holding John to his chest. “"Sai, cugino, se ho posseduto un animale domestico che puzzava così, non avrei mai lasciato il mio cazzo lasciare il suo culo.”
In their bedroom, Mycroft walked Greg backwards towards their massive bed. Greg lay back, legs spread a bit invitingly, eyebrow quirked in a silent challenge. Mycroft smiled. After decades of simpering sycophants, Gregory Lestrade was a breath of fresh air.
form a bond with Mr. Holmes while in the year under this contract.”
“I had thought as much,” Sherlock says with a smile. He starts to move his hand, rubbing John’s cock through the thin blanket. John’s hand slowly moves, reaching for Sherlock’s thigh, which is startlingly close to his own.
John paused and smiled as he imagined the energetic vampire who always dashed about like an enthusiastic child, staying willingly in the room, listening to his vital signs. “Well, thank you for looking out for me,” John said.
You: John howled as Sherlock pushed inside of him. It was still tight but that only made him harder. "Yesss, make me," he moaned.
“Beautiful,” Sherlock murmured.
John thinks, and then laughs softly at himself.
“Mmm, yes I do hope so,” Mycroft said, keeping his voice soft and cultured. He reached for the second hand-held shower head on a hose and flicked it on. Grinning, he knelt behind Greg and held his arse cheeks open. Without warning, he aimed the harsh spray at Greg’s tight hole.
When John looked at the other two men, he locked eyes with Greg and smiled a bit shyly. Greg grinned, as if to say ‘now that’s how you keep a Holmes in line.’
When Sherlock turned around, he nearly pinned John to the bed with his eyes. He slowly moved towards the bed, gracefully like a predator.
“Sorry. Couldn’t hold back.” John blushed sheepishly.
John nearly choked on the water. “Harry! We – we barely know each other! I mean, we do know each other, and he’s a nice bloke and all, but we’ve only had a handful of dates.”
Stranger: "The mystery of John Watson's attraction," he answered, taking the blonde's face in his hands and smiling down at his flatmate. "It seems I was a suspect and I've managed to become the criminal."
In response, Sherlock bites down softly, eliciting a soft grunt from John. John reaches up and tangles his fingers in Sherlock’s dark curls and pulls him up for a hungry kiss.
“John, I need you to move now.”
Mycroft silently closes the door and sits next to him. “Thank you.” He runs a hand tentatively over John’s leg and then leans in for a kiss.
Sherlock dug his hands into the sheets. “You have to ask that question?” he breathed.
John licked his lips and looked into Sherlock’s eyes. “Yours,” he said breathily but with confidence. They stared at each other for a moment.
“N-no...sir,” John breathed out as he fingers tightened around the wood of the headboard. He squeezed his hole around Sherlock’s cock and grinned at the gasp that he managed to pull from the vampire.
You: "I wouldn't dream of it, love," Mycroft said as he placed the fork in Greg's hand.
“My dear brother. He’s very set on ensuring that we…produce the right results. Or should I say reproduce?” He smirked for a brief moment. “But I am not willing to share us with others. Especially with him.”
Sherlock eased John’s legs open so that they draped on either side of his lap and then opened his slacks. He mouthed kisses on John’s neck as he pulled out John’s half-hard cock. John keened softly and pushed his hips up.
When Sherlock was spent, he lay back, panting harshly. John leaned down, sniffing the juncture of Sherlock’s neck. When he found the right spot, just below his ear, he latched on and bit down. He worried the skin between his teeth, ignoring his mate’s whine.
“No,” he replied softly, watching Sherlock’s fingers rub nonsensical patterns on his skin.
“Pray excuse me, gentlemen,” Mycroft says, tightening the robe and opening the bedroom door.
The vampire laughed, licking his way up to John’s neck and then jawline. “Are you going to cum for me, John? I think you’re ready. I think you can cum without a single touch to your cock.” He smirked. “Do it. I want to feel you.”
“That I should experiment with sex to learn more about it. To see if it is indeed – alarming.”
“Yes, I-I’m ready.”
Sherlock smiled. “Yes. I assure you he has been a willing donor for years. He is simply not open about the private facts of his life.”
John slowly was able to move and he surreptitiously eased Sherlock’s hands so that the claws weren’t digging into him. He looked around, noting that no one else seemed to be paying them any attention.
John glanced at Sherlock again, assessing him. Sherlock was tense, but a large bulge was forming in his bespoke slacks. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist and pulled him back against him as he leaned back on the sofa. Sherlock stiffened.
After a minute, Sherlock pulled the sigil away and buried his nose in John’s hair. “It’s done,” he said softly.
John flushed a bit and pretended to be very interested in his drink for a moment. “Thanks. I’m…. well I’m definitely glad that the contract is over. It’s nice to be able to make a choice about it.” He shrugged. “I’ve gotten Sherlock to accept that I’m going to return to being a doctor. Part time for now, but he was a bit miffed that I can’t be available all of the time to run around London with him.” He snorted softly.
Sherlock lay still, breathing hard, eyes closed. John noted that he was still hard. Possibly achingly hard. Silence fell on the room.
Stranger: Sherlock made a noise of thought from where he laid on the sofa and waved a hand at John without looking at him.
It made John shiver in anticipation.
“Not quite yet,” Sherlock replies with a smile as he takes just the tip John’s cock between his lips. He lets it slip out. “But I am glad to hear that you’re open to the possibility.”
“You want in you? Splitting you open and forcing you to hold my seed inside?” John teased Sherlock’s
“Hmm, well that’s a good thing, right? Today was pretty frightening. I thought your little brother was going to actually rip that prick’s head off.”
Mycroft lifted his hand and kissed it. “Yes. We’ve got a few things to do. Guests to socialize with,” he said with a wrinkle of his nose. He paused and said very softly so that only Sherlock could hear it, “The bedroom down the hall, last on the right, has been prepared for you.”
“Just let me know if he hurts you, ok? I’ll kick his arse, vampire or not.”
You: "Eh, he's too...too nuts." John groaned and arched his neck, loving it when the sensitive skin there was touched and nibbled and licked
“Do I have a choice?” John asked, voice tinged just a bit with resentment.
“Out in the front room having a war of words with Mycroft.”
“Why not?”
You: "There's lube in the drawer by the shower," John said, still moving his hips, making Sherlock's cock slide up and down his cleft. "But I don't need prep....not after this morning."
You: John tilted his head back and licked his dry lips
“Yeah, guess so. Thanks for the tea.”
John was saved from making a reply when Mycroft stood up. All eyes were glued to him as he stoically unbuttoned his slacks and pushed them down his long pale legs.
“Making sure I’m alive, I’m sure,” John muttered with a snort to himself. He sighed and ran his finger over the healing wound behind his ear.
Sherlock growled as his cock slipped between John’s arse cheeks. He held John’s upper hand and pinned it to his chest as he started to push his cock back and forth, setting up a quick rhythm. John obligingly squeezed his cheeks tightly around him. Sherlock imagined when he would be able to have John Watson splayed out beneath him, completely naked and at his mercy. His mind cataloged the things he would do to him, with him.
You: *cradling Sherlock between his legs
You: John squirmed on the bed, pulling his knees up and shameless openeing himself up for Sherlock
“Actually, I did a bit of looking around….And I might have asked for some information from my future brother-in-law,” Greg admitted with a smirked.
Greg reached back towards his arse. “I’ll take out the –“
“I know, love, but it won’t take too long, judging by our state of things.” Mycroft smirked. He handed Greg a robe and put one on himself. The robes were deep burgundy colored and hung heavy to their ankles. “I’ll text Sherlock to let him know we’re ready.”
John sputtered. “Well, I – sure – I mean, yes. But I’d still like to know. You can’t treat me like a-a toy! It’s a bit not good, you know.” He folded his arms crossly.
Greg obediently turned around and rested his arms on a sturdy towel bar. Without being asked, he spread his legs a bit wider than shoulder-width. For a moment, Mycroft sat back on his heels and admired the image of Gregory Lestrade with water cascading down his back. He decided that this was possibly one of the most erotic things he’d ever seen.
John looked around once and then climbed into the car. It immediately began to move into London traffic. John found himself sitting across from an impeccably dressed man and smiled politely, legs crossed.
Mycroft Holmes: How would you know?
“The bite. Were you ever bitten before Sherlock?”
“Was it like this with your previous donors?”
John frowned up at his master. He rarely thought of the vampire in such terms, but it occurred to him that perhaps Sherlock Holmes needed him to approve of and agree to this as much he needed to feel that John was safe. “O-ok,” he said. He licked his dry lips nervously. “What do I need to do?’
“That was...sudden,” John commented after a few minutes of silence.
“Since this is your experiment, what do you want to do?”
You: John inhaled sharply at the feel of strong arms wrapping around him. "Um, I guess it is kind of warm in here..."
hole with the tip of his cock.
“Like we have problems in that area,” Greg snorted.
John shivered at the primal tone of Sherlock’s voice, and nodded. “Yes,” he said. “Please.”
“Oh. Yes. Bathroom’s all yours.”
Stranger: Greg thought about waving the touch off and possibly tazing whoever it was before recognizing the touch and pushing the pillow away, looking exhausted up at Mycroft, bandage wrapped aeound his forehead, hair mussed, expression distinctly disgruntled, "I should have stayed in bed this morning." He said flatly, twining his fingers with Mycroft's and laying back on the bed again, closing his eyes.
Sherlock looks down his body, noting the cooling seed on his pale skin. He frowns. Must sex be so messy?
With that she was out the door and heading to the grand ballroom of Holmes Manor where the wedding was going to take place.
“No. I wouldn’t expect it to. Any pain you feel now would be solely psychosomatic in nature. It is common for soldiers to feel spasms in cases such as yours periodically over a long period of time after leaving the battlefield.” He states this as if they are standing in a laboratory and he is making a point on a case.
“Honestly, John. You’d think I was taking you to your execution.”
Greg followed him into the kitchen, guiltily rubbing the back of his neck. He grabbed a bottle of beer from the fridge and took a long swig, sighing happily when he put it down.
“That was excellent,” John said, leaning back in his chair. “Mycroft, you’ve surprised me. I had no idea you could cook like that.”
“Please, allow me to introduce my intended bond mate, Gregory Lestrade,”Mycroft said, putting a hand on Greg’s lower back supportively. “Gregory, allow me to introduce Anna, her husband, Alexander, and son, Xavier.”
“Mycroft!” the woman said warmly, moving to take his hand.
I came up with the sigil image by looking through the internets and finding a reference to the lion as one of the Holmes family crests from Ireland: http://www.heraldicjewelry.com/holmes-crest-page.html. There's no actual image of the personal sigils I described for Mycroft and Sherlock as I can't draw worth crap.
“Ahh, you flush so prettily, John.” Mycroft leans towards him very slowly and whispers, “I’d like to know if your skin flushes anywhere else. Hmm?”
“Watch,” Sherlock said, showing both of his fangs. Suddenly, the vampire jumped. John watched, mouth agape, as Sherlock climbed effortlessly up the wall of the alley. He then moved sideways, towards the murderer, who was now cornered at the end of the alley. Lestrade and the other officers ducked behind dumpsters as the criminal opened fire, shooting at everything that moved. Several bullets flew down the alley and John ducked. He poked his head out the side to see if he could move in closer when a large black shape dropped onto the crazed killer.
John let out a breath and nodded. “That’s good. Having only recently been contracted to you. Well it’s a bit much.” He blushed and then quickly added, “Not that I’d never be interested - just -”
You: "Well, you could start moving at some point," John said, cradling Sherlock
You: John hissed and cried out. "Fuck!" He panted. "Do that again"
“When one of my kind feeds
“So?” Greg shifted a bit uncomfortably and said quietly, “That’s how I handle Mycroft.”
Victoire eyed John once and tilted her head in acknowledgement, though John thought he caught a flash of a smile. “You have duties to your brother, do you not?” she asked, turning to Sherlock.
“You knew he would be up there,” Sherlock says. “That’s why you invited me to this gauche event. But why? What would you gain from showing this to me, Mycroft?” Sherlock turns away from the stage to glare at his elder brother.
Greg smiled wistfully. “I won’t say no.”
Sherlock flicks his blue eyes to where John is answering some ridiculous question that the MC has just asked about his favorite program on the telly. Utterly ridiculous. On Sherlock really knows John. These people have never seen how John can just jump into a situation, willing to help a friend in need. Even Mycroft has never seen John wander into the kitchen first thing in the morning, hair ruffled, feet bare as he makes tea. John. Is. His.
“Have maintained a good business relationship. She reports his progress to me. I see him periodically. He is currently in university at Harvard.”
John next cry died at the familiar voice. The vampire turned and snarled at the intruder. “Non sono affari tuoi, Mycroft!”
John’s hands gripped the headboard, holding himself open and vulnerable for Sherlock. The vampire held his ankles hard and he knew there was no possibility of pulling free from that grip. Not that he wanted to. His cock bounced hard and leaking, untouched, on his belly. He used what mobility he had to push his hips up into each thrust.
You: John made tea, trying not to let his eyes wander to where Sherlock lounger on the couch, naked.
Stranger: Sherlock pressed closer and watched John's face. "I've solved it."
When his thirst had been quenched for the moment, he pulled back and lapped at the wound to heal it. He looked up Greg’s magnificent body to where the human was panting softly, eyes bright. “Tell me if it becomes too much.”
The vampire released John and roughly pushed him into Sherlock, who caught him easily and pulled him flush against his chest to hold him up. It was then that John noticed that Sherlock’s claws were out as the tips just barely pushed against his skin through the layers of clothing. He winced but stayed silent. A quick glance showed him that Sherlock’s fangs were out and his eyes, normally bright, were dark and angry.
Stranger: "Is this your first time?" He muttered breathily. "With a man..."
The look that Sherlock gave him made his pulse speed up in ways he didn’t want to examine. “No,” he said after a pause, finally looking away. “I have already begun to heal.” He stood up, pulling John up with him. “Lestrade! I trust you have what you need?”
John shifted nervously and finally remembered he was holding a cup of tea. He took a sip. “Right,” he said softly. “I suppose that’s a good point.” Not able to bear the heavy silence that lay between them, John made a beeline for the living room where he could pretend to watch a morning news program on the telly.
Stranger: He sucked the skin greedily, biting and nipping at John as his hand teased his cock, sliding his thumb over the leaking slit and creating a delicious burn. "What do you want me to do to you, John? I won't do anything until you tell me."
Greg looked down at him over his shoulder. “Look who’s talking.”
Greg rolled his hips and moaned, throwing his head back. “Please?” he moaned, lost completely in the moment.
For a moment, neither spoke or moved. And then Greg launched himself at the vampire, pinning him to the couch and kissing his mouth long and hard. When he pulled back, he said, “Yes, yes you fool. Like I’d say no.”
, John?” He crowded into John’s personal space, one hand teasingly barely grasping his left wrist.
John nods as if this is exactly the type of conversation he expects to have in the middle of the night when his flatmate bursts in on him masturbating. “By sex? Well, yes.”
Greg took a swallow. “You know, I’m glad Sherlock lets you come out for this. I was worried he’d be an arse about having you in service for the whole contract.”
On impulse Mycroft buried his face in the crook of Greg’s neck. “I love you,” he murmured.
Greg licked his lips, their audience at the back of his mind, as Mycroft teased the flat of a sharp claw up his hardening cock. Greg pushed himself up on his elbows, eyes focused solely on Mycroft’s, which had darkened with lust, tinged with red. Mycroft took a hold of his already slick cock and guided the tip into his hole. Greg whimpered, letting his head fall back, revealing his neck.
“Well I suppose that would be…a good thing,” John admitted.
“You’re telling me? The other day I found out that he hadn’t eaten in three days. He said that it ‘distracted him,’” John said, adding air quotes and rolling his eyes.
“What?” Sherlock looked at him, eyes narrowed.
He turned around and nearly gasped. Sherlock was standing not a foot away and John hadn’t even heard him move. “Yes.”
Stranger: Sherlock huffed and kissed over John's throat, sucking several hickeys into his skin while he thrusted harder and deeper into John.
With a shudder, Sherlock let his fangs pull out. He quickly looked up at John’s face to assess his reaction. John’s eyes were closed and he was panting, but the way his hips were jerking slightly, it didn’t appear that he was in pain.
“The blood drinking, yes. The second part, most assuredly not,” Mycroft replied with a face. “For that we choose our witnesses. And my Mother is not one I would consider.”
Mycroft chuckled softly. “My sweet Gregory. You are….so precious to me.” He grasped Greg’s chin and held him still for a kiss. The he walked Greg backwards until his legs hit a chaise lounge behind him.
John shifted. Somehow he doubted this man liked him. Or perhaps he was always so stiff. He decided to stay silent. Mycroft pressed a button to reveal a small refrigerator in the wall.
Sherlock snarled at him at the thought of the other vampire impinging on his claim over John, but the door was already closed. He looked at John, noting the pale features and slightly clammy skin. He picked up John’s discarded jacket and tie.
“What exactly are you trying to imply, Mycroft?”
“As am I,” Sherlock said. “I’m pleased that you did not find the bonding too frightening.”
Stranger: Sherlock gently circled the sensitive skin of John's entrance before actually sliding his first finger in and out, carefully stretching John.
Sherlock closed his eyes and nodded.
“Sherlock gave him that one, huh?” Greg asked from the floor.
John pulled out his laptop and turned away from the kitchen so that he didn’t have to see the jars while eating.
The vampire dropped down on top of him, knocking him to the ground in a flurry of speed and strength. John gasped, watching in awe. He had never actually seen a vampire in action like this. He had heard of it. There had even been a special force of them in Her Majesty’s Army in Afghanistan, but the group was very secretive and no one talked about its tactics or the missions it completed. Ever. In less than a minute of tussling, Sherlock had the man pinned to the ground and whining in pain as he pulled one arm behind his back at an awkward angle.
“Why thank you, John. That is most kind,” Mycroft smiled.
“I don’t know what you hope to gain from this,” Sherlock muttered as the cab pulled up in front of Mycroft and Greg’s townhouse.
The vampire grinned and palmed John through his shorts. “Then cum for me,” he growled. “Clench your delectable arse around me.” John howled as his second orgasm ripped through him. As he did so, Sherlock groaned and came, shooting his seed between John’s clenched thighs.
The vampire stepped forward into his personal space. He sniffed the air. “Clearly you’re
“He has quite the talented mouth, doesn’t he?” Mycroft says.
“You?!”
from one of your kind, it forms a connection.” Sherlock’s voice was low and slower than normal, sending shivers up John’s spine. He held John’s wrist up to his nose and sniffed audibly. To John, it appeared that he was sniffing a glass of fine wine.
Greg frowned and put his food tray on the side table. “Talking.”
Sherlock leans against the door, crosses his arms, and looks down at John. He gives him a slow, lascivious smile. "I do hope my brother has been a good host," he says as he closes bedroom door.
Stranger: "Well... I don't know." He said, splaying his legs out to show his slightly hard cock.
John ran the tip of his finger over Sherlock’s lips. “I know you can hurt me. But I don’t think that you will.” When Sherlock’s lips parted, he pushed the tip inside and grazed it against one of the sharp fangs. He didn’t wince when it sliced through his skin with little pressure.
“Show me.” It wasn’t a suggestion and John pulled up his left sleeve to reveal the two small puncture marks on his inner wrist. Mycroft leaned forwards in interest and looked closely. “Interesting.” He leaned back. “You should know that my brother usually doesn’t feed directly from his donors.”
You: John moaned at the feeling of his teeth biting into the skin. He knew that he'd have marks tomorrow, but somehow that only made it hotter. Marked by Sherlock Holmes. His ass clenched around Sherlock cock at the thought
“Fuck. Yes, Sherlock please!”
“Ooohh, help you with biology is it? Well, you’ll be getting top marks for sure!”
Panting, Sherlock leans down, forehead resting against John’s. For one long moment, they lie there, breathing heavily, sweat on their bare skin. After everything, this moment is oddly the most intimate, and John silently runs his thumb over Sherlock’s cheek.
“Ah. Well then. This claiming act will ensure that others of our kind will know immediately that you are under the protection of another vampire, and more generally of the Holmes family.” He leaned forward and said in a falsely low stage whisper, “Not a bad setup, young man.”
Mycroft grasped Greg’s chin and forced his head to the side to expose his neck. Greg hissed at the sudden feeling of sharp teeth piercing his skin. The vampire drank more, reveling in the feeling, the taste of it. Sensing that they were both close, he kept his fangs buried and roughly snapped his hips. He tried to hit Greg’s prostate with each thrust, making him cum hard. There was a sudden burst of blood that spurt into Mycroft’s mouth, and his eyes rolled up, overwhelmed. He came hard.
“Come, John. Let’s go home.”
You: "You should've. We could have done - ohhhh. Feels good!" John glanced down, feeling Sherlock's sharp eyes on him. "I-I thought of your hands. Soapy. On my skin..."
There’s some pre-cum on the tip of John’s cock, and Sherlock swipes his finger over it. He sucks the finger tip between his lips.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose slightly. “That sounds like a change of heart.”
Stranger: It may or may not have been an excuse to see you. GL
The Holmes brothers watched him walk down the hallway with a mug of hot tea made the way John liked it.
“Well, since you are not interested, I assume that it won’t be a problem?”
“No,” John said softly. “I want…you – to make me yours.” He pressed his lips to the vampire’s, swallowing his answering growl.
Greg nodded and watched, hands in his pockets, as John walked towards his new master.
Emotions, connections. He
John wraps his fingers around both of their cocks, forcing them together.
Bright grey eyes paused and flicked to him. Sherlock frowned, blinked once, and then looked back down.
Almost immediately, Sherlock was typing away on his cell phone. John glanced at the driver and decided to simply sit quietly on the plush leather seat as they were driven to….somewhere.
Smirking just a bit, Sherlock pushes his robe and pajama top off, and they land in a heap on the floor by the bed. When he sits down right next to John, John reaches out and traces a finger tip around Sherlock’s left nipple. It’s already a small hard nub, and he gently digs his nail into the soft flesh, eliciting a sharp inhale.
“Well, I can tell you that Mycroft and I were sort of surprised he chose that particular type of claim.”
He picked up his violin and began to compose a new piece, letting his thoughts guide the bow as it slid gracefully across the strings.
Seeing the wound clearly for the first time, John knelt on the floor in front of him so that he could inspect it further. He gently touched the edges, noting how the skin was torn.
Sherlock laughed and placed a kiss on the back of his neck. “I take it you enjoyed it?”
Stranger: Greg trailed kisses down Sherlock's neck nipping and sucking at the pulse point and the sensitive skin behind his ear. "What would you suggest?" He whispered into his ear.
“Why would you even want to bid on John? You practically kidnap him weekly to spy on me anyway,” Sherlock mutters.
Greg laughed. “I’ll tell him you said so. He’ll think it’s funny.”
“Learn about -? Wait. You mean that wasn’t just brotherly teasing? I thought he was just trying to get a rise out of you. Sherlock, are you telling me that you’re a – a virgin?”
Sherlock watches the surprise on John’s face at the revelation and grins around the lovely penis in his mouth. He’d walked in on Mycroft enough times over the years growing up to be familiar with that particular idiosyncrasy. He closes his eyes and focuses on the cock, John’s cock, that’s in his mouth. If he’s true to himself, he’s wanted to do this for a very long time. He presses his tongue against the tip and watches John’s eyes close with pleasure.
“Ah. That. He found your…scent appealing. Enough to attempt to force your loyalties to onto him.”
John swallowed. “Um, yes,” he replied slowly.
They lay there like that, panting softly. After a moment, Sherlock extricated himself and pulled the back of John’s shorts up, caressing his hip.
Sherlock watched him for a moment. He was…perplexed by John H. Watson. The man broke many of the rules he had formed over the years when dealing with humans. Sherlock Holmes had been the subject of many, both men and women, who were infatuated and threw themselves at him. Hell, even other vampires resorted to such measures, drawn by either his good looks or his family's power. They were imbeciles who readily agreed with everything Sherlock said or did.
You: "Good," Sherlock said before he leaned his head down and pressed his lips to the other man's.
John shivered at the possessive tone in his voice. “Yes sir.”
“Probably a good idea,” John choked out, flushing slightly, and nervously shifting on his seat.
John shrugged. “It’s fine, I suppose. I like helping at crime scenes. It’s interesting.”
“May I offer you a drink, Dr. Watson?”
pet. You smell rather edible.” He pointedly looked John up and down. “But you aren’t wearing any marker. Unclaimed, hmm?” He reached out and ran the tip of a finger down the shell of John’s left ear.
“Just because I choose not to follow ridiculous social norms doesn’t mean that –“
When he was done, Sherlock knelt there, panting, head hanging down. John soothed his hand over his back. “Shhhh, that’s good. So beautiful like this, Sherlock.” He pressed kisses to Sherlock’s sweat-sheened back, and gently pulled him into an embrace.
“That won’t be necessary. I have taken the liberty of telling the Yard that you will be out for at least two days. Also, the paperwork necessary for today’s operation is complete,” Mycroft said without a hint of remorse as he reached over and handed the mobile to him.
“Don’t play coy, Sherlock. You know you that vindicowould have been sufficient.”
John reaches between their bodies and grasps both of their erections in his hand. He balances on his left hand, watching Sherlock’s face, as he slowly rubs upwards. Sherlock digs his fingers into the sheets as he groans.
“And you find this enjoyable, Dr. Watson?”
After recovering his balance, John looked up at Sherlock and nearly gasped at the heat he saw in the vampire’s eyes. He took an involuntary step back and Sherlock grinned, letting him see his fangs. He swallowed and adjusted his stance, raising his chin in silent defiance.
John snorted. “He sent it by text of all things. Said I’m to meet him at – hold on.” He pulled out his phone and pulled up the text. He showed it to Greg.
Stranger: Greg leaned heavily against Mycroft, lifting a hand tiredly at Sally as they walked by her, out of the hospital and into the car. As soon as they were inside, Greg managed to squirm himself around until his head was situated on Mycroft's lap, not feeling as many of the small bumbs in the London road as he would have sitting up. "Yeah, well someone needs to keep an eye on that mad brother of yours." He said absently, eyes closed, relaxing against Mycroft.
A small smile tugged at Sherlock’s mouth. “I find those terms acceptable.”
When they pull apart, breathing faster, Mycroft sits next to John and cups his chin, holding him still as he whispers, “My turn,” before leaning in to claim his lips.
John chose not to acknowledge the near slip-up. “Right,” he said with a swallow. “Ok. Are you sure that it’s healing? It still burns. A lot.”
“So, do you, uh, approve of your brother’s choice in husband?” John asked after a couple of minutes, turning towards Sherlock.
Until now, Sherlock had touched him, frotted against him, given him so much pleasure….but he had never done so much as press a finger inside of John’s most private place. Sherlock watched him intently for a moment and then reached into the bedside table. He pulled out a new tube of lubricant.
You: John leaned down and mouthed his cock through the thin fabric for one quick moment before standing and walking down the hall to the bathroom. He paused in the bathroom doorway and stripped out of his clothes completely and turned on the hot water.
Breathing harder, John blinked up at him. “Sherlock, you’ve just cut me in 10 different places. Of course it hurts.”
Mycroft sighed and re-crossed his legs. “Brother, I know I once told you that caring is not an advantage. I suppose, over time, that one can change his attitudes…”
John quickly read through the information on him. His eyes lingered over the opposite page, where Gregory Lestrade was listed as claimed by Mycroft Holmes. His deep brown eyes smiled up at him. Mycroft’s sigil, also marked in blood, depicted the same lion but with a coiled snake in front, its head rising and tongue sneaking out.
John flushed and glanced away from his friend’s knowing gaze. “Umm…”
“But it’s only visible to other vampires. And if it’s permanent then I would always be – be protected by him, right?”
You: No? Last week! We talked last week about. You can't run around...naked. -JW
In the loud silence that follows, long, talented fingers entwine themselves with John’s.  “Well, I suppose this means you get me to yourself,” John says somewhat hesitantly.
John’s attention was on what he could see of Greg and Mycroft descending the staircase when he was slammed against the wall and held there in an iron grip.
Sherlock kneels next to his prone flatmate and runs his fingers teasingly over the muscled chest, alternatively light and heavy and pinching and gentle, learning and mapping every response. He smiles  when John arches up when Sherlock presses a nail into a tight nipple.
“Ah, Sherlock! Mycroft insiste sul fatto che questo boccone saporito appartiene a voi.”
“Oh.” John sits back, perplexed, brandy in hand. “I told Sherlock about tonight weeks ago. I didn’t think it even registered in his mind.”
Somehow that wasn’t what John had expected to be doing on his first day of service to a member of one of Britain’s oldest vampire families. He looked down at his own clothes. The slacks and sweater suddenly seemed rather lower class. He shifted, feeling under dressed.
him. Mycroft has, over his years, made it a special mission to not form attachments. Emotions, attachments, these are not strengths to him. This is the first time that he has
Sherlock relaxed into his chair but said nothing.
mortals. He’s a help at crime scenes, if a bit of an arse. I mean, think about it. He doesn’t have to be. Most of them don’t care what we humans do to each other as long as we’re around to offer ourselves up as contracts.” Greg winced at the last word.
“Perhaps. I’ve had you lie down so that you don’t feel dizzy.” He idly rubbed John’s neck. “Are you ready?”
Stranger: Sherlock moaned, "We- we need lube. And to prep you." He panted.
“Yessss,” Sherlock hisses. He jerks his hips, creating friction between them. His fingers dig into the back of the loveseat as he grinds against the man beneath him.
You: John moaned softly. It was better than his wanking fantasy. Much much better. He reached up behind him blindly and pulled Sherlock's head down by the hair and kissed him,.
“How about starting with the rope after I take a shower? I could do with washing off the grime of today.”
Sherlock groans softly and speeds up. He silently urges John on, willing him to come apart. Suddenly, John’s eyes open and he stares down into Sherlock’s. He’s so...intense. Sherlock gasps and can only continue, caught in his eyes.
You: John sighed and turned away, flushing slightly. "Ok. Want tea?"
Just what does John think he is doing?
“Yeah, those,” John said as he stood up.
John managed a small smile and stepped closer to him. He swallowed nervously but squared his shoulders.
When John tasted a bit of blood, he pulled back and let himself go. He came deep in his husband’s body, grunting at the effort. John collapsed on top of Sherlock and lay there, panting. Sherlock lowered his legs and winced. He’d almost forgotten that they were still tied together. John gently rolled them onto their side and helped Sherlock keep his top leg high up on John’s hip.
“Yes, when he asked ‘how would you know?’” Sherlock blinks slowly. “Sorry. Shouldn’t have said anything,” John says after a moment of silence. He goes back to his magazine.
“Why did you choose this mark? Greg said it puts me under your care until I die!”
“Mr. Holmes, take as long as you and your John here need. Please ring me via that button there,” he pointed to an electronic base on a table next to a sofa, “when you are done. I will need to inspect the mark to ensure that its placement and image match the registry. Then you will be free to leave. When you’re finished, there is a private exit through that door. Your driver can meet you outside of the building.”
Mycroft’s long fingers grab John’s hips as he sets up a strong pace, allowing himself to let go and give into his baser instincts to rut like an animal. As he pushes in and out, reveling in the tightness of John’s passage, he knows his hands are probably forms bruises on his hips, but he simply doesn’t care. Watching his brother losing control and being sucked off is too arousing to last long, but he keeps going, willing himself to keep his open and on the beautiful sight before him.
In awe, John runs his hands over Sherlock’s splayed thighs. “Whenever you’re ready,” he says.
Stranger: Not at the Yard. Was chasing a suspect and he hit me with a pipe from around a corner. Sally's typing for me. At hospital. GL
“Well, what can I say? I must admit that the question of your sexuality remained a bit of a mystery for quite some time. And then this opportunity presented itself."
Stranger: Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist and lightly bit his lip, his tongue prodding against John's lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
John laughs. Sometimes his life is simply too bizarre to believe. Having Sherlock Holmes as a flatmate has been exciting, challenging, and sometimes maddening. John thinks that now he’ll have to the word ‘pleasurable’ add to that list. He sighs happily and meets turns to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
“I believe I enjoy seeing you like this, John,” Sherlock says, his voice soft and low and rumbling.
John sighs and arranges his bow tie again. He taps his finger nervously on the plush leather seat of the limousine.  He’d been bought by some old lady with lots of money who chattered away endlessly next to him. Her name is Annabelle. She has three prize poodles who appear to take up most of her waking hours. He sincerely hopes she isn’t going to make a pass at him, but she keep patting John’s knee soothingly in a manner that reminds him of his granny. Perhaps she only wants to discuss her arthritis and have some tea. John can only hope.
Mycroft inhaled sharply. He was always astounded by the beautiful way that Greg submitted to him, but now he found it nearly overwhelming. He snarled, grasped Greg’s thighs and pushed inside in one powerful thrust.
Mycroft chuckles softly. He unzips his crisp slacks and silently guides one of John’s hands to the opening. John gasps when he feels the hard cock pushing through the opening. The idea that Mycroft Holmes goes commando is probably going to ruin his image of the stiff politician forever. His fingers curl around the shaft and he starts to rub, eyes pinned to where his own cock is disappearing between Sherlock’s lips.
Stranger: Sherlock caught a brilliant idea and silently made his way to the kitchen, wrapping his arms around John'a waist and whispering into his ear. "You should take off your clothes too, John. It's really too hot in the flat."
“Possibly,” Sherlock replied. He watched John intently.
“Mmm, that’s a fact is it? Budge up for me, love?” John wriggled out from under him and carefully picked him up and laid him gently on the plush carpet before the fire. Sherlock was lying spread out like an erotic buffet. He knelt next to him, enjoying the vision of Sherlock, long and lithe, wriggling erotically with his arms pinned behind his back.
“Simul sanguis is also sufficient.”
Chuckling, Mycroft knelt between his soon-to-be-mate’s spread legs. He slicked lubricant over a medium sized butt plug and gently worked it into Greg’s hole. When it was seated, he ran his hands lovingly over his silk-wrapped thighs. “I’m afraid I can’t wait any longer, Gregory.” His fingers dug into Greg’s shins. “I have been hungering for you…”
It was late afternoon and Greg watched Mycroft pad around the kitchen from where he sat on a bar stool at the kitchen island. He gratefully took the offered mug of tea. The vampire sat next to him, mug of tea in his own hands.
“A bit indisposed at the moment, but otherwise I appear to be in one piece.” He shifted and winced.
“Congats, mate!” John said, pulling Greg into a hug. “A  married man, huh?” He grinned.
“Did he feed after you asked?”
Stranger: Sherlock saw this and continued to finger his lover open just to tease him and added a third finger, drawing out the preparation.
“Well, he grows on you.” He eyed John. “Sherlock seems to be growing on you.”
, is somewhat private.” John snorted. “I know, amusing considering how much he pries into other people’s lives. But honestly, he does care for his brother, and he wants to know that things are ok between the two of you.”
“Got me there,” Greg replied fondly. He walked a couple of paces and turned back to Mycroft with wide eyes. “There’s no way Sherlock will miss this!”
Mycroft silently took the mobile from his hand placed it on the table. Beneath him, Greg relaxed into the couch as his lover nuzzled his neck.
The pub was loud and busy as Greg brought the first round of drinks to the corner table John had staked out for the two of them.
Something made John look up into Sherlock’s eyes, and when he did he felt caught, like prey in a bright light. Uncomfortable as he was, he couldn’t look away as the vampire brought his wrist up to his mouth. Sherlock licked at the skin, smiling when John shivered. Still holding John in his gaze, the vampire bared his teeth and bit down.
“I’m sure he does. He’s not stupid, you know.”
“I’ll wait. You’re tired and I might take it to be an affront to my skills as a lover if you fall asleep now…even if it is from loss of blood.”
“Might I suggest that we take this to my bedroom,” Mycroft says, to which John nods in reply.
Shaking his head slightly, John sidled up to a nearby table containing a tasty looking hors d'oeuvres. Just as he was grabbing one from a silver platter, a voice said in his ear, “You still smell too tasty to pass up.”
Sherlock sets up a slightly jerky rhythm, his movements unpracticed but eager. Where other men would close their eyes and abandon themselves to the pleasure, Sherlock focuses his energy on John, watching his face, noting every moan and grimace, the way that he lips part just a bit as his head tilts back. His hand’s movement on their cocks becomes more sure. He discovers that rubbing his thumb over the tip of John’s cock makes him cry out in a way that almost sounds as if he’s in pain. He does it again, revelling in the knowledge that now, at this moment, he is the one making the mild-mannered and soldierly Doctor John Watson rut against him like an animal in heat.
“Does this mean you’re not angry with me?” Sherlock asked, his voice low.
“I would have thought that you would jump at the chance, brother.”
Surprised, John’s head snapped around and he found himself staring into the intent eyes of Sherlock Holmes. John swallowed at the sudden feeling of having all of Sherlock’s powerful mind focused solely on him. He didn’t bother to ask how Sherlock even knew what he was thinking. “Right.” He offered up a bit of a smile and a nod. “Oh. The bowing at the end. What was that?”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft says slowly, as if reminding him of something. The brothers lock eyes, and John has the distinct impression that he’s being talked about. His eyes flick back and for between them.
You: After getting Greg settled, Mycroft slipped off his shoes and socks and padded silently to the kitchen. He prepared a plate of the ravioli and pulled out one of Greg's favorite beers. He brought it into the living room on a tray and sat on the couch next to him. He picked up half a ravioli on the fork and held it up, eyebrows raised.
“Ah. Erm, thank you?” John says, rubbing the back of his head. Mycroft chuckles to himself and sits on the love seat next to him, legs crossed casually as he sips the brandy watches John. John feels like he must have fallen down the rabbit hole and bumped his head. Finally he settles on one question. “We?”
“Has probably had at least four energy drinks since he woke up this morning,” Sherlock said with a snort. He looked around. Mycroft had arranged this suite for their honeymoon in Paris. They had spent the wedding night at Holmes Manor, and not surprisingly, they had both collapsed into bed exhausted. He tried not to think about John beneath him, naked…he shook his head and walked to the window. They had a view of the Eifel Tower. It would be a beautiful view at night, he mused. Speaking of beautiful…he turned to where his husband was sitting on the couch. Husband. The word sounded odd to his mind.
“No,” Lestrade said firmly. “It’s too late for you to wheedle your way out of this like we’re in the middle of some sort of political negotiation.” He glanced at John for a moment before turning his attention back to his boyfriend. “I think you need some direction, love. I think you need a spanking.” In the complete silence that followed that line, he clasped Mycroft’s chin and slowly directed the younger man to look at him. In response, Mycroft Holmes looked down, silently submitting with a single nod.
“Thank you – thank you ladies and gentlemen for your generous donations. Barts and the London Charity certainly appreciate your funds.” The MC smiles broadly at the well-dressed crowd sitting at tables bedecked with champagne and flowers. “ Just a reminder, we don’t want to know what you do with them later, as long as it’s consensual! Just return your volunteer in good condition tomorrow. And remember it’s all for charity!” The crowd laughs with him as he winks good naturedly at an 80 year old woman sitting in the front row.
“I don’t wish to hurt you. Or myself,” Sherlock replied.
“I remember when my father, your grandfather, walked me down the aisle. I barely knew your father, of course, the times being different then, but he looked so handsome standing there waiting for me. If only he could be here today…”
John gave him a tight smile.
The Registrar looked down at the book. One page was complete, the other empty. He smiled. “Ah, the last individual to come here from your House was your elder brother, Mycroft. I assume that they are still happily engaged in each other’s company?”
“Well. You could find out. Come to our place for dinner on Saturday. I’m sure something will arise that will require some…attention.”
“I didn’t say anything,” Greg said, putting on an overly innocent voice.
“Why?” John asked.
Sherlock sighed inwardly and finished adjusting his tie just as Mycroft walked in.
Sherlock blushed. Actually blushed under everyone’s gaze. John sat back and raised his eyebrows at him in question. In one fluid motion, Sherlock lay down on his stomach across John’s lap.  John took a moment to take in the image of his lover like this, lithe and flushed and oh so hard, a hardness that he could easily feel digging into his thigh. The dark pants and shirt are a stark contrast to his pale skin.
John sat with a plate of thai basil beef at the kitchen table. With the first bite he realized how hungry he felt. “Is it supposed to knock you out like that?” he asked between bites.
Mycroft padded back to the bed and untied the ropes and gently rubbed Greg’s skin to get blood flowing again, placing soft kisses on his bare skin. After several minutes, he smacked Greg’s thigh.
John pondered that. There were any number of medical miracles waiting to happen with that bit of knowledge. “And the other half?”
“Thank you, John. I do have a flat in Mayfair. It’s closer to the office, but this has always been a retreat from the city. I do hope you’ll be comfortable during your stay here.”
When John emerged a while later, skin hot and steaming, Sherlock was lounging on the bed. He had taken his jacket off and his feet were bare. He was wearing a purple shirt and he had undone several of the top buttons, teasing with bare skin for anyone who cared to look. John was suddenly hit by arousal. Now that they were there, alone, his body was starting to respond and he could feel himself begin to harden.
Greg shrugged. “I wanted to know what was possible. But I – well, I didn’t want to scare you off by bringing it up.” Greg flushed an buried his face in the crook of Mycroft’s shoulder.
“If I touch your cock, will you cum again?” he asked, lips just behind John’s ear.
“Which is?” John asks.
John’s wrenches his mouth away and watches, eyes wide, as Sherlock licks and sucks at him. It’s possibly one of the most erotic things he’s ever seen.
John locked eyes with Sherlock and then lowered them, slowly tilting his head to the side, offering up his silent submission. The vampire’s eyes darkened and he growled softly.
“Then this shall be a new experience for you." Sherlock smiled, showing his fangs.  "You know, many find the experience…enjoyable.”
Mycroft smirks at his younger brother and raises an eyebrow in a questioning challenge. Sherlock glares but nods once and hits the submit key. Mycroft sits back and smiles.
Greg grimaced. “I can imagine.” He paused. “Mycroft is my partner, my boyfriend, if you can apply a label like that him. And I am his donor. And yes, he feeds straight from me. Regularly.” He smirked at John, who gaped at him.
Sherlock pulled back and rested his head against the wall next to John’s head. “John,” he pressed himself bodily into him, pressing him against the wall. “I believe I need you.”
Stranger: A shudder ran through Greg's body when Sherlock cupped him through his trousers. Moaning softly he trailed his hand from Sherlock's hip and brushed his hand against the growing bulge. "I can see." He whispered attaching his lips to Sherlock's again.
Sherlock sat with a smirk in a plush wing back chair and crossed his legs nonchalantly.  “Well, she does seem calmer than at your wedding.”
“You look so handsome! Sherlock Holmes is one lucky man.”
You: "Need you in me," John breathed. "Please!"
John took a step back automatically and bumped into the kitchen counter. Sherlock was looking down at him with an intense stare that seemed to cut right to his soul. The vampire’s eyes, bright and sharp, slowly made their way down John’s body, taking in every detail. John had never felt so naked. He glanced down, feeling vulnerable under such scrutiny. When John looked up again, the vampire was gone. John was alone.
“Now now. I’m sure the impulse has crossed your mind before now.”
“And you’re making him tea. So…attentive.”
John watched Sherlock with wide eyes and then moaned softly when the vampire licked his chest. The skin healed up in front of his eyes with the help of the vampire saliva added by Sherlock’s sinfully sensuous tongue.
The room settled into silence, all eyes focused on the pair in the middle of the room. At some unseen signal, Mycroft helped Greg stand. He silently released the tie around Greg’s waist and pushed the robe to the floor. Greg was completely naked underneath and lowered his eyes. Mycroft quickly removed his own robe, revealing himself to the gathered witnesses. The vampire took Greg’s hand and guided him to sit on the bed cross-legged before settling into the same position across from him.
“"Questo non è né qui né là, cugino. Dico che è così, e la mia parola è definitiva in questa famiglia."
Lapping at the blood, Sherlock glanced up at John’s face and chuckled. “Yes, and what does that make you?” he asked, jerking his hips.
“Oh. I thought you understood,” Sherlock replies, sitting back, perplexed.
“Hush,” Sherlock whispered before he leaned down and kissed him.
You: *My lips
You're chatting with a random stranger. Say hello!

“Wow,” Greg breathed. “It’s...really sensuous.”
“John…” Sherlock murmurs, running his hand over John’s bare chest. “I think, over time, I should ensure that I properly experience – everything. For the sake of the experiment, of course.”
The door flew open and Sherlock Holmes walked briskly out and closed the door behind him. “You’re here. Good. Come along then.” He walked quickly past John, who scrambled to turn around followed him. Sherlock slipped gracefully into a black sedan that had appeared smoothly from around the corner. John climbed inside somewhat more awkwardly.
John laughed. “I did invade Afghanistan, you know,” he said with a snort. “I don’t frighten easily. Especially after having….” he trailed off.
Smiling, Greg pressed his lips against Mycroft’s, feeling his love for the vampire well up in his chest.
Stranger: *lead
Then John smacked Sherlock’s hip, making him groan. “Think I could make you cum just like this, love? Think I could make you cum if I spank your delectable arse?”
You: "Ah. So what do you plan to do today then?" John turned a page, having not read a single thing on the previous one.
John swallowed again and licked his suddenly dry lips. “I’ve heard that.”
“I don’t suppose you could wait until later to do that, Sherlock?” Mycroft interjected, from where he leaned against Greg’s side on the sofa.
“I haven’t had a personal donor in a very long time. Not since I was much younger. And it wasn't like this is between us.”
Sherlock pulled John to him and urged him on. John started a brutal pace, pushing deeper and deeper until the swelling of his knot was beginning to inch its way into Sherlock’s body. Beneath him, Sherlock’s hips pushed up to meet John’s powerful thrusts.
“And?” Sherlock asked.
When the men on the couch break apart, Mycroft says, “Goal orientated as usual, Sherlock.”
Sherlock looked up at him, and John fought the urge to step away. The man’s eyes were dark and violent. His fangs were extended and claws had grown out of his long fingers. He growled in warning. John slowly knelt in front of him, ignoring a heated argument nearby between several officers. He reached out a hand slowly and gently pried Sherlock’s hand away.
“May I reminder you that you have no claim on him, Sherlock. However, if you would like to discuss this further, I may have a solution.” His eyes flick up to where John is flushing as he answers that, yes, he is single.
Mycroft grasped Greg’s knees and spread his legs. “Oh lovely. I’m going to enjoy taking your virginity.” He teased a finger tip down Greg’s cock and balls.
Stranger: "Rather unobservant, don't you think?" Sherlock chuckled, leaning up to press his lips to John's and gently nipped at his bottom one.
“Mycroft Holmes?” John asked, eyebrow raised.
Sherlock lightly grasped John’s wrist and sat on the sofa, guiding John to sit next to his unwounded side. Sherlock unbuttoned the cuff and rolled up the sleeve, revealing John’s wrist and forearm. Long, pale fingers ran almost teasingly over the soft skin on his inner wrist. John swallowed.
Stranger: Any time, just doing my job. He's got a couple of stitches, a concussion, and they forced a tetanus shot on him, he's in a foul mood. He keeps asking for you, don't tell him I told you that. SD
Greg followed. He paused as he passed by the sofa where their guests were situated. He leaned down and said softly, “The second door on the left upstairs. Guest bedroom that’s setup for you guys if you want.”
“Oi!” John said, spanking his hip. “Back into position.”
You: "That's too bad," John muttered. And then louder, "Ok, thanks!"
“Delightful. So very tempting, isn’t he?” Mycroft says, his breath tickling Sherlock’s left ear as he leans close to whisper.
The vampire rolled his eyes. He stepped forwards and pushed John into the warehouse wall, pinning his hands at his sides as he did. “I’m sure that your…master won’t care. He probably won’t even notice. Come now, puppy, play nice,” the vampire said in a soothing voice that belied his dangerous intentions.
Stranger: Greg tilted his head a bit further to the side, deepening the kiss and stepping closer to the detective so their bodies were pressed against each other.
“You’re utterly gorgeous, Sherlock. I don’t think I tell you that enough. Though you’re even more gorgeous like this, all open and wanton…” John pushed Sherlock’s legs open and knelt between them.
You: John groaned, head thrown back
“Sorry,” John breathed out. He tugged just a bit and knew there was no way he could escape. Not that he wanted to.
The kiss is raw, full of the emotions that John has always half-feared, half-hoped that Sherlock held in check under a carefully controlled exterior. The possessiveness that John felt before rushes up, pushing against his temples as he grasps Sherlock’s biceps tightly and returns the kiss with full fervor.
“Yeah, I’ve got a 10am date with a vampire. Don’t want to be late,” John said grimly and slammed the empty glass down on the table.
You: Sherlock blinked up at him from where he was sitting. "You want to see me? Why?"
Sherlock frowned and looked back at the slide. “My brother should stay out of what is not his business.” His eyes flicked to John briefly. “But he is correct.”
“Are you ok with it?”
In the bedroom, Mycroft and Greg lay on the bed, tangled in each other, eyes closed. They both dozed, content in the knowledge that Sherlock and John were keeping watch. Eventually, Greg opened his eyes. He watched Mycroft. The vampire was sleeping and looked completely at peace. He thought he could feel something different, like he knew that Mycroft felt at peace in a way that went beyond sight.
“Your – hypothesis?”
John gasped but held still as now two long fingers pushed deep inside of him, opening him up. Sherlock’s grip on his leg was hard, and he knew he would have bruises. John rolled his hips, urging the vampire on.
John shuddered and pulled his legs up even more. “Yes,” John said to the unasked question that hung in the air.
“Right. Ok. Do I need to do anything to prepare?”
as I take from you, so that we forge a bond that ties us, soul to soul, unbroken, undying, and sealed.”
“Thank you.” Mycroft’s smile was slow to form, but genuine.
“Do I take it that you agree to this, then, Dr. Watson?”
Greg lifted himself on his forearms. “See something you like?”
“I appreciated that you looked after me so well afterwards,” he said, caressing Mycroft’s cheeks.
“Very good. 20, and I won’t make you count this time.”
He looked at his watch; it was 10:00am exactly.
Stranger: Sherlock huffed and kissed over John's throat, sucking several hickeys into his skin while he thrusted harder and deeper into John.
“And this is the first time that Mycroft has spent so much time with someone like Greg?”
"Oh, really? I see no claim on him. He smells divine. Surely you smelled him?”
Sherlock smirked when he saw John’s reaction. It was dangerous, playing this game with the man lying beneath him. Some humans became addicted to the feeling of being hurt by a vampire and then the subsequent feeling of the skin healing quickly.
“Yes, the slowed aging and improved - “
Mycroft winced internally, having preferred to put off this particular discussion. “I was rather hoping you’d forgotten.”
“Well, I enjoy it, too. But yeah, makes him randy as hell.”
“Shit. Myc don’t
Sherlock smiled wryly at him from where he was doing up the buttons on the brocade waistcoat. “It is fitted perfectly for you, John. And you look utterly delectable.” he murmured.
“Not there,” John said, glancing down to where Sherlock touched him. Silently, he titled his head back and to the side, showing his bare neck in blatant invitation.
Stranger: Sherlock looked over, pupils blown a bit more. His hair was rumpled from lying on the couch and his lips were swollen and red. "No Cluedo."
he feels strongly.”
“Usually, I don’t allow him to wear hit shorts for a spanking, but I’ve let this go considering the…audience,” Greg said. Mycroft turned his face away from the other men in the room, his pale skin flushing. Greg ran a soothing hand over his back. “Now, why do you deserve to be punished?”
You: John groaned, head thrown back
John takes a deep breath, reaching the edge of his patience with the seemingly endless roundabout conversation. “Sherlock! What the bloody hell are you talking about?!”
“Smells amazing,” John said.
Stranger: "I've got a hostage then, hm?" Sherlock murmured, leaning down to lave his tongue over one of the hardened nipples while his fingers pinched and teased the other. "I'll keep you until that gorgeous detective of yours comes to save you," he winked.
Sherlock, for once, stayed silent. His sharp eyes watched John through a haze of lust. John lay down so that his face was just above the tempting bulge in his boyfriend’s shorts. An inch or two away from touching with his lips, John paused. He could practically feel Sherlock straining upwards. With a grin, he licked a wide stripe up the bulge, causing Sherlock to groan. John did it again and then blew on the now wet area. With a grin, he repeated the process until Sherlock was a helpless writhing mass on the floor, utterly at his mercy.
They stay like that, just lightly touching, until Sherlock presses forward. When they kiss, it hits them with an intensity that throws John off balance. He grips Sherlock’s arm and waist, moaning softly as the other man’s hands run over his body. It’s as if Sherlock is trying map out his body with his long aristocratic fingers.
“Ohhhh,” Sherlock groaned.
“So…what did this Alessandro want? He’s your cousin?”
“Now John, we wouldn’t be taking care of you properly if we allowed you to finish yourself, hmm?” Mycroft leans closer. “Sherlock and I intend to take care of you…completely.”
Mycroft laughed. “Ah. Yes. We’re not so dissimilar from humans. We’re getting married. We’ll have a wedding. You’ll get to see Mummy in full wedding-planning mode. But then, afterwards will be some things that we don’t share with outsiders.”
“Well, that’s good. Some people don’t mesh with the vampire that claims their contract and I hear it hurts like a bitch. In those situations, they usually use syringes to remove the blood and store it.”
John thought of his acquaintances. The human ones. He couldn’t imagine many of them having anything negative to say. He was, after all, in the service of a vampire under contract. How much choice did he actually have? He shrugged in return. “I try not to get involved too much in politics.”
You: "More," John whimpered
"Questo non è anche la tua azienda fino a diventare ufficiale, se mai."
Taking the smile as acquiescence, Sherlock smiles just a bit and reaches his hand out, boldly palming John through the blanket.
“But some don’t,” Sherlock continued. “I shall endeavor to make this fast, and only take what is needed.”
Stranger: Greg smiled up at Sherlock, his eyes softening. "I got you to smile." He said with a small laugh, subconsciously leaning closer to the detective, and moving his wrist a bit to try and lace his fingers with Sherlock's.
“I want to keep you safe. Protecting you is my responsibility.” He paused. “Don’t ever tell Mycroft I said so. He’ll be offensively smug for a week.”
you wished to discuss today?” he asked, sharp eyes noting how Lestrade pointedly did not sit down.
“Yesss, John,” Sherlock hesitantly runs his hands over the plains of John’s back. To John, it feels like the other man is mentally mapping him, learning every angle, rib, and curve. When he gets to  the mass of scar tissue on his left shoulder, he pauses, his touch softening, becoming gentle.
much worse for wear. Now let’s see that mark…” Melbourne grasped John’s chin and, ignoring a warning growl from Sherlock at the touch, examined the wound. “Sigil is clear. Wound is clean….It looks fine. You are free to leave, Mr. Holmes.”
Sherlock sighed softly. “John, don’t you trust me? Or at least, don’t you trust Greg? He survived, obviously.”
“Am I bleeding badly?” John asked as his medical training came to the forefront.
“How does it feel?” Sherlock asked, poised above him.
“Fine. I help around the house. Cleaning for now. And he’s brought me to crime scenes to help.”
John blinks. His mind is foggy and it takes a moment to place the words. How would you know? “Ah. You mean…about – sex?” John blinks several times the way he does when he’s nervous.
“I know. I have also taken the liberty of ordering several new pairs of shoes for you. They will be delivered this afternoon.”
Stranger: In one slow movement, Sherlock was pushed in all the way with a soft groan. "John...." He sighed. "You feel so good."
Stranger is using Omegle's mobile Web site (omegle.com on a phone or tablet)
You: "Mmm," John replied, kissing back. He pulled Sherlock onto him, their bodies flush and heated
Sherlock saw John’s bravery rise and he smirked. “My brave, John,” he purred, stalking forwards slowly. “Such spark for life.” In an instant, he lunged forwards and pinned John to the bed before the human could react. “Mine,” Sherlock murmured.
Mycroft nodded and softly said what might have been, “Yes Gregory.”
“Whatever he said seemed to make you upset.”
Stranger: Sherlock's strong hands ran over John's skin, making sure every part of his body was covered in soap.
“Also, you and I will be able to…feel each other.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Sherlock’s voice was low and dangerously soft as he prowled around them into John’s line of sight. He took a deep breath, feeling a bit safer with Sherlock’s presence.
John silently poured himself a cup of tea and added the sugar and milk. He cleared his throat softly. “So. Anything planned for today?” he asked the silent kitchen, voice a bit tighter than normal.
