‘Hello, sweetheart’ Pam cooed as she entered the room in her long lacy dressing gown with an enormous mug of coffee. ‘Did my beloved early bird catch a worm yesterday?’
He didn’t bother to make up some original answers because the whole conversation was something he had had many times: small talk, business talk, whatever-the-fuck-talk, touché. Frankly speaking, that contract was a honeypot for Seraph and a dead end for Morningstar. The latest was bounded by terms of its agreement with a third part, and that third part coveted only Seraph Enterprise to work with their beloved contractor. It was unprofitable for Morningstar, and they had already done their best to sabotage that contract, or at least to provide any delays possible, and Seraph finally managed to bring them to heel.
Dean was tired as hell after his long shift at Roadhouse and only three and a half hours of sleep. At one moment he was fixing an old Mustang, and the next moment he was lying on the couch in his boss’ office surrounded by alarmed colleagues. He was told that he fainted after he bent to have a look at what was under the hood of the car. It was pure luck that he didn’t fall on the hot engine with his face.
Obedience was not a virtue of Dean Winchester. There were few people who Dean paid respect to, and others were helpless to make him act along their ideas. Unfortunately, he had to adjust there, in the clinic. He was a victim of medical lawlessness, how he called it.
When Jo came bitching about endless lines to all-gender stalls and rabbits who can't wait to fuck at home, Castiel looked enchanted. Jo winked at Dean and faked a yawn. Dean called taxi for her and gave her money to pay it, and Castiel suggested walking her to the cab to make sure she was safe. After she left, Castiel kissed Dean at the very place they stood.
Jo and Pam weren’t surprised at all when Dean said he was leaving. They threw a party which was meant to be half-goodbye one and half a replacement of a wedding party (since Dean said that Cas was the reason he was leaving). Girls were happy to know that Dean had finally found someone good, and concerned that it was a little bit too fast, and repeating all the time that they envied Dean.
‘Dean, please talk to me’ Cas was almost pleading. ‘What’s happened? Was it about me saying that you sucked me – ’
Sun was shining relentlessly right in his eyes. Dean woke up reluctantly and yawned with a loud moan. His voice was low and hoarse from the sleep.
He looked back to the magazine he was reading. The woman muttered something about him not liking their laws and going back to the godforsaken place he was from, and Dean said that for sure he would in a year, but as long as he was there he would like to help as many abortions as he could.
'I got it' Dean smiled as he nuzzled the bulge. Castiel's legs were shaking and his hand was hovering over Dean's hair, seeking for a grip. 'You're afraid I won't let your monster cock in my ass 'cause it won't fit? The fact is I don't care'.
He’d have to choose eventually, he though. And he couldn’t choose the only option he really wanted to be – a full-fledged man.
‘Please officer’ He said yieldingly. ‘I am going to the service station right now. I’m aware that it’s dangerous, and I’m going to fix it immediately, so probably we could just let it slide?’
‘Sam Winchester’ the answer was almost immediate, through James heard a lot of ambient noise on the background.
'Sounds interesting' Cas said, and Dean realized that Cas' manner of speech wasn't strange because of medical terms he used - it was odd in general. It seemed like he used the longest appropriate word possible for every expression.
‘I got it was a blind date and one of you ditched the other one.’ She shrugged. ‘It happens. What are you going to do next?’
Dean inhibited his desire to rebuff because somehow it made him even harder. Castiel looked so dominant there, half-naked and barefoot, in his slacks only, and so confident in his desire Dean couldn’t help but whine. He liked Castiel's reasonable tone and his smart words and how assertive he was without stopping being sexy.
After everything what he went through that morning, James laughed. He decided that he could stay in Lawrence for one night waiting for roads to get fixed. It was not a big deal, after all. When his taxi came, he asked to take him to the motel Meg advised him to stay in. He even let her to wave him goodbye.
Dean didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye before she slammed the door behind him. He heard her steps getting quieter and quieter before she disappeared behind the backdoor of the building.
Under average size, sweaty smell, slightly sour taste. It was nothing to remember, nothing Dean hadn’t seen or tasted before.
Dean was silent for a moment. He turned his face away trying not to look at the doctor. She was in a black blouse, with heavily applied dark grey eye shadows and gaudily red glossy lipstick. She looked like an intentionally highlighted zone on a stage among the grayish non-distinguishable background. It made her look like a character of a video game who was about to give a quest to Dean. The only thing she was lack of was a golden pixilated circle around her chair and a hot key hint beneath it.
He made a pause that was supposed to make Dean want to continue his phrase, but Dean screwed up his face.
He dove into the door and approached to a young woman on the reception. She raised her tired face to James and asked with a slow, apathetic tone:
‘Why?’ Dean almost cried. Why the hell his guardian angel dared to look away and let that fucking shit happen to him?!
'Don't bullshit me with that biblical stuff of debts. Besides, your body is not for pleasing men. It's for you to take pleasure, and you can have as much sex as you want or don't have it at all. And if you want to thank me, use a condom next time'.
Surprisingly, Castiel was a good cook. He served a perfect dinner with baked salmon, potatoes and green salad. Dean was not a fan of fish and seafood, but that was delicious. They head a pear pie for dessert, and Dean started to salivate just smelling the scent of it even before he saw it.
Anger came second: and it was the longest stage. And that was why Sam decided to place Dean into a mental institution. Dean was intractable and mad. Every time someone said something that contradicted Dean’s perfect world, Dean was ready to rip them apart. He felt like everyone tried to deride him, and he fought back, like he had been always doing at school when someone tried to bully him or his little brother. His life became a constant fight, and Sam couldn’t help but address some professionals to at least conclude an armistice for a while.
Dean didn't notice that he put his head on Cas' lap as the other man was sitting on the floor with his back to the wall. Cas' fingers were hovering over Dean's hair, willing to stroke it, but he hesitated.
Dean struggled hard through his mind to remember the date in his vessel's document. 'Twenty-seven' he said but he wasn't completely sure, though.
As a man, Cas knew nothing about what Dean’s life was, Dean remembered himself. He would never understand it, so no point in holding your breath, he was a regular asshole, just a polite one.
He was in denial, when he had heard it for the first time. He thought that he was dreaming, maybe concussed, or probably it was a psychological experiment carried out by the Army. Dean recollected his previous life really dimly; however he had a feeling that his past had a strong connection to military life. Sam told the last time he saw him Dean was a car mechanic, but everything was possible after Dean vanished. That part Dean believed in: he was definitely good at fixing car engines and kind of loved doing it. But the rest was ridiculous, and it took weeks to Dean to understand that people around him actually believed that bollocks they talked.
'From the pool of sorrow I'm drowning into right now' Cas' smirked, and Dean figured that it was a joke. Fuck it, he thought, Cas was cool.
‘Don’t be so pliant before you see me’ Castiel chuckled before he got rid of his shirt. ‘You may change your mind’.
Castiel opened his fly and Dean did the rest. He pulled Castiel's slacks down and mouthed his covered cock through the boxers. The fabric was too thin to hide how beautiful Castiel's cock was. Dean got rid of those boxers and nuzzled it. It smelled salty and musky with a glimpse of sweat and Dean stuck out his tongue to taste it but heard a strict 'uh-uh' from above.
Hit or miss, James thought, he could try. Maybe some stupid employee of that nuthouse would tell him something that he could use.
He wanted to get out of his jeans instantly to see it and touch, but he was interrupted by a painfully familiar voice:
Except for James Novak himself felt like he had supplanted someone. It wasn’t his life and he was wasting his time on succeeding in something he didn’t give a fuck for.
Castiel hummed behind him, clearly enjoying his reaction. He teased a bit, not shoving his fingers inside, and Dean heard a pathetic whine. It took him time to realize the whine was his.
Dean decided that it was a sign. Like, if a soul wanted to stay in a body, any futile crap could be a sign to carry on. So he did.
So, when he was told to follow the hospital aide he paid no heed on how unexpected it was and just followed. The girl who led Dean passed through the wing, took the service stairs down, and soon they were in a small storeroom Dean had never seen before. He dawned upon that their walk was not a part of his cure. The girl pulled a bunch of keys out of her pocket and struggled through the tough lock on the door. She took a doctor's overall that was hanging on a hook next to the door and handed it to Dean.
That day was no different to others: James woke up, evacuated his bowl and bladder (without any urge to; it still seemed like a postmodern joke that he had to do it every day), showered, carefully trimmed his beard to make it look like always-three-day stubble, rammed his high-protein breakfast down his throat, and get dressed for the day. When he came to his workplace, the assistant told him that he has an appointment in a conference room, and James followed her instructions amenably. At the time he entered the premise, there was already a person there.
Good for the girls, they didn’t mention anything about Dean’s night out. He wasn’t in the mood to gossip around, and he had no guts to brag because he was... scared. Cas’ presence in his life seemed something god-given, but God had sent him only plagues and no blessings so far.
It was a young, tall, good-looking guy with longer hair brushed back in a shipshape manner. He was tanned, fit, wearing a good suit. Everything in him was saying that his life was more or less perfect, that he was a professional at his business, and that he was ok with who he was. Exactly how James looked.
He was sitting like that for like an hour before he decided to call a taxi. James asked the waitress for a local taxi number and called it, but the lady on the wire said that all taxis were busy because of the god-awful weather, and the James had to wait for at least two hours to get his car. He agreed and got back to his place.
'Hm, probably you're not' Cas said mostly to himself. 'But I'm curious though, what's that with me being religious or not. Not a question you can hear often in such circumstances.'
There were Charlie, his friend since high school, and her charming girlfriend Dorothy. Dean was a bit afraid of her; Dorothy was tough and quick-witted.
All that Dean did for his family. He was going to say goodbye, and he didn’t want to spoil it by making them adjust to his Debbie Harry look.
Castiel fished out a bottle of lube from the folds of the sheets, poured some onto his hand and rubbed it between his fingers. He reached out his hand and touched the small of Dean’s back. Castiel’s hand slid down to the crack of Dean’s ass and Dean leaned forward to give him better access. He plunged his middle finger into Dean’s heat and Dean moaned.
'So what? Are you trying to hint on the universal power of your love to me which would prevent any bad things to happen to me, or you're meaning that you wish you were there? You can skip answering cause both options are nuts, man. I told you already, don't play with those
'So in the end I decided it would be better for Mom, Dad and Sammy to live without me. First I tried to kill myself,' Dean said it like it wasn't a big deal, as if everyone was thinking about it every day and world still hadn't exploded 'But they reacted fast. It's hard to fight for your own death when you're unconscious, isn't it? So they put me to the hospital for teens like me. So next time I was smarter and just left instead of swallowing pills. The only thing I took was father's car, and it was just because it's harder to run with no wheels. Now it's the only thing that I have from my family'.
He was the same size when his dick was cut off. Dean could still remember it, it’s size, it’s girth, and it’s weight in his hand when he jerked off. Dean liked to jerk off when he was a teen, even loved it. He wanked his sensitive penis every morning and every night. It was the first thing he did when he woke up and the last thing he did before falling asleep.
‘No, brother, it makes sense. Like, you know, people who talk deliriously, they have moments of clarification, right? Do you know how many such moments have I had? Ze-ro. Whatever they give me, whatever they drug me with, I stay delirious. So maybe I’m sane, just not in that world’.
The doctor sighed again, opened a dark red folder she held on her lap and pulled out a motley piece of glazed paper, which appeared to be a photo when she handed it to Dean. There were three people posing on the picture: him, in huge hippy-dippy plastic sunglasses, with an opened bottle of champagne, his brother Sam with a fuzzy garland over his neck and a glass in his hand, and a young blonde in a silvery mini dress, with her arm around his brother’s waist. There was a sharply white sign
'Fuck it, you're too good' Castiel muttered and carefully moved back, pulling his cock out from Dean's mouth. He kept his hand on the back of Dean's head, and Dean had to stay on his knees and look at him like and obedient cocksucker... it riled Dean up.
It was dark outside. The washy picture of evening Chicago was blurring through his full-height window. It was raining. Typical late autumn rain, plentiful, but totally softball.
At the moment he wanted to call back, everything faded away and he woke up in Cas’ bed with his still emasculated self, weak and tiny, next to the firm, delicious body of his lover.
tw: noncon, rough sex, unsafe sex with unreliable partners, blood, mentions of STD, drinking to cope, kidnapping, child abuse, suicide thoughts, suicide attempt
It was a silly song, but Dean felt like a warm wave enveloped his heart. He didn’t even understand that we smiled before James asked him why.
‘May I buy you a drink?’ A deep voice asked next to his ear. Its owner was handsome and radiated sinful vibes. Dean needn't to be a demon to feel it.
Castiel’s bed was something to remember. Being human soon taught Dean that flesh loved convenience and coziness, and from his time as a demon he remembered that sight loved style. Castiel’s bed made favor for both flesh and sight: it had a solid dark metal frame with the king of king sized mattresses on it. Once being pushed onto the mattress, Dean felt it flexing under him still sustaining its wonderful shape. Although he had various sources of pleasure already boosting him, Dean couldn’t suppress a moan when he realized that his old sunken sofa was rather a flesh mortification tool.
He did as she told. He behaved well at the session with the therapist: answered her questions and was bitchy enough for her not to suspect anything. He went back to his ward then, collected his belongings and put them into the pillowcase. Dean was not allowed to have his duffle bag with him, and Meg, that girl, said that she couldn’t risk and ‘drag his purse through the entire clinic to him to feel pretty’.
Mom was the only person who he told it to. After the dinner, Dean took her to their garden and confessed that he would never come back again.
‘As you wish, dear’ Castiel slapped his ass playfully, quickly slicked his dick, and pushed it into the tight heat of Dean’s ass. He moved slowly, constantly alarmed by Dean’s reaction, ready to stop at any glimpse of Dean’s discomfort but Dean didn’t show any. His body was naturally accepting the intrusion.
'You mean a hickey?' Dean chuckled. He would slap a man in a face any other time, but it sounded so alluring for unknown reason. 'Be my guest'.
‘Exactly’ Dean answered. ‘Well, you might think that I made this up in the moment I saw you, but here I have some proof’. He disemboweled his impromptu pillow and pulled out a plump writing book.
James Novak was certainly the man you would like to become in case if you came to be a human being on Earth.
Dean stopped to think for a second whether it was good or bad for him. On the one hand, he wasn't sent to Earth with a mission to debauch human beings, quite the opposite, he had to become one. It was appropriate for him to lose some part of his demonic nature and to acquire some humanly treats. On the other hand, it was too fast, and right now he could barely tell if he had those treats from the beginning.
Dean bit his lip heatedly. The police didn’t confirm that they were after Sammy, and Dean had never told it to anyone, it was just his speculation. Cas was the first to hear it out loud, and, said out, it sounded like a silly surmise.
‘Dean, I’m not squeamish at all. It’s all about your and my safety. I didn’t want to get in the way while you were turned on, but if you want it now I can tell you what kind of diseases...’
Ok, Dean told himself, stop overinterpret, you can't know what's going on in his head. But Dean was too empathetic, and he knew it. When your entire life depends on your ability to catch a tiny glimpse of emotional change of a certain person, you become empathetic very fast.
On the back of his mind Dean understood how fucked up it was. His mind was so worn out with giving a socially acceptable reaction to the weirdest shit that had happened to him, so it gave out a totally fucked up reaction when something good finally happened.
‘You can take it back, sweetheart’ she said and put a bank note onto the table. ‘I’m Meg, by the way’.
‘Come on, I’m not after your dignity, I’m not even sure that you have it.’ She made a pause, and then took the yard and put it back into her pocket.
The cop next to Dean jerked and gawked at Novak like a doe in the headlights. Dean didn’t know what would happen next, but it was an interesting plottwist: Novak was very, very familiar with what Dean was hiding beneath his pants.
Dean winced. He knew it would happen, and it happened. He told his whole - well, the closest thing he ever had to 'whole' - story to a real person, and the person was so under the impression so he had to fix it for that person somehow. Cas was shocked, and the reason was Dean. And instead of relief that he hoped for, Dean just got a new crying baby to change an emotional diaper. Awesome.
Castiel stood behing him, grinded his dick against Dean's ass and opened his fly with a swift, skilled motion. But he didn't touch Dean's cock as Dean expected and went straight to his hole.
‘Please, sir’ Dean insisted. ‘I just can’t handle a delay, I have my –‘ Dean picked over various types of relatives in his head, what would stir up more sympathy – ‘little son waiting for me, and –‘
‘Who am I to disallow’ Dean shrugged and closed the door as Novak finally let him. He started the car and headed home. Headlight or no headlight, Novak’s car behind him was a one-hundred-percent guarantee that no policeman would dare to stop him.
The feeling James had was oddly familiar. He felt like… he had failed multiple times, and that failure was nothing in comparison to his other, worse fuck-ups.
When everyone in the clinic went to sleep, Meg skulked into Dean’s ward. He was pretending that he was asleep, but after she called his name Dean got up. He arranged his pillow and blanket so it looked like there was someone on the bed. Dean took a white coat Meg gave him and put it on. He could bet that he looked weird, dressed like a doctor with an improvised pillow in his hand. But no one was going to see them, anyway. Floors were empty as Meg was leading him towards his escape.
Dean cursed silently. The last thing he wanted was his Baby to be taken to police impound and him being forced home in a police car.
Cas was the one who was worth it, and the only one who didn’t allowed that to himself. Dean didn’t want Cas to refrain from getting what every men before him had already gotten.
‘Can’t even imagine how it feels like to be a father of a three-years-old son’, James said, and his words suddenly seemed weird to him, like he heard them through the water. ‘Might be great’.
‘Date?’ James frowned. ‘It was not a date. If you expect me to give you another yard, you’d better try your luck somewhere else’.
‘Dean, I admit that I have no idea of what you went through, and I do not pretend that I understand your feelings nowhere near. But if you at least allow yourself to accept my help, at least try to understand why my ‘version of reality’ is inadequate for you, you may feel better. We have a long path ahead; I do not promise that it would be easy or fast. But to get through this path, you should make a first step. And the first step is to allow yourself to answer the question: why does this ‘version of reality’ hurt you so much?’
‘Is it what?’ Suddenly Castiel’s voice was very close to Dean’s ear. ‘What do you want to know, sweetheart?’
'I...' Dean didn't know what to say. Mostly, he wanted to hear that Cas' was raised religious but lost his faith because of reasons.
Castiel fisted his hair, and Dean moaned around him. He couldn't take the whole lenght but when the head poked into the back of his throat Dean tried to relax and managed to let the whole head in.
‘It’s me, Dean’ It was Cas. The last person Dean wanted to enter the room while he was in that condition.
So Dean took a shower, washed all his limbs and cavities (there’d never been a day he’d touch his crippled crotch without a tiniest glimpse of regret), did his hair and his face. He ran his hand up his cheek to confirm that he had to stubble; it would probably be a problem if he would took some testosterone injections. Dean hated to choose what he needed more – his Debby disguise or the last parts of his ghostlike masculinity.
Dean never considered running away from the clinic. It had been always the same procedure: he got into the clinic, received some ‘intense therapy’, pretended to get better; then his therapist decided that he was ready to go back to his life outside; then he visited her twice a week, and at one point she had to call Sam to say that his brother Dean was relapsing again and that he required ‘special care’.
‘What a fucking hell, Dean, do you realize that it can clap you into the nuthouse forever?! Do you understand that?!’
‘Hey sweetheart, how is it going?’ Charlie asked. ‘Don’t answer. Those bags under your eyes speak for themselves’.
‘Oh, I remember’ Castiel turned around abruptly. ‘Gabriel told me about it. Maybe you are uncomfortable with me going around naked?’
The man was beautiful. He had sinewy arms, strong legs, retracted belly with some visible abs, and a tattoo on its left side, right under the chest. But there was one thing that astounded Dean more: Castiel was hung. His big, thick cock was flaccid between his legs, but it still was the biggest cock Dean had ever seen in his life. He felt his mouth watering when he stared at that gorgeous dick. Dean was halfway to beg Castiel to let him praise that divine cock of his, when Castiel finally noticed him.
Dean knew that his doctor, that nasty puppeteer, was in charge of everything. She mostly broadcasted her sick ideas to Dean through her personnel, and Dean had to comply with their instructions, even most unpredictable and ridiculous ones.
Dean promised to think about it, but he was sure that it was not a good offer for him. First, it was too good to be true, and second, he was too tired to change anything in his life.
‘How could I forget a guy who you’ve violated all my rules for?’ She teased. Jo had all rights to be curious, and even mad, since Dean had broken the primal rule of the Roadhouse – ‘No sex with clients’. She had forgiven him, of course, but knowing how actually loyal Dean was in all other terms, Jo and Pam died to know what was so special about that legendary cop.
But it was still too dangerous to keep risking himself like that. So Dean made the only decision he could at that situation: he called Dorothy’s friend to apply.
Dean joined them at lunch, and through he thought it would be difficult for all of them to rejoin after everything what had happened, it was almost perfect. It reminded Dean their dinners that they had back then before that tragedy happened to him. They smiled, and laughed, and through Mom was still over-caring, and Dad was afraid to look him in the eye, and grown-up Sammy looked like a stranger, Dean loved it. He found out that Sammy was about to leave for college, and realized that Mom was hoping for him to come back to live with them. He almost promised that to her, but it would be too cruel of him to give her hope.
But Dean had to stop himself. First, Castiel was his employer. And second, he was a rich bitch with presumably unbearable personality. And yes, Dean wasn’t supposed to give his unbearable employer nicknames, even just in his thoughts.
‘Well, Dean, and now I have the privilege to introduce my brother, Castiel Novak. He is a one-hundred-years-old baby. Just do what he needs, not what he says’.
Because generally, with very little exceptions, all men’s communities were centered around having a dick and enjoying the dissimilarity to those who hadn’t. And you can’t enter the club of cyclists if you don’t ride a bicycle, right?
Gabriel and Kali spent a night at the place and left early in the morning. Dean didn’t even have time to say goodbye.
‘What’s the problem?’ A low, gruffy voice asked from behind. Dean looked back and saw a grumpily looking older guy with a unkempt beard.
‘That’s why we’re unprepared’ Meg shrugged. ‘Come on, Lawrence is a good place to spend a night. I know a good motel’.
‘I don’t remember all the details. They asked me to recall after, you know. For the court. They tried hypnosis on me. Everything I managed to recall was the morning after’.
The bathroom was not that good; well, it was impressive, large, with a cast iron bath on lion legs, but it was
'You were too eager' Castiel responded honestly. 'There are not a lot of men who love to be fucked in earnest, and even those who do, they prefer to use condom. It's not... the most pleasant side effect of come in the ass, if you know what I mean. And it's not safe, by the way'.
Dean was incredibly tired. And he didn’t care. Everything that he thought was real was impeached by his therapist. Everything she told him was farcical to Dean. The only true thing in all that psycho theory was five stages of grief; Dean passed them all.
'It took seven month for the police to find them and put me back to the family. But the irreversible had already happened. They could heal my wounds and make stitches nicer, but they couldn't bring my dick back, and there was no point to make a prosthetic device. Probably just to hide that void in my pants, but it couldn't hide the lack of height and hair, and the medical insurance of my parents didn’t' cover hormonal therapy. But it fucking covered compulsory psychotherapy. I hated it. I was forced to sit in a moth-bitten armchair two times a week and to talk about what I'd prefer to forget forever'.
The other thing that made James feel superior to others were his slim to none corporeal needs. The secret of his impressive productivity was that he didn’t get distracted by lunch during the day and needed really short sleep at night. He had to put an alarm to eat, because he believed that he had to. His body felt healthy and fit without any physical activity, even his physician had acknowledged it. And the most unfamiliar part for him was to feel sexual desire. Well, James had experienced some forms of fleeting attraction to various people, but he never felt urge to have sex, as if his body was completely out of a breeding race and didn’t want to produce its genes in next generations.
‘I know what you were thinking when you left your home. You spent a night in a Flora motel, and you couldn’t sleep. You were in the lobby, you watched their TV, and it was a rerun of Coyote Ugly. You saw the scene where the heroine was singing One Way Or Another song among the crowd of angry drunk sports fans, and you recalled you listening to Blondie, and you decided to become Debbie Harry not to be Dean Winchester anymore.’
‘The girl has just said that. That song was released in October, 2000. So your brother graduated not before 2001’.
‘Call me Castiel’, the man said briefly and turned to his brother. ‘You shouldn’t have called me a baby in front of Mr. Winchester. He would think that I’m legally incapable, and it’s not true’.
He didn’t even notice when the girl from the clinic came in and plonked herself down in front of him. She apparently had been sitting like that for a while before James noticed her and flinched in surprise.
But Cas surprised him again when he started to tease Dean's hole with one lubed finger as he bent down to Dean's back and kissed it tenderly close to the neck. Dean shuddered.
They stood like that, as if they suddenly became trapped in time: Dean with his hands on Cas’ shirt, his fists weak, and Cas barely looking at him, his beautiful blue eyes were full of tears.
‘Honestly, yes’ Sam Winchester was no different to others. ‘I miss my wife and son. Have never been leaving him for that long. Fortunately, I’m leaving tonight’.
'Got it' Dean murmured grumpily and grabbed the condom. Castiel's taste through the condom wasn't that mind-blowing Dean imagined when he smelled it but the feeling of the hot heavy girth on his tongue compensated it in spades. For a brief second Dean forgot that it wasn't about soothing his mouth, and just held it like that and enjoyed the feeling. Castiel didn't rush him but stroke his nape comfortingly. Dean gulped and started to move. It wasn't that easy with Castiel's size, and Dean begrudged mentally that human body was such a weak tool. And yet, his body performed rather good. Dean thanked that Winchester boy for preparing their meat suit for everything a fellow demon may need.
‘A friend of mine is looking for a – I don’t know, butler – for her, I guess, brother-in-law. He’s a brother of her fiancé, to be correct. These guys are really well-off, but while Gabriel is a normal guy, his brother is quite… special’.
Dean hated to shotgun but he had no choice: it would be too bold even for him to ask if a local stripper could drive a police car. Cas drove carefully, gently, probably too slow by Dean's taste, but he was definetely in Dean's top three drivers, the number one of which was Dean himself. The ride was easy so, and Dean started to slip into drowsiness what he usually had when a loud and bustling morning turned quiet and his constant attention was no longer required.
They laughed, and gossiped about Jo's boyfriends (spoiler alert: they were jerks), and ate Chinese. Jo appeared to be a perfect candidate to be Dean's first human friend.
‘He doesn’t need a nurse’ Dorothy chuckled. ‘He is healthy as a horse, he’s just… peculiar. As Kali said, he needs one person to do it all because he just can’t get on with more than one person at a time. And yes, he pays well’.
The therapist didn’t say anything, but by her a bit too delicate caught Dean understood that he dug his own grave and that she was a whisper away from giving up being professional and saying some shit like about a plane being a phallic object.
'Well... you can say it like that' Cas shrugged. 'They mostly consist of jerks who don't give a fuck about people suffering for their prosperity, or of people who are too scared to lose that hat they have to say anything against those jerks. So being me... please stop me before both of us are wet'.
‘Come on’ Dorothy smirked. ‘Charlie and I have been dating for a year, and I wouldn’t even know you’re into men if she didn’t tell me’.
‘I’m bi’ Dean muttered. He was offended by obvious truth. And the truth was that he hadn’t been having sex for a year and a half.
‘What’s going on here?’ The voice that suddenly interrupted their dramatic scene was sombre, deep and very familiar.
Sam hurried away. He couldn’t remember himself such an acrimonious piece of shit, but he didn’t care.
‘Dean, your life is work, and we don’t see you often. Tell me, when was last time when we saw each other and it wasn’t you shift?’
‘Better yet, you had twice as many opportunities to fuck them up!’ Sometimes Dorothy was relentless. ‘Well, anyway: he pays the same amount that you have from your cars and your bar, you don’t have to pay rent and food, and you can sleep at night. Don’t even dare to reject it’.
The whole mansion made an impression of long-faded grandeur. Dean could imagine days when it was good and modern, but now it was abomination of desolation. Through being furnished with expensive antique furniture, that place was unfit to live in. Dean was scared to imagine how Cas sustained that place and how he managed to live and even cook in it without fear of occasional fires or a short circuit.
‘What kind of friend?’ Castiel looked alerted. Dean could read his concerns in his eyes. Adultery was a sin. Lying was a sin. And Dean suddenly hated both.
Dean came hard all over his stomach and chest, and realized that he was doomed from now on. Even if this
They passed through familiar little yard where Dean had met James in the morning. Meg opened a barely visible wicket door and made a gesture that looked like something between ‘welcome, sir’ and ‘get the fuck out’.
While they were on the road, Dean couldn’t stop thinking about what a risky venture he jumped into. Probably, that guy wasn’t a psycho killer or a mad scientist creating monsters in his basement, but he still could be a grumpy crazy man who would yell at him and break things on purpose.
James caught taxi and headed to the airport. On his way he called the airport well-care office and found out that next flight to Cali is in 2 hours and 50 minutes. He smirked to himself. No one in this world deserved to be trusted. James had million reasons to hate lawyers, but their love for chicanery was definitely on top five.
Dean sighed and got down on his knees. The cop helped him unbuckling his own belt, so Dean just had to drag the cop’s boxers down and pulled out his dick.
Sam froze at the doorway, staring at Dean. His face was… desperate. He looked like a man who was losing something precious and who, at the same time, had already made up his mind with inevitability of it.
‘You don’t look like a person who believes me, Dean’ Castiel said and smiled. That time his smile was nothing like his smirk before, it was kind and sweet. ‘I’ll prove you that I’m not squeamish, okay?’
‘Fuck you, damn you’re pervert’ Dean snapped and got up on his feet in a blink of an eye. He staggered back as if Cas was a venomous monster.
‘Do you think I care?’ Dean imitated Sam’s almost hysterical intonations, mocking him. ‘Admit that killing God at least is not judicable, opposed to killing the President, or last time I checked it wasn’t, but you know better, lawyer Sammy’.
Creatures of his kind usually didn’t pick US as their first choice to incarnate. America was fun and had lots of entertainments but it came fitted with tons of restrictions. Those who wanted to blend in and take root chose Europe with its freedom of everything but hate, while fans of cruelty and iniquity enjoyed full pack of touristic attractions of Russian cities and third world countries. Dean just wanted to make fuss, so he chose the land which was packed with various sinners.
Dean leaned to the table to take an ashtray and put it onto his bare chest. Mornings like that, he didn’t give a fuck about his half-feminine-look. His hair was messy and half-covered under the sleep mask which Dean wore in a manner of a headband. He had no makeup except for what was left after his yesterday’s not so thorough removing. He wore more or less unisex dark blue cotton panties and a bath robe, and that was it. Among his girls, Dean never felt it necessary to cover his chest. They knew what he was and almost knew how he had become it. Dean was never willing to give details to them.
And still, he was clinging to that tenderness, trying to get as much as he could. Dean threw back his head to give Cas better access to his throat, and Cas used it immediately to peck tiny kisses onto Dean's Adam's apple.
It didn't look like Castiel lamented his mistake, though, and Dean was curious about what let him out.
James Novak stood on the street, staring after Sam Winchester leaving, and felt like he was in a cheap knock-about comedy. He flew across the country to get one damn signature. And he failed. He was fed up with that Leslie Nielsen crap, but the universe seemed to not care. His unchangeable, perpetual luck disappeared and left him weak and lame.
They came to the place at sundown. Dean got out of the car and saw the mansion. It looked even weirder that it was on photos. It was big, surely too big for one person, it was dark like horror movie scenery, and it was… gothic. There were wrought iron gate, withered rosebushes, old wooden double leaf doors, heavy window shutters, and cleaved grayish statues of something what looked like gargoyles.
Christian-inspired puzzle house, Dean assumed that he could sign out soon if he could find right answers. He tried to hack the system that confined him on principle of ‘I play along with your crap – you play along mine’. He failed. They called Dean’s playing along ‘recovery’ and his demand to be played along ‘relapse’.
‘You?!’ James hissed and tried to shut the door, but Dean put his foot between the door and the side-post.
'If you wanna call it that, that's be it' He said vaguely, avoiding the word drudgingly. 'Do you?..'
‘Wait, lady, I think I know what you’re looking for’ He wobbled to the back door and came again in a minute, holding the exact lamp Dean ordered.
Bobby, his boss, was really concerned. He told Dean that he had to have a break, probably a week of good, healthy sleep, before something bad happened.
Dean was ready to plonk that guy right to the floor and ride his beautiful big cock because his level of dominance was fucking unbelievable.
‘Nothing. I don’t need anything to stay awake. It’s natural. Anyway, you wanted to tell me something about Sam Winchester’.
Dean didn't learn anything about Castiel's apartment because he didn't give a fuck about it. His hightest priority was sucking on Castiel's tongue and groping his crotch. If it was not for Dean's organic repulsion to anything divine, Dean would say that Castiel kissed like god.
Castiel’s covered cock was rubbing against Dean’s hip – so fucking hot and heavy. Dean couldn’t wait to have that cock buried deep in his hole. He spread his legs wider, as wide as he could without losing the contact between his hip and Castiel’s heavy dick.
tw: dubcon and non-consensual practices when sex was consensual in general. Also some oral het sex mentioned.
‘Well, Dean, I… I do want to believe you. I do want to find out that you’re right and that everything you saw that day was true. But… you know. Your memory is cheating on you. You know, Jess is alive, and you were not in 9/11, and…’
But his madness was a good hook to catch him and his conceited brother. James decided to play along and declared that he has no idea why he was there. He imitated hesitation. He had used that trick thousand times: if someone accused him of lying, James pretended that he’s ashamed and afraid, and then he told another lie, but more… passionate.
If asked, James couldn’t remember anyone he could have been saying it to. He didn’t have a person who trusted him that much, and he didn’t have a person he appreciated that much to feel guilty for. Didn’t have and hadn’t ever had. No strings attached. No bonds. But the memory seemed so real it hurt.
There were only two options: or Sam Winchester has a flaky relative, or it was his high school love who attempted suicide because of their big unforgettable love to him, and the latest was highly doubtful.
Dean figured what Castiel meant once he got on his knees and mouthed Castiel's cock through his slacks. It felt hot and huge, and it twitched as Dean's face contacted it. Dean had never been that close to another man's cock but by the outline under the fabric he could tell it was bigger that his. And girl Dean sinned with told he was well-endowed. Dean gasped.
Dean liked it when Cas was making love to him as well. He liked to feel Cas inside, hot and pulsing, and to feel Cas’ hands around him, and to feel Cas’ lips on his. Dean liked tons of hickeys that Cas’ was leaving. He liked it when Cas was coming inside him, and it felt nice instead of disgusting. And fuck he loved to come untouched marking both himself and Cas with his white sticky come.
Winchester let James’ collar go and stepped back. James decided not to respond. He knew sometimes to shut up and let people talk.
Yet Novak could take a side: a junkless bitch or his brother in arm. His choice surprised Dean, indeed.
‘Finally it’s you, Dean’ Dean shivered at the grievous desperation that filled it. ‘I though I’ve lost you forever’.
‘You’re just the same, you think everything is turning around you, bitch? No way! It is my problem, it always was, and always will be!’
‘It was never because of you!’ He yelled. ‘I know you for one fucking week. It’s not about you at all!’ Dean knew he was about to cry, and he couldn’t burst in tears in front of that man.
Dean knew that he was going to screw it up, and he accomplished successfully. Cas would probably got disgusted to use the same bare mouth his fellow brother in arms had used a night before.
Dean told her that he was one hundred percent sure that he had never raped anyone. He was almost ninety-nine percent sure that he even had never watched porn with rapes; his kinks were far cry from it. Dean occasionally had sex while outside the clinic, and he knew that he liked it rough sometimes, but never forced anyone to anything. It wasn’t even a taboo; it just squicked him. It was like his mind was separated in two zones, where one zone was for pleasure and the other was for violence, no intersections.
He was tall, taller than Cas even. He wore his hair very short, but with longer strands on top, and ‘longer’ meant that sometimes he could brush them back to look like a gangster. There was matching sandy stubble on his square, manly jaw, but his lips were still soft and feminine (and he secretly liked it). His shoulders were broad, his back was wide, he was strong and handsome. His legs were bow a bit, but his ass was very... well, when Dean was looking at his ass he allowed himself to doubt that Cas remade his body based precisely on how it should have looked like naturally (through Cas swore it was exactly what he did).
‘I didn’t say anything like that’, Dean said with a faraway look. ‘She made it up herself. Listen to yourself, Sam, I’m not that kook to decide to kill the President of the United States’.
But the most impressive part of Castiel was his eyes. They were blue and radiant, and Dean couldn’t remember if he had ever seen another person with this eye color for real.
‘Don’t torture yourself; it says all roads of Lawrence suffered somehow from this pouring rain. They’ll fix it, of course, but not before tomorrow’.
He stood in front of the door of his bathroom and dried up his hair with a towel arduously. Dean couldn’t help but froze and stared at Castiel’s naked glory.
Castiel’s fingers clenched on Dean’s hips as he came, nails buried deep in the soft skin. With a slight shade of disappointment, Dean realized that Castiel had a condom on. It wasn't a surprise, taking into account his lover's prudence, but still Dean wished Castiel came right into his ass. A man can dream, right? And demon can, too.
First before all, Dean found a real job (not for his gay purposes, just to quit pickpocketing). His vessel was a mechanic and his hands knew how to do the job instinctively. After his first paycheck Dean asked Jo if she was up to be his wingwoman in a gay club in exchange for a free drink. He wasn't the one of them two who really needed company. Jo was so sad after her getting rid of the fetus, and Dean didn't want the poor soul to befriend Jesus instead.
So that, there was no surprise that one day he found himself sweating guts out with his three jobs to be able to find money for Sammy, who was currently away for Stanford. Dean was a full-day car mechanic from Tuesday to Friday, all around handyman on Monday and weekend, and he was a bartender on standby in Roadhouse whenever he was needed. He was talented at everything he did; and he was extremely tired.
Cas was silent. Dean could see in his eyes that the truth was too terrible to tell. At least, Cas though so.
Castiel walked on by Dean, heading to his bedroom. Dean exhaled with relief when Cas was finally behind him, but some mischievous devil told him to turn around and to look at Cas’ tempting ass.
‘Say to you lawyer, Mr. Winchester, that if he wants to talk, I gonna be waiting for him behind the building next to the staff’s smoking area in half an hour’.
He was sick and tired of being kinky. He was a kink himself, and god, was it tedious as hell to be one.
In a mere second Dean jumped to the door, opened it, and dragged Cas inside by the hem of his shirt.
‘I’d like to fuck you’ Dean said, and Cas raised his brows, surprised. There was a shadow of a smile on those tender lips, and Dean cringed at a thought that Cas would start mocking him for that idea, but Cas just gasped:
‘You miss Cali, don’t you?’ James said with dexterously faked compassion. ‘I know that our climate is not that Eden-like, but it’s not like it doesn’t have its benefits’.
It was that type of fall rains which could last forever. They fell, and fell, and fell, and bubbles were rising on pounds, and roads turned into streams. James hated that messiness, through he loves rains. He decided to wait it out and to leave for Chicago then.
At the first touch Dean shivered. His body responded instantly. He became weak in knees, his already hard cock twitched, and he felt like his entrance... relaxed? That body wasn't definetely new to all that.
He didn't even think that Cas could get mad and kick him out of his car, through he should have thought about it. Dean realized that he said something wrong, and he turned his head to see Cas' reaction, for the man said nothing. Instead of irritation or anger, Dean saw that Cas lowed his head, looking at his hands on the wheel. He looked anything but angry. The most accurate word for that would be 'sad'.
Everyone knew that Dean Winchester was a good man and that he could do everything for his brother Sammy. He was a kind of momma bear because he was able to rip a guy apart if he threatened his little brother. Literally. On hearsay.
He could remember that prom pretty much well because he saw Sammy dancing, but they fought three hours after because Dean was supposed to bring him home and Sammy wanted to spend the entire night with his girlfriend. But he also remembered the photo his therapist showed him. That Millennium celebration, with him, Jess and champagne. Sam definitely looked like someone who was allowed to drink. He couldn’t be sixteen on that photo. He looked like twenty-four or something.
James cursed through his teeth. It was a freak-out situation. He wasn’t pissed off, not at all. He had in mind just two things: one was maniacally cold, sharp intention to excoriate their company lawyer for being blind as brickbat, and second was to call Sam Winchester and to ask him to assist in fixing that unfortunate slip.
‘Why?’ Dean whispered, and he couldn’t tell at that moment what he was asking about precisely. Why hadn’t Cas come earlier? Why did he come now? Why did he tell that? Why had he fallen in love with Dean in the first place?
‘It was nice to meet you, James Novak’ Winchester said, stepping back. ‘My name is Dean, by the way. Just in case… if you recall something’.
Dean heard a small laugh before Cas sucked onto the side of his neck as his hand opened the fly of Dean's jeans. For a brief moment Dean thought that would gladly submit to Cas even if he was normal. If he was big and strong, if he could bend Cas over the table and take him mercilessly. Dean realized that even then he would enjoy Cas leaving marks on his neck, holding him tight against the wall in a place where everyone could see them, he would enjoy having Cas inside him, pounding hard, making him squirm and moan. He would love his extreme tenderness even if he wasn't that vulnerable and broken. He would love everything Cas would give him in any circumstances.
‘I swear, Dean’ Cas tried with the last he had. ‘I don’t lie. I know everything about you. You mother used to sing ‘Hey, Jude’ to you instead of a common lullaby. Your house was on fire when you were four, and you ran for your life with little Sammy in your hands. And that silly figurine of a chubby angel that you mom put on the shelf above your crib? You hated it, remember? But you mom said that angels watched you, and here I am. The angel who should have been watching you without taking my eyes out of your path’.
He considered himself some kind of a rain man, high-functioning autistic person maybe. He never wanted to probe deeper. He was content just knowing that he differed from others and that he would never be able to make a solid connection with a red blooded person. Perhaps, it was that that made him so attractive for people: a tiny glimpse of mysteriousness, otherworldly charm multiplied by his sexy mundane exterior, like he was a romantic character purposefully written for a prime time melodrama.
Dean stepped forward, not knowing if he could extend his hand for a handshake. He had never greeted rich people except Gabriel, but Gabriel did it first and there was no awkwardness in the air.
Dean didn't have a clean-cut scheme of his visit. His main goal was to make people sin but he wasn't sure where to start. In the end, he decided to go outside and let the destiny lead him. His plan for tonight was the first sin he would hear about.
‘My name is James Novak, and I and a friend of your …’ the man didn’t have a chance to finish because of a sharp sound of thunder above them.
He had read about it: some drugs usually could bring such an effect. But he was sure that he didn’t take any drugs, no way.
‘Well,’ he said, pulling off his jacket and tossing it aside. ‘You’re so brilliant in explanations. So, doctor – ‘ He jerked the collar of his T-shirt so impulsively it ripped apart, baring his left shoulder with a thick and prominent red burn in a shape of a human palm of a hand. ‘How do you explain this?’
The woman at the counter gave him a stern look while Jo was filling the papers. Dean realized she was thinking he was the father. He beamed at the woman and grounded in the waiting room after he carefully handed Jo over to the nurse. But the woman was persistent and kept asking Dean loaded questions. He warded off with syllable answers till she finally asked him why didn't he marry Jo instead of sitting there, quote, 'like a jerk'.
Dean startled. Well, the fire was something that a proper stalker could learn from a meticulous investigation, and his memories, they could be spilled out during his hypnosis sessions. But for unknown reason he wanted to believe Cas. He just couldn’t.
‘You don’t remember? Wait, I’ll show you…’ Winchester tugged the collar of his own tee aside and showed his bare shoulder. He had a stain on it that looked like a burn. James looked closer and realized that the burn had a perfect shape of a palm.
Orange rays of sunset were filling the room, and it made crumpled grayish bed sheets look like they were printed on old sepia photo paper. Dean turned a little so he could see Cas’s face. The man was beautiful in that light, and Dean couldn't help but think how tender his lips were, and how sweet and domestic he looked like that.
Well, Dean, it looks like an elementary school kid is describing his favorite movie character. No offence. I have very significant eye color, indeed, but I still don’t see why it couldn’t be just a coincidence’.
'Sounds cool' Dean said but his words barely expressed how cool it sounded. Dean's prime desire should be to kick that confidence out from the legs of that man, to break his will and to make him do something he would regret till the end of his pathetic life, but for some reason, Dean felt nothing but respect and urge to kiss him.
Loved, because jeez, someone finally cared. Hated, because he wanted Cas to take all pleasure he could get from his crippled body.
‘You like it?’ Castiel said as he moved his fingers slowly in and out. Dean nodded and exhaled deeply with a hiss. ‘Yes, I see. It might be awhile, but your hole knows what skilled fingers can do’.
Dean knew Lawrence; well, he had a mastercopy of its streets and buildings in his head from his memory about events that apparently had never happened there. He just polished that experience with new impressions that he had got from living there between his ‘relapses’. Sam did his best to make Dean’s life outside of the clinic... sustainable. Dean got an uptown house (very nice through) because Sam was full of hope that decent life would prevent Dean from relapsing again. Dean was grateful, though, generally, he didn’t give a fuck about how comfortable his home is.
Soon Dean realized that not all unmarried sex was a sin. Jo, for instance. Dean enjoyed her company and visited her often, what misled her into believing that he was up to certain things. Jo kept hinting that she wasn't against having sex with Dean, but she did it out of need to be loved. It was the only way to win love she new, and it was sad but not sinful. Dean declared himself a no-strings-attached type of guy who didn't want to get in the way of her true happiness, and Jo muttered something about all good guys being gay.
It was kind of a want ad. Some owner was looking for a person who was ready to take care of his mansion. There were a photo of the mansion (it was old, huge and spooky), requirements (to clean, to maintain facilities, to take care of cars, and to entertain the owner), and contacts (a phone number and e-mail address). The ad was posted by an unknown man who wasn’t the owner, from all appearances, and reposted by one of Dorothy’s Facebook friends named Kali.
He spoke about it with such an 'i-don't-give-a-fuck' attitude Dean could feel nothing but urge to at least make out with him again. Weird.
Dean had been gawking at him for a mere minute, and then stood up reluctantly. Cas looked like someone who wouldn’t give up.
‘I had just met Jo an hour ago in front of your door. She needed my help. Your healthcare is so weird. You think people who can’t afford an abortion would be able to raise a child. Money don’t grow on trees, ma’am’.
'You wanna fuck my ass or me to fuck yours?' Dean panted as Castiel let his lips go to suck on his neck.
‘Everything I felt was pain and fear. I was bleeding, cause I plucked out what they put into what’s left of my...’ Dean shook his head. ‘They patched me up’. He smiled weakly. ‘And cuffed me to the bed. They let me go once a day, it was like two weeks or so’.
‘I didn’t expect you to come so soon’, Sam said discontentedly. He hated to be caught off guard, especially by that kind of people.
