Quick Cas POV at the start cause he also experiences gay panic.
Feeling a bit adventurous, Dean made a motion for Gabe to pay attention before laying one on Cas’s cheek. Gabriel raised an eyebrow and looked to Cas for confirmation of his suspicions. Cas shrugged and laughed as his brother started clapping and cheering. Dean laughed too. This truly was one of the best days of his life. The only thing left to do was to tell his dad...
“Yeah, her name’s Jo. Her shift was ending, and she was about to go home, but I convinced her to come to the dance. Her house is only a few minutes away, so all she has to do is go change and meet us here,” Charlie seemed very proud of herself.
“Nah, I’m fine. It’s just that I’ve got this big test on Friday.”
“Your friend is right. That probably isn’t wise.”
“You what?” Michael’s eyes widened.
“Thank you, sir,” Dean squeezed Cas’s hand as he spoke. “You have no idea how much that means to me.”
“Yeah?”
“Awe, the three words every girl wants to hear,” he batted his eyelashes jokingly. “Back at you, babe.”
“Understatement,” Dean, instead, mumbled. “First, I had the situation with my dad, then freaking out about impressing your family, and now we’re being attacked by a bunch of Karen’s,” he chuckled a little at how ridiculous that sounded.
“He can always go with you,” Gabriel noted. “I mean, if he wants to.”
“Yes, it seems that way,” Cas huffed a small laugh.
“You’re redirecting. Please Dean. Talk to me,” Dean could feel blue eyes piercing through him even though he couldn’t turn to face Cas directly.
“I know, but after everything with my dad, it feels more like centuries.”
“Did you tell him that?”
“Meeting ran late. Jeopardy tie breaker,” Cas mumbled as he steadied himself.
“I didn’t mean specific to right now, dummy. Although, I’m sure it’s still true. No, just you in general.”
“I have some homework I want to get done anyway. That way I won’t have to worry about it with the dance and everything,” Sam lied.
“Hi Charlie,” Sam shook her hand.
“My brother.”
“Do you want me to take you?”
“Nothing,” he mumbled.
“Hi Castiel!” A familiar mess of dirty blonde hair appeared around the corner, catching the angel’s eye and eliciting a soft smile.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Ok, um, you could coordinate something with the student council to pause the parade to ask him in front of everyone. That’ll show him you aren’t scared of what other people think,” Sam suggested.
“Ok, so you like it?”
“Why? He likes you, doesn’t he?”
“Gabriel does stand-up on Friday and Saturday nights at a comedy club downtown,” Cas clarified, still not making eye contact with Dean.
“You mean being human?”
“For once, Crowley’s right,” Cas chimed in, “Sexuality is fluid anyway, so it could change down the road. Just take things as they come. In the end, do whatever makes you happy.”
“Do you ever think about what life would’ve been like if we had gotten together sooner?” Dean leaned back onto the blanket, and Cas followed his lead, their hands still clasped.
“What is that supposed to mean?”
“Because of a lot of things, but yes, Dad plays a pretty big role in it,” Dean swallowed. “It’s just...you should’ve seen the way he looked at me, man. The anger aside, it was like he didn’t even know who I was anymore. I was a stranger and not his son. That shit has really been messing with my head.”
“Look, Cas already gave me the whole ‘live your truth’ spiel. I get it. I shouldn’t base my self-worth on what others think of me. I’m working on it, but this is really important, so can you please just be straight with me? Tell me it’s ok.”
“Just give me a few hours, alright? I promise I’ll tell you everything.”
“What’s up with you? You seem brighter.”
“Same with you,” Dean brought Cas’s hand up to his lips. “Though, I gotta say that what we have now is pretty great.”
“Regardless, I was actually referring to the moment after our dance when you…”
Later, Cas treated him to that movie day he had promised. They ended up using his computer rather than the television in the living room since it was old and wasn’t connected to the internet. Actually, the thing still had a VHS player because Michael was apparently partial to his old movies. Dean could respect that, although his taste in film sucked, so that’s why they resorted to streaming.
“But you are ok with it, right? Not just because you feel you have to be.”
I made a few edits because it occurred to me that I left out Miracle. She needs to be a part of the celebration too.
“He won’t resent you. He’s your family, and he
“It’s Sam,” he said sternly. “And no he isn’t. You’re willing to sacrifice your relationship with your sons to protect what’s left of your own fragile ego. I know it hasn’t been easy without Mom around, but you need to straighten your priorities or you’ll end up losing us too.”
There was silence for what felt like an eternity. A bead of sweat formed on Dean’s brow, and his body started shaking from anticipation.
“That’s ok. You’re questioning which is completely valid. This could give you a chance to reflect a little, and maybe you'll learn something about yourself.”
“Get inside,” John said through gritted teeth.
Before heading to the meeting space, Cas had them stop by the Home Economics department to pick up some food that the cooking teacher had been gracious enough to let him store in her room. Dean knew there was going to be snacks, but he was surprised to find just how much his friend had purchased. It was more like a mini meal. From the refrigerator, Cas removed a bowl of grapes, a bag of mandarin oranges, a plate of cookies, a bottle of soda, and some juice. He set them on one of the counters, and then reached back in to pull out a platter of sandwiches (nothing fancy, just the kind you could get from the deli at the grocery store, but still enough to make Dean’s mouth water). He motioned for Dean to grab a bag of regular potato chips and a bag of sour cream and onion chips from the cabinet too.
“That is not necessary.”
They were the first to arrive from the dinner crew since Dean had managed to miss nearly all the red lights, so they decided to just wait inside for the others. As soon as they entered the gym, Sam spotted his date talking to some of the debate team members by the punch bowl. Dean had never met Eileen in person, but he had seen photos and heard plenty of stories about her from his brother. Any other day, he could probably pick her out in a crowd, but the Eileen that was there at the dance looked much different than expected. Based on Sam’s descriptions, she was your typical tomboy. She was headstrong, loved the outdoors, enjoyed sports, and didn’t wear a lot of hyper-feminine clothing. She usually had her hair up in a tight ponytail to keep it out of her face, and didn’t wear a ton of makeup. However, that night she was dressed in a medium-length lavender gown with patterns of lace along the neckline and shoulders. She also had on silver high-heeled shoes, earrings, and eyeshadow with some glitter (nothing too drastic but enough to make her eyes pop). Her hair was then braided behind her back. Dean had to admit, she looked good. Classy, but still playful and fun. Overall, she was very pretty. Way outta Sammy’s league, though, so his brother better treat her right. If he didn’t, Dean would have to kick his ass. Though, if Eileen really was as tough as Sam said she was, she’d probably kick it herself.
“I can see by the look in your eyes how much you care,” Michael continued. “It’s a relief to know that Castiel has someone in his life that makes him feel loved in that way. For the longest time, I was afraid he would never find that,” he sighed when he saw the two of them join hands. “And now that he has, I am hopeful, but I admit it may take me some time to adjust. However, I want you to know that you have my blessing.”
“Is something wrong, Dean?” he asked.
“Thanks, Cas.”
“Right,” Cas nodded. “Just give us a few minutes.”
“Yeah, maybe this place won’t be so bad afterall,” he thought.
“Are you alright?” Cas placed a hand on his forearm.
Filled with excitement, Dean practically launched himself at Cas, toppling him over, and proceeded to smash their lips together. It felt amazing, as if his entire body was vibrating with hope and love and...wow...he opened his eyes, and Cas was radiant. It wasn’t like his usual angelic light which was so bright it could burn out someone’s skull, but instead like a sort of warm glow that surrounded him.
He had to say something. Anything.
“I won’t. I promise.”
“Who’s that?” Dean whispered.
“Dad, I like the way I feel when I’m with Cas,” Dean felt some tears drip down his face, but he remained firm in his speech. “He makes me feel safe, accepted….wanted.”
“Do you want to go back inside?” Gabriel asked.
“He cleaned my drawing.”
“I’m good, Cas.”
“He’s had a hold on me since day one so if you think you can turn me away from him now, you’re wasting your time. This is what’s happening, and you can’t do shit about it. Got it?”
_________________
“Yup!”
They walked in silence for awhile before conversing briefly about the club and Cas’s role as president. He explained that Pride Alliance was actually something he had started with his best friend, Charlie, when they were freshman after she had been bullied throughout middle school for being a lesbian. At the time, Cas wasn’t out of the closet, but he was a fierce ally to his friend, and wanted a place where she could feel safe and validated. He would eventually come out a few months later, but it took him awhile to feel comfortable talking about his identity (he still struggled with it, especially since discovering later on that he was on the asexual spectrum with a romantic inclination towards men, but he wasn’t ready to share that part with Dean just yet). Initially, the club only had two members other than him and Charlie, but attendance had grown steadily in the three years since its establishment, and Cas was quite proud of that. During the last semester, they had twelve people, and he was hoping for thirteen or more this time around.
“Stop this,” he shouted.
“What makes you think Balthazar wouldn’t want to? He seems like the type of guy who’d jump at the opportunity. Or what about Claire and Kaia? I bet they’d do it.”
“Good evening, gentlemen,” the sound of the host’s voice brought Cas back to Earth again. “Do you have a reservation?”
“Yes, Cassie. Do introduce us all,” Balthazar laughed in agreement.
“In that case, listen up. You’re gonna love this,” Dean cleared his throat and readied himself to follow along with the chorus. “Here we go...I'm a cowboy. On a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted dead or alive. Wanted dead or alive.”
“But you know. I still intend to make up for the lost time. Starting right now.”
“Hey, wait.”
“I mean, technically my dad’s, but yeah. She’s a beauty, isn’t she? 1967 Chevrolet Impala. Restored in part by yours truly,” Dean grinned, proudly.
"Well, I don't know. What size do you wear? He probably wears something similar."
“I’m sure you will. But just in case you have an emergency, and you can’t log in, I’ll go ahead and write down my number too,” he scribbled his information on a sheet from his notebook and tore it out to hand to Dean.
“I love you, too, Jack.”
Dean nodded.
“Ay, get a room you two,” Dean laughed from the doorway. “Hey, Jack.”
“Castiel has been telling me about you.”
“Find anything?” Dean’s thoughts were interrupted by the sales rep who had returned from helping another customer at the register.
Taking one last look at Dean, he smiled again before leaving the room. Dean glanced back at Jack who appeared almost proud of himself. He raised an eyebrow, curiously.
“It was necessary,” Dean stated.
“It is. I just need a minute.”
“We didn’t have a fight, Sammy. I wasn’t feeling well over the weekend, and then today I just felt like spending time with you. Cas understood. It’s no big deal,” he lied.
Dean scanned the rows of rings, not entirely sure what to look for. Cas wasn’t a fancy guy, so he didn’t need a huge diamond or anything, but Dean also didn’t want to get him something plain and boring. He could always try something unconventional and get a ring without a diamond. Maybe like an emerald or something. He had read somewhere that some people believe emeralds represent successful love, faith, and loyalty. Then again, if someone didn’t know that, they may see green and think “jealousy” like Dean was possessive. That probably wouldn’t be a good idea then. He scratched his head in thought. He could go for something blue like Cas’s eyes. Afterall, Dean had always considered them to be the most beautiful part of him. They’re like sparkling pools that are too easy to get lost in.
That did sound cool. However, a part of Dean still hoped for that time alone with Cas. Not that anything would necessarily come from it. Did he want something to? Maybe, no...well...the more he thought about it, the better it sounded. The dance fantasy was great, but he’d even settle for an intimate night of jokes and Cas’s smile lighting up the room. Just being near the guy made Dean feel warm inside, and that was both amazing and terrifying. Afterall, finding Cas attractive was one thing, but Dean was sure he was developing romantic feelings. He had never experienced that before (with anyone, not just with a guy) so this was all uncharted territory. However, it was something he would be willing to explore. Perhaps he should just bite the bullet and ask Castiel out just to see if there was even a chance. If he did that though, and his feelings aren't reciprocated, he could be risking their friendship. That would be a lot to lose, so Dean figured it was best to think it over some more. Also, if he did ask him out, Dean wanted to plan something special rather than just blurting it out in the middle of a public park like where they were currently. Geez, now it really was turning into a chick flick.
Dean listened intently as Cas talked, and he was impressed with the initiative the boy took to get this club off the ground. He was truly driven to do good, despite the risks to himself, and that was pretty badass. He even told Castiel this, and his friend returned the sentiment with a bashful smile.

“Uh huh, makes sense,” he stammered. “I mean, wow….”
“At least mine is reasonable. Sammy here is terrified of clowns. Clowns of all things.”
“Thank you, Sammy.”
“Well?” Sam urged.
This is a really short chapter, so I apologize. I wanted to set up my next plot point though.
“You always said blue was my color.”
“Maybe so, but it doesn’t mean he still won’t be making a huge sacrifice. Dean likes sex, he’s told me himself. How can I ask him to just give it up?”
“I’m sorry. I was just thinking,” Cas looked down at his feet.
“There’s a diner a couple of blocks from school that’s not too expensive. You know the one we went to when we first moved here? Where I got that huge milkshake and barely made it home without messing my pants.”
“Thanks, babe,” Sam approached her and gave her a hug.
“Well, you came to the right place,” the man’s expression switched to amusement, “It looks like Cupid threw up in here.”
“How did you even manage to start that conversation? It’s not like people can just barge into a room shouting “hey, I’m bisexual”, and that’s it. There’s gotta be some buildup, right? And how can you make it so it’s not so awkward? Just thinking about Sam and I talking about this has my stomach in knots.”
“Sheesh, you both got it bad,” Sam giggled.
“Did you pay for this yourself?”
“Thank you, sir.”
The boy was a little caught off guard by the sudden use of the nickname. Normally, it was only people that were close to him that used it, namely his family, and even then it was a bit uncomfortable. However, something about the way Dean said it felt different. He kind of liked it actually.
“I thought you said Jack turned down your grace for the day,” Dean asked.
“Not at all. Actually, he has reservations of his own because he just came out. Eventually, though, he’ll become more adventurous and might want to try stuff, and I’ll feel guilty because I don’t want to do any of that.”
“Sorry for the wait, gentlemen,” a woman appeared next to their table with a bottle of wine in her hand. “My name’s Jamie, and I’ll be your server. I’ve got a lovely bottle of Merlot here on reserve for you two.”
Dean wasn’t sure who Elijah was, but the mentioning of him had Gabriel shutting up really quick. He made a note to ask Cas about that later. Maybe not right that second because if they were in a cartoon, his friend would have smoke coming out of his ears. He was still blushing though.
As the first day of school drags on, Dean is relieved to find a familiar face in one of his classes which brings his spirits up.
“Sure, but…” he paused and shot Sam a silent expression for help.
Horrified, Sam grasped at his father’s arm and pulled to get him to let go of his brother.
“Nothing right now. Just let them sleep. They deserve it after the night they’ve had.”
They finally arrived at the apartment door, and Dean was desperately trying to hide the fact that he was out of breath. Fuck, he hated stairs. He fumbled in his pocket for his keys, but before he could place the right one in the lock, the door opened. He didn’t need to look up to know who was standing in front of them.
“Dean, it’s fine. I just don’t want you pretending to be someone you’re not.”
“Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty,” he whispered.
“Never mind,” he shook his head.“It doesn’t matter. Look, I know you’re probably still pissed at me, but,” John cut Dean off mid-sentence and looked beyond him at Cas.
“Are you insane?!”
The confrontation with John and the aftermath. More interaction with Michael.
It was rare that Dean actually cared what anybody outside of his family thought of him (again, because they were never in one place long enough for it to make a difference), but something at his core desired approval from the members in this club. It was as if his right to his identity was somehow dependent on his ability to impress them. In other words, if his experiences led him to confirm his bisexuality, would it even matter if others in the community didn’t see him as queer enough? Could he still claim that label even without their recognition? He shouldn’t have to prove to anyone who he is, he knew that, but the thought still ate away at him.
“Let’s get your mind off of it then,” John smiled. “You left me hanging before. Tell me about your possible date.”
He dialed Sam and waited, anxiously, for his brother to pick up. He couldn't believe he went to the jewelers without knowing what size to get. He felt like an idiot.
“Seriously, I’m fine. Can we just go?”
“It’s not like your concerns were unjustified,” Dean began, “It’s true that I was caught up in the moment and didn’t fully understand the situation. That said, I did what you asked and took a step back to reevaluate.”
“Because of Dad?”
“Cas, are you crazy?” Charlie stared at him. “We’re not approaching them directly.”
“In darkness, you are my light,” the angel muttered.
“Do you need help studying?”
“You have a brother?”
“Can’t end a day like this without pie,” Dean chuckled. “I made it myself. It’s pumpkin.”
“New...what’s wrong with…” Cas sighed. “Fine, I think there’s a tailor a few towns over. We can head out after we look at the cards.”
“I’ll be right there,” Dean hung up.
“No, thank you. I should probably get going. I’ve got to go get some stuff.”
The three climbed out of the car and headed for the entry way. The elevator was out of order, so they were forced to take the stairs. Dean complained, but he would be lying if he said he didn’t enjoy walking up behind his boyfriend. Great view.
“Um, I’m still here, guys,” Sam groaned as he fished his toast out and onto his plate. “I know it’s Valentine’s Day, but could you please refrain from making out until after I finish eating?”
“Cas?” Jack’s voice pierced through his daze.
“It was nice meeting you.”
___________________
“Just shut up and roll,” Gabe huffed.
“Please, Dean. It’s better this way.”
“That’s the goal,” he let out a breath. “Let’s do this.”
“Sometimes,” the angel responded, softly, “Although, I’m not sure how it would’ve worked out, trying to navigate a relationship in the midst of multiple apocalypses.”
“I hate to ask this, but...do you think I could snag a sandwich for my brother before we put them out? My dad is outta town, and money’s kinda tight,” he waited for a moment before adding, awkwardly, “If it’s an issue, I’ll just give him mine.”
The initial shock quickly transcended to anger.
“I suppose,” Dean was scratching Miracle’s ears and avoiding eye contact with Sam.
“Nope, still very much into women. I don’t see that changing anytime soon,” Dean clarified, “Look, I’ll gladly talk about girls with you or with anyone else that knows I’m bisexual, but it’s different when I’m trying to put on a show for Dad. He thinks I’m straight, so it feels like I’m just conforming to his standards and denying part of who I am. Plus, you know he’ll want me to show him pictures of my date...”
“You’ll get there,” Gabe patted his shoulder. “Although, I suppose that means this is a bad time to tell you that I hooked up with a guy at my show last week.”
“It was more of a nightmare really. You and I were back in the bunker with Billie right before the Empty was summoned to take you both away. She was pounding on the door, weakening the warding with each hit, and I was at a complete loss of what to do. And then you looked at me and gave that heartfelt speech about happiness and love, and I just shut down. You were laying your heart out for me, and I didn’t say a word. And then before I knew it, you were gone. You were dead, and it was my fault. I failed you, Cas.”
“That’s not true,” Cas pushed, “You can’t…”
The Winchesters followed Gabe into the living room where Jack was busy with a dinosaur puzzle. As soon as he spotted Dean, he dropped the piece he had in his hand and ran to hug him. Dean was taken aback since he had only met the boy once, but he wasn’t going to turn down a hug from Mr. Matchmaker. He owed the kid after all. If it wasn’t for his little trick, Dean wouldn’t be there.
“Right…” he said, slowly, “Well, is there anything specific I can help you find?”
“I needed an alibi.”
"Sir, those aren't really engagement rings," the woman followed him to the case.
“Come on. You’re already behind because of me, so I owe you.”
“I don’t know. You seemed pretty engaged in that conversation with the DJ a moment ago,” Cas noted, glancing over at the boy who had put his earphones back on to focus on the music (or perhaps just to drown out nearby discussions).
“Hello Dean,” he tried his best not to sound nervous, but it wasn’t a very convincing performance.
Ok, simple question. Dean could do this.
“I promise.”
“Yeah?”
Dean stared at him for a moment, his heart suddenly beating so rapidly that he thought it would burst from his chest. He had no words.
“You just did it again,” a hint of suspicion was there now.
Shit. He actually looked upset as if he had done something wrong by asking, and it made Dean feel a bit guilty. He waved a little to reclaim the boy’s attention.
“It’s called Pride Alliance.”
“Email? Haven’t you heard of texting?”
“I said no, Sam.”
“He’ll come around,” Sam reassured him.
“But Dean, you know how Dad is about that stuff,” Sam warned, “He used to get on your case from just sitting too close to another guy. And there was that one time with your friend…”
“I’ve told him to be on his best behavior, but I wouldn’t count on it.”
“He’s good, yeah. We had lunch together today.”
“Sure, Dean.”
“Protesters?” Sam’s eyes widened.
Cas bit his lip.
“Are you ok? You seem on edge. Did something happen between you and Cas?”
“Oh, you’re serious. Ok.”
“That would be nice. What do you think, Jack?”
Castiel laughed a little: “I mean, kind of. It’s not exclusive. Pride Alliance is a student organization that celebrates people of all sexualities and gender identities.”
“There isn’t a set time for these things, Dean. You don’t have to do anything you don’t feel ready to do,” he said, softly.
It was nearing midnight and while Sam was able to fall asleep pretty quickly, Dean wasn’t so lucky. He stared at the wooden top of his bunk, his thoughts swirling. He listened to the slight creaking sound as his brother shifted position above him, and a part of him wanted to kick his leg up to jostle the younger brother awake so they could suffer together. He wasn’t going to, though, because Sam was innocent in all this. Let him drift away while Dean dealt with the guilt of potentially ruining both his and his brother’s lives. It wasn’t like he regretted what was said, but at the same time the uncertainty of what was ahead was killing him.
-Dean
“I guess it’s just the way you talk about him. The admiration and the fondness in your voice. Little things like that.”
He swung a punch at Dean’s thigh which hurt more than expected. Kid had some power in that arm. Then he tapped both of Dean’s knees to “weaken” them. Thank god for that courtesy because Dean actually did have weak knees. Finally, he stepped on Dean’s shoe which Dean realized was supposed to be the move that took him down. He gasped and crouched down to the floor. From there was an exaggerated death scene which left Jack the winner of what Gabe deemed Jurassic showdown. He and Sam clapped while Jack spun in circles to celebrate his victory. This was the moment Cas decided to enter the room. Dean didn’t even notice at first because, committed to his role, he was still playing dead and had his eyes closed.
“Everything alright?”
Once she and Miracle had disappeared out the back door, Sam returned to the living room to find Dean staring down at his phone. He seemed tense.
“Just don’t laugh at me, ok, girl?”
“Cas? Really?”
“Just you and Crowley.”
“Hers makes more sense,” Dean mumbled. “I’m going to look like an idiot doing this.”
Cas hopped off of him and rounded the side of the bed. As he passed, Dean playfully slapped his butt.
“But you’re sure this doesn’t have anything to do with you wanting to see more of me?” Dean smirked.
“Is something wrong, son?” John finally asked.
“It’s less about intelligence and more about dedication,” he responded, calmly, “If you put in the effort, there’s usually a reward.”
“Mhm.”
“Fine, fine, you win, just quit it. I’m gonna, hahaha….I’m gonna pee.”
“Anyway, we didn’t mean to wake you,” Cas removed his robe, stepped around Miracle who was surprisingly still sleeping, and climbed under the covers with his lover.
“Really?” Jack’s eyes lit up.
“Yeah, I’m fine.”
"I know, I'm sorry. It's just that I thought an extra mind on the task would be helpful. Plus, she was running some stuff by me, and it could be really nice."
“Plan the perfect date for you and Cas.”
“No,” Dean sighed. “ I understand why you were scared. It’s ok.”
“It’s nice to meet you both,” Eileen said with a smile. “Where’s the rest of your group? Sam said you met up with some friends for dinner.”
Cas kissed him.
“Nah, after I called you, I texted Charlie that it might be awhile. She understood.”
Cas ignored him.
As the clock neared 3:30, Dean felt his anxiety creeping back. He had managed to subdue it for as long as he was moving about, but now that it was just him and Cas sitting and waiting, it was becoming much harder to act like everything was cool. He knew Castiel could sense it too. He could practically feel the kid’s gaze tearing through him, but he refused to make eye contact. Instead, he cleared his throat and attempted to make conversation.
While waiting for Claire’s return, Charlie turned on some music on her phone and began to sing along. Her rendition of “Walking on Sunshine” was commendable, but Dean found his attention drifting towards Cas who seemed to be debating with Crowley over something. He couldn’t quite make out what they were saying, but it didn’t matter since he wasn’t really interested anyway. He was too focused on the cute little wrinkles that formed on Cas’s forehead whenever he got frustrated. At one point Cas must’ve caught him staring because he issued a small wave. Butterflies filled Dean’s stomach, and he looked away.
“Hey, there’s Gabriel,” Cas grabbed Dean’s arm and turned him in the direction of his own sibling who gave them a thumbs-up and a wink.
Dean did not answer. Cas’s words were so simple, yet he had never felt as loved as he did in that moment. He thought of the sad little kid he used to be, and was immediately overwhelmed with pride for how far he had come as well as with appreciation for the amazing person next to him that he had somehow gotten to fall in love with him despite his trauma. This was a moment he never thought could happen, and he could barely contain himself. Tears began to well in his eyes, and fuck it, he didn’t bother to fight them. Castiel held him close as he cried.
Sheesh, this guy was so formal compared to Gabriel. And not like Cas’s cute, awkward kind of formality. This was actually rather intimidating.
Reluctantly, he released Cas, and followed him out of the cafeteria.
“I’m coming out there. Where are you exactly?”
“Um, sure, I guess. We talked about stuff.”
Hello Dean,
Before Castiel could say anything more, their teacher rushed into the room, a stack of papers in his arms. He apologized for being tardy which Dean found a little ironic. His excuse was there was a paper jam, and he needed to finish printing the syllabi. Whoopee, more syllabi...As their teacher fumbled around with the objects on his desk, Castiel leaned back to whisper to Dean.
“I did a lot more reading than watching movies growing up,” Cas shrugged.
“Ok, what else?”
“When I kissed you?”
“Do what?”
“No.”
“You won’t miss it?”
Dean hesitated.
Dean watched as it finally clicked, and John’s body stiffened.
“Are you sure about that?” Sam asked. “He did say he was still a bit hesitant about the whole you being gay thing. He might be a little apprehensive about having your boyfriend there overnight.”
“Well, are you good now? Cause the wind is picking up. I don’t want you to catch a cold.”
“Yes, I’m starving!” Jack clapped, happily, and started piling his plate with bacon, making sure to sneak a piece for Miracle in the process.
“No, he’s not in robotics, but sometimes he will come visit after his stuff, and he brings people. They’re pretty cool.”
“And what?”
“To hell it isn’t. You’re my brother. I may not have been able to do much about Dad, but…”
“You’ll still meet her, just not over dinner. It’s probably for the best. She doesn’t need to see you eat.”
Traffic leaving the school was surprisingly light, so it only really took the duration of one Bon Jovi hit to make it to the park. As the song ended and Dean pulled into the lot, he turned to look at Castiel, a mix of pride and slight embarrassment on his face. Pride because he had managed to get Cas out of his shell for a few minutes. Embarrassment because Cas’s singing voice was a tragedy, yet he was slightly turned on by it-not that he would admit that. He shifted in his seat.
“Just another reason to kick the crap out of your father the next time I see him. Selfish prick. Always picking fights for no damn reason other than to put himself on top.”
“Can’t you see that for once I’m happy?”
Dean struggles to find a way to prove his devotion to Cas, and he comes to a difficult decision.
“Are you coloring?” he asked.
“I’ll have to tell you that full story sometime,”John’s face became sad for a second, but whatever was going on in his head was quickly dismissed. “But speaking of dates,” he glanced over his shoulder at Dean. “I still can’t believe you’re going stag to the dance, Dean. I figured the girls would be throwing themselves at you.”
“Ok, stop that, will you?” Dean rubbed his neck, “Like I said, I want this to be more than sex. I was hoping to take him somewhere. Really give him that fairytale evening, you know?”
“Why didn’t you say anything?” the look of horror on the younger boy’s face transitioned to something equivalent to betrayal. “I want to help!”
Cas POV
“Nothing. Saw some cheerleaders while I was wandering around,” he lied.
“Hmm, well, whatever happened, let’s just hope Michael didn’t notice,” Dean said.
“Cas is…” Dean thought about it. “Funny. Not like jokester funny, but the kind of funny when a person doesn’t even realize that what they are saying is hilarious. Sometimes Cas will make comments meant to make me laugh, but usually it’s the unintentional stuff that gets me,” he smiled. “Also kind. Cas is probably the most selfless person I know. Always around for advice and support when needed.”
Boy what...Dean’s stomach dropped. He looked to Cas.
“You’re right.”
The dog peaked open one eye and licked his hand. He assumed that was a promise. Lifting his gaze back to his brother, he could see that Sam had his hand outstretched. Standing up, he made his way over to grab the other man’s hand. Immediately, Sam pulled him in so that they were only a few inches from each other.
So yeah…there was a lot on his mind. He wiped a hand across his face and groaned.
Dean’s Confession + Castiel’s Secret
Cas nodded.
“Well, this article on the top ten ways to win over your partner for Valentine’s Day says a good place to start is chocolate!” Jack pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and proudly showed it off to the man.
“Let me rephrase…I don’t want to be away from you. I’ll just be up all night worrying,” he pressed his forehead up against Dean’s.
“You realize you sound like a Hallmark special?” Gabriel joked.
“It’s nothing. I just didn’t want him to worry.”
“Dean,” this time John was stern; he obviously had caught on that something was up.
It wasn’t as bad as Dean had expected. In fact, Cas was right about everyone being pretty cool. The moment they had walked in, they were greeted by an older girl, Anna. Dean guessed she was the leader based on the way she approached them. Of course, that would make ‘youth’ a relative term as she was at least twenty. She hugged Cas and proceeded to flirt a little bit with Dean before she was pulled away by some other members. He couldn’t help but smile because the look of jealousy on Cas’s face was oddly adorable. Smiling, he had grabbed Cas’s hand and squeezed it to assure him that Dean was 100% his. The other boy relaxed.
“Was this the guy your brother texted when he stole your phone?”
“Does it matter?”
“Cas, it’s cold outside. Why can’t we just drive?”
“You know, we could stay out here if you want,” Dean suggested.
“What’s wrong?”
“Yes,” the angel was crying now, happy tears.
“You’re later than usual,” Gabriel said with a grin. “What was the hold up?”
“You’re welcome,” Cas glanced down at his watch. “Shit.”
“Look, I’m not mad. Actually, it felt kind of nice, and I was honestly a little upset when you pulled away.”
“You guys have a club for gay people?” Dean asked, a hint of interest in his voice.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“Standard questions. Name. Where did you meet? What do you like about her?”
“Right, ok. Dean, this is Fer…” Cas bit his tongue, “Sorry, Crowley Macleod. He's one of the original members of Pride Alliance, and his mother teaches Chemistry here at the school. Crowley, this is Dean Winchester.”
“Is worth it,” Dean muttered. “It’ll be rough, but as long as you’re here with me, it’ll be ok.”
“Yea, I’m on a mission, Sammy. I didn’t want Cas asking a bunch of questions. You know how he is when I go out alone.”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean hissed.
Cas sighed, setting down the marker he had in his hand.
It took a moment for Gabriel to register this information, but once it set in, he wasn’t surprised in the least.
“We both took some risks this week, laying it all out on the line. Vulnerability and all that,” Dean began. “First, you coming out to me, then us being honest with each other, and now me coming out. It’s been eventful to say the least. Almost like an entire drama series packed into a few days.”
“That’s what I’m worried about. I’m not exactly an altar boy.”
“That’s the point. Gotta give people something they will remember.”
“Is that what you want, Dad?” Sam pushed.
“Shut up,” Dean looked away, embarrassed. “It’s not like you have been Mr. Composure either. I bumped knees with you under the table at dinner, and you nearly choked on your water.”
“It’s his first relationship. I think that’s natural to be nervous.”
While Crowley defended his honor, the happy couple found a seat next to each other, and Cas laid his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean shuffled closer so that Cas’s face was nearly buried in his neck. There was a chorus of “awws” and a joking remark from Claire to “get a room.”
Dean thought about this for a moment. Of his previous schools, none had a group like that. In most of them, a person would get the crap kicked out of them for being queer, not be celebrated for it. Not to mention, his dad was a bit of a bigot, so Dean had seen and heard his fair share of homophobia around the house and in the neighborhood. Some of it was even directed at him which is why this Pride Alliance concept was both puzzling and intriguing. When Dean was growing up, he had gotten in trouble a few times for being too close to his male friends. On one occasion he was even told he needed to terminate a friendship because he was caught snuggling with another boy during a sleepover. At the time, Dean didn’t understand the significance of it because it was cold, and cuddling ensured that they would keep warm. It was innocent, didn’t mean anything. So what if Dean felt butterflies in his stomach the entire time? That didn’t mean he was gay. John thought differently, though.
Immediately, Miracle stopped barking and fixated her gaze on him. Her tail wagged vigorously which made Dean smile. Even when he was stressed, that dog always seemed to cheer him up.
“Ugh,” Sam groaned and let his head fall back against his pillow. “It’s too early for this.”
Damn, he could really be sassy when he wanted to be. What a bastard, and Dean loved him for it. He placed a gentle kiss on the top of Cas’s head. His friend hummed with delight.
I’m so sorry I wasn’t able to get this updated before Valentine’s Day, everyone. I didn’t get as much work done this weekend as I wanted to. I went ahead and posted the first part. I’m still refining the actual proposal scene, and I didn’t want to rush it. I hope to have that uploaded by the end of the day tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest. Fingers crossed.
“So you like me as a person, but you do not find me attractive? Not to be combative, I’m just confused.”
“Would you rather hear about the girl I hooked up with the week before?”
“I’ll go with you,” Cas played along and followed as Dean turned to walk in the opposite direction.
“I mean, we move a lot, so it wasn’t anything I hadn’t been through before. Mainly Cas has been supporting me through figuring out some identity stuff.”
“I would appreciate that.”
“Enjoy the dance,” the boy said as they passed.
“I’ll still get it if you want me to, Dean. It does look good.”
“If you say so.”
“And if Michael finds out? He’s a stickler about routine and healthy habits, you know.”
“Not hungry?” Eileen looked at him in disbelief. “When are you ever not hungry?”
*Warning* Some mentioning of homophobia
“Right. Sorry,” Cas dabbed at his mouth.
“You didn’t answer my question. Is everything ok? You two seem kind of out-of-it,” the cashier eyed them, suspiciously.
_____________________
“Buddy, huh? That by chance the kid you took to the dance?”
“Doesn’t she go to our school?” Cas asked.
“Would you like some?” Jack pulled away and began to pour the cookies into his bowl.
“Fine,” he conceded. “But the door needs to stay open.”
“So, listen Sammy,” he began, “I’ve been thinking about this a lot. It’s something I’ve actually been wrestling with for awhile, but it’s become more of an issue since we moved here.”
“It’s mutual, trust me,” Dean couldn’t help, but laugh a little at his friend’s embarrassment. “You know, Cas, he...well, he’s helped me a lot.”
“That’s terrible. I’m so sorry that happened.”
“Dead or alive,” Cas said in unison with his friend.
Surprisingly, there weren’t that many people at the store when Dean arrived. Granted, it was the middle of the week, and it’s a small town, but he expected more of a crowd for Valentine’s Day. The door chimed as he entered the shop, and he was greeted by a woman in a blue blouse and dress pants. She seemed nice, but the giant sales rep smile on her face made Dean a bit uncomfortable. He never liked it when people smiled that much. It was kind of creepy.
“Hey boys! Looking good,” she laughed.
“I am right. And you know what, I’m going to help you.”
“Well, good for you, I suppose. So, what are you doing here? I thought you graduated.”
“It’s ok to be vulnerable, Dean. Eileen and I aren’t going to judge you.”
Cas shoved the ring back into his pocket and put his finger to his lips to indicate that Jack should remain silent about their previous conversation. His son nodded in confirmation. He had a serious  expression on his face, but it was quickly replaced by joy when Miracle came running from the stairwell to jump in his lap. She covered the boy’s face with kisses, eliciting a fit of giggles.
“Not until you tell me what’s going on,” Gabe took the key out of the ignition, and the car fell silent. “Come on, Cas. Something is clearly wrong.”
“You can barely see me.”
When Cas arrived, everyone had already picked out at least one outfit to try on, and Charlie even had some stuff laid out for him which he appreciated, considering fashion was never his area of expertise. He found them all waiting outside the fitting rooms, arguing who should go in first. Charlie insisted that they take turns so everyone could witness the reveal and give their opinion on the size, shape, color, etc. like judges in a fashion show. It’s a good thing Dean didn’t have any homework that afternoon because he had a feeling this was going to be awhile. Sighing, he plopped himself down in a nearby chair and waited for a consensus to be reached. After a rousing game of rock-paper-scissors, Claire came out the winner. She smiled, proudly, and disappeared into the dressing room with some black dress pants, a white shirt and black bow tie, some heels, and a black and white suit jacket.
Dean has a heart-to-heart with his brother
“Jack is my nephew. I guess I just felt guilty,” he twiddled his thumbs while he talked and kept his eyes focused on his feet.
Rather than unpack that statement, Castiel dropped the matter and followed. The two sat across from one another at a picnic table in the center of the park just past the playground. Dean watched as Cas pulled out some papers from his bag and set them in front of him. He then reached for a granola bar that he munched on as he scribbled something onto the first page.
“God, how do you drink this stuff? Bleh.”
“We have a club budget.”
There was silence for a few minutes, and Cas looked away again. Dean heard some sniffling.
He switched his gaze back to Dean.
“Dude, I was asleep. I was woken up when Cas practically threw you on top of me.”
Dean’s friends were all waiting for them at the mall’s entrance, everyone except Castiel. That wasn’t encouraging, but Dean didn’t have much time to think about it before he was pulled into a tight embrace by a spunky redhead. Crowley, Kaia, and Claire watched in amusement as Charlie’s hug nearly caused Dean’s eyes to pop out of his head. Sam held back, not sure if Dean would want him to intervene since he hadn’t been formally introduced yet to anyone besides Claire.
“I’m sorry for this,” Cas whispered.
“Likewise,” Sam took it, but was still not sure what was going on. “Um, Dean. Did you need something? I need to get to the debate room.”
“What was that about?” Cas had now returned from the restroom.
“Dean?” Cas’s voice brought Dean out of his head.
From: impala67@gmail.com
“You know how Dad is. If he finds out, the bastard will tear me a new one. I can’t risk it. So you need to promise me you won’t say anything.”
“There’s some tinfoil in one of these drawers. Pick which one you want and wrap it up. I can spot you for a small package of chips from the vending machine too, if you want.”
“Don’t give me that,” Dean said firmly. “When you walked in here you were a wreck, and then as soon as you made eye contact, you froze like a deer in headlights. Then you shuffled to your desk and avoided looking at me like that wouldn't strike me as off. I’m not dumb, Cas.”
“Probably not.”
Homecoming night is finally here. Dean is nervous after what happened with his father. Dean meets Michael for the first time. The Pride Alliance gang has some fun. Some cute Destiel moments.
“Alright, you asked for it.”
“It’s nice to meet you,” Cas extended his hand.
Here comes Detective Sam again. Dean considered telling him to fuck off, but he was in this too deep.
“Alright then,” Dean sighed, “Well, the silence is getting kinda awkward, so let’s talk. Are you excited for tonight?”
Dean never liked being put on the spot. Suddenly, he felt a bit dizzy, and his hands were clammy. Noticing his discomfort, Castiel stood up and redirected Dean to some empty chairs in the corner. They both sat, and Cas was looking at him with a concerned expression.
______________
When the final bell rang, Dean slammed his gym locker shut, and quickly typed a message to Sammy to wait for him by the cafeteria before their respective meetings. He didn’t have anything particularly important to say to him that would require this, but a part of Dean just wanted to see his brother one more time before engaging in what could possibly be a life-changing interaction. Well, maybe he shouldn’t play it up that much...it was going to be something new for him, he’d leave it at that. At least seeing Sammy would help calm his anxiety a bit...or maybe it’d make it worse. Dean supposed he would find out when he got there.
“I’m great,” Dean replied, his suspicion apparent in his voice. “The more pressing question is what’s up with you? Why are you so tense?”
“Um, ok,” Dean seemed cautiously optimistic. “Meet by the Impala after class?”
“I do, but I’m also into dudes and anyone really. Gender’s not really a factor.”
“Don’t be sexist,” Eileen returned the playful punch for Sam.
“Thanks, Jack. I owe you one.”
“I think I have lost you already.”
“I don’t remember reserving any wine,” Cas stated.
“Good to know,” Dean averted eye contact.
“Oh, right. I forgot about that table and paddles he bought at that garage sale a few months back. He hasn’t had anyone to play with, so I’m sure he will like that. He’ll be back here soon. He went to the dog park with Miracle, and then he was going to swing by the pet store on the way back to pick up some more kibble. And Sam went over to Eileen's. I wouldn’t expect him back until dinner.”
“I mean it. You have to swear that you won’t even tell Eileen,” some of his panic was trickling into his voice.
______________________
“You’re beautiful you know that?”
After dinner, they played some board games which was apparently a Novak tradition for Sunday nights. It was sweet in theory, but in practice was pretty intense. Who’d have known that Cas’s family would be so competitive, especially since he was usually so calm. Dean thought that Gabriel was about to throw the Monopoly board across the room a few times after landing on some highly-taxed areas.
“Well, then we are going to be here for awhile because I’m not moving until you do.”
“I was admiring my ring earlier,” Cas whispered, “I never truly expressed how beautiful I think it is.”
“That’s not true. You were knocking out the music section,” Cas replied, proudly. He turned to Gabe, explaining, “Charlie added a category on queer singers and songwriters this year, and Dean knew the answer to every one.”
“I have a surprise for you.”
“If things work out, I’d love to meet her.”
“What are you referring to?” he tilted his head.
“What do you want to know?” Dean’s heart raced.
“I highly doubt that.”
Castiel did not answer immediately. He let go of Dean’s hand and climbed into the passenger’s seat, closing his eyes to begin some sort of meditative breathing. This struck Dean as odd, but then again everything about Cas was odd, so it probably didn’t mean anything. Shrugging, he hopped in on the driver’s side and waited patiently for his friend to finish whatever it was he was doing.
“It’s crisp, not cold. Important distinction,” he noted, “Besides, we can cut through the park. The trees are beautiful this time of year with the different colors. Also the pond is pretty. Really though, it’s just nice to be outside and to reflect. That’s usually what I do anyway to get in the right mindset before meetings, unless it’s unbearably hot or there’s snow on the ground.”
“So, you know how I’ve always been sort of a ladies man, right?”
“Whether I’m ok with it or not.”
“Just,” Dean paused, frustrated. “I don’t know how much sleep I’m going to get anyway, so Sam can have the bunk. Jack can even stay with us so you don’t have to give up your space.”
Sent 10:46 p.m.
“Oh, right. Uh...”
“Sam’s with his date, and the others must’ve gotten held up at the lights or something,” Dean answered.
“You would only have led me on if you felt nothing at all which we have established is not the case.”
“I have to.”
“This is ridiculous. You’re ridiculous. We’re leaving,” Crowley jumped to his feet and headed for the door.
Oh, and on Friday I’m supposed to drop Sam off at a friend’s house to spend the night, but if you want to tag along, we can still get ice cream, and I’ll drive you home afterwards. Just let me know.
“You want to go to the dance with Cas, don’t you? And that’s why you’ve been acting weird. You haven’t asked him yet.”
If you don’t want to read the confrontation part because it’s uncomfortable, I understand, and you can stop at the line...
“Yup. Now, I’m wide awake!” the boy exclaimed. “Will you play with me, Castiel?”
“So what? It’s cold,” he adjusted the heater. “See? Better.”
“Sounds good. Have fun,” he ruffled Cas’s hair, much to his dismay. “If you aren’t awake when I get back, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“The dance isn’t over yet, is it?” Dean asked.
“I’m glad you could make it. This is going to be fun,” she said, cheerfully. “I’ve got a whole playlist to listen to while we try stuff on. It’ll be like a montage.”
“It’s nice to meet you too, Gabriel,” Dean said, politely. “And really?” he turned towards Castiel who avoided his gaze.
Cas stirred a little, and Dean found himself blushing because here he was watching someone else sleep like some kind of obsessed idiot. It was kinda creepy, he realized that, but he couldn’t pull his eyes away if he tried.
“You made this?”
“Huh?”
“Sounds perfect,” Cas gave him a warm smile. “Well, you heard Gabriel. Breakfast will be ready soon,” he released his boyfriend and proceeded to grab the pile of clothes he had set out before going to bed. “I’ll give you two some privacy. I’ll just be down the hall,” he headed towards the door so he could go back to the bathroom to change, but Dean caught his arm.
Dean led the way to a spot just a few feet from the shoreline where he laid out the blanket. Next to it, he placed the cooler and what Cas could now see was a small music player. Dean made a motion for Cas to sit. Despite his confusion, the angel obliged. His partner opened the cooler to retrieve a beer and the pie tin. He handed the beer to Cas and then rushed back to the Impala to grab some paper plates and plastic cutlery from the glove compartment.
“Jack,” Cas stood up and held out his arms to embrace his son. “What are you doing here? Is something going on in heaven?”
Hello Dean,
“She worries we were giving the wrong impression by having Pride Alliance participate.”
“Well,” Jack settled himself into a seat before continuing, “What do you usually do on dates?”
To: impala67@gmail.com
“Yay! My dads are getting married!” Jack cheered as he joined in the hug.
His posture softened a bit at the touch, showcasing just how tense he had been. Still, he tried to maintain the illusion that everything was fine.
“Oh come on, Michael. They’re exhausted. It’s not like they’re going to be doing anything but sleeping,” Gabriel replied.
This was going to be an interesting night.
Cas stuck his tongue out at her which was something Dean never thought he’d see him do. There was almost a childlike innocence to him when he and Charlie were together, and it was both sweet and hilarious. He couldn’t help, but crack a smile.
“Yeah. He said you’re new here, and you make his World History class tolerable.”
“It amazes me how quickly you can go from being serious to being so childish.”
There was a soft giggle as Cas leaned into his partner’s touch. The sound drove Dean crazy, so he began pressing his lips repeatedly to the other man’s temple until he lifted his head to meet him in a proper kiss. At first it was innocent, but before Dean knew it, he had Cas climbing on top of him. The two kissed passionately for awhile, and Cas teased him a bit by nibbling at his ear and kissing down the side of his neck. However, things didn’t escalate further because just as quickly as they started, the fun ended. Cas reluctantly pulled away and looked down at Dean.
“Yeah. Nice guy. A lawyer. We had fun, but I don’t think I need to see him again. We don’t have much in common. He gave me his number though just in case I changed my mind.”
“He’s going to love it, ok?” Dean grumbled.
“Sure.”
“Health cabinet?”
Dean paused.
“And that’s great. I’m happy for you guys. Believe me, I’m thrilled, but why didn’t you just tell me that’s what you were doing?”
Caught off guard, Castiel jumped a little at the contact. He turned to face Dean, a puzzled look on his face.
“Cas cleans.”
Dean perked up a little.
“Mmm,” Cas made a soft sound as he nuzzled his face into Dean’s chest.
“A detour, why?”
“What the...Dean!” Cas suddenly burst into laughter as his boyfriend began tickling him relentlessly. “Stop! Hahaha. This is so immature.”
“Cas is my partner,” Dean emphasized. “So you better watch your mouth.”
“That’s great, Dean. I’m glad you have something to look forward to.”
Before Sam could retort, there was a knock. They all turned to see Gabriel in the doorway, only half awake and looking like a zombie with his crows nest of hair and his pale complexion. He yawned and scratched his head.
“Ok, well, anyway he…”
_________________
“Hey Bobby. What’s the latest?”
Later Cas would ask him about it, but rather than explaining Dean just placed his lips against the boy’s forehead and remained that way for a moment. Yup, he could get used to this.
“I was just going to say that I trust you, and I appreciate the effort you are making. Also, I would very much like to give ‘us’ a chance,” Cas said, leaning forward to pull him into a hug.
“You don’t know that.”
“And Crowley?”
Dean checked his watch. His dad must’ve gotten off work early and decided to have an “afternoon treat” and a nap before going out. This was both good and bad news. Good because it meant that he could postpone his coming out a bit longer. Bad because he still wanted to apologize to Sam, and having John’s incessant snoring in the background would kind of taint the moment. It could be worse though. Sighing, he snatched a blanket from one of the chairs and threw it over the bastard. He didn’t bother to try and remove the beer bottle from his grip because it would only wake him (if John was going to be there, he preferred him to remain unconscious and unable to comment). Instead, he grabbed the unopened bottle John had left on the coffee table, and retreated to his and Sam’s bedroom.
“You knew?” Dean felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“Hey, uh, Sam. Dad left some burgers in the kitchen. Want me to heat one up for you?”
“No, leave him be. He’ll come to you in his own time. The only reason I mention it is because I think we need to be more mindful when talking to him about this stuff. As for Dean, based on what Cas has told me, he’s a good kid. He’s not going to do anything untoward. Besides, he said they already discussed it.”
“It’s not a big deal.”
“Hi, buddy,” Cas greeted. “Did you have a nice nap?”
“Ok, Dean. I will remember that.”
“Smart. Cas is kind of a genius- in my mind, at least. Top student in our history class.”
“Even so, it certainly wouldn’t look like little hearts, candy, and glitter,” Cas responded. “Well maybe candy…”
There was a sigh of relief from Dean.
It really did. Dean never thought he’d be presented with an opportunity to explore his sexuality in a positive setting like this. It could be good for him. If John found out though...he already had stuff to figure out with him, so maybe it wouldn’t be such a good idea. Still...
“So if you aren’t going to get rid of the club or call off the picket line, then why exactly are we here?” Crowley demanded.
“You’re right. I’m sorry,” Cas pulled away and rubbed his eyes which were becoming progressively redder. “I’ve been trying to do better about not beating myself up, but right now I’m tired, Dean. This conversation has been incredibly draining, and I don’t think I can handle much more. If you want to promise me something, just say that you will sleep on this. If we do pursue anything, I need you to be absolutely certain. Can you do that?”
“Well, that hasn’t necessarily changed. I still enjoy flirting with girls and having a good time, but lately I’ve started to realize that my whole macho, womanizing persona may be a bit of an overcompensation.”
Dean nodded, and everyone headed inside.
Cas didn’t protest. The two conversed for about a half an hour after that. It wasn’t about anything in particular, just random stuff, but hearing Cas talk was soothing. However, it came to the point where neither of them could keep their eyes open. Dean finally signed off and slipped into sleep, clutching his phone to his heart.
A deep sigh came from the other boy. Cas continued to avoid making eye contact, but to Dean’s surprise, he took his hand again. This time he squeezed it.
“No complaints here. For someone who has little experience with romance, dude, you sure know how to make a guy weak. The whole night you basically had me in the palm of your hand.”
“I do trust him. I never said I didn’t. It’s just that this is all unfamiliar to me, and I don’t know how to approach it. I figured the safest bet was to revert to the classic boundaries set by parents. Not that I’m his father because I know I’m not, but I am responsible for him.”
“If you were looking to get something for your significant other, what would you choose?” he asked, curiously.
“Ooo, I can’t wait to see that,” Dean smirked and leaned in to whisper in his ear. “Though, now I’m probably going to be fighting off your admirers all night because you’re going to be too irresistible,” moving away slightly, he licked his lips before locking them with Cas’s.
“Are we still friends at least?” he whispered. “Or did I just fuck everything up?”
“Alright, kid. I’ll see you when you get back.”
In the picture, Sam was ruffling Jack’s hair and Cas’s hand was on Jack’s shoulder. Meanwhile, Dean was on the other side of Cas, smiling into a kiss to the angel’s cheek. Above the figures was a banner that read “Happy Valentine’s Day”, and the drawing itself was labeled “my family.” Around the edges of the page were hearts in various colors. Cas had to smile at the fact that even though Jack was God and could technically learn any skill with the snap of his fingers, the drawing looked more like an elementary school art project than the magnum opus of a cosmic entity. It was adorable nonetheless.
Castiel nodded. He seemed to have calmed down a little upon hearing his nephew’s name.
It wasn’t a complete lie. Dean didn’t have a test per say, but he did have a lengthy quiz scheduled for Friday in that class. They had one every two weeks so it wasn’t that big of a deal, but Sam didn’t need to know that.
Cas’s frowned. Sighing, he shut his laptop and rubbed at his eyes.
Cas snapped his fingers for the paper and expressed a new message below his previous one, "Goofy, but a bit of an asshole."
“Well then, I’ll see it soon enough.”
“I hate you.”
“I’m just worried I’m going to embarrass you.”
“Can I ask why?”
“What is it, Dean?”
“Alright, sorry. I didn’t mean to…”
“I wouldn't say a relationship is a restraint,” Cas replied, “It’s a mutual commitment to one another,” he squeezed Dean’s hand.
“I would never,” he crossed his arms. “No, darling, I simply want to be there in case anything interesting happens. High school dances are full of drama. Also, I may try to convince the DJ to play some songs from my repertoire. If you’re lucky, I may put on a show for you all,” he winked. “You know, since you are yet to visit me on the nights I’m on stage.”
“Not me,” Sam mumbled.
“If you’re sure.”
From: impala67@gmail.com
“Well congratulations, I guess.”
“You’re using your stage name full time now?”
John didn’t say anything.
“I am going to the jewelers,” he hesitated, “to look for a ring...for Cas.”
“I was trying to protect you,” his father growled. “To keep you from going down the wrong path.”
Sam nodded to show he was listening.
“Maybe. I don’t know, but I asked Jack to stall him for a bit so that we could finish practicing.”
“Wouldn’t that be fun?”
“Cas, thank god,” he sighed from relief. “Where are you?”
“I think I should go home,” Cas breathed.
“I think Cas and Dean are perfectly capable of…” Gabriel was interrupted by Cas who was straining to speak amidst his internal panic attack.
“I’m immature? You’re the one whining.”
Cas shrugged.
“Ok, ok....just stop looking at me like that,” Dean sat down on the cushion farthest from Sam, “If you must know, I’m going to the jewelers.”
“Ok,” Dean responded, reluctantly.
Dean and Cas have lunch together and talk about Homecoming, coming out, and family. Also a singalong in the Impala.
"Crowley dabbles in drag," Cas told him. "It's part of his persona. Well, at least it was. Now, I guess it's just his name."
“Ok, can we please get on with this parade business before I lose my lunch?” Crowley pretended to gag.
“I couldn’t ask you to do that,” Cas shook his head. “It wouldn’t be right to put you at risk like that since you’re not out publicly,” he continued scratching words onto the form.
“You’re sweet, thank you,” he said. “I promise it won’t be long. Meetings rarely last more than an hour, and then we can do whatever you want.”
"Did you find out what size?" she asked.
“It was initially. But overtime I came to accept that he just didn’t care, so what was the point of dwelling on the loss? If you even want to call it that,” Cas frowned.
“Heard some rustling from the kitchen.”
“You can’t do that!” Dean had been quiet up to this point, but he couldn’t hold back anymore.
“I don’t want to sound like I am just reciting something from memory though,” Dean sighed.
“When I left, she was busy talking to Claire.”
“Really? Because if I remember correctly, it was you that asked me out, and I rejected you because you’re an ass,” Cas said, matter-of-factly.

Fifteen minutes or so passed, and Dean started to worry. He hoped that Cas was feeling ok.
“Alright Winchesters. Who’s ready to eat?” Sam eventually broke up the hug and motioned for everyone to grab a plate and start filling it with food.
“It wasn’t that bad. I guess I got a little over excited and misinterpreted things.”
“Foremost, I wanted to apologize for running off on you earlier this week. I wasn’t thinking,” Cas said sincerely. “I was spiraling, and it wasn’t until I was in the car that I realized how that must’ve looked.”
Dean had no words. If he was understanding this correctly, then the boy had purposely created an intimate situation between the two of them like some sort of kiddie matchmaker. He wasn’t sure if he should be impressed or if he should feel violated. Either way, he couldn’t shake Jack’s words for the rest of the day, and every time he thought of the implications of such comments, his heart fluttered. Fuck, he really was falling for Castiel. Or maybe he already did.
“Of course. But I think I’ll hold off on talking about the future with him for a little bit because right now I just want to be present with him. I’d rather save the what-ifs, and live in the moment, you know?”
“Wow, looking good, Dean!” Charlie exclaimed.
Dean hoped that was true.
There was a frustrated sigh on the other end of the line.
“Seriously? How’s that even possible?”
“Sounds good,” Sam responded as he unhooked himself from his brother’s arm and began to pack up his stuff.
“You kids look like you’ve never seen a home-cooked meal before,” he dipped a rubber spoon into what appeared to be an alfredo sauce and tasted it. “Mmm, this used to be your mom’s favorite, you know? I used to make fettuccine all the time before you kids were born. I think I only made it once or twice when you were little, Dean. Couldn’t get you to eat the broccoli for the life of me,” he chuckled as he stirred. “Hey, why don’t you boys work on getting that dough rolled out and cut into noodles?”
“Make it more elaborate then.”
“Sounds fancy. There a dress code?”
“I didn’t think it was anyone’s business really. Besides, it’s complicated. I mostly go for women. However, if a hot guy comes around, I’m not going to say no. Like the lawyer. His ass was…”
“With robotics?”
“You're an idiot,” the angel smiled, "I'm talking about you."
Dean didn’t fight it. He finally let himself go, melting into Cas’s embrace and crying like in those damn movies. Lucky Sam was not awake to watch him completely unravel, even if it was in a good way. They were tears of relief, of freedom, as cheesy as it sounded. Cas held him tight, and neither seemed inclined to pull away. Before they knew it, both boys fell asleep.
“Did something happen? You seemed fine earlier in class.”
There was a period of silence before Cas looked up from his papers. A concerned look fell over his face.
"Sam."
Dean just shook his head, laughing.
“Because I’m still not sure how this will play out, and I didn’t want you getting ahead of yourself. Of course, I am optimistic that he will say yes because I know Cas cares about me, but still...at the end of the day, he’s an angel. Who’s to say that he won’t get sick of dealing with my human crap one day? I just don’t know if he...and do I even deserve for him...” his voice trailed off as those self-deprecating thoughts began to flood his brain again.
Cas’s smile grew larger at the second use of the word “Dad” in only a few hours. He could get used to it.
“I know that, but…”
“I think I have a right to be,” Dean replied. “We’re only talking about one of the biggest moments of my life here. I’m sort of short circuiting just thinking about it.”
“Please don’t call me babe.”
“It’s ok, Dean. You weren’t ready. To be honest, I’m not sure I was either. I had never been someone’s boyfriend before and was still pretty new to the whole attraction thing. So you can imagine how clueless I was.”
_____________
“Perhaps it was low on grace?” Jack suggested.
“You think so?” Dean chuckled. “Alright, let’s test this. You be you, and I’ll be the dinosaur. You show me some of your moves.”
Met sighed.
“Thank you,” Michael said. “Now run along.”
Dean sniffled a little, but tried to remain visibly unaffected.
"Um, yeah, I'll look into it," Dean said.
I wish to hear your voice. Would you be open to a phone conversation?
“Is he always like this?” Dean had whispered to Cas.
Dean wanted to slap himself, but he couldn’t resist asking the obvious question. He needed to know, and then he would drop the subject before he got himself into trouble.
“Of course I am! How could I not be when you just…”
“Your server will be with you in a moment,” the man handed them each a menu before returning to his post.
“My thoughts exactly,” Sam replied. “Plus, those skills won’t be in isolation because a big part of debate is working with ideas that may be different than my own. My ability to listen and adjust my own arguments to accommodate for new information or for a varying perspective is critical to reaching the most logical answer which ultimately would win the debate.”
“What? No. Why would you say that? Cas and I are as good as ever.”
“You’re up,” he whispered.
Hey Cas,
With love,
There he goes. Protective brother mode activated. Dean rolled his eyes, although he couldn’t be too mad considering he would probably do the same thing if the roles were reversed. Sighing, he patted Sam’s shoulder.
Cas shrugged.
“Anything stronger?”
The Big Day: Part 1
John considered this and shrugged.
“I’m fine, Dean. I told you, I don’t mind it down here.”
“What did he say?”
“For sure.”
“But I did.”
Dean cut him off. He had an idea, although he knew his brother wouldn’t like it. He didn’t even really like it, but it seemed like the best option.
It was an awkward hug. The angle was off, and being in the front of the Impala did not make things any better, but somehow the moment couldn’t have been more perfect. Dean soaked it in for all it was worth, and when Cas eventually tried to pull away, he struggled to let go. They stared at each other for awhile, neither knowing exactly what to do next.
“For your information, it’s a very interesting podcast about Gandhi. But never mind that. What’s going on with you two? Why are you fighting?”
One word-his name- and Castiel already felt himself losing his grip.
“You seem troubled. Is this about Castiel?”
The boy gave him a soft smile. Suddenly, Dean felt a whole lot better about the way he looked. He walked back into the dressing room with a surprised but slightly proud expression on his face.
“Hey Dean?” he heard Sam’s voice on the other side of the door. “Are you ok? You’ve been in there awhile.”
“I imagine he’s probably off planning his own little surprise for you,” Sam replied over his shoulder.
You can pick back up at the emails.
“Elijah was a friend of mine from right after I came out. We were really close because we used to walk home together every Sunday after youth group and then hang out at my house. He was queer too, but he was deeply closeted which made things awkward with Gabriel, as you can imagine.”
“About?”
“He’s not even paying attention,” Gabriel mumbled.
“You are such a smartass sometimes, you know that?” Dean tried to be annoyed, but Cas’s bitchy attitude was always such a turn on. “Get over here.” He intended to kiss that damn smirk off the angel’s face.
"Why?" Dean mouthed.
“No,” Cas sniffled. “I think it’d be best if I just go home. I’ve embarrassed him enough as it is.”
“We can talk about it at lunch, ok? I was going to hold off until after the parade, but I can’t wait that long.”
“I still drive,” Cas cringed at how off pitch he sounded, but he had to admit this was kind of fun.
“Did you get up at all during the night to use the restroom? If you were half asleep you could’ve shut it by accident?” Dean suggested.
“Good morning, Principal Met,” Cas said calmly.
“I want to have a life with Dean, grow old with him. It’ll be a big adjustment, and I know he will feel guilty, but in the end I need to do what is best for me. Now, I’m not certain what that means yet, but I’m hoping a few more days as a human will help clarify things.”
“You tell the kid?” Dean asked.
“Oh.”
“Yes?” The angel pulled back so he could look him in the eyes.
“We manage,” Dean bit his lip, looking anywhere but at the other boy in an attempt to get his beating heart under control.
“But you will talk to him before I do this, right?”
“I mean, sure,” Sam mumbled, “It’s just that you seem on edge.”
“Ok, so for the first few lines, I was thinking just like your basic Waltz.”
“Actually, I think that would be nice. Plus, it’s senior year, so I probably shouldn’t skip. Social milestones and all that,” he put air quotes around that last part.
“No, but…”
The next morning at the Novak’s. Dean and Cas share some cute moments; Dean joins Cas at his youth group.
“You stay there. I’ll come to you.”
“Yeah,” Dean rubbed his neck.
Dean noted the sadness in his brother’s eyes, but Sam refused to draw attention to it. Instead, he patted Dean on the back and tried to change the subject.
“We fell asleep off. It’s 8 o’clock.”
“Since when do you dance?”
“Technically it’s an overcoat. And this is more comfortable” he snuggled into the robe, “As for my hair, I suppose it’s worse when I actually sleep. Most of the time, it’s just a little messy from lying my head on the pillow,” the angel scratched his head as he walked further into the room.
“Hey guys!” Dean called to the others to alert them of his departure. “I forgot my phone in one of the dressing rooms. I’m going to go look for it.”
“I guess one sip wouldn’t hurt.”
“Anyway,” he continued, “You can wait here in the car, or you’re welcome to come up with us. Maybe stay for some hot chocolate before I take you home?”
“I don’t know. It’s just that if you get along with those people, maybe you should join. You don’t really talk much about anybody from robotics. Plus, you have autotech, so it’s not like you won’t get to mess around with machinery if you decide to quit.”
“Jack, is it possible for you to subdue my grace for awhile longer?”
“Who was that guy you were talking to?”
“Ah, he’s awake. Hello darling,” Dean could recognize that accent anywhere.
Dean hung up just in time for the sales woman to return with some more of the bee rings.
“Shoot, that’s right. I almost forgot,” Cas glanced at Dean. “We aren’t scheduled to volunteer anywhere so it’ll probably just be a discussion. I suppose I could miss it this time. Afterall, I should really stay with Dean.”
“You think so? Cause like I said before, Sammy doesn’t appreciate it too much. Then again, it could just be because he doesn’t always like my music choices.”
“You’re not sure?”
“I was just helping you, Dean.”
“Bitch,” Dean wheezed.
"Oh, because that wouldn't be suspicious at all. He thinks I'm at the dog park, remember? Besides, who just calls someone and asks how big their fingers are? That would sound insane."
“This was never the life your mother and I wanted for you. Imagine how she would feel if she knew about this or that you had exposed your brother to such deviancy.
Dean gave Sam a confused look at the use of their last name, and Sam just winked. It took him a second before…
“Sam, he’s God, remember?” Dean shook his head, laughing. “Where is the little guy anyway?”
Jack pondered the question for a moment, not wanting to expose Dean’s secret. Then, he smiled.
“Well that sucks. But I guess that gives you the chance to check out the available fellas, right?” Dean was laughing, but there was a hint of jealousy in his voice as he pictured Castiel with other guys. Cas didn’t seem to notice. Rather, he averted eye contact and sighed.
“Well, no.”
“He probably won’t.”
“But the cost…”
“He said to tell you that he loves you.”
“Appreciate it, Eileen, but I’m not that hungry right now,” Dean stated.
Cas’s eyes fluttered open. He looked around, temporarily failing to remember where he was. Then he looked up at Dean, and it clicked.
“I want to though. Plus, it wouldn’t be that much of a risk. My dad sure as hell isn’t going to come near a school parade, and Sammy...well, it’s been two months now, and I think it’s time I said something.”
“All sorts of things really. School, family, my future, my identity. I’ve spent the past few weeks thinking about you actually,” he blushed. “Although that was mostly fantasy.”
“Huh?” Dean raised his head. “Oh, it was just Bobby calling to let me know he’s on his way. The plane’s boarding.”
“I mean, Sammy already said that he thinks she likes you too. I doubt she’ll say no.”
“How long do you think Dad will be gone this time?” he spoke plainly, barely any emotion detectable in his voice.
“I don’t…”
“You’re brave, you're determined, and you always know how to handle these tough situations. That’s really awesome, and…” Dean hesitated for a moment, “ I want you to know that you’ve really helped me out these past few weeks.”
“It’s not a bad thing. Variety is good. I’m just curious.”
“It’s not that simple,” Cas finally met his gaze, “I am attracted to you. Aesthetically, you’re very handsome, and emotionally, I think you have a beautiful soul and the biggest heart of anyone I know. I would love nothing more than to be in a relationship with you,” he sighed again. “The problem lies in the sexual aspect. The idea of sex has never interested me and, to be quite honest, it makes me uncomfortable.”
“Without Dean? He loves Dory.”
“Yes, but he’s still concerned I’m just telling him what he wants to hear.”
Stripping down to his underwear and socks, he stared at himself in the mirror for awhile. He hugged his chest, feeling a bit exposed and also slightly cold since he had chosen the stall with a vent right above it. Sighing, he slipped on some dark grey pants, and attempted to fasten his shirt, a light blue button-down. It took a few tries before he was finally able to get all the buttons up to his neck because his hands were shaking and kept slipping. Finally, he threw on the jacket which matched the pants. He hadn’t bothered to grab a tie because he wasn’t sure how to put it on, and he didn’t feel comfortable asking his brother for help in front of everybody. He did wish he had grabbed some dress shoes, however, because he felt stupid standing there in formal wear with his Scooby Doo socks. He wondered if he should maybe take those off too and go out barefoot. That might be for the best.
“Open it,” Jack grinned proudly as his father figure unfolded the page to reveal a drawing of Cas, Sam, Dean, and himself.
“Yes, for two. It should be under Winchester,” Cas managed to say.
“That’s right. Sam did mention something about that, I think. So, I’m going to take a guess and say not a girly girl, huh?”
“Dinner was great, Dad,” Dean praised as he scrubbed the dishes. “Thank you.”
“I don’t want to take any more away from your first dance experience,” Cas sighed.
“I had a close friend. That’s all it was, but Gabriel can be presumptuous,” he rolled his eyes. “There were even a few instances when I caught him typing out messages to him from my phone. I felt violated to say the least. And before you ask, I do have a passcode, but he always manages to crack it. At least with email, he usually leaves me alone because he sees the laptop and thinks I’m working on something for class.”
“Dean, I haven’t been completely honest with you,” he admitted.
The remainder of the trip was a lot livelier with Dean making jokes and attempting to teach Cas how to play road games like “I Spy” and “20 questions.” Key word is “attempting” as Cas always wanted to make things more complicated than they needed to be. Dean didn’t mind though. However, he nearly drove them off the road when Cas’s clue for a cow sent him into a laughing attack. Something about the cow playing a role in bringing the boys to the yard because one needs milk to make a milkshake. It was super corny and would probably annoy a stranger, but for Dean, it was one of the funniest things he’s heard. It was random comments like that from Cas that reminded Dean of how smitten he was for that dorky little dude. When they arrived, Dean was taken aback when Cas immediately unhooked his seatbelt and rushed out and around to Dean’s side of the car to open his door for him.
“Jack, did you draw on me because you knew Cas would get close to me to wipe it off? You wanted us to...”
“Thank you for this,” Dean whispered, “It’s good to see your face. It seems like it’s been forever.”
“You alright?”
You’re such a sap...but it’s a nice image.
“I should’ve listened to what you had to say instead of letting fear control me.”
“No, tell me.”
Jack nodded.
“Hm?”
“I’m not going to say it explicitly because, like you said, you could ‘spontaneously combust’, but yes, it’s reciprocated.”
Cas stared at him as if he couldn’t quite wrap his head around the possibility of anyone ever asking him to go with them. Even after their heartfelt talk and the agreement to give eachother a shot, there was something about this request that was hard to take in. Perhaps it was the tangibility of it with the physical representation of Dean’s affection. Or maybe it was the fact that Sam was right there, and it was a surprise to see Dean so openly expressing himself in his brother’s presence. Whatever the reason, Dean couldn’t blame him for taking his time because it was a bit surreal for him too.
“Dead or alive,” Dean grinned, “Alright, together now.”
“Dean.”
“I wish I could, but I want to practice a little before I go on.”
“Ok, now put your left hand above my waist. I’m going to put a hand on your shoulder. And then we just hold each other’s free hands out to the side a little bit like this,” he helped position Dean.
“Yea?” Dean looked back over his shoulder.
“Are you ok?”
“Alright” Dean pulled Cas to his feet. “Let’s grab Sam.”
Eileen noticed the exchange and smirked.
“Speaking of, have you thought any more about potentially joining Pride Alliance?” he turned so that he could look Dean in the eyes, his own shining brightly with optimism.
“That’s cool. Hey, uh, does he have a connection to Claire Novak? She’s in my pottery class, and I always thought there was a slight resemblance. Plus Novak isn’t that common of a last name, so I figured they might be related.”
“It’s not a big deal. Just being outside helps calm me.”
“Perhaps not, but might as well bring some life to the party,” he rolled his eyes and took a sip of punch from a cup he was holding. “It’s more for me than anyone else. This dance is such a drag.”
“Yes.”
“Cas, what was that?” Dean asked once they were alone.
“You don’t need to prove anything to me, Dean. I know you care, and you must understand how difficult it is for me to say no.”
“Gabriel, we do have an impressionable child present, so could you please watch your language,” Michael said disapprovingly.
Sam’s eyes widened.
Cas’s face turned a deep red. Dean thought his heart stopped.
“Yeah, I guess. Um, what about you?”
“Are you alright?”  the boy put his hand on Dean’s shoulder and squeezed, lightly. “You seem a little out of it.”
“Alright,” Cas nodded as Sam disappeared into the hall.
____________________
“What path? Happiness?” Dean’s voice cracked a little.
“What can I say? I’m a sucker for the classics,” Dean chuckled and opened the passenger side door for Cas to climb inside, making note of the slight flush in the other boy’s cheeks upon this gesture.
“Yeah, probably. Which means you and Cas will have the bunker to yourselves. So, there’s your head start,” Sam moved his eyebrows up and down. “I’ll make sure to lock my door this time.”
“I’ll be fine.”
“It may not fix the problem, but it’ll make you feel better.”
“I guess that’s fair. But then again, I’m kinda biased since I’m the big brother. I look out for Sammy even if it costs him some of his dignity.”
“Yeah, I mean, women are hot. The sex is good. However, sometimes I feel attracted to some of my guy friends. Not even sexually per say, but there’s a connection there that doesn’t feel normal. I wouldn’t be opposed to having sex with a guy, but I have never even kissed one, so who knows.”
“Nowhere, Dean,” he tilted his head, “I’ve been next to you this whole time.”
“Snacks?”
“You’re not happy. You’re delusional. Let go of his hand right now and both you and Sam go to your room.”
“Hello?” he prompted.
“I don't know. I mean, he's not super traditional if that's what you mean. Not too showy either...at least when it comes to his appearance," Dean giggled a little because Cas could certainly be over the top when it came to other things (his initial entrance in that barn where they met came to mind). "Anyway, I don't think a diamond would be the right fit."
“Yeah, I’m not saying that.”
“I have money,” was all Cas said before handing the box over to Jack.
“I’ll go in, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to return to the group just yet. I’m still a little shaky.”
“It’s not really mine either, to be honest. I’m not big into crowds or loud music, but Charlie usually forces me to go.”
“We know that, Dean, but you’ll feel better if you take a breather and eat something.”
Warmly,
To: mythoughtfulspot.castiel@yahoo.com
“Actually, I think I see Charlie now,” Cas squinted his eyes and focused on a spot of red hair in the doorway to the gymnasium. “Come on,” he pulled Dean in that direction and motioned for Crowley to follow them.
(Sam: "Repeat the in and out, ok?")
“If that’s your wish, I want to help,” he finally said, “I’ll miss you though.”
“What is it?” Cas took the offering and inspected it.
“Yeah, he’s certainly the brainy one in the family. But I’m the hot one, so it’s fine,” Dean laughed until Sam elbowed him in the ribs- worth it.
“Right this way,” the woman led him to a line of display cases at the back of the room. “We have quite a few designs available right now, but we can also order from the catalogue if you don’t see anything you like.”
“I have to get to class. I love you,” and with that, he walked away, leaving Dean alone with the realization that Cas did this because of him.
After dropping Sam off at the apartment, Dean felt the reality of the situation setting in. He glanced over at Cas, and a part of him became rather giddy because, despite taking Cas home after school multiple times before, this was going to be his first time actually hanging out with him at the Novak house. That was a big deal, he thought, since Castiel rarely allowed visitors. He said it was due to the complexity of his living situation- so many people under one roof and family drama- but it might also be influenced by the fact that he was a private person by nature. It was hard to believe considering he was so open and confident when Dean was around, but according to Charlie, he was usually quiet and hesitant to reveal elements of his personal life to others. Even in Pride Alliance, he only tapped into the parts that were useful for the purposes of whatever activity they were engaging in. It was a carefully tailored public persona, and the only ones that were granted access to what lay beyond that were people he shared a close bond with and trusted sincerely. The list was short, so Dean was honored to be among the few Cas experienced such a connection with, especially since they had only been friends a couple months. Pulling around the corner to Castiel’s street, Dean noticed a sudden change in his friend’s demeanor. His shoulders appeared tense, and his expression worried. Dean’s hand fell on his arm, a gesture of concern, and he sighed.
“Bring him too. Charlie won’t mind. In fact, maybe we can form a little group with some of the club members. That could be fun.”
“Hey,” he poked Charlie to get her attention. “I’m going to go look for Cas. He hasn’t come back, and I should see what’s going on.”
“Take your time. Eileen and I will be fine.”
“Can I…” he hesitated. “Can I kiss you?”
Dean nodded.
“Earlier with Gabriel. You seemed pretty upset.”
It was a message from Sam. It could wait.
Sighing, Dean glanced over at his brother who was trudging along beside him, humming something that Dean couldn’t quite place. He was dressed in his usual flannel and jeans along with a brand new pair of sneakers that his older brother had bought using some cash he swiped from their dad. Dean had also taken him to get his hair cut the day before, so Sammy was all cleaned up and ready to impress. That’s what Dean hoped anyway. Starting over had always been difficult for Sam, especially with bullies who isolate the new kids, so he wanted to do everything possible to bring forth positive rather than negative attention. At least this year Sammy was old enough to attend the same school, so Dean could keep an eye on things and kick some asses if needed. That thought comforted him as they walked.
“Nah, that’s ok. I’ll tell you what. I’ll order it, and then maybe I’ll let you try some,” he winked, “What about the lobster tail, huh? That’s fancy.”
Dean’s jaw nearly dropped when Castiel emerged from the bedroom in his new navy blue suit. Unlike his usual attire, it hugged his body in all the right places, and the color really brought out his eyes. He also traded in his normal tie for a charming grey bow. He looked stunning, like a fucking prince. In comparison, Dean felt like his own appearance was subpar.
“You could do that. On the other hand…” Dean thought through his next words, carefully.
Was he? His face was heating up.
“This is your car?”
“Personal?”
“But Dean,” his brother silenced him.
Cas gave her a shy smile. Something told Dean that Charlie had been bugging him about this for awhile and would probably never let him live it down. As embarrassing as it was, considering he too should’ve admitted his feelings a long time ago, Dean couldn’t help but be amused at the look of triumph on Charlie’s face.
Dean touched his face which was hot. That wasn’t planned, but he would roll with it.
“I’ll pass on the hot chocolate, but will it be alright if I use your restroom?”
“Heh, what a gentlemen,” he looked up at Cas who had his hand held out to him.
“Just...how much I love you,” Dean noticed the hesitance in his voice, and he wondered what was really on his mind.
"Does he have a favorite color?" the woman pulled out some rings in various hues.
“No, you were wonderful,” Cas turned to face him. “You were being true to your feelings, and that is something I appreciate more than anything. My subsequent behavior was derived from my own insecurity and had nothing to do with you. Not that intention matters because, bottomline, distancing myself hurt you. For that, I am sorry.”
“It’s nice to meet you, Dean. I wish it could be under better circumstances.”
“It’s suppressed, not gone. You made me so happy, I guess...I don’t know. Energy boost?” Cas muttered.
“Tense? I’m not sure what you mean.”
“Huh? No, nothing like that. Dad can just be nosy sometimes, you know? It’s not his business, so he doesn’t need to hear it.”
“First of all, congratulations! That’s a big deal, so of course you want to look good. Second, do you have any idea what your fiancé might be wearing? That can help us narrow it down.”
I know I said I would have this up yesterday, and sadly I didn't get it finished and edited on time. But here it is. To make it up to you all, I've decided to do another chapter following this one that dives into Cas's thoughts about possibly becoming human permanently as well as the two of them talking to Sam and Jack in the morning.
“Alright, Benny can hand out candy. Everyone else takes a flag. Got it?”
“He’s not…” Cas paused, a bit flustered, but he quickly composed himself. “He’s a new student. We met earlier this week, and I invited him to come to the meeting. Now, could you please control yourself? I don’t need you scaring him off by being creepy.”
“Back seat. Under the blanket.”
Michael chewed on his lip as he considered it.
Dean was taken aback by the power of Sam’s words. He had been so preoccupied with his own problems that he neglected his brother’s. Sammy had his own bones to pick, and Dean was proud of him for speaking up, but now he felt bad for silencing him earlier. However, that was something the two of them could discuss another time. Right then, Dean let Sam have the floor.
