"I've never seen your wings," Sam says, disappointment dripping from his voice.  A look of slight hope across his face though as he looks at Cas.
"Thank you. He must really have thought we were the classic case of the Bechdel Test, huh?" Eileen adds.
“Run out of beer already?” Eileen says while signing.
Sam and Cas just frown at him but don’t say anything more.
"Will I be able to?" Sam asks. "Or will they burn my eyes out?"
Eileen and Sam share a knowing glance and smile as they move closer together too.
"I heard you learned some things from the pizza man."
“If you are asking if I will miss being an angel, you would be correct. Being an angel has been a large part of who I am. But it's also now part of my past. When I look back on my time as an angel, it will be out of nostalgia.”
Castiel reaches his hand out. Dean swallows hard and not taking his eyes off the set of blue in front of him, he clasps the man’s hand. A sudden spark of warmth shoots through Dean’s body, causing the blush to deepen. Castiel moves his other hand over both of theirs and smiles. His hands are as warm as his eyes and smile.
"That makes sense." Cas said, still not sure where this was going.
The angel slipped behind the wheel of his once-stolen truck, only then allowing himself to hesitate. He opened the small bag he had with him and double checked its contents, making sure he wasn't forgetting anything he might need where he was going. Once satisfied he swallowed, feeling a small tug of uncertainty. It quickly burnt itself out however and Cas started the truck, pulling away from the familiar bunker.
"Good for you, man." Sam said at last. He raised his hand in a placating gesture when Dean snapped his head up to glare at him. "I mean it Dean." He turned his attention back down to his bottle, his voice softening and taking on a sort of wistful tone. "Hey, if you can find something good in this world, you should take it."
"Gave in. I begged him to come find you, but he just vanished."
Cas nodded, slowing his step, and examining each footfall before he made it.
"Tough." Cas struggled to maintain his serious composure.
Dean's eyes narrowed. "So you want Sam to leave Cas and I behind."
actually had a significant impact on him. He could hope.
"Yeah…" Dean said absently, feeling a twinge of dejavu alongside a sliver of something he couldn't quite put his finger on. Something not right about the similarity. "Seems like."
Cas cleared his throat. "How are
"Sam-"
Crowley rolled his eyes, but he put out his two hands, and suddenly the trio was in the complex. The next instant Dean was alone and the demon and former angel were in front of Malachi himself.
"Dean, I'm not sure if it is wise that Sam leaves."
"So, either of you going to tell me what yesterday was all about, or am I going to have to bribe Cas for answers?"
This prison was getting old, fast.
"Zeek… what the hell is going on!?"
He hadn't made the decision alone. As soon as he finally figured out it could be done, he talked with Sam. He admitted he wanted to let go of his grace, become human once more. He admitted that he feared he was more useful to them as an angel, arguing that it was just safer if he was in possession of his grace. As soon as he made the argument, he had pretty much convinced himself, and he tried to withdraw the question.
"Yeah." Sam replied absently.
"Still."
Sam sighed. "Great."
Dean nodded, slowly orienting himself.
Dean frowned, looking for a second like he might argue, but he closed his mouth, relaxing against the seat back. Cas took that as permission, and he slipped behind the wheel. Dean just shifted to look out the window as Cas pulled the Impala back onto the highway.
"I'm sorry, did he just say there are no angels in heaven?"
"I don't know where the stupid grace is, or if he even had any." Erelah spat.
Cas let the silence settle in around them for a moment before changing the subject. "Would you assist in untangling Paka's fur?"
The hunter hesitated for a moment, his face morphing into pain and regret. "Cas…" He tried to form an apology, but he could feel the static rising with his anger, and he knew he
"Yeah, but we have a problem." He flipped it open. "I have no idea what language this even is." He glared at Crowley. "Can you read this?"
"Yeah, what'd you use for that?" Sam asked, looking at the reddish marks and wrinkling his nose at the strong scent.
." He hissed.
"Then what am I smelling catch fire?"
"Why are you doing this?" Dean demanded.
"Ha ha." Sam rolled his eyes, but walked over to the fridge, pulling out a bottle of water. He closed the doors, and leaned against the industrial unit, watching his brother, trying to take in his body language, or any indication on his thoughts. "You sleep in those clothes?"
"I do not know if that is wise."
"What happened?"
"It's the only answer I have."
Dean considered this. "Did Metatron hurt Sam?"
"The weapon he used on Abel." Dean finished.
Dean pulled his t-shirt on over his head. "No, but nothing about him surprises me anymore. Wait, New York, near Dad's old unit?"
An answering hum of contentment worms its way into his ears, echoing around.
They spend the rest of the afternoon baking. Dean teaches Cas how to make dough from scratch and they bake both pumpkin and apple pie. The scent of cinnamon and spices fills the house, making Dean feel like this place is finally home. He glances at Cas as Cas fills the pumpkin pie shell up, making sure not to spill. Their eyes meet as Cas feels Dean's eyes on him and they stare. It's nothing new, Cas always stared at Dean intensely, but instead of having to push it down, acting like it wasn't anything different, acting like he didn't love every second of it, Dean embraces it, staring right back with probably the same dumb lovestruck look on his face.
Day Twelve: Hellbound
He stands up and his long legs quickly take him across the factory in record time. He leaves the door open behind him, letting the light through.
“Are you enjoying this sweetheart?” Dean asks, and while Cas knows he’s asking about the show, he thinks about his hand in Dean’s, the dancing light reflecting off both of theirs now, of Dean’s shoulder and head bringing a calming comfort, and he responds, “Yes, Dean. Very much so.”
Dean's feet finally find their way and he makes it to the bed as Cas slowly sits up. He sits down next to him, fitting the tray over Cas' lap, aligning the sides of their bodies together, letting Cas lean against his shoulder.
Sleepy Hollow has very similar dynamics as well. The strong FBI agent who finds herself in a strange situation. She quickly adapts and is there for her new partner and the town as they fight the events that lead to Ichabod Crane being lost in time. Due to this man-out-of-time circumstance, Crane is frequently seen as weird to fellow characters but as the show went on, people adjusted and learned to love him (platonically.)
Dean moves his hand and places it on the back of Cas’ neck and rifles through his hair, turning soft circles and pulling on the curls.
Cas smiles and closes the kiss. The salt of Dean’s lips, the warmth and wetness of his mouth and tongue overwhelm Cas’ senses again. He dips his hands down and feels the lace covering Dean’s ass. It brings a smile against Dean’s mouth.
Cas looks up at him, his face beaming with even more admiration.
"What?" Sam says, turning to Jack.
But each word hits its mark, sharply embedding into the flesh.
“Alright, let’s go bitches!” Charlie butts in, raising her beer for emphasis.
Day One: Harvest
He won't let Cas touch or care for the pumpkins he has growing in the backyard, claiming it's because Cas has enough going on with his own garden but it is actually because Dean wants to do this part by himself - Cas should only experience the fun parts of the day.
Dean pulls back, wraps his arm around Cas' and looks back at Sam. "I know."
“I’ve got you. You’ll be okay,” Cas’ words eventually make it through the ringing and fog of Dean’s brain into some semblance of sense.
Cas blushes and checks his hat in the mirror, turning around to give Dean a look of "do I look all right?"
“Yes,” Cas says, now looking at Dean in that intense way, his eyes shining like they are looking right at Dean’s soul.
Dean wants to make everything perfect. It's what Cas deserves on his first official Halloween as a human.
“Hell no!” Eileen replies. “Let’s get him!”
The smells of the factory have been replaced by the familiar: the bunker’s slightly stale air, the fresh laundry smell of the pile of clothes next to them, and Dean inhales a unique sensation into the mix. This one is also familiar but one Dean never let himself think about. Dean leans forward breathing in his surroundings and knows he is home.
Cas leans in and dips his head into the crook of Dean’s neck. He feels Dean’s breath hitch as he breathes on his skin. He blows on it and Dean moans, tilting his head back in a gesture of vulnerability and to say “don’t stop.”
Cas’ mouth opens and a strained “Dean” escapes out of his lips and into Dean’s mind. The look of worry is lifelike and Dean thanks his mind for giving him such a realistic representation.
“Oh,” Cas responds, squinting and cocking his head.
"Multicolored, like my true vessel," Cas replies.
Clearing his throat, Dean gets giddy, grabs the bowl of candy and Cas' hand, drags him to the door. He opens it to see the neighbor kids from the farm down the road. They are dressed up as the Scooby gang and Dean smirks at Cas.
As the evening approaches, Dean grabs a bowl he bought this morning specifically for this instance.
The three women chuckle and down the rest of their drinks.
Cas' nose twitches, his head rises, arm stretches out, and in a gravelly voice he says, "Coffee. Give me."
“Well, let’s get back to work, ladies. Tell us Rowena about this new spell you’re working on. We’ve got a lot to learn tonight.”
His flashlight lost in the shuffle, he strains his eyes in the dark, searching for Sam or the enemies they are fighting. His ears are ringing, messing up his equilibrium.
The aroma of apples and spices hangs heavy in the kitchen. Warmth from the oven preheating fills the kitchen making the air hang heavier, completely filling Cas’ senses and seeping into the walls and surrounding rooms.
Cas never really saw the point of the modern American Halloween tradition: children dressing up in costumes and going door to door asking strangers for candy? Seems ill-advised to him.
A flutter of wings breaks the silence and the three heads at the bunker table turn to see a grinning Jack, hand raised in greeting.
“Yes,” Cas replies. “Nostalgia is a good thing in small increments. I will look back on our time together, my time with humans, falling in love with humanity. My time with my brothers and sisters. Gabriel’s ability to both irritate me and make me laugh. Balthazar by my side as we laid siege to hell to save the righteous man. The moment when I saw Dean, his meat suit completely tattered, his soul slightly tarnished but shining so bright it was blinding.”
Seconds ticked into minutes, and Sam frowned, sending a text off to his brother.
Cas moved, switching places with Dean without words, kneeling to help the child, letting Dean take over a defensive position.
"Have you seen Dean?"
Cas thoughtfully ate his own overdone breakfast, also without complaint. He was staring as the cat finished her turkey and sipped from the coffee mug full of water before stretching and hopping down to go off and explore. "I do not know how to remove the tangled parts of her fur." He admitted.
"Yeah." Dean said weakly, recalling Cas following Dean right to his death in the end.
Sam's voice was weak on the other end. "Okay…I'm an hour away. I will be there shortly."
She turned, tears reflecting in her eyes. "My brother took my son out… they were supposed to be back hours ago. Bill would never keep them out this long,
Kevin shook his head. "How'd he even get out? Isn't this place like a steel trap for demons?"
The kid shook his head, tears making a return as he considered facing the monster again.
"But eventually he'll get suspicious." Sam finished. "Great."
"This is difficult."
Dean grunted his frustration as he flexed his arms under the shackles.
"Dean." Cas pleaded softly. "Please don't kill anyone else just to keep me alive." He closed his eyes, figuring the request was useless. "I don't want to be saved that way."
Dean finished rubbing at least some of the blood off the first blade. He turned around to lean against the bench, arms crossed over his bare chest as he watched Cas. "Does that bother you?"
"Remind me Castiel, how many innocent lives have you taken?" Dean pulled himself from the counter. "How many people did you kill when you played God?" He shook his head. "So don't you try to pretend you have the moral high ground here."
"Are you-" Sam fiddled with the bottle of beer in his hands, letting it take his focus for a moment. He had been insistent to himself that he confront his brother, not Cas, but he was starting to think this would have gone better if he had just backed the angel into a corner and forced him to talk. "You two seem pretty close."
Dean meanwhile tried not to think about how he was overcompensating for his hasty exit when he bought all of this food. The new day was a blank slate, and they could move on from here.
"I'm real, Dean."
The former angel gave a weak smile. "Yeah. Pretty good all things considered."
Dean pulled his t-shirt on over his head. "No, but nothing about him surprises me anymore. Wait, New York, near Dad's old unit?"
"Yeah." Dean said simply. He turned back to stare at the angel again, searching his blue eyes for something that would tell him something about what the angel was thinking. "God Cas, do you even feel
"Oh, fuck you." Dean snapped, pulling himself up and dusting off his clothes. He took a moment to be grateful he didn't need to breathe, because that would have certainly knocked the wind out of him.
Malachi stepped back and leaned casually against the wall. "Castiel, last chance. Tell me what Metatron's plans are, or Theo here does what he does best."
"Yeah." Dean said, distractedly. "Eventually you get hurt in enough hunts, CPS starts to think something is wrong with the way you're raised. Eventually when I got hurt on hunts it was easier to let me heal at Bobby's and skip school for a couple months than deal with cops at the hospital."
He had to close his eyes against the sudden vertigo, breathing through it until it dissipated. He forced himself to open them again, looking down to assess the remaining damage. He lifted his fingers to gently graze the gash in his chest and winced. He had hoped he would have been more healed by now. At least the cuts across his palms were mostly gone.
He keenly felt the fear as he watched Dean's spark finally burning down to embers. Like witness to a slow death, he worried he was seeing Dean's brief life come to an end. He hoped they could get the mark off before it consumed him entirely. Before he got too reckless on a hunt and it claimed him. Or worse. Before the mark corrupted him into something entirely unrecognizable.
"We got into a scuffle with some demons. We were locked down with a spell, no signal."
"We don't talk about that." Sam cleared his throat, confirming the angel's suspicion. "You see the things Kevin sent?"
"He did not. He returned when he sensed me break the tablet." Cas let his hand drop back to his side, feeling a little more at ease for the moment. "Metatron is dead."
Dean laughed, stepping back and letting Cas lean fully back on the wall. "Yeah, I'm not an idiot. I know how to cure a demon."
Cas furrowed his brow and tilted his head.
Cas sat up, watching him leave, and hearing the shower switch on a moment later. He couldn't help a gentle smile in spite of the overwhelming nature of recent events. He felt a warmth settle in his chest, and he held onto the comforting feeling. The angel switched into his own clothes before heading out of the motel room to pick up breakfast and a coffee for Dean.
Cas waited for Dean to continue.
"What the hell is up with you and Cas?"
"I did spend an entire day in the rain with no relief."
Castiel closed his eyes against the sounds of her muffled struggle. The room fell silent as her life faded away.
he had intruded on a very personal and private moment. He stood in the hallway just outside the door for a moment, the plate of pie that was still in his hands forgotten. He started towards the kitchen again on autopilot, trying to think about what he had just seen.
"I can explain." The other angel had his hands up very clearly now.
His eyes snapped open when he heard Sam enter the room. He lifted his head, looking up at the younger hunter as he walked and sat in the chair beside the bed. He had a book in his hand.
"Apparently." Dean finished his second cup of coffee. "He healed me."
"That's not your call." Cas said firmly.
He didn't light it yet. He knew that the wendigo likely was going to let them almost back to the car. The last leg of their journey was the dangerous part.
"There are two deeper parts of hell. One is of course the cage, and the other is, amongst demons, known as the hole." Castiel felt discomfort growing at talking at length about his siege on hell. "There is no part of hell that runs slower than time moves on earth besides the hole.
Cas looked up at Dean's questioning expression. "Only by name." He turned his attention back to the phone. "It's the weapon the archangels used to kill the knights of hell in the first place."
Claws tore his arm slightly, but he managed to grab him by the wrist, pulling the limb towards him, up, and twist in a brutally flawless tug, neatly dislocating it at the elbow and shoulder simultaneously.
of blood. He forced himself to snap out of it, reaching his hand and grasping Dean's arm to help steady him as he got out of the car.
"I know you and Sam have a firm grasp of medical care to avoid hospitals, but isn't recovering from surgery… more than you would normally handle without a medical environment?"
"For trusting me… for giving me my grace back."
"You didn't say anything."
"Yeah, that's usually how I get us into trouble to begin with."
Sam snapped the cuffs on. He moved to the door, pulling out his gun, loaded with devil's trap bullets. He made eye contact with Cas and when he got a nod reached up with a knife, scratching through the warding above the entrance.
"You want to leave."
"It's the closest to human I've ever been." Cas agreed, deciding finally that he liked the flavor of the beverage.
Dean propped Cas up slightly, bringing a glass of water to his lips. "Drink… your grace is very weak right now…"
When it was done, the hunter stepped back and admired their work. "Not bad." He said, a smile making its way onto his face. "Get over here, let's try this baby out."
"Wait, what the hell do I tell him?"
Cas looked Sam directly in the eyes, trying to keep Sam focused and grounded. "How can I help?"
Cas lifted his hand to shield his face from some of the water, the water washing down over his features. He used his other hand to push the flattened hair off his brow, but the movement from both his arms threw him off balance.
"No, these pieces are mine. Get your own!" Sam responds.
Suptober2021
Dean can feel that his arm is broken. He doesn't need to look at the odd angle his wrist is bent, the small spot of white sticking up through a smattering of red dripping out of the wound and onto the factory floor.
Suptober2021
"Do you believe me?" Cas asks quietly, the glow of his eyes and skin subsiding as his face turns to vulnerability.
He knows this one intimately. It smells of fresh laundry, leather, and musk. He savors these too, never getting enough.
It is one of the few times that Dean is completely uninhibited. His eyes glow bright in the dark both from the reflection of the screen and his inner child shining through. His face reflects the moving images in front of them, turning different shades of yellows, reds, and blues. A softness to his features radiates out when the cool color spectrum bounces then embeds into the skin.
The snap of the bones breaking as Dean was thrust hard into the wall made his head spin and stomach seize up. Dean tries to stand, only to retch the contents of his stomach onto the floor and fall back onto his knees. He must have hit the wall harder than he thought to have his body respond this way after years of abuse from the job.
“That’s my boy,” Cas says affectionately, putting his hand on Jack’s neck. “Thank you for giving me one last chance at life. I hope to make you proud.”
Cas pulls away, still keeping his hands on Dean. The smell of apples and spice mingle with the smell of Dean.
Day Five: Nostalgia
Tonight’s selection is a weird but somehow perfect choice in Cas’ opinion. It is a crossover between the show Bones and Sleepy Hollow. Cas and Dean have been going through the whole series of both. At first, Dean said it was to help Cas with investigating cases but as Cas watched he saw so much more under the surface.
“And now,” he pauses again, still not looking in the direction of the person he’s talking to. “Now, you are going to experience that. Your lifespan has been cut short.”
"Gross!" Claire yells. "I don't want to hear about your old man sex life!"
The two main characters in Bones are partners - both professionally and romantically - who are first at odds. Their conflicting personalities lead to much of the drama with Booth being the more traditional manly-presenting, gung-ho FBI agent and Bones being the analytical-minded scientist, who relies more on her smarts than her emotions. They bicker constantly but through the years together realize that the bickering is done out of affection that blossomed like a slow sprouting seed of love between them.
"It is about drinking hot chocolate and sitting next to your significant other while watching a scary movie. Snuggling closer as the film plays, seeking comfort as your adrenaline pulses.
"They sure do buddy," Dean cuts in, winking. "And this year we are going to hand out candy and I got the perfect costume for you afterward."
Day Four: Secrets
“The bastard deserved it!” Rowena holds her drink out in front of her. “Let’s toast to his demise.”
“You once told me that while humans burn bright, it’s only for a brief amount of time,” Jack says, his words coming out with hesitancy, like the slower he says them the less they’ll hurt.
"Did you mean it?" Cas asks plainly.
And before Sam can respond, Dean finds himself standing in his bedroom with Cas wrapped around him. His stomach seizes a moment from the flight but the warmth in his chest slowly overtakes any pain and the warmth starts to spread through his whole body and into a grin. Cas’ skin starts to slightly glow and he smiles back at Dean, not letting go of him.
Sam looks at Cas, pointedly ignoring Dean. "Your wings and true self really are spectacular, Cas. I've never seen a rainbow as beautiful. Can you show Eileen when she's over tomorrow?I know she'll love it."
He’s bent over, rearranging some of the food, and trying to find a place for his food. The fridge is so full, it’s near the one day a month where someone - usually Sam - cleans out old food or other things that try to make their home there. Ash likes to keep his experiments in the cool air, taking up the whole bottom shelving, and no matter how many times someone tells him it's unsanitary, it doesn’t change his behavior.
“Nostalgia?” Jack asks.
"What's this?" He asks, seeing the second mug.
Cas reaches over and grabs a second pizza box and hands it to Dean, who immediately proceeds to shove an entire piece in his mouth and smirks at Sam, the food bulging his cheeks out and, having nowhere else to go, poking out of his mouth.
Sam pulls back and clears his throat.
“Hell yeah!” Eileen responds, holding her glass up in solitude. She looks at Charlie expectantly and Charlie obliges, nodding her head quickly to the doorway.
"Yeah, and I told you to quit bragging," Dean teases, his face becoming a decade younger for a few moments as his smile spreads across his face and into his eyes.
“When people say they love Halloween most of the time what they are saying is that they love that time of year, of autumn, of the temperature dropping and the coziness factor increasing.
"I heard you talking about if you could see Cas' wings, so I made it so you can without receiving any damage. Same thing with you, Dean."
Cas leans over and grabs Dean’s hand which had dropped from Cas’ hair back to his lap. A blush surfaces under Dean's skin, highlighting his freckles, and Cas just wants to slowly kiss every single one. Cas leans over and puts his head on Dean’s shoulder, he feels Dean tilt his in return to rest his cheek against Cas.
"Please, Cas," Sam says, sporting his puppy dog eyes he perfected over the years.
Cas looks at him like he's the entire world and Dean soaks up all of the attention. The sun makes Cas bright but just Cas looking at Dean makes his soul and face glow. Cas leans over and kisses Dean softly then heads straight for the coffee.
“Do you think he bought it?” Charlie asks once she thinks Sam's out of range.
Slightly NSFW
“And let me guess,” Rowena responds so quietly, the danger undercutting it hangs thick in the air. “You were sent in here because you guys thought if you just grinned and showed us those big hazel eyes we would forgive you for interrupting our night?
"Did you mean it?" Cas repeats.
“You once told me that while humans burn bright, it’s only for a brief amount of time,” Jack says, his words coming out with hesitancy, like the slower he says them the less they’ll hurt.
A cooling sensation reaches through Dean’s body, pulling his brain back from the fog. Head still heavy, Dean opens his eyes slowly, blinking repeatedly as a bright light in front of him overwhelms his senses. He sees his arm outstretched and his hand has disappeared into the light. Well this must be it he thinks and he starts to lean forward into it, only to find his hand is on something solid.
"Dean, I don't know which one would be better, why don't you choose for me?" Cas says diplomatically.
A sense of dread fills Dean. He realizes that he isn't in heaven, that the all-too-familiar warming sensation was Cas' grace healing him. Which means … which means … did he just tell Cas and Sam his feelings?
“No, Jack, I am grateful. I am more grateful than I can express.”
Charlie turns to the two women. “What do we think about girls, should we forgive him?”
They only break apart when Sam's cry of "finally" comes barreling through their ears from the doorway.
Day Thirteen: Ladies Night
Day Eleven: Pizza Delivery
Confusion racks his brain and out of the corner of his eye he sees Sam’s face, which is both crying and smiling.
The realization washed over Cas. "Dean,
"I'm not letting you go."
"Then we can use it on Crowley right after. I know.
"Yeah. I'm gonna drag Cas up to Duff's in Amherst when we're done." Cas looked up at the mention of his name. "Then we'll head back down, probably crash for the night somewhere in Pennsylvania again."
"Get used to it, sunshine. Because until we find a more permanent solution, you're getting force fed a top up whenever it runs low."
Dean watched the angel's face as he looked back up at the sky. It was hard to see in the dark, but he looked perfectly calm, the same as he always did.
"I'm going to tell you once, you bring him back, you bring him back now, and you bring him back in one piece, do you hear me?"
In fact, Cas seemed to be doing a
"Still hurts like a bitch but…" Dean tested a slightly deeper breath. "I can take a bit of a deeper breath now."
. He readjusted his grip, pushing Cas over to his other shoulder. He let his body relax slightly. The water pouring over himself and the angel was slowly making his body feel numb. He suddenly felt exhausted.
He had been forced to call on Gadreel for help even getting access to this place. The federal response to this disaster had been far too tight to get in with his normal aliases. The angel had begged a favor with a reaper. Tessa now stood a few yards away, looking back the way they had come from, casually observing the still rising smoke.
. He readjusted his grip, pushing Cas over to his other shoulder. He let his body relax slightly. The water pouring over himself and the angel was slowly making his body feel numb. He suddenly felt exhausted.
… no. Right now he couldn't afford to feel. He would let himself feel later when he could do so safely without losing control. At least, this was the lie he told himself. "Yeah, I know." Internally he winced at the words. How detached they seemed.
Cas was reluctant to start, not sure he was ready to approach the problem of the knife.
"Just fan-freaking-tastic." Dean muttered, sinking down into the one leather chair.
When she finished he gave her his card and a promise they'd look into it. He and Cas headed back out towards the black muscle car, Dean shedding his coat as they went.
"I'm sorry I screwed up." The words passed his mouth before his sluggish brain caught up. He clenched his fists, thinking over the events again. "I went in as backup, and I got caught. Instead of getting you out, I just got you into this fucking mess."
"He claimed he would take me to heaven. That I could help him lead the angels he chose to bring back with him."
The hunter looked up in surprise, the conviction in the angel's voice silencing him.
"Now you understand why Dean drinks himself to sleep at night." Sam offered gently.
“Movie?” Dean said at last, trying to give one last attempt to hold onto some sort of normalcy.
The hunter didn't break stride, injecting him before he threw the needle and walked out.
Dean popped the other cup into his mouth before looking up and catching the angel's expression. "What?" He asked, mouth still full.
He took a moment, trying to work out the angle he needed, carefully considering the distance between him and the grille, and how wide the inner ledge was. Finally he tossed the log, leaning back and pumping his fist when it landed in the middle of the flames, feeling an irrational pride in this small victory.
He struggled now, trying to twist away from the hands that would cause him more pain, but instead a palm rested on the side of his face, and he was surprised by just how gentle and tender the touch was. He felt the familiar pull of healing surge through his skull, and he felt the flesh knit back together around his eye. Finally he could open them and he looked up to come face to face with Castiel. "Cas?" His voice was still hoarse, and he coughed when he tried to clear his throat.
The demon let the silence stretch on for an uncomfortable few minutes before finally addressing Charlie again. "You read all the books on how demons are created, right? When you built this warding?"
"So what does that mean?" Sam pressed.
"When were you even going to tell me?
Silence again.
Dean huffed, exasperated. "Was it the outer bone, or inner, or both?"
Dean snorted. "What parts
Dean raised an eyebrow, watching Cas from afar, his expression unreadable.
Dean raised his hand, knocking Cas' reassuring hand off. "No." He leaned forward, hands covering his chin as he leaned his weight forward onto them. "We go in smart. Or
More than half the library was in ruin before he finally ripped open a novel and the small metal capped glass fell out from the pages. He knelt, grabbing it in his hands, inspecting it. He looked around him at the literary carnage and allowed himself to feel just a little spark of relief.
"What?"
"I would rather we do something a little more
"Dean… you're-"
Dean knelt in front of Liam, softening his voice. "Hey bud. We're all going to get out of here now. You're going to be with me the whole time, okay?"
Dean glared at him. "Turns out Abaddon really has it in for you, and isn't much for asking."
The hunter stopped in front of the salted door, briefly listening through the thin wood and catching the steady sound of the angel's breathing.
"Hmm." Dean said, not having considered that. "Weird." He threw the ingredients into the pot. He put his hand down directly on the stove top, testing its heat, his hand immediately healing from the burning contact. Satisfied, he moved the sauce over to begin cooking. He turned and leaned against the counter, his arms crossed over his chest. He looked thoughtful. "How does… did flying work differently than demons teleporting?"
"Look who decided to join the world of the living again."
Sam rolled his eyes. "You know what I want."
The hunter whipped about to face Cas directly, throwing a punch in self defense as he struggled to make sense of his surroundings. The angel caught his fist, holding Dean's hand in his, trying to ease the hunter's fears. "Dean… Dean it's me… calm down."
"I tried to go for a run to clear my head."
The hunter rubbed a hand over his eyes, straightening up from his slouched position. “Where are we?” He yawned.
Cas simply gave a single nod. The angel took a moment to place the other snacks on the back seat, laying the water bottle down between them. He let the silence stretch on for a few moments while Dean reluctantly finished eating. He tried to take in Dean's demeanor. He was definitely drunk, but Cas hadn't expected anything else. His body language was tense, somewhat hostile even. And it seemed that his presence had only made it worse.
"We'll try our best." Cas finally said.
"Similar." Cas concluded. He flexed his fingers sticking through the brace the doctors placed on him.
Dean nodded his head, quietly suggesting Cas come to sit on the other side of Liam, to help give him some sense of security. The angel walked slowly to the right side of the kid, sliding down to sit a little bit away as Dean was.
"Cas, sit down…" Sam's voice shook and he reached out to try to help the angel to a chair, but Cas pushed his hands away.
"Dean, let me
Cas gave a weak smile in return. "I have noticed that, yes."
"We're almost there."
The angels threw Cas forward, and he stumbled, Dean moving forward to catch the angel in his arms before he could face plant onto the pavement. A flutter of wings accented the sound of the car pulling away, and the four were left alone in the motel parking lot.
Cas stepped in. "Hello Sam." He debated with himself for a moment before he decided to take a seat at the table beside the mountain of texts.
"Can he do that?" Dean looked up at Cas. "Is that even possible?"
"No… I think his head hit the window. I woke up, he was still… he didn't wake up at any point." Castiel found it hard to organize his thoughts to put them to words. He was usually so concise, but the pounding in his head made it hard to focus.
Dean didn't look any more confident than he felt, but after a moment, he too settled back in place, his head against the angel's shoulder. They didn't speak any more, instead laying in an increasingly comfortable silence until they both found rest again.
"Sam, listen to me. Dean is alive but… the mark… he's…"
"Thanks Dean." Cas repeated. He began to leave again.
"Hey." Dean called back, clanging down the metal staircase. He slid the light jacket off, tossing it over one of the chairs. He nodded at Cas who started towards the bedroom, with intent to check in on the cat.
"Shut it. You find out where they land, you'll have a place to start."
didn't trust Cas to know what injuries were worth mentioning. "Your ribs okay?"
"I did not."
Cas paled. He remembered Dean coming back that night. Soaked with blood, reeking of iron and smoke. "Destroyed?"
The angel closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. He moved over to the small table, opting to sit with his mug and stay out of Dean's way.
"Don't mention it." he offered, uncomfortable with the lie. "Seriously. I'm just glad you're alive and with us. You scared the hell out of me man."
"I don't know what will happen if I give you this." Dean said at last.
Castiel woke slowly, refusing to open his eyes just yet. He instead chose to orient himself to the sounds around him. Over the past day and a half he had familiarized himself with the beeps and hisses of the machinery in his room. This time was slightly different. His steady heart rate was usually closely echoed by Dean's, but now the hunter's heart was racing. The former angel listened harder and could pick up the ragged breaths and small shifts of movement next to him.
Dean looked back, seeing Sam already down and walking through the door of the bunker. He sprung into action, quickening his pace to try and catch up. He ducked through the door, starting down the stairs after him. "Sam wait-"
Cas listened for the moment Dean's breathing evened out. Usually these days he simply waited beside the hunter, ready to step in and fight back the nightmares in his mind when he sprang awake. Tonight however, Dean would be waking up in the room alone. Cas pulled the letter from his pocket, slipping it out and leaving it folded on the side of the bed, knowing Dean would look over to where he normally was. It was intentionally vague, but it assured Dean he was coming back.
Dean furrowed his brows, snapping his head up. He was surprised to hear Liam's voice and was more than a little thrown by the question. "Am I his
Cas studied the demon. The conversation brought back memories of him in that motel room again, while his grace was on its last thread, and Dean helped him to recover. It was sort of vulnerable and almost… human. "What was hunting with your dad like?"
This motel stop was different than most however. Dean usually found himself heading to the nearest bar, intent on drinking and fraternizing until he could come home and pass out. Sam would stay in, do some research, and by the time Dean stumbled in, he would have gone to sleep himself.
Kevin brought breakfast with him when he arrived in the morning. Sam was surprised to find Dean actually eat a small amount, not expecting him to accept any food at all. He chose to believe that was a good sign. Maybe Cas' quick escape with him
Dean looked back towards the smoke rising on the horizon, a beacon of the carnage he had wrought here. He looked somewhat disappointed the angel wasn't a figment of his imagination. "You shouldn't have come."
"You've been following me." he growled.
"I can't tell you what I don't know." He pleaded.
That feeling intensified for a moment.
He was bracing for any moment, when he knew Cas would come into the garage, ready to talk. But hour after hour passed and he didn't show.
"Good." Dean said, trying once more to project confidence. He grinned, clapping Cas on the shoulder before picking up his bag and cooler and leading the way up the steps towards the waiting impala.
"I'm not letting you go."
Inside, Castiel shrugged off his coat, hanging it over the chair. He slipped out of his normal clothing and into the soft shirt and pants Dean had given him. The thought of Dean settled like a weight in his chest, and he sighed, laying on the bed and curling up on his side.
"No reason. Can you give me a description of the both of them?"
Castiel followed him, taking his place at his side once more. He was surprised at the arm that slid behind him, pulling him just a little closer to the hunter. They sat in silence until the light finally sank behind the horizon.
The older Winchester rubbed a hand over his eyes, letting out a sigh. "As if we didn't have enough on our plate."
"Kevin isn't up to a road trip that long, and I don't think we should leave him alone yet."
"Not up for negotiation." Dean tossed one crutch aside, leaving only the one on his injured side. He grabbed an angel blade and held it in his other hand, ready to do whatever was necessary, damn the consequences to his leg. They could visit a hospital again. Cas wasn't going in there alone.
The hunter merely grunted, knocking back his whiskey.
After the kids leave, finding their way to another house, Dean and Cas sit on the porch a bit. The pumpkins they carved earlier are lit up on each side. Cas' has a lopsided grin that matches the small smirk he gives Dean when he's at his happiest.
A dense fog has taken over Dean's mind. He knows he is bleeding out and his brain must be short circuiting. He thinks about Sam, about leaving his brother. He knows that Sam will be fine without him. He is strong, stronger than Dean. Sam’s face flicks in and out of focus in front of Dean’s mind's eye.
He tells Claire and Dean that as they make their way back to the kitchen table, just-delivered pizza in hand. After a rather startled look, Claire takes a deep breath, leans her head in to make sure Cas is looking, and lets him have it.
“ I feel blessed to have so many dads looking out for me, and most of all you,” Jack replies.
“When people say they love Halloween most of the time what they are saying is that they love that time of year, of autumn, of the temperature dropping and the coziness factor increasing.
Dean flicks him off without looking at him, too busy not wanting to stop staring at his angel.
Dean goes between the long, skinny one and the fat one, picks and cuts the stems of both, and hands one to Cas, still grinning ear to ear.
“I’m just saying quiet doesn’t mean weird.” Sam’s face scrunches in annoyance.
"I am not old!"
As Cas spoke, Dean's body found itself on its knees, matching the kneeling position and his face mirroring the wide grin of Cas in front of him. Dean's hands are on Cas's cheeks.
But each word hits its mark, sharply embedding into the flesh.
The broken pieces continue to bleed out, staining the floor, the bones crumbling.
With a flourish, Dean pulls out both cowboy hats from behind his back and puts them on them. He smiles at Cas' frown.
"Score! Thank you, Dean!"
It smells wonderful.
The aroma of apples and spices hangs heavy in the kitchen. Warmth from the oven preheating fills the kitchen making the air hang heavier, completely filling Cas’ senses and seeping into the walls and surrounding rooms.
Jack nods his head and repeats from memory, “The point is that they were here at all and you got to know them. When they’re gone, it will hurt, but that hurt will remind you of how much you loved them.”
"Sam," Cas says, taking baby's keys out of Dean's pocket and tossing them to him. "We'll meet you back at the bunker."
“Thank you ...” the man says, pausing.
"Keep on telling yourself that.”
Oh no, Dean thinks. I’m in trouble.
He grabs the lapels of Cas’ trenchcoat, pulling Cas even closer, swearing that he'll never let him go as he decides the only thing he wants to do now and forever is to kiss Cas.
He was thrown into a wooden pallet leaning on the wall and the broken pieces found purchase in his body. The pain comes in quick waves now and as Dean falls, his legs no longer able to support him, his mind no longer able to keep him conscious, the only thing that he remembers is calling out - or maybe it was praying - for Cas.
The man smiles and moves forward to shake Dean’s hand. He leaves the fridge door open and the light shines around his body like a beacon of ethereal hope. His face is cast in darkness as he walks but when he reaches Dean, Dean notices the overalls are stretched tight over his chest. He has messy almost black hair, an arrowhead nose, and the brightest blue eyes Dean has even seen.
"I'm fine." The older hunter flicked off the heat on the stove. He threw a few pieces of bacon on each of the plates.
He hesitated before pushing open his door, looking down the hallway and noticing the light coming from beneath Cas' door. He frowned, heading over and knocking gently, getting an invitation before entering.
Cas sighed. "A devil's trap isn't going to hold you long on its own." He shook his head. "Even the cuffs would fail eventually."
Dean relaxed for now, letting himself just enjoy good food and decent company.
Dean's eyes snapped back to face the angel. "It was me." His expression darkened, eyes still black. "They were innocent… screaming for mercy, and I-" His voice cut off and he looked back down at the blade in his hands.
Sam nodded "Tell him he killed Kevin but-"
"Where are we?"
"The hole is different from any part of hell for more than just that reason. It is designed for the express purpose of corrupting souls into demons. Alastair led an elite trained unit to torture nonstop with personal attention given to every soul. You know this. No rest. No isolation. Only pain and torment until they break. And then the real work begins. It takes centuries for a soul to blacken and become demonic. The hole is designed for high priority cases. Humans whose souls have been determined to be exceptional in one way or another. Those they wish to turn into demons without the time they'd spend waiting for it to happen else-wise."
thought of that.
Sam took a deep measured breath. "Yeah. I know. On some level, I know It's just-"
"He can kill
Sam hesitated. "Where?"
"Thought you assclowns basically never came to earth before fishing me out of hell."
"I'm fine." the hunter dismissed.
"You're not supposed to be here." He muttered.
"Rudy called, he's got a couple werewolves, and no one's nearby. Asked if I could back him up."
You could hear the smile and small laugh through the phone. "Yeah, that's not how this works. You have something of mine, and I have something of yours. Been watching that motel. Took you three hours to get here from whatever dumpster you two call home? You have seven to get the tablet and get back. Elsewise your lover bites it. No comebacks this time. And no bluffing, I'll know if you have it."
"What did you do to me?"
With this in mind, without saying anything, Dean began looking for a motel to call it a night. Finding one, he pulled in, cutting the engine, and froze when he saw Cas' face. "We can continue on." He had picked up on the fact it was unusual for Dean to call it quits less than 12 or 13 hours into a trip.
Dean held it up for a second before sliding the straps to the correct length, cinching it up from where it was loosened when Cas tossed it aside yesterday. He helped guide it over Cas' head, holding it steady as Cas slipped his arm back in.
Cas felt a familiar shudder down his spine. In days past Dean repeatedly fell back on his full name, something before he had only done in formal prayer. This was a clear choice, a coldness that the demon was pulling out either to distance them or just because he knew it got under his skin. "Hello Dean." He replied simply.
If Dean didn't know better, he would have sworn that Cas was near tears. "Cas, I'm-" He was cut off, Cas grabbing him by the shoulder and pulling him forward, almost crushing him against his chest in a desperate hug. Dean hesitated for a moment, before reaching his arms up and around the angel and returning the embrace with a similar urgency.
Dean swung Cas around, backing him into the wall, knocking an unloaded shotgun clattering to the ground. His free hand combed through Cas' hair, fastening into a grip on the angel's head, pulling him closer. He bridged the gap between them, pulling their bodies flush with one another.
"Just a sense I didn't know how to read then."
These feelings weren't foreign. They were incredibly similar to something Dean kept carefully locked away.
“I’m fine.” He closed his eyes for a second, stopping himself from just brushing it off. “I mean I’m coping.” He forced out, trying to ignore the instinct to bottle up his emotions and move on. He sighed. “Thanks for this. For everything you’re doing.”
"Like actually asleep?" Sam asked, surprised.
was. He supposed it had been a few months ago. Probably a few years ago, but they really took a step in recent history. They hadn't attempted to put words to it. Honestly they didn't talk about it much at all. It just sort of evolved naturally.
"I don't know yet."
was scared."
With one last look around the still-destroyed room, Castiel followed.
Dean rolled his eyes. "What would you like to eat, your royal highness?"
"I was worried about you."
Dean was just scanning over the room again when he saw the device lodged and sticking out from between the couch cushions.
Sam sighed. "Yeah. We have some practice, and the large pile of shit we stole from the hospital and ambulance. Fingers crossed."
"How generous." Sam rolled his eyes, pulling the stool over from near the tool box, taking a seat. He took a deep breath and suddenly found himself struggling for words. He had mulled over what he would say for days, but somehow being here in the moment made all of the ways he thought he might start the conversation feel… wrong.
Cas pulled himself to one knee, panting for a moment. Slowly, he lifted his gaze, taking in his surroundings with new understanding. This time he could see the glyphs around the room, the enochian warding that his senses had been too weak to see earlier. They were keeping his powers slightly muted, contained, as well as effectively trapping him.
Dean pulled a face. "So you keep saying."
"It feels like I did in hell." Dean finished at last.
"I don't want a fight, I want my freedom."
Dean heard the sound of glass breaking. "Sam, what's happening?"
Dean put down the first set before the torch faded, and in the dying light he struggled to continue. He stumbled, falling against the outside of the shelter, the blood loss starting to catch up. Cas took his shoulder and roughly thrust him through the door as well before turning and finishing carving the protective runes into their surroundings.
"Cas… Cas buddy, we'll figure it out. Just right now I need you to breathe." Sam's pleading was getting further away, mixing with another voice that he couldn't quite place.
Sam winced. "He's been-?"
"No." Sam replied anyway. "But it's the only play we've got. Are you in or not?"
Dean let the words wash over him. "Is that why you cannot fly?"
"You can." Cas said firmly. "You have to come back with me."
It had the desired effect, the hunter smiling from beneath the fogged plastic oxygen mask.
He glossed over it, but Sam's head was turning, trying to figure out what was on his mind. Dean had seen a lot of torture in his lifetime, so he didn't think that'd be affecting him that much.
"It's a lot."
"Shut up about it. Just… put a couple logs on. Please."
"Why would he do that?"
"Gadreel can't go in alone, Dean." Sam said firmly. "And it can't wait. None of this can."
Once in the kitchen, Dean let the facade fall away a little as he always did when he was alone. His shoulders slumped, and he took a moment to brace himself against the counter. He didn't want to admit just how much Cas had scared him. He knew he was overreacting a little. Not that a serious infection
Dean dropped his bag on the bed closest the door, watching Cas sit gingerly on the opposite bed. He mulled over Cas' words and acknowledged the truth in them, even if he would still continue with his jaded thoughts on motels in general. His entire childhood was one motel after another, and it seemed so normal until they found the bunker. Now he had a home beyond the impala, and motels just felt like a disappointing reminder of the past.
resist." He paused. "Dean snapped last night."
Sam sighed. "Still, I don't have a great feeling about this." He looked at the closed door, thinking of his brother across the cabin. "How is he?"
Dean's breath hitched, the feeling of having his mind read always one that felt like a violation. But he trusted Castiel enough to allow it against his every instinct. He swallowed, feeling more vulnerable than he had ever been in his life, and his raw reaction was to shut himself off, maybe even run. But he forced himself to remain planted to the spot.
Cas considered Adam, somewhat regretful he hadn't been able to save him in the failed battle to the cage for Sam.
. Things were far from normal and he wasn't sure how long he could keep his calm facade. Normally he'd take a few days while it was quiet, go off in his car, drink, get his bearings, but right now he couldn't risk the time away.
"Sure." Dean tightened his fist on the crutches holding him up. "Angels made Sam at Syracuse Hancock International less than 20 minutes ago. He blasted them away, got brought with. I have no idea where they landed, but I need him back,
Sam looked back at the ceiling, trying to regain
"Yeah yeah. You'll kill me. Love you too." He looked up watching the younger Winchester and Cas come out, arms full of stuff. He furrowed his brow, looking at the carrier in the angel's hands. "Is that… what the hell is that?"
Cas pressed his palm to the side of Dean's head and reached inward to read the hunter's mind. Instead of any coherent thoughts or words, the seraph was instead hit with an indecipherable tsunami of emotion. It stunned him for a moment, making his head spin and he hastily pulled his hand away, gathering himself. Finally he reached up two fingers and neatly knocked the hunter out.
Sam glowers at Dean, who just smirks and goes back to his burger. Jack pours himself a bowl and sits down next to Sam.
"It is about the skyline changing from greens and blues to yellows, oranges, and reds. Being surrounded by colors both above, in front, and below them. Walking along the woods, wearing a warm scarf and boots, seeking out and stepping on that perfect crunchy leaf. A strong wind knocking down a flurry of colors to descend upon them and the land. Racking up those fallen comrades and jumping into them with the carefree attitude of a child.
Cas remains withdrawn but he raises his tear-filled eyes to meet Dean’s. The glistening droplets of water fight to stay in Cas’ eyes and Dean can hear Cas’ throat is coated and thick with emotion as he says, “he betrayed us. I had to burn his … I had to burn Jack’s body.”
“I have them on,” Dean says before Cas can dip his hands down further.
“You always make me proud,” Jack replies and hugs his father again.
Day Seven: Young at Heart
It smells like home.
Cas usually relinquishes his hold and goes back to sleep, allowing Dean to get his day started. This morning is the same routine, but Dean stays an extra minute, running his hands across Cas' brow, smoothing out the lines, and then slipping out to the store to pick up provisions.
"Oh, I thought they were black," Sam says quietly, pausing. "I did see the burnt ashes in the sand when … you know ..  Lucifer killed you," he cringes and avoids looking at Dean.
They walk out of the house together, Cas instantly perking up when the sun hits his skin, as if the heat of the rays turns on a life force that makes Cas forget how much he hates mornings. Dean usually stands on the porch, second coffee cup in hand, marveling at the change from grumpy to relaxed. He watches as Cas's whole body releases all tension, taking its time, his body turning like a sunflower chasing the sun. Cas wades out to the grass, takes off his shoes, and wiggles his toes in the dewy greenery. Dean waits for Cas to turn around with that soft smile, messy hair, and bright blue eyes.
Dean spends his time explaining what Halloween is like in America. The propaganda of the candy companies, the slutty costumes, the horror movies, the corn mazes. He stores in his memory to take Cas to a corn maze next year.
Dean can feel that his arm is broken. He doesn't need to look at the odd angle his wrist is bent, the small spot of white sticking up through a smattering of red dripping out of the wound and onto the factory floor.
The four humans and one angel around the table smile at each other and stand to clink their glasses.
The smell of iron invades Dean's nostrils, making his stomach flip again. This time he's victorious when he tries to stand, his feet planted on the ground but his back still against the wall, head spinning.
The snap of the bones breaking as Dean was thrust hard into the wall made his head spin and stomach seize up. Dean tries to stand, only to retch the contents of his stomach onto the floor and fall back onto his knees. He must have hit the wall harder than he thought to have his body respond this way after years of abuse from the job.
The new guy turns to face Dean, still framed in the doorway. He looks at Dean - wait, make that, takes Dean in - his eyes moving all the way up Dean’s body till they meet his now wide eyes.
Suptober2021
After breakfast and Cas' first apple cider, which he told Dean was 'delicious, tasting of fruit, spice, and just a smidge sour," Dean takes Cas to the pumpkins he's been taking care of on his side of the garden.
The lights in the bunker dim as Cas' wings unfurl out. Near Cas' body they have a black tint but that tint changes to purple, blue, green, all the colors of the rainbow. Each feather reflects and refracts the light out as Cas moves his wings slowly.
Rowena nods. "I don't think he realized we knew he was coming. But now we can get to the real work. And that silly string was a nice touch Eileen."
They go inside and Dean spends the rest of the morning teaching Cas how to carve. He takes every opportunity to help guide Cas' hand and while Cas is carving he stands behind him, his hands around his waist, chin propped upon Cas' shoulder, making sure Cas doesn't accidentally cut himself.
Day Six: Cemetery Boys
Dean's smile widens at the grumpiness but he doesn't move.
“Of me?” Dean asks, breathless, staring Cas down, hoping that the pink in his cheeks isn’t noticeable.
"Dean," Sam cries out and lunges forward to hug his brother. Dean's arms instinctively rise up to wrap around his brother.
Sam just shrugs in response, not looking anyone directly in the eye.
Benny scoffs slightly in response. “No need to be diplomatic here, Sam. Bless your heart.”
The broken pieces are still there. The blood dries. Stains permanent. The knife is shining.
"Mean what?"
“And of course my time with you. When you showed me the future and chose me as your father. I have never been more blessed to call you my son, Jack.”
The skin on his face tingles as every nerve reacts to the light touch on his cheeks. Each synapse fires off, sending waves of serotonin through his brain. He lets out a sigh of pleasure and leans into the touch.
Dean pulls his hand back and sits up.
The words put the body back together, healing all the wounds it just created.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean very impressively states, finding his mouth dry but the curves of his  lips follow the upward trajectory of Castiel’s.
He thinks about Cas. This angel that fell for him. So many enemies referred to him as his angel. And he never really questioned it before, afraid to give into the warm feeling in his chest whenever they did. He thinks of how Cas always stares at him, how that always brought that same warm glow to Dean’s chest. And he thinks of all the unspoken words between them. Cas’ face also starts flickering before his mind’s eye. This time his face crooked and not in the cute way it does when Cas gets confused. Dean loves when a slight squint is added to the cock of the head.
"What do they look like?" Sam asks, turning his attention back to Cas after giving the stink eye to Dean.
They sit there in silence, both too stubborn to break it. Dean licks his lips in a nervous tick. He feels Cas' eyes move, following the movement. He raises his eyes once again to meet Cas' and find they are already in him.
He hoped that the real Cas, at least sometimes, did something for his own pleasure.
Sam was finding it hard to hold onto the outright fury of just a few seconds ago, but the anger remained. "I was ready to die."
Cas seemed surprised at the sudden contact, but looked up to see Dean's eyes.
"You can read his mind, right?"
"You fell asleep towards the end of the film… I know sleep is somewhat rare for you, so I did not want to interrupt. I must have fallen asleep shortly after."
"I don't know!" Dean cut him off. He turned away from the pair watching him, hands coming up to scruff through his hair as he tried to think. His voice softened, faltering slightly. "I don't know." There was a moment of calm before he snapped, reaching down and upending the motel table, violently throwing its contents and breaking the legs. He braced himself on one of the chairs, taking a few rapid breaths to try and calm himself.
Cas shifted on his crutch to make eye contact with the angel, trying to sort out who he was without being able to see the angel's true form. It was a little like talking to someone through a text message. They could be anyone.
of things he hadn't done since he was human.
Sam swallowed, feeling his chest tighten. He forced himself to push it aside.
Castiel managed to win his fight against tears for the moment, blinking a few times, and sighing, still not trusting himself to look at Dean. "I can move, give you more space." He began to shift his weight, getting ready to slip from under the covers, and scoot at least across the bed and up against the headboard. He was surprised when Dean's hand reached up and landed on his shoulder. He finally looked down, making eye contact with the hunter.
"I fell to earth with the rest of the angels… It was a fresh start." He turned to look at Dean. "When I heard your prayer, I saw an opportunity to do good."
" He whispered brokenly.
"That was the wrong thing to say." Cas observed, his tone unchanging.
Cas wasn't sure how long he screamed, but when the blinding agony receded, he was left in utter silence and darkness. His senses came back in stages, the last shreds of his newly restored grace allowing him to take in his surroundings. The angel pulled himself up, realizing that he heard nothing from the hunter he was leaned up against.
Cas straightened out to stand. "You spoke with him?"
control of his emotions at all. He took a deep breath, feeling sick at what he was watching. Even knowing the end game. Knowing Dean would be back as a demon. That they could figure out the mark and turn him back.
When Cas put his hand on Dean's arm, the demon jerked back, ducking out of his grip. He squared himself up, ready to fight the angel if need be.
"Yes Dean?" Cas waited to hear what the older hunter would ask him, but the silence stretched on. He was starting to feel like Dean had fallen back unconscious. "Dean?"
"True." Dean tensed for a moment when the angel relaxed to rest against him. "Maybe it's just harder because it feels real now." He sighed. "Or maybe because of everything else."
Finally he let himself just come back and lean back down in his spot next to Cas. He looked up to the stars, forcing himself to just take it all in.
Dean didn't break stride, running to his side, kneeling beside him. He put his hand on Cas' shoulder, relieved to see the angel still conscious.
"Cas, what if this really
Dean rolled his eyes. "So yeah, we're just peachy. Looked at Cas' x-rays. His breaks aren't too bad. Ordered a boot, he should be able to hobble around when it comes."
Cas closed his eyes, trying to recall what the boys did. They never used Winchester in these situations. Too risky. They were either dead or wanted, he couldn't keep track of which it was this time. "Singer." He finished, settling on their surrogate father's name. He rattled off a phone number he knew by heart.
Gadreel's hands rose slowly. "Metatron met me outside of the building. He sought to confirm I had completed my task, and he requested the tablet. I informed him it was not in the bunker. He looked to consider for a moment, and then simply said he was disappointed. He had an angel blade with him, and he made to kill me. Cas attempted to intercept, and Metatron missed a killing blow. Cas dragged me inside here, and used his grace to pull me back from near death."
"You did not need to say it."
"Good. Yeah, it's not...that wouldn't be good."
Dean swallowed, taking a deep breath. "Cas, grab your stuff. Crowley's outside waiting to take us back." He watched Sam turn, fists clenched for a moment before he walked over to the shelves, grabbing a couple of books he had intended to take back with him. He said nothing to Dean.
It took about an hour before Liam slowly drifted off, his breathing evening out completely in sleep.
Castiel was passively aware of the landscape shifting around them, but his mind was focused wholly on Dean. Their surroundings morphed into that of a disused ballroom. He felt himself smash backwards through a dusty piano, the sound both deafening and somehow amusing. He let himself be fully supported by the demon. Three more times they'd jump. The lobby. A drained and abandoned pool. Another disused suite.
Cas?"
"And this is just eggs." Dean said firmly, placing the paper back down on the table. Sam noticed the hint of a grin forming on his brother's face. "We're going to make a list, all the best foods. You're going to try them. And not just shitty knock offs. I don't care if I have to drive your ass all the way across the country, some food is worth it."
He let the silence stretch until he felt Cas begin to tremble against him. He himself was starting to shiver and he finally was forced to move him. "Come on. Let's get out of these wet clothes."
"Like Cain."
Cas held it in his hands, and looked it over, confused at first but then slowly coming to realize the layers to the joke. A simple knit hat, to be worn in cold weather. On it, the words "Hot Wingz" with two angelic chicken wings and a halo overhead.
"I didn't know what happened to you two… I wasn't sure…"
"Cas, this is ridiculous.
Sam cringed slightly, having hoped that maybe Dean hadn't overheard the conversation. "We're getting rid of that mark."
"Partners."
doing Dean?"
"So you're telling me you were a chick?"
you Dean." Cas insisted.
"We're going to get through the doors. It's just going to take a few more minutes, you hold on." He leaned down, listening to a muffled voice coming from the radio that Cas couldn't make out. "Rescue just pulled up. They're going to be down here to get these doors off in just a second."
Dean looked over the angel. He looked… Dean focused harder and he could see around the seams. See the barely contained angel vibrating in the empty human vessel he'd been wearing for near a decade. It was incredible, seeing this layer that his human eyes couldn't perceive. He tried to get a better look, to push his sight further, but the light built swiftly into an unbearable crescendo. His demonic eyes reflected the pure blinding angelic glow and he cried out. He staggered backwards, knocking into the nightstand, hands coming up to block his eyes from direct sight.
"Ooh. Cooler full of blood. Perfect." Dean spat, rolling his eyes.
"Hey."
Dean considered this for a moment. "No. But I wouldn't have let you stay either."
Dean just stared at him, but after a moment, his hard expression softened. He bit back a small smile at Cas' dismissal. "Fine, but if we're going to be on the road we'll need to stop for snacks."
It took awhile for Dean to more or less fully wake up. Reluctantly, he pulled himself up, deciding to at least attempt to change clothes before facing today. He slipped the nasal cannula off, pulling out his phone to check in with Sam while he went to battle with his clothes.
When Sam gave him a text he was ten minutes out, Cas got back to his feet. He dipped into the bedroom for a second, coming back with one of the cans of spray paint, which he used to repair the devil's trap in the corner, flush with the wall. He turned back to face the hunter. "Dean." He said simply, tilting his head towards the sigil on the floor.
"Sam…" Dean trailed off. "You spoke to him?" He sighed, seeing Cas nod. "He has to be beside himself."
Sam gave a short sarcastic laugh. "I'm doing just fantastic."
Cas looked back for another moment, watching Dean writhe against his restraints in pain before turning and following after Sam.
Dean shifted, pulling back enough to cup his hand around the angel's chin and pull him up to meet his lips. Castiel's eyes widened for a moment, but against his better judgement he let them flutter shut and gave in.
Cas furrowed his brow, trying to organize his words. "Sam-"
"Where you, what, passed out for hours?"
“Well, let’s get back to work, ladies. Tell us Rowena about this new spell you’re working on. We’ve got a lot to learn tonight.”
