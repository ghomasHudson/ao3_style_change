“Exactly. And to make that possible, we had to turn to magic, since science and biology aren’t on our side. Thor brought his mother here, and she allowed us the use of their magic. She gave us her word that Loki’s powers are being watched closely, with strict conditions.”
"Doesn't mean either of us has to like it." Tony steps away to pull the other stool closer. Once he's sitting, he stares at Steve's profile, his heart clenching painfully in his chest. "I hate that this is hurting you."
Natasha drives them to the motel the pair are staying in. while she focuses on the road and Sam transfers Redwing’s files into a laptop, Steve brings up JARVIS’s terminal.
“But I think it’s time Blue went to someone else, a little boy who can love him and cuddle with him and give him a really great home. Think you can do that, Peter?”
Tony isn’t in the tower when Steve arrives fresh from the hospital with only the change of clothes Sam brought him upon his discharge. Miss Potts is, though, and she greets him warmly in the atrium after a few minutes of Steve trying to make himself smaller in an attempt to avoid the inquisitive glances of everyone milling about. Thankfully, she doesn’t require an explanation, merely guides Steve toward an elevator that appears in the wall panelling as if by magic. She introduces him to JARVIS and, though he’s heard about the AI from Natasha and Clint, nothing could have prepared him for the melodic voice that seems to come from the walls themselves or how the program knows so much about him.
The sharp scent of motor oil and electrical wires filters through the awful haze in his head, and Tony gulps down air and avoids thinking about the roiling, churning of his stomach. He drops down to sit on the couch in the corner, stares blankly at the floor. After a moment of struggling to get his bearings, he fumbles for his phone, the screen lighting up under his thumb and scanning, unlocking with a quiet click.
Steve keeps himself still as Tony nears, his shoes scraping against stone. The sketchbook Steve brought lies neglected in his lap. He'd chosen this place because of his Ma, a hidden little garden they'd found on their last trip out of the city before she'd gotten sick. There's not much there beyond grass and groups of flowers, honey bees floating from one cluster to another, their buzzing melodic on the gentle breeze.
startles him; Tony’s hand on his lower back calms him. He settles back on the floor and focuses on relaxing his body. A cool, wet finger runs along his ass, catches slightly on the rim, and Steve jolts at the touch. He bites his lip as the digit presses inward, tries to slip past the muscle; Tony starts up a litany of
, Stark, a magnet for trouble, even when he’s locked in medical. He has zero self-preservation skills. He was shot by Coulson after he landed on SHIELD’s radar. I damn near slit his throat when, instead of killing me as ordered, he decided to try to recruit me, to get me out of the Red Room. He falls out of buildings without having any sort of backup plan. What would make him think any of that is him turning out ‘pretty okay’? What would make him think I’d find that comforting
“I want her to have a better life from the start, and that means giving her one less connection to my past and all the wrong I’ve ever done. The best way to do that is to give her the last name of a great man, a
Steve started tearing up again at the sight of his partner's confused expression. Tony wrapped Steve in his arms and rubbed his back while whispering soft nonsense. When Steve pulled away, he allowed Tony to wipe his cheeks dry.
“They really are,” chuckles Tony, unable to stop the smile from taking residence on his face. “It’s actually kinda terrifying.”
Bruce ambles in half an hour later, attention firmly on the tablet in his hands. He doesn’t look up even as Steve slides a spinach-and-egg white omelette before him, just mumbles a quick
“Of course. I’m unsure exactly of what I could do. If you will grant me a week, maybe less, I can return home and speak to my mother’s court, see what might be an acceptable method to assist you and Steve in this endeavour.”
“Clint was trying to cheer me up,” she states suddenly. “He kept saying things like –” Her voice lowers, somehow managing to sound similar to Barton’s. “‘I was raised in an abusive home then the circus, and
He collapses, boneless, on Steve’s left side, panting unsteadily as his heart races in his chest. His fingers lazily card through the ends of Steve’s long blond hair. His breathing finally steady, he pushes himself onto one elbow, brushing a kiss across Steve’s cheekbone, and drapes an arm over Steve’s waist.
Steve slides a hand over his belly, chuckling – and then wincing – when a particularly hard kick lands against his palm. “She’s doing well, very active and healthy. The doctor says I’m lucky, that this pregnancy is, by all appearances, unnaturally easy.”
Loki clasps his hands behind his back, gives Steve a small smile, and falls silent. Steve kneads at his forehead with one hand and pulls his phone from his pocket with the other.
She levels him with an unimpressed glare, though it gets ruined completely by the smile she can’t smother in time, and heads down the hallway toward the bathroom. Tony breezes through the chat with Byron, reminds the manager that Ms Potts is CEO of Stark Industries for a reason – and it isn’t because of her looks; reads through the proposals, accepting only one and rejecting the others, signing each packet with a larger signature than necessary (but it’s only because he doesn’t want Pepper to not see that he actually did as requested, that’s all; it has nothing to do with being a smartass); finishes his coffee; and makes his way to the bedroom.
He listens to his mother as she tells him about her shift at the hospital, the antics of her patients, and her plans for her day off. Steve makes a mental note to go over and visit her when he can. They talk as Steve winds his way through the grocery store, picking out some fruit and tiny cakes and a bottle of wine that ends up being more expensive than he'd expected it to be, having come from a grocery store, but he doesn't want to buy something cheap. He firmly tells himself that he's not hoping to impress Tony. Not at all.
She holds out a bright blue booster seat. Steve nods his thanks, takes it from her, and heads toward the door. Peter skips happily beside him; Steve feels a sudden awe at how tiny the kid’s hand is, and he forces himself to ignore the worry that he might accidentally break Peter’s bones. Thankfully, the trek back to the car is uneventful, though it’s long due to Peter stopping to say goodbye to each classmate he sees filing out of the side doors and the short strides he’s capable of.
“Okay, it’s now been… three and a half hours, and I’ve spent the last two of those in a meeting, or I’d have called sooner. Anyway. You’re probably asleep right now since it’s, what, midnight there? God, time zones fucking suck. I’m going to assume that’s why you haven’t called back, because any other possible explanation is just… yeah, it’s painful to even consider, so I won’t give those possibilities a chance to root themselves into my brain. Look, Pep’s yelling at me, well, not really, but she is doing that thing with her eyes that says she’d be yelling at me if she wasn’t so much of a composed badass. I, uh, I’ll call you later.”
“Absolutely. If you’re not getting hitched for dental, what even is the point?” He pauses; his fingers thread through Steve’s, squeezing tightly. “Let’s give it six months. Let the newlyweds bask in their newlyweddedness. Then we can announce it.”
? Is he crazy? He can hear JARVIS speaking to him, the cool British voice full of concern, but Tony can’t make out the words over the rush of panicked thoughts in his head.
.” Steve barely manages to stifle the shaking of his hands as he gingerly reaches in for the supplies. He can afford pricier products, SHIELD reimburses him for anything he buys for the job, but he's always stuck with what he knows. He can't deny, though, that he has had his eye on this line for a very long time; it's supposed to be the best of the best, much smoother and reliable than anything else, and the pricetag reflects that quality.
“Sorry, excuse me, not meaning to be rude by interrupting, but Steve, darling, sit your ahh-behind in a chair. Please. You’re making my legs hurt, and I’m not even standing.”
“Can’t you be serious about this?” groans Steve, which is evidently the wrong thing to say for Tony scoots to the edge of the bed and stands up. “What are you doing?’
They stop in the doorway to the kitchen. Tony's shoulders start shaking, his breath wheezing out through tightly-pressed lips, and Steve gapes at the sight of a fully-costumed Spiderman crawling across the ceiling. In the blink of an eye, Peter drops down, his web holding securely to the ceiling, and steals the last wonton and spring roll off of Natasha's plate. She moves far more slowly than Steve knows she's capable of, feigns that she is going to stab Peter’s hand with a chopstick, but she's laughing the rare, real laugh that she only lets loose when she's comfortable, feeling safe. Everyone is talking, arguing good-naturedly, eating and sharing the food, and Steve's chest burns with the warmth of so much love for this insane, reckless, wonderful family he's made. Tony squeezes his hand, and Steve smiles widely back, pulling Tony along as he joins the group at the table.
Steve’s quiet plea does nothing to alleviate the situation. In fact, Tony seems to double-down on his stance of remaining on Steve’s bed and keeping him awake. Steve knows he could easily move the other man, but he’s exhausted and feels every bit as old as he truly is. He leans forward in the chair, resting his elbows on his knees, and stares at his clasped hands.
His movements slow, Steve slides one arm beneath Peter’s legs, the other around his tiny shoulders, and carefully cradles the child against his chest as he follows the man into their apartment. Peter’s room is lit by a small night-light that’s sending an image of the solar system onto the ceiling. The walls are plastered with posters of more cartoon ponies, drawings, and a huge print of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. His bedsheets are mismatched as well: A Cat in the Hat fitted sheet, Doc McStuffins pillowcase, and a Mulan comforter, all in a pirate ship bed-frame. Steve lays Peter down on his bed and steps back to allow his father to tuck him in. He steps out of the room when the man starts whispering to his sleeping child.
Her lips tremble, and she lets Steve pull her in for a close embrace. He only holds her for a moment, then he releases her and motions toward the door. Pepper nods and sniffles; Steve makes his way to the door, stopping only to squeeze Peter's shoulder. He follows the path of dainty yellow petals spread on the floor, takes care not to crush them under his dress shoe. The seats lined up outside are filling quickly, family and friends greeting each other and smiling in the sea-salt breeze. An enormous canopy, gauzy and flowing, has already been set up at the front, and Steve quickly finds his seat. Steve had been surprised when Pepper had asked him to sit on her side of the aisle, but she laughed and told him that he should have expected it, he will always be her family now.
, he’ll be doing this anyway just, just on his own and without us for backup. I give him a month until he runs into something bigger than him, and it could very well kill him. And I can't, I can't have that on my conscience.”
? I’ve never taken care of a kid before, let alone a stranger’s. We’ve barely spoken, just a few ‘hello’s here and there, and now he’s trusting me with the wellbeing of his kid! He threatened to
“Steve, darling, there is nothing I could ever regret when it comes to being with you. Yes, I changed my mind, but you have to believe me, I wouldn’t have done it, I wouldn’t have said yes to any of this if I didn’t want to change my mind. Yes, I’d prefer if we didn’t need Loki, but babe, I…I’ve actually kinda gotten used to the idea of a mini-you. I promise I won’t regret this. How could I? I’m going to be doing this with you, the man I’m so incredibly in love with, it’s terrifying.
In the nights that follow, Steve winds up in the workshop when he can’t sleep. The time there goes about the same as that first night ー they chat idly as Tony works and Steve watches. It isn’t long before Steve sneaks a drawing pad and pencils into the workshop with him; Tony doesn’t seem to notice that Steve spends the time sketching instead of responding to Tony’s technobabble.
“Where's Sabrina?” Tony questions, looking around the room, and Steve realises with a start that he hasn't seen Wanda at all since this morning.
Peter nods without speaking; Steve carries him into the living room, lowers him gently onto the couch, makes sure Piggly is tucked up next to him.
“It’s amazing,” Tony murmurs at another flutter; he presses a kiss to the blond’s rounded tummy. “Hey there, little one. I know there’s still a bit of a wait before you make your appearance in this world, but I’m so excited to meet you. So are your aunts and uncles, and especially your daddy. Never forget that your daddy and Papa will always love you,
Tony glances at Coulson as Pepper steps away. “I’d give it a bit. There may not have been any complications, but it took a few hours for him to dilate completely. They’ve got him using the bathroom before they move him to a recovery room. Did you know that’s a thing – after giving birth, you have to have a bowel movement before you can be transferred? Because I did not know that. Anyway. Give us about an hour, and I’ll come out and get you.”
The morning comes too slowly, time dragging on with the weight of a million worlds. Steve climbs out of bed first; the sun isn’t even up fully when he steps outside and locks the door behind him, heading to the worn-down gas station attached to the motel’s parking lot. He grabs a handful of frozen burritos from the freezer, heads to the front to pay, and glances up at the tiny TV behind the partition while the clerk counts out change.
“He doesn't want to disturb Miss Sarah,” she replies softly, as if she knew what he was going to say before the words could fully form.
plays after a couple minutes of scrolling through the channels. Peter doesn't even perk up like he normally does when he sees Twilight Sparkle on the screen. Steve stays quiet, even after the child falls asleep shortly after the show starts.
“I’m sorry, but can you please watch Peter for a bit? There’s an e-m-e-r-g-e-n-c-y, and I can’t take him with me, I’ll explain later, thanks. Hurt my kid, and I’ll kill you.”
Steves bites back the curse at the doctor, ignoring the urge to just give up, and manages to find the strength to push. He can feel it the instant the baby’s feet slip free; he collapses back to the bed with a gasp. Tony smiles down at him, tears in his dark eyes.
. His body is immobile, unmoving beyond minute trembles, and every breath burns in his lungs, tears at his throat. He gasps loudly as the last icy tendrils of his nightmare fade away; a woman’s voice calls through the cheap wood of the door.
do that to you. Pepper was so amazing, so wonderful, so perfect, and she didn’t deserve it, but it happened, and I regret that I couldn’t get the balance right. She should’ve gotten the world, but instead, she got me.”
Pepper and Phil are just heading through the doors of May's by the time Tony parks the car in the lot. Phil sees them first, gestures for Pepper to wait; they stand just inside the entryway so that Tony and Steve can catch up. Once seated, Darcy bounces over with a wide grin. She makes small talk while Steve and Phil skim the menus, but Steve is distracted by the way Tony's foot nudges his ankle, wraps around and remains there. It's such a subtle thing, not really worthy of the break in Steve's concentration, but his cheeks warm at the simple contact. He forces his gaze to stay on the list of meals, even as he hears Pepper giggle softly across the table. He finally orders the first thing that sounds decent, though he can barely hear himself as he speaks.
Steve sends a quick goodnight text to Tony, crawls into bed, and goes to sleep with half-formed images of his father in his head.
Now Steve is fourteen and Tony is barely fifteen and it’s been nine years since they first met, and no one knows about their dreams. Steve doesn’t ask if Tony’s ever told his parents; they don’t talk about their lives outside of the dreams much. It keeps Tony from being so angry and jaded for being so damn young, and all Steve wants, has ever wanted, is for Tony to be happy. Or, at least, as close to happy as is possible for the younger boy.
A light tapping on the door draws Steve away from the cartoon and the (admittedly little) progress he’s made to his comic. He checks the time on his phone – 9:05 pm – before heaving himself to his feet and crossing the room. An exhausted-looking Tony stands on the other side of the door when Steve pulls it open. Peter’s father manages to smile a greeting, but it only serves to accentuate the dark circles under his eyes.
After almost half an hour, Steve turns back. He's almost surprised that all he sees is nature and the open blue sky; he expected someone to come find him and try to convince him to go home. Reluctantly, he accepts that he’s alone and slides back into the driver’s seat. He signals to merge onto the road, though there are no oncoming cars, and continues, letting the tires eat up the miles.
“I don't expect anything different,” he replies, and she snorts inelegantly, clapping a hand over her mouth as she dissolves into giggles.
“I dunno,” Tony replies, and gods, Steve knows that look in Tony's eyes, he's seen it a million times before in his own when he looks in the mirror, he's
“Yeah.” Steve sighs and sips from his coffee cup. “I haven't been back to the actual place since. I tried once but I, I couldn't get out of the car. It just didn't feel right without her.”
She rolls her eyes and unbuckles her seatbelt; Steve shuts off the ignition, steps out of the car, and heads to the trunk to grab the duffel bags. Clint and Bruce are in the communal living room when Natasha and Steve step off the elevator. Thor sits at the table in the kitchen, reading a science journal with a strip of bacon held aloft in his fingers but long forgotten. Tony is - nowhere to be found. It isn’t surprising, though, at least not to Steve. He hadn’t expected Tony to roll out the red carpet and make a huge deal out of their arrival. He says hello and goodnight to the others, steers himself toward his quarters.
And thank every God ever in existence for Tony being able to understand the confusion Steve is feeling, for knowing just how to find a reasonable solution. Steve nods, a jerky dip of his chin, and then he's off. He has the Quinjet prepped for departure before Clint, Natasha, and T'Challa arrive. The flight to the address Thor provided is tense, silent, and Steve barely manages to keep himself from pacing the jet's interior. When they land in a vacant lot beside two run-down buildings, Tony is waiting just like he promised, speaking quickly, quietly to JARVIS through the HUD. Thor is a statue, gaze firmly in the direction of where Bucky, according to Sharon, currently is; even if Steve didn't know Thor as well as he likes to think he does, he would be able to read Thor's emotions. The sky overhead is darkening rapidly, clouds moving in, coal-grey masses roiling and swirling, broken up only by quick flashes of lightning inside the bulk. Steve lays a hand on Thor's shoulder.
“Missed you, too.” Tony stretches up for a kiss, one that Steve willingly gives. “Sorry, Pep wanted us to be able to spend time with Pete after being gone for so long without either her or me having to wait.”
“How the Hell am I supposed to ask Thor for something like this?” he sighs. “Can’t you do it for me, J?”
Steve nods sharply, reaches for the doorknob then immediately jerks his hand back. This repeats a couple more times before he finally steels his nerves and twists the knob, pushes the door open. He steps inside and halts immediately.
“I can,” announces Steve; he lets Coulson help him to his feet then moves to stand beside Natasha. “She was with me the entire time. There’s also twenty four-hour monitoring on every room in this tower. We’d be more than willing to show you the footage.”
“Has… Has Tony said anything about me down here?” he asks, though he’s certainly not expecting a response from DUM-E ー or even JARVIS. “I just ー I wish he’d talk to me, you know? The only thing he’s ever said is that he knows we’re soulmates, but he hasn’t said anything else since then. And I thought we were becoming at least friends, so it, it kinda bothers me that he won’t talk to me about it.”
Natasha is silent for a full five minutes. When she speaks again, she doesn’t take her eyes off the city lights stretched out for miles below them, and her voice shakes slightly. “I’m scared of my past. That I will somehow teach her lessons that were beaten into me. I’m scared she’ll end up like me.”
“What’d you see?” Steve whispers when it becomes evident that Tony is lost in his thoughts, his memories. His heart is racing, but he doesn’t know if it’s nervousness of what he’s about to hear or fear for Tony’s well-being.
Peter plants his fists on his hips and stares up at Steve with a defiant expression on his face. Steve’s brain races, tries to come up with a way to peacefully break this standoff, but he doesn’t know how to refuse again without potentially causing a meltdown. He also doesn’t know the proper way to bathe a child, but that evidently matters not – he supposes he has no choice but to learn. Thankfully, he knows someone who can help.
better. That’s when the first thought came, ya know? The whole ‘What would it be like, to actually be married to you?’”
It’s a terrible way of asking someone out on a date, Steve knows it, though he can’t be upset with Nat for doing it for him ー he’s well aware that he probably wouldn’t have ever gotten over his nerves to actually ask Tony himself. His gratitude fades as time slips on without a response. Three o’clock, four o’clock, five o’clock, and still no reply from Tony. Steve tries his best to convince himself that Tony was most likely busy with the company he runs, but he can’t help the doubts. What if Tony just tries to let him down easy, but nothing is the same and Steve can no longer babysit Peter? What if their friendship is irrevocably ruined, and it’s strained and awkward and they can’t even talk to each other without going their separate ways immediately because it’s just too painful?
Tony. Steve keeps the scenery as ones he knows Tony has always loved ー the beach where they first met, the garden, a spacious field of freshly-mowed grass under a navy sky full of fireworks and dotted with stars. Tony doesn't show, though. So Steve starts leaving the scenes as places he himself knows, that bring him comfort. It never feels right, not without Tony, but Steve keeps the door open for the other man. Just in case.
“I accept your proposal of being engaged to be engaged.” He grins widely. “You sure are somethin’ else, Tony.”
Tony hesitates but eventually capitulates. Peter clings to his father for a moment, and Steve wonders if he's made a mistake, though Tony doesn't back down, just reassures the child that he's okay. Soon enough, Peter is in Steve's arms, and as if someone's cut his strings, he slumps against Steve's chest, sniffling pitifully. Tony heads further into the apartment, and Steve follows him to the kitchen. He takes his sketchbook from Tony's hand, setting it on the counter and flipping through the pages until he gets to the latest drawing. He holds it up for Peter's scrutiny.
Steve shrugs, cheeks burning again. "It's okay. I should have thought about what it might look to you. If you can't tell, I, uh, I'm not around kids very often. At all, really."
A warm grip against his shoulder, then Tony’s gone as well. Rhodes gazes at Steve, his eyes narrowed. Steve feels small, like a dead bug on a microscope slide, but he remains still and unwavering under Rhodes’s scrutiny. Without a word, Rhodes turns on his heel and leaves Steve alone in the kitchen. He lets out a heavy sigh, lets his head drop to the tabletop. He finds himself wondering, not for the first time in the last six and a half hours if they can actually do this, if the team can beat whatever this thing is.
Steve laughs softly as he presses his thumbs into a particularly knotted muscle in Tony's back. “I won't, promise. And Petey-bug will get better soon, this won't last forever.”
He’s spent little time with Loki in the past month unless those visits included checking on Steve’s welfare. So having to look at a face so clearly Steve but also not is disconcerting. At the last minute, he remembers to pretend the person at the table is Steve, ducks to press a chaste kiss to Steve-Loki’s temple.
Sherri wheels in the bassinet five minutes later. Once she double-checks the ID numbers on their security bands, she scoops up their daughter and places her carefully in Steve’s arms. It doesn’t surprise Tony when the blond’s eyes start swimming with tears; he can’t even find it in him to make a joke, not at such a tender moment. Instead, he takes a picture (or twelve) as Steve stares down at their baby.
It's almost a reprieve, the way the team is called to assemble five days after Fate’s visit due to a sudden appearance of Doombots taking over Long Island. The committee doesn't hesitate to call for the Avengers, and the Avengers don't hesitate to suit up and answer the call. Spiderman assists, his technique still his own but more practiced, more refined. He fits in quite well with the team, as his constant commentary is very similar to Clint's and is oddly endearing to Natasha and Sam. The bots are dismantled in record time, cleanup is left to SHIELD, and the team heads home within a couple of hours. Tony has JARVIS order enough Chinese food to feed a small army before disappearing to the workshop; Clint, Wanda, and Sam head off to their rooms to clean up, while Natasha helps Bruce to his lab so he can decompress after having been Hulk and being shot at. Thor makes his way to the kitchen to prepare for the delivery of food, pulling plates from cabinets and silverware from drawers, placing them on the table. Steve rushes through a shower, changes into a pair of boxers and worn sweatpants. He's just pulled a t-shirt on over his head when there's a knock on the bedroom door.
Her answering smile is one part knowing, one part tinged with sadness. “Tony anticipates everything, especially worst-case scenarios.”
“I don’t think that. Not any more,” he amends at Tony’s derisive snort, lets out a sheepish chuckle. “I think you see problems before the rest of us and look for solutions where you can. I meant what I said in that letter, Tony. I didn’t give you enough credit. But…”
“It wasn’t… Tony, are you okay? Just hang on, all right? Hulk, Thor, and Loki are trying to get you out, but the fight’s still going on. Please tell me you’re okay.”
Steve jerks at the sound of his voice; no longer deep but higher-pitched, rounder. Tony doesn’t quite manage to mask his grimace, but then he plasters a fake smile onto his face. Steve forces himself to take a deep breath, then another, even as he sits up. He glances around the workshop and sees Dum-E peeking almost tentatively from around a cluttered workbench; the fire extinguisher is still in his claw, aimed at Loki. The woman from Asgard steps forward, flashing Steve a reassuring smile.
Peter shrugs. Steve suppresses a sigh (he really should’ve expected that a four-year-old probably wouldn’t know their dietary restrictions) and sends a text to Tony; the reply text merely has a bee emoji. That’s it, nothing else. Just an emoji. Steve chuckles before grabbing a delivery menu and moving to sit beside Peter.
“Steve. The last time I let you drive with me in the car was after the surgery to get my arm fixed. By the time we got home, I was willing to give up my other arm if it meant never again being a passenger if you were behind the wheel.”
Twelve more times Steve tries to get a hold of Tony, but each time it goes to voicemail. He's just ended the fifteenth attempt when his phone buzzes loudly, Tony's name on the screen.
Steve closes his eyes as the front door closes. “Sorry 'bout that, didn't expect him to show up this morning.”
Working with the STRIKE team is nothing like working with the Commandos ー or the Avengers. With the Commandos, it was all about survival, relying on the kind of friendship and trust that only a warzone can create to carry them through and keep each other alive. The fact that they were all just a bunch of scared men playing a deadly game that they wouldn’t ー couldn’t bear to ー lose gave them the tools needed to forge connections with each other that made them into a seamless machine, well-oiled by camaraderie and jokes because if they didn’t laugh, they’d cry. With the Avengers, it had taken the loss of Agent Coulson to force them to direct their anger and fight at the Chitauri instead of their teammates. They made it through with the same sort of quips and teamwork Steve hadn’t seen since the 40s. It was enough for a moment, but then everyone went their separate ways. Rumlow tries to be friendly with Steve, and Steve is courteous in return, but he isn’t sure he can handle another friendship that fails. Natasha is the only one that he lets relatively close, if only to take a small amount of comfort in the way her eyes light up just a little at his attempts. They both ignore the way the others mutter amongst themselves, and they do their jobs.
“I hate you so much,” Steve announces, laughing as he locks his phone screen and sets the device on his desk. “What's up?”
Pietro leans over to see what Steve received, whistling sharply. “Wow, I need to get me a sugar daddy!”
Tony sits beside Steve on the sun-warmed grass, leaning back on his hands with his face tilted toward the sky like he's not felt the sun in too long. He looks out of place, with a long-sleeved shirt under a T-shirt, but it's a good  look on him. His eyes are closed, and there's a pleased little smile on his face. He has the appearance of a man who's been granted freedom from a dark, desolate prison; Steve wants to ask, needs to ask where he's been, but he can't find the words. Besides, it's not what they do. They've never asked questions about life outside of the dreams.
“But I need to –” he begins but is interrupted by the way Steve stands suddenly and starts walking toward the bedroom.
“Together?” Tony asks with a raised brow, but it doesn't sound as sarcastic as Steve would have anticipated.
Tony barely manages to not collapse directly on top of Steve, rolling to the side at the last minute, and they're both breathing heavily, panting and shivering. Steve turns to face Tony, ignoring the twinge in his lower back and ass, before leaning up to kiss the man. This kiss is gentle, tender, nothing like the last few kisses. Tony brushes a hand through Steve's sweat-damp hair and pulls him closer, and they both don't care about the mess between them.
Peter squeals as his tiny fingers twist in Steve's hair. Steve keeps his hands on the child's knees as he carefully manoeuvres his way through the crowded market, past bins of fresh fruit and stands of packaged seeds. Having Peter on his shoulders had seemed like a smart idea at the time: It meant not running the risk of Peter dashing off into the throngs of people while Steve's back was turned. But it's also made hunting for the perfect fruit difficult, since Steve can't stoop over to examine the produce without Peter potentially toppling over and off his perch. Plus, Peter may only be five, but he's got some strength in his legs, has come perilously close to strangling Steve on accident.
Steve heads to his desk, shoves his earbuds into his ears, and drowns the others out with the RENT soundtrack. But he can’t stop repeating Bucky and Natasha’s words in his head. With a heavy sigh, he pulls his phone out from his pocket and opens the thread with Tony. The last text was sent two days ago, a mass of random letters and symbols ー either Peter got a hold of Tony’s phone, or Tony was mind-numbingly bored at a meeting; both of those options are equally possible, and neither of them would surprise Steve in the least. He takes a steadying breath, starts typing out a message only to delete everything before he can get the courage to press Send. This repeats five times before his phone is suddenly ripped from his hand, and a soft whoosh sounds as Natasha lets his phone drop back to his desk. He sends a glare in her direction, but she merely smiles and ambles through the room to go back to the Photography section.
Steve recoils but he can't argue; that's exactly what he'd dreamed, as well, and it hurts him to his core that Tony had had the same vision in his sleep. “Yeah, uh, that.”
Steve looks nervous throughout the entire lunch; Tony knows his partner is terrified of the truth being figured out, that someone will let slip that things aren’t what they seem, but Pepper and Tony have both had years of experience when it comes to swaying public perception, and Loki is literally the God of Lies and Mischief, and Steve is determined for things to go according to plan. So the risk of this being seen as anything other than a meal between two superheroes, a CEO, and a young woman is small, almost nonexistent.
He lets out a huff of laughter and heads toward the bedroom. “Why is it you always jump to the worst possible conclusion, Tony? I could just be calling to tell you I love you and that I’m thinkin’ ‘bout you.”
Steve chokes on air, coughing until he can breathe properly again. Heart still racing in his chest, he asks, “Why's that?”
I’m pissed, Tony! I’ve spent the last god knows how many hours searching for you everywhere while trying to keep the company running smoothly, not letting anyone know you were nowhere to be found, and oh, that’s right – trying to comfort your boyfriend, who is understandably upset because we couldn’t find you and JARVIS wasn’t giving us any answers, so we thought maybe he was malfunctioning or hacked, which seemed more than likely when my override code, nor James’s, didn’t work. And all this time, all I had to do was
“Well, Pepper is a smart lady, and I may not be a genius like you, but I like to think I'm pretty intelligent, so maybe we're on to something, you just gotta, ya know, listen to us.”
“I, um, I told him I wasn’t comfortable havin’ that discussion. I figured I shouldn’t say anythin’ else until I talked to you and Tony.”
When Steve tries calling back, there’s no answer; Tony’s either busy with work or sleeping. Steve leaves a voicemail that simply says “Got your calls. Sorry, I was sleepin’. Call me back when you get the chance.” He sets his phone down and lets himself focus on helping Peter get dressed and ready for school. He drops Peter off at school and goes to work, but he can't concentrate. His thoughts are scrambling in circles ー Tony said he loves Steve, he loves Steve, but is he only saying that because Steve said it first? Or does he mean it? The others appear to notice that Steve isn't himself today, and they show uncharacteristic consideration and leave him alone.
, and then he tentatively pushes closer. That seems to be what Steve was waiting for, if the way the kiss turns harder and more insistent is any indication. He slides one hand up Tony's arm to cradle his jaw, tilts his head to slot their mouths more firmly together, and Tony’s lips part on a soft sigh. There are no fireworks behind his closed eyelids, the world doesn't flip upside down, and his foot doesn't pop up from the ground, but Tony doesn't care.
“Don’t open it yet. I’ll distract Tony once you get back to the penthouse. Also, Steve? Use condoms when you guys have sex.”
Steve stares at the cityscape through the large window. The weather is starting to drift from summer into fall; the streets are lined with trees in a variety of colours, and pedestrians have begun to wear light jackets. He’s watching the rainbow of kites floating in the sky over the park when the door clicks open behind him. He turns to face Tony whose brows furrows in confusion.
Steve sighs. “I’m… I’m not happy, exactly, that you drank the way you did, but you’re a grown adult, you can make your own decisions about your health. But you just disappearing like that made me wonder if I’m going to be doing this all on my own, whether this was a – a mistake. It’s, well, it’s a terrible feeling, and I don’t want to feel it again. I can’t keep dealing with the uncertainty of if and when you’ll start resenting me for this. Yes, I’m the one who brought up the discussion and the idea of a child, but you agreed. This is
“This, this is fine.” Tony gives Steve a long look with narrowed eyes, but his expression finally smooths out, and he's grinning bright and real. “So how have you been? It's been a while, I know, and I know I promised to try to do better about our visits, but ー”
For the next week, Tony heads to the sunroom once Steve is asleep. Natasha brings the beverage of the night, and Tony supplies snacks. They don’t drink two bottles of vodka in one sitting again, not after he fell asleep with his cheek smashed against the window and woke up sprawled across the floor, body aching and head pounding and Steve staring down at him with clear disappointment. So Tony apologised profusely, promised to stick to only nonalcoholic drinks, and crawled himself into the nearest shower.
“Nerves are to be expected, Captain Rogers, but do not worry. There is nothing to hurt you.” Loki’s smile is surely meant to be comforting, but Steve isn’t really reassured, not with the memory of his last encounter with Loki. “The process is fast and painless, though it will be uncomfortable, especially the first time. It is easier if you close your eyes and keep an open mind, remember why you are here, why you are doing this. Magic works best when placed upon willing participants.”
“Okay, first off, it’s not a date, and even if I was going on a date, why would your mind immediately jump to my neighbour?”
Steve kisses away the lascivious smirk that Tony is sending him. “We better go if we don't wanna be late.”
Steve gives him a flat, unimpressed look, but Tony doesn’t react much beyond a quiet chuckle before he puts the car in gear and points the wheels toward home.
“It’s probably for the best. I was planning on calling a team meeting for after we talk to Thor and Loki.”
Security feed after security feed filters across the holographic screens, and Tony keeps a close eye on the videos. It’s been two weeks since the night of Steve’s nightmare; there have been more, according to JARVIS’s reports, but Tony wasn’t there through them. Either the AI managed to wake the super-soldier or Tony was away on trips for SI. Every time Tony’s learned of a new one in his absence, it feels like yet another way that Tony is failing Steve. He’d never come right out and
“We've got him, Stark.” Sharon takes up position beside Tony, glances at Steve. “Thor has a message for you. You should go see what it is,
Tony hangs up without anything further, and Steve heads back down the hall to the living room. Peter is still curled up on the couch, his tiny body fitting on one cushion. Steve ignores the way his heart aches at the misery on the child's face and sits next to him.
A relieved sigh gusts from Steve when it’s announced that the Accords have been accepted, that the majority of the United Nations assembly approved of the steps the Avengers are taking to keep themselves under control. A few members had questioned whether it was truly safe for custody of Bucky to be in Tony Stark’s hands; Tony had merely smiled that that wicked smile of his that says he’s playing along but desperately wants to rip someone to shreds, and Steve hadn’t hesitated ー he’d stood, back ramrod straight, and told the committee that no one could be trusted more than Tony Stark, and it was entirely unacceptable that Tony’s heroism and trustworthiness were being called into question.
that might fight even slightly, since the child’s only clothes are currently lying, dirty, on the bathroom floor. He manages to find a T-shirt from before the growth spurt that brought him a foot taller and allowed him to gain almost eighty pounds. The shirt still dwarfs Peter when Steve pulls it over his head, but Peter doesn’t seem to mind at all; he just grips the bottom hem in his small hands and holds it out of the way so he doesn’t trip as he makes his way down the hall to the living room. Steve hurriedly cleans up the mess in the bathroom, folds Peter’s dirty clothes, and unplugs the tub. The water starts draining with a loud gurgle, and Steve turns off the light and follows after the boy.
Peter launches himself at Steve, burying his tear-streaked face into Steve's belly, and Steve rests a hand on the child's sweaty curls. Peter's shoulders are shaking slightly; Steve lowers down a bit until he's looking directly into Peter's eyes. He brushes a hand against the kid’s cheek, wincing at how warm and splotchy his skin is.
Steve is still so angry as he pulls on his shoes that all he wants to do is continue the argument with Tony. He refrains, however; his ma and Bucky have always told him he just doesn’t know when to quit, and the last thing he wants is to prove them right. Unfortunately, Tony seems to have no such qualms, because his door flings open just as Steve is starting down the stairs, and he calls out Steve’s name. Steve slows but doesn’t stop walking.
Back at the motel, the trio goes over the data collected from the destroyed base. It appears to have been nothing more than a supply depot, a one-stop shop for information and weapons alike. The laptop cleans up the image of the corpse and spits back a short bio. No known name, just an alias used between HYDRA agents, which means they’re getting smarter in the modern age: Erase everything possible of a person’s public identity and leave only what they don’t mind being found. Sam sends the image in an email ー most probably to Tony ー while Steve retrieves the list of bases. Natasha leans over and unzips her bag, pulling something from its depths; the paper rustles as she unfolds a large map. Steve watches as she carefully tears it in half, folding up the portion that doesn’t include the United States. She then opens a pack of page markers, grabs a pen from the nightstand, and writes a few words in neat, tiny letters on a bright green Post-It tab before sticking it on the map over their current location.
As Steve recounts what happened in the kitchen, Tony winces. He knows exactly where Steve went wrong. It’s Natasha’s decision as to whether or not her fears get exposed, so Tony only promises to talk to her. He holds Steve as long as the blond wants, which turns out to be another ten minutes. Steve gives him a wan smile, slips the photograph back into his book, and clambers awkwardly off the bed.
"You as well, ma'am." Tony crossed the room, bowing and pressing a kiss to the air above her delicate hand. "I'm glad to see you're in such great health and as beautiful as ever."
Twenty minutes later, Steve finds himself sitting in the comfortable computer chair behind Tony’s desk. Both Natasha and Clint utilised their “sneaky ninja” skills to get him here without detection, and JARVIS rearranged Tony’s schedule so that as far as the genius is aware, he has a last-minute meeting starting in five minutes.
Steve laughs quietly as Tony drags the crib close to the bed. Once Sarah is settled, Tony nudges and pushes at Steve until there’s enough space on the bed for the both of them. It doesn’t take long before the events of the day catch up with him. He yawns into Steve’s hair, sighs as exhaustion takes over.
A warmth blossoms in Steve’s chest now whenever he sees Tony, and it takes far longer than it should to recognise what it is. He’s disgusted with himself when he realises that somewhere in the last year, he’s fallen in love with the other man. It certainly isn’t the time, he knows it isn’t, and their past history ー from the first meeting on the Helicarrier to telling Tony that Bucky killed his parents ー means there is little to no chance that Tony would ever reciprocate those feelings. So Steve keeps it to himself; he pretends the feelings don’t exist and forces himself to focus on the friendship. If he falls asleep each night with his fingers pressing painfully into the soulmark on his chest, no one needs to know.
Thankfully, Tony and Pepper come back from their overseas business trip shortly after dawn on Saturday morning. Steve is woken up by someone unlocking the front door; he rolls off the couch and stands at attention, hands curled into loose fists at his side, as Happy enters the apartment. Steve slumps. He's not
is here, sitting as far away from the archer's bare feet as possible on the sofa. Steve remains in the doorway. His arms are crossed over his torso. The only one not in the room to witness Tony making a fool of himself is Bruce (he declined Sam's excited invitation by claiming he has a time-sensitive experiment, the lucky bastard).
The sound of Billie Holiday singing pulls him from the world of Frodo and Gandalf. Steve sets the book aside, reaching for his phone. Tony smiles sleepily on the screen, a picture that Steve snapped in the early hours a month into their dating. Steve grins, thumb tapping the Accept button.
Steve sets the glasses on the coffee table, sitting heavily on the couch. He knows he should warn Tony that he won’t be much company, not tonight, but oddly enough, he doesn’t want to make Tony feel like he has to leave. So instead, he watches as Tony gets
He tries to argue that Tony doesn’t hate him, that he just needs some time to deal with everything he’s learned, but then Steve realises he’s arguing with himself and exhales sharply.
A quiet gasp breaks the silence of the room, and Tony grins as Pepper wipes away more tears. The rest of the team files in after her; Tony can smell the antiseptic foam from where he sits halfway across the room. Rhodey’s already sent congratulatory texts and his regrets that he couldn’t get time from the Air Force to be home with them. Clint and Thor are carrying chocolate cigars, all wrapped up in pink and blue foil. Coulson holds up his phone, silently asking for permission. Tony nods. Coulson’s been here since day one and has never so much considered telling Fury the truth about Loki being Captain America while Steve was pregnant – he hasn’t even used it as a
Inside are ten fifty-dollar bills and five hundreds. Steve marches toward the door, ignoring his best friend calling after him, and cross the halls. Tony answers Steve’s knocks almost immediately; Steve is momentarily stunned by the other man’s appearance, which is much less put-together than any other time they’ve crossed paths: Tony’s tie is draped around his neck, unknotted, and half of the front of his shirt is untucked from his slacks. Even his hair isn’t as neatly styled as usual. Steve quickly gets his focus back, pushing the envelope against Tony’s chest.
Tony knocks on the door, waiting a moment before opening it. Steve looks away from the television, smiles when he sees Tony. A plush recliner has been placed by the bed; Tony crosses the room and sits down. He immediately reaches for Steve’s hand.
“Steve? Are you okay?” Tony's voice is so full of concern, it causes a lump to form on Steve's throat.
“Not a problem, hitched a ride with Sam and Nat,” Bucky replies with an easy shrug. “Why don't you go back home, get more sleep? Because you look like dried shit on toast.”
Shockingly, during those four weeks, the world was – mostly – quiet. Any stirrings of trouble were easily taken care of by SHIELD, Natasha, and Clint. The “assassin twins” came home from each send-out with little to no damage inflicted on them. The lack of villains bent on destroying the world has been slightly perplexing, but Steve can’t deny it’s been nice to not have to worry about saving Earth with all the training and planning they’ve been doing.
“Hey, there. You must be Peter.” She grins when all he does is nod hesitantly. “Well, Steve here talks a lot about you, says you're super-smart and an amazing artist. Wanna meet some other artists?”
Tony sets aside the tablet and crosses the sunroom to sit by her side. “And that right there proves that you’re
“Honey, she’s half-you and half-me, so there’s no doubt in my mind that she will. You love art, I love you. She really has no choice not to.”
That was two weeks ago. Now, Steve’s lying in bed, curled up on his side as he watches the sun’s golden rays creep across the walls. He’s been awake since Tony left for work at six-thirty, unable to sleep any longer but not having the motivation or energy to move. Finally, he rolls over and asks JARVIS for the day’s forecast. Maybe he and Natasha can go for a jog in the park if it’s nice out. The AI relays the information with his usual smooth cadence, but there’s
Steve hangs up and closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. His ma is right: He can do this. It sounds simple enough. He squares his shoulders and gazes down at Peter, whose expression has slowly gotten more hopeful. With a sigh, Steve beckons for the child to follow him. He double– and triple-checks the water’s temperature as it gushes from the tap; he plugs the tub up and waits, twisting the knobs once the basin is halfway full of lukewarm water.
“It’s necessary. Ajax, the Abomination, Vanko… No ordinary prison would hold them. The world needs the Raft to keep them contained.”
"I need you to listen very carefully, Steve. That little boy is my entire life. I will do anything to protect him and keep him safe, okay? If you don't want to watch him, then be upfront and honest about it. I'm not going to be mad. I just thought I'd ask you because he had such a good time and really enjoyed you watching him last night."
. They part in the hallway, sharing a soft kiss over Peter's head, and Steve watches as Tony disappears behind his door before going into his own flat. He doesn't bother turning on lights, just toes out of his shoes and makes his way down the dark hall, flopping onto his cold sheets. He can't fight the smile that forces its way onto his face, so he doesn't even try. He just falls asleep feeling warm down to his bones.
“You're worth it,” whispers Steve, catching Tony's lips in a softer, gentler kiss. “I better go, I don't think I got enough willpower to be capable of not touchin’ ya again.”
Dancing with Pepper feels...not quite right, but familiar, easy. So he lets himself get lost in the motions, in the feeling of Pepper held closely, in the scent of her perfume, even as his eyes keep flicking back toward Steve and his date. Natasha catches his eye from where she's twirling gracefully with some congressman, and he recognises that gleam in her eye. He forces a smile, focuses back on Pepper.
“Of course not,” he snaps, sighing out an apology a second later. “I just thought that if anyone could figure out a way of making it possible, Tony would be that person.” He groans. “Forget it. This is all so stupid.”
Tony's eyes seem to glaze over at the mention of a shower, but the expression is gone almost instantly. “Of course. Go on. I'll make sure Peter knows you say goodbye and you'll see him in two weeks.”
“Steve, I love you – or as close to loving a really close friend as I’m capable of. But one, I don’t love you enough for that, even if I
He doesn't see Tony that night, because he doesn't sleep. He can't allow himself to be selfish, to give away time meant for Ma, no matter how much he loves Tony.
Tony shrugs as he checks on Peter in the rearview mirror. "The books are better. He mentioned an 'emergency'."
It’s been two months since his desire to have a child with Tony hit him like a runaway freight train, and it’s just grown stronger every day. There have been a handful of times, just in the last few weeks alone, where Steve has nearly blurted it out; only his much stronger desire to not fight with - or worse, lose - Tony has stopped the words from slipping past his teeth. He’s forced himself to ignore his wants and go about the days like normal.
Steve hangs up, standing and shoving his phone in his pocket. He doesn't bother asking Bucky for permission for his car; he ducks into the photography section, makes his way to the lockers, and quickly inputs Bucky's combination (seriously, an amalgamation of Nat, Clint, Sam, and Bucky's birthdays is not a secure combination). He swipes the keys off the top shelf and leaves the room before he's found out.
The small diner they walk into is unlike any other diner Steve's ever seen. The walls are a sunny yellow, decorated with pictures of the past; dark tables have actual place-mats ringing a basket of condiments and tidy menus in the centre. Tony leads them to a booth toward the middle of the far wall. Peter lets go of Steve, clambers onto the seat, and sits on his knees. Tony slides in beside him, and Steve takes the other side. He stares at the photograph on the wall - the man in it looks vaguely familiar.
He ignores the stab of guilt at keeping this from her, but he justifies the secrecy with the excuse of not having talked to Queen Frigga yet. Natasha continues her jog, unaware of Steve’s inner dialogue; he sighs, steps onto the treadmill, and presses the power button, hoping he can somehow outrun his emotions.
There’s something odd in JARVIS’s voice when he announces Thor’s presence in the communal living room and strongly urges Steve to make his way there. Though announcements of the inhabitants’ comings and goings are common enough to hear, the AI rarely speaks in anything other than a calm, even cadence, his tone smooth and soothing. So at the lack of normalcy in JARVIS’s voice, Steve immediately hurries out of his art studio, not bothering to pack up his supplies, and rushes down the stairs.
Tony's hand is gentle in Steve's hair, brushing it back, and Steve turns his head to press his face into Tony's warm palm. Tony stares down at him with dark eyes; the bruise-purple circles under his eyes stand out prominently in the dim light, making the rest of his face seem pale, washed out, in comparison. A soft sigh escapes Tony, and he shifts to stretch out beside Steve.
“One moment, please. Yes, it appears that seven of the coordinates have been marked in HYDRA files as bases of operations, twelve are currently unknown, and the remaining twenty are either supply depots or safehouses, including the one you visited today.”
“Tony.” Steve turns his attention back to Bruce. “I figured he can’t be too mad at it if he can’t actually tell it isn’t me.”
“Why? Why can't we meet? It's been twenty, uh, twenty-six years since these dreams started, and I just, I want more. Tony, you're...you're it for me, ever since we were kids. I don't want to hafta stick to only havin’ you when we're both asleep. I wanna be where you are,
Once the other three took their leave and the door to Thor’s apartment was closed, Frigga gestured for Steve and Tony to follow her into the guest room. Loki was lighting the last candle just as his mother entered the room; Steve allowed the trickster to guide him to the spot where a blanket had been spread across the floor, laid down, and took a deep breath. Loki stepped back, and Frigga took his place, kneeling beside Steve. It was hard to ignore the six pairs of eyes focused on him, even more so once the queen untied the belt and pulled his robe open. Steve stared at the ceiling, willed away the burning in his cheeks. He nearly jumped out of his skin at the first touch of cool stone against his belly. Frigga let out a reassuring sound but continued placing the crystals on his stomach; the candlelight on the smooth facets of the crystals sent off quivering shimmers, or maybe it was the golden tendrils seeping and sparking between Frigga’s fingers. She murmured words, low in her throat, and Steve found himself relaxing, though he had no hope of understanding the language. His skin warmed from the inside out, a burnished rosy glow emanating from below the flesh. He lost track of time the longer the goddess queen worked.
. He turns his head and freezes as soft tendrils brush, light as a feather, across his shoulders. A low groan escapes him when a current zips along under his skin; the loud voices suddenly stop, and slender hands slide gently along the curves of his face. He wants to move, get the fingers away, they’re not Tony’s, why are they touching him?, but his body won’t cooperate. It can’t fight the bone-deep exhaustion.
They lay in silence, Steve wrapped in Tony’s arms. Tony presses gentle kisses to Steve’s hair and holds him close.
Pepper's eyes shine brightly under the dim lighting, and Tony turns in his chair to give Steve an assessing look. Steve shifts awkwardly, uncomfortable with the sudden scrutiny. Coulson, at least, turns his gaze away from Steve to give the man some semblance of privacy in the silence that's settled over them. Eventually, Tony clears his throat and focuses on Coulson, asking information about what he does and how he and Pepper had met. Steve knows the story ー Coulson has told him all about the deep conversation he had with the woman who attended one of the gallery showings and even purchased a large shot of Bucky and Sam holding Natasha in the air, her arms tangled in vivid red ribbons dangling from the ceiling just out of shot, each of her legs being cradled almost lovingly by the men's hands. It's one of Steve's favourite pieces; it shows off the strength in both Sam and Bucky's bodies, the tightly coiled musculature of Natasha's slender build, and the gleaming, sleek metal of Bucky's prosthetic. It isn't until Pepper says something about how beautiful it is to see Stark technology on an actual human, that Steve realises just how many chances he's had to meet Tony, but all it took, in the end, was Tony needing a last-minute babysitter that brought them together.
Steve has to search his memory, but then he remembers the very first time he ever rode in Tony's car. His cheeks burn even as he laughs, kissing Tony gently. Tony pulls the door open, waits for Steve to get settled in the passenger seat, then shuts the door with a solid thump. Steve exhales shakily while he watches Tony round the back of the car and slide into his own seat. They don't speak as Tony pulls out of the parking stall, as he steers the vehicle onto the road, but unlike their disastrous first dinner, this silence isn't uncomfortable. The soft strains of guitar and drums fill the air, and Steve catches himself bobbing his head along to the beat. He ignores the amused glances Tony sends his way, reaching over the console to grasp Tony's free hand in his own.
Steve watches the way Tony's suit jacket clings to his shoulders, the subtle swing of his hips as he steps down the staircase. Nala meows plaintively on the second-floor landing, and Steve ducks down long enough to scratch behind her ear, continuing to follow Tony down the stairs and into the small underground parking garage. Tony stops next to his car, presses a hand to Steve's chest, and smiles widely.
“The biometric sensors indicate physical signs of anger, but as far as I am able to ascertain, he is merely pacing.”
“How about this. Steve and I will talk about it, okay? But there’s no guarantee he’ll say yes, and you, my wonderful little meddler, will have to just deal with whatever answer you get. Fair?”
It takes two days for the hurt and anger over Tony’s latest stunt to fade. Steve is grateful that, for once, Tony has accepted that Steve needed some space. Sam’s tried to help Steve sort through the chaos of his emotions; Bruce told Steve to remember that bad habits never die easily, and even then, they tend to show up at the most inopportune times; Thor has been confused by, but understanding of, the lack of affection being displayed between Tony and Steve. Pepper had sent the Iron Man armour back to the tower the day after she found her ex-boyfriend sleeping off a hangover, a Post-It note taped to the inside of the faceplate. Tony handed the note over to Steve without a word, then disappeared back into his workshop where he’s spent the last forty-eight hours, according to JARVIS.
One more brush of their lips, and Tony's heading back into his apartment, closing the door behind him softly. Steve stares at the wood for a moment before making a decision. He yanks on his shoes, locks his door, and makes his way down the stairs, dialling a number as he goes. The air outside is humid, promises a rainy night. Steve spares a thought that he should have brought an umbrella, just in case, but he presses forward instead of turning back to get his from the living room closet. The man behind the counter waves when Steve steps into the diner three blocks away; he heard about this place after Sam and Natasha's first date. Natasha had merely said “It was decent”, which, for her, is extolling praises.
use that code unless it was a matter of life or death and there was no other choice. You made him feel like he’d somehow done something wrong when what he’s doing is carrying
“Yeah, I am. And, normally, I'd want nothing more than to, to talk about this, but an explanation has to wait. Please, just trust me, okay?”
A knock startles Steve around six o'clock, and he checks that Peter is still resting before he crosses the living room and peeks through the peephole. An unfamiliar man stands on the other side of the door. Steve hesitates before opening the door a crack, using his body as a barricade.
, because the Bucky I knew would never do that, but it was something that some version of him did. I was selfish, and I hurt you in the process of saving my memory of a man who fell seventy years ago. I am, I am so damn sorry, Tony.”
Steve follows, laughing. His heart is thumping wildly in his chest, and he feels almost giddy with ecstasy as they leave the office. Workers do double-takes when Steve and Tony pass, but Tony’s attention is far from them. His hand finds Steve’s, and Steve allows him to lead the way.
Gentle knocking on the door brings Steve out of his light dozing. He checks that Peter is still asleep, heading to the door after the child lets out a shuddering breath and rolls onto his back. The man from across the hall stands there, looking dead on his feet, but he manages to give Steve a small smile.
). Tony is in the workshop when Steve makes his way down. The engineer is firmly stuck in work-mode, so Steve spends some time playing with the bots. Dum-E, for all the flaws in his code, keeps close to Steve, claw gentle as it strokes along the blond’s rounded belly. Tony’s made comments about not letting the bots touch (
Steve inhales deeply and holds it until he feels less shaky. He lets the breath out at a controlled pace, decides on a course of action. “Okay. Can you send me the list again but this time organised by category?”

“Did…did I do something wrong? Because you’re acting weird, and if I somehow managed to fuck up despite not even being within a block of the tower all day, tell me now so I can fix it.”

wear a guy out. But Steve, look at me.” He waits for Steve to lift his head, to be able to see his blue eyes. “There is nothing in this entire world that I would put before you. I love you, and I will always, always,
Steve steps back but keeps his hand on Peter's shoulder and meets the nurse’s eye. She gives him a gentle smile and holds out a plastic bag; he takes it with a raised brow.
They’ve talked about everything from the baby to their pasts, and with each passing hour, Tony feels closer to Natasha. They had a rocky beginning to their acquaintanceship, but he finds that easy to ignore in light of the actual friendship they’ve forged. Outside of the sunroom, they’re the same as they have been – witty banter and heatless threats and hidden affection – but here, they  both let down their masks, at least a little, at least for a while.
have talked to you like an adult, but I didn’t. I am in this with you. I want you, I want this baby –
Eventually, it all comes to a head. Sam, Natasha, and Steve manage to get to the base right as the fire is making its way through the complex, and Steve shoves open his door at the sight of the solitary figure standing just outside the fence. His heart pounds in his throat as the weak sun glints off the metal of the person’s arm. Startlingly clear blue-grey eyes meet Steve’s within a second, and even from this distance, Steve can see the hatred and anger in Bucky’s eyes. Steve doesn’t even get to speak before Bucky is turning on his heel and sprinting toward the copse of trees along the outer barrier of the base, disappearing into the shadows. Steve stares after him, feels for all the world like he’s failed again.
“Okay. I still can’t believe you’re really here,” Tony whispers as he brushes warm fingers across Steve’s cheek.
, yes, but he agreed, but if I made a mistake in telling him, I’m sure I could make a memory eraser and Agent K his ass.”
“We've been over for a while,” Steve whispers back. “There was someone else that was getting in the way of our relationship, and it wasn't fair to either of us.”
Steve nods slowly. His heart rate is steadily dropping to a more normal pace. “Yeah, I’m fine. Thank you.”
“Sorry, I promise I’m not laughin’ at you. You’re definitely not fucking this up. This… this is much more than I expected.”
“Oh. Yes. There was...someone shortly after Tony and I broke up. It was, it was great for about a year, and then he decided a kid wasn’t in his plans. Evidently, he felt he wasn’t cut out to be dating a CEO who was busy with a multinational company to run and mothering a child fathered by Tony. It was an ugly breakup, a long time coming, really, and Peter took it incredibly hard. He was okay, for the most part, when Tony and I separated, because he still sees Tony regularly, but I think he knew that Aldrich was never going to stay in his life. And a year of being around someone and them just...disappearing like that? I didn’t expect it to be easy on Peter, but it hurt him more than I anticipated. Aldrich didn’t make it any less difficult. It took almost a month for the breakup to be final, and nearly every day, he’d be around, going from wanting to work it out and trying to be a second father to Peter, to turning around and ignoring him and screaming about how I worked too much and the relationship wasn’t worth it if he never got to see me.” Pepper blinks rapidly, and Phil reaches up to gently brush the tears from her cheeks. “It was terrible, and I’ve regretted ever letting Aldrich into our lives.”
His thoughts are interrupted by a rhythmic knock on the door. He grinds to a halt and swallows down the sudden surge of panic. Taking a few steadying breaths, Steve smooths down his shirt and makes his way across the room. Tony stands just on the other side, and he grins widely as soon as the door opens.
Tony’s laughter is muffled by Steve’s kiss, the sound morphing into a gasp when Steve slips his hand beneath the band of his sweats. The brunet arches up; his cock is hot and hard in the circle of Steve’s fingers, and Steve nips gently at Tony’s collarbone. He still feels terrible for how he reacted earlier, but the feeling of Tony beneath him, the taste of Tony’s kisses and skin, the scent of motor oil and cologne and sex… It’s all overwhelming him in the best of ways, so much so that he’s having a hard time remembering what they were arguing about.
The skies are dark, clear, as Tony flies back home. Rhodey hadn’t been impressed by his impromptu visit – though that could have been the fact that Rhodey was in the middle of a “training exercise” for the Air Force – and he was even less impressed by the situation when Tony explained it. He’d given Tony an exasperated look, shaken his head, and grabbed them both a soda (because Rhodey really is the best and has been a huge support in Tony’s “No more drinking and fucking up my life” endeavour).
“I don’t think anything of what you said is stupid, Steve. A bit unorthodox, sure. Definitely unexpected. But not stupid. You’re right. If anybody in this world could ever find a way of making male pregnancy in humans possible, it would absolutely be Tony, especially for you. Unfortunately, you’ll never know if he wants to try until you talk to him.” She stares at him, green eyes considering. “What would you do if he said no, he doesn’t children and never will?”
This catches Peter’s attention; his head snaps up, and his dark eyes widen. “I’m starving,” he announces, dragging out the ‘r’ sound.
Tony doesn’t stop, his mouth and hand working in tandem on Steve’s cock, a finger of the other hand pressing lightly at the skin behind Steve’s balls. Steve doesn’t try to hold back now, just fucks up into Tony’s mouth as he chases the orgasm that’s so close. He comes with a hoarse cry of Tony’s name, and Tony works him through it. Steve collapses onto the floor, breathing quickly and heavily, as he tries to regain composure. The blue-white circle on his chest thrums, vivid in the dim light of the holoscreen candles, and Steve presses a hand over it, his heart racing beneath his ribs. Tony crawls over Steve, leans down to kiss him ー just a soft, tender thing. His erection jabs into Steve’s belly, and Steve reaches down to wrap his hand around it. The angle is awkward, but since neither of them seems to want to separate, Steve doesn’t give a damn; he strokes Tony’s cock as fully as he’s able, spreading pre-cum along the tip with his thumb.
He helps Natasha pull Steve into a sitting position; her hands are gentle as she cups his face, stares at him with eyes that are too bright.
Tony chuckles, exiting the bathroom and crossing the bedroom; Steve lets Tony lean up against his back, reaches up to wrap a hand around Tony's wrist. “Steve, darling, that's not a glowing recommendation, just so you know.”
He manages to take off his shirt while still lying down, but he leaves unbuttoning his pants to Tony; Steve is too afraid his fingers won’t work properly. He’s just tossed his shirt to the side when he lets out a yelp, groaning low and long in his throat at the sudden wet warmth on his cock. He clenches his hands into fists at his side, but all he really wants is to bury his fingers in Tony’s hair, to hold on tight. Tony pulls back enough to tongue at the slit, and Steve’s hips twitch, jerk upwards. Tony chuckles, his breath hot and humid on the head of Steve’s dick, before he wraps his lips around the tip again, slowly lowering until his nose presses against Steve’s flesh. Steve forces himself to hold still so he doesn’t choke Tony, but that willpower is thrown out the window when Tony swallows around him. Tony moves with Steve, his head pulling back as Steve’s hips thrust up, and his fingers slip between Steve’s thighs. Steve lets his legs fall open, too enthralled by the sensations for his mind to work properly.
“I didn’t think about it much, after Peter initially put the thought into my head. Then…it became more of a consistent thing. I don’t even remember now what you did, I honestly can’t, but… I think you were just pacing the living room, singing to Peter as you carried him back and forth because, uh, right, he had that ear infection really bad, remember? And you were trying so hard to get him to sleep because he was just so exhausted but he couldn’t because of the pain, a-and you looked absolutely wrecked, and I wanted to make it better, make
to have it instead of his own son? Maybe Tony’s lying, Steve’s brain whispers, though he doesn’t believe himself. He grabs onto that reasoning, however; he has too much on his mind as it is to chase the white rabbit down that particular hole. He has done well to avoid thinking about the Triskelion falling, HYDRA being in SHIELD all the way to the core, Fury’s “death”... Bucky being alive. But now that he’s finally alone, no one around except for an omnipresent AI system, it all comes rushing to the forefront of his mind. Anger and betrayal war deep inside of him with pain and grief and helplessness. He can’t believe that Bucky has been in HYDRA’s hands for seventy years, and no one knew. No one knew which means no one tried to save him.
Natasha holds up her phone and gives it a little shake to indicate she’s received the coordinates. Steve thanks JARVIS and sighs, gesturing toward the bathroom. Natasha waves a disinterested hand in his direction and Sam nods before leaning over the map. Steve doesn’t waste any more time; he scoops up his phone and pushes to his feet.
Frigga exchanges a look with Thor before nodding at Steve. “That would be appreciated, Captain. Thank you.”
“Tony, I've spent almost thirty years wanting more than just visits in dreams with you. Now that I have it, I'm not givin’ it up if I can help it. You've always been a constant in my life, ever since I was five. You have been the one person I trusted wholeheartedly the entire time, besides Ma and Bucky. And, well, I've known for so long that anywhere that you are? That's home to me, no matter what’s out there waiting. You're it for me. You're my home.”
“And if we’re down a player for whatever reason,” interjects Tony, “I’m sure Rhodey will step in to help. Plus, JARVIS can control the suits, so we have those at – well, I was going to say ‘at our disposal,’ but I’d much rather not be disposing of them. They’re my babies.”
Shoving the groceries into his fridge to keep cold, he makes his way to the bathroom, stripping on the way. He showers quickly, makes sure that every inch of his body is scrubbed clean and that he doesn't stink from the walk to and from work; he loops a towel around his waist as he steps out of the shower stall, turning the water off as he goes. He shaves quickly but thoroughly, splashes on some aftershave, and walks into his bedroom. Finding a plain white T-shirt and boxer-briefs is the easy part, but it leaves him struggling to figure out what to wear. He doesn’t want to look too dressy, nor does he want to look too casual. He eventually settles on a pair of black slacks and a dark oxford shirt with a white gingham pattern, rolls the sleeves to his elbows. Steve inhales slowly, trying to force himself to calm down as he examines his reflection in the mirror on the back of his bedroom door. He pulls on a pair of navy socks as he hops his way back down the hall to grab up his converse shoes.
After a quick shower, small clumps of melon splatting onto the floor and him dancing awkwardly when the hot water suddenly turns icy, Steve stumbles out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. It's barely five-thirty in the afternoon, but he's exhausted. He's spent the last three hours with Peter at the park then the market, walking around and chasing the child between playground equipment. It was more fun than Steve has had in a long time, and he enjoyed every second.
That conversation in the workshop seems to act as a catalyst: Tony allows Steve to come to the workshop whenever he wants, no matter if Tony is there or not. There’s even a portion of the workshop ー small and out of the way ー that Tony has set up for Steve to work on art if he wants. The time spent there is usually quiet, peaceful, and Steve appreciates being able to be there if Tony needs help with heavy lifting. There is even one holoscreen devoted specifically to tracking Bucky’s movements; Steve doesn’t try to go after him, as much as he wants to. He knows Bucky will just keep running and Steve will just keep falling behind. But to be able to see tiny white dots show up on the map of where he’s been is almost comforting. Steve finds himself getting distracted from what he’s doing whenever Tony is around, too intent on listening to the man ramble or too busy staring at the way his eyes light up when he’s excited, darken when he’s upset. Often, Steve has to force himself to ignore the urge, the desire, to cup Tony’s cheek in his hand and kiss him speechless. His nightmares have given way to dreams of what could be but never will.
Tony sighs, deciding to treat it like ripping off a bandaid – one quick motion to lessen the pain, or awkwardness, as the case may be. “Steve wants a baby, but he doesn’t want to go through a surrogate, and he’d rather not adopt, which means he actually wants to
To Tony’s surprise (and slight dismay), Thor is on Earth and back in New York within three days. The god is standing in the corridor outside the workshop when Tony heads down after a very long day of touring the newest acquisition in SI’s roster. Tony, to his credit, doesn’t falter, just breezes past Thor and through the door. Dum-E whirs over immediately, bypassing his creator to pluck inelegantly at Thor’s cape.
Steve nods, adds the key to his keyring, and drops a ten on the table, waving at Tony before heading out of the diner.
Tony laughs loudly, ducking into the driver's seat and quickly yanking the door shut before Pepper can reach him. Phil chuckles, grabs Pepper's hand, and tugs her away toward his own vehicle, even as Pepper mimes smacking Tony with a shoe. Steve watches them go before he slides into the passenger seat. Tony reaches over and cups Steve's jaw with a hand, turning his face. The kiss they share is soft with just the right amount of heat and promise of less tender moments in the near future. Steve moans into the kiss, tries to push further into it, but Tony pulls away.
“You look amazing,” he breathes out before darting forward to press a soft kiss to Steve's lips. “Damn, Iー I had something to say, but you made me dumb, with you looking like that, anyway, hi, sorry I'm late.”
Steve rubs a hand over his belly, grateful that Tony’s shirt still hides the slight roundness. Natasha’s been teaching him yoga, so he’s taken to wearing the stretchy pants around the tower. Thankfully, Clint and Natasha have both been helping with distracting anyone else who might notice when Steve has to rush out of the kitchen at the waves of nausea; poor Bruce looked hurt when Steve hurried away from the table without eating a bite of the spicy curry he usually loves. He doesn’t know what excuse the SHIELD agents gave, but he’d apologised to Bruce the next day.
Steve forces himself to take a steadying breath, closes out of the text thread, and puts his phone on the bed next to him. He tries to pay attention to the show as Kimmy gets insulted once more by Stephanie, but his mind keeps circling back to Tony’s words. He glances over at Natasha and smiles to himself when he sees how casually close she and Sam are sitting on their bed; he decides to spend the night thinking about what Tony said without bringing it up to the others until he’s made a decision.
“There is, unfortunately, well, your butt is not unfortunate, god, your ass is amazing, but in this case, the but
Steve chuckles at the kissy-face emoji attached to the end of the text and sends back four of the emojis and a heart-eyes one.
“No, don’t be stupid. I’m asking you to say yes when I ask you in six months to marry me. We’re, hm… We’re engaged to be engaged, if you will.”
Tony glances up from the schematics in front of him. Steve stands in the doorway to the workshop, his hands clutching the tablet Tony gave him the second he began living in the tower; on the blond’s face is an expression of pure determination, supported by the fact his jaw is set, shoulders back. Tony raises an eyebrow but nods his assent.
“'Tis true,” Thor chuckles as he follows Tony to a workbench. “So my dear Jane has informed me that you wished to speak to me of a rather important topic.”
It takes a month of feeling like he’s made progress only to be pushed away for Steve to finally reach his wit’s end. He paces his quarters for hours every day during the week that Tony is at some business conference; he practises what he’s going to say whenever he sees Tony again. His mind races the entire time, and the mark on his chest seems to throb with the knowledge of what he’s about to do. Steve had been okay with the connection not being complete ー not happy, but fine with it ー but now it’s too much. Being so close to his soulmate, being in love with his soulmate, and his soulmate rejecting it for so long… it’s taken a toll on Steve, and he can’t force himself onto Tony and still be able to live with himself.
” smile. It’s odd to see his own expression on someone else’s face. Coulson returns in minutes, followed by both Nat and Clint. The archer waves good-naturedly then hoists himself up to sit on the countertop. The younger cop gives a half-hearted smile then lets his partner speak.
Loki helps Steve to his feet but allows Tony to lead the group to the couch. Steve’s head is spinning by the time he collapses to the cushion, wrapped tightly in Tony’s arms. Silence falls on the workshop, but it’s short-lived, cut off by a series of beeping and whining. Steve pulls his head away from Tony’s chest to see Dum-E staring at him; Tony snorts a laugh when the bot’s claw reaches out to pull the neck of Steve’s shirt more snugly on his shoulder. Another bout of beeps sounds, and Steve cocks his head as he realises the noises have an inquisitive note to them.
She doesn’t speak, merely steps onto the treadmill next to his and starts it up. Steve tries not to give in, knows it’s what her silence is designed for, to force someone to give answers by making them feel overwhelmingly uncomfortable. The rational portion of his brain knows this. Unfortunately, his tongue has other plans.
“You’d tell Rhodey or Pepper, and they’d nag you until you gave in and told me,” chuckles Steve as he rolls to face Tony.
“Steve wasn’t even mad that you weren’t there. Pepper called and explained what was going on, so he was okay with doing it alone. Well, without you, anyway, he wasn’t alone – Sam and I went with him. Would he have preferred you were by his side? Yes. Did he want to punch whoever screwed up in R&D, in the face? Yes. But he was
Steve keeps that phrase looping in his brain like a mantra as he rifles through the fridge for breakfast; he isn't really hungry, his appetite is gone in the aftermath of the dream, but he knows everyone needs to eat, to keep their strength up. Sam helps plate the food and set the table, and asks that JARVIS alert the others to the meal. Tony and Rhodes are the first to amble back into the kitchen, Tony talking a mile a minute, and Steve knows it's for Rhodes's benefit, to help keep his mind off of the situation. Bruce is next, his focus intently on a tablet, but he sets it aside in order to eat. Coulson, Clint, and Natasha come in as a group, all three silent.
The words are said nonchalantly, but he has the air of a man both uncomfortable and uneasy with whatever answer he might receive. The four-year-old, however, stares up at Steve with wide, pleading eyes. Steve finds he cannot say no; he drags his gaze from Peter's hopeful face to his father's.
The secluded diner is tucked nearly in between an office building and a craft store, its sign plainly stating the name – black serif font against a wash of white. The door is situated in the middle of two large windows; the bright red sign hanging from the glass cheerily announces the establishment is open. A bell dings as Steve steps inside, and a waitress at the counter smiles. He forces a grin in response before turning his focus on finding Tony. There are only two people sitting in the dining area, neither of whom is the man he's looking for. With a check of the time (12:19), Steve weaves his way through the tables toward a booth in the back and settles in to wait, pulling out the sketches of his newest comic character to work on.
“Let me finish. Even if I wanted kids, I couldn’t do it. I would be the worst kind of father. I’d never be there for important events; I’d basically be a fucking ghost, because I’d never be home, and if I was, I’d still be too damn busy to spend any time with the kid. I’d… I would be Howard, Steve. And I refuse, flat-out refuse, to inflict that kind of pain on an innocent child.”
“The situation with the Winter Soldier, also known as James Barnes, is a complex one, you must admit, Captain Rogers,” one of them says, leaning forward in his seat to pin Steve with a steady stare. “But, given that you and the rest of your team have come up with a viable plan, I suppose there will be no harm in allowing this. However, do keep in mind that we will be watching very, very closely.”
He half expects the faceplate to pop open but isn’t surprised when it doesn’t. The brilliant blue-white of the eyes and arc reactor is achingly familiar. Steve’s fingers burn with the desire to draw them. He keeps himself from running his fingertips over the glossy paint of the suit, though it takes much more effort than he would have ever anticipated. Finally, Tony speaks, voice even and made mechanical by the suit.
Sam returns five minutes later with their drinks and fruit-and-cream-cheese danishes. They sit quietly, eating without speaking; a few people stop, ask Sam for autographs and pictures. No one pays attention to the pregnant blonde with him, and Steve is thankful for that. He normally doesn’t mind conversations, but he’s exhausted. He hadn’t even really wanted to come out today – staying home and napping sounded like a better plan – but he'd let himself be convinced that going out was a good idea, even with his swelling ankles and sudden inability to cope with the humidity of summer in New York. So here he is, sitting in the July heat with one of his best friends as they attempt to spend time together in peace.
“Here. As soon as I left last night, I came straight home and watched movies until the team came stumbling in at three.”
Steve explains Natasha’s reasoning, and Tony has to agree that she had a point. He kisses Steve again then rolls out of bed, grabbing a pair of sweats and a t-shirt from the dresser; after tossing the clothes to his lover, he picks out a pair of boxer-briefs and a tank top. He pulls them on quickly. The teddy is on the floor by the time Tony turns back toward the bed, and Steve is curled up on his side, dressed and covered with the comforter. Tony slides under the blanket behind Steve, pressing close, and sighs contentedly.
Tony is out of bed before the sun peeks over the horizon the next morning, heading out the door with a quick apology for not being able to stay talk to Thor’s mother. Steve selfishly monopolises more of his time in the communal kitchen before his partner can fully leave. Unfortunately, JARVIS can prevent people from walking into the occupied room, but the AI can’t stop Pepper Potts from calling Tony’s phone while his cock is buried in Steve’s mouth. Steve finds himself hating the fact the woman has the override codes, even as he finishes swallowing and wipes at his lips and chin to remove any evidence. Tony gives him an apologetic smile, lingering kiss, and fervent
She leads him to a small café and gestures toward a seat. A barista appears to know her and what she likes, because there's a large cup of steaming coffee in front of her in less than two minutes. Ms Potts takes a sip before catching his eye.
. The sound of a rapid heartbeat begin to play, and Steve leans against Tony, feeling at peace for the first time in days. They stare at the sonogram without speaking for a few minutes.
Steve laughs outright when his palm is licked where it rests over his partner’s mouth. “JARVIS, please don't.”
, Steve thinks, and the words sound slightly hysterical even to himself. From the corner of his eye, he can see Tony watching him closely. Steve ignores him, too busy taking in the words on the screen, too busy feeling like maybe they can get through this together and in one piece. For the first time since he woke up this morning, Steve feels like he can actually breathe again and that the team will still be a team, a
when it hits the edge of the coffee-table then the dark wooden floor. The tightness in his chest makes it hard to breathe; he struggles to draw in enough oxygen. His brain feels fuzzy as if his thoughts are refusing to be contained and examined, and his pulse pounds in his ears. The only thing that’s clear is the mental image of the arc reactor that powers the Iron Man suit, the one that keeps Tony alive.
“I wish you’d told me this earlier. Any of us, actually.” Steve sighs, pulls his hand away. “I’m sorry.”
on the front and makes his way out to the living room. Tony glances up from the tablet in his hands, smiling.
Nothing about this is similar to when Steve lost his virginity at the age of seventeen to some girl Bucky had convinced to go on one date with Steve. That was nothing more than an inebriated pity fuck ー she'd been complaining all evening to her friend about Steve's stature, the way he was mostly distant the entire time. They had followed Bucky and Dot to a house party a few blocks away, and somehow, they'd ended up in the parents’ bedroom, fumbling on top of the blankets in the dark. She complained when they were finished about how bony he was but said
Tony mimes zipping his lips together and throwing away the key. A ghost of a smile flickers across Steve's face, but it's here and gone in seconds, almost too quick for Tony to see, but he watches Steve too much to not notice any change in his facial expressions. Steve sighs, his hand reaching out and gently picking up one of Tony's.
Steve sighs, nods. He knows Tony is right – on all aspects. But Steve can’t help but worry about possible repercussions. He slowly falls asleep to the sound of Tony breathing and the movement of their daughter.
"It'll be fine,” Tony says, but Steve can tell he doesn't believe himself; this is a situation that's far beyond the realm of known, and they're both wandering blind. But he appreciates that Tony’s trying to comfort him.
, no matter what you bring to the table. I'd be content if you were nothing more than a, a shop owner who catered to sexually-active pygmy goats.”
Tony thinks with a sigh, pressing the heels of his palms against his eyes. He orders JARVIS to tell Steve that he’ll be back then leaves the room to find Natasha.
Tony grins shamelessly as the waitress sets their drinks on the table before walking away. “Yep. What else have you noticed?”
Tony feels drunker than he has in such a long time – since before Steve barrelled into his life and made him want to be a better man. He stumbles to the couch used for naps after working so long, he starts hallucinating. His brain is full to the brim of Steve’s disappointed face or, even worse, the expression he wears screams that he had low expectations of success and it turned out he was right. Tony
Tony chokes out a laugh but doesn't say anything in response. Steve hesitates then slowly reaches over, grasps Tony's hand gently in his own. A soft smile plays on his lips when Tony merely holds tighter.
She presses a gentle kiss to his hair on her way out of the conference room. Tony rereads the last few messages from Steve before standing and exiting. He hurries past a group of employees, into the elevator, and through the lobby once he’s on the ground floor. Happy is waiting by the main doors, looking sharp in his black suit, gaze scanning over everyone in sight; he nods at the security guards stationed around the bright lobby before leading Tony from the building. The drive back to the tower is filled only with the sounds of a game on the radio. Once the car is parked in the underground garage, Tony slides out and bids Happy a farewell. He leans against the wall of the lift that will take him inside, sighing.
Steve collapses onto his side, making sure he won’t crush Tony’s body beneath him, and lets out a content sigh. Tony turns his head and peers blearily at Steve, dark eyes glazed from exhaustion and orgasm. A chuckle works its way from Steve’s chest as he stretches to press a soft kiss to his lover’s bare shoulder.
; he decides to push his luck, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. To his immense surprise, she allows it, even leans into his side. They sit in silence like that, staring down at the city and its inhabitants.
He stares at the innocent sign hanging on the glass door to SHIELD Comics and Photography. The letters don't magically rearrange themselves before his eyes; he drags a hand over his face, turns toward home.
Noon finds Steve walking out the door of SHIELD, pacing the parking lot two, three, four times before he makes up his mind. He's grateful that it isn't too hot outside as he makes his way down the sidewalk; he doesn't want to arrive sweaty, red-faced, and stinking.
“That is best left to Mother.” Thor stands, claps a hand to Steve’s shoulder, and heads toward the door. “I shall go speak with her now, so that a plan can be put into place.”
The hardwood floor has been covered with plush white carpeting; two of the walls, once a bland beige, are now a calming shade of blue, pale as the sky on a sunny day. A beautiful, glossy oak crib sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by boxes of diapers and wipes and shopping bags, and a matching changing table is close by. Glow-in-the-dark plastic stars dot the ceiling in the shape of easily recognisable constellations. He turns to see Steve smiling sheepishly, while a face mask hangs from its elastic strap around his neck. Tony manoeuvres around the furniture, kissing Steve as soon as he’s close enough. That’s when he notices the third wall.
doesn’t seem to be enough, but anything else would be too much to discuss in text messages. In the end, he settles for something to the point.
“Welcome to the club. But, for what it’s worth, I think you’re doing great. So you’ve left a few knives out
“I'm… I'm glad you and Tony are still friends,” he admits, smiling at the way Tony's fingers close around his wrist. “I don't think Peter would be as well-adjusted if you weren't. He’s a great kid, smart as Hell, but if you and Tony weren’t so close, I doubt he’d be so confident.”
Steve clambered up onto the bed, crawled across the surface until his head hit something hard with an audible thump. Tony clung to his knee, hissing in pain, then the boys sat together for a while until, without warning, the scenery changed and they were in a bright garden, full of colourful flowers and buzzing bees and flittering butterflies. Tony plopped onto a bench, patted the seat beside him, and waited until Steve sat down, to relax. They spent the next however long watching insects floating from flower to flower, the sun beaming down and warming their little area. Neither boy minded they were in their pyjamas, though Tony’s were much more expensive and uncomfortable-looking than Steve’s. They usually were.
That melts Steve's heart. All humour he feels drains away rapidly, and he inhales shakily, leaning down to press a kiss to Peter's forehead. His throat is tight, aching. With a soft sigh, Steve holds onto the kid's hand, so tiny in his own.
Phil ruffles Peter's curls before standing and catching Steve's eyes. He jerks his chin toward the hallway, and Steve nods, closing his comic book and rising to his feet. He stops by Kate's chair, asking her in an undertone to keep an eye on Peter; she agrees readily, so Steve follows Phil into the corridor.
He pulls his phone from his pocket, thumbs open the picture gallery, and shoves it toward them. Pepper grabs it before anyone else can; he stands there and basks in the glorious sounds of his family cooing over the newest addition. Thor, Sam, and Pepper are misty-eyed as they scroll through the photographs he’d snapped of his daughter as she slept peacefully in his arms. Coulson shakes Tony’s hand, congratulating him, and Clint surprises Tony by pulling him roughly into a tight hug before disappearing. Sam and Thor follow close behind. Pepper wraps her arms around Tony’s neck.
"It's only been a couple months." Tony cupped Steve's face in his hands, pressed a gentle kiss to the blond's forehead. "Let's go talk to Thor and the others before we throw in the towel."
of the bass sends vibrations up his spine, and Steve makes a face at the energetic synth that’s blaring from the speakers in the photography wing. He can see Natasha and Sam sitting in comfortable chairs off to the side; neither of them looks up at him, but Steve didn’t really expect them to notice his presence – not with the loud music and the fact that they’re both focused so intently on each other. Coulson stands behind the camera, silently snapping picture after picture as Bucky poses without direction. The effortless movements seem so natural, are a testament to how long he’s worked with Phil that Bucky doesn’t need words to know how the other man wants him to move.
Bucky is already in the office when Steve arrives the next morning. Steve tosses him his keys and beelines for the coffeemaker. He'd fallen asleep around eight, but he tossed and turned all night, waking up at the slightest of sound in the apartment, each time panicking because he could no longer see or hear Peter. It took almost half an hour each time to remind himself that Peter is now with his mother. He'd finally slipped into deep sleep just as the sun was peeking over the horizon; he hadn't even done his morning routine, instead staying in bed until the last possible minute.
He’s still wearing his suit pants and dress shirt, and the pain in his head hasn’t fully disappeared, but Natasha doesn’t seem to care as she kicks his ass from one end of the gym to the other. His body gains a few bruises in just a handful of minutes. While he is clambering to his feet again after a particularly nasty swipe to his legs sent him flying backwards, she speaks; her voice is cold.
Steve chuckles, placing his palm over Tony’s mouth to stop his rambling. “It’s fine. Yes, we trust Phil.”
Steve bites back a sigh. He's tried over the last few months to convince Tony to meet outside of their dreams, but Tony sidesteps each and every invitation with ease, like it's a dance he learned long ago and practises every day. Steve can't deny it hurts, to be so close yet so very far away from each other. His gaze shifts to the scenery outside the window, the skyscrapers touching the sky and disrupting the clouds. He turns his attention back to Tony, who's looking a lot like he wants to run from this conversation and never look back.
