"Can't you feel it?" Cas answers, still quietly, like he's scared he's gonna spook Dean. Good fucking call. Dean’s seen a lot of shit in his life, but he’s pretty damned spooked. "I didn't mean to scare you. I didn't..." he sighs, softly. "I'll explain. But please look at me, Dean. At least give me that much connection."
, and Dean's not dreaming. He's lived such a fucked-up life, but even he can't imagine a nightmare where he cut down the trees for Cas’s pyre and had to prepare his body for it. He sure as hell can’t imagine letting himself dream that something went right after that. Yeah?
Bobby nods along, like the two of them already had this conversation, or like he agrees completely. Or both.
In front of them, Cas carefully moves the cooked pancake off a cast iron pan that’s probably older than Dean and onto a small stack of already completed ones. He dips a ladle smoothly into the big metal bowl next to him and starts a fresh pouring of batter. "I can hear you, you know."
They're reduced to near breathless grunts, working together to—to—fuck. They're definitely fucking. It's slow and intense; Dean's cock has never felt a nicer place than between Cas's thighs and Cas feels perfect in his hand, throbbing and velvety and alive. Dean is willing to rewrite all of existence if he gets to keep this.
Like he's reading Dean's mind, Cas reaches over and links their pinkies together. (Dean wasn't driving left-handed on purpose, it just sort of happened.) "How's Sam?" he asks, softly.
Sam's arms are still freakishly long, and since Dean (probably) isn't gonna punch him in the Novak living room or toss him over the back of the sofa, he doesn't fight Sam for it too hard when Sam holds it away.
Jimmy murmurs understanding noises and Dean thinks he's a better man than Dean is. That, or he'll get mad once the drugs and adrenaline wear off.
Cas climbs back onto the bed, but Dean shifts so Cas can't just resume making Dean's brain explode one careful kiss at a time. Dean absolutely needs to get his hands all over Cas, right the fuck now.
It would probably bother him more if he hadn't dreamed of kicking Uriel in his heavenly nuts more than once.
Cas shrugs a little. “I… it’s complicated. I liked the… sensations, the stimulation? But mostly only when I was on my own. I still… wanted, I
Yeah, there is a little bottle of clear lube in the corner, and it's definitely nicer, fancier stuff than Dean's ever used.
If Dean's breath was unsteady before, it's practically off the rails now. "Y-yeah," he stutters through a quick nip and lick at the top of his abs. "I sorta got that part."
"Mm, yes. Right there." Cas opens his eyes wider and smiles down at him. His breath is coming in little pants. For that matter, so's Dean's. "Now who's a tease?"
Cas wiggles his hand out in front of him, as if to say 'so-so.' "We've been looking into location spells, but Lilith is more than likely hidden from anything novice practitioners like us might come up with."
The hot tears sting painfully as they come down, and Dean's just going to spend a long time with red eyes. Fuck. He takes a few deliberate deep breaths, straightens his shoulders and wipes the tears away with his fingers. Enough. That’s enough. "Okay." He shakes out his shoulders. "Okay. Time to get to work. Gotta see you on your way."
The next thing Dean knows, he, Sam, Baby, their bags and Cas are standing at the side of a dark, deserted road. Cas falters and then uses the side of the car to keep standing. "Oh. That… was a lot," he rasps, and his knees buckle under him.
Cas steps up next to him, calm and still on the surface, but underneath, full of pent-up energy that Dean can feel vibrating between them even though they’re not touching. "That was our assumption, yes," he agrees, coldly, but he doesn’t take his eyes off Michael. His left hand comes up and rests on the small of Dean’s back.
"What?" Sam finally asks, into the silence, as the judgemental sneer slides the rest of the way away. Some of this information isn’t new to Sam, but it’s like he hasn’t even thought about it since Cas told them exactly how it all happened over a pile of poorly-written novel drafts. It’s like the anger and resentment has clouded really specific memories in Sam’s brain.
It's stupid that even just one joke from Cas can get him forgetting that they're rocketing at light speed towards the end of the world. But it does.
Dean doesn't remember laughing this much before, during, or after sex in a long time. It's a good feeling.
But he doesn't have the energy to have it out, either—not when fucking traffic made them miss Sam, and he has no idea if resting his eyes for even these four hours will put them so far behind that Sam...
They smile at each other across the mattress, and Dean realizes that it's the first time in his life he's done this: made up someone's bed with them, got ready to share it with them. He was just never around long enough to deal with that kind of thing.
"She could escape," Dean says. "Just... you know. Toss the grace to the wind and go all Free Willy. You did."
Jesus Christ, Jesus fucking Christ, Dean's never going to get over the sight of that. Sammy gives him a panicked look, though, hauled out over his shoulder. Wait. Didn't Cas say—
The excuse that it was a lean couple of months sort of stings on the tip of Dean’s tongue, but he doesn’t let the lie out. He shakes his head. “I’m okay. Better, now.” And that, that’s the truth. “The marks… where do you put ‘em?”
Sam's got a strange tone to his voice when he answers the phone, and Dean doesn't know what to make of it. It’s almost like an echo? Maybe it’s the signal. His little brother sounds happy that Dean's safe, but... weirded-out, too? Dean's not exactly sure how much to tell him, either. Especially since he can hear Ruby in the background.
Now that Dean's come, the urgency and edge is off, but his head is still spinning at how good that was. His hand has kept moving, though, tight and fast, concentrating the press of his thumb against the thick, wet band up Cas's underside. He's definitely pulsing in Dean's hand.
"Off," Dean demands, laughing. "Just 'cause I didn't rebuild you or whatever doesn't mean I don't wanna get a good look."
He feels good; he always does, on the rare occasions when he and Cas spend the night together. The nightmares are held at bay and Dean seems to find some sort of new level of relaxation that makes sleep extra-restful. It's apparently not just the awesome sex though, which is kinda nice.
The fingertip inside him doesn't feel like he thought it might. It doesn’t hurt at all, for one thing. Dean's aware of it, but the tiny little gliding motions, in and out, spark right at the edges. It makes the thrust back almost better than the thrust into the tight slick place that is Cas's hand.
Anna keeps smiling at Cas, but it’s small, and it doesn't make it through her expression. She's a beautiful, cold statue. Dean can't imagine how, in another time or another universe, he ever slept with her without getting frostbite. Yeesh. "It's time to come home, Castiel,” she informs him, gently. “You can, you know. All will be forgiven."
Cas kisses him again, full throttle, 100% tongue and teeth and the slow beginning burn of arousal. Dean can't do much of anything but hold on as Cas's free hand roams, running down Dean's side, across Dean's ribs, down to the small of his back, rubbing circles that should be soothing. Instead, those little rings of gentle touch are practically sparking right down Dean’s tailbone to criss-cross at his dick, which is getting really fucking interested in the proceedings.
, sleeping. He's torn between making this easier on Sam and… really not. On the one hand, the kid's had kind of a tough year; on the other, what on Earth did he think the rings meant?
"Uh-huh," Dean agrees, but he doesn't raise his head. They're both sticky, naked, and covered in come, but Dean's pretty sure his legs won't hold him if he tries to get up to grab a washcloth.
Jimmy, unlike Sam, softens a little bit. He's still glaring at Dean, though. "He put you in harm's way, Cassie. He's still putting you in harm's way."
Cas doesn't have to ask though, Dean realizes. Dean’s more than happy to give him this. In front of Bobby or not.
"Cas, Cas," he chokes out, craning his neck back upwards and lifting back up on his elbow. The tip upwards of Cas's gaze, meeting his, almost undoes him right there. "Sweetheart, I'm gonna, I'm—"
Cas’s eyes go darker. A muscle ticks at the corner of his jaw. He doesn’t look away. Dean thinks this might be the first time he’s ever seen Cas really angry.
Dean snorts, and just like that, he’s not as nervous anymore. And that's how Dean finds himself with a front full of naked Cas, fuck, yeah. Cas sighs indulgently as Dean slowly eases his fingers down between two pert and firm cheeks to press oh-so-gently against soft, crinkly skin.
Castiel smiles, and just like that, the fog of a bad night's sleep lifts. "You're more than welcome," he answers, softly.
Dean laughs softly, the unfamiliar tentativeness leaving his face, and with their chests pressed together--their legs still entangled--Castiel feels the tremor of it through his whole body. "Nerd," Dean murmurs. It comes with a kiss.
Jimmy makes a sudden lunging movement—so jerky that Dean's hand automatically slaps to his Colt. Cas starts a little, but just a little.
"Oh, please," Bobby says, before crossing the lines into the devil's trap. "Like you don't get exactly what you want out of this. There ain't an altruistic bone in your stolen body."
He ends up getting kissed all over. Cas spends long seconds going from muscle to muscle, even in the spots that Dean natural fitness doesn't translate to specific muscle definition. For Cas it doesn't seem to matter: it’s like he knows where each bit of Dean's body begins and ends, and he unerringly, softly, says hello to each one. When it's Dean's turn, he'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way, relying on the mesmerizing dips and curves of Cas's alarmingly tempting stomach and hips. Maybe spend a little more time biting those hipbones...
Dean ultimately has no idea which of them comes first, because whichever one of them it is, he drags the other one down with him so close behind that it really doesn't matter. And the feel of both of their cocks pulsing together in the grip of his hand, the echo of every clench and pull in his pelvis ricocheting into his gut and being answered by a hot jet onto his belly, is just, it's impossibly good. Dean can feel Cas's come slipping right onto the head of his own cock, the mix of their come making the tunnel of his hand even more slippery as neither of them stops moving.
Most people don’t just come out with it like that, especially around these parts. Even Jimmy seems to think that’s a new brand of crazy coming from his brother, because he twists towards Cas: his eyebrows just hit his hairline and his mouth is hanging open.
"I remember him better, now," Cas says, a little soothingly. "He's never liked humans much. He... prefers everything to be in its place, and humans—
There's a rustling from a small pile of wood and old pews that looks like someone tried to build a makeshift snow-fort in the corner. A second voice he doesn't know hisses, "Cassie!"
Dean's coming so hard that his breath locks in his throat on a cry of Cas's name that would have shaken Baby's solid frame.
But his hand tightens just gently in Cas's hair, holding him against the spot, and his other hand tucks up against the small of Cas's bare back, keeping him from going anywhere. Nope. Cas is going nowhere at all.
But that's fine, Dean also has a list. He'll get to slowly strip Cas out of his clothes, kissing and licking inch by inch, sometime later. For now, he tugs the soft cotton of the pants and boxers down in one sharp motion until all that's left is Cas, naked and hard and waiting for him.
Dean's orgasm explodes through him in the middle of a third grinding roll and for a long moment, there’s nothing but heat and grip, the blue of Cas watching him, and the way his own breath is seizing in his throat as he empties himself into Cas again and again and again.
Dean reaches up and out, and, like he can't help himself, smooths a lock of hair that's sticking horizontally out behind Castiel's ear.
Cas smiles, looking pleased. "The thing about erections," how does he make that word sound hot? "Is that they're pretty easy to please most times." He opens the bottle and squeezes some lube into his hand. "Someplace slick," he wraps his hand unceremoniously around Dean's dick and gives it two or three glorious slides of slick palm—just enough to renew the buzzing under Dean's skin. "Someplace warm," Dean almost whines when Cas lets go of his cock, but Cas squeezes some more lube out and then, in what has to be the most elegant, awkward motion, spreads his legs to reach his own thighs. "And someplace tight. Given all three, and the rest? Will follow along presently."
But when Dean turns, Cas has the shining vial in his hand. His eyes are on Dean’s when he breaks it open.
"Of course, Dean," Cas murmurs, and kisses the shoulder. Dean shudders; his toes curl in his boots and his dick gets just that little bit harder.
Dean automatically takes the gun and checks it over. Ziplock versus fancy cloth wasn't actually what Dean was worried about, but okay, that's weird too. "What are they?"
Doesn't make Dean feel any less shitty about it. Hell, if anything, that probably makes it worse. It's almost a relief when Sam digs out the kicker that the guy's spent 9 big Gs for some 'adult entertainment' at a nudie bar.
So when Cas, after a few more teasing little nuzzles, mouths and coaxes Dean's cock out of the slit of his boxers without even using his
He wants. Fuck, he wants so much. He wants everything. Cas's ear is just as close as his own is to Cas's mouth, their bodies molding together in amazing little rolls. Dean traces the curve of Cas’s earlobe with his lips, and tells him, "Show me?"
There's a change in their movements; a certain sort of intent starts to bleed in, like the difference between 'this feels amazing' and 'holy fuck, I need to come'. It's delirious. Dean is never going to be the same again and he doesn't care one bit.
There's no possible answer to that that's not kind of insulting. But to be honest, Dean's more used to thinking of Cas as the kind of guy who nerds out with Sam and Bobby at the table over verb declensions and spent a good ten minutes lovingly describing an illuminated manuscript than, y'know, leading an army, so,
Dean blinks at their hands, at where there’s now a full, but compact, plastic bottle wedged between their palms. "Buddy, did you mojo the lube?" he asks, incredulous but laughing.
They both go down in a heap, and the pain of Dean's elbow slamming into a work bench almost jars him into thinking he's sane.
"Yeah, how?" he grumbles, but he settles a hand on Cas's back and starts it creeping downwards, towards that fucking fantastic ass of his. Just to pet. Even though it is all covered-up; isn’t that a crime?
Remember how we promised smoosh after all that plot? Well, smoosh ahoy! This chapter also contains one of my favorite scenes in this story... <3
Cas doesn't say that he understands. Dean knows that he does. Maybe before he'd lived his human life, he might not have—but this Cas, this angel next to him with a twin brother who helped break him out of an asylum, he does.
Dean looks away. "Look, the venom was only in my system for like thirty seconds. Maybe it takes a minute to really kick in?"
But he understands, now. Not Dean--he doesn't think he'll ever understand Dean. But why it's important to walk away from things that he wants.
Dean scratches hard at the side of his neck. "Bobby, an angel dropped in on us yesterday. Anna." He looks at Cas. They can tell Bobby the rest of it later. "You're not warded.” Couldn’t be: Cas definitely didn’t have the mojo for it when they were inside Bobby’s wards. They’re not even sure that he has the grace to go that deep anymore even with Dean giving him a recharge. “The angels might be able to track you. And they know..."
But she doesn't try to kiss him or anything, and Dean remembers: Cas is her brother-in-law. He was there when she married his twin; he was probably there when her kid was born. She's babbling something about demons, about being afraid, trapped inside her own body. Cas holds her in and, very carefully, strokes her hair, murmuring something in his low gravel.
"Oh. I'm good," Cas says, his voice absolutely wrecked—and dear God, that's hot. It sends a little shiver through Dean's already wrung-out body. "This was for you." He tucks his head further into Dean's shoulder. Almost... shyly? "Besides I, uh…" He clears his throat nervously. "You were very... inspirational."
Dean turns his attention back to Sam, and smiles back. It's a new kind of smile for Dean, maybe only a year old at most, but the feel of it is something he's fast becoming a fan of.
Yeah, it feels freaking amazing—Cas is tight and hot, slippery with lube and prep, but not tense in a way that would make Dean worry. Fuck, he can see
Sam pops closer once again, squeezes both of their shoulders, and backs away. "I'm really glad to see you guys, Bobby and I are gonna make some food... this is the last meal I'll keep down for a while, we think. You should join us when you can."
"Well," Dean huffs, not looking at all, despite the wall of warmth that's two inches from his side and dressed in his clothing. "Space."
It's the way he says 'please' that sort of kicks Dean's ass in gear, and he stands up and retrieves his knife, opening up one of the cuts on his forearm just enough for blood for the wards. He wards the doors and windows—salts them for good measure. Even the ones in the bathroom, which is actually kind of nice for a place like this.
He rubs his tongue against that one spot just where the head of Cas’s cock meets his shaft, occasionally, but mostly, Dean lets Cas gently rut upwards into his mouth. When he’s got a good mouthful in there, he sucks, and that pulls the sweetest little shocked grunt out of Cas.
Sam's always been better at giving That Talk to the civilians, so Dean's about to leave him to it. But out of the corners of his eyes, Sam looks up and frowns, twisting over his shoulder. "What do you mean? You were the one who drew that sigil."
Then Dean calls the ME and warns her, too. It's not so easy as saying 'my baby brother is drugged up with happy juice, don't trust him, and do go to a stripper place for safety,' but he makes it work.
The next time he bottoms out, it's just this side of controlled, but the angle is somehow better. Cas sucks in a chest full of shocked air. Dean pauses and Cas's leg and hand tighten on him.
Well... it is a specific and random detail, and yeah, Dean told Sam that he went out with that bartender. Except that wasn’t what actually happened.
Dean dreams in small snippets. Bits of Hell, bits of his life, bits of things he wishes were real. Lately Hell has taken a more prominent role, but sometimes… sometimes he gets something nice.
Which is stupid. It's not like Dean can deny that what they already do is sex, because fuck, anything that leaves Dean’s knees wobbly and his brain whited out is definitely
It's fear in her eyes, not panic: she doesn’t know. Dean doesn't know whether to be thankful or pity her.
"'Until the day breaks, and the shadows flee,'" Cas says, and there's enough rhythm to his voice that Dean knows he's quoting something. His lips move in a small, sad smile. "If I were truly interested in protecting you, I should probably have stayed away."
Cas looks a little ashamed now, so Dean puts a hand over his hip and just rubs along the little arc of bone, the softness that sits just above it. Cas ducks his head into Dean's neck, and talks, softly, into his collarbone. "My grace is, as you know... faltering. And a human soul is an incredibly powerful thing—yours, I think, more so than most. As much because of what you have lived through as despite it."
Amelia staggers towards Cas, pulling a shaking little blue-eyed girl behind her and heading towards him like she can't tell the difference between the twins either. She topples into his arms, shaking, sobbing.
Cas casually strokes his cock in one loose, careful hand, kissing with slow, tongued intent. Dean's just about starting to make tiny little abortive thrusts against Cas’s palm when Cas pulls it away. There's a distant click of the bottle and then Cas’s other hand curves against his ass and pulls his cheeks a little apart. What feels like a finger starts a slow careful pressure over his hole.
"He's one of the good guys," Dean promises. "We'll talk about it when the shit's outta your system."
Without those eyes on him, it's not as hard to look away. Dean shifts back to glance at the road. Sam flips to another page of the sketchbook, frowning.
Dean could see the apology of it in Cas's face and the way he didn't look away from Dean's eyes before he was too bright to see anymore. Before he was gone—fractured, burnt up.
When Dean plugs it into the laptop in the closest library they can find with internet access, it takes him nearly an hour to figure out it's a burner number on a just-purchased phone. Dean hopes to God that's Sam's doing.
Dean can't help but stare at Cas in the dimming daylight as they step out into the parking lot. Sunset isn't until after seven, but by five the light quality starts to dip, and it makes Cas into a picture that takes Dean's breath away. As they make the way to the car, the angel inside Cas is nowhere to be seen. He's relaxed and soft around the edges. With his collar open like that, he seems vulnerable, but in a good way.
Dean lets his head drop onto his angel's shoulder, feeling lighter than he's felt through most of the evening. And laughs.
The pressure behind his balls, the sparks of tickle-not-tickle as Cas's fingertip rubs tiny circles over Dean's hole through his boxers, the deliberate pull of suction, are, together, fucking impossible to resist. It's so good that Dean almost doesn't manage to get the words out in a way that a human being might be able to understand.
against the inside of his breastbone, but there's something that's almost... he'd fucking swear he's seen that expression before, but... "I'm pretty sure I led their garrison. Before. In... in another life."
Dean reaches out before he can help himself, and touches the skin right to the side of it. "They got you," he says, hoarsely. "Shit."
It's gratifying for Dean to find out he knows most of what Cas tells Bobby. The exceptions are the kinds of things there hasn't been time for—like the hilarious shit twin brothers can get up to when other people think they're nearly identical. Turns out Jimmy can imitate Cas's voice, and vice versa.
Even though Dean's not looking at Cas, he can feel the guy turning, looking at him—that stare that's more than a stare, that feels like a finger on the side of his face. "I'm not sure," he says, finally, after too long a pause.
He still grabs on and snatches another kiss from Cas's lips. This little glen’s not parkland, no one’s likely to come across them, but he sees where Cas is coming from. "Not into fooling around in public?" Dean teases, running a hand down Cas's thigh. Not that
(Okay, so Jimmy's look at Dean when Dean admitted he's just got a GED, compared to Jimmy's Ph.D-having, angel-winged little brother, might've ticked Dean off just a little bit.)
Dean thinks about that. Is Sam going to go full stop, act like he's really trying to throw Dean off the trail, or is he gonna take it slightly easier? "What was the other one?"
Adam starts to look overwhelmed at the mention of ‘premed,’ and Dean kicks Sam's shin to tell him to back off.
"I suppose," Cas murmurs, "if one were to have an activity they'd like to do on their last night on Earth…" He trails off, looking up at Dean through his lashes.
Cas also looks uncomfortable but, after a long pause, he drops his gaze and nods. He puts the papers in his hands down, leans back against the wall and fidgets with his fingers in a motion so human that it sends a little chill up Dean's back.
Cas snorts—again, slightly higher-pitched than normal. The two angels stare at each other for a long moment that should be throwing literal sparks into the space between them before Cas finally relaxes and steps back, tugging Dean back gently at the elbow.
Dean shrugs. "I'm okay with sharing if you are. And not that shitty weird who-is-better-at-being- miserable competition thing we had going on." His smile crooks up at the corners. "I mean. I tried to get you to just
He's wracked with shivers and slow shudders, Cas pressing soft kisses into the nearest bit of skin he can reach. Even those feel amazing, like a little extra spark of pleasure. Dean can't control the way he’s moving, can't even relax until he comes down somewhat from the high of it—and fuck if that isn't the best high he's ever had.
, but then she asks, politely, "If you have your sword I'd ask that you leave it outside or make it go away. We don't allow weapons around Claire."
Dean tries to move again, but he’s in a motel, now. He’s in Ipswich, Maryland. There’s a truly ugly pattern of diamonds on the wallpaper. The lights are on, and he’s naked. His clothes are scattered where he left them on the floor, but they’re tangled with someone else’s.
Dean isn't wholly sure what he's agreeing to until Cas sits back on his heels and offers the first aid kit to Dean, then presents his arm to him. It's a weird position for them to be doing this in—Cas kneeling on the floor at Dean's feet. But Dean’s afraid to move too much, afraid that might put them back into the weird demilitarized zone they've been traveling in the past few days—where there's no active hostilities but no warmth to it, either.
Cas raises an eyebrow. "I'm a professor of religious studies. I know," he answers, looking amused, and Dean blushes. "But considering Sam, I was just thinking that might be literal. We should get you back into cell phone range."
"I got nothing to say, Sammy," he says, tiredly. He realizes it's the most he's said since they left the convent. And it's still true.
Cas acknowledges it with a nod. "—or she'll lead you right to the location where Lilith's death will break the world. But either way, she would want you to find Lilith. It behooves her to not mislead you."
Sam nods, slowly. It's like he's heard something like this before, and Dean's a little afraid to think of where. "And now?"
"You, you're, you..." and Dean has no fucking idea where he's going to go with that. Because 'you're the angel God said I was supposed to fuck, and what I got was so much better, so I'm really glad I didn't' is going to go right in pretty much no universe, ever. "You're, uh, an angel. Right?"
Cas nods and takes a small sip, his eyes meeting Dean's over the top of it as those full, dry lips curve over the metal rim. Dean licks his own.
So yeah, even though they are sort of trying to avert the end of the world, their mood's pretty good as they creep into the convent.
Dean's entire body rolls towards him, and the leg tightens around Castiel as Castiel rides the perfectly formed thigh muscle wedged between his legs.
, you wankers have made your bloody point. What?" Crowley snaps, crossing his arms. He never looked that scary to begin with, but all of a sudden, the little guy in a fancy suit with a hairline pulling back from his forehead actually looks... little.
Shower-moist skin against soft cotton is a sensation Dean never appreciated with another person before. Cas is just in boxers under soft pants (borrowed from Dean) and Dean's in boxers and a t-shirt. It's all sensations that add up to something that nearly shorts out Dean’s brain. Dean's hands slide from Cas's hair down his shoulders and sides until he can pull Cas closer. He wants Cas close, so close. He never wants to feel that separation again.
"The handprint," Cas's voice rumbles through Dean as he talks: he's kissing Dean's left pec, biting gently at the swell of the muscle. "It's…" he licks again "… a physical manifestation…" he skips the nipple, already achingly peaked, and noses up Dean's sternum. "…of my grace…"
Shit. He doesn't want to send Sam out there on his own. But Jimmy's useless and still unwarded and bleeding onto the floor, and Cas looks like he couldn't smite a puppy right now. If someone came for Jimmy once, they're gonna do it again.
The conversation peters out after that, and they start to make a list of changes that they catch, for reference later. Once Sam looks sufficiently occupied, Cas slides the pages with Lilith back towards Dean without even a glance in his direction. Dean runs a quick knuckle down the outside of Cas’s closest thigh in thanks.
just what Cas is talking about. "I didn't know why. I still... I'm still not sure why." The hand tightens carefully around his. "But maybe I'm starting to get an idea."
, those lovely little spasms around him, feels like a welcome, like a goddamned invitation, and Dean grinds up into it because he can't
But then there’s a glorious flash of light, and Dean forgets all about that. All about pain, all about thirty years on the rack and ten behind the lash.
Dean has to relax his other hand from where he's gripping the sheets to the side of him—he didn't even realize he was doing that, goddamn. But when he brings it up and gently rubs up and down Cas's side, he can feel that he's tense, balanced, but not... well, Dean knows a little too well what pain looks like. This isn't it.
Dean's leg throbs and reminds him to get sitting as soon as possible. He looks at the sofa and, nope. Edge of the bed it is. It squeaks under him, but no springs poke him in the ass, so there’s a win right there.
The second time, Castiel pauses. "Am... am I not... am I doing something wrong?" he asks, tentatively.
Crowley, though, doesn’t seem shaken up by that. In fact, he even smirks a little, like this is fun for him. "How about some healing?” he offers. “I bet your joints have had a hard life. I can practically smell the arthritis on you. And is that some spinal stenosis?"
"I never really imagined it'd turn out this way," Sam says, quietly. But when Dean looks up, he's got a little smile on, and he’s watching the way the lights on the Christmas tree have started to twinkle; Amelia has them on a timer. "Me hunting with Bobby and you, well."
If Sam were feeling himself, this is where he'd make a crack about knowing that Dean must be under some kind of spell now, if he's actually planning to
"It has a dual purpose," Cas says, and it would look totally serene if not for the amused glitter that's tucking the very corners of his eyes. "It's convenient that way."
Bobby grunts. "Sorta-uh. Low grade concealment-type charm things. If you're gonna be traveling with the likes of him," he gestures with his chin up towards the stairway, "maybe it'll help keep the demons off your asses a little longer."
Cas's gaze comes back to Dean's and really, at this point he should just pull over and let Sam drive. Dean's never getting his concentration back. "I have a… new memory. Something was wrong, very wrong, and I was being hunted. Only I was still injured from our incursion to Hell, and weak from…" he pauses and squints, like he's gazing at the memory though a haze. "From rebuilding a body? I remember being cornered and having all of my options limited."
Cas shakes his head, his eyes closed. Then nods. Then shakes his head again. "I killed her because Anna—the Anna that I knew—was an angel of grace and thoughtfulness and caring. And she would have rather been dead than be a puppet to the death of all that is fair and good." He swallows, and presses his face into Dean's chest. "I'm very sure they sent her thinking I would hesitate before striking. From their point of view, I have been infected with feelings. The worst sort of disease. It’s what makes soldiers question their orders."
Dean goes completely red in the face, but Bobby snorts loudly and grabs the nearest book. "Git. Before I change my mind."
Bobby snorts, but he doesn't comment. He looks up and says... something. Dean doesn't think it's in English. He knows it isn't when Cas replies in the same.
Castiel thinks that the noise he's making is a purr. Or maybe a growl. Or maybe he doesn't care: he has his face buried in Dean's shoulder as they move together, one of his hands clutching against the back of Dean's hip.
Cas sounds amused when he says, "They're done, you can turn back around," so that confirms that Cas did, indeed, look.
"That is related, but not exactly…" Cas trails off. "You were injured. We were injured. Looking back, I'm not sure they wanted me to survive even that long. I think the plan was to kill me, and then continue to ‘rescue’ you, but you… wouldn’t let it happen." Cas runs his hand up Dean's left arm, but stops just shy of the hand print. "You sheltered me from an attack that I was too distracted to see coming. You saved my life, but took an injury, yourself. We clung to each other after that.” He smiles, and it’s pretty obvious it’s a nice, nice memory for him. Huh. “I held your soul inside my being, but you also held my grace in yours. When it was time to set you back into your whole body, it was difficult to separate. You felt like a part of me by then."
"I thought you might be more comfortable talking for a little bit without me there. I can be a wet blanket at the best of times," Cas explains.
Dean snorts, softly. "Maybe don't make it sound like a question next time." But he grins and leans back in.
He thinks back and starts to jot down the hotels that Sam mentioned—hotels, 'cause Ruby doesn't stay at no-tell motels if they can help it, goddammit. All the safehouses and hideyholes. Every town that spilled out of Sam's mouth. And he starts searching.
He finally pulls himself together enough to give a tentative thrust. The pull back curls his toes, and the next push inwards sparks down his spine. It’s not as careful, and he can feel the head of his cock pressing against Cas in the same space his fingers did before. Cas shudders and Dean darts desperate kisses across his shoulders.
"Hopefully you will," Cas answers, raising an eyebrow. He's smiling, though. “You’re the one who’s been accusing me of a vendetta against your clothing, I have to redeem myself somehow.”
Shit, Dean was afraid of that. He pushes Jimmy back down onto the sofa. "Look, buddy, you've had a hell of an afternoon." Sam raided the medicine cabinet, and there's ibuprofen and tylenol. He pushes some of each into Jimmy's hands. "Take this, and rest."
Just as he's about to apologize in advance, his phone rings. It's an unfamiliar number, but it flashes the same area code as their hotel. Dean picks it up, knowing, just knowing it's Sam.
Okay this wasn't the chapter I most anticipated writing, but it has several small moments that I absolutely enjoyed writing. Also hey, MORE PLOT in between the gross, gross romance.
"Thanks," Dean retorts, casually. "But if you have complaints about how the human body works, take it up with your dad. I got a list, too, if he's got his ears on."
Dean scoffs. "Dude, just start talking about Mars or... or Babylon or something and Sammy will be too busy picking your brains to be mad." He's only half-kidding. "How's Anna?"
Dean's never had a male body lying across his before today, not like this. The weight of Cas, how solid he is, feels like a gift even with Cas holding himself a little above. Presumably that's so he doesn't squash Dean, but Dean reaches out both hands and tucks them firmly against Cas's back, pulling his full weight down against his own chest.
There’s a soft bed under his fingertips, sheets that are clean and smooth, a warm blanket over his legs. He’s cold, but it’s not the empty chill he’s started to become used to. There’s something missing, but he’s too tired to figure out what. The pull of warm sleep is so strong and Dean thinks nothing of curling harder into… into…
Dean knows the feeling. Cas doesn't need to say 'This is my fault' or 'she's my friend' because it's all over his shoulders. He only hesitates for a second before slowly lowering himself to the armrest. He makes sure it'll support his weight—it does—before settling a hand at the back of Cas's neck.
Jimmy's still not laughing, though. (Dean's reserving opinion on the fuddy duddy thing.) He continues, in the same mutter, "You know, the doctors always did call you the family miracle."
It's after Claire goes up to bed—complaining the whole way that she's not tired, and having to be escorted by both her parents—that Sam asks Adam about the things Dean's been contemplating, too.
Dean's throat clicks as he clears his throat twice, then mumbles, "Uh... you, um. Maybe wanna share?" and nudges the edge of the blanket over Castiel's thigh.
Cas's leg remains pressed against his, but there's a sort of an achy sorrow that's coming from him that hurts Dean's stomach. There's no outward change beyond Cas's shoulders being a little more rounded or his face a little more shadowed.
Not so much as a ‘hello,’ this time. Dean doesn’t even need it. He does wonder, briefly, why Cas has come to visit now, but a wave of tired anxiety with a side of frustration hits Dean, and he can take some educated guesses.
Dean can't look away. He watches Cas jerking on top of him with light flashing under his eyelids, crying out in a thick, raspy moan that fills the whole car. The sound echoes inside Dean, and it coaxes another helpless spurt out of Dean's dick in a hot dribble.
"He wasn't," Cas says, with the force of a knife twisting. His eyes flash. "And any attempts to hypnotize me were not that, Jimmy, I told you that." His gaze flicks to Ruby, and his lips arch downwards with distaste. “But no one would have believed me if I told them he was a monster beyond sin or redemption, either.”
Bobby stays quiet. The bastard always knew how to do that. Dean cracks quickly. Maybe he just wants to tell someone.
"I can't find you." Cas doesn't sound panicked, but he sounds worried. Maybe a little scared. "You felt... upset. Heartsick. And then I couldn't find you..."
Dean can't even argue with that description of Inias, that's exactly how Dean thought of him, too. Sam's still pounding thinly on the closed door. Dean sighs and jerks his chin in the direction of the stairs. "I need beer for this."
"I'm glad I found you. Or that you found me," Cas tells him. It sounds like he's saying goodbye. Dean's just about to go off on him about that—no, nope, no fucking way—when Cas's hand strays upwards and touches his forearm. There's no reason a little squeeze should feel like that through Dean's jacket and flannel. "But... may I... can I ask a favor?"
Cas nods, smiling sadly. "We two are so entwined now; hiding an angelic presence within that isn't difficult at all. The hex bags from Bobby are more than enough, on top of my own personal warding."
After a moment, Dean chuckles. It's really his brain being so loose and warm and his whole body feeling good that let the words slip out. "So, uh... so when's it my turn?"
Cas follows him out after a quick nod to Anna. Dean is just about to do the same when he pauses. He waits for Cas to be out of human earshot—though really, he'll probably hear it anyway—and leans down towards Anna.
"Oh. Well, I don't think I'm into that," Cas answers, still serious as hell. "But if you are, we can negotiate."
What would have happened if Dean hadn't gotten this back? Would he have just forgotten? Or would he just never have known?
Dean presses back instinctively, nerve endings firing pleasantly. He doesn’t know when he closed his eyes, but he’s just fine with that.
He slides his finger a little further in, just enough to create a tiny thrusting movement. Cas's lips lose coordination and he moans, burying his head in that spot between Dean's neck and shoulder. "God, I forgot that could feel so good," he husks, clutching Dean closer to him. His hands flex on Dean’s shoulders.
Sam collapses to his knees like a doll with his strings cut. He's fine: he’s breathing, and his eyes are open. It just looks like the worst instant hangover.
Tessa's head tilts in confusion, her brow furrowing slightly. "No. There's definitely an angel on your shoulder, Dean." She reaches out and brushes his sleeve with the tips of her fingers.
Cas is more than a little hard on top of him. And not that rubbing off against him in Baby wasn't nice, but like Cas said—Dean's willing to be trouble even if Cas is being all sweet and respectful.
But Dean knows it's not the bleeding that gets you, in these situations. It's the damage to the organs; it's the spillage, the contamination inside the belly. But that doesn't keep him from opening up the shirt, grabbing a wad of cloth and having Jimmy hold pressure, because it makes them all feel like they're doing something. "Hey, hey,” Dean says. “You'll be okay."
He’s white through the lips and trembling with the effort and Dean knows he's just about out of juice, even with Dean's help, when he finally stops.
Carefully, Dean wipes it down with antiseptic, then spreads ointment on the edges and layers it down with gauze and their good medical tape. He thinks it might be closing even as he puts down the final strip. But he takes his time doing it, anyway, because if Cas needs Dean to touch him to refill his grace, then Dean's just going to keep doing it. He skims his fingertips down that lean forearm.
The nervousness is mostly gone now, burned away by the perfect hitch of Cas's chest and the incomparable grip of Cas's body.
. And not only is it sex, it's the best sex Dean's had in his life—over and over again. But a hand on him is familiar; a mouth sliding up and down on his cock is something he knows.
Cas laughs and that expanding feeling inside Dean's chest is back, warm and light. He never thought he'd hear Cas laugh again. "One might say," Cas says between chuckles, "it is a kissing story, but with swashbucklers. I suspect you'll enjoy it."
Dean meets Cas's eyes. He knows that they both want more than a shoulder clap, and that knowledge has to be enough for now. Their pinkies brush as they walk past each other, like tiny magnets that just can't stop reaching. It's soothing in a way that also leaves a tiny ache in Dean's chest when Cas flaps off.
That's what faith looks like, Dean thinks. And he really doesn't have the first damned idea what to do to live up to that faith, and it’s fucking terrifying. But he knows he wants to try.
"Mostly just curious," Dean comments, letting his eyes close because he's only got enough energy to talk or see, not both.
Bobby grunts, but he checks the contents of the box anyway, popping a hush puppy into his mouth. He makes a rumble of pleasure. "Was all that supposed to be a hint, a threat, or a warning?" he asks. He takes a chicken wing, too.
Sam looks a little flustered, and he seems to be searching for the right objection that won't piss Dean off. "But… he's an angel?" is what he settles on.
"Oh, Christ," Dean whispers. Has he seen Cas do that before? He's got no idea. Shit, that's unbelievably hot. "That how you like to be touched?"
Cas looks down at the trench coat he's still wrapped in, the flannel, the undershirt he has on underneath it, Dean's jeans on his legs. He looks back up at Dean, and bats dark eyelashes. "You're nicer to look at?"
For a second, Dean's so caught up in the idea of Cas losing it that he forgets why Cas might be shaking his shoulder like that.
Cas smiles and folds a few more items, his chin tilted in thought. "I enjoyed teaching, but hated every other part of the job... though, according to my colleagues, that wasn't unusual. I supervised six PhD candidates, and learned something I cherish from every one of them."
"Free will, sister," Cas says, quietly. "It's more than simply a quirk of humanity left there to annoy us. It's about choice regardless of circumstance, and sometimes, even regardless of consequence. Heaven would tell us that one wrong move taints us for the rest of eternity; humanity would tell us to learn from it, and do better next time. I rather prefer the latter."
The thick-shouldered middle-aged guy who’s holding Dean up against a wall and who Dean shouldn't have been able to move with a
"It's an Enochian chant that was meant for Lucifer and those who followed him. I'm fairly sure my former brethren made sure no human book kept the knowledge of it, if it was ever even committed to written word. But Lilith is the first demon? She was Lucifer’s, first: she spoke Enochian. She would definitely remember a time when the knowledge was more widespread." Cas looks tired—no, Cas looks half-dead, and the other half exhausted. It's not a good look for him. Dean got most of the blood off his face before Cas opened his eyes and scared the shit out of him, but the bruising still looks painful. He can't even begin to imagine how the rest of Cas's body feels.
Dean laughs and drops his head. Fine. It's not like he doesn't want to wrap Cas up into that dorky trench coat of his and handcuff them together anyway.
Dean's eyes close involuntarily. He's so tired. He's been so tired, but Cas makes him feel safe enough to feel it. "I don't suppose you have a plan?"
Cas looks up from where he's inspecting the edge of his angel blade. His eyes are dark with sympathy. Maybe he gets it, too.
"What kind of help do you need?" Sam asks. "To, you know... um, not be dead. Come back from the dead?" He smiles, crooked and rueful and so familiar that it makes Dean twinge with missing him, even though he's right here. "We, uh, the three of us kind of have a lot of experience with that.”
Dean makes it to the table, inches from Cas, but it takes longer to unclench his fist and reach out. Cas keeps looking at him like he thinks Dean is going to disappear into mist, when
Sam seemed just a little bit better when Dean went down earlier to check on him, after a shower. Dean’s little brother is still sweating and wild-eyed, but he says he's not seeing things in the corners anymore. He ate all the pancakes and drank all the water, and kept it all down. Dean has to believe that means good things.
He looks down to feel cool steel—strangely slippery, somehow different—against his hands. That strange, shimmery, silver knife of Cas is in his hand. It feels right, there—silky, like it's nuzzling into the cup of his palm.
Cas shakes his head and doesn't look into his eyes. "I'm alright," he says. "Let me wrap your knee."
Sam can't argue out of the best faith effort clause—Crowley admits that Hell will be chaotic after all this goes down, and he may or may not be in a position to directly return to Bobby's soul. None of them like it, but it's a foot in the door and they have ten years to fix it.
Cas just bends back down and kisses him softly through it, and Dean does what he can to just hold on this and not think about how lucky they got—how lucky Dean got. Even here, with Cas’s chest warm atop his through Dean’s thin t-shirt, he's suddenly having a tough time again believing he gets this. He still expects to wake up in the back of the Impala, Cas's body wrapped in a tarp in the trunk, Dean's life all-but-over.
But Dean's so tired of pain and death. He holds the knife by the blade and—a little reluctantly—offers the hilt back to Cas. "If I kill him, like this," he says, slowly, "I think he's won."
And goes right back to work, giving Dean one last suck all the way down his throat and another gentle rub against his hole. Dean cries out, "F—fuck. Sweetheart, fuck," as he feels himself start to tip over the point of no return, but Cas backs off just enough so that the head of Dean's cock is surrounded by soft, soft tongue and palate.
"Anything," Dean whispers into his neck, answering the question Cas didn't really ask. "Everything." When he glances back up, Cas's eyes are wet, but his smile is huge and made of sunshine.
"Oh fuck," Dean hisses. The back and forth rub of their cocks is a little dry, but experience says that'll change quick.
Dean doesn't think he's ever been the little spoon before—hell, he can count the number of times he's shared a bed the whole night with someone rather than just picking up and slipping out on one hand. Even with Cassie. But there must be something really soothing about it, because it's not just the exhaustion that takes him away, soft and dreamless.
"Hey Cas," Dean finally says. "I never wanted to talk about the future because I didn't want to admit I didn't think I had one. It wasn't fair to either of us to plan for that, if all you were going to do was lose me. You know?” He pauses, like he’s waiting for an answer, and God, why would he even? “But… I didn't think about it going down this way and I think I know why now."
"Yeah, well," Cas says, tiredly, from his place holding up the wall again. "We're making it up as we go along." He might look like cute roadkill right now, but Dean can feel his pride from across the room.
It's just him and Sam left in the living room. Jimmy and Amelia haven’t come back down after seeing Claire off to bed, so Dean suspects they kindly slipped away after the cleanup to leave the Winchesters to their business. It's appreciated.
The next time Cas's fingers nudge inwards, Dean runs the tip of his own finger against Cas's tight, stretched, slippery rim. Cas jolts forward with a sharp, small moan like he got electrocuted, pushing his cock harder into Dean's fist. And now Dean's not the only one dripping, the wet of Cas’s precome dribbling onto the head of his own cock. Fuck, okay, that’s… really hot, too.
For a moment, Cas looks tempted, but then he shakes his head a little regretfully. "I wouldn't have anywhere to put it," he murmurs, rubbing the flannel between his fingertips again before folding it up and putting it down on Dean's pile. He picks up another one and looks at Dean's basket with a soft laugh. "You really like them."
"I ain't juicin', Sam," he finally answers, seriously. "I mean, I don't have that magic woo woo wiring that you've got. How would that even work?" He shakes his head. "Look, I didn't know that would happen. I thought I was gonna crack my hand; just had to do something to distract him, y’know?  But I'm guessing it has something to do with, uh...” he shrugs, awkwardly, “bein' pulled out of Hell by the kind of angel that just scared the shit out of that dickweed. Cas gave me the angel knife, too. Before you ask."
Sam looks down at the envelope, frowning, and both eyebrows rise. "’Dean Novak?’" He blinks, twice, and turns to look Dean in the eye. His face is doing a really weird thing. "Wait...
Dean shifts his leg and presses back, trying to sooth the near physical ache at the idea of Cas cutting into himself.
But the tip of Cas's tongue peeks through his lips, flicks lightly at one corner. He hasn't looked away. Dean shouldn't be able to get any of these details in the dark. Fuck, he's so
He smiles at Dean over the roof of the car and it's like sunshine peeking out of clouds for how warm it makes him feel. They hold hands in the car as Dean starts the ignition, rings clinking solidly. The feel and sound of it is weirdly grounding, and Dean doesn't even feel too much concern about the fact that they're about to be very publicly dating. Hell, it might be the end of the world tomorrow. Who cares if anyone sees them holding hands?
"Hey, how come I'm the only one getting naked, here?" Dean complains, and even he's shocked by how deep his voice sounds in the confines of Baby's frame.
He never thought this might feel good for someone getting it—okay, he never thought of doing this at all—but Cas's soft sounds make it clear he's into it. Damn.
Dean trudges back upstairs and Cas does that thing where he moves an inch over in his sofa spot to provide Dean with his own space, like there wasn't plenty of space there before. Dean takes it anyway. Cas is a little stiff beside him, but his gaze is soft and warm. Dean looks back at him and nods.
"I've been dreaming of you my whole life, and no one ever thought you were real," Cas answers, and if that doesn't send a shock down Dean's back, nothing should. And it does, it does, because Dean might not dream like that, but there's something about him that
After a painful encounter with Alastair, and a possible concussion, they come up with an explanation—a fucking seal, again; the dead aren’t dying because the town reaper is dead. It gets them a witness, and a plan.
The knee at his hip tightens just a little. Cas doesn't quite lift his head, though, so his next words are mumbled into Dean's chest, and Dean can't quite understand them. Cas squirms closer. Yeah, there's gonna be no guard duty angel tonight if Dean has anything to say about it.
cooking food or if it's just Cas... cooking. Like, actual pancakes. He leans over to Bobby and whispers, loudly. "I didn't know you had pancake mix in the pantry."
Dean smooths his fingers back and forth along Cas's shoulders, and watches the way Cas's eyes linger on his own eyes, his nose, his cheekbones, his chin. "Looks like you got something on your mind," Dean points out, softly. "And not the good stuff."
Above him, Cas shudders and gives him a heated look out of hooded eyes. Oh yeah, he definitely got the gist of what Dean was thinking. They're gonna have to talk about that later.
Dean can't blame him for being pissed-off, because honestly? If he were in Jimmy’s shoes, Dean’s not sure he’d believe in good intentions, either, if a Winchester walked in and said ‘An angel told me in a dream to come and help you out.’ Especially since Jimmy’s last encounter with angels was when Uriel, all smiles, talked about offing him because he was conveniently there. (Yeah, Uriel’s a real charmer.)
(Also, he's saving the fact that he probably can actually toss Sam over the back of the sofa, now, for a rainy day. The other day, he picked Cas right off the ground from a standing position, and not a thing about it hurt. He hasn't quite figured out how to tell Sam about that yet, 'cause, uh.)
"I think," Dean eventually pants when he finally finds some balance, but he's not letting go of Cas just yet. Can't. Won't. "If we try anything more complicated than that, I may die when I come."
He knows this could be a djinn. A dream. An angel mindfuck. That's the only way he gets what he wants.
Across the room, Sam snickers, not having looked up from his pages but obviously paying attention anyway. “Dean does like ‘commanding,’” he announces, then frowns. “Wait, what exactly are you two looking at?”
There's a flap outside and a hard, woody smack that makes Cas jerk up straight, and even with his grace squished he’s on his feet faster than a human can move. His angel blade sings in his fingers. "No. That's an angel," he says, grimly. "Stay here."
"So... not that great, then?" he teases. "'Cause you did not short out a single light bulb. Should I try harder next time?"
Dean starts, flashes of sense memory passing before his eyes: Cas’s lips on his collarbone as his finger traced along Dean’s ribs; the warm sparks of pain down his tailbone as Cas sucked on his neck "Hey now—what? No!" he yelps.
But there's a difference between wanting to see Cas smile and thinking he's so damned cute when he squints—and feeling that lick all the way through t-shirt, through scar and skin, all the way down to Dean's goddamned soul.
"We're gross," Dean mumbles, tucking his nose into Cas's hair and taking a breath. He smells like books, like sunshine. Maybe a little like sweat. Dean inhales deeper.
Dean looks down at his hand—his knuckles should be in pieces—and the ring gleams on his finger, warm and bright and welcoming. He runs a thumb over it because he can't not, and looks up again.
That is the most endearing thing Dean has ever heard. So there’s no real explanation for why it also makes him want to snarl and mark up Cas with a big neon sign that screams 'Dean Winchester's, fuck off.' Cas looks at him out of the corner of his eye with a knowing glint, and Dean has the grace to feel slightly embarrassed about it.
"I mean… Dean, if it’s real, I don’t think it could get better than this. I trust you guys," Sam says when Dean's done. God, even after six months, that's still such a good thing to hear after that year of lies and bullshit.
When he looks into the mirror the next morning and runs his fingers over the edges of the handprint on his skin, he thinks with a sick jolt that it might be fading.
"Hey. Don't waste your grace like that," Dean grumbles, but he can't exactly say he's sorry about it.
There's no time or date: maybe Sam doesn't know, or maybe he does but can't get away to communicate it yet. Either way, they're making due haste to Maryland and finding a place to camp out near that convent.
By the time Bobby comes back up they're both sitting at the table, drinking coffee and eating pancakes. Cas's portion is much smaller than anyone else's, but Dean notices, because Cas doesn't normally need to eat at all, and he ate chili last night, too. It’s probably the wards on the house: Cas nods a little when Dean tries to ask with his eyes what’s going on.
Dean stares at him for a long moment before smiling wide, still giddy from orgasm and the idea that he has the choice. That these
"So," Cas says, running a hand down Dean's chest before sliding it over to fit his fingers against the grooves of Dean’s ribs, pulling Dean just that much closer to him. "What's next?"
(Cas, it turns out, loves Looney Tunes. Go figure. Though everyone, but everyone, stared at him when he started commenting on how Road Runner represents God, and Wil. E. Coyote represents man endlessly chasing the divine. It took about thirty seconds before Cas’s expression cracked and he started laughing at the lot of them. Goddamned angel.)
Lilith laughs. "Little angel, pretty little angel, haven't you heard?" She shakes her head, pityingly. "That's not the plan anymore! Go along, run along now, and tell your bosses I say 'hi...'"
exclaims Sam from the door, barreling through it like he's going for vamps and waving the angel blade that Dean hadn't had the heart to take back from him. "Dean, Bobby said—
Cas turns and glances at him with a kind of infinite sadness that makes Dean's chest ache. "Not really."
He can almost literally feel the waft of amusement from Cas as he eats his own bowl, slower, but with no less appreciation. The bruise on his face is finally starting to fade a bit, but Dean still wants to touch it gently and take away the pain.
Dean vaguely recognizes that Sam's got his flirt on with the Medical Examiner; Dean's just kind of happy that she's not Ruby. Sam gives him a strange look back in the car, but says nothing.
"I'm not looking to start anything," Cas protests, but he's smiling. His fingers pause on Dean's biceps, though.
"It helps me," Castiel explains, his gaze on the rumple of the top sheet over his knees. "It helps in ways I didn't expect, and I... thought it could help you in similar ways."
Cas wraps around him like it's his mission in life, arms surrounding Dean's ribcage, both hands sliding into Dean’s back pockets like they've lived there his whole life. Dean's got Cas's hair in his hands, threading through it with his fingers until it’s even wilder than normal. When he lets go, it’s to let his thumb sit at Cas's jaw, enjoying the play of skin and scruff over bone and muscle.
A little to his surprise, it's Sam who steps up, walking between Cas and Ruby to break the line of sight before someone bursts into flame. "Okay, okay," he says, and it's not clear which of them he's talking to. "Look, we don't have a case right now. And we can't fight a war on both fronts unless we split up the research."
By the time they’ve convinced Chuck that they’re the real deal and not some really big fans, he’s stopped looking at them like they might implode in a Misery sort of way and more like an actual, much more immediately violent sort of of way. Chuck takes one step back like he thinks Dean might shoot him. Well, there’s that possibility—
Dean wants to reach out and catch his hand as it draws away, but, well. He won't, and the amused glitter in Cas's eyes as he wanders back over towards Sam makes him wonder if Cas knows it.
"It's cheating if you're basing that off actual knowledge of what Jesus was like, sweetheart," Dean points out, craning his nose over to look at the paper Cas is marking up with a purple gel pen that he probably stole from Claire. Sometimes Cas’s kids write about interesting things. Sometimes he thinks they really need a good kick in the reality.
He's just about drifting off when a hard banging on the bedroom door jolts him back into shocked awareness.
Dean doesn't want to stop—he really, really doesn't want to stop—but he has to make something clear. He pulls back just enough that they're breathing into each other's space, but not overlapping. In the dark of a road without street lights, Cas's eyes are rimmed with shadows and warmth when Dean looks into them. "Hey, uh, y'know, I..." he swallows. "I really wasn't expecting—or looking for—it wasn't—"
Dean assumes Sam must be in the calm before the storm with the demon blood. He never did ask how much Sam had to drink. He's not sure he wants to know.
And, goddammit, the story gets steamy. Like, literally steamy, sure—Dean doesn't want to admit that happens in Baby, because it really does, her windows totally fog up from the inside—but the writing's just fucking
Dean's going to ignore that it's a little similar for him. There was never anyone like this for him either. "I just feel like I'm a little old to develop a shoulder fetish," is what he says instead.
The side of Cas's hand brushing gently, almost accidentally, against his, pinkie finger against pinkie finger, should not feel like that. Like the first time in a long time someone's touched him and made Dean
"But what if I was chosen because of what I am?" Sam asks quietly. "What if I was always broken and dirty and that's why… that's why it all happened?"
Cas shakes his head.  “I’m alright,” he repeats, a little more firmly. He looks up, then, meeting Dean’s eyes, and there’s something unfathomably tired in it. It’s not a physical exhaustion—okay maybe a little physical—but it’s mostly a soul-weariness that makes Dean ache in sympathy. "But I would like to hold you, if you don't mind."
He can't help it, though. Cas took off his coat and suit and button-down. He's just wearing an old raggedy t-shirt with Northwestern University on it, the collar stretched out and sagging. The cover sheet is pulled over his thighs and lap. His blue eyes look a little sleepy, and his hair is fluffed up a little on one side like he ran his hand through it and forgot to smooth it back down.
"Might overload her brain," Dean agrees. "Though I'm sure she'd consider it a heck of a Christmas gift."
A gentle hand touches his chin, turns his face towards Cas. "We're here, now," Cas says. "We met exactly when we were supposed to."
"You're alive," Jimmy says and the first tear trickles down the side of his nose. His lip quivers, just slightly and then he's moving, faster than he should for someone with that kind of open wound. "Praise God in Heaven, you're
"Harder," Cas gasps, and his cock drips a thin, pale, tempting line onto Dean's belly, just underneath Dean’s belly button.
It's Dean's job to keep the bastards down and away from Sam while he finishes. It's easier with the ring, easier still as Sam gets through more and more of the exorcism and the demons’ hold on their meat suits weaken.
"I don't need to," Cas murmurs, and his breath on the newly damp skin tingles sweet and bright. His finger traces the very edge of the handprint on Dean's opposite shoulder, and the little flare of pain underneath it is like the bite of good whiskey. Or like anticipation. "My mark is on your shoulder, and now my words are scribed on your bones."
He goes back in with two fingers, twisted together to create a thicker, blunt, tip. Dean maybe needs to take a deep breath now and then, because it's almost like he can feel all that slippery heat on his cock when he thinks too hard about it. He pushes in slow, so slow, and Cas just takes it, smooth as anything, easing back against the fingers inside him with his cock dripping all over Dean’s belly.
Dean stares at Cas’s fingers, long and tapered, moving softly and slowly over the wet head and ruddy red shaft. "Noted."
"Sam," Dean croaks out, throat crackling from the disuse of sleep. "You can open your eyes. Nothing to see." He pauses thoughtfully. "Though that'll teach you to knock."
He can almost feel Cas's little wry smile, from this close. "Dead? I mean, by angelic standards, I'm as close as can be, I suppose. Practically a corpse."
Dean doesn’t move from where he’s standing. The words “Yeah? Let ‘em die,” are on the tip of his tongue, held between his teeth like a hiss. The only thing that keeps them from coming out is this weird wave of
But no. He's not ashamed, not exactly, just... uncomfortable. This thing with Cas is difficult for him because of how it's not like all those one night stands and whatever little affairs he had where he didn’t just hit it and quit it. Even Cassie Robinson didn’t compare. What he and Cas have is weird and complicated, but it’s also nothing Dean ever thought he'd have. Or want.
" his eyes get distant briefly and Dean's hands ache to do something. "I’m strange, but that has nothing to do with a past life. I'm not schizophrenic."
There are approximately 8.5 timestamp ideas for this verse waiting on us. So we'll be back here sometime soon. But as we said in a far earlier chapter, Tia and I are a fanfic OSHA violation waiting to happen so for the safety of ALL we need to pace ourselves.
"There better be morning sex," Dean mumbles, as Cas curls up against his back, knees tucking into knees. A palm rests on Dean's hip before it starts a slow circle, erasing an ache he hadn't even been aware of.
Cas tilts back against him, reaching back to run a hand up the side of Dean's thigh. Even from behind him, Dean can tell  Cas is smiling. "Whatever happened to 'the way to a man's heart is through his stomach?'"
Cas is sweating down his neck and pink all the way down to his nipples, glowing in an entirely human way that's so fucking beautiful, even if Dean will never be able to articulate just how or why or how much. His dark head is tilted back, his neck a long delicate line only interrupted by the roll of his Adam’s apple as Cas swallows and gulps for air. He’s fucking devastating, and he looks like he’s having a very, very good time.
Cas moves a leg, and Dean thinks he should probably get off him—Cas isn't a little guy, but Dean ain't light. But Cas is just sort of sticking his knee between Dean's, molding them together a little further, locking them together a little more. The hand he had on Dean's hip hasn't moved.
"It's really you," a man in hospital scrubs says, softly, and the echo of his voice feels like a touch. He's so backlit by the light streaming in from a cracked window near the ceiling that Dean can barely see his features, but it looks like he’s wearing a trench coat covering up what must be asylum-wear. It's not a great look, and yet, somehow, Dean can't take his eyes off him.
Castiel runs his hand down the planes of Dean's back, enjoying the play of muscle and heat that he can feel through the thin cotton. Dean hiccups in shock when Castiel's hand doesn't stop at the end of his shirt and instead runs straight over his ass and under his thigh until there's just enough leverage to pull at the back of his knee and--oh, there it is. Dean's leg finishes curling around Castiel's hip, knee pressing harder against the bed beside Castiel’s waist, and he ruts down against him: they meet hot and delicious in the middle.
Since there's nothing really else Dean can say other than 'please don't vaporize my angel,' he just completes the arc and puts the jalapeño popper into his mouth. He chews. It crunches real nice, a warm curl of cheese melting on his tongue, spiced with a pickled jalapeño.
It's like he knows just how to ramp Dean up the right way rather than down the scale into being freaked out. "Yeah?" Dean breathes, though he doesn't raise his head off Cas's neck. Okay, Dean’s definitely going to want to watch that someday.
Dean remembers the uncomplicated joy of giving Cas something he'd dreamed about his whole life, something Cas never thought he'd get. God, it was so easy, and all of it felt so good, even before Dean was inside him—Cas sprawled gasping on top of him with his face lit up with happiness, Dean’s fingers slipping carefully in and out of him. It's the kind of thing Dean thought only existed in novels and movies, but it happened to him, to
Shit. Dean didn't know that he needed to hear that. He didn't know that he needed someone else to look at Sam and see that. The flood of hurt and relief are overwhelming, and he ducks his chin to his chest.
Jesus. Dean's already half-forgotten their little tiff when they got home. He raises a hand to touch Cas's cheek; he's getting better at being the one who touches, not just the one who gets touched. He chuckles. "Sweetheart. I was mad and bein' an ass, too. If you're not an ass back, I'm probably not gonna listen."
"Y-yes." Dean isn't ashamed to say his voice cracks. Anyone's would. He reaches out to loosen Cas's tie, fair's fair. He gets about three shirt buttons open before he gives into temptation and skims his fingers over smooth chest and warm muscles. He wants to lean in and kiss the dip right where Cas’s neck meets his chest, but Cas is already drawing more symbols on Dean.
We're a little more than halfway through, now! We're also so happy you guys seemed to enjoy Bobby so much! Some more familiar faces upcoming, with maaaybe some domesticity, maaaybe some plot, and a confrontation that's been long in the making...
Cas joins him the rest of the way, leaning back against the same car, face turned up towards the sparkling night sky. "It's beautiful, but it always makes me feel cold."
For a brief, long, few seconds everything pauses and all Dean can hear is Cas's rough, stuttering breathing. His face is white and tense, and even though his eyes are open again, they’re fixed blindly on the ceiling.
He got sunburnt and warmth-drunk, dug his toes into the sand and then had to figure out how to get the little granules out of every last damned thing. That night, Cas kissed all of his new, darkened freckles. Then did it again, for good measure.
Dean is nose-first in a mug of coffee and a plate full of bacon and eggs (and he needs to thank Amelia for teaching Cas the secret to eggs) by the time Sam stumbles his way to the table.
When put like that, Dean can't help but agree, but Sam looks ready to spit nails. He really wants Lilith—wants to make her pay for what he sees as the death and torture of his brother.
Dean isn't even angry. Okay, no, he's angry.  But he's also just tired. Tired of all of this bullshit, and of the one really good thing to happen to him in like… ever… being compared to something outta Hell. Literally. He suddenly aches for Cas in the weirdest of ways.
Cas shivers and arches at the slow scrape of nails, his back flexing deliciously under Dean's hands; damn, that's a rush.
Dean bites down on the inside of his cheek hard enough to taste blood, because the first thing that sprung to mind were the words of the exorcism he's just barely got memorized. "Because
dead. There's a big difference between 'mostly dead' and 'all dead.'" His fingers curl through Dean's like little plant shoots going for the light.
Dean checks to make sure his hand isn't too dirty before he links their pointer fingers together. "Ain't nothin' wrong with breakfast for dinner, I'm pretty sure that's what most diners exist for."
Dean looks up. His brother looks kind of freaked out. Oh, it's probably his first time taking angel express, come to think of it.
But the scene when they screech up to the sight of a little sedan on a side road is even more fucked up than Dean thought.
Cas is suddenly there, standing, pulling him close and tucking him into the curve of his body. His big ugly coat flares around them both as he pulls Dean inside it. "I guessed," he says. "I can't help but think that way, but I know why you can't. I do."
"She says she's looking for her," Sam says like it's a reasonable idea. “Seems like a demon would be able to—”
Dean fumbles for his lighter, but before he gets more than a few sparks going, the lights around the edges of the room are back on—all except the ones overhead that broke.
They really should talk about that soon. If only Heaven and Hell would give it a rest long enough to let them. Dean sighs and turns to the dead body that had housed Lilith, still on the floor.
Dean hums into the next kiss. (Cas probably isn’t getting that Dean had no issue at all about getting tongue-fucked against the wall. That was a hell of a kiss.)
Bobby leans in and peers. "Okay. I'll grant that it definitely has that look about it. So what? You got gifted with some fancy brass knuckles, why the secrecy?"
“I am so glad we don’t have to use condoms for this. I have been looking forward to finding out how you taste,” Cas informs him, like that’s just something that he can just come out and
There's no message from Sam by the time they get into Baby—Sam, it looks like, took the Novak car from the driveway; thank God. Dean struggles to remember just how to turn on the GPS tracker on Sam's phone with the laptop, but after a tense few minutes, he gets it.
Cas, though, Cas looks mad like Dean’s only seen him a few times before: like if he could blow someone up with his eyes alone, he'd do it. "Who did this to you, Anna?" he growls out, even lower than his normal rasp.
They find a rhythm together, and he gets lost in the slick pull of Cas's body, mesmerized by the heat and softness under his fingertips. But he blinks when Cas eases another of his fingers in, taking the total up to three.
Cas raises his head from the other side of the table and tilts it, curiously. Dean shakes his head and puts down the cup, and the newspaper. "Uh." He lies for a living. He could lie to Cas's twin. Right? And it's not like Cas would give a shit about it. Right?
He can't do both at once, and every time he tries, something dumb happens. Like Sam getting all Hulk Angry about Dean and Cas.
Cas hums softly into it and leans in, his lips already starting to part softly in that way that's turning into one of Dean's favorite things in the world, when Dean pops back.
His first step closer almost wrenches a sob out of him, but Dean chokes it back. He pulls in. There are things to do first. Slowly he winds closer to the table until finally, he reaches out a trembling hand and pulls the sheet away, too quickly, like gauze that’s scabbed right into a wound.
Dean tips his chin down and buries his nose in Cas's sweaty hair. "Not enough room in the budget for extra light bulbs?"
Sam stares at Cas for a long few seconds. Dean can read the distrust there, but Sam finally makes a decision and hands the papers over his shoulder. Cas reads them, long elegant fingers running over each line. Dean gets the impression that Cas, for as fast as he's reading, has slowed down significantly to make sure he misses nothing.
"You know, the funny thing is?" Dean says slowly. "For a long time, I'd have told you that's what I always believed. No good guys—just bad guys and guys who suck slightly less." He thinks about Cas—about how, for all his history, all he wants is peace and a little bit of companionship. But he'll stand by Dean's side, and die bloody if that's what's needed. He thinks of Bobby, upstairs kibitzing with a fallen angel. He thinks of Tessa, offering him a tiny, tiny bit of hope back when Dean wasn’t even sure he believed in hope anymore.  "Now? I'm starting to come around to the idea."
“You want us to, to give him up? Just like that?” he hisses. “You want me to tell them where he is?!”
He and Cas exchange a look. Cas wrinkles his nose. Yeah, Dean kind of feels that way about fancy wedding shit, too.
The cut was a stab, not a slash; most of the damage was on the inside, and he's pretty sure Cas has a handle on that. Dean tapes it up with gauze, and there's no staining on it when he's done. The twins have sort of gone back to talking in half-sentences and words that Dean isn't sure are English, but, well. They're twins. Even if one of them is an angel and Dean's... well, whatever Cas is to Dean.
"Oh, you Winchesters,” he sneers, and his eyes flash red. “Always think you can get out of the prophecy. Don't you know yet, darlings? You
"That night, in the backseat of the Impala," Dean says, closing his eyes and enjoying the feel of Cas's fingers through his jeans. "When you asked me if I'd done this before, and said that you had, when you were in a, um. A dark place."
“That’s… true, but it’s not. It’s complicated.” Cas shoves his hands into his trench coat pockets and Dean can see the faint outline of them curling into fists. "The siege of Hell lasted nearly twenty years before we finally had some movement. My garrison was in the lead. It was my strategy that broke the first ring."
It's everything like touching himself and nothing at all. The way he can see pleasure just racing across Cas's face is just as good as feeling it himself. The way Cas writhes under him when Dean tries a little move on him that he likes on himself, with a careful twist to gently pop the ridge of the head of his cock in and out of the careful circle of his fingers, makes Dean want to lick him everywhere.
. With those with whose destinies you've decided to play fast and loose" Cas growls, and Dean for once isn't getting an instant boner at the sound of that rumble. Thank God.  "It's not about Heaven or Hell, it's about the humans in the crossfire. It always was. Michael is supposed to fight Lucifer to
Dean still gets creeped out by the entire, healthy-looking, fully-decorated Christmas tree the Novak house has had up for two full weeks. He can smell it throughout the house, every time he turns around, and it took a while before he felt comfortable going near it, because it has all sorts of glass ornaments on it to go with the clothespin reindeers and glittery pipe cleaner people that Claire made in school. (Dean’s pretty fucking good with a glue gun, if he says so himself. Claire got in trouble for saying that her Uncle Cassie’s “useless with the art stuff,” though.)
Dean agrees. As much as he hates research—and as much he does not, for one second, want to read more bullshit about his own kisses, much less anything else—they need more information.
Cas laughs a little. "I know." He reaches over, grabs the lube, and then shuts the drawer. "If it helps, my knowledge is mostly theoretical."
It’s so damned horrifying that Dean even trusts Ruby to split off from them and protect the twins. Get them away. Get them someplace safe. They don’t have a choice.
Cas, like always, ignores Dean's best-laid plans and slides his way out of his coat and jacket, separating briefly from Dean to tug Dean’s t-shirt over his head.
Bobby comes back with an armful of bottles and clinking jars, and starts throwing stuff hastily together into little Ziplock bags. "What?" he says, when Dean stares. "They work just as well as the stupid fancy cloth things." He passes Dean a shotgun.
They slowly make their way towards the table piled high with food. Dean recognizes that it’s pretty much all barbecued, smoked, or fried; it all smells fantastic, but he's not sure he'll be able to choke much down. His ass has barely touched the seat before Death points at a pile of breaded, golden-brown round objects. "I suggest you begin with the jalapeño poppers. They make an excellent starter."
Dean nods frantically, biting his lip. He can't concentrate on anything but the almost-too-tight feel of Cas constricting around the head of his cock and the warm, silken hot slide of the lube coating them both. He keeps going, so, so slow and careful until Cas arches just slightly, gasping and Dean feels the whole head of his dick get swallowed up in Cas.
Dean's hands frame Cas's face, pulling him in for another kiss. The hand not on Dean's shoulder slides up his neck and into his hair. They kiss, deep and slow and a little wet; Dean's skin feels electric, and each press of Cas's stomach against his is frighteningly good. It's all a little different than he expects (less soft bits, more facial hair) but it's still electric.
Under him, Cas shudders, head tipping back and away from Dean's skin. His hips roll up sharply, taking Dean on a ride of sensation that will never, ever get old.
Dean’s little brother tries to talk to him again as they're settling into their motel for the night. Dean grunts something that maybe satisfies him, because Sam's only giving him worried eyes as Dean goes into the bathroom. But at least he doesn't follow him in.
John. Hell. Dean's teeth clench. Does the kid even know that John Winchester is dead? Does he have any idea how Dean and Sam were raised? How they didn't have holidays or birthday parties or baseball games, 'cause the hunt came first and all else was a distraction?
It's a weird weapon: it should feel unbalanced, but it doesn’t. It doesn’t even have a sharp edge, when they test it against some fabric, but neither of them touch the blade. Dean thinks it'll give him a mean swing, and probably not have any resistance when it goes into a body, despite its aged and weathered appearance.
"Can't help it." Dean wiggles, mimicking Castiel's stretch. It might be mocking, but Dean’s smiling. "Had a great night's sleep."
Cas's arms wind around him and pull Dean close and upright, tucking his head under Cas's chin. He smells clean and warm, a little spicy. He feels a
Cas doesn't keep up 'casual' real well. He curls his head back on his neck, and considers. "I knew him," he tells the clouds overhead. "Not particularly well. He didn't bother to interact with my flight. Truly, I have to say that Lucifer didn't seem to like much of anyone."
"For the love of all that is holy, please stop talking." Bobby sounds beyond pained, and from behind his closed eyelids Dean can hear the opening and pouring of something much stronger than beer.
His dreams are disjointed and cold, edged with ice. The most recent one is more of a never-ending darkness, sucking all the light and warmth away from Dean, the tiny glowing curls swirling away into an endless abyss.  Dean wishes his shoulder still hurt, rather than this terrible numbness that spikes right into his sleep. He wishes a lot of things.
The second, though, is Cas—or really, how to be with Cas without freaking out, because Dean doesn't get happy endings or normal life things, and he doesn’t have the first fucking idea how to have them. Maybe that's something he'll eventually be ready to start poking at, but not before Sam.
Cas makes a little amused noise. “All those safe sex lectures, down the drain.” He shakes his head sadly. “My gay forefathers are spinning in their graves.”
Dean breathes out a long, slow exhale that seems to last forever, but it feels very, very familiar against Castiel's cheek. He's so close. When did he get so close?
They’ve got no idea Dean can barely feel the ground under his feet. Hell, he barely feels the zipper under his fingers when he gets his pants open to piss.
There's a gravity in the bed they share. At some point, their noses touch and Castiel has no idea why, or why it's so hard to pull away even when Dean's eyes blink open, soft and sleepy.
It's... Cas—Cas, who doesn't expect anything from Dean that he can't give, but who sometimes knows what he needs before Dean does. He feels a stab of guilt about Sam. He and Sam used to be a lot like that, but now Dean knows Sam is keeping secrets from him, and Dean is definitely returning the favor. That they probably have different reasons is beside the point. Dean can't wait for the day when the air’s clear between them again. At a moment like this, Dean believes it’s possible.
Michael must hear it, too, because he looks vaguely surprised, but he just says, “‘When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.’”
"That's the first normal thing you've said all day, boy," Bobby says, but he starts leading Dean up the stairwell.
Cas smiles wanly. "I'm cut off from Heaven. It’s why Zachariah assumed I was dead. So large expenditures of energy, such as transporting two humans and their car, can be... taxing."
Bobby nods. "Alright. I'll see if I can dig anything up on mystical combination locks while you two have your little lunch date with Thanatos." He doesn't look all that enthusiastic about any of it, though. "Roma Downey here can stick around as long as she needs, I suppose." He lumbers off to get started.
"Hmmm," Sam says, in that know-it-all tone that makes Dean really want to hit him. "Yeah, okay. But... hey. Dean…
Dean winces and there's a moment, just a moment, where he considers yanking his hand back from where it’s tangled with Cas’s.
Cas steps closer to Sam, who reluctantly lets him into his personal space. Cas’s hand glows and then shakes with effort, the brightness flickery like a bulb with old wiring.  It goes on for long seconds before Cas gasps and steps back. He’s trembling again.
Dean's always liked sex. It was always how he managed to connect when he knew there wasn't gonna be any other kind of connection, and they'd be moving on down the road in a few hours, or days—the next hunt. He got good at it, too. Someone happy under him, or on top of him, always made him smile.
It's perfect. It's almost perfect. Next to his head, Dean’s hand clenches tightly into the bedding. "Let me hear you," Castiel pleads, as Dean rubs against him. With the edge taken off, he can see the sweat at Dean's hairline and touch the desperation in the line of his back. "Please, I want to."
All of which is to say, Dean's in a mood when they finally come face to face with the nebbishy little drunk. Dean wants to complain that it's not his fault he's yelling, not really: there's no fucking healthy way to process some dude writing about your life like a big time voyeur with binoculars that can see, like,
The food descriptions are not my doing this time! And, c'mon, tell me that isn't the cutest first date ever: laundry, pie, and, well, Baby's back seat...
Dean really does. It's just as weirdly nice as it was at the Novak house, strange and foreign and soft. Dean hands Cas a t-shirt—one of Dean's, because why the fuck not. He starts watching Cas peel himself out of his trench coat and suit and tie again.
Bobby topples his hand back and forth. "Drank some water. Couple of bites last night. Maybe get him to take some real food today. Not talkin' crazy anymore. Or any crazier'n normal."
Cas's answer is nothing more than a low rumble that buzzes through Dean's body. It certainly feels positive enough. They stay like that for a few minutes, leaning against a table and each other. Dean is slumped and Cas is warm and yielding, but strong. They keep their arms wrapped around each other, a lot like that night in the Impala.
The descriptions of the ladies are perfectly vague, but full of the kinds of adjectives someone in love might use. ‘Perfect.’ ‘Amazing.’ ‘Everything they ever wanted.’
One of Cas’s last shudders tightens his thighs just right, and the first spurt of come leaving Dean’s cock smacks him with pleasure. He bites at Cas's skin to contain his scream. It's so good. So fucking good. His whole body orgasms—his skin, his hair, his toes, his dick— and all of him shudders and moans.
That's when Dean realizes there's an awkward archangel in the room, standing completely still in the corner and waiting to be mentioned. Introduced. Whatever. "Ah, Sammy? So. We've got an extra for dinner."
"Yeah, he's the sensitive brother," Dean grunts. He feels the smile Cas hides against his cheek. "D'you think you can stand to get back to the house? 'Cause, uh." Yeah, Dean's strong for his size, but he's pretty sure he can't carry Cas.
They're crossing into Minneapolis when Cas makes a quiet noise, looking up from the pile of newspapers he picked up at the last gas station on his lap.
Something else nearby flashes again, but fuck if Dean cares. Heat is pooling in his cock, hot and sparking, and pleasure is building from the soles of his feet upwards. Cas's hand on his forearm tightens further; Dean thinks he might have bruises later, and that just makes it better.
Cas blushes. "To be fair, I actually brought your bag here last night. I just got too distracted to tell you."
Sam gives them a suspicious back-and-forth, but it's kind of fucked-up that Dean giving Cas the stink-eye seems to settle him down, some. "So," he says, neutrally. "Heaven's out to get us, too?"
Sam chuckles, softly, but he hangs Baby back up on the tree. Carefully, Dean notices, touching it with a finger before he walks back to the couch to sit down. "This is what family is like?"
Dean blinks, whatever facade he's been putting up fractured in the face of, well, Charlie. "Time--what now?"
In front of him, Alastair grins into Dean’s face, chained in the middle of a devil's trap. Inias gives him a proud walkthrough of all the protections put in place.
Dean wrinkles his nose playfully. "I don't know if yoghurt belongs in food. That sounds like the sort of thing Sammy has for breakfast."
Dean traces the head, spreading some of the liquid gathered there out; it makes the fabric a little slippery and it makes Cas a lot shivery. He lets out a shaky sigh. "Dean." Cas reels him in for a kiss. It's been minutes since their lips have touched and frankly, that's a crime.
Cas has his eyes half-closed, his eyelashes shades with the dark of his pupils edged with blue just barely peeking out from under them. He shivers once as Dean spreads the cool gel around and around with two slippery fingers, the tremor of it going down Dean's whole front.
When Dean comes, it's with Cas's hair clenched in the fingers of one hand, holding too tight, the condensation of the window wet and cool against his other palm. It's with Cas moving under him like he knows what he wants and he's gonna get it—their cocks sliding side by side, Cas's hot as a brand even through Dean's jeans and that dorky underwear. It's with a guy who's pretty undeniably a guy under him—a stranger who's not a stranger, and who might just be out of Dean's life by tomorrow. It’s with a sleek, clever tongue licking at Dean’s scar in a way that should not be sexy.
It doesn't last long, but it goes on forever, Dean's entire body shaking with it, with grief and sadness and the unfairness of the universe. But through it, Cas never lets him go: he makes sure Dean knows he's there the whole time, with his voice and hands, the way his body is solid and real under Dean's hands and face.
"Helps that you’re not paying out the nose for it, though, right?" But this time Sam's leaning in like it's a conspiracy.
But Cas's smile at him has too much mischief to let that hang around for long. "I would make you a bet that you would like it," he says, primly, "but since I have seen inside your body and soul, it doesn't seem fair."
"I... I didn't know for sure," Cas says, softly, looking down into his hands. He's not silently crying, anymore, but he’s still shaking. His pupils are pinpoint. For the first time in a long time, Dean thinks he looks... maybe a little scared. "Not until..." he trails off. "Dean, please start the warding. Please."
Dean blushes again under his scrutiny, and the flush tints his breastbone. "Yeah, yeah," he murmurs. "Take a picture--” he pauses as Castiel opens his mouth: can he? He would like that...  “Wait, no, seriously, don't. It's just an expression."
Dean should stop him, he really should, but he's really not going to. But there won't be sex. Neither of them are up for sex and Dean is not going to call in Sam and Bobby to help haul them
They get a platter of tiny food bites and two bottles of beer that have lettering on it that looks Greek set in front of them before either of them even talks to a waitress or picks up a menu. Dean gives Cas a look. He just shrugs and reaches for something that looks like a miniature pen-sized egg roll, dipping it into a bowl of something thick and white.
Bobby hands him a glass of whiskey without a word. Dean sips it slowly. Holy crap, that stuff’s got a burn to it. He swallows. "Then Cas was just… he was back. Saved me, again, I guess.” Dean shakes his head. “There's a story about how he got me out of Hell. We protected each other down there, and that sort of translated across Heaven and Hell and everything in between. And y’know what?” Dean doesn’t know where the anger that rises in him is coming from, but it’s hot and clean and bright. It feels good. It feels
"You're my favorite angel ever," Dean says, leaning over to take it from his fingers, between his teeth.
Dean laughs. "Pretty sure you don't need pancakes to seduce me," he murmurs, and okay, that's pretty sappy even for him. The little bite marks he left on Cas's shoulders and neck from when they were in Illinois are gone, now; but when he tugs Cas’s shirt a little to the side, just to check, the little pink crescents his nails left on Cas’s shoulders last night are still there. Dean has to admit, he's kind of been thinking about whether they'll stick now that Cas's grace is suppressed. "But seriously, if you flirt with Bobby again I might start bleeding out of my ears."
"Said it before and I'll say it again... you are a freakin' menace, that's what you are," Dean mumbles. His hips jerk off the bed as Cas dips his tongue into Dean's bellybutton. It really, really tickles. "Hey!" he yelps.
"I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition, Dean Winchester," Cas says, and the purr of his dark, raspy voice makes the breath stick in Dean's throat. "And then I fell for you."
But that’s not good enough for Sam, oh, no, not today. He and Sam bicker about… something. About bullshit. Except what they’re really arguing about is giving a shit, and why Dean, these days, seems to just… not. Sure, Sam does, but he only seems to give a damn about dumb,
Cas blinks, but then he laughs, not much more than a happy huff. His smile is sly and warm, and not mocking at all. "That is a lovely compliment,” he teases, but he looks so happy. “I'll be sure to remind you of it in the future."
One day, that isn't going to be a turn-on, but not today. Dean lets the hand that was bracing his cock rest against the leg Cas has wrapped around him. When he starts to push inwards, the angle feels weird, at first, and he realizes that the thrust has a different arc than he's used to.
so he can look Cas in the eyes. Oh, hell, for all those words, Cas is blushing, too. Holy fuck, that's too cute. "Yeah, Cas."
"Like this," Cas answers, softly. His right hand hovers over Dean's left shoulder, but doesn't touch. His other arm wraps around Dean's waist, hand splaying at the small of his back. "Your gaze in mine, my grace filtering into the strength of your soul. We held each other up. We… connected."
Cas kisses the crown of his head, soft and gentle. "Angels need human vessels to walk the Earth, but having
, and if Cas had actually listened, and stayed with Bobby? Dean would have just kissed him goodbye at the door, and happily. But it was everything else that hurt Cas’s feelings: the idea that it would be so easy for Dean to leave him behind, or that he might not regret it nearly instantly. Cas should know better… well, so should Dean, but Cas can feel those insecurities sometimes as clearly as his own. It’s possible it was even as simple as Dean not talking about it with Cas in advance—the way Cas has been so careful to do with everything.
He shoots a slightly-panicked and slightly-betrayed glance at Cas. Shit, he wasn't ready to meet the little half-brother they didn't even know they had the first time, what the hell makes anyone think he's ready to do it now?!
describe angels as dicks with wings, and you’re not talking about the ones in their pants! It's not homophobic to think that you, of all people, taking up with—and then
"Damn right you're not, sweetheart," Dean says, softly, his whole body and both hands still. It's so fucking sappy. For once in Dean's life, he doesn't give a shit. He brings his free hand up and cups Cas's face in it. "You're perfect. For me, anyway."
"That's what would've been the problem," Dean answers, and this time, Cas laughs. "Though, come on, Cas, you practically jumped me from the word ‘go.’ I know you're stubborn, but I think my ass would've been yours eventually."
"So get this." Sam spreads open a pile of crunchy-edged newspapers. "A century-old oak that popped up right after a meteor shower in Union, Kentucky. What do you think of a small miracle?"
But when Cas offers him the bottle of lube, Dean arches both his eyebrows and grins at him, tucking his hands playfully behind his head and pretending to stretch. "Thought you were gonna take care of me?" he teases.
A second figure stands, slowly, warily. He's also backlit in the same way, but Dean doesn't care to look too hard at him. The first man has all of his attention.
Before Dean sleeps every night, though, he does close his eyes. He prays. Not for Cas to come back—he gets it, the sooner they figure this shit out, the sooner the world doesn't end.
Between one breath and the next, he feels a wave of pressure that seems to raise the hairs at the back of his neck, and his heart kicks up. Dean feels Cas come into the laundromat in the half-second between the really dirty and the regular dirty load.
"Thank you," Cas says, putting his fingertips on the edge of the bandage, testing the stick of the silk tape. His palm almost brushes Dean's fingers.
Cas's hand pets gently up Dean’s shoulder and ends cupping the back of his neck, holding Dean to him. "Yes," he agrees.
Cas twists under him when one of Dean's thrusts go a little ragged, a little shaky, trying to ward off the way in the next few moments he's either gonna have to stop moving or this is going to be over sooner than he wants. But Dean's angel doesn't stop—one of his knees pulls high enough to thump gently against the side of Dean's ribs, and he throws his head back. He arches so hard under Dean that for a second Dean thinks Cas might buck him off or out.
The intense look that Cas is giving Dean doesn't have time to actually come out of his mouth, though, 'cause Bobby's back with three beers. "I got the hunters lookin' for anything that goes boo," Bobby says, instead, back to their first topic. “You got anything in particular they oughtta be sniffing for?”
Cas stares at the empty space where Tessa was standing before she blinked out. "No one other than a reaper has actually seen Death since, perhaps, the beginning of time," he murmurs.
Sam and Dean truck onwards. They hand off Denver's case to someone else, because fucking Zachariah is probably frantically searching for them again, and choose cases that take them to backwoods counties and down tiny dirt roads instead.
Dean might just start crying again, because Sam sounds so much like himself for the first time in ages, and Cas looks like he's been coated in startled joy and doesn't quite know what to do with it yet.
Bobby eyes him consideringly, pursing his lips and making a show of going over options in his own mind, ticking his fingers in front of him. Finally, he answers, "Tit for tat."
Dean nods and pulls out the old atlas from under the front seat. It turns out they're on a state road just off the main interstate. Dean hauls ass down the bumpy, paved road until they hit highway, and then turns off at the first motel sign. He sends Sam in to see what the room situation is. Goddammit, he wishes he could ask for their own room, separate from Sam.
"My brother went after them. He's taking care of them," Dean half-lies. Or it might not be a lie. Fuck, he really hopes it's not a lie. "They, uh, they bolted. They got scared."
At least he knows what they're doing after the laundry is done. Instead of going to a local diner and taking his chances (sometimes they're amazing, especially if there's a truck stop attached, but sometimes they taste like something cooked on the same plate as the hotdogs) Dean goes fancy, and actually looks up a local bakery.
He's so damn distracted that he doesn't even remember that him and Cas sharing a room might be a little different than Sam and him sharing a room. It’s all automatic, at this point: check-in is on autopilot.
That kind of loyalty is staggering, and it hurts, and Dean doesn't know what he'd do without it now. He reaches up and blindly finds Cas's fingers, tangling them through and through. Their rings clink. "Don't have to keep watch every night," he murmurs.
Cas breathes in, slowly, and out. "It won’t matter what he wants, now," he says. He doesn't sound embarrassed of it, or ashamed. "But... that's what I suspected, yes."
Cas smirks and the worst of the mess from Dean's crying jag disappears from his shoulder. Dean's face feels dry and cool again, and he hopes to God the snot’s gone. He’s pretty sure there was nothing at all fucking beautiful about that crying. "You have a remarkably one-track mind," Cas notes.
"If you compare Cas to that demon bitch again, we're gonna have a real problem," Dean hisses. Cas squeezes their joined hands and Dean takes a deep breath and tries to consciously calm down. Now is not the time for this argument. "It's not the same."
Bobby grabs his gun, Dean grabs the angel blade tucked into the sheath at his back. Cas makes his appear out of nothing but a bit of trench coat. Dean would find that kind of cool if there weren't other things going on.
Dean’s startled for just a second when Cas twists into motion underneath him—but all he’s doing is scrambling for his own shirt, lifting it to reveal those flat abs that Dean likes to lick. That's when he realizes that Cas is still trying to be polite about it, and fuck if that doesn't make him want to try and swallow. But he hasn’t done that before, and Dean's not sure that's a good idea tonight. Another time, maybe, though.
Zach, or whatever he calls himself, goes so dark that there should be storm clouds raining on his balding head. His eyes bulge. "Believe me,” he sneers, making a wide gesture that’s probably supposed to encompass the whole human race, and not just his own body. Vessel. Whatever. “I have no interest in popping down here into one of these smelly things."
When he wakes up again, it's dark again. Sam's beside him again, and the scenery outside his window is familiar. There's a touch of light to the edge of the sky that suggests that the sun might be rising soon. His brother’s face is turned towards him.
Dean blinks. "Can you normally?" He never really thought about it, but that's a good point. He's supposedly got writing all over his ribs that says 'no one here but us chickens' to angels, and Cas has been able to locate him every time.
And that ain't the half of it. This half-numb feeling, like he's lost a limb, is gonna get him killed; Dean knows it, and he can't quite find it in himself to care. He even tells the kid he sees it being a short run, but the kid is already moving on.
He shifts his knees a little, because he needs the extra leverage to pick up speed. Dean is still careful—he can't help it; despite being looser than he was, Cas’s body is still so tight, and angel or not, Dean will
He doesn't even notice the change in flooring under him until Cas steps back, a guilty look all over his face. "My apologies, I didn't mean to do that quite yet."
like bottled lightning. Castiel doesn't even notice that Dean has arranged them in such a way that when Dean settles back down again, a warm and welcoming weight against Castiel’s front, they can rub together just by moving their hips.
Dean nods, and sits on the edge of the bed. Cas stands up and sits next to him. Dean shifts the phone to his other hand and their rings click as their fingers intertwine. "Yeah. So do we."
"Cas is an exception. Yeah, he is," Dean spits. "But it isn’t ‘cause he’s a guy, it’s 'cause I give a shit about him, and I really didn't give a shit about any of the other guys I fooled around with. Alright? You happy? We done with that data point? Wanna move on to the one where that angel
Crap. No. That's... probably not a good way to go with people he's actually maybe gonna wanna see again someday.
Cas wanders out to find him a few hours after Dean has to turn on the outside lighting to keep working. Dean's down to the point where he either has to call it a night, or start seriously disassembling large parts, and that's not a good idea with the time of day and their impending run on Lilith.
But Dean's done, panting, his hand shaking and twinging with pain. He didn't scrape hard enough to break skin; he doesn't think he punched hard enough to crack bone. He grabs for his phone—
"Yes. I got into a dark place, and I thought, for a little while, that you weren't real. That you couldn’t be," Cas says, a little sadly. When his fingers leave the handprint, Dean shudders at how cold the air gets again, even in the stillness inside the car. But the hand is just sliding up the side of Dean's neck. Cas's fingertip traces the curve of Dean's lips. Dean wonders what he'd do if Dean opened his mouth and sucked that finger in. "It... it wasn't the same. Not... not like... it wasn't."
He hears Sam’s gargantuan feet come stomping back. He hands Dean their big first aid kit over his shoulder. Dean looks back to thank his brother, but the look on his face tells him there's something else to worry about.
Uh, right, what was in that drawer did not look like a theory. Dean shrugs. "It's not something that needs help, it just is. I'll get used to it."
But Cas smiles, very gently. “That’s true, you’re right,” he agrees, “So. ‘The important thing is not to think much, but to love much; and so, do that which best stirs you to love.’”
Bobby's place is bookended by two old, defunct farms. They’ve been useful for various supernatural misadventures. In this case, there's an old barn that's mostly scaffolding and a second floor, sitting right off the angle of a set of crossroads.
Yes, Dean's not the only one who sometimes needs to be better at communicating... and just because they have a profound bond doesn't mean they can't have occasional disagreements. Especially when the world is ending. Poor Anna, though...
"What I did in the hallway was dangerous,” he continues, and he’s looking all serious again. “Souls and grace can be volatile if not handled properly." Cas cups Dean's cheek. "I’m sorry, Dean. Our connection is something I cherish, and I have no wish to abuse it. Ever."
Sam, beside him, is looking back and forth so quickly his hair is swinging. "There's... two of you? I thought..."
They haven't talked about it, really, but with some distance Dean can see that Cas probably had a good idea of everything going on in his head. He always does.
"Hey, we can't all be fancy professor types in suits!" Dean teases back. Then he leans a hip on the table. "Hey... you know what? Tell me about yourself."
Cas waves that off. There's something ancient and cold and sharp in his expression. Dean saw the smallest flicker of that when Cas went in and took care of Alastair. "You're right. He has reason to be suspicious of me. It's not that. It's..." His mouth purses. "He's... tainted."
Dean nods, his whole body fizzing with an electric warmth. He gets the feeling Cas went cruder on purpose. He doesn’t normally talk like that.
Dean grumbles, but suddenly that leaden feeling is back in his limbs—only it’s about one hundred times worse. He lets Cas untie his shoes and take off his socks. Dean's already shirtless, but the pants have to go. He finds himself tucked into the huge, surprisingly comfortable bed. Cas climbs in after him, down to boxers and a white undershirt. Weirdly, he wasn’t wearing one under his shirt a second ago, but Dean’s not about to ask..
Cas breathes out a long, slow breath, and looks down at where his fingers brush Dean's shoulder. "The angels aren't my brothers. Not really. I've seen what brotherhood really is.
—can be... disorderly." The finger he has tracing along Dean's cheek feels like a smile made tangible.
The woman, Amelia, nods and starts scooping out food from the dishes in the center of the table. Dean's stomach rumbles and he frowns at it. For once, he's not in the mood for that kind of game.
He doesn’t remember moving, but comes back to himself to find them pressed together against the passenger door. Cas is clutching him tightly, hand still pressing gently on Dean's shoulder. They're breathing hard, hell, they're just
"Don't worry about Castiel," she says, with that same horrible, emotionless calm. Dean really doesn’t like angels. "He's weak. But I'll take care of him."
They managed to get just enough clothing on in the bathroom to make some pretense at not flashing the world before they made it to their bedroom... fuck. It really is their bedroom, isn't it? It's the same bedroom where Dean nearly brained himself over a USPS box and they both laughed at how dumb it is to trip over clothes—where he pushed Cas down onto his back onto the mattress, and just looking down at him like that, wearing nothing but a white button-down draped loose and open over his shoulders, almost exploded Dean’s brain with how hot he was. This is where Cas put him down onto his stomach, fingered and fucked him in pretty much every way except actually being
They stare at each other for long seconds before they both remember that they have to move. Dean doesn't want to move, but he wants Cas naked more. They slide apart, barely, and take their own boxers off with shaking hands. Dean's, though, don’t even make it all the way off his left leg before Cas is back, straddling him again, rolling warm and firm and oh, yeah,
Jimmy, a bit to Dean's confusion, doesn't look at all shocked. Sure, he's let go of Cas's hand, and he's sitting back against the sofa with his arms crossed. (Also, he's still glaring at Dean.) "Hm," he says.
he mutters. "I wasn't the one who went toe-to-toe with Original Demon Barbie and ended up dead, okay?"
Cas's heel thumps against the back of Dean’s thigh like he's trying to pull him in, and Dean follows the motion of it—slow and steady, and Jesus fucking Christ. Cas lifts into him at the last little go of it, and Dean freezes, but under him, Cas lets out a low, shaky little moan. "Dean," he says, like he's anchoring himself.
Instead he shuffles closer, biting his lip with indecision and then lets out a long breath. The blanket hanging heavily at his shoulders slips off with a simple tug. Dean remains asleep, caught up in whatever dark web his own subconscious has spun for him.
"I'm not sure I can answer that," Cas answers, in a whisper. "My memories of you were very lovely, but you're already so much better than anything I can remember." His thumb traces torturous, tiny lines just around where the handprint aches and aches, deliciously, on Dean's shoulder.
Cas leans in a little closer, and his breath whispers over the curve of Dean's ear. "Not yet." Dean can hear him smiling. "It might hurt a little, but I'll try to distract you from it."
? Dean's been really patient and possibly just a little absent, but he's reaching a line. "I. Did not. Sleep. With her."
Well, generally, being near Cas can do things to his brain. But they're nice things, mostly, and Dean doesn't really have many complaints.
"Wait," Sam says, looking genuinely confused. His hair swishes over his shoulder as he tilts his head from side to side. "Twenty years? Four years?"
Cas blinks back at him with the kind of surprise a person gets when someone disrupts their routine. It's adorable. Dean reaches out and pulls him close. Cas's arms surround him, wiggling in without hesitation, and Dean presses his nose to Cas's neck.
Of “When we're all done here, we're gonna drive down to Florida. Take a fuckin' day on the beach. Couple of beers, stick our toes in the sand and throw shit at seagulls. You an' me, and—”
Dean halfway opens his mouth to note that Cas has got a better angle to reach in there, but then Cas rolls his hips again—this time with this little shimmy or twist or something—and their cocks slide side by side. And Dean does not want him to stop doing that, no, nope.
In the awkward silence, Cas finishes up his tiny breakfast and slowly pushes back from the table. "I'll bring Anna something to eat," he says, standing up, and busies himself putting together another small plate.
God, she looks like Cas. It’s not the color or the face. There’s something about the eyes, though, or maybe the way she holds herself.
the way his cock is disappearing into Cas’s body, Cas swallowing him up so easily, and holy shit that is… that is… really distracting in great ways.
"I didn't, um, specifically," Cas answers. "Um, I just said that we wanted to celebrate." He eyes the plates suspiciously. "I think that meant something different to them than to me."
Something sweet and hot touches the back of Dean's throat, colors his face. He gulps it down and clenches his teeth, looking away from those eyes in the rearview mirror. The road stretches out in front of him, nothing but trees and highway and the blast of trucks going in the opposite direction.
Dean's hands curl into fists. Before he can say any of the things on the tip of his tongue, Tessa comes back and asks for his help.
Castiel raises an eyebrow. "Despite the incredibly inconvenient parts, I think I might like it here."
They both laugh quietly after that, but it peters back off into the tense, scared silence of earlier.
He's about three seconds from screaming in frustration when Cas rests a careful hand between Dean's shoulder blades and, suddenly, it's like he can breathe again. Cas wraps Dean up from behind into the kind of hug you usually only get after you've been away for weeks or even months.
"Hey, Cas," he says, aloud—because he can, because the only person around to hear is the only one he wants to hear. "You don't... you know, if you're doing stuff, you don't have to come. I know you've got shit goin' on. But... I miss you."
More like an unshakable feeling that she knows exactly what's going on in his head and she understands it far better than he does. Dean does not like the feeling of being ‘understood’ when he has no fucking idea
Dean doesn’t try to cross the warding that he knows won’t touch him anymore. He goes around the back. He starts chopping wood. The sharp pain of the wound in his side stabs and stabs and stabs, but it keeps him here.
on the syllables, “Omnis immundus spiritus—omnis satanica potestas—" and both the demon on the floor and the one sprawled across Dean's hip start making that awful, familiar, choking noise, like they're gagging on hellfire.
This time, Cas laughs. "You do look very good like this," Cas says, appreciatively, and actually gives Dean the whole deal, the head-to-toe once over, obvious as a kiss.
"Whaddya think?" he asks the room at large. "Burn her, or dump her someplace where she’ll be found, so her family can have closure?"
. He’s Dean fucking Winchester, he’s no one a dick with wings should pity, but for some reason, he’s looking at a small glass vial whose pieces are strewn around on the floor. It’s been crushed. Whatever was inside it is gone. Underneath it, there’s a smear of blood gone old and brown.
Now Dean's starting to get frustrated. He's willing to be called ‘tiny’ and ‘unimportant’ and all sorts of things to save his brother's life. Or Cas's life. Or heck, to stop Lucifer. But if it's for some vague advice that won't help at all? Then fuck it.
Cas's hand settles on the small of his back. "Dean, you should sleep," he murmurs, and the low rub of his palm is like the best massage Dean’s ever had.
"So," Sam says. He wanders over to the lit-up Christmas tree, looking it up and down. It’s broader than Dean’s spread arms, and the star on the top brushes the ceiling: it took Dean, Jimmy and Cas to get it around the corners to put it into the living room, with Amelia “directing” (laughing). Claire learned a few new curse words that day. “Wow.”
"There better be a good explanation for this," Bobby says, sharply, before turning to Dean and crouching down beside him with a grunt that sounds like a silent complaint about his knees. "It's him, Dean. Unless you got a kind of monster that consecrated iron or silver doesn't cover, it's definitely him." Bobby pauses, and voices Dean’s own fears. “He’s not a demon, son.”
Dean can’t wait until Sam hears about this stuff, he’s gonna blow a gasket. Heck… he wonders what Pastor Jim would have thought of Cas. Of angels in general.
Then Cas's lips flirt just barely upwards. "Fantasies? Mmmm," he murmurs. His tongue smooths delicately along the bottom curve of his lip. His thumb slides higher, higher in small circles. He traces the lower edge of Dean's boxers with one hand, finger pads so close to Dean's groin and so far. "Would it be too much to ask..."
"Mother would wash your mouth out with soap," Castiel taunts. Dean decides that this brother—clearly, the one that’s not a tightass—needs some kind of a nickname. And not that abomination, 'Cassie.'
Cas is slumped on the bed, looking at his hands again, when Dean walks in. He looks up, blue eyes catching Dean’s,and they stare at each other, the few feet apart seeming like miles. Cas doesn’t say anything aloud.  From this close, their connection is full of regret and sadness and hope, and a lot of things that make Dean's stomach swoop.
Except there’s no glass on any of them. There’s a neat little ring of crushed glass around him, around Pamela, around Cas and Jimmy. It looks like salt circles. It looks like they were
Dean shudders, hands spasming over fabric, his hips juddering forward. He's half-hard and seeking friction. Dean is the master of digging his own goddamned grave, and for once he's really, really okay with that. "Yeah," Dean whispers before pulling Cas in for the dirtiest kiss he can manage while being wildly distracted by thoughts of Cas gasping awake, too desperate and hard to do anything but come.
Cas freezes briefly, every muscle locking into place before abruptly relaxing. A peal of laughter comes out of his mouth.
Dean goes softly, giving Cas slow, gentle suction into the wetness of his mouth. Cas makes another muffled noise and his hips rock carefully with it. He never goes farther than Dean has allowed, but it’s more motion than Dean expects, almost like Cas is unable to really stop himself. Jesus, that’s hot. Dean's dick makes another valiant effort, but no. He is 100% fucked out, and fine with that.
Castiel's eyes finally pry themselves away from Dean's rearview mirror. There’s a soft creak as he leans back in the seat. And then he… chuckles? Yeah, that’s what that is, low and intimate and all sorts of confusing right down Dean’s spine.
Cas gently disentangles their fingers, and runs a hand down Dean's hip. "Stuff?" he murmurs, and dammit, Dean has no idea what color his face is right now.
"Maybe. Some of it, there's... a lot about souls and grace and time and shit that I don't really get." Okay, that's about halfway a lie, but 'I just about come in my pants whenever he kisses my shoulder' is something that Dean's
Dean looks down at the beautiful knife in his hand, then at the closed door. Very slowly, he lifts his hand from Cas's chest and steps back just enough to carefully flip the blade in his palm. It's just as balanced as he thought it would be, and in his hand, it's as warm as Cas's skin, now.
“Very.” Cas’s mouth curves, sweetly. He sighs and tips his head to give Dean better access to his neck. "There's a reason I thought they were erotic dreams through most of my life."
Your double agent status is also up in the air, as far as I'm concerned, and I don't need an ancient Sumerian blade to kill one of your kind.” He bares his teeth in something barely a smile. “So back. The hell. Off."
"Maybe when we go back," Dean says, sinking comfortably down into the pillows. He's wide awake a second later when he realizes what he's thinking about.
"But he didn't wait," Cas adds. Sam's starting to look a little cornered, but he does crack his eyes open—slowly, like he thinks something on the other side might still blind him.
But Sam's expression is more pinched than Dean's seen it in a long, long time, and for Sam, that's saying something. His little brother’s arms are crossed so tightly that the tendons in his forearms are standing out where his sleeves are pushed up. He doesn’t seem to be feeling the winter cold, even though Dean wishes he pulled on a thicker jacket.
Cas pauses, and rests his chin over Dean's shoulder. He snakes a hand over Dean's ass, and Dean thinks maybe Cas is getting a little frisky again—hey, he's willing to see if he can get hard again, it wasn't exactly a normal kind of orgasm—but a second later, Dean feels... huh. Clean.
Cas laughs, softly. "Religious studies doesn't just mean 'Christianity,' Dean. I studied Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto, Islam. My Ph.D is in interdisciplinary texts. The only reason I don't know more about Satanism is that most sacred texts are ancient, and the modern Church of Satan was only founded in 1966."
"Swapping chores? Nah, man, I bet Sam and I would do that. If, y'know. We had normal chores." Gun maintenance doesn't count, and Dean doesn't let Sam near Baby's engine. Though maybe the whole research thing counts, 'cause in their world, that
Bobby stares at him, one eyebrow raised as if to ask, 'you done yet?' When Dean huffs and throws his hands out in frustration, Bobby shrugs. "I'm not saying we make a deal. I'm saying, we see what this guy says. Look, Death doesn't just make house calls for anyone, and he literally invited you to lunch. That's gotta mean something."
Dean is starting to feel slightly hysterical. Between the lack of sleep and the adrenaline of the last thirty minutes or so, he’s about a stone’s throw from losing it. "Well, not everyone can be perfect, like me."
Dean showers again, but when he comes out, Cas is still getting ready. Cas is definitely fully angeled up again, and he’s moving like he’s comfortable rather than like he’s got weights on his shoulders for the first time in a long time: he could probably mojo his way back into clothing.
Dean wonders if this thing they have really did manage to transcend time. It would explain some of the things he's experienced in life. The fact is, Dean enjoyed sex with women; it wasn’t like he did it ‘cause he was running away from something, though he always sort of figured it would make him happiest. And, for the most part, it did. With guys, though, it was more obvious that something was different, and maybe Dean always knew that. The few times he gave in and fooled around weren't bad, but they just left him feeling, well, hollow in weird ways.
So he gets his grin wider and swallows whatever's trying to choke him. "Then you need to be getting this shirt off me before I rip it off." He feels his smile turning a bit. "It's, uh, kind of stuck under me."
Cas turns a small smile upwards at Dean to let Dean know that he understood what he meant, not just what Dean, the dumbass that he is, actually said.
"That argument would work better if you weren't keeping me locked up like this," Sam mutters. “Also, she’s in a
Cas's back arches: he's directing Dean's fingers to the right spot, showing him how to please him and that's also something that makes Dean's brain fritz out briefly. Together, they find that place again and Cas, with his eyes closed and lip bitten to near-white, grunts in surprise and then starts rolling his hips in tiny little circles.
Yeah, just the sight of Cas looking so discombobulated gives Dean new strength to push himself back up to a sitting position. He looks down at himself. "Hey, no marks?" Dean hears himself ask. It's weird how he feels just the tiniest bit disappointed by that.
There's a trickle of something silvery-blue out of the side of Cas's mouth, and after a second of glow it resolves into ordinary blood. Dean's not sure that's a good thing. Neither's the way that Cas slumps in the back seat: he's normally pretty graceful. Dean's seen him go limp and boneless for other reasons, but not this way.
Dean's curious if Heaven knows if and how Death helped them, but he's not willing to ask. And, from what Dean has seen of the guy, if they know any better, neither are they.
"There's lube... in the drawer," Cas moans, pushing Dean back down so he's flat on the bed then giving him a sinuous, full body roll. Skin slides against skin and it's all warm and soft. Except where it's definitely not.
Instead Dean shifts the leg currently not being lavished with attention and wiggles around to hook his big toe into the elastic holding Cas's boxers up. Cas laughs against his skin when it works.
Dean has the sick feeling he's not talking about water. But he can't deny him that. He says, "Okay, okay. I'll be right back."
Dean snarls out the first accusation: “Well, I don't know when it happened. Maybe when I was in Hell. Maybe when I was staring right at you. But the Sam I knew, he's gone.” Everything is different and Dean didn’t ask for any of it. Didn’t need any of it (only maybe he did, but that voice is muffled, finally muffled).
Jimmy stares at them. Then he stares harder. Then just a little harder. "What?" He finally says, turning to look at Dean. "You're too good for a ring?"
" There's a hand on the small of Castiel's back, over his shirt--and then it's under his shirt, calluses scraping up his spine.
Dean’s thoughts drift to Cas, but Uriel, the invasive asshole, catches on real quick, dangling a shining vial through his fingers that’s almost too bright to look at. The junkless wonder threatens and taunts and cajoles, but Dean knows bullshit when he sees it.
But it's getting easier to accept as the seconds go on. After all, no djinn Dean's ever heard of lets anyone be this weirdly miserable.
Dean knows Cas is giving him alone time with Sam. He's always very careful about that, and Dean loves him for it.
Dean almost trips over their shirts on the floor when he hauls himself out of bed, and pulls jeans and another shirt and flannel on and grabs his Colt M19. But no one's screaming as he takes the stairs down two at a time, so shit, he really hopes that's a good sign...
This time it's Dean who encourages Castiel to lift a leg and wrap it around his hip, and that resettles them both in the best of ways. "Oh. Oh. Dean," Castiel can't help but keen quietly. The moisture they're both dripping, and Castiel only just realizes it
Dean groans happily, and his fingers tighten on Cas’s thighs when Cas's thumb strokes along the line of his dick, circling a little near the top, pressing perfectly at the edge where the head meets the shaft. Suddenly, Dean's hands feel empty despite the skin-warm cloth under his fingertips. He needs to touch Cas, all over. But more specifically, he reaches for the bulge Cas is sporting, the wet spot on the grey boxers looking already minutes old. Dean's fingers skim the shape of it and Cas moans, the sound filling the car.
Dean knows that Bobby's right. That's where their priorities are. Getting crackin' like that is probably just what Cas needs to get his mind off this, too.
Okay, so. Getting Cas off with his mouth? Fucking awesome. Getting fingered? Jesus Christ in a tiny canoe, Dean didn't know what he was missing. He's pretty sure that a lot of that is just Cas, but since he's also pretty sure Cas is just
It's the last time he sees Cas. But whatever Cas meant—whatever Dean’s brain was trying to tell him—the nightmares are better, too.
dog?" Zachariah’s voice reaches a pitch that might not be possible with human vocal cords. "You listen here, you little mongrel," and that's when he lays on hands, grabs Dean by the flannel shirt and shoves him against a wall. "We have work for you and you will do it."
kind of a possessive sonofabitch, but it's not the idea of Cas trying out this kind of thing with someone else that bugs him.
Then he, bold as brass and twice as daring, places his entire hand onto the mark on Dean’s shoulder—just fits his fingers right over it without even looking.
"Yep," Dean nods—though there’s something sort of hilarious about Bobby, of all people, talking about someone needing a shave. "That's him."
"Cheer up, mate," Crowley says, rolling his scroll back up jauntily. "You're saving the world, aren't you?"
I'm sorry, I am so sorry. I know, this chapter gave us emotional whiplash, too. But I'm going to flail apologetically in the direction of the tags right now, most especially the second to last! (While Ami, I think, is probably over there making cackling noises and pointing out that I spent a good deal of the editing of this chapter making it
"I'm here, Dean and it's real, I promise, this is all real," Cas murmurs into his hairline. He presses a kiss between Dean’s eyebrows. "It's okay, Dean. I love you, and I'm here."
"Homophobe? Really?" Sam's voice has reached the kind of screechy tipping point he used to hit regularly during puberty. Dean's kind of proud of that. "Dean,
Dean knots his fingers together in his lap and stares at them. "It’s just… staying in one place is hard sometimes, okay?” Dean still has moments where all he wants is to climb into Baby and just go. Just…
"His is made from a reforged angel blade," Cas explains, all calm-like. "It seemed more fitting for him to wear glorified brass knuckles on his dominant hand."
Dean parts them just long enough to pick it up and run his fingers along the surface—warm as blood, light and easy and comfortable against his fingers. Familiar. He turns and offers it to Cas.
in that slightly creepy way of most angels. Adam shuffles. He glances. He says, "I... um. Wow. I didn't know you existed. John never, uh, yeah."
The rest of the drive is more of the same. Sam glares off into the distance, sometimes typing on his laptop, sometimes listening to music, but mostly he's quiet. Waiting. Probably for what he expects to be Dean's eventual explosion.
"Hey, s’okay. Seriously," Dean says roughly, he hauls Cas closer, fits their bodies together. How easily that goes still delights and amazes him. "Just maybe, there's some stuff we should talk about? I need to understand this, okay? I—" Dean swallows. "I'm bad at faith, I'm bad at taking things on faith. With you, I can do it, but it's—tough to believe it.” Or trust it.
"Jimmy knew, maybe before I did," Cas whispers. "We shared a room for most of our childhood. He was privy to some of my dreams. And my nightmares." His head moves in a little jerk. “He was the one who would wake me up before my screaming woke up the rest of the house.”
The answer to that comes easy, though. "You don't gotta be better, bitch," Dean replies. "You just gotta be yourself."
"I like watching you get undressed," Dean says. He sort of regrets it the moment it's out of his mouth, because shit, that's a weird thing to say.
"Jesus fucking Christ, enough with the flirting!" Bobby barks, interrupting them. "Two idjits was bad enough, now there's three of you eggin’ each other on!"
"Told you you'd be okay," Dean says, gruffly. "But you gotta get off the floor, and we got to patch you up."
Dean doesn't know if it makes him feel better or worse that when Sam reads through the whole thing—it might as well be Greek, and for a second Dean thinks it actually
Dean nods. "I believe you." He's not sure what to feel. He's mad, yes, but he gets why Cas didn't tell him. He strokes Cas's neck slowly, waiting for that final blow. Cas is still too tense for that to just be it.
Cas is already in a defensive posture by the time Dean reacts. He's not used to hearing the wing beats when he doesn't know they're coming and it startles him briefly.
Washington D.C., especially, bothers Dean. The very concept of it is dangerous to who they are. God knows how many federal agents might remember his face from his Most Wanted years. Dean's just thinking about finding the closest motel to ground zero for their next stop when Anna appears.
“S’okay,” he says, and stands up to go rummaging through one of the locked cabinets in the living room. “You’ve got time.” Dean pulls out one of the cheap flip phones that Dean used to carry around a half dozen of, and pops in the battery. He checks to make sure it’s got the right numbers in it, and adds in Cas’s, pulling out the charger from the box where it’s rubber-banded into a neat coil. “This is for you. Not for… you know, you.” He rings a halo around his head with a finger. Cas makes an annoyed, deep noise, but he nods a tiny nod at Dean. They get each other: the bill on this phone’ll get paid every month up until they hear differently. “You call whenever, okay?”
Cas laughs a little gently against his ear. From anyone else, it might sound a little condescending. "That was where I started, too, with fingers," he agrees. The one hand that's still on Dean's ass tightens, carefully. "And I did enjoy that, that feeling. I do enjoy it. Touching myself there, the feel of being filled just enough."
Dean snickers and marvels at the very idea that an Angel of the Lord (Cas argues he's more an Angel of the Righteous Man, now, but Dean's uncomfortable with that comparison unless sex is involved) is sitting quietly on a couch in middle America, contentedly grading grad school papers.
Sam glances over at Cas. They seem to exchange about three quarters of a look between them, and Dean can almost feel the area heat up from the brain power that's steaming off the cogs in Sammy’s head right now. "Cas," Sam asks, "Did you know Lucifer at all? When you were... you know." He flicks a thumb in the direction of the sky.
Dean snorts in amusement, too giddy to do much of anything else. "I'll have you know, I'm a very hot commodity on the angel circuit. Every other day I got one popping in and demanding my attention."
That forces a soft chuckle out of Dean, though, and he leans in, gets his chin situated over Cas's shoulder. "Hey, uh... I think Sam's gonna be okay to come out tomorrow."
The look on Bobby's face, even out of the corner of Dean's eyes, makes it very clear he doesn't get it. "Dean, you havin' a seizure or something?"
Cas collapses forward and onto him before Dean's all the way done, though; Dean gets one last shivery, desperate roll into him, but Cas is whispering in his ear. "Yes, Dean," he husks, low and delighted, "Don’t stop. Keep going. Fill me up." He shivers all over when Dean gives him one last thrust, panting with exhaustion and pleasure.
stares at him from the doorstep, hand still up to knock. Adam, their lost little brother. Adam, who's dead, who's been dead, and never even knew he had brothers.
Cas's hand slides from his shoulder to squeeze Dean’s white-knuckled hand briefly before letting go entirely. "I left you there. I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself."
They don't stay in bed long, though. It's too tempting to lose themselves into something they don't have the spare time or energy for.
. Dean guesses that Crowley is playing the odds and assumes Bobby has some stereotype in him, but that just shows that Crowley isn't quite as all-knowing as he'd like them to think.
Over the next week or so, with a rougarou in Texas and a chupacabra in New Mexico, they're a little too busy for Dean to think about how crazy this is—how he spent the last few months pining for someone he thought was dead, how easy it was to fall into caring all over again.
He can work with that. A small adjustment, and he can finally slide in slow and steady. Heat engulfs him. It feels like forever, but really, he's barely half in and Cas gasps and shudders. A brief tightening around him makes Dean's toes curl.
"Sam," Dean says, a little too kindly. "I’m pretty sure you and Jessica didn't just say goodnight and scamper off to separate rooms."
Dean's not sure who's going to break the silence, because he can't exactly move from where he's standing without making his hard-on all the more obvious. Also, because he just got really conscious of the fact that he's got an angel blade in his gear, now, and they're going to have to figure out a way to explain that.
"Dean," Cas says before Dean can even get up a good head of steam about it. "You tended to me in the only way you knew how. In the end, it was exactly what I needed, and it brought me back to you. I would greatly appreciate it if you allowed me to return the favor, and let me take care of you."
Dean nods, but also, he’s getting the feeling there's going to be inappropriate heavy petting happening at the same time as this ‘sorting.’ (He's not opposed to the idea.)
Bobby loads him and Sam into the back of the Impala. They’re both pretty out of it. Dean can feel the engine of the Impala turn over once he’s inside, a warm rumble that never used to fail to make him smile. Until now. Now, it feels hollow. It feels like something else that’s going to make Dean’s bones shake apart.
Cas squeezes his other hand—hard enough to ache, hard enough to brighten down the weight of panic in Dean's chest. "Prophecy is flawed, Dean. I think even Sam understands this now." But Cas is just as urgent as he is as they charge in, Dean flashing a fake badge at the manager without breaking stride.
"Dean," Sam snaps, a harsh edge to his voice. "Look, Castiel, we owe you—Dean owes you. It's not just about whether you've got power or grace or whatnot, that’s not what he means."
He hooks a hand behind Cas's bent knee and pulls gently to get him a little further on top of Dean. Dean likes the feeling of a boneless, fucked-out Cas curled up against him, and Cas seems more than happy to pull in even tighter.
They take a breather to finish getting dressed and Cas presses a mug of coffee and an egg sandwich into Dean's hands. He desperately wants the coffee, and not so much with the food, but he eats it anyway.
Oh, fine, be a smug asshole when Dean’s too fucked-out to figure out a good comeback. He starts laughing, too, instead.
Dean laughs, too, bright and easy, and all over again he realizes how amazing it is to laugh like this while also being so turned on he might implode a tiny bit if his cock isn't tucked into someplace warm and wet soon.
“Sure,” Dean agrees. And, because he’s still the big brother, he starts sticking a bare leg out from under the covers. Sam gets out of there like there’s a werewolf on his ass and he’s out of silver.
They get her body out of sight quickly, and boy, does Dean not enjoy using the tarp in the trunk for this kind of thing. The motel lot backs up into a bunch of trees, and Cas incinerates her with some angel mojo. It's bright and hot, but quick. He doesn't look too exhausted after it, but Dean's gonna make sure his battery is charged up tonight anyway.
At first it seems fine. Cas is reluctant to relax as much as Pamela wants, but he gets there eventually. He closes his eyes, slowly, and his last open-lidded look is directly at Dean. His fingers tremble and twitch by his side before curling into a tight fist.
amazing," Dean agrees. Cas rolls his eyes. "And I dunno about you, but I like my memories of that night," Dean continues. Then he grins, pleased. "I get the feeling you'll be wearing my clothes again, today, these ones are pretty wrecked."
Cas spends a good long while lavishing the soft spot just under Dean's belly button, long enough that Dean's holding his breath every time his cock bumps into Cas's chin or taps the line of that scruffy jaw. But Cas just drops one kiss on the head of it, like a playful hello, before continuing downwards, exploring lightly along the underside of it and keeping on going right down.
Bobby's eyebrows shoot up, and he drawls, "Leave me outta your kinky shit," as he stands up from the table and walks into the kitchen.
Ruby's looking at this situation with her normal little sneer. "Well, well. So what's your role in this little party?"
Cas, if anything, goes smaller. He looks at his hands. His eyes flick just once to the curve of Dean's hip, the line of his spine. Dean wonders what he sees there. "Not Sam, no. Not unless he prays to me. And... as I am, possibly not even then. He’s warded, and…"
Dean can tell by the quality of light peeking through the threadbare curtains that it’s still early. Cas is warm and comfortable, and all Dean wants is to be just a tiny bit more selfish, just for a little while longer. He wants to keep his eyes closed and his nose buried in the soft cotton wrapped around Cas's chest.
Dean tenses further, because that just touches on a whole other nerve he's not in the mood to deal with.
"Let me," Cas says, gently, coming to kneel next to Dean. Jimmy's eyes get big and wet and round, whites showing at all corners. "I'm here, James. I'm here. I’m so sorry. They were following me, I couldn’t… Jimmy, I’m here."
Cas molds them even closer, whispering soft and filthy into Dean’s ear, his lips and tongue occasionally coming close enough to brush the sensitive shell. "Sometimes I'd wake up with my hand in my boxers, already stroking, so close to coming it happens before I'm even fully awake,” he rumbles, and the small noise Dean lets out at that is sort of pathetic. “Other times, I'd roll over and stick a pillow under me and imagine it was you. Oh, Dean... you have haunted my best dreams."
"Oh," Cas says. He reaches down and touches his ring, turning it around his finger. He doesn't blush, but the smile that curves around his eyes is even better than that.
Maybe it’s the ‘please,’ or maybe it’s because they all know about deals that blow up in everyone’s faces. But Sam actually nods, small and tight. He and Ruby go off to research.
, though, when Bobby scrapes off a corner of the devil's trap. He offers them a wooden box that looks, well...
human, the thought of—well. I preferred my original body." He gently pries Dean's head off his shoulder. Dean stares at him, something warm and wet on his eyelashes when he looks up. "I had to call in some very hefty favors, and do one or two of my own, to get my form back. It took more time than I expected."
When they do finally get into the room, Cas sort of stops, just staggering to the bed and sitting, instead of his usual routine of starting to ward everything in sight. Dean sits next to him and lets Cas lean into his shoulder and take shaky breaths.
Cas's hand turns and fingers tightens on his; Dean wants to just collapse from relief. He actually does bend down and press his forehead to their joined fingers. Cas strokes his hair briefly while Dean takes a few shaking breaths.
It takes three more tense days of following omens and trying to rescue babies (and sometimes, goddammit, failing) before Sam reaches out again. This time, it's through an anonymous email to Bobby disguised as some very remarkable spam. (No one’s ever said Sam wasn’t smart.) He forwards it along to Cas and Dean.
The first thing he becomes aware of again is Cas's hot, shaky exhalation against his skin, skimming over the handprint. Dean shivers with an echo of pleasure. He slowly relaxes the fingers in Cas's hair: they feel stiff and clumsy but Dean can't take much more stimulation over that patch of skin. Beneath him, Cas is also relaxing slowly, also fighting down the last small set of shudders going through his body.
But Cas just smiles and puts his finger into his book. He says "Hello," then shuffles a teeny bit more to the side as if he hadn't already left a big space there for Dean.
Dean's dick is aching to be touched. Sure, he wants that right the fuck now, but also, not quite yet? Because he thinks maybe that'll be the start of an amazing, but uncontrollable, frenzy. Or maybe an explosion.
"You can have it, if you want," he says, with a little chuckle. So he likes the idea of Cas in his clothes, ain't nothin' wrong with that. "That pattern looks damned good on you."
Dean grimaces. The thing of it is, Sam's great at this shit: putting clues together and asking the right questions. The demon blood didn’t really interfere with that, so much as made Sam kind of willfully blind to things that didn't fit his own narrative.
Dean calls Bobby just as soon as he's finished reading the message. Two days. It'll be two days. He can feel his heart beating faster, but he can also feel the tingle of electricity going through his bones.
"Hey, Cas," he says, softly. He reaches out. Cas reaches back, and their fingertips brush. "How you doing, buddy?"
Castiel doesn't know where the instinct to bite comes from, but every other instinct tonight has pulled those lovely noises out of Dean. He closes his teeth gently on the long strap of muscle, and Dean's thigh jerks upwards, inwards. They end up with Dean on top of him again. The thick rub of muscle presses firmly enough against where Castiel is aching that he feels... oh.
Dean loses time, memorizing the final feel of Cas's hand in his. The weight of it, the texture, the size. The way his fingers fit between his knuckles perfectly. It’s cold, but rigor has passed.
Dean thinks of the brightness of Sam's eyes when he had blood running down his chin, the thick smell of it on his clothes when he got into the house. His joy at hauling the demon out of Amelia.
"No." Dean and Sam say it sharply, together. Dean's not sure if they're answering the same question, though.
Not that Dean can blame him. He shoots a glare at the angel. He can’t possibly believe that that was what Cas was talking about—and also, what the fuck, that’s gross, especially since Dean’s seen just how Chuck writes sex scenes. But yeah, that was a lousy choice of words, Cas.
Then he blinks. Then grins. Huh. Okay, it might be a stupid grin, but Dean's pretty sure all his brain cells shorted, anyway. He can't be blamed for being stupid.
When he can't get anything else out, Dean reaches out with his other hand and touches Cas's face, fingers skimming his cheekbone and jaw, remembering what the feel of Cas's stubble does to the tips of fingers.
for those weeks when we thought the grace had killed him! The way you were acting, I was really worried you were gonna just… just fade away, or worse, get yourself killed, and I didn’t even know why! And now you’re telling me it was because of Castiel? This guy you'd known
His mouth curves in a small, humorless smile. He studies his thumbs. "Some of my brothers and sisters, as you've since learned, think that means that we angels are better than humans. They're wrong. We're just... soulless."
"'Because you're adorable?" Cas says, dryly, sitting down behind the laptop for one last check. He's made some kind of a spreadsheet of demon signs, and has been passing it back and forth with Bobby. Dean doesn't have to look at it to know they're getting closer and closer, though. He can feel it in his shoulders, in his bones. In the fact that Sam hasn't tried to leave them any messages in the past few days, even when they've caught up to places he's been.
He doesn't want to go back to sleep, he wants more of this: more of Cas heavy and warm under him, holding him just as tightly as Dean holds back. He wants endless nights like this, hour upon hour of feeling safe and cared for—knowing he probably doesn't deserve it, but also knowing that Cas, for reasons beyond Dean’s understanding, thinks he does.
Cas frowns, a bit more tension settling into the lines of his mouth and eyes. "...Where's your ring?" he asks, shakily.
Dean knows there's nothing to forgive—not as far as Cas goes, anyway. Maybe Cas didn’t make it in time, but Dean’s the one who made all of his own choices.
Castiel blinks, slowly, and raises a hand to feather his thumb along Dean's bright pink cheekbone. "If you think we need condoms," he suggests, tentatively, "I have some." Sam had made sure he was well-equipped. That had been a very awkward talk.
