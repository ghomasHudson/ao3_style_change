“Come on, get your shirt off.” Sam said to Dean. He executed the order, taking his shirt off and putting it aside, next to the feather. He sat on a chair close by, Sam sitting in front of him. He needed to draw symbols on Dean’s chest and back with lamb’s blood mixed with burned stinging nettle. He dipped a paintbrush in the mixture and started copying Rowena’s drawing he had on a piece of paper. Dean stood still while his brother worked.
“She’s got a very large collection of books on lore, and not only European, but from every part of the world” Sam added. “This could change things, Dean. Anja has always been interesting in the afterlife and it seems she’s got quite the collection from what Garth has told us.”
“No…I think Amara’s warding is strong.” Castiel looked at Jack “It’s about me…and Dean.” He looked up to the ceiling and back at Jack “Someday, I might want to be human with him. And I need to know, when this day come, will you make me human?”
. Repeating the words in his head like a mantra. To avoid thinking about anything else. If he were not careful, the words would echo in his head, out of the blue.
The sun was shining high in the sky and there were few clouds, it was a beautiful day. Dean wore his coat to protect him from the cold, Miracle was by his side, jumping in the mud. He sighed at the sight, he’d have to wash her, again. Maybe he should consider going to one of those dog groomers, her hair was getting out of control and he was a poor groomer. The thought alone made him chuckle, Dean Winchester bringing his dog to a groomer…what had happened to Dean Winchester the monster hunter? His life had changed since he stopped hunting, but even more so since Castiel came back from the Empty. Since then, his life had been almost…normal. Dean Winchester the normal guy. It sounded weirdly good.
“No Cas. She wouldn’t want you to.” Sam shook his head. “She cares about you too; she wouldn’t want to put you in danger.” He drank his coffee, sighing.
“Nine hours?” Dean was shocked, he usually slept four of five hours, on good nights. “I didn’t have you close to me, before.” he continued, making Cas smile even more. God, he loved his smile. His lips. “Did you…wait well?” What else could he asked… the situation was so right but also very new and awkward.
“I can’t just look at her, waiting for her to…go mad and die.” Castiel’s eyebrows were furrowed in frustration.
“Jack! We need you.” Castiel called, feeling something weird. Like if the line was disconnected, like if no one was on the other side. No angel radio. Nothing. And as he concentrated, he realised he couldn’t reach Heaven at all. He felt worry fill him, what if something had happened to Jack? What if he was in danger too?
Sam had moved and stood behind them, they were all looking at the computer, analysing the screen, trying to recognize…something.
“Oh, wow…” looking in awe at the bottle. “This tastes like the first drink I ever shared with my dad” he said, smiling a little.
“Thanks Sammy.” He clasped his brother arm and let him go. Sam nodded, saying something to Castiel before leaving the room. The angel glanced at Dean before answering Sam, concern in his eyes.
“I’m not. I’m not at peace.” He said, gazing into the angel’s eyes. “This is important. You listen to me now or I don’t know if I’ll ever get the courage to say it again.” He pleaded.
Dean had fallen asleep in spite of himself, head resting on a book in the library. He snored lightly as Cas looked at him, worried.
“We are…he’s here.” Amara posted herself before them “I wanted to come in person, and I know the warding.”
, you need to talk to me.” he said, slowly getting up and resting his hand on his brother’s shoulder. Dean was silent and felt the warmth of his brother holding him.
Dean looked at Jack without knowing what to say. He did hear weirder things in his life and he knew Chuck had absorbed Amara before being devoid of his powers, he just thought she was stowed away, trapped inside. But Jack was not Chuck. Of course, Jack had reached out to her, of course she was her friend now. Because Jack was just good like that.
“Do you?” Dean asked, looking him in the eyes. “Then why did you think I didn’t feel the same? Why did you think it was enough for me
“Cas…Just get some rest. And if you’re feeling better after, I’ll take you on a ride outside. It’s beautiful today.”
“Dean…” Castiel had a hard time to focus “I don’t want to ruin the pie. I need to keep an eye on it.”
“It’s me.” Dean said again, catching Castiel in his arms, holding him close. “It’s me.” he hugged him tight and whispered “You’re safe. We’re safe.” And he felt Cas’ arms hugged him back. “We’re safe.”
“Yeah? Good. ‘Cause it’s weird, painting you half-naked with lamb’s blood.” Sam laughed “Don’t laugh! I can’t mess up Dean!”
When he got there, he found the furry animal balled up on his bed, peaceful. He thought he’ll wait for her to wake up. He didn’t want to perturb her rest. He sat carefully on the bed, resting his head on the wall behind him. He picked up the photograph that Claire had give him earlier during the week. He brushed it fondly, looking at
“Well, what it says Dean, of course. We need a part of Castiel. Without it, you will never find him in the Empty.” she answered.
“Seriously? Who got worried for my comfort as a dead man?” He said, laughing and looking around the room.
Dean was dumbfounded and must have looked like a complete idiot, mouth opened, looking at everyone and no one in particular, scanning the faces around him. Back to Eileen.
“I promised you an outing anyway.” Dean closed his eyes, still recovering from Cas’ fierce kissing session. They were holding onto each other, unable to part. “I think you should call Jack now.”
When he realised what was nestled inside, his heart skipped a beat. He escaped a sound caught in his throat. He went back to sit down on the bench to anchor himself.
“I’m sorry. I have no cell reception in Heaven.” Jack said tilting his head. Dean looked at him, he couldn’t be mad at him anyway.
He had left the library punching a wall on his way, splitting his knuckles, leaving blood behind him. Sam was left to deal with Rowena alone. The little brother picked up the list and read it once again, the last ingredients burned on his retinas.
“Yeah, well… I guess you never forget you first nest case.” Dean simply replied, cleaning off the vamp’s blood on a dirty rag that was laying in the barn. He handed the rug to Sam and put the machete back into its sheath. He walked over the impaled vampire and stopped, looking at the body hanging from the rebar, its head laying inert on the ground a few steps further.
“Dean!” Sam tried to put his brother back into his bed. “DEAN!” Sam’s voice resonated in the room. “Would you stop!” He pushed him back on the bed.
Dean snorted. “Right. That’s me right there.” He rubbed his hands on his jeans, trying to warm himself, he’d been there for too long and his fingers were becoming numb. “I just wish we could make Jack appear to help us, y’know?” He sighed, reaching for Cas’ warm hand to hold.
“Thanks, good luck to you too, bye!” Sam ended the call. He explained the situation to Eileen quickly and looked at his brother who seemed pensive.
“It’s okay if you did…It’s not a secret.” Castiel’ breath was on his neck, making him feel all cottony. “I want to please you any way I can.”
Dean had been gone for some time now and Castiel was getting worried. He went out to walk and clear his mind in the middle of the night, without even telling where he was going.
“Maybe it reminds him of happy memories.” Jack sighed. “I can’t do anything more. I’ll check on him later. I need to get back to Heaven now. Pray to me if he wakes up.”
“Yes… He’s all alone, Dean. And the angels… they might not be all be on his side.” Cas frowned in concern “I’m worried for him.”
“Dean!” Cas’ body was shaking with pleasure, he moaned without knowing and whimpered Dean’s name in Enochian…he was completely lost in his touch. “I-I…huum” He stroke Dean’s hair with his other hand, tugging at it. Dean moaned and it reverberated on Cas’ dick, he could feel that the angel wasn’t going to last long. He bobbed his head and took more of him inside, sliding his tongue down his length. He cupped Castiel’s balls in his hands, caressing them, and this was it. Castiel’s back arched, his hand curled around the sheets, crying out Dean’s name. Dean jolted as the lights flickered and exploded in the room. He didn’t stop. Dean had never felt that when pleasuring someone, he was so close to the edge too. He swallowed Cas’ hotness and swiped a finger on his lips. He let go of Castiel’s hand gently. In all of his dreams it was someone doing this to him, not the contrary. But it had felt so good doing it for Cas. So good.
“You need more sleep” Cas rolled his eyes and Dean looked at him, amused. Castiel had brought a pot of coffee on the table, hot and ready to pour.
“Cas gave you something? What? For me?” Dean blurted out, hundreds of questions clattering in his brain.
Dean reached for his face, softly grabbing the side of the angel’s face, making the angel slightly startle, turning him towards him again.
“You saved me, in Hell and in life. I want to spend…the rest of my life with you. I want to make you happy like you make me happy.” Dean exhaled and nestled his face in Cas’s neck, tasting the mint and honey. “I love you.” During all these years he couldn’t accept it and now he couldn’t stop saying it.
He turned around, looking nowhere in particular, trying to think. What the hell was he going to do? How could it had gone bad so quickly? He tried to focus, think of solutions. He didn’t even know what monster it was. He paced around the room, trying to reach Jack but felt nothing on the other line.
Sam and Eileen are working a case up north. Jack pops by to ask Castiel a favour and to help him get out of the bunker. Dean is finally better and tries opening more to Castiel. The angel wants to be closer to the hunter, intimate, but don’t know how to show his feelings. He’s afraid of hurting Dean unintentionally and restrain himself, to Dean’s frustration. Though he understands the angel is reluctant, he thinks it’s not for the good reasons. Dean is scared too, but not in the same way. He has the opportunity to explore feelings he repressed for years; he wants to share more with the angel but is still clumsy when it comes to expressing his emotions.
“You don’t know how the laundry machine works” He chuckled. And Castiel rolled his eyes, making Dean smile. “I’m sorry. I know it’s not my decision.” He rubbed his eyes “It’s just..”
“You’re not Dean. Dean is on Earth. You’re the Empty. You’re using me.” He answered confused, closing his eyes and putting his hands on his ears, mumbling to himself. No…not mumbling…singing.
He heard something he had not heard in a very long time. Feathers. Wings rustling. And he saw him. Standing close to the water ledge. In his damn trench coat. Just a shadow in the sunset. Still, he would have recognized him anywhere.
“Yes! No!” Dean was confused too. “No, I’m happy to see you… I missed you that’s all.” He hugged him again. “I’m sorry I yelled.”
He was so tensed he almost let a jar slipped out of his hands. Eileen had great reflexes and caught it just in time, closing her eyes in relief.
“He’s alright. How could he not be with a father like you?” Dean brushed Castiel’s face, making the angel melt at the sight of his soft green eyes.
“Well, yes Dean. I could always see it. He could see it too, I think. It’s ye, who were harder to convince. As evident as it was.”
“I don’t know… I never found a witch powerful enough to break the encoding spell, no one in my family ever did. But nothing happened to us either. It might not be dark magic at all.”
“I don’t know. Nothing is…wrong with him.” Jack answered, tilting his head. “I checked, he’s … alright. I replenished his grace, I healed him…I can’t do anything more.” He shook his head. “It’s like he’s
“Hmmm…yes, yes.” Dean’s eyes were closed, the pain of Castiel being out of him starting to be too great for him “Cas... I’m yours”.
Hearing Dean pronouncing his name like that made Castiel’s heart melt. He held him in his arms, leaving a kiss on his head.
Dean shook his head, coming closer to the angel, pouring himself a cup of coffee. He leaned over to kiss him, the hot beverage in his hands. His lips were soft and warm. “Thanks.”
“He’ll be along.” Bobby said, understanding Dean. “Time up here it’s…it’s different.” he continued. “You got everything you could ever want, or need, or dream…” Bobby explained. “So, I guess the question is: what’re you gonna do now, Dean?” He asked.
He was left alone with the angel and his worry. He sat in Jack’s chair, because it was closer to the angel. Castiel looked so peaceful. Dean pushed some of Cas’ hair aside to better see his face. He reached out and held his hand. Warm and soft.
After finally confessing their love to each other, Dean and Castiel are closer than ever. That doesn’t mean Dean is completely sure about what he’s doing with the angel about these feelings. As he takes time to think about what it could really mean for his life and his future, Castiel tries to conduct his life in the bunker as human as possible, without the help of his grace.
“That’s…” Dean tried to say the words. But couldn’t. He wanted to tell Sam that those were the last words
could get it for you, of course.” Rowena proposed. “I’m the Queen of Hell after all, it comes with its perks.” She was going to snap out of the dungeon, Sam could feel it.
“Dean?” Cas stopped their kissing, breathing hard. “I sense strong…feelings emanating from you. It’s hard to ignore.”
He let his hands slide slowly off the wheel and rested them on his lap. He had one last hunt to finish really. Not a monster hunt. A hunt that would hurt like hell, that would be long and tenuous, whisky-filled all-nighters and sleepless nights. But he already got the last part covered anyway. He knew he should stop drinking himself to sleep, talk about it. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t talk about
After Bobby left, it was only Dean and Sam in the room, finishing to pick up the last bottles laying around the table. At some point Dean stopped to look at his brother. His baby brother who had sacrificed more than once for him, and for whom Dean had also sacrificed.
“I…what?” Dean squinted his eyes, but as much as he tried, he couldn’t remember anything past when he caught Castiel in his arms. “What?”
“It’s better if it’s Jack anyway, he’s more powerful than any of us, more than the Empty even.” The brush slid on Dean’s skin forming a circle on his chest. He felt a tingling of energy coursing through him. “Turn around, I need to get this on your back too.” Sam continued.
Cas kissed him back, softly at first and then fiercely, wanting more, only stopping to let Dean breathes and to look in his eyes. Green, soft, and undoubtedly… loving.
Dean finally told Sam what happened in the dungeon moments before Cas was taken by the Empty, and finally acknowledge that he’s in love with the angel. Both brothers are more determined than ever to break into the Empty. With clues and leads coming from all around, they feel like they are nowhere closer to an answer but keep on going anyway.
“I’ll take the week with Eileen then.” He said, while getting up and leaving his fork and plate in the sink. He left the kitchen and the dishes for Dean to wash and clean, very passive-aggressive of him, Dean thought.
“Please Cas…Please” Sam cried, hopeless “Please…” He turned around and Dean could see the motive of his distress laying behind him. It was Eileen, her stomach was bleeding or had been bleeding heavily and she had tears of blood rolling down her face. She seemed to be unconscious.
“It’s me, and I can prove it.” Dean said, slowly getting the tape recorder from the nightstand, keeping his eyes on Castiel, to see his reaction. He was still prostrated on the bed defensively, looking weirdly at Dean, studying his every moves. Dean gently ejected the cassette from the player, giving it to Castiel. The angel carefully read it. Again, and again.
Dean was already getting up. He got dizzy and stopped. Closing his eyes, and grabbing the edge of the bed, trying to find his balance.
“The books are very old, so she’s going to work on them first and send what she thinks will help us after” Bobby added.
Of all the issues raised with becoming human, Castiel had not thought that Dean would be afraid for his life first. For Castiel, he was more in danger facing the Empty as an angel than as a human facing life and its potential threats.
“Hmmm… Jack?” Dean’s eyebrow was raised “Who are you talking to?” And it was like Jack wasn’t even listening to him. “Jack!” Dean snapped his fingers in the air.
Dean’s heart raced, he wanted to tell him how he felt, so much. But he couldn’t. He didn’t know why. He wanted to but he…couldn’t. He was afraid of something intangible, something eating at him. He loved him, he was afraid of losing him, he wanted him like he never wanted anyone, so much it hurt. He didn’t think he deserved the angel’s love. He was terrified.
“Yes, only you. Those were his words.” Jack continued “I thought…since it’s your birthday, I could give it to you now. And… you deserve something of him too.” He gave the box to Dean who stared at it for a moment, mouth agape.
“Yes…at first, she was pretty silent but she’s more vocal now, it’s like she’s always here with me.” Jack smiled. “She reminds me of my mother sometimes, she’s very…caring in her own way.”
“Well, this is linked to God…or at least God’s powers. If you can summon the ‘powers’ here, it’s Jack we’re summoning.” Castiel eyes shone “I know the spell. Come on!” He got up, extending his arm towards Dean to follow him. “I can’t believe I haven’t thought about it before!”
“I need your help. I can’t do it by myself. And Amara… it’s new for her too. She never knew Heaven like you did.”
He glanced at Dean sometimes, when they were sorting through dried leaves and flowers, without him knowing. He picked up on every detail, his freckles, his laughing lines sliding around his eyes, his lips slightly parted when he was concentrating, the green pools in his eyes.
It was one day before Dean’s birthday. He didn’t want to celebrate. What was there to celebrate? He laid in bed, motionless. He heard Miracle coming out of the room, surely running somewhere to find Sam and ask for her walk.
“Where is he? He should be here by now!” Dean looked at his watch, the sun was almost gone and the full moon was going to appear any minute now. They needed to perform the spell at the first rays of the full moon.
be here? But he let none of his thoughts transpire, as usual. He stayed still on his chair while Bobby handed him a beer out of a cooler. He took it, reflexively. Without thinking, he didn’t know what to think. He needed to know more.
“No. I want to do it. If I need to get back in there to bring Cas back…that’s what I’ll do.” Dean took a step closer to Sam, putting his hand on the doorknob. “Plus…it would be good to see Rowena again.” And opened the door.
Castiel opened the bunker’s door, stepping inside. Dean was in the garage and would be here any minute now. The angel had loved their outing, as short as it had been. Seeing Dean like this…so peaceful and happy… It made him feel even more love for him. It was almost like something had shifted in Dean, pieces of himself slowing clicking into place.
Dean couldn’t help but chuckled “You’re strong Claire. Maybe I will come.” He sighed. She got up and pulled something out of her pocket. It was a paper, a little wrinkly.
Sam walked in Dean’s bedroom. Sighing at the sad sight of his brother lying in bed. Again. He placed a cup of black coffee on Dean’s nightstand and carefully put Castiel’s photograph up against the lamp, safe away from the liquid. He went out without a word, grabbing Miracle’s leash on his way out. Dean rolled on his side, looking at the mug. He sat on his bed, put on his headphones and hit “play” on his tape player and
Dean went out of the Bunker to walk Miracle. Both because she needed a walk and just to get out of the bunker. It was a sunny day but it was still chilly outside, so he had put on a light coat. He walked for twenty minutes, throwing sticks for Miracle to pick up. When he came back to the bunker, he had mud all over his boots. He entered by the garage as to not get dirt everywhere and removed them. He went to his room to hung his coat, grabbed a coffee and headed for the war room where Sam, Bobby and Eileen were.
“I…okay, I won’t.” Jack closed his eyes for a few seconds. “It’s done. I can’t read your mind anymore.”
Dean looked at Charlie, perplexed. She might have picked up on his “resting eyes” more than he thought. “Nah, I’m good.”
He grabbed the plate and rested it on them, balancing him on their legs, he guided her hand towards the sandwiches and she grabbed one of them. He kissed her on the temple and turned towards Cas and Dean.
“It blinded her Dean, it blinded Eileen” Sam was crying “She can’t see. You should have seen her; she was so scared.” Dean hugged his brother, closing his eyes. Castiel was next to Eileen, his hands hovering over her head.
“Dean…” Cas’s hand searched for him in the darkness of the room. Dean grabbed it and laid himself on him, spread over the angel. He still had his eyes closed; his skin was hot to the touch. “This was…”
“No. You’re not using your grace.” Dean looked at him serious. “I got this.” He left the room and Castiel could hear him calling the dog.
“In his bedroom, dumbass!” Sam continued, exasperated “No wonder you remember nothing, you passed out!”
Dean was fighting those vampires with everything he had, Sam was doing just the same, but the vamps were more than they had anticipated. Nevertheless, they were determined to kill those sons of bitches,
“Jenny? Dude… I completely forgot about her.” Sam was amazed that Dean had remembered. He held his machete down, and the blood was slowly leaking onto the barn’s floor.
Cas tilted his head, pushing onto Dean’s hand, marvelling at his touch. He had never felt this. In all his millennia life. His joy overpowered any reasonable thought he could have had. He would do anything for the human in front of him. Anything for Dean. He would say it again, and more.
“Come on, get your legs up” Sam said to Dean as he eased him on the bed. Dean laid himself on the bed with a wince.
“I’m getting him out! GET OUT OF MY WAY!” He shouted back, blasting the shell of Lucifer with all the power he could muster. The Empty exploded in black goo everywhere, sliding off, only to reform itself in a multitude of Lucifers around Jack and Castiel. Jack looked at Cas, still sound asleep. He ran to him, grabbed him hard and dragged him away. He was so close to the rift now… he couldn’t give up. He was getting him out. The Empty materialised in front of him. Lucifer with his wings spread, eyes burning red.
“Cas…” Dean said after taking a breath. He looked into the angel’s eyes. So blue. So beautiful. He brushed his cheek, fingers rubbing on his stubble. “I love you too.” He kissed him again, fiercely. Nothing in the world would have been able to stop the hunter. He was lost in the angel’s touch. His exhaustion flying away. The burning ache in his chest replaced by bliss and desire. He breathed and kissed him again, unable to stop. Cas kissed him back, more confident than before, gently pulling Dean’s hair in the process, savouring the taste of his lips and tongue. He pushed Dean back into the bed forcefully, lost in his passion, making him wince. He stopped at once, wide-eyed.
Then after what seemed like an eternity, Dean felt something twitching in his hand. Castiel’s fingers, slightly moving. Lights flickered in the room. He could see Castiel’s eyes move under his eyelids.
Cas started getting the clothes off of Dean, he stripped his own clothes shoving them in a corner of the room. He grabbed Dean with ease and laid him on the bed with a thud, making him grunt.
Cas’ hand reached lower, he was still looking at Dean, analysing his reactions. He moved Dean’s legs up, close to his chest. His finger entered his hole gently, making Dean gasp. He tightened his grip on Castiel, looking in his eyes. The angel went back and forth, smiling at him and at the sounds he was letting slip out of him.
At some point in the evening, Sam walked around the bunker to check on everyone, tired of working on the computer all day, plus Bobby finally understood the videocall thing by himself, mostly anyway. Sam was amazed by the work that had been crunched in one day and was starting to get really hopeful for the week. If
“I’m going to check on Sam and Eileen, bring them some sandwiches maybe” Dean said after hours of research, his eyes fighting sleep, dark circles around them.
“Yeah, it must be around 4pm or something in Germany… I can probably get a hold of her now.” Sam nodded, and tapped Dean’s shoulder. “Move, I need to use the computer.” Dean moved without protesting, and went to look for another chair. He was hopeful, he didn’t want to be disappointed but, he felt like this could change things. This was the most intriguing lead they had. The book was so old. There must be something, somewhere in it, that could potentially help him get Cas back. He came back, a wooden chair in hand. He sat between Sam and Eileen, the back of the chair to his chest, his legs stretched on either side. Sam was calling Anja on some videocall software Dean didn’t recognise. After some time, the “please wait” screen was replaced with the face of a fifty-something blonde woman.
“I love you too, Cas.” Dean voice was low. Cas felt a slight tremor in Dean’s chest, making him worried. He quickly sat up to look at Dean. He was crying.
Dean finally went to shower. He had not realised he was this tired. He decided he was going to make a plan tomorrow. But first, he needed sleep, if he could get any. He went back to bed, Miracle sleeping at his feet. The lights in the corridor turned off by Sam, surely, who came to check on his brother before turning in. He thought he was discreet but Dean knew about his night rounds.
He stayed like this for a moment, gazing at the skies turning into hues of yellow, warm orange and pink. He thanked Jack silently for this moment of peace. If only Ca…
The sun had set for… three hours now? Maybe five? Dean had completely lost track of time, he didn’t even put on his watch and had lost his phone somewhere in the bunker. He was drowned in books in the library, each with a cover stranger as the other, some he suspected were made of skin but he wasn’t sure of what…or who exactly. He did not want to think about it. He needed to stay focused. He kept on translating the pages on Sam’s computer. And the translations were getting him nowhere closer to an answer. But he couldn’t stop, not now. Not ever. He had promised himself. He would find a way.
Jack made his come-back after months of silence after Dean prayed to him on his birthday. Jack gifted him with the most unexpected of present: a feather of Castiel’s and a letter addressed to Dean. Though he still works hard on rebuilding Heaven, he still pops by to see Sam and Dean.
“I…just did. We did.” She paused, getting closer to him, a hand on his. “Dean… you know when it’s the right person. You know… when you decide to be loved. When… you’re willing to accept it. That’s when you know.”
“Cas…everything. You did everything. Never think otherwise.” he kissed his forehead “You’re…everything to me.” Dean’s eyes were starting to water from the emotions. Cas made him so vulnerable.
“Well, it’s a good thing we worked on the translation then!” Kaia turned her computer around, the screen facing Dean. He squinted his eyes to better see the words and began to read the chapters marked by the girls. His eyes were tired after a week spend on computers. Meanwhile, Sam was getting a copper bowl ready and some other instruments and ingredients to prepare his call. As Dean kept reading, he stopped at one paragraph in particular, he could see Claire looking intense next to him, raising her eyebrows.
“And your mom and dad…” Bobby continued... He could see Dean’s face changing, beginning to get hopeful. “They got a place over yonder” he told him, still waving in the distance. It was starting to really hit Dean that he was in fact in a new and improved Heaven.
It was weird seeing Castiel without his trench coat. He was wearing ‘normal clothes’ now. He didn’t want to wear the clothes he had in the Empty anymore. He borrowed clothes from Dean’s and Sam had picked up some jeans around town. He was wearing a purple flannel, one of Dean’s favourite.
“I want to make you feel good. Let me.” Dean whispered in his ear, sending tingles through Cas’s spine. Dean then proceeded moving his mouth lower, lower. His stubble brushed against Castiel’s inner thigh, and when Dean licked him there, he could feel the angel shiver beneath his hands and mouth.
“Sometimes? Yes...every time.” Dean chuckled “Next time…it’s your turn.” He sighed “I never thought I would be the one to…” He took a breath “You’re amazing.” He snuggled closer to the angel. “Castiel.” He whispered, like a holy word.
“Dean?” Cas softly said, throat closing as he repressed tears from falling. He lost his balance from the revelation.
“Yes, I do. The spell is good. The ingredients too. We have Jack with us.” He looked in his brother eyes. “It’s going to be
“Och, sweet Samuel… I canna work my magic on copies alone. I need the real book in my hands to perform a ritual.”
“Don’t get me wrong. I’m glad you want out. But…” Sam stopped himself, not knowing if he should continue on his line of thought.
The morning passed as people read books of all forms and horizons. Books on celestial entities. Books about death. Books on witchcraft. Books on anything. Piles were forming. Unfortunately, it seemed the “most promising” piles were not as high as the “least promising” piles. Dean took a break to walk around, get some blood moving in his legs. Sam and Bobby were talking with hunters and contacts from everywhere. Dean passed them by and stopped to see who they were talking to. He smiled when he saw Garth’s face on the screen.
“That I can’t reach anyone Dean! Not Jack, not anyone! Not even the angels!” Castiel closed his eyes, trying to listen again.
“Well, I did live in an apocalypse world so… I know a thing or two about tough times.” She laughed. “What is it really about? Something happened?” Charlie asked, serious again. She could see he was on the verge of collapsing underneath his pain, anyone with two functioning eyes could have seen it. “Is it about Cas?”
“It’s okay. You don’t have to tell me now.” Castiel reassured him, kissing him back softly. Dean exhaled; he had not realised he had stopped breathing. “I can feel that you are much better today.”
Dean woke up at the smell of coffee invading his nostrils. He opened his eyes, hearing voices. What time was it? What happened?
“When I kiss you, I feel very…human.” He finally said. “In a good way. I feel pleasure coursing through me.” He glanced at Dean who was devouring him with his eyes. “Do you…feel the same?”
“A colour code? Seriously?” Dean chuckled. He was amazed at their efficiency; he could never be this organised. Except maybe when cleaning guns and fixing Baby.
She reached out to him, pulling him closer and kissed him. She looked around, resolute. “One day.” They looked at each other, not understanding. “Wait one more day.” Sam traced to letters in her hand to Dean’s amazement.
could love like that.” Dean exhaled. “I wish you were awake so I could tell you.” He continued “Please Cas. Please. You have to wake up.” he paused and whispered “Please come back to me. Come back to me”.
“You don’t know?” Dean said shaking his head, “You don’t know, and you came anyway?” He added, truly flabbergasted.
“I will. Always.” He said back, locking him in his embrace, holding onto him like he could disappear any minute. Dean nestled his face in the crook of Castiel’s neck, safe.
“Cas…” Dean had gripped Cas’ arm, trying to make him look at him. He wanted to see him. The angel understood anyway and locked his eyes with Dean’s. His chest felt hot and his lungs were like fire, it was so beautiful seeing these green eyes full of lust and pleasure. Dean’s pelvis moved slightly and Cas hit something in him causing him to moan very loudly. After his first encounters with Dean’s moan of pleasure he thought he had hurt him but soon discovered it was all but the contrary. He thrusted his cock in him, hitting the same spot, their breath mixing as Dean breathed out, holding Cas’ face as close to his as he could. As their foreheads touched each other, Castiel’s hand found Dean’s dick, stroking him. And just hearing the sounds coming out of his mouth, Cas moaned back. He felt like he was close.
“We wasted so much time, Cas, so much.” he hiccupped “I should ha-have told you sooner.” He exhaled sharply.
The angel walked towards his room, removing his coat when entering. He didn’t really need it but going out without it would have been conspicuous. He put his boots beside the door. Everything was quiet inside; the warding was still holding and after a check-up he concluded that it didn’t need improvements or do-overs. Eileen had done a great job with it. Still, he felt like it wasn’t the best protection... his grace threatened him and anyone close to him. Even with the warding in his vessel, a mistake could potentially bring the Empty back.  He heard a small knock on the door and Dean entered, putting his boots aside with a thump and closing the door behind him.
“I know.” Dean said breaking into a smile. He sat straighter on the bed, composing himself. “Could you…say it again? For me?” he murmured with pleading eyes. Even if someone had been in the room, only Castiel would have heard him. They were so close he didn’t need him to speak any louder.
“You’re picking up Eileen today, that’s your week off. Use it. And if I find nothing after, then I’ll let you help.” Dean answered and quickly added “That’s not negotiable.” Sam looked a bit pissed but said nothing more to bother or anger Dean.
And as he was driving, his thoughts started to settle. Now he could go see his parents. He could see his mom again, he would have to explain about Jack of course, that he forgave him and that she should too. But he thought that she already did. Jack surely had gone and see Mary personally to ask for her forgiveness. She wasn’t like him that way, she was more understanding. He’ll also have to explain why he was here, so soon. Maybe his parents would be sad for a moment, but he could wait with them, for Sam. When the time would come.
“Thanks.” Sam said before reciting an incantation in Latin. Dean and Kaia came closer as he kept repeating it, a bit louder with every sentence. Sam threw some dried leaves of deadly nightshade into the copper bowl, making smoke erupt from it. At first, it seemed the dungeon was filled with smoke and they couldn’t even see themselves in the fog. Then suddenly, the fog disappeared and Rowena was standing inside the devil’s trap, majestic with a dark long dress and luxurious red hair, cascading down her back. Of course, the devil’s trap was just decoration for her. Useless against her powers.
“Thanks kid.” Dean clapped Jack’s shoulder and released him. He looked at him. Sometimes he swore he saw Cas in his eyes. He wandered just how much Jack chose to take from the angel when he was born, had he chosen to look like him?
“I know she’s suffering; you don’t think I know that?” Dean waved his hands angrily in the air “But I won’t risk losing you! We’ll call Jack!”
“Why not? Cas looked like my father Dean. I wanted to remember him too.” She held onto his hand for a moment, gently squeezing. “He was important to me too.” He looked at her and even though he knew she was not Cas’ daughter; he could see a little of his strength behind her blue eyes. She left soon after, leaving Dean and Miracle to gaze at the photograph, now the most precious object in Dean’s possession.
“Well, if I get the warding, I can go out, and we can…” Cas eyes darted away, he seemed almost embarrassed.
“Hello Sam.” He waved at him and went to stand next to Eileen. She had been taken by surprise too and was searching for Sam’s hand.
“Look at me.” he simply said, in a hoarse voice. And Cas turned his head, eyes gleaming with tears. He held onto Dean’s hand. “I’m sorry Cas.” he whispered, barely brushing his face. Dean wanted to touch him more but he was still afraid of contact, of doing the wrong thing. Cas was not used to this, he knew that. He was not used to it either to tell the truth. Dean had never been violent in intimacy but he never had to be this gentle either. He wanted the angel to feel loved.
“It’s not. Not anymore.” Dean answered, his hand sliding behind Cas’s head, resting on his hair. “And you can feel it too.” He looked at Cas’ hand still on his chest. He put his left hand on his and met his eyes “Tell me if I’m lying.”
He had not seen Bobby, sitting on a porch. Was it the Roadhouse? Bobby?! What memory was it? He couldn’t remember the place or time.
He was so close to the rift, and the closer he got to it, the more power he gained back. He pulled on Castiel’s trench coat and slid them off into the rift, leaving blackness behind them. He faintly heard Rowena recite another chant, closing the rift behind him.
Sam turned towards his brother, face all wet from crying “It’s Eileen, she didn’t hear it coming…” Sam stuttered “I-I-I wasn’t fast enough” He shook his head “I don’t get it, we did everything.” His hands were on his head, pressing on either side. “It should have been dead.”
“So?” Eileen asked again, signing this time. Dean picked that up, he was not as good at Sam at signing but he was getting there. He looked at everyone, they must have been a dozen around him. A part of them strangers. And they were all here to help him. And didn’t even know why. People did care. More than he ever realised. And this time, Dean would accept help from the people around him. This time, he would accept to be cared for. Because
“Cas…I don’t know if you can hear me…” Dean had said softly… almost whispering. Dean smiled, the ache in his chest turning into hot bliss, “I’m sorry I didn’t say it back.” He brushed off a tear out of his eye. “I was so stupid.” another tear rolled down his cheek “I didn’t know angels could love like that. I didn’t know
After pre-heating the oven, he watched the rest of the video and did some personal research on the computer to wait on the dough to be ready. Computers were still distrustful for him but he had to admit, they sometimes were a treasure trove of information. After an hour, he rolled the dough thin enough with a rolling pin. He thought he was quite good at cooking actually; Dean would be impressed.
Dean grabbed his face and kissed him, hard. He pulled Cas’ hair and kissed his neck making the angel whimper his name. “You won’t hurt me, but I need you to want this Cas” his voice was just a breath on Castiel’s skin, making him shudder in pleasure.
“I wish I could get into the Empty myself, but I can’t.” Dean said, frustration transpiring through his furrowed brow.
Yes. He was bound to Cas. He had been ever since he raised him from Hell. Sam and Rowena had found a way to kill Dean momentarily to allow a former visitor to set foot in the Empty, just a few moments. It would only take so much to grab Cas and get out. But all of this would be of absolutely no use if they couldn’t get a hold of Jack. He was the only one who went to the Empty and back except for Castiel.
Dean didn’t know what to do or what to say, he thought he would be the one calling the shots but it turned out Castiel was very good at that. He nodded slowly, swallowing the lump in his throat. Damn, he felt like a schoolgirl on prom night, what had the angel done to him? Cas had grabbed him tight and suddenly they were in his bedroom. He had flied there with Dean.
“Castiel! Castiel, wake up!” He shouted at the angel, shaking him. He tried to wake him up with his powers but it was completely useless. Nothing changed at all. He was still asleep. Jack sighed and began lifting him up. He was stronger than any man, and he was going to get Cas out of there. Even if he needed to drag him out unconscious. He would figure out a way to wake him up later.
“No! Jack don’t go now!” Dean cried back. He thought fast and blurted out “come tonight, we’ll eat pie with Sam and Eileen. Do it for me Jack. Please. Just tonight.”
“Dean?” Cas looked at him for a moment, his eyes wide and confused. “Is that really you?” and Dean could see he was scared.
He had started devising a plan for his research. He would start with the oldest books, the most hardcore lore. He would use Sam’s software to translate Enochian and other languages into English. He would move on with lore on the Empty if he could find it. Move on to angels’ lore. Lore on how to break a pact made with an apparently unbeatable force. Lore on anything really. He would read all the books if it had to kill him. Even if this would last all of his mortal life. But he would find it.
“Amara can do it, yes. But…Castiel wouldn’t be able to use his grace fully yet. Maybe with both warding in a room
Castiel came in in the infirmary after having knocked on the door. He nodded at Sam and put his hand on his shoulder, trying to reassure him. He handed him the hot beverage; Sam smiled back but the angel could feel his sorrow. It was unbearable.
“That you would be hungry for more.” Cas kissed him back, opening his mouth to welcome Dean’s tongue.
. Dean stayed like that, motionless, sitting in the Impala. He slowly got up and out of the car, intending to go get that beer after all. He was not sure about the celebrating yet.
“You will. Maybe not now. But in time, you will.” She took a step back, still one hand on his shoulder. “You should talk to Sam about it, Dean. I think you’d be surprised by what you’ll find.”
“Sam? What are you doing here? I thought you were with Eil…” he was cut short by… Eileen, waving at him. And Bobby. Charlie and her girlfriend Stevie. Jody. Claire. Kaia. Donna. Jules. And others he didn’t even recognize, hunters surely.
Dean drank his coffee while walking towards the garage when he heard noise coming from the infirmary. Voices screaming. He ran towards it, leaving his mug somewhere on the way.
“I did. You should be comfortable.” Eileen signed back. Dean chuckled and shook his head, signing “thank you” back to her and laid himself on the table, head resting on the pillow.
, he had to be. He had never felt like this with someone in his whole life. And Cas had been part of it for the longest of time.
“Cas, if you’re not on board with it, we can wait. I don’t care about that; I just want you here with me.” Dean came even closer, touching the angel’s arm and gently caressing it. Cas grabbed Dean’s hand on his arm, holding onto him.
“And we will be. But in the meantime, I want to enjoy my life on Earth.” Castiel rested his hand on Jack’s shoulder “So, will you do it?”
“Yes. It will.” Dean cupped his face with his other hand, making the angel look at him. He knew he couldn’t resist his eyes. They were one of Castiel’s weakness, evidently. “But it’ll be a good change. I’ll make it good for you. I want all of you, Cas. If you want me too.”
“As well as can be expected. He’s not leaving her side.” Castiel continued “Give me the book, you look on the computer.” and slid the computer across the table.
The hours passed and the last hunters collected their stuff and left the bunker, saying goodbye and promising to stay in touch if they discovered something interesting. Dean perused the books and got some leads, spells that could very well work if combined… all more dangerous than the next. But each and everyone giving him hope and warming his heart. Sam went around the bunker to pick up some books and check on Rowena. Eileen was quite amused by their relationship and teased him about it all afternoon, making Sam roll his eyes.
Dean was speechless. Jack looked at him and extended his arms, a beautifully carved wooden box appearing out of thin air.
“Dean?” Sam was standing in the doorframe, holding something in his hand. It must have been around 5 am and Dean still sat at the angel’s side. He didn’t answer but looked back at his brother. Sam came closer and sat in the chair next to Dean.
He got up after a few minutes, on his way to buy some pies to bring back home. At last, he had something worth celebrating.
Eileen came at some point to give Dean some coffee. He thanked her but didn’t even drink it. He was simply unable to let go of Castiel’s hand. Not again. Not ever.
“Yeah? When? Because all I see is no progress. Nothing! And Cas is still rotting in there!” He shouted, waving the list in the air. “He’s there and we’re here, and it’s not fair Sammy! He sacrificed himself for me and I can’t even bring him back!” He had looked at Rowena, furious. He couldn’t control himself these last few weeks and he had been drinking again. “I can’t even do that for him! All this is useless that’s what it is!” He threw away the list, letting it land on the floor.
At first, Dean was shocked to realise that so many people dropped everything to help him in his search. Even the ones he didn’t even know, hell, the ones he never even
“Well… this is weird too. I keep getting…blocked.” Jack looked at Dean, confused “When I listen to him, all I hear is this song… you know the one you love,
“And I’ll do it again.” he stared at the angel, licking his lips. How could he look so good? Damn… it wasn’t fair.
“No, No” She said out loud, making them all more miserable in the room. “Jack. Wait for Jack.” She cried, holding Castiel’s hand tight in hers. Castiel looked at her hopeless. “Wait, please.” She asked again.
“Well… the deal was that the Empty would ta-take him when he would experience a mo-moment of true happiness.” Dean was fiddling with his fingers, having difficulties getting the words out. But he forced himself anyway. “I didn’t understand Sam… I didn’t understand what was happening. I didn’t see it coming.” He was shaking his head, his eyebrows bound in pain, the aching feeling made a kicking return to his chest. “He said, that happiness wasn’t in the ha-having but in the being. That I-I-I changed him. I-I-I ma-made him care for y-you, for Jack, for th-the wo-orld.” Dean was aching all over, his throat was getting tighter as he kept talking… tears threatening to appear once again. He breathed deeply. Sam was in front of him, listening. “He told me he loved me Sam. He told me he loved me, and I didn’t say it back.” Dean was drained of his lifeforce, like a puppet without ropes to hold him, he sat down in the nearest chair. Whispering, head in his hands “I didn’t say it back…  I didn’t say anything. And the Empty took him”. Sam sat beside him, processing the news.
They spend the day watching cartoons, sorting plants Dean had brought back to the room. They really needed to reorganize the bunker and Sam would be pleased when he came back from the hunt. After Miracle’s walk with Dean, they played board games and poker. Castiel tried to teach Dean how to play chess.
Dean turned around and picked it up, it weighed a ton. He secured it around his arms and chest and followed Eileen in the hallway, back to the library. Sam and Rowena were almost done with the plants.
Dean never had sex with a guy before, but then again, he never had sex with Castiel before. He had been in love with the angel for longer than he could remember and often dreamed about him, but he never allowed himself to acknowledge his desires. Never in his life had he give in into other impulses than the stereotypical heterosexual ones, the one he was raised in. Today he was intent on showing the angel just how much he wanted him, how much he wanted to please him, how much he cared, how wrong he had been to wait. He grabbed Cas’ flannel and pinned him to the wall behind him, surprising Castiel.
Cas closed his eyes, cupping Dean’s face in both hands. Dean didn’t close his eyes. He wanted to see the angel’s reaction. He thought about him and laid down his walls, making room for the angel in his soul. He focused on him. Only on Castiel. Only on them. He didn’t know the exact moment he fell in love. He had not realised he was in love with him before Cas’ confession. But he had been. Desperately. Was it purgatory? Before? Was it after? He was lost in his emotions. He remembered caring, so much. He remembered being unable to address it, hiding it underneath alcohol and anger. But the truth remained the same. He loved him with every fibre of his being.
“Thank you dear, we must get the jars now.” Rowena had spoken very clearly so that Eileen understood her easily. She nodded her head and went to tap Dean on the shoulder.
“Hmm?” Dean’s face was looking back at the angel and he had not seen him move his hand. “Cas…” he gasped when he felt the angel’s fingers gently stroking him.
Eileen looked a bit longer and inhale suddenly, as if coming with a revelation. She tapped excitedly on Sam’s shoulder to get his attention and signed “It’s a code! It’s a code! I heard of witches enchanting books so that no one can read them but them.”
Slowly but surely, he started to find a rhythm, opening a new page, scanning it, translating it, turning the next page, drinking – spiked – coffee, unperturbed. Then, after what felt like hours on end something made him twitch. Miracle, who had been sound asleep, started wagging her tail, and barking.
Dean looked at him without saying a word. If Cas said those words, he could believe it. No one had said those words to him before, not like that.
“What is this?” Dean had asked, looking at the ever-growing ingredients listed by Rowena “A pure essence of self” He asked, confused “What the hell does that even mean?”
“Sam! Calm down, we’ll find a way!” Dean put a hand on his brother and looked at Castiel with concern. The angel shook his head to signify that he couldn’t do anything more.
“My looks! Just who do you think I am?” Dean said falsely shocked, laughter in his voice. And Cas couldn’t help but smile back.
He brushed Cas’ skin with his thumb, caressing his hair with his other hand. It was an innocent touch but it felt like he couldn’t live without it. A tear rolled off his face. He was still worried about his angel, but at least he was here with him now. At least now he could watch over him. He would find a way to wake him. Maybe he needed more time.
“Alright. Scoot over.” Cas laid on the bed, his head laying on the pillow next to him. Dean pulled the covers on both of them, and gently rested his head on Castiel’s chest. He could feel the angel’s warmth and hear his heartbeat. Castiel’s arm sheltered Dean protectively as he rubbed his fingers absently in his hair, making Dean relax. Neither of them said a word. Soon, Dean was asleep, head on the angel’s chest and arms wrapped around him. Falling asleep used to be hard for him, a chore. Now it was the simplest thing in the world.
“Dean… It’s okay” looking back at his brother. “The ingredients are in there, and I need the warding to call her.”
Dean ran a hand on his face, sighing. He didn’t know what else to do. He had called on Bobby but he didn’t know either, no one in the hunter’s network knew what to do. And time was running out, fast. There was only one thing left to do.
“I sorry I was a jerk to you sometimes.” Dean inhaled “I loved you, and all my li-life, I believed it wa-was wrong…”
And Dean was starting to realise that maybe he could finally get a little peace here. He took a sip of his first beer in Heaven. And...
“You won’t.” Dean put a hand on his brother. “Look…Cas tried to call Jack, he tried Heaven but…no one’s answering.”
He didn’t know what to say, where to go, what to do with his eternal life in Heaven. He felt there was still things he left unresolved on Earth. He felt lost. He couldn’t see his parents now, he wanted to be alone for a while, he decided.
Tears rolled off of Dean’s face, uncontrollably. Castiel had written a letter to Jack. His vision blurred and his throat hurt like hell. His shoulders shook from the agonizing waves of pain burning through him. This was the reason why Jack wasn’t answering any of his prayers. He was listening to Cas, remodelling Heaven. But why didn’t Jack take the letter with him like Cas instructed him to? And what was the words Jack needed to remember?
“Dean. I know when you’re hiding something.” He came closer to him, making Dean go red. “You’re blushing.” And Dean’s cheeks reddened even more, bringing out his freckles. Castiel came closer to him, very close. “What are you hiding?” He whispered, looking into his green eyes. Dean couldn’t resist.
“It’s from Anja, in Germany. Garth’s contact” Dean answered. “Maybe she knows more about it, since she’s the one who sent it.”
Yes. Tomorrow, Dean’s most important hunt will begin. No, not a hunt, he thought… a war. A war to find a way to bring
Dean nodded and held his hands with both hands. Amara put her hands on Castiel’s chest, closing her eyes and reciting a chant. When she opened her eyes, they were jet black. She inhaled sharply and waves of power seemed to emanate from her hands, causing Castiel to wince and refrain a scream. He squeezed Dean’s hand hard, his vision blackening for a second. Dean’s hands were turning white where the angel squeezed him but he didn’t care at all. Amara closed her eyes again and suddenly Castiel was slowly relaxing.
“It’s alright. Keep reading, I’ll go help Sam with his spell.” Claire said, moving towards the devil’s trap and Sam’s spell preparation. Kaia showed another Hebrew-translated chapter to Dean.
The angel’s eyes opened drowsily, then closed again. Dean stopped breathing. He opened them again a few times, looking around at the walls and ceiling covered in warding. For a moment it seemed like he panicked, his pupils dilatating. Once his eyes found Dean’s he stopped moving. He seemed shocked and confused. Completely lost. Dean marvelled at him and at the blue shades of his irises. He was in shock but still beautiful, still Cas.
“Forever. Stay with me forever.” Dean added. “Or else I don’t know what I’ll do.” He shook his head “I don’t….” Cas kissed him, holding him close.
“I’ll…I’ll try Sammy.” He said, slowly calming down. Getting up and leaving the kitchen after giving one last tight hug to his brother, and leaving to his room.
Miracle barked at his feet, turning around herself, trying to catch her tail. She looked happy too, as if she knew something had shifted in him.
Before Dean got back to Cas’ room, he stopped by his bedroom to change since his shirt was completely ruined with coffee stains and he needed to get dressed anyway. He put on a black shirt and green flannel; the one Eileen told him made ‘his eyes sparkle’ whatever that meant… but he thought he looked good in it. He slipped on a pair of jeans and headed to Cas’ room. He was feeling fine today, energetic even.
“Where is the…” Castiel said to himself, looking for the flour. He checked the cupboards and finally found it after some time. “That’s not so complicated.” he squinted at the computer screen, analysing the recipe.
And seeing him like this broke Cas’ heart. He couldn’t do that to him, but he couldn’t stand by either. He rubbed his hands on his face, inhaling and exhaling through his nose.
“Okay man, I’ll go clean up and then I’ll get the beers, don’t be too long, let’s celebrate a little.” Sam told his brother, who seemed to be a little out of it, but Sam put it on the fight, the bodies clean-up and the long-ride home, and went upstairs.
“So beautiful.” Cas whispered, he continued and added another finger when he felt he could, making Dean shiver again and slowly loosen his grip. He closed his eyes, brow furrowed. He was completely lost and at the angel’s mercy. He moaned and Castiel’s fingers started moving, scissoring… Dean’s hands grabbed his shoulder, his waist, squeezing him. He realised he had not really moved since Castiel had started. After some time and with a soft kiss, Cas slid another finger into Dean, his tongue tasting the warm breath coming out of him. As he was thrusting his fingers, Dean’s legs spread even more, arching his back. Castiel pressed his fingers again a bit further, making Dean whine his name hopelessly. The human grabbed his hair, moaning and kissing him hard.
“Thank you” Dean uttered, talking to Amara but looking at Cas, still hunched with the memory of pain.
“Tomorrow we go to war Miracle.” he said before falling asleep, weirdly peaceful for the first time in weeks.
“Oh well…” she said, getting her knife out of her back pocket, and cutting her hand just like Sam did moments before. Blood slowly leaking from the wound.
Castiel looked at Dean, beautifully surprised. He never expected him to expose his feelings, his wants. Yet, he was doing just this. He was opening up to him.
After Sam’s departure and being finally done with the chores in the kitchen, Dean went outside to walk Miracle around and play with her. He loved this time, he felt like he could think and actually rest his mind. Miracle loved it also of course and was always overjoyed while playing outside with him. She loved running around and often brought back a variety of wooden sticks, little trophies awarded for a good walk. “Good girl.” Dean always said to her, patting her just underneath the jaw.
Dean closed the gap between them, resuming his strokes on Cas, a tear falling involuntarily from his eyes. The way Cas made him feel… it was just so good. He led the angel to the bed, Cas kissed him on the neck, softly sucking. Pulling Dean’s lower waist closer.
“You are very tender with me Dean.” Cas smiled softly “What did I do to deserve you?” And Dean was shocked to think he didn’t think he deserved him. Maybe seeing Amara had tripped something within Castiel he didn’t know existed before.
“It’s okay, what brings you here? Do you have news for Cas?” he poured himself another cup and sat back down.
And as he thought about all these moments, every stare, every joke between them, every instant, every fight, everything… he could see Castiel reacting before him. Smiling, frowning, sighing, chuckling even. And Dean smiled at the sight. How could he have been so stupid? To think he couldn’t be in love with the angel? To think he didn’t deserve his love? To think Cas didn’t deserve all the love he could give him? Dean’s chest was burning with a new desire. He reached for Cas’s face and the angel opened his eyes. Dean could feel that Castiel had read his mind. Though Dean couldn’t feel what Cas was thinking he could see a mixture of emotions emanating from the angel’s eyes. Passion. Fear. Love.
“I already did, earlier. I used burned stinging nettle and holy water, like Rowena told me to.” She answered.
Jack had not answer any of their prayers yet and Dean was starting to get restless. The afternoon was well on its way and he was starting to wonder if Jack would come at all.
“Well, what good is the spell if we can’t perform it?” He had almost yelled. “We’ve got nothing of him! Nothing!”
“It’s perfect Samuel. I do think we are ready for the big part.” She raised her eyebrows and smiled, as much as the spell terrified Sam it made her quite joyful. She did love the thrill of a dangerous spell. “Are we having fun, yet?” She chuckled at Dean.
The day passed quite fast, with the reading and the variant exchanges between the different groups, sharing their findings, studying the possibilities. And with every page turned in the bunker, Dean felt a bit closer to
“It’s alright. Actually… Cas left me something else before he left. I was supposed to give it to you when…”
“Castiel.” Jack eyes met the angel’s “I would do it, if this is your wish.” He smiled softly “I would do anything for you, you’re my father.”
“Claire? What’re you doing here?” He still had red eyes and didn’t want her to see him like this. He did his best to hide it.
The first night of research was not very productive since everyone was tired of the drive to the bunker. However, they did manage to establish a plan for the upcoming week. Everyone was going to be dispatched everywhere around the bunker. Sam and Bobby were going to handle videocalls with hunters or contacts who couldn’t come in person or were too far away. Every group was supposed to make piles from the least to the most promising lead. Then, at the end of the week they would hopefully have enough leads for Dean and Sam to look at them more closely. Eileen would stay longer to help them.
He didn’t know what to expect. To see him, standing there again, surrounded by blackness, just like that horrible day. To see him, professing his love. To see him crying. To hear him again.
He had almost reached the angel when something made him trip. A hand made of black goo grabbing his foot. His eyes glowed golden and the hand disappeared, causing the ground to tremble. He got himself back up and running. He heard a voice, screaming.
“Cas!” Dean was still repeating his name and Castiel looked at him confused, he didn’t seem as worried as he had first thought. “Oh my god Cas it smells so great!” Dean sniffed the air in the kitchen, coming closer to the oven, he grabbed the handle, wanting to open it and smell some more.
As time passed, he thought about Cas, in his bed beside him, his blue eyes watching him. Cas, touching him. Him touching Cas. He couldn’t believe it. He was scared something awful would happen and that his newfound happiness would slip away from him, as it so often did. Still, he was grateful for his angel who always seemed to find the words or the touch to settle his heart. At least, if everything stayed the same and Cas didn’t use his grace too much, the angel would be safe. Forever. It comforted Dean to think like that, the certainty of it appeased his mind. Castiel was safe.
, professing his love. And he would relive it again and again, always painfully remembering that he didn’t reply, that he didn’t say
“Not this time Sammy. I can’t ignore it this time.” Dean said sniffling. “And I’m tired of crying … man I don’t recognise myself.”
Dean was standing in a clearing, birds singing around him, green hills in the distance. He thought to himself “well, at least I made it to Heaven…”. He thought about it for a second and was surprised to see that he was peaceful with the idea of being dead. He should have been pissed, surely. He died when he thought he was starting a new life. Free at last. And he died on a fucking nail. Yet somehow, he was…peaceful. Maybe it was an effect of Heaven on him. Still him, but less angry and conflicted.
“I don’t think so…it’s too close to the description and Sam would not have missed it.” Cas sat next to him, “He’s too experienced a hunter.”
Dean was getting some coffee in the kitchen and couldn’t believe he had slept this long. He sat down at the table, looking at his texts and calls to check if Sam or Eileen needed something. He got nothing except the daily text from Sam, saying there was no problem. He put on the radio and sipped his coffee.
Five months since Dean put two and two together and realised the old incantation found by Claire and Kaia could work if linked with another one in Anja’s book.
They both fell silent, Sam sipping his coffee and Castiel checking on Eileen’s vital signs. Their silence was deranged by another knock on the door. Dean came in, patting his brother on the shoulder like Castiel did just before, causing Sam to smile. He stood next to him, watching Eileen with concern.
“Rowena!” Sam said, as if it was obvious. Of course. Dean thought, mouth agape and eyes widened. “Rowena…” he whispered. “Rowena!” He repeated louder for Sam to hear. “Sam, you’re a genius.” He smiled. Sam smiled back “I know.” he said, laughing.
Unexpected. Sweet and bitter at the same time. Heart breaking. Gut wrenching. An aching pain in his chest that even whisky couldn’t dull away. In these moments, he did everything he could to hide the pain. He thought he did a good job at that, but Sam could notice those moments. He would look over his computer to his brother, staring for a few seconds, pinching his lips. He would go back to work almost immediately without Dean knowing. Sam was determined to find a way to bring Cas back and alleviate his brother’s pain.
“Hi Sam, it’s alright. I was translating another book. I needed the break honestly!” She laughed. “What is troubling you?”
appeared out of nowhere. She sat on it, resting her hands on either side, her legs crossed in an elegant manner. Sam couldn’t help but be amused by his favourite Scottish witch. “Go on lad, do explain what is troubling you.”
“Maybe it’s too much of a long shot…I don’t know…” Sam sighed, resting his hands on the table, gently tapping his fingers.
“You’re mine.” Cas whispered, thrusting more into him. Dean was pulling at the sheets around him, his hands searching for Cas’. He finally found him as Cas pressed them closer together, making Dean cry his name.
“Me neither. And you’re not.” Sam continued “How do you think she’ll feel when she discovers you sacrificed yourself,
And Dean wanted to run and hug him, revel into seeing him again. But he was stuck in wonder and awe. All he could master was “Cas…” just loud enough that he could hear himself say it. Softly, like a whisper. Cas had heard him of course.
“No Cas! You listen to me now. I won’t lose you again.” Dean’s chest was aching, “I can’t.” He breathed.
Dean opened his eyes, looking at the angel. He exhaled and got up, passing some sweatpants on but leaving his chest bare. He started salivating at the sight of the sandwiches. He took a bite out of it, reveling in it. Castiel watched him, marveling at him. He always seemed so happy when he was eating. This was something he couldn’t share with him, yet. Dean felt the angel’s stare on him.
Castiel was pleasantly surprised, he didn’t think Dean would be this willing. He kissed his neck, gently sucking. He hit the same spot again and removed his fingers, making Dean lose his mind. He held his legs a bit higher, knees up.
“Sam, I promise that we will not misbehave.” Castiel answered, serious, making Dean almost spit his coffee out of his mouth.
“I know Bobby, I know. Thank you for everything.” he hugged him goodbye one last time and watch the rest of the research team leave through the bunker’s door. He exhaled slowly. He went back to his room to pick up Miracle for her walk.
Dean had been so stupid. He thought that the book would solve everything. He had allowed himself a sliver of hope and got nothing but frustration. When Sam told him Rowena had cracked it, this was it, he had thought, he had found a way. But it had turned out horribly wrong. They had found a spell alright. And he had mistakenly thought this would have been the hardest part. How wrong he had been… finding the spell was not the hardest part. Because they couldn’t perform it at all, it turned out. The ingredients required to perform it were very hard to come by, and some…impossible even.
“Sure! Red’s for promising leads, but hard to accomplish. Orange’s for leads that we feel could be coupled with other spells or ingredients. Green’s for leads on other spells that are just mentioned but not explained.” Donna was pretty proud of herself, when seeing Dean’s smile.
back. I’m going to get Cas out of the Empty.” And it felt good saying his name, saying it with hope and not despair.
A Miniwashitu, that’s what had attacked Eileen. And they couldn’t even kill it now because it only appeared once a year. So, Dean looked for a way to reverse the blindness it had inflicted on her.
“Yeah, but you did, stupid.” Sam continued “He did first, then you. But you were both too stubborn to accept it, and you… Dean you refuse love when it comes to you.”
“No! No, I didn’t. Now that you called me, I think it’s going to be alright. I can hear angels again.” He said closing his eyes.
“I don’t know what to do Cas, I don’t know…” Dean shook his head, his hand on Cas’. And as they stood there, considering the possibilities they heard Sam’s voice raising in the infirmary. They both ran to it, feeling something was wrong.
“Yes. Yes. Very much so.” He opened his eyes, they were glowing. “Sorry for the lights. I’ll fix them.” And just like that, the lights were back up.
Here it was again. Stupid things like that. Perfect words. Dean would have considered them cheesy or ridiculous before…not anymore. And it couldn’t be awkward, not with Cas anyway. He couldn’t get enough of Castiel’s weird revelations about him, what he was thinking about in his beautiful angel’s mind. Dean’s face turned towards Castiel chest, resting it against him. He smelled the angel, mint and…honey?
“Mhmph” Dean answered, clearly not awake yet. Sam smiled a little. Dean took delight in the warmth of the beverage, waking him up little by little. Sam was done with his eggs and toasts, he put a plate in front of Dean and got one himself. Sam finally sat down, handing Dean a cup of coffee and drinking one himself. He said nothing more, he didn’t want to talk about last night first, or at all. If they were to talk about it, Dean needed to make the first step. Sam did not need to acknowledge it happened; he just needed his brother to be with him. So, they ate in silence, it was broken only by sounds of toasts crunching and forks clinking. Finally, as they were both almost done with their eggs, Dean uttered his first words of the day.
? What Sammy? What could possibly get me to continue and live this life? If we can even call this a life…” Dean started getting angry, like always when he felt cornered in his feelings, his fingers were white around the bottle.
He started eating but quickly felt sick and realised, once again that he was not hungry. He wandered around, going nowhere in particular. He arrived at room number 15. The guest room as Sam liked to call it. It had been Mary’s for a while. And it had been Castiel’s too. The song continued as Dean entered the room.
Castiel frowned and sighed, clenching his teeth. “Dean. We bring her to my room, maybe the warding will be enough.”
“No…I prayed to him and he just…doesn’t answer. I don’t know what’s going on with him.” He sighed, and Dean looked at him with heartbreak in his eyes. He had prayed to him too, but never got any answer, he looked away. He
“You found my research?” Cas’ eyebrows were raised. His hand had closed on the hunter’s flannel, tugging at it.
“No! Dean, the pie needs to bake without any interference.” Cas put his hand on his “The woman in the video was very adamant about it.” He continued, serious.
Of course, Dean could feel the angel’s gaze on him but said nothing. Castiel had stopped reading his mind after the first day, stating that Dean only needed telling him what he was comfortable with. Dean looked back at moments, almost catching the angel staring back, but never quite. He smiled softly without him knowing, looking at his blue eyes and confused look who always seem to be on his face. Yes, he was not human. He was an angel. But he was
He looked around, watching the water lapping on the lake edge, the wind rustling around in the trees. He even noticed bald eagles nesting up in them. Miracle’s head was resting on his lap.
“You do nothing, Dean. Let me do the work. I want to do this, for both of you.” Amara looked at Dean intensely “After all, I promised you I would always help you.” Dean glanced at Cas when she said that, embarrassed. She had said that under completely different circumstances.
“All of you.” Dean paused, gazing into his eyes “So get this warding, so I can show just how much I love you.” Dean’s lips trembled slightly “Cause I’m starting to think, I won’t be able to wait much longer.” His hand was on the back of Cas’ neck, caressing his hair softly. He could feel the angel’s breath on his skin and the scent of mint and honey, mesmerizingly intoxicating.
“Sam, I want you to go fetch some pillows and stuff for her. Go.” Dean ordered his brother who left with a vacant look.
“I know he has these new powers…but he’s still young. He has much to learn.” Cas shook his head “I wish I could help him with his burden.”
It had been a week since Dean’s death and he was still recovering. Though it had been intense at first, he was starting to get the hang of it. He didn’t care about tiredness anyway, he was happy. For the first time in years, he was happy.
“Drink this, Jack” Sam had suddenly turned back and ushered Jack to drink. He gulped the potion in one big swallow and grimaced at the taste. Rowena put the last ingredient in the bowl, a piece of Castiel’s feather and recited an Enochian chant. A rift opened in the room, cold air seeping out of it. Jack passed through it, not looking back. He needed to act fast. Or Dean would not make it.
“I don’t need…I don’t need you to say it back. I know it’s different for you” Castiel added, his voice breaking slightly.
Dean gazed into his eyes “I’m yours, and you’re mine.” he laid his head back, breathing. Castiel closed his eyes for a second and they were all cleaned up. He snuggled close to Dean, resting his head on him, listening to his heartbeat, his leg placed on Dean’s. The human’s heat radiated under his fingers. So… tangible.
He turned back to Dean “Yes I’m here.” He continued “We might have a way of protecting Castiel, but it’s far from perfect.”
“Morning Cas.” He said dozily, tightening his arms around the angel, his head turning towards his face.
“Jack…” he whispered. He got up and ran to him, hugging him tight. “Where have you been?!” squeezing him even harder.
“You’re so beautiful, Dean.” Cas whispered in his ear, his breath brushing against Dean’s skin. His hand moved swiftly on Dean’s cock and he let a small noise escape his mouth, closing his eyes in bliss. “I never thought…you could be more beautiful.” Dean looked into his lusty blue eyes, and by the mere sight of them felt a rush of pleasure coursing through him. He locked his lips on the angel’s. He couldn’t believe it was Cas, doing this to him.
Dean looked at Cas for approbation but the look on the angel’s face was not the supportive one he had expected. He sighed heavily and went out of the infirmary to get some air.
His mind was confused, had it all been a dream? The last thing he remembered was holding Cas in his arms.
“I have to try Sammy.” Dean said, resolute. Sam could see that he was not going to let this go. He closed his eyes and sighed, rubbing his forehead with his hands.
“Yeah, man. You always did care too much. That’s why we… that’s why we all love you.” Sam answered. And panicked almost instantly when he saw Dean, broken again, worse than before. He really thought he said the right thing there. “Dean, what is it?” he said, urgently.
Dean’s eyes widened at the realisation. Castiel did research on sex. He knew they had not yet gone all the way…but still. He didn’t know how to take it, was the angel not fulfilled like he thought he was? Did he want more? Blowjobs and hand jobs were one thing but the rest was not as evident for Dean, he was very new at this and…scared?
“But Jack… I can’t leave.” Castiel answered with sad eyes. “I want to help you, but I can’t leave Dean.” He fumbled with his hands “I can’t leave him alone. He’s not going to survive it, not again.”
He smiled of happiness and relief. He wasn’t dead. The thoughts were rushing in Dean’s mind, he couldn’t set his mind on one that another one had already popped. Bobby kept talking.
“You’re really good at poker.” Castiel sighed and leaned against his chair, pulling on his shirt and flannel. Dean smiled at the sight.
“Of course, I’ve got some other pictures that are a lot more embarrassing, but I’m keeping those for myself.” She winked.
Claire picked up a book that was set on the very top of the pile. It was a dark brown leather book with ancient symbols and sigils inscribed on the cover.
back. That he let his angel go into the darkness without protesting. That he laid on the cold floor for hours, alone and crying. No, he couldn’t go in the archive room yet. He had to keep what little strength he had left to focus on
“No, I’m sorry.” Jack looked at Castiel, trying to find something positive “but I fixed your wings, you can fly.”
“I’m sorry. I should have said something. I shouldn’t have let you die like that. I should have gone with you, I’m sorry I didn’t fight…” Dean blurted out, tears forming in his eyes. He was not going to fight them this time.
Dean woke up the next morning with the will to get up, it had not happened since… well since a long time. He got up, put on sweatpants that were laying around and headed to the kitchen. He was sure to find Sam there, coming from a run and fixing breakfast.
“Well, Amara told me that since Castiel is here on Earth, inside a vessel… we could ‘ward’ his vessel.”
Dean looked at his watch again, and followed her around the bunker. Once they arrived, Dean grabbed a cart to put the jars on.
make up jokes then!” And Cas laughed. Dean passed a hand on his cheek, melting inside. “I love you.” It had been so easy, saying it to him these past few days. His fears started to vanish. His angel was not going anywhere.
“Cas?” and Castiel looked at him “Would you…come closer? With me?” he moved back slightly on the bed, making room for the angel.
He mixed the ingredients and worked the pastry on the table. He smiled at the dough; it was pretty close to the one on the computer. He filmed it and put it to rest in the fridge.
“You don’t have to help…” Dean was cut half-sentence by his brother, “You’re not. That’s not negotiable.” Sam looked into his brother’s eyes, and Dean could see he had just as much intent in helping him that Dean had in finding a way to break into the Empty.
“You and me” He said to Miracle, “we’re gonna bring him back” he continued “and then there will be two miracles in this bunker.” he kissed the dog and Miracle yapped excitedly. Apparently, she agreed to join him on this mission.
“We’re here now.” Castiel held him tight in his embrace. “And I never thought my time with you was wasted.”
“I don’t know if Jack knows how to keep the Empty away from me… and I don’t want you in danger.” Castiel’s voice was filled with worry.
Dean’s heart was racing, every part of him that touched the angel’s skin was on fire. He couldn’t look away from the blue eyes staring down at him.
“You’re important Dean. You’re important to me.” He said, stroking Dean’s face. Still breathing hard.
. Not how he felt. “He…before he got snatched…” he said, almost whispering “He told me… that I changed him.” His eyes were watering now. “He told me… that he loved me.” He looked at Charlie, who had moved her other hand to his shoulder, supporting him. “And I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel, Charlie. I don’t.” Charlie hugged him close.
Jack’s presence sometimes. He swore he could just sense him there sometimes, when walking Miracle outside or riding Baby around. And maybe he could just explain or ask for his forgiveness for the way he treated the kid. For how he got angry at him. Something. Anything.
Dean gently bit his lip “Okay… I’ll stop in the name of pie.” He grinned “I have to wash Miracle anyway, she jumped in pools of mud again.”
“Was is it girl?” Dean asked her calmly, reaching for his gun he had kept on the table next to him. He heard a noise. The bunker’s door opening. Voices, many of them. He aimed at the door.
. Nothing to remember him by except his memories. Miracle was looking funnily at Dean, tilting her head. Dean almost laughed at the sight. He went to her, kneeling next to the bed and petting the dog on the head. He just needed to say it at loud.
“Interco- Cas!” Dean chuckled “I think you’ve killed the mood anyway.” truth was, the angel could have taking him right here on the table. He shook his head. He wanted everything to be perfect, to be good between us. He didn’t need to rush things. He settled for something else “I’m very tired. I think I’ll probably go to bed.” It was getting late anyway and he was pretty beat.
“Well…It’s this really old book you’ve send us. We…can’t translate it. It like it’s written in code or something.”
Dean closed the tabs rapidly “Erm…yes give me a minute!” He fumbled on the computer, snapping it shut a bit too violently.
Their peace is interrupted by a horrible accident, Castiel and Dean can’t seem to see eye to eye on what to do about it. In a last-ditch attempt, they try desperately to find Jack who’s unreachable again.
“Not fair, Cas.” Dean breathed, yanking the angel’s belt away. He was faster than Cas, he tugged at the elastic band underneath, hairs tickling his fingers, he looked down, sliding his hand even lower, looking into Castiel’s eyes. When he felt the hard bulge against his hand, he gently curled around his dick, stroking it languidly. Cas’s eyes widened and escaped a soft moan, making Dean even more exited. Cas whimpered his name again with every stroke, his eyes fluttered shut. All of this was new to the angel, and Dean’s touch was pure bliss. Dean’s jeans were getting very uncomfortable, he groaned but kept going. He was not important, Cas was.
She rolled her eyes “It’s not a definite no at least, I’ll take it.” She smiled, gently punching him. “Now, let’s get to coffee making, we’ve got people who need the fuel!”
Dean smiled at the nickname and put back the letter neatly in the box, hugging it. He smiled. Happy for the first time in months. He had found a part of Castiel. Jack was back. He was going to break him out. He had found a way. Finally, he had found a way.
His hands slid along Cas’ body, gently tugging at his shirt and slithering a hand underneath. The angel’s skin was so warm against his fingers that Cas emitted a small noise, spurring Dean on. He turned the angel around, facing him. His hands were on his skin, stroking his stomach, his waist, his back, devouring him. Dean looked at Cas with hungry eyes.
“Can’t you…read his mind or something?” He wanted to reach out and take Cas’ hand, he wanted to tell him he loved him. He wanted to hear his voice.
Castiel sighed, sitting on the other side of the bed. Hands on his legs. “Maybe nothing will happen, maybe the Empty won’t find me.”
Eileen was asleep and peaceful for now. Sam had not sleep in two days and was dozing off slowly in his chair. His eyes jerked open suddenly, he rubbed his eyes, yawning.
“Aye, I know ye do.” Her eyes were fixed on Dean again, and he darted his away. “I know how much he means to ye.” She glanced back at Sam “I don’t know how to break into the Empty, Samuel.”
Dean left them, and went back to the library to work on more books, in English and not in Enochian or Hebrew hopefully. Charlie was there with Stevie. They were both perusing old books, scribbling notes on pieces of paper when they found something worth getting more into. Stevie was scanning a book to translate it later. Dean said nothing and randomly picked another book to study. This one was in English. It dealt with other dimensions and rifts through time and space. Not sure if it would help, but worth a try.
“And you are my son.” Castiel smiled “You know that.” Castiel came closer, “But you’re also Dean’s and Sam’s, they’re your family. And mine.”
love him, I would have been surprised.” Dean looked at him, speechless. “Dean…I’ve literally watched you two falling in love over the years.”
“Hello boys. Always a pleasure to see you. Especially you Samuel.” She smiled and winked at him. “What may I assist you with today? Be sure to make it quick, I’m quite busy at the moment.”
It was so beautiful. Dark blue, almost black. Shining like ebony on the edges. Shimmering with colours when facing the afternoon sun. Orange and pink, blue and green, purple, melting away together in the sunlight.
They stopped at some point to look at the water in the distance, slightly deranged by waves forming in the cold wind. The sunlight hit them right in their faces, forcing Dean to use his hand as a visor.
“Al-Alright.” Cas uttered, stroking Dean’s hair and back. He didn’t know what to do with his hands, he just wanted to touch Dean and let the human touch him. Dean looked up at Castiel, hopelessly vulnerable, hopelessly handsome. He reached for his right hand, holding him intertwined in his left and with the other he parted his legs gently. His mouth found Cas’ cock naturally, generating more gasps and moans from the angel. He swirled around the tip for some time, holding Cas’ hands in his. He felt like that was enjoyable, after hearing Cas’ soft cries. When the hold around his fingers became tighter, he moved along its length, licking him, circling back to the tip, sucking at it slowly. After looking at Cas’ head frowned in pleasure and gorgeous confusion, he laid down a gentle kiss on his length and took him all in his mouth, his warmth transferring to Cas.
“Great. Thank you.” Dean was reassured. At least Cas will have a secure room once he got out of the Empty. Even if Dean wouldn’t make it back from his sacrifice, Cas would be safe.
“Yes. The Empty. Castiel was snatched by it after he made a deal. We need to get him back.” He was serious, looking in her eyes. Rowena’s eyes flickered to Dean’s for a moment then she went back to Sam’s.
“You’re ticklish.” Castiel stated, registering the info for later. “I love you, Dean.” He felt Dean’s hand combing through his hair absently, upwards and backwards, relaxing him.
“Yeah, don’t worry, thank you Anja. And anyway, the books you’ve sent us… they will be of help, I’m sure.” He smiled at the computer. “We’ll keep you posted on any news.”
When he arrived there, Sam and Bobby were comparing thoughts with dozens of hunters on videocall, exchanging hypotheses and ideas. They had managed to combine hundreds of books on lore from all around the world. At least a quarter of them came from Garth’s contact, Anja from Germany. She had really come forward with the ancient texts and even began to translate some chapters. Dean sat down at the table, sipping his coffee and reviewed one of her books on Eileen’s computer, she was next to him, scanning some other pages with her phone. She smiled at him and resumed her work. The two of them realised they were quite the research team during the week and Dean got to train more at signing, communicating more easily with her. Sam was thrilled to see his brother getting along so well with her. And as organised as he was, even Sam had to recognise that since Dean imposed Donna and Jody’s colour code to everyone, the research had been more productive.
After some time, Sam came back with soft pillows and blankets, Dean helped him and soon Eileen was laying as comfortably as possible in the infirmary bed. Sam was still too shocked to speak and stayed next to Eileen holding her hands, without saying a word. Cas cleaned the blood off her face.
“You’ve de-decided what? Dean…how do you think you’ll do it?” Sam said, clearly refraining on other things to say. ”J-Jack can’t even do it!” He stammered. “And he’s been trying for weeks, Dean.” He continued “The Empty is completely shut off, even
He did not want to be scared, but he also knew that the more books were discarded, the more it meant that the possibility of finding no answers at all, was also very real. The day was punctuated by sandwiches, prepared by Eileen and Sam during a break. And in the afternoon, peanut butter and jelly ones, made with love by Claire and Kaia. More coffee coming from Bobby and Stevie. Some late comers from Bobby’s network got to the bunker around 5 pm and got to work after making their round of “sorry we’re late” “hi” “yeah, we’ve got some catch up to do”.
“It’s done.” Amara looked at them “You should be able to fly and use your grace outside but only in very, very small amounts. Otherwise, you could use it here quite safely, it’s nicely warded.” She looked around the room. “Still, you should be careful.”
“Dean…” He looked in his eyes and could see the malice in them, the longing. “I think you should-“ But Dean had got up and circled around the table, kneeling in front of him. “I think you should get some rest”
“Well… we need to break into the Empty. You know where angels and demo-“ Sam started but got cut halfway.
“You…I thought you weren’t satisfied. I thought-” Dean got lost in the angel’s touch, his kisses in his neck, his hand caressing his stomach, tickling him slightly. “Cas…”
“You don’t ha-“ Dean closed his eyes, it was useless, he was going to let him anyway. “It’s oka- humm” Cas had kept up the pace, gently squeezing and releasing Dean’s cock, analyzing Dean’s responses. Dean’s back arched and he gripped the angel tight. “Ca-as…”
“Well… after all he’s been through, it’s no wonder frankly. But I wouldn’t call it dirty, rather…cluttered.” Cas tilted his head and Dean roared with laughter while Sam rolled his eyes.
“Why did you take this picture?” he couldn’t look away at the photograph. He stroked it gently with his thumb.
“Then show me. Sam’s got work to do here, I’ll take a look in the meantime.” He said, picking up a folding chair and unfolding it to sit next to Kaia.
Sam left the room, Miracle on his trail. Dean looked at his watch on the nightstand. 2 pm. What? He had been unconscious for this long? But he never passed out like this in his life…sure he got knocked out once or twice, but passing out? He was probably getting older. At least this had not been a dream. His heart started to slow down and he rested his head back on his pillow, unable to move.
Eileen frowned and shook her head repeatedly, signifying no. She reached in the air, moving her hand in the general direction of Cas. He grabbed her hand.
He was soon moaning as he came, pleasure coming in waves and cum sticking between them. Cas kissed his neck and mouth lovingly after, smiling. He didn’t even realize he was this close, Castiel really did a number on him.
“Cas, I can’t focus if you keep doing this.” He whimpered, taking his hand out to get Castiel’s jeans and taking his underwear off him. Cas hurriedly did the same, still kissing Dean everywhere his mouth fell while he clumsily got rid of his jeans.
Castiel simply nodded and sat in front of Dean. He opened a beer and put it in front of him. The human smiled at Cas, it was the simple things, but it was everything. Dean finished his sandwiches pretty quickly; he had been so hungry.
Sam couldn’t look anywhere else than on Eileen. He watched as her chest went up and down, breathing. He had kept her hand in his, in case she woke up. They had managed to stich her stomach, thanks to Castiel. He had put her on a deep sleep where she couldn’t feel any pain. That’s where the beast had grabbed her with its claws, almost gutting her. She had look in its eyes, blinding her on the spot.
“I do.” He kissed him like never before, pulling him closer, his tongue sliding inside the angel’s mouth, tasting him. Cas kissed him back, biting Dean’s lip in excitation. Dean growled but didn’t stop. Castiel was taken aback after his involuntarily bite but he quickly realised that Dean had liked it more than it had hurt him. Castiel kissed him again, savouring every moment in Dean’s embrace, his fingers burning on his skin.
“Dean…the Empty is a horrible place. And the fact that it might endanger you or Sam, or Eileen…” Cas shook his head, looking in the distance.
The angel’s pupils were dilatated from pleasure “I thought my heart was going to burst.” He breathed, caressing Dean’s face. Dean kissed him; he didn’t want to let the angel go. “I’m not going anywhere, Dean.” he whispered, stroking his hair.
“It’s about Heaven, I’m rebuilding it with Amara, and I’ve created new angels with her help, but… none of them know how Heaven really works. And the few angels left are not inclined to help me… because I’m the son of Lucifer.”
When he woke up the next day, he was confused for a moment and realised he had fallen asleep in Jack’s room. No nightmares this night.
Dean was too reckless… this vampire had almost thrown him into an ass-long piece of rebar stuck in a wooden beam behind him. He realised right after that this giant nail could very well hold a vamp in place because it was as an angle… Only a second for this thought to cross his mind and he threw the vamp with all the strength he had into the metal bar, impaling him clean in the process.
“I…brought you this.” he handed the record player to Dean “I don’t know where you put your headphones, but I can get them if you want me to.”
“I’ve brought you coffee” Sam said, resting the tray on the table they had moved earlier in the week into Cas’ bedroom. Dean didn’t want to eat anywhere else. He spent most of his time in the room with the angel. Cas had no need for eating but he liked to watch Dean and talk to him while he did. They were still discovering this new relationship between us.
He whistled Miracle and headed back to the bunker when he realised he had been gone longer than expected, he was hoping the kitchen would still be in one piece.
“It’s beautiful.” Castiel stated. And Dean thought he was talking about the lake but Castiel was looking at Dean. “Your eyes in the sun, they’re beautiful.”
Dean entered with Cas and they both paused when they realised Eileen was awake. Sam smiled weakly; Eileen seemed to have sense something changing in the room. She turned her head around, tapping her hand on Sam. He turned her palm over and started tracing lines in it, slowly.
“Damn it, kid! A little warning maybe?” he said, trying uselessly to absorb the coffee with a towel.
“I never answered. And you were wrong Cas.” He said, holding Cas’ hand in his. The angel tilted his head slowly, like he always did.
Dean and Cas were still in the library, books piled all over and tabs open by dozens on the computers. All of that added up to nothing more than what they already knew.
The next day, Dean wandered after his morning coffee, saying hi to everyone. People were having breakfast everywhere in the bunker, some in the kitchen, others in the library, some even in the archive room, but Dean avoided this room. He couldn’t go back there after Cas. If he were to set a foot in there, if he were to see the dungeon… he would see
“I saw the way you looked at me and Stevie…maybe you’ve got questions, and maybe I can get you some answers.” She poured water into the tank and pushed the button “on”. The machine started heating and gently steaming up. “You just need to talk to me. Whenever. About anything.”
“What? No. Maybe? No.” Dean discreetly – he thought – wiped away a single tear out of his eye. He turns back to look at Sam. “Dude.
what defined him? He thought it was sad that there were not more photographs of his friends and family. Only a few he cherished, but not enough. And not even one
“Anyway, I don’t know how long we’ll be gone. I’ll call to check up on you.” Sam turned towards Castiel in another chair “On both of you.”
When he had asked some of them why they were here, some answered that they kind of owed it to him for finding a way to bring them back after Chuck made them all disappeared. Some others just wanted to help, others were here for the challenge and the thrill of discovering the bunker. It was a hunters’ lair after all. For different reasons, absolutely all of them wanted to find a way to bring Cas back. They were all determined and it gave Dean a new hope. Sam smiled the entire night, very glad with himself. “It was my idea, but Eileen procured the logistics, she got the word around and… here we are.” He had said to Dean while everyone was chatting in the war room.  “Thank you.” was all Dean could say to his brother. Everyone chose a room somewhere in the bunker and it seemed for an instant that the brothers were just throwing the biggest slumber party ever.
He loved the song. He had put it on the mix tape for Cas many years ago. He knew the angel had listened to it. Even if neither of them acknowledged it. He never made tapes, for anyone. But he had wanted to share something more than hunting with Cas, he wanted to say more to him. But he was too insecure to talk about his feelings. About love. So, he had made him a mixtape as a coping mechanism.
“Well, there must be an explanation. Don’t worry.” But Dean’s voice was filled with worry too. Cas saw it in his eyes. “C’mon, let’s bring those sandwiches downstairs, you need a break too.”
Castiel washed the apples and started cutting them just like in the video, removing the seeds too. He put them in lemon juice and tossed them in flour and cinnamon.
As Dean read, he seemed to get more and more confused, he frowned and kept on hitting different keys on the computer, mumbling and swearing.
Dean sighed heavily and laid back on the headboard. He closed his eyes for a moment, his head was spinning. When he opened them again a few seconds after, Castiel was at his side, sitting in the armchair. He looked at Dean without saying anything, diving into his green eyes. And Dean thought it was more than a gaze. Like if Cas was seeing the real him for the first time, and him the real angel beneath the shades of blue. They stared at each other in silence for minutes it seemed. Devouring every detail of the other. Finally, Cas broke the silence.
Jack touched Cas and Dean and they were suddenly standing in the infirmary. Sam jolted from his seat, taken aback.
“You look good Cas.” he said, his chest burning with want and desire. Castiel understood immediately.
“Cas, you’re killing me.” Dean whined, heat coming in waves everywhere in his body. He could feel his jeans getting more and more tighter, almost unbearable. He sighed hard, holding Cas’ flannel tightly between his fingers.
Dean came closer, sitting in another chair next to Jack. Out of breath. Unable to keep his eyes off of Castiel.
Dean was worried none of it was going to work. He was worried it was going to work. He was worried. What if Cas was not there? What if Jack couldn’t find him? What if he found him but the Empty killed him for good this time? What will he say to him? Will he be the same? What if…what if…
Castiel followed the instruction pressing the dough tightly in the pie pan. He added the sliced-up apples and the caramel syrup he made earlier, closing the pie with the rest of the dough, leaving place for the steam to escape from. The woman in the video said it was very important. It wasn’t perfect but it looked good enough.
“I love you too, so much. And you do make me happy.” Castiel smiled in bliss. He was complete. In all his life he had never felt…fulfilled. And here he was, on Earth in the arms of a human. Fulfilled. In love. Burning with desire. “You were so beautiful tonight, Dean” he kissed him slow and stayed like this for some time, calming him. He thought about what Dean had said, about spending his life with him.
“Well, I still have my jacket. The one wh-where he put his hand on me before disappearing. It’s got his blood on it.” Dean said, hopeful but still bitter at the memory.
“I love you too Cas” was all he wanted to say. He said it to him every night, drunk on his bedroom’s floor. He knew damn well that he had said nothing that day. Nothing. And he was terrified he could never tell him. Completely terrified. Absolutely lost. Utterly broken. “I love you too Cas” he whispered again. His body aching and burning from the immeasurable distance between him and his angel. This night he didn’t sleep well between the pain and the nightmares.
“Dean. I already asked Jack. It’s something I want.” He gestured at them and the pie “I want to experience everything with you, and as an angel, I simply can’t.”
“I’m ready.” Cas looked at Amara then at Dean. The human looked at him, scared but hopeful. “It’s okay, Dean.” he reached out to take Dean’s hand.
“Dean. Even if I ‘look good’ I can’t have… intercourse with you! You’re not well enough! And with my grace, it’s dangerous!”
Dean went straight to his bedroom and opened a compartment in his desk, grabbing a bottle of bourbon. He drank it straight from the bottle, he wanted to forget, the ache, the words, still echoing in his head. Every damn minute. Second.
too. And I want you.” Dean finally said what had weighed on him for years now. He always pushed it back, even more in recent years. But the feeling never left, it kept on growing despite his best efforts. Tears rolled softly on his cheeks. “I want you Cas. I love you. I love you” He felt like he couldn’t stop saying it now.
“Yes, I feel great.” Dean cleared his throat, trying to get his thoughts in order. “Maybe I’ll call on Jack, to see if he’s got any news.” Dean slowly sat up on the bed, still facing Castiel.
Dean chuckled; Cas was always so literal. “No… I mean, I’m here in bed with you, crying. I’m telling you I love you, you’re the only one for me. You changed me, Cas. I’m not the same person you rescued in Hell.”
“It’s good right? The spell talks about splitting dimensions and crossing the ‘void’!” she added, hopeful. “Well, it’s one translation anyway, the other could be-“
An hour and a half later, Jules and Spencer were back with plenty of pizzas to feed an army and enough beers to drench anyone’s thirst for the evening. Everyone gathered in the war room, around the world map table, and some other small tables brought for the occasion. They were cheers, toasts, laughs and sighs. A very tiring day, but a great one. An efficient one. Everyone felt a sense of belonging and being part of something greater than themselves. Dean looked around the room, taking it all in.
“What? Yes! I’m Alright, I’m perfect! Why wouldn’t I be?” Dean couldn’t stop talking and Castiel’s kept squinting his eyes at him. He knew him too well.
“Cas…yes I feel the same. You’re just…perfect with words.” Dean extended his hand, grazing Cas’ rebellious hair. “I’m not great with words, but I can tell you kissing you is…the best feeling in the world.”
Dean sighed again, shaking his head, refraining tears from falling. He didn’t want to talk about it but he didn’t want to forget either. Not
“He’ll be here, Dean.” Sam reassured his brother while cutting some black henbane with a knife. Rowena was crushing what looked like bones with a mortar and pestle. Dean kept pacing and glancing at the dark blue feather. Eileen came back with more dried plants and put them in an orderly manner on the table: wild buckwheat, vervain, yarrow and some snapdragon.
“When I’m done with the incantation, only then, you pour the oil in the mixture.” Castiel eyes were very serious.
Jack was surrounded by blackness and emptiness. He closed his eyes and recited the Enochian prayer that Rowena had him learn by heart. The prayer to find Castiel inside the Empty. When he opened his eyes again, he found a dot in the distance that stood out from all the rest. Castiel. He ran towards him as fast as he could. He could see his trench coat in the distance. His powers were subdued here. But he could still run. Even subdued, he was still strong enough.
“Come here” Dean put his mug down and patted a chair next to him. Castiel put his phone on the table, walking towards him. Cas sat next to him, almost facing Dean.
“I know.” He looked at the paper and dipped the paintbrush again. “I just wish you didn’t have to die.”
Sam put the brush aside, checked if the symbols were perfect once again and made Rowena check too. Dean felt the same energy coursing through him again.
“Sam! wait where are you goi-“ Dean stopped himself, frozen in the hallway. Sam looked at him, confused. Sam stood in front of the dungeon’s door. Sam followed his brother’s gaze, looking at the door which still held the marks of Billie’s scythe on it.
Bobby left with Charlie and Stevie, hugging the boys again and promising to see each other again soon.
She smiled weakly, she was exhausted from hallucinations and the lack of sleep. Jack put his hand on her forehead, closing his eyes in concentration. His irises where bright golden when he opened them, power radiating from his hands. Eileen’ eyes fluttered, she looked around the room and focused finally. She touched her stomach, running her hand under her shirt, grinning. She reached for Jack, holding his face.
They were just a few people around and no one to bother them. Cas had put on a coat even though he was impervious to the cold. Dean had done the same, stating this would be weird if Cas didn’t put on a coat with this temperature. It was a beautiful day but a cold one. They walked by the lake shore without saying a word, Cas just looked around at the water and at Dean. Dean did the same. They didn’t need to talk and yet they understood each other. Miracle was running around, scouting for branches.
“I’m not going to die.” Cas reassured him. “I’m going to make you happy, every day, for as long as you’ll want me.”
“I can’t… can’t do it anymore.” he whispered, slowly falling to his knees and onto the cold floor without even realising. Shaking. Tears rolling on his cheeks. A burning ache in his chest and throat. Sam said nothing and just stayed there, closing off the fridge door and holding his brother in his arms. Soothing him, taking a bit of his brother’s grief in his arms.
can’t come close, it’s impossible, you can’t do it, Dean.” Sam shook his head, at loss for more words.
Cas appeared at the door, squinting his eyes at Dean, who was facing him, the computer closed behind him. “Are you alright?”
“Dean… I didn’t see you today. You didn’t come to see us in the dungeon.” Claire said, almost like a reproach. “Kaia and I…we’ve got some leads to bring him back, you should come see us tomorrow.”
Dean looked back at the angel, the sun hitting his face gracefully, bringing out all the different shades of blue in them. He came closer and let the angel marvel at his eyes some more while he did the same. He brushed Castiel’s rebellious hair away. He couldn’t believe that he was here with him,
“Eileen!” Sam had both his hands on her shoulders, trying to restrain her. She was convulsing on the bed, menacing to fall from it and hurt herself, or worse. Dean and Castiel held her body still, pushing on her legs. Finally, she stopped thrashing and opened her eyes, looking aimlessly in the room. The boys let go of her and Sam put one if his hand in hers, she held onto him, slowly calming down as he traced letters in her hand. Dean looked at Cas, asking him silently to do something.
? Had anyone marvelled at their sight the way he just did at Charlie and Stevie? Charlie looked up and saw Dean looking intense, thoughtful. She frowned, in a pensive mood. Picking up something more than just tiredness in Dean’s eyes.
As the evening drew closer, someone thought of ordering pizza at the local Italian restaurant. Turns out it was Jules and Spencer. They had been working in a bedroom all day, crammed on a desk, books piling all around. They had thought that people deserved to get together to celebrate at the end of the day. And everyone agreed.
“It’s a very old and powerful spell book, It’s the oldest in my collection” she explained, “It’s been in my family for generations, and even though we tried, we never managed to translate it.”
“Well, yeah. But the thing is…it’s supposed to appear in the spring, not winter.” Dean shook his head “I don’t know…maybe they got it wrong.”
“All of me?” Cas breathed out, his vessel was getting the better of him, again. He gulped, looking at Dean’s eyes and lips.
He exhaled and put his other hand pressed on hers, crying even more. He managed to trace something in her hand.
“I’ll be alright in a few hours.” Castiel murmured back. “I just need to adjust.” He winced again. “I’ll never get used to this pain…”
“Och, I’m shocked Samuel. Not even a worry about how I have been, what I’ve been up to, my heart is broken.” She clapped her hand and a
“It’s okay. I love it.” Dean whispered back. He had gotten drastically closer to Castiel. He could still inhale the mint and honey. But what he wanted to taste was something else entirely. His mouth found Cas’ without him thinking, sending butterflies flying in his stomach. Cas kissed him back, barely grazing Dean’s neck. In this moment Dean realised he had never been like that with anyone. True, relaxed, whole. Cas made him complete. He didn’t know how to tell him, he didn’t know how to show him yet… but he felt for certain that Cas was
His thoughts had settled for now, and he got out of the Impala to watch the sunset. He was near a beautiful lake, it looked like one of those places out of postcards. He sat on a bench near the glistening water. It was beautiful. He stopped to take it all in. He realised he had missed the simple, beautiful things on Earth, stuff like the sun setting in golden rays on a beautiful lake.
“I know.” He looked back at him. Castiel nodded and started chanting in Enochian, tracing one hand on a copper bowl filled with crushed plants and bones, and holding the amulet in the other. As he stopped, he turned his head towards Dean and the human poured the oil in the bowl causing it to eject smoke and sparks.
“Cas?” He called before the angel left the room. He looked back at Dean, waiting. “You know I love you, right?” He grinned.
The Empty was thrown away by the most powerful blast emerging from the Nephilim. Pure energy radiating in waves from him, Amara’s and his. He closed his eyes again and they were his again.
“Dean…what I said before the Empty took me.” Cas inhaled, even though he didn’t need to. “I meant every word. Every last one of them.”
“I think we had a…mishap in Heaven. Everything was locked up, no way of getting in or out. Time kind of stopped and…”
“Rowena’s cracked it.” Sam said to him “And I think it’s pretty big.” Dean was already getting up, ready to go back to work. All fatigue vanishing from his body, only purpose left.
Dean inhaled and shook his head, arms crossed on his chest. He didn’t want to say anything but this was proof that Cas as an angel was invaluable. As a human, he could never had done it. The angel looked at Dean, understanding what he was thinking about.
“I’m peachy!” He said, half a chuckle in his voice, making an “okay” sign with his hand. Sam could see his worry but kept quiet.
Dean tilted his head, his eyes emotionally-charged. “I can’t say I’m not scared…But if this is what you want…I’ll be glad to watch you grow old and wrinkly with me.” He smiled softly.
A note laid on top of the hollow shaft, wrapped around fuzzy charcoal feathers. This time it was Dean’s name written on it.
“It’s no trouble. Anything for you, man. Listen, I’ve got to go take care of the boys, but I’ll keep y’all in the loop.” You could hear children crying in the background.
“Heya, Dean!” Donna smiled “We’ve got some good leads for ‘ya” she gestured at the ‘most promising’ pile on her left.
“Yeah it is” Dean answered, still denying what was in front of him. “Cause the last I heard…you…you’re in heaven’s lockup” He continued, taking a step forward.
“I don’t care, I need to see him.” Dean let go of Sam’s hand and began running towards the guest room. Keeping himself up by leaning on the walls. The spell really made a number on him. But he was strong, he could keep up. For
“I don’t know what it is.” Jack said, holding the long box in his hands. It was covered in symbols. A work of art. “But he was adamant about it. Only y
“Samuel, always so little faith.” She grinned and suddenly she was not there anymore. The boys waited about five minutes before she appeared again, a very ancient book in her hands. Sam slid a table across the floor for her to deposit the book on.
More goo tried to catch him but he fought it back with his powers, burning it. He finally reached Castiel. He was laying on the ground. Asleep, it seemed. Jack had thought like the rest of the group that Castiel would be awake. He was taken aback for a moment but thought about Dean, who were still dead on the other side.
Dean took his hands off, waving them in the air as if to say he was innocent. “Alright!” He grinned and his eyes smiled with him, making Castiel pause to look at him, Dean grinning in happiness was an alluring sight. Dean grabbed him by the waist and kissed him. “This…I can really get used to.” Castiel kissed him back, smiling. “I’m sorry I doubted your culinary abilities.” He started kissing his neck “Humm…you smell like cinnamon.”
obvious?” He shook his head, what the hell? Everyone thought it was so clear, the feelings between Cas and him. Why didn’t he see them before then? He was confused. How could he have been so blind for so long?
“When we’re like this…it’s hard to focus.” Cas whispered “You’re important too.” Dean could see Cas’ eyes glowing ever so lightly, his grace seeping out of him uncontrollably.
He stared at the box again, brushing it delicately. He could sense every detail of the wood carved beneath his fingers. It was very long, maybe more than his arm. He undid the copper latch, opening it cautiously as if it were made of glass.
“I don’t want to get some rest, I want you.” He grabbed his shirt and kissed him, sliding his hands underneath.
“I love you. Ever since I touched your soul. Ever since I saw the real you, hidden underneath.” He touched Dean’s chest, laying his hand on him, causing the human to inhale, surprised at the gentle touch. “I never stopped. At first, I was confused. An angel is not supposed to feel this way.” He smiled and shook his head. “But I did. I felt… for you.” his eyes were blissful. “When I realised it was love I felt…nothing could have changed, I was done for.” He gazed at Dean’s eyes, soft and loving “I was yours, then and forever.” He had said the last words in a hushed voice. Almost like a secret, between the two of them.
“I promise.” Cas kissed him, tasting the salt of Dean’s tears on his cheeks. “Dean?” he asked after a moment.
“No!” Sam almost yelled. “I won’t stop, and I can’t see you like this Dean!” He stopped to breathe, “I can’t!” he added, eyes fille with pain. “Man, we’re all that’s left. You got to talk to me, Dean.
“No. No one does. I think it’s heavily encoded in magic.” Anja continued “I send it because it’s so old…there must be something about celestial entities inside. And witches are well-known for breaking the rules.”
“Well then, let’s kill you, shall we?” She gestured at the table, inviting him to lay on it. Dean got closer and stopped. There was a pillow on it.
“Well, the kid can’t do it by himself obviously.” Dean answered to Castiel’s surprise. “And what if something like that happens again and we can’t reach him?”
Castiel stood up and followed Dean outside the infirmary. Dean was standing arms crossed on his chest, lips pinched.
Four since Sam had found out that Dean could very well be the key to break the angel free in one of Donna and Jody’s.
And yes, he did see and hear all that in the few seconds it took him to open the door and enter the room followed by Sam. He did feel the ache, burning in his chest. But he also saw Claire and Kaia, laughing, smiling, happy. Happy in this horrid room. The one where he disappeared. And this happy view warmed his heart enough to keep going. Claire had stopped laughing when she saw him and Sam enter.
“Thank you.” And Dean smiled again. Only Cas said ‘thank you’ every time he made a compliment, like he was surprised but humbled at the same time. He loved giving him compliments. He had done so for a week and was not getting tired of it. He felt like he had years to catch up on.
“No, no you’re good. It’s Sam who have a dirty mind” Dean answered, looking at his brother, chuckling.
Castiel put the pie gently in the oven, setting a timer and always keeping an eye on it to check if it wasn’t burning. After some time, he looked at the time on his phone… Dean had been gone for more than two hours. Maybe something had happened? But Castiel thought about how he really enjoyed his walks with Miracle, he was always revigorated after them. And as he looked at the recipe one last time, he heard footsteps in the corridor coming up to the kitchen, settling his worries.
“Shhh…I know. It’s okay now, I’m here.” Castiel moved his hand in his hair, his head resting on Dean’s shoulder. “It’s okay.”
Dean was scared of going too fast or saying the wrong thing, Cas was scared for Dean and his health, scared of hurting him. In result, they had been very cautious with each other during the week. Cautious but loving.
“Heaven ain’t just reliving your golden oldies anymore, it’s what it always should have been” Bobby continued, looking peacefully in the distance. “Everyone happy, everyone together.”
“You have to try. I know you can do it. You’re strong. But you feel too much Dean, you have to sort your feelings out. You have to try.” Sam said, eyes shining with tears looking intently in his big brother’s eyes.
If he couldn’t reach Jack in the next few days, he would have to use his grace to heal Eileen. She had started having hallucinations and soon she would lose her mind completely, and potentially die. He couldn’t let this happen. This would put him in danger but he couldn’t stand by knowing he could save her. His eyes studied every detail on Dean. His freckles, soft on his skin, he liked to kiss them so much when they were in bed together. Dean had been so tired these past few days and their sexual drive had been seriously lowered in their worry for Eileen, Sam and Jack. Plus, they didn’t really spend time in bed since Dean wasn’t really sleeping. Still, Castiel appreciated the few hours Dean fell asleep accidently. He looked peaceful during those moments. At times his eyes frowned funnily, as if he was fighting an imaginary enemy. He wondered how it felt like to sleep and dream like that. What would he dream about? If he were human?
Dean was pacing around the library, waiting on Jack. Sam and Rowena were getting ready on their part, gathered around the table. Dean kept looking at the feather, still in its wooden carved box, laid on a side table. He needed to make sure it was not going to suddenly disappear on him. Eileen was picking up the last plants needed to perform the spell.
Now it was Cas’ turn to be dumbstruck. He didn’t think Dean would come around to it. But he had. And he was…
Jack sighed “I understand. Your love is too strong. I can feel it, radiating from you.” he smiled “And from him.” he smiled “I had to try.”
“Yes, but lying is not a small feat, Dean.” He was so serious that Dean couldn’t hold a smile back. “Why are you smiling?” the angel asked.
They were heading back to clean up the room where they had performed the spell when Castiel interjected Jack.
And if Dean couldn’t find a part of his celestial being…a part of Castiel as an angel…He could never bring him back. Dean never saw his true form. He had seen glimpses, his shrilling angelic voice, the shadow of his wings, his eyes glowing with grace. But he had never seen all of his might and beauty. He wished he did, somehow, even if it meant burning his eyes out. He must have been a sight, burning with celestial intent, his wings spread. What colour were they? He didn’t even know that. He didn’t even bother to ask him in all these years. And it seems to him that he only met the shadow of the angel. Never truly knowing what the angel had felt for him and just how much he had meant to Dean.
They needed to draw sigils and symbols to secure the zone. In case the Empty followed Jack back. As Dean was drawing sigils on the walls, Eileen was drawing intricate ones around the table. Soon, more than a dozen symbols painted out of lamb’s blood covered the space around the table.
“I’ve brought you this. Don’t be mad… I take these quite often when people aren’t looking.” she handed him a photograph. He took it and was stunned to see him, looking down at his phone and Cas, looking fondly at him.
He kissed him, gently biting his lips. He kissed his jaw, licked his ear lobe, caressed his neck with the soft warmth of his breath. Dean kissed him back, pushing his body forward, wanting to roll over the angel. Feel his hardness against his. Castiel pushed him back in place against the mattress with ease.
“It’s not translating!” he signed, looked at her and specified, talking and facing her so that she could read his lips “I keep trying, but it fails. Every damn time.” Eileen could see he was frustrated. She looked over to the screen, frowning. Sam twitched in his chair, looking at them.
“I told you. There are some things I don’t know. It’s hard to rebuild something when you don’t have the full picture.”
“I don’t need anything Dean. I am at peace now. That’s alri…” Cas had begun to say but Dean cut him.
“Well, we don’t! You need to find another way!” Dean had started shouting, pounding on the table, making Sam startled. Dean was really on edge now, he had more and more trouble accepting the wait and the failures.
“I’ll rest later Sammy” Dean gritted his teeth and looked at his brother, seeing the worry in his brother’s eyes. “What is it? Is Cas okay?” He said, suddenly worried.
He got out to try and find him and when he opened the door, he was surprised to find him less than 30 feet away from the bunker’s front door, seated on a rock, head in his hands. He sat next to him, cross-legged.
“You’re getting cold…yes, maybe we should go back.” And the butterflies fluttered again in Dean’s stomach.
Dean stayed longer in the car, hands on the wheel, just looking in front of him and at nothing in particular. Yes, it had been his final hunt. He had done everything he could, he had kept fighting. For how long? He didn’t even know when it started exactly. Maybe after the fire when he was just a boy, maybe later… but he felt like he had only known hunting all his life. It was time for
Castiel is back at the bunker and spends his days and nights with Dean in the guest room. It had been warded to keep the Empty away from the angel.
“Comes with being in a human body Cas.” Dean was still holding his hand. He brought it back to his mouth, kissing the angel’s knuckles “The pain and all the rest.”
Dean was still trying to breathe normally as Castiel removed himself from him. Eyes closed in bliss. He cleaned them again, as usual. Dean glanced at the angel. He was awesome. He managed to rest his hand on the angel stomach and Castiel held his hand, gently stroking it with his thumb. They both smiled, impossible to let go of each other.
“Cas…” Dean said in a raspy voice, his head against the angel’s. He ached for more contact, he ached to touch him, everywhere.
“What is this?” Dean asks, truly shocked, putting his gun back on the table, hugging people and shaking hands at random. Sam was looking at his brother, a smirk on his face. Eileen was smiling next to him. She came closer to Dean, facing him.
“Er…alright.” Dean answered, slightly amused. “Will you stay close to me then?” Dean reached for Cas’ hand, stroking his thumb on it.
“It’ okay, Dean.” Sam finally said. “It’s okay.” He chanced a look at his brother, holding his face. “You can stop, I will let you. But you have to promise me something, you have to promise me you will grieve. And that you will talk to me.” Dean looked at his baby brother, feeling really rock-bottom crying on the kitchen floor in his brother’s arms.
“Hello.” Jack had materialised in front of them, waving his hand in the air. Dean was jumpy but also very relieved by his presence.
“I’ll help you, come on.” Sam said when he came back, grabbing his brother and putting one of his arms around his shoulders to hold him steady while they headed to Castiel’s room. Dean said nothing and greeted his teeth. His body was aching all over from stress and exhaustion. He steadied himself on his brother. When they arrived to Cas’ room, the angel was waiting in the armchair, looking at Jack’s souvenir box. He rapidly put it back in the drawer when he saw the brothers in the doorframe.
Dean went out to walk Miracle for a bit, some other hunters had already walked her around the bunker but it was nice to get out, even for a quarter of an hour. When he came back everyone was caffeinated and books were piling up. He grabbed a coffee and headed for the study room, where Jody and Donna were working on books and translations.
“Thanks, Dean.” Jack tilted his head “But I don’t feel like I’m…sacrificing. I have been working in Heaven, keeping busy.”
“Would you care for a coffee? I would! Come on, let’s go get some.” she got up, leaving the table and a kiss on Stevie’s head.
“I asked Castiel to help me rebuild Heaven but he told me he should stay here, with you.” Jack answered honestly, making Castiel turn his head and Dean raise his eyebrows even higher.
“I think your words are perfect.” Cas whispered slowly, his hand on Dean’s leg. Dean’s eyes went from his hand to his mouth, his hand again. Just the touch of his hand on his jeans and he felt like that. He couldn’t handle it. He reached for his face and kissed him. He was feeling better today, maybe today they would do…more? Castiel kissed him back, opening his mouth and tasting him, his hand getting tighter and higher around Dean’s leg. Dean moved from Cas’s mouth to his cheek, kissing him tenderly, leaving a trail of kisses down to his neck. Cas moaned when Dean kissed him there. When Dean had discovered how much it aroused him earlier in the week, he had to control himself not to go any further, if it got too far Cas would stop kissing him pretending it wasn’t good for his health. The sounds escaping from the angel’s mouth had been so mesmerizing... He didn’t want to rush him, he wanted to take his time, enjoy every second.
He looked at his hands, strong and softer than they used to be, less calloused than before when he used to hunt and work on his car all the time. He still worked on her of course, but she was less high-maintenance than before. He always found excuses to go for a ride, groceries, walking Miracle around, they would be out of beers or pie…
“You will. But for now, you need to rest. You scared me last night.” He said, and it took everything in Dean not to pull him on the bed with him and kiss him again. “Dean…I’m tougher as you said. You can’t just pull me on the bed and make out with me.” Castiel stated.
It was the seventh day of research and everyone was completely beat. Groups of hunters had shifted around the bunker, just for a change in scenery or simply to compare notes and review the different piles of ‘most promising’ leads stacked up everywhere.
“Rufus lives about five miles that way” Bobby said, waving his hand in the general direction. “With…Aretha”
