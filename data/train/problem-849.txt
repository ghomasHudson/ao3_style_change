'Don't move.'
Sherlock is there, more pale than he ever had the right to, eyes wide open, palms thrown up in his chest, which is heaving wildly. John stops and they look at each other for several moments, each on their own journey relearning how to breath. John shoves the pickaxe again at the side of the open lid of the coffin, until he's able to pull it out completely, and throw over his head to the hole opening.
He looks at the mirror again, and his reflection doesn't show the John Watson he knows. It shows a light blond cat with blue eyes and long whiskers. He processes the information for a second before his brain shuts down.
'Serbia. While I was away. It's not important, John.' he tells him stiffly and tugs again to get free. This time John lets him go. Sherlock grasps his hanged up t-shirt and puts it on, shifting as if to leave the room.
If Sherlock could choose a way to be shot and die, it would certainly would be in the middle of his forehead, where the effect is instantaneous. This idiot would end up shooting him sideways, through his cheekbone or somewhere equally dreadful, leaving him with some sort of paralysis and very much alive.
She wanted him to stay with her, and him knowing the truth wasn't the sole peril to this. He didn't leave, granted, but something could still take him away from her. In her logic: Sherlock. Again.
John tenses again beside him, but he just shrugs. She doesn't acknowledge John, and is taken downstairs. They barely notice another agent placing her gun in a plastic bag and following his colleagues.
Excellent. One less issue. As he's in a row of asking favours, he sends the next one.
I'm over there on tumblr: thanks-mike-stamford
John unlocks his bike from the rail outside the clinic, throwing an 'Afternoon!' to Martha, the fellow nurse who passes by him walking in the Tube direction. On the other side of the street the bakery flicks on the shop facade lights, as the sky got yellow strikes and the light blue faded slowly. A guy in a grey jacket eating a croissant just blinks at newly illuminated spot.
Bringing Wiggins to drug everyone into torpor so they could run with MI-6 top secret documents and whatever exists in that notebook was something Sherlock absolutely knew would upset John in many ways, so John is not surprised in the least. It makes sense that they need to wipe out Magnussen's information on Anna-Greta and for that a valuable exchange is required. That Sherlock had the balls to do it also doesn't make John blink.
Which is why, after work, instead of going back home he opts for invading Mycroft's office, a place he hasn't been to in years. There's a young man behind a large computer monitor at the reception, with a bluetooth phone device connected to his ear. It's the type of worker trained to ignore whoever stops at the desk and makes you feel displaced, which is not going to happen today.
'I just don't know where to go.' he presses his palm over his brow in frustration. 'What do I even have? A blog I haven't updated in over two years?'
'And you want to stay with your daughter.'
Ella writes some more. ‘What do you do when you feel like that?’
‘Just having fun. I like to dance.’ he whispered back, still holding firmly on his back. ‘She never really wants anything from me. I can be myself. And she didn’t dance with me on the reception, so…’
'No. Shut up. I always presumed it's petty and childish revenge, however, in the light of this... occurrence, I believe the only thing I can say is I told you so. Hope your drive to London is safe.'
They all look at each other waiting for something to happen. ‘So… that was it? I think we covered it then?’ John breaks the silence. David takes a deep breath.
He needs to take a breath three times before managing to speak. 'I saw the renovation's folder in your laptop.'
Mycroft studies him, and moves to open a drawer at his left. He takes a large file from it, deposits on the table, and thumbs hastily through the pages, skimming the contents. John waits patiently. He finally sees something of interest, stopping to read in its entirety.
They had started giggling while kissing. John fell to the sofa besides Sherlock, who drove closer instead of budging up. His body had been all turned in John’s direction, like a sunflower to the light.  John noticed he was slouching a bit to maintain the eye-level, and that he kept moving minutely as if contemplating something, looking directly at his face.
doesn't remember me?' he growls, gesturing the gun to accentuate his words. 'She ruined my life and my face!'
'Ginésio Fernandes de Sá killed a man in a fist-fight in a pub a year ago and was deported to Guiné-Bissau, but his brother Flaviano has unknown whereabouts. Michael Morris is in trial for months now in the US, but Mycroft fears he'll manage to get away. He's doing what he can along CIA. Both Park Hyojeong and Aadhya Jhaveri are wanted by Interpol. It surprises me she told you her real name.'
'Oops.' he jumps back. The cat looks up at him, blinking their purple eyes.
He turns to the fireman calling him. Apparently the fire is almost fully controlled. 'Are you the owner of the car, sir? I have some questions.'
'I understand that you had to. If you promise not to do again, I forgive you.'
He smiles to himself at the memory, and lies down on the bed, turning off the bedside lamp. He is still sitting down when the living room door opens and closes.
time, even before… you know. That… event. From three years ago.’
John laughs all the way closing the door, and he will forever deny but he does get a bit apprehensive.
-- * --
'You can't make these decisions about my life on your own, idiot.' John had rage whispered over Watson's sleeping form. 'I thought you had stopped doing this.'
‘Sounds good.’
Mike Stamford. Well, he wasn’t much surprised he hadn’t gone. The last time they talked had been at Sherlock’s funeral. Sherlock liked Mike, and it was reciprocal. Mike never bothered with Sherlock’s bad manners, in fact he seemed to think they were amusing. Probably Mike had more oversight than John attributed to him.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, and see you soon! :D
'Ta, mate.'
Sorry John. Not really sorry.
'Oh. That's… very thoughtful. Thank you.'
He pauses and frowns. Definitely thin ice now. 'I thought you didn't want me to.' he says slowly.
He dry swallows. 'I will.'
'And?' John motions with his head to encourage him.
If before he felt uncomfortable being in Mary's house, now he feels oppressed. All her stuff is still here, since he doesn't want to deal with it, and doesn't want to think about it.
He sighs. 'My blog is too public now. It would be like screaming to the whole country.'
They give him carrot and parsnip soup eventually. He has no idea what time (or day) it is, or what happened exactly after the explosion, and people keep ignoring his questions. Sherlock doesn't seem to be in the ward he's located, the other patients are too quiet. Well, most of them at least. Mr. Clearwater makes a scene every time he needs an examination. In general he is too tired to even think about any explanations so he just relents to resting, as the nurses suggest he does.
'Just a few more days and they can take them off. You'll scratch all you want.' Rosie knocks her hand down with a resounding
She comes forward. 'Are you afraid? You coward.'
'Oh yes, the insufferable fat. I expulsed him. And I'm not even talking about
He hops from the car without waiting for approval from the cop. The team is collecting evidence through the whole house. 'Bathroom?' he asks a guy with a ziploc bag in his hand full of hair. They guy gestures to a corridor, and John follows. Two cops try to impede him. 'I'm a doctor, let me analyse his condition.' he replies in a voice that invites no questions.
He had needed to go to a different publisher, who was actually interested in The Afghan War, a compilation of reflections on what he's seen and gone through, the army mindset and how encounters with locals changed his whole perspective on the british role in the Middle East. His editor liked the personal touch to what otherwise would be sanitised facts on the war, and had suggested working on his other areas of knowledge, and that's how his medical work transpired.
John smiles fondly at this. He goes on. 'Victor was incredulous, so he confronted Mr. Trevor. Turns out the man has a stroke and dies instantly.'
'I'm awful at dancing and you know it.' he replies trying not to step on her feet or bump into her. 'Why this all of a sudden?'
Mycroft has descended from the helicopter during the whole commotion, and gives some instructions to the people still in the area. They take photographs of everything, and some of them pass John in their way to inside the manor. A guy with a distinctive mole in his nose and a woman in glasses prepare to remove the corpse.
To be honest, she wasn't getting any younger. She actually liked the thrill and danger, but her body and mind would soon start to disagree. Perhaps this could be the last time. The regularity helped to build her own finances for once, few more years and she could just drop it and settle, have a family.
' on-screen Sherlock recites to Rosie, back to the camera.
, to which he instantly knew it was another of her lies, because who saves money to just randomly spend on a 50k pounds car in freaking London?
'This was the first. Time! You've
Sherlock is surprisingly putting the coffee on, fully dressed, so he goes to the bread and toaster. They sit across at the table, Sherlock only gulping a large mug of coffee and scrolling down his phone while John eats.
She smiles to herself, as if reminding of other memories she wouldn't say aloud. John lets her be, and tries to imagine a younger version of her and Sherlock.
By the way, no, I didn't watch the new teaser. I accidentally saw stuff about some parts of it and I was so anxious I had to avoid tumblr and twitter for days. I'm better now, but still checking them with caution. And yet first time I opened twitter after first thing I see is THAT AD AND PIC. A very good meta on tumblr calmed me a bit.
They smile softly at nothing. Sherlock thinks her ceiling is the most interesting thing. The dose makes him feel like just after waking up, the drowsy sensation that you could rest your eyes five more minutes before coming to full awakeness. It's quite comfortable. 'We could play something.'
He sighs.
'Coddle you?' Sherlock's whole face is a question mark, but the narrowed eyes indicate he's already losing his patience. 'How on earth am I coddling you?'
‘Ok.’ he answered without so much as blinking. ‘What about Anna-Greta?’
'Morning!'
He didn't know what to say to that. So he just acquiesced. 'Ok. Sorry.'
'Would you take care of Rosie?'
Happy new year everyone!
She asks this while looking at him pitifully, and John hates it,
But everything is fine now. Sherlock is back. John's life has a reason again, although he shouldn't say that to his therapist, because she would scold him. Sherlock lives means John Watson lives.
Mycroft reappears to settle some personal loose endings.
'We are the worst people in the world to sit and talk about important things, Mrs. Hudson.'
'Last but not least, some fluids. I guess you'll be alright soon.'
'It helped until it didn't. I was so young. And as years became decades, I would think to myself, what am I doing here? Why am I doing this? When you remove the love factor it gets so hard to understand some of our decisions isn't it dear?'
'I'm fine. It's fine. I just… do you really think this is going to work?'
ANNOUNCEMENT: I won't be able to update until Friday 11th. Everything will get regular by then.
The cat makes a clicking sound. John never owned a cat, but one of his highschool girlfriends did. Tessa hated communicating clearly what she wanted (pot and kettle he supposes), preferring talking indirectly around the subject, or giving long-suffering sighs when something was annoying her, and left him to find out what was the problem sometimes for days. But her parents worked in a hospital and were never home after school, which meant they could have a lot of fun at her house while being unsupervised.
'Yeah, I could say the same.' he responds, still standing by the door.
'Well, you better start.' he barks, going upstairs again. Rosie picks up his mood and starts to whine. She fusses during the whole lunch, barely eats, and John is a minute from snapping. He gives up her potatoes, change her clothes, takes his brown bag and Rosie's bag and leaves with her.
'This is a crucial decision, Detective Inspector.' Sherlock argues, leaning forward in his office chair. 'In fact, on our website there's a whole blog post about the difference between illegal and prescription drugs accidents, in which-'
He just shrugs. 'As for my parents, well. You met them, they can be as affectionate as one expects parents to, but they are not really attached. Mummy went back to academia after I went to boarding school, following Mycroft's lead. Dad was always doing something, or after her. They weren't neglectful, but not much present, so I'm not even sure they were aware of what was going on.'
Not beta-ed, not brit-picked, not first language. Any wrong grammar please let me know.
'Look who came. I thought you would be moving out by now.' she scorns at him weakly.
He replied

But Sherlock just picked up all the files and photographs resting on top of his duvet, organizing back in Mycroft’s folder, and putting them away. He glanced briefly to the door, where he could see his brother’s personal assistant, whom John insisted in calling Anthea, planted outside. No one would get in, even by force. John still wouldn’t look at him.
Needless to say, the favour he invoked was to release the man. The guards were supposed to heavily hint at how to find Mary. They would surely come in contact sooner or later.
He is going to do just that.
'Perhaps she thinks Anna covered her past? So she doesn't need to worry?' John suggests, still flabbergasted at the pictures in front of him. All those people probably held him at gunpoint in some moment of the past. Moriarty's special snipers team.
'Mm.'
Same, not betaed, not brit-picked, not English-speaker, any mistakes please point them out and explain to me! Thank you!
'It doesn't have to be immediate. It's actually better if you took your time, because she will perceive you were angry but willing to forgive after some thought.'
'I lived in many countries, you know?' she puts her elbows on the table and supports her chin on her hands. 'I have many stories to tell. You could just ask.'
Given the shitty year he's been having, John is not surprised that things haven't finished bollocksing up.
John starts to panic again. The conversation with Mycroft, when Sherlock was in the hospital, comes to his mind. Is he intruding too much? He doesn’t doubt Sherlock would accept them if John asked but, is it fair? He guesses it’s time to see Ella. So many questions are making him beyond nervous.
'Oh. Yeah, sorry.' he scoops up his boots in one hand, holds the grocery bag in another. 'Do you need something?'
!' He yells in the highest pitch John has ever heard him producing.
two of us.' he uses the hand securing the man's short hair to scratch the face on the floor a bit. 'By the way, I don't appreciate you threatening him, just be warned.'
At the hospital they had to suck out the blood. The tubes were removed the night John came home. Mycroft made sure he would be safe, so John could rest. He would come back there after lunch.
As he confirms the amount of each spice that is supposed to go into the curry, Sherlock asks 'You never cook. What motivated you today?'
Sherlock follows a squirrel with his gaze, running up a tree. 'He wasn't always like that. If anything, my escapade was his motivation. I realised after he found me he went hysterical when he couldn't contact me, nor find any address with my name on the lease. This of course led to the state you're more familiar with: overbearing, interfering and extremely nosy.'
not beta-ed, not brit-picked, not first language. Any wrong grammar please let me know.
'More Than Honey if you want to know.' he says without looking up.
Out of nowhere a violin song starts. He looks for the source and finds Anna adjusting her phone on the amplifier. He distinguishes the waltz Sherlock played on his wedding. Terrible, terrible night. Anna comes to him smiling with all her teeth, places his hand on her waist and holds the other one with her own. They start to move to the music, but not really in a natural way. It's been months and John absolutely forgot the steps, and furthermore Anna's belly is on the way.
. Now that was precious. He tries to remember when that had happened before.
'We can't always be on top.' Sherlock replies smoothly.
'Surprisingly he didn't. He only found out that night at the Magnussen tower, and she shot him in the heart for his troubles.'
John feels as if a weight is removed from his chest. He nods and gets up to leave. At the door, Mycroft calls him. 'John? Thank you for taking care of him. I don't think he would let me.'
They are in the dark themselves. Since the bedroom is at the back of the building, street lights don't really reach inside, and the neighbours' windows have their curtains fastened, hopefully also in slumber.
'It means that I don't know if living here is a good idea!' he snaps. Sherlock's eyes are wide as saucers, his mouth hanging open a bit.
Hence, the wedding had been filled with Anna’s guests. Basically, everyone from the clinic. Dolores and a woman from the cleaning staff were bridesmaids. Janine, that she had known for less than a year, and how they met John doesn’t have the single idea. The other people were completely strangers to him, and now that he puts some thought in it, they were probably to her too.
'I'll serve you boys, come on John, sit.'
Almost a year as a father hasn't prepared John for the advent of Rosie standing up holding onto the sofa of 221B's living room. The thing with a small child having a lot of of mobility is that they don't really know how to classify what is dangerous, so while he's happy she's growing up healthily, now he can't leave her on her own on the carpet for even a minute.
'She told me that first Mycroft kidnapped me.'
They hold each other longer than the song duration.
-- * --
The biggest issue with Mary Watson is how legally slippery she is in her profession. A CIA rogue with the ability to invade MI6 databases in front of the runner man himself, changes identities like clothes and is not even caught on tax evasion. She had them the same way Moriarty had. Nonetheless, Mary is no Moriarty. She was never interested in being an invincible evil criminal genius for the sake of it. She definitely wouldn't kill herself to win a mind game.
'I am. Trust me. You'll do well.'
There's a lump in his throat that he hopes doesn't evolve. 'And I will not lie to you again.' he adds quickly, because he supposes he should. John looks contented to hear, so it's a win.
"Hey, Haley?" He shouted out the door to his secretary, who was busy typing up some recent paperwork. She glanced towards him with a questioning look in her eyes. "Tell the others I'm taking off. I need to go check on my mate." The petite beta smiled at him and nodded, immediately sending the memo out as John grabbed his jacket and keys, dashing out the door and back to his pregnant omega, his family.
The young omega had to force himself into the posh car that his father sent, every instinct screaming at him to run away as fast as he could. John put a steadying hand on the small of his back and smiled gently. Sherlock held onto that as he climbed in with Addy, deftly putting her in the pre-installed car seat that his parents had likely ordered some servant to put into the vehicle before they came to fetch the small family. John climbed in after and let his mate lean and curl against him, watching the other alpha calmly. Siger was watching his son in turn, eyes hard and mouth slightly down turned. The younger alpha bared his teeth but turned to pay attention to the omega who tensed when he caught sight of his sire.
"It's a long story DJ, I'll be right there." John waved to Ford and exchanged a cool look with Mycroft before hurrying out the door and down to Sherlock's room. The teenager himself was tossing about, disturbing the IV drip and reopening the cuts on his wrist. "Sherlock! Love, calm down!" John rushed to Sherlock's side, putting a hand on his shoulder and forcibly pushing the younger teen down. Sherlock snapped and growled at the offending hand before his mind recognized the doctor standing next to him.
"How old are you?" Mary asked, turning her head curiously to the side.
Both of his older brothers nodded solemnly and left the room quietly, glaring at each other in the hallway. John relaxed as the two left, feeling his hands move automatically to comfort the boy in his arms. His life had turned upside down with the realization that this boy he'd so loved back in secondary school was back in his life. Now, it was as if nothing had really changed, except Sherlock wasn't in the hospital because a bully beat him up in John's place, but put there by his own hand.
"221B, sounds like this flat my parents own on Baker Street. They were gunna send me there when my birthday came around." Sherlock muttered thoughtfully, staring around the room in interest as John let them in. The alpha set his bags down gratefully, almost sighing as he stretched his muscles.
John wasn't good enough, that he could tell right off. He could practically see the thoughts flying by in her eyes. "How lovely." Her tone was flat, and her eyes were fixated on her youngest son who was now bouncing their daughter around in circles. Sherlock was every bit the dotting mother he had feared he wouldn't be when they had first bonded. Addison was his world and he showed it with every action everyday. John was so proud of the man Sherlock was. Addy's laugh echoed in the confines of the home and her smile could light up the sky, but even that did not thaw out Mrs. Holmes, who was glaring at her youngest now. John resisted the urge to growl and instead left the woman to give his mate a long, loving kiss. He heard her huff behind him but he really didn't care. This was his mate and he was allowed to show the affection in public or his mate's parents' house if he so chose.
Sherlock looked baffled. “Why… Why did you do that?”
Finished with the medical side of things, Dr. Watson got up and rejoined Sherlock on the bed. “Christ, Sherlock…” He didn’t know what else to say, so he pulled the other man into a hug once again.
Sherlock mumbled something incoherent.
Chapter 4 from Sherlock's perspective
“You have nothing to be sorry for, Sherlock. You did exactly what you said you would. You came to me when you needed help, and that’s all I can ask of you.” He ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, continuing his calming ministrations.
CW: Small about of sexual content in this chapter.
It wasn’t that Sherlock didn’t want John’s company. He just didn’t want John’s worry, or worse yet, his pity. He knew that was a stupid thing to fear. John had dealt with PTSD ever since he came back from Afghanistan, but he had never been
Sherlock took a sip from the teacup. Or tried to. He had forgotten to fill it. He poured in some hot water. It was the first time today that he had gotten out of bed. Or out of sofa, he supposed. He began to catalogue the days since the beginning.
“Great. Now, what are three things you can feel?”
“And what do you think you’re doing?”
The blond man slid off his lap and knelt on the floor. “Sherlock, darling… You do please me, even without sex. If this makes you uncomfortable, we don’t have to do it right now. Not ever, if you don’t want to.”
Sherlock lay on the couch facing the wall for much of the day. Lestrade called around 1:00 in the afternoon, and now he was making tea. He hadn’t eaten since the feeble attempt at spaghetti the day before. Maybe he should try again.
Grabbing his supplies, Sherlock sat on the edge of his bed facing away from the door. He didn’t think. He had stopped thinking as soon as the calculations were complete. Long fingers grasped the handle of the small blade, angling it so that its tip pointed down towards his exposed thigh. The first cut was shallow. Barely visible, even after he pulled the flesh on either side to encourage it to bleed. He kept going, not really getting much deeper.
“Four and a half,” he murmured to himself. “That’s doable.” He thought back to earlier that day. He had gotten a call from Lestrade, who simply refused to text instead of call, confirming his thoughts and asking for any details he could give for the trial. Sherlock had rattled off the list of condemning factors he had gotten at the crime scene before abruptly hanging up.
John was almost asleep when he heard a knock at his door. It was soft and uncertain and that worried the doctor. Sherlock wasn’t the type to be shy about waking him up. Not a case then. He got up and opened the door to find the detective standing in the hallway, shoulders slouched and hand grasped tightly around something.
“I…” Sherlock looked around, disjointedly. “221b. Right..?” He looked back at John, hope and fear warring in his blue eyes.
TW: Unhealthy behaviors created by abuse, Flashbacks, sort of non-consentual happenings
Sherlock recoiled from John, breath coming faster once again. He pushed himself away from the embrace and backed as far away as he could on the bed, shaking violently.
“Sherlock?” John asked quietly. “Why don’t we get you cleaned up?”
For a while, the only answer was too-quick breathing. Eventually, Sherlock spoke. “I-I thought that it would k-keep you from g-g-getting angry with me.”
“I know you do… I want to tell you. I do, I want to, but I don’t want you to…” he got quieter, “to think I’m weak.”
“Got any ideas?” It was Lestrade.
“I’m… making tea. Obviously.” He tried to put as much of his usual (old) snap into his voice, but it just came out sounding tired and uncertain.
He took the plastic mechanical pencil and let out a millimeter of graphite; just enough so it wouldn’t break when he used it. He took it with him into the bathroom and filled the tub. Soft skin always helped with this method. The water was hot enough to burn. As Sherlock got in he admired the way the overly hot water turned his pale skin red beneath the shimmering surface. His arms slipped below the surface of the water, softening, and burning, and turning a shade of red that was definitely inadvisable. He lay like that, staring up at the ceiling and letting the water cool down.
“Nothing. Get Anderson. We need that forensics sweep.” He paused, thinking. Had the Consulting Detective gone paler before he left? “And would you stop calling him that? What’s he ever done to you?”
The doctor stood in the doorway, staring, knowing he should do something.
thought Sherlock.
“’M sorry, Kai. I’m srry. I know y’need help. I should b’ helping you right now, not breaking down li’this. ’M so sorry.”
“You’ve got to breathe more slowly or you’re going to start hyperventilating. Breathe with me, okay?” He began to make his breathing obvious and deep so Sherlock could follow along. It didn’t take long, thankfully, for breaths to come more slowly once again.
that if we were ever to meet in person, that he would tear me apart. Fuck me and rape me until he was satisfied, without any concern for how I felt.”
“Here, Sherlock, smell this.” He gently waved the open bottle of sour smelling liquid near Sherlock’s face. “It’s all right. Everything is okay. You’re safe in your bed in 221b, and I’m right here next to you.” Gradually, as John spoke and wafted the unusual scent towards the detective, the glazed look in Sherlock’s eyes began to clear slightly, and John decided it was safe to try and touch him. He set the bottle down on the nightstand and slowly lowered himself onto the bed in front of Sherlock. “Sherlock, can you hear me?” He reached out and placed a calloused hand on Sherlock’s knee.
“Yeah, Sherlock?”
A soft, too-high voice worked its way out of the detective’s throat, but John couldn’t understand what he was saying. Instead of trying to decipher it, he simply made nonsense soothing noises until the words resolved into something more intelligible.
“John, hey. I think something’s wrong with Sherlock.”
Sherlock continued to shiver under John’s touch, but he looked around himself, trying to determine what was real and what was just a figment of his imagination.
John moved around to the side of the bed on which Sherlock was sitting. The detective’s eyes were glassy and his hand was loosely gripping a crafting blade. John slowly reached down and tried to take the razor from his friend, but Sherlock’s hand tightened around the handle.
After taking off the bandages, he set the tip of the blade to his left arm, just between two pencil scratches. It sent a shiver of anticipation down his spine. He slowly dragged it across his arm, watching the thin red line that appeared in its wake. This was what he needed. He sighed. Around 20 thin stripes later, all very precisely made between pencil scratches, he wiped up the blood already drying on his bare arm. Almost none had leaked from the cuts, but it was more than yesterday. He cleaned and bandaged them before he went back to his couch and sat in front of the television until he drifted off into an uneasy sleep.
. Usually he tried not to feel, but right now he needed it. Anything was better than the empty, separate feeling he had from the day before. He riffled through the drawer and found what he was looking for.
Sherlock leaned into the touch, signaling that it was appreciated. John scooted a bit closer and drew the taller man into a gentle embrace.
John went and grabbed the medical supplies he’d used earlier while keeping an eye on his flatmate. He wasn’t sure why but he knew that he didn’t want to let him out of his sight, at least for the time being.
Sherlock surprised him by turning towards him and burying his face in John’s chest, hands grasping at the cloth of the doctor’s jumper. His breaths, barely noticeable before, began to speed up and rise in his chest. Before long, Sherlock was shaking in John’s arms, hyperventilating and choking on his own breath.
As John went into doctor mode once again, cleaning and re-bandaging his friend’s wounds, Sherlock began to speak.
“Sherlock,” he began with concern, “do you really want this?”
Holding the pencil in shaking hands, he hovered over his left arm trying to work up the nerve to do it.
The victim had been raped and murdered by her boyfriend, who was now, thankfully, in police custody.
He remembered the time he had spent far from his home at Baker Street, working to make sure Moriarty’s network was gone for good. Without John. This hadn’t bothered him then, but he supposed he had had other things on his mind at the time.
It had begun with a case from Scotland Yard, called in five days ago. Sherlock was bored, having only had two cases the week prior, and immediately hailed a cab to the crime scene. Once he got to the apartment he dashed up the stairs to the apartment. The body was laying prostrate on the couch with patches of mostly-dried blood on the cushions. He glanced around the scene: a one bedroom apartment. Barely at that. It could almost be called a studio.
The other man nodded, took the offered hand, and followed John downstairs to the kitchen.
John was surprised. Although Sherlock had been making a somewhat more concerted effort to be considerate towards the doctor, ‘thank you’ was still an uncommon phrase. “What for?” he asked, hoping to get Sherlock to talk about what was troubling him.
“Look for the boyfriend,” Sherlock said, and walked out.
It was John.
After a moment of confused contemplation, Sherlock nodded. It was all he could do to keep from passing out or vomiting. He was in the full throes of panic now, shaking and hyperventilating, sweating and convulsing. Finally, he was able to force out a few stuttering words. “I-I thought that it would k-keep you from g-g-getting angry with me.”
Day 2 - The second day had been… interesting. He felt like he was
By this point their thighs were touching on the couch. John was beginning to wonder what his companion was really trying to say.
“My s-skull. Teacups.”
The detective interrupted, trying desperately to stem the anger he knew would follow that question. “Be quiet, for once, would you?” He kissed John on the lips. Reaching to take hold of the blond hair, he deepened the kiss, preventing John from pulling away. He bit the doctor’s lower lip lightly as he pulled away, eliciting a low groan from the man.
Sherlock looked down at his leg in mild surprise and flinched. “Oh. Yeah. I uh, forgot.”
John was stupefied with sorrow and rage. He had figured it was something he’d done or said, but that something so innocuous and well intended could be turned into such a weapon of torture brought up feelings in him that he had never experienced in such volumes.
That sound shattered John’s heart. He tried to keep his movements slow and measured as he went back to Sherlock but he was filled with anxiety for his friend. Sherlock shied away as John drew closer.
“Oh dear… Sherlock, I think I need to redress your thigh. It’s bleeding again.”
Sherlock didn’t react to his entrance. He didn’t try to cover the marks, or wipe away the blood, or even glance in his direction.
Sherlock was almost inaudible. “The pet name you used.” His voice broke when he said it. “Sweetheart. That’s what he called me. He never used my name. Just Sweetheart.” There was a sudden amount of venom in his voice as he spat out the word a second time.
“Sherlock, what’re you—”
The panicking man didn’t respond at all, continuing to hyperventilate and shake. It was clear to John that he wasn’t entirely aware of what was happening. John cursed under his breath, wishing he’d seen the problem earlier. So much for
Lestrade never got used to these cases. He leaned his forehead against the wall of his office, soaking in the coolness of the glass. The girl had been raped and killed by her boyfriend of several years. He, of course, was denying it even though the evidence (provided by the unfathomable observations of Sherlock Holmes) was irrefutable.
“John.”
Eventually, after his shaking had abated to a mild tremulousness, Sherlock sat up and stretched out his limbs, sore after the hour and a half or so of tense muscles. John was distressed to see that Sherlock’s thrashing had caused him to aggravate the cuts on his leg. They had already bled through the bandaging.
Thanks for reading. This has been a very cathartic experience for me as I work my way through a PTSD flare. I hope it can serve as both entertainment and educational content. PTSD and self-harm are big problems that aren't always obvious, and helping people in your life who are struggling is hard, but please keep trying. We all want help, even if we don't know how to properly express it.
he thought.
He made some toast, ate two bites, and began to feel sick to his stomach. He’d stick to tea.
Why did this case have to come while John was away?
The taller man’s eyes darted around, his mind doubtless cataloguing everything without the conscious knowledge of its owner. It was the communication part that would be challenging. “Uhm… Th-the fireplace.”
Fact 3: Sherlock had had a severe PTSD flare about five weeks ago.
After Sherlock hung up so suddenly, a few things clicked into place for Lestrade. He didn’t know the detective well, but he knew him better than most people on this earth, accepting John Watson and Mycroft Holmes. Sherlock was upset. He had seen it before, but rarely, and usually only when John or Mrs. Hudson was in danger. Greg didn’t know what could be causing it this time, except for possibly the case earlier in the week. He didn’t see what was so different about this particular case. It was pretty cut and dried once you got all the facts. Disturbing, sure, but what made Greg moderately upset didn’t usually even phase the younger Holmes brother.
“But… Those are proof that I failed. That I’m not worth your affection and sentiment.”
Even with this realization, Sherlock needed to maintain the proper order of things. That meant keeping John happy. “But… but you… you like sex. You c-can’t argue that you d-d-don’t.” Jesus, he was stuttering now. What a miserable excuse for a genius he was. As he spoke, he looked down at Kai’s, no,
“Well, if this is going somewhere, it’ll have to come out sometime, Sweetheart.”
all right.
Sherlock didn’t yell during his nightmares, but sometimes John would wake up in the middle of the night to the whistle of the tea kettle and soft, trembling notes on the violin. At these times, John wished desperately that he could go downstairs and comfort his friend, but the few times he tried, Sherlock refused to make eye contact and quickly retreated to his bedroom without speaking.
John remembered the clenched fist and reached for the detective’s hand. “Darling, open your hand.”
The doctor didn’t try to touch the cowering man on the bed in front of him, knowing it could possibly make things worse. Instead he calmly tried to remind Sherlock of reality. “Sherlock, darling, I don’t know what you’re seeing, but it’s not real. You’re here with me, at Baker Street.” He glanced around, silently cursing the lack of anything he could use to help ground his flatmate. Finally his eyes set on a small bottle of low-molar citric acid Sherlock had been using in an experiment. It wasn’t much, but it would do. John slowly went over to the sideboard to get it, making sure to avoid fast movements. As he turned back he heard Sherlock beginning to whimper through his hyperventilation.
thought John.
“Sherlock, what’re you—”
Day 1 - After returning from the crime scene five days ago he had lain down on the couch facing the wall, curled in a ball as he sometimes did when in a “mood.” He hadn’t gotten up more than once or twice a day since. He stared at the wall, his phone, the chairs by the unused fireplace. For the first day, that’s all he did. He didn’t eat. He didn’t drink. He just stared.
It had been several weeks since the Incident, as John had privately begun calling it. Sherlock was doing better, at least outwardly. Even though he had been granted unprecedented access to the genius’s brain in the time since, John still could barely hazard a guess at what was going on in Sherlock’s mind.
Sherlock began to sniff the air, making John giggle ever so slightly. “Uh, the tea. And your shampoo.”
Lestrade sounded mired somewhere between confused and concerned. “He just, I dunno mate. I had him on a case earlier this week, Monday, and he solved it in two seconds flat, and then he went sort of… pale, and left without saying anything else. Then when I called him today his voice was shaking. Sherlock. With a shaking voice. I dunno what’s up with him. I thought you would want to know.”
“Well then, darling,” said the doctor once he was sure his voice was under control, “I will just have to find new terms of endearment for you.”
John laid a gentle hand on the detective’s arm. Sherlock was trembling. “Why don’t you come in and sit with me a while?”
“Yeah. Just got them from Tesco this afternoon. You back with me now, Sherlock?”
The injured man slowly nodded. John got up from the floor and eased his hands out of Sherlock’s grip. “Stay here, I’ll be right back.” Sherlock just nodded again, shoulders slumped, staring down at the floor.
The detective gently ate the piece of biscuit from John’s fingers. “Ginger?” he asked, blinking.
“Don’t just say that, Sherlock. Be truthful with me.”
“Don’t fight it. Let me thank you,” whispered Sherlock, lips still pressed lightly against his own.
“You’re doing amazing, darling. Almost done. What are two things you can smell?”
TW: References to self-harm
“Cars o-outside. Mrs. Hudson’s radio. The… the rain on the window. Wind outside.”
Sherlock looked again, longer this time, before hiccoughing a bit and stammering out “Y-you, your h-h-hair…” He seemed confused.
“W-why’d you stop?” asked the younger man, voice quavering.
“Thank you, John.” The first step. Express that you appreciate the other person’s efforts.
Pain. Not in his rectum though, in his thigh. Sherlock looked down to discover around 30 shallow cuts and one deeper one, the blade still resting at its end. This one was deeper than he’d ever gone before. The edges weren’t touching, and it was actually bleeding.
He stood and shook his head vigorously. It wasn’t an option. He knocked on the door.
He tried to hid his anxiety behind a mask of emotionlessness as he glanced over in John’s direction.
He didn’t know why these things were still affecting him so. He had never had an experience like this before, although the event precipitating these symptoms had happened so very long ago. Usually he was able to shove the memories, the
“Here, darling,” Sherlock took the proffered cup and drank in silence, trying to work up his nerve. Finally, he put his cup down.
John looked down at the face of his friend and saw the sincerity in his now clear blue eyes. He shifted so he was laying down alongside Sherlock, their noses almost touching. Leaning forward ever so slightly, he pressed his lips to Sherlock’s as gently as he could. After a moment John brought his hands up, one to rest on the back of his friend’s neck, one to run his fingers through Sherlock’s dark, slightly matted curls. He deepened the kiss slightly before breaking off. They were both breathing a little harder than before.
wanted? Was this a new way for Kai to make Sherlock feel worthless?
The detective took the cup from him without a word, and they sat together in silence for a while, sipping their beverages. After a time, Sherlock set down his teacup and turned to John.
“He did… horrible things to me, John,” said Sherlock. “And the worst part is, he never laid a finger on me. We never once met in person after our initial encounter over the summer. He did all this to me, and he made sure that I
“Shit,” muttered the doctor, and ran to the train station.
Sherlock breathed in sharply as John entered the room. For a moment, he thought the person coming in from the kitchen was much taller. Taller even than himself. Tall, and thin, and gangly, and dark haired… But then it was John again. John who was shorter than Sherlock. John who was stocky and well muscled. John who had blond hair with a few streaks of grey running through it. It only alleviated a portion of his anxiety.
The man above him began to kiss down Sherlock’s neck.
John continued to encourage him when he paused. When Sherlock had finished, he continued.
“No,” he whispered. He couldn’t do this to John. He had promised. He didn’t drop the pencil, but he stood and slowly went up to John’s door. They hadn’t slept in the same bed since that first night but right now Sherlock needed the closeness of laying next to his partner. He hesitated at the door, leaning his forehead against the smooth wood. His hand was clenched tightly around the pencil. This was his last chance to cause the pain that would clear his mind.
Within minutes, Sherlock was calmly asleep for the first time in a week. John looked at his friend’s sleeping face, and sighed contentedly. He had never been happier in his life.
Attempting to stave off this new mode of attack, he tried to equivocate. “I… I want you to be happy. I want to please you.” His trembling had begun to increase to more of a full blown shake. He was letting him down. He wouldn’t be able to please him.
Finally, sniffing hard, John got his voice under control and interrupted Sherlock’s rambling apologies to a person who wasn’t there, who hadn’t been in Sherlock’s life for over a decade.
He laughs and just to work him up he goes to the fridge, takes a photo of the half lemon tart and sends to Sherlock. Seconds after he receives the answer.
On the thirteenth day a storm takes Brighton, with thunders and everything. Rosie is very afraid of the noise, so Sherlock takes her to the balcony and explains all the science behind precipitation, including why rainfall happens, all the temperatures water can reach before changing state, electricity discharge at the atmosphere and why the sky gets dark. It's a long and boring monologue, so she stops crying and sleeps half through it. John doesn't know if he never noticed or just didn't care, but in any way the takes a picture on his phone, and he is sure Sherlock didn't see it.
'Of course you did.' John rolls his eyes, turning back to the email. Sherlock had already started the second croissant. He decides not to comment on it. Some bills, another anonymous threatening letter to Sherlock (who just snorts in response), and one envelope from… Hungary?
'Just treat him like before. He's slow but not stupid, he'll get it eventually.'
'It wasn't

The other ones. The one Mary put there. The ones from his time away whose existence John is barely aware.
He feels like he smoked weed again. Everything is very slow. John loves him back.
‘Strange how?’ Sherlock asks, steepling his fingers under his chin in the praying lookalike fashion.
But Mary Morstan would have a proper chance to live this time.
,' he gestures with his fingers. 'blow up. Won't be pretty. I bet Sherlock dearest would get upset, he does seem attached to his pet.'
This is so different from alcohol. He had to get off the bus because everyone was
'This is completely irrational. I don't even like women, I told you on the first day we met.'
Now that he's living with Anna again, he can't stop comparing to life in 221B. Sherlock could be a very unnerving person when he wanted to. But save the occasions he wants to drug John, he is very obvious about it. With Anna is like there's a secret agenda always dictating their interactions, one that she wants accomplished but won't make it transparent. Some of their conversations are actually cringeworthy when he review them. She played with him since the very beginning.
John stops bringing a piece of toast to his mouth and wonders if eating now means discussion. He puts it back on his plate.
'Hey. The first day, at Angelo's? I
'This is absolutely lovely, boys! Thank you!' Mrs. Hudson exclaims at the sight of the vase.
'It certainly is.'
'Nope. Not "ah".' John comes to him, clutches Sherlock's shoulders with both hands. 'Listen, I hate this. I
He ponders for a minute. 'Ok. Just a small cigarette.'
Ok, I FORGOT about yesterday's chapter, so sorry kasndknaska. So this is from 5th prompt, and later today I'll post the sixth prompt. Also, you guys can follow me on tumblr thanks-mike-stamford
'Someone covered for me. Brought lunch.' he answers wryly, raising the paper bag with them.
And that's how they ended up locked in a hotel room in Brighton. Granted, the room is huge. It has a large main bedroom with a queen sized bed and even a provided cot beside it, en suite equipped with a bloody jacuzzi and changing table for babies. Another adjacent smaller bedroom is connected to it by the balcony, and it has its own en suite, although the tub plus shower is quite ordinary.
He snaps at the bodyguard, and she brings the parka over, putting it over John's shoulders before cutting the tie around his wrists and maneuvering them herself into the sleeves. The parka is heavier than it should be, and a stolen glance downwards explains why: it's full of explosives.
She also smiles, but is purely subverted. 'And your transportation to work. Feel taken care of?'
'), he highlighted how now that she is close to four months, she should be able to roll from tummy to back.
What if she stopped him. Stopped all of this theatrical puzzle. Without Sherlock Holmes in the way, Moriarty would back to normality maybe? She could keep her two jobs, excellent incomes, and even pursue a family. David seemed keen in developing their baby relationship. She would be able to wait a few more years before dropping the assassin ordeal.
Sherlock is quite a physical person, he finds out. Again, the signs were all there for him to deduce it. He uses his whole body during an investigation. He observes, he touches, he smells, he even tastes when applied. Having his whole attention focused on him is overwhelming at times but also… exciting, in a way. John feels like a mold culture in a petri dish, and damned him but he finds this a bit hot.
She looks up at him with a blank face when she notices him standing over them, breathing heavily. 'What?'.
'I'm sorry. I'll try not to be so brusque next time.'
WARNING: there are some self-harm scenes that could be upsetting. All of them happen in the bathroom.
She frowns. 'Never took you for a cat person.' she says drily.
'Ah, John. Would please sit down?' he gestures to John's chair in front of him, not looking up.
'So? Can you do it?' he asks the cat.
Sherlock smiles. 'Good night, John.'
She had a ginger cat that would sit on the porch for hours watching the birds and bugs. Sometimes a moth would land on the wall, and the cat would stand under it, staring unwaveringly, making a clicking sound that seemed like a siren song, because if you blinked, the moth would be already in the cat's mouth.
This is the fourth luxury flat he finds empty. The junior minister laid a thick hand on this entrepreneurship. Corruption is always so tedious.
'You forgot about hurt. Where is it?' Anna asks looking curiously around.
'Sherlock?'
'He couldn't have taken all of that in the last five minutes.' he tells him in shock.
'Is there something else? I'm very tired.'
He idly tries to guess if Sherlock sleeps in the middle of the bed or at one side. Then he catches himself and cut the train of thought, getting up to clean himself.
He talks to the solicitor about selling their house. Sherlock is incredibly bored through everything, but stays quiet, typing fast on his phone. He understands the application is being led delicately to avoid revealing information on him and Sherlock. Magnussen isn't mentioned, but John knows Mycroft is working to keep it unrevealed during the process. The folder Sherlock showed him at the hospital, many months ago, comes in hand.
'He was. But-' he cleans his throat. 'I've never killed anyone before.' he says in a really small voice. John blinks.
'Why weren't you driving?' John said he was on a bus, but he's been driving to work everyday. He can't imagine what would have been the consequences if the drug effect had kicked in while he was behind a wheel. He could have died.
He looks back at her. 'There are some… things. That I don't have the courage to say aloud to myself. I haven't processed them yet. And I don't know anyone who could, I don't know, properly talk to.'
He looks away. She keeps watching him. Silence stretches.
'You must.' he replies a bit breathless already. John puts one knee on Sherlock's chair and slouches to him. They kiss unhurriedly, gleefully, and Sherlock can get high on it.
John frowns, perplexed. 'You what?'
Brent pulls a gun and points at them. John was going to move from behind Sherlock, but the move makes him stop. 'How do you know that?' he questions angrily.
'Nice.'
John drives very early to avoid central London's traffic at the morning rush time. He's been doing this for three days now, but still has to acclimatise to the huge urban SUV now in his possession. Living in London most of his adult life, and Afghanistan for a good chunk of years, he never really bought a car. They are expensive to acquire and to maintain, nevermind the exhausting traffic when one could just take the tube.
Three days and not a word about Sherlock. He barely slept, not with images of bullets in foreheads and skulls crashing in the pavement across his eyes every time he attempted to close them. The first night back at the suburbs he had to explain everything to Anna, cutting himself off several times to prevent calling her that name, but she didn't express much on the matter. She had been clearly happy that Magnussen was gone.
Which means, of course, that things can't stay like that.
'Can you turn back to me?'
Suddenly his phone rings. The screen shows "Mycroft", which doesn't surprise him in the least. 'Took you all the ride back.' he says as he answers. Mycroft audibly rolls his eyes, if there's such a thing. 'Already John? Honestly. Put Sherlock on.'
It only contains two files,a pdf document and a MP-4 video. He clicks to open the video.
'Now, Johnny, we are going to play a little game, aren't we? Sherlock is coming soon, so we are making a surprise for him.'
He looks around frantically. 'I'm.. having a bit of trouble defecating. Use the one upstairs.' he answers firmly.
The cat is everywhere, and it makes John increasingly unnerved. He prefers to attribute the feeling to the bombings case, especially after the old woman dies. He feels like a sitting duck, and he wants Sherlock to
"Yeah damn right"
'Toust and coffee.'
The man glances nervously at John before looking back at Sherlock. John can’t help but notice they are quite lookalike ‘Yes. I… ahn… I thought it was the right thing to do.’
Sherlock seats on a stone bench in a corner of the garden. It’s a sunny day so people walk by satisfied, unaware they were being observed. A couple feed bread to the fish in a fountain pond. The ginger man tries to touch her waist, she declines subtly by getting closer to the fish, camera app open on her phone. She’s having an affair.
She would never anticipate losing power over them by being ruled a neglectful parent by the court. Sherlock is counting on the surprise factor.
'For god's sake I wasn't going to steal some baby if that's what you think. I'm not like that!' she says indignantly. 'The idea occurred to me when you texted for Christmas. It was obvious what you wanted.'
After that there is one picture of him and Sherlock. He smiles at it. It looks like they are the ones getting married. He had stoically endured the wedding vows like something he was supposed to do. They haven't even written the thing themselves, opting for repeating the ceremony default. He barely remembers how that went. The best man's speech, though, made him tear up, a very uncommon occurrence.
‘I didn’t mean that way.’ she replies simply. ‘You are anxious that he won’t find you special anymore if he expands his horizon.’
'WASON!'
He moans to the ceiling. 'But I'm not using my nails!'. He drops to his back on the sofa, to make his point more dramatically. 'I'll just make a bit of pressure.'
song, and he can feel cold sweat beginning to form in his brow. They finally stop and Anna immediately leaves the car, quite quick for her size, already smiling to Sherlock.
'Mycroft...'
John just shakes his head. Sherlock grasps his nape, and his hand feels warm. 'Don't freak out. It's ok now.'
warn him before the wedding…’

‘Go on then, ask.’
In Serbia, he had spent days chained up to the walls. He was always standing, and if he tried to drop down his arms would be teared off. They beat him during interrogation sessions, but thankfully nothing more creative than that. Although he supposes it was a very good strategy to never let him sleep. Everytime he closed his eyes for more than a minute, they would throw a bucket of water over him. Not being let sleep or lie down for days had felt honestly worse than the beating. Oh the irony that now he's lying down, and all he wants is being able to get up and have a stretch.
John opens and closes his mouth like a fish a couple times. 'I'm... sorry. Isn't there a way-'
, and John saves the lunch plate at the last second, but not before some of it flies to his (and her) face.
John picks up the discarded towel and places it over Sherlock's shoulders. He feels himself being pushed to sit on the toilet lid. He observes in a haze John wetting a cloth and cleaning the blood of the little wound. He kisses Sherlock's forehead when he's finished. He washes and puts away the razor.
'Never watched it.' he replies between gritted teeth, noticing the driver weirdly ogled him through the rearview mirror. Anna gasps at the window.
He almost misses it, but the purple eyes suddenly glow electric blue. It lasts a second, and the cat jumps out of the hole with a
He didn't ask to recover his body, fair enough. He had asked in the middle of an existentialism discourse, and John can quote in his head to this day, "I want to be able to fly.". A quiet meow and a heartbeat later, half-man became a typical long-eared bat and flew away, just like he wanted.
John blinks at him. 'Ah… yeah. We work together.'
Furthermore, it wasn't just acting was it? He has to actively lie to someone he's been having mixed feelings - leaning on the despise side. He would have to pretend to forgive someone he definitely doesn't want to forgive, he would have to pretend to forget Anna-Greta's story, when it was embed in his brain.
John smiled softly as he stepped across the threshold of 221B, drinking in the sight of his daughter and his lover sleeping peacefully on the couch. Addison, being only six months old, was held securely against Sherlock's strong chest, her head nestled in the junction between his neck and shoulder. John had left the two of them, one screaming and the other desperately trying to calm the girl down, this morning in order to work a shift at his privately owned clinic. It was steadily growing, since the alpha had employed two other doctors to work on days he could not, but it was nice to be able to work himself and make sure everything was going smoothly. After all, Sherlock was still unable to allow many people near Addison, and had not taken a proper case since the middle of his pregnancy. John was surprised at how well behaved his omega was. He expected Sherlock to be climbing the walls by now.
Sherlock whimpered and pushed his stomach forward, enjoying the touch and feeling a flutter in response. "John, please, make me feel gorgeous again." Sherlock groaned in his ear, knowing that's exactly what John wanted and sighing when he felt those hands that had been caressing their child move to knead his arse. "Fuck me John." Sherlock nipped along the alphas ear, pushing against the war weathered hands. John moaned and nuzzled against Sherlock's neck, seeking out the scent gland.
"What can Sherrinford help with that I couldn't Doctor Watson?" A snide, smug voice commented from the doorway. Sherlock blinked slow, owlish eyes over to his brother and then shot a look to John.
He attempted to form words, but his mouth flopped uselessly. Sherlock frowned up at John and indicated a drink with his hands before making a motion he hoped displayed please to the trainee. John nodded in understanding and held a glass out wordlessly to the teenager. "Thanks." Sherlock muttered, staring at John as he checked charts and moved around Sherlock in his doctor-mode. "John?" The doctor looked up at him and smiled slightly.
"Of course we can get a flat together. I don't want you out of my sight either love. And I'd never make you go back, although you do need to attend class." John's hand petted the matted curls. Maybe it was that broken sob, or the way that Sherlock had stated his question that had broken John along with him, but it didn't matter to John. All that mattered was that the one person he loved was sobbing, broken and so utterly tired of living was lying in his arms and begging him to keep him alive. And John would kill every last person to cause the brilliant teenager pain if he knew he get away with it. "There are so many awful people in this world 'Lock. It takes strength to get through it, but I want to be here for you. Will you let me help you?"
Inside the car, John wrapped himself around Sherlock and murmured sweet nothings in his ear as Sherlock started to whimper. "Christ, why didn't you tell me?" The alpha asked as the omega doubled over when a fierce wave of cramps washed over him. "Oh, my perfect omega. It'll be alright love, we'll be there soon." John crooned.
Blue/grey eyes turned to ocean blue ones and Sherlock relaxed visibly. He looked miserable sitting in the hospital bed, but John chose not to comment as Sherlock's hand continued to grip onto his own. He heaved a sigh and looked away as his deep baritone rumbled out. "You have questions."
"Watson, how is everything? You've been in here awhile." DJ stepped into the room without looking up from a clipboard he had clenched in both his hands. John chuckled and stood up, keeping a hold of Sherlock's hand before bending over to press a brief kiss to his forehead.
Ford felt the need to hit his brother right in his smug face but refrained by tightening his hold on the plastic covered bed. "Have you not met John? He's the most loyal person I've ever met. Sherlock is so much happier around him. And what's to bet that John had not dated at all since you broke those two up? John really loves Sherlock. I see it every time I see those two together. I would venture to say that they were made for each other. John is patient, kind and understand, and Sherlock's a genius who suffers from social ineptness due to his advanced brain. Leave them be." Ford stormed out, heading towards Sherlock's room and leaving his other brother to silently contemplate the words exchanged in the small room.
--@--
"Oh Sherlock..." John muttered as he walked back in, noting the gathering blood on the bandages and the pinched expression of pain on the younger boy's face. He moved as quietly as he could to pick up Sherlock's right arm and start unwrapping the bandages, focusing all his energy on the one task. Sherlock startled and growled at the doctor before realizing who was standing at his side.
Sherlock shook his head and headed inside, glaring at the floor and refusing to look at his teacher for the duration of his lecture.
"John?" The voice was quiet, but hopeful. He seemed scared to look away from the doctor, who resembled his John so much. Pain ripped through his chest as he thought about John once more. Then the golden angel spoke and tears dripped down Sherlock's face.
John sighed and collapsed in a chair, laughing slightly. "You wouldn't really believe me if I told you I'm sure." DJ raised an eyebrow in a 'try me' expression and sat down opposite. "We met our last year in secondary school. Sherlock had skipped a year or two ahead, bloody genius, but he was picked on a lot. Mark had called him a know-it-all. Anyway, I had run across him after a particularly bad run-in with some bullies. He looked so sad and lonely just laying there, and I always hated when people were treated like freaks just because they were different. Sherlock had deduced me in an effort to get me to leave, but, God, it was bloody brilliant! He knew everything about me in the space of five seconds. And, well, that's how our friendship started. He kept me amazed honestly. The best kind of friend, but, that wasn't all he was either. He was there for me, and maybe that's why my girlfriend at the time had broken up with me, was because I was always there for him. Sherlock had nothing but cruel treatment from the other kids, his parents were kinda absent, and his brother was overbearing. His other brother was hardly around because of school. We fell in love, dated for the rest of our last year and part way through the summer until his brother cut off all communications. He's my best friend, and the only person I've ever truly fallen in love with." John smiled at his hands as he finished his story, remembering the antics Sherlock always pulled him into in secondary school.
“Sherlock, hey. Everything all right?” he asked, immediately regretting asking such a stupid question.
“Sherlock, dear, tell me what you see.”
The scene changed.
They sat on the floor together, John murmuring soothing words into Sherlock’s hair and rubbing his back as Sherlock slowly calmed down enough to heave a few shuddering breaths and look up at the man holding him.
Day 4 - The hollowness had returned. It didn’t feel right to say with a vengeance because really what it did was take away the feeling of everything else in the world. It dulled Sherlock’s senses and made him tired.
TW: Panic attacks, flashbacks, abusive relationships (past), mentions of sexual assault in the military
“What’s with the Freak?” Donovan leaned on the door of the apartment, as standoffish as ever.
John was okay with this. He knew that Sherlock needed time to adjust to the new nature of their bond. What worried him was Sherlock’s overall reticence. Though cases continued and insults flowed, the partners took only around half of their normal workload and Sherlock spent much of his time taciturn. John would sometimes walk in on him standing at the kitchen table by the microscope, staring off into space with a slack look on his face. When he saw this, John would bustle around in the kitchen making tea or getting some biscuits, trying to pull Sherlock’s attention away from whatever was troubling him.
“I… I want you to be happy. I want to please you.” The tremble in the man’s hands was quickly becoming a full-body shaking.
“Okay, Sherlock, this is going to hurt a bit.” He began to mist the cool liquid onto the open wounds. The peroxide fizzed and foamed as it hit the blood. Sherlock’s face twitched in pain, but he didn’t say anything.
After he was sure Sherlock was okay (well, what passed for okay at the moment) and breathing again, John replied. “It’s me, Sherlock. It’s John. My hair’s always been blond. Remember?” He ran his thumb along the back of Sherlock’s hand, ignoring the pain as the detective held on tightly enough for his knuckles to grind together.
John reached down and slowly removed the knife from the softening grip. Quickly, he threw it in the bin in the corner of the room. Sherlock flinched again at the sudden movement and John immediately felt guilty. He didn’t know what was happening right now but he knew better than to make quick movements around anyone as dissociated as Sherlock looked to be.
but these things hadn’t happened to him. He knew that for a fact. He hadn’t just deleted the memories. He lay limply on the couch facing the sitting room, his eyes glazed over as scenarios passed through his mind, feeling real but imaginary at the same time. It was as if the threats had actually happened, instead of staying threats. These false memories were from years ago. He didn’t see why they should still be affecting him. And anyway, they
Fact 2: Sherlock was currently crying in John’s arms.
“Lestrade called me and told me you had seemed upset at a crime scene earlier this week and then again today when he called.” John ran his fingers through the younger man’s sweat-soaked hair, clearing the tangles away from his eyes.
Sherlock’s fingers loosened and revealed a mechanical pencil. It wasn’t what the older man had expected. “What’s this?” He carefully took the pencil from his hand. The man in his arms just shuddered and cried, shrinking in on himself. John put the pencil on the floor as far away from Sherlock as possible.
Sherlock spoke vaguely as he slid carefully closer to the man beside him. “Oh, you know. For everything. The tea, being kind, putting up with me.” Sherlock made a conscious effort not to flinch as their legs touched. He reached out and took John’s cup from him, setting down on the coffee table.
Fact 5 (Updated): John loved Sherlock and would do anything he could to help him. Even if he didn’t know exactly what
“Sherlock,” he began, carefully. “You know I would never try to hurt you, right? I mean, I’d never
John paused in his steps for a moment. “What… What do you mean?”
. Starting with this.” John bent down and pressed his lips gently to Sherlock’s battered arm.
A sound came from the door. “Sherlock? Lestrade said… Oh, shit.”
“Here, darling,” said John, offering Sherlock a cup.
“Yeah, but part of what makes it fun is having both parties equally invested in the whole process. I don’t want you to force yourself to have sex with me if you don’t want to.” He tried to find the right words. “It’s… it’s sort of like when you’re on a case. You know how you were saying, just the other day, that it’s more fun for you when I’m enjoying myself too?”
“Funny. Usually he calls Sherlock,” the doctor muttered to himself. He was tired and didn’t particularly want to deal with a case at the moment. As soon as Greg started speaking, he shut himself up.
“Thanks Greg. I’m on my way home. I’ll check on him and keep you updated.” They hung up.
John started to cry. He didn’t cry easily. He was a soldier, after all. An army doctor. He’d seen terrible things. And not just battle injuries and the occasional illness, either. There was a serious problem with sexual assault in the military. He’d seen it, treated it, in too many young men and women, in his unit and others. It was almost worse than losing a patient. It
Lestrade didn’t know what could be affecting Sherlock Holmes this way. What he did know was that the man was
trousers. They were tented up by… Sherlock didn’t want to think of why they were like that.
“Fuck. Fuck,” he slurred. He felt nauseous. He just sat there staring at it, still heavily dissociated, not really knowing what to do.
“Well, it’s like that, but more. I only want it if you want it too.”
Day 5 - Today. He knew that he’d had nightmares the night before. He didn’t remember anything, but he remembered waking up scared several times during the night, and when he finally did wake for good, he felt anxiety creeping into his chest.
Their relationship hadn’t changed all that much. John still chased Sherlock around as he solved crimes. Sherlock still routinely demanded unreasonable tasks from John like fetching his mobile from the next room. Really, the only difference was the occasional gentle touch between the two flatmates: the soft brush of fingers on a shoulder, a tender kiss on the way to bed, a careful grasp of a hand as they sat on the sofa after a chase.
“All right. First, tell me five things you can see. Can you do that for me?”
“Everyone has their moments. Even you, Sherlock Holmes.” The doctor laughed weakly. “You’re just as human as the rest of us, even if you like to pretend otherwise.”
“Oh, you know,” he said, waving his hand vaguely and sliding a bit closer to John. “For everything. The tea, being kind, putting up with me.”
Sherlock pulled back briefly, slipped his arms from his dressing gown, and pulled his shirt over his head before going back to kissing.
John was only able to hide his sudden worry because of his military training. “What do you mean, darling?”
Suddenly, John saw the problem. This was very much a
“Hey, hey, Sherlock, it’s okay. Slow breaths. I’m here, love,” John repeated over and over, rubbing small, comforting circles on Sherlock’s back, holding him closely, but not tightly.
Sherlock chuckled weakly. “I thought I’d hid it well enough to fool him.” He paused for a moment, thinking. “You… you called me dear. And love.”
He put down the kettle and retreated to the sofa, not wanting to upset John further. He thought about what he should do to improve the situation. He knew that any time now, John would finally get fed up with Sherlock’s complaining and put him back in his place. There were ways that could be prevented. He didn’t want to do it, not like this, but if it would prevent John from getting angry with him then there was nothing for it.
Sherlock watched John leave the room with a small wave back and then turned his attention to his oldest brother. "Long time no see little brother." Ford chuckled, ruffling Sherlock's matted curls.
John stared at him before grinning. "That's amazing! What can you tell about me?" Sherlock stared at the ground, frowning. Nothing good came out of someone challenging him. They always made fun of him, or got pissed off. "Please? I wanna see it!" John placed a warm hand on Sherlock's shoulder, snapping the omega out of his mind palace.
"Yea, I'm not sure why. He said it was to protect me...like you were gunna break my heart. I think it hurt worse that I couldn't explain the situation and thought I'd never see you again." Sherlock swallowed and looked away as John studied the wounds that came so close to killing him. Eighteen hours ago, the seventeen-year-old wouldn't have minded slipping into the black void, but now that John was back, he couldn't imagine why he'd been so stupid.
"Hey, Holmes!" Sherlock ducked his head and increased his pace across the grounds, hoping to avoid the twenty-one year old student running up behind him. "Hey, I was talking to you." Victor Trevor breathed down Sherlock's ear, making the boy flinch and shiver. The brown-haired boy just grinned in response and grabbed his arse, making Sherlock yelp in shock. "How about we go back to my dorm room. Got a fresh batch of the good stuff."
--@--
"That was my main tormentor who has been trying to get in my pants since last year. His favourite thing to do, however, is force me to give him blowjobs. Which is why I rarely go near him. Disgusting human being." Sherlock snarled, glaring at the door where Victor had stopped.
They both wore slightly goofy smiles as they stared at one another, phone forgotten between them. That is...until they hear a quiet moan and glance at the phone in surprise, huffing a laugh as they realized that their little show woke up Lestrade. His libido only increased with his pregnancy, and hearing his friend's go at it must have woken it up. "I'll send a car in the morning." Mycroft panted, whimpering. John winked at Sherlock as his brother rang off. "You are brilliant, my love."
Sherlock watched his alpha wearily, kissing Addy's cheek when the girl started to squirm. John was still breathing heavily, his cheeks flushed an angry red and fist clenched unhappily together. Sherlock wanted to reach out and smooth those hands out, rub those shoulders until they let go of their tension and make John's flush turn from angry into passionate but there wasn't any time. His father was downstairs and their daughter was staring up at the both of them, quiet and curious as the two collectively got their breaths together. "I'll go start the packing." John's voice was rough, angry clear in everything line of his body as he headed for their bedroom. "Ma?" Addy looked up, eyes turning wet with tears as if she thought that her da might be leaving. Sherlock wasn't sure, but that might be just what his little genius was thinking. He leaned down and tickled the girl, causing her to squeal happily. "It's okay baby girl. Da just went to get ready for our trip. We're going to see my parents. Grandmother is alright but Grandfather is a grouch. He's not very nice." Sherlock murmured to her, rocking her quietly against him. He felt John smiling at him and glanced up in time to see the man turn towards the stairs leading to their daughter's bedroom.
John just smiled gently and scratched Sherlock's back. "Of course I will. I can't have my favorite person getting hurt." Though it was a supposed to be a teasing statement, the words left both teenagers feeling somber. Sherlock curled up once again, off to the side to avoid hurting John, and sighed. "C'mere." John wrapped his arms around the thin waist again and hauled Sherlock to his side, kissing the corner of the boy's mouth and nuzzling his cheek affectionately.
hateful. I’m worthless. What am I without my mind? I- I- I—” His breath started coming a bit faster.
“No, dear, they’re proof that you were brave and strong enough to come to me, even if it took a little while.” With one more kiss, the doctor in him couldn’t help asking, “Would you let me put some arnica on those bruises? They look painful.” Sherlock nodded and John went over to his bureau where he kept the first aid kit.
Sherlock’s mind raced, his breath coming quicker and heavier. The pain was making him light headed, even though there was almost no blood. His mind started to pull him back into the past, into memories and ‘what if?’ scenarios. The world around him faded, but the lithe, pale hands continued their work.
“Yes, but I…”
The day had been a complicated one. Sherlock was irritable in the morning, snapping at John more than usual, and refusing to eat the toast John had made for him. He had been silent since John had gotten home that evening, and had gone to bed early for the third day in a row. Coming from the man who would often go days without sleep, this was unusual.
Sherlock nodded.
He knew he shouldn’t be doing this. What would John say if he found out? The day after John had found him sitting on the edge of his bed, knife in hand, the doctor had made Sherlock promise to come to him if he felt the need to cut. Sherlock had promised, but privately he didn’t think he could do it. He trusted John, but he was ashamed. Ashamed of this weakness, this vice, that had once again taken over his life.
God, he wished John were here. He knew the ex-army doctor would calm him, even if Sherlock didn’t show any discomfort. John’s presence was a force of calm and neutrality in Sherlock’s dizzying mind.
“Good, that’s one. Four more.”
“Just a couple,” he told himself. He lowered the tiny tip of graphite until it touched the soft skin, pressed down, and dragged it slowly across the fragile, wet flesh. It didn’t really do anything. He hadn’t really expected it to with that little of an effort. He placed it down again, pressed harder, and ripped. This time, skin broke. Not much, just enough for a little blood to seep out. Not even enough to bead. This was repeated several more times before Sherlock got out of the now cold bath.
The detective shook his head but raised his eyes, briefly meeting John’s gaze before glancing away again.
After about a minute of this, Sherlock spoke.
“That’s right. Look around. This is your bedroom at 221b Baker Street. You’re safe here.” John moved to pick up Sherlock’s hand and placed it on his own chest. “Breathe, Sherlock. You’re safe. Feel my breath? Breathe along with it.” The doctor breathed slowly and deeply and Sherlock responded, slowing from hyperventilation to still quick but deeper gasps.
“Sherlock, do you really want this?”
“I…” Sherlock took a long, deep, only slightly shuddering breath. “Yes. I think so.”
Why now?
“You don’t have to tell me about it. I know what it feels like. To have a flashback.”
John was appalled, but thoughtful. Carefully, he asked “Sherlock, what made you fall into that flashback after you had begun to calm down?”
The older man tried to keep an eye out for any signs of fresh injuries but had so far come up empty. He hoped this was a good thing and not just a failure of his lacking observational skills.
Sherlock burrowed deeper into John’s chest with a hum of satisfaction and contentment.
Out loud he said “Do you want to talk about it, love?” John had never called Sherlock ‘love’ before, heck, he had never used any term of endearment for him aside from ‘idiot,’ but considering the circumstances, he felt it was necessary. Besides. He was Sherlock Holmes. He knew how John felt about him.
And now, here he was, with someone who hadn’t been physically assaulted but was just as broken as the men and women for whom he had run rape kits, crying while drawing a complete blank on how to help. At least as a doctor he’d had prescribed duties for such situations.
Sherlock had so far managed to limit himself to bruising his arms and occasionally punching a wall. He hadn’t totally broken his promise. He hadn’t cut. The lies wrapped in technicalities were always covered by his long sleeved dress shirts and flowing dressing gowns. He knew John hadn’t seen them. He knew too, that John worried.
John tried to pull back, surprised, but Sherlock brought his hand up to the back of his head, twining his fingers in John’s greying blond hair and deepening the kiss, gently biting the doctor’s lower lip. John couldn’t help it. He moaned quietly, kissing back.
“I’m sorry,” gasped Sherlock. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…” Those words continued to spill out of his mouth in ever more rapid succession. John tried his best to keep Sherlock from falling deeper into panic, but he didn’t know what to do. His own panic attacks and flashbacks were so different from this. Touch usually grounded him, but he didn’t think Sherlock would appreciate a hug at the moment.
“Sentiment, love. Bloody sentiment, what else?” John kissed another bruise.
long time. Honestly, this case hadn’t been as bad as some.
Well that was unexpected. Sherlock’s vision blurred again and his hearing seemed to warp. “Of— of course I do.” He inhaled sharply, trying to get things back into focus. His breathing didn’t want to cooperate, insisting on remaining fast and shallow.
Knowing he had to keep things interesting or reap the consequences, he pulled Kai into his lap and reached around to clasp the man’s arse. Better for Kai to be in the dominant position. Almost immediately, he felt hips grinding into him and a very hard object pressing towards his stomach. Fingers were teasing at the hem of his sleep shirt. God, he didn’t want to do that… But needs must when the devil drives. He leaned back and took off his dressing gown and shirt with trembling hands before going back to kissing.
Carefully, John got up from the floor and moved to sit next to his partner again, not letting go of his hand. “I know that’s what you expect, even if rationally you know that’s not what relationships are supposed to be. There’s only so much our rational minds can control. Even a mind as brilliant as yours. We’re conditioned by our experiences to expect what is familiar to us, regardless of actuality.”
Sherlock kissed him, trying to be as passionate as possible. The dark haired man moaned into the kisses, opening his mouth to grant Sherlock’s tongue entrance. He smelled like a farm. Dust, and cut grass, and horses. For some reason, that made the now-shorter man’s heart start pounding even harder.
Lestrade watched, surprised, as Sherlock quickly stalked from the room. It wasn’t unlike the idiot genius to forget that he needed to elaborate sometimes, but it was unusual for him to just leave without at least a bit of showing off.
he thought.
Sherlock was in bed. It seemed to be where he spent most of his time nowadays. Bed was safe. His duvet and pillows muffled his tossing and turning and the walls silenced his quiet sounds of fear and anxiety and pain. In bed he could ride out the near constant imagined sounds and images that plagued his waking hours and the terrors that haunted his dreams. A day rarely went by when he didn’t see or hear something that wasn’t there at least once, and a full night’s sleep was a thing of the past.
“Don’t just say that, Sherlock. Be truthful with me.”
TW: Mentions of self-harm, Flashbacks, Panic
John was laying in bed pondering this late one night after returning home from the surgery to find Sherlock sitting on the couch staring off into space.
Fact 1: Sherlock had come to his room late at night.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock closed his eyes and John tapped his partner’s knee. “Nuh-uh, Sherlock. Keep those eyes open. Gotta stay in the real world, right? Good. Now, three things you can feel?”
John studied Sherlock’s face carefully. For the first time, he noticed the pallor of the man’s skin; the sheen of sweat on his face, the rapid but shallow breathing, the well disguised but not completely hidden fear in the blue-grey eyes, the trembling hands.
“Care for a cup of tea, love?” He stood and stretched a hand out to Sherlock.
“Be quiet, for once, would you?” The taller man leaned in slowly, curly hair hanging into his eyes, and gently kissed John on the mouth.
“Come on, darling. Really look. Can you tell me what you see?”
“What I was saying earlier… I knew it was you but a significant part of me thought you were someone else.” He hissed as John cleaned the largest cut with peroxide. “It was… a long time ago. It’s stupid that I even still remember it, but I can never seem to delete it.” He paused, and John stayed silent, waiting for him to continue.
Eyes open again, Sherlock continued.
“Yeah, Sherlock?”
Sherlock hadn’t wanted their first sexual encounter to go like this. But, he supposed, he shouldn’t have expected anything different. In a relationship, Sherlock’s purpose was to keep the other person happy and assuage any anger that might be directed at him before things got out of hand.
To that end, the detective made sure he got to the kitchen first and headed over to the stove to put the kettle on.
TW: Flashbacks, Self-harm, Dissociation, Emotional abuse and manipulation, Sexual Assault/Rape
Sherlock blinked several times. John. This was John, not Kai. He was in their flat at 221b and the smells that surrounded him were those of the city and old furniture, not country living and livestock. Though this should have reassured him, Sherlock shook even harder and began to hyperventilate in earnest.
He took a breath, stood, and headed home.
“I… I’m sorry…” His words were still slurred and halting, but they were understandable. “I didn’t mean for you to see me like this. You… you’re early.”
John was worried that his friend was going to start panicking, so he rested his hands on the other man’s, twining their fingers together and speaking calmly. “Dear, look at me, all right?”
TW: Fallout from past abuse/unhealthy thought processes created by past abuse
“To be honest,” he thought “this sort of thing doesn’t usually affect me like this. Why is it now?”
The detective looked down, ashamed. “But that’s not who I am. I’m logical, rational. A machine, remember?” Despite the harsh words, his muscles had begun to relax.
Realizing his possible mistake, John quickly interrupted. “You don’t need to feel like you have to return my feelings. I was just trying to comfort you, and it sort of slipped out.”
“I’m never letting you go.”
The ex-soldier recognized the glazed look in his friend’s face as his eyes saw things that weren’t there. He’d had no idea that this was PTSD related, assuming it was just a depressive episode. He didn’t even want to imagine what could reduce the normally totally self-assured detective to this.
“Please, don’t. Don’t do that. Don’t make me please…” It looked to John that the tall gangly man was trying to simultaneously collapse in on himself and push something, or someone, away from him. Suddenly, the detective let out a pained and plainly horrified sob. “Stop! Stop… Please stop…”
“Yes. Background?” Sherlock didn’t see why this was pertinent.
“Right! So!” Sherlock smiled and clapped his hands together in the way which meant he was ready to get started. He liked this part. The shocked looks on the faces of those around him were amusing.
worse, when they occasionally decided that it wasn’t worth it to keep going anymore. Sometimes they got themselves shot on purpose. Sometimes it was more direct. It didn’t happen often, but the few times it did were the few times John had cried while in Afghanistan.
That made Sherlock blush. After about five minutes of silence, he came to a decision. “John?”
12 days. 12 days, 4 hours, and 37 minutes. That is how long John Watson had been away. Of course, Sherlock knew it down to the second, but he had observed that that level of precision was usually superfluous to ordinary people. Only 5 hours until John would return. Under normal circumstances, the world’s only Consulting Detective wouldn’t be particularly troubled by the extended absence of his flatmate. He might not even notice that he had gone for several days. These, however, were not normal circumstances.
TW: Self-harm
“Bloody hell.”
“It’s okay for you to have feelings you know, Sherlock.”
TW: Mentions of self-harm, rape, abuse
Heyyyyyy, sooooooo, apparently I needed this again. It's been a rough few weeks. Gotta love C-PTSD, right? Maybe I'll actually try to finish it. Who knows.
“Terrific, Sherlock. Last one.” John slowly lifted a piece of biscuit to Sherlock’s lips. “One thing you can taste.”
Sherlock glanced at John, a slight smile on his well shaped mouth. “There you go, revealing my secret.”
A couple hours later, pencil met skin again, more violently this time, quickly bringing beads of blood to the surface. Sherlock bit his lip and breathed hard, enjoying the sensation. This was what he needed to keep the hollowness at bay. Twenty minutes and thirty scratches later, the detective went into the bathroom again and cleaned and bandaged the scrapes. No sense in them getting infected. It’s a good thing he only wore long sleeved shirts.
Sherlock nodded, so John helped him up and supported him as they made their way to the bed.
Sherlock, of course, insisted nothing was wrong. He became fairly hostile whenever John brought it up. It was beginning to get to him. The doctor knew from his own experience that such an intense PTSD flare could have repercussions lasting a couple weeks, but it was already well past John’s estimate for recovery and not much had changed.
“The violin case. Y-you.” His breath hitched on the last word, breaking John’s heart just a little more.
he thought.
“Yes dear? Could you repeat that?”
Day 3 - It had been a long time since he’d had the urge to cut, and yet…
John’s breath was heavy and ragged. Was it John? It had been a minute ago. Something about that breathing… Sherlock opened his eyes and saw a long, thin face, framed by lank dark brown hair. His heart raced. He had to keep him happy. This would be so much worse for him if he didn’t. Kai had told him as much the last time they talked.
“The thing is though, John,” Sherlock breathed in deeply, “I have feelings for you, too. I
“What for, darling?”
At 12:17 he stood up quickly and walked to his bedroom. He needed to purge the emptiness. It had worked yesterday. Maybe a bit more would ward it off for longer. He opened a small drawer in his bureau. Reaching in, his fingers found what they needed: it was an exacto-knife, the kind used for crafts and such. It had a sharp triangular blade and a silver handle that felt cold in Sherlock’s grip. He had almost forgotten it was there.
Finally, wounds cleaned and bandaged under a clean layer of gauze, John looked up into Sherlock’s face, searching for something, anything, which could explain this. As far as he knew, this had never happened before. Then again, as far as he knew, it could happen every week.
“I… I knew it was you, but another part of me thought it was someo…” He stopped mid sentence.
After about an hour of this he picked up the pencil in his right hand and shakily held it above his left forearm.
The taller man didn’t say anything, continuing to stare at the ground.
“God, Sherlock…” John went back to his friend and sat down next to him on the bed, looking at the bleeding cuts on this leg. “What happened?”
Sherlock’s vision started to blur. He had to hold on, had to keep going, if he wanted to be safe. This would happen regardless, better that it was on his terms. “Don’t fight it. Let me thank you,” he spoke against his partner’s lips.
He was right. John did want to know.
“Kiss me?”
John nodded. “Yeah, that’s right.” Suddenly, he had a spark of inspiration. “I’m going to try a grounding technique I read about once in medical school, okay? But I need you to listen to me and try to breathe while we do.”
“Yes, John?”
speech. He began trying to get his partner’s breathing under control again.
The DI tried to empty his mind and reassured himself that all would be taken care of. The man had been caught and would, with any luck, be put away for a
“But you’re still upset.” A statement, not a question.
“Yeah, that’s right. I’m here. Just plain old John Watson, okay?” He tried to reassure the detective, who nodded, uncertainly. “Okay. Now tell me four things you can hear.”
Sherlock just shook his head silently and jerkily.
Fact 4: Sherlock hadn’t been acting normal (or what passed for it in Sherlock Holmes) since.
John looked confused. “What for?” he asked. Shit. Sherlock had hoped that the thanks, still an unusual occurrence with him, would mollify John enough not to need the rest of the plan. Guess not.
At this point, Sherlock stopped listening. Two days? That was too long for there to still be any fresh blood…
He slowly got up and went to the desk. He had all sorts of sharp objects there, none of which he really wanted to use. He didn’t actually know what he wanted. Just something to distract him. Something to make him
He continued. “He convinced me that it was my fault whenever he did anything to himself, and he made me feel guilty whenever I tried to go to him for emotional support by blaming himself, always turning the conversation to his problems, or wants, or needs.” Sherlock, the unfeeling detective, was silently weeping into John’s denim lap. In the next thirty minutes, he told John everything. From the smallest jabs to the threats and abuse, and how the crime scene made him imagine all the things that could have happened.
John stared at the phantom as his critical eyes seemed to look straight through him. John lightly sang a quizzical note.
"Turn your face away from the garish light of day," he whispered closely, then used the tips of his fingers under John's chin to guide him to look at the taller man again slowly. "Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light."
Not bothered by the lack of reply, he pressed his lips to Sherlock's cheekbone as he passed by his chair, straining his shoulder accidentally. Not wanting him to take any notice, John kept quiet, only offering a gentle rub to the scarred skin as he so often did. John sat on the sofa and read the paper, taking light sips of his cuppa. Unfortunately, his shoulder gave a burst of uncontrollable spasms, making him drop the cup, sending it shattering to the floor.
The pianist started to play, and John hesitated, looking around to his friends who nudged him on. Mike nodded and handed him the scarf, as John softly began to sing. He had been taught by someone, but he couldn’t remember who; he just knew the lyrics and exactly how to sing it. He was quiet at first and heard his friends and the new owners start to loose faith in him, but he continued, with more confidence, and then saw pleasing smiles, and knew he had the role.
“Oh please, madam, who is the understudy for the role?” he dismissed, looking to the director.
Sherlock sighed and clenched his thighs tighter around John's waist to keep him still. Ignoring the "Oi, you're not as light as you look, you know,"
"Cream, it's supposed to help. Got it while you were asleep." Sherlock announced before he began to dab it on the scar, and rub the cream in slow circles with his thumb.
“My father, sir.”
“Watson.. that’s a peculiar name. Any relation to the violinist?” Monsieur Lestrade asked anyway, taking John’s hand.
In that moment, John felt much better.
Sherlock's face softened. "I'm sorry." He said before he pressed a soft apologetic kiss to the thigh. He stared at his leg for a few moments before speaking again, looking up at John. "Everything you are feeling is in here." Sherlock pressed a finger gently to the center of John's forehead. John rolled his eyes and sighed.
"Sing for me!" He ordered once more, drawing an arm out into the open, John facing out and singing almost involuntarily, a much higher note than he ever had achieved before- his voice echoing off the walls of the dark sanctuary. He ended with a desperate gasp for air, holding his throat, amazed in himself.
"You have come here for one purpose and one alone, since the moment I first heard you sing, I have needed you with me, to serve me, to sing for my music." John frowned in confusion, and the Phantom stepped down, closer to John.
"It comes and goes sometimes, you know it gets worse in the rain." John reassured running a hand through soft curls and down to trace the nape of his neck, down to his back.
John promptly fainted in his arms.
“Lot 663 then, a poster from this house’s production of Hannibal by Chalumeau. Let us start with five francs.” The auctioneer announced, briefly nodding to a man in the front with his card risen. The two men bid up to 8 francs. The crowd was silent in the small abandoned Paris opera house, only the booming voice of the auctioneer could break through the tension still present even after so many years.
“Item 665, a musical box in the shape of an organ, attached the figure of a monkey in Persian robes, playing the cymbals. This item discovered in the vaults of the theatre, still in working order.” The displayer held up the box, winding it and letting it play for a short while, and Mary relished the sound of the small tune as it quieted and the cymbals echoed in a quiet ping.
"I thought I was the doctor here." John chuckled and pressed a kiss to the curls as Sherlock wrapped his arms protectively around John's torso.
“Our fondest memories of listening to your father play the violin by the fire.” She smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder.
John’s smile dissipated. “I can’t,” he insisted, “the angel is very strict!”
“There is no understudy,This production is new!” he answered, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief.
"You have a fever." he notes with s frown. Sherlock guided him into their bedroom and under the sheets before crawling in next to him. "Sleep." He ordered, then leaned over to press his lips delicately to the offending scar. He lay his head down on the uninjured side of John's chest, knowing it was the only way to get him to sleep.
“Everyone, Ladies and Gentlemen!” The director bellowed, quieting the large group. Mike eagerly pulled John to the front, almost tripping over his costume. Two wealthy men that they hadn’t seen before approached them.
"Mm. Feels nice." John sighed and relaxed at the icy feeling the cream left on his skin. "How long was I asleep?" He mumbled, looking for the time.
Late 18th century
Mary couldn’t hear the amount clearly but raised her number to the voice of the auctioneer, glancing aside to see another speak out, a voice she remembered quite clearly. Madame Hudson bid a higher number. Mary finalized the bid with 30 francs and looked back at Madam Hudson, who shook her head quietly and looked down sadly through her dark veil over her eyes.
“Flattering child, you shall know me, see why in shadows I hide. Look into your mirror, I am there.” John spun around to face his long mirror, staring into his own reflection. For a moment, there was nothing, but then there was a face, appearing in front of him, staring back. John could barely let a word out before the mirror opened to reveal the man behind it, offering a hand to him. He was tall, was the first thing he noticed, the half of his face covered by a white mask. The man’s hair was slicked back, His skin was pale enough that it had little contrast with the mask, and he was incredibly slender under the long cape he wore.
After John sufficiently cleaned up the glass, he locked himself in the bathroom. Pulling off the thin cotton T-shirt he wore to bed, he leaned in closer to the mirror to inspect the scar. It was obvious where the bullet had hit him, a pale little crevice surrounded by a starburst of torn skin from the impact. The scar was a bit red, but otherwise looked normal, if not a bit irritated. He put a hot pack on it for a little while, hidden from Sherlock's gaze in their bedroom. After taking some aspirin, John decided he felt better.
"John!" Sherlock called, at his side at an instant and pulling him up to stand on his good leg.
“8 once,” he paused, “selling twice,” he paused again. “sold,” he said, with a hit of the gavel against the wood, “to Mary Watson, thank you, very much.” he said, nodding to the woman sitting in a wheelchair. She nodded to him, looking down as people behind her clapped quietly. They quickly flew through the next object, a simple prop from another opera. The now elder woman looked up at the sound of soft music.
"Night is much better for music, John, it heightens your senses and emotion." He said passionately, stepping closer and taking John's hand with glee. John looked toward him and tried to look closer under the mask, but was stopped by a hand darting out to grip his, keeping John a careful distance away. John looked away with a small huff of embarrassment.
"Sherlock, I'm alright I-"
John and Mike had started to whisper in the back about the performance schedules and dulled out Donovan’s voice. Halfway through her song, however, the backdrop fell from backstage, and a light fell right next to where she was standing. The background dancers screamed, some fleeing the stage. “it’s him!” Mike said, shoving John, “the Phantom of the Opera!”
"You shouldn't have to try to hide it from me." Sherlock replied, staring up at him. John was about to reply but Sherlock let out an "oh!" and hopped off the bed, out of their bedroom in a second, leaving John alone. "Well, then." John shifted and huffed when Sherlock came back a minute later, holding a small tube of something and squeezing a good amount of it on his hand. He carefully climbed over John to sit over his stomach, ignoring his protests.
"Shit, sorry." John apologized and lowered the newspaper. This, was out of the ordinary, Sherlock noticed. He glanced over the top of his phone.
"W-what is that?" John asked, veering away from the cream after a huff of lost breath as the heavy detective constricted his lungs.
No words were spoken during the ride, and john refused to look at Sherlock, settling for looking out at a sopping London. When the cab stopped, John didn't have enough time to look before Sherlock pulled on him, but a more delicate grip this time. He looked at the ground as Sherlock helped him walk up to the flat, fumbling around with his key before lifting John a bit so he could step into the flat.
"So, John...I'm having a party at my house Saturday. You should come. It's for my birthday." Mary winked at him and smiled broadly. Sherlock felt a shiver of hate coarse through him at the implication Mary was giving. Omegas reached their first heat shortly after they turned fourteen. Usually they'd have to take an entire week off of school for their first heat to run it's course. Some were a little bit more open to sharing heats with alphas. In fact, most omegas invited an alpha to their bed after the first heat, which was why the general beta population thought that omegas were sluts. Sherlock found it distasteful. Why would he invite alphas to his bed for his heat? All he needed was one alpha anyway, and that alpha was frowning in thought beside him as Sarah whispered something in Mary's ear.
John was only slightly surprised his superiors never said anything to him. They had to know he was sleeping next to one of his patients every night, that's what the cameras were for after all. Of course, none of the other staff noticed how different the young doctor acted around the young Holmes. The one that particularly got on Sherlock's nerves was a nurse that happened to be on the same floor every time John went to check on Sherlock (which was often.) With Sherlock's withdrawals and the increasing nightmares when John isn't there, it was hard to leave the younger boy's side. But he didn't deem it necessary for a nurse to trail after him either. Nevertheless, Mary continued to follow John like a lost puppy and Sherlock wanted nothing more then to be able to kiss John in front of the nurse just so she didn't get the idea that she had any chance.
"Lay with me? Please?" He wouldn't look John in the eyes as he shifted restlessly in his hospital bed. There was a sheepishness to his look that hadn't been there a year ago when they had shared a cot during a camping trip.
"John." Sherlock moaned, pouting at his mate.
Sherlock awoke to voice speaking quietly. The body next to him was warm, solid and comforting and, for a moment, Sherlock tried to delve back into his dreamland. But the sterile smell and the beeping of a heart monitor kept his mind from shutting down and he groaned as he opened his eyes. His wrist were throbbing and his veins felt strangely empty. Detoxing was beginning, it had been a few days since his last hit. A hand was trailing along his back in soothing motions and Sherlock felt his tense muscles relax again.

The alpha situated this daughter in the middle of the bed, kissing her forehead lovingly and covering her tiny body with the blanket before he went to stand before his mate. He rough but somehow soft hands came up to cup Sherlock's face tenderly. The omega leaned into the support gratefully, long arms coming up to wrap around his mate's waist. "I love you Sherlock Watson-Holmes." John murmured, leaning down to kiss his mate. "And I, you, John Watson-Holmes."
"John." It was a breathy sigh, almost as if Sherlock hadn't woken at all, but John knew better. He smiled down at his love and curled closer, encasing the younger boy in two strong arms and peppering kisses across his forehead. He felt Sherlock smile beneath him and switched to running a hand through the ratty and greasy hair.
Sherlock turned his gaze to Sarah and noticed that she was attracted to alphas and omegas, though detested the beta population. She was especially interested in having sexual intercourse with one John Watson, Mr. Popular. Sherlock also noticed how she slipped her hand casually behind Mary. Sarah was fingering the omega as they stood in front of their object of affection. It was then Sherlock realized Mary wanted to share them during her heat, and Sarah hoped to have John to herself at one point during the night. He mashed his teeth together and turned to watch John.
The younger teen flushed and buried his face back in John's neck, mumbling something like "stay," before drifting off to sleep. John smiled down at his love and agreed, arms circling the thin waist and head dropping to rest on top of Sherlock's as he fell into a deep sleep.
"Always."
Mary smiled easily once again and smirked at John, who just stared back and shrugged. "Hey, Lock, I'll be right back okay?" The young doctor commented, squeezing Sherlock's hand from where it shot out to clasp John's rough one. Sherlock just stared back at him, broken and scared, but not willing to show that in front of the nurse, who was watching him with contempt. "I'll hurry, promise." Sherlock nodded and let go, picking at the linens and counting the minutes.
"He's more then that. He's my best friend, and probably the only person to ever truly understand me. He's brilliant, mad, amazing and talented. I love him, and I finally have the chance to be around him once again." John whistled, politely asked the nurses in the lab to run the blood and hurried up the stairs and back to Sherlock, leaving Mary to stare at him as if he's grown another head.
