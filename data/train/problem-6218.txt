“My mother has a way of knowing things, but there’s also the fact that Loki and my dad were in the middle of talking with a bunch of people, Clint was with his fiancé... and the fact that he only drives a motorcycle, so he had gone to the party with my parents.”
They wouldn’t know for certain, since the freshmen were at orientation at the moment, so Steve helped Bucky unload his stuff, placing it outside the car as Bucky grabbed a trolley from the desk. They didn’t say anything until they walked into the room and saw one side of the room filled with some very expensive stuff, and a bunch of Captain America posters on the wall.
When morning came, and Tony could only feel Steve behind him on the bed all he could realizes was that this was it, either they fixed everything, or they lost for good. He wanted this moment for himself just for a moment, because somewhere out there, there was a universe where they weren’t together. Just the thought of losing that, losing what he had was enough to make him turn around burrow himself further into Steve embrace.
Steve ignored them and walked away, heading towards the registers to open them up for the day, when he saw Clint standing outside. Honestly, he couldn’t understand why the man didn’t have a job, but since Natasha was letting him in Steve knew that they were all going to gang up on him. He could hear them talking but choose to ignore them because he knew that they were going to bring the topic up over and over again until he caved and got them to help him.
“I have a story I want to read to you,” Tony said smiling. “It’s still a work in progress so no one’s read it, and so I hope you like it.”
Tony’s brown eyes looked at him with surprise, they both knew the meaning of the dog tags for soldiers, but for Steve they meant coming home to the one person who challenges him, who forces him to look at the world differently, who doesn’t treat him with kid gloves. Not caring that they had a group of witnesses behind him, wanting to not waste his chances any more than he already has, he leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on the other man’s lips. He didn’t want any more regrets, not when there was the possibility that they might not make it back. He could feel it as Tony hummed against him before he felt the man’s hand reach up and touch his face.
The group convened around the table, as food was handed out but no one said a thing about what they had been discussing, Steve and Tony shared a look with one another about the whole situation, but they didn’t know how to bring it up until Thor opened a bottle of liquor in front of them.
“Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each for only a handful of us,” Bruce said bringing forth their other problem. “And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.”
“It’s fancy seeing you here too,” he said smiling at Steve, he couldn’t figure out why he felt shy all of a sudden. “I’m having lunch with my sister and my friend, but they don’t know how to order coffee so I need more and as strong as you can make it,” he told Steve sounding almost desperate. Although their relationship with had gotten a little better since they started talking it was never about anything important, or answering the questions that they had asked one another.
“You don’t know that.”
I actually rewrote a good chunk of the movie into this, why? Because I'm mad with power, plus it was an interesting thing to do, to make it a real Steve/Tony event.
“Come on, that's your favorite story,” he said smiling at her. “I love you tons.”
“We bake cookies and send it to them I guess,” Steve said smiling at his husband.
They were quiet as they drove towards the facility, Natasha, Bruce, Scott, Hope, as well as Vision and Shuri, were standing there, none of them looked like they had slept at all. Tony sighed as he got out of the car, leaving all of the windows down so the air would circulate while the kids slept. Steve followed him, hugging everyone as he got to them.
“Uhh, magic wand?” Natasha said while holding onto Loki’s scepter. The thing that started it all, these two stones had caused them so much grief in such a short amount of time.
“Among other things,” she said to him, those other things she probably wouldn’t discuss with Tony around because as much as she loved her brother, she needed to have her own secrets.
“Just close friends, and his kid’s friends, hence Bucky is the Winter Soldier, and my brothers all have characters in the story.”
“Processing...” she answered as she worked on the model.
When they pull up to the Hospital, “I live near here, I wonder if Thor would want to meet my parents today too,” Bruce says as Tony starts to get out.
Just as Clint took off, he was followed by Bruce who didn’t say another word, the man was racked with guilt over what had happened in the lab earlier. Nebula followed, them after giving Steve a knowing look, he already knew what she would do to him if he ended up hurting Tony. Leaving behind Ms. Potts, Rhodey, and Natasha, all who were very protective of Tony, even when Steve saw Nat as one of her closest friends, she still berated him and teased over the years over how him and Tony were around one another.
“It wasn’t that funny,” Steve said a fond smile on his face.
He was hungover drunk if that was even a phrase, he knew this for sure, he knew that he shouldn’t have grabbed that bottle of whatever the hell that had been.... Jack maybe, who knows, but he was drunk, and he had coded his final project drunk. The whole weekend had been a weird blur, but his professor was standing in front of him, amazed at Tony’s creation, but Tony knew that it was flawed in so many ways. He wouldn’t change anything about the bot, because he valued the machine like it was his own child, just like little Butterfingers, but this one was so dumb, and he hoped that the learning aspect of its coding would help fix that over time.
When they arrived, NAF looked like another world, Tony helped with the upkeep, but he never came back to the facility, it felt like the place where his greatest wishes and his greatest fears had come to life. It was like coming home after being away for a long time, but the grounds were barely upkept, and the darkness of the early morning made it feel like it was another world altogether.
It was the next day when he remembered something that Steve had said before he had run off that morning, Tony had gone to class and then off to the robotics lab to finish his bot so that he could submit it as his final project for one of his classes utterly forgetting that Steve had told him several things. Just seeing Bucky come home to get ready for the party was enough to remind Tony that he needed to talk to Steve in person about the future of their relationship.
“Excuse me?” Scott said looking over at the Norse God.
“You know,” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear, “I wasn’t sure of it before, but I’m almost certain that Nebula, Valkyrie, Bruce and Thor are in a relationship with one another.”
“You’re new here?” Tony heard the woman ask Steve.
There was something about walking over the rubble of something you built that made this whole thing a little too real. Tony had all but crawled out of Afghanistan fifteen years before, he was a different man, he became a husband and a father, he had saved the world countless times. But seeing their one failure sitting there in front of him, just brought forth a million feelings, and so many losses. He couldn’t stand to think of it happening all over again.
“Yeah well it would have been fine if we had a longer ignition line running farther from the fence,” Peter called out in his defense.
They were at the hospital in ten minutes, rushing towards labor and delivery, his father was pacing as they put his mother in the bed. “Aw, the boys look great, I’m sorry I ruined your evening,” she said her eyes scrunched up, which meant that she was in pain.
“Because son, as young as you think I am, I can’t keep up with drawing and writing all of these series, the Spider-man series is taking off, mainly because Peter is so excited about it and sometimes helps with filling in the color on his computer after I’ve drawn everything out,” his father said a fond smile on his face. “But my hand cramps up sometimes, and I’m not sure how long I can keep going without getting carpal tunnel and losing the ability to create.”
“I still can’t believe that the great Tony Stark is moping because he wants to read romance novels and drink coffee with little old Mrs. Rogers,” Rhodey said while Bruce laughed in the background. Both him and Bruce had been working on their fall syllabuses, all the while Tony invented something in the background.
“You want me to wear your stuff... is this a kink or something? Because I haven’t taken anything from you at all, I tend to steal Rhodey’s sweaters all of the time because they’re huge he’s like almost as tall as you and is in his school’s ROTC but he’s going into the air force so he’s huge compared to me,” Tony told him, it was the honest truth, because Tony was a little on the shorter side, and all of his friends had always been taller, he always stole their sweaters. He had poor blood circulation at times and was always cold, plus Rhodey’s sweaters were always longer so Tony used them as blankets.
“Coffee, tomorrow night eight I guess, I’ll order some food for us,” Tony said with a smile just as they reached the dorm.
“Tony,” Steve said giving him that look of disapproval.
“Where’s Carol?” he asked as he started digging Steve out.
“No, we won’t, come on,” he couldn’t help but smile as he got Tony into the car. Rushing off to the other side as fast as he could. “You see, well... the second part of this date is that I want to take you to my house.”
“Oh, I will, don’t worry,” Bucky said smiling and Steve worried about what Bucky would do, “You know me, I have a big mouth and all, plus I couldn’t believe the whole Captain America thing, which is wild.”
“I figured it out, by the way,” he said before Steve could finish. He felt his husband stiffening under him.
“I do, I was getting ready to go see him when Sharon came into the room,” he said in his own defense, the food still on the counter because he never found the bag. “She’s should be talking to Sam right now actually.”
Tony walked into the lab where Bruce was working on Vision’s vital signs, Shuri long gone after passing out from working too much without sleep. They had all lost something, but she had lost her brother and Tony understood how that kind of pain was going to drive her, hopefully in a better direction than his own pain had driven him when he had found out the reason why he had lost his mother.
“Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy,” Scott said pulling back a little.
“Hey Steve,” he said walking into the room seeing his boyfriend half dozed off on the bed. “Did you take your medication?”
“No, it’s just that he... um... well he used me to get something, well actually let me rephrase that, he was working on a story with me, I wrote most of it and he wrote the other parts, if you think about it it’s like 60% mine and 40% his, but he decided that he was going to submit it for the final, and it pissed me off, only to find out at the same time, that his father had told him to become friends with me just to get something out of my family’s business.”
“Oh god it’s like Peter got in his head,” Tony said rolling his eyes.
“I’ll cover for you,” Natasha said next to him. “I want to know where they are as much as you, but since mom put that phone ban, no one has their phones here, they’re all in the coat check.”
“Oh,” he wiped his hands on his apron and held it out, he remembered Tony mentioning her being there at the school, but he also remembered that day when Tony had come into the coffee shop, Natasha had been with him as well as another person, the same person standing in front of him at that very moment. “Nice to meet you,” he said with a smile. “I’ve heard Tony talk about you, but we’ve never actually met.”
“Cool, we could even get a jump start on that midterm assignment, if you want to be partners,” Ty said to him, giving him the biggest smile Tony was sure the guy could have, it was disarming for some reason.
“Are you sure? - Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back,” Scott said reminding them of the real risk they were taking by deviating from the plan.
“Yup, will do,” Ty said before heading off to the printers. Tony noticed this, Ty wasn’t the type to read off of a computer he preferred paper copies, Tony on the other hand didn’t care otherwise, everyone had their own quirks. “This is really good,” he said as he sat back down going through each paper reading them and making little notes.
“How strong are we talking about?” Steve pulled out a note pad, ready to take Tony’s order, though he noticed that it was the same kind of paper that he had written his number on a few weeks before.
“No worries,” Steve said wiping his head with his sweater. “I didn’t want to leave you standing there.... so... where’s your date?”
“I’m not moving too fast with this am I?” Steve asked him.
She looked at the two of them, neither one of them moving from where they stood, but then she smiled, “You’ve changed haven’t you Steve,” she said.
He was about to turn and leave when someone rushed into the room and Steve came face to face with Tony who looked like he had seen a ghost.
“No, this one’s different I swear,” Bucky argued shaking Steve’s arm while he said it and why they were friends he wasn’t sure at all when Bucky acted like a love-sick puppy.
“So,” she said, and he knew that she was all confidence at this moment, which would only hurt the moment he had to let her down again. “I was thinking that maybe, we could talk about us.”
“We’ll make it back,” Nat said with a small smile. “I didn’t spend years trying to get the two of you to admit your feelings to give up just when everything was beginning to fit into place.”
“Hey! Holy cow. You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone,” Peter said but Tony couldn’t help but look at him in awe, even after all of these years the kid could babble on without any other thought. “But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, "It's been five years. Come on, they need us!" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time...”
“Can I use the bubble gum bubble bath please,” she said as she clung to him.
“I don’t want to know about who you’re talking about, because your relationships don’t last that long to begin with,” Steve answered, ever since they broke up, Bucky’s had a string of relationships and random hook-ups, with a number of people, that honestly Steve couldn’t understand. He didn’t believe Bucky when he said he was in love, because Bucky fell in love every three seconds with a number of people.
“I think you do, but you have to start by giving him a little space, don’t go running over to the dorm all gun ho, trying to be yourself, you have to think of this strategically.”
“Don’t date someone you knew in diapers,” she had told Steve after he and Bucky had broken it off, which had only made him laugh.
“They will love you Tony,” Steve said knowing that it would be true, his father always wanted someone to talk to about the comics, someone that wasn’t his editors, anyone at the publisher, or even everyone who knows him personally. His mother would just be happy that Steve had found someone to care about. “Come on,” he took Tony’s hand in his and walked them to the door.
“My brother once told me,” Shuri said as the sky turned purple, “That no matter where I am in the world, I will always have the skies of Wakanda with me. When I became queen I understood what he was saying, as I watched that first sunrise in front of my people, and it hurt more than anything because it was something we had once shared.”
“He also calls me platypus and a million other nicknames, and he steals my sweaters, my socks and a million other things that I probably don’t know about,” Rhodes says to Steve as he shakes his hand, gripping it a little tighter than someone would normally do when shaking someone’s hand. “I’m just here to see the guy that Tony wouldn’t shut up about.”
The words haunt him, on nights when he can’t sleep, he swears he could still feel Peter’s ashes in his hands. Tony had given Peter’s Aunt, the ashes he could collect, the two released them around Queens a year after the decimation. Both of them had thrown themselves into their work, May working on various charities, Tony into his business and his family. But now, as he looked at Peter’s smiling face, he knew that he needed to do this, not just for him, but for Riri, Kamala, Miles, and Morgan. They all deserved to see their families again.
“No problem, when you’re both ready, it would be good to know who it is,” he said smiling. It was rare to get the girl to open up, she was smart and Steve liked that Miles had found a friend that he was comfortable with. “I’ll see you both later, I’m going to stop by and see Nat before I go home.”
"Now, we know what it sounds like...,” Scott says after he’s laid out all of the plan.
“Are you looking for something to do?”
“If I can give them back their lives, and keep them at the same time I would,” he said with a sigh.
“A nickname I thought up, mainly because of Iron Man, but unique only to you,” he said wiping the tears from his eyes. “And I will go with you to the gala, if you still want me to.”
“We can’t, everything out there right now is a reminder of what we’ve all lost, there’s nowhere to go, and the worst part is that they already hate us for not doing anything,” Tony said his back was tense against Steve chest. “We tried, we just weren’t ready, the accords all of that prevented us from doing anything, and they’re mad at us because of what was put in place by all of these countries, and it’s just stupid now. All of it is stupid, and I would go back and fix it if I could.”
“Thanks Natasha,” he said trying his best to smile before walking out of the kitchen, the food on the counter left behind, before walking past everyone at the party, his friends smiling and happy. Sharon and Sam talking to one another, as if they had finally gotten on the same page, but without Tony everything felt out of place and he hated it. He walked up to his room on the top floor, because no one wanted to live in the attic, but it was private and something that Steve never really had at home, not when he had his brothers around all the time. There, alone for the first time that night, he cried over what he had just lost.
“Deal,” Bucky said with a smile. “Second, double dates are allowed, but you and Steve can’t pick, he has terrible tastes in dates.”
“Yeah well don’t blab about it America, I don’t want the whole world to know,” Miles said, and Steve knew that he could embarrass his son but instead he looked over at America and smiled.
“Well you’re my cheeseball,” Steve said before bending down and kissing Tony, this was worth every misunderstanding, all of the pining, every moment when he wasn’t sure if they would even get to this point. Because love was something you fought for and if you didn’t take the time to fight for the person, then it wasn’t a love worth your life.
“Nah, it’s fine, I like this, I’ve never had someone so interested in what I write, or at least someone I know.”
“I see a lot of things have changed since I last saw you,” she said an eyebrow quirked up looking at them with a smile on her face.
“Don’t,” Steve said giving Bucky a dirty look, he had survived the first two years of college without anyone knowing that his father was Joseph Rogers, the creator of Captain America, he wanted to survive the rest of his college career in the same way.
“Wait... what,” Bucky said looking at him dumbstruck. “You two weren’t in here kissing?”
“He saved my life in those weeks you were gone, we bonded, it’s new, and I like it.”
“This is wild,” Tony said as they pulled up into Mr. Fury’s flower shop. He could see Ms. Hill at the counter talking to someone, so they were lucky that the place was still open.
Natasha had been home for a little over a week when the news came, and the Stark house was full of cheer, Howard sometimes grumbling about having too many kids, but Tony knew that his father loved them in his own way. Yeah, he had been a little harsh on them over the years, but he had wanted what was best for them. So, now to Tony, born at the end of May, just a few months younger than Natasha, he had come into the world too soon and too small. Screaming and crying, seven weeks premature, his brothers had told him that they had all been afraid that he wouldn’t have made it. They had seen the sadness in their parents’ eyes, Tony had been a miracle when they hadn’t thought it was possible.
They all needed something to come home to, “Yeah lets,” he said before she wheeled him out of the workshop. “Clean up in here boys, I’ll be back by the end of the day.”
“Yeah I know it is, but I needed to be an evil professor for a minute,” Tony said with a smile. “But you did good Steve, you’ll pass the class with no problem.”
Steve hadn’t gotten to finish Tony’s latest story, the one where Iron Man’s identity is revealed, but he thought that Tony would be the best one to choose that, but in Steve’s eyes, just like how Captain America was modeled over him, Iron Man could be Tony.
“I don’t... I don’t... I...,” Tony tried to talk but the words weren’t coming out as his body shook, “Steve, I don’t think I can keep doing this.”
“Please Pep, I’ll be good next week, but just this weekend let me not have anything to do,” he was begging, and if he had the strength he would be on his hands and knees, but he didn’t know if he would get off the floor again.
“Yes, but now, I guess seeing him through your eyes, I think I’m ready for something different, so read the rest,” Steve said and Tony knew that something in their relationship had shifted, because if Steve was trying to see everything from a different angle then that would mean that maybe, or at least Tony hoped, there would be something for them in the future.
“The girls are coming,” she said her eyes scrunched up a bit. His father stood there, dumbstruck, and Steve wasn’t sure of what to do either. “Hospital Joe, get me to the hospital.”
“What happened,” he heard Steve said as the man rushed out of the building still holding onto those glove shield things that apparently T’Challa had given him. Which only made Tony feel a little guilty for still having the shield down in his workshop. He needed to take the chance and give it back, they needed to move forward in all of this if they were really going to try and fix everything.
Honestly, he couldn’t remember when was the last time he had been in this much pain, but watching Steve fight was good enough to keep going. They had almost everyone back, Natasha was still missing and it hurt to think about it. Tony hadn’t missed that look on Barnes’s face, but he didn’t have time to dwell on that while an army of aliens were trying to kill them. That big ugly guy from five years ago caught him by surprise, punching him to the ground.
It was decided that Thor, would join as well as Nebula, Rocket, Carol and Rhodey, which made Tony a little wary about the whole endeavor, Nat and Bruce also joined in, which left Tony a little scared about losing all of his family in one shot, but he was injured and he couldn’t leave the rest of them behind to fend for themselves, not with all of the Asgardians and the Zandarians with them.
“Yeah, I noticed, and I don’t mean by tutoring Steve, I saw your class schedule, and I know you go to the library and spend hours in the robotics lab. How you haven’t fallen apart is beyond me.”
Tony was wheeled back to medical by Nebula, he hated that he wasn’t going, but he was more frightened at the prospect of not being able to fix everything. Once in the room, she helped him onto the bed, she hadn’t said a word to him that hadn’t been directly related to what was happening and he knew it was because she was trying to deal with it all.
“You think I’m cute,” Scott says looking at Hope before he gets sucked back into the quantum tunnel.
“So, let’s get him and the stones, we use them to bring everyone back,” Carol added to the plan that was now forming in front of them.
“I honestly don’t know if I want to see whatever this is,” Tony said getting in the car and closing the door. Steve rushed to the other side and got in, only now realizing just how cold he felt. “I’m afraid that I’m hallucinating this whole thing and that I went into a coma last week, and you never kissed me and that this is just some form of hell.”
“Good,” Tony said with a smile, under this protocol JARVIS is automatically muted in the room, but the cameras recorded everything they did, mostly for their own pleasure, or on those rare occasions when Steve liked to fuck him while watching their home movies. “Let’s play.”
“What?” Thor said looking confused at the group, Bruce rubbing his back knowing full well how badly he had relapsed after just a few days.
It hadn’t taken Steve long to get away from the woman in the elevator, he was sure that they wouldn’t have enough time once she put two and two together, he was glad for one thing and that was the fact that the phones weren’t fancy like the ones that Tony had back at the house. He picked it up and called the extension for Hank Pym that he had found in a book on the side of the desk and called up the number.
“Right,” he said looking at the same place that Steve was looking at. “Well, imagine you’re SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?”
“I know, but now is not the time to have a mini crisis, right now is the time to be the man I know you are and work with us to find a way to fix this.”
“Well I based the other two on my brother Clint, and of course the Black Widow is Natasha, she picked that name and created the back story of a Soviet KGB trained ballerina spy, because she had wanted a character that would be like her but also have a back story to tie in the Winter Soldier,” he explained, Natasha had been the one to originally write the character, she had liked the tragedy of the Winter Soldier storyline and had wanted him to have someone outside of his ties to Captain America. It was also one of the last things that she had written for him and he kept using it in the years afterwards.
“Yes, you do,” he answered back as DUM-E rushed in front of U to bring the ball back to the Princess.
“How do you two know each other,” Sam asked, knowing full well who Tony was, there was no denying that Tony himself was a presence no matter how much he tried hiding himself at the school.
Steve couldn’t help but groan, Harley had grown over the years, but he wasn’t at Steve’s six-foot three-inch height, hell he was taller than all of them with the exception of Hank and their father. “Be nice Harley,” Steve said to his brother before turning to Peter and seeing his eyes wide open.
“No, I’m not,” Steve said in his defense, he didn’t want to go to that stupid party. “Bucky’s going, I’m actually going to go home and sleep since I have tomorrow off for once.”
“Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets,” Carol was clearly irritated over it, especially if she wasn’t going to see her boyfriend in that time. Which had been a surprise to them all, but Steve and Tony took it in stride, even making the couple Kamala’s godparents.
“Really well, almost done with it and everything,” Ty said with a smile on his face, while looking at their story. “I honestly think it’s my best work.”
“Oh Captain, my Captain,” he said knowing that the reference would go over Steve’s head, since they hadn’t gotten to that one movie in particular, and honestly it wasn’t the best reference, but who cared when Captain America himself wanted to lick his ass open. “But that’s not how today is going to work,” he said although he regretted it, but he really just wanted to get the show on the road because this was already too much to handle.
Honestly speaking he hadn’t known that when the semester had started that he would have found Tony, it had been luck on his part that Bucky would get to be Tony’s roommate. This what destiny felt like, a moment of pure coincidence that brought something special into his life. He had barely slept the whole weekend, reading as much as he could, before starting on a brand-new sketchbook. Drawings of Iron Man and Captain America, the whole team as Tony saw it, and in the end, the last few pages it had all turned into drawings of Tony as Steve saw him, right before he fell asleep on the bed, the sketchbook in his arms.
“Okay, then give me the case,” Pierce said.
“Oh, that limited edition Han Solo one, the one that had been made as mistake,” she said with that evil grin on her face, the one she normally got when she was either planning revenge or remembering what she had done. “Teaches him to do what he did.”
“Well that’s both interesting and complicated at the same time,” he said thinking about Vision’s still form in the next room. “My first A.I. was named Jarvis, after someone I dearly cared about, the man practically raised me, he was a wonderful man and if I could I would say that he was as close to a father figure then my own father was.”
“Who’s older,” Steve asked curious because he was getting to know Tony just a little bit better.
“Really,” Tony said shaking his head at what he was seeing. “Clearly they have no sense of self preservation.”
“I wouldn’t, not in a million years,” he wanted to be honest, just like Tony had been for him, he wanted to give him everything and more, but he was afraid of losing himself again. Though he knew for certain that Tony would probably just push for him to be happy.
“Oh my god,” he said as the messages all started popping up, “Steve’s mom is in labor, they’re at the hospital.”
“No buts, no nothing, it’s you and me against the world, if I had the chance to do everything all over again, I would still put that plane in the ice if it meant that you were on the other side waiting for me.”
“They’re going to need to know they’re strong,” his father had told him when Steve gave him a look. “It’s my gift to my kids, sue me.”
“But he’ll grow,” Shuri answered before the two started laughing again.
“Well he should know better than to leave me alone for long periods of time,” he said as he pulled the three of them into a hug. “But now I have you to blame it on.”
It was painful to watch, and it took everything he had not to breakdown himself, instead of watching as the two continued to talk, he pulled Steve towards the building, motioning for everyone else to follow. The two needed a moment, Clint needed to see what his absence was doing to those who had survived with him.
“Yeah, he was in the army with my dad a long time ago, they’ve been friends for years,” Steve said smiling. It was one thing for Tony to know about Captain America, it was another to see Tony’s face when he realized just how many of the people in the comics were real people.
“Do you make it a habit to know everyone that your boys are dating?” Steve could hear his father questioning his mother, Steve of all people knew that his mother just wanted them all to be happy, but she also wanted to get to know people outside of her nursing job.
When they had reached the hospital, all it took was the jolt from the gurney being pulled out to bring that pain into his head full force, he groaned turning over trying to make sure that Steve didn’t see him. He didn’t know why it mattered, but all of a sudden, he was feeling self-conscience about the whole thing. They had put him in a room as soon as he was wheeled in, and he knew that someone had called in advanced, most likely his mother, she was fiercely protective of him. Steve hadn’t left his side at all since they got on the ambulance, and Tony was still reeling over the fact that Steve had considered their dinner the other night as a date. He could kick himself for not kissing him, but that would stupid since he was already in the hospital for something completely different.
There had been a moment back before the battle of New York, where Thor had hit the shield with the hammer, it had become a move that they had prefected over the years, but doing it alone was going to be a feat. Steve threw the hammer only calling it back when Thanos was close enough and had it hit the shield with all the power it could, sending a shockwave towards the Titan, throwing him backwards. As he watched the mad man stand up, Steve called on Thor’s power, taking a running start as he felt the power of the lightning hit him, but he used it to hit Thanos in the face with everything he could, knocking him back.
“Is it bad that I don’t want to be a Stark for once,” he said slumping into his chair. He needed more coffee for this conversation, but he didn’t want to move at all, he felt lazy for the first time in a while, but that’s because he was relaxed and didn’t have a mountain of work to get through.
He had looked up the character a few times, it had taken him a while to realize that it was a part of a fanfiction that had been written by someone named IamIronMan, which meant that Tony read it as well and loved the series. After that Steve couldn’t help himself, he started drawing the character, even if he hadn’t read any of the stories. Instead imagining himself as the character that his father created for him and creating little comics about his adventures with Iron Man who had started to look more and more like Tony. From that it just turned to him wondering about his attraction to Tony and things like that, because he hadn’t really felt anything for anyone since his and Bucky’s break up.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to,” Steve said, pulling Tony away from the dark thoughts in his head. “If it’s too much you don’t have to tell me.”
“Okay,” he said as she went off, she had the ability to be seen when she wanted to be seen, and stay hidden when she didn’t want anyone to know where she was going. While Tony on the other hand, stuck out like a sore thumb, because he usually tripped on something on his way out, or he looked too obvious while sneaking.
“I would, otherwise I’d be hiding in a corner waiting to go home,” Tony smiled leaning into Steve’s hands. “I don’t talk that much, it comes from the trauma of being kidnapped, but also from being in a family full of loud brothers. I think I’ve talked to you more in the last few months than I’ve ever talked to anyone outside of Natasha.”
“What the hell are you doing?” Natasha yelled at the man in the chair as he dropped a magazine on his lap, as he glared at Natasha for interrupting him.
Tony nodded his head before looking around the room, “Have you seen Vision?”
Before Bucky could say anything, he walked out of the room, his bag on the ground, Tony was certain he had spent the night with Natasha, but he wasn’t going to touch that with a ten-foot pole, not at all. What his sister did in her own time was her business, especially since they’ve been spending less and less time together. He was taking too many classes, and she had her own schedule and a boyfriend to boot.
“Hey Stevie,” Bucky said as he reached the room. “Why are you sitting out here, I gave you the key so that you wouldn’t have to.”
“And how many siblings does he have?” Tony asked genuinely curious, because Steve looked like he was born to be America’s golden boy, all apple pie and awe shucks.
“How do we know the Hulk would?” Steve asked.
“Yes, Tony,” she hadn’t been looking at the screen to see what was happening which meant that she had answered from her desk at S.I., and she was in the middle of work, when she should have left for the day.
“Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale, which then triggers the Deutsch proposition. Can we agree on that?” Tony asks, looking at the people in front of him who barely knew the kind of science experiment that they were trying to attempt. “Thank-you. In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home,” he finished, knowing that if he lost Steve, the kids, any of it he wouldn’t survive at all.
“Yeah... sure,” he wasn’t sure why this whole thing felt awkward to him, it was just a guy, well one that had caught his attention but at the moment it felt like he had no right to want anything with Tony. “I’ll make sure to wait until Bucky is around,” Steve said softly. “And he’s not my boyfriend, he’s just my best friend, hopefully you and I can become friends too at some point.”
“Hey,” Sharon called out smiling at Tony. “I haven’t seen you since your birthday party back in May,” she said to Tony.
“That’s.... it’s very romantic of you to put it that way,” Tony told him. “I never had someone so willing to share themselves like that. Everything I’ve known growing up, well it was about being the best at everything, I’m a Stark, and we Stark kids have to change the world. This is the first time where I can just be Tony, not just with school, you’ve given me that too.”
Steve kissed his husband just as a five-year-old Morgan rushed towards them, nearly toppling them over, because as small as she was, she knew exactly where to hit to bring everyone to their level.
Next chapter is the last chapter for the movie verse, and then the actual AU part of the story begins, I have five chapters between the end of Endgame and the fix-it part that are kind of what-if chapters. I've been plotting them for a while, so look forward to that. Some of them are in correlation to what happened, one during the 2012 time jump with Steve and the Bucky is alive thing, the other has to do with 1970.
“Exactly,” Nebula said in the way they had known her to be, short answers and to the point. Tony had once told Steve that it was just the way she was, she hadn’t had the chance to have actual conversations with people until recently, and when she was on mission for anything she wanted to get straight to the point so that they couldn’t deviate from their objective.
“Is that why we couldn’t get a hold of you?”
Tony hadn’t been very shy, until his classmates started picking on him for being a smartass, which made him keep to himself more often than not. He found solace in a comic book character that had started being printed just a few years before he had been born. Captain America was a hero, he saved the world from Nazi’s and fought for the good guys, his alter ego was an artist, and he had a best friend too. Both him and Natasha had grown up loving the character, watching the cartoons, and once the movies had come out, they had watched them as well. It was from watching these that he had started writing, he had been around ten when this had started, Natasha helping him at first, until he had grown confident enough to write on his own. Though Nat, being his best friend and all, had been the one to constantly proof read all of his stories.
It was a distraction if they ever needed one, the both of them needed something else to work towards outside of being the leaders of a group of superheroes. Tony poured all of his energy into upgrading the building, adding FRIDAY to the inside, while Steve worked on the outside, fixing the flooring, making sure that everything would be inhabitable. They called in plumbers, wearing disguises whenever workers were on the property, mainly because they just wanted to be like any other regular couple trying to find solace after so much devastation. No one questioned why the two of them were there, the people did their work and were paid above premium thanks to Tony. It took them nearly six months before the place was ready, their bedroom had been finished the first week, but everything else took time. They picked out every single thing with great detail, even making sure that they had extra bedrooms in case the others visited. No one ever came in that first year, leaving the two of them alone to work out their grief by working on the house, on the property, on whatever it was that Tony did in the garage. The basement was a gym for Steve, the workshop was in the garage, which was on the side of the house.
Hey Cap,” Rumlow said, and Steve nearly turned and punched him for what happened in Lagos.
“Yeah well, you promised that you would read one of your stories, but that was more motivation for me than anything, so I figured that I needed to give you something as well,” Steve was rubbing the back of his head, which only made Tony nervous. “It’s not perfect, but I figured you could put it with the rest of your collection or something.”
“She’s a nurse,” he said, very proud of the work she’s done. “Well right now she’s not working because of the babies, but she’ll probably go back once the girls are born. She really loves her job.”
“So,” Steve said breaking Tony out of his thoughts. “I thought you could help me with this, it’s for the exam we have before Thanksgiving break, and I need to pass the test badly, since I didn’t do so well on the midterm.”
He ran with it, if it meant that he could get her back to bed before Steve found out that she was awake, which was highly unlikely because he had super hearing, and also because Steve had a sixth sense of when the kids were going to do something, or doing something that they shouldn’t be doing.
Steve sighed looking down at his hands, the conversation was good, they were getting to know one another, so it meant that maybe one day they could get somewhere. But then he remembered that Tony spent a lot of time in the library with that other guy, and there was the possibility that they were in a relationship. But for now, he was just going to take as much of Tony as he could, and maybe if Tony and that other guy didn’t work out and they broke up, then he could try to ask Tony out on a date.
“I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?” Howard asked him and Tony almost wanted to shake the man and scream at him for letting someone from Hydra into SHIELD.
“Here you go,” Steve said with a smile, though Tony almost glowered at him because the coffee wasn’t really black, and he just wanted black coffee, but he was also fighting with himself because it was something that Steve had made for him. “Try it Tony before you say something.”
“Come on,” Steve said opening the door, let's get you to bed, maybe some sleep will help you, plus I want to tell you about our date tomorrow.”
Resigning himself to his fate, and turned around and walked further into the office, there were windows on the other side letting in some light, but it was dark enough that they wouldn’t notice him standing there. He needed to think, he needed to find a way to make it outside without people noticing, because they were definitely on the lookout for them now.
“I don't believe we would,” Steve told him, and Tony knew that they were going to fight over this, he didn’t want to fight with Steve. Even after blowing the television, even after the tea party and the conversation with Shuri, he hadn’t really expected this to be happening.
“Tony,” he said but he really couldn’t reprimand them man, not when he was so happy.
“You thought what,” Sam said to him but Steve just shook his head, he wasn’t going to expose Tony to the world, especially since he was sure that Tony really just wanted his privacy as a student.
“I don’t know,” he answered honestly because what did he know.
“Just take this tunnel, it goes on for a few miles, but it lets you out far enough away that you can make it to wherever it is that you wish to go,” she said to them. “And take care of him mystery man.”
There's a lot happening, so I hope it makes sense.
“Goodnight,” she said as she turned over hugging her favorite toy to her chest.
“As promises go, that was pretty lame,” Rocket said back before turning towards the rest of them.
“Come on Captain,” he said standing, his legs a little less shaky, “Let's start walking.”
“Dad,” someone called from downstairs and Tony felt himself stiffen, because if there was one person who couldn’t really lie to anyone it was Riri, she had a tell that only Steve could see.
Tony had just taken a bite of his burger as he heard the question, he almost choked on it for a second and then it took him a minute to swallow it down, because honestly, he was starved, and he was going to take his damn time, plus there was that whole breathing thing that he needed to do. “Well, I’m not the only one, my sister is here too,” he said outing Natasha to his roommate, but since she said he was hot then she probably wouldn’t mind. “But anyway, I just didn’t want to go somewhere that my brothers had already been, unlike them I have to make a name out of myself without all the perks of being a Stark.”
Tony was about to say something, but Bucky shook his head. “It’s even weirder because I’m dating your sister, and you’re okay with that, but I feel stupid because I didn’t see this coming.”
“I won’t make any promises,” she said to him giving him a knowing look.
Steve waited to see if Tony would acknowledge him, he was surprised when Tony looked over at him and gave him a small smile. “Kidnapped me did you?”
“How long have you known about who I was?” he asked knowing that the answer would just hurt more than anything else.
“But...” he tried to argue but Steve turned the frothier on high and acted like he couldn’t hear Tony at all, was this what it felt like when a little kid is in love for the first time, because his heart was beating a little too quickly over just talking to Steve for a few minutes.
“He’s been... well he’s been everywhere,” she sat at the edge of the table. “There were rumors at first, of an assassin named Ronin going around, killing those who he thought shouldn’t have survived the decimation, mostly mobsters, gang members, and the cartel.”
“Yeah, you and me, along with Scott and Bruce, because a rampaging Hulk is easier to hide in plain sight.”
Tony groaned as Morgan ran out of the room screaming for her sisters dressed in only her little robe with her hoodie on, Tony just sat in his and Steve’s room and contemplated all of the ways he could hide and not be found. Instead he got dressed and went to greet his girls, because he was going to have to face the music on this when Steve got home.
There was something about watching Tony work, on anything at all, whether it was a machine or even cooking dinner for the family, that made Steve happy. He knew that Tony was always at his happiest when he had a project that excited him, especially if it was something that he could share with others. Steve knew that Tony looked at him the same way when he had his own projects, but Steve knew the differences, mainly because he liked watching Tony get dirty even more than seeing the man in a three-piece suit.
“That’s great,” Steve told her, genuinely happy that she could try something new, he was happier that she felt comfortable enough to share with them. “You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn’t know where you were going to come down,” he noticed that one of the others in their group was tearing up, it was normal for someone to cry during one of these sessions, but they were all trying their best. “And that’s it. That's those little brave baby steps you gotta take, to try and become whole again. To try and find purpose.”
“I’m here to see my friend,” he said to her. “I guess I should have come over more often than I did.”
“No, not really, it’s nice that they’re still all lovey dovey, my parents are only like that when they want to embarrass us, or when they’re alone, it’s not something they do when they’re in public, I never understood why but I’m sure that it has everything to do with this image that they want to project.”
It wasn’t until the talking stopped that Steve felt himself calm down, well until Clint popped up in front of him and made him drop a roll of quarters. “I don’t need advice Clint,” he said before Clint could say anything.
“Make sure you talk to Sam,” he said just before she walked out giving him a nod. He turned towards the angry red head in front of him, just as Bucky put his arm around her waist.
“You know my grandmother,” Steve said shocked at what he was hearing. “How do you know my grandmother?”
“Okay,” Tony said, he didn’t care about one thing or the other, because maybe in the end all he wanted was to see something Steve had created. “I mean it’s only fair, you read my stories, so I should get the chance to see what you created.”
Hours later, Steve was in Bucky’s room, Bucky had gone to shower after taking a three-hour nap on the couch at Starbucks, leaving Steve there on Tony’s bed. He could have sat on Bucky’s bed, but Steve was almost certain that Bucky never actually washed the sheets since the day he moved into the dorms. When they were kids, Steve remembered that Bucky’s mom would yell at him over the way his room smelled and that he should go wash his sheets or burn them. Steve really hoped that dating Natasha would change that, but he wasn’t going to ask whether it had actually worked, at least not at the moment.
They needed a plan, which was something Steve was good at, Tony knew this, but trying to make the plan work was an entirely different thing, they needed to figure out where the six stones were, and what time would be the best time to go and get them. They needed to make sure the teams that were going would have someone here to make sure that they would come back. They also needed to make sure that Earth was protected while they were all gone, these were all the variables that Tony was working through in his head. All the while he was thinking about his kids, his life, and just how much was going to change in such a short amount of time.
Even with Steve’s brothers talking and roasting marshmallows, their parents joining in, because his mother was hot all of the time, she was carrying twins for heaven’s sake, all the while Steve’s father was wearing more clothes than any of them were, according to Steve his father got cold easily, especially with his mother being pregnant and constantly having the windows wide open. He wondered if his family would be like this when they eventually met Steve and Bucky. It was something to think about, especially when the introductions were happening at a very public party.
“Tony,” he tried to say no but the pouty face Tony was sending him was enough to admit defeat. “Fine, but don’t overdo it, I already know you’re not the type to stay put.”
Tony was never going to get used to traveling like that, he was certain that anything and everything he has ever eaten in his life was trying to hurl its way out of him. Steve as usual was behind him, all buff and perfect as ever, rubbing circles around his back.
“Sure, thing Honey buns,” Tony said, and Steve couldn’t help the flare of jealousy that came over him at the moment, just from hearing a nickname. He shouldn’t be jealous, but then again, this man had something that Steve couldn’t ever really have, he hated himself for feeling that way. “Steve, this is my bestest friend, or at least one of them, James Rhodes, but I call him Rhodey.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked him from the other side of the desk.
“Welcome your sisters, Daisy and Doreen Rogers,” his mother answered with a smile.
, the message said, it was Natasha, of course it was Natasha and she was going to force him to move and he didn’t want to.
James had spent the summer working as an intern at Stark Industries, he had gotten the position after her mother had seen him in action working behind the scenes at a function that Natasha had to run on her own when her mother had gotten sick and couldn’t do it. In reality she hadn’t been sick and had been testing Natasha on whether she could actually do the job on her own. This was one of the things her parents did, they were grooming them all to take over the company so that they could retire at some point in their lives. Though their father wasn’t willing to retire just yet, he still had things that he needed to do.
“They were there at a.... I’ve a vaguely exact idea,” Tony said which meant it was something that he had read at some point but hadn’t kept the information since it wasn’t relevant. Which meant it had happened during the SHIELD data dump and him and Natasha had done the year after.
“I can feel a great disturbance in the universe, my connection to the stone has evolved, while the stone itself no longer exists, I feel as though the entity that had been within it still does, and they’re searching for something,” Vision’s words were like a punch in the gut, if the stones didn’t exist physically what would that mean for the universe itself?
“I’ve had a few of those,” the man said and Steve wasn’t sure if he should keep talking or if he should actually keep working, but he had to be nice to everyone who came into the store, his grandmother had taught him that. Plus, it’s was proving to be a nice distraction at the moment, which of course changed the moment he turned and came face to face with Tony fucking Stark.
“Yeah, that would be swell,” geez now Steve was rubbing off on him. They were almost home free, he just needed to get pass Howard, and an entire army battalion and meet up with Steve, no problem.
Also, if you've been following the other story, Floating has been updated with Laura, Groot, and of course Natasha points of view.
“My name is Carol Danvers, or Captain Marvel if you want the other identity I go by and I’ve been out there working with other planets over the years, Fury could have contacted me at any time, but he didn’t until now and I want to know why, considering how you’re all working at this moment, why didn’t he call when everything was at its worse.”
“You’re Tony Stark,” Peter said before launching into something about artificial intelligence, that Steve couldn’t keep up with. Peter was smart, he created a spider-bot that works from some kind of AI, but he was struggling with it. Tony was the best person to talk about it with, but Steve was still trying to get past his brothers at the moment, and failing. Though how Peter knew about Tony’s work in artificial intelligence was beyond Steve.
“Fine whatever,” Tony said throwing his hands up in the air, which in all honesty was the worse idea because it only made his chest hurt more. “How’s our new guest?”
“So, what should I do next,” he said acting like he didn’t know where he was going with this.
“I’ll run the Avengers,” she said looking at Tony’s vacant stare. “Just take care of him, Rhodes and I can run this place, plus we have new friends. We’ll be fine.”
With a sigh Tony settled himself on Steve’s lap, “First, I’m going to open you up, and shove my nice new, gold titanium alloy Iron Man special vibrator up your ass, but I’m not going to turn it on just yet,” he said as he watched Steve lick his lips, honestly that shouldn’t be as hot as it was, “Then,” he cleared his throat, fucking hell his clothes felt tight, the room felt like it was a million degrees inside. “Then, I’m going to put a nice little ring on mini Cap.”
“He likes anything with machines,” someone said to him, and Steve looked up to see a short brunette with a bob cut in front of him. “He’s also into science, but if you’re thinking about feeding him, then burgers would be the best thing in the world.”
There was a rule that they all had as superheroes, it was mainly because they all understood just how dangerous their job was, but the rule was never take the shot for someone else. Tony liked this rule, yeah, he wasn’t one to follow it most of the time, but he could fly so it didn’t matter. But when Steve did it, well that was another story, it wasn’t something that normally happened, no because again Tony could fly and he was covered in a gold titanium alloy, well it was mostly made out of that since it’s evolved over the years, but he was getting off track. Tony knew that the armor could take most hits sent his way, so of course the fight they had been in would have been a piece of cake. Except his stupid super soldier boyfriend had jumped in the way of an attack and while the vibranium shield had protected his upper body, it had done nothing to stop the momentum of the force of the blast, sending Steve over the edge of the ten-story building and into a pile of rubble on the ground. Tony hadn’t been fast enough to stop it, because the bad guy of the week had turned his attention back to Iron Man not long after the Captain had been sent over the ledge of the building.
“Not really, I’ve been hiding because I’ve been working on stuff in the robotics lab, and I’ve barely been sleeping, I only put two and two together like two weeks ago when I had dinner with him and he started talking about this girl he was in love with, all he could talk about was how her hair shined in the sun and she was as pretty as a flower, the guy has it bad for you.”
"I know you got a lot on the line,” Hope spoke for the first time. “You got a husband, and kids. But I lost people who were very important to me. A lot of people did. And now, now we have a chance to bring them back. Bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even...”
The inside of the store was warm, and the first thing he did was buy a large cup of coffee, Sam their expert barista, was behind the counter. It was late so of course some of the morning people left already, which worried him even more because it meant that Steve could have left for the day. He thanked Sam and walked off towards the stacks to look for something new to read, since he had read everything that he had already brought in the last few weeks. At least his excuse to come here was making them money and giving him too much reading material at the same time.
“I wonder what the world would think about your filthy mouth,” Tony said before leaning in to kiss Steve on the lips. “And the plug can stay, maybe after a nap we can go for round two.”
“Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?” he said wanting to scream out about the whole scenario, it was too much, he had too much to lose now versus what they had before.
When May and Pepper showed up twenty minutes later with several bags of food, from their favorite Chinese food place, Tony felt happy. Yes, he was alone, his family all but abandoned him for the weekend, but he had his friends, these were the people who were always there for him no matter what. He learned that Pepper and May had gotten an apartment together, they were both using their work study money for it, though he knew that they weren’t struggling, not when the both of them usually spent the summer working at S.I. for Thor or Loki, which ever one wanted an assistant. Rhodey told him about what it was like at M.I.T. and about the girl from his Air Force unit that he was trying to get with. He spent the summer at basic training, and luckily got time off to go to school.
There was a brief moment where something flickered in Tony’s eyes, Steve wondered if it was the fact that Sharon had been the one that he had seen with Steve, but then there was something in Sharon’s eyes as well before the two of them were smiling.
“Okay then,” Steve said before moving his hand down to touch Tony’s aching cock, making him jerk as Steve’s fingers grazed it. Slowly Steve pulled the ring off, taking his time as it slipped off, it didn’t take too long after that for Tony to start coming, Steve gripping it to stop him from finishing too fast. “You’re so tight my love,” Steve whispered in his ear. “You have to slow down.”
“Steve,” he pleaded, he just wanted to come, hell he wanted to feel Steve come inside of him. “please,” the word was so soft that even he missed it and he was the one who said it.
Worried, that’s what he was at the moment, he couldn’t figure out why Steve would be late, they had talked about this day, he was supposed to introduce his boyfriend to his parents, and while everyone was happily distracted, Tony just wanted to sneak off and get his phone to make sure that Steve hadn’t gotten into an accident.
It didn’t take too long after that for Tony to come all over his own stomach, hell he would have kept going when Steve pulled away and swiped a bit of it off and licked it off of his fingers. “Fuck,” Tony said but Steve kept going, pushing Tony’s overly sensitive body further and further over the edge.
“Do you think, that maybe they would have found each other after we did all of this,” he said gesturing to the world as a whole, though he was sure Steve would understand what he was saying. “Would the brainwashing have given him those memories back?”
“Which means she saves lives, and that’s something important, plus if it weren’t for her you wouldn’t be here, and I know you’re a great person, so that means she gave you the best parts of herself.”
Digging himself out of the rubble, the first thing he saw was a dark cloud of dust, the entire area was a charred mess around them. Not far from where he was standing, he could see the red white and blue of Steve’s shield, which meant that his husband was nearby. Picking up the shield he went looking for Steve, while looking around for the others.
“We have something,” Clint said looking at them.
Tony could feel the heat of Steve’s words, he knew that Steve was restraining himself, and it wasn’t from the things that were currently keeping him bound to the bed. It was because he knew it was Tony’s punishment, but fucking hell the man still had full control over everything Tony did in their room and it made him shiver with anticipation. There was also the fact that Tony knew that the toys would be used against him in the future, maybe not the vibrator because that was for Steve only.
“Really, that again, I swear Steve keeps asking me that too and it’s so stupid,” Bucky said before going off on a tirade about his scholarship and how he had wanted a single but there hadn’t been any. It was nice to learn more about his roommate, they talked about other things like Bucky’s job, and the girl he was crushing on, which made Tony laugh because he knew from the description that the guy was talking about Natasha and she would eat him alive. He wasn’t going to interfere, it was up to Nat to say yes or no, though Tony didn’t want to tell Bucky that it was his sister either, because if there was one thing that Tony wanted to avoid it was being in the middle of that.
“What do you mean by that?”
“Oh,” Stark said and Steve could see the man blushing, they were the same age he was sure of that, so why would Stark be embarrassed over this. “Well, actually, um, I know the person who used to run this place.”
“That sounds great, especially since I didn’t have any real ideas about what to write about,” Tony said, the only story in his head with his own fanfiction story, he hadn’t put much thought into what to write for this project so having to do the other half of the story that was already essentially written... well it was something that he was good at.
“It’s no problem, we’re all under the same amount of pressure right now, so don’t worry so much, but if we only have one chance at a test run, who should we send?” Bruce asked knowing that this was going to be their one shot to make sure the machine worked, if not they would have to pare down the teams, even though they were already pushing it with the amount of people going.
“We kept it quiet for a reason, and it would be nice if you could too,” he said to her and she nodded back at him.
There's another way,” Tony said to them as he stood up. Tony his genius husband knew what they needed, and he was happy for that. “To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State.
“You two have to eat,” Clint said as he slowly pulled Tony’s wheelchair away from the computer he was working on.
“Where is she? Have you seen her, because Valkyrie came to me asking about her and she was nowhere near us, she vanished,” Carol said to him and he knew something was wrong with the whole situation.
“Yeah well, like you, my dad started to put more of my own life into the comics, Bucky is the Winter Soldier, my friend Sam is the Falcon, things like that, but the Winter Soldier story came from the year that Bucky and I broke up, I had been really heart broken, so my dad who already had issues with my relationship with Buck, turned the story into that.”
“I did,” Scott said to him and Tony wanted to scream out at the man, the whole thing had been a fluke.
There was one orphanage near the tip of Manhattan that he hadn’t visited until one rainy September afternoon, he had been on his way home when he saw it, the building falling apart on the outside, but it was warm on the inside. Kids running around, laughing, playing, it felt like the lake house when all of the kids were there, Tony automatically wanted to offer his services. He ended up sitting in a room with a fussy toddler, the people working there were having a hard time with her.
“Get your helmet on, Scott,” Hope said with a smile as she listened to the panicked conversation happening next to her. “We’re going to start by sending you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, and then we’ll bring you back in 10 seconds. That makes sense, right?”
The Army/Airforce thing between Steve and Carol is more of a reference to their Avengers Assemble counterparts.
“Yeah but somehow Steve had the same do gooder personality, he hated bullies growing up, he always broke the rules if it meant that someone would benefit from the outcome, usually those people were in need of help in some way or another. In a way he grew up to be the one thing he hated, and you are the first person to give him the perspective to see Captain America as something more than his father’s creation.”
“Whatever man,” Bucky said pushing Steve as they both walked off towards the dining hall.
“No,” she said giggling at him.
They were sitting so close to each other, Tony could smell Steve, and it smelled like heaven and apple pie for some strange reason. He pushed aside his thoughts and moved onto the work at hand, trying to distract himself and not attempt to take a bite out of Steve. As tempting as it was, he was still off limits, no matter how much Tony wanted to be near the guy. He wasn’t going to attempt anything if Steve was still secretly harboring feelings for Bucky.
“Thor,” Nebula called out without giving them the option to think about this further. She motioned for the god to join them, Rhodes walking in with bags of food, Carol behind him with several boxes of Pizza.
“I hope to keep that up,” he said feeling like he’s a father whose kid is going off to college, instead of going off on some intergalactic mission where everyone he knows and cares for could possible die. He could feel the tears start before she pulled away, “Just be safe okay,” he told her, not wanting to lose another person to that madman.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh, seeing the hopeless look on his father’s face as he trailed behind his mother. “No laughing Steve, please, this is very stressful,” his father said to him.
Getting out of the car and walking over to where Tony was seated, Steve could only hope that this whole thing was a good idea, he opened the door and just kneeled down next to the man’s still form.
In his story Cap was in love with Iron Man, and while Cap hadn’t known the true identity of his friend it hadn’t stopped him from falling in love. Natasha had called it cheesy in a way, but it was his story to tell, even when she helped him with his writing, even when she called it too much like one of those romcoms that they always watched together, she still smiled at the sad pining looks that the two would give one another. He knew that she was a secret romantic at heart, he saw the hopeful looks she had given him whenever she talked about Bucky, she felt the same way that Bucky did, they were in love, even with only two months of dating even with her secrecy about who she was. Tony had taken their story and slowly weaved it into his own, even before learning the truth about Steve, the Winter Soldier had fallen for the Black Widow, and no one knew about it, because that was as far as Tony would write it. Natasha would have to write her own story, he wasn’t going to go anywhere near it.
Steve went to the back only to find Natasha yelling at the guy a stapler in her hand, yelling about stapling the guy’s balls to his ass, “You shouldn’t do that around kids, what the fuck is wrong with you,” she was yelling.
“We met the last time I was here, he helped me and I helped him, I told him that if he ever needed me to send me a message,” she said and he could see a twinge of sadness in her eyes before it was gone.
“She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to,” Bruce said a slight twinge of green coloring his face.
“You’re only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.”
“Good, now eat,” Pepper said before she walked away leaving the two of them in front of two plates of food.
Honestly if he could he would slam his head against the bookcase that Steve had just fixed, if it weren’t for the fact that the guy had just fixed the damn thing. What was wrong with him, he didn’t even know the guy, this was the kind of thing he only did with someone he liked, which hadn’t happened in a long time, not since his last relationship with Pepper but that had ended years ago and they were better friends than anything, and he liked Pepper’s girlfriend enough to not piss either of them off.
“It was probably a good thing that Fury was so paranoid then,” he said, even though he hated the secrets that Fury had kept when everything had happened.
Steve bent down and kissed Tony on the forehead, “I’ll come back I swear,” he whispered before walking out of the room, he knew if he stopped again, if he looked back, he wouldn’t have the heart to leave. But he needed to do this, not just for Tony, but for everyone who was counting on them.
“Quantum Leap,” Scott added.
“I don’t anymore,” Bruce said looking at him. “Remember I told you about how Thor was coping with everything, well in the end he also helped me learn more about myself and about the Hulk. We’re not the same, we would never be, but we’re together in all of this, we’re like brothers except we share a single body. So, I learned, and left thing for him to learn, in the end what happened was a coexistence of a kind. I let him out more, he stopped trying to take over, we learned to be.”
“My kids are not going to fall behind in school,” he would say as he gave them rewards for each good report card.
Taking the chance, he leaned down and kissed his husband, no one else was watching, of course they weren’t, the two of them were in a closet in an underground SHIELD facility being chased by every guard the facility had, because they broke in here to steal two things.
“Funny,” Steve said groaning as he got up. “What happened? Are the kids okay, Carol was yelling earlier.”
“Yeah well, I already have a lot to say, but I wouldn’t know what to get your dad, moms are easy, I know because my mom loves getting flowers all of the time, she likes to make things out of them once they dry out and everything.”
“You’re right about that especially when it said it was their favorite place,” he sighed as he finished the last of the cash counts and smiled at how much they had made. It was only the first day, they wouldn’t have this kind of business all of the time. “Plus, the caption said that this was their favorite place, we’ve only been open for a day.”
It took two weeks before everything in Tony’s life went to hell, he should have known that nothing good would last forever. The thing was that... the first thing that happened… well it happened during his fiction writing class, as his professor pulled him over and explained to him that his story sounded too much like the Captain America comics.
“Yeah, there’s a lot of soldiers out there looking for us, but I also saw my dad, which was something else entirely, he said he would do anything for me, and I knew he wasn’t, and as much as I wanted to yell at him about it,” Tony said without stopping, he was rambling and Steve loved it. “I didn’t, mainly because I saw Jarvis, the real Jarvis standing there, and I knew everything would be alright, I wouldn’t have the happy childhood or anything like that, but as long as Jarvis and his wife were there, I knew I would turn out alright.”
Taking over the bookstore from his Grandmother had been his dream, so when she had decided to move to warm climates, she had called Steve. Honestly, he wasn’t sure why she hadn’t done it sooner, he loved his Nana with everything in him, but he couldn’t understand why she hadn’t retired earlier. He had been going to school upstate near the army base that he had been stationed at and had finished up his degree in Art. He had been in the army for ten years and had made friends from all over the country, some of which had left the army for one reason or another, after he was done he had gone back to school, so there he was now in his thirties and the owner of his own store.
“The guards are looking for the two of you, and I’m taking a guess that whatever it was that you came looking for was something important enough for you to break into a heavily guarded facility.”
“Nope, not today, you promised,” Nat said leaning back onto him. “We’re having dinner today as in now,” she was giving him that look where anything and everything she said was law. “Jan says the best dining hall is the one we’re next to and we’re going.”
“Listen, if you want to wait in my room for your boyfriend, you can, but I would prefer if he hadn’t given you a key,” Tony told him, he knew that something had gone wrong at some point because he wasn’t dating anyone and while the words were cutting into him, he knew it was a violation of Tony’s privacy when he had been alone in the room.
“That was after Thor talked about everything Bruce had ever worked on, it’s very intriguing stuff,” his father said smiling, which was strange to see because Tony could only ever remember the scowling face, but maybe his mother had been right about one thing, maybe Tony never really looked at his father to see if he were proud or anything. “Now, let's get this party going, I would like to be home before midnight tonight.”
“Not at first, but mainly because I was worried about you, so I got a bit of tunnel vision, you know how protective I am of you, since you’re the baby.”
“Oh, I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?” Thor looked around the room, it wasn’t about the opportunity, it was about making sure that they all survived this.
“I don’t think that’s true Tony,” Steve said and the smile on his face made him glow even more.
“Tony,” he said before kissing his husband on the lips. “I would pick you over anyone else, I did pick you, I’ve known you longer than your dad, the commandos, even Peggy, you’re my life, you gave me a home and a family, I need you and I really wish you would get that through your thick head.”
“You know you two should just kiss and make up already, it’s bad for team moral if you keep fighting because you want to get into each other’s pants,” Natasha said walking in past Rhodey, which only made Tony laugh before he finally let go of Steve, only to see the other man blush. That was a new development.
“Now, I will get the mind stone,” Steve turned towards them, and while Tony knew that Steve hated his plan, it was the only one they had. “Scott you’re going to have to work with Tony to get the tesseract, his face is too recognizable, so you both have to work on getting a hold of the cube without bringing too much attention to yourselves.”
“You already have, you’ve been helping me with it for the last couple of weeks,” Ty told him, but it felt more like being hit by a truck. The story they had been working on, the one outside of the one that they had done for class, where Tony honestly did more work on than Ty.
Tony was worried, he knew that this would change a lot of things, and he wasn’t sure if he was prepared for it. It had taken him a long time to move on, to be able to let go of one of the biggest failures of his life. What did it mean when the past started to come back to him, he wondered, especially if he was willing to risk losing his kids in the process.
“Maybe, maybe not, we’ll never know unless we try,” Tony said to him, knowing full well that even some theories were meant to be changed.
They went out to meet Thor their coats on, Tony left his off, he was already sweating in the suit and he didn’t want to add to that once they were in the car, because as big as his brother was, the man had zero body fat, he was always cold and had the tendency of blasting the heat. They let Bruce take the front seat, while him and Natasha sat in the back, Tony had already ruined their night, he didn’t want them to be too far from one another if he could help it.
Sometimes you need to walk through fire before you can come out on the other side.
“No one blamed you Bruce,” Natasha said looking at him with something in her eyes, their relationship hadn’t worked out, but their friendship still stood there in the ashes. They were a family, one that that stuck together.
The café that the meetings were held in had been abandoned long ago, no one used the machines, but Steve made sure to upkeep the place for them. That poster on the wall was the only reminder of the fact that they had to keep moving forward.
There was a fine line between flirting and moping and Tony was on the border, mainly because he didn’t know what Steve wanted out of their date the other night. He really tried to read the other man, but even after hours of talking and walking around, the night just ended with Steve waving at him as he got into an uber. To top it all off Tony hadn’t slept much, and ended up oversleeping, so he couldn’t stop at the bookstore before his morning class for coffee. Which was just a lie, because it would have been a ploy to just see Steve and maybe try asking him on a second date. He wasn’t even sure if the guy was anywhere on any spectrum, but since they had talked about things Tony was almost certain that there was something there.
Their new visitor was walked over to them, Steve couldn’t help but look at Rhodes who was smiling like he had just won the lottery, the man was beaming as if the sun had just risen in front of him, “Where’s Fury?” she asked him directly. Nodding at Rhodes before she addressed him, which meant that there was something bigger at play.
“Why, your dad worked hard on Captain America.”
“Together,” he heard Tony whisper, which distracted him for a moment, but it was all he needed to keep going even as Thanos’ double sword smashed down on the shield severing it in half and sending him flying across what had once been their home, and into the ground.
Thanos didn’t know the true stubbornness of Steve Rogers, he was the same guy who continuously tried to get into the army, the guy who relentlessly went after Hydra, the guy who woke up displaced out of time, and still fought with everything he had. He had something to fight for now too, he had his family to fight for, his husband, his kids.
As he finished saying this, he could see the blue of Steve’s eyes get swallowed up by nothing but blackness, he could have blamed it on the darkness of the room but then Steve licked his lips and gave him a quick smile and Tony automatically knew that his boyfriend was game for whatever Tony had planned.
“He really was a cute kid,” she said smiling. “I’ll tell him more later.”
“I don’t want them,” Steve said, honestly for someone who constantly dominated Tony he was a child when it came to being injured.
As for Tony and Steve, they had spent the summer together, planning the Avengers comic, as well as going camping, which surprised her, but her brother loved it and she wasn’t going to deny him something like that. Steve had asked her if it would be crazy to propose to Tony while they were so young, but she could only tell him to wait at least until they were past the first run of the comic before doing anything. Tony would be twenty-one, and they could celebrate as much as they want. She saw the way that Steve looked at Tony and knew that they would be happy together for a very long time. Plus, she wanted a double wedding, it would be so much fun for her and James to get married on the same day as Steve and Tony, she had it planned out already, now she just had to wait for that day.
Before Tony could say anything, Bruce grabbed Thor’s face and made the man focus on him. “Thor, you’ve helped me out of what I had gone through more time than I can count, you’ve always helped me. You’ve encouraged my relationship with the Hulk, you helped me.”
Hearing those words from Steve, who had stuck to his man out of time shtick for so long, say that he wanted to try to move forward was a lot for Tony to take in. But he also took them to heart, working with Stark Industries and Pepper, to help with recovery, working on projects while in the garage of the lake house. He wanted to try, just like Steve was trying, but he still couldn’t bring himself to go to NAF and see everyone, that took a lot more time then he was ready for. He still talked to them, on video calls mostly, Rhodey came over to check on him a lot before going on a mission. But mostly, they left him to work on his guilt through the one thing he knew best, and that was building.
He knew what she meant, and from the size and age of little Morgan, it meant that she had been born on the day of the devastation, and it hurt to think of it that way. The nurse told him his worse fears, the little girl had been born on a cab on the way to the hospital, when the driver, and her parents were lost. The bag had said the parents last name but no first name, so the hospital called her little girl Morgan. Tony stayed with her the rest of the day, before taking her to a doctor to find out that she had an ear infection and that’s why she was crying so much. When he went back to the building he asked if he could take her with him, and the caretaker only nodded, noting that she was comfortable with him.
“Alexander Pierce,” other Tony said. “He’s the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury.”
“Want to get some air?” Howard asked him and he thought sweet relief, he would be able to put some distance between the two of them if they went up top.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not all over the place,” Miles said defending himself.
“I have a library date with one of my classmates from writing class, so I won’t be in the way tonight,” Tony said to them before heading towards the door, making Steve wish that he could try and say something. “I’ll see you later.”
“Ross said that Fury left something next to his car, something that was beeping,” Sharon said looking at the woman standing next to Steve. “I’m guessing she was the one on the other side of that considering her outfit.”
“Yes, I know it’s a little silly.”
“Yeah I know, I don’t want her activating something, but FRIDAY keeps the protocols to stop her from activating the suits by accident,” Tony said as he put Morgan in her chair at the table as Steve went over to the fridge to get the ingredients.
“You know,” Ty said as he sat down during his break, “This story could be something else, I never had my stories work so well until we started working together, it’s nice.”
“Plus, we know you have a hot roommate,” Natasha said to him, “Jan said so,” her sing songy tone reminded him of what they had been like at home when they had fawned over the guy, they had picked to play Captain America in the movies.
“I even started drawing them, which was weird because I refused to pick up a Captain America comic since third grade, but I didn’t draw the version of Cap that my father did, I drew myself instead, and then I drew you as Iron Man,” Steve said, and Tony could see the blush creeping up. “I think I wanted to create my own version, because the one my father created didn’t feel real to me.”
Backstory, if you're curious, I used to work at a store that had a skylight that went from the first floor (fiction section) all the way to the basement (the part where the children's section was). So, there had always been these weird things happening in the fiction section, books would fall out of the shelves, random stains would appear, things like that. The part that had gone into the basement had been sealed off after someone fallen through the skylight and landed in the basement, and we often wondered if that person haunted the store.
“Yeah you do, I mean you were just going to spend the whole weekend watching Captain America movies and writing fanfiction, I know you Tones, you never really change.”
“Right?” Scott answered a little too excited now, but that’s what Steve did when he gave those speeches.
After a while the rush died down, Thor smiled happily from the door, especially when his boyfriend had shown up, which surprised Steve because he hadn’t thought to ask Thor about his life. Though if Thor looked as happy as he was then Steve couldn’t fault him anything. He greeted customers and walked around, every once and a while grabbing a book off the shelf and looking through it.
“I won’t do it if you don’t want me to,” Steve said taking Tony’s hand before he could walk off. “I’m not going to go against you on this, I know how that usually works with us, so it’s either we both agree on it or it doesn’t happen at all.”
“Uh guys?” Scott let out a panicked cry. “This.... this doesn’t feel right.”
“Yeah... not going to happen,” Bucky said walking over as he pulled his wet hair into a bun. “What were you thinking anyway, you know I always do that so why would you stand behind the door?”
“Well he’s still alive,” was all Bruce said before Steve sighed and walked off, he needed some air, and a moment away from whatever craziness had just happened.
“He gave you a key, to our room, why???” Tony wasn’t sure why he was angry, maybe it’s because his roommate let his ex-boyfriend or boyfriend or whatever, have a key to their room, where Tony kept all of his stuff, or it could have been the crush he already had on the blonde in front of him, and he wasn’t sure if he was dating someone, or single. He didn’t know what to do or where to go, gathering his laptop and his writing notebook and throwing it in his backpack, before rushing towards the door probably hadn’t been the best idea in the world.
“Yeah it is,” Steve said with a smile. “How are you Vision?”
He watched as everyone fought, keeping an eye on whoever needed help, there were so many people fighting with them, so many more lives at stake, he couldn’t figure out what it was going to take to end the fight for good.
“Ish, no’ booken,” Tony said and while it was cute to hear him say it, and nice to see him there trying to help Natasha, but now Steve was just worried, and wasn’t sure if the store’s insurance would cover a customer getting injured to this point.
“You ruined the time heist,” Scott yelled back.
“I have eyes on Loki,” his other self said. “14th floor.”
“Well. That'll be easy to remember,” his father said and Tony was about ten seconds from muttering the words
“Gone,” he said wondering why she hadn’t asked Rhodes about Fury when it looked like they knew each other, but pushed it aside. “How do you know Fury?”
It was an hour later, after the Hulk had calmed down enough for Bruce to come out, after Thor had gone back to drinking everything he could find, after Clint cried in the conference room, throwing everything he could. After Steve took Tony to their in-suite bathroom and the two of them held onto one another while under the too hot spray of water. The hour feeling longer than it should have, before they all met on the dock outside of facility.
That was how Tony met Steve’s parents, no questions about his family or who he really was, just Steve’s parents’ playful bickering, his brothers hovering, Peter being the only one really interested in Tony’s projects, but only because he was as smart as Tony was, Harley snickering, and Steve, poor Steve, just looked at them with a fond exasperated look on his face. This was a family that was so different from his own, but they had welcomed him into it no questions asked, all because Steve had brought him to the house.
“Actually yes, because James and I have a very normal relationship, on that involves communication and actual flirting.”
“We found Pepper and Happy, they’re on their way here,” Rhodey said pulling Tony out of his thoughts.
“Yeah except you were caught with your pants down,” Thor said keeping the guy in the chair while Steve blocked Natasha.
“Yeah I do, one time on a date he took me to a field and set up a telescope to see some meteor shower,” Bucky said but Tony’s heart skipped a beat, that was something that he would have liked, he could see himself and Steve just making wishes on falling stars. “There was also that time in Junior year where we went into the city and he took me to some random Shawarma place, he swore that it was because we had never tried something like that.”
“It’s not weird you know,” Tony said knowing that she was ramping up to something.
“No one tell her,” Tony said in a panic.
“Who are all of these other characters?” Steve asked him, interrupting the story. “I’ve never heard of them and I’m pretty sure that my dad wasn’t this inventive with code names.”
“There’s no us Sharon, I told you last semester,” he told her for what felt like the millionth time in his mind.
“There is that, plus he likes to write a lot, but I’m okay with that, it’s interesting to see him get excited over something, it’s like the who universe lit up just for him.”
Steve hadn’t come back right away, and Tony had been glad for the few minutes he had to himself, mainly because a story was already brewing in his mind. He opened his laptop and started typing away, the story was about the first time him and Natasha had a recital together, it happened on the same day he learned that Nat, as well as their brothers, were all adopted, it was the day he learned that sometimes a family could be stitched together, they didn’t have to be born into it either. He changed as much as he could about his own life, not wanting people to know too much about who he was or about his sister.
Miles moved forward, sitting next to Tony, giving him that puppy eyed stare that he had learned from Steve, “Please dad we want to help.”
Tony didn’t really care what the four of them did, he cared more about Thor’s mental state, because while they all dealt with the fallout of the decimation their own way, Thor’s way of dealing reminded Tony more of how he had dealt with his parents’ deaths when he was twenty-one. He wanted to make sure that Thor didn’t end up going down that route, and if the other three kept close to him, and helped him, it didn’t matter how, as long as Thor knew that there were people there for him that was all that really mattered.
“We can take the Benatar,” Rocket said jumping off the table. “It’s can travel at light speed across the known universe.”
“I wanted to kiss you the other night, I bet your lips are soft... so soft... I wonder what you would look like with a beard?” There was amusement in Steve’s eyes, but he couldn’t stop himself, “Maybe some hot lumberjack, do you own flannel shirts, I bet you do, it would look really good on you... maybe some blue checkered shirt.”
“Don’t move him,” Tony told him worried about what kind of damage the gauntlet had done if it was already manifesting on the scientist.
“I thought you were still pining over Bucky, or dating someone else,” Tony blurted out and Steve knew that this was going to be something that they would have to work through. He had a history with Bucky, and most likely the whole rumor about him and Sharon had gotten to Tony as well and he hated for not squashing it when he had the chance.
He knew that she was fiercely protective, she had chosen the children’s books because she liked kids, but this was another side of her that no one really got to see. You see the one thing that most people didn’t know about Natasha was that she was a real momma bear when it came to protecting children. The reason stemmed from how she had grown up, she had always told him that no kid should have to live like she had.
Steve turned to him and smiled. “In plain sight,” he said pointing at the suits who were clearly not soldiers moving towards what looked like an ammunitions bunker.
“Tony, my parents don’t need things like that.”
“How about dinner,” Tony said with a smile on his face, and that was what did it for him, all Tony had to do was smile at him and Steve was putty in the man’s hands.
“He was at my store today and was in an accident, we’re headed to the hospital now, but I wanted to make sure that someone was called about what had happened,” Steve said to her but all Tony could think about was the warmth of his hand, they were a little rough, but that’s because Mrs. Rogers had told him that Steve had gone to the army.
Steve grumbled as he attempted to get comfortable, the pillow helped but even Tony knew that that position wouldn’t be comfortable for anyone to sleep in. It’s a good thing he had plans for when Steve woke up, a lot of really dirty plans, but hey, they didn’t call him the futurist for nothing.
“People died because they didn’t have a pilot, or a train conductor, more than what the snap caused,” Sharon Carter added her face trained on the growing list of people missing or dead. “There’s no balance at all when more died then lived.”
No this isn't the end of the story, there's more to come.
“The villain thing only happened because we broke up, so don’t blame anyone but me about that,” Steve remembered being heartbroken at first, they had been weeks away from prom when Bucky had ended it, this was after one trip to the school because they wanted the incoming freshmen to get to know the campus, and it had taken all summer and the first half of their first semester before Steve had been comfortable enough to be Bucky’s friend again. His father had taken his heartbreak and used it in the story by killing off Bucky’s character and having him come back as the Winter Soldier.
When he arrived, the store looked like it was glowing, he remembered with Mrs. Rogers had run the place, she had always made sure that the lights were on well into the night, because winter always brought some kind of magic to it. Even with everything that Steve had done to revive the place, it still felt like the home that Tony had been given when he was a kid. His little safe haven. He wondered if he would still have that if the whole thing with Steve didn’t really work out, he didn’t even want to bring it up because he feared losing this little part of his life.
Also Quantum Theory is impossible if you don't have a degree in it, I tried to read up on it and it made no sense to me.
“You can stay you know,” Tony whispered to him.
“I’m sorry to the both of you, but your brothers have also been called away on business,” Jarvis told them as they drove down the interstate towards the city.
“I’m not like that.”
Nebula was looking at him, her eyes still stoic as ever, but there was something in her eyes, and it just made Tony grab her and give her a hug. She was one of his kids, like Peter, Vision and Harley, like his bots and his girl FRIDAY.
“Doesn’t matter if I’m dumb you love me anyway,” James said to her before leaning over and kissing her. “You only really like me for my good looks.”
“All right, move it Stuart Little,” Tony said knowing that this was their best chance, since the men in front of them were having a pissing contest over an infinity stone. “Things are getting dicey up here. Let’s go.”
Someone behind them snorted out something, as something splashing onto the ground right behind Tony’s feet, Steve turned and saw Clint drinking juice from the carton, something Tony hates with a passion. Clint was looking at them all wide eyed, while holding Lila to his chest, covering her other ear.
“Like you said,” Steve added, “We’re family, and in families we take care of one another, because what use are, we if you continue to hurt yourself just because we couldn’t stop Thanos. We all suffered Thor, but this is why we’re here, we’re going to try to fix everything, including ourselves.”
“What if someone here used the stones and decided to change everything, what would happen then?” Shuri asked the room, which was now silent as they thought about what they were attempting.
“You don’t know that honey, for all we know they’re going to hold hands on the way out and terrorize us until we die,” his father said brushing off a piece of hair from his mother’s face.
Ty looked back at Tony with nothing but hate in his eyes, he almost got away with handing in something that Tony had helped him with, but now he wasn’t going to get that chance. This whole semester had been a rollercoaster ride of questions and answers about his life and now it was almost over, and he had never felt more comfortable in his own skin than he did at that moment. It took another twenty minutes before Professor Coulson came back into the room, and honestly Tony had wanted to just leave, but he stayed if only to know what happened.
When class was over, he just went straight to the library, fearing that Steve would just show up, because of all things in this world, Tony’s roommate was also his best friend and ex all rolled into one. He hadn’t even gone back to his room since the party, he had hidden out in the robotics lab with his bottle of whatever the hell that was, slowly drinking while at the same time creating. That’s how his bot had been finished, in an alcohol fuel haze, and he had been afraid that the whole project would have been a failure on his part. But in the end the bot had come to life and everything kept going, except his own heart.
"So, you might not see me for a long time,” the words weren’t meant for Nat, they were meant for Rhodes who looked defeated from the other com channel.
“I don’t know, it’s not flowing like the one we did before, I’m trying to get better at writing the other stuff, but it’s not working,” Ty slumped over on him acting dejected but it was only his way of getting Tony to help him.
“What about Nat and Tony?” Bucky said and Steve felt guilty, he really wanted to be at the Gala, but this was family. “Steve?”
“Last night was nice,” Natasha said all nonchalant, even though she was smiling.
“I don’t know, maybe use something that’s already happened, think about how we were just talking about Clint, maybe there’s something from when we were kids that could inspire you.”
“I think I’m happy that I’m an only child if you have that many siblings, but then again I did grow up with Steve and his crazy family, so I don’t really know what to think,” Bucky said grabbing Tony’s attention, because telling anyone saying anything about Steve to him was like giving a kid candy.
“Over the weekend, while I was agonizing over whether to run and find you or listening to everyone else and what they had to say about the whole thing, well I sat down and read everything you wrote, it wasn’t that hard to find either because no one out there would write so much about a character that didn’t exist in the comics my dad created.”
“Peter, I’m not going to die, I’m going to camp in the back yard near the fire pit,”’ Steve said as he drove towards campus. He wanted to see Tony and ask him if the plan would be alright, but mostly he just wanted to see Tony. They were in the honeymoon phase, and he liked it because it gave him an excuse to just hear Tony talk about whatever it was that he had on his mind, and if Steve couldn’t keep up, well it didn’t really matter as long as Tony was happy.
“How vague?”
“My mom wanted us to have normal lives,” especially after the last kidnapping. “Well as normal as a bunch of Stark kids could have, so it was kept out of the public, I actually wanted to have a mathematics major added but she told me to slow down, though I might still do it later on.”
“Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me,” Natasha continued he work without stopping, her sandwich sitting in front of her.
When the little girl popped out she put her hand up, because of course Steve had decided to show their little rugrat videos of her dads as heroes and like their other three kids, Morgan also wanted to be a hero as well. So she had a light on her hand, like it was his replusor gloves and pointed it up at him.
He was leaving it up to Tony, not wanting to rush into anything too quickly and ruining what he was sure had happened in the middle of the night. He rushed off without telling Tony where he was going, and he regretted it the moment he got into his car and drove off, sending Tony a message was not an option while driving and he was already running late, so it would have to wait until at least lunch time, but now he wishes that he hadn’t run off like he had. It had been a stupid move on his part, and hopefully Bucky would cover his mistake. He didn’t want to lose something he barely had.
“Not too loud, the kids can hear you,” Natasha called out from the next aisle over.
The razor was sharp against his skin, but he hadn’t really noticed, it was strange that what he was seeing for the first time in a long time was what the journey had done to him. Even when the beard was gone, and his face looked as it once had, he saw that he had aged. He was older in so many ways, even though Tony would tell him that he had a baby face, he knew that he was no longer that boy from Brooklyn, the man out of time, he had found his place in his new world, all that was truly keeping him back was himself and he hated it. He hated that small part of him that had tried to hard to hold onto something that no longer existed, Bucky had been his link to the past, so had been Peggy, but he didn’t need them to remember who he had once been. He saw it in the way he had carried on for the last few years, but he needed to move on, the past was just that in the past and all the was left was an uncertain future.
“Seriously you went through one of them,” Scott said as they heard the Hulk rawr in the background. “What did you just want them to eat you or something?”
Jumping down from the side of the building he made his way to where Tony and Scott were standing. He could see the defeated looks on their faces long before he reached them.
“He left,” Tony said feeling a million times more awkward, because it hadn’t been a date, it had just been school work, and for some reason, he had said it was a date to see if Steve would react to it, which just felt really stupid now.
Why now? Why not five years before? He could have a million questions and no answers, but he didn’t know where to start. So, when he hadn’t said a word Shuri just launched into a whole thing, “I worked on the stone, the one we were trying to create, and yesterday I ended up mixing something I had found in the lab, it was a replica of the fruit that gives the Black Panther powers to the next king. The original fruit doesn’t exist anymore, but the synthetic one I’ve been creating to recreate the fruit is close enough to the original, to the last one that my brother had seven years ago.”
“Why did she call?” he asked curious.
When he got back, Bucky was dressed in a dark blue shirt, he was tying up his boots over his pants, never really looking up to meet Tony’s eyes. “We should get breakfast, since we’re up early,” was all he said and Tony wasn’t sure what to think, he just hummed in agreement, before throwing on Rhodey’s MIT sweatshirt, the one he had given Tony over Thanksgiving. It was like armor for him, someone who was close enough to protect him when everything went to shit.
“You don’t own me,” he said before turning his attention to the people in front of him.
All Tony could do was nod as he walked out of the room alongside Ty, “Sure I’ll see you there,” he said before heading back to his dorm, he had a story to write, one where Iron Man and Captain America were front and center, one where he didn’t have to worry about writing for class or thinking about his projects just yet, and after he had to head to the robotics lab, because he didn’t want to accidentally set his room on fire trying to make Butterfingers a brother.
His mother had been proud of him, his father less so, but only because Tony was the only legitimate heir to the Stark fortune, his father had always been harder on him than on his brothers. Though he hated the man, he took the pain in stride, his brothers took over parts of the company, each working their way up, though Loki mostly worked with their mother’s foundation, as well as working in the Stark Studios division of S.I. Thor took a liking to working in the business side of the company, he had a natural love of science and it helped with the work their father was doing. Clint had taken the role of testing things, there was an official title, but Tony had deemed his job as Stark Industries’ Crash Test Dummy.
The blond got startled for a moment before his eyes came into awareness. “I apologize,” he said looking at the center holoscreen.
“Tony,” he was going to say that he was sorry, but before the words could leave him Tony collapsed into his arms, his breath wheezing out of him.
was created by comic book artist Joseph Rogers, Captain America was made as a gift towards his son who had been born within weeks of the first issue’s release. The character was named after Rogers’ son Steve, Rogers’ has said that he wanted his son to have someone to look up to, a hero who fought for everyone and stuck up for the little guy. Since its inception, Captain America, also known as Steve Rogers, has had over twenty volumes, and nearly 200 issues since its release. In the last ten years three movies have been released following the character’s journey as a man out of time in the new century. New characters have been introduced, including the ever-popular Spider-man, which has now started its own solo run. The Captain America serialization will end in May of 2020, Rogers states that he wants to give the hero a true and satisfying ending that would match his character and make his son proud.
“No loyalty with that one,” Tony said to Steve before walking over to Pepper and giving her a kiss on the cheek. “I’m going to go find the rest of them.”
“I’ll believe it when I see it, if this one last past your five-date rule, then I’ll consider it,” he said pulling his arm away. No one lasted past Bucky’s five date rule, because if they didn’t keep him interested after five dates then Bucky knew that it wasn’t worth the effort. “Until then there’s no way I’m listening to you talk about someone Buck.”
It was the first time, since they brought Riri home, that they were alone, just the two of them and Morgan. Clint had taken the kids to the old farm house, Cooper wanted to get somethings before he himself went off to college, but Steve had known that it was because he wanted some closure as well. They had survived, and while the Barton kids had lost their mother, they were still desperately trying to keep their father. The three of them had devised a plan to get their dad to let go of the past before he got himself killed, because out of all of them, Clint was the only one who had trouble letting go. It scared the kids, and it scared Tony, Steve tried his best to keep everyone together but somedays it was a little hard when one of them wouldn’t let go of what they had lost.
“It worked,” Tony said, just as Sam said “On your left.”
"So,” Hope said looking at the small group in front of her. “Who do we talk to about this? Who can help us crack this, because as brilliant as my father was, I don’t think I have the knowledge to figure this out.”
Steve smiled at that him. “You can steal mine if you want,” Steve told him before continuing. “But it’s not just that, it’s how you get excited about things, like your stories, or math, things that I usually hate but have learned to love, like Captain America, because you gave him a home in a world with friends and a family.”
“If you don’t get to sleep after this well it’s your own fault for it,” Bucky told him while pointing at the coffee, before sighing and digging into a plate of mac and cheese. “So, if you don’t mind me asking, but what’s a Stark doing at this school anyway?”
“What?” Bruce asked. “By who? Who told you that?
“Stay,” he said to Natasha before turning towards Steve, “I thought you liked Tony,” Bucky added, and Steve was a little confused about why he was saying that.
“Yeah you try and keep something from her,” he said with a smile. “Now everyone go wash up for dinner and make sure you drag the rest of the Avengers with you on your way back.”
His only morning part-timer showed up just before opening, which meant that Steve could fix up the shelves in peace while everyone else worked on their own things. If he ended up in the self-help section reading about flirting, well no one should really know.
“Not necessarily, we have a lot of people here hell bent on revenge, but we won’t know what to look for without a scouting mission,” Tony said looking around at the group of people that he had helped gather while traveling the universe.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well I can’t wait to read it when you’re done,” Tony told him, knowing that making at least one friend outside of Bucky and Steve was good for him.
So, yes part of this actually happened while I worked at Borders, but we weren't allowed to do anything, security was responsible for dealing with it. The amount of perverts that came into my store was astonishing and really scary.
“What did I tell you about pushing Bruce too far with your jokes?” Steve said, and Tony couldn’t help but want to push the man away again. They had lasted one day without a fight, he was still staring at this bearded version of Captain America and it felt like nothing had actually changed between them, like nothing was ever going to change, they would fight and fight over anything even when it wasn’t Tony’s fault.
“What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.”
“Tony stay on mission,” Steve called out.
“Buck, if you don’t stop, I won’t be held accountable for what Tony does to you in your sleep,” Steve said and Tony automatically thought about shaving his roommate’s hair off, so he guessed that Steve would be correct in his assumptions.
he wrote, groaning as he moved to pull out his other arm which was pinned under his chest.
“Ah so you’re Howard’s kid, I’ll make sure your parents won’t name you something weird, I promise.”
“We can’t get her back,” Clint said his face despondent never really looking any of them in the eye. It hurt because she had been his partner, so losing her after losing his wife was weighing heavily on his shoulders.
“Well he has a lot riding on his shoulders, yes he has brothers who also work at the company, but even they all knew that Tony was going to be the head of the company one day, there’s no way around that, he’s a genius, he’s sees the world differently than everyone.”
“It’s Tony,” Steve said smiling.
“Are you going to introduce me?” the other man said his eyes going from Tony to Steve, before Tony pulled himself away from Steve just to stand up next to the other man, which Steve instantly regretted letting go of Tony.9
“They’re my best friend’s sweaters, I steal them from Rhodey because it feels like home.”
“Yeah but it’s worth it,” Steve smiled through the worried look on his face. “Hulk feel free to smash if things along the way.”
They landed back on the Quantum platform, barely two seconds had passed before Tony rushed off to heave out whatever was left in his stomach, Steve following him towards the nearest trash bin, once again rubbing his hand up and down Tony’s back. He really hated time travel, and he was glad it was over because it meant that his stomach would stop heaving so much. He really couldn’t understand why it kept happening, he flew around in a suit of armor, but apparently this was the one thing that wasn’t going to let him have an easy time.
Steve nodded, but before he could say anything else, Tony saw whose office they were in, he was quiet for a moment, not wanting to say anything. “Tony,” Steve whispered not sure if the people on the other side of the window could hear them.
“You promise me you won’t die?” Scott said and Tony knew that this plan wasn’t one hundred percent full proof, hell it wasn’t idiot proof and Steve called him an idiot enough for him to know, but they were idiots together but that was a story to think about another day.
“Oh, look an audience,” Bruce said with a half cheery voice, the man had been making jokes lately and acting differently, but Steve realized that it’s what happened when someone was exposed to Tony for a long time. Bruce looked more relaxed around them, and Steve realized it was really because the man was more at peace than he had been in the past.
“Language,” Tony said before smiling at the other man.
The Hulk sat down for a minute as Steve explained to him what he needed to do, because even though they had told Bruce they always had to explain it to the Hulk as well. The mission was important, more important than anything they had ever done, but Bruce had used the last five years having others teach the Hulk, the big guy liked audio books and glass figurines, he also had his own place in New Asgard apart from Bruce’s place. It was interesting to know just how much the Hulk had evolved over the years, even when he hadn’t seen it all himself.
He didn’t know if it was a good idea, because maybe Steve had gone to that party with Bucky, or maybe Steve didn’t really like him. But he decided to try anyway, and sent Steve a message, asking him if he could still pick him up, he had thought it was stupid to even send it in the first place, but Steve quickly replied sending a message back with a smiley face, and then not even five minutes later he was standing in front of Tony breathless and smiling.
“From the tesseract,” Rhodey said causing both Steve and Tony to look at him. “I read up on your first battle together, and when I asked her while you two were having your little fight, she told me about an explosion from a battle and a blue light.”
Please tell me if any of this makes sense? Also... what do you think of me introducing America into the story? Because I actually have this weird head canon, that will probably make its way into the story, but it involves another character that already exists in the story universe and America. But you'll find out about it later on don't worry. Hopefully, I won't be doing the chapters like this anymore, who knows.
“It’ll just take some time,” Tony said with a smile.
“Oh, hello,” Bruce said holding his hand out. “It’s good to meet you, Thor’s been telling me about some of your projects at school, especially the miniaturized arc reactor project that you’ve started.”
Tony looked around the room and knew it was the truth, hell they had just gone into the past and messed with the timelines, so for those people, their present day would be something different from what they were living. Nothing would have been the same regardless. Maybe Natasha would be alive, maybe Steve would have been the one to die, maybe Tony would have never gotten the reactor removed. Infinite possibilities, he hoped that they didn’t suffer the same fate as the rest of them did.
Riri, shared Tony’s love for technology and had secretly, well she thought it had been a secret, began to build Iron Heart. It was her own armor and while Tony was scared of her using it, he wasn’t going to stop her from creating it, but he was going to make sure that it was safe for her to use. Kamala, had been a surprise, she had developed powers and no one understood why it had happened, neither did she, but they worked on making sure that she was alright, Bruce stopped by to check on them and collected samples from her and Miles to make sure that nothing was going to be detrimental to their futures. So, since Riri had her armor, Tony worked on stuff for Miles and Kamala as well, because Tony wanted them all to be safe. Miles and Steve giving him designs for Miles’ suit, and then having Miles paint on the material before. Tony put KAREN into the suit, so that she would have someone to talk to. He wanted someone to have Peter’s legacy with them, and she was a part of Peter as much as FRIDAY and JARVIS had been a part of his.
“I like you too Tony,” he said to him, and Tony started crying, he wasn’t sure why, it could have been the stress from his everyday life, or everything that had happened recently. “Don’t cry Shellhead.”
It took them most of the morning to get to the base, Camp Leigh was the beginning and the end of SHIELD, where everything started and where Steve learned the truth about what had happened. They had talked about the whole ordeal, it had taken Tony a long time to learn to forgive him for not saying anything sooner, but now it didn’t matter. They had their life together, their family.
There was a moment when Steve had handed him the sketchbook, where Tony wasn’t sure how to feel, he knew that Steve was an art major, he knew that Steve was the inspiration for his father when it came to Captain America. But there was also the fact that he had never seen anything that Steve had drawn up until now, with the exception of the Captain America and Iron Man drawing he had given Tony the week before.... before the whole misunderstanding. He was scared of how Steve saw him, it felt too intimate in so many ways, but he didn’t know if Steve saw him in a way that Tony would hate.
“Oh, I guess I misread somethings,” she said, looking down at her hands while twisting one of the rings on her finger.
Steve took Tony’s hand in his and stood there for a moment looking right into Tony’s eyes, “If no one has ever said that to you, then they don’t know what they were missing, and I’m glad that I’m the one who got the chance to say it.”
“What’s her name?”
“So,” Scott said looking at the group. “Does that mean that Back to the Future’s a bunch of bullshit?”
“And he feels like he’s failed them too.”
In Tony’s mind he knows that he should have connected the dots, but he hadn’t known Bruce’s last name, and he had been too worried about whether Steve had been in an accident to actually ask. They rushed up to Labor and Delivery to see Steve pacing back and forth in his tux, which Tony thought was sexy, but he couldn’t say that, not with everything that was happening, but he’d save the comment for later.
“Okay.... cool... cool... cool,” Tony answered, feeling a little weird about the whole thing, he only ever interacted with people online, Steve is the first person to tell him something like that in person.
“I can’t,” Tony said kissing Steve’s hand. “I have three kids to ground, and a husband to climb like a tree when this is all done.”
“Correct,” Shuri said as she looked through all of the stones on display.
“Ma, I’m going to camp in the backyard near the pit, I want to bring someone over to meet you, but I also want to do something fun together, so I figured two birds and all.”
“He told me once,” she said to him, her eyes never leaving him. “When he was too tired from school work, and too drunk to function. He probably wouldn’t tell you otherwise, but I thought that you might want to know.”
Thor was looking at the hammer the whole time, not paying attention to the axe that would have severed his hand. “I knew it,” Thor calls out with a smile on his face, as Steve sends the hammer flying at Thanos, before it hits the Titan on the head. Thor was smiling at him, as the hammer came flying back, the power greater than anything Steve’s ever held, but if it saves his friend, if it saves them all, he was going to use it. Thanos had gotten up and kicked Thor back to the ground before charging at Steve, so Steve thinks about what he could do.
“We didn’t do anything,” he said in his own defense. “I was packing snacks, so I could go talk to Tony, because I know he’s really busy with his finals, mine are a cake walk compared to the ones he has. I just wanted to see him work, maybe draw a little, I’ve never had a moving subject, well not one like Tony, and I’ve been wanting to draw him for weeks.”
They all smiled at him, as if they had won a battle, in reality it was just the beginning because they knew Tony’s stubborn streak when it came to their protection. America and Lila walked off holding hands, while Kamala and Miles jumped for joy at winning this small battle.
“Trust me Steve they know, and if they don’t well it doesn’t really matter, all that matters is you and me know,” Tony said before walking out of his room and seeing someone in a dark corner, it didn’t take long for Tony to realize that it was Ty, he was talking to someone in the dorm, but he ignored the guy and walked to Steve’s car before Ty could stop them and ruin their night.
It had been a suicide mission, it had been a ray of hope in all of the darkness, the chance to get everything back to the way it should be. Except now Steve hated the outcome, he hated Thanos, and if he had had the chance he would have taken the titan’s head himself instead of letting Thor do it. The thought that the mad man had destroyed the stones after using them to get his paradise, after taking away half of all living beings in the universe. He wasn’t sure what it should mean, what it could mean other than the fact that they no longer had hope for their own future. Vision was still in the cradle as far as they knew, they hadn’t heard otherwise from Tony on the way back. Everyone in the ship was morose in one way or another, none of them talking, Thor had left the ship twice before returning, Nat stayed quiet, and Steve had excused himself to throw up.
It was really hard to stop himself from snorting out loud at Scott’s comment, especially since now he started thinking about having a pair of sweatpants made for Steve that had the words America’s Ass printed on the back.
So, it wasn’t a surprise that the one day that Tony had gone with Steve to one of his meetings, that the two of them would end up coming back with another kid. Though finding him was something that was evitable in so many ways. He was the youngest kid in Steve’s therapy group, but for the whole meeting he had stayed quiet, until Steve started talking about being from Brooklyn and what it felt like to see how much it had changed since his deep freeze.
“Okay, let leave Tony alone before he spills all of our secrets,” Bruce said before dragging Rhodey out of the workshop.
“You know what kills me is that you’re angry at me for something that wasn’t my fault, that for some reason if I defended myself against what had happened you wouldn’t have listened to me,” he said, his ribs hurting as his breath left him. “Even with what happened with Thanos, I saw it coming, I saw that god damned mothership on the other side of the wormhole, I saw it in the vision that Wanda had given me, I wanted us to stay together, but no you had your own agenda.”
“Will you guys be here all night?” Peter asked, while Harley rolled his eyes.
“Okay, tell dad I said hi, and that I’ll be home this weekend,” Miles said with a smile before dragging America away. Steve knew that Miles usually spent his free time tagging the city, every once and a while working on a mural somewhere, and while Steve didn’t encourage defacement of property, he loved seeing what his son left behind for him.
“Okay,” Tony said his voice muffled into the pillow, all of a sudden he was feeling a little less alone. He rolled over until Rhodey fell on the floor and he was hanging off the side of the couch holding onto the side with everything he had. “When did you get back?”
“You don’t even know what I need help with, for all you know it could be the most mundane topic in the world.”
“Well you’re right about the fixer upper, but it’ll do for now… as long as you don’t mind me putting my own touch to the place.”
“I was ten when I found this place, and I kept coming in here and buying things, it’s weird and I could probably tell you a million things, but let's just say that she treated me kinder than most people, I was the youngest kid in my class, it’s the whole genius thing, but she just treated me like a kid who liked to read.”
“I guess that’s where we’re going isn’t it?”
“What is it?” he asked as he put it to his lips, and drank the still hot beverage. The flavor exploding in his mouth, it tasted like caramel ice cream, which threw him since it was hot and not cold.
“Plus, the twins on the way,” Steve said, his parents weren’t old, but they worked harder for their family than anyone Steve has ever known.
“That’s true, they have spent the most amount of time together outside of her relationship with Rocket. I know that what she has with Valkyrie isn’t new, but I don’t want to worry her right now especially since they’re all worried about Thor.”
“Oh, well your dad cleaned it all up, it’s in the mud room, because it was getting in the way, especially since he’s sad that his den is being turned into a nursey, something about having too many kids.”
Steve had stayed in the hospital for five hours as the medics put his legs in casts, taped up his ribs and made sure that the concussion that JARVIS had alerted Tony to wasn’t too life threatening. But Steve was an over achiever on that, the damn thing had healed in two hours, stupid super soldier serum, well it wasn’t stupid, but Tony was just angry at Steve. The doctors told them that Steve had to keep his legs elevated for at least the first day as the fractures set and the healing starts. Tony was sure that Steve would crawl out of his skin if he had to sit still for two seconds let along an entire day. The casts would be removed at the end of the week, and honestly Tony was glad for that super soldier serum because it meant that he wouldn’t have to see Steve get all antsy because he had been stuck at home.
“She reminds me of my mother,” Shuri said smiling before a sad look crossed her face.
“You kept it,” Tony said looking at the bill and then at Steve, “You could have used it to eat or something.”
“All right, you’re up, little buddy,” Tony said as he watched the briefcase that was holding the Tesseract. “There’s our stone.”
“I’ve wanted to do that for a very long time,” Steve told him, not wanting to have Tony question his reasoning. “I’ve wanted to do that since the first day I met you, even though I didn’t know why until this moment.”
“Yeah, that was just a happy accident,” one that had been born from his fanfiction, but that was something that he was going to never mention to anyone in the science community. “I’ve been working on it for a little while, but when it’s done it could revolutionize the energy industry, get us out of oil and coal and into more sustainable forms of energy, one that won’t ruin the planet.”
“Yeah and,” Steve said, and he knew that the guy was up to something. “Don’t worry, I planned for everything.”
He couldn’t help but sigh, he was sure that his ribs were their bruised or broken, but since had hadn’t spewed out blood they were most likely just bruised. “We had it, the plan had worked, but the Hulk, not ours of course, came barreling through one of the side doors just as I picked up the case, and well threw me against one of the reception counters.”
“Noted,” Scott said, and Tony threw a blueberry at him.
Just as she was leaving, he heard her stop to talk to someone, Tony brushed it off thinking that it was just Jarvis and decided to at least try and get comfortable enough to rest. He knew the power of his own mother and he wasn’t going to go against her, he had tried once, and it cost him dearly because the woman locked him out of his workshop when he had been ten and told him that if he was going to win a science fair he would have to do it with the things already in the house. It had taken him more that a month to create something that would had normally taken him two days, but he had won the damn prize anyway.
Tony lit up the first hologram with the image of the stones that he had seen when he had first met the wizards. “Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six infinity stones.”
“Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever,” he said as a way to move away from thinking about his mother’s death. As Bruce makes sure that he stays seated. “I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence,” Thor finished but Bruce just stayed put, making sure that the god would be alright.
Steve on the other hand was oblivious to everything that had happened, the party had started the same way they always do, Sam hounding him about Sharon, because for some reason Sam couldn’t gather up the courage to ask her out, even after all of this time. Especially since everyone knew that she had a major crush on Steve, even though he had told her that he wasn’t interested the year before. He wondered if Tony would show up, mainly because he hadn’t heard from the genius at all, but he was certain that Tony was engrossed in some project somewhere on campus. He had looked up one of Tony’s classes and noticed that it was a master’s level class, so he knew that Tony was in classes that were more advanced than Steve’s were. So, the coursework was a lot more rigorous, it had made him wonder whether he would ever see one of Tony’s inventions up close and personal.
Tony hadn’t ever really thought of that, but what child thinks of their parents in that way either, they’re just there for you, they protect you, they work and annoy, he guess that in the end all of that hard work they’ve done over the years was to protect him and his siblings, but also to keep them safe. After Tony had been kidnapped, his parents had just fussed over him, his father paid more attention to him, even when he was critiquing his work, but he hadn’t thought about that being his father’s way of showing love.
“Funny Scott, real funny,” Tony said but just turned to Steve, ignoring the incredible shrinking man behind him. “Okay what now?”
“It’s okay Steve, just go take care of him,” she said with a soft smile on her face, she knew that he was worried, not just about the store but about Tony. It was nice to work with friends who knew a person so well that they didn’t have to say much, all they had to do was give you a look and some words of encouragement and that was all.
“I’m being careful,” Bruce said, but they all watched to see if there was a hint of green in his eyes, but there wasn’t. Bruce was very proud of the fact that him and the Hulk had learned to coexist with one another, and it showed more and more.
“What the fuck,” Bucky said and Steve forgetting that he was on the edge of the bed, fell off the side and onto the floor.
“It’s the truth, you may not have seen that change, but all you have to do is ask your brother,” she steered him towards the doors that led to the waiting rooms where their family and friends waited. He hadn’t seen Steve yet, but he knew that his boyfriend was a nervous wreck, hell he wasn’t even sure if Steve had arrived yet. “Your father smiles whenever you do something spectacular, he brags about it too, it only looks like he’s being hard on you because he wants to encourage your curiosity.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“The relationship development between the two of them is incredible, and it would be groundbreaking if we ran it, but can you really take on something like this, I mean you still have a year and a half left.”
“Yeah just like that,” Steve said with a fierce determination that Tony knew so well from the years that they worked together.
“Yeah but, I guess it has more to do with the fact that even with his allies around him, Captain America always felt... I don’t know if lonely is the right word. It was like something was missing.”
“Thor, you’ve lost a lot in the last few years,” Tony said next, “We’ve all lost a lot, but we’re here for you.”
“Ah, I remember that day, I volunteered to help the town after that, it was why I was at our West Coast office for half the year,” Thor said looking at Bruce with hearts in his eyes. “That was before I learned that Bruce was actually from New York as well but studying at Culver University.”
“Perfectly not confusing love,” Scott answered with a smile, but they could all see the worry in his eyes.
Almost as if they had summoned their friends, Tony saw Scott walk out of the building holding some tacos in his hand. “I guess it’s lunch time,” Tony said and Steve nodded. Before either could say another word the Benatar landed on the front lawn near where Lang was sitting, Tony snorted when the stuff inside the taco fell out.
“Good,” Steve said before going back to work, giving Tony a wink before helping the next customer.
Tony’s first few weeks of school are more or less him hiding in the robotics lab from Natasha, or writing in the library, usually fueled by whatever snacks he had hidden away in his room and all the coffee he could get. On the nights he did get some sleep, he would usually get woken up by Bucky coming in from work, and it would take him hours before he was passed out in the robotics lab or wherever he could find, or a hiding place he had found.
The words hung in the air, a reminder of what he couldn’t stop but he also knew that this group of people, if they tried hard enough, they would help move the world forward. They just had to, because Steve couldn’t risk failing his family again.
If there was one thing that Steve was going to hate about this mission it was the fact that he couldn’t stop the Hydra agents from taking the scepter to Sokovia, to stop the experimentation that would happen with it. He wouldn’t be able to stop SHIELD from crumbling the way it did, because if they changed anything in this timeline who knows what would happen to these Avengers. The only thing he could do was act as one of them, just to get the stone, because they needed it, and hopefully they would be able to fix any damage they’ve made afterwards.
“Hey man,” Sam said before getting up. “I didn’t think that you would ever leave that room of yours.”
“J, blackout mode for the room, no one comes in or out until we’re finished,” Tony said as he ran his hand up Steve’s leg.
“Have a good weekend Mr. Stark.”
“And I want you all to be safe,” he said to them his voice a little quiet. “I don’t know what I would do if I lost you all, and we don’t know what’s going to happen, so for now just stay with your Aunt Pepper,” they were quiet, it probably had something to do with how raw everything felt, he rarely showed sadness towards them, they had had enough of it over the last few years. “If we need you, if we’re desperate, FRIDAY will call you.”
“Yeah, I know.”
“It’s... stop it, just let me,” he said tearing up. “Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something great.”
“Um pessing charges,” Tony said, and Steve knew that it was more against the pervert that had been in the store and not Steve, but it still scared him a little to hear that.
By the time he had finished with everything, well enough to make Pepper happy at least, nearly two days had passed, and Steve was already out of his casts. Luckily for Tony, Steve was still obligated to be on bedrest for one more day. There was also the matter of the pillow Steve had been using, because while it had been specially ordered, it was a part of his secret toy chest, and had been modified before it was put into his bedroom. Yes, it’s a sex pillow, but the others didn’t need to know this, they all thought that it was just for Steve’s legs, and while it was good for that, Tony had put special restraints in them. It was probably a gross misused of the alloy he used on the suits lately, but since he reinforced the restraints to Steve’s modifications well… he was planning on having his way with his boyfriend at one point.
“Janet Van Dyne, or Jan,” she said with a smile, the name sounded familiar to him, which meant that he’s heard it before. “I grew up with Tony and Natasha, we’ve known each other for years.”
“Yeah except when he wiped half of everything, he created an unbalanced universe instead of a balanced one,” Carol said looking at them all, it made Tony wonder just how long he had been in that bed because she wasn’t wearing that red, blue and gold outfit that he had first seen her in.
Steve didn’t say anything more, they had kept track of Tony in the time that the team had been separated, mostly just Steve keeping track, but he guessed that Natasha had as well. She used to tell him that they were a family, and even if they were in a rough place, they would find their way back to one another. Steve just wished they had done so faster, that he hadn’t been stubborn about it, that he would have just sent Tony a message before the first attack had happened. He was sure that Tony would have never opened it, but he just wanted to say something, anything.
“No this is on both of us, I shouldn’t have run, I was just a little insecure about whatever it was that we were, I had to talk myself into going to that party in the first place, I went into it waiting for you to tell me that that night was all a dream, that you didn’t really want to be with me.”
Tony nodded, before getting up and walking out of the room towards the bathroom, he needed a moment, and this was the only way that he was going to get it. He needed to think about this clearly, he wasn’t sure that anything had happened, but it had, it wasn’t a dream at all, and as excited as he was, he was also scared. He couldn’t risk getting in between Bucky and Steve, it would harm Natasha’s relationship, and that was something that he wasn’t willing to risk. They all deserved happiness, even if Tony would have to give his up in the end.
“Don’t tell anyone, I don’t want Tony to worry right now,” he told her as he heard Rocket yell out something and Tony’s voice started arguing with the raccoon. “Go find her and bring her to the lab, we’ll have Tony talk to her, because if there’s someone who would notice it would be him.”
“Stay out of my head Nat,” he said even though the smirk on his face wasn’t going away anytime soon. “And get out of my apartment, you have your own for a reason.”
He hadn’t meant to get snappy with Steve, really, it was just that when you’re trying keep yourself from falling for someone, well they pop up everywhere. Sighing to himself Tony took his stuff back to his room, grabbed a smoothie from the fridge and a granola bar and started working on the chapter he had been working on the night before. Choosing to ignore his phone so that Nat wouldn’t track him down for the day, she had been trying to get him to socialize more, but he just wanted to work on his things and nothing more. Even with the guilt of being a dick to Steve gnawing at him, he just wanted to wallow for a little while.
Once he was on the ground, he saw Barnes standing over Steve, trying to get a piece of glass that had fallen on top of Steve. Again, Manhattan and those stupid glass buildings, and yes, he knew that the tower was mostly made of glass but that wasn’t the point. Without asking if Barnes needed help, Tony just grabbed on side of the glass and flung it against the wall of the building.
It takes five years, and four kids before they find themselves in a truly happy place.
“My scholarship is dependent on me living on campus all four years,” Bucky told him as he pulled his hair into a bun, this was something else that had happened in the time since their break up, Bucky grew out his hair, which was weird in so many ways but it also made Steve realize just how different they really were.
“I know for a fact that they were there...” Tony stopped looking at no one but Steve, ignoring Scott in the process.
“Tony,” Steve said but all he could do was glare at his husband.
“Yes, she did, she also talked to Sharon after I rushed off, and then she talked to Sam, and in the end she knew that it was all just one big misunderstanding.”
“You’ve got that doofy grin on your face,” Sam said as Steve walked into the house. “You only get like that when you like someone, or when you get a really good grade, and since we already got our midterm grades.”
“I love you too,” Tony said, his voice barely a whisper, but it was everything that Steve had ever wanted to hear. At age twenty he was sure that he had found his soulmate, and yes, he could be thinking about this whole relationship a little too quickly, but with Tony he was sure that in any universe they were meant to be with one another.
“Sorry,” he said to Steve who was rubbing his back as Bruce handed him a bottle of water he had gotten from an overturned hot dog cart.
“They were nice, they talked about Steve and how they had thought that Bucky had made a mistake giving up a nice boy like Steve,” she said, and Tony wasn’t sure what to think about this development. “But they were happy to meet me, apparently they think my hair is good luck.”
Tony was distracted the rest of the way to the hospital, all the while Steve was on the phone talking with Pepper. All he could think about was how nice Steve was, and what was he doing with him, he wasn’t good at relationships, he usually failed at them, but it was nice to actually have Steve there. He could just equate it to the fact that he was half out of it, because he really wanted to try with Steve, but at the same time he was in so much pain. Any adrenaline that had earlier had all but left him, and the pain was starting to set in and he hated it more than anything, but he had Steve’s hand in his so he would just bare it for now.
, Cap. I got no co-ordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada,” Tony said looking at him as he clutched his side before the cradle holding Vision sparked, sending out an electrical current, that was when he knew that he had made a mistake, he had fought against Tony for something that wasn’t the other man’s fault. He was guilty of so much it hurt him.
“You said that we had one shot. This,” he said pointing at the rubble around them. “this was our shot. We shot it. It’s shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or noting.”
“Best Christmas present EVER,” Tony said before grabbing Steve’s face and kissing him in front of everyone. He knew he was blushing, but it was worth it if it meant that Tony was happy with them being like this.
“You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me,” Thanos started, and of course the fucker was going to monologue, he was a villain, but it just pissed Tony off to have to hear him say anything at all. “I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.”
“Wow. 3000. That's crazy, who taught you that?”
When I first started writing this arc of the story, I didn't really know how I was going to do this part, originally I was just going to start from the beginning.... until the plot bunnies told me to get to this point.
“Color me surprised that Bruce was your brother, I should have noticed he looks like your dad,” Tony said before yawning once again. “My mom is very good at organizing things, especially her own children, so the moment she saw us with our phones... well at first she wasn’t very happy because she has this blanket rule against phones at any function, we usually have to leave them behind...
“That’s technically cheating Tony.”
“Yeah, I grew up in a big family, I was the smallest of them all, hell Peter would have outgrown me if it hadn’t been for that growth spurt, I had in High School.”
Sighing Tony stood up from where he was and pulled Steve along with him. They walked into the workshop and closed the door, sealing them inside so that the kids wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop on them.
“You think,” his mother called out. “You try carrying around two watermelons, and then squeezing them out of your body through a hole smaller than my fist, forget it, there’s no use in explaining this… anyway, where’s this boy?”
They watched as Hulk snapped his fingers, the gauntlet lighting up the room, Tony couldn’t help but watch as something that looked so harmless burned through the Hulk’s arm. They watched as the big guy slumps down and passes out, the gauntled sliding off and falling away as Hulk turned back into Bruce. Clint kicking it away from the man as they all walked over.
“Maybe that’s just what we all really need,” Tony hadn’t realized that healing themselves involved becoming a real family. “We all need a family, though it’ll be hard some days, I still don’t think I’m completely ready to be Iron Man again.”
“Wait,” Steve said looking the other man in the eye, “The account, on Instagram, it’s actually yours?”
“Stop. Just, stop...” Thor said pulling away slamming the bottle down on the table, “I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?”
He was half asleep in his writing class, he knew that he wouldn’t survive like this much longer, and he could have skipped today and gotten some sleep, but Professor Coulson was giving out their second assignment while also giving back their first. Tony was surprised to see an A on his paper but a B- on Ty’s. The other boy wasn’t mad at him, just smiling at the fact that he had gotten such a high grade. Tony did the first thing he could and hid his paper so that it wouldn’t be a reminder of who he was. His name had been plastered on the paper, but Tony always smudged it enough so that no one could read it. He knew that he was on borrowed time when it came to his name, the fact that he looked nothing like his pictures helped, but eventually people would notice. He’s amazed that his roommate had been the only one to realize that he’s the actual Tony Stark. Though he still couldn’t figure out how Natasha had stayed out of the spotlight when she still looked the same.
“A family you say,” she smiled at him. “I have a family as well, I wonder if you’ll meet them one day.”
“Aww... you’re trying to butter me up, aren’t you?”
“I need the case,” he heard Pierce say from the other side of the room.
Before Tony could say anything else, Miles landed next to them, pulling back his mask and looking at Peter, “I like the suit man,” Miles said with a smile.
weren’t there on that stupid planet galaxies away after some madman all but threw a moon at me and took everything away from me. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after-the-fact? We’re the Avengers? We’re the A-vengers?! Not the Pre-vengers? Right?”
“Listen the only way they’re going to be distracted enough for us to get that stone is for when they’re about to get it out of the building, we have this slight altercation with SHIELD over letting Thor have it while they’re all in the lobby, that’s the only time we’ll be able to get it. Especially if my other self is having a slight heart attack, which would be caused by the reactor, that had been in my chest at the time, having a slight malfunction.”
“Not the new girl, the other one, the one you’ve been mooning over for the last year,” Bucky said to Sam, frustrated about Sam’s inability to ask someone out.
“Not likely,” Carol answered looking over to where Rhodey was with a sadness in her eyes.
“Now now platypus, no hitting,” Tony said but Steve could hear the joy in his voice.
“Why,” he asked while trying to take a bite out of the food on the counter, before Steve hit his hand.
If he was surprised to hear this, he didn’t know it, he wasn’t sure what to say at all, his mind went back to whenever he accomplished something growing up, and when he showed his father, the man would berate him. Complements are something that are rare for him, but this was something beyond that, everyone called him crazy for majoring in writing when his genius levels and his love of mechanics could take him farther. But he honestly just wanted to write and invent, not be one of the faces of Stark Industries, so to have something like this all his own was an amazing achievement.
“No, I found it though.”
“No,” Bucky said and Steve knew that he was trying to save the conversation from going downhill. “It’s just that my friend over here shares his name, and people used to make fun of him for it.”
“You wouldn’t dare,” Rhodey said getting up as fast as possible to close the door. “You promised that you would never tell her.”
“But how are you friends with my grandmother outside of that,” Steve asked him and Tony should just tell the guy everything, because why have secrets at all. “I mean I understand the book club thing, she had a couple of them.”
“Hey,” Carol said as she walked over to where Steve was. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to talk to you and Tony about, but since he’s busy, do you think we could talk before we did whatever it is, we’re doing with this glove.”
He knew it wasn’t enough, he knew that he was just buying them all some time, because as strong as Steve was, he wasn’t stronger than Thanos.
“Is your picture up there?” Tony asked and Steve could see that he was itching to get up, Tony was never one to sit still for very long.
“He’s still got the stones,” Rhodey said looking around the room, “so...”
“That doesn’t sound mild,” Scott sounded worried from his end, and Tony knew it wasn’t mild at all but it was their only shot for his other self to let go of the case.
Nebula nodded at him, “I will,” was all she said. By the time this was all over, she would have her other family back, just like he would, everyone they cared about that they had lost would be back.
