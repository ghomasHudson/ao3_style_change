“You’re freaking out,” Cas said flatly as undid the buttons on Dean’s plaid shirt.
“Eurgh, Cas, really?”
“Fucksake. Please. Please.”
Dean shifted his hips, dragging his thigh along Cas’ hard cock. Cas moaned.
Cas growled in his ear.
“Are you?” Dean asked.
“Loving a Winchester,” Cas mused, possibly forgetting Dean could even hear him. “What a god awful idea.”
“Cas. You’re gonna give me an aneurysm.”
To Dean’s mortification Cas dropped down to straddle his waist and touched his hand to his face, removing the blood in a second.
Cas leant down over him, pushing down on Dean’s legs, bending him in half as he fucked him. Like a fucking whore. Pornstar. He knew. He just didn’t fucking care.
Cas looked at him like he’d finally lost it.
Cas grabbed Dean’s arse and began to fuck him on his cock.
“I didn’t mean to...”
Cas dropped to his knees and Dean groaned.
He felt lust burning through him, a hundred hands ripping off his clothes, kissing, biting, wanting, needing.
“I want every inch of you.” Cas told him as he continued down his shirt.
“God damn you.”
Sam went to throw Dean the keys but Dean shook his head.
Cas kissed him. Hard, on the lips, and shoved Dean back into the counter. Dean shuddered, his cock throbbed in his jeans against Cas’s hard thigh.
Dean kissed him lightly on the lips.
“Holy fuck I...” Dean was sure all the blood from his brain was drained. It was the only thing he could think of stopping it from working. He was dazed.
Cas met his eyes.
“Cas,” Dean panted. Trying through his desperate delirium to reason with him. “Why would I do this to myself?”
Dean sighed. He was chained to a pole in the middle of the room by his wrists and ankles. He’d already tried to break the pole several times, but it was proving stubbornly sturdy.
“What did Jack say?”  Cas said, still sounding vaguely amused.
Cas cried out as his wings sprang out into the room, sending the bedside lamp clattering. Dean stared at the white feathers, teetering on the edge of his orgasm.
“Do you love me?”
Cas nodded and got off him. Dean wished he’d never said anything.
“Would you mind telling me what’s so funny?”
“I liked that,” Cas said. “Did you like that?”
Cas let out a slow breath.
He walked straight past them and grabbed the duffle bag on the table.
“Ah Cas...” Dean mumbled. He felt the angel was taking him, consuming him, inside and out, and Dean was far too high on the feeling to freak out or whatever it was his brain was expecting him to do. Bring up walls. Defences.
Dean rolled his eyes.
“That’s fucking weird.”
Cas cracked open their beers.
“I’ve been around since the beginning of time.”
Cas was behind him with a flutter of wings. Dean was sure sparks, magic, was skittering between them as Cas pulled him back towards him.
“Food?”
“Fuck. Oh god. Cas I...”
“Mmm yeah that’s it,” Cas said.
Dean tried not to shudder. The power ebbing from Cas was electric.
Cas laughed.
“Dean, two runners!”
“Even?” he whispered in his ear.
“Stings a little.”
Cas slowly massaged his prostate and stroked his cock, till Dean was a whimpering mess in his arms.
“You know I’m not really male. I’m not really anything, if it makes you feel more comfortable.”
Dean squirmed, no longer having the luxury of lust and an impending orgasm to take the edge off the awkwardness of what had just happened. Cas as usual failed to realise he was invading the human’s personal space. Dean supposed after what they’d just done he couldn’t blame him for getting a bit confused.
“It scares me too, Cas, okay, it fucking terrifies me. Because I don’t know if I could stop you. If I had the chance. Cas... “ he sighed, pushing down the nerves in his stomach and moving closer. To this God on the brink of explosion.
“Do your worst.”
“Still saying you don’t feel anything?” Cas drawled.
“Oh god. That’s good,” Dean's voice was barely more than a whisper.
Sam shrugged, chucked him the keys, and got in the passenger side.
“I...”
“Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah,” Dean babbled.
Cas laughed.
He had imagined this. Of course he had. He just never imagined Cas would be leading like this. Would even know what he was doing. What he wanted.
They both cried out, loud. Dean shifted his hips, it was more intense, fuller like this. But he liked it better. He could see the open mouthed angel, and control just how he moved on his delicious cock.
Something snapped in Cas and Dean was flung back against the wall, Cas pushing him hard against it with his body. Cas kissed him hard and Dean let himself moan.
“You passed out. I left.”
“Yes. That’s it.”
Cas tilted his head and Dean’s heart skipped. That innocent face. Just for a second.
“Ecstasy,” Dean said eventually. “Ecstasy. Your face. Blinding white light. Then nothing.”
“I learnt that from you. He knows.”
“Okay.”
“Fuck that’s good.” Dean was close, he could feel it, he was sure the second the angel touched his cock the world would explode.
“Stop, stop I’m gonna come.”
“I can take it. Come on. Give me everything you’ve got.”
“Dean, angels can sense emotions, feelings, but hormones as well. It’s like another sense.”
They chased them out into the night, both ran in opposite directions.
He looked pointedly out the window. He knew the two angels in the car could apparently ‘feel’ his emotions. Even more reason to avoid eye contact.
Dean put his beer down on the coffee table.
“Yes!” Cas said, as if it was the most blindly obvious fact. “Not just the sex drive, the whole thing.”
“Yeah. You feel that. Just like I do.” Cas kissed him, pulled him up close and grabbed his ass.
Dean kissed him softly on the lips.
Cas looked up at him expectantly.
“I let the souls go. I’m sorry. I... All I ever wanted was to keep you safe.”
He stared into Cas’s eyes, his mad eyes, furious and frustrated. He tried not to shake. Tried not to knock Cas to the floor and snog him senseless.
“Don’t have to tell me how to have a conversation, I’m not you!” Dean huffed.
Cas’s eyes snapped open and he stared at Dean for a second before realizing where he was.
Dean tipped his head back again, offering his mouth to Cas as he fucked him. Cas kissed him again, open mouthed wet kisses that were destroying Dean almost as much as Cas’s slow strokes.
Dean whimpered. Shit. This was actually happening.
Dean nodded.
“Well,” Dean said, like he couldn’t feel Cas’s cock hard against the back of his thigh. Like it wasn’t making him want to just shove himself back on it, pain be damned, and finally be joined with the angel. “If you could not blow the world up, that would be swell.”
“I’m sorry. You are clearly very embarrassed. I will talk to him. Its just because his powers are so new to him, and so heightened, as an arch angel.”
Dean smirked and stood back. He popped the button on his jeans and let them drop to the floor.
“Thanks. You’re a great friend.”
“Oh, poor baby. Poor little Hunter.” He pumped Dean’s cock hard, and Dean yelped again, his toes curling, balls tightening. Then nothing.
“You okay?”
Wind rustled through the trees. An owl hooted. Dean heard a single crunch of leaves before the vamp knocked him flat on his back.
“I told you.”
“I think this is the most fun I’ve ever had. Shall we try faster?”
“No. You’re gonna feel it. Every god damn inch.”
“Please, Cas god please I need...”
“Yes?” Cas turned back, eyebrows raised.
“Dean Winchester. Get your trousers off.”
Cas moved slowly, and on his fourth stroke Dean’s whole body tensed again, trying desperately to come.
“I still don’t understand...this.” Cas looked between them. “It’s not normal for angels, it makes me worry something might be wrong.”
“And you...think I did something on purpose to give you a sex drive?”
“Oh fuck. Cas that feels good. How did a nice angel like you learn to do something like this?”
Dean rolled his eyes.
“Oh, oh shit Dean I like that. Ohhh yess... “
Cas nodded matter-of-factly and pulled Dean back into his lap. He wrapped his hand round Dean’s cock and Dean shuddered. At Cas’ large hand on his dick and Cas’s hard body behind him. His heat, even through his clothes. His breath in his ear as he slowly pumped his cock.
Dean tensed but Cas plunged his tongue in his mouth, kissing him hard, carrying on his slow onslaught with his hands. Dean whimpered and relaxed a little, letting Cas plunder his mouth.
Cas laughed loud.
Cas nodded behind him, his breath coming rapidly in Dean’s ear.
Cas pushed.
“Fuck.”
“Fuck. That’s. Cas.”
Jack shrugged.
“Say. Please.”
Cas wrapped a hand round Dean’s cock and his whole body jerked hard. He groaned at the inability to come as Cas pumped his cock hard.
“Why, do you want me to fuck you in it? Is that how you pictured it? My coat flapping around as I fuck you into the bed?”
Dean was now thoroughly confused.
“It’s just that we made love and bonded in a vortex and I fucked you in a wheat field?” Cas asked, his voice his usual monotone flat.
Cas pulled out and cleaned then both up with a swipe of his hand.
“Killing people is also horrible.”
Dean shook his head.
Cas abruptly pulled back, waving his hand, and Dean felt his inhibitions hit him like truck.
Cas rolled his eyes and kissed him back.
“Even psycho Cas? Yeah I do. Unfortunately.”
“Cas..?”
“Fuck. Cas. I think I’m gonna come,” he whimpered. His voice sounded quiet. Tiny. Wrecked.
“Fucking hell, you look obscene.”
“You afraid of me, Dean?”
Dean tipped his head back and rested it on Cas’ shoulder. The possessive look Cas was giving him made his dick even harder.
Cas wrapped his large hand round his hard cock.
“Cas. Cas. What the fuck is happening?”
Cas paused.
“What? You’re meant to say thank you?”
Dean felt the magic release and he gasped and dug his nails into Cas’ shoulders as he started to come.
“Fuck, Cas, just put it in me. I need it. Fuck.”
Cas responded by pulling his head back and sliding a slick finger inside him.
“You be gentle with those spade hands of yours.”
Dean glared at him again and pushed the coat off his shoulders. He pulled off Cas’s stupid tie and threw it to the side. He ripped Cas shirt open, throwing it, loose buttons and all, to the floor. Before Cas could do it himself Dean pulled off his own shirt and tossed it down on the pile.
Just brushing his fingers against the silicone got him hard. He laughed to himself. Yeah. Definitely one of those times. He gasped as he slid a slick finger inside himself and sought out that spot. He jerked as he found it.
“Woah.”
Cas rolled off him and pushed Dean onto his back. He kissed him slow and lazy before pulling away and sitting up. Dean pulled himself up, a feat considering his limbs seemed to have turned to jelly, and put his back against Cas’s chest. Cas put an arm around his shoulder.
Cas closed his mouth. They were quiet for a moment as Dean pulled himself round to sit on the edge of the bed. Cas stopped him and pushed him back down onto his back, then lay down on top of him, resting his elbows either side of Dean’s head.
“Nope.”
Cas pulled back.
“What’s the last thing you remember, before you woke up?” Cas asked.
“Hang on.” He pushed Cas back and tried not to groan at the loss of his cock.
“This is a lot.”
“You’re crazy.”
Cas laughed quietly.
Dean cried out in surprise, caught completely unawares. Cas laughed.
“Stand up.”
“You just weren’t expecting to enjoy it?” Dean was happily distracted by the question he’d always wondered in the back of his mind. If Cas even needed sex. Wanted sex.
Cas rolled his eyes and the cap of Dean’s beer flew across the room.
“So we’re bonded huh?” Dean asked as Cas pulled back.
“Holy every living fuck.” Dean heard himself say, somewhere far away.
Cas rolled his eyes.
Dean leant back against Cas and took a sip of the beer, sighing in appreciation.
“I’m driving.”
“You are my one weakness. You need to be removed.”
Castiel sipped on his beer, his eyes fixed on Dean.
“Should I take your temperature?” Cas drawled and Sam laughed.
Dean swore in annoyance.
“I think so.”
Cas kissed him again, sensing his nerves. Dean groaned at the lack of his dick and changed his mind. Deciding he’d bend himself into any position the angel wanted if he’d get inside him again.
Cas took Dean’s lower lip in his teeth and Dean tensed again.
He was down to the last drop of his beer, watching the old TV in the corner when Cas came back in.
“Don’t...” It was the weakest his voice had ever sounded.
“You want me to fuck you?” Cas asked.
Dean let his head drop back and gave Unhinged Cas a withering look.
“We need to talk about hormones. And sex.”
“Jack says that I am like a dog in heat.”
“Your hormones. They are… ugh.” He squirmed underneath Dean and took a deep breath. “Arousing.”
Dean tried not to whimper as he moved his knees apart.
“That! You look like a shrink, waiting for me to start talking.”
Dean rubbed his temples with his thumb and fore finger and looked up at Cas.
“Can you tell, personal physical attraction.”
“When you dragged me back from hell… “
“Keep lying to me Dean and I’ll keep you here until you tell me the truth, keep you on the edge, begging. I could do this forever.”
Dean stared at the book on the table and listened Cas moving around the kitchen. His mind was a blank. A horrified blank.
Dean closed his eyes in horror.
Dean nodded. Cas was panting behind him.
Dean wasn’t sure if he could. But he tried, and managed to stumble to his feet.
“Fuck. Cas. More. More.”
“He can’t have just disappeared.”
Dean was sure he felt the room shake as Cas came, pounding his pleasure out on his ass, opening his mind again to Dean as he fell over the edge.
Cas didn’t wait for a response. Just held tight to Dean’s hips and started fucking him hard and fast.
“So this, connection.” Dean gestured between him and Castiel. “Its real? Permanent?”
“You don’t feel right? With hundreds of souls inside you?”
Dean cried out, grabbing the back of the angel’s hair and shuddering as he came in Cas’s hand. Relief coursed through him and he shuddered again as Cas sucked on the end of his cock.
“Well, it is what it is. My point is...” he sighed and trailed off. “It’s embarrassing.”
“Well, Cas, that was one hell of a booty call.”
Cas grabbed the body and tossed it to the side.
“I’m... Starting to see why males are so obsessed with oral sex.”
“No. But it’s obvious to us. Do something about it. You wouldn’t want to listen to your parents have sex all day.” Jack nodded and smiled, apparently satisfied with the conversation, and left to go back to his room.
Dean gave him a shit eating grin.
Cas laughed then covered his mouth when he saw the look on Dean’s face.
“Can you tell who?” Dean blurted it out. He didn’t mean to. He knew exactly the direction this conversation was going to go in.
Dean shrieked, his balls tightening again and then nothing.
“Are you okay, Dean?” Sam paused and frowned at him.
“Liar.” Cas shook his head.
“Cas.” It happened again. Sliding through his lips.
Cas was already on his way up the stairs.
He leant down and kissed him.
Cas gasped as he pulled back, narrowing his eyes at Dean.
He moved his hands to the angel’s chest and moved faster, pushing himself back hard on the Cas’ cock.
Dean pushed him down to the floor and knelt in between his legs. He groaned at Cas’ hard, verging on purple cock.
Cas pushed and Dean moaned loud. It burnt like hell, but God, it felt good. He pushed his hips back hard and Cas cried out. Dean felt Cas’s balls on his thigh and groaned load.
“If you’ve got nothing to hide?”
Dean took an extra-large swig of his beer.
Cas laughed.
“Sorry.” Cas laughed and gasped as he pushed back into Dean again. “I’ve never...you are... Bliss.”
Cas ran his teeth down his neck.
“What are we doing?” Dean muttered.
“I...” Cas laughed under his breath. “I didn’t mean to do that. I think I’m losing control.”
“What you can feel me now?”
Dean sat staring at the table, torn between confusion and mortification.
“Please, Cas. You’re in there somewhere, I know you are. And you trust me.”
“Fuck. Cas.
Cas did. Dean gasped as his memory tore backwards, throwing him vivid images of riding the angel, all the way back to go damn earth. He snapped back to reality and found himself panting in Cas’ ear.
“Okay.”
Cas chuckled again.
Cas stilled for a moment, narrowing his eyes at Dean.
“I...” his fantasies about Castiel generally lasted about twenty second before he realised they were happening and he drowned them out with everything and anything he could mentally conjure up.
“Sounds like you’re already begging to me.” Cas was breathless behind him.
Cas chuckled.
“You okay?” he asked Dean.
“Oh not even close.” Cas pushed a third finger inside him and Dean yelped. “My poor hunter. Don’t usually torture you like this do they?”
Dean slid his lips down his cock and Cas groaned.
Cas looked at him solemnly.
“Don’t get dressed, Dean. I only need a short break.”
Dean looked up at the angel through the last aftershocks of his orgasm. Cas’ eyes shone bright white light and his mouth dropped open as he came, filling Dean as he did.
“Yes?”
“Dean, we need to talk.”
“With my dick?” Cas drawled.
Cas gave him a little smile and Dean felt something in him shift, despite his best efforts to stay annoyed at the whole situation.
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Dean threw back easily. Cas just rolled his eyes at him and took a swig of his beer.
He took and sheathed blade from the boot and slid it into pocket and picked up one of the stakes.
Dean went slack with relief as Cas moved faster, harder, his eyebrows knitting together as he pounded Dean into the bed.
He took a deep breath. It couldn’t be that difficult. He licked a stripe up Cas’s thick dick then sucked on the head, slowly sliding his lips down, trying not to think of it pushing inside him, inch by inch.
“Fuck! Cas! Yes!” he groaned as he completely failed to come.
Cas frowned, came back into the room and rested his hands on the top of the chair opposite Dean.
,” he muttered under his breath.
He gritted his teeth at an intruding memory of the angel’s face. Of the size of his fingers, that Dean definitely hadn’t noticed. No. He started thinking of how long it had been since he’d felt another’s touch on his cock, let alone the warmth of another’s mouth. A warm body against his own. He groaned and bucked his hips.
“Hi, Cas.”
“What we got?” Dean grabbed his jacket.
“Feel pretty good yourself.”
Dean rolled his eyes.
. He was going to take some getting used to.
“We need to work on your jokes.”
“Yeah. Fuck. I like that.”
Cas flicked his hips and Dean yelled, coming hard, the white light exploding from both their chests into the room. Cas groaned loud, his hips still bucking, fucking Dean as he came, pumping his cock to the very last tremor of his orgasm.
“Yeah same,” Dean agreed.
“No.” Cas said, his eyes still closed.
“Mhmm.” Dean mumbled, already half conscious, snuggling against the angel’s wings as he felt himself grow heavy.
Cas frowned.
“What?”
Cas bit down on his shoulder and eased out a breath.
He pushed the angel's coat off and ripped open his shirt. He bit his lip at the sight of the angel shirtless beneath him.
Dean jumped out the car, trying to flush the memory from his mind and focus. If he got killed doing something stupid cos all his blood was in his dick he would never forgive himself.
“Deeeannn,” he hissed. “You are just...”
Cas’s eyes were dark with lust when he opened them. Dean shuddered, he could feel Cas’ power bubbling below the surface, power he sometimes forgot was there behind the angels usually unassuming face.
Cas frowned at him.
Dean did it again and again till Cas was shaking underneath him. Dean realised that his own cock was hard again, pulled back and smirked up at Cas.
Dean nodded his head silently, hands spread flat against the wall. Castiel began to move. His hands gripped firmly on Dean’s hip bones.
Cas’ hard dick jutted against Dean’s jeans and he moaned.
“He’s gone.”
“I haven’t done anything to you, Cas.”
Dean blinked at him. No one had ever told him they loved him. Romantically. Not really. Not like they meant it. He never expected it to be thrown at him like this in the middle of an argument. By an Angel of the Lord.
“We need to get the gear and leave,” Sam said.
“Come for me, Dean.”
Dean groaned as the tip of Cas’s hot cock pushed against his arsehole.
He saw Cas throwing him over every stationary object in the bunker. Screaming in his ear and fucking him within an inch of his life. He felt Cas’ power flowing through him, the bunker, shaking him to his god damn core.
Cas took a deep breath and pushed on Dean’s prostate.
“What are you doing, Cas?”
“I’m fresh out of gasoline, let’s do it the old fashioned way,” Sam said.
Dean’s eyes flickered.
Dean sighed and leant up to kiss him. His heart fluttered, his stomach flipped, and Dean was sure the only reason he didn’t bolt out the room was Cas’s weight on top of him.
“I can fuck with whatever I like, Dean. Now get on top of me.”
“You’re a liar,” Cas said again. “You like me like this. This Cas. Look at you.” Cas dragged his eyes up and down him. “You’re practically trembling.”
“Wait. Let me look at you.” Cas circled him. Dean groaned.
“Yeah?”
“Uhuh. Let’s go.”
“What are you doing?”
Dean cleared his throat. His cheeks were burning red as he tilted his head back towards Cas.
He didn’t even know what he was asking for, but Cas gave it to him. Pushing harder, faster, deeper. Holding Dean still against the drawers with strength Dean forgot he had sometimes.
“Don’t do that,” Dean said.
Cas pulled away for a second and Dean was very aware of being watched.
“Is that all you remember?”
“To...?” Dean said.
Dean carefully lowered his legs.
“Woahh no, that sounds like one for your angel dad, not me.”
“No, I don’t.”
“Its not a spell you moron,” it burst out of Dean’s lips before he could stop it. “It’s just, us.”
“Oh, Dean.” Cas sighed, pushing his hand into Dean’s boxers, and wrapping it round his rock-hard cock.
“Cassss...” It floated through his lips of its own accord and he barely noticed. Or, he noticed and decided to ignore it.
“So, you can feel it, you can feel when we’re... “
Dean’s cheeks burnt. His dick throbbing with Cas’s every word. He’d felt empty since Cas had taken away his fingers.
“Yes, Cas, fuck yes please, whatever you want just...”
“You feel prickly,” Cas said.
and he realised as he bucked in the angels hand he couldn’t even remember the last time he’d got laid.
Dean couldn’t be bothered to argue.
Dean raised his eyebrows.
Dean felt helpless, completely at silent Cas’s mercy as he lay back in his lap with him slowly stroking his cock. It felt incredible. To give up control. And to someone so powerful and unreadable as Castiel. It felt reckless. He shuddered.
“I think I might be ready to admit I find you sexually attractive.”
“This is what I want. Ah. Dean. I want you every day of the week. I want you over ever piece of furniture in the bunker. I want...”
He ran through the woods with the angel at his heels, following the vamps crunching footsteps as he fled. They reached a clearing and the crunching stopped. Dean flashed his light around but found nothing.
Dean nodded.
“I never understood the human obsession with fucking till I met you.”
“I said I’m going to the kitchen, did you want a drink?”
“Do your worst.”
His thighs were burning. He didn’t give a damn. He wanted more. Needed more.
His whole body shook. He knew he was yelling hard enough for anyone in the bunker to hear.
“I am waiting for you to start talking.”
Dean nodded. He couldn’t bring himself to say it.
“Oh shit. Oh fuck Cas. You’re not even touching me I... “
“Cas...?” Dean frowned “Are you back?”
Dean’s heart was thudding in his chest so hard he thought his earlier comment might not have been far wrong.
“You can’t fuck with stuff like that.”
Dean yelped as Cas’s large hand wrapped round him cock, sending him reeling, coming hard. He cried out with Cas’s every thrust as he came inside him, dragging out his orgasm, sending jerks and judders through his body.
“I’m not...” Cas gave him a heavily frustrated sigh. “I’m just trying to keep you and everyone else safe.”
“Yeah, yeah, touch me, rough, come on…”
He pushed and Dean gasped. It felt thicker than he expected. Though he wondered what on earth he’d been expecting.
“Oh god, Cas. Cas. Cas.” It fell from his lip like a mantra as he stared up at the angel. Cas looked down on him intently, like he was a puzzle he was trying to work out.
“Now. Come on. Please. Don’t make me fucking beg.”
“Yep. Yep.” He nodded again.
Dean overcame his every instinct and leant in and kissed the angel.
“You feel...” Cas trailed off and opened his mind instead, letting Dean feel Cas’ pleasure as well as his own, his sheer need for Dean. His power.
Cas moved his hand across Dean’s chest and round to his back, sliding down towards his ass.
“Cassss...”
“Mmm,” Cas bit down and pulled on his ear lobe. “Desperate?”
Dean blinked. He was sitting at the table in the bunker staring blankly at an old book in front of him
He imagined the angel close, warm, moving with him, against him, in him. He imagined the angel’s sinfully full lips against his own, lips pulling at his teeth, eyes so serious.
Cas gave him a blank stare.
“With the walls and the denying, Dean, it’s just exhausting.”
“Does this come off for sex or is it sewn to your back?”
“Doesn’t feel wrong,” Dean mumbled, suddenly sleepy. “Feels nice. ‘sides. You’re not exactly like the other angels, are you?”
“I was!” Cas objected. “You took over. You must be in charge…” he gasped as Dean let himself drop particularly hard on his cock ‘…of everything.”
“You left me naked in a field?!”
trembling.”
“Yeah.”
Dean straddled Cas’ lap. The angel cleared his throat and shuffled under Dean, but didn’t say anything.
“You already are.”
“Dean?”
“This isn’t about me. Its about you.”
He clenched his jaw, stared out the window, and tried not to react. Cas changed tactic. Dean saw Cas inbetween his legs, hands on Dean’s bare thighs, looking up at him with his mouth open and those butter wouldn’t melt eyes.
Dean realised how naked he was and went to pull on his boxers.
“It’s okay. I won’t hurt you. I’d never hurt you,” Cas said in his low gentle voice.
“Not even gonna let me see how big it is?”
Dean’s body jerked again in anticipation. Maybe a little fear.
Cas curled his fingers and Dean yelped.
“Sorry I didn’t realize it would be that... Intense. I’ve never done it before.”
“Like a hedgehog.”
“Spread your legs. You’re too tight.”
He opened his mouth let Cas slide his tongue inside his mouth. He tilted back his head, putty in Cas’s arms, grinding his erection shamelessly against Cas’s thigh.
Dean breathed out slowly, then crawled over to the chair, kneeling in front of it and resting his arms on the seat.
Dean smacked his lips and looked up expectantly.
“You sure? You weren’t getting yourself ready for me?”
“Oh yeah. That’s just... “ he trailed off, holding Cas’ shoulders to get some leverage. “Oh
Cas’s lips twitched.
“He said we needed to have a talk because I am embarrassing him with my sex hormones.”
“Tell me what you’ve done to me.”
Dean jutted his chin out.
Cas pulled him down hard the rest of the way onto his cock and Dean squealed again.
“Fantasy?” Cas finished for him.
“Oh please. Your signature move is sacrificing yourself to stop the end of the world.”
“You can tell when I’m horny. Super.”
“I’ll ask you one more time. What have you done? What spell did you use?”
“Honestly, Dean. I have seen you face the end if the world, multiple time. This is what scares you? Don’t you trust me?”
“What do you mean?”
“Sorry,” Cas continued. “You just called and usually that means... “ he trailed off, clearly piecing together Dean’s naked state and hard cock. “That you are in trouble. You are not in trouble. I shall leave.”
Cas pressed his flat palm to Dean’s chest.
“I want to try something,” Dean said.
“I know,” Cas said.
“And I can’t begin to tell you how good that feels.”
“Cas!”
“Oh stop. Stop talking like that or I’m gonna come.”
Dean groaned. He was spread open, exposed, and begging. Not things Dean Winchester did easily. And Cas was making him wait.
“Well, I’m not usually riding angel dick.”
“Dean, are you okay?”
Dean groaned as Cas beheaded the vamp from behind and the blood sprayed across his face.
“Winchester. You won’t be able to walk by the time I’m done with you. And you’ll wish you never did this to me.”
Dean groaned as Cas slid a finger inside him. It felt weird, but familiar still, and as Cas stroked his cock with his other hand it started to feel damn near blissful.
Dean panted.
Then he was naked in the middle of a corn field with the imprint of a hand burnt into his shoulder.
“I do, that’s why I never mentioned it before. I thought it would make you uncomfortable.”
“Thanks.” Dean took a generous swig of the bottle. “That’s good beer, Cas.”
Cas brushed his nose up Dean’s neck, into his hair, nipped his neck with his teeth.
He handed Dean a cheeseburger and a beer that appeared out of nowhere.
He groaned as Cas fucked him relentlessly, and gasped as he started to come.
“Can I kiss you?”
“Fuck yes.”
He all but picked Dean up and bent him over the chest of draws.
“Okay?” Cas asked.
“What?!”
“Can you,” Dean gasped. “Do that thing again. Take away all the... “ Dean gestured to his head. “crap in my head that thinks this is wrong.”
“Yeah, yeah, okay...”
They were quiet again for a moment.
“Got to do something when the world’s not ending,” Dean smirked. He dived back down, wanting more of the angel’s cock in his mouth. It hit the back of his throat and Dean pushed, gagged and pushed again.
“Something is wrong.”
“Look my dad never had this talk with me I don’t know how this is meant to go. What your half human, I guess you have – “
“Thank you.”
Dean got another flash of Cas’ desire, his power. He gasped.
“Though now I’m wondering if I should start.”
“Hey.”
“I have nothing to hide from you. This is all of me,” Dean said.
Cas put his fingertip to Dean’s temple.
“Even like this?”
“Yeah, fine, just reading.”
Cas gave him a reproachful look. Dean ignored him.
“Fuck if you’re not the most gorgeous creature I’ve ever seen.” He ran his hand through Cas’s hair then impaled himself on the angel’s cock.
He gasped.
Cas didn’t believe him.
“I think we lost him.”
“Fuck,” Dean gasped.
“Let me?” Cas’s tone had a hint of amusement under the gravely arousal. “Dean, you are going to beg me to satisfy you.”
Dean groaned, opening his lips to Cas’s all too clever tongue. Dean wriggled round in Cas’s grip. Now he’d wrested with himself and decided this was happening he needed more of Cas.
Sam looked confused but nodded and got in the driver’s side. Jack was already sitting in the passenger seat.
“No its not.” Cas sighed again and waited for Dean to finish his burger.
“Aren’t you getting bored of having this conversation? Cos I am.”
He groaned as he felt Cas slide a slick finger inside him.
Cas allowed himself a smug smile.
“Its not like you, to deny yourself something like this.” He ran his teeth down Dean’s neck and Dean tried not to squeal. “How do you want it?” he purred in Dean’s ear.
“Cas,” he whimpered. “Cas.”
Dean froze.
“You aren’t usually uptight about sex.”
“Fuck off.”
Dean was speechless.
“Yeah?” Cas asked. “Is the pressure correct?”
Dean turned round, dazed, and stared at the angel lying in his bed. Fully clothed, red faced, sweaty, fly undone, hair a shagged mess. He looked exquisite.
Cas considered then shrugged.
“Ohhh...” Dean’s mouth dropped open. “Oh I like that.”
Cas smiled at his vacant expression and went to the kitchen.
Cas slid the butt plug out and Dean gasped. Cas pushed two fingers back inside him.
Cas’ breath hitched again.
Cas didn’t give him time to reply, taking the head of Dean’s cock in his mouth and sliding his mouth down.
Dean laughed in spite of himself.
“I just...” Cas started and frowned. “I could feel that you wanted it, for so long and...”
Dean was struggling to have this conversation with Castiel’s face hovering inches from his own. His naked body heavy on top of his. Dean’s brain was revving up for a full blown freak out, he could feel it.
“Shit. You sure this is safe? You’re like an atomic bomb, right?”
He glanced at Sam but he just shrugged. There were eight all together. Dean hated doing it, despite what he told Jack. Staking vamps in their sleep never sat right with him. But he’d learned long ago that it was all part of the job.
“Yes. Come for me. I want to feel every second of it.”
“I am an angel Dean. This is just how we’re made. I’ve never known anything else.”
Cas frowned further.
Cas laughed.
“Why don’t you go first?” Dean asked in an argumentative tone.
“Dean, you and Cas go left, me and Jack go right.”
Dean blinked.
“Vampire coven. It’s just gone dark, figured the best time to strike.”
“No. I’d never hurt you,” Cas purred in his ear. “Are you ready to tell me yet?”
He went to launch himself at Cas but Cas held him at arm’s length by his shoulders.
“But you’re... An angel you don’t...”
“Okay.” Cas didn’t take the bait. “It was. Odd. I didn’t know quite what had happened. Or if you would remember it” he shrugged. “I didn’t think I should bring it up, when you didn’t say anything.”
He stared at the angel on top of him, feeling as dazed as the angel looked.
He slid a second finger inside him and curled it again.
Dean begged to differ as Cas deep throated his cock, letting Dean fuck the back of his throat, encasing Dean in tight hot velvet bliss. Dean’s hips jerked forward and he gasped a breath in, ready for the rush, ready to come down the cocky angel’s throat but...he frowned and opened his eyes. It didn’t happen.
Dean went to talk and shut his mouth again.
“You wanna sit in the front Cas?” Jack asked.
He felt tension skitter between them, or maybe Cas’ power. Something electric.
“God, I could have you right here.”
“Cos you already know.”
“Of course I do,” Cas’ voice was gentle and Dean felt his hand running through the back of his hair. “But I didn’t...I wouldn’t have known if I wasn’t an angel, and I didn’t want to invade your privacy.”
“Not a fan of foreplay?” Dean asked, he meant it to be a quip but his voice was hoarse in his throat.
“You sure?”
Dean closed his eyes.
“What’s plan. We burning the place down and stabbing then as they come out?” Dean asked.
“’s not tiny!” Dean objected.
Dead squeaked.
He clung onto some small hope that maybe it was just because Jack was an arch angel.
Dean landed in a pile of cushions that definitely hadn’t been there before. He took another swig of his beer. He wasn’t sure if he really was in a cheap motel room or if Cas had just made it that way to fit Dean’s usual environment.
Dean paused, staring at the angel,
“Infatuation, sexual attraction, we can smell that on you.”
“Oh fuck Cas. Oh… so good.”
Cas groaned around Dean’s dick and sucked harder. Dean was never one to back down from a competition. He moved his head faster, trying desperately to hold on and concentrate as Cas did the same to him. Cas’s muffled moans and the way he squirmed underneath him was destroying him. It was surpassing ever fantasy he’d ever denied having.
“Lose your train of thought?”
“You’d better. I already dragged you out of hell once and it exhausted me for weeks.”
Dean whimpered.
Dean’s whole body tensed again as Cas repeatedly slammed into his prostate.
“Oh that’s the most wonderful noise you’ve ever made. Do it again.”
He rocked his ass back and forth against the pillow, wanting more friction. Maybe it was going to be
“Dean…fuck ah…” Cas pushed slowly inside him and Dean gripped onto the edge of the chair.
“Legs up.”
Dean laughed.
Dean nodded. “Yeah. Beer, please.”
Cas put the hot tip of his cock to Dean’s asshole.
“Ah fuck Cas you feel good. So fucking good. I need. Damn. I...” he kissed Cas hard on the lips. Cas kissed him back, deep and consuming and Dean whimpered against his lips.
Cas stopped talking. He moved his other hand over Dean’s chest. He rolled one of Dean’s nipples in between his thumb and fore finger and Dean’s whole body jerked. Cas kissed him on the side of the neck.
Cas laughed low in his ear.
Sam gave Jack an amused smile.
“Go ahead.”
Cas bit down on his neck.
“I’ll get you pudding later. Look. Stand up.”
“Oh shit, Cas. I think I’m gonna let you do this.”
“Give yourself to me.”
“Well Dean, we can do this as many times as you need,” Cas said seriously then laughed.
Cas pushed on his prostate and Dean jerked. Cas smiled. Dean felt warmth from Cas’ fingers inside him, something
Cas closed his eyes.
“Fuck! Ah god yes there Cas there… fuck me… oh shit.”
“Making sure I don’t hurt you, and, increasing the sensitively on your prostate.”
Castiel’s mouth twitched.
Dean put his fingers up at them both and carried on reading.
. I’m telling the truth. I didn’t do this to us.”
“If you’re expecting me to call you ‘my angel’ you can get fucked.”
Something started to feel different. Cas’s dick was swelling inside him.
“You’re awfully heavy for an angel.”
“He said that to you?”
They got closer to the bunker and it became tighter again. He tried to get a hold of himself. Cas was his best friend. Why did he feel like he was going to be sick on his shoes?
Dean’s cheeks were flushed as he looked past Cas’ shoulder.
“Am I going to survive this?”
Cas tolerated him twisting round to face him, still stroking Dean’s cock as he ravaged Dean’s mouth.
“Fuck!” Dean’s hips jerked before he realized what he was meant to be doing.
Dean gritted his teeth and tried to keep perfectly still. Cas chuckled low in his ear and Dean shuddered.
“Holy crap. Cas you can’t...” he whimpered against Cas’s thigh. “Oh god. Son of a bitch. That’s so good.”
It was an order, not a question. Something snapped in Dean. He kissed him back, hard and desperate, letting go of the counter top to slide his hands under Cas’s coat and pull him impossibly closer.
Cas pushed the shirt off Dean’s shoulders and it dropped to the floor. He ran his fingers over the hand print he’d left what felt like a life time ago.
“I’m going to bed,” Sam said, yawning.
Oh fucking hell. Jack was right.
Cas moaned into his mouth and started rubbing Dean’s dick through his trousers.
“How sexually attracted you are to Cas.”
Cas moved his hand faster, fucking him with his fingers. Dean bucked his hips.
Dean bit his lip in anticipation as Cas pulled back his fingers and he moved behind him.
“Oh shit,” Dean’s head dropped against the wall. “Oh fuck. That’s...” he trailed off as Cas continued to slowly fuck him. Grazing his prostate with every stroke.
“Please don’t blow us both to bits.”
“Cas!” Dean yelled out as he started to come. “God. CAS.”
“You’re a Winchester. I knew you’d be fine. I didn’t want anyone to catch me.”
“No Dean stop talking.” Jack cut him off.
“You’d get tired. Puny human.” Cas teased him, walking him over to the wall and pushing him up against it, fucking him hard.
“Don’t swear!”
. Oh god you feel too good. I think I’m...”
“Eurgh.” Cas rolled his eyes and flung Dean across the room with a flicked of his wrist and stormed out the room.
“Did you...want something?”
Dean cried out again, feeling every second of Cas’ orgasm, every thrust, every twitch, as he came inside him. The lightbulb went, but the room flashed white, endless white before Cas heaved a breath in and the light faded, plunging them back into the dark. Cas flicked his fingers and the light bulb came back on.
“Hey!” Sam shouted.
“You’re awfully twitchy.” Cas had that amused smirk on his face again as he walked towards him and pinned him up against the door.
Dean laughed despite himself.
“Dean, I can’t begin to tell you how good you look right now.”
“Okay.” He put his hands up to Dean’s head and put his thumbs on his temples. “Ready?”
“On it.”
Cas failed to mask the look of amusement on his face.
“No.” Cas said seriously. “I always thought if it happened, we would be more closely bonded but I... Got carried away. I didn’t expect my body to react how it did.”
“And then on the 1,837,846
“Stop talking.”
“No. Not really.” Cas shrugged.
“Stop it.” Cas said.
“Forever.”
Dean groaned and kissed him, desperate for Cas’s tongue back in his mouth. Some part of him was sure that if he kissed him hard enough Cas would have to believe him.
“You feel all my desires, how I feel, who I... Lust for,” Dean pushed the words past his lips. “Let me feel what you feel.”
Dean sighed and sat back down.
Dean was face down on Cas’s thigh. A bead of his sweat dripped onto the motel room floor.
“No. You won’t come until I tell you to.”
“I need to be inside you.”
He would have been alarmed if it wasn’t giving him an extra buzz. Getting him close to a delicious orgasm.
Cas smiled.
“Would you like assistance?” Cas’ voice was gravelly.
The metal clang of the bunker doors slamming echoed through the room and they sprang apart. Dean didn’t realise Cas had even been holding him up till his feet hit the floor.
“mmm?”
“I. Its just. Private, you know.”
“If you’re about to apologise for the best shag of my life you’d better stop right there.”
“No, I mean, somethings wrong with you. You feel off.”
“Alright Yoda.” Dean rolled his eyes.
Cas was looking at him with those big imploring eyes. Cas stroked his thumb over the nape of Dean’s neck. Dean shivered.
Cas smirked at him.
“Good.” Cas pulled back and pumped Dean’s cock fast and rough.
Dean groaned and arched his hips up to meet Cas’ hand.
“You. Know?”
“Please, I could lie here and watch you pleasuring yourself on my dick all day.”
“There’s so much conflict in you.” Cas frowned at him.
“You feel hot,” Cas said “and incredible.”
“Mmm. You’re delicious, Winchester. Now it should be here, right?”
Cas looked at him blankly.
Oh no. Not for Cas. Cas wasn’t like anyone else. Cas saved him. Cas looked after him. Cas could handle all of him.
“You are not living up to your reputation.”
Cas rubbed his slick dick up and down Dean’s ass.
Cas abruptly picked him up and sat him on the edge of the table. He dropped to his knees and was sucking Dean’s cock before he’d managed to grab onto the table.
“And now all I can think of is fucking you until you scream.”
Cas shook his head.
“Don’t be nervous. I won’t hurt you.”
“Dean, I have wanted nothing else since I dragged you out of hell.”
Dean groaned in frustration as Cas picked him up and lay him flat on his back, shrugging off his shirt and kicking off his pants in the process.
“I’m jerking you off. I thought you’d be fairly...”
Dean gave him a half smile.
“Say please,” Cas purred in his ear.
The site of the angel after that had been alarming. But mostly he managed to put it down to nightmare coming back from hell nonsense. Mostly. Until the times he felt the angel was a part of himself. All the times they thought they’d lost him. All the times he’d nearly let him go.
“Jack certainly has a way with words. He’s just getting used to his powers, his senses....”
“-ou mean apart from the souls you ingested, and the fact that you’re planning on taking over the world?”
Cas frowned.
“It was hot. You were burning. You were screaming. I pulled you out. We were both burning. Then we were in the wheat field. And I left you.”
“Oh fuck you feel good,” Cas breathed in his ear.
Dean whimpered, his cheek pressed flat against the wooden draws. He felt Cas’ desire building, felt it as he pounded his ass harder, gripped his hips harder, slammed into his prostate again and again.
Dean moved his hips experimentally, gasping as he found and angle that felt like heaven.
“Look at me,” Cas said.
“I haven’t done anything,” Dean sighed. He raked his hands through the angel’s hair and held his head still, resting their foreheads together. “I swear.”
Dean cried out, groaning in pleasure.
They caught up with them by the car. Jack was covered in blood and looking extremely pleased with himself.
Dean put his hand up to his head.
“Your son...” Dean said.
Dean tried to resist, if only for a second.
Dean moaned against his lips.
Cas smirked at him.
“Come on Cas. You know me. I haven’t done this. This is God level stuff.”
“Of course I do,” Dean managed. “It’s just...a lot.”
Dean stared at him.
“All day, huh? We’ll see about that.”
Cas took both their cocks in his hand began to stroke the together.
“How would you like it?” Cas asked.
Dean stared at the spectacle, convinced he had never seen anything so beautiful in his life.
“Do you feel that?” Cas asked.
Dean’s cock throbbed. He knew he was going to regret it later.
“I don’t know.”
Cas looked like he was grating his teeth.
Cas’ expression was blank but his eyes were fixed on his. Dean couldn’t bring himself to talk. He nodded.
“I love you,” Cas told him and pulled back his fingers.
“More. Fuck. Fuck me.”
Cas sighed.
“Whatever I want?” Cas purred in his ear.
Cas sighed.
His heart beat twice as hard as he looked down at Cas, lying with his cheeks flushed and hair tousled, dark eyes and lips slightly open.
Dean nearly fell off the bed. He couldn’t gather his thoughts properly, to say anything to Cas who was now sitting behind him on the bed.
“Please. Please. Need to come,” he rasped.
Dean did and Cas lifted him up like he weighed nothing. He pushed back into Dean and Dean cried out against his lips, wrapping his legs round Cas’s waist. Cas bounced Dean on his cock, groaning in his ear and digging his nails into his waist.
“I... Don’t feel right.”
“Okay. Ohhh god. That feels good. Dean so so good. Oh.”
“I’m joking. That was a joke,” Cas said in monotone.
“Are you okay? Did I hurt you?”
“Look at me,” Dean said.
“I’ve never...”
“You don’t have to. I’ll know. Christ. I feel like I need to spend my life in a bucket of ice imagining Margaret Thatcher.”
“Why don’t you tell me?”
“You feel so good. Can’t wait to fuck you wide open.”
He groaned as the angel slid his tongue against his, holding him hard and deliberate against the wall. He let him go briefly then whirled him around, pushing Dean face first against the wall.
Dean stared.
“You okay?”
He groaned as Cas pushed into him all at once and started fucking him hard.
Dean was sitting in his room in his boxers with the door locked. It was good to get some peace and quiet. Some time to himself. The bunker wasn’t empty, but it was just Sam, and he was busy reading, and understood when Dean needed his alone time.
“I think...we should level the playing field.”
Hearing the angel swear made Dean’s hips jerk again.
Dean rolled his eyes and shoved him off.
“Dean that’s horrible!” Jack said.
Cas took hold of his hips and started to move, fucking him firm but slowly.
“Talk about a walk of shame,” Dean muttered to himself.
“Mmm?”
“So, remove me.” Dean looked Cas dead in the eyes.
“Got yours?” Dean asked.
Dean was melting. He was sure of it. His brain was at least. Melting into jelly. Cas was slowly stroking Dean’s cock at the same time, contributing to the brain jelly. Nothing had ever felt as good as this.
“Yes. Usually it is fairly obvious.” He paused. “Particularly with you.”
“No, Dean, please. Sit.”
Cas gestured between them.
“That it?”
Dean felt Cas share his thoughts with him against and whimpered. The desire pulsing through the angel. The sheer fucking need to have him. To bury his cock in his ass. The power inside him.
“Dean your soul it... It cried out for mine in the dark, from hell. I dragged you back, and it still called out for mine. I know humans need to bond physically, so I wanted that too... “
He relaxed back against Cas’s chest; his head tipped back on Cas’s shoulder.
Cas collapsed on top on him. Dean’s sweaty hands and knees slipped on the wooden floor and he ended up face down on the wood with Cas on top of him.
Cas raised his eyebrows.
Sam’s tone made Dean’s erection take a hike at least.
“Pudding?”
He blinked then frowned.
“Why?”
Cas just stared at him straight faced.
“Fuck me senseless.”
Dean laughed and looked up at him wide eyed.
He was fuming, still, and Dean tried not to let his wariness show on his face. That power that shook the blinds, made the beer bottles rattle where Dean had put them together on the table. Dean put his hand over them to silence them.
“Control freak,” Dean said with a blissful smile, “is the word you’re looking for.”
He pushed off his boxers took one of the toys out of his bottom drawer. It wasn’t anything dramatic, just a silicone butt plug, enough to give that extra buzz. That extra wave of pleasure.
“Oh, don’t act so surprised, Samantha, you called me,” said Crowley, who was indeed now standing between the group and the portal. He lifted his nose and sniffed. “Why does it smell like Big-Time Goddess in here?”
“Yes, but— but someone should really stay— to watch the bunker—”
“Because you went and got me hooked on it! Never was big into fantasy until you and Other you came along.”

She reached out to squeeze his hand.
“Oh?" The corner of her lips quirked. "An' why not?”
What is it
“There must be something left of it, since that demon intended to collect the monsters and return them there,” Cas noted.
Sam looked at him a moment longer. Then he faced forward again, turned the key in the ignition, and backed the car away from the curb.
Sam chuffed, smiling at her. He reached out and pulled her close, brushing her hair back from her face and saying low into her ear, “What are you dancing around, Bris?”
“Yeah. Great," said Dean, rocking back a bit on his heels.
"You don't? You didn't?"
She stared at him. “An’ how in the

He frowned.

He nearly collapsed to his knees, upright only by bracing his hand against the cold, tiled wall. “Please,
Dean rumbled with an exasperated sigh and let his eyes shut for a moment, as though that could keep the jarringly upbeat tune at bay.
Every pipe, every fluid line, every nut and bolt was being meticulously detailed, all while his little speaker valiantly tried to fill the cavernous garage with sound:
God.”
"Oh, I'm right sure you are," Bris said as she reached into her pocket.
His face fell. “You’re no fun.”

Again, I hope to be back soon, my dears, thank you so much for reading, it fills my heart with such joy just to watch that hit count rising and know that you're here. :)
One only had to find the right Scale.
Bris nodded along, “That does put some of the pieces together, yes.”
“What?” Sam looked between him and the speaker.
“—they’re like a siren in seal skin or something, but we’ll be finished with this hunt soon, alright?” Dean picked up a rifle and clipped it into a sling.
Sam watched, speechless as Michael stood just yards away from them. Stood there. In Dean’s body. Staring with Dean’s eyes, wearing Dean’s clothes—
Bris just smiled and sipped her drink.
this goes sideways—”
Cas’s face fell. He looked at the bodies and when he turned back to Dean he was filled with such raw devastation even Sam drew back.
minutes.”
They balled into shaking fists.
And Dean ached from it. It cut him deep that seeing Cas like this—simply happy—was shocking to him.
“Maybe someone took him?” Direl shrugged.
She spun back and pulled him down for a searing kiss.
Dean waited for Cas to turn towards the car before rolling his eyes. Freakin’ drama queen.
After the camera has explored this a bit, it returns to the front door. It opens, and we see elderly Cas come in. Another raucous cheer is raised, and Dean rushes to embrace him. Sam enters just a few minutes behind him.
“Just one guy who said he heard screams in the night,” Jody sighed. “Not much to go on. Not much of anything anywhere. I mean, that’s why I called you in the first place.”
Castiel’s hand tightened minutely in the angel’s jacket. “

got Jo’s attention. “You know my dad?”
Well. Hello friends.
“Shut up!” the woman shouted at Sandy. “What the hell are you doing here?” she repeated.
Sam’s stomach dropped, he hadn’t even thought to check. “I don’t—”
Dean shrugged.
Sam took a step forward, “Now hey, wait a minute, Rowena—”
“No, no, the hex bag, Cas!”
Cas moaned, loudly, gutterally, and keened
As they got in the car, Sam pulled out his own phone. He sent a text to Direl as they pulled out of the parking lot.
Then a foot stepped closer. “Do you need—?”
Dean coughed from the side. “Still here, guys.”
"Good. Now let's go, and remember, with these guys we have to be ready for
knew, and so he spurned Gabriel’s attempts at platitude and comfort. He shrank from Gabriel’s touch, both physical and angelic. Because if there was anything he deserved least right now, it was Harmony.
Dean chokes on his drink, spilling half of it down his shirt. “You want to— Me? Why?”
No! No, just— No!
Would you cut it out!

Bris was eyeing him, but he kept his gaze down, watching the water wash the raw meat from his hands. Their silence stretched on for too long again.

The carcass exploded.
They caught the looks on each other’s faces, and broke out laughing.
Cas cried out and doubled over, clutching at his abdomen. Dean’s hands scrambled to bring him back up.

Dean tensed at his bluntness.

As expected, they shouted back, with no small amount of malice,

yes.”
~*~*~
But even this option came with pitfalls to avoid. There was the chance that he could be perceived as “too forward,” or worse yet, misunderstood entirely. With years of miscommunication echoing in his mind, Cas knew he would need to be very clear with Dean, more so than ever before, and yet at the same time— somehow— not too clear.
Cas waited for a reaction. Dean narrowed his eyes, but didn't offer comment.
But just as Bris opened her mouth to speak up, a pained shout carried over the beach.
That seemed to give them pause. "Why, darlin'?"
Shit, he could really use some backup right now.

“Ah! Yes!” Charlie jumps up, taking note of the time.
“Not even sure the demons care about you at this point,” Sam said, “they had a perfect chance to get you back in Wilmot but they came after us instead.”
“This is my
With each step, his resentment slowly softened into frustration. He had told Dean. He had said clearly that the monsters wouldn't kill him. But Dean had leapt into the water only a moment after the grindylows had engaged him. Now, yes, he had frozen initially. Had found himself unable to react as the water closed over his head, as the sunlight faded, as he was dragged down, down… But the river was murky, Dean couldn't have seen his lapse. Dean didn't have the senses Cas did.
"We'll just need a lot of wood, I guess."
“What's a soul look like, Cas?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “I just said that, Dean.”
“Jesus, Cas, alright, I remember.”
“There was a spell, that you used to get into the Apocalypse World to rescue me and Mary and our friends.”
lives!”
“What?”
"Was part of the Plan!"
Dean let his head knock back against the wall. In his drunken haze he didn't even register the pain of it.
“Uh— Right,” Dean tried to smile back, however weakly.
" Sam turned back to Cas in the back seat, "now I just want to hear it more. C'mon, Cas, hand it up."
“That is the plan,” Sam answered.
But we had to—

is wholly unrelated to our...
Then, slowly, someone walked toward him, their feet crunching in the disturbed snow. They knelt beside him, careful and calm, and placed a gentle hand upon his back.
Ketch leapt from his seat, grabbing at the table behind him in his desperate big to get away,
boy, before I—”
“Well, I— Um— Well, it's more of a— a question,” Sam bumbled. “It's kind of— I-It's silly. Crazy.” His eyes shifted, looking anywhere but her, “I mean, I don’t want to be rude— o-or insulting—”
So what the fuck can we do?”
“Oi, wait— What—?” started Bris.
“Well if he’s not crazy then how else do you explain why my little brother is obsessed with a human he hasn’t even done the dirty with yet!?” Gabriel tossed his hands.
"What?" shot Sam.
“Cut the bullshit, Crowley, I know you didn’t have to do that.”
Bris made a small noise of disbelief. “But… But why?”
Rowena held up her hand at him.
Gabriel flinched back as if bitten.
Her heart dropped and she leapt off her stool, backing away from his rapid approach but seeing no clear path of escape. A hand went to her chest, pressing against her ribs. He shouldn't be here. She’d lost him at the canal—
“Wha— Well, a’ course, Sam!” She stepped up close to him and took his other hand as well. “A’course I’ll stop! I’m so sorry—! Have I been doin’ that all this time an’—?”
His stare continued, “You know how to do that?”
Crowley leered at him. “Mother’s right you know, you’re downright adorable, thinking I don’t already know. Don’t suppose you’d confirm it for me anyway?”
Sam squeezed his eyes shut. “Bris. I didn’t mean—”
“The two of you didn't go about this the easy way, ye burned hot and ye ran rough, an' now yer dealin' with the consequences a' that." They gave him another sly glance, "I can see why she likes you, there's a fierce fire hiddin' inside ye there,” they said, their eyes sparkling. “You've obviously got a good heart in ye, an’ I think you’ll do right by her, but this just ain't the right way to go about it."
Because Sam had said something, too. Something that he also probably never intended the full implication of:
“Damn!” she shouts and pounds her fist on the floor.
Dean dropped the pan on the stove, the harsh clang cruelly smashing into his headache.
I’ll—!”
“Well it’s something to do with the house, right?” Dean said, answering a question Cas hadn’t asked.
No-no-no, what?
“I… I need to know…” he said, “if Dean Winchester is in Heaven.”
And now he and Bris were washing the dishes from the amazing meal they had made for themselves, Sam washing and Bris drying—
“Not by my own will, I can assure ye. The whole country's been subjected to this on repeat since it damn well came out. I swears we all hear it in our sleep."
“That isn’t the only reason I like it.”
The bunker did not respond.
“Dean the Hunter!” he shouted and pulled Dean into a crushing hug. “And Castiel the Hunter Angel!” He hugged Cas just as strongly. “What’re ye doin’ here, lads? We got more demons to slay?”
“Archangel.”
“I was giving them time to escape!” Dean spread his arms indignantly.
'Cause I've been waitin',
It was immediately apparent that what little ice there was had been recently broken. They even found some tracks in the snow. Cas bent down to inspect them.
Dean doesn’t answer. The silent
“Fuck, Dean!” Sam clutched his head. “What the shit!?”
“Yeah, Cas?”
The song on the speaker switched abruptly, from the slow stomping of the last song to another one, more upbeat and— as Sam unfortunately knew from years of being subjected to Dean’s severely limited pallet of music—
“Whatever,” he huffed, slouching over the keyboard. “Go get your stupid drink.”
“I was going to do this before you so
Bris stopped cold, pulled up short. She stared down at the book. Stared up at him. Gave half a second’s thought to turning on her heel right then and there. To turning on her heel in the face of ultimatum, to just walking away and marching straight back over to that cabinet—
Dean shrugged. “Basically forever, I guess.”
“You Asked us, so soon after the Start, You Asked us to Care for the Humans. You Asked us to Care for them, to Help them and Protect them... But then You left. You left us to our own devices and this was the result. Humanity tortured for millennia, the Apocalypse initiated before You intended, angels dying, scores at a time...
Cas raised an eyebrow, “Nervous.”
“Crowley—”
One of the voices pulled in a hissing sigh. *
And yet...
He stepped back from the group, drawing Sam’s attention again. Michael narrowed his eyes, looking over them all with bored, detached contempt. “Go back to your own lives,” he said. “You are not welcome here.”
The lights surged.
A rush of great wings interrupted the angel, kicking up a cloud of crystalline snow between the trees. As it settled, a voice called out across the distance, a voice so familiar, so heartening and yet so
Besides, knowing Sam, if Dean pushed the issue he'd just use that big brain of his to flip everything back over to Dean, and after Max, Dean was pretty much talked-out for the next year.
This evening though— or was it morning already— Sam found himself looking up at the sound of one set of footsteps approaching. It caught his attention for some reason, strange to his ear, the weight and the cadence seeming... off. Unfamiliar. So Sam raised his eyes, already reaching for his gun—
“Some a’ them wounds have only jus’ recently faded, an’ not by much. This got way outta hand—”
Looming over the stacks, Sam pulled the largest tome forward and turned to a section near the back. During the nine-hour drive back from Texas, he'd decided that what he needed was, first, a standard, no-nonsense summoning spell. After that, maybe, just maybe, he could modify it, change an ingredient or a perhaps a word and
“Is that why—”
She didn’t respond to that. “How could I not see this comin’?” she said instead, “I mean, I thought somethin’ was up but…
Bris shot back at Castiel. “Look at his damned hea— I mean his— well, yes his heart! Ain’t no way that’s a
Castiel cut left, dragging Sam along. They had to get away, they
“So I’m not just imagining it?” Gabriel asked.
She released him and headed for the hallway, suddenly beaming as she pointed back at him,
“Well, damn,” said Dean, closing his own laptop as he stood from the table, "sure sounds like a job to me. Let’s leave in an hour. Pack heavy, sounds like we might be there a while.”

He stared at her, wide-eyed and incredulous. “You’re sherioush. You achually mean it,” he said through his smushed cheeks.
As they panted through the aftershocks, the mists of their air mingled, the closest they had actually gotten to each other.
“What do you want?”
Sam slipped in at the counter next to Bris.
“What? You don't want some help?”
When her hand reached his, the wind cut and the din ceased, but Sam had no fear that the spell had failed. He could still feel it humming through him, was still bathed in the light of the spell circle, and though he couldn't see it himself, of course, the white light had risen in his eyes as well, strong and steady as he looked deep into Bris’s own and gave his final answer:
“So what, Sam and I aren’t your pack?”
“Well... Do you think there was something to what that demon told us back in the bunker? Could Crowley really be alive?”
Something was off. All Sam wanted was to take her hand, to really
As soon as they were all in the car, Dean cranked the radio, successfully stymieing any and all conversation. The drive was blissfully uneventful until, just as they were about to pass by the road to the motel, Dean's phone buzzed.
“I’m sorry— I—" Sam quickly drew back, "You see, Rowena? I can’t. I can’t handle that. Trust me, you don’t want to give me that, I’m not strong enough for it.”

Sam took a steadying breath and found Bris’s hand. “You ready?” he asked.
Bris shot at Gabriel.

“Shit, wait—” Sam stepped forward—
I don't believe in no devil,
And turned to Bris.
As they approached, Sam’s bedroom door opened and he stepped out. He was bleary-eyed, his hair was an absolute disaster, and he just barely seemed to register that Dean and Cas were even there.

Rowena replies, still testy.
"What?" snapped Sebhin. "Ye mean to tell me only Bris gets a name what means somethin'?"
As they moved to return to the others, they saw something stir in the water. Then a lot of somethings. Then a crowd of seals poked their heads up cautiously from the water.
“Nah, nevermind, it’s stupid and sappy.”
Dean ignored that. He continued watching Cas, the sharp creases on his face softening into worry.
: PSH bet I could handle em

“What?” Sam looked to Bris again. She seemed to have stopped breathing. “No,” Sam said to Michael. “No, you’re lyi—”

Sam rolled his eyes, but was ready to humor her. “Alright,” he allowed himself to be led, “but I’m not gonna have all that much.”
“You take another

Michael hummed, and turned from Lucifer again. His gaze fell to Dean. “Well, well.”

Castiel turned to him, concern etching his face. “Sam… you know you wouldn't survive that.”
it,” she declared.
Dean spun on the spot and found Crowley behind him, putting his phone back in his pocket.
Dean snapped up at him, and the fury he intended must not have gotten through because Sam just softened at him.
He didn't want to, but Cas conceded this ground as well.
Cas faced his monster down. Both breathed heavily, each sizing each other up.
Dean glances at Adam.
"It's because he don't n—"
Cas was still looking to Sam, “But you have another idea.”
“I mean it, Bris, I love you. I love
“Why are you here?” she clipped.
Bris spun to face the voice, and her blood ran cold, and she threw a protective arm in front of Inas.
Dean wiped his palms on his shirt and approached Sam to take the bag. “Yeah. Sure. What’d you get?”
It was too much.

“That whole week, things were finally going so well. After what I did, the mistakes I had made,” his hands twitched in his lap, “I intended to
“It’s a concern. But I have the program Sam set up for me, and I’ve discussed it with my Healer, and I have you, of course.” He squeezes Dean’s hand. “I will feel the pull of the Empty’s despair more thoroughly than before, but I’ll also feel joy, and victory, and love as well.”
“Yeah, what about Dean-o?” Direl echoed.
“Well…?” said Bris. “C’mon now, we done waited this long.”
Bris hesitantly raised a hand, laying it out over Sams chest. Her eyes darted across him, as if trying to take in everything she could see there all at once.
I count the days, 'til I carry you home—"
“Oh, thanks for sharing,” Sam snapped from behind him.
"I mean it! What if— What if the Lord don't actually give half a rat's ass what's—"
Dean says nothing.
He could see that Crowley was flitting around, moving demon soldiers, trying to form some kind of assault. But Castiel knew it for what it was. He was flailing. He was panicking.
Dean must be—
said Asmodeus, “and I’ll snap his neck with a
His glowing eyes searched hers for a long moment before he squeezed them shut and dropped his head.
“And I’m the spare,” Adam shrugs.
about you!” She rushed right at Dean, her arms thrown wide and her extraordinarily long, wavy brown hair fanning out behind her.
Bris's eyes turned a little sad. Her eyes dipped to the ground, and she gave a small sigh. "Right. Well, sure, yeah, I'll meet yeh back on shore."
Another man near the back of the group piped up. “We’ve been tracking the Winchesters for years. You’re supposed to be dead.”
Sam’s blood ran cold.
Dean looks up again, and it’s like the rising of a new sun.
And for the first time in a long time, watching them now, Dean felt… assured. Sam had come up with that plan all on his own. He'd used his freaky powers to one-up that asshole. He even had not one, but
“Dammit, Cas,
I ain't a fuckin' monster, I'm a part of this puzzle, I'm a part of this Web of Life the Lord done spun for us here."
Sam huffed with a pitiful little sigh.
“And there’s this turbulence in me. When they’re happy I’m elated, when they’re upset, I’m furious.” Cas placed a hand over his chest. “Something as small as their smile releases a warmth in me that I’ve come to both treasure and dread.”
he's clean-on.”
their mission had been a success, Gabriel had been rescued, but so much had gone wrong. And all of it was Castiel’s fault. He hadn’t been able to protect any of them, he had derailed everything multiple times, and he had almost— he'd almost— How he was still being allowed to
They hadn't run into any other curses lately. Just that witch,
Donna huffed through her widening smile. “Well now, that kinda flattery is gonna get you everywhere, mister.”
And he sat right back down.
After dinner, they crossed back through the woods to the parking lot where they lingered with their last goodbyes. As the streetlights came on, Ballo was the one who gave them all a gentle shove.
“Oh! Sam!” Bris yelped in surprise.
Sam took his beer with a smirk and popped the lid with a nearby bottle opener. Cas pushed his lid off with his thumb.
your heart!”
“Goodness, no, I’d love somethin' more,” she said with an easy smile. And oh, would you look at that, another somersault.
“Why? He doesn’t wait for us.”
“Unless the bunker’s on fucking fire, you better fuck the fuck off!” Dean shouted blearily at the door.
“It’s a terribly long, complicated story that ends in...” he shrugged,
She hummed in acknowledgement, barely looking up.
“Well, why not just send your angel?”
— For one
Castiel glared at her. “You certainly took your time getting here to see him.”
“You keep saying that, but I really don’t know what you mean.”
God, he hoped it always felt so good to hear his name on her voice.
"That weren't— Lass, that weren't what I meant at all. That
Cas reached out, but he didn't quite place his hand on Sam's shoulder. “Sam…”

He emerges from the light, tall and armed and deceptively stoic, his sharp, bright eyes already searching the woods around him. He appears, and the once-silent clearing is suddenly full, stuffed, ready to burst at the seams from the wide, heavy, driving beat of—

Dean paused.
“I didn’t.”
The echoes of an immense fight trailed down the hall. Or was it vibrating from the walls? Sam didn’t have time to consider it.
times better with Cas!”
Dean smiled at him. “That’d be dumb.”
Castiel stood firm, betraying no reaction to that. He glared at her a moment longer, his eyes hard and unreadable as he faced her down.
He chuckled as Sam ran into the room, “You’re gonna love this.”
With a smooth, deliberate motion, he lifted a hand, pointing a single finger at Crowley.
Cas nodded.
“Oh would you jus’ spill it, lass?” another cousin sitting next to Inas cut in. “You’re only drawin’ out the inevitable.”
Cas nodded, though he took up his button again. “I see... Perhaps I’m overreacting.”
“But... he’s...”
“I’ll get them back!” Sam felt the static of her next spell charging across his already burning skin.
Home. Little villages on the coast, high cliffs and craggy rocks, the salty ocean crashing against the shore... Not like this fucking place. All roads and cars and shitty strip malls and too-quiet bars and tall, handsome men who want nothing more than to pull you into their arms and—
Direl did a double take and flipped to face Sam, “The fuck—? What jus’ happened?”

“No.”

There was no longer a TV for the Dean Cave. Fortress of Dean-itude. Still not sure about that.
“Yes we’ve—” Sam tried.
shut up, Dean,” Sam groaned.
Heaven was awful to rule.
“No, don't—”
there’s a right way—”
Dean closed his eyes and spread his palms. “I think I might be bi.”
“They will always leave,” Michael said, leering down at the human. “One way… or another.”

The demon leered down at his handiwork and dropped the flannels on the ground. “Goodbye, Castiel. Enjoy eternity knowing you did this to them. That you couldn’t even protect two measly humans from their ultimate fate.”
going to repeat myself.” His tongue obeyed him. The necklace seemed satisfied.
“When you said I wasn’t family,” Jack says, helpfully.
Someone knocked on his door, and he didn’t need to check his phone to know that it was still ass-o-clock in the morning.
“Somethin’ went wrong.”
“I should probably go too,” Bris said. Dean jumped at her voice, having apparently forgotten she was there.
Cas wasn't there when Dean woke up in the middle of the night.
“I will. I
Bris gathered herself, and took a steadying breath.
“I know it's not much, but— it should be enough.”
Cas rolled his eyes to the roof as he nodded in frustration out the window, tight-lipped and trying not to scowl. He turned back to Dean. “This is where Asmodeus kept Lucifer and I prisoner.”
Direl froze mid-shake. His eyes went wide and his face paled.
Cas noticed a tension in the bunker these days. Sam and Bris were almost constantly upset, though over what Cas had no idea. Direl was still troubled since their trip to Sioux Falls and both he and Ketch were avoiding just about everyone. It seemed that only Eileen was feeling alright, though she did seem to be uncomfortable around Cas. He’d never been all that close to her in the first place, and he certainly didn’t want to make the situation worse, so he didn’t press the matter.

“I'm sure the kids are going to insist,” Cas says, and everyone settles down.

Sam raised an eyebrow.

"You will
“Well I only been cookin’ a century an’ a half, I think I could scrounge one up.”
“What?” he said.
Castiel couldn't. But Gabriel could.

“Oh I get to pick?" Crowley placed a disingenuous hand over his heart. "Well then, how about I make a suggestion: I’ll help you now and tell you what I want later. How’s that sound?”
Ballo turned back to Dean with an exhale, “Alright, son, s'pose this
“Shit, man, you didn’t tell us people were hurt! We woulda come faster!” Dean barked, glaring daggers at Sam. But before Sam could answer, Dean's whole expression melted, and he shrank into himself. “Not that— Not that I
“Put me on speaker!”
The app they were using played all sorts of things for them. Dean had started them off with his favorite songs, of course, but the station started suggesting other genres almost immediately, and it quickly became a game of what crazy thing they could prompt the app to play next. Soon they got into some jazz, and Bris was elated. Then they found some hybrid of jazz and rock, and she was
Crowley stared at them. “...If I told you I wasn’t also trying for a hotdog, would you believe me?”
Something familiar clicked in Crowley’s mind, and he found himself saying, “You know, I could do something about that for you.”
“Look. Could we maybe talk about—?”
Sam pushed on, halting her motion, “is because two of the people I trusted most, stopped me from saving him.”
And he hung up.
“I promise you, My son, you will find the happiness you seek in time. It is on its way. I only ask for your patience for a little longer.”
The corner of Ketch’s mouth twitched.
“You’ve been saving it,” he said.
ye are!” He released Sam and went to Inas, draping his arm around their shoulders now. He turned back to the group, his smile brighter than the fire, “‘Ave I introduced ye ta Inas yet?”
“Well…”
He was at the mercy of that speaker, and he hated it,
Perfect.
"Thing is, though," they continued, a frown coming to the edge of their expression, "I didn't much like the endin’ a’ that one.
“And what is
“Yeah, sure, man. You’re gonna love this shit, I can tell.”
And that scared him.
Bris slowly turned to him, her eyebrows deeply furrowed. “I beg yer pardon?” she asked him.
Her grin grew knowing. “Actually, I like you better with that on. Think we're goin' to work with it for now.”
Dean turned to Cas and raised a lazy eyebrow at him, “Isn't that kinda your whole deal? An angel guarding the poor saps stuck in Heaven?”
on second thought, no,” she held up her hands as she looked up at them, "I don't like this.” She stood and crossed over to the dresser that held the television, waving a hand at them. "You lot sit.”
Righteous Man! We
Dean blinked at the wall, open mouthed. “Oh.”
She pinched his side and scrunched her nose at him, “You’re too good to me, you knows that?”
Ballo gave a harsh sigh that edged on a growl, “Good Lord, ye stubborn bastard. Even the tallest tree knows what to bend in the wind.”
“What are you doing?” Sam asked.
“Well, let’s get going,” he said, trying to keep the surprise from his voice. When Sam and Cas went to get in the car, Dean pulled the thing out of his pocket.
“Oh, no-no-no,” Gabriel clutched the paper to his chest, “I’m not telling you that. That’s exactly the kind of baloney that gets all the movers and shakers upstairs tied in knots.”
It built up slowly. So slowly he didn’t notice it creeping in until it was all he could hear:
It's just that Sam was honestly contemplating selling his soul to get Direl out of this car, that's all.
sorry, darlin’," Rowena said. "I’m gonna need more from you.”
“The 'movers and shakers'?”

“Hey, ‘morning,” he said, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.

“I understand we are to fight another version of myself this day,” Michael's gaze slipped lazily back to Dean, “but I won’t last an entire battle like this. Well—” he spread Cas’s arms,
“What about my sister?”
“Neither have they!” She gestured at Direl and Gabriel.

“Probably.”

“Where’s Sam?” Dean said, cutting off Direl’s answer.
They sat in silence, meditating on the steady rhythm of Sam's breathing.
at comfortable silences. It was just… weird.
The angel swore violently. “
They reached a corner, and Dean almost cried at the mental relief of seeing something different. But Crowley stopped them before they could go around.
He could guess, though. An age ago, when Castiel had last wondered aloud why he had been brought back from the Empty, Dean had told him that they needed him. That they needed Castiel around. That they needed his help.
Dean made it to Crowley in three steps, stopping inches from his nose. “Don’t you
Castiel drew back, his eyes searching over Chuck, brow knitting with a frown. “...Me?”
Max continued.
“He has a point,” Cas said. “The Irish people are known for their proclivity to alcoholism brought on by centuries of oppression and direct hostility.”
There’s… him. Him, Dean, his body, thousands of him, strewn across a floor without an end. His body, mangled and bloody and dead, dead,

“Did not! I know this place like the back a' my hand!” He held up a hand too close to Cas’s face. “Oh hey, that’s new,” he said at a scar.
She pulled her hand back.

appeared? How long would they wait? Weeks? Months?
He followed Claire out of the kitchen, glancing back at Jody, but she could only shrug.
He lifted a hand and focused on the lock. It twitched under his concentration, bolstering his resolve. He jerked his hand down, and the lock jerked with it, and Gabriel flinched.
“Oh,” said Sam. “Um. I could ask him. For you. I-If you want.”
Cas returned the touch, leaning into him some, but his posture didn’t improve.
Sam glanced up. “The Seal of Solomon?”
that's all he needs, he's gotta be— Hey, whoa—”
Just then, almost as one, the selkies perked up and turned north.
why wasn't Cas more careful?
Cas brightened immediately at the news, “Oh!”

“Gabriel,” Sam gently lowered his crossed fingers. “How about you just sit down and tell us.”
Dean's lip curled over a grated sigh. He pulled up the pin Crowley had sent, and went to tell Cas.
“What's taking people from their boats?” Sam cut in before Dean could jump the gun.
But he only heard silence.
"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey, man," Dean was up in an instant, placing himself between Cas and Ballo. Cas raised an eyebrow at how quickly Dean had recovered from his exhaustion.  “Relax, okay? He's not a Cupid.”
him—"
Cas replayed his conversation with Dean, but couldn’t find the context to make sense of that.
“You need archangel grace," he finally said. "And I know where to get it.”
Turn me loose and you'll see why,
Cas watched him leave, thoroughly confused.
Dean allowed him to pull his hands off the wall, and as soon as he placed them back on his hips it was like a light switch being flipped. Suddenly he remembered how his part was supposed to work, and his hands gripped his ass and he pulled him in harder and faster and rougher against him.
She rolled her eyes,
Dean almost snarled at her.
Bonus Scene:
Cas’s lips twitched up at the small compliment.
The lightbulb of the desk lamp shattered.
Dean’s eyes darted, the building smell of overcooked meat lost on him.
“I mean, comparatively, anyway.”
That’s Sam’s shout, and now Sam is running up to him, shaking him awake. “Dean! Dean! Are you okay? Dean!”
“Haven't moved past it.”
"You seem to think that God ain't even here, so I ain’t quite sure why you're so caught up about it, but if you're gonna insist on tryin'a figure out the Lord's plan then I gotta ask: Have ye considered that
thing?”
“This is very nice,” Cas said, patting the large forelimb stretched out next to him. He turned to Inas sitting beside him on a log, “You know, these rivers have a terrible problem with Asian Carp, perhaps these creatures could be trained to hunt them.”
“Nice job,” said Sam.
Dean saw the pain in Cas’s eyes, he did. If there were any other way he would never ask him to do this. But it was this or… And no one was ever gonna do that to Sam again. Not as long as Dean lived.

Sam turned to Bris. “But this razor totally moved.”
And finally, hesitantly, Cas met his eyes.
“If we leave right away we can be there by… this evening,” Sam said, checking his map. “Let us take you out to dinner, we’ll send you off right.”
“Okay, lad.”
The door opened anyway, and who turned out to be Sam said, “Dude, it’s like almost afternoon. We let you sleep in already.”

Sam blinked at him. “I am... seriously reconsidering asking you to come along.”
Sam chuffed. “Well, alright, that all makes a lot more sense now," he said with a genuine smile. “So how’s it feel?”
“Please,” she tossed at him, and she vanished.

He froze mid-step in the pacing he'd started, suddenly sinking in a realm beyond guilt.
Bris was already getting back to her feet, fire in her eyes and ready to lunge again. But both Dean and Asmodeus shot her warning looks.
“I know, Jack, I know,” she soothed. She placed an open hand on his back and rubbed gently, up and down. “I’m just wondering why.”
“There’s that name again. Who’s this Crowley fella?” Bris asked.

Dean wouldn’t come, so he knew he could relax, could really explore his new ability. Yes, Dean already knew about this, or at least, he had some idea that these abilities existed, but his reaction back in Hell hadn’t exactly instilled confidence in Sam that Dean would take further

“Christ

“Seeing anything, Cas?” Sam asked.

“Dean…” came Sam’s voice from somewhere off to his side.
Dean glanced at where Cas had just been kneeling. “And the river…?”
She drew back. "I— What?"
They all did their best to lift his mood, but there was nothing for it. Offers to vent were left on the table, historical trivia was left undiscussed, attempts at pranks were met with blank, vacant looks, and even bottle caps went unread. It truly seemed that no amount of patience or assurances of understanding could rouse him.
“Ye sure fucked up this time, you worthless shtate,” she spat, her voice wavering violently through clenched teeth. “Couldn’t pull yer shit together for one goddamned second an’ now— You stupid girl. You stupid,

“What—? Oh. What's up, Samalam? Besides you, freaking giant.”
as well, all curled together in a sleek knot at the edge of the water, sleeping in a quiet heap while a few selkies used them as backrests. Dean eyed them warily, but somehow found the beasts less terrifying than before.
Cas nodded. “Yes, I noticed a picture of your son on the mantle. Was he a swimmer at school?”
Cas’s raised eyebrow. “Then why do you so frequently tell me ‘not to worry about it’?”
Unfortunately, all she had was a 24 gallon tank, so despite Sam’s protests, they had to stop for gas somewhere in Iowa.

Speaking with Dean’s voice.
Dean stood straighter.
The song playing out over the bar switched to something new, and a woman’s rough voice leapt out at him:
“I know. I’m sorry, Dean. But he’s back on Earth. He should at least be safe there.”
A warmth spread in Dean’s chest. He turned down the heater.

Sam laughed now, just a little bit.
He almost put his phone back, but he lifted it up again.

“Well, what is it?

“Yes, about. The Cherokee referred to them as 'The Great Leeches of Tlanusi’yi'. The European settlers who prayed for deliverance from their wrath simply called them ‘hellspawn.’ They… weren’t quite as creative.”
“It’s like he doesn’t even care!” Sam said of his own volition.

"Well— I—" She shifted in her seat. “No, it’s… it’s not really that, Sam.”
“No— Sam— I’m so sorry I did this to you. I had my head so far up my own arse I couldn’t see—”
He found his pants.
Cas left the motel room to wait out the rest of the night, leaning up against the car.
There’s movement from behind Dean, and he turns in place to see rows upon rows of people. We see every angel and demon we can get back, from Uriel to Balthazar, Samandriel to Bartholomew, Abbadon and Meg all the way to Demon #3, even Metatron, they’re all here, facing Dean.
Dean refused to walk with him down the trail to the river. He stayed a few feet away the entire time.
"Yeah, I don't think so."
The lights cut out, and they were thrown into a sea of flashing red alarms.
“Goddamned
“When’s the last time we had an easy salt-n-burn, huh?” Dean had said with a grin, though Sam couldn’t help thinking it seemed strained.
“Oh— yeah—” he agreed quickly, “yeah, I bet she’ll take real good care of Sam when I’m gone.”
“I'll leave,” Castiel said as he turned away. Again. He started up the stairs. “Once Jack and Mary are back home you'll never have to see me agai—”

“No, I—” Cas shifted his weight. “Of course I do.”
Cas lets out a surprised chuckle, slipping his arms fully around Dean to pull him into a proper embrace. "I will gladly engage in sexual congress with you later."
The accusation makes Cas laugh, his mouth curving up even further into a pleased little grin that makes Dean feel a bit like he's been punched in his feelings.
"Really, Cas?" He inclines his head toward the sign.
The tantalizing idea of public blowjobs sidetracks Dean just long enough for Cas to sidle even closer, his fingers slipping under Dean's t-shirt to trace increasingly distracting patterns over his hip bones. "I want us to do something nice together. Something to make you feel good."
"That you, Dean Winchester, are entitled to two blowjobs for doing this with me."
"Damn it, Cas, I said no!"
"Let's do that other thing then," Dean snipes, feeling his resolve weaken with each teasing stroke of those clever fingers.
“No,” he says stubbornly, arms crossed over his chest.
"You know, springing this idea on me with no warning was rude," Dean rants on, warming to his topic with a gusto that he usually saves for his weekly ‘
It's easy to tip his head, a pleased hum escaping him as the angel catches his lips for a short yet surprisingly thorough kiss. He chases the sensation of chapped lips as Cas leans back making the angel drop one last peck on the end of Dean's nose before pulling out of his embrace, laughing when he sees the disgruntled frown on his boyfriend's face.
"I'm an angel of the Lord, Dean. It seemed fitting."
A long suffering sigh follows. "You're being unreasonable."
Sensing weakness in the way Dean sways closer, Cas pulls out the big guns, his lower lip plumping into an adorable pout while those blue eyes gaze up at him in a silent plea. "Please," he whispers, pressing a series of kisses to the sensitive skin just below Dean's jaw line, a spot that Cas damn well knows makes him weak in the knees.
