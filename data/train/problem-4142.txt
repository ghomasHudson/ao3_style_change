“Cas did what now?” Dean frowned.
“Why are you trying to go there?” Mary asked. “Did… Where is Cas?”
?” Ellen asked, and she couldn’t decide if she was outraged or impressed.
“What was I, born yesterday? Be reasonable, Castiel.” It kicked him away, stretching its legs. “Even I can admit when I was wrong. You
“Yes, yes, you have a lot of questions, and we will soon have time to answer them all. For now, why don’t you follow Naomi – she’s gonna put you all up to date on all that is, all that was, and all that it will be.”
“What?” Castiel said.
“But I
“How do you like that, huh?” Dean said. “That Shakespeare enough for you?”
“Poor baby,” he cooed. “Want me to kiss it better?”
The car that hit her was a bright yellow Jaguar going twice the speeding limit down her lane, and by the time Dad got to the scene, the colour had bled out until it was nothing but an indistinct pale grey.
“Now we’re going to be late for class,” Castiel declared.
The teacher shook her head, eyes wide and bewildered. Dean briefly wondered if she thought he was on drugs. “No, I just—why?”
“What?” Dean said, the same time Sam said, “Oh,” with a heavy exhale of pure, sheer relief.
“That’s my coat,” he said.
“Hey,” Dean said.
“Huh,” Sam said, and then, “We’re out of Lucky Charms.”
Dean started to walk towards him and then stopped, chewing his lip nervously.
on the
“The two rundown hunters you’re talking about are the two most important people I know.” Cas was pulling that solemn, wide-eyed look again, the one that said
That night, Dean had just finished washing the dishes after dinner when Sam called.
“Maybe I don’t even
Sammy was in the room. His face was wrinkly and tiny and all curled up in an exceedingly-displeased expression. He was wailing loud enough that Dean wrinkled his own face in response.
The man looked away, pursing his lips quick before blowing out a breath.
He should have just ignored him. He should have just left the instant he caught sight of Dean’s little smirk and flashing green eyes. But it was 10PM and Castiel was so very tired, cranky, and
Tom was already at the restaurant when Castiel arrived. Castiel remembered his straight, gelled hair and solemn dark eyes.
The man stepped closer, chest against Castiel’s back, and leaned in until they were pressed flush together. He tipped his hands over and deposited the bird into the nest. Castiel heard a squawk and a flurry of chirps before things settled down, peaceful once more.
And wasn't that just the shittiest thing?
how long it takes to cross the street around here.”
The love went away on its own, and even the taste faded away eventually. Castiel obediently pressed and penned down each and every blossom. Sometimes, he'd flip through the pages, fingering the edges of the wrinkled petals with a strange sense of detachment. He remembered the love, but he couldn't remember the sensation; like watching a movie or reading a book, it was all in the past. His crushes were always baby-pink innocent, pale pastel petals, and the memories were warm and fuzzy. The stronger ones were darker, navy reds and blues in blossoming jasmine and peony. (He hadn't had a rose, yet. He wondered who would be his rose.) His first time having sex was with a girl a grade up called Meg who had smirked at him while he fumbled with the condom. He thought that Meg would have to be a big, loud flower, the sort that took up the centrepiece of a bouquet; big black roses or a cactus flower that hurt coming up. But he never had any for Meg, and Meg hadn't had any for Castiel.
“Cas,” he murmurs, wondering how to tell this.
Sam smiled. “Don’t worry, Dean,” he said good-naturedly. “I’m sure you’ll get your colours soon.”
“Yeah, no problem,” Dean said, and he was already feeling better. That wasn’t—that wasn’t hard at all.
“So’m I,” Dean mumbled, sidling closer. “So can I, um—”
“You do?” Dean blurted.
"Huh," Dean said. "Hope you had fun. Hey, where did my jacket go?"
The man sighed. “You don’t give up, do you?”
Two weeks later, it was with a creeping hesitation and reluctant recognition that Castiel had to admit that his plan wouldn’t just need to be altered, but utterly revamped.
On his stroll down the halls, his eyes caught on something: a flash of tan.
It was impossible to see any expressions, any voices, but joy radiated from each inch of the painting, so much so that Dean found himself smiling as he studied it, careful not to step past the white tape marking. Sam had dragged a huge plastic tarp out of nowhere the winter after he became obsessed with the piece, and they had even convinced Dad to ride it once—at least, until it snagged on a stray branch and Dean tumbled head over heels and got the bloody nose to end all bloody noses. His nose throbbed just thinking about it, and it only made him smile harder.
“Exactly. Which is why, like I proposed earlier, you should just go with Lisa alone.”
good together, Dean had to admit.
“Why not?”
Dean did a double-take before nodding. “Since freshman year.”
Studiously ignoring him, Castiel raised his hands towards the nest. His fingers grazed the air.
Dean grinned back crazily, and then, just because he had to fuck everything up because he couldn’t wait any longer, had waited so, so long just for this moment, said, “I love you.”
“Uh-huh,” came the skeptical reply. Dean darted his eyes away from the laser-beam gaze all teachers seemed to have mastered, the one that still made him feel antsy even when he
“If you wanted,” Dean tacked on hastily. “It’s fine if you don’t—it’s stupid, nevermind—” He tried to drop Cas hand.
Dean couldn’t fight back the grin this time. “Yeah, I did. Just ignore Chad. He’s a stupid bully.”
Beth ate it up, her cheeks going pink as she giggled at Dean. Castiel immediately decided that he hated him.
“I told you, you can’t reach it,” the man called out.
“Oh,” Cas said. “Am I done then?”
“Do you work here often?” he asked, watching Castiel move around the space with a careless grace, following him to where a frame was already set up.
“You were supposed to be in the library,” Castiel finally said.
“Like the sky,” Dean whispered.
Dean watched him for a while, oddly enthralled with his movements as he tightened the canvas around the frame, pulled out his palette, rinsed his brush in a pot of murky-grey water. The only tubes of paint he retrieved from his bags were black, white, and a stony grey.
Now apprehensive, confused, and unnerved all at the same time, Castiel watched as the man bent over himself, hands on his knees as he caught his breath, laughs bursting out every now and again.
“What?”
Dean shook his head. “Doesn’t matter,” he said. “Tell me what happened to you.”
His mother’s water broke on the way to the hospital, and Dean remembered the way she gritted her teeth so hard he could hear them grinding together all the way from the backseat. He remembered the way she had insisted getting out of the car himself, waving off all the helping hands of the doctors. He remembered thinking, at that moment, her mother was the bravest person he knew—braver than Dad, even.
“I wouldn’t deny it. The King would only choose the best of his best to protect his eldest son.”
“Truth or dare,” Dean said.
“That sounds lovely,” Castiel said.
like right now.
Cas nearly dodged it this time. Dean’s knuckles clipped off his shoulder.
“Seriously?” Castiel was mildly incredulous. “What about when he disguised himself as a stableboy to sneak out and ride horses at night?”
Bobby had looked at Dean for a second, then looked a little harder—and then something flashed across his face.
Castiel faltered at that; Dean could see it in his eyes.
“God,” his father said, and then began to cry. Dean watched, eyes wide. He’d never seen his father cry. “I miss you. I miss you so fucking much.”
“I’m in the third stage of Hanahaki disease,” Castiel said dryly, not missing the way Dean flinched at the name as if it were a dart. “And it’s not for Tom.”
“Okay,” he murmured. “I think we’re good now.”
“Castiel,” the nurse—Millie, her name was—urged, quietly. Castiel had never heard her speak up until now, and her voice, albeit soft, was firm. “The surgery is safe, I promise.”
for you,” Dean said, a hand against the small of Castiel’s back, leaning in close enough that their noses brushed. “The doors to the library can lock.”
“Awesome,” Dean said. Cas was warmed up now. “I dare you to lick the dashboard.”
? You’re talking about bringing back an entire circus troupe.”
“You know, you could just go back to sleep”, the Shadow said, fiddling with its nails. It had conjured a chair for itself, using Cas as a footrest. “You don’t need to see what happens next.”
, Rowena.”
They moved on to – another – throne room, where Amara had taken residency. In her brother’s old chair, she looked right in place; on the other hand, the two people perched at her side, Naomi and Anael, were… not an encouraging sight.
“Like the Anomaly!” Ash said. He had awakened himself by snatching away Kevin’s beer.
“They let me out on good behavior”, Bobby joked. “It wasn’t like they had enough juice to keep the lights on over there on my prison sell, either.”
“Didn’t you kill me? Like, personally?” Ambriel pointed out.
sending you to Hell myself!”
“Wait. Did the Apocalypse already happen?”
”, she corrected, pointedly. “In my personal opinion, everything in the universe needs balance, and this job was clearly not one meant to be done alone. This way, things are always… even. Unless of course either of you have a problem with that.”
Dean didn’t need to be there to know his brother was all choked up. “Thank you.”
“Clearly, I got better”, she said, waving her arms. “I missed you guys.”
“So which one of us gets the job?” Tessa asked.
“I can handle it, I just need a little more focus”, she said, closing her eyes. Maybe all that yoga had actually served for something, after all.
“No, I mean”, he cleaned his throat. “I mean, can they come with us?”
“Maybe we don’t have to.” Sam pointed out. “Remembered last time we tried to escape Heaven?”
“You mean Castiel”, Naomi interrupted, almost spitefully. “If he is in the Empty, that means he is dead.”
“That just proves you’re a real Winchester”, she took his face in her hands, squishing his cheeks gently. “Killing each other… it happens to the best of us. Look around.”
“We’re not giving up”, Dean said, determined. “We’re already here. Even if we have to knock on every door…”
“What about our recently un-departed?”
think you can
“How are you here? I thought they had you in lock up”, Dean asked, holding on to him.
“Oh, here it is”, he pulled the pillows up. He used to hide guns and knives under there, and now he was finding tiny plastic pink beach rakes. The kid wanted what the kid wanted. “I gotta go, man. Same time next week?”
On one hand, Dean agreed; it would be good for Claire and the girls to have another person they could talk to about their experiences, and Kevin deserved the chance to live a normal life of a young adult. On the other hand… “How long do you think it will take before they burn down her kitchen?”
“What about them?” Dean asked, towards the rest of the gang. They had stepped back, unsure whether or not they should revere the figure before them – or, in Ash (and Charlie)’s case, if they should hit on her.
“There may be another way”, Jack pondered. “Nick… when he tried to bring Lucifer back, he used a spell. I don’t know the spell, but I know it used my blood. Blood of a relative. Maybe if we have some of Cas’ blood – I guess Claire’s counts, since she is his daughter…”
Being reborn, however, meant having a body of their own – for many, it was a sudden, shocking experience of feeling their own flesh, of understanding the sensation of having fingers.
Thankfully, Jack stepped in. “I can get us there”, he said, snatching them away with a snap of his fingers.
“I can see shame no longer cloaks your heart, Dean Winchester. Good. Unfortunately… there are billions of heavens to look through, and we don’t have the manpower to look through all of them. Especially if we don’t know what we’re looking for. I certainly can’t help you – I have to create more angels, keep the lights on here, keep the personal heavens from deteriorating more than they already…”
She almost blushed. “Oh, Samuel. Always with the flattery. But I’m afraid this time it’s beyond even my powers. Whatever is happening out there – it doesn’t want anyone from this side interfering.”
But this time… this time there was gonna be a different ending.
"You better!"
"That does sound scary," Castiel admitted. "I'm sorry she went through that."
Castiel noticed, of course; he always noticed things better, sooner, clearer, than Dean could.
What the hell. He deserved some pie today.
Cas shook his head immediately. “I don’t want to.”
"Anyway, Cas," Dean said, "Nice to meet ya. Can you cook?"
. Castiel finished hanging up his coat and immediately started to walk into his room, leaving Dean standing in the hall, feeling lost and disconcerted and like he had been the one to go through surgery instead. Something about the way he didn't come out of his room until way past dinnertime, when they usually would bicker and fight over what to eat.
Castiel spotted it. “New decor?” he asked mildly.
He covered his face in his hands and breathed fast and hard until he had shoved the tears far, far down and out of reach.
Castiel tilted his head. “Hungry,” he finally settled on.
Dean said, and then grinned like a cat who got the canary, eyes sparkling.
“God, gross!”
Dean stepped back, not because of Castiel’s actions but rather out of surprise instead. “Hey, wait—”
"Dr. Singer," the nurse protested.
“Thanks for dinner,” Tom finally said. “It was nice.”
He found his way to Castiel’s section in the shop and picked up a medium-sized poster of
“You’re
Cas didn’t. He narrowed his eyes at the car, and then at Dean, and the pieces clicked together.
“Longest day ever,” Castiel breathes, squirming briefly, cold toes prodding against Dean’s ankles, before finding a position he’s satisfied with; halfway on top of Dean and wearily sprawled, just melting, moulding, into Dean.
And that’s how Dean found himself grimacing as he pulled on his least leather-jacket-y jacket and pulling up to an empty parking spot in front of the art museum, forking over the twenty bucks for admission—which was highway robbery if you asked him, but it wasn’t like he had anything better to do with his money these days anyway.
“Beth,” Beth stammered.
“I can work with that,” Castiel said, and let himself be dragged into the library by a grinning and bright-eyed Dean.
Then, Castiel snorted and rolled his eyes. “Says the one who prefers their toast
“Making a scrapbook?” he had joked.
“You’d be surprised,” Castiel said.
Castiel was halfway out the lobby and refused to look back. His footsteps echoed through the halls, and when the elevator let loose with its chirping, optimistic
Slowly, carefully, avoiding the icy patches, Dean drove to the middle of the road on the street near the local schools, where the lights were most impressive, all the parents striving to prove themselves better. It was cold, the heating turned to a low rumble. Dean could just see his breath. He ejected the tape cassette of slow rock, and sat as the silence slowly engulfed them both: the Impala, bathed in shimmering red and green and sparkling with snowflakes, and him sitting quietly in the centre of it all.
Letting his arms come up and wrap around Castiel was as easy as breathing. Dean watched Castiel’s eyes fall shut, the blue behind them already etched into his memory. He followed suit, and dipped in to kiss Castiel, and his whole body sighed down to his very bones.
A moment later, he passed it to Dean.
He kisses Castiel again, just because he can. Pulls back. “So, is that a yes?”
Castiel's flower was called Angel's Breath, and Dean laughed when he read it and felt like punching the wall.
Dean knew about the journal, of course, knew about it a few measly months after they had moved in together. It must have been November or so of freshman year when Dean had stumbled across Castiel gently slipping a pale blue petunia (Charlie from the library, they had hung out as study buddies for two months before Castiel felt the flowers tugging at his throat, only to disappear another week later) into the pages.
Dean sputtered, hands coming up to wipe at his now-wet eyes. “Oh, you are
Castiel sighed into Dean’s neck. He smelled so good, here, like aftershave and skin and sweat.
He began to notice, then, everything he had been neglecting. He had been so hyperfocused on the flowers, on Hanahaki, on Cas, that he hadn’t realized that he’d passed his midterms in the blink of an eye and that the snow outside was glittering and bright and beautiful, and that, when the two of them walked outside on their daily path to their shared morning lecture, the air was fresh and crisp.
And Dean, well. Dean doesn’t really have a proper response to that. “Go back to sleep,” he says eventually, but they’re already home, the Impala steadily pulling into the garage, and Castiel smacks his lips and grumbles something incomprehensible before straightening to exit the car. His eyes are bleary and Dean sympathizes completely—it’s almost like there’s a string, pulling them towards their bedroom from the inside of the car.
Once he was mere paces from Castiel, Dean slowed, pausing to rest his hands on his knees as he caught his breath. He looked significantly more put-together than last night, eyes bright green in the sunlight, and it did nothing to squash the flutter of attraction in Castiel’s stupid head.
Castiel smiled at him again: this time coming easier, more sincere. “And your biggest, heaviest textbook, too.” He took the wolfsbane in his fingers and brought it above the book; it landed right in the middle of the front cover.
The girl noticed, and gave Dean a sharp, easy smile. “What about you, tiger? What’s your diagnosis?”
Beth was right: the love went away on its own, leaving behind nothing but the faintest sweetness that lingered in the back of his throat. The flowers never tasted the way they smelled, and there was one stall in the back of the highschool washroom where the toilet was always stuffed to the brim with a cacophony of different scents, flowers fresh and rotting spilling from the edge.
Dean turned to Castiel, the residual look in his eyes still dark and heated, and Castiel gritted his teeth at the flush that threatened to make its way up his face. He’d barely even known Dean for a minute and he already knew that he was such an
one, blue surface on a blue carpet on a blue frame, and blue, blue was everywhere and Dean couldn’t breathe.
Castiel flinched. Dean's fingers tightened for a split second before they relaxed, soothingly, pads of his fingers lightly beginning to stroke along Castiel's pulse.
In his lap, Cas turned his right hand around palm-up, then flipped it back over. Wiggled his fingers and squinted at his pinky.
Castiel’s heart clenched. He bit his lip, pausing to give the impression of consideration, but in all honesty, he’d made his choice the instant Dean had approached him over a week ago, slung an arm around him, and told him with uninhibited glee,
He was going to do it right, this time.
A pause. “What’s the dare?” Cas said.
What were they, a few tiny blossoms, to declare how Dean felt about Cas? Dean knew he loved Cas.
“That’s because I didn’t,” Dean said. “Not since. Not since high school, must have been.”
"Dean, please," Cas said.
“It’s
"Oh," Castiel said. Not, I didn't know you liked men. Not, You never told me about Benny before.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. ‘So, what are you in for?”
Bobby fixed Castiel with a look so cold the nurse next to Castiel flinched away. Castiel met it with a frost of his own. Bobby held it for another second before snorting out a curse and shaking his head.
When the door swung open to reveal nothing but the same green-eyed man, Castiel canted his head.
Dean squished his feet into the muddy grass. Thinking.
John Winchester nearly killed himself with her. Dean still remembered sleepless nights, when Sam would wake him up by crawling into bed with him, tears in his eyes and a furious quivering mouth to suppress the sobs. Remembered covering Sam’s ears when he heard the shattering of a bottle and the lost noises of rage from downstairs—the choking, the coughing, the vomiting.
"They are," Castiel said. His chest ached.
Dean found himself going back to it as he paced the room, just to see that sleepy small cat curled in the corner again, dozing without a care in the world.
He kept his eyes open and stared at the back of Castiel's head for hours and hours until it blurred into a fog of nothingness and the awful rotting stench of the wolfsbane was swimming in his head like it would never leave.
He heard footsteps from behind him, and then there was a cool glass of water being pressed to his hands while the other rubbed at his back.
“Wanna get out of here?” Dean whispers; doesn’t know why he’s whispering.
who was the one to shift closer and cling in his sleep, consistently seeking out the warmth that Benny seemed to emit like a space heater. Benny did boxing in his spare time and could bench Dean without breaking a sweat, but he also kissed Dean on the cheek and brought home wildflowers he picked on his way home from work because they reminded him of Dean.
"What can I say? I'm irresistible," Dean told Castiel once, with an exaggerated waggle of his eyebrows.
Dean laughs quietly. Halfway out, it turns into a loose, sleepy sigh. Last night, alone and annoyed and missing Castiel like crazy, Dean had sworn up and down that there was no way they
“Cas, just hold on—”
“You’re very welcome,” Castiel continued, and then raised his head to scan the crowd. “Any other questions? Maybe from the back?”
“Eh,” Dean said. “Worth it.”
The man rubbed his forehead with one hand. “My roommate,” he explained. “He ‘borrowed’” —cue quote hands— “my coat the other day. I thought he’d lost it, or forgotten to return it to me. Now I know where it really went.”
Pushing aside branches and flinching at sharp twigs dragging themselves along his skin, Castiel trudged and stomped and followed the man, who walked without hesitation, until—all of a sudden it seemed, without any indication nor signal—they were in a tunnel, surrounded by damp dark stone and so narrow Castiel’s hair brushed the top.
“Absolutely not,” Dean said, and maybe it was the hangover talking or maybe he was still a little drunk. “You always burn them. And put in way too much salt. Honestly, you’re a bit of a heathen when it comes to scrambled eggs.”
“Dean.”
Dean slowed his steps until Castiel was a pace ahead, then grabbed a handful of snow from the ground.
Cas was either on the brink of tears or the knife-edge of bursting into laughter. “That is so—
“Truth,” Cas said.
Dean punched Sam’s shoulder, hard, and withdrew it before they could start a fight. “Bitch.”
To his left, Cas had gone oddly silent.
And he was also, as he quoted, a hopeless romantic. Which Dean found sweet as well. After all, he hated his own flowers, but there was Castiel, lovingly saving each and every one of them in a photobook. It almost made Dean feel cruel in comparison with what he did with his own (which was, crudeness aside, to fuck them away.)
damn it, it wasn’t going to happen.
There was enough pride in his voice that Castiel couldn’t help but ask, “You’re close to Sam, too, then?”
As he walked closer and closer to the castle’s entrance, Castiel couldn’t help but marvel at the sheer grandness of it all. He’d grown up in a small town, likely no bigger than the castle itself and much, much less fancy, and had only heard of the stately Winchester grounds through awed murmurs and wide-eyed stories. His clothes—proper and efficient, the way a guard or knight should always dress, with no frills or buttons to get in the way of a potential fight anytime and anywhere—suddenly seemed full of tears and frays.
"A few years," Castiel murmured. (One, nearly two.)
“Dean,” Castiel said again, skidding to a stop just barely in time, nearly colliding into the gleaming metal of the car. He put his hands on the car—paused—catching his breath. Water dripping into his eyes. His hair in his mouth.
Dean blinked at it, and then looked up at Sarah. “It’s very pretty,” he tried.
"You're welcome," Castiel said, not brave enough to chance looking at Dean. He had carried his laptop from his bag to the coffee table, where it was open on Google. He typed in,
“If you’ll give me mine,” Castiel said.
“And be careful,” his mother called out right when Castiel was about to leave.
“Woah, hey,” Dean said. “I didn’t steal it or anything! It was just in the library.”
Dean nodded, and stayed still, breath held as Castiel gently picked up the frame and turned the whole thing around to face Dean.
Just relax, Dean had said. Just relax and have fun.
“Emergen-C,” Castiel muttered. “And yes, it’s in the cupboard.”
Castiel said. “I’ll go, oh my god, just stop talking before you—burst into tears and ruin your mascara or something.”
“Yeah, well, I took the stairs, so maybe I was inside the building before you, which would mean
A man was standing a mere few paces away. How had he gotten so close without Castiel hearing?
“Look him in the eye when I’m talking, I know,” Castiel interrupted. “Contrary to what you may think, I
“And you were so excited you felt like sprinting all the way home?” Cas’s voice was amused as he stepped back, Dean already missing the closeness of his body and his warmth.
“None, actually,” Dean said. “I’m waiting for my—”
Dr. Singer was a gruff-looking man with a secretly-soft heart. Castiel had volunteered at the Campus clinic a few times in his first year, and the man still recognized him as he came into the room.
Cas nodded, unbuckling his seatbelt. He maneuvered himself into a crouch, both feet on the leather seats, and reached towards the window. Mouth tightening, he lifted his right leg up and over until it was dangling out of the car.
“And most importantly—”
“Hurts,” Castiel managed, and was shocked at the pitiful whimper—was that really his own voice?
were the one who convinced me to get it!” he shouted. “You were the one
Cas nodded. “Thank you,” he said. “That was a satisfying response. I believe it’s your turn now.”
Dean had waited with his father in the waiting room. He remembered his father going through two whole packs of cigarettes in the lobby, even though his mother didn’t like it when he smoked. Dean had swung his feet whilst squirming in the hard plasticky chair, lulled to a half-awake, sleepy state by the lowly-lit, dully-humming lights. He remembered staring with a tilted head in concentration at a shiny brochure on the display across the room. There were flowers on it. Dean recognized a rose, and a daisy.
With the music gone, the rain was clear as day, pounding against the windows and smashing against the roof. Some (the drunk, high, or both ones, mostly) ran out into the rain, laughing and yelling and slipping, muddying their dresses without a care in the world.
“Thanks, sweetheart,” Dean said. “How ‘bout I take my pie and leave, then, to put you out of your suffering?” He patted Castiel’s cheek and winked. Grinning, now.
Dean’s mother never saw the point of flowers.
“But—” Dean started. “Aren’t
"That doesn't mean good, idjit," Bobby said. "You know he's been throwing up a lot more."
“Beth—” Castiel said.
He was starting to hate Wolfsbane Guy, he decided, for making Castiel feel this way.
Dean, Castiel thought, and it was like gasoline to a flame. He moaned and buried his face back into the comforting warmth that he just realized was Dean’s neck. Very slowly, he felt a hand reach up to trace its way down Castiel’s face. It took a strand of his hair and smoothed it along the back of his head in a motion so utterly careful, so tender, that it hurt even worse than if Dean had yanked it straight out from the scalp.
“Oh,” he said, stammered. “You—your Highness, my Prince—”
“I could kiss it better,” Dean said in a rush, his face suddenly hot even though it wasn’t even that warm out, the two of them sitting under the dappled shade of an oak tree.
“I’ll take your word for it,” Castiel said. “But I think I’d rather take this up into my dorm to eat.” Maybe he could even warm it up in the microwave, pile on a bit of the leftover ice cream he had in his minifridge, and God he needed that pie
Dean shrugged, and moved on. He suggested Chinese for dinner. He bargained over dish and laundry duty. He acted like nothing had changed, and in a way, nothing had. It was all in Castiel’s head: it was all him, his own thoughts, his own urges, his own desires. He had brought this upon himself, and with that thought, he was determined to shoulder this as his own burden. And if Castiel needed to excuse himself during dinner to discreetly toss out a single crumpled blossom that had escaped through his lips, well, that was his own knowledge and no one else’s.
him. Loves it, even. It’s a sentiment that should’ve been long washed away by now—they’ve been dating-not-dating for so long he can’t make heads or tails of any of it, known each other even longer. They’re
Dean laughed, a little unhinged, but what the hell, fuck it all. “I can roll with that,” he said. “How ‘bout a pizza, too?”
“It is,” the man agreed. “And I’m letting you borrow it for the day. You may return it to me tomorrow.”
"Fine," Dean said flatly, raising his eyebrows. "C'mon, spill the juicy details!"
"What?" Dean demanded immediately, a hot flash of panic running through him. "What is it?"
“How do you want me?” Dean said, and blushed.
Benny was purple, and Dean didn’t know he was into guys until he woke up in bed with him curled up on his chest. Dean teased him to no end about being a closeted cuddler, except frequent future tests proved that it was in fact
“I saw red for the first time when I saw her,” Dean said. “She was my first colour.”
“I,” Dean said. “I don’t know.”
“And you’ll remember to eat your Wheaties and brush your teeth?”
Dean just waited.
Dean stared at Castiel, his mouth slightly open.
“I see,” Castiel said. “Was it as beautiful as you hoped?”
The humour trickled out of Cas’s face. He slowly canted his head to the side, eyes growing piercing.
and before Castiel could react, Dean had already picked up a handful of snow and was furiously cramming it down Castiel’s winter jacket.
The sun was slowly creeping its way over the chimneys and treetops, glancing off the windows and momentarily blinding him. Dean tried to imagine it—soft, bright, kind of warm.
Castiel raised his head from the coffee table and squinted at Dean, eyes blinking to adjust the focus after staring at pages for so long. When he registered Dean’s words, he seemed to freeze in surprise.
“A considerate, understanding one,” Castiel said dryly.
"Absolutely not. That was a very manly chuckle." Castiel couldn't stop the bubble of laughter that rose in him at that, and felt Dean tighten his arms around him in surprise. "Now that—
Dean’s heart sank. “But—”
Dean talked about Robin and Cassie talked about Jordan and both of them talked, actually
The man arched an eyebrow. “You don’t want the guards finding the two of us sneaking through the secret tunnels, right?”
“Well, read it, dummy,” Dean said.
"My guess is you wouldn't have even realized it was there until, what was it, two weeks ago?"
Sophia moved to Chicago in grade four. Castiel hugged her goodbye. The acacias had stopped coming after three months, after Sophia had laughed at an art piece Castiel drew for Easter and Castiel realized that his handwriting, if he worked hard and was very careful, could be better than hers.
“‘Course he did,” Dean mumbles. Leave it to his brother to choose all the girly love songs.
supposed to report mishaps of any kind to the Castle immediately.”
Castiel gasped and doubled over. Dean grabbed him, grabbed his shoulders, so hard it hurt (like a candle to a forest fire) and pulled, trying to get Castiel to move. When Castiel refused, Dean yanked, and Castiel crumpled like a sheet of tinfoil.
at him.
Lisa made Dean promise to call her when she was in Princeton and Dean promised, and never spoke to her again.
and the good doctor fixed her all up until Hannah was all better, and she didn’t cough up roses any longer and she stuck her tongue out at the boy next door.
Alone.
“Hey, it’s fine,” he urged, squeezing Sam’s hand so he’d look at him. “You can go to Isobel’s to play, right? And the playground—when it’s not dinnertime, I mean.”
“What do I do now?” Cas asked.
“Intimately.”
"What if," Castiel started. Took a shallow breath. "What if I made them love me back."
—simple as that.
not true, at least. The horses do have armour, though. Chainmail. Not gold. Gold isn’t even good armour, it’s way too malleable for that. Why would they even think that?”
Cas wasn’t weird at all, Dean decided. And even if he was, it was a
"Your narcissism is truly awe-inspiring," Castiel deadpanned, trying furiously to tamper down the ache in his chest.
"Whoever it is—whoever you're hurting for. I hope they're worth it."
He took his eyes off the horizon.
I promise.”
Dean grimaced again. “Sorry. Again. Sometimes I say the wrong things at the wrong times. And sometimes I need to realize that someone isn’t flirting with me, and actually just wants his goddamn pie.”
“But when I look at your art,” Dean continued, voice growing a little hoarse from all the speaking, “I don’t see grey, either. I see a lazy cat in the sun, or children playing in the snow. It’s—it’s like happiness, and joy, and contentment, all in the shades and shadows.” He finished, and gave Castiel a tentative smile. “That’s what I think about your art.”
Castiel swung his bag off his shoulder and began to rummage for supplies. “Not really,” he said. “I prefer to work at home. It’s—quieter. More controlled. You wouldn’t believe how loud the children can get around here.”
Castiel graduated high school with a valedictorian nomination, an acceptance to his first-choice university, and a pocketful of newfound knowledge on flower types carefully preserved in a laminated photobook.
“To have someone so bold as a King,” Castiel mused. “I’m certainly curious to see how that would turn out.” Then, he added, “As soon as he actually marries, that is. Another rumour is that he refuses to choose a wife. Nor husband, for that matter.”
Castiel whistled quietly, softly, and watched the baby bird’s mouth widen with more desperation as it emitted a series of weak chirps.
“No, it’s not – never mind”, Dean sighed, turning to Charlie. He felt a nod growing on his throat. “Charlie. Hi. I’m –”
“Alright, give me the scoop”, Dean said, the phone perched on his ear, while plucking the cushions out of the couch and sticking his hand between the crevices. “What’s going on over there?”
The jacket was being kept on his bottom drawer, folded carefully, exactly as it had been since he’d last worn it. The stench of death was still impregnated into the fabric, and as he ran his fingers over the dried blood texture, it was like being there again.
“Yeah, that’s one of the things Aunt Amara wants to fix up. She keeps saying how Chuck was not a very creative writer”, Jack grimaced.
It all felt distant. Like a different life altogether. “I’m retired, brother. I have a beautiful house in California. I have my toes in the sand. I have my fruity drinks with as many umbrellas as I want. I have my kid. I have my ball and chain. The auto-shop is coming along nicely…this stuff, over there, it’s not my life anymore. It’s yours. You’re the Big Boss Man, now. It’s your legacy. And if you think what you’re doing is helping, if you think what you’re doing is making things better…”
“What do you think?

“I don’t know. Probably in a dungeon somewhere with that sleazy old man – what’s his name? Ketch, I guess.”
happened”, it said, spitefully. “He blew up, all over me. Took a while, but the place started to crack up, now look how it is! The other one – God – he promised he’d fix it up if I let him take Lucifer out, but you people don’t know how to keep your promises, do you?”
“Because you are the most powerful witch in the world, Rowena, if someone can do it, it’s you”, Sam pleaded.
“What other side?”
curious about the life her boys had led.
“His idea or Jody’s?” Dean asked, while crouching between the coffee table and the armchair, his knees complaining all the way down.
She scoffed. “Dean, are you serious? There’s like ten people there.”
“Hello, Uncle Crowley. Good to see you back at the land of the living”, Amara said, before they could make their exit, stage left.
“The Anomaly!”
Sam sighed. He knew the question was coming. “It’s actually going great. We’ve been helping a lot of people.”
“And you all just decided to get together here? You all have a shared heaven?”
Dean couldn’t help but take a peek. You know, if it wasn’t for Cas… “He sure does.”
Neither brother was sure what they had expected to see, but it was certainly not this.
“We found a lot of people”, Ellen corrected. “We’re not the only ones realizing this heaven situation isn’t ideal. People are grouping up. The thinner the walls are, the more people pass through.”
, Dean Winchester, even for you. The kid’s not even dead!”
Now that there was no threat lingering and everybody was returned home, she had moved back into the bunker. She wasn’t expecting her first day back to involve getting trampled on by her brother-in-law.
The three of them shared an uncertain look. “That… certainly makes things easier for us”, Dean said, stepping through.
“The what now?” Dean squinted.
“Y-Yes”, Jack said, hesitant. “The Shadow was looking for me. That’s why Cas made the deal in the first place.”
She led them along the way through the many corridors of letter ‘A’s, down to the ‘As’, and then ‘Ash’s, until they landed on an unexpected hallway. “His name is Ash…ley Simpson?” Sam squinted.
“Aren’t we always?” Sam smiled.
came the murmur from the back. A lot of disappointment among the ranks.
“I love you, bitch.”
“What other basement do you think he crawled out of?” she snickered.
“Not every wall needs a deer head mounted to it, Billy”, Mary said, rolling eyes.
“You do?” Sam and Jack asked, in unison.
“It doesn’t matter if I approve or not, Sam”, Dean interrupted. While ravaging through the drawers in the nightstand, he found several familial trinkets – a postcard from Adam and Michael, who’d taken a sabbatical from Heaven and left with his former vessel to explore the world, both so that they could get to know it better and to adjust to his new age they had been brought back into (Adam complained a lot about people thinking they were twins; Michael had gone into perhaps too vivid details all the places he’d been inside Adam now that he didn’t need to
“W-O-W! Now that’s what I’m talking about!” The Shadow said, running its hands overs its head and down its neck. It had abandoned Cas’ likeness and taken Jack’s instead, though its eyes were apparently stuck on their golden form.
“And who’s the guy?” Sam asked.
“He left it before, he can do it again. If not, we – Jack can do it. If Chuck could bring Lucifer back, Jack can –”
Above them, on the ceiling, there was a crack. A gateway. It was not golden like the others had been before; it was pitch black, and if they listened closely enough, they could hear the distance sound of humming coming through.
“He’s not dead, he’s just powerless”, Jack clarified. “I’m technically him, now, actually. It’s really is a long story.”
helping things – the new family business.”
“Charlie and Bobby are still coping with having doppelgängers, and that is going… well. She’s still around, the two Charlies have been updating Ash on new tech. They’ve been trying to explain Windows 10 to him.”
“Monsters
“Hello, Dean”, she said, her eyes flashing black. “Wish I could say it’s nice seeing you.”
books!” Charlie squealed. “You guys should really read them, you were all there! You should especially read The Man Who Would Be King. It’s told through Cas’ point of view. It’s
Bela took them to Rowena’s throne room – it wasn’t like she could say no to the Almighty, anyway – and while the Queen of Hell was more than eager to help them out, there was also very little that she could
“You know the saying, Castiel”, it said, tightening its grip. “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on you again for thinking I’d fall for it. Besides…” it cast him aside, pinning him down on the floor. “If you’re awake, it’s because someone woke you up. All I have to do is wait until they come looking for you.”
“I already looked through most of what Rowena left me”, Sam said. “Didn’t find anything about the Empty on them. But…” he paused, tongue between teeth. “Nick got his spell to open a rift from demons last time… and she’s the queen of Hell. Maybe she can help.”
“What about – what about dad? I thought you were in a heaven together”, Sam asked.
“Are your brothers and sisters, who for some reason listen to you, going back to sleep?”
Dean reached out around his neck, feeling the weeding present he’d gotten. Sure they had the rings, but the vial hanging at the end of the silver chain, containing Cas’ grace… that meant much more to him. With the angels back, his powers had gone back to normal, but still, he’d chosen to become human – for Dean, with Dean, in sickness and health; in life and death and beyond.
Sam scratched the back of his head. “Yeah, you could say that.”
The Shadow tilted its head, raising an eyebrow from Castiel’s side of its face. “You
“Yeah. He looks good in a cowboy hat, huh?”
“Of course I should! I’m not leaving you again, Cas. Not now, not ever! Cas, I–”
“What happened to dad?” Gabriel added.
“The other universes, Clarence. Keep up.”
There was silence once the four came through. Anael stayed back, closing the door behind them. “Oh, shit. Did you guys already die again?” Kevin asked.
He clenched his jaw tight, but didn’t answer. “We need to talk to her. Where is she?”
For those angels, up until that point, they had only inhabited vessels – a necessity rather than a want. There had always been, whether they liked or not, some disconnect between their own selves and the bodies they occupied, in the same way a puppet and a hand are not one and the same.
“I’ll be right back.”
“I don’t know, but I’ll try”, Jack said. He pressed his fingers over the handprint, clearing his mind – through all the voices, all the prayers, all the beings he felt connected to, he reached out to one in particular. “Castiel”, he called out, to the vastness of the universe. “Castiel”, he called again, past the stars, the planets, into the void and beyond. “Father.”
“Probably not.”
“So what, now? Are we just supposed to leave Cas rotting in that place forever?” Dean asked. He could feel the anger boiling inside him – that red hot furnace brimming underneath his skin, ready to explode.
“This is the end.” Cas explained. “Of reality. Of everything.”
?” Dean said, squinting.
“Fine with me”, she said, taking Tessa’s hands. With that, they and the other reapers were gone.
things. I’m talking about you, dear”, she said, brushing her fingers against his chin. “Think of all the good you could do, Sam. Not having to worry about hunters dying because they have resurrecting hexbags made by you with them; protecting charms, locating spells, cloaking incantations… think of all the good you could do for the monsters as well.”
“Why can’t you just put me to sleep?” he asked, forcing himself on his feet.
“At least you guys found each other here”, Sam said, with a stiff smile.
He tumbled out of the room, faster than his legs would allow him, towards his bedroom. Eileen was almost knocked out on her ass by Hurricane Dean as she came out of her room – well, Sam’s room, rather, but there was very little difference.
“Not any time soon, it seems.”

“So? Hunter. College boy. Psych. Special Child. Boyking. Vessel. Men of Letters. Witch. Straight. Gay. Bi. Man. Woman. Those are all just
“It’s complicated.”
“The ones he created, yes, but do you really think he was the only one? Don’t you think there was something
The Empty was far from what Dean had envisioned from Cas’ and Jack’s descriptions: it looked more like a place of torment than hell, with the cracks widening and the people – many of whom he recognized, for better or worse – slowly sinking into black quicksand. Some were up to their knees, or their hips, or their elbows, or even their chests. Many tried to grab upwards, towards something that wasn’t there, pleading for help.
“Apparently it
“Good”, Eileen replied.
happen here. We figured it was probably from someone who was resurrected, except, according to our adorable redhead over there, the guy it belongs to has never actually died, so that doesn’t seem to be the case.”
Maybe she did not have to carry it alone.
Billie looked to her right, to Tessa, who’d extended a hand to her. She paused for a moment, hesitant; weighing in her options, and the possibilities. She knew what the ring meant – what it represented – what it demanded. What it could do to someone. It was not a gift, it was a burden.
It rang again immediately. Dean silenced his phone.
Dean did, and thought that he had never felt this self-conscious about the way he sat before. He crossed his legs, then uncrossed them, then stuck his hands in his pockets before withdrawing them and clasping them in his lap before dropping them to the side of the chair, where they hung limply like a cooked noodle.
Cas shook his head again, stronger, and Dean suppressed a sigh.
Castiel did, and something the new Castiel did differently instead. He stopped feeling a little like throwing up (again) and a lot like screaming every time he saw another tiny white flower fall out of his mouth. He stopped thinking of Cas as
Her name was Beth and they made eye contact as they both approached their respective microphones and Sam had completely lost head or tail of every word in his argument on abortion rights in favour of staring at the ribbons in her hair.
“Of course not, ma’am,” Dean said, stumbling over his shock of
Dean was stripping his mattress for his monthly full-bed wash (something Castiel always insisted on doing, especially when Dean kept getting into his bed without changing his clothes, Honestly, Dean, do you even
with Sam.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said again. It was all he could say.
“Only a tiny bit now,” Cas replied.
Got it?”
Castiel said. “I liked the cat, so I drew a cat. I saw kids sledding down a hill, so I drew kids sledding down a hill. Not very complicated.”
“Cas,” Dean said quietly.
"How bad is it?" Castiel asked.
Dean kicked at a tire out of nervous habit, hands shoved into his pockets.
“Um,” Dean whispered. Raised a hand that hovered and flitted anxiously inches above Cas’s trembling back, like a moth darting around a flame. “Hello?”
“Pleased to meet you,” Castiel said.
The Q+A was just beginning to wrap up, with the crowd slightly dispersing and making their individual ways back to whichever gallery they had been admiring when they left off. Castiel was still at his place, speaking to one of the museum curators off to the side. Navy blue tie and grey blazer.
Dean laughed again, and leaned in out of instinct, out of weeks-months-years of yearning.
Castiel couldn’t help but be just a little curious, albeit quite worried on top of it all. He was meant to protect him, after all. And judging from what he’s heard, Prince Dean wasn’t going to be easy to protect.
Dean’s hair was still speckled with snow—there was a steady flurry outside, had been since last night, one of the first snowfalls of the season. There was frost embedded on his eyelashes, and some had already melted into tiny dewy drops that sparkled in the light as he blinked. His face was flushed from the cold, and as he approached, Castiel caught an icy whiff of the outside air, fresh and clear.
“Dean,” Castiel said, and something in the inflection made Dean finally, blessedly, shut up.
“That still wasn’t fair,” Dean said when Cas smiled again, infuriatingly. Dean’s arm throbbed in agreement.
Dean withdrew his hand from his father’s sleeve, tentatively. “Um,” he said, and then stopped.
It started with a car.
"Oh, my god," Dean said, voice hushed.
“What?” Castiel whispered.
He reached out and punched Dean on the arm, hard enough to send a frisson of pain sparking down his wrist. He hit his funny bone, the asshole.
Bobby’s face was pale, withdrawn, his age even clearer on his face than usual. Dean ran up to him and grabbed his shoulders so tightly his knuckles turned white. “Bobby, tell me he’s okay, tell me, please.”
“What?” Sam muttered.
Castiel waited. It didn’t take long for Dean to exhale a light, “Oh,” in realization.
“No,” Dean said. “I guess not.”
So his suspicions weren’t unjustified, after all. Dean reciprocated with a faint, wry smile.
Dean laughed. “Yeah, it did,” he said, and then jogged over to the bus, the coat flapping in the breeze. He added the number in his phone as
“Castiel?” Dean said—the only thing he could think of.
“But, Dad.”
It’s been hours and hours. The balls of his feet are aching, complaining up to the nines and he’s sure he’ll have callouses tomorrow where the heel rubs up with every step. His eyes, closed, breathe an exhausted sigh of relief. They choose to remain closed, would prefer to stay closed, actually, for the rest of tonight. Preferably in a bed. With Castiel next to him. Right this instant. Dean’s not as young as he used to be, and he’s never felt it more acutely. But there are guests to politely chase away and leftover food to pack and store in the fridge for morning-afters and glitter to sweep off the floor, so when the song inevitably draws to an end, he counts to three before reluctantly pulling open his eyelids. Castiel gazes back at him, blue eyes hazy with the same thoughts.
The rest of the prom passed in a flurry. He danced with Meg some more. Went to the washroom. Chugged three glasses of water and stole a few pretzels from the snack bowls. Danced with some faintly-recognizable others, Meg doing the same, the two of them coming to a mutual agreement as the music dove into the fun and funky along with the slow and loving alike.
“Sounds good to me,” Castiel said, and his hand was still on Dean’s back, rubbing small circles. Dean paused for long enough that Castiel noticed. Hastily, he withdrew it.
“Cas,” Dean said again, throat pinhole tight and trying to hide the desperation in his voice. “Pick one.”
They stayed up way too late and ate way too much pie, and watched way too much shitty Spanish soap operas for no motive other than to laugh at and make up fake dialogue for (Dean could do an impressive falsetto), and this time it was Dean who fell asleep on the couch and Castiel who was in charge of picking up all the trash and storing the rest of the leftover pie in the fridge.
“No, thank you,” Tom said, with an easy, friendly smile. Castiel felt an eyebrow raise at that. Friendly. Friendly was good—normally. Friendly wasn’t good when they were on a supposed date.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Castiel was supposed to crash into Dean on the first day of Grade One, both of them too enamoured with their respective imaginations to pay attention to their surroundings, both of them casting dirty looks and elementary insults until the teacher had to force them apart. They were supposed to be sworn mortal enemies until Grade Two, when Brady Weinhart from the class next door deliberately tripped Castiel during recess and Castiel skinned his knee and cried, and Dean took him to the teacher to get a band-aid and then told everyone about that one time Brady peed his pants in the changeroom. They formed an alliance, then, one that blossomed into something deeper by the time they entered middle school and thick as thieves by the time they sidled into Freshman year. They were supposed to be best friends—
Dean gave Castiel the look that said don’t play dumb. “The person you’ve been throwing up flowers for in the past month.”
Cas sniffed again. Nodded. His fingers, trembling.
"I know. I love you too. I have to go, now, the elevator's closing and I just know it’ll be up there for ages and ages before it comes back down again—I'll call you!"
“We have – there is someone we need to –”
“Oh, bollocks.”
are”, Charlie corrected, stepping forward. She kicked Ash’s couch on the way. “Wake up, sleepyhead.”
“What?”
Bobby and Rufus were locked in a game of pool, while Ellen and another man – a gruff-looking fella, salt-and-pepper hair, that could look like he had just quit being sheriff in
“Exactly. Now, if I remember correctly, the Empty exists outside of reality. It can’t just come into this plane unprompted.”
“They’ll go back to their own heavens, for the time being, while we do some reforms around. With more angels, things will be easier. I already have some plans – Uncle Crowley used to watch this show with me, about these four people torturing each other in some sort of hell, and I think he was looking for inspiration, but I didn’t get around to finishing it, but then, last year, with Chuck gone, actually sat down and –”
“That’s putting it mildly.” He rolled eyes. “Last time we were inside. How are we going to find Ash now?”
He went along with his siblings, but not before casting one last look at his aunt. There was a sense of… perhaps understanding between them. Not forgiveness, certainly not tenderness, but they knew they could count on one another moving forward, for the betterment of Heaven.
“Huh? What? No, I didn’t do it!” Ash shouted, jumping on his feet. He squinted at the newcomers with mild surprise. “Oh, it’s you guys. Did you die again?”
Naomi stepped to the side, opening a door for them. The angels looked around, reluctantly; did they have any other option? One by one, they went ahead.
“Ours”, Dean corrected, wrapping an arm around Cas’ shoulder. He didn’t understand what was going on – he didn’t have the faintest clue of what could possibly be going on between these three – but at least that much he knew.
”, Amara cleared her throat. “That she is doing a fairly good job, keeping Hell in line – so you better fall in line as well. Understood?”
here?” Sam asked.
“All souls? You mean, all ghosts on Earth?” Eileen asked.
“What do you mean, ‘you’ve tried’?” Dean asked. He put his bottle away, turning towards the boy.
Dean reached up, tentatively, and into the passage.
“No, it’s just him”, she answered.
“Long story.”

“No, idiot. She’s reforming hell. Reviewing old demon contracts. She saw
He stepped back, throwing her one last look before she returned to her throne. Queen of Hell… that was something he’d never get used to.
“One day at a time, I know”, he said, picking up a stuffed giraffe from the floor on the way upstairs. “How’s mom?”
me?” the Shadow laughed. It melted down onto the floor, as another crack spread around them, red light peering through the darkness. “You think this is a joke, Castiel?” it called, its voice coming from all sides. Before any of them could realize it, their feet were sinking down, shadows wrapping themselves around their ankles; the floor pulled them down the more they struggled, swallowing them up. Castiel fought against the dark tentacles wrapping around his body, to no avail. “Well, I’m about to be
* * *
“This place is a mess and half”, Dean said, the moment his eyes adjusted to the brightness of the new corridor.
It was a lifetime in a minute, and then it was done.
“So much faith”, he laughed, throwing aside a chewed rattle. “How about the others? How’s everyone else doing?”
“Oh, honey, we’re well past that”, at her side, Billie laughed. “See, Castiel? This is what happens when you mess with the natural order of things.”
– were tending to the bar. Jo and Charlie, the original Charlie, were swapping notes in a corner, lost in thought, while Mary Winchester and Kevin Tran sat at the counter, each with a beer in hand.
“Yeah, but Dean –”
“No, Dean Winchester, that is not what I
“Well, yeah, me and Aunt Amara are trying, but there’s a lot of things we need to work on”, Jack explained.
“You mean Ash?” Dean asked. “But that was different.”
It stepped closer, until they were face to face. Cas could feel its hand – cold, colder than a dead man’s grip – wrapping around his throat. “Let me go. I can talk to God. We can fix this”, he pleaded.
“If God doesn’t know the spell, why would Rowena? One of them is supposed to be All-Knowing, and it’s not her”, Dean said, gesturing downwards.
The new chapter of their lives was just starting out, and now they were the ones who’d get to write it… together.
“Good boy.”
“Friend is not the word I’d use for someone you leave to die after they
“Oh, I am so not letting him live this down!” Dan laughed. “And he’s not even alive anymore.”
“You’re a

about helping me out. If it weren’t for Rowena…”
“We don’t owe you –” Anael started, but Amara raised her hand. She had a smile in the corner of her lips.
“Heaven must have one for the Empty as well”, Sam filled in.
“Never mind that. Wait, hold on, if he wrote more books, does that mean that
“Could I have a moment with Samuel before you head off into the next part of your quest?” Rowena requested. “Alone?”
That was the others’ department. Dean only had one in mind.
? You had
“Oh, please, don’t tell me you’re gonna start crying on me”, she rolled eyes. “Yes, I died. Brutally. Not so much fridged as bath-tubbed. At least you took care of those sons of bitches for me, didn’t you?”
“I was in a memory with your father, yeah, but… I never found him here. After everything, I’m not really sure he
He stepped aside, letting the Shadow approach. “Yay, let’s have some fun!” it said, grasping both sides of Jack’s face. As it sunk its fingers in, they tilted their heads back in sync and screamed; bolts of bright white light exploded out of their eyes and mouths, spreading forward and around them, until they consumed all of their surroundings.
Sam and Dean shared a look. They didn’t know the half of it.
!” the Shadow spat out, clapping its hands. “You came here, and you blew all over me – and not even in the fun way! And you made this place loud and unbearable! I can hear them – the Other Ones – they are coming, and they are coming fast! But I’m going to eat you up, and I’m going to stop all of this, and then I’m going back to sleep again.”
“Fuck,” Dean said, looking at him, and before he even knew what he was doing he was stepping forward and wrapping himself around Castiel in a hard hug. Castiel froze, then melted, burrowing closer as if he wished to disappear right into Dean’s chest.
Dean himself didn’t see a colour until he was sixteen, and even then it was very nearly a mistake. In fact, it began with one—it wasn’t as if he was
“It’s not even bleeding.” Cas’s mouth was set to a petulant pout. “I don’t want to be a baby.”
“That sounds good,” Castiel said, right as the creak and hiss of the bus engine rolled up to the side of the street.
Dean fell easily in step. He let Cas speak about exams and colleges and the latest book he was reading, and counted down the minutes in his head until
“It’s okay, Cas,” Dean repeated, each time more determined than the last. It became a subconscious mantra, his words coming out without thought, continuing to rub the boy's back. He made himself comfortable next to him, ignoring the sensation of mud seeping into his socks as he scooted closer.
“No,” he said.
Less than three months. And then—
“Oh, yeah?” Dean snorted. “You can’t even reach the shelves, pipsqueak. And I’m the one who makes you food all the time. What are you gonna make her? Bread from the bag?”
Castiel smiled, but with a hint of an edge. “I’m the original painter, I don’t think they can argue all too much.”
“That—doesn’t—even—make sense,” Castiel said, squirming and yelling and sputtering, but his laughter was breathless and bright and Dean grinned so hard his cheeks hurt.
Beer bottles were green, a deep, dreadful green, and Dean soon grew nauseous every time he saw that particular shade. He attended his first AA meeting with a riotous stomach and a pounding anxiety headache, and came out six months later with a sobriety chip that he stuck into his duffle pocket—and of
“Weird name.”
The bare skin on his arms prickled with the cold, complaining in the black t-shirt he’d haphazardly thrown on that morning, and Dean shoved his hands into his jean pockets.
“Dean,” Castiel chastises, but there’s a smile tugging at his lips and Dean wants, so badly, to lean in and kiss it. So he does. It’s amazing that he can do that at all—still knocks him off his feet that he can do things like this and Castiel just
Castiel glanced at him, and to Dean’s surprise he was smiling. “Don’t be sorry,” he said. “After all, it wasn’t because of anything bad. And you’re wrong: I do want to remember it. It was so painful because of love, don’t you see? All of it, in equal proportions. If anything, it was beautiful.”
He was hellbent on waking up at 7 in the morning every day, rain or shine, classes or not, weekday or end, which in Dean’s mind made him a bit of a masochist if not insane, and he tried to make pancakes one morning and Dean woke up to his room slowly filling with smoke, but he was just unreal at folding clothes (seriously. He could take a trenchcoat and do some magic until it was nothing but a tiny, neat square) and he never complained about Dean’s socks on the floor (he just started picking them up quietly himself, until Dean felt so guilty that he eventually kicked the habit that Sam, in all of fourteen years, could not kick) and when Dean bombed his Chemistry quiz, he had taken all of Dean’s notes and pored through each and every word with those solemn dark blue eyes of his drilling straight into Dean’s soul.
"That’s fine," Castiel interrupted with a smile. He dragged his luggage through the door, and deposited it on his side of the carpet before studying the rest of the room. Dean had arrived early, as far as he could tell, and was almost finished unpacking—posters littered the walls, and a closet was stocked up with a faceful of flannel.
The Impala lurched.
“Oh,” Dean said, and clasped his hands in his lap again.
She looked utterly, completely exhausted, but raised her head upon hearing Castiel’s entrance, and even had the courtesy leftover to pipe up with a quiet, “Hi there! Happy Pi Day!”
“Oh.” Castiel floundered. “I have some utensils up in my dorm, maybe—”
A pause. “Prince Dean Winchester, huh?”
"That's a violation of my privacy," Castiel said stiffly.
Dean nodded swiftly. “Drink that. It’s flu season; better watch out. You know how easily you get sick.”
“Oh,” Dean said. “That’s okay, Sammy.” He sat down next to him and grabbed the newspaper, rolling it up before setting it aside and turning back to Sam with a superior big-brother air. “You see, Sammy, Hanahaki is when you get sick, and you throw up flowers.”
Dean flushed just a little, and then regained himself, turning to glance at the rows of posters for a refresher. “I think your subjects are simple,” he said. “Not very introspective. But the way you paint them, the shades you pick and the lines you draw—that’s what makes it really special. The way it gives off such a strong, vibrant mood with just shades of grey. Which, that part is also really nice—that you only paint with black and white.”
“It’s okay,” Castiel said, and his head was in the clouds, now, or maybe trampled neatly underneath Dean’s boots along with all the flowerbuds. “You thought I was flirting?”
Castiel swallowed, stared, and had a moment of blinding epiphany. “I’m a mess, aren’t I? The whole time during dinner, all I talked about—” He cut off in a gasping inhale and felt shame, hot and heavy, on his eyelids. “I’m so sorry I put you through this.”
Dean couldn’t blame him. Soulmates—or at least, something close to it after all. They weren’t one in a lifetime, as many would expect, but more like one in a million out of an average of a dozen in a lifetime—still harsh enough that when Dad banged and swore at the door, Dean was the one to coax him away, and Dean was the one to quietly slide in breakfast and lunch and dinner through the smallest crack.
“Punch—” he began to say, and got one word in before there was a triumphant-sounding
“I mean that things aren’t obviously the best at the moment,” Dean said. In for a penny, in for a pound; it all came tumbling out. “And I guess the Bunker is pretty cool to us, but you were a freaking
Castiel smiled.
In Economics class, he finally summoned enough courage to give his group project partners a piece of his mind. It was met with a shocking compliance—Adam even offered to give Castiel a bag of weed as apology, which, in Adam’s language, pretty much was on level par with a love declaration.
“Maybe we should,” Castiel mumbled, the frayed edge of his patience finally proving to be reaching the end of its line.
I should get him a blanket, Dean thought. Instead, he stumble-walked over to the couch and dropped to his knees so that he was face-to-face with Cas.
"Because you let me borrow that jacket last week," Castiel said. "It was snowing really hard and my sweater was in the wash. Remember?" Dean had insisted, shoving the bundle of dark green canvas into Castiel's protesting hands without accepting no for an answer. It had been scratchy on the back of Castiel's neck where the tag wasn’t cut, but it was heavy and hot and smelled like Dean, and Castiel had burrowed his nose into the collar with the pretence that it was snowing too hard and the wind stung his face. The lump in his throat, the stirring in his chest, had been an old friend at that point, but Castiel had long grown sick of the saccharine scent, and the spice of Dean’s jacket masked it perfectly.
Castiel’s heart ached so much. “Go back to sleep,” he finally said, too drained to hide the cracks in his voice anymore. “Can we just go back to sleep?”
By the time Castiel started preparing the paints, mixing them on the palette in smooth, steady strokes, Dean’s legs had gone numb beneath him, but he didn’t think of moving an inch. Through the sounds of the brush moving across the canvas, hushed and hissing like dry grass in the wind, Dean lost track of time.
On the other end of the line, Sam chuckled. “Nothing, really. Everything’s been pretty calm, all things considered.”
“Or maybe, you idiots, you can just look up”, Bobby suggested.
That was not a question worth answering.
“So?”
“You should
I was sent to hell in the first place, but since she couldn’t exactly send me upstairs… she gave me a job. Beats being tortured, doesn’t it, Dean?”
, he heard Crowley say, but he chose to ignore that.
“As much as I like how that sounds, these people –”
say she wanted to get to know me, and she already spent so long locked up, I didn’t think it was fair to do that to her again, so… I let her out”, he shrugged. “She’s… hard at work.”
“No,” Castiel said.
"You'll call us when you're all settled down, won't you?" his father said.
“Really,” Castiel said when Dean narrowed his eyes. “Just a cough.”
Dean hated himself for even thinking about it. Every time the thread, tendril, of thought popped into his mind, he would flinch and his gut would twinge like someone stuck a screwdriver down there as hard as they could. But he couldn't help it—oh god, he couldn't help it.
“I don’t know what to do,” Dean said again. Was he shaking?
"Hello?" he approached tentatively. No response. He came closer, spoke louder. "Hello?"
“You better,” Dean said cheerfully. “I’ll see you around, Maggie.”
“Yeah, like that. Then, well—then I give you a dare.”
"Stage two," Singer said, "heading for three."
“I could ask you the same thing,” Castiel said. There was something off with his voice—odd, stilted with the effort of holding himself back—and he’d just noticed, saw Dean notice it too, his fluttering hands going still on his shoulders.
But there was Cas right now, in Bobby’s office, the two of them in hushed whispered tones, and once Dean had an idea it just wouldn’t go away—something that made him a stellar student when he wanted to, nag and nag and nag until he had dissected it apart into pieces right in front of him—and as Dean paced back and forth and waited, the idea itched until it was impossible to ignore and bloomed into a full-fledged tsunami in his head.
Twelve years of this.
Castiel remained still for a moment, long enough to hear the slightly muffled, “Come on!” through the leaves, and then cursed to himself and shoved his way into the bushes.
But that was all just fine. It was 10PM and all Castiel wanted to do was to go home, take a half-addled shower, and fall into a blissful sleep before his 8AM classes the next morning reset the cycle all over again.
John was quiet for a moment, and then he sighed. “Listen, son—she sounds great. She really does. But we need to move, pronto, and unless you can convince her to go on the run with us, there’s really nothing we can do here.”
Dean grinned, and then, with trepidation in his eyes, leaned in to kiss Castiel again. Castiel tilted his head and wound his arms around Dean and kissed him back and thought that this was
“Surgery,” Bobby declared.
“I always liked that one,” someone said behind him.
He laughed sharply, but it came out more of a choke. “I know all of that but I loved you anyway, and now I find out that you, you didn’t get the surgery in full, that it wasn’t a clean break? I don’t know what to do, Cas. I just don’t know what to do.”
“You dared me to lick the neighbour’s dog my first time!”
“I think so,” he declared, and gave Dean the brightest smile yet. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Emily,” Dean would read, and Castiel would reply obediently, “Daffodils. She was my lab partner in Chemistry.”
“Hmm. Like?”
“You’ve had this many?” Dean reached out to touch each of the flowers delicately, as if they were something cherished. (They were.)
“Kiss me again.”
Castiel remained stubbornly silent. Dean waited a few seconds, and then sighed.
“Is including another person in the dare allowed?” Cas asked before Dean could say anything.
It was enough. This was enough. It was enough that he was there for Dean with every break-up, there for Dean with every blossoming crush, by his side when his mom died in that awful car crash and he didn’t come to school for a month but opened the door every time Castiel knocked. Enough that Dean learned to shimmy up rain gutters to climb through Castiel’s windows when he was grounded, studied his ass off for a subject he hated just to quiz Castiel back and forth for his SATs, drove them three hours out to the lakes to celebrate when he got into his first choice university. These next few months were precious and had never been so delicate, and Castiel would never need to be this careful, never a misstep allowed in fear of shattering this halcyon thing they’ve built together over the last dozen years. And that meant helping Lisa plan the perfect promposal, because Dean kept talking on and on about a slow-dance under the stars outside of the venue and, through all the girls Dean had dated, Lisa was the one Dean talked about the most. It meant debating, arguing, protesting, smiling through Dean’s double-date setup. It meant dancing with Meg and convincing himself that he could be okay.
When Dean was in fourth grade, a girl named Sarah with pigtails and a pink puffy jacket walked up to him shyly and showed him something in her hand. It was a flower.
“Let the girl decide herself, Cas,” Dean drawled. Castiel glared icily and struggled to control himself from taking the tin of pie and smashing it into Dean’s face, because then he wouldn’t have the pie to eat which was rightfully his,
"Meeting with a friend," Castiel said, not dishonestly.
it’s classic modernist literature, just because it was written by a girl doesn’t make it
He turned off the television and went to the bedroom to fetch an extra blanket. When he returned, Dean had curled himself deeper into the corner of the couch, snuggling the arm as if it were a person with his face smashed into the material, snoring so quietly it could almost be called snuffling.
The dinner passed uneventfully. Castiel ordered the parmesan chicken and thought that tasted nothing like Dean’s. The music they were playing in the restaurant was some awful modern-day pop that would probably make Dean gag himself with the soup spoon. When the waiter came with the bill, Castiel remembered when he’d gotten a part-time job at a fast food place a few months ago, and Dean had gone through the drive-thru eight times in one night just to say hello and bought eighty chicken nuggets that went stale in the fridge.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean said. “Truth or Dare?”
Cas shifted until he was pressed close to Dean’s side, body radiating heat in a way that almost felt unnatural—something to do with the trailing vestiges of angel grace, maybe, the lingering effect of containing so much raw energy in a single human body—lifted his hands, steady as a rock, to wrap his fingers right around Dean’s.
“I won’t chicken or tap out,” Cas declared, voice settling on stubbornness.
“Save it,” she said, a tired smile playing across her face. “Just do me a favour and don’t spend it on any more drugs, okay?”
It dawned on him after a moment that Castiel was teasing when his eyebrows lifted higher, the corners of his lips curling up as if he were trying to fight back a laugh.
“Oh,” Castiel said. “Good.” A beat. “I don’t think you ever got Hanahaki disease until now. Or, since I met you, I suppose.”
“We were just curious, Mom,” Dean added.
“I’ll…” Dean thought for a moment. “I’ll buy a catapult. And I’ll catapult it all the way up—
And if he had to excuse himself from this seat so that he could use the washroom for the umpteenth time, or if he had to discreetly cough into a napkin with the pretence of a chicken bone in the pasta, Castiel didn’t let it go to his head.
“Remember what I said about the principal,” she warned.
Even Castiel noticed. “You haven’t had the flowers in a while,” he pointed out one day, when they were taking a stroll outside and enjoying the crisp air of a winter being chased relentlessly by a slow, creeping spring.
The man gave him a bit of a helpless look. “Remember when I said I was a close friend of Dean?”
Dean barely has a mind to flip back the covers before Castiel dives into bed, swaddles himself into the blankets and curls up next to Dean with a happy sigh.
“It’s so fucking bad,” Dean said, and was he crying—“It’s so fucking bad. Please. No one is worth this.”
“You need to,” Dean started. “The couch—”
“Everyone at the whole goddamn school knows,” Dean muttered. “She wasn’t exactly subtle.” He scoffed, and then shook his head a little, shaking it off; when he spoke again, it was with a lighter inflection. “Besides, you’re as oblivious as a brick. Covered in mud.”
“See it?” Castiel finished, with a sparkle in his eye. “Of course you can, Dean, it’s of you after all.”
“Jesus,” Dean breathed (Cas couldn’t be in love with him, not him, Dean was supposed to be easy smiles and casual fucks and someone no one should, would, fall in love with—Cas was soft eyes and an even softer touch with kindness pure enough to rival a riptide and he barrelled through Dean’s defences and broke his number one rule, and now he was paying for it with millions and millions of flowers. It was all Dean’s fault.)
Sam always liked cats; had begged for a dog when he was a child but when they stumbled across a tiny calico in a cardboard box in Idaho, had fed her milk with his finger and cried when John wouldn’t let him take her to Kansas.
“What’s obvious?” That impending sense of doom, like stormclouds before they broke and spilled over the earth.
“Thanks again for letting me borrow this,” Dean said as he got up from the bench, putting the coat back on and feeling the warmth creep back into him (although he didn’t really need it now—somehow, he’d all but forgotten about the cold). “Oh, and, by the way—it does look pretty straight.”
“I’m a friend of the Prince,” he finally said.
the one who tops.”
He punched Cas back, as hard as he could muster when it was
“Yes, m—yeah. Okay.”
you,” Cas said, sounding confused.
Dean smiled. Cas smiled back.
Dean said, feeling too hot all over.
“She went home with Steven,” Dean said, eyes dropping for just a moment before coming back up. “Now answer me. Where’s Meg?”
He came to a rather unsurprising conclusion. Castiel resolved to end this, and end it quickly. It was a crush, that was all. After all, Dean was funny, and thoughtful, and caring, and devastatingly sweet when you really knew him—and excruciatingly off limits. Castiel was going to finish coughing up whatever flowers had grown in his lungs already, and then he was going to brace himself and firmly, soundly get over it.
“Because I didn’t approach you at the gift shop because your eyes were green. I did because I wanted to get to know you—to talk to you—and because there’s something about you that makes me want to tell you everything about me.”
“It’s not that bad,” Castiel whispered, lips pressed against Dean’s t-shirt where he could feel the warmth of his skin.
“I love it, Dean,” she said. “It has all the beauty of a flower, and you didn’t even need to go outside.”
Lisa's flower had made Dean panic in a heady, hot-headed way. He remembered Dad—remembered cutting his foot on broken glass on the carpet.
wanted that pie. Anyway, I shouldn’t have taken it from you. You totally earned that pie. It wasn’t even that good, it was all cold and mushy and the whole time I was eating it I just felt really bad because you’re probably the cutest guy I’ve ever seen at campus in all my four years and I just blew my chances because of a stale mediocre slice of pie.”
“You’re ridiculous.”
Cas made a small sound. Quickly withdrawing his hand, Dean said, “Sorry. I’m sorry.”
“Oh,” Beth said, stammering.
“I said leave me alone.”
“My turn,” Dean said. “Sam, Truth or Dare?”
This time, Dean didn’t say,
“You’re great, Castiel,” she said. “Cute as a button. But it’s kind of obvious, isn’t it?”
When Dean got a 50 on his chemistry quiz, Castiel took the test out of his hands, scanned it, and then handed it back. He spent the rest of the weekend grilling Dean on aldehydes and ketones until Dean promised his eyes were going to shrivel up and fall out of their sockets if he saw another hydrocarbon bond. But on Tuesday, he returned with a test mark of 78 and a hug so hard it nearly crushed Castiel's ribs.
Cas's hands were in his hair, tugging, trying to pull him off. "I'm not him," Cas said. "I'm not. I wish I were, but I'm not."
“Cool. I’m Beth.” Beth put her hands together and gave Castiel a hard, long look. “Castiel, I saw my Computer Science prof come in an hour ago, and he barely even used his hands. No judgement here.”
like a joyous burst of hope. He wrenched himself out of it—
“Another
“Wh—” Castiel started, and then the man was grabbing Castiel and dragging him to the side of the tunnel until both of them were pressed against the wall.
It was
"I'm not," Castiel said. "Like I said, you can't choose who you love." He held Dean's eyes as he said it, and Dean, someone startled by the intenseness of the gaze, directed his attention to the floor instead.
Castiel mumbled something, too scared to say it aloud.
“I dunno,” Dean sighed. “Maybe he’s just confused.”
"I told you," Castiel said, "I'm not going to tell you."
“It’s silly,” Castiel had murmured, suddenly embarrassed. He shut the scrapbook and hugged it to his chest.
Castiel glanced up. “Just anywhere is fine,” he said noncommittally. “Why don’t you pull over that chair and sit in front of the canvas, a few metres away.”
“Cas,
“Um,” Maggie said, and ducked her head and smiled, small and sweet. “Yeah, actually. I’ve seen you around on campus a few times, and I just—I was wondering if I could get your number?”
from her barely-there giggle to the tilt of her shoulders and the splay of her feet.
The Christmas on the year Dean turned twenty-three, he went on a drive alone through the neighbourhoods and the suburbs in the Impala he didn’t bother changing snow tires for, watching the snow flurries catch on his windshield and bounce off the lights of all the holiday lights strung up in the shingles of all the houses and winding around the trees.
go easy on Cas during Truth or Dare again.
a big, empty room where moonlight fell upon the floor tiles in ribbons. In the very corner curled a tiny figure, so small you could nearly miss it: an inky-black cat with silvery whiskers and a patch of grey on his ear, its tail a question mark in the air.
“So what do you want to do to make it stop hurting?”
Castiel sighed. “No, Dean, it’s not. If we’re going to do this, you need to understand—that it’s going to be hard, and it’s going to be messy. And you need to be ready to face that, because if I let myself do this and you aren’t—”
The Impala was parked right at the very back of the building. Castiel parked his own car on the other side. The sky was grey, thunderclouds rolling in over the faraway forests. Castiel hadn’t brought an umbrella, and neither had Meg, and both their outfits were in no way going to survive a downpour.
“I’m sure you will,” Ash said, and then ushered him through the gates. “There should be more guards inside the castle to give you directions.”
Dean, to Castiel’s complete infuriation, was smiling. “Mm, nah. I think I should have it instead.”
It wasn’t like Cas ever told him to knock it off—because he would, if he asked—and he never looked at Dean back anyway.
"Shit," Dean muttered, and ran a hand over his face. "Nevermind, Castiel. It's nothing," he said, and thought, You aren't supposed to ask me, idiot, you're supposed to just
Castiel raised a lazy eyebrow. “No, it isn’t,” he remarked.
"Dean!"
Castiel agreed, though he still wondered: what difference was there with surgery and time? Did Beth still love him? In what way? He never got the answers, and Beth found a boyfriend named Cal once they went into high school, and they dated for three years before separating amicably. Neither of them had flowers for each other, but Beth seemed happy anyway, with mellow soft smiles and a faraway-fond look in her eyes.
“I dare you to switch seats with Cas.”
“Alright,” Cas said, cool as a cucumber. Dean glanced up into the rearview mirror to meet Sam’s eyes, both of them passing a nonverbal message to
Castiel froze, and then snatched his hands off of Dean’s shoulders like they were burned.
“Castiel,” Dean murmured. He swore he heard that name before.
“Yes, of course, ma’am.”
"Mom!"
They danced. Castiel lost track of the time. He could be okay with this, he echoed in his head. It was enough. He was dancing with a beautiful girl at Senior Prom and he was going to move across the country in less than three months and Dean was his best friend and he was going to be
“You are,” Castiel said, giving up and just letting the words fall out, chucking them out in the open air like they were nothing, not the precious cargo that they were, and closed his eyes as he felt Dean freeze.
Sam huffed, and smiled back at him. “I get it, man. Just—call me, okay?”
“Because—” Dean swallowed. “Because all of the other artists almost use it as a crutch. Colour, I mean. It’s almost like they’re bragging about it—look how many colours I can see, look how many soulmates I’ve met. But it’s not really all that great. And when I look at those paintings, I don’t see all the colours, I see all the patches of grey.”
"No, Dean. Ew."
until they rounded the corner and found it perkily parked in the exact same place from last time.
"Three." Castiel watched Singer's finger trace down the curve of his vertebrae and prod delicately at each of the dark masses. "What's your diagnosis?"
“You could’ve gotten surgery,” Castiel suggested, and Beth’s face contorted with horror, physically recoiling as if hit.
“I know.” Castiel’s voice was weak.
The halls were filled with hushed murmurs, quiet but echoing loud and resonant through the towering ceilings and huge rooms. Dean made his way through the lobby, awkwardly crumpling the map in his hands and discarding it in favour of swivelling his head around, in awe at the sheer volume of the place. He felt oddly small, here, insignificant in the face of the marble walls and gold-swirled frames.
So maybe Castiel was a little quiet, but he had a biting sarcastic edge to him when you got to know him that was so sharp he could slice you in half with a single word. Maybe he was a little awkward, but it only served to add to his personality, and what Dean classified as "weird" quickly turned to "funny" quickly turned to "oddly, really sweet".
“You caught me off-guard,” he argued. “I was distracted.”
He smiled more, these days. Cas smiled more, too.
“Sure,” Sam said. “Hey, Dean, Truth or Dare?”
Castiel draped the blanket over him and tucked the edges into the creases of the couch. Dean muttered something imperceptible. Castiel smoothed out the blanket with his hands, feeling Dean's chest move up and down with his deep breaths, and noted the way Dean's face smoothed out when he was asleep. He looked younger, more delicate, eyelashes casting dark spikes of shadows across his cheeks.
Dean’s smile came easier this time. He cooed and batted his lashes dramatically, peering up at Castiel through them.
Bobby eyed Dean for a moment. “Yeah,” he said gruffly. “You can. Just don’t do anything stupid, you hear?”
“Sure. Cas, Truth or Dare?”
“Sure you did, Sammy,” Dean said, reluctantly letting that one slide, because if Sam found out that Dad had taken one bite, thanked Sam, and then waited until he was out of sight before chucking them into the wastebin, Sam would flip out.
replacing it just above. Underneath it was a string of numbers.
Dean looked closer. There, right on Cas’s pinky finger, at the first knuckle: a spot, swelling up and an angry red.
way of the main gates, instead heading towards the back of the castle.
Castiel smiled dryly. “You can say it, Dean, you won’t hurt me anymore. I’m your best friend. Aren’t I?”
know, but I know it was me. That Cas was, um. You know.” Smooth.
“Don’t
So Dean didn't think about it. So Dean smiled at the new Castiel and thought about the old Castiel and kept his heartache to himself. After all, weren't they the same person?
way, see him backing up one, two steps before Dean barrelled into Castiel and, in a move drilled into him from dozens of football practices in the past, tackled him straight into the communal garden.
(But they weren’t talking about it.
“Dean,” Castiel said slowly. “Why are you here?”
Dean huffed. “How many times do I have to tell you, it’s not a paid date. Meg has liked you for, like,
Dean watched him for a moment longer, and then made his way towards the gift shop next to the visitor’s centre.
is it that's making it this bad?"
“You in the button-up,” Castiel said. “No, the other one. Yes, you. Hello, what’s your name?”
He stood there for fifteen minutes until a shooting pain made its way down his neck and he grimaced, rubbed it away, and was suddenly aware of the goosebumps all over his skin and the breath fogging up the air in front of him.
He squished it between his fingers, feeling it crumple, the bold scent wafting out, sharp and astringent compared to his own Angel’s Breath, which was delicate as fresh parchment.
Beth looked a little overwhelmed, her eyes darting back and forth between the two of them. Like a fish trapped between two bloodthirsty sharks, she decided on the best strategy for survival: retreat.
“You’re welcome,” Dean shot back automatically, and then turned back to the mirror. Fixed his bowtie. Met Castiel’s eyes again through the mirror. For some reason, it didn’t do anything to diminish the intensity of that stare—in fact, it almost seemed amplified, being able to see both himself and Dean in the glimmering reflection. “But seriously. This is gonna be fun, okay? Just relax and focus on having a good time.”
lovely,” Dean said back.
“My experience with Hanahaki disease is perhaps more diverse and frequent than others,” Castiel said quietly. “Like I said, I’m what you like to call a ‘hopeless romantic’, although I would word it much more differently. All of these flowers I’ve saved remind me of someone special—individual and unique. But placing them all together like this, such that they’re all collected in one identical, cohesive space—it’s a little counterintuitive.” A long pause. “Dean, I trust you remember when things got really bad? I could always handle it, though. I always got through it without surgery, without any outside interference, before. But you were right, it was awful, nothing like I’d ever experienced before. It very nearly destroyed me. Something like that, I don’t think really belongs to be arbitrarily slotted in with all these dozens of others.”
“You can’t just skip my turn!”
Cas climbed back over the seat and squirmed himself back into his position on the backseat, leaning contently against the window. “That was fun,” he said happily.
"Yeah," Dean said, and spat out another flower into the sink. Goddamn, he hated that taste.
"Cas!" Dean had said happily anyway, never one to back out from an event gone wrong. "How'd it go, man?"
Curled up and wrapped around his husband, he falls asleep.
The man shrugged. “Gabriel’s always been the more socially-attuned one, so I suppose he could be right. But, either way, it’s one of my favourite coats. I’d like to have it back, please.”
“It’s really not that bad yet,” Castiel said, and he clung to the thought while Bobby swore at him, clung to it with greedy fingers like a starving beggar when he walked out the room with a pounding head and a steady, blossoming ache in his chest, and when he turned the corner into the waiting room to see Dean, who rose with worried eyes as he saw Castiel’s pale face and trembling hands, Castiel etched the mantra in his head until it burned.
The man turned around, his eyes sparkling and seeming to glow in the low lighting of the tunnels. “This is the fastest way into the castles. Trust me.”
When Dean was in twelfth grade, a girl named Rhonda left a pile of azaleas on his desk in English, along with a scribbled number on the corner of the desk.
When Castiel was first contacted to become one of the castle’s guards, he’d been apprehensive at first: he hadn’t even trained in Winchester grounds before. But news of his skill travelled quickly—even through land that was a three-day trip—and it would, as he’d been reminded dozens and hundreds and thousands of times, be an incredible honour and dignity to serve the Winchesters. The months leading up to the trip, Castiel had been putting extra hours and long gruelling nights into his training, determined to meet their expectations—or exceed them.
The nurse blinked for a moment. “Oh. Yes, of course—I misspoke. My apologies.” Looked away, and Dean felt his breath catch.
When Castiel broke up with Tom two weeks later, with a muted shrug and a nonplussed reply,
around the whole word just like Sophia did.
“Thank you,” Cas whispered. “But I don’t think you can get a catapult anywhere near here.”
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said, and smiled.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said, unsure.
Dean smiled quickly, though his eyes were still flickering. “I know you don’t like parties. Or dances. Or anything, really, and I
“Hello, Bobby,” Castiel said, then, “Is something wrong?”
Castiel didn't look up. "Yeah?"
After a few attempts, Dean finally got his voice back; raspy and low. "Are you crazy?"
“My turn,” Cas said. “Dean, Truth or Dare?”
and the whole campus is suddenly chock-full of school spirit.”
Instead of answering, Singer said, "Who is it?"
“Where do you think?” Dean says. “I don’t know about you, but I’m beat. Home—bed—now.” He comes in closer and wraps his arms around Castiel from behind, crossing his hands together at Castiel’s stomach. “Imagine this: you finally get to take off those shoes.”
“Punch buggy,” Dean said as way of explanation, extending an arm to gesture at the now-empty street.
It was like focusing a blurred image, double vision fading into one singularity. Dean Winchester and the man from the gardens, coming together into one.
“Yeah,” Dean said, shakily. “Yeah, of course, thank you—thank you—”
“You too,” Dean said, mind whirring brokenly like the AC in the library. “I’m Dean.”
Dean watched Castiel sign the papers, ask the nurse for another cup of water (which he drained with relish), and walk the whole way back to their dorms. His heart was pounding like he'd just run a mile, even though they were taking it slow, Castiel still a little groggy from the anaesthesia they have put him through.
"Who is it for?" he asked, and there was nothing personal, nothing edgy, nothing in his voice but a cold, impassioned curiosity.
“Like I want a shower,” Castiel finally said. “And a long, long nap.”
"Castiel?" A female voice drifted in from the halls. Castiel looked up to see a nurse holding a clipboard.
Dean huffed, annoyed at Charlie—she was a faster runner than Dean, but Dean would never admit it (never
