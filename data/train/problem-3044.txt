it took me so long to get over my shit and realize how fucking perfect you are for me.” Dean's eyes locked onto Cas' as he spoke and he didn't miss the flash of surprise from the brunet. He closed the distance between them and leaned in until their lips were touching gently. Holding back from his desire to push the former angel against the wall, shove his tongue down his throat and rip off his clothes, Dean kept the kiss mostly chaste, letting Cas set the pace when he got over his shock and started to, very hesitantly reciprocate.
Dean felt Cas clench around him when he climaxed, his whole body quivering on top of him and the hunter let go, following his partner over the edge. He thrust up a few more times and burst deep inside the other man. Cas rocked into him, milking out every last drop from both of their cocks then collapsed sweaty and exhausted on top of him.
Pulling the stolen Oldsmobile up to a large white building, Sam braced himself for the freakout Dean was probably going to have when he found out where they were. Although, he was fairly certain Dean was already in the process of having one considering how on edge he had been since they left the motel.
Dean laughed at the look on his brother's face and tried to ignore the fact that he was already half hard. Cas had promised to do something
“What're you talking about? Where is he?”
“Fine, stop nagging. I'll talk to him.” Dean scooted his chair back and stood up. “You take care of the check.”
"Lie down," Cas said as he pulled the hunter's jeans the rest of the way off and tossed them aside.
body indeed. Cas's cock twitched with interest.
"Damn tease," Dean growled and pulled Cas in for another kiss.
“It isn't-”
parties participate.”
Cas bobbed his head, licking over the vein on the underside of his shaft and swirling his tongue around the crown. He fit a hand around the base and pumped as his lips slid up and sucked at the tip then plunged down again.
made him feel something which had nothing to do with envy. He was glad Sam was turned away and couldn't see him blushing like a freaking school girl.
'Whoa! Hands off there,' Shelby said, getting on the bed to sit on her knees behind Dean. 'He's supposed to be dancing for you, remember?'
Sam speaks again, so low he’s barely audible.
Cas turns to leave the room but something he said suddenly hits Dean. “Wait, that means you would know if something, or some
'Your booty, dear,' Mia said, zooming the camera in on Cas' face and then back out again. 'Give him a good show.'
," Dean answered, completely turned on by hearing the former angel swear. He pushed himself into Cas, wanting to feel every inch of the other man inside of him.
“Sam,” Dean said leaning back against the headboard. “I'm not really up for another heart-to-heart at the moment so drop it already.”
drug. It didn't hurt you,” she gestured between Dean and Cas, “and you two knew what you were doing.”
"Was that the lamp?" Cas asked in disbelief.
“Have you?” Cas asked evenly.
mouth of his. Dean could think of a lot better uses for those big pale lips and the skillful tongue behind them.
“It’s about time,” Sam says. “We’ve all been exhausted by the constant pining.”
Dean swallowed. "It's awesome, Cas. You did good."
“Why not?” Dean shrugs. “You spotted two witches and solved the case in less than a day. Can’t have you upstaging me like that.”
” Cas whined and Dean relished the fact that he was making his angel fall apart from his mouth alone. He kissed, licked and nibbled his way back up the angel"s body and returned to his lips. Since Dean was no longer restraining his movement, Cas rocked their hips together.
Do that again.”
" he rocked his hips, "would be really fucked up.” He sucked on Cas' earlobe and ground their groins together again. His dick was thankful for the friction and he decided their pants really needed to be off
The four of them made their way up to the entrance; an old rusted metal door that was barely hanging on its hinges. Next to the door was a large dirty window looking out into the parking lot with a faded 'Bud Light' neon sign hanging above it.
“Of course we're not.” Dean crossing his arms. “But as far as he knows, we
The kitchen and library are empty and there’s no answer when he knocks on the former angel’s door. He must be with Sam.
Cas' eyebrows furrowed. “I don't understand. Did we see a film here last night?”
“Not really.”
"So, what happened in there?" Kevin asked as soon as they were on their way home.
“Then why'd you look?” Dean asked, mostly annoyed that he was no longer being touched.
'That looks promising,' Mia commented, moving the camera up the length of Cas' body before zooming out to get Dean in the shot.
“Of course,” Cas replied in an icy tone. “Will that be all?”
“Thought Sam went to bed.”
"Wha' wrong idea did they get?" Cas asked, tilting his head a little further to the side than usual, causing his whole body to slid down the seat sideways towards Kevin in exaggerated slow motion. Kevin reached out and roughly pushed Cas in the other direction until his head flopped to the side and hit the window with a thump "Ow."
The younger Winchester, who apparently had no trouble falling asleep, was sprawled out on the next bed, snoring so loudly Castiel was surprised the windows weren't rattling out of their hinges.
“It's still creepy even if it happens to kinda be true with Cas,” Dean said and stood up. He didn't have time for a pointless freakout. “Whatever. We're done with our Dr. Drew moment so will you please find and delete that damn video?”
“I would need to be in proximity to the magic to sense it, but yes,” Cas answers with a small smile.
Dean shot out of the bed and went to the door.
“Ugh, do I really have to spell it out,” she said, rolling her eyes again. “Just. For. Him.”
“Dean, you can't expect me to help you check a bunch of gay porn sites,” Sam said incredulously. “I'm totally supportive, but come on. I wouldn't do that even if it were straight porn. And in case you forgot, that video came from
They start spewing everywhere, you hide behind Sammy, 'kay? Bitch was gonna let me bust my face on the floor 'cuz he's afraid to get the sniffles. Let
“Uh...Sam,” Cas answered timidly when all the younger Winchester did was blink down at the man.
“I thought you were bounty hunters looking for some parole jumper from Oklahoma,” the redhead said.
“Sorry,” Sam said, glancing from his computer to his brother. “I know how you get in uncomfortable situations and I didn't want you projecting your anger with yourself onto Cas.”
“One of the witches in Red Oak was operating out of an herbal tea shop,” Cas explains with a grimace. “He had been using his business to target and curse his victims by adding his own ingredients to the tea blends. It was neither ethical nor sanitary.”
teeth. The feeling of being filled up by his partner was new and almost overwhelming. "Keep...going," he added so Cas would know he didn't want to stop.
you do.'
“Hello, Dean.”
“Oh, that's awesome,” Dean said, sarcastically. “How do we get it taken down?”
“That's what we're trying to find out,” Sam said.
Dean was well aware that Cas' trek to the bunker had not been a pleasant one. It seemed that all of Castiel's experiences in his first few weeks as a card carrying member of the human race had unfortunately been negative. Cas never told the brothers everything that happened to him after the angels fell, but based on the condition he was in when he finally made it home - cold, bloody, and starving - Dean worked the details out himself. Now, Cas barely left the bunker and stayed locked in his room most of the time, reading through old tomes from the Men of Letters impressive library.
The brunette held up her hands placatingly. “Okay, yes, we gave you guys some E so we'd all have a good time, but it's hardly a
Cas first leaned down to licked up the drops of precome that had fallen onto Dean's stomach and then he flicked his tongue over the slit of the cock and closed his lips around the head.
"You're very welcome."
“Are you kidding? There's no way I'd miss my OTP becoming canon,” she said with a knowing grin.
“I wouldn't even know where to start looking for something like that,” Sam responded. “Is it really that dig of a deal? I mean, who would even want to watch it, anyway?” He tried to sound reassuring, but the topic of his brother's leaked gay porno was making him a little uncomfortable.
“Gimp?"
Dean grunts out of annoyance and kicks off his muddy boots, letting one hit the wall and splattering brown muck over the faded yellow paint. He hears shuffling on the other side of the room and casts a quick glance over his shoulder to find the angel in the process of removing his own sopping coat and draping it over the partition between the door and kitchenette.
Sam held his laptop closer to his chest, like a protective barrier. “She may have mentioned something about subtext in Chuck's books and wanted to know if you two were really that intense. You're welcome to ask her to elaborate when she gets here.”
"Bossy tonight," Dean mumbled, but eagerly did as he was told.
Dean could see in Cas' face that he was just as turned-on, but the bastard wanted to play hard to get. He slid over in the bench seat, pinning Cas between his body and the door and started sucking on a particularly sensitive area on the brunet's neck. Cas' resolve dissolved quickly and Dean grinned into his skin when Cas wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled them closer.
“You already did.”
“What?”
Dean thrust into Cas' fist and grunted. "Fuck, man, not gonna last that long." He wrapped his own hand around Cas' and pumped harder. Cas tightened his grip and sucked at a spot on Dean's neck. It would probably leave a noticeable mark he thought with a sense of gratification.
“You’re right,” Sam agrees. “You have been acting like an irrational dick lately, but neither of us will hold it against you, considering.”
Cas was silent for a moment. “Okay, I was just checking. I heard noises that sounded like -- I thought you might be in
and Dean’s heart thrums in his chest.
whiny.”
TFW sets out to find the Impala and figure out what happened the night before.
Cas hovers over him, placing one large hand on Dean's forehead and cradling the hunter's neck with the other. "I doubt very much that fall would have been the death of you, Dean." Cas frowns. "However, as I’m no longer able to heal you, I do wish you would be more careful."
Cas shut off the faucet and lifted Dean's arm out of the way so he could turn around and face him. "I'm trying to clean the dishes, Dean, and that is
"That's my fault," Dean said, snapping Castiel out of his reverie. "Shoulda known you'd need a more direct approach." With that, he rolled his hips again in slow drag that had both of them groaning.
“It has been a nuisance.”
"Well, it better not be
They were probably too wrapped up in each other to notice he was gone.
For example, he was currently experiencing what could only be described as agitation.
“You mean I probably could've just done it myself?” He pulled his phone out of his pocket and put it in her outstretched hand.
Dean picked up the lube and squeezed some out into his palm. He brought his hand down to stroke himself and covered his shaft with the clear liquid. As soon as he was ready, Cas took hold of him and lined himself up. He wrapped an arm around the hunter and lowered slowly until the blunt head of Dean's cock penetrated the ring of muscle. Cas took a deep breath and sunk down slowly. Dean threw his head back, hitting the headboard, and groaned. Cas was tight and hot around him and the feeling was almost enough to make him come already.
He could hear the faint sound of Dean laughing on the other side of the wall and rolled his eyes.
Mia pulled a set of keys out of her purse and turned to unlock the door. “She's right. Hate to tell you guys, but that lovey-dovey shit you said to each other, it was all you.”
“Nah, let me do something for you.” Dean sat up and gave Cas a kiss, tasting himself on the ex-angel's lips. He put his arms around the other man and flipped them so Cas was on his back again. Dean straddled him and took Cas’ cock in his hand. He figured if the former angel could suck his dick, the least he could do was give the guy a handy. Cas threw his head back and gasped when Dean’s strong fingers wrapped around his length and began stroking at a steady pace.
“Of course,” Sam sighed. “Kind of sounds like you got drugged. Anything missing?”
Dean grunts at the sudden movement, but doesn't resist. "Where we goin'?"
“Hope I'm worth all the trouble,” Dean said and followed Cas into their room.
Cas eyed him suspiciously, but gave in with a defeated sigh.
Dean beamed at him victoriously. "I knew you'd give in, buddy," he said with a sly grin and winked. "Now get changed and try to fix your hair or something." Dean raised his arm to run his hand through the dark tangled mess, but stopped midway when he realized what he was doing. He quickly diverted to awkwardly pat Cas on the shoulder instead. "We, uh, we'll leave in an hour.
Cas glided the tip of his tongue down Dean's shaft and licked at his balls before sucking them into his mouth.
“Shh, let me take care of you,” Dean said, kissing his way around to the other side of Cas' neck between each word. “It won’t be like last time.”
doing that.”
Thankfully, there were no bare asses to be seen, but the room was far from being in PG condition. There were discarded clothes in piles on the floor, a white smock of some sort near the door and the lamp that usually stood in the corner had been knocked over and had a pair of discarded pants flung over it haphazardly. At this point, Sam knew he should stop looking, shut his eyes and bravely run away, but it's true what they say about watching train wrecks. The bed covers were rumpled, wet in certain spots, and there was a pair of
Sam agreed. “Besides, we still have to get it out of here and find a place to bury the body. Plus, no offense, but you and Cas are covered in sewer slim and you smell like shit. We should probably just take care of this mess and head back to the motel.”
“He's not pasty,” Dean corrected reflexively.
it if you called me
Sam responded with bitchface #14 and sat down at the table with his computer. “I take it the viewing party didn't go well?”
Dean sighed again. Thinking of Cas made him feel things that were getting harder and harder to ignore. In fact, he was actually getting hard just thinking about the man in the other room. He absentmindedly ran his palm over his stiffening cock, sending waves of pleasure through his body. If he was honest with himself, which he rarely was, he'd admit that it wasn't the first time he had been aroused by thoughts of the former angel, but he always managed to push them aside and think of more appropriate things, like boobs, instead.
He reached down to pulled the nozzle out of the tank and placed it back on the pump. “You guys need to fuck off before things turn real ugly,” Dean warned in his most intimidating voice.
They stare at one another for several moments before Dean decides to close the distance between them. Cas isn’t remotely fazed when the hunter invades his space, nor when he latches onto the Cas’ shoulders and pushes him back against the wall. Dean’s always been aware that he could never manhandle the angel like he does unless Cas allowed it. Unbidden, his mind dredges up an image of his friend lying beaten and bloody on the bunker floor – a broken, desperate plea his only defense against Dean’s mark of Cain fueled rage, because he refused to fight back.
Dean was hard, lying naked across the bed. He was exposed and vulnerable while the still fully clothed ex-angel looked down at him with
Dean quickly ducks back behind the wall and peeks around the corner to watch Cas backing out of Sam’s bedroom. Sam, who said he was too tired to join in on their binge-watch of the most underappreciated series in sci-fi and was going to bed early, is not only awake, but apparently much better company than Dean if this is where Cas has been running off to every five minutes.
”Whatever. I'll just look myself.”
“One I would like an honest answer to.”
“If you'd left me finish, I was about to say that
“What else?” Sam asked.
letting me push you around, no matter how bossy I get. Next time, tell me to fuck off or something and go do what
Dean's not expecting them back until sometime Monday, so it's a surprise when he walks into the kitchen Sunday morning to find Sam and Cas leaning against the island, shoulder to shoulder, talking in hushed voices.
“Yeah,” Sam says sadly. “The runt didn’t make it. Cas was pretty broken up about that. They were malnourished and dying, so we stayed up with them for two nights trying everything to save them. I guess the little one was already too far gone. Cas took its death hard because he would have been able to save it if he still had grace.”
“You guys hear that?” Kevin asked while looking around the kitchen for the source of the noise.
"Yeah, I think they can, buddy," Dean said and patted Cas on the back. "I can't believe you're already this wasted. Such a light-weight."
Cas' breath ghosts over his lips and Dean doesn’t move away when he leans in, sealing their mouths together. They clutch each other, bodies pressing closer as they both sink into it. Cas’ lips are dry but soft, and his stubble scrapes against Dean’s skin; it’s unfamiliar but electrifying. The kiss deepens and a low moan escapes from Dean's throat when he feels Cas' tongue swipe over his bottom lip.
Once they were alone, Dean wasted no time making his intentions very clear through a series of sensuous kisses and touches, the roll of his hips, and the slid of his tongue. When it was over, Cas swiped his fingertips through the mess on his stomach and discovered that Dean did in fact have his own unique taste. It was his new favorite thing about being human.
He sounds shy and maybe a little embarrassed by the conversation, so Dean decides to give him a break. “Alright, go before you piss your pants.”
Dean shifted uncomfortably. “So, uh, what-” he failed to keep is voice steady, “what did we do here exactly?”
“Shit, I'm sorry, Cas.” Dean placed a hand on Cas' shoulder. “That was- I shouldn't have said it.”
He pulls the cloth back to reveal two small wiggling animals.
Cas and Kevin look up when he enters and Dean doesn’t miss the way Cas places a protective hand around the edge of the crate from his position on the floor.
“Ha ha,” Dean grumbled, lifting his foot to inspect the area now covered by the flesh-colored bandage. He sat next to the sink on the bathroom counter and glanced down at the former angel. “Next time you want a glass of water in the middle of the night, you're getting it yourself.”
“What the hell happened, Dean?” Sam asked crossing his arms. “Cas is really upset.”
"Exactly!" Dean said quickly, then let the words sink in. "Wait,
knows about it,” Sam answered, turning and leaving to go call the redhead.
“What?”
Sam parked the car in front of the 'Condom Emporium' sign and looked over at Dean. “If you want, I'll go in and two can stay out here.”
"Come on, Cas," Dean whined. "Please, just put on the pants and shirt I got you. I made sure to pick out dark colored stuff since you're all into that emo crap or whatever these days."
"Tell me what I do in your sexy dreams," Dean breathed against his neck. "I'm gonna make 'em come true."
Cas wasn't sure if it was the sunlight in his face or the crick in his neck that woke him, but he didn't need to see the clock to know it was much too early. With his eyes still tightly shut he peeled himself off of Dean and turned away from the blinding light, hoping to get a bit more sleep before they had to leave.
Dean's smile faded and he blinked at Cas. He knew it was fair and that he deserved it, but he hated that Cas was hurt and angry with him. The only reason he had come up with the ill conceived plan to get the ex-angel laid in the first place was because he wanted to help Cas feel better. Now, it seemed that he only made things worse for both of them.
“Sorry, buddy, Sam must’ve finished it off,” Dean says and turns back to his computer screen. “There should be tea in the cabinet.”
“Evidently,” Cas relied. “Do you happen to know why?”
," Kevin said disbelieving, grabbing Cas' wrist and moving the former angel's hand away from his head where it had settled.
Dean tilted his head back into the mattress, expecting Cas to take him in his mouth any moment. Instead of warm lips, he felt something solid (and a little cold) being wrapped around the base of his dick. His head shot up to see Cas snapping on a thick cock ring with a bulky bullet-shaped device attached to it. He assumed it must also vibrate.
“I thought you were finally-,” Sam starts then cuts himself off. “You know what, forget it. Do what you want, just don’t tell us about it.”
“I plan to do more than embrace you, Dean.” Cas licked his lips and Dean wondered where the fuck he learned to be so seductive. He leaned over and palmed Dean through his boxers before he pulled them down and placed his mouth around the tip. Dean moaned at the sudden feeling and grabbed a fistful of Cas' hair. “
"Sammy went all BAMF on those dicks, that's what happened," Dean said proudly. His brother could be pretty awesome sometimes.
Miguel looked over the list and nodded. “You said you wanted to experiment so I helped you pick out a few essentials. Your boyfriend threw in the panties and your friends picked out the rest.”
Even through Cas' sunglasses, Dean could see the sadness in his eyes. “It's not anything you did, buddy. You know how fucked up I am so it shouldn't really surprise you that I'm not handling this situation very well.”
“I understand, Dean. I was on that recording as well,” Cas answered quietly. “And I'm sorry for my behavior.”
"Do you like it?" Castiel asked nervously the second Dean's fork left his mouth. They were sitting next to each other at the kitchen table with Sam and Kevin on the opposite side and platters of various foods spread between them.
good.” Cas smiled and rubbed his hands over Dean's thighs. “I put it in after our encounter earlier and have been wearing it all evening.”
Dean stifled a moan and moved away. “We should probably head back out there. Sam went to pick up dinner and he'll probably be back soon.”
Cas set the clipboard down on the nightstand and scanned over his 'patient' letting his eyes linger on Dean's leaking cock. "How fortunate you are that I am
“God, you feel so good,” Dean said with a raspy voice.
looked at him. Dean wasn't sure how he had missed it before when it was right in front of him the
Several shots later, Cas was listening as Dean drunkenly attempted to list all of the reasons pie was superior to cake. Cas refused to accept “because pie” as adequate validation to Dean's claim and requested documented proof.
The next time Dean wakes he finds himself slumped over the backseat of the Impala; sweaty face sticking uncomfortably to the leather and his back and neck protesting the awkward position. He sits up - resigning himself to the twinge he’ll feel in his lower back the rest of the day – and takes stock of his situation.
“You sure? It seems like you're missing a great opportunity to get advice from someone who's been there.” She faked a yawn. “But if you don't want my help then suit yourself. I saw a sweet looking Xbox out there, and Dean, it's beckoning me right now.”
"Smile," Kevin responds and Dean looks up just in time to be blinded by a flash from his phone. "I'm sending Cas a picture so he'll quit bugging me."
“No,” Cas said firmly.
"Aw, aren't you boys cute," she said with a genuine smile.
His body was also starting to take an interest at the thought of sharing a bed with the nearly naked hunter and he was suddenly reminded of the many times Dean had made appearances in his dreams over the past few weeks -- most of which ended with him waking up to either a sticky mess or achingly hard. This was a bad idea he realized, but couldn't, and frankly didn't want to go back to the other room where he could still hear Sam's muffled snores through the thin wall. Swallowing a lump in his throat he managed to keep his voice even, “Thank you, Dean.”
“Anymore questions?” Miguel asked as a couple of customers came in and headed to the BDSM section.
, Dean?" Sam smirked. "Wow."
“We have to be outta here in twenty minutes,” Dean told him, ignoring the suggestion. “Stop playing around and get up. I'm gonna take a shower real quick.”
The burn of having a third finger inserted was dulled considerably by Cas' attention to his dick and he was only moments away from shooting down the ex-angel's throat when Cas swallowed around him a final time and pulled off. Dean let out an embarrassing whine and pushed back on Cas' hand, seeking the pleasure of pressure on his prostate. Cas crooked his fingers, but purposely avoided the bundle of nerves, knowing Dean was already so close it would send him over the edge before Cas was even inside him.
"– my room –" Sam is saying but stops abruptly when he notices his brother. "Hey, Dean."
“Dude, you got a UTI or what?” Dean asks, pausing the tv and turning in his spot on the couch to glare at the former angel. “You
Dean smirked. “Of course.”
“Never mind,” Dean replied, “but since I know you're gonna look it up later, remember that I was joking. We are so
, you're so hot," Dean gasped. "What kinda freaky porn were you watching anyway?"
Dean grunted and left his brother to pay for their meal. He stopped by the restroom before heading outside and meeting Cas. The former angel didn't saying anything when Dean stepped up next to him and leaned back on the car.
hepatitis? I'm trying to cut back."
I see 'ere's you," Cas snapped back, poking the man in his plump belly, and for good measure, adding a high-pitched "woo hoo," like he'd seen on a television commercial.
“I'm switching rooms with Sam for the night,” Cas answered, already halfway outside. Turning back to glare at the hunter he added, “Your denial would be far more convincing if you hadn't called out my name when you pleasured yourself in the shower earlier.” Cas rolled his eyes when Dean refused to meet his gaze. “Yes, I heard, and there's no need to be embarrassed,” he nearly held back a smirk. “After all, I think about
“Alright, Cas,” Dean said and shifted in the seat so he was looking at his friend. “You really wanna know what a bathhouse is?”
“Yes, Dean?”
“You did not offend me,” Cas assured her. “That was actually one of the more pleasant greetings I have received.”
. The bunker was supposed to be the safest place on earth, warded against all types of malevolent creatures, but monsters can be crafty little bastards and a hunter never lets his guard down.
'no' and said that if he wanted a dick he had a 'nice big one' ready for him.
Dean swallowed the lump in his throat and fought the urge to pull his friend into a hug. The situation was weird enough without adding physical contact to the mix. “...Yeah.”
This time, Dean did roll his eyes. “Dude,
Dean felt his pockets were empty and started looking around the hotel room. He opened the drawer on the nightstand, choked back whimper and slammed it shut before Sam could see the only items inside were three sets of different sized anal beads and a bottle of lube.
“Excuse me?” the redhead scoffed. “We didn't steal shit. Your stuff is in the car where
It being Friday night in a town with almost nothing to do for fun except drink, Dean figured the bar would probably be packed at least. That would increase his chances of finding a suitable hookup for his friend.
"He's still scary."
"I - I'm ready," Dean panted after a few minutes. "
“Shoot.”
When Cas finally releases the swollen nub and looks up at him, he’s got a quirked eyebrow and a shit-eating grin plastered on his face. He’s never looked more
Dean managed to climb to his feet and ran behind another stack of wooden pallets just as the thing charged at him again. The pallets were pushed forward as the creature hit them with full force and Dean found himself once again being knocked back. It raised its claws to strike when Dean caught a glimpse of messy dark hair coming up behind it. He moved away as Castiel jumped on the thing's back, locked his arms tightly around its neck and plunging his angel blade deep in its chest. Brown slim poured from the wound, but the creature didn't show any signs of slowing down. It thrashed about until Cas was thrown off; the former angel landing gracefully on his feet and prepared to stab it again.
He picked up a piece of broken wood and threw it, hitting the thing right between the eyes. Instead of stunning it long enough for him to stand and retrieve his pistol, he only succeeded in pissing it off more. It growled at him and thick globs of something slimy, brownish-green, and smelling an awful lot like sewage fell from its mouth, splattering on the floor. It reached for the hunter, slashing at him with an oversized hand containing three webbed digits and razor sharp claws. Dean scrambled around trying to dig himself out from under the pile and rolled out of the way just as the creature attempted to skewer him.
' Dean was once again snapped out of thoughts he was
"Bossy," Dean mumbled, but allowed Cas to guide him. As he slid further down the bed he kissed at the smooth skin of Cas' stomach and licked around his navel, dipping his tongue inside.
Sam sighed. Dean spent the entire night hanging all over Cas, ignoring everyone else at the bar (including him and Kevin, he thought, slightly bitter), the two were nearly assaulted for it, and still Dean insisted on ignoring what was so blatantly obvious to everyone else.
immediately responds by tilting his head slightly for a better angle and wasting no time before unceremoniously shoving his tongue in the hunter's mouth, Dean's brain short circuits and his body goes rigid.
He’s not expecting to find himself suddenly being yanked off with a plop and lifted up to his feet. He barely has time to catch his breath before Cas’ mouth is on his, hot tongue sweeping over Dean’s bottom lip to lap up a string of his own pre-come and drawing him into a filthy, wet kiss.
"Why?" Dean asked confused. The men were fairly overweight and while the hunting life did often lead to some unhealthy habits (copious amounts of junk food and booze) it did at least tend to keep a person in shape.
What the fuck? Did Cas just suggest they shower together? Dean's mouth went dry and his mind was bombarded with images of his friend naked and wet; lathering up his lean body, rubbing soap over his hard cock, stroking himself off slowly under the steamy water, and
“I have no interest.”
“Why'd ya wait?” Dean asked through ragged breaths. “Coulda fucked this morning or-,” he paused to moan when Cas rolled his hips, “or in the car, dressing room at K-mart, restroom at that diner-”
“Good.” Cas smiled sleepily. “Your mattress is more comfortable than mine.”
“Fuck off, Kevin,” Dean responds. “I need to talk to Cas.”
Cas was getting mail now?
Cas sighed. His muscles protested the movement, but he forced himself to climb off of the bed behind Dean.
Cas kissed around Dean's stubbled jaw, down to his throat and Adam's apple and sucked at the skin on his neck. "Do you like having me fuck you, Dean?"
“A few...thousand.”
"How did you
out had not gone as planned and the last thing he needed was to walk in and find his brother and the ex-angel going at it on the table where he does his research. Again.
“I had considered sleeping.” Cas side-eyed him. “How foolish of me.”
“He was pretty creepy,” Sam agreed. “I felt like he was undressing me with his eyes.”
He skipped ahead to watch his lips meet Cas' for the first time. The way Cas kissed him – full of passion and desperation and inexperience – Dean would be lying if he said it didn't look amazing. He couldn't remember the last time he had been with someone with that kind of emotion. He went back and watch it again. And again.
“Yes.” If Sam hadn’t already changed his mind, the look of pure happiness on Cas’ face would have. “Don't know what we’re gonna do when we hunt though.”
"Better," Dean mutters and makes sure his phone is charged before drifting off to sleep.
"I know," Cas agreed, surprised. Of all the responses he thought Dean would have to being kissed by Castiel, a critique of his performance was not one of them. "Do you want me to leave?"
"What? Is it not up to your snooty standards, princess?" Dead shot back. He turned to look between Kevin and Cas in the backseat, the latter of which was sitting behind him, hands in his lap and face set in his usual stoic expression. Kevin on the other hand was nearly bouncing out of the seat with excitement.
If Sam didn't already know that there was no longer a God in heaven, he would have been saying his praises when they finally made it back to the bunker around sunrise. Dean had decided not to stop at a motel and opted to continue driving through the night. His reasons behind that decision were fairly obvious and no one argued.
“My queen,” Dean said fondly, hugging her back. “Uh, thanks for coming.”
“By 'fun' do you mean certain iniquities?”
Cas looks taken aback at being chastised. “You have been at this for hours and won’t tell us what you’re doing. If lives are in danger, you should let us help.”
Dean grumbled. Sam turned up the radio.
Cas sucked him until he was empty; swallowing every drop before licking him clean and pulling off. He tucked Dean's spent member back inside the panties and powered down the plug. Sitting up, he wiped his mouth, and smiled satisfactorily. “Is that better?”
"That's not in keeping with the holiday spirit, Dean."
Dean kept going, sweeping his tongue over the head, mixing saliva and precome and going back down, nearly to the base without gagging.
Cas stroked Dean fast and hard to match his thrusting. When Cas hit the sweet spot inside, Dean couldn't hold back the
“As you wish,” Cas said after a few moments of consideration and Dean smiled slightly, getting the reference. “It's not as if you haven't had years already, but as always, you're issues come first.”
“What happens when you change your mind again?” Cas asked seriously. “I can't keep doing this with you, Dean. Eventually I'll have to leave your side for good and I'm afraid that would destroy me.”
“The one in the shirt was a redhead. Not natural red though, more like ugly tomato red. She’s clearly trying too hard to be unique. The other girl was a brunette with
his cock.
“'Course I do, just want this to be good for both of us.”
"Apologies," Cas replied, once again without any hint of remorse. Keeping their eyes locked, he bent over and ran his tongue through the mess, licking around Dean's bellybutton and flicking inside briefly before capturing a piece of the fruit between his teeth and sucking it in to his mouth.
Dean winced and looked away.
When Cas wandered through the garage door and made his way to the car, he gave Dean a wicked grin before climbing in the passengers seat. “Are you alright?”
“Well, I didn't want to interrupt. Thought you might be doing
Sam’s a good guy; the best, actually. He’s loyal and compassionate and when he falls for someone, he goes all in. It’s no wonder Cas chose him.
"Because Charlie would kill me if I didn't," Sam stated, simply. "Also, Kevin and I had a bet going and I just won." At that, Dean pulled the blanket down enough to glare at his brother. Sam had moved further away from the bed and stood by the open door separating their two rooms. "Need proof," he finished, waving his phone at them and smiling smugly before heading into his room and shutting the door.
“Because we know how you feel about pets,” Sam answers defensively.
He heads to the bathroom to wipe away the drying jizz, opting for a damp washcloth over a shower. When he’s done with himself, he grabs another cloth and goes to clean Cas up as well - because Dean Winchester is a
"C'mon," Cas said trying to pull Dean up with him. "Need help."

have work to do. “Lead the way, handmaiden.” She followed Dean down the hall and into his bedroom. “So… boyfriend troubles?” She asked as soon as Dean had shut the door behind them.
“Shit, Cas, you never told me that happened to you.”
"DEAN?!"
Miguel looked between the three of them confused. “Okay, why?”
“From where?”
"She seems...nice," Sam commented, grabbing one of the menus, which was covered in greasy fingerprints and specks of dried (what was hopefully) ketchup. "Gross."
“N- no, you

Sam yelled, looking accusingly at his brother.
'I don't wanna leave yet,' Shelby whined, moving the camera closer. 'It's finally getting to the good part. I wanna see 'em come.'
“I was right,” the former angel said, smiling.
Still, Dean Winchester never backed down from a challenge. He scraped his teeth along the nape of Cas' neck, nibbling lightly then sliding his tongue over the freshly marked skin. He felt Cas shiver slightly and Dean grinned knowing the ex-angel was about to break. He pressed in closer, grinding his hardness into the brunet's firm backside and moved a hand down the lean muscle of his chest.

"Come on, Sammy," Dean smirked. "Let the guy enjoy his cream. Cas
They were very drunk.
"Wha' the hell you say, fairy?" the man by the door said, taking a step forward.
“Just talk or are you going to yell at me again?” Cas asked harshly.
"Nothing, man,” Dean said after a long pause. “Sorry, I'm just hungry, I guess."
Sam can’t argue with that. “Just go talk to him. Although you probably shouldn’t mention that little stunt with the coffee. Some things can’t be forgiven.”
“No,” Cas answered. “Why would we need a contraceptive?”
“Yeah, he's more into demons,” Dean commented and wondered what Sam meant by "angel fetish".
Dean sucked around the head, his current position restraining him from taking most of the shaft in very far. Cas seemed to pick up on his plight and gripped the back of his head to hold him still. Dean latched onto the brunet's ass and relaxed his jaw, allowing Cas to thrust into his awaiting mouth unimpeded.
"Yes," the former angel agrees. "Good."

"Do we ever
“Were you guys still sleeping?” Sam asked with a bitchface. “Checkout's in half an hour.” He held up Dean's duffel he brought from the other room.
Dean huffed a laugh before he remembered Cas was even bigger than him and
“Uh-huh.” Her lips curled up in a small grin. “You wanna talk about it?”
would be appropriate.”
Dean clambers into the front seat and slides behind the wheel. Perhaps he’s not ready to head back to the bunker, or maybe because his full bladder is making itself known, but he hesitates to turn the key.
“Understatement,” Cas muttered. “What am I supposed to do until you make a decision? Pretend like it didn't happen?”
“Is that rhetorical or should I make you a list?” Cas huffed and stood up to be level with the hunter. “Your ambiguous sexuality aside, we now know what was said and done last night and I wish to know how you really feel about it.”
Dean cast a sidelong glance at his brother and wondered why Sam was acting like he knew
in here." Dean chuckled at his own joke (because nobody else ever appreciated how freaking hilarious he was) then cut off any further protests by taking Cas' length in his mouth.
attractive." He climbed on the bed, still wearing the cowboy boots and settled between Dean's leg. "You deserve a reward for being such a good patient, don't you think?"
turned him into some kinda kinky evil sonavabitch," he
Dean looked around until he found the bottle of lube on the floor and poured some out. His mouth went back to Cas' cock while his fingers worked the hole open again. It only took a few minutes before Cas was stretched enough and Dean positioned himself between his legs. He grabbed his pillow, placing it under Cas' hips to raise them up then slowly pushed inside. Cas was slick with lube and come from the night before and Dean easily slid all the way in. He moaned when he bottomed out and put all his willpower into not moving until Cas had time to adjust to his girth.
Shelby went to stand behind Cas, placing her hands on his waist, slowly guiding his movements to the beat of the music. 'Just like that, hon,' she encouraged as the tempo picked up and Cas rolled his hips with more confidence.
With a sigh of his own (for dramatic effect, no doubt), Cas climbed out of the car as if it were the most bothersome thing in the world. He leaned against the Impala looking somewhat confused and Dean took the opportunity to give him a once-over. Cas was wearing the new clothes he picked out and Dean mentally high-fived himself for having such impeccable taste. There was no denying it, Cas looked damn good in his new threads. The shirt fit perfectly, as did the dark jeans - which Dean happened to notice as they were leaving the bunker- shaped the ex-angel's ass nicely. Dean nodded in approval.
The clamps tugged at Dean's nipples sending bolts of pleasure to his already throbbing cock, laying heavy and neglected on his belly. “God, I can't take it anymore.” He reached for it, craving release, only to have his hand swatted away.
Cas nodded. Dean still stood with his hand on Cas' shoulder and their eyes locked on each other. Neither said anything else and after a few moments Dean removed his hand from the other man and stepped away. Cas looked almost disappointed when Dean put the distance between them, but Dean decided he was probably imagining it. Without turning his back to Cas (because it would be impolite) Dean backed away slowly until he was at the bedroom door and opened it.
Sam threw up his hands. "I'm leaving!"
“Don't think I'm gonna last long,” he warned. He had been hard far too long and the relief he felt when Cas' mouth closed around him was almost enough to push him over.
“I'm not sure why you want me to be angry, Dean,” Cas admitted. “I still have no memory of the events that took place last night, nor do you, so your current outrage confuses me. We are all unharmed, you now have your car back safely, and we killed the sewer monster before there were any more casualties. Wouldn't you say that's a more successful hunt than most?”
He awkwardly made his way to the garage where the Impala was parked before his brother or the rest came out of the kitchen and saw the state he was in. He briefly thought about going to his room and taking the plug out to end Cas' little game, but he would've been lying if he said he wasn't loving the excitement of it.
Cas' hands slid down the hunter's back until his fingers glided over the elastic band of his boxer-briefs. He was tempted to dip inside and rub his palms over bare skin, but resisted. He didn't want to presume they were going to take things any further. Dean must have sensed his hesitation because he was suddenly moving away. Cas was about to protest at the loss of contact when he heard the rustling sound of fabric and realized Dean was taking off his t-shirt. He once again lamented the fact that he could no longer see in the dark.
Dean's mouth went dry. How the fuck did Cas know? This wasn't just a fantasy of his, this was The Fantasy, right down to those sexy cowboy boots and the man wearing them. Freakin' angel must have read his mind years ago to know about this. He was suddenly and impossibly harder than he had ever been before and his cock
Heat was pooling low in his belly and he knew he wouldn't last. He pumped harder, moving his other hand from kneading his balls to the wall for support. He stroked even faster, pounding into his hand and let out a needy, broken moan. The wet slap of skin was definitely audible over the sound of the shower, but he was too close to coming to slow down. He thought of Cas holding the vibrating dildo, his long fingers gripping the base and it was easy for Dean to imagine it was Cas' hand on his cock, bringing him over the edge. A few more thrusts and Dean burst, grunting out Cas' name as he spilled out over his fist and the shower tile.
“Shut your mouth,” Dean responds. “You didn’t see it the way I did; the whispering, Cas sneaking in and out of your room at all hours. Even some of the stuff I overheard was weird out of context. What else was I supposed to think?”
“Stole, you mean.”
The girls looked at each other with amused and understanding expressions. “How much of last night do you remember?” the redhead asked.
Cas still looked confused, but smiled anyway and let Shelby direct his moves again. The song continued and the girl's hands moved from his sides to slide up under his shirt, rubbing a few times before grabbing the hem and slowly starting to pull up. Cas lightly swatted her hands away and took over. At the same slow pace, he lifted the shirt over his head and then handed it to Shelby, who tossed it at Dean.
marathon. So,
Kevin ran out after them and before the door slammed shut Dean heard one of the men speak up. "Little faggots gotta learn they ain't wanted 'round here."
"Are you coming with us or not?" Dean called out to his brother's retreating form.
Long after they finished eating and had their third round of beers, Dean decided it was time to switch to something stronger. The dinner crowd had cleared out and new bar patrons were beginning to trickle in. Tugging on Cas' shirt sleeve, he slid out of the booth and stood. "C'mon, Cas, time to have a real drink."
Cas wanted to point out that they had been exchanging saliva for much of the past hour, not to mention the fellatio, but instead, he smiled at how contrary Dean Winchester could be and closed his eyes. “Goodnight, Dean.”
Charlie shrugged and grinned.
Sam's eye narrowed. “You didn't blame him did you?”
Cas pulled away suddenly, sliding off the hunter's lap to stand. Dean whined and reached out to him, but Cas shook his head and smiled seductively. Hooking his thumbs under the waist of the jeans, he pulled them down and kicked them off to the side. The camera moved in to get a close-up of the prominent bulge straining against the thin cotton of his boxers.
“Sweet,” she said, happily. “Promise to never,
“I do, Dean.” Cas smiled. “I have thought about it
Dean slowly opened his eyes and blinked a few times. It was still bright and his vision blurred, but he didn't feel the need to immediately close them again, so it was progress. He felt a hand on his arm, helping him up; the sudden movement making him dizzy and he swayed when the hand let go. When he steadied himself he carefully let his eyes travel around the room. The first thing he noticed was his brother's giant figure standing a few steps away. Sam's face was bright red and had his eyes glued to the wall behind Dean. The second thing he noticed was they were not in their motel room. The room was bigger, cleaner, the furniture new and modern and unlike the shabby double room they had booked the day before, this one only had one king size bed. That observation led Dean to making his third discovery: Cas' prone form laying spread eagle on the bed, completely naked and sporting some serious morning wood.
“I’m not stupid, Sam,” Dean responds. “Took me all of one day to figure it out. Not that you guys were being subtle.”
Dean was staring at Cas, trying to figure out if he had just been insulted or not when a waitress appeared, tossing three dinner menus on the table. Dean's head snapped up in surprise and he wondered how people kept managing to sneak up on him. He couldn't think of anything that was unusually distracting lately and it was starting to hurt his professional pride.
“Seriously, Sam, turn this shit off.”
He was on his side, Cas behind him with his arm wrapped around the hunter's waist. Dean felt Cas' erection poking him in the ass and it was a pleasant distraction from realizing that not only were they spooning, but somehow he had become the little spoon. He kinda liked it.
Cas reached down to pick up his discarded t-shirt and used it to clean the drying come from their stomachs. He tossed the soiled shirt on the floor again and rolled on his side to face Dean. “You already know the answer, but if you insist I say it, I will.” He lightly brushed his fingers over Dean’s cheek and leaned forward until their lips were barely touching. “But not until you’re ready to hear it.”
Dean slapped his thighs and gestured for Cas to climb back on his lap. 'C'mon, Cas, you promised me a lapdance.'
“I thought by now you would know how much I value our time together, Dean,” Cas says. “Of course, I would notice your absence.”
Cas couldn't hold back his moan; grabbing a fistful of hair he pulled out completely. Dean licked his lips clean and proudly smirked up at his partner. “I
When Dean was getting close he sped up, but only slightly, still keeping it tender in a way he had never been with anyone else before. He fit his hand between them, placing a firm grip around Cas’ length and began to stroke him. Cas moaned and tightened his legs, pushing the hunter in deeper. Dean gasped at the feeling, thrusting more rapidly until he suddenly came with a grunt, filling the former angel once again. His hand around Cas stopped moving as he rode through his orgasm and Cas’ replaced it with his own, taking hold of his rigid cock and jerked himself until he spilled out over both of their stomachs.
Sam wondered how long it would take Dean and Castiel to realize that he left them with all the clean up work.
He pulled the shorter man closer, grabbing him by the waist and locked their lips together again. This time Dean took the lead, his tongue finding its way in to explore Cas' mouth when the ex-angel parted his lips to let it in. Dean moved them backwards until Cas was standing against the door. With a firm surface giving them support, Dean pressed into Cas' body and rocked their hips together. His mouth trailed down to kiss under Cas' jaw and then to his neck, where he bit and sucked, leaving red marks as he went. Cas tipped his head back to give him more access and Dean took full advantage of the angle. His hand slid up under his shirt, ghosting over smooth skin and Cas' breath hitched when Dean found his nipples and tugged lightly on each of the nubs. He kept a hand under the button down flannel – one of his he didn't remember giving to the former angel – and continued to tease the nipples while slowly bringing the other hand down to palm over the hardening length in Cas' pants.
Cas shakes his head in denial. “Dean, you have barely spoken to me in days, and when you have, it’s been terse. You have also rebuffed every attempt I’ve made to spend time together.” He points to the laptop on the bed as proof.
“Although, perhaps I should not have shared that with you, either,” Cas muttered as an afterthought.
"Oh, yeah?" Dean says with a cocky smirk. "Could’ve at least bought me flowers first."
Dean considered the question and shook his head. “I don't know. I care about him.”
“That so?” Dean said and laid down. Fuck it. If Cas wasn't getting up then neither was he. “You gonna sleep in here tonight?”
“Freakin' Charlie's been showing you all that feminist girl-power stuff, huh?”
Dean lost what little reserve he had and strode forward, clutching his fists. “Yeah, he is my boyfriend and it ain't none of your goddamn business who I'm in love with, so shut the fuck up about
“Eww,” Kevin made a face. “Did you really have to say that?”
Dean smirked. “Sure I did. Bet you didn't steal my wallet and cash either, huh?”
Cas responded by increasing the speed of his movements, pulling back, then thrusting in with a little more force. Dean could tell by his expression he was holding back, fighting the urge to drive into him furiously.
"Why do we have to leave the bunker to drink?" Cas questioned with a skeptical frown. "There is more than enough beer and various bottles of alcohol here to sufficiently inebriate us. For quite some time I would imagine."
“It's a hobby,” Sam responded.
"Hol' what?" Cas asked as he stumbled forward then laughed loudly when Dean's arm wrapped around his waist to keep him steady. Cas leaned into the touch and smiled up at Dean.
"'t's different every time," Cas thrust up into the hunter's fist, "but there's less talking," he said between groans of pleasure when Dean began to pump faster. "And we're usually naked."
“Magic, in general,” Dean says, hoping he’ll buy it. “Just thought after that last case it might be good to refresh some of my witchy knowledge. For next time.”
from getting adequate sleep?"
“God, I really fucked up, didn't I?” He frowned. “He's so pissed at me right now, I don't even know how to make it up to him.”
“Cas and my
plotting.
Cas was gone and the door pulled shut behind him before Dean was able to register what his friend had said.
He knew the "honeymoon phase" of their new romantic relationship had to end eventually, but couldn't help that he had gotten used to waking up with the ex-angel and his seemingly insatiable sex-drive. Not that he was able to keep track, but Dean guessed he had gotten off more in just a few weeks with Cas than he did the whole year he lived with Lisa. One of the perks of dating a dude, he supposed (also, not having a kid in the next room helped). Then again, he wondered if it was just a
"Take off your shirt," Cas ordered.
“Situation?” Cas repeated. “You're referring to the development of our relationship? You told me you were sure, Dean. You said that you wanted it. Wanted
Cas finally looked down at his dick, barely covered by the bed sheet. “This penis has become a daily inconvenience,” he grumbled.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Uh, yeah, I guess it does. But hey, nothing worth doin's easy,” he japed, taking the box and setting it on the shelf.
Dean shakes his head and wonders if Cas is about to reveal his and Sam’s not so well-kept secret. “He didn’t give details on what went down.”
“Alright. I have a question to ask you,” Cas said, laying back down to rest his head on Dean's chest.
“Their mother is dead and they won’t survive on their own,” Sam explains.
"No, I had already relieved myself," Cas stated matter-of-factly.
Dean waited in the car while Cas ran inside Lebanon's tiny post office. The brunet made no attempt to share with him what business he could've possibly had there and Dean thought he detected a mischievous gleam in the angel's eye when he had asked. It only took a few minutes before he spotted Cas walking back to the car holding a medium-sized brown box. Dean's eyebrows raised in interest because
Stunned, Cas' hands halted their slow, but sure to be epic journey to Dean's ass. "What do you mean?"
He was definitely going to need something stronger than beer soon.
Sam’s point is immediately proven when Dean wobbles and has to clutch the back of the chair in front of him to steady himself. The duffel hanging on his shoulder falls to the floor with a thump and Dean glares down at it as if it’s betrayed him. "I'm fine, Sammy," he responds. "Took the meds and I'll be right as rain by the time we get there."
“You didn't watch the videos?”
“Although, that's probably a touchy subject,” she went on, mistaking Cas' confusion with discomfort. “Sorry, sometimes my mouth doesn't have a filter.” She laughed nervously. “Let's start over. Hi, I'm Charlie.”
“Sorry,” Dean muttered halfheartedly. Nobody appreciated his humor. “But this is good. Means last night's not a total black out.”
"Dean?" Cas said, one corner of his mouth curling up with the hint of a smile. "Stop what?"
“Yes, Dean, you were right. How prescient of you,” Cas responded sardonically. “I suppose statistically it was bound to happen, eventually.”
“I don't have a mother.”
The man kept his arm wrapped around Cas as his eyes traced over Sam's body a few times, as if trying to ingrain it to his memory. “Rubin.” He held out the hand that was not slowly making its way down to Cas' ass for Sam to shake. “All the boys call me RuRu.”
He was considering it when another yawn reminded him of how late it was - and that he had been half-asleep already when his angel sent him on the Holy - and failed - quest for water. “'M tired, babe,” he said, too sleepy to care about using the term of endearment.
It’s not that he hasn’t imagined how this might go if he were ever stupid or drunk enough to cross the line with Cas; he just never allowed himself to believe that his friend would respond positively by kissing him back.
“It's really not a big deal,” Dean said irritated. He was regretting not allowing himself more time to adjust to the plug before leaving the bathroom. “I stepped on a paper clip in the hallway because
Sam rolled his eyes. “It's not like she'll judge you, Dean,” he responded. “In fact, she'll probably geek out over it finally happening.”
Dean stared down and the man beneath him and blinked. Cas looked up at him, a curious expression on his face as if he wasn't sure what just happened, but he was glad that it had.
“You asked me how long I have been in love with you,” Cas responded without moving his head from its resting place. “The answer is: since I've known you. Your soul was the most beautiful thing I had seen in all of my long existence. How could I not love you?”
'Later then,' Dean responded uninterested and resumed tongue fucking Cas' mouth.
“I would also like know,” Cas said and shifted closer to Dean to watch the screen.
They wouldn’t do this to him.
bad highlights.” Miguel cringed. “She bore a striking resemblance to a skunk, actually. I felt like it was my civic duty to point it out to her, but Boss says if I get one more complaint for insulting customers, she'll fire me.” He scoffed. “
Dean smiled, amused that his friend literally only watched porn for educational purposes. "And?"
Cas was standing at the foot of his bed, completely naked with a bundle of clean clothes held under one arm and a look Dean couldn't identify on his face. Not that Dean was looking at his face.
“In private, Cas. Please.”
“No, you can wear that.” Dean gestured to the black Pink Floyd shirt and jeans the ex-angel was currently wearing. He didn't want to push his luck by suggesting an outfit change. Besides, the t-shirt was a little tight across Cas' chest and biceps and it made him look a little more muscular than he was.
let me come.”
"Your hands are cold," Cas complained.
Dean hummed in approval as Cas climbed on top of him. He kissed him eagerly and before long they were both ready to go again.
Cas waited for Dean to reply. If the Impala wasn't locked he would have already gone to sleep in the backseat. A few hours of rest would be worth catching a cold.
trying to
Cas opened both eyes. “May I join you?”
Cas was flat on top of Dean now, kissing up his chest over the fabric of his shirt, which was still on for some reason. Dean made a sleepy hum of approval and closed his eyes. By the time Cas made his way back to Dean's mouth, the hunter was snoring softly.
Cas thrusts a little harder, pounding Dean into the wall while gripping the hunter’s ass and gliding him up and down his shaft. Dean tightens his hold around the angel’s waist, ankles locked together and pushes down to fuck himself.
Almost on cue, the plug kicked to life, instantly switching from a slow lazy vibration to rapidly pounding inside of him. Dean yelled out at the unexpected sensation and quickly reached in his pocket to grab the remote he had lifted: it was no longer there. He realized then that Cas must have snatched it back while he was rubbing against him.
He thinks Cas is about to crack but before he can question him further, Sam announces, "I taught Cas how to drive.”
Dean snorted and buried his face in the crook of Cas' neck to laugh.
were under a spell, right?”
“No,” Cas admitted solemnly. “I feel...strange.”
Dean pulled Cas out of the store by his shirt sleeve. Sam was already back in the car and was in the middle of texting someone when Dean opened the door and dropped down in the seat with a huff.
Cas got the message and his movements became more rapid. He found a
He was just stepping under the spray of warm water when he heard the door in the other room slam shut.
“When we encountered the witches, I realized I was able to sense the mystical energy created by their spell work,” Cas says proudly.
Dean laughed to himself when he heard Sam make and affronted noise and shuffle down the hallway. He rolled over to face the brunet and was meet with sleepy blue eyes.
Cas turned off the television and set the remote beside him. “I don't know what 'jerking it' is, Dean, but I am well aware of my current species status, thank you. As for accompanying you to this 'strip club', I would like to point out that you did not actually ask me to go, you
Suddenly extremely nervous, he crossed the room and plopped down in a chair opposite the chatting pair. In his haste to make sure Cas wasn't over sharing (again) and telling her about his latest idea of sexy fun, Dean somehow forgot that he had the plug in and winced in pain when his ass slammed down on the hard wood of the kitchen chair.
"Sometimes," he admitted. He shuddered and moaned when Dean's calloused hand encased him and started to gently stroke. "
“Well, y'know,” Dean started awkwardly. How do you explain the purposes of a rubber to someone who thinks
Dean's cock twitched and he balled his fists in the sheets to keep from stroking it. Cas took his time undressing before climbing on the bed and settled next to the hunter. He ran his hands over Dean's muscled torso and down to rub the silky material covering Dean's erection. Dean moaned at the touch and rolled his hips.
Dean stumbles and nearly falls on his ass. The glare from the rising sun prevents him from seeing inside the cab from this angle, but he thinks he can almost hear the sound of her cackling over the truck’s rumbling engine.
Interesting.
"It will no longer be Christmas tomorrow," the brunet responded.
“You sure?”
Cas tapped his foot impatiently.
Dean's ass. The metal frame of the old bed squeaked violently and threatened to collapse.
“Only if it's sincere.”
“It was an accident, Cas. Sorry.”
Dean's voice rang out down the hall. The moaning seemed to get louder the further Sam got from the bathroom as if it were
Castiel's gaze moved from the screen to Dean's face. The hunter was beet red, staring down at his boots and his hands shaking slightly. “Dean, do you think we should talk about it?”
“Yes, actually,” she answered and smirked. “Took all of five minutes once I found it. Hot stuff, by the way, really loved the pink panties. Oh, and congrats; that angel's got a nice package.”
“Can we talk?” Dean asked, not really knowing how to start the conversation.
With a facade of confidence, Dean squared his shoulders and walked around Sam, opening the bright yellow door for the others to enter first.
“So you wanna catch a movie or head back?”
His grip tightened around his swollen cock and he fucked up into his fist with more force. Somewhere in his mind he knew he didn't want to be getting off while fantasizing about Cas. It was wrong to envision his friend's dick and think about how it would feel inside of him. Or how he would feel buried deep inside of Cas. He didn't want to be imagining the wanton noises Cas would make as he pounded into him, or if he would scream Dean's name when he came.
Dean took another step forward, clinching his fists so tight his knuckles turned white. “Cas. Car.
"Try not to drive the poor kid crazy while we're gone," Sam says.
“Evidently,” Sam answered sounding equally as fascinated as he was disgusted. The stench of the thing was increasing as more of the slimy substance spilled out.
The poor kid must've been locked up underground too long.
He took a few deep breaths to regain composer and cleared his throat. “Yeah, I – 'm good.”
Cas, however, did not wait for Dean to look away before he lifted his threadbare shirt over his head and tossed it to a pile in the corner. Dean made it into the hallway and while his gaze never left Cas (because of the impolite thing) he absolutely was not lingering at the door to watch his friend strip. Nor was he staring at Cas' well-defined (and somehow tanned?) body. His eyes certainly were not traveling to where Cas' slightly too-large jeans hung down low on his waist, exposing the Enochian wards tattooed just above his perfectly shaped hipbones. And Dean
should soon. I'm sure you've noticed, but Castiel his gorgeous and he isn't going to wait around forever for you to work up the nerve.” She smiled at the blush creeping up the hunter's face. “Actually, based on what I've read about him and what you've told me, he would totally wait for you, but is it fair to expect him to?”
“Is there anything else you can remember?” Sam questioned. He really wanted to wrap up the interview and get the hell out of there.
Sam snorted. "You should have bought him dinner first."
“Okay. So, you guys are playing
“Me too, buddy,” Dean said, looking away. “You might wanna put on some clothes, by the way.”
not a problem). Dean didn't question him about it. He assumed it had to do with Cas' propensity for sticking with a certain “style” once he became accustom to it; hence five years of the same baggy suit and trench coat.
Cas noticed Sam was too busy trying to hold in a laugh to continue the interview so he showed Miguel the receipt he had found. “Were these the items that we purchased?”
When Dean didn't respond Cas buried his head in the crook of Dean's neck and closed his eyes.
“Why, because that would be too gay for you?”
thinking about another man. Because angel or not, Cas had a dick so there was no distinction in Dean's mind.
“Not yet,” Cas responded and went to the dresser to gather up his new toys and brought them to the bed. “I have work to do first.”
They were only been parked for half an hour before Dean shot up in his seat with an angry “sonuvabitch", startling the other two.
Dean barely chewed before swallowing a mouthful. "So moist." He licked his lips suggestively.
Dean was quiet as his brother led the way up to the main door. He wasn't stupid. When Cas had said the name, he knew it had to be some sort of gay club and that terrified him for reasons which were becoming almost impossible to ignore. His only solace being anything that happened the night before could be blamed on the fact that they were under the influence of an unknown drug. Still, he was worried it might bring up questions that he'd rather not have to answer. He shook a mental fist at the universe for making his life even more complicated than it already was.
“Come on, Sam,” Dean says. “Don’t make me out to be the bad guy here. I’m just thinking rationally.”
Sam huffs and crosses his arms over his chest. “You’re too old for stupid pranks, Dean!”
when he orders extra bacon on his cheeseburger.
Cas smiled and took Dean’s cock in hand, stroking a few times before moving his mouth over it and slowly licking up the shaft. When he got to the leaking head, he swiped his tongue over the slit, tasting the precome. Dean watched Cas wrap his full lips around the crown of his cock and he moaned, carding his fingers through Cas' dark hair and forcing himself not to thrust up. Cas moved down the shaft agonizing slow, taking as much in as he could without gagging. He pulled up and sucked, swirling his tongue around and went back down with more ease. With each slide up he ran his tongue over the head of Dean's slit then moved back down, taking him in deeper each time. After a few minutes, Cas was more confident and began bobbing his head faster, listening to Dean moan his name as he worked him with his mouth. He brought one hand up to knead Dean’s balls, gently squeezing every time he worked his mouth up the length. Dean’s groaned loudly, gripping Cas’ hair tighter and he couldn't stop himself from thrusting deep into the wet heat, hitting the back of Cas' throat. Cas gagged and pulled off.
Another scene started with Dean slowly pulling off Cas' boxers. The camera zoomed in on Cas' dick laying heavy against his stomach and the head glistening with precome. Dean blocked the shot when he moved back up Cas' body and straddled him.
Dean placed his hand over the other man's and moved it up to his crotch. He didn't think he could get hard again so soon after coming (he wasn't as young as he used to be, after all) but to his surprise he was already halfway there thanks to the attention. Cas moved his hand around, rubbing slow circles over the growing bulge and Dean tried and failed to be subtle when he bucked his hips up to get more friction. Unfortunately, it happened at the very moment Sam had turned to ask Cas about continuing their game and the younger Winchester knew instantly what was going on.
“That's not funny.” Dean sat down on the bed and gestured for her to do the same.
“Dammit, Cas, stop touching the dildos.”
“Before, you asked me a question and said you wanted and honest answer,” Dean shut the door, turning the lock, and went to stand in front of his friend. “My turn. How long have you been in love with me, Cas?”
. "Clear enough?"
They ended up stopping at a diner for dinner and it was well after dark before they made it back to the motel. Dean went straight to his phone as soon as he opened the door to his and Cas' room. Turning it on, he sat down on his bed and Cas sat next to him, a little further apart than he usually would have.
Cas took Dean's hand and brought it around to feel his entrance. Dean's fingers traced over something solid blocking the hole. “What's this?”
Cas shrugged slightly, ignoring Dean's glare and turned his attention back to the nature program about honey bees he was watching.
“Only if you want to label yourself,” she replied. “Or you could just be
Dean’s clock tells him it’s just after seven in the morning when he crawls out of bed and throws on his dead guy robe.
“Almost,” Cas replied as he pulled up his pants. “I expect the fucking part will come later.”
On the downside, learning to function in a human body without the buffer of his grace had been somewhat of a challenge. He now had certain bodily needs and
Mia reached out and tapped Dean's head. He reluctantly broke away and glared up at the brunette woman. 'Sorry to interrupted your coming out party, but we're gonna go and give ya'll some privacy.'
“It did not happen during our love making, if that's what you mean,” Cas told her, ignoring Kevin's question.
Dean hums in agreement and picks up a piece of bacon. It smells delicious and he hopes he can keep it down. He'll have to talk to Cas about intimidating the kid – because he's pretty sure it wasn't Kevin's idea to make him a balanced breakfast – but for now, he's not complaining. "Thanks, Kev."

“Fooled around?” Dean asked at the same time.
“It was my
,” Cas responded, barely containing his amusement.
“Miguel?”
Cas sat up when Dean returned and threw his arms around the hunter, pushing him to his back.
Wild Cherry's was only a few minutes away from the sex shop and was completely deserted when they arrived. The sign on the door showed the club wouldn't open for another couple of hours. Sam parked the stolen car in the back of the lot, away from the street, and they decided to wait.
He closed his eyes and desperately tried to recall scenes from his favorite pornos, the latest issue of Busty Asian Beauties, even some of his own conquests, but everything led back to blue eyes, a deep gravelly voice and those goddamn hips with the Enochian tattoo. His dick pulsed in his hand.
“You're not gonna break me, Cas,” Dean said, goading him to move faster. Sure, they both enjoyed unhurried, tender sex (he still didn't want to call it "love making"), but tonight, he wanted to get
Cas chuckled softly. "I was holdin' it in for over an
that left Dean a wriggling mess
“So Cas, did you get an answer to that anal plug question?” Sam asked, knowing how uncomfortable it was making Dean.
Dean took Cas' hand in his and led him to the bed. It was incredibly corny and made him feel like a girl, but he needed Cas to know what he was feeling, even if he couldn't adequately express it with words. He wasn't sure himself what he was doing, but he knew it felt right. He pulled Cas down on the bed and climbed on top to straddle him. Leaning down he softly brushed his mouth over Cas' and the former angel brought his head up to captured Dean's teasing lips with his. Dean smiled into the kiss. He kind of liked the idea of Cas taking charge. Dean titled his head to run his mouth over Cas' jawline. Neither had shaved since the day before and Cas' stubble was scratchy, but he couldn't find it in himself to care. He trailed his lips down Cas' chin to his neck, gently nibbling and sucking on the exposed skin.
Whatever retort Dean had planned died at the back of his throat and could only stand there dumbly, blinking a few times. Cas seemed rather impassive about the whole situation as he stood next to Dean, gauging his reactions.
“We're getting dangerously close to crossing a line in our friendship, Cas.”
Kevin laughed. “Robin is boss, dude.
" which the hunter was sure (and didn’t care) that the rest of the motel could hear. Cas arched his back, tightened his grip on Dean's shoulder and released, shooting hot ropes of white over both of their stomachs. Dean thrust forward a few more times, working Cas through his orgasm then followed his friend over the edge. His come covered their hands and mixed with Cas’ and he collapsed on top of the other man, not caring about the mess between them.
“Awesome,” Dean said trying not to sound as nervous as he was feeling. He leaned forward and gave Cas another quick kiss. “You should get cleaned up before dinner. You look like someone just gave you the best fuck of your life.”
“This isn't about me right now,” Dean told him. Cas already did enough shit just because Dean wanted it. This was going to be about Cas. “It's my turn to make you happy for a change.”
“Why aren't you more pissed about this?” Dean asked turning his head to look at Cas.
'Hey, guys,' Mia flopped down of the bed next to them. 'This is hot and all, but it's getting a little close to cheesy love confession territory. I think we're gonna get outta here.”
Cas moved his hand down and rubbed his palm over the hunter's groin. “I can make it up to you now.”
Dean was writhing, the vibrations from the cock ring sending spikes of pleasure through him and he clutched helplessly at the bedsheets.
Cas considered the question and smiled. "I supposed not."
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas brought their lips together again and ran his hands over Dean's body, paying special attention to the bulge in his pants. Dean moaned into his partner's mouth and thrust forward, wanting more contact. “Save it for this evening,” Cas said, pulling away suddenly. “Give me a few minutes and I'll be ready to leave.”
Dean quickly searched the rest of the room while Cas sat on the bed (trying to will his boner away, Dean guessed) and Sam stood off to the side looking more uncomfortable than Dean had ever seen him. He found his phone sitting by the sink in the bathroom, its battery nearly dead, but that was it.
"Thankfully," Sam continued, "my iPod was charged so I didn't have to listen to it that long. Still, I barely got any sleep thanks to you two jerks."
Dean moaned when he was penetrated and arched his back off the bed. The movement pulled at the nipple clamps and the dual sensations sent out radiating waves of pleasure. Cas eased the vibrator in most of the way before turning it on and adjusting it to pulsate at the lowest setting.
Cas chuckled softly. “I would like to try them sometime.”
“We’re sorry about that,” Sam says. “But I’m the one who convinced Cas not to tell you.”
“Awesome,” Dean muttered nervously. If the incorrigible redhead was involved, Cas probably ended up buying a leather gimp mask and assless chaps for him to wear. Dean was down with trying new things, but that was a little too much for him. “So you wanna blow off research today and drive up to Hastings?” he asked in part to get his mind off of the box, but mostly because he wasn't ready to return to the crowded bunker. “We could hit a few shops, grab some lunch and maybe check out a movie if there's anything good showing.”
Looking around, Dean found a pile of their clothes on the other side of the bed and groaned inwardly when he found a second dildo next to their discarded pants. It was a dark red, ridged, with a large purple head, and was a little smaller than the black one - which was still buzzing wildly under the bed. Dean quickly removed the pink lingerie and put on his boxers and jeans. Once he was dressed he braced himself to wake up his sleeping friend.
Dean tore his gaze away from Cas and looked at his brother.
“So yes, everything that went down last night is completely on me, not you.”

to a couple of garden rats?” Dean says. “Why hide it?”
"You boys drinkin' t'night or just havin' supper?" She asked with a deep raspy voice that could only have come from decades of smoking. She was probably only in her early 50's, but there were deep wrinkles and a yellow tint to her teeth and fingernails that made her look far older.
Dean gasped and snatched the cock ring away, throwing it in the trash bin. “Don't look,” he snapped when Sam started to turn to see what Cas had found. Dean tossed the ex-angel his clothes. “Just get dressed.”

“Yes, it is,” Dean stated firmly. “I was selfish. You said you didn't wanna go to the club, but I pushed anyway because I knew you'd give in eventually. You

“Come inside me, Dean,” Cas groaned, his head tipped back as he pumped himself towards release. “Want - wanna feel it wh-” his words turned into an obscene moan when the thought of it pushed him over and he came hard, shooting white streams over Dean's belly.
,” Dean groaned. He lifted his knees and spread his legs a little more. Cas leaned forward to kiss each of his thighs and slowly pulled the vibrator out most of the way, twisted it around, then plunged back in. After a few thrusts, he turned the setting up higher and continued to move it in and out, changing the angle occasionally.
Things seem relatively normal the rest of the day, except when Sam immediately waved off Dean’s suggestion that they look for a hunt now that he’s feeling better, and Cas’ random and frequent trips to the bathroom.
The boys head to a bar for the night.
“What did I do wrong, Dean?”
“No.” Dean's heart sank. “Goddammit, they better not hurt my Baby. We have to find her.”
response from the former angel. "Uh-"
“Shift starts at five so he should be in pretty soon.”
Cas didn’t realize he had been vocalizing his thoughts aloud, muffled by the pillow as they were, until Dean reached up to pull the pillow out of his grasp and threw it off the bed. He let Cas' cock slip from his mouth and said, "I wanna hear every fucking moan," he cupped Cas' balls in one hand and licked over the sensitive area, "every whimper," he kissed his way back up the long, swollen shaft, "every goddamn
“We did
“Why can't I say it when it's true?” Cas asked, canting his head. “You know, after I lost my grace, I expected to be turned away when I came to the bunker that night. I wouldn't have blamed you. I've done terrible things and without my powers I no longer served a useful purpose in your life. But, instead of telling me to leave you let me inside, made me tomato soup, gave me dry clothes, and a warm bed to sleep in. And I've felt such guilt for thinking you would have done anything other than show me kindness.”
Then there was the memorable time Dean had stopped by Cas' room one night after a shower wearing nothing but a threadbare towel wrapped low around his waist. His skin had still been flushed from the heat of the shower and there had been little droplets of water falling from his hair that dripped enticingly down his chest. Dean hadn't even needed anything, just commented that the water pressure was "awesome" (which had long been established) then said "Night, Cas" and left. Cas had gone to bed with what he now knew was the thrum of arousal and had his first erotic dream that very night.
"Seriously?" Dean would celebrate his victory except Cas' tone indicated that he was still upset. “You sure? We don't have to.”
“Holy shit, Cas,” Dean huffed out after a moment. “Tell me how you really feel.”
Sam initially thought the "Rainbow Cabaret" was some sort of gay bar, but a quick internet search reveled that it was actually a gay sex club with a cinema that only showed adult films. Sam had neglected to share that information with the other two (for so many reasons), but now that they found the place, he was starting to feel guilty.
“Ugh!” Sam and Kevin groaned simultaneously. “Don't start, Dean,” Sam warned and took a seat at the table.
Dean brought his elbow back to lightly hit the other man. “You better make this up to me tomorrow.”
The angel’s eyes flash blue for a second and the shouting from the other side of the wall stops abruptly. Dean doesn’t care enough to ask because the new position allows Cas to penetrate him deeper, letting Dean feel every inch of him when Cas resumes thrusting inside. Dean pulls him down until their bodies are flush and crashes their mouths together with a desperate force. Cas’ pace increases, his movements becoming more frantic as he propels his pelvis between Dean’s spread legs. When the angle changes and Cas’ dick pushes into his prostate, Dean reaches for his neglected cock only to have his hand wrenched away. Cas silences Dean’s protest with a kiss to his jaw and carries on pounding into him vigorously, gyrating his hips, and fucking with abandon before finally taking him in his hand.
Dean stepped into the shower and sighed in relief when the cool water hit his overheated skin. He rested his head against the tile wall, letting the spray wash over his back and his mind started to wander.
“Do you mind?”
“Please, Cas,” Dean whined. He was too far gone to give a crap about the fact that he was begging. “You got me too worked up with that thing. I need
"What?" Dean said.
“Do you hear that?” Cas asked suddenly, getting to his feet. His eyes narrowed, head cocked, and immediately crouched down to look under the bed. Dean's eyes went wide with panic, but before he could stop him, Cas reappeared, vibrating black dildo held firmly in hand. “Dean?”
first time and I want it to be perfect."
“Oh, uh, yeah.” Miguel looked uncomfortably between Dean and Cas. “Well, you guys did mention that neither of you had been with a man before and that you needed to learn how, and I quote, 'two dudes do it'.” He gestured to Dean. “He wanted to buy some gay porn, but the DVD's we have here suck. I recommended the theater at the Cabaret. It’s open 24 hours and the production values on the films they show are fairly decent. Not that anyone spends a lot of time just watching them.”
“No,” Dean says gruffly. “Like I said, just curious.”
“What's that?” Sam asked curiously.
“C'mon, time to get up,” he said loudly, standing over his sleeping friend.
“Then figure it out,” he says. “No pets in the bunker!”
Yawning, Cas raised his arms and spread out his legs to stretch. When his leg moved over something on the bed, he reached under the sheet and pulled out a thick black silicone ring. “Dean, what is this?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says. “May I come in?”
Dean paused the video. He wanted to tell Cas that they shouldn't watch any more of it. He wanted to delete everything and act like it never happen. He
Before Dean could voice his concern with using cooking oil as lube, the slick digits were already circling his entrance. He took a deep breath to relax and allowed Cas' finger to breach the tight ring of muscle.
Before Dean could form his stunned thoughts into words (how difficult was it to say
“Clean up your trash!” the woman yells.
Dean moved around the room for several minutes, purposely being as distracting as possible, but Cas paid no attention to him. Dean didn't understand what was so fascinating about a bunch of stupid flying insects anyway and he was irritated with Cas for focusing more on the TV than him. Then it suddenly occurred to Dean that he was the one who had been mostly avoiding his friend the last couple of weeks and clearly Cas didn't appreciate being ignored anymore than he did. His anger instantly abated.
, that's hot," Dean's voice shuddered and he let out a shaky moan when the brunet's tongue swiped over his cockhead, lapping up a mixture of the dessert and pre-come. Dean gripped the edge of the table and carded his fingers through Cas' hair with his free hand, tugging at the dark strands and thrusting up every time the ex-angel's tongue passed over his throbbing dick. "C'mon, enough teasing. This was supposed to be a quickie."
Cas stood from his kneeling position and moved between the hunter's parted legs. “Next time, you will wear shoes,” he corrected with a small smile. “Or turn on a light so you don't accidentally impale yourself on seemingly innocuous office supplies.”
Deciding it was worth the risk and he could apologize to Sam in the morning, he sucked in a deep breath and let out a couple of fake coughs. It was something he had seen the brothers do on occasion to get the others attention. Forcing himself to cough was unpleasant and made his throat sore, but he tried a few more times before giving up. The snoring only seemed to grow louder, anyway. He rolled on his side and tightly held a pillow over his head for a few minutes– a futile attempt to muffle the increasing sound.
"You're damn right I'm suffering," Dean whined. "Anything you can do about that,
He huffed a laugh, because yeah, she was pretty awesome. “So, do I gotta start saying I'm bisexual now?”
, indeed.
"Is the pie to your liking, Dean?" The former angel asked taking a small bite of his own slice. "I wasn't sure which kind you prefer so I got an apple pie as well."
Dean snorted and wrapped his hands around Cas' length. '
“Okay,” Cas agreed. “I still don't understand what you're asking me, though.”
“Uh-huh,” Dean said, skeptically. “And what was I doing that was
“Ask politely.”
“Then yes,” Dean answered. “Cas, I'm going out tonight and you're coming with me.”
“What the hell is wrong with you?” Sam asks. “Do you really not care about hurting Cas?”
“You're a prophet? That sounds pretty cool.”
“C'mon, babe, I need more.”
"Y'know, Cas," Castiel's breath hitched when he felt Dean's calloused fingers lightly ghost over the back of his hand, “you get real flirty when you're sleepy. I kinda like it.” Dean's voice was low, with a hint of amusement and something the ex-angel recognized from the times he'd seen the hunter talking to attractive women (and men, on a rare occasion when he thought no one would notice). Dean was also being
Cas stumbles back stunned. “Dean?”
“Warm it up next time,” he said, but they both knew he wasn't upset. He moved his hand down to feel it but Cas caught his wrist and held him back.
“I'm sure.”
Cas managed to lift himself up and pulled his softening length out of Dean. He kicked off the cowboy boots and rolled over to lay on his side. With pupils blown he looked at Dean with a blissful expression. "That's the same thing you said about the pie."
Two days later, Dean was sitting in his room where he had spent most of his time since they got back. Sorting out his thoughts was proving to be a difficult task and he kept getting distracted watching the video taken the night they had been drugged. He had deleted the recording from the strip club and the one filmed outside of the bathhouse, but couldn't bring himself to erase the one of him and Cas. He was in the middle of watching it for the third time in a row when a text message from an unknown number came through:
Cas frowned. "This method appears to be ineffective at curing your ailment," he said and tossed the whip over his shoulder in annoyance.
“Dean? You haven't said anything,” Cas spoke after a minute. “If you're uncomfortable you don't have to watch this with me.”
"What the fuck?"
“That was-”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas replied and pushed the hunter back in the seat. “It doesn't appear today will be
obvious that he wants you too, so what's holding you back?”
"...Yeah," Dean muttered, sounding embarrassed. "Sorry. I'm usually better at this."
“Like I said, not complaining.”
“You don't have to put on a brave front with me, Dean,” Cas said in a (completely unconvincing) reassuring tone. “You've sustained a terrible injury.”
Accepting their relationship doesn’t mean he’s going to be an adult about it.
“Apologies,” Cas says, eyes examining the various tomes, journals, and documents laid out on the surface of the table. “What are you looking for?”
"How'd you guys know we were in trouble anyway?" Dean asked after a few minutes.
Dean nodded even though Cas had his head down and couldn't see the gesture. He knew where this was headed. “You mean when I told some fucking hillbilly assholes that I loved you when I haven't had the balls to say it to your face?”
“Okay, and did you tell Cas that's what's going on or did you just suddenly start acting like a ass to push him away?” Dean's guilty expression was all the answer Sam needed. “Dean, you've got to tell him.”
a headache now,” Sam scolded. “We're almost there.”
The point is Dean’s over Castiel’s martyr bullshit.
“I'll give you guys some time,” Sam said and gestured to the window where he could see Cas outside waiting for them by the car. “Make it right, Dean.”
"Yes," Cas answered seriously. "There are many i
of talking with a
That statement was followed by two loud thuds and a crash that shook the whole wall. Afraid his brother was getting his ass handed to him, Dean let go of Cas, ordering Kevin to take him to the car and he ran back into the restroom. To his relief, and surprise, Sam was perfectly fine. Two of the men were slumped on the floor with blood dripping from their noses, and Sam had the third man pinned to the wall. A faded painting of a cowboy on horseback had been knocked down and the frame was smashed on the cheap linoleum floor. As Dean's eyes landed on his brother, Sam pulled the man's head back and slammed it into the wall, breaking his nose with a sickening crack. The man howled in pain and dropped to the floor as soon and Sam released him.
They both moaned when their cocks met, but Cas quickly pulled away before Dean could do it again. He positioned himself between Dean's legs again and picked up the lube with force.
Using the sleeve of his shirt, Kevin slid another menu in front of him trying to touch it a little as possible. "Do you think they serve anything
like your body,” Cas admitted and snuggled in closer. “I
Rubin looked between the brothers, annoyed. “Well, I was distracted,” he said suggestively. “It is a bathhouse.”
“Did he just say you guys 'killed a
Dean then realized he had spent the entire night just enjoying Cas' company and completely forgot the whole reason they went out in the first place was because he was planning to help Cas pick up a chick. He couldn't remember even seeing any women there besides the waitress at dinner. How had he gone several hours in a crowded bar and not notice anyone other than Cas?
“You need time to determine whether or not you want to be in an amorous relationship with me?” Cas asked, his tone even, but his expression confused and affronted. “Is it customary to wait until after you've had sex with someone to make that decision?”
They laid in silence for several minutes while they caught their breath and came down from their orgasms. Reluctantly, Cas eased his softening member out and rolled off his partner.
Yes, someone was definitely saying his name. And Cas'. Must be Sam.
And he did. He tried to start slow, but Cas was having none of that. He propelled himself back onto Dean's cock, demanding speed and roughness. Dean wouldn't oblige. He didn't want to hurt Cas by going too hard so he kept an unhurried pace, his thrusts gentle and Cas finally relaxed and gave in. Dean buried his face in the crook of Cas' neck, his fingers threading through his hair. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean's waist and his arms around his back, holding him tight. Dean kissed along Cas’ neck, soft touches of his lips to match his movement. Cas did the same, trailing his mouth from the hunter's neck over to his shoulder where the angel’s handprint had once been seared into the beautiful flesh. They stayed at that pace for some time; Dean rocked his hips in slow, shallow thrusts as Cas held them close, their sweat slick skin sliding together.
him with visuals of his brother engaged in soapy gay ex-angel sex.
The hunter gripped Cas' ass and slapped the cheeks a few times earning a low growl from the man writhing on top of him. Dean moved one hand between them to palm Cas' cock and the brunet pushed into the touch. With a moan, he lunged forward, sealing their lips together in a heated kiss. Dean deepened it and flipped Cas on his back so he could grind their hips together.
Dean snorted and pulled him closer. "Fair enough. Just don't drool on me."
“They still going at it?” Charlie asked when Sam sat down next to her.
it. Did you not consider that I'm capable of making my own decisions and that you should respect them?”
“Look at 'em runnin' away,” the taller one commented mockingly.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, sort of. I mean, he didn't actually admit to loving me or anything, but it was implicit.”
"Wait...what do you mean we've seen each other naked on
But there were some incidents that were more difficult to explain: Dean pressing himself against Cas' back to "help him aim better" during target practice, despite the fact that Cas had already gone through three clips and had hit the target each time. He recalled Dean making a number of suggestive comments and double entendres that Cas actually understood -- which were always accompanied by a smirk or wink. Until now, though, Cas hadn't found those instances particularly strange since Dean had acted similarly several times in the past.
occasions'?” Dean said loud enough to be heard over the shower. Cas didn't answer, but Dean thought he heard a chuckle coming from the other side of the door. “Cas?”
“You can go,” Cas said, closing his eyes. “I'm just going to lay here.”
To say that Castiel (former) Angel of the Lord was unhappy with having mortality abruptly and rudely forced upon him would be an understatement. Despite having watched the earth since the beginning of Creation, Castiel was not prepared for the abhorrent tasks of day-to-day mortal life. Why his Father made human bodies so high maintenance and so... disgusting, he claimed he would never understand.
“Wh-” Dean's dry throat closed up, making him cough violently, and he had to sit on the edge of the bed to keep from falling over. When the bed dipped, something solid fell off, hitting the floor by his feet and he immediately began hearing a faint buzzing sound, which he ignored for the moment. There was shuffling around him and a water bottle was placed in his hand. He twisted off the cap and gulped down as much of the cold liquid as he could before having to breathe.
“Passion potions?” Cas asks skeptically.
“You were right behind me when I said it!” Dean yelled. “You didn't need super-angel hearing.” Oh, yeah. Cas was definitely pissed at him. “It's just bad etiquette, man.”
“Sick, dude, that's my brother,” Dean said disgusted, jabbing his thumb at Sam.
“But I don’t-” Dean thought about how to word it so it wouldn’t offend Cas. “I’m not ready to…do
Dean chuckled quietly, trying not to alert them to his presence, which would undoubtedly bring down the mood and send Cas back into hiding. Since they had returned to the bunker, both had sequestered themselves in their rooms and Dean had barely seen the former angel.
had been about.
“You said there were three,” Dean says. “I only saw two.”
” Dean moaned and put his hands on the other man's hips to hold him still. He continued working his way down until he got to the Enochian sigils. He traced his tongue over the marked skin and laughed when Cas shuddered and tried to move his hips.
"Dude, I'm just messin' around," Dean said, failing to hide another smirk. "You don't have to rush outta here. It's my birthday."
“Delete that video from the internet yet?” he countered.
Castiel,
“Okay,” Sam said, deciding against leaving his number in case he remembered anything else. He didn't want the guy trying to phone stalk Cas...or him. “Thanks for your time.”
Dean worked his mouth further down Cas' length, swiping his tongue around to add to the sensation. He kept strong fingers wrapped around the base and simultaneously pumped as he moved his head up and down. Cas threaded his fingers through Dean's hair, roughly tugging at the short strands and sending bolts of pleasure straight to the hunter's aching cock; still trapped inside his pants. It took all of Dean's willpower not to free his dick and jerk off while his mouth brought the other man to release. This moment was about making Cas feel good, he could wait. He sped up his pace, alternating from sucking and licking around the head and using his hand to stroke and massage Cas' tightening balls.
Cas arched his brow. “You want me to perform fellatio on you in the car?”
Cas sighed and went on, “Yes, you can be stubborn and infuriating at times, and you have a terrible temper, but that's not what I see when I look at you, Dean. I see a kind and caring man, who would and
Dean shook his head. "Only girls go to the bathroom in groups, dude."
Cas nodded in agreement (the bunker did have excellent mattresses) and laid down next to his friend. The mattress was indeed shitty, but it was warm and smelled a little like Dean so he wasn't going to complain.
Sam shook his head. “No, they don't remember anything, not even coming here last night. What I want to know is if what you're saying is true, why'd you run from us, and why the hell did you taze me?”
across the table as he spoke, much to Sam's disgust.
As for Cas, the ex-angel hadn't spoken much since they left the hotel and Dean made no attempt to start a conversation. What do you even say to your (maybe former) virgin best friend after you've woken up naked in bed together? He wanted to ask Cas if he was sore anywhere (like his ass) but since neither could remember anyway, maybe it was best not to know.
The girl behind the counter greeted them pleasantly and smiled up at Sam.
he had and seemed satisfied that it was just enough to not be uncomfortable.
Dean's heart rate speed up at the realization of what was about to happen. "I'm
“Hell yes,” Dean answered hopefully. He'd never received a blowjob while driving and it sounded hot as shit.
, and the shock wore off quickly. In seconds he was fully hard and pulling Dean with him when he rolled onto his back. Dean eagerly allowed himself to be moved into his new position atop his friend and settled between his legs.
Cas manages to give a few more lazy thrusts into Dean’s oversensitive hole before collapsing on top of the hunter. Dean holds him for a moment, but the full weight of the angel pressing down on him makes it difficult to breathe, so he plants a reassuring kiss to Cas’ temple and rolls them over. He winces when the softening cock in his ass slips free and he feels come and whatever angelic lube his friend had conjured up leaking out. Cas doesn’t seem to mind the mess they’ve made and is content to lay sprawled out with half-lidded eyes and a pleased smile plastered on his handsome face. Dean makes a note to teach the damn angel some bedroom etiquette, but for now he’ll let the guy bask in postcoital bliss.
“I figured,” Dean said with a smirk. He reached over to the nightstand and grabbed one of the washcloths they started keeping on hand. He cleaned the mess from their stomachs then reached around to wipe up the come that was leaking out of his hole. Throwing the cloth aside, he relaxed back on the bed and pulled Cas close. “Can I ask you something?”
“Look who's here,” Sam called out loudly as he descended the staircase to the main level, the redhead in tow.
When Dean moved lower and bit at the nub of one of Cas' nipples, the brunt arched his back and groaned. Dean repeated the action on his other nipple and Cas thrust his hips up so their clothed erections rubbed together.
“Then I would have to bring the dirty ones out again after I was clean. That seems counterproductive.”
amount on his fingers. "Don't forget that
“I already told you,” Dean snapped, “We were high as fuck and can't even remember. It doesn't count.”
Dean clenched his jaw and glared at his brother. “We'll talk about that in a little bit,” he said to Charlie and led them towards the lounge.
the dinner table came to mind and Dean gave a wolfish grin. “Sure thing, Sammy,” he said and went back to devouring his meal.
While food is definitely his favorite perk so far, he's also discovered a love for little things like: overly sweetened coffee in the morning (also necessary, despite Dean's disgust at the amount of sugar he uses), taking very long, very hot showers (another thing Dean takes issue with), and the way fabrics smell freshly laundered.
Dean forced himself not to pout when Cas moved away. “What for?”
Cas went still and quiet for a few moments before he finally answered with a whispered, “Yes.”
. "Are you taking pictures of us?" he asked through the thin blanket covering his head.
The third finger slides in easily with the help of the grace prep, but the angle is awkward, preventing Cas from penetrating past his second knuckles. He pulls his fingers free with a frustrated grunt, leaving Dean feeling unexpectedly empty. Dean detaches from the angel, planning to drag him to bed, when he’s suddenly being pushed back to the wall and Cas is grabbing him around his thighs and lifting Dean up like a rag doll. Dean yelps and throws his arms around Cas’ shoulders, wrapping his legs tightly around his waist.
“You seem to really want me and Cas to happen,” Dean observed.
Kevin comes by a few minutes later and hands him a plate full of food. Dean's surprised and impressed to see that Kevin made him a real breakfast: scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and a banana – he didn't even know the kid could cook. He's even more surprised that the smell of it all doesn't make him want to puke. Kevin offers him a mug but to Dean's disappointment, it's filled with orange juice instead of coffee.
Dean swallowed and tried to calm himself. “It kinda stings.”
“No,” Dean answered. “I was hoping you'd stay.”
“I know I’m practically useless without my grace,” Cas continues. “I’m trying to be a good hunter and do what I can to help, but please tell me if I have overstayed my welcome.”
Wanting a better angle, Dean held on to the other man and managed to slide down the bed until he was flat on his back. Cas sat up and using Dean as leverage, he rocked his hips faster.
“I understand,” Cas responded. He didn't really, but wasn't going to argue with Dean about his stupid "rules". He still stood awkwardly by the door, trying desperately to regain control over his body, and wondered if he had actually managed to fall asleep back in the other room and was currently having another one of
"Like excessive drinking?" Sam asked incredulously.
“I'm sure you will manage to control yourself for the rest of the day,” Cas responded, his tone commanding. “Also, we are not doing that while driving again. You almost crashed the car, Dean. We could have been killed.”
“Yes, I'm sure. Do I have to dress-up this time? I only packed my FBI suit and a few casual clothes for the hunt.”
“Dean, he's right,” Sam said. “I'm not really sure I want to know what happened with you guys last night - I already saw too much honestly - but we do need to figure it out. If you really were roofied it was probably by the same person who stole the car. It's not like we can go to the police and report it.”
“Never touch me like that again,” Dean says and tries to keep his voice from breaking. “I –
Dean has a few moments to feel guilty for bringing it up when he realizes he’s been played. Cas has been human, or as human as a graceless angel can be, for six months and he’s never had any trouble holding it in. He waits another minute before getting up to follow his friend to see what's really going on. Glancing down the hallway that leads to the nearest toilet he sees that the bathroom door is open and the lights are off; Cas is nowhere in sight. He heads down the opposite corridor, which will take him past their bedrooms, in case Cas decided to make the long and inconvenient trek to the bathrooms on the other side of the bunker.
, come and get it.”
“Haven't seen you all day,” Sam commented, not taking his eyes off the laptop he had in front of him.
“Well, I did have an advantage,” Cas says. “I thought Sam would have told you.”
"Well, Sam, you are an exceptional teacher."
Dean was at his friend's side in an instant. He placed a hand on Cas' shoulder, almost possessively. “The fuck you think you're doing?” He glared at Rubin.
“Nowhere! Don't worry about it, Sammy.” Dean tried to shove the receipt in his pocket, but Cas managed to swipe it from him first. Dean blamed it on leftover angel reflexes.
Dean wants to protest but his eyelids are heavy, and his head is starting to throb. He settles in bed and watches as Cas moves around the room cleaning up used tissues and making sure there's plenty of water, Gatorade (
Where they wouldn’t have to sneak around and could be as loud as they wanted when they fu-
“I don't require you to reciprocate, Dean,” Cas assured. “I would like the try it, if you're willing.”
There that damn banging noise was again. Dean wanted to turn his body over, get away from the sound and blinding light, but he couldn't force himself to move. He managed to turn his head a little and let out a groan as his muscles protested even the smallest movements. His neck was stiff, there was something hard pushing uncomfortably into his crotch and his jaw was inexplicably sore. Did someone punch him? He couldn't remember getting into a fight with anyone. The more aware he became, the more he realized he couldn't recall anything of his night before. That was new. He had had quite a few hangovers in his lifetime, but he couldn't ever remember waking up feeling so disoriented. He groaned again. That was about all he could do at the moment.
“Look, we're sorry about the E,” the brunette said. “We thought you guys would be up for it and we didn't think it would mess with you that much. You seemed fine last night.”
'Fuck yes,' Dean said and moved a hand between them to pop open the button on Cas' jeans.
“What are you doing?”
“You're so fucking good with your mouth,” Dean commented and arched off the bed with a groan when the angel bit down and sucked on the flesh.
“Yeah, he works nights. Angel's his drag name or something.”
Sam turned his bitchface to the redhead and studied her for a moment. He noted that she hadn't even touched her bacon yet. She was clearly in on whatever was going on. “Let me guess, it's your foot again, right?” he asked facing his brother.
“Bathroom,” Dean answers casually. “Must have missed you.”
When it starts to become heated, Dean takes the opportunity to grind their hips together. Neither are hard yet, but the action elicits a low growl from the angel as he thrusts forward to match Dean’s movements. The sound turns Dean on in ways he doesn’t care to analyze and he’s on his knees in an instant, reaching for Cas’ belt. He’s already unfastened the buckle when he risks glancing up at his friend. Cas is staring down at him in what anyone else would think was only mild curiosity, but Dean sees fire in his cerulean eyes and the way his kiss swollen lips part slightly as Dean slides the zipper of his dress pants down. Dean’s arousal surges when Cas brings one hand up to rake blunt nails through the hunter’s spikes, while the other hooks around the waistband of his slacks and helps Dean pull them and his boxers down in one go.
Dean cursed under his breath.
“Actually, I need to talk to Cas,” Dean spoke up before the next game started.
“I really can't say,” Sam answered honestly. “But I'd like to think that I would've thought about the consequences before sleeping with my already borderline depressed friend. Have you even considered how you're hurting Cas right now?”
Cas smiled. “I would like that.”
“Why?” Cas asked, raising his voice. “It's not like you're ever honest about
“What, Sammy?” Dean asked, hoping it was loud enough to be heard through the door.
When they went inside, Sam and Dean made their way over to speak with the employee behind the register. Neither noticed when Cas wandered off to check out the merchandise.
"Should I be worried?"
Sam was startled awake by the sound of a car honking outside and instinctively grabbed the gun from under his pillow and sat up. It took him a moment to realize he wasn’t being attacked and he came down from
That got the attention of Sam and Kevin who glanced in the direction their friend was pointing. Sam tensed when he saw the group of rather large men watching them. He noted that they seemed to be mostly focusing their death glares at Dean and Castiel and he had a gut-wrenching feeling he knew why. Sam clenched his jaw and moved in front of his brother and friend, blocking the men from view. He quickly looked for an empty table at the other end of the building. "There's a free booth back there," he said and motioned for the others to go sit as he followed, holding himself up to his full imposing height.
can’t do this.”
“Dean, don't-”
Cas shook his head. "No. I thought perhaps they were hunters because they didn't seem to like Dean very much. Therefore, I naturally assumed they must have already been acquainted with him."
“Tell me if it hurts,” he said as the third digit joined the others and he began to scissor him open. He pulled his fingers almost out, leaving just the tips inside then thrust back in, down to the last knuckles, twisting as he went. Cas suddenly jerked forward and moaned loudly and Dean realized he must have found his prostate.
Dean had immediately turned off the video when the door opened and sat up so his shirt covered his growing bulge. Luckily, he knew he wouldn't have to be concerned about it too long. His overgrown baby brother was nothing if not an instant boner-killer.
“Grand Hyatt Hotel,” Sam answered. “Had to steal a car to get here. I tracked your GPS and got the room number from the front desk.” He held up his FBI badge to explain why they would give away guest information. “I checked the parking garage, by the way. Didn't see the Impala anywhere. You find the keys?”
Cas let out a surprised yelp and jumped away when Rubin's hand found its target and firmly squeezed one of his butt cheeks. “That's very inappropriate.”
Dean's eyes went wide. “No, we're not calling Charlie. I'm not letting anymore people in on this.”
"Cas' orders," Kevin explains. "I have to watch you drink it."
...or something."
"That's what I thought," Dean said smugly. "So these costumes you bought," he started while picking up the pile of their clothes. "If you get to be Santa does that mean I'm one of the elves?"
After a few minutes passed, Dean was getting seriously impatient and wondered how much force it would take to break the flimsy handcuffs. The bedroom door was still wide open so when he heard foot steps in the hallway he hoped it was Cas coming back and not Sam returning early from the bar. Seeing his older brother spread out butt naked, chained to a bed, and sporting a raging hard-on would probably send the younger Winchester straight back to the nut house.
