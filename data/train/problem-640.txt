"So you knew everything from the beginning?" asked Dimmock again to his wife.
John chuckled and shook his head.
"Do you want me to open it for you?"asked the man again, the friendly expression abandoned in favor of typically military professionalism.
Sherlock had expected that answer because the next moment he shook his head, leaning slightly forward, careful not to crush Hamish and placed an elbow on one knee.
-And when he does bring him to our home, I'm going to have to sneak out of the house at dawn because the aforementioned friend can't stay more than five seconds in the room with me without venting his anger, let alone finding out that I'm his best friend's partner-added Mycroft without acrimony.
-Do you want some tea? -he asked her, not knowing what to say to her.
I started to follow these meetings and I took back my life and although it was not easy, every time I was about to relapse, I wondered what the idiot with the Belstaff at the back of the room would say.
Three years late.
Jack's presence was a cure-all for John, helping him not to focus too much on the quiet, rigid figure who had taken over the living room three days earlier and continued to irritate him.
There were a myriad of things waiting for him outside of that plane, all his work of the previous three years would have been scrutinized, to check that everything had been done in the utmost legality, but that was the least of his problems.
The next moment John put himself together, recalling his half-made breakfast, the day ahead of him and he turned his head slightly towards the kitchen counter to check his now lukewarm teacup.
But Lestrade wouldn't believe me and arrested me for possession of narcotics-
Instantaneous tears began to press into the corners of John's sky blue eyes, leading him to lower his head as if he wanted to hide from the sight of the two homeless, his lips undone by a sigh of relief that he had not noticed having held back until that  moment, taking time to absorb Baby Girl words.
Greg frowned.
John was an adrenaline junkie... He could have staged a fake kidnapping, perhaps leaving some clues simple enough even for Lestrade to find, that would lead them to his bunker... But if John would have found out it was all a set-up, he would have been even more enraged, making their current situation worse.
Why did he allow jealousy and other stupid problems to stand between them?
-I don't really know what you mean, my dear- he retorted.
Sherlock, for the first time since they had sat at the table, rolled his eyes and shook his head.
Sherlock snorted unconvinced, but when he felt John's fingers through his black curls he made no gesture to avoid that contact.

-Oh, this evening is proving to be more interesting than expected! I always had a curiosity about our dear doctor...- intervened Sally.
Are you here for unsolved cases or are you ready to go back into action with a new case? -Greg asked him resting his elbows on the desk top.
The first meeting between Sherlock and the Doctor was not a success, and John had not expected anything different given the inquisitive and analytical mind of his roommate.
But John Watson had never been a cruel man.
I thought you two were finally a couple-said Harry.
John stared at him in silence, stopping in the middle of the bridge, resting his back against the balustrade, his hands sunk into the pockets of his jacket to shelter from the cold wind.
- If you want to enjoy the unconditional attention of the journalists, you're free to do it, but I'm out!
Come on! It shouldn't have been that hard!
A wry smile appeared on the lips of older Holmes, leading him to cast a new glance at the little one perched on his shoulder.
"I gave him twenty-four hours, how much longer does he need?" asked Sherlock, too forcefully waving the bottle so as not to let go of one of his angry outbursts.
-I have my bike.
Otherwise those three years had been in vain....
The woman shook her head, and the next moment she held out a note that she had pulled out of her blouse pocket.
Before he could move down to his abdomen, Sherlock gripped his blond hair and forced John to look at his face, making him gasp for a moment at the sight of a lustful Sherlock.
Aldershot.
"He’s scared" Sherlock finally said, breaking the silence.
-I was thinking of a holiday- John said, to drive away those unusual thoughts.
I think a lot of them have also grown fond of me" he added.
That's why I started taking those pills: one was enough, and everything made sense, you were with me again and I stopped being the pathetic person I had become.
Sherlock, in response, merely shrugged his shoulders and moved towards the sofa, letting himself fall gracefully on it.
The only love of my life... If you knew how much I love you- Sherlock murmured still confused by his orgasm.
Emma's voice again intruded into his thoughts, bringing his attention back to the little girl.
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile, that special smile he reserved only for the man in front of him, watching him take a sip from his cup and grimace at the lukewarm tea.
-Do you wanna dance? -John asked him, his lips close to his right ear to outdo the chaos of the music and the crowd.
"His office is on the other side of the building. He's a Sergeant, but he's not let on many cases. I can show you, if you like." The young man gestured down the hallway.
"No, I'm not," Sherlock pouted.
"Good. Glad that's over," John muttered. "Second swig." This draught was bigger, Sherlock attempting to adjust himself faster to the feeling of the stuff. A light buzz had started to come over him. Sherlock knew that wasn't normal, but he wanted to keep going until he got it out of John. It bothered him too much to wait.
"Yes, that works," he whispered to Sherlock, feeling the adrenaline begin to rush through his body. They walked backward a few steps. "So what do we do now?"
"How did you know?" John turned to Sherlock.
"How, in any way, is this
Gentle kisses floated up Sherlock's throat and jaw, making their way to Sherlock's lips. Only a few kisses involved the tongue, but everything in between was very, very good, too. Sherlock asked himself where John had learned all this, and then turned away from that topic, because it had to do with the thousands of women John had dated before him. Deleted. He wondered if those same women would, as they say, 'eat their hearts out' if they saw the man kissing Sherlock now. "Any particular reason...ah...for this sort of treatment?" he asked.
Sherlock exaggeratedly ate his entrée, making sure John noticed the effort he was making. In fact, it wasn't that difficult for Sherlock, but he didn't like worrying John, and by the approving looks John was giving him, he had the upper hand. Never had Sherlock Holmes had the urge to eat, but now he did, and there weren't any cases to concentrate on, so he could indulge just this once. Dating was a give and take, wasn't it?
Sherlock took a deep breath. "I found out you still lived in 221B, and I had to see you, so I moved into 221C, so that maybe I could pass by you once in a while, know you were alright. But it wasn't enough. I needed to be over you, I needed to move on, otherwise, I wasn't sure if I was going to survive at all." He laughed, this time with a bit of humor. "I cooked up this experiment to spend time with you, as your boyfriend, just to see if that little taste could get me through a lifetime of being without my John. I told you that it was just pretending. I hope you know that it was never pretending for me. That was my reality.
Clara smiled. "How are we going to start, Mrs. Watson?"
"It's about a Mrs. Martha Hudson. You were listed as one of her emergency contacts."
"You are NOT going to leave me after that," he murmured, yanking his shoes off and wading into the river. The current was sluggish, mostly because it was nighttime, but also because of how
"I don't believe you, but I'll take your advice." Sherlock sounded only slightly more hopeful than when the call began. "Thank you."
"You are exactly correct, John. She was prying," Sherlock said, face shifting slightly. He looked much happier now that John was back, but that couldn't have been the reason. John was imagining things. "I haven't had pancakes in a long time. Do you have any chocolate chips?" he continued eagerly.
"How long do you have for what?" Mycroft replied.
Sherlock looked at John with apprehension. "I didn't see anything real. It would never happen, I can see that now."
"Chicken alfredo sound good?" Harry nodded eagerly, while the detective just waved his hand in an 'I guess it sounds fine' kind of gesture. John knew that was as good as it was going to get, so he started the boiling water.
"Yesterday," he lied, knowing John would be suspicious if he said morning.
I'm sorry.
Sherlock stirred a few minutes later, wriggling a little before sighing and slowly peeling open one eye, then the other.
The man thought for a moment. "The real DI now is Sally. If you have a real problem, you should go talk to her instead."
"Just so you know, the gun was his idea," John placated to the several people Sherlock was fooling.
"Yes, darling." John rearranged himself to hold Sherlock to him. He needed a hug right about then. "Instead of my earlier plan, I'm going to tell you who and what all the constellations are."
John sighed. "Yeah." Sherlock tried to muffle the ticking he heard in his head. Why did John have to play all the parts? Why did they have to recreate the memories? Why did it go on?
"John?" This time it was Sherlock asking.
and now people laugh at him." She paused. "He's a good guy, hotter than the sun. Would've fucked him if I wasn't into you." Clara noticed Harry said 'into you' rather than 'into girls'. Stupid two am brain. "Holmes is good for Johnny, good to him. Johnny deserved someone like Sherlock long before he got him."
"What if I'll get it out of you anyway?"
His mouth fell open. "What makes you think I'm willing? We just met, and I'm not gay, plus it's bloody five am and I can't think straight!"
John was actually not showering at all. He had the water running, but hadn't stepped in, watching the steam fog up the mirror. Sherlock Holmes, the man he'd fallen in love with (twice), had attempted suicide (again) to help John (again), and didn't think he deserved to stay with John, even though they both had insisted how much they loved the other a hell of a lot of times. He was angry at Sherlock, and sad, and really wanted to kiss his fiancé, hard. A shower would actually help.
John sat back. If Sherlock used a swear word, things were serious. "I won't care. We've done enough dangerous, stupid things that nothing you do can scare me away. Even breaking into Baskerville again."
"Sherlock? Where are you? I can't see you."
"For what?" he laughed, almost hysterically.
"Better," Sherlock replied, opening his eyes. He stood up; there was an experiment that he needed to conduct. "I need to go to the police station."
"Don't overdose. That's dangerous."
"With me or in the guest room?"
Clara smiled back and smoothly went back to the break room. It was nice feeling like Kate cared more about her than the work. Refreshing. The door to the room was still ajar, Clara not having closed it when she left the first time. Harry hadn't moved a muscle, it felt like, not a joint shifted nor a hair out of place. She carefully tiptoed forward, making sure her shoes didn't squeak on the floor. When Clara finally reached Harry's side, she knelt next to the sleeping woman. Harry looked more like a girl while asleep, though. Clara remembered that.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry," Moriarty placated, looking for all the world like a harmless, broke actor. "He paid me. He did all the work and he paid me."
"So, my brother will sometimes be thrown back in time-"
Tick tock. Tick tock. Time was running out.
Harriet Watson woke up with her wife beside her. Immediately, a great big warmth surged through her. It was as if giant fluffy clouds surrounded the two of them, each with candied apples all over. And Clara had an aura of soft white light around her, reaching out to touch Harry underneath the sheets.
person. But to have had none? It was so much better to have loved and lost than never loved at all, and Sherlock didn't. Before John could apologize for that, even though it wasn't at all his fault, Sherlock spoke again.
"Okay."
"But what about-" Mycroft hung up. Every second was important.
John pulled back a little and looked Sherlock in the eye. "It might as well be." He smiled. "Now, how about I start making a cake? I'll find my recipe."
"You're not going anywhere." Sherlock slid his tongue across John's bottom lip, much like John had done with his fingertip, and threaded his hands through John's hair. The doctor made a little noise that vibrated through Sherlock's whole being, causing him to gasp out, "I want you."
"Not literally, of course," Sherlock cut in.
The detective rolled his eyes. "I haven't been wrong..." He broke off. "...very often." He shook his head. "I've only been wrong a few times. Only a few that I can think of. Maybe a few more, but I probably deleted those. Or maybe I was high. Or..."
John's mouth fell open. "How is it possible that the great Sherlock Holmes has no knowledge of the cosmos?"
"Paramedics. Mrs. Hudson's been shot."
"Codependency is someone assisting the destructive behavior of their partner. You don't assist Harry's drinking, and you have an otherwise healthy relationship. My grandmother drank and my grandfather didn't assist her. He, in fact, helped her recovery." Molly gave her a stern look. "You and Harry can be the same way. Now calm down, and finish your shift."
"I promise I won't."
Harry made a beckoning gesture, turning to sit on her bed. Sherlock, wearing only a sheet, sat on the chair across from her bed. "Alright, what the hell happened last night? Please explain in
whatever it was, and he knew that wouldn't change.
"Sherlock Holmes, will you go out with me?"
"I smell you've brought Italian food from Angelo's. Did he have any comments to bestow?"
forgive him, but Sherlock would take anything he could get. Without John, he was nothing.
"You look sad. I don't imagine that's a common occurrence." Sherlock's lips twitched up. "Want to talk about it? I am your boyfriend after all."
Testing season happened. Sorry about the lateness, you guys.
Hours later, the boys woke up on the couch, flour-covered and smiling. Sherlock was curled around John, and John didn't mind it. If he fell in love with Sherlock, it would probably be the best thing to ever happen to him.
"Wait, Mycroft." Sherlock paused. "Thank you."
"You know something, don't you?"
She was just about to check on them when she heard a knock at the door. "Can we come in?" Clara huffed.
Sherlock nodded. "I've gotten quite fond of your pancakes. I believe I learned to say 'yes please'. You would be proud."
"I'm looking for a Detective Inspector Lestrade. Seen him around?"
Sherlock knew it wouldn't last. John didn't love him before, probably didn't now, he just was lonely. But Sherlock also knew that if John was taken from him again...He'd die, really and provably. He was convinced his heart would stop beating, be torn out like it was in the nightmare, if John left.
"No, Sherlock.
John didn't question this, but Sherlock found it a rather strange request. "Why does she need to go to the market?"
"Who was your first love?" Sherlock asked suddenly, voice sounding more lucid than it had since the game started.
The lies from the truth, the meaning behind the meaning, it was all. Just. A. Game. A game with real hearts, real minds at stake, like a poker pot that had humans trapped in it. Luck and strategy wins.
Clara saw Harry laying there, looking so beautiful and small and harmless, and decided she'd give the Watson a second chance. They both were miserable, and that wouldn't get better without the other to help them.
Clara didn't need to think about the answer. "Yes, but I wish I wasn't."
Clara smiled again. "Thank you. That would be lovely. It can be only one date if you want."
"Who knew you could throw down drinks like that?" a rough, masculine voice that Mycroft wished many times he'd forgotten remarked.
"What do ya wonder?"
"Clara..." She paused. "Watson."
For some reason, John could feel Sherlock rolling his eyes through the words. Sometimes he could feel it, more so when he was there and just had his back turned to the detective. Sherlock was like an open book to him most of the time, but of course, he never said anything about it. If Sherlock had gotten that good at hiding his feelings, there must have been a reason.
"Our couch." John looked at him like he was crazy. "We do have an experiment going on, and I will get results with or without your sister singing obscene children's rhymes. I'm staying with you."
When had John shared this flat? And with a person he'd thought such things about?
God, what kind of drugs had she been put on?
surprise
Sherlock thought for a moment. "Angelo's. It's a nice Italian establishment not too far away, plus, I helped the owner out of a rough spot, so we might get the meal close to free."
The detective shook his head. "It's not you. I'll inevitably fuck this up, and I don't want you to be caught in that."
John's breathing elevated, so Sherlock was putting everyone in jeopardy. But the snipers weren't moving.
"Why do people always feel the need to apologize for things that aren't under their control?" Sherlock asked softly.
"Around a year. Why?"
Harry looked down. Clara thought she could see a small teardrop fall from her eyes. "When I started drinking, I didn't think it would ever get that bad. But it was a fucking downward spiral and I couldn't control it. Everything got worse and worse, and you were so unhappy, and I couldn't look myself in the mirror knowing I'd done that to you. Clara, I left because I loved you, and I didn't want to hurt you anymore." Her tone got more and more hysterical and sad and teary as she spoke.
And suddenly, lips were on his.
"Really? How can you tell?" John replied sarcastically.
"Do you want to tell him?" John asked Sherlock, beaming just as wide as him. "He's your brother, after all."
John hadn't really been in love since his girlfriend Grace. She was beautiful and perfect in every way, and John had been utterly smitten. Of course, that was before she cheated on him, and asked for expensive things, and took his virginity. He didn't stay with girlfriends much after that.
"Yes, thank you." She smiled at Clara. "One of my...one of the people..." She looked confused. "I'm not really sure what to call him, but he needs some hydrogen peroxide for an experiment, and he refuses to go out and get it for himself." The woman sighed. "It's complicated. Anyway, the stuff seems to have disappeared."
"Oh, hello, John! How's our detective?" Angelo asked loudly. John sometimes wondered if that man had a whisper voice.
"Jooohhhnnnn," Sherlock whined.
Once John came back out of the shared bedroom he found Sherlock standing facing the windows, violin in hand, bow in the other. As soon as Sherlock heard the other man's footsteps, he began to play. John immediately stopped in his tracks.
with the ones as powerful as Moriarty. You either fought them, or made a deal with them. Had his brother learned nothing?
Clara smiled, but it wasn't a happy smile. "I'm done with feeling stabbed every time I wake up without her next to me. I'm done with missing her. We need to find new people, it's best for both of us." She began to walk away.
"Sherlock, are you okay?" John's feet dug into the strange sand of the banks, walking down and away from him.
once? Him? He never remembered seeing any sign John felt the same way back then. Did Harriet have the wrong idea? Did she simply want to push them together?
The pathologist smiled. "You're welcome, Clara." Molly picked up her groceries, including the hydrogen peroxide, and went to check out. Clara headed into the break room to apologize to Kate. She wasn't doing her job, and although she was infinitely better now, that didn't enable her to break contracts.
"Go ahead."
John's answer surprised neither him nor the man that had invaded his flat so early in the morning. "Oh God yes."
And then, miracle of miracles, Clara met Harry Watson.
Wait, what?
"Of course. I do things if people ask me nicely." A small grin spread over John's face. "I should probably know your name if we're going to be fake boyfriends."
John just smiled. "What a happy coincidence. I'll be in the bathroom brushing my teeth." He left the room.
"For God's sake, this man was on trial!" John gestured wildly to 'Moriarty', who hadn't moved a muscle since the exchange began.
Sherlock deduced Lestrade for a moment, trying to make sure he was telling the truth. "Lestrade, are you certain? This changes everything."
John nodded. It was probable that he would start with the sitting room as Stapleton's lab and Sherlock would have to make the hound noises again. God, this scared Sherlock, seeing John so scared. But it would be over and done with soon enough, and Boyfriend-John would come back.
John smiled bitterly. "Her name was Grace. Beautiful, kind, perfect. I would have given her anything if she asked for it. Of course, she asked for everything. Grace slowly cut her way into my heart and then left it in small red slices when she said, 'You're a pushover and too easy'. So there was the crushed part of crushes. I couldn't stay with anyone for very long after that."
"Sherlock, honey, you can ask us anything," Clara cut in, taking the mobile from her wife. Something was clearly wrong, even an idiot could see it.
"What is it?" Sherlock asked from a meter away. He looked like he hadn't moved from the spot in hours.
"But that's worse."
There was no doubt about it. The second Harry saw her, she melted. Clara had wavy blonde hair that always got in her eyes, which were a lovely chocolate brown. Harry blearily thought a goddess like Clara didn't belong in such a normal, ordinary grocery store. Of course, Harry didn't know Clara's name then, having just run into her.
"Morning, darling," he whispered as Sherlock began to stir.
The detective guy blushed really deep. "I woke up afterwards with every intention to leave, as I broke the promise I made to him the day we found you."
"What kind of story?"
"That can't be right, Sherlock. Plenty of people remember the last two years."
After Sherlock had cooled down a little and John had almost succeeded in schooling his expression into something vaguely appropriate, the food arrived. "Here you are, men," Angelo said. "Enjoy." He winked at John before heading back into the kitchen. Sherlock cocked an eyebrow at him, but John wouldn't explain that.
Sherlock pressed his hands together in a weird praying position under his chin. "After you came home and went to bed, John and I talked for a little while. Talking led to-"
"Harry, you'll never believe what just happened!" Her brother sounded so happy, Harry could barely believe it. "I found a man who will share a flat with me. He's amazing, he deduces people, he deduced me within the first few minutes of me meeting him."
Harry could feel Sherlock rolling his eyes through the phone. "I had to recreate John's memories, remember? That included the unfortunate circumstances of my suicide." He paused. "I have...a question. If you think you can answer it, that is." The sound of fidgeting came through. "I mean, you don't have any obligation to answer me, it's not
Clara blinked at her. "Harry still loves me?"
Sherlock watched her go with the smile slightly fading. She didn't know that their relationship wasn't real, but she was perceptive, so shouldn't she have picked up on it? Sherlock's brow furrowed a little. And, he still was working on why Moriarty hadn't hit Harriet with the Memory Toxin, as he called it. Harriet knew about him and his impact on John's life, so why hadn't she been targeted?
"Who's Gregory?"
Mrs. Hudson frowned. "Sherlock, you're going to run that lovely boy of yours out of the house with your antics." She shook her head disapprovingly. "I need to see the damage to know what I should bring." Sherlock was blushing before she had even finished speaking.
John shook his head in disbelief. "You can't possibly think that."
The melody was
"Holy mother of Jesus! Sherlock Holmes, you tried to fucking
"What?"
"There is nothing wrong with you," John said. "He's gone, you loved him, it's normal to think about him. The nightmares come from your fears and previous traumatic experiences mixing together in a big pile of brain goo. This experience, you leaving him, was traumatic and led to other traumatic incidents, so when your brain gets a subconscious reminder of those things, it reorganizes it into something that the brain can then reanalyze." John broke off, blushing slightly. "Nothing strange at all."
"Sherlock, can't you read it on my face? When was the last time you deduced someone?" He couldn't say it, not here, not
When the door was opened, it wasn't by Irene, or even the potential threesome partner. It was Clara.
John couldn't take it anymore. He leaned forward and placed the tiniest kiss on Sherlock's full bottom lip, then on his top lip, and then kissed him fully, but not long. "Do you want me to? Because I do."
"Being a former cocaine addict, I will do my best," Sherlock replied, a rare smile crossing his face. "Now, you should have some cake. It's your brother's recipe."
"Doesn't matter. I'll be at the crime scene, and as you're a doctor, I want you there with me." Sherlock paused on his way out of the door. "You've seen a lot of bodies, haven't you? Grave injuries, deaths. Do you want to see some more?"
She'd slept around in the upper grades and college; waking up in someone else's bed was nothing she couldn't handle. If people thought she was a cuddler after
John laughed. "Alright. So my little sister and her wife are back together then?"
"Of course he can. He must have a plan, sowing doubts into people's heads the last twenty-four hours, wrapping lies in truth to make it more palatable, and, and..." Sherlock broke off.
John closed the window, and Sherlock turned on the brightest light in the house, momentarily blinding the doctor. John then tried sliding the invisible key card back along the window frame, but Sherlock left the light on. He had to get this right. If he didn't, there was a great potential for John's brain compensating for the skewed memory and bring them all back at once, hurting John and destroying Sherlock. That could not happen, John could not be hurt anymore than Sherlock already had hurt him.
"What?" Clara looked surprised.
And the blush was back, in full force. "We...er...engaged each other sexually...and I woke up on the couch. Um..."
"That happens a lot."
"You as well? I'm sorry."
Molly gently smacked her upside the head. "Harriet wants to see you. If she wanted to divorce you, why would she come back here, the last place she knew you worked, every single day, looking for you? She would have given up and just called you if she wanted something stupid."
In Harry's really fuzzy mind, since she wasn't exactly awake, she could vaguely hear someone come into the room. Wherever she was. The person was quiet, like keeping her asleep was important. Obviously, Johnny's crazy boyfriend didn't share that opinion!
Harry shook her head. "Doesn't matter. What matters is that man really does love you, whether your thick head chooses to accept that or not. And if you've done anything to hurt him, you're hurting yourself more." She stalked out of the flat, slammed the door, and went back upstairs.
"I adore you too."
John had lost the memories of the past two years, and he was Sherlock's boyfriend, and Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Donovan, and Anderson had a similar pattern. Harriet hadn't directly known him, and her memories were perfectly intact. So this had to do with
"That's why..."
Harry stood by the entrance to Tesco. Clara's shift was supposed to have ended, but she needed to stay there. The wall she leaned against kept her from falling over. She was tired, beyond tired. Sherlock's little excursion had destroyed a few hours of already sparse sleep, and she destroyed a few more by coming to Tesco, so she was basically done. If she fell asleep there, hopefully someone would pull her over to a couch.
"I'll find you," Sherlock whispered, saltwater making his voice hoarse. He had to stay calm, he had to stay in character. "Just keep talking."
Sherlock gave him a small but genuine smile. "Thank you." The Yarders nearby gaped at their exchange, but John ignored them.
Many people had been in the flat, his tired mind thought. Many different women, one with a snarky tone, a man that had been infernally nasty to both John and...someone else. A kind man, one that had only come in for business and once for a...drugs bust? No, that couldn't have been it. Another man with a posh voice, who'd had intelligent yet very childish arguments with...that someone. It wasn't John, he knew that much. But the drugs bust, where had that come from?
"Sir, you have another appointment."
Mycroft folded his hands over his umbrella handle. "A few hours. Go to a jewelry store and buy John a ring of his own, eat dinner together at Angelo's, solve another case, laugh with him, and say your goodbyes. Instead of jumping off the roof again, you should jump off of London Bridge into the Thames. At least then, you have a better chance of living through the experience." He turned to open the door and walk out. Mycroft was not only craving alcohol, he craved cake.
"Molly Hooper fancied me once, but I messed that up too badly for it to be fixed now," Sherlock answered, and there was something sad in his eyes. "I'm not good with emotions, so I probably couldn't have fixed it even if I wanted to. Lots of people have said I was good-looking, or handsome, but then I deduced them and they scarcely looked back. I don't even know what they wanted from me."
A giant sigh from the doctor and an eye roll. "No matter what the population of London thinks to the contrary, I am not gay!"
Harry let out a short burst of laughter. "Liar, liar, pants on fire. Johnny and Locky kissing in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G! First comes love, then comes death!"
"I can't, it'll hear me."
to John and crushed him, and whether he loved me or not, I can't let that happen one more time."
John laughed. "That isn't an obscene rhyme."
"The ring? That would be correct. I needed to do this the right way." John kneeled in front of the chair his boyfriend was sitting in, putting on hand on his knee, and holding the hand the ring was in out to him. "Now will you marry me? Because I love you, and I sometimes feel like I've known you forever, and we are the best as a team, and mostly I love you." John fiddled with the wedding band, waiting for an answer. "Please."
"Buu I don' wanna," Clara mumbled.
"Sherlock, alright stop it now. Just stop."
"It doesn't matter if it was real, you still saw it," he replied.
"I don't know. He's the brilliant Sherlock Holmes, and the only reason he's with me is to rebound from a bad relationship. He loved his best friend, and now his best friend is gone, so he saw me and noticed similarities, and now we're dating, sort of, to see if he can get over him. There's no reason why this should get any farther, so I'm going to leave it. If he's better, that's all I care about."
"I know, we went to your flat after you got kidnapped, remember?"
Inside, John saw Sherlock's tall figure stooped over the stove. It smelled like sweetness in the kitchen. "What're you making that you need milk?" John asked, standing behind him and trying (read: failing) to look over his shoulder to see what was in the pan.
"Moriarty's been playing with you, can't you see what's going on?" His voice had a note of pleading to it.
"I..." Clara ran a finger over Harry's cheekbone, "...want..." and tapped her nose, "...to..." and traced that finger over Harry's bottom lip. "...kiss you."
They really knew how to hurt him, using John against him, using his best friend (lover)(boyfriend) to break him. Well, it worked!
"Well, right now, you should be focusing your attention on the food your lovely boyfriend just made you." He pecked Sherlock on the cheek.
Sherlock didn't answer, but John didn't expect him to. With a heave of impressive strength considering how little John could move his arms, he pulled Sherlock onto the dry sand. The genius was still beautiful, even with his blue lips and too pale skin.
"Where are you?" Sherlock asked, even though he knew the answer far too well.
Her shift, well, her extra shift, would be over in a few minutes, and then she could meet Irene and see what she wanted to talk about.
John was stuck in the past again.
Sherlock was about to protest, but John cut him off with a finger. "What did you see?"
John laughed lightly. "I'll determine for myself what the right thing to do is, and currently it is this." He paused before moving forward completely, and kissed Sherlock.
Clara stood up. "I have to find her. I need to set this straight."
"That's all Moriarty needs. The screaming and then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. He wants to destroy me," Sherlock breathed. "Inch by inch. It is a
"Are you still in love with her?"
, he thought happily. "I'll get out the fixings."
John smiled. "Glad we're in agreement then." He made a move to slip off Sherlock, but the detective pulled him back down.
The contest would have gone on for much longer had Harry not chosen that moment to pop her head up. "You two are practically eye-stripping each other, and it's creepy to see my little bro do that."
It took both of them to drag the loopy sister up the stairs and into 221B. She was not making it easy at all. "I'm contemplating sleeping pills to get her to be quiet and lay still," John half-joked.
seems to remember, I was here the whole time. That cannot be a coincidence. The universe is rarely so lazy."
One last thought.
Harry wondered if her brother was more broken than herself.
, living in 221B until eternity catches up with you. But I know and I've accepted that will not happen. And believe me, I wish the memories won't come back as well."
"I don't know," John answered, moving next to Sherlock and placing his head on his shoulder. "I really don't know."
"I know you. I see what's real. You can't fake being such an annoying, lovable dick all the time." John smiled. Why was he smiling? Sherlock was about to take himself away again, how could John just smile like that?
John jerked his head up, looking around for a moment before calming, finding Sherlock's face. "Sorry. I spaced out for a minute there. Where are we going now?"
"With the drunk lesbian woman out there. Of course, with you!" Sherlock sat on the bed and didn't look like he was going to move anytime soon, so John smiled and rummaged through his dresser, trying to find something of his that could fit the much taller man. When he had got to the bottom of his very top drawer, he saw some items that didn't look like his.
Who was this person? Beautiful, he knew that much. But nothing else identified him.
"But if there wasn't?" Sherlock smirked darkly. "I refused to live without you a long time ago, and if you didn't save me, I figured I didn't need to be saved."
"Sherlock Holmes, I am your boyfriend. I care about you and everything surrounding you."
Mycroft could hear the smile over the phone. "You wouldn't be doing anything. You'd be dead."
So, Irene was going to refuse to let Clara and Harry out of the flat until they had either resolved their differences and moved on, or (and Irene really desired this outcome) had gorgeous makeup sex, including Irene in the party. She wasn't picky about the differences part, but she quite wanted both of her girls on the bed, naked and glistening and treating her and themselves.
Sherlock watched his friend carefully, reading on his face the anger, pain, and shame that experience, and those words brought with him.
-You can do it, but I'm not ready to talk about it now that I've decided to turn the page... Maybe in a few months-
"This must be Greg" John said as he walked to the door. "Kids, Uncle Greg is here!" he announced raising a little bit his voice.
John took a deep breath and took his military pose, straightening his back and neck muscles.
-Absolutely.
-I'm a simple man. All you see in front of you is all I am-answered enigmatically.
-If I were you I wouldn't throw away the idea of the luxury hotel too quickly; I agree it's too much for a first date, but if things go well, you can always use it for an anniversary, to spend some time together and have sex without having to worry about not making noise-comment Greg, noting right away the thoughtful expression of the detective’s face, a sign that he was putting that information into his Mind Palace.
-I want to spend my Saturday nights watching "Doctor Something" ... -
-Are they men or monkeys? - asked Sherlock again, trying to help her.
"He’s not there, dear" Mrs. Hudson informed him, reading his thought.
"In this way, reading both I will know everything about you?" John commented with a playful smile that also infected Sherlock.
Disbelief took over again, coupled with a sense of bewilderment.
-You know that's not true. You're just jealous" she added.
-What about the old unsolved cases? I could take care of those, and I'm willing to bet there's plenty of them, if we look at the state of your office-he proposed.
He needed an enemy, someone to blame, otherwise that sudden reappearance wouldn't make sense and he would really start to fear for his mental health.
The detective stared at his children for a few moments, observing their simple interactions with the same serenity that flood him every time he was with them.
-If Scotland Yard thinks it is appropriate to use my services, they know where I am – Sherlock simply answered.
In the room the silence fell for a few moments, until John let slip an ironic chuckle.
-What's that? -
Completely naked, he went back to the bathroom and stood under the shower jet, vigorously rubbing his skin, trying to erase the smell of the road and the memory of his workday.
-Then I should have died.
That was the perfect time to address the  "Daniel" topic.
Was it related to the abrupt way he had closed the previous conversation?
Fortunately, the waiter avoided turning it on, perhaps knowing that it would seem inappropriate and embarrassing.
When I started my career, I realized that Sherlock would attract my clients much more than my real name- Sherlock confessed.
John shrugged.
"Dead bodies of your exes?" he asked, trying to hold back a laugh.
"You need to give John some time" Greg said after a few moments.
Lady Holmes smiled proud.
"Did you?" John asked as well.
It was clear that he did not expect such a proposal from Emma, nor that the detective was so comfortable with the little girl, so Sherlock preferred to remain silent.
You're going to roll your eyes and you're going to call me an idiot, but I'm always going to come home-
Out in the street he looked around for a cab and stopped the first one he saw coming his way.
-Fuck... Okay, I need you to come to my house with your first aid kit" Greg told him after taking a deep breath.
If Sherlock had been struck by lightning at the same time, surely it would have surprised him less than those ten words.
Greg stood silent for a few moments; his gaze fixed on the wall behind John before nodding slowly.
John put his weight on one elbow and rose slightly to meet Sherlock’s gaze.
It was bad for obvious reasons, no one should ever learn so closely about human cruelty and greed, but... There were flashes of humanity...
Looking down, John quickly put on a condom and lubricated his erection and positioned himself in front of Sherlock's entrance, pressing gently until he slowly saw his cock sunk into Sherlock body.
A child needs both parents... But he doesn't need Irene, Hamish needs you.
-He tried to help me, to be close to me, he also tried to understand me, however difficult that task may be, but when I started doing cocaine, he realized there was nothing he could do.
"I try my best" the detective said with a hint of pride in his voice that made John smile. “I'm still convinced that my presence here is not necessary.
I need a shower and at least four hours of sleep.
-That too... But mostly because he's charming, fun, and an amazing shag.
"Mrs. Hudson?"asked Sherlock, trying not to let his worry shine through in his own voice.
He just had to convince John to come back...
It was then that his father's voice had reached him from the corridor leading to the kitchen, removing him from his thoughts and ripping it from the labyrinth that had become his mind.
Is it a crime to wish that a piece of the man you love will continue to live after death?  - he asked.
-Do you think your friend will be back soon? -
"Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
-What's stopping you?-
It was a stupid reaction, he was perfectly aware of it, but the image of John making out with a stranger had appeared in his mind, distracting him.
When the last patient's file was also perfectly filled out and delivered to Stephanie for the archive, John knew he had no other excuse to stay at the clinic: it was time to confront Sherlock.
-John, you're no fun! – Jack accused him.
"It’s not like that anymore?" John asked.
"Secrets I have held in my heart
They had been home for a few hours, staying quiet for the short haul that would take them back to Baker Street and, once safe in the quietness of their apartment, they had resumed their routine of experiments and teacups.
"It's not going to happen" the inspector said.
-John Watson... Always ready to defend the weakest- Sherlock said with a small smile.
But she made a mistake, if we want to call it a mistake... She kissed him- John explained and turned around to include Scotland Yard officers in his explanation.
-The point is, you're both bringing up pointless issues to avoid reality: there's no one more compatible than you two.
With an almost unnatural effort, Sherlock returned to his own half of the table and took once again the menu in his hands, his lips still bent in an affable smile.
But he didn't expect things to change so radically...
Still smiling, John looked up at Sherlock, meeting the same eyes that had just looked at him from a much younger face: while Hamish's gaze had been of sheer happiness, Sherlock's gaze was more watchful, clearly uncertain whether to show his feelings or not.
Quickly counting the plates, John gave a quick glance at Sherlock who seemed immersed in his world, staring at the wallpaper in front of him and the fingers of both hands joined under his chin and, mechanically approached the cabinet to take another plate.
Mycroft downplayed his thanks with a quick gesture of his hand, aware that everything he had done to help John Watson had been done in the best interests of his brother.
John said those words to him, looking Sherlock in the eye, even though he felt pathetic even just to admit what he considered a weakness.
John nodded, before sitting back in his own chair.
After the body had been taken to the Barts morgue, he and Sally had questioned the manager of the diner where the body had been found, about the evening routine before closing time, whether the dumpster had a key or was accessible to everyone and asking him to send the waiters of the evening shift to Scotland Yard to be questioned about anything strange that might have happened last night.
The doctor shook his head.
Almost heartened by his decision, John nodded, took a deep breath and walked toward the door of the restaurant.
The reality around me scared me and was hostile, so why not create a better reality, tailor-made for me?
This was able to see it for himself; he didn't need her help!
Their journey lasted about twenty minutes due to London traffic and on the way, Sherlock enjoyed watching the changes on John's face as they moved away from Westminster and the areas they usually frequented to get to Battersea.
-Why did you have to deal with Mrs. Hudson's health secretly? -
), with one backpack on her shoulders.
This scar is spectacular! It's a sign of your courage and strength, it's... it is a sign of destiny.
The detective merely frowned, watching the man stand up and fasten the buttons of his jacket.
-Hello! -
3) "I know it's over" by The Smiths
Harry gave him a beaming smile.
She  was the only one who understood, to  know for some strange reason that I needed to talk about you, but not about the wonderful, crazy man I had lived with  for eighteen months and continued to be a fixed presence in my mind, but that part of you that you had always kept me in the dark about and which had now become inaccessible-concluded.
You and I don't need any label to define our relationship: we're Sherlock and John. John and Sherlock.
-Hey, don't forget I'm a detective! Also, it's a little hard not to ask questions when you see Holmes Senior in the office every two weeks- answered the woman.
He quickly opened it by tearing the envelope and once he read the few words inside, he realized that everything was destroyed.
It was absurd to think as it used to be, before living together with Sherlock, the mere idea of a stranger in his room would make him attentive and responsive in a few seconds, the gun already clenched between his fingers.
"I'll wait for you at home then" he said as he walked around the desk to kiss gently his partner's lip, the first kiss after three days of voluntary isolation.
Relieved that he was able to complete the ultrasound without embarrassment and without a hitch, John began the process of printing some pictures of the little girl for Baby Girl while she cleaned the gel on her belly thanks to some wet wipes.
Greg took a sip from his bottle and straightened his back.
But he's also the most generous person that I know... although he would do anything not to let it show, and when he decides that a person is worthy of his affection and friendship then it is forever- John said gently stroking Hamish's back.
Leaving Sherlock meant finding a new apartment, giving up the eventful and without a moment of boredom life that he had always lived with the detective; it meant renounced his friendship with Greg because he was now in a relationship with Mycroft Holmes, and especially because Sherlock considered the inspector as a fundamental father figure in his life.
The expression of a man who had lost everything.
Sherlock looked in the direction he knew he would find Mycroft and met his gaze, finding him as always emotionless.
-Mh. You right, I don't think you'd be able to entertain them for long just with yourtricks.
Sherlock stepped away from the door and moved to the kitchen with his head held high and his back straight, to prove to the couple that their intimacy left him completely indifferent.
-In these three years I have created many different scenarios... I pictured you married with kids, finally with your private clinic and a cottage outside London... Happy.
That look lasted only a few moments, before John again caught the attention of the crowd.
Mycroft nodded.
-You know me better than anyone.
-No, has a matter of fact she fell in love with a colleague and we got divorced.
For Sherlock, that was a positive sign: it would take some time, but in the end, John would forgive him.
Without even imagining the wonderful man with many different sides who hid under those horrible sweaters.
With automatic gestures, the man closed the file and inserted it into his briefcase, looking for a logical solution to his problem.
-That's right. And you are… -  he asked politely before shaking his head- Actually, no.
John was a loner, the only people "authorized" to be close to him were Greg and Mrs. Hudson.
The man smiled amusedly and brought his attention back to his own cup.
Listening to the words of the song, Sherlock met John ‘stare.
-I think there's a misunderstanding Sir, this table is not available...-repeated the boy, a greater emphasis on the last word.
-And he still is? - he asked her.
The man and the girl had a silent conversation for a few moments before Boss nodded imperceptibly, leading  Baby Girl to do the same and then turn to John.
Accompanied by a resigned sigh, John looked up at the detective.
Once again an incredulous expression appeared on the young man's face.
"I can only imagine what he had to endure" said John, feeling a protective streak for his partner.
He understood from the sudden expression of dismay on the woman's face that "Mary" was aware of his story, or at least who he was.
"Romantic people would say it's fate" said John, clearly more relieved now that they had changed the subject.
The doctor remained silent, fiddling with the fork for a few moments before Sherlock spoke again.
Greg, his Gregory, had cheated on him.
"Why did you save her life if she broke your heart?" asked Molly, genuinely curious.
"That's  stalking, you know?" Daniel pointed out.
There is no post-sex smile that accompanies your every action after sexual intercourse, the muscles of your shoulders and back are still tense, obvious sign of frustration and sexual dissatisfaction, and above all there is no trace of Jack on your body- he listed quickly, before taking a long breath, without taking his eyes off John.
The old me would have been devastated by this child- commented Molly.
That their embrace was the beginning of something important and long lasting.
"What calmed you down?" he asked.
He stared at him next to the stereo, and the next moment the notes of a song he didn't know spread into the room.
Silence fell between them for a few moments until John spoke again.
Trying to breathe he turned around Sarah and approached the table, looking again at the contents of the box.
A skeptical expression appeared on John's face.
I'm surprised you are not surprised at your boyfriend's involvement in this set-up- he added.
"Is it the friend or the future mother who wants to know?" asked the man, staring back at her.
Moments later, Greg turns around and met the detective's gaze and stared him down with two furious eyes.
Jack leaned slightly forward in his own chair and stared at him with excitement on his face.
"God bless America!"  commented Sherlock.
That's why he was there.
-Heart beats.
And the most unexpected thing was that now those same images were in his mind and Sherlock was not at all opposed, indeed there was an unexpected feeling
-Hello, Mrs. Hudson, how are you? -asked the man with a polite tone.
-How about we sit down and start at the beginning? -
Sherlock nodded.
Molly didn't need any further explanation to answer that question.
All I can tell you is that every Tuesday, after leaving the clinic, Dr. Watson disappears for a few hours and then reappears at Dr. Sawyer's house.
As expected, a sudden noise came to their ears from the kitchen (the kettle placed too forcefully in its place) and next John appeared in the living room.
"I have to assume that things between you and Dr. Watson are fine now" she said with a knowing smile.
John hinted at a small sad smile.
Smiling Greg decided to leave him to his work and made his way to the main bedroom, undoing the buttons of the white shirt now full of wrinkles.
"Fuck off!"  retorted John.
The news that Sherlock Holmes, the sociopath par excellence, had become a father had spread among the investigative team with the speed of a lightning, followed by the news of John leaving Baker Street, and all of the members, starting with Sally and Anderson ending up with the last agent, were looking forward to take a look at the "poor unfortunate" baby.
"Detective don't be ridiculous" he said.
A quick cab ride had taken him to SoHo, and once in the club it was enough to look around for a few moments to know that John had not arrived yet: knowing Lestrade they had stopped to drink a pint at the pub, to get rid of the stress of a work day at the Yard.
Increasingly annoyed by the situation, Sherlock approached the kitchen, in desperate need of tea, but the sight of the two cups left half done on the kitchen counter just where John had abandoned them forced him to turn back, stopping next to the fireplace.
He also knew when to back down.
-Of course... If you need anything I'll be in the kitchen- the older man announced before leaving the room with Hamish.
Sherlock merely nodded.
When I was eighteen, my father died and from that moment my troubled years began...- he said, turning his gaze in to the restaurant to detach himself from those memories, focusing briefly on the faces of other diners, discovering within a few moments their lives and their secrets, before returning to stare at John.
Still wearing his pajamas and blue robe, Sherlock moved around the living room in a series of frantic movements as he approached the window, taking hold of the violin and then the next moment putting it back in its case and returning to sit on the couch, sending one message after another, undecided whether to send the most important text.
1) "I wanna dance with somebody" by W. Houston
With his superior mind, the man knew immediately that something was wrong, but he had accepted his silence and his lies without any more questions, perhaps frightened of what would happen by facing that conversation.
“Oh, by the way... How did you find us among this crowd?” the doctor asked turning slightly towards Sherlock.
Sherlock met for an instant John's stare, looking at the same time impressed and curious by that speech so little "Holmesian", and after a quick glance he returned to look at the Inspector.
It must have been devastating for the girl to know that a force greater than her, unbeatable, would rip them apart soon.
A policeman had seen them approaching from afar and, acknowledging John had lifted the tape to let him through.
Retreating from his thoughts, Sherlock nodded slightly.
"And I bet you're dying to tell me... - John commented, hoping with all of himself that sarcasm could hide the terror he felt to see those stupid thoughts unmasked.
John looked back at Jack, who, unaware of what had happened between the two men, had continued to talk to him about his new flame.
After all, they had so little chance of being together because of their work commitments that Mycroft would certainly not refuse every possible opportunity to be close to his Gregory.
-I know I should have waited for one of the other guys to come and help me out, but in that moment my only thought was that I had to get that kid out of there as soon as possible, so I tried to drag him to the Rover... And that's when I got hit.
Every noise in the room suddenly ceased, projecting the image of John standing motionless by the door, his coat already on and his gaze fixed on him.
"You're not going to compare your friendship with John to MY relationship with John, I hope" Sherlock warned him in a serious voice.
The man took the few steps that separated him from the two chairs in front of the desk and dropped on one, crossing his long legs and crossing his arms to his chest.
Sitting behind his desk, making completely clear that Mycroft was in that office only for his visit, Mycroft Holmes looked as tired as Greg.
They are as close as there is to the real dragons and I am sure Hamish will appreciate them- Sherlock said.
_______________________________
John sighed, letting go of his head against the back of his armchair.
Would he have used their relationship to persuade him to accept boring but well-paid private cases in times of economic hardship?
John allowed himself a little smile.
-So... Do you have a girlfriend? -John asked Sherlock, trying to hide the amused tone in his voice.
"The rest is history: he became the British Government and I became a junkie" he replied with indifference.
Three pairs of eyes rested on him: two were clearly curious, while the third was slightly concerned about what might happen soon.
-Ah, let’s see... Sometimes I have nightmares, a little present of my years in the Army- began John, carelessly rubbing his forehead.
" I could write a book" by Harry Connick Jr.
"Welcome
Greg frowned.
His mobile phone had been off since the previous day, ever since he had interrupted his phone call with Greg, aware that otherwise Sherlock would engulfed it with texts to convince him to come back, and not even two seconds after turning it back on, an avalanche of texts and multiple voice messages started to show up on his phone.
In the short interval that it took the detective to get away from the door, John catalogued all the possible information he could read on the man's face: the hair, more rebellious than usual, perhaps because of Hamish, the nervous movements of the limbs that showed clearly his anxiety and the uncertainty that accompanied that meeting, the slightly hollowed face from which John could deduce the days spent without food.
-If seeing John with someone else other than me or Greg, a real rival, doesn't bother you, I promise I won't say another word on the subject anymore and let you live your friendship as you wish- said Jack, sticking both hands in the pockets of your jacket.
-Needle and thread-
John looked at his father in disbelief.
Sherlock nodded briefly.
Greg nodded.
"Until the next secret comes out" John murmured.
Greg frowned slightly.
-Lestrade... Mycroft, I see that the diet is not working- said Sherlock in greeting.
John had accompanied her to his bedroom and told her a short story before giving her a good night and returning to the living room, where he had gone busy tidying up the room before briefly entering the kitchen to pour himself a generous glass of whiskey.
John chuckled.
"You're in a good mood" Sherlock said, looking at him with his peripheral vision.
-What day is today? -
), and unable to look away, Sherlock felt breathless.
"Shouldn't I ask you the same question?"asked Jack, sitting in front of the desk.
John chuckled slightly and shook his head: if there was one thing Sherlock had never made a mystery about it was his annoyance at anything that was even remotely connected to the institutions or the monarchy.
Mind you, just the interesting ones! -Sherlock said changing the subject.
Right now, knowing that John was enraged, really angry with him was a positive factor: Sherlock knew that John would never abandon a discussion in half when his anger towards the detective had reached these levels.
Leaving him alone again.
-You're just making a fool of yourself! - retorted Sherlock.
"Someone I know?" he asked so as not to let the silence fall.
Now get in the car, there’s a whole Boeing full of people looking at us," he said.
He had to calm down and try to rationalize what was going on.
Greg stood by the entrance cabinet and partially turned to him, an equally suffering expression on his face.
But to be honest I don't want to talk about it now; it's late and I have to go home-said John fixing his own sweater.
After the speech he had dropped into the armchair, taking a small sip of whiskey and silently waited for the other to speak.
-Seriously, what do you think of my idea?- John asked again.
Jealousy.
Sherlock had looked up at the inspector and found him absorbed in his own thoughts, his absent eyes fixed on Emma.
They had arrived in front of the apartment door and this allowed Jack to look his friend in the face, pretending to be surprised.
The following photos showed them sitting at a restaurant table engrossed in a conversation that led Greg to frown in confusion or smile clearly amused, and Mycroft wondered what the topic of discussion was cursing the right to privacy that prevented him from installing microphones in every London restaurant or shop.
It was Friday and the next day Emma would be their guest.
Sherlock slowly walked the short distance that separated him from the house and looked around, storing in his Mind Palace all the changes that had occurred and all that remained the same in those three years.
"Also, Hamish needs his father more than he needs me" added Irene, aware of the hell that was stirring in the doctor's mind but determined for once not to comment.
"Do you want me to tell you that I was in the neighborhood?" asked the detective.
The boy shrugged.
-Are you going to eat with us? - John asked him again, aware of his peculiar eating habits.
-Really? -asked in disbelief Emma.
The night he got back to Baker Street, perhaps to silence the noises buzzing in his head since his encounter with Irene, John had let himself go and dragged Sherlock into the detective's bedroom, falling on the bed while getting rid of each other's clothes.
I told you that women are not my area- replied Sherlock promptly, locking memories of an all-too-recent past that continued to contradict those words into a crypt of his Mind Palace.
-Why do you call him "Uncle" John? He's not really your uncle- the detective asked, genuinely curious about that "anomaly."
Pulling it out now and having fun tormenting him like that was just further proof of the man's sick and twisted sense of humor.
-Don't kid yourself. I'm still a simple and even slightly dull man-John retort teasingly.
Sherlock walked the short distance to the kitchen, casting a new look at the children, completely indifferent to their parents’ conversation.
Mycroft nodded slowly, without moving.
-I think you're wrong.
-Damn... Did you bring me a souvenir? - asked John with a wry smile on his lips.
-It's one of your homeless... You know some of them are still mad at you-
The press conference had to have started a while if they had come to touch on that topic.
John snorted.
And almost aware of the inferno that was stirring inside him, Sherlock found John's eyes waiting for him, as affectionate and warm as ever, despite the slight concern they let out.
A glance at John's clothes confirmed John's encounter with reporters, a small stain on his right cuff and the slight smell of alcohol told him about the beers the man had been drinking in the time away from home(
He would have preferred physical torture a thousand times rather than admit that he had missed him, the man  knew him too well.
-Is there a reason behind wild violence? - asked Daniel,  looking up to meet John's eyes.
It would have been no use making a small visit and then returning to Aldershot; he would come home only after deciding about his future.
Sherlock shrugged; his hands sank into the pockets of his coat.
-Okay, I see what you mean. And the customers agreed to pay so much money? - Greg asked curious.
The smile of circumstance appeared again, and Mycroft tilted his head slightly to the right, in a clear act of condescension.
He had to wait a few minutes for a black cab to finally stop by his side.
It was the first thing he had told him that distant evening during their first case, sitting at a table at Angelo's.
The boy shrugged his shoulders carelessly and looked back at Greg, getting up with some difficulty.
I must admit I'm curious to see their faces admitted.
Fighting against the memories that were overwhelmingly trying to make its way into his mind, Sherlock observed the slow flow of the Thames under their feet, as always unperturbed and indifferent of the hectic life of the city that had arisen around it.
-Damn it! – he said frustrated, dropping his head backwards against the sofa cushions.
-I'd better take care of the baby for the time being.
John hinted a smile.
It had been four days since he left Baker Street and because of the promise he made to Baby Girl, for the first time that morning he needed Sherlock’s help.
"You mean in two and a half months you haven't gone to see your mother yet?"asked John, beginning to understand the problem.
With a quick move of his wrist, John opened the door of the flat and went inside.
