,” Dean muttered, hurrying away from Cas’s office. Of course Cas was right. Meeting with him was extremely dangerous, especially after Michael’s dance. Dean wasn’t even sure what had brought him there . . .
“Whoa, hey, mixed company!” Gabriel declares, mockingly covering Castiel’s ears. “Tender omega ears here.”
. For a moment he lets himself bask in it, in the moment before he wakes fully: a pair of strong arms wrapped tight around him, a firm chest pressed up against his back. Cas is breathing deeply, still asleep, so Dean lets himself indulge for a moment.
Castiel watches out of the window as Dean navigates down the long, underground drive and into the bunker’s garage. Sam and Dean climb out of the car, doors screeching, and Castiel follows just a moment behind.
Little things return to normal. First, Dean’s temperature starts to equalize. Shortly after, Cas’s does, too. The bruises disappear, then the cut on his lip becomes a small scar. And that pisses Dean right off. He’s an angel, dammit, scars look
“Dean,” Cas whispered, leaning in slowly, keeping eye contact, and Dean held his breath, closed his eyes, waited for their lips to connect . . .
Gabriel looked suspicious, but clapped Cas on the shoulder. “All right, then. Let’s get you the hell out of here.”
“Dude, maybe take it easy,” Sam says to one of his roommates. He’s clearly a little tipsy, laughing and leaning against the arm of the couch next to Sam. “Jeez, Dean, we have guests.”
So, Castiel might not be a total douche, but he’s stiff as hell. Dean’s starting to chafe under the empty air, and after a while Castiel’s demeanor starts to slip. His eyes dart sideways, he licks his lips a lot, and opens his mouth a couple of times a minute as though he’s going to start saying something. He never does. Dean sips his particularly dry wine just for something to do while they wait on the food they ordered.
“Sorry for, y’know,” he said, and through the haze of two spectacular orgasms, it took Cas a moment to remember what Dean meant. He traced a tear track down Dean’s cheek, and considered it a win that Dean didn’t shy away.
“Your order, sir,” Nick oozes. Dean picks up his fork, making Nick step back a bit. It gives Dean a little satisfaction that the asshole is afraid of him.
According to a chipper healer named Charlie (who spends an entire afternoon lamenting the sexist nature of the all-male Society of Letters and sneaks Dean slices of pie), Cas made it back to Lebanon on foot, though he was badly shaken and had serious injuries that needed tending. Apparently, he wouldn’t tell anyone anything that happened, but instead has been holed up in his study alone.
Charlie. Sam got to know her well while Dean was gone, and he trusts her, but he also can’t forget that she comes from a universe where angels tortured and killed people.
"This is a part of the new approach, based on an article I read by your psychologist." Naomi informs him. "Most people are naturally inclined to hide or minimize their strong feelings, and this can lead to scent confusion in those that... aren't naturally inclined to reading people.
"Well I'm apparently an idiot who didn't know he swings both ways." Dean mutters between kisses. "It took you saying it for me to start realizing what this feeling was."
Dean smells of rotten apples now, and Castiel can only assume it's the same hurt that he hears in his mate's voice. He doesn't like it, his alpha doesn't like it.
"So funny, how humans have this idea of themselves..." Crowley ponders. "The things they can ignore or tell themselves aren't 'really them'. I've seen it so many times in Hell, people who don't understand why they're down there, because all their sins and hypocrisy go in this little box called 'not really me'."
"I don't know what happened or where he went. I filed a missing person's report but the investigation showed that he'd left intentionally. He'd packed his clothes, quit his job, and taken all his documents. Of course, everyone looked down on me, an omega abandoned by her mate. It was a great struggle, Castiel, to care for you three boys."
Sam must be Dean's younger brother, Castiel reasons, and he's cared for him since young. Obviously he has good omega instincts.
Castiel had always been different. With his calm demeanor, especially compared to his alpha brothers Michael and Lucifer, his mother Naomi had thought he might grow up to be a beta or an omega. But at 13 when Castiel went into rut, she took it in stride. Bearing three alpha sons to a beta meant she started to get interest from suitors despite her widowed status.
"Said I wouldn't find you one. I figured you'd pick one for yourself. Or worst case, get knocked up and mate." John replies, shrugging. "Best case, meet your true mate. Didn't think you'd reject them."
Dean's second day isn't as fun. Someone in a nearby room has a radio, and it plays terrible pop music most of the day, from the moment he wakes up.
His expression changes from amused to troubled, and after an awkward silence he pulls out his silver knife and holy water.
Castiel doesn't like the comment about him being weird. He doesn't want Dean knowing about his condition, not yet at least. Not before he knows
"You know I wasn't rich growing up." Castiel snaps. He closes his eyes, casts his mind back. He hadn't paid much attention to courting and dates when he was a kid. "Um, people go to Olive Garden or Red Lobster for dates a lot, if I recall correctly."
"And another thing, -" Balth interjects "I'm tired of you talking about omegas like you know a damn thing about them. Have you ever even had an omega friend?"
." he protests. "Yeah, he said he realized it was a stupid and fucked up idea. And Beauty and the Beast sounds too cute, I call it trying to Stockholm syndrome me."
"Absolutely not." Naomi says, startling him. "If you tell him, he's just going to want you to act like... not an alpha."
"Look, he accepted you didn't want to mate right away, and he didn't even try to bribe me to sign you over, even though he looks loaded. I bet you gave him the cold shoulder tonight and he still bought you a pie. He's clearly a sap deep down, you could have him wrapped around your little finger within a month."
Normally he'd shrug, go off and have a beer and blow off some steam. But stuck at home and confined to bedrest, he decided to go ahead and try to figure out the feeling. It could be related to the case, after all.
Castiel sighs. He really doesn't want to get into a second fight already on this date. "We can leave."
"Precisely." Crowley pulls out a folder. "And if I've read it then it's only fair I offer you the same opportunity, since he's your true mate."
He flips to the first page and sees a newspaper clipping of a housefire, right here in this town. Tragic. But... he reads the police report with surprise. Dean's mother was murdered, and the killer tried to cover it up with arson.
There are highlights from John's police statement describing the man, and a map of John's known movements related to the case, leads followed. There's also another, smaller folder inside. It seems the private investigator, or whoever Crowley hired, went the extra mile and researched the killer. A list of possible sightings, similar crimes in other states, and potential aliases and gang affiliations. In the last six years, John seems to have hit a dead end in his investigation.
Mary would be so happy for their boy, he thinks. "Not gonna let him screw this up." he mumbles in promise.
"Barely." snorts Castiel. "Whatever my dad went chasing, you're not that much better for chasing Azazel or whatever his name is."
Benny sighs. "Fine, no messing with your food. You two order from the waiter, and I won't know what's for who." He nods to Dean, then goes back to the kitchen.
After dinner, Crowley pours them drinks and discusses accounting practices with Castiel for few minutes, when his mother announces she's quite tired and says goodnight to them both. Once she leaves, Crowley changes the subject.
The garage where dean works is owned by a man named Rufus Turner and is small but reputable. Castiel is glad that Dean hasn't tried to follow in his father's footsteps.
Dean sighed. Not a lot to go on so far. There were myths about gay gods and stuff, but none specifically mentioned changing human's sexualities.
"No doubt." Dean agrees, feeling more at ease with everything now as the nurse packs his trolley and waves bye.
if you ever... mate someone else." Castiel feels sick at the idea. Dean's eyes widened at the acknowledgement of the possibility. "I'd just like to know that there's no chance."
Castiel took this in. No wonder Dean was reluctant about the true mates thing, though pushing Castiel away completely still seemed unnecessary. "So you want to make sure you're compatible with whoever you mate?"
As he goes to purchase food, he overhears her speaking "- obviously the true best super power is being able to stop time like Zach Morris -" and he stands corrected.
They offer him tea. As he sits at the kitchen table, in his mind's eye a sleep-ruffled Dean sits across from him with a mug of coffee in morning light, smiling softly.
At some point, John started bounty hunting because it helped him make connections and hone skills to search for the killer, and it supported his lifestyle of constant travel.
"I can smell your hurt." Naomi informs him. "You smell like you've been at a campfire, usually. When you're angry you smell like they burned treated wood, all chemical and poison. When you're hurt you smell like you're burning rotted wood, musty. It's not your fault, Castiel. I've always struggled with my omega instincts. Then when your father..."
"Yeah, he said he realized it was wrong. I didn't know whether to believe him, honestly, but he asked me if I'd date him for real and I said no. And he said it was alright and left!"
"You just don't want him to need you around, or need protecting." It's John's fault Dean is convinced that alphas just trap you in lives you don't want, he's sure of it. Whatever narrative John is living in is of no interest to him.
"You'd be fine even if I did." John waves his hand. "He's your true mate, plus he smells about as aggressive as a golden retriever."
Yet somehow, Sam had eventually come out of it alive and sane. It was the most Dean could have hoped for.
"Yeah, you're welcome for talking some sense into you." Balth replies smarmily. "Now repeat after me -
"Hello young man!" Barry says, and Castiel can tell he's on speakerphone. "Martha and I wanted to call you personally and tell you we want to sell the house to you."
"A true mate, no less." Naomi wonders. "Well, you'll need to get to the bottom of this. Figure out what his problem is."
Castiel doesn't know what to do. He wants to plead, but alphas don't beg. And he has to show Dean he'll be a good alpha to him.
When he turns 18. he applies to university to study business and accounting. It's a stable, well-paying field, and he knows from observing Crowley's company that they're always in demand.
"You know I like to keep busy. But between the injury and this curse or whatever, I can't do shit. Barely even listen to music. So I end up thinking too much."
The man looks over to Castiel. "You look a bit too fancy to be in a place like this, causing trouble."
Not to mention, he's still injured bad enough that he can't see this being fun even if he's into it.
It's quite the dark story, he thinks as he flips through. The main suspect was described as an alpha who smelled like sulphur. It seems that after the murder, John became obsessed with finding the killer and started investigating.
He gets up, and hands it in. Crowley reads it quickly, nodding to all the things he remembers as well.
"Hurt?" Castiel asks, surprised. It's an unfamiliar smell to him. He hates that he hurt his mother's feelings. "Should I go apologize?"
"In the hospital, second day." Dean says. "Actually it was kinda weird, the radio in the next room was playing a lotta gay songs -"
"Odd. You're an excellent prospect, any omega should be jumping at the chance to mate you." Crowley frowns.
The reason for rejection is visible in the section for gender and secondary: "Alpha" and "Beta" are printed with boxes to check. Then there's a third box with "Omega" written next to it that was clearly hand-drawn and then checked by Dean. It seems that bounty hunting doesn't consider omega applicants.
Tension broken, Cas smiled, “Dean,” grabbing his hand, running his thumb over the face of the ring, “I’m not going anywhere.”
“Cas?” Cas, still on the ground, began stirring as Dean turned him on his back, positioning him to be somewhat upright, “Cas! You okay, man?”
Grinning, Dean brings his other hand up to cup Cas’ cheek, “Looks like you’re stuck with me forever, then.”
into his pillow, on the nights that he makes it back to his bed before passing out. Into the mirror, hands clutching the sink, barely able to stay upright, not able to meet his own eyes in the reflection. Into every bottle, every glass, every sip, a morbid perversion of saying grace before a meal.
Aside from the time spent on their individual hobbies – Dean holed up in his workshop, listening to music, working on his latest project, and Cas in his garden, weeding and pruning and inspecting his beehives – they were nearly inseparable. Both having lost the other a few too many times, there was a silent assurance in Dean’s hand resting on the Cas’ knee while drinking coffee in the morning, in Cas’ arm around Dean’s back when they went into town, in Dean practically lying on top of Cas when they curled up to watch a movie after a long day. Each touch a reminder, a promise:
Once Jack and his powers were reasonably under control, Sam threw himself into his work. He spread the word to other hunters about the bunker. He offered up beds to those passing through the area. The library and research assistance to those who needed to track down arcane lore. The dungeon, if a hunter was dealing with a particularly nasty monster or demon. He gained their trust enough to take on a dispatcher role in the community, tracking patterns from the bunker and contacting hunters in the area. Jack was particularly helpful in poring through news reports to identify trends in a region.
Dean wasn’t exactly rolling in positive self-worth before the whole Michael situation, and this feeling of uselessness around Sam and other hunters wasn’t helping any, so Dean spent more and more time away from the Bunker, going out with a destination in mind or just driving for the sake of driving. And of course, he took Cas with him.
Sam grabs the second syringe, preparing it. It takes everything in him to not inject it right now, but Dean asked for 3 minutes.
Cas also knew Dean well enough to know that, when he got like this, Dean just had to get it out of his system. Play his music a little too loud, drive a little too fast. These were the only times Dean spoke verbally – thinking loudly just didn’t have the same effect. The words that came out still didn’t make sense, but they didn’t need to, for Dean or Cas.
Jack leaves after a while, god-duties to attend to. Dean watches for a little longer, but eventually the nagging part of his brain gets too loud to ignore. Someone is missing from this family, someone he hasn’t stopped thinking about or praying to since he was taken. “I hope you’ve got your ears on, Cas. I’m on my way.”
In the time since they defeated Chuck, Dean has tried every day to prove himself worthy of not only Cas’ love, but his sacrifice. He got back into construction work, putting his efforts into building and repairing and creating rather than killing and destroying. Even got his own place, just some shitty apartment in town with barely enough space for him and Miracle, but the bunker was starting to feel too crowded, so many people always around, but Dean had never felt more alone.
sent his way as Dean stormed past towards the garage was any indication, something must have set Dean off.
A decade ago, Dean went down kicking and screaming, fighting for his life tooth and nail. Now, on the edge of death by his own hand, he’s about ready to beg to not be sent back. Heaven would be a nice upside, sure, but he’s been to Hell; he’d take either over more of the same.
He wishes he could say this was a surprise. Dean never exactly handled grief well, but this time was different. Sam should have seen it coming – he did see it coming – but obviously he didn’t do enough to help.
Sam was there last time, when Cas was gone. He saw first-hand how poorly Dean handled the loss, the grief. Dean doesn’t need to say that this is what he wants, not in so many words, but he needs to be sure that Sam won’t try to bring him back.
"Okay, did anything else strange happen? Wait, you said that that doctor looked like Dr Sexy." Sam remembers.
He inspects his wounds, then checks his blood pressure and heart rate. Dean can't help notice that the guy's aftershave is awesome. He feels too awkward to ask what it is, though. He still feels starstruck, especially getting a medical exam from this guy.
"I'd feel bad misleading you." he says. "It's not going well with my mate... his father pressured him into seeing me. He resents it, and I just don't know if it's salvageable. I'm going to apologize tonight and tell him he doesn't have to see me if he doesn't want. I'm not optimistic."
Dean swallows. "I'm sorry Sam. I just didn't want to go out scared and crying. You know I'll never leave you behind on purpose, right?"
Castiel is shaken. Surely Dean can smell him in the same room? Was he wrong? Are his alpha instincts defective in more ways than he knew?
"I'm not blind! Just talk to him!" Sam shouted. "Get over yourself and go tell him you feel the same way!"
to take Dean back, obviously, he wants him to stay and sleep next to him in a big bed in that perfect house he saw. Perfect even if those smaller bedrooms would never be occupied, he decides. They could be a guest room and an office and some kind of hobby room for Dean...
"Never thought about it like that." Sam said. "But maybe this is... good? You have time and there's not that much going on."
Interestingly, eventually Charlie is also brought on to assist with this project. There's been some technical issue that Castiel doesn't understand on the customer's end, some kind of corruption of their database he thinks? So far she hasn't asked him to do anything though.
"Then one day, three years later, I woke up to my mating bite burning and going grey. He died, somewhere, somehow, and all I could think was that I was free. I received life insurance. I moved us to a new town. As far as anyone knew, I'd never been abandoned, just tragically widowed. People helped, they gave me work, felt sorry for us."
"Ah. No, I really mean it. I mean, I'm still hoping you change your mind someday, but... I accept that it might not happen."
It had been so hard to accept that they couldn't get him back. He'd prayed, just in case Cas could hear him, telling him that they were looking for ways to help him, Jack too. Then eventually, that he couldn't find anything, but that he was holding out hope for Jack to succeed. Trying to stay optimistic in his prayers so that he would hold on in the Empty.
Castiel moves in within a week, since it turned out the older couple got their own new place quickly and were happy for him to move in whenever possible.
"I haven't watched anything like this before, obviously." Dean insists. "But I know it wouldn't have done anything for me before! I'm not into dudes!"
"I blame my fath- Chuck." Castiel says, and Naomi gives him a look he doesn't recognize, and sweet lemons. Gratitude, she informs him. "He abandoned all of us."
After another moment, she sits back down and says "There's a box of flash drives in the second drawer of my desk in the IT department. There's one that says Alohomora on it. Can you bring it to me? People can point out my desk for you if you ask."
"Thanks." Castiel says, because even if he doesn't believe that, John is at least trying to make him feel better.
Dean looks and smells amazing. He's wearing jeans and an emerald button up shirt that brings out his eyes. Maybe it's a good sign?
Dean chuckles at that. This guy is about as nervous as he is, and for some reason that's making this easier.
"Whoa!" Sam says, putting his hand on Deans shoulder to make sure he didn't move. "This was a bad one, Dean. You're gonna be stuck in bed for at least one more day, then take it really easy for a while."
Dean nods. "I felt like an asshole. Which is fucked up, I'm the one that's been forced into this. And my dad's gonna be
Dean shakes his head. "I love the kid, but I basically raised him on my own because my dad's to busy drinking and hunting since my mom died to do it himself. Not cause I love parenting or some crap."
Dean narrowed his eyes. He scrolled down, seeing more pointless questions about random preferences, and then the same question about whether you like the same gender with more and more emphatic wording.
He tries to focus on not-Dr-Sexy's voice, who is talking him through the process, but he finds that it doesn't help at all.
"Not traditional at all." his friend snarks. "Well I'll tell you what - make friends with an omega for real, and I'll believe you actually know something about them."
"Sponge bath, bandage change." Mick answers directly, already peeling back Dean's sheets. "Sorry, no hot nurse in a skimpy uniform for ya, pal."
stalking an omega through the streets to this bar? We don't take kindly to that kind of thing in here."
He heard slow clapping, and looked up to see Crowley applauding his victory. "Nicely done, Castiel. You've grown into a strapping young alpha."
John slaps him on the back. "Don't start getting down, he'll come around. You know, I met my true mate in a bar..."
Dean says he doesn't want a proper alpha, but he doubts he wants a defective one either, Castiel thinks dejectedly.
He forced Michael to submit, adrenaline thrumming at his first real fight since he'd been an almost freshly presented teen. He'd won. "Don't you ever talk about our mother like that again." he growled.
John chuckles. "I'm going to be emailing copies to my connections within the hour. I'm finally finding this guy, Novak. God, you have no idea. Or maybe you do. I'm not even mad that you tried to stop me, cause you're worried about Dean right? And that's the true mate coming out. I get it." John sounds elated.
"Ah, sorry." Dean says, deflating a little. "Well, there was stuff that neither of them were willing to compromise on. Big stuff, how they wanted to live, how they wanted their kids raised. That kind of stuff isn't easy to fix if you're incompatible, and they jumped into the mating without figuring any of that out because they were true mates."
Dean was annoyed with Sam. He finally made it to Heaven, and what does he do after they get in Baby? Ask about Cas.
" Naomi insists, and she smells not just sour like her anger, but like bleach, which Castiel doesn't recognize. "All our hard work, and for what? For you to just abandon your responsibilities just because your mate has?"
Crowley is pleased, but as he wrinkles his brows irritatedly at the crying, Castiel can tell he wouldn't have the temperament to be a proper father. Luckily he's wealthy enough that all the bumps in the road will be smoothed over if he is willing.
Gabriel, it turned out, lived in New York City and could drop by any time Cas wanted. Cas told him that he was pretty busy right now, but would think about it.
Cas’s shift that day had ended two hours ago, and he still wasn’t home. It was a short trip from his job at the Gas ‘N Sip to their dingy little apartment, so Cas usually walked. He’d done the same thing through two previous Chicago winters, but that didn’t stop Dean from worrying as the snow fell hard and fast.
Dean flushed bright red from under his collar all the way up to his hairline. He tossed the DVD onto his bed and shoved his hands in his pockets. “Doesn’t have to mean anything, Cas,” he said, avoiding Cas’s eyes. Cas swallowed again, gulping down against his nerves.
Dean huffed a laugh, looking sheepishly at his plate. “Yeah, well, it was recommended by Dr. Milton, so . . .”
Dean had been devastated; the hardest part for Cas was watching him shut down. Cas had brought him home and tucked him into bed with the prescription pain relievers and a glass of water before heading down the short hallway to the last unfinished room in the house.
Usually Dean was the one leading them into stupid, trouble-seeking adventures, but as graduation approached, Cas was finding it more and more difficult to live under the stifling thumb of his uncle’s house rules. As the ward of the pastor of the church their families both attended, Cas was at worship every Sunday, bible study every Wednesday, and every teen and community event throughout the week. He was kept so busy with church, in fact, that Dean wondered how on Earth he was able to be their class valedictorian, too. It had been Cas who suggested this particular bit of rebellion, which Dean had readily agreed to. Anything for his best friend.
He’s nearly into town when his phone buzzes at him from his back pocket. It takes a little maneuvering, but he manages to grab it while at one of the only two stoplights between the Bunker and the convenience store. He swipes the screen to answer Cas’s incoming call.
“I’m gonna turn in,” Dean calls behind him. It’s a dismissal, which Castiel usually heeds. Not tonight.
Dean clenched his fists, but managed to hold himself back. It had been a long time since he’d been called that in public.
The male omega was named Kevin Tran, and his interview went fairly smoothly. Castiel got him talking about his mother, which took up much of the hour. She’d raised him as a beta, so there were quite a few stories he could tell about his childhood before he presented. Castiel felt a pang of pity that he had to hide when Kevin’s scent dropped low with sadness as he spoke about his dashed hopes of Harvard (or Princeton, if Harvard was out). In the end, Castiel scheduled another interview time and thanked him.
“Wow, I guess they must serve the good shit at Vinehall parties. Remind me to get myself invited next time!”
Because Castiel is nothing special, just some geeky omega, who’s smart, sure, but definitely not worthy of this stunning, brilliant older alpha whose hands feel strong and warm where they caress his shoulders. Whose gaze feels like it can see right through him, and whose scent wraps him in its arms like coming home.
A young man with dark hair was bent nearly double over a notebook, scribbling furiously into it. He was dressed nicely, though the quality if his clothing was obviously not the same as the rest of the omegas around him. As Dean approached, he scented the air subtly and was surprised when he didn’t get a whiff of the school-official violet scent. So, not a student, then? Maybe a beta assistant? When he was close enough, Dean cleared his throat lightly, and the man startled, looking up at Dean quickly.
“Yeah, okay.” Another long pause. “So, just thought I’d tell you that Charlie got out. I was gonna go see her, if you wanted.”
Gilda had thanked him profusely for getting Charlie’s charges dropped, which Castiel had assured her was not only nothing, but had actually been Gabriel’s doing.
. His hair is a mess, and he has deep purple smudges under his eyes. He practically melts when he sees Dean.
Castiel knows Dean’s body even better than his own, has tracked its changes through the years, but even so it’s different when it’s pressed up against his so completely. It’s in the comfort of Dean’s embrace that the tears he’s been fighting finally fall.
echoes inside his head with each step as he strides after Dean, pressing a hand on the door to keep it open as Dean throws his duffel down on the bed.
“Then we figure it out,” Dean says. He takes a deep breath and reaches out to cup Cas’s cheek. Cas leans into his hand, giving Dean courage. “Cas, I don’t want to live afraid anymore. I want to start something, start living for me instead. And I thought, maybe . . . if you wanted . . . I could do that with you.”
Cas stumbled past Gabriel and into the entryway, but had no idea what to do next. Gabriel chuckled. “Seriously, Cassie, how much have you had? Should you have driven home?” Cas shook his head.
Dean scrunched his fingers into the nice slacks he wore. “Uh, sure. There’s me, and there’s Sam, and Bobby. He’s my alpha-guardian. Or, I guess he was before I came here.”
something. He spars with Sam in one of the courtyards, teasing his little brother about how soft and slow he’s gotten, which is satisfying until Sam sweeps Dean’s feet out from under him and spends the next hour gloating.
Cas realized he was pacing, but as the clock inched closer to one, he couldn’t help but feel more and more nervous. What if Dean decided not to come? What if he didn’t want to participate? How was he possibly going to be in a room with him for an hour? Hannah and their assigned beta chaperone, a reedy guy named Garth, would be there, too, of course, but still. This would be his first interview, and he was nervous.
It’s not until a few hours later, on the drive back to the bunker, that Dean feels it. Quiet, at first, but getting louder. Maybe this is what it feels like to go crazy, his brain creating the sensation he’s been desperately missing.
He’s not under any delusions. He knows that Cas isn’t coming back this time. Even if they did get Chuck to bring back everyone he snapped away, Cas was taken by the Empty, not by Chuck, and Chuck isn’t exactly doing them any favors these days.
The one good thing to come out of this situation was Cas moving into the bunker full-time. Being able to communicate without having to speak certainly had its perks.
There’s a clock hanging over his head, so Dean makes the most of the time he has left. He eats some pie, saves some kids, kills some vamps. And if he’s more reckless than usual, loses his weapon, pulls his punches, lets himself get tossed around without trying all that hard to defend himself, Sam doesn’t seem to notice. He doesn’t notice when Dean get shoved against a support beam, a piece of rebar stabbing into his back. He certainly doesn’t notice the glimpse of a smile, the relief that washes over Dean in a split second.
The gangly teen that showed up on his doorstep grew into an extremely handsome, noble man, and despite what Dean thinks of himself, Castiel knows that Dean is one of the best men in the kingdom. It doesn’t matter what his past holds, or whether or not he has magical talent; Castiel would trade any of his brothers for Dean’s company any day.
“Time for bed,” he mutters to himself, using the pen and a quick spell to extract what ink splotches he can without completely erasing the notes. Satisfied that it’s as clean as it’s going to get, he extinguishes the lamp on his desk as he goes to turn in for the night.
Castiel shook his head furiously. His room was upstairs, which meant he would have to pass too close to the hallway where Dean was. Dean, the beautiful omega with the addicting scent who was in heat, just a few doors away, and why was he sitting here again?
“Dean,” Cas manages, sucking a dark purple mark onto Dean’s neck. “Oh, Dean, you’re so perfect. My perfect omega.”
Dean started, hugging himself against the cold as he turned and backed away from his unexpected companion.
Dean rose and moved toward the door, then paused. “Wait . . . do you . . . you said . . . my benefactor?” Crowley grunted. Dean swallowed hard. “Do you . . . do you know why I’m here?”
Dean checked the clock and briefly considered lying, but even though Cas was barely awake, he would somehow know in the morning. And tomorrow (later today, really) was probably the worst day to start out angry with each other.
“Mom and Bobby were in the area, said there’s a basic salt-and-burn outside of Wichita. Thought we could take care of it.”
“Uh, yeah,” Sam says, moving over to the sofa. Castiel takes a moment to wonder where the other guys have gone to; they didn’t run into them on their tour, and they aren’t sitting in the living room. Sam settles his long limbs into a corner of the couch, while Castiel perches on the opposite end. “Well, I am. I’m majoring in psych, that’s how I know Gabe. We’re in the same year, same advisor. Benny’s in business; restaurant management’s his thing.”
Dean scuffs his toe in the dirt. “Yeah, I, uh, wanted to apologize. For dinner. That was really shitty of me.”
There’s a knock on the door frame behind him, and Dean only realizes he’s whining quietly when he cuts off abruptly. Charlie’s there, her face somehow both pinched and concerned at the same time. Dean wonders, again, what he smells like to her.
“You don’t look so bad yourself,” Dean said. Cas looked at his own suit as though he didn’t even realize what he was wearing.
Cas moves his hands up and presses firmly against Dean’s chest, moving him back far enough to make eye contact in the dim. He raises an eyebrow in question and waits. Dean stares at him for a long moment, then slumps against Cas’s hands.
It’s eerily quiet in the Bunker. After Castiel had assured that Michael wasn’t hiding somewhere within the power Jack consumed, it had been a long afternoon of searching out the bodies of Michael’s victims. No one in the Bunker had been spared. Of the twenty or so hunters that circulated through the hub, fifteen were burnt-out shells that Castiel, Dean, Sam, and Jack had burned on a pyre deep in the woods.
Behind him, Cas begins to stir, stretching his legs a little as he nuzzles into Dean’s neck from behind. A fluttering thrill runs through Dean, a little flicker of desire flashing through his gut, but then he gathers himself and moves away. Cas clutches at him, trying to pull him back, but Dean can’t handle that.
The sounds from the porn helped. He thought about what Dean had sounded like the other night, breathy and quiet, moans practically forced from him as he stroked himself in secret. He could feel Dean’s eyes on him now, and that thought had him growing thick and hard in his hand. It was starting to feel even better as he filled out, blood rushing toward the point of contact as he teased himself up and down his shaft. He reached into the little drawer in his bedside table and pulled out a new bottle of lube he’d stashed for this occasion. He popped the lid open and drizzled some on his fingers. It was cold, so he warmed it up for a moment before reaching under his sheet and wrapping his slick hand around his cock.
“It wasn’t long after that when I began to consider you a friend as well. There was a day when you accepted a contract from us that I knew wouldn’t have gotten your usual fee, but you said you ‘owed me a favor’ and I realized that you owed me no such thing.”
“You didn’t offend, Mr. Winchester.” A thick pause stretched between them, one Castiel found himself longing to break, but couldn’t bear to do it.
Dean scoffs and rolls his eyes, tossing his napkin down on the table. “You know what, never mind. I don’t think I want to eat anything here, anyway.” He stands, looking down at Castiel, and freezes. Castiel isn’t looking at him with disgust, or pity, or confusion. He’s not even ignoring Dean’s outburst. The look in Castiel’s eyes is such extreme disappointment that it nearly takes Dean’s breath away. Nick’s sputtering tears Dean out of the moment.
I apologize if this is terribly forward, but Charlie Bradbury sent me your contact information via my brother Gabriel and he was insistent that I contact you at the earliest opportunity. I wonder if you might join me for dinner this Thursday evening at 7pm? I have taken the liberty of arranging reservations at Guidry’s for that time. Please let me know if you are not amenable and I may adjust accordingly.
Castiel feels warm down to his core to hear that, wrapping his arms around Dean as he settles over the top of him. They kiss until Castiel’s lips are numb and his cock is nudging against Dean’s hip. Dean shifts, moving his hands to pin Castiel’s wrists to the bed, and Castiel moans at the friction. Dean pulls back and lifts an eyebrow, slowly grinding his hips against Castiel’s. Castiel bites his lip, flexing his fingers within Dean’s grasp, a long, high-pitched whine easing from him as Dean rocks.
Castiel finally stopped his fretful pacing, hands clasped in front of him. He looked desperate, his hair in even more disarray than usual. If anyone were to walk in now, to see the two of them in the alpha’s clothes, the state of their hair and their scents . . .
“I can sense Michael’s grace.” Cas’s voice is barely above a whisper as he speaks the words into Dean’s skin, pressing those feathery kisses along Dean’s jaw and across his cheekbone. Dean clutches at Cas’s wrists, his heart racing again for a very different reason. “I can sense when he’s there, when he’s being subdued, and when he leaves.”
Dean stopped, doubled over in pain, hand on his stomach, an involuntary groan pulled from him. Cas’s hand was suddenly on his back, searing, icy cool against the flaming heat of his skin . . .
Castiel gets another excellent hand (a full house with two cards in the flop), but he must be overeager because Dean makes a big show of sniffing the air before folding.
“You okay?” Dean asked, easing his fingers out of Castiel, his eyes full of concern. Castiel smiled sheepishly.
“And I’m Benny,” comes from Castiel’s side, where a giant bear of a beta stands, paw extended to shake Castiel’s hand. Benny seems a little more sober than Dean, though his scent is covered by the same smell of smoke coming from Gabriel. Castiel shakes Benny’s hand stiffly. Gabriel groans from beside him.
“I skipped my last dose,” Castiel said. “I’m going in next week. I thought for sure it would have worn off by now.”
Dean flinched as Michael took the watch from the case, eased the case from Dean’s hands, then reached out to hold Dean’s wrist.
“Could you, um . . .” he trailed off, his eyes surveying Cas’s face. Bright eyes, chapped lips, flushed cheeks. “Would you like . . .?” He couldn’t finish.
“Fuck this stupid tie,” he muttered, fumbling with his bowtie. Sarah took pity on him and helped him tie it properly before turning back to Dean.
“I didn’t mean to intrude on your nest. I know that omegas often build them in times of great duress—”
Dean moves to attack Cas’s torso with wet, sucking kisses but Cas stops him with a hand to his chest. “What is it, Dean?”
Angrily, he blinks the tears away before they can fall, slams the notebook shut and searches for a place to hide it, somewhere Sammy, or Jack, or Cas—
“I’m busy,” Castiel said, sipping from his own mug. “Which is why I told you that I can’t possibly have you stay with me—”
Dean blows a sharp breath through his lips, considering his options. He can leave Cas behind easily enough; he knows the terrain and he’s better travelled. Besides that, he’s been preparing for something like this since he set out on his own, and despite Cas’s superior magic ability, Dean is far better equipped for the task.
Castiel’s stomach is in knots. “The key to an evil curse is . . . love?” he breathes. A long moment passes between them until Dean reaches out to gently touch Castiel’s cheek.
This, though, is lightning and thunder breaking across his skin, waves crashing on the shore and the proverbial port in a storm. Dean kisses like he’s starving, delving deep into Castiel’s mouth with his tongue, coaxing noises out of Castiel that he didn’t even know he could make. One hand works Dean’s dick, massaging his growing knot, while the other grips onto Dean’s bicep as he holds on for dear life.
Dean reached up to cradle Cas’s face in his hands and pressed back, dragging the kiss to a deeper place, before pulling back to brush them gently together.
They broke apart, finally, but didn’t move far. Cas pressed his forehead against Dean’s and gazed at him in wonder, as though Dean was the most precious thing in the whole universe.
Dean seethed and his blood ran cold. He’d been the one to send Kevin there in the first place, to Cas—to
It took two days for Cas’s scent to fade enough for Dean to feel safe venturing out of his room. He’d returned to his room in a rush, in unfamiliar clothes, soaked in some strange alpha’s scent; it was no wonder he’d scared poor Kevin half to death.
“I didn’t want it to have to be you,” he says quietly, then gestures to his bloodstained head. “You see how well that worked out.” Dean shifts forward, wincing as he takes both of Castiel’s hands in his. “I’d be with you forever if I could, Cas, you gotta know that, but it ain’t in the cards for us. You do this, I’m gonna be with you as long as . . . as long as I can, before . . .”
And wouldn’t it just be the icing on the cake if any of this got back to Crowley? Or Adler? Or Michael? Dean’s anxiety started to spike, but even as it did Cas reached across the seat and placed a steadying hand on his wrist.
He enters the Roadhouse, the place almost empty since it was early in the day, and is promptly met with a grumpy looking woman pointing a shotgun at him.
Cas was standing in front of him, more handsome than ever now that he was in his element. He looked surprised and concerned, and, Dean noted, a little nervous.
He mopes a little, once he unpacks, but then starts setting things up. A new mattress, memory foam. The wallpaper is somewhat faded in the kitchen, so he hires a beta worker to replace it all with a reasonably close match. The couch too, it's not bad but it looks... tired, so Castiel donates it and buys one that complements the existing décor.
"Nonsense, three alpha boys - or should I say men now? - under one roof, I'm surprised there hasn't been more tousling."
Maybe it was just that it's hard for that stuff to happen in the bunker, unless a gaggle of male strippers magically fell through the ceiling or something.
He wanted to reassure Dean that nothing would happen he didn't want. But that would be a lie, wouldn't it? He already didn't want the date. But he couldn't just
Sam sobs a little, and gets up to hug Dean. Dean hugs back gingerly. "Hey. Sammy. I'm sorry, alright. I thought it was over."
Dean ignores him. He finishes the essay with Cas managing to restore him to humanity, sacrificing his remaining grace.
Castiel wakes some time later to a gentle hand on his back. He groans, turning to nuzzle into the warm, comfortable bed beneath him. It smells comforting, and he feels protected within its embrace. Someone above him chuckles.
It was far too easy to fall into an almost comfortable silence with Dean. Despite the way they’d parted the other night, something thick and dangerous was growing in between them.
Dean jumped at the voice. He hadn’t scented anyone approaching, but there was a man leaning up against the doorway, staring at him. He was short, with shaggy brown hair even longer than Sam’s. And a beta, too, now that he was close enough for Dean to scent him, which explained how he was able to sneak up on Dean.
Castiel looked toward Hannah in the front seat. “Hannah, can you take us to the park just outside of town?” Hannah rolled her eyes.
Cas’s voice is so quiet, Dean would have missed it if he hadn’t been so close to Dean’s ear. His heart races, but he maintains the slow drag of his finger over Cas’s skin.
The omega stared back at him. “Wow, I’m sure you’ve gotten a lot of people to say yes to you with a sales pitch like that.”
He needed to call Hannah. Perhaps he should even tell her to return to California without him. A wild thought of never returning flitted through his brain, and he nearly laughed. No, Naomi would never allow that. He would finish his project, then put Dean far, far behind him.
Dean’s chest heaved against the sobs threatening to overflow. He thought he was over this. He’d cried plenty, thinking about what could have happened, but this was the best case scenario. Sam was taken care of, so was Bobby, and Dean . . . what omega could want more?
Gabriel regarded him for a moment. “I think . . .” He sighed. “You’ve got one god-damned unsatisfactory bitch of a situation here.”
Something unfamiliar flashes in Cas’s eyes before he narrows them. “I am the Archmage of Lebanon,” he repeats and Dean resists the urge to groan. “If there is something evil threatening the kingdom, I am obligated to act, Dean. You can try to leave me behind, but I promise I will find a way to follow.”
“Your friend, Charlie, always speaks very highly of you,” Castiel says. Dean is so surprised he chokes on a bite of the appetizer and has to gulp down wine to recover.
The evening carried on with more soft music and a few speeches from the company’s leadership. He couldn’t help but notice Dean fidgeting a little more than usual. He placed a soothing hand on his shoulder, and it seemed to help. As the night wore on, Dean gradually started losing parts of his outfit; first, the bowtie came off and he unbuttoned the top button of his shirt.
Dean was currently looking up at Cas expectantly, so Cas shrugged. “Why not?” he said. Dean practically jumped to his feet, fished a couple of beers out of the mini-fridge and dug through his video collection.
“She needs to get out, now!” Dean snapped. “I ain’t risking shit so you can play video games. You risk your own ass, but keep mine out of it.”
“Absent, mostly. I was sent . . .” he trailed off, eyeing her suspiciously. “I think we’re veering off course, Gilda. This is about you, after all.”
“She’s your friend?” he asked, still in that quiet, even tone. But Dean couldn’t let his guard down, couldn’t let an alpha hurt him like he’d been hurt in the past.
“To each their own, Red,” Balthazar quipped slyly, sipping on his drink. Charlie stuck her tongue out at him.
Castiel shot Balthazar a look. He glared at the yellow and black color scheme of the profile in front of him, but he had to admit that at least Balthazar had picked a good picture.
Dean digs into his own meal, chewing noisily next to Castiel’s elbow. In their entire acquaintance, Castiel has always known Dean to be comfortable in any setting. Technically, as a mercenary, his sword is for sale to the highest bidder, but Castiel has never known him to take any kind of military contract. He will sometimes disappear for months at a time, but he always comes back, willing to take a contract from the Society for what is surely a lower price than he could earn with his sword. Dean is the type that is at ease everywhere, and has never met a stranger. He certainly charmed Castiel when they met; the brothers were just a pair of ragged boys when he opened the Bunker door to them that fateful day. Dean’s grown into an incredibly beautiful young man, the sun streaking gold in his hair and dotting freckles across his cheeks. He’s always seemed so carefree on the surface, though the circumstances of his arrival in Lebanon are a deep mystery that belie some possible tragic or unsavory history.
Three months. Three months to complete his research and collect enough data to write his thesis. Surely that would be enough time. A few interviews with a handful of omegas and he would have enough material for his narrative research.
will still be there in a week or two or more. But Dean knows better. An omega without his sense of smell is vulnerable, weak . . .
She blocked his path to the door, and Castiel growled at her. “Get out of my way,” he hissed. His omega was out there alone, he needed to be caught, sheltered,
It might be vaguely blasphemous, but it isn’t an exaggeration to say that Castiel knows every hair on Dean Winchester’s head.
The doctors had said that the first knotted orgasm was the one that contained the most sperm, so any secondary (or tertiary, or whatever four or more might be) orgasms wouldn’t be particularly helpful. It felt good, though, to have Dean’s inner muscles squeezing his cock as Dean’s arousal fell and his heat wave was sated. He couldn’t help but let his fingers wander absently over Dean’s lower abdomen, wondering if they might have succeeded this time.
He was right on the verge of calling when the lock rattled and the front door swung open, admitting a rush of wind and snow, and a very frosty Cas laden with several full reusable grocery bags. Dean rushed toward him and grabbed a few bags so Cas could turn and shut the door.
“Jo lived with them then, too. Ellen’s daughter. She’s a blacksmith out in Carthage, now. Does a good business; her swords are imbued with her magic. They don’t dull or chip.”
With that, Castiel had agreed to meet a stranger for no reason that was clear to him at the moment. He hoped he wasn’t getting himself into any more trouble. He had to finish his project, and he doubted Naomi would let him finish it from prison.
A thrill runs through Castiel as he struggles to his knees to throw his arms around Dean and kiss him. “Really?” he asks. Dean leans over and blows out the candle before climbing into bed with Castiel. He arranges the blankets to his satisfaction before gathering Castiel up in his arms and spooning him. Castiel breathes in the scent of
Castiel ended the call and took a deep breath before bringing the email up onto his screen. It was from winchesterd@campbellfund.org. Castiel took a deep breath before opening it.
A general warning that omegas are thought of and treated as property. Sometimes it's not pretty, and we're into the part of the story where this becomes apparent. These are mostly issues that *will* be addressed in the narrative. If you have questions, please let me know!
Castiel awkwardly hitched his pants up around his waist as he stood to guide Dean to his room. He flipped the light on, hoping he’d managed to clean up his dirty clothes at least, then bent over his side table to rummage in the drawer.
Castiel scoops up the cards and shuffles. “Wanna keep playing?” he challenges. Dean arches an eyebrow.
up on his knees. They have a quiz on the next section of chapters in English tomorrow, and, yeah, okay, Castiel read it already, but a thorough re-read is essential to retention—
So, working lungs, working brain, beating heart . . . all of his limbs, if he’s accounting correctly for the areas that hurt the most.
It had been a long time since Dean and Cas had gotten properly drunk, so Dean could be forgiven for forgetting his friend’s frankly
facetious,” he retorted, reaching for the last wine bottle. Cas’s warm, soft hand closed over his wrist. Dean’s heart was pounding in his ears at the gentle touch. It almost hurt to look back up at Cas, but Cas had his eyes closed, face pained.
Dean fought a yawn, blinking heavily against the glow of his laptop in the darkness. The clacking of his fingers on the keys sounded thunderously loud surrounded by the 3am silence. Typically, Dean wouldn’t have brought the laptop to bed, but with Adler breathing down his neck to finish this project and a possibility of extended leave somewhere in the not-so-distant future, he really needed to finish this report before he finally turned in for the night.
Castiel whined, pressing the heel of his hand against his cock, the base beginning to firm up in preparation for his knot. “What—what do you think about?” he dared. Dean groaned.
Cas is still watching him curiously as he crawls into his makeshift tent and curls up on his bedroll. He’s vaguely aware of Cas muttering spells to himself as he walks a large circle around the tent before he drops off into a dreamless sleep.
On top of that, his scent and Dean’s are swirling around them, mingling and blending into an intoxicating cocktail that goes straight to Castiel’s head. He’s floating by the time Dean pulls back, panting against Castiel’s lips.
It wasn’t until the Skype call tone had been ringing for a few minutes that Dean realized Sam might not be available to talk today. Fuck, what day even was it? Dean had stomped back into his dorm room in a much more determined haze than he’d left it. He went straight to his desk to open his laptop without even sparing a thought for his bed and called up Sam’s contact info. Dean had shed all of his winter outerwear, tossing it into a pile on his mattress, before he settled into his chair and it occurred to him that Sam might not pick up. A panicky sweat started on his forehead as he hovered over the “end call” button.
An awkward silence descends on all of them. Eventually, Charlie clears her throat and says, “Well, I, uh—I’m gonna go over there.”
“That’s understandable. Now, Dean, your blood work came back great, all normal levels which is excellent at this point.” Dean swallowed hard, but managed to keep his face neutral. “And Cas, your last semen analysis was good.”
“Oh yeah? Well, I think there is a need. I think you need to get your ass back in the kitchen and fix it!”
Dean fell through the open door, stumbling over his feet as Cas caught him by the shoulders. The alpha was trying to have as little contact with him as possible, which Dean both resented and felt grateful for. Cas propped him up against a nearby wall and rushed off.
, it read, and a phone number. There was nothing else scrawled on the paper in Gilda’s neat handwriting, and Cas had no idea what this would be for.
Suddenly Dean was drenched as the skies opened up into a frigid, pouring rain. He gasped in shock, but Cas grabbed his hand and said, “Come on!”
Dean jumped at the curse and the sound of the outer door slamming. He immediately abandoned his homework and went to check on Kevin.
“Hey, Charlie,” Dean said. Her eyes were nearly falling out of her head. “I, uh . . . I’m here for the . . . the thing.”
“Dammit, Dean,” she mutters, letting go of Castiel’s arm. “He got dealt a rough hand, Cas. Him and Sam both. I raised ‘em, they’re mine. But there’s . . . he’s got dark stuff in his past, I won’t lie. He thinks he’s gotta fix things he ain’t ever been responsible for and it ain’t my place to tell you. But I will tell you this, fancy Archmage or not: you hurt him and I’ll kick your ass.”
“Yup, that’s me,” he says, grinning broadly and slapping Castiel’s hand on the way to an overly enthusiastic handshake. “Nice to meet you, man.”
“It was the middle of nowhere, small town, everybody kept to themselves. Had a couple of regulars that knew, but they kept it a secret. Only sometimes, strangers would pass through. I was on suppressants, used blockers, beta scented shampoo and soap. We thought I was safe.”
,” Dean groaned, his own come mixing with Cas’s between them. Dean thrust hard once, twice, three more times before final collapsing, panting, half on top of Cas.
“I fucked up. Made some stupid choices, didn’t see what was happening in front of me, made a deal to get myself out.”
Cas had gotten a part-time job at a café on campus for the break, since he wasn’t taking any classes. He started working early mornings, so he had to be at work at 5 am on weekdays to start baking and prep for the day. Which meant waking up at 4 am in order to get to work on time.
Dean must catch Castiel staring at his lips, because the corner of his mouth ticks up just slightly in the ghost of a smirk.
Dean tightens his grip on the notebook Billie left with him, hands slicking with sweat. She disappears with a blink, as though she was never there, but the notebook stays behind, clutched in Dean’s clammy hands. Shocked, at first, he just stares into the space she vacated.
One night, though, Cas woke up a little before his alarm. His body was getting used to the early wake-up call, which did not bode well for the next semester. He rolled over in the dark to check the time when he heard the unmistakable sound of Dean’s bed springs creaking. Cas stilled for a moment, waiting to see if he’d disturbed his roommate, when suddenly Dean spoke.
As Dean’s heat wore on, Castiel became acclimated to his scent. By the third day, Castiel was able to venture into different parts of the house without experiencing rut-like symptoms (early on, Gabriel had mentioned that perhaps he should have kept taking his suppressants, which earned him a steely glare). Charlie and Gabriel had coordinated a complicated lie that excused Dean’s extended absence and put Castiel on the other side of the city (involving Hannah in a way that Castiel had hoped to avoid). In fact, for now the house was quiet in a way that felt very much like the calm before the storm.
When Dean leaned in to kiss him, it was soft to the point of aching. Castiel’s heart hammered against his ribs as Dean’s fingers trailed lightly over Castiel’s jaw. The kiss was a balm, a sigh, easing the tightness in Castiel’s chest that he didn’t even realize was there.
“‘Synthetic alpha pheromone,’” he read off the label. He scrambled to turn the tube over to read the instructions. He pulled the knot from his ass and wiped it clean on the sheet before coating it with the gel from the tube.
Somewhere around the fourth round of the other guys trying to shoot each other with more and more creative weaponry, Gabriel convinces Castiel to drink a beer. It’s hardly his first one, but it still feels strange to sit in an unfamiliar apartment and impair his judgement.
He needed to delete it. Nerves getting the better of him, he swiped his phone from the charger and opened the app. There were a number of profiles displaying as less than two hundred feet from him, but he ignored them to flip through the screens to find a way to deactivate his profile. He’d managed to find the button to edit when his phone flashed with a notification. Someone had messaged him.
The air wavered in the silence. Castiel couldn’t bring himself to look anywhere else, but Dean’s eyes darted around the office, occasionally skipping over Cas’s eyes. He needed Dean to leave; it was getting difficult to breathe around his scent, filling the room as it was. Cas opened his mouth to say so, but then Dean blurted, “I fixed cars!”
“I’m promised to an executive at Roman Industries,” said a particularly bold female omega while her friends stared at her, scandalized. “If you don’t think they can figure out a simple code and find out what I said, you’re an idiot.”
Cas helped Jack learn to control his powers, while Sam taught Jack about humanity. They home-schooled him, trying to prepare Jack for anything the world may throw at him.
Once they were both steady on their feet, Dean began, rubbing the back of his neck, “Look, uh, about what you said-”
Sam tries not to think about that fight they had, Dean angrier than Sam had seen in a long time. About all the hurt and grief and fear hidden under that anger.
Over time adjustments are made to make this space into his space. Ultimately it ends up reminiscent of the library in the bunker; more shelf space, clean lines of uniform books rather than a hodgepodge of lore, but it feels like home.
Dean wants to argue, wants to be able to comfort Sam, Eileen, Donna, Jody and the girls, the people who Dean has most impacted at some point during his life, but Jack’s right. That life is over, and knowing what his life is now would bring them more pain than comfort. “I know. I just needed to see them. To know that they’ll be okay.”
“As well as can be expected, given…” Cas trails off, not eager to discuss Dean’s death. “He’ll be alright. There are other hunters in the bunker, and Jack, he’s helping. Sam’s not alone.”
Sam glances in the rear-view mirror and lets out a mirthless laugh. “Yeah, uh, we’re pretty fucking far from okay.” Sam drags a hand down his face, collecting himself. “Look, I’m heading back now, I’m a few hours out. I can’t- See you soon.” Sam hangs up before Cas has a chance to respond. He wouldn’t be able to make it back in one piece if he had to go into it now, so Sam shuts that down, takes a breath, and pulls back onto the road.
“Sarah,” Cas said, greeting the stunning omega once again. She smiled tightly at him, and Cas’s own smile faltered. The last time they’d met, she had been warning him away from Dean. He hadn’t managed to keep his distance very well since then, but he was trying now. Even if there was a voice in the back of his head begging him to rescue Dean from Michael . . .
“Your benefactor has it covered. You’ll charge everything to an account for him. Here,” Crowley said, handing a crisp manila envelope across the desk. “All of the information you need about where to go is in there. Anything else?”
“One night, while his two eldest sons were hunting alone in the thickest part of the wood, they were set upon by a large pack of hounds, so big and vicious that the few survivors of the attack claimed they had to be hellhounds. The brothers were torn apart; there was nothing left to bring back to the father. That night, a dark cloud gathered over the entire valley, turning every field barren and every forest dark and impassable, trapping the residents in their homes and isolating it from outside help. By the time anyone discovered what had happened, the entire valley was dead. Just, gone, Wiped off the map. All that was left was a big, blank smudge on the map.”
The caviar appetizer shows up, so then at least there’s food, but when Dean gestures to Castiel to dig in, he shakes his head politely.
“Later,” Cas said. His breath hitched as he fisted his cock faster under the covers, voice quavering with the movement. “Fuck, Dean—”
, but with her family, her hands are tied, you know? So I thought, maybe there are other Vinehall omegas that want to be part of this but
“Fuck, I wanna scent you again. Jack—he said . . . Well, never mind. That’s not . . . I’m no good, Cas. No good.”
Castiel tried to relax as Dean circled his hole with one slick finger, teasing the nerve endings as Castiel moaned and pressed his ass up in the air and his face into the mattress. Dean dipped the tip of his finger into his entrance and swore again.
Gilda chewed on her lip, taking the card slowly and watching Castiel with curiosity. “Mr. Novak, what makes an alpha such as yourself pursue this kind of work?” Cas was taken aback and eyed her just as curiously.
Eventually, Dean came back into the room with two open bottles of beer; he offered one to Cas before he took a long sip. The silence stretched out between them until Dean huffed a laugh. “Still an awkward son of a bitch, huh?”
Cas moans, pressing in again. This time, Dean feels the head of Cas’s cock squeeze past the first ring of muscle, and they groan together. Dean is stretched impossibly wide, nerve endings on fire at the magnificent burn, and there’s still the rest of Cas’s length to go. And his knot; how is Dean going to take his knot?
.” Dean tried to thrust into Cas’s mouth, but Cas held his hips gently, swallowing and bobbing on his cock to draw more frantic moans from him.
He used the Vinehall blockers like a shield, even more than usual, as he dressed in their trappings and went about his day. His professors and classmates didn’t seem to notice, luckily, but Dean kept his head down just in case. It wouldn’t be worth it to attract unneeded attention.
The wall Dean put up between the two of them has never felt more fragile as the long pause that follows. Cas deserves to know. He
Dean doesn’t say anything, just lays down his cards and raises his eyebrow. Castiel’s mouth is suddenly very dry. He stands, fingers on the waistband of his boxers, still damp from both his slick and his steadily dripping cock, but hesitates.
“Good, you’re finally awake,” Sam had said before promptly smacking him with a large book. “Don’t bitch, it’s only ‘cause you’re in a hospital bed that I didn’t punch you in the face.”
Now, Dean was shoving the silicone cock into his ass as hard as he could, slamming it into his prostate with laser precision. Slick coated his hand, his legs, his junk, the bed, the spot on the floor where he’d tried riding the thing . . . Now, he was on his back, legs up the wall, curling over himself as his fist flew over his cock.
Dean laughed again, and the clouds that had covered his eyes seemed to recede a little. Castiel’s inner alpha was pleased at making the omega laugh, chanting at him to make it happen again. Dean, for his part, did move closer and perched on the very edge of the bench. Clearly he’d taken the Vinehall etiquette lessons for “how to sit as though you weigh nothing” to heart. Castiel turned to gather his notebook when a breeze kicked up again, and this time Castiel knew he wasn’t mistaken.
Dean tried to concentrate on the firm hold around him rather than the laughing, pompous face of the alpha in front of him, but blood was rushing through his ears and he was pretty sure he was going to snap again. He managed to let himself get carried away from the jail, though, and back to Cas’s ugly car. He even climbed into the back seat under his own steam. To his dismay, though, Cas climbed into the back seat with him instead of the front as Hannah got behind the wheel.
No, he wasn’t exactly horny. His own orgasm hardly mattered at all. He groaned again as he eased a third finger into himself. His hole fluttered and clenched, searching for a knot.
“We’re going to stay here tonight?” he asks. Dean nods, taking off his weapons and checking them before laying them all out on the table. “Oh. I suppose I can take the bedroll.” Dean looks up sharply at him.
“I’m not talking about this strange vendetta you seem to have. I’m talking about your career and your future. Come home, Castiel.”
Dean looks over and regards him for a moment. The longer he looks, the more Castiel feels like he’s being
behind him as he went. Cas stomped on his inner alpha trying valiantly to rouse itself from the haze of suppressants to follow after him. Hannah stood and turned off the recorder.
And Castiel lets him, lets Dean gather him in his strong arms, one wrapping tight around his narrow waist, the other scooping up between his shoulder blades, and Castiel wraps his own around Dean’s sturdy shoulders. Castiel buries his face in Dean’s neck, right at the joint where his scent is strongest and breathes deeply. He shudders in Dean’s hold, a fresh rush of slick running from him, staining the air with its scent. Dean groans against him, and Castiel decides.
Cas’s limbs weighed him down as he sipped at the water. How much should he reveal to Gabriel? He couldn’t, wouldn’t, betray Dean’s confidences, as few as they were. Gabriel continued to stare. Cas spoke to his water glass.
“Usually the talking comes first, Cas, but since you said ‘later’ . . .” Dean ducked his head, blush spreading across his cheeks. “It’s gonna be a good talk, though, right?” he asked, remarkably sheepish for someone who had just had his hand wrapped around Cas’s dick. Cas nodded, linking his fingers through Dean’s clean hand, despite the awkward angle.
“I didn’t know there was ownership on benches in the quad,” he replied, though he gathered his notebook up. Dean noticed a stack of flyers next to him.
And then, it happens. Castiel had a good hand, a full house, but Dean ended up, impossibly, with a royal flush.
Shit, a heat. Dean hadn’t thought about that. It took some time for suppressants to work their way completely out of the system, but he would most likely be getting a heat soon. His last shot was nearly three months ago, so it couldn’t be more than a couple of weeks until the burning, needy agony wracked his body again.
Dean blushed. He’d been trying to avoid thinking about the school too much, so yeah, he hadn’t read the handbook. He wasn’t going to let this asshole know that, though. He didn’t say anything as he moved to sit down, but stopped when Crowley put up a hand to stop him. Crowley gave him a long, appraising look, bordering on uncomfortable. Dean fidgeted a little, feeling like he was drowning in his blockers again. After a few moments, Crowley nodded and gestured to the chair again.
