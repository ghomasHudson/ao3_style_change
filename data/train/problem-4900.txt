Trigger Warning: Domestic Violence and mentions of past abuse
Here's the second chapter I promised! NSFW! Mind the tags. Enjoy!
Dean arrives at the hospital fairly quickly. He wasn’t speeding
Castiel instinctively takes a step back as the other man throws his rage at him.
“Oh, you built that team all right,” he sneers. “I’ve been waiting for you since time began,” he mocks. “Nice line. Like I’ve never heard it before.”
Castiel stirs the soup with his spoon. He goes for a bite, thinks better of it, and puts the bowl on the nearby table. He gets up, looking for his shoes.
“Now, now, Samantha. We do not kink shame. People enjoy what they enjoy. It is a perfect coincidence that I was ogling from behind a screen, the same man who saved my life. I will have to find a way to repay him. Perhaps he will take a refund for his special order and allow me to deliver it when I get out of here,” Castiel trails off.
Dean’s eyes widen, and he feels a little like a kid caught doing something he wasn’t supposed to be doing. He swallows hard, blinking a few times before letting out a breath and nodding to confirm the woman’s accusation. “Yeah,” he manages softly.
Dean strolls into the station, making his way through the lobby. Next, into the kitchen, and finally through the dayroom, with his bag slung over his shoulder. He lets out a sharp whistle as he sets the box down on the table in the middle of the room. “Yo, breakfast, guys!” He yells, setting his stuff down next to the table before giving his mug a refill and begins straightening up the area and putting things away from the night before. He likes to keep busy, in general. Still, Dean doesn’t want the other guys thinking he’s a slacker or not a team player, he worked his ass off for this job, and he was going to continue to do just that, so, he busies himself with the morning chores.
“Cas, it’s okay. You didn’t know what was going to happen. I’m happy that it wasn’t painful. Truthfully, I wouldn’t mind another ride on that.” Dean teases.
Sam bows his head lower, waiting, hoping that Castiel will not forsake him in his time of need. Although they have never been close like he is with Dean, Sam would do whatever he could for the angel, anytime he needed him.
Dean shakes his head, picking up his utensils. “Nothing,” he says, cutting off a piece of his steak. “I just like you,” Dean says, biting off the chunk of meat. He licks the extra juice off his lips, enjoying the flavor.
“Dean…” Castiel growls, a second before he comes deep inside of him. Blue light flashes bright within the room, causing the lightbulbs to shatter, and he pulls Dean to him, trying to protect him from the falling glass.
“It’s alright,” Dean grins. “I was wondering if you guys have any new release DVDs in stock,” he asks, leaning forward on the counter.
“I don’t know how many times I’m going to have to apologize for my actions tonight, but know that I’m doing this because I care about you.” Castiel pushes in, closer to Dean, his face right in front of the other man’s. Placing his hands on either side of Dean’s face, he holds Dean’s head still, willing Dean, through force, not to fight against his hold. Castiel’s blue eyes fill Dean’s vision, and a tingling begins in his brain.
!” Dean yells in the man’s face. “You don’t know what you do to me, what you
Castiel groans with the intimate touch, “Dean, are you sure, this isn’t like us.”
Dean’s hand around Castiel’s throat makes it a little challenging to get away, and with him so close, Castiel can’t fight back or else take the chance of hurting Dean. Luckily, Castiel didn’t come here without a plan, and Dean fell right into his trap.
“But Dean, I don’t. I’ve been asking you to tell me. I don’t understand the anger you have right now. Sam says you’ve been acting strange all morning.” Castiel follows Dean closer to the bed, effectively trapping Dean against the nightstand and the two beds. “Please, Dean… talk to me. I might be able to help,” Castiel begs.
Not going to lie, I was stalling on this chapter. I wasn't ready to post it yet. I hope you can forgive me. Here is the last chapter, enjoy.
Crowley raises an eyebrow.
Dean chuckles and smirks to himself as he watches Castiel. “I hope you like it. I wasn’t sure what to get,” he admits, taking a sip of coffee.
Dean’s blush deepens as he smiles at Castiel, his eyes shining. “Uh, yeah, what he said…” Dean shakes his head as he wets his lips before bringing his beer to his mouth. “Jesus. Cas, that was something,” he smiles, biting his bottom lip as his eyes cloud over, running over the memory in his mind.
Dean scrapes away part of the trap, standing quickly; if Crowley acts like the bastard he is and does something stupid. He may be almost naked, but Dean knows he could still kick the demon’s ass. Without realizing it, he places himself between Castiel and Crowley, subconsciously wanting to protect the angel from any kind of danger. “Okay, it’s done, now go! I have some business to attend to.” Dean threatens.
Dean clears his throat and shakes his head. “No,” he manages to rasp, taking in a breath as he feels a tingle of excitement shoot up his spine.
” Castiel yells, his chest painted with a soft blush and his cheeks a beautiful rose. “Dean,” he says, his voice but a whisper as his body shudders with pleasure. “More,” he begs. “Deeper,” Castiel whines.
"Boss, you have never wanted someone like I saw how you wanted him," Samantha mentions, eyes on the road. "I am rooting for you. I really hope the two of you hit it off. I also hope he's into guys. It's been some time since you've had a date, too," she jabs, a smirk on her lips.
Next is the clothes. Something comfortable and loose. Most of the clothes Dean has will probably be semi-loose on the guy, he thinks to himself. Castiel’s employee was right in saying they were about the same size, but from what Dean had noticed, Castiel was leaner with a lithe runner's build. He shakes his head, clearing his thoughts, as he picks out a pair of soft grey sweats and an older, soft AC/DC t-shirt and tosses them in the back with a pair of fresh boxers and socks. Dean bites his lip before wetting them. Now or never, Winchester. He thinks to himself as he zips the bag up and grabs his things, mentally preparing for the range of possibilities awaiting him at the hospital.
Crossing the field as quickly as he can, Dean reaches the car and gently lays Castiel’s body across the backseat of the Impala. He emerges, wiping his forehead with his arm, and shuts the door, not wanting to make eye contact with Sam. He turns quickly to the driver’s door, “Let’s go.” He says softly to Sam, feeling like all the life had been drained from his body. He opens the door and slides in, slamming the door shut.
“Come on, Cas. Don’t be like that,” Dean grumbles at the angel, “and don’t slam the door!!!! Baby is fragile!” Dean moves around to the passenger side, “It’s okay, he didn’t mean it,” Dean coddles the car, wiping the side panel. Standing straight, Dean also surveys the surroundings. “Hey, about how long do you think Sam’s been gone?” Dean moves to Castiel’s side, trying to look through the windows from their current position near the car.
“Fuck,” Dean mumbles under his breath, nearly sitting on the edge of his seat. He closely watches the door, not taking his eyes on it. “Come on,” he whispers to himself.
"Mr. Novak?" The doctor asks, and Castiel looks up from the bed. "Ah, good. You're awake. I have some good news. Your oxygen levels are normal again, so we're going to discharge you. Now, I still need you to take it easy. If you exercise, you're going to have to ease back into it. Your lungs are still healing. We are going to schedule a follow-up with your regular doctor in six months," the doctor explains. He gives Castiel a few other rules about sleeping and a warning about possible stressors, and a therapist's phone number.
“Experimenting is the spice of life, Dean,” Castiel whispers, his eyes glancing at the other man’s mouth, then back to his eyes. He lifts the lid and swipes a piece of green pepper out of the pan. Replacing the cover, he blows on the spear, then his pink tongue darts out, testing the temperature. “Here, try,” Castiel offers.
“Oh yeah?” Dean grins back and wiggles his eyebrows a bit, feeling more and more at ease around Castiel. He wets his lips, wondering where the night was angling to take him.
Sam catches the cap effortlessly, grinning at his brother’s shock. He leans in a little closer, looking suddenly serious. “So, are there any special angel techniques?” Sam’s eyes give away how curious he is about the subject.
“Yeah, Boss, he’s real. You’ll never believe who it is. Dean Winchester. The perv with the tentacle porn,” Samantha giggles.
"I'll be fine. You might like to know that Dean gave me his phone number and told me that he would provide for me if I needed anything. What a gentleman, huh?" Castiel laughs as he pushes the door open. He grabs the bag from the floorboard and waves before closing the door. Fishing his keys out, he wanders up the walk to his door. He turns to Samantha, still waiting in her car, and shoos her off. She shakes her head but does as he asks. She pulls away and down the street, waving out her window. Castiel smiles and unlocks the door, stepping over the threshold.
“I mean, Dean. I don’t think he knew how you felt about him. Was he surprised when you … reciprocated… your feelings for him? I mean, did you? God, Dean, please tell me you didn’t leave the poor angel hanging… wait…. the scratches on the table. Who…?” Sam’s eyes get wide for a moment, the implications running wild in his mind.
Allowing himself one small chuckle, Dean takes a seat across Aaron at the dining table and takes a sip of his coffee. It wasn’t just the work that he liked, he genuinely enjoyed his crewmates, and they made the job that much more enjoyable and worthwhile.
“Dean! This is serious! I took you by force. I feel terrible.” Castiel looks at Dean, his blue eyes tortured.
Dean chuckles, setting the first on a plate, and does as he’s told with a smirk. “Here you go,” he offers.
to ME!” He runs his hands over his face. “How could you do this?” Dean whispers into his hands, choking back another growl.
“You’re such a gentle lover, Dean,” Castiel whispers, his voice scratchy and rough. He runs his hands over the other man’s face, a tiny grin pulling at his lips. His eyes search Dean’s, finding contentment in the moment between them.
Dean sits on the edge of the bed, grabbing a towel. He begins cleaning Castiel. Dean looks over Castiel’s body, now seemingly healed. He rubs his hand over his hair, meeting Castiel’s eyes. “What just happened? Are you okay, Cas?” His eyes are full of concern.
“Why are you looking at me like that, Dean? What kind of reaction did you think you were going to get from me?” Sam smiles at his brother, taking a drink of his own beer.
Castiel leans in the embrace and rests his head on Dean’s shoulder. He smells good. His tears have finally stopped. Castiel drops the kitchen towel and takes the man’s hand in his. He brings it to his lips and rests it there.
Dean enters the library with a broad, crooked smirk on his face as he eyes Sam still at the table, reading through more lore books. “Hey, Sammy.” He crosses the room, sitting across from Sam. Dean grabs the whiskey bottle and glass he left on the table and pours a hearty helping.
“DEAN!!!!”
“Well… fuck me.” Dean blurts out.
Sam gives Dean the directions, the lights of the Impala bouncing along the grassy field. “Over there, Dean,” Sam points to a spot in the corner of the area. There is black smoke coming from a charred hole in the ground. “Jesus, Dean…” Sam whispers.
Castiel shakes his head, patting Dean on the shoulder. “I want you out of here. I want us to go home… together.” He smiles at Dean again, making the other man blush slightly at the weighted promise.
Dean’s eyes Sam seeing he now had headphones in. His gaze hardens once again as he looks back to Castiel. “Cut the shit, Cas,” he sighs, sitting down on the bed before rubbing his face with his hands. “There’s nothing to talk about, is there?” Dean smirks, looking at Castiel, silently challenging him.
Sighing in frustration, Dean pulls himself to his feet from the table. “Can you just drop it, so we just focus on the case, Sam?” He pleads, unsure how to answer Sam’s questions, realizing how hypocritical the words sound when they pass over his lips. “These bastards took you and didn’t so much as touch you. Do you think they’re trying to create more vamps?” He inquires, walking over to Sam as he reaches out for the broom. “Here, I’ll take care of it. Get some shut-eye. We’re gonna need to be on this in a few hours,” Dean says as a seriousness washes over his face.
“I DON’T FULLY UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF, SAM,” Dean snaps, the words coming harsher than he intends. He sighs, getting up walking over to his duffel bag before grabbing his clothing. Looking up at his brother with an apologetic look. “I’m just going to go to sleep,” he says softly as he crosses the room into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.
Dean exits the car in an attempt to chase after Castiel. His eyes widen as he watches Castiel disappear as he calls out to him, his voice going hoarse. Dean starts for the opening in the ground and stops suddenly as he nears it hearing an eruption below the damp earth’s surface. Dean drops to his knees. “No, no, no…” he whispers to himself. Taking a few ragged breaths in an attempt to pull himself together, Dean stands up quickly and sprints back to the Impala. There, he quickly retrieves a machete and syringe of dead man’s blood before making his way back over to the entrance.
“That power that you felt between the two of you… the draw… I found the cause of it. You guys, vampires mate for life… and you two just mated…” Sam shakes his head, not believing what has just happened.
“You have no idea where he is, don’t you?” His last words are less a question than a statement.
“Yeah, it is. I found it at some tiny store when I was on my way back from a convention. I suppose I was saving it for something special,” Castiel says, looking up at Dean. “I, uh…” he trails off, getting lost in the green eyes before him.
Samantha scoffs as she turns on Dean. “Listen, my name is not important. I am just the messenger. Castiel is the name you must remember, like it’s the last word in the world, and you’re the last dictionary. He saw you place that order the other day. My boss was working in the back and happened to see you on the shoplifting camera. I have never seen him so worked up about someone before,” Samantha shakes her head, smiling to herself. “The two of you have to become friends,” she says. “Or something,” she adds under her breath.
,” he begs.
Dean spins around at the sound of Castiel’s voice. He sets his mug on the counter. His eyes widen in shock that Castiel heard him and appeared so quickly.
“As you know, there are ways around that if we have a human vessel,” Castiel turns to Dean. “So, I think you’re safe from me impregnating you, as I would hope, considering how much of my seed I have deposited inside of you the past few days.” Castiel’s eyes twinkle at Dean.
Castiel gets to his feet and goes to the kitchen. He rummages in the top drawer and quickly finds pliers, then walks back to Dean and crouches.
He swipes at the screen on his phone and opens a new text message. Typing in Samantha’s phone number, he sends off a quick message.
“Oh, what the hell?” Dean gripes, looking at the food on the stove. Putting a finger in, the temperature a little warm, but edible. “I really hope the power comes back on, or we’re going to have to snuggle for warmth, Cas,” he smiles. Walking around the couch, Dean hands the angel a bowl of tomato vegetable soup. “Are you hungry?” Sitting next to Castiel on the sofa, he takes a moment to see that Castiel is looking a little rough around the edges. Dean wants to help him, but with the man’s mood, Dean knows that there isn’t much he can do until Castiel wants to let him in.
Castiel nods his head, understanding completely. Sometimes it’s tough for him to get to the laundromat too, but he always keeps his undergarments ready. “Okay, Dean, where were we?” Castiel asks, his face stoic. He again picks up the scissors and carefully cuts down the other leg. The jeans fall away from Dean’s body completely.
Dean puts the bacon back into the fridge, stomping over to the door. Throwing it wide, he’s almost bowled over by the strong winds and swirling snow. He struggles to shut the door again, “Well, I’m not going out there,” he proclaims. “What are we going to do now, Cas?” He turns his gaze to the moody angel on the couch. Watching him still have problems with his shoes, Dean wanders over to his side. “Can I help you?” He offers.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You saw me naked. It’s only fair that I do, too,” Castiel says to buy himself some time.
Dean makes a break from the motel, running towards some unknown destination. Any place to get some distance between him and Sam. He didn’t want to take the chance to stay and possibly kill him, especially when he could feel the vampiric change already corrupting his mind.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel leans over Dean, putting one hand on his shoulder as he presses him back onto the mattress. “It seems we were interrupted, but not this time.” Castiel grabs the towel and throws it further down the bed, smiling at the elder Winchester. “You are indeed glorious, Dean. I wonder how you taste,” Castiel licks his lips again, dropping his head to Dean’s chest, leaving one long wet trail from his tongue.
Dean watches Sam breach the ground and relaxes slightly before looking back at Castiel. Dean feels concern wash over him again as his eyes look over Castiel’s body. “What the fuck were you thinking?” He snaps at the angel as his eyes narrow.
Dean grins, watching Castiel work, letting out a low chuckle. His eyes follow the other man’s fluid and precise movements, and he’s almost hypnotized. His eyes flutter closed at the aroma of the food already filling the space. “That smells amazing,” he comments.
“Dean. I’m back,” Castiel says, his voice low and calming. “I’m sorry that I have kept you in this state. Unfortunately, things are not going to get any easier tonight. I only hope you will not hate me when it is all done.” Castiel pulls a rolling table closer to Dean and places the bowl on top of it. He puts the washcloth into the warm water, turning to Dean. “I’m, uhhhh… going to remove those dirty clothes now.”
“Right,” he says, pushing off the counter. “Any request? Allergies?” He asks, raising a brow.
“Why are you being like this?” he asked, almost a whisper.
Was this kid seriously trying to give him dating advice? Was he that obviously tense and worked up over Castiel? Dean sighs and nods, taking out his wallet and sliding his debit card through. The kid hands over the receipt as he loads the bags back into the cart. After he double-checks all of his bags, he pushes towards the exit.
“Dean, did you just give us your Google review of your favorite sex shop?” Aaron deadpans.
Dean turns the volume back down and looks in the direction of the commotion. He bites his lip, and before he can control his legs, he’s approaching the door and knocks softly. “Cas, you alright?” He calls through the door.
“I love you, too!”
Dean groans, tossing his head back. “Ugh... what’s with all the questions, Sam?” He whines, looking down at this watch again. “Where is the damn pizza?” He asks, placing a hand over his growling stomach. He glances at Castiel, looking him over before settling on his eyes, “You feeling okay still?” He asks.
The small room continues to fill with steam from the running shower and begins creating a layer of sweat on Dean’s already warm skin. His breathing quickens as Castiel speaks. A low moan escaping his throat as he feels Castiel grip him. Dean shuts his eyes tightly in an attempt to calm his breathing. Sighing softly at Castiel’s words, he feels a frustration growing inside of him. Dean opens his eyes again, once more meeting Castiel’s lust blown gaze. Dragging his hands back to Castiel’s face, he pulls his mouth forward to meet his own. “Shut. Up.” Dean growls into Castiel’s mouth as he kisses him hungrily. He begins to pump himself into Cas’s warm hand as he bites down on Cas’s bottom lip, tugging gently.
Castiel smiles down at the screen, nodding. He realizes that she can’t see that, so he sends another text.
Dean’s head falls back against the door as Castiel’s leg presses into him, causing his hips to buck forward, grinding his growing erection into Castiel. In reflex, his hands grab onto Castiel’s arms, gripping the material of his trench coat tightly to steady himself. “Casss…” The name hissed out of his mouth quickly, as though it had many times before.
Heading back into his bedroom, Castiel looks through the closet for some clothes. The phone store trip shouldn't be difficult, especially when he's looking forward to getting a new phone anyway. The call after getting home will be more challenging. Castiel hated dealing with professional stuff. If he could hire someone to manage that part of the business, he would, but he couldn't see spending a lot of cash now just to not deal with some red tape. Castiel grumbles as he pulls off his shirt and slicks his pits up with deodorant. Suiting up in a blue button-up and a pair of tight-fitting jeans, he draws on his shoes and enters the garage.
“I let you into my house, didn’t I?” Castiel retorts, moving back a smidge to let Dean through. As the other man passes, Castiel follows behind, closing the door. “I’m sure whatever you bought will be delicious and fun to make,” he says, his voice carrying in the room.
easier on me?” He growls, walking back over to Castiel, and places a hand on his cheek as Dean’s face and voice softens. “Don’t ever do that to me again.” He stares into Castiel’s blue eyes, searching for understanding. “I thought I lost both of you, and then you just disappeared without saying anything.” He sighs, walking back over to the table and sitting down before taking a drink of coffee from his mug.
“I- really?” Dean’s heart pounds noisily against his rib cage, and he feels his cock twitch in interest. He sucks in a breath as he bites down on his bottom lip to stifle a moan at the thought.
The ride home seems shorter than the ride to the firehouse. Stepping into the kitchen from the garage, Castiel feels a headache already starting. Taking a deep breath, he makes a cup of coffee in his Keurig and brings it with him to the table as he reads over the report.
“There should be hot water left,” he says, hoping to sound normal.
“Back in black, I hit the sack. I've been too long. I'm gla -”
Dean growls as he slaps Sam’s hand away. “Don’t touch him.” He quickly wipes the wetness at his cheeks with the back of his hands. Dean inhales deeply, turning his attention back to Castiel before speaking again to Sam. “Grab the machete and head back to the car,” he says quietly. “I’ll carry him up behind you.”
“I’m going to assume that Samantha gave you my address. I know I didn’t,” Castiel mumbles, closing the door behind him. He turns around, slipping past Dean, and starts to pick up the random items scattered around the room. “I’m sorry for the mess. Had I known you were coming by, I would have been prepared for company,” he shrugs again, righting a blanket.
“Thanks a bunch,” Dean smirks, putting the receipt and his debit card back into his wallet.
“You sure about that, Boss-man?” Samantha asks, looking around the store. “I could clean or something if you need me to. There is a bit of a mess under the register here,” she finishes, smiling.
Dean laughs, getting a little more accustomed to Castiel’s humor. It still causes him to blush furiously, though, as he crosses the space to the island and grabs the package of buns, unties it holding it out to Castiel. “My buns,” he grins.
Castiel’s eyes widen, and his nostrils flare. “Meet me in the bathroom in two minutes, right after they bring the next course. We won’t have a lot of time, but I don’t think I’ll need it,” Castiel says, then stands abruptly, headed for the restrooms.
“You should go to bed. I will give you some space.”
“It’s happened before,” Castiel whispers, keeping his eyes on the table.
with another man.
Dean touches the angel’s fingers with his own as he lets him dry his own hair. “Okay, Cas,” Dean walks over to the fire, stripping off his wet shirt, hanging it on the mantel. He puts his hands out to the fire then bends down to remove his boots and socks, also hanging his socks up. Dean stands in front of the fire, down to his wet jeans, his back to the angel. He continues to rub his hands together, getting them warmer. Enjoying the heat of the fire, he begins to hum ‘Stairway to Heaven’.
Samantha watches as her boss works out whatever it is in his brain. “You’re going to be just fine, sir. Just be your usual helpful and sassy self, and you’ll have him eating out of the palm of your hand… or maybe that should be your lap?” She chuckles and looks at the man with glistening eyes. “I am extremely grateful that Dean pulled you from that building. Working for you has changed my life, Castiel. I don’t know where I would be without you. If bringing you and Dean together is the most I can do for now, then I hope on all the hopes that this works out. Gawds, I hope he’s gay,” Samantha wishes into the room and is startled when Castiel laughs loud.
“That sounds responsible,” Dean smiles, finding the closest surface to lean against it and crosses his arms over his chest.
“Everything okay there, stud?” Castiel says, placing the bag next to the other. He begins to take the items out, setting them aside. Moving confidently in the kitchen, Castiel grabs the utensils he needs and the cutting board. He crosses over to the sink and washes his hands thoroughly. “Do you really use your microwave that much?” Castiel asks when he returns to stand next to Dean. Grabbing the peppers, he chops them into medium sided spears.
Castiel holds the door open for Dean, putting his hand on the small of his back. “I always open the door for the bottom,” he cracks, laughing low.
Castiel jumps when the prayer reaches him.
The room is dark, and feeling incredibly warm, Dean comes awake, arms and legs tangled with someone else. Turning his head, he’s surprised to see the sleeping angel next to him, he tries not to move too much, but Castiel opens his eyes and smiles. “Good Morning, Dean. How are you feeling?” The angel slowly pulls his arms back from Dean’s chest and untangles his legs.
Castiel looked. “Goddammit,” Dean mumbles to himself. He wipes his face before grabbing both duffel bags and making his way out of the door. Dean glances one last time at the kitchenette table, Castiel’s words and confession of love echo in his ear. He inhales deeply before exiting the room and making his way to the trunk, placing the duffel bags in gently.
Castiel stares into Dean’s green eyes, savoring the closeness between the two of them. Even with Dean as angry as he is, the warmth of his body calls to Castiel’s passion, and he has some difficulty hiding it. Luckily the younger Winchester is standing behind him. Castiel locks down his emotions after a moment. The glint in his eye returning to the dull, bored look that he likes to wear. “Anything for you,” Castiel says, the message all for Dean, though.
Castiel sighs. The silent treatment has its limit, and the quicker they can get this over with, the quicker they can be back home.  He crouches down to get a closer look at the snow.  Flurries land on his dark hair.
Dean’s eyes flicker shut again as a shaky breath escapes him. He eases his grip but picks the speed up as his hips thrust forward. “Ugh, you know,” he sighs. “It’s not fair that I’m the only naked one,” he mentions, arching a brow as he meets the heated blue gaze again.
Dean watches Castiel and can not fathom why Castiel is seemingly single, let alone have any interest in him. Dean’s jaw falls open involuntarily as his eyes widen, and pupils dilate.
Dean pulls out the parking lot swiftly, carefully following Castiel’s directions. He glances over at Castiel as he drives and clears his throat. “How did this happen, Cas?” Dean asks, his voice heavy with anger.
“What fun is it if there isn’t an element of danger?” Castiel shrugs. “It’s okay. I shouldn’t haven’t put you in that situation anyway. I might be into it, but I can’t assume that you would be. Plus, you’re a public servant, got a reputation to uphold and all,” he says and leans forward, finishing off the bottle of wine. Grabbing up the piece of eel, he nods to the fish. “This is eel, my favorite,” he places it in his mouth, and his eyes flutter at the first bite.
“I think what he’s trying to say is that I touched him with my angel grace and brought him to orgasm,” Castiel interrupts, walking into the room, wearing Dean’s t-shirt and sweatpants. He eyes the brothers as they talk about how Dean had sex with him. “Would that be a correct assumption, Dean?” Castiel turns his gaze to the elder brother, taking a seat at the table. He picks up the extra beer, licking his lips, and takes a deep drink from the bottle. He gently places it back on the table, his eyes locked with Dean’s. Slowly he turns his stare to Sam. “Do you have any more questions about how I pleasured your brother, Sam?”
“He’s gone, Cas. We were out hunting vampires and were overwhelmed. One of them got the drop on us and force-fed Dean vampire blood. He was changing, Cas. When we got back to the room, I tried to keep him here. I told him I could heal him…” Sam tries to continue, but a sob steals his words from him.
“Hmmm… That is a good question. Heavy petting and cock guzzling doesn’t work as a description, does it?” Castiel asks, leaning back in his chair, his fingers pulling away from Dean.
“I can assure you that I am fine, probably,” he huffs. “That’s the first time I’ve awoken on my porch,” Castiel says with finality.
“I will be gone. Cross my heart,” Crowley says as he makes the gesture on his chest.
More NSFW. In addition, blood, self-harm, and some rough interactions between Dean and Castiel.
“I don’t know,” Castiel squeezes out, “just, started,” he starts to feel his lungs burn, and he takes even more shallow breaths. “Please, hurry. It’s starting to hurt,” Castiel begs, laying his face to the cold cement. The phone falls out of his hand, the voice lost to the abyss that engulfs him. Darkness takes over, and Castiel passes out, trapped between fire and a blocked door.
“I Know! I just… fine. You’re right, I’m just being a little bitch about it. Let’s do this!” Dean braces for the first of the many cuts.
“So sweet. I think you’re going to have to do some homework first. At least before I let you, put any of you, inside of me,” Castiel replies, his eyes stormy with lust.
Dean falls back with a huff seeing Castiel is nowhere to be found. He rolls over and grabs his phone off the nightstand seeing no missed calls as he grumbles, tossing it back on. With a sigh, he pushes the covers off him and finds his way over to the coffee maker.
As Dean goes back to the kitchen, the angel finally gets his shoes untied.  He takes them off and moves on to his socks.  As he pulls, the right one tears.
) Castiel, but he already wants it to be an everyday thing. He feels a pang of sadness, knowing that it’s not a possibility right now. He lets out a soft sigh as he studies the other man’s features and brushes some hair out of Castiel’s face.
the sex shop that Dean went to. On more than one, two, or ten occasions. If Castiel really wanted to, he could find out every one of his orders.
Castiel hesitates a split-second. The moment ruined, he lowers his hand back down.  He feels a pang of sadness amidst the anger.
“Cas, I’m a grown man, I can clean myself,” Dean argues, angrily.
The server walks away with another smile. A man passes the table and heads in the direction of the restroom, disappearing behind the door.
Dean’s smile falters around the edges, “I know, Cas. I was just playin’ with you. I’ll go find another towel. Stay by the fire where it’s warm. I don’t know if you can catch a cold again, but let’s not test it,” Dean says over his shoulder as he takes the steps to the loft. Finding a closet, he opens the doors, finding some more towels inside and a large blanket. “Perfect,” Dean whispers to himself. Coming back down the stairs, he crosses the room, placing the large, warm blanket around Castiel’s shoulders. He wraps the material around Castiel, his arms wrapping around the other man’s form from behind. The front of Dean pressing fully against the back of Castiel for a moment. “This should keep you warm,” Dean says, close to Castiel’s ear. He walks away abruptly, the towel hanging over one of his shoulders. “I’ll be out in a moment,” Dean calls out, disappearing behind the bathroom door, shutting it behind him.

“I… uh…” Castiel shakes his head, looking at the table filled with books, and clears his throat. “No… nothing… I just thought it would be a good idea to share this information with you. I know you can take care of yourself, but remember that Death will take you and keep you. I don’t want to lose you prematurely. I’d like to hunt with you as long as I can, Dean. You teach me what it’s like to be human, even if I’m not. I don’t want to forget what these feelings are like. They mean everything to me, just like you do.” Castiel finally admits, looking at the elder Winchester, dead in his emerald green eyes.
“Here is your receipt, and if you have any questions, you can call the number on the top.” Samantha nods as she staples a copy of the man’s receipt to the contact form.
“You’ll always have a home with me, Cas.” Dean chokes out, tears immediately welling in his eyes.
Torn between giving in and holding on, the angel just focuses on his shoes anew.
“I’ll figure it out.  Go back to your food.”
“Personal space, yes.” Castiel breathes, pressing closer, feeling his hardened member push against Dean’s core. Burying his hands into Dean’s shirt. “Dean, I’ve tried this, personal space, that you value so much, but… I need to feel close to you. Closer than I’ve ever been. I don’t know. I fear that if I don’t act on this, I might not get another chance.” Castiel manages to get out, looking at Dean from under his long eyelashes. His legs still tangled with Dean’s as they lean against the kitchen counter, Sam still snoring away in bed nearby, no signs that he would be waking anytime soon.
“You disappoint me, Dean,” he says.
Castiel’s eyes widen, and tears quickly fill them. They fall down his cheeks, and he quickly wipes them away. “He’s real?” He whispers.
“I didn’t do anything.” Castiel raises his hands, “see?” Castiel’s eyes are wide. He looks over to the bowl of hot water. “Dean… I’m going to clean you now.”
was being ridiculous, right? Letting out a sigh, Dean grabs his toothbrush and toothpaste and starts brushing his teeth.
“I don’t see anyone else here,” Dean agrees. He sighs softly, wishing he had the confidence to reach out, grab and pull Castiel into him. But Dean also knows Castiel needs to rest, and he doesn’t want to push and cause another episode. Dean clears his throat. “I could cook or grab us some dinner if you are hungry,” he blinks, looking back up.
In the motel room, Sam is scouring over the books, trying to find any mention of a vampire cure. He was sure that he had come across one and damned himself for not marking it. Frustration takes hold, and he overturns the table, books, and papers flying about, and Sam screams out in rage. Sam slumps to the ground, defeated. Sam knows that there is only one last hope to save Dean, the angel known as Castiel.
of mistakes in my life,” he pauses, wetting his lips, “but what happened between us, sure as hell wasn’t one of them.” Dean shakes his head, pulling the man in front of him into a tight hug, squeezing him firmly as tears begin to sting his own eyes.
“Because I’m stupid, Sam.” Dean sighs, gripping the wheel tighter before making a quick turn. “I was too stupid to see…” He trails off, wiping at the wetness on his cheeks. He swallows hard before accelerating slightly. He focuses, locking his eyes on the road straight ahead of him again.
He walks up to the couch and plops down on it.  He leans forward with a sigh and covers his face with his hands for a second.  He throws a sidelong glance at Dean rummaging through the cupboard.
“Names don’t matter. How about you and I get out of here?” Dean suggests, winking at the woman. Unfortunately for her, the vampiric suggestion overpowers her, and she complies, taking Dean’s offered arm. The two of them leave the bar, and he leads her into the trees nearby.
“As for the rest of what has happened, I tried to use the power that I have on you. It’s supposed to purge sins from people. It’s excruciating, normally, but on you, it had the opposite effect. I didn’t understand what was happening until you broke my concentration with a kiss. I’m very sorry about that. If I would have known…” again, Castiel is interrupted.
“You won’t lose him. I’m right here,” Castiel puts his arm around Dean’s shoulder, his hand tangling in the man’s hair. “Your happiness is what I live for. Sam makes you happy, and we will save him,” Castiel whispers, pulling back a little bit. He takes Dean’s head in his hands, looking into his eyes. “I love you, Dean. I wasn’t lying when I said that, even in the throes of passion,” Castiel places his lips against Dean’s forehead. He then kisses down to Dean’s eyes, placing a kiss on each eyelid. From there, Castiel places a soft kiss against Dean’s lips, trying to kiss away the worry. Castiel’s heart begins to ache because he feels so selfish and that selfishness puts Sam in danger.
Dean blinks at his own reflection as he wipes the condensation from the bathroom mirror. He takes in a breath of humid, steamy air and grips the sides of the sink. This was ridiculous.
“These places usually have generators. I will go check.”
Dean nods and smiles. “It’s a really nice place, I’m excited to try the food,” he says, his eyes wandering around before meeting Castiel’s again. He furrows his brow. “Wait, you’ve never been here with someone else?” He asks.
Castiel ignores the joke. Now seated on the ground, Cas pulls in his knees to his chest, with his back to the door, and puts his clammy, cold feet on the wet floor. Using the doorknob, he hoists himself back up and lets out a cry. His feet feel like pins and needles. He hurries to the closest kitchen chair and plops down. Rivulets of melted snow flow from his hair to the back of his neck. He shivers.
Dean’s mouth goes dry as he catches Castiel’s hips. How had he missed those goddamn
Castiel looks at the table, then back up to Dean’s eyes, unable to keep his emotions from filling them. “How did you sleep?”
Samantha nods, pushing off the doorframe. “Lock door, no alarm. Got it,” She nods. “Sure you don’t want me to pick you up some coffee then?” She sighs, “Or once again a fucking brush, Castiel,” She laughs. “I know you own a sex toy shop, but your hair looks like you’ve been fucked sideways.” She shakes her head slightly, eyes darting between the screen and her boss.
Dean rounds the corner to the back of the building, and he scans the area. Jesusfuck. Someone put a fucking dumpster in front of the shop’s fire exit. He barrels down the side of the building and crashes into the barrier with the side of his body. “Come on!” Dean yells as the obstruction gives way after a moment, and he starts to push it out of the way.
Dean slams on the brake, stopping the car suddenly. He looks over at Castiel. “Cas, just stop. Let’s just find Sam kill, some vamps, and then we’ll talk ’bout whatever the hell this is after,” he says, motioning to the space between them.
Dean's heart hammers in his chest as the rig speeds down the road with Aaron at the wheel. He’s conscious of his leg bouncing up and down but can’t seem to stop it and can feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins. Looking down at the screen on the dash, Dean recognizes the address of the structure they’re going to, and his heart sinks. He blinks a few times to bring himself out of his thoughts as he watches the world fly by through the window and takes a deep breath.
Sam hears his brother approaching and walks further up the hallway. Looking around at the carnage in each of the rooms. “Jesus, Cas, why the hell would you do all of this?” He whispers to himself. Climbing up the stairs, he takes in a huge breath, trying to clear his nose of the death and blood from below. He gets to the car, waiting for his brother. Turning around, he sees Dean carrying Castiel, the angel unmoving and non-responsive, in his arms. Sam shakes his head, tears falling from his eyes finally. Quickly wiping them away before his brother can see them, he makes his face as emotionless as possible to not make Dean more uncomfortable. He opens the door to the back, waiting.
“No. The doctors are sure that this small stint will be enough to boost my body’s blood oxygen levels. I’m glad I won’t have to carry a tank with me. I’m too young to be that old,” Castiel grins from behind the mask. “You’re here earlier than I expected. Did something happen?” He asks, his eyes hopeful.
“Okay, Dean,” Sam takes another look at Castiel, then wanders out into the main area. He grabs a couple of books on vampires, trying to find different lore on bites, new vamp types, anything to explain what is happening to Castiel.
“Right,” Dean groans softly, releasing Castiel gently, licking his hand clean before sitting back and pulling off his T-shirt and giving both of them a quick wipe down. He tosses the shirt, pushes himself up, and quickly undoes his belt and jeans, letting them fall to the floor and kicking them aside. He fumbles with his boxers, then he’s standing in front of Castiel, nearly naked and painfully hard.
Sam stretches a bit, thoughts running through his mind about where the angel could be and why he hasn’t contacted them.
Dean nods, moving himself to the edge of the bed, and, as if it read his thoughts, it shuts off. He stands up, stretching in an attempt to adjust himself quickly, hoping Castiel wouldn’t notice. He makes his way over to the small kitchenette. Sitting on one of the little chairs, leaning his elbows on the table. “I’m sure you have better things to be doing, right?”
After letting the wounds close up, he inserts the tubes into Dean and hangs the blood bags onto the pole. Turning the machine on, he puts a sleep spell on him. Castiel teleports from the room and shows up in Sam’s motel room.
Castiel returns the smile, looking around the small area. “Hello. My name is Castiel Novak. I’m here to pick up the incident report for my case,” he supplies.
“It’s okay, Cas, take as much time as you need,” he runs his hand across Castiel’s back, curious about where the angel keeps his wings. He walks to the fireplace, tossing some logs in, and barely dodges the sparks that shoot out. Moving back to the couch, he takes a seat, resting his legs on the table.
“Cas, you have always been useful. Just because you don’t go out on a job doesn’t mean that you’re not playing a part. Being someone for me to return to. Knowing you’re safe and that you support what we do. That is more useful to me than putting your life on the line for this bullshit,” Dean searches the angel’s face, hoping for some signal that he understands what Dean is trying to say.
Dean swallows his food down. “I already gave my Lieutenant my report, so hopefully it won’t take more than a few weeks,” he smiles weakly. “I’ll ask him when I go in next and let you know,” he offers.
. I hate having to have these cuffs on you,” Dean says, his voice filled with worry.
“I’m fine, Sam. Stop asking,” Dean snaps, growing more irritable. He turns from Sam, stalks over to the nightstand, and grabs his keys. Slipping on his jacket, he pops the collar before he makes his way towards the door. “Did you want breakfast or not?” He sighs.
“That sounds like a great plan,” Sam shuffles out of bed and into the bathroom. He brushes his teeth, fishing his phone out of this pocket. Sam notices there are no missed calls. He dials Castiel’s phone number, then he puts the phone to his ear. He listens as the number is dialed, but Castiel does not answer the phone. Sam tries not to growl into the phone but shuts it off instead, focusing on brushing his teeth.
A crooked smile spreads across Dean’s mouth as he leans forward and claps Castiel on the shoulder lightly. “You mean a lot to me too...” He says, his voice breaking ever so slightly at the end. Dean clears his throat as he stands up. His hand gently falls off Castiel’s shoulder and down the length of his upper arm before he makes his way across the room to the coffee maker. Dean starts fiddling with the machine in an attempt to make coffee.
“The two of you are known far and wide to hunters and monsters alike. Not only do the human authorities want you, but I know that the creatures you fight also want you dead. Since the two of you are near-invincible, I believe they would take any chance they could to get one of you alone. Dean, this is why I told you I wanted to help you. This isn’t like any other nest you have taken on before. I also can’t help but feel guilty that I put Sam in danger because of my personal needs. I wasn’t thinking clearly, and look what I’ve done,” Castiel looks down to his hands, which are sitting in his lap. He looks up quickly. “Dean, to the left,” he points down a field, the trail overgrown with weeds and grass.
Castiel allows his mouth to be invaded, moaning deep in his throat. Burying his free hand into Dean’s hair, he picks up the pace of his stroking, his tongue dancing with Dean’s.
Dropping the scissors on the table, Castiel takes Dean’s face in his hands, pressing their foreheads together. “I promise you. I will not fail in this. I will get you back.” Castiel’s gaze burns Dean’s, the tension between them so thick; a person could drown in it. Castiel caresses Dean’s dirty face. “Now, let me get you cleaned up.”
Dean swallows, taking another small pull from the bottle. “I can think of a few things,” he says low, licking the excess beer off his lips.
,” Castiel warns. “I’m so close darling, those lips are yours are magic on my cock, honey,” Castiel pants. “Fuck me harder, Dean. You’re going to make me come, baby,” he cries out. Castiel laser focuses all of his attention on Dean’s lips around his aching member and his lover’s skillful fingers massaging his prostate.
Dean’s face pales as he hears Castiel’s words and swallows dryly. His breathing becomes erratic before disappearing behind the curtain again. Bracing himself against the wall, he stares down, watching the water and suds disappear down the drain. He growls before punching the wall hard, effectively cracking the cheap tile. Ignoring the fresh cut on his knuckles, Dean shuts the water off and rips the curtain back. Stepping out of the shower, he grabs a towel and wraps it around his waist before striding quickly over to his bed and begins digging his clothes out of his duffle bag.
“Um, let me check.” Samantha shakes her head, a little surprised at the man’s request. She types the title in seeing that they didn’t have in stock yet. “We haven’t gotten that in yet, but I could place a special order for you and have it here by the end of the week.”
Castiel smiles again. “I don’t know which I like more, Cas or Sweetheart. Additionally, I would like to assure you I am completely sober. The only thing the doctors have administered to me have been some mild breathing treatments, but they are useless around you. Dean, you simply take my breath away,” Castiel supplies.
Castiel looks down his body at Dean. “Porn isn’t real, dear,” he says, his breath hitching but still managing to sound matter-of-fact. “You know what is? My real need for you to fuck my face with that monster,” Castiel growls as one last spurt of cum drizzles out and onto Dean’s hand.
“Samantha?” Dean tries. “What’s wrong? Is everything okay?” He asks, pushing himself to his feet.
“Anytime,” Dean calls back with a smirk. He finishes his own meal, cleans up the mess on the table, and fumbles around the kitchen before finally finding the garbage can. His eyes narrow at the remains of what appears to be a ceramic coffee mug. He lets out a soft sigh to himself and tosses the breakfast garbage away. He finds his way to the living room and locates the remote where Castiel said it would be, and powers on the device as he takes a seat on the couch. Flipping through the stations doesn’t seem to stop his mind from wandering to unbidden thoughts of the man in the other room.
Castiel exits the car as smoothly as he entered and smiles at Dean. “Don’t worry. I have it all planned for us. They have reservations by order, and I picked a great meal set for us. It’ll let you experience a lot of what they have to offer, and we end on steak. I didn’t want to take the chance of you going hungry if you didn’t like the food,” Castiel grins, stepping around Dean. He waits for him at the curb, letting his gaze wander once more.
Dean nods as he turns around, quickly starting back to the motel. His eyes drift to the rearview mirror. Dean studies Castiel briefly before glancing at Sam out of the corner of his eye as he accelerates, reaching the motel in record time. He pulls into the parking lot and throws the car into park, getting out and silently making his way into the room.
Castiel moves to stand right in front of Dean, close enough that their breaths mingle. This traps Dean’s cock between the two men, but Dean can feel that he’s not the only one affected by this game. Castiel is just as hard. “Dean, you don’t have to say anything, but I’ll never force you. I can wait as long as you need.” Placing his hands on the other man’s face, he leans in. Dean’s fangs erupt from his gums again, and he tries to bite at Castiel, who steps away in time.
…” Dean groans as he feels the pressure building low in his groin as their eyes meet. His thrusts become deeper, more desperate, as he moves toward release. “Cas…” he hisses through clenched teeth.
Samantha smiles at her boss, then looks down at the paper on top of her cash drawer. “That was a Mister Dean Winchester. Seems into strange Japanese porn and Asian women. He put in a special order,” she smiles, then blows the slip off of the drawer and watches as the paper falls into Castiel’s lap.
Dean immediately turns on Castiel, his eyes conflicted. “Is it true?!” he crowds the angel in front of him, his hands gripping the sides of Castiel’s arms firmly, fingers biting in.
Tossing the bottle on the nightstand, Dean growls as he moves forward on his knees, leaning into the headboard gripping it firmly for support. His eyes roll into the back of his head at the feel of Castiel’s fingers as they enter him. He angles his hips and aching cock towards Castiel’s mouth. He looks down, locking eyes with his angel, biting down on his lip as he pushes himself between Castiel’s warm lips. Dean’s head falls back, a moan escaping his throat.
The sun somehow manages to make its way through the curtains, and Sam rolls over in bed, gazing at the alarm clock next to him. The numbers showing that they managed to get a good amount of sleep, as it’s just shy of noon. Sam sits up quietly, looking over at his brother on the other bed. Finally, he scans the room, hoping Castiel would have joined them some time while they were sleeping, but there was no such luck. “Cas, where are you?” He whispers into the room, a sudden feeling of dread washing over him.
As the music stops, Castiel disappears again.
Dean cringes, listening to Castiel cry. “Hey, I know you don’t sleep, but maybe just laying down could help. I’ll, you know, stay down here and keep the fire going so we don’t get cold. Although, to be honest, there is a lot of room on this couch. If you’d rather not be alone,” Dean’s voice is even, but he tries for a comforting tone, hoping to talk the angel into joining him. Dean knows that he can’t help him unless Castiel wants help, and Dean doesn’t want to further the risk of pushing him away.
“Else, Cas? What do you mean by ‘something else’?” Dean shakes the chains, visibly agitated.
“There seems to be a power around this group, something abnormally strong. Since the last time you and Sam ran into vampires, I don’t want to take any chances. I can’t lose you, Dean.” Castiel stops, his words catch in his throat as he realizes what he just said. He looks to the ground, then back to Dean, his eyes a little wide, wondering if Dean understands. Castiel secretly hopes it goes over the elder Winchester’s head, like most everything else.
“Ow, are you alright, Cas?” Dean asks quickly, standing still, waiting for Castiel’s touch, holding his breath.
“How?” Dean repeats, furrowing his brows. “What do you mean?” He shoots, picking up his glass and trying out the new wine.
“I think it’ll be a little more intimate than that because I don’t have one of the special vessels for it. You’ll have to take it from me. Now, when we do this, we’re going to be tied together. A piece of me will always be with you. This means, if you’d allow me, you can be a temporary vessel for me.” Castiel explains, slowly and clearly, giving a chance for Dean to change his mind.
Mind spinning, high on arousal, and missing Dean something fierce, leads Castiel to do something that is probably not the best idea to have. Releasing himself, he opens a text to Dean, smiling to himself.
Dean smirks at Castiel, his eyes silently begging the man before him. “I think I’m capable of meeting your demands,” he winks at the man as he nears the door. “Talk to you soon, Sweetheart,” he nods, slipping out in the hallway and leans against the nearest wall to brace himself. It was safe to say, Dean Winchester was royally screwed.
“No problem,” Dean grins as he picks up the pen and starts writing down his contact information before sliding it back across the counter.
The server fills Castiel’s glass, then turns to Dean. “More wine, sir?”
He walks down the steps, misses one, and stumbles forward. He lands on his hands and knees in a powdery drift. He staggers back up.
“Dean. Do you understand what this means for me?” he asks. He continues without waiting for an answer.
“Dean?”
“I see that,” Dean says, raises an eyebrow, “what exactly is this place, Cas? I never even knew you had a hideout.”
Dean grabs a pen and notepad in his kitchen, writing down the address. “I’m not disagreeing with you, but now you’re directing me to bother him at his house?” He runs a hand over his face. “He… he doesn’t have anyone?” Dean asks, concerned but also wanting to learn more about Castiel.
"Fuck," Castiel mutters, shaking his head to see the room empty. "The car must still be back at the store," he sighs. He reaches into his pocket for his phone, forgetting that it's broken. "Fuck!" He yells, throwing his keys across the garage. Castiel pulls at his hair and stomps back into the house. He pitches his coffee cup into the air, and it smashes in the sink. "Why?! Why did this have to happen?!" Castiel continues to yell, storming down the hallway and tearing off his clothes.
Dean blinks a few times as he takes in Castiel’s request. He feels his cock twitch in curiosity, and he shifts in his seat as he considers the condition. Dean looks up to Castiel with wide eyes. “I haven’t… I’ve never done something like this,” he admits with a soft sigh. He worries at his bottom lip and rubs the back of his neck. Dean takes a deep breath, looking Castiel in the eye. “Okay, full disclosure. I’m bisexual, but I’ve never actually been with another man,” he nods.
“It’s not really clean, but it won’t matter once I heal you. Give me your foot.”
“That’s right. I heard a vampire attacked you, and I wanted to see how you were.” Castiel tips his head to the side, still searching for something.
Dean’s eyes glance up, meeting Castiel’s eyes momentarily before yet again averting his gaze. “That could mean a lot of things, Cas.” He shrugs, looking down at what little space there was between him and Castiel now. Dean shifts again before trying to step back, realizing there is no room, and he is stuck between the counter and Castiel. He rubs the back of his neck and sighs. “It could mean you’re nervous about something... or excited,” Dean swallows, “or both.”
The miles pass by in what seems an instant. The preternatural speed from the vampire blood is already taking hold inside. Loud music and laughter assault Dean’s ears. Unable to pull himself away from the allure, he steps out from the tree line, into a parking lot of a roadhouse-style bar.
“Cas? Where am I? Why…” his questioning stops as he shakes the chains. Dean is angry, his memory a little foggy, and he wants answers.
“Like hell you are,” Dean says, getting up from the table before walking to Castiel and closing the distance between them. “I don’t know where this bull shit is coming from, but it’s not happening.” He sighs, lifting his hands to Castiel’s cheeks, wiping the wetness from Castiel’s face with his thumbs. “Cas, I have made
Dean looks over as he hears Castiel’s voice and grins, feeling his heart rate quicken as his cock twitches to life. He places a hand on his chest and slowly moves it down his body. “So are you,” Dean admits. “Not sure I’ve ever wanted someone so much,” he says low. “Maybe that’s why I turn into such a mess around you.”
Castiel’s body begins to warm as he gets closer to his release. Pulling harder at the restraints, Castiel roars Dean’s name as he finally comes. His load shooting hot between the two men. His body begins to glow white-hot, and his skin heating up exponentially as the vampire bites and bruises fade away. “Dean! You have to get off of me before I burn you!” Castiel screams his warning and bucks under Dean, trying to throw him off.
Dean’s brows furrow. Did he just hear his name? No, he had to be hearing things. He clears his throat softly, looking around the room, and takes in the man lying in bed. He sees the man’s eyes closed and takes him to be asleep, so he turns to set the bag on a nearby chair.
“War?” Dean’s brow furrowed, “So what’s our play here? Do we need more backup than you, me, and Cas?”
Dean decides to start where all good meals do; meat. He takes a breath, makes his way over to the store’s meat and seafood area, and looks around. There are so many choices. It never seems like there is this much food when he’s just picking stuff up for himself. He could do burgers, simple and easy, or steaks. But, those things seem
With these words, the king of Hell is gone.
“I’m still a little hazy, but I think I’ll be okay. I’ll just need some time to rest and recuperate my strength.” Castiel cocks his head to the side. “I’ll be right back.” He stands, leaving the room.
“Great, Cas. Tell me where you are, and I’ll meet you there.” Sam replies, a slight hint of panic in his voice.
Sam stammers, mouth agape. He looks at Dean, then back to Castiel. “I suppose I do have some more questions if you wouldn’t mind,” he tilts his head, his brows coming together.
Castiel rushes to Sam’s side. “What has happened here?” Castiel begins, looking around the room at the mess. He looks at Sam, concerned. “Where’s Dean?”
After getting ready, he heads out the door and decides on a couple of breakfast burritos and some coffee. He stops by his favorite coffee bistro and feels stupid when he realizes that he doesn’t know how Castiel takes his coffee, let alone if he even likes the stuff. So he tells the barista black and grabs a small bag of creamer and sweeteners.
Rushing over to Castiel’s side at the sound of his name, Dean sits on the edge of the bed, placing a hand on Castiel’s cheek, searching his face. “Cas, tell me what’s going on,
Dean watches his brother go before another yawn escapes him. Getting up from the table, he walks behind Castiel putting his hands on Castiel’s shoulders and gives them a light squeeze. He leans down, kissing the top of Castiel’s head. “Do you wanna come to lay down with me?” He says into Castiel’s soft, dark hair.
“Love who, Dean?” Sam looks at his brother, confused.
Dean shakes his head with a weak chuckle. “Already picked that one up,” he taps his knuckles on the counter. “I was looking for something a little more… niche,” he smirks. “Maybe, Princess Asuka and the Tentacle Monster?”
“Oh Cas,” Dean breathes the words, his voice breaking and full of some rich emotion. Dean dares not to turn around, afraid that all of this is just a dream. Biting his lip, he reaches for the bottle of soap, passing it back over his shoulder, waiting for it to be just his imagination being cruel. “If you could be so kind,” Dean says, his heart hammering in his chest, as he closes his eyes.
Dean lifts his head at the sound of Castiel’s voice. His cock gives a twitch of excitement and a thrill he’s never felt. Pushing up from the bed, Dean eyes the door. “What was that?” Dean calls back, a small smirk on his face.
“Cas, what the hell are you trying to do here? You can’t keep arousing me, I can’t control the change.” Dean explains, not quite realizing that he admitted to the feelings Castiel unlocks inside him.
Castiel takes notice that the wounds are not healing as fast as a typical vampire. Assuming it could be from the fact that his blood is running through Dean, he counts it as a win. He runs the knife down the front of both legs next, watching the blood pour out of those new cuts. Coating his finger with Dean’s blood, Castiel samples it. At the current time, he notes that Dean’s blood is swarming with the vampiric affliction.
“Ah, I reach down, between my legs
“For someone who wants me gone, you sure are taking your time. Need anything?” He smirks.
“Is something wrong, Cas?” He notices the angel staring hard at him. Dean starts to feel a little self-conscious and crosses his arms across his chest, his muscles flexing and twitching slightly, his body painted by the soft glow of the fire behind him.
Dean nods, making the turn down the road Castiel’s pointing at. He rubs his face, scratching at the light dusting of stubble on his chin as his brow furrows. He looks over at Castiel, listening intently. “Okay, we’ve dealt with Alphas before. But how in hell were they able to find Sam in the first place?” Dean sighs in frustration staring down the dirt road ahead of him.
“Would you sit next to me?” he asks in a brittle voice.
“Where are you right now?” A very annoyed feminine voice asks.
“Dean?”
“But, Dean… he’s an angel. Sooooo how do you like, do it?” Sam pries, not at all gently.
Dean shakes his head as he tries to follow along with the woman’s ramblings. “Whoa, whoa whoa… slow down,” he chuckles, finally pulling her out of the lobby into the parking lot of the station. “Let’s back up just a second. What do you mean he was peeping at me?” Dean raises a brow, shifting his bag slightly. “Not to mention you give a lot of orders to someone who doesn’t even know your name,” Dean challenges, crossing his arms over his chest.
“There’s only something to talk about if you have something to talk about. I guess you don’t want to talk about the wound on your neck, do you?” Castiel shoots back, taking place right in front of Dean. The angel looks down at the other man, trying not to remember before when Dean was naked under him. “I think it’s kind of Sam to give you the privacy you need to talk to me about what’s bothering you.” Castiel smiles, his eyes shimmering for a moment.
Samantha’s jaw drops as she watches Dean walk over to the car. “Is that yours?” She yells after him.
Dean shrugs. “He had stopped in before you woke up to talk to us about the vamps nest, and we had a... disagreement,” he explains cooly before taking a drink of beer with a nod.
He could very well, just
Dean takes a breath looking over at Castiel. “Yeah, me too,” he nods in agreement, turning the key in the ignition, making her roar to life.
“I would give anything to get Dean back, even my Grace.” Castiel mulls over the idea. He’s never shared this part of himself, willingly, with anyone. It’s only been taken from him. An unnamed feeling washes over him. Castiel feels unusually optimistic, the idea that his grace could save Dean.
Dean wraps his arm around the angel’s shoulders, pulling him against the side of his body. “It’ll be okay Cas, I’ll always love you for who you are,” Dean whispers into the stillness of the cabin, the sound of their breathing and the crackling fire the only things breaking the silence.
Dean can feel himself blush, and his breath hitches as Castiel comes further into his space. He swallows down a lump in his throat, trying to find the words. “You know the first thing you did after opening your eyes? You touched my face,” he nearly whispers.
The vampires appeared out of nowhere, and Sam and Dean didn’t prepare to take on what seemed like the entire nest.
“Because, Dean, I was worried for you. Cas didn’t seem in his right mind. He didn’t really look like he was himself. If I could have stopped him from sending me off, I would have. As it is, he walked into a trap. He was blasted through a wall. I don’t know how he even survived it. Also, I really think we will need his help on this, Dean. So whatever it is you two are ‘dealing with,’ I hope it was resolved. We all have to have clear heads when we go after these monsters,” Sam continues to jabber as if he can’t get the words out fast enough.
Walking out of the bathroom, Sam sees his brother hug Castiel. This isn’t the first time they’ve embraced, but something about this one seems different. Castiel’s demeanor looks off, and there are very dark circles under his eyes. Looking closer, Sam can see the wetness on his face, as if he’s been crying, something the angel has never done before. Sam coughs, looking at the two men. “Welcome back, Cas.” Sam stands by the kitchen table, relief spread across his features.
Samantha smiles politely. “Depends on what you’re looking for. We just got the new Casa Erotica volume in last week.”
Sam finishes his salad, tossing the fork in the styrofoam container. “I agree. I am totally beat. Thanks for all the information. I have a lot to think about,” Sam nod at the two of them and stands. He takes the container to the sink, then leaves the kitchen.
A low growl escapes Dean’s throat as Castiel bites the sensitive skin on his hip, causing them to thrust upwards. “Fucck.” His eyes roll into the back of his head as he fists the sheets under him. Dean lifts his head to look at Castiel. “I. Thought. That. Was. A Crazy. Dream,” he says between breaths.
“Dean, I don’t have to be there to know when you’re in trouble. The bond that we share allows me to know when you need my help, also when you’re in great despair, I can feel it.” Castiel looks down at the floor, mumbling the rest. “I will always be there for you, Dean, whether you want me to or not. Like a moth to a flame, it’s too late for me, and I can’t stay away.” His voice is barely audible. Castiel looks back up to the other man, something like sorrow flitting through his eyes.
“It’s hotter than it was a moment ago. I placed some fabric under the door to keep the smoke out, but it's coming in more than before—how much time before they are here. I don’t know how much longer I have,” Castiel relays as he lowers his body to the floor. The air is cooler and cleaner, and he takes small breathes as he watches the top of the small room fills with black smoke. His eyes start to water, and he begins to sweat through his shirt. This isn’t the way he pictured dying.
“I see. You don’t have to say anymore. I wish you and this young man the best,” Castiel ducks his head.
“Okay, Mr. Novak. I have a crew coming out to the location. Is there anyone in the building at the moment?” The calm voice asks.
“I don’t know, Dean. I’m at a loss with all of this. They captured me, but they didn’t hurt me. They didn’t want to kill me, which I found really strange. I know that not all vampires are mindless monsters, but these ones…” Sam’s voice trails off, watching his brother move a book onto the table. He narrows his eyes. “I just think that maybe we’ll have to go stealth. I know the crew runs with a squad of ten and the leader. What I don’t know is who the leader is. I’m not even sure if one of the ten members could be the leader, and they masked their identity,” Sam explains in-depth, gripping up a broom. Sam begins sweeping up the broken glass that is littered all around the motel room. “Seriously, Dean… where did all of this glass come from? All of the bulbs are broken in this room,” Sam stares hard at Dean, demanding some kind of answer.
“Fuck Cas…” Dean moans, his head rolling back as Castiel’s tongue moves over his skin, causing him to harden all over again. He takes the bottle from Castiel as he swings his leg back over Castiel’s hips. Pulling the sweatpants down Castiel’s hip, Dean quickly removes them, tossing them aside with a soft thud on the ground. He positions himself between Castiel’s legs as he leans down, kissing and nipping at his neck. Dean finds Castiel’s lips and moans into his mouth as he grinds their hips together. “So good,” Dean mumbles against his lips before working his own pajama pants and underwear down, kicking them off the bed.
This is the first of the two chapters I'm dropping today. This one is so super short, but I think you'll enjoy it. Let me know what you think, should you feel inclined.
Ease the seat back...”
He looks around but the visibility null. He can’t even see the Impala, and he knows it’s mere feet away. He clumsily makes his way to the side of the cabin, all the while calling for Dean.
“What do you have in mind?” Castiel asks, taking a mirroring sip of his own beverage. He places the bottle on the countertop and braces his arms behind him. Castiel crossed his legs at his knees, his thighs bunching under his tight pants. His arms flex slightly as they take his weight, and Castiel waits.
“Yeah yeah..” Dean waves his hand in the air as he makes his way to the hallway towards the kitchen. Grabbing three beers, he finds his way back to the library. “Here we go,” he says as he sets two of the beers on the table. Dean leans back in his seat, propping his feet up on the table. He twists off the cap to his beer and tosses it on the table.
“Cas, what the hell happened?” Sam asks, his voice laced with anxiety and concern. He opens the door, running out after his brother. Hoping to catch him at the car before he can leave.
Groaning at the assault of multiple sensations, Dean begins thrusting himself into Castiel’s hand, meeting his pace. Tilting his body slightly, Dean brings a hand to Castiel’s face, pulling it to his as he begins kissing him with desperation. Dean moans into Castiel’s mouth, slowing his thrusts, wanting to savor the sensation. Slipping his hand under Castiel’s trench coat, he pulls their bodies closer together. Dean places a hand on the small of Castiel’s back as he parts Castiel’s lips with his tongue. The smell and taste of mint invade his senses as Dean feels himself harden with each pump into the angel’s hand.
“Cas, this is great and all, but what are you going to do when all my blood is gone? If I change back into a human, I’ll die of blood loss.” Dean says, trying to bring some logic to the situation.
An hour later, Castiel steps back and looks at his work. He nods. “Not bad,” Castiel mumbles to himself. Suddenly, he hears a popping noise and scans the store. Shrugging, he checks his watch and walks into the back room again. “The last push, Castiel. We can do this,” he chuckles to himself and hauls up a box of costumes onto the desk.
“Hey, hey, Cas,” Dean grips up the angel. “I’m here,” Dean’s covered head to toe in snow, he takes Castiel’s arm, throwing it over his shoulder. “What made you come out here? It was better inside,” Dean attempts to bring the almost frozen angel back inside of the cabin.
Castiel opens his mouth to talk, then closes it, biting the lower lip. He looks away for a moment, pain on his face. He takes a deep breath and stares into Dean’s inquisitive green eyes. The man is close. So close he can smell him, since the heat that radiates from his body.
“Always,” Castiel moans, “I want to do this the right way.” Snaking his arms up Dean’s back, he grips his shoulders and pulls the man slowly down onto himself, growling as the tightness of Dean’s ass envelops his twitching member. “Oh
“Oh, sorry, man. Just figured this was like the first ‘I’ll cook and have you over’ kinda date thing,” the guy chuckles. “I mean, you have dessert and this awesome beer, I just figured.”
Peeling off his clothes, Castiel enters his master bathroom. Going over to the shower, he turns the water as hot as he can stand and enters the enclosure. The steam and warmth flood his senses, and he moans softly.
Castiel looks at the motel door, then down to the ground. Guilt rips through him, making him shudder in the cold of the early morning. “I’m sorry, Dean. I didn’t mean to put Sam in danger and anger you,” he whispers into the dark. Then with the soft sounds of fluttering wings, he disappears.
Castiel watches his employee leave on the camera. He watches as she turns her key in the lock. Once more, Castiel runs his hands through his hair, looking around at the inventory around him. He sighs and looks at the paper again. “Dean Winchester, if only we met under different circumstances,” Castiel opens up the special order page on his browser and puts in the information. Castiel enters his personal address for the product and shrugs to himself. “It’s not creepy, I’m just providing excellent customer service,” he tells himself. There isn’t anything wrong with hand-delivering the items to his customer. Maybe it’ll give Castiel to chat up the guy. Who knows, perhaps he could be wrong about this one and have a chance after all.
“I will try my best to never leave your side, Dean. For as long as you’ll have me,” Castiel promises, his sincerity reflected in his eyes. “Now, you mentioned something about Sam?” Castiel smiles a knowing grin, cocking one eyebrow.
“All of the signs point to Cas, Dean. The bodies smote or pulled apart, but I’ve never seen Cas fight like this before. I knew he could be ruthless, but he’s always been careful around us.” Sam looks around the room again, seeing a familiar shape covered in blood and pieces of flesh. He gasps, surprised to see the angel lying in a puddle of blood. A large gash in his head and bite marks all over the exposed skin of his upper body. Castiel’s shirt lays in tatters, soaked a deep crimson. “I think I found him,” Sam whispers, pointing towards the form. He is silent and still, afraid to move.
Dean’s body begins to warm up with each touch of the cloth, with the slight press of Castiel’s hand against his skin. Gritting his teeth, he can’t help but feel helpless, something Dean doesn’t care for feeling, but he trusts Castiel entirely and doesn’t stop him. After his chest and arms are clean, Castiel stops for a moment. “I need to get clean water. I’ll be right back, Dean,” and with that, Castiel is gone.
“It’s been some years, but you seem very receptive to my teasing. I like it a lot, Dean. I wonder what other machinations you would be sensitive to as well,” Castiel muses, then winks. He nods to the other plate, ready to make the other two sandwiches. “This was a great idea.”
“This…” Castiel says, pulling Dean away from the counter and pushing him into the bathroom, closing the door behind the two of them. Castiel turns Dean, pressing him against the closed door. Castiel presses his lips to Dean’s, savoring the masculine scent of mahogany and whiskey. Pulling back for a moment, he breathes into Dean’s mouth. “It’s been so hard keeping how I’ve felt about you inside. All of these years… watching you from afar, but not acting on this… I’ve needed something more.” He presses his lips to Dean’s again, kissing him hungrily.
“Yeah,” Dean smirks. “Sooner rather than later, I’m hoping,” he pulls his bottom lip between his teeth as his eyes flick over the length of Castiel’s body and find their way back to that intense blue.
I am so taken by all of you, that I wanted to post a second chapter. <3 I hope you're having a great day!
Dean pulls off and removes his finger slowly before adding more lube. Once he feels his fingers are slick enough, he leans forward, circling the hole before dipping in the tips of both fingers. He licks up and down Castiel’s cock, moving his fingers slowly in.
Lightning shoots up Castiel’s spine, and he comes off the couch, back bending like a bow being pulled. “There,” he yells, his cock filling more, plumping up further in Dean’s mouth. “Shit, fuck,
Sam grabs his laptop. “I’ve got a lock on Cas’ cell. It’ll lead us to the nest, Dean.” Sam grins at his brother like he won the lottery. “Good thing I’m resourceful, huh?” Sam winks, “We’ll get him back safe.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel says, a bright smile gracing his face. The moment passes in an instant as reality sets in. “We have to stop delaying this.”
Samantha rolls her eyes, making her way back on to the sales floor. Her eyes roll again, involuntary at the guy waiting by the counter. She’s seen the man in the shop a few times before and thinks the guy to be a typical pretty boy. Taking a deep breath, she plasters on her best customer service smile as she rounds the counter. “Hi. Welcome to the Pleasure Zone. Sorry for the wait. How can I help you?”
“Dean, Dean, come with me,” Castiel whines again, tightening his grip, and one more slide over his swollen tip has him spraying his load against the glass. Castiel hisses through the pleasure, fucking his hand and prolonging his orgasm.
Castiel steps away from Dean, seemingly unfazed by the kiss, and lets go of Dean’s head. Dean sags in the chains, covered in sweat and his seed. His pants are a ruined mess. Castiel shakes his head.
The sound of ruffling feathers fills the room. “Hello, Dean.” Castiel manages to get out, his voice hoarse and filled with deep regret. He shouldn’t have come, his heart feels like it is breaking just from looking at Dean, but the lure of his voice, his prayer, was too much to stay away.
“Hey, what took so long? You were in there for over an hour! Is Cas still out?” Sam eyes his brother, curious about the smile spread across his face. “I think I found something here. The Men of Letters found that some vampires have venom that can cause hallucinations and increased … appetites… for stuff. How Cas was fighting us, I think he might have been infected, Dean.”
Throwing the washcloth back into the bowl, it flies off the table with a loud crash, as Castiel grips up Dean, pressing him hard against the wall and between his own hardened body. He kisses him like a man drowning, and for once, Dean has a hard time keeping up. He opens his mouth to the angel, their tongues dancing. Dean pulls back with a gasp as Castiel’s hand finds his erection.
“Yes, Cas,” Dean manages, his voice heavy with lust for the man before him. He looks into the man’s eyes, and his own vision is filled with nothing but that hue of blue.
Castiel sighs and looks away, conflicted. Parts of him wants this—the warmth of Dean’s fingers on his stirs something in him. Yet, the rational part of his brain is telling him to run. Anxiety sits on his chest like a succubus. He bites his lower lip. To his surprise, tears start running down his cheeks. He frees his hands, takes a few steps, and wipes his face, his back to Dean.
Dean swallows down the lump in his throat and nods in acknowledgment.
Castiel startles awake when he feels a solid hand touch his arm. “Who?” He questions and looks over the side of the bed at Samantha. “Oh, hello, Samantha. I’m afraid you caught me in the middle of a dream. You’ll have to excuse me,” Castiel explains and pulls himself up the bed. He takes a rattling breath, reaching for the oxygen mask.
“I mean… not all of it has been terrible,” Dean jokes, trying to break the seriousness of the moment.
The paramedic takes all of the info as another takes the man’s vitals, and Dean helps lift the man on to the gurney. He watches intently as they lift the man back into the transport, and he lets out a deep breath, finally feeling himself relax, just slightly.
Dean takes off in a sprint around the building. No. No way this was going to happen on his first serious run.
Sam chokes on the bite of his salad he put in his mouth while listening to Castiel tell the story. He brings a napkin to his mouth, trying to contain his laughter.
Castiel reaches back with his other hand, grabbing the dripping washcloth from the bowl. He places the soft cloth against Dean’s cheek, wiping away the blood. The men continue to hold eye contact in this moment. Castiel continues to wipe away the dirt from Dean’s face, then one drop of water drips from his chin, trailing down his chest.
“Mr. Novak, they will be there very soon. Please keep talking to me. What do you think started the fire? Sir? Hello?” The voice repeats, the words starting to jumble together.
Castiel steps outside and is met by a gust of cold wind. He blinks the flurries away and starts walking around the cabin.  His feet quickly sink deep, his shoes filling with snow. He ignores the discomfort and turns the corner.  The snowdrift is even higher, he trudges on.   By the time he gets to the back of the cabin, the wind is howling and the snow blinding.  The chances of finding anything in this weather are slim.  He decided to head back.
“I couldn’t see anything. It’s a whiteout out there.”
“You still have to go shopping, Dean. I’ll stay here and relax,” Castiel says, mirroring Dean’s pose.
“You need to calm down.” His voice is even, devoid of emotion.
“Goddammit,” he mumbles.
Castiel’s eyes flutter closed. “Not an angel then,” he whispers. “Sure are beautiful like one,” Castiel’s hand falls from the man’s face, and his head tilts back as he goes unconscious.
Castiel opens his mouth as wide as he can, breathing through his nose, and flattens his tongue to get Dean deeper. He relaxes his throat, feeling as the head nudges just a little deeper. Castiel shivers as spit drips past his lips and down his chin. Growling deep in his chest, he presses only slightly at Dean’s entrance, teasing more.
“Thanks for the food, Dean.” Aaron greets him as he comes from the direction of the dorm. Aaron takes a seat at the table, and he bites into his breakfast. Dean nods and smiles back at him as he finishes putting the last plate away.
“I assure you, I can make it look a lot better,” Castiel baits, slipping his hands under the blanket once more.
His body tenses again as his blue eyes search the man’s hunched figure, hoping for an opening, finding none.
Sucking in a considerable amount of air, Dean cannot stop his fangs from retracting, and Castiel’s closeness is too much for him to handle. Taking a chance, Dean flicks his tongue along the angel’s lips, trying to distract him. This ploy fails, and it seems that Castiel is beyond any awareness of what is happening to his physical form.
“Bout time you went home, Dean,” Benny reminds him. “Your report was the best I’ve seen in a long time and, quite frankly, made my job a whole lot easier,” he let out a low chuckle. “Now go home and get some rest.”
Castiel looks at his phone, the clock saying it is well past sun-up. He shrugs out of his coat, putting it on a nearby chair. “Dean, I’m going to clean you, because we have a lot more to get through today. This isn’t going to be a comfortable night, I imagine, and I am sorry for that.”
Castiel stares at Dean, his heart beating hard in his chest. Is he serious?
“I want you to kiss me, maybe whatever this is… we can get it out of our systems and get on with curing me?” Dean posits, “You and I are … well, there is something.”
“Dean? Two? For me? I don’t two fist beers, man,” Sam’s eyes all for his brother.
About a half-hour goes by, and Castiel starts to feel incredibly warm. He fans himself as beads of sweat trickle down his neck and disappears into his shirt. “I don’t remember having the heat on,” he muses as he checks the thermostat. Looking at the little box triggers alarm when Castiel notices smoke trailing from under the door. He squints at it and tests the door handle. It’s only slightly warm, so he takes the chance to open it very little, knowing he could cause a backdraft. The first thing he notices is the front register is completely engulfed in flames. The heat is stifling in the small room. He winces and looks for a means of an escape from the front, but the area is quickly filling with more fire. Castiel closes the door and takes some of the costumes, stuffing them under the door. “It’ll be okay. Just stay calm,” Castiel reminds himself, crossing the room to the back door. He unlatches the lock as he dials the emergency number on his phone.
“That sounds awesome, thank you.” Dean smiles at the woman, pulling his wallet out of his jeans’ back pocket as he watches her type something into the system.
Castiel looks at the door and whispers, “Challenge accepted,” in the very lowest of sounds, as he sees Sam quickly stand and rush the door.
“Do you require my assistance, Dean?” Castiel calls after his friend. Walking over to the door, fastening his wayward belt in the process. He stops, waiting for Dean to reply.
Castiel’s hands shift between his legs, and he hisses at the contact. “I knew you were trouble when I first saw you,” he whispers, pulling his legs up slightly under the thin blanket. His fingers pull back the edge of his robe, and Castiel slowly slips his hands up his warm skin. “Dean?” Castiel asks again, holding the other man’s stare.
“You’re incorrigible. Now, this next part will not be pleasurable, but I will do my best to lessen the pain of it. Dean, I have to remove your clothes. Is this okay?” Castiel asked, trepidly.
“Cas, here,” Dean kneels down on the ground, pulling Castiel’s fingers aside. He unknots the shoes quickly. “Lean against the door,” Dean lightly commands of the angel, removing one shoe then the other. From his knees, he looks up at Cas from underneath his lashes. “Is that better, Cas? You really need to get out of those clothes and into a hot shower. Can you manage that, or should I help you too?” Dean teases with a wink.
Before Dean can react, Castiel is pushing him back against the wall by his shoulders. Dean tries to push against the angel, but Castiel is too strong. “Holding out on me, huh, Cas,” Dean teases, resting against the wall.
Dean narrows his eyes, taking in the landscape around him as he turns. Gripping the wheel, swallowing hard, as he listens to Castiel’s explanation. Dean exhales deeply. “Look, Cas. I appreciate you sent Sam somewhere safe, and it’s not your fault he was trying to get back to the motel…” he trails off, pausing briefly. “But if anything happens to him because I was outside of my mind…” Dean sighs again. “I was such a dick to him,” he says, remorse heavy in his voice.
“Samantha,” Castiel grins, the one word filling the room. “She has a way of getting her way, occasionally. I hope it wasn’t too much trouble for you. She’s only looking out for me.” he explains. “So, clothes? New clothes, or?” Castiel questions, placing both of his hands on top of the blanket. He smiles at Dean, his hair disheveled on top of his, now tilted, head.
Walking down the hallway, Sam hears a commotion. “Dean, ummm, is everything okay? Was Cas alright?” He turns the corner peering into his brother’s room. “Jesus, Dean! What the hell happened?” Sam yells, looking at the cuffed-up angel. Surveying the scene, Dean’s pillow is soaked with blood, the towels under Castiel’s head, also soaked. The angel is in a pair of sweatpants and one of Dean’s shirts. He’s unconscious, but his body occasionally spasms. All at once, his body comes alive, his legs kicking out. Sam rushes the room, holding the fighting angel down. Castiel’s eyes are still closed, but it’s like he’s caught in a nightmare. “Deannn!!!” Sam yells as he looks at his brother. “I think we need more cuffs.”
Dean feels his blood run cold as Sam talks about the possibility of something happening to Castiel. He looks back to the trunk, looking for syringes of dead-man’s-blood. Dean sniffs lightly as he shuffles some guns around. “I’m not making any promises there, Sam,” he coughs, pulling out 4 syringes holding two out to Sam. “So hopefully, it doesn’t come to that.” He glares at his younger brother, daring him to push the issue.
Dean’s eyes dart up Castiel’s body, and he abides, pushing his finger slowly in as he takes more of the thick cock into his mouth. He wants to be able to take all of it, really
“Yes,” Dean breathes. “Yes, Cas,” a moan escapes his mouth, surprising him as he watches the other man. His hand also seems to have a mind of its own as his grip on Castiel’s hair tightens, ever so slightly.
Dean nods as he pulls into the motel’s parking lot, feeling too exhausted suddenly to argue with Sam. He parks quickly, putting the car in park leaving the engine running. “Okay. Make it quick.” He says softly as he exhales, leaning his head against the cold glass of the window.
Opening the door, he enters the smoke-filled bar. Patrons are everywhere. A large dance floor is the main attraction, surrounded by people at small tables, and a large counter on the back wall lit up with neon lights. The giant mirror behind the vast selection of liquors and other drinks catches Dean’s reflection. Still the ever ruggedly handsome man, but the mirror reflects the new predatorial gait in his demeanor. Dean squints against the flashing lights and makes his way over to the bar, taking up an empty seat.
Super NSFW. We are getting into the more sensitive tags. Blood drinking, rough sex, and Dean's lack of self-preservation.
“Dean, why are you acting like there could be anyone else for you? You don’t think I don’t see you and Cas eye-fucking each other every chance you get. I’ve caught you calling out for him in your sleep, Dean. Also, he’s not exactly subtle about his own feelings for you. He just didn’t know how to approach you with them. So is that what happened when I was sent away? Did he finally approach you?” Sam asks, a grin plastered on his face.
The door explodes open, and Dean grabs up a blanket a moment before Sam sees the two men in the throes of passion.
Dean chuckles softly and looks down at their hands bashfully. “Of course I do,” he says softly, feeling slightly more at ease, having Castiel’s hand in his own as they start for the entrance of the building.
Dean wasn’t embarrassed or ashamed by the type of porn he watched, but something about the thought of Castiel knowing made him feel a bit bashful. He rolls his eyes at himself as he pulls on some dark, worn jeans with a red and black flannel with a black T-shirt underneath.
“You’ll have small scars. My grace is still settling, I’m sorry.”
"How'd the meeting go with Dean?" Samantha opens up the conversation.
“I want you to shower for me, Dean,” Castiel offers. “In particular, I want to watch. I will be outside the glass. I will not enter, and I will only touch myself if you allow it. Again, you have the right to completely turn this down, no hard feelings. Either way, I would still feel better if you stayed,” Castiel nods and takes another drink.
The receptionist shakes her head and waves him off. “Now go before I wake Dean and tell him you’re here.” With those parting words, Castiel leaves the office. Before getting into his car, he looks up at the station’s windows, wondering which floor Dean is on. “He’s sleeping,” Castiel mumbles. He’ll text him later tonight; for now, he needs to look over the paperwork and call the incident in.
“Ah yes. What the Hell I am doing here. Well, I could ask you the same question. See, I was summoned by your brother. The location and time were clear, and I’m never late. So you might want to question Sammy dearest,” he says.
He looks up at Dean.
Looking around the backroom, Castiel drops another massive purple dildo into a box with more of the same. He reaches up and wipes the sweat from his forehead. There are times, like now, when he questions his sanity to do all of the counting by himself, but he reminds himself that his store is booming due to the extra work. Castiel sighs and looks up at the whiteboard with the special orders list. He smiles when he sees Dean’s name. Letting his mind wander, Castiel daydreams about delivering his customer’s items. What does Dean's voice sound like? What kind of personality does he have? Would Dean rebuff Castiel if he asks him on a date? The thoughts start to swirl, and Castiel braces himself against the desk, feeling a little dizzy.
Castiel peeks up from the pages of tick marks. “It’s that time already?” He looks over to the clock, noticing the time. “I’m afraid I’m going to be here for a while longer. When you leave, lock the door behind you, but don’t set the alarm. I’ll take care of that when I leave,” Castiel mumbles, slightly distracted by the papers in front of him. The door chimes again, pulling his attention to the cameras once more.
“How about you come over to my house, and we see if we even make it out the door to get food?” Castiel counters. He watches Dean’s eyes flick around his face and grins. Slowly, Castiel licks across his lower lip, eyes sparkling.
“He eats all kinds of healthy crap, and when he visits, he’s always trying to get me to try new or different things. I’d never tell him I actually don’t mind, and would, but he’s fun to mess with,” Dean laughs.
Castiel is out of the car and to the door in no time at all. It only took that ghost of a grin on Dean’s face to put his ass in gear. He holds the screen door open for the other man as he unlocks the deadbolt. “I hope you like craft beer,” Castiel warns. “It’s all I’ve been drinking lately.” Castiel shrugs and walks into the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean rubs his face with water as he hears Castiel’s voice. “If that burger place is closed, pizza’s cool,” he replies before sticking his head out around the corner, taking in Castiel’s face and panicked expression. Seriousness washes over his face as he searches Castiel’s face. “What is it?”
Dean’s jaw gapes, and he can feel a blush and heat creep up his neck and tips of his ears. “I..I…you,” he stutters, scrubbing his hands over his face, turning away from Castiel. “
Castiel returns a moment later, eyes on Dean at the door. “Here they are. I think I’d lose, well, everything if it wasn’t attached. You ready?” Castiel tilts his head, nodding at the door.
If he can manage to calm down, he’ll hopefully make his way through this evening and not make a complete ass of himself. He takes a deep breath to calm his nerves, and before he knows it, he’s pulling back into Castiel’s driveway. He quickly grabs the bags in one hand and the beer with the other, makes his way back up the porch and knocks on the door with his knuckles.
Sam appears behind the vampire, one fast movement, and the head goes rolling across the ground. Still, he knows it’s too late, and as Sam looks down at Dean and at the blood smeared across his face, his eyes fill with tears and his mind races with ways to save Dean from his fate.
“Yeah?” Dean groans. “I’d say you got yourself a deal,” he sighs. He slows, only moving his hips, fucking slowly into his fist. Dean lifts his free hand and tweaks his left nipple, letting out a moan. “Didn’t know how hot it could be to be watched,” he bites down on his lip.
Smiling to himself as he enters the living room, Castiel nods at keeping it together at the cellphone place. After the episode with Dean and the nightmares he had last night, he wasn’t sure if he should leave the house. He’s glad he did.
“Team what? Destiel? Is that some kind of ship?” Castiel questions, mouthing the word again. It has a nice ring to it. Maybe he can pass it by Dean tonight and see what he thinks. Fuck! Dean is coming to the hospital. He is in no state to entertain a handsome man; how is he going to manage this? Castiel’s thoughts begin to spiral, and that familiar dizzy feeling takes hold in his head. He closes his eyes to still the world around him. “It will be very nice to see Dean tonight. I admit that I will have trouble containing my excitement,” Castiel shares with his employee.
Castiel drops his hands and wraps them around Dean’s waist. “Stay the night, please?” He glances down between them, blushing. “I don’t want to be alone tonight, Dean,” Castiel whispers, his voice laced with emotion.
“It’s been snowing since noon, and I can’t see any partially covered footsteps. I’d say since morning. We should check inside.”
Humming along, Dean goes about his morning routine before a shift. First, he packs his duffle. Then, takes a quick shower. After that, he brushes his teeth, and before he knows it, he’s standing in the middle of his living room in his duty t-shirt and pair of worn jeans. Turning off the sound system, he does a quick check for his phone, keys, and wallet before grabbing his travel mug of coffee and his duffle.
The angel extends his hand, index, and middle finger, pointing. He awaits Dean’s permission.
The door swings open and bangs against the wall caught in the raging wind.  Castiel grabs the cold metal knob and fights against nature to pull the door closed.  When he finally manages, the snow has drifted three feet in the cabin.  It slowly starts to melt.  He takes his trenchcoat off and hangs it on a nearby hook, adding to the floor’s wet mess.
Castiel is startled by the admission. “Oh, I’m… well, I. Maybe I played my hand too early then,” he stumbles. “You know what, forget about the whole thing. I didn’t realize that you, well… I assumed you were comfortable with the mutual flirting and that you had been. It was my mistake,” Castiel rambles and stands. “Please excuse me. The guest room is the door across from the kitchen here,” he points, then bolts from the room. There is the sound of a door slamming somewhere down the hall, then silence.
Samantha grimaces. “I would advise against that, sir. It may look clean on the surface, but the danger is what lies beneath. People track in a lot of nasty things, but if you’re sure, I’ll be happy to take an early day. Thank you,” she smiles again, looking at the sunshine beyond the storefront. “It’s a really nice day. Maybe I’ll go on a picnic,” Samantha walks around the counter, disappearing behind the door and emerging shortly after with her purse. She stands next to Castiel, a brow cocked. “You’re sure you don’t need help?”
Dean nods, “Yeah, that’s works for me,” he smiles, working on his steak. “This is a delicious steak,” he comments.
Dean’s phone starts to ring, “Highway to Hell” blaring through the tiny speaker.
“I’m coming in.”
“Hey, my name is…” She begins. Dean turns to her, placing a finger over her lips to silence the next words from her mouth.
Dean sighs, swinging off the table taking a gulp of beer. “Okay, okay, fuck. Sam. Calm down.” He sighs, sitting up, a seriousness coming over his face. He takes in a big breath as he glances at the entrance of the room before looking back to Sam, narrowing his eyes. “I want to preface most of those questions with the fact that... I’m in love with him.” Dean says the last part slowly as he tries to gauge his younger brother’s reaction.
Back in the dungeon, Castiel walks back to where Dean is still shackled. Dean picks his head up, looking at him, still in the same state of physical distress as Castiel left him. “Cas, please just undo the locks, let me have a moment to recoup.” He begs.
A pause.
“It has?!” Sam leans across the table, his excitement tangible. “You have to tell me, Cas,” he begs the angel for more details.
Dean gives Castiel a questioning look, “Not particularly…”
Castiel leans in close. “You’re supposed to eat the whole piece, Dean. Fill that mouth of yours. I know you can do it,” he winks, then leans back.
“I mean, is Cas any good? I’ve never had a relationship with an angel, and there doesn’t seem to be any lore about the whole situation. So, yeah, for scholarly reasons, I’d like some details. If you wouldn’t mind, I did almost die after getting captured since the two of you decided not to tell me you needed some… uh, playtime.” Sam snickers.
Dean’s eyes widen at Castiel as his breath hitches, feeling the pressure of the angel’s body leaning to his own. His eyes darting to Sam quickly, seeing he was still sleeping before looking back at Castiel. “Uh...Cas… we uhm talked about this.” He swallows. “P... personal space,” Dean stutters before clearing his throat. He can feel himself blush as he feels himself stiffening between their bodies. Dean closes his eyes tightly, trying to steady his breath.
“Sorry. I don’t know why I’m crying. I’m too confused to think right now.”
It takes all of twenty minutes to get to the building. Castiel’s chest starts to do this fluttering thing when he thinks about Dean being somewhere in there. Parking his car in the designated spot, he walks up to the office area’s front door and is greeted by the receptionist.
Turning the water on again, Castiel puts the bowl under the stream, his thoughts wandering to what he shared with Dean. Pressing his covered erection against the sink, Castiel tries to lessen the lust he feels. The pain of the drawer digging against his member is enough to stave off the need but almost makes him go over the edge. He shudders a shaky breath while rinsing out the washcloth, and then teleports back into the room.
Samantha has to stop herself from rolling her eyes before looking back to the system. “It does, apparently,” she shoots the man a fake smile. “Anything else for you today?”
“Cas, you have a home… with me, in the bunker. That’s why we gave you a room. Our home is your home.” Dean’s voice breaks a little, trying to get the angel to understand.
“Oh? Maybe this can be a teachable moment. I can teach you how to be the best bottom, but you’ll have to top me first,” Castiel groans, stopping Dean before he can get to the reservation counter. He wraps his long fingers around the other man’s hips, pulling back.
The bed is waiting when Castiel throws himself onto it. He pulls the blankets up, coughing hard, chest tightening. It takes at least ten minutes to calm down, the tears spilling down his face from exertion and pain. "I'm done with today. Fuck it all," Castiel whispers, and he closes his eyes. Sleep is fitful at best for him and full of dreams and fire. Many times throughout the day, he wakes, screaming. "Can I get some sleep?" Castiel grumbles into the dimming evening light. He throws a pillow into the closet and kicks off the blankets, then suddenly he's hit with a flashback of the fire. Imaginary heat invades and scorches his lungs, and he begins choking. Castiel throws himself to the floor, seeing smoke billow into his bedroom, but he isn't there; he's back in the store. The memory grips his mind so tight, Castiel can feel the concrete under his palms.
Slowly, Castiel moves his hands from Dean’s hair to rest them over the hands on his own face. He smiles, turning his face to the right and placing a kiss on the rough palm he finds there. Castiel’s eyes wander over the other man’s face, and he licks his lips as he reaches out, slipping his hand under Dean’s shirt.
He leans up, cranking up the volume before laying back down on the seat, covering his face with his hands as the music assaults his ears. His mind wanders to images of Castiel standing above him, lust-filled blue eyes burning into him. Dean growls inwards as he feels his cock hardening against the denim of his jeans. Sitting up quickly, he sees no one along the long stretch of backroad. Dean curses through his teeth as he aggressively undoes his belt followed by undoing his jeans. He arches his back as he inches them down his hips. Closing his eyes tightly, Dean takes his hard cock into his hands as thoughts of Castiel’s touch come flooding back to him. He begins pumping himself as the song’s beat, and the running engine softly vibrates the car. Dean swallows hard as he begins increasing speed, and his free hand claws at the soft leather underneath him. “Cas…” Dean growls as the name slips over his lips involuntarily.
“I live alone, Dean. Who else would cook for me? Do you know how expensive it is to eat out every night?” Castiel says, watching over the food. He lifts the lid and pokes at the colorful vegetables, then dumps in the onions. Adding a little salt to the whole collection, he turns the heat down, letting it simmer for a bit, turning his attention to Dean.
“Not a problem, Boss,” Samantha mumbles as she pulls away from the safe and closes it. “Try not to stay too late. I know you have a lot to do, but don’t forget to sleep.” She grabs her purse from the hook and heads out the door.
“You ready for this, Rookie?” Benny asks.
Dean takes the lube and moves to the floor, sitting on his heels looking up at Castiel. “Um, scooch forward a bit,” he says, eyes glazing over the other man’s sinful body.
“Well, I don’t really have a place to live, but I found this abandoned building, and no one owns it, so I took it. It’s far enough out that I can do what I need, and I’ll never be disturbed. It’s also difficult to get away from.” Castiel explains, nonchalant.
. The word does something to Dean he can’t quite pinpoint, but he likes it. A grin spreads across his lips as he lifts a hand to cup the side of Castiel’s face. His eyes flick down to Castiel’s lips before forcing himself to look back to the blue of his eyes. Dean lets out a soft huff of laughter. “Never really thought of myself as gentle,” he says.
“The other one is for Cas,” Dean says, simply cocking an eyebrow, glancing at the entrance, wondering what is taking Castiel so long.
Dean kisses down Castiel’s neck, rolling the man under him. Still slowly working with his hand, he finds Castiel’s nipple, taunt, and hard. Licking it, and pulling another sound from the angel as he blows a warm breath over the bud. Castiel arches his back, gripping the sheets, the feeling beyond heavenly. Slowly, Dean moves his way lower, biting and kissing, until he gets to the crisp hairs marking the usually forbidden territory.
“Cas, I….” Dean tries to find an excuse for his reaction but is unable to think of anything.
Dean begins to scream out as the Grace destroys the vampire virus. His hands in fists, back bowed, he screams louder, as the blue light begins to grow brighter. Then the light fades completely, and Dean is left hanging in the chains, his legs giving out completely, unconscious.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” he groans.
“You’ve already drunk… There was a woman at a bar. You took her into the trees nearby, that’s how I found you. She was already dead at your feet. Then you came after me, and I needed to get you close, so I let you feed on me too, which knocked you out. Angel blood has that effect on monsters and people. I needed to get you here, and I knew you wouldn’t just agree to be chained up. I’m so, so sorry, Dean.” Castiel retraces the night for Dean, his voice tinged with sorrow.
Castiel moans, watching as the man on the other side of the glass slowly comes apart. “I love to watch, and I could watch you forever, Dean. I’ll show you so many incredible things that I’ve learned. Gods, baby, just like that,” Castiel sighs, his hand on the glass shaking while his other works over his wet tip. Inhaling deep, Castiel presses his forehead to the glass. “Will you come for me, my sweet?”
sure I’m going to need those clothes back. So, once you’re feeling one hundred, I could swing by your place to pick them up, or we could meet up somewhere that serves food and beer,” he smirks, looking at the other man, his eyes moving from Castiel’s eyes to his lips briefly.
Castiel grins slightly, teasing his fingers against Dean’s ass, slowly moving closer to his hole. His eyes darken as he thinks about taking this virgin ass someday. Castiel runs his finger around Dean’s rim but never breaches the tight hole. He tightens his fingers around Dean’s cock, and swallows around the swollen head knocking against the back of his throat.
His presence does not go unnoticed by a few females nearby. The women seem to size him up, then one brunette gathers the courage and approaches him.
A louder moan vibrates in Dean’s chest as he nearly shudders at the thought of Castiel’s request. His eyes flicker closed as he curls his fingers a bit, trying to figure out the angle again.
Dean finds his way to the canned goods and picks up a can of diced tomatoes. Making a detour by the bakery, he picks up some fresh hoagie style buns. Dean’s headed to the check out when he stops in his tracks and side-eyes the pies. Dean’s not sure if Castiel is a dessert guy, let alone likes pie, but he can’t help himself, and a fresh apple pie finds its way into the shopping cart.
one who didn’t know that he felt that way about me?” He sighs, shaking his head, picking up his beer, taking a drink.
“To answer your question, yeah, I’m a good cook,” Castiel cocks a smile. “Dinner will be ready in about ten minutes. What do you want on your sausage?”
Dean’s eyes dart around the darkened room, his chest heaving as he wraps his arms around Castiel, enjoying the pressure of the other man’s body on top of his own. He runs one hand up Castiel’s back as his fingers tangles in his hair, and he tugs gently, placing a kiss on his angel’s shoulder. Castiel’s words echo in his ears, almost deafening him. He squeezes Castiel tightly to his body as he listens to the silence of the room. He swallows hard, his voice low and hoarse. “I need you,” he chokes into Castiel’s ear.
“Oh, this is good! The guy, my boss was peeping at in the store, is also the angel who saved him. It really is fate or some shit,” Samantha says, slightly exasperated. “Well, here’s the deal.
“It’s fine, Dean. Please go fetch the food,” Castiel grumps. He strains his eyes, trying to spot the broken pieces of ceramic that obviously shattered everywhere. “What the hell was I doing last night?” Castiel muses, picking up parts of the cup. He tosses each piece into the trash and grabs the larger pieces out of the sink. Castiel dumps the drain catch next, then runs the water. Using the sink sprayer, he wets the surface, then wipes it with the kitchen cloth. “I’m a fucking mess,” Castiel growls at himself as his hands start to shake slightly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come with me, Dean,” Castiel begs, feeling himself getting nearer to climax. He wraps his hand around Dean’s still hard cock, pumping some of his angel power into the other man. “I want us joined together in pleasure,” he growls out between clenched teeth as he tries to hold himself back, waiting for the other man.
He stumbles, almost taking both of them down this time.
Watching Dean come apart on top of him is all Castiel needs, and with a loud growl, he bottoms out inside of Dean, blasting his load deep inside of him. He pulls Dean to his chest, his heart thundering in his ears, “What did I do to deserve you?” Castiel inhales deep. The smell of their passion is mixed with the scent of soap, whiskey, and a light smattering of mint.
“It’s better if you don’t come. Dean, well, he drank human blood, Sam. There isn’t anything that you’ll be able to do to save him. I’ve already tried one thing, but it didn’t turn out how I expected. I’m going to have to try a different tactic, and I don’t want you to stop me.” Castiel explains, knowing that if Sam showed up, he’d make him stop. What Castiel needs to do next will not be humane, and it could hurt both of them terribly. “I’m hanging up now.” Castiel shuts the phone off, leaving Sam to sputter on the other end.
“A hero like you, I’m surprised,” Castiel teases and stands. “Shall we? After I get my keys, that is. One moment,” Castiel leaves the room and heads through the kitchen. He opens the door to the garage and squints into the muted light. Flicking on the overhead light shines some brightness into the darkened room. Castiel catches the dull glint in the corner of the room, and he heads over to the keys, brow knotted.
Dean pants as his breaths ruffle Castiel’s hair. He fights the press of the teeth against his gums, against the call of the bloodlust. He doesn’t want to attack Castiel again; instead, he wants to understand what is causing the angel to act like this. His green eyes lock with Castiel’s blue ones, and he can see that Castiel is holding himself in check. The angel’s body is practically shuddering with the amount of control it’s taking.
“Ask me if I care after I get you out of here,” Dean looks into the angel’s face, concern written all over his own. He backs the two of them out of the bathroom, cringing as he steps on a couple of shards of glass. Dean carries Cas over to the couch, a blood trail on the floor from his cut foot. Dean sits down, placing Cas in his lap. Dean begins to look over the angel for damage. “What happened in there?” He asks softly, his heart hammering in his chest.
“This is called bloodletting,” Castiel looks at Dean while picking up a scalpel. “This is extremely sharp. You might not even feel the cuts. Now that you’re a vampire, you can’t die if I bleed you out, only if I cut off your head. I will still try my best, especially because we don’t know exactly how to get this out of you. We don’t know how deep the transformation goes, and I’m hoping it’s only to the blood.”
“I punched the mirror. We need to get that out,” Castiel says, in one breath.
Dean grins as he finishes cleaning up Castiel before tossing it aside in the growing pile of laundry on his floor. His smile widens hopefully as he shimmies the sweat pants back up over Castiel’s pelvis and hips. He scoots off the bed scooping up his boxers, slipping them on. Meeting his angel’s eyes with a hopeful glint in his green eyes. “Are you okay, if I take the cuffs off?”
Castiel looks at Dean again, his eyes grazing up and down, taking in the feast before him. “Dean, why are you here?” He asks again, opening the door—Castiel motions for the other man to go first.
Dean coughs, and his jaw drops momentarily at Castiel’s words before taking a step back. He smirks to himself as he feels his stomach flip, and the ever-present blush he gets around the attractive man returns. Wetting his lips, he swallows hard, looking at the door as if he had x-ray vision.
Dean’s eyes widen as he flips into firefighter mode. “Fuck..no,” he breathes as he struggles with his belt and pushes the car door open, sprinting up to the porch without closing it behind him. He drops to his knees beside Castiel and immediately checks for a pulse and takes in a deep breath when he feels one. He cups the man’s face with his hands and runs his thumb along his jaw with the grain of stubble. “Cas, come on. Wake up for me,” he pleads.
He chuckles softly, shaking his head and blinking a few times before looking back up at Castiel. “No, I’m not hurt..just a little..uh...stiff..from...sleeping.” He coughs, rubbing the back of his neck again as he feels a heat rise to his face. Dean glances quickly to see if Sam is still sleeping and then shifts his attention to the window seeing the light starting to come through the windows.
“Do you want me to awaken it again?” Castiel offers.
Dean holds his breath, closing his eyes as the wind in the room whispers against his naked flesh. As the vampire blood runs through his veins, making each draft feel like fingers trailing along his body. He tries to think of anything to make his body calm down, but it’s too late as his nipples peak, and he comes to attention once again.
“I..”
Dean grins to himself, watching Castiel interact with the other man. He looks up once he realizes he’s being addressed. “Yeah, thank you,” Dean nods with a polite smile and moves his glass to make it easier for the server to pour. He looks over at Castiel, and his smile widens.
Dean lets out a small gasp as his hand finds his cock. He tilts his head back and strokes himself slow and lazily, licking his lips. “Mmm, what would you do to me?” He groans. “How would you use me, Sweetheart?”
“If his stubborn ass would ever listen to me…” Dean trails off. Swallowing down the lump in this throat, he makes the turn down the long dirt road he had the night before. Dean slows the car to a roll scanning the road and field ahead and looks over to Sam. “Okay, where do we go from here?” He cocks a brow.
Dean covers his face with his hands, shakes his head, and chuckles at himself.
Castiel looks down at this almost red shirt. Pulling at it a bit, the wet fabric sticking to his skin. “This would be Dean’s, but I assure you he is safe and okay. He’s sleeping right now while getting a transfusion. I was about to call you, but I thought it would be better for me to come in person.” Castiel says, rather quickly, so he doesn’t get shot.
Castiel offers up the bottle to pour Dean another glass. “We had a lot of the same friends, and well, they blamed me for the whole thing. She was an excellent manipulator. I didn’t see it until it was too late. Also, we lived in a small community, so it became difficult to avoid people who didn’t know about the whole situation. I decided it was better, for me, to make a clean break,” he says with a shrug.
Dean takes a moment to compose himself, looking down at the floor and trying to stretch his neck. He can see that he is still rock hard, the tip glistening and dripping wet. “What is Cas doing to me?” Dean whispers to no one.
Castiel’s body tenses. Whatever that look was, it can’t be good. Pain as intense as the desire he felt earlier overcomes him. He resists the urge to walk after Dean.
Smiling, Castiel starts wiping away his mess. “I feel tired but fine. There isn’t anything to worry about,” he assures. Cleaning quickly, he tosses the paper towel and stows the cleaner back under the sink. “Thank you for indulging me, Dean. I hope you sleep tight,” Castiel smiles. “Good night,” he says, leaving the bathroom. Castiel makes it back into his room, locking the door, and sighs deeply. “What am I doing?” He questions while pulling his soiled pants off. Aiming for the hamper, he makes the shot, and they go in. “At least I still got it,” he mumbles and changes into some boxers. Castiel climbs into bed, his mind still racing. What is he going to do about Dean?
“Dean, we can find a way to help you. There has to be a cure.” Sam begs, taking a step towards Dean.
“Hot guy like you, shouldn’t be so hard,” Castiel fingers the slick paint job, rounding the front and standing next to the passenger side. “Gotta have a million chicks lining up to get a ride on that ax of yours,” Castiel winks.
“How kind of you. Are you always this chauvinistic?” Castiel looks over his shoulder. He opens up the sausages. “How many do you want to stuff yourself with tonight?” He asks, looking down at the meat. Castiel doesn’t wait for the reply and dumps all four into the pan. He bumps Dean out of the way of the stove and starts the burner. After some time, the meat begins to sizzle, and Castiel watches it with a sharp eye. He pours some beer into the container, then places a lid on top, watching as the liquid slowly starts to bubble.
Castiel wiggles off Dean and kneels at his feet. He looks at the sole of one, then the other.
Dean’s moans become louder as he pushes himself to the back of Castiel’s throat, savoring the warmth of his mouth. His breath becomes more ragged, and he quickens his pace as sweat beads across his chest. Bearing down on the headboard, he looks down at Castiel. Their eyes meet, sending Dean over the edge. “
“Hmm?” Dean raises a brow and can feel his neck and face flush under Castiel’s gaze. He takes an involuntary step closer.
Dean sighs as the man shows no signs of waking up. He looks up and down the alley, willing the ambulance to show up. He looks back at the man and briefly notices the man’s sharp jaw and handsome features. Dean narrows his eyes a bit and sees the red lights before the actual vehicle pulls into the empty space and lets out a sigh of relief as it makes its way to them.
“Fuck…” Aarons breathes. “Dispatch says they think they lost the guy that called. He wasn’t able to get out the back door, said it was blocked or jammed.”
“What was this disagreement about that he felt the need to come back and teleport me to the bunker? Why were there scratches on the table? Why do you have bite marks and hickeys all over your body, Dean? And where did you go when you took off in the Impala? Because it seemed that everything came to a head when Cas showed up…” Sam streams the questions one after another, his voice rising.
“Mmm fmmfffmmm rmmmffmmmrr…” Castiel says, holding a finger up.
Dean swallows hard, watching Castiel. He steps closer and reaches out, running a hand through the dark, silky strands. “You sure? You don’t have to,” he says softly.
here,” Dean smiles weakly. “And lucky for you, I have the next three days off,” he nods.
“Yeah, Cas?” There is some rustling in the room as Dean struggles to get his pants back on. A couple soft cus words are muttered, then an ouch when Dean smacks his leg on the table near the couch in his haste to get to Castiel. Dean comes running over to the door, pulling it back. He stops, blinking his eyes at a very naked Castiel. Dean’s mouth gapes open, and he coughs. “Did you need that back scrub?” He bites his lip, trying really hard to just maintain eye contact and not let his gaze drift to the angel’s softly chiseled form.
Castiel can’t help but be piqued. He turns around and leans on the sink, wiping his hands on his pants.
“Dean, the vampire fight… you were turned. You and Sam had no time to react.” Castiel begins and is interrupted by Dean.
“Yes, I am in the building. I tried to leave out the back door, but it seems to be blocked by something,” Castiel says, his heart starting to race. He tries to clear his mind of the feeling of dread creeping in, but it’s becoming harder as the room begins to heat up unbearably.
Castiel smiles around the man’s thrusting cock. Licking at the silky flesh, he lightly skims the hardness with his teeth. Castiel presses on the spot inside of Dean and slaps his other cheek with the flat of his hand, effectively pushing Dean deeper into his mouth. “
, he silently chastises himself as he lets out a breath, making his way back to the couch. Why? Why was this man having such an effect on him? He sighs, running a hand over his hair.
Castiel pulls the other table with the different torture devices on it. Dean’s chains shiver as he presses himself against the wall, trying to get away from the angel. “Cas, I’m into some kinky stuff, but I’m really not into torture anymore,” Dean argues, his voice shaking a bit with fear.
,” he corrects himself. “Visit people we’ve rescued, I mean?” He finally manages, his eyes narrowing at his Lieutenant.
“Everything, Cas,” Dean answers softly, kissing Castiel gently. Grunting, he reluctantly rolls off Castiel, lying next to him. Trying to catch his breath, Dean rubs his face with his hands before looking back at his angel. “Never leave me again,” he pleads.
“Dean…” Castiel gasps again. “So close, baby,” he growls, slowing the shift of his hips. He grinds his head back into the pillow. “Right there,” Castiel begs as he bites down on his lip.
