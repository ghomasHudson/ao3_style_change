Mycroft sighed, setting his styrofoam cup down onto the cold, metal table that separated them. "I do. I just want to know why you are putting up such a fight for a man you never met before until tonight. A stranger that is so hell-bent on 'saving' London's less fortunate and others in danger, all while breaking several laws. You do know he has several cases of assault against him? Trespassing, loitering and not to mention the several fines form the FCC for inappropriate, unregulated live stream content?"
“Four!”
John started to think about how he ended up on the streets, it wasn't a series of bad luck, no. He was on the streets because he chose to be here. He had enough money for a modest flat, he could probably get a job at Saint Bart's as a trauma surgeon. He could then buy a nicer flat with all the food and warm blankets he wanted, but he couldn't do that knowing the people he fought with in Afghanistan were suffering. That they were out here fighting for their next meal while he was set, he shook his head, no. He couldn't comfortably live like that, he needed to be out here with them.
"What would that be?" John asked, focusing on his food.
Lestrade scrambled to his feet, rage in his eyes as he pulled out his pistol and shoved it against the Colonel's chest. "You just assaulted and threatened an officer! Hands behind your back, now!" He shouted as Mycroft analyzed the situation before them. The Colonel laughed, it was an ungodly sound. Like demons prying open the gates of Hell.
“Five!”
“You have been a Medic long enough for others, it’s time to worry about your wellbeing and happiness. Don’t you think?” Sherlock asked gently, a small smile on his face. “It’s your turn to let someone else care about you."
“Three!”
The Colonel crouched down as he placed the cigarette back between his lips, calmly lighting it with the zippo and taking a small drag before blowing the smoke in the Inspector's face. "Touch me again and I promise you that I'll skin you like a tiger with a hunting knife." The Colonel stood back up, taking another drag as he looked towards Sherlock now. "The Captain sends his thanks, don't fucking expect another 'get out of jail' card next time. I told him to let you rot in this fucking room, but I guess he likes you."
"I could say the same thing about you." John winked, stepping inside now but never letting go of Sherlock's hand. He didn't want to let go, neither did Sherlock. Both men wanted this feeling to last. "Sorry about stepping inside like that, a cop car is coming up the street." John said with a sigh, closing the door with his foot as lights passed by the frosted glass. He took off his mask then, breathing in the smell of food. "Oh, I'm not interrupting dinner, am I?" He asked, a look of guilt washing over his face.
Arthur looked confused. “What?”
Sherlock blushed, but he was smiling even more now. "Toss your clothes into the hallway, I will bring you a pair of pajamas and a change of boxers."
John carried a duffel bag full of medical supplies and medicine at his side, his steely blue eyes scanning the homeless who lined the walls and slept in their tents. Everyone seemed okay, no one was coughing or vomiting, for now. But he decided to stop at a man who was curled up with his knees pulled to his chest and arms folded over his chest, there was no harm in asking. He gently placed a warm hand on the man's knee, shaking him lightly. "Sir? Are you okay? Is there anyone here that needs medical attention?" He asked calmly and softly, not wanting to scare him.
"You must be the Captain! Oh, it is so good to finally meet you!" Mrs.Hudson started down the stairs, but John hurried to meet her halfway, smiling as he shook her hand.
"Lunch? That is if you are not busy. I was thinking somewhere private with no cameras, maybe Regent's Park at The Hub. I will buy you something warm to drink and some food."
"Sherlock, you are human. Despite what the papers say, what everyone says about you? You are human. Life is about making mistakes and learning from them, that is just how life is. For all of us. How many science experiments have gone completely off the rails for you before? How many failures did you come across in your studies before you found the right solution? That is life, life is one big science experiment for us all and we are all just taking notes on how to do better the next time life gives us a chance." Mrs.Hudson said quietly, petting the Detective's arm. "Failure teaches us to do better, to try harder. Failure is not the final door closing on you, it never is. Besides, you are Sherlock Holmes! You'd probably blow a damn hole in the wall and make your own solution like you've done to my poor flat before!" She said teasingly, smacking him on the arm.
"Nonsense, it is no trouble at all. After all, you are the 'hero' of London, we can't just have you eating scraps now, can we?" She said seriously, looking down the stairs at Sherlock who was still blushing and looking down at his left hand again that had been holding John's. "Sherlock! Don't just stand there, we have a guest!" She called to him, making him snap out of his thoughts and walk up the stairs behind John. He was trying so hard not to stare at... Well, everything about the Captain. "Come in! Come in!" Mrs.Hudson practically sang as she led the boys into the flat, John removed his boots at the door.
"If you go screaming about live ordinances, I'll have to be the bastard that pulled the pin on these fuckers. You don't want that, do you?" The Colonel asked with the twisted smile still plastered on his face. Lestrade swore under his breath, his pistol still clenched in his hands. "Let the Detective go, he walks out of here with me and no one has to die."
“On the count of ten we are going to bust the door open, Miss!” Lestrade yelled as the SWAT grabbed the battering ram.
"A friend that you love?" Mrs.Hudson asked, a smile spreading across her face as she looked up to the Detective who blushed a deep shade of crimson.
John laughed, coughing as he stood up from the Inspector’s chest. “I know better than to argue with a man who has a gun in my face. Maybe you should take the hint too, Inspector?”
“There is an air vent here! Too small for you and me to fit into Captain, but Sherlock and Briars can get out. What do you think?”
"I do have a question to ask you, Captain Watson." Sherlock said, recovering from his shyness as he looked to the man.
John chewed his lower lip, swearing under his breath as he ran a hand through his hair. “Call it in, I don’t like the looks of this either. Let’s camp out in the restrooms behind us, hopefully they aren’t locked up. We can barricade the door and wait for backup to arrive, call in the whole damn Platoon, even the Lost.”
John hummed, peering out into the darkness. “You’re probably right, that girl loves herself some pissed off Civvies looking to beat up on some police.” Just as John was about to cross the threshold of the door, Lestrade had his pistol stuck right in his face.
Sherlock pointed the gun at Lestrade crotch now. “Well, then I suppose Mycroft will be icing something else tonight.”
“I… I do not know. I just feel responsible for their wellbeing.” John whispered, his eyes dropping to the pup in his lap.
"Yes, I suppose you should have." John was looking around now, for cameras and cops. He sighed, slowly taking off his mask to eat.
“Sherlock! Hughes! Get out of here! Run! Meet me at Checkpoint Alpha!” John yelled, not seeing Lestrade pull himself back upright, only to sucker punch the Medic in the check.
Sherlock looked towards the door now as Lestrade tossed his badge in, swallowing hard as he looked back to John. “I… I cannot leave you here. Isn’t there some other way?” He whispered, eyes full of worry and distress. “John please, I want to help you. I do not want you locked up for years for taking the law into your hands. I can’t imagine being without you.”
John shook his head, chuckling. "You are very strange, Sherlock."
"Then it is only time before they find me, they have tried arresting members of my platoon and getting information out of them. Via threats and other nonsense, but thankfully none of my men or women have cracked under the pressure. Then again, you can't exactly threaten us when we have been through Hell and back." John said seriously. "I did three tours of Afghanistan, that is twelve years I had spent over there in the worst conditions imaginable. I'm pretty sure if a person were to hold a gun to my head at this point, I wouldn't do much but become angry." He said seriously.
“Not unless you want her to be.” John said, pointing one of the pistols up at the ceiling above him. Lestrade took a step forward, swallowing hard.
"Oh dear, is our flat about to catch on fire again? Sherlock, we have spoken about this! No more petrol in this flat!" She scolded him with a huff, crossing her arms.
John hummed. "Good for them both, everyone needs someone. I'm bisexual myself, maybe even pansexual. I'm still learning all the terms and where I fit on the spectrum." John admitted honestly. "I'd date someone who was nonbinary, transgender, or whatever as long as they have a kind heart. My technology specialist that you mentioned early in text? Transgender Woman, very lovely. You'd get along with her nicely, though she can be blunt. No beating around the bush with her." He chuckled. "Unlike her partner, Arthur Hughes. He is selective mute sometimes under high stress, a very gentle person."
"What? No! No! They are about to ambush the Captain and drag him to Scotland Yard! I have to stop them!" He yelled as he moved past her, nearly kicking open the front door as he dashed out onto the street but he stopped on the landing. Shit, he didn't know where he was going. Mrs.Hudson cleared her throat behind him, motioning him to follow her into her own flat.
“What?” The SWAT officer asked looking over his shoulder only to catch a bat with his teeth. It was the little girl that Sherlock had seen on Twitter in the video with John, she had a pretty good back swing for a six-year-old.
Sherlock smiled, God this man was so pleasant to be around. "I believe I saw this Hughes gentleman the day before yesterday when we were fleeing from the cops. He wasn't too thrilled with you handing out your number to me."
“Take your fucking goons with you or I’ll splatter the Detective’s brains all over the floor.” John growled again, tapping the back of Sherlock’s head with the barrel of the pistol. Mentally reminding himself to apologize later for the rough treatment.
"Thank you." John said quietly, looking down at the hot drink and sandwich.
What should have been a quiet night of conversation turns deadly.
Sherlock watched as John coddled the puppy, it was sweet seeing the man like this. He had a strange feeling that Gladstone had saved John more than he had saved him. There was a light in the Captain's eyes, one that had previously looked dull at The Hub. Another reason to keep fighting. But his eyes, his steely blue eyes shone bright tonight, especially when their eyes met. Mrs.Hudson brought them their food and excused herself downstairs, but not before making a heart with her hands to Sherlock behind John's back. Sherlock huffed, blushing as he turned towards his plate and picked at it shyly. "I see you have a file on me." John said, pointing at the manilla envelope on the table with 'The Captain' written on it. "Anything interesting in there?" He asked while he ate his food, sharing pieces with the puppy.
“Captain.” Hughes said quietly, staring ahead at the tree lines. “We have more activity on the roads surrounding the park. I have a bad feeling about this.” He whispered, Kaitlyn joining her boyfriend to look out across the tennis courts.
"Don't get too close, you don't have a mask on. I don't need you locked up with me." Said the Captain as the camera pointed downwards towards his scuffed and muddy combat boots. "Just help me get this thing on and I'll get out of here, I expect tonight to be quiet." He said as the noise was muffled now. "It's almost Christmas, maybe a few tourists and police. But nothing crazy..." The Captain said with a sigh like he wanted a good chase, Sherlock knew that feeling all too well.
John nodded, rage in his eyes as he felt the broken skin on his cheek. Checking his teeth with his tongue carefully. “You want to fight?” John asked with a smile as he dropped his gun and slid it back to Sherlock. “Fine, we’ll fight. But I am going to make you regret this in the morning.” John growled as he tackled Lestrade backwards, punching the inspector in the face once before Lestrade grabbed him around the throat.
"Oh you think I'm bad?" The Colonel asked with a smile as he ripped the string attached to the grenades. "Then you are really going to like this." Lestrade went to yell for Mycroft and Sherlock to get down, but an explosion never came. Instead smoke started to pour out of the grenades, filling the room quickly as the flak jacket was tossed off and flung into the center of the room. Sleeping gas.
“Inspector!” John yelled, causing Lestrade to turn around swiftly. “Don’t forget your wallet.” John said with a smile as the inspector looked down at his wallet, slowly picking it up. “There, can’t be walking around without that, can we?”
Sherlock smirked. "Oh yes, I have a habit of planning ahead. Some call me 'The World's Greatest Detective.'" He said with a roll of his eyes. "I merely observe, there is nothing special about me."
“I do, don’t I?” John asked with his own purred, his hand sliding just under Sherlock’s ass and holding his leg gently. His fingers feeling the tight jeans against those long legs he loved.
“I do trust you! But I love you more!” Sherlock squeaked out, stumbling over his words, but it was too late, he was blood red and staring wildly into John’s eyes who was just as red in the face as the Detective was.
"This is my treat, I asked you to join me here. I would ask you how you take your tea, but we both know I already know the answer to that." Sherlock smirked before disappearing into the cafe for a moment, coming back out with one sandwich and a cup of tea. He passed it to John who was still sitting in stunned silence, looking up at Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed, tilting his hand as he started a more accurate observation of the Captain. "You were shot in your left shoulder, inches from your heart. By the way, you have been wheezing the entire time we have been talking. It could be pneumonia starting or you contracted tuberculosis overseas while recovering from your shoulder wound. They didn't give you that vaccine before shipping you over, or did your pride tell you that your immune system was strong enough? You are left-handed. Judging by the tan line on your left wrist I say you have been back in England for about six months, England doesn't get much sun. Let me see your phone." Sherlock demanded.
John grabbed Sherlock now, pushing him over to Hughes and Briars who was holding her arms down to pull the Detective in. “Sherlock, I need you to go. Hughes and I can handle this, please. I need you to go home and look after Gladstone. I need you to be safe.” He whispered, frowning beneath his mask. “Please.”
"Ah! Sister! I should have considered that." Sherlock said with bright eyes and a smile, his fingers drumming on the table.
Sherlock blushed a deep crimson, his mouth hanging open as he stammered out nonsense, the blush spreading to his ears and almost down his neck. "Nonsense. I do 'not' feel love. It is a chemical defect in the brain that blurs all reasonable thoughts! It clouds the mind and makes you do all sorts of ridiculous things!"
Sherlock smiled. “Oh, I’m sure he’ll hear about it while he is icing your wounds when you get home. But for now, you are going to lay there while the Captain and I disappear.”
“It still doesn’t make the pain dull any less.” John whispered, squeezing the tissue in his hand. “It doesn’t make the nightmares any less painful, every time I close my eyes, I just see my partner bleeding out, lifeless before me and the sound of bullets hitting sand echoing in my ears.”
“So, what’s the plan?” Hughes whispered to Sherlock, turning his head slightly to look at him from his peripheral. “You do have a plan, right?”
John nodded, opening the door for Sherlock and his friends to file in. “The Lost is members of the platoon who defected to Civvy life, but always willing to lend a hand or get into a scrape if need be.” John stepped inside the bathroom once they were all inside, stripping off his jumper to try it around the handle and stretching it so it reached the first stall door and tied it around the gap. “There, should be a good minute before they can get the doors open if the cops do arrive. Briars wet some paper towels and stick them to that window, we don’t need them looking in here to see what we are doing.” John ordered, clicking the safety off his weapon.
"The name is Sebastian Moran, Colonel Sebastian Moran. The platoon pulled together some cash from our own pockets along with some very angry Civvies who want to see the Detective walk. That little show the Captain put on last night really tugged on some heartstrings, I guess. You have a whole hoard of pissed off people outside of Scotland Yard right now, would be a damn shame if they stormed in here and caused a riot." Tsked the Colonel as he pulled a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his right breast pocket, placing one in his mouth as he lit it with a faulty zippo.
John smiled, blushing faintly from Sherlock’s praise. “Okay, but I need to speak to Hughes and Briars about my leaving, I’ll meet them tonight at Checkpoint Omega, Avondale Park. If I do not come back after that, something has happened, and I want you to look after Gladstone.”
“If you drop me to kiss him, Captain? I am going to kick your ass.” Hughes warned, smirking down at the two men as the vent finally popped off. “Got it!”
Sherlock blinked in surprise. "I did? What would that be?"
"Interesting..." Hummed Mycroft from his office chair that sat before a thousand screens, his coworkers sitting in a stadium like arrangement. "Thank you for the tip, little brother." The eldest pulled out his phone, sending a text to Lestrade.
“Yes I did.” Sherlock said with a smile, looking at John as hot air left his lips in soft white swirls in the freezing December air. “I quite enjoy nightly adventures.”
John turned back and looked at The Hub, the figure hadn't moved, they were just sitting there. He sighed heavily again before starting across the grass, the entire time he was looking around for cops. As he closed the space between him and The Hub as the figure became more clear, he felt the same sensation he felt that night he was running from the cops. Time slowed down, his heart raced in his chest as he met those bright blue eyes. It was the same man who saved his ass back at the China Gate. That stunning, dark curly-haired civilian, he had forgotten in his exhaustion that he had given his number to this man. The one he bailed out of jail for the trouble he went through in helping him escape on live feed.
“No! No. It is okay, I am happy you let her go. Why don’t you let them go, huh? Why don’t you carefully slide the pistols over to me and we can talk about this?” Lestrade offered.
“Sherlock!” Kaitlyn called to him; John was starting to panic now, grabbing Sherlock again and trying to force him back over to Hughes.
Sherlock shook his head, smiling now as he squeezed the hand in his. "No, in fact you are just in time for dinner. My landlady, Mrs.Hudson feeds all guests that come into our flat. She is very adamant about getting a warm meal to you." He said with a chuckle, pulling his hand away suddenly as Mrs.Hudson stood at the top of the stairs. He blushed lightly, knowing she had seen them holding hands.
"The home of the great Sherlock Holmes." John said with a smile as he looked around, curious about the various documents laying about and the boxes stacked up in the corner. Sherlock noticed him looking and rubbed the back of his neck.
“Then we can get a hot meal and go back to my place?” Sherlock asked, his face flushing from his own shyness.
John just stared at Sherlock, his expression blank and full of so many questions. Sherlock was use to this look. "How did you do that? What are you?"
John looked at the message for a moment, then at the number. This had to be one of his platoon members. "I never asked him, Colonel Moran isn't a man you can exactly sit down and talk to. He tends to go into graphic details about his time in the military. Things I do not wish to relive, you know how it is."
"I cannot tell you that, I cannot go into too much detail. I bought a burner phone to message you, I had it encrypted by one of my acquaintances. But it is nothing compared to the technology you have for your live streams. Is the woman I heard talking the other night on the television a technology specialist? It would explain how she created an encryption so flawless that not even my nosey relative can hack."
“There is no competition at all really.” John said coolly, pressing Sherlock’s leather-gloved hand to his lips which made the Detective flush madly.
John laughed at that, a sweet sound to Sherlock's ears. "Oh, giving orders now, are we? What else would you have me do?" John practically purred as he leaned forward, placing Gladstone down on the floor who instantly went to explore his surroundings.
“Oh it has been quite alright, oddly quiet. I do apologize for our late appearance, Captain. But due to tonight’s odd calmness we circled the park to look for Scotland Yard. It seems to be all clear, but we may need to make this quick.” Kaitlyn said as Hughes started to look around to make sure the situation remained calm.
"You." John said, sitting upright and looking over the Detective a few times. "You are Sherlock Holmes, aren't you? I have read about you in the paper a few times, you are the guy that solves all the cases for Scotland Yard. Why are you helping me?" John looked around in a panic, eyes wide as he scanned the area for cops. Sherlock grabbed his hand though, his eyes almost pleading.
“Nice to meet you.” Sherlock said with his own soft smile, extending his hand to the woman who took it with both and shook firmly. “I do hope tonight has been quiet for you both, nothing major to be pulled away from?”
“The Lost?” Sherlock asked as they started towards the restrooms, Hughes shooting off a flair into the cloudy winter sky.
"This isn't a trap, Captain. I only wish to speak with you, to learn more about you. You are quite an interesting individual."
John did as he was told, starting the shower and taking off all of his clothes, except for boxers that he wasn't wearing. He tossed the clothes into the hallway as Sherlock went into his room to grab the clothes he had just bought earlier that day. He couldn't help but look towards the bathroom door that lead into his room, the outline of the Captain could be seen through the fogged styled windows. He gulped, feeling his cheeks burning even more now. Dammit, he was being such a pervert now, but he couldn't help it. Everything about this man screamed handsome and sexy. Besides, he only glanced, it was harmless. "Here are your change of clothes." Sherlock called, setting the pair of pajamas outside the bathroom door in the hallway as he gathered up the old items.
"Holy shit!" Lestrade yelled as he jumped back, shielding Mycroft with his body. He went to scream but the Colonel calmly shushed him, the cigarette held firmly between his lips.
"Uh, yes please." John stammered, standing with the Detective who motioned for him to sit back down.
“Ah, he lost it due to infection. I was the one to perform the surgery to remove it since the hospital was putting off his surgery. Thankfully, I was able to buy some sedatives from one of the local drug dealers, so the procedure wasn’t too painful for him to endure.” John said with a smile as he waved to the two figures, Kaitlyn waved back with a smile.
Sherlock laughed as he pulled himself upright, Hughes doing the same. “I would take the Captain’s orders though, young lady. Don’t want to be disrespectful, do we?”
"I heard you are making us dinner, I'm sorry to trouble you like that. It sure does smell wonderful in here though, I can't thank you enough for making me something hot to eat. I've been living off of MREs since my time back, they aren't bad, but having a proper meal sounds wonderful." John said with a chuckle, but Mrs.Hudson smacked his arm playfully.
John looked confused, cocking his head to the side at the Detective as his own hand rested on Sherlock’s. Subconsciously lacing their fingers together which made electricity pulse through their bodies once more. “Sherlock, I have people to help on the streets. I can’t leave them; they need medicine and someone to take care of them.”
“Them.” John said within his own broken whisper, a small smile twitching at the corner of his lips as he remembered the person he loved so dearly. “Gender non-conforming, they loved who they could pass as either male or female.” John hung his head as a small almost nonexistent laugh left his throat. “They were beautiful, I have a picture of them on my phone.”
“Good find, we can raise them up so they can crawl through when it is all clear.” John said, squatting down some so he could lift Hughes up to loosen the vent. “Here, see if you can pry it off.”
Sherlock put his hands on to the top of his head, swearing as he began to pace. “Just! Just give me a second!” He hissed again, leaning against the opposite wall as he wracked his brain for a solution.
John hummed, nodding slowly. "You are right, I should take a rest. But who would help the people I make normal rounds with? I do have patients, believe it or not. Some of them are children with respiratory illnesses, I can't just stop showing up and expect them to be fine."
John went to open his mouth as Hughes jumped down, swearing as he grabbed his prosthetic leg, the mix of the cold air and the drop hurting him bad. “Sherlock, I don’t know what to… what to say.” He whispered as Hughes went to help Briars cover the windows. “How could you, Sherlock Holmes, love someone like me?” He asked in a whisper, the tips of his ears red from the blush.
"Harry is my sister, short for Harriet." John said with a smile, chuckling now. "The phone was a gift from her girlfriend Emma, they are on the verge of a break up now. The alcoholism and all that." He said with a wave of his hand.
"After you make tonight's announcement about taking a few days off... Would you like to stay at my flat? Just for the few days you are not working, that is. I think an actual bed and warm air would do you good, I have to admit that the wheezing is concerning me."
Sherlock looked to the figures approaching, smiling as he recognized the gait of Hughes from the other night. “I have a question about Hughes.” Sherlock said as he squeezed John’s hand.
Lestrade nodded, smiling nervously. “Right. Just hang tight for me and we will get this all sorted out for you.” Lestrade said softly
John's body tensed, his pupils pinpoint in that thousand-yard stare. "How can I trust you? Yes, you did save me, you saved my whole platoon. But how do I know you don't have a wire on you? Or that the cops aren't moments away in grabbing me?  This map can really fuck me over if the police got their hands on it, they will know where to watch for me." John was almost growling now beneath his black surgical mask, his nails digging into the table.
Sherlock makes it to Soho in time, only to find the Veterans running for their lives.
“Yes, Captain.” Briars said as she quickly raced to do as she was ordered, Hughes was already looking for an escape route.
"Wait! You are just going to leave me here!?" Sherlock asked, still rattled from everything that just happened. The Colonel sighed, walking back up to Sherlock and leaning down in his face.
The Captain goes about his normal duties during the daylight hours, only to be texted by an unknown number.
“Sherlock! That is absolutely insane!” John said with a scowl. “If I take a hostage then that will be added to my record! I will go to jail even longer!”
John checked his pockets as he stood in Avondale park, making sure he grabbed the essentials before leaving Baker street. Gun, ammo and his mobile phone. He smiled as he looked at Sherlock, those blue eyes stunning in the moonlight and dim city lights. “You know…” John said as he stood next to the man, eyes looking down the man’s hand next to his. “You didn’t have to come.”
"I can't believe it's you!" Said the little girl with a giggle as she was picked up by the Captain who placed her on his hip. "Mummy lets me stay up on the weekends to watch you! She says you are so nice!" The little girl said. She had to be at least six years old and was absolutely over the moon in meeting this stranger. It showed just how much the people of London trusted this man as the woman behind the camera stepped closer to peck a kiss to the man's face. The Doctor chuckled, it was a sweet sound to Sherlock's ears. But he couldn't focus on that now, he was looking at the background. Gathering details from the grainy, dark footage.
Sherlock was trying not to pace, he was trying to remain calm about all of this. Yes, this was his idea to have the Captain take a break and stay with him for a few days, but something was eating at him. That energy he felt when he touched the man's hand, the fluttering in his chest when he saw John's face as he took off his mask to eat at The Hub. He stared down at his left palm, flexing his fingers for a moment as Mrs.Hudson cooked in his kitchen. She was trying to make a nice meal for this stranger, this hero of London. She was talking to him, but there was this ringing in his ears that muffled any sound. "Mrs.Hudson?" He said quietly, the landlady peeking around the corner to observe the obviously flustered Detective. "I feel strange." He mumbled, raising his head slowly to look at her.
John was baring his teeth, Sherlock could see the tension in his jaw. "Why? Why are you helping me? You don't know anything about me!" He snapped, but never pulled his hand out of Sherlock's hold.
Sherlock sat down on his living room floor and turned on the television, it was almost midnight. It was almost time for the show to start, it always came on at midnight. Everyone was calling it 'The Captain's show', Sherlock called it evidence. He sighed, sitting cross-legged on the hardwood floor as he pressed the power button, the screen humming to life. He squinted at the bright light burning his eyes, maybe he was sitting a little too close? Who cared, he was far more interested in what tonight's 'episode' was going to bring. He sighed as he watched the static for five minutes before the screen came to life, his phone chiming from a text notification from Lestrade. The Inspector was probably asking him if he was watching the telly too. But he would ignore it for now.
“Stop flirting for a second.” Kaitlyn said, holding up her hand as the room grew silent, there was the soft sounds of boots on sidewalk outside the door. “One of ours?” She asked in whisper before the door tried to swing open before slamming shut again. Everyone grew tense, the three officers putting their hands on their service weapon.
“Whatever you say.” John said with an eerily cheerful smile as the inspector left, one SWAT member keeping a gun trained on the Captain.
"Do you really think I would come in here without protection of my own, Inspector Lestrade?" The Colonel asked as he slowly opened his unbuttoned flak jacket, revealing hand grenades with a string tied to each release pin. The Colonel held the string firmly in his hand, a twisted smile on his face. "Captain wants Sherlock here alive, but he didn't say I couldn't accidentally kill him if some hot-headed cop rubbed me the wrong way." He said as he took another calm drag of his cigarette. "I suggest you let me walk out of here."
"There's no smoking in here." Lestrade said seriously as he went to grab the cigarette from the Colonel's mouth, but that was a wrong move. The Colonel grabbed Lestrade's wrist like a vice, throwing him forward and placing a hard kick to the center of his back. Sending the Inspector tumbling to the floor at Mycroft's feet.
John chuckled quietly, burying his face into the man’s neck. “I like the sound of that.” He said with a smile, breathing him in. “Maybe curl up and watch some telly?”
“Nine!”
John found himself wandering again, his eyes glued to the sidewalk as he walked. He looked up and observed his surroundings, he was at Harrington Square Gardens. Better known as checkpoint Alpha. He sighed and decided to take a seat at one of the benches, tossing the duffel bag next to him as he leaned his head back and closed his eyes. He didn't get much sleep in his nights on the street. Between the live stream that lasted up to five hours, starting at midnight, to wandering the streets almost all day. He was exhausted.
Mrs.Hudson smiled, wiping her hands on a dishtowel before walking over to her tenant of several years and extending her right hand to take Sherlock's into her's. "Strange how?" She asked, rubbing a soothing, almost motherly like touch over his palm.
Sherlock decided to check his phone then, unlocking the phone with his thumbprint after clicking the text notification. His eyes widened in shock as he read the text from Lestrade. "We are ambushing the Captian, we have cops set up on every street corner and uncover cops out. He isn't getting away tonight.-GL" Sherlock looked back up at the television screen and gulped, oh no. He couldn't let this man be caught, he didn't know what it was, but his gut was yelling at him.
Right on que there was a noise outside, followed by shouting. It sounded like a large number of people, more than Sherlock planned for. The SWAT member at the door glanced over his shoulder, leaning down to speak into his radio. “What’s going on out there?”
The Captain looked down Wardour at Sherlock, their eyes met in the beautifully lit up street full of Chinese lanterns and the glow of neon signs of closed shops that surrounded them. Everything seemed to slow down, from the sound of sirens to the men and women screaming at him to make a decision. He blinked, his heart was beating slow as warmth overtook him. He swallowed hard, tilting his head at this stranger. He had no choice but to trust him. "Go! Follow him! Now!" Down Rupert Court!" The Captain said as he shook himself out of his trance, taking off with his platoon towards Sherlock who stepped aside to let the men and women rush past him. "You too!" The Captain said as he grabbed Sherlock by the shirt collar, nearly dragging him as he slid around the corner.
“What like a psychologist?” John asked with a smile, scoffing at the idea. “I don’t need someone poking around in my head.”
Sherlock swallowed hard, squeezing John’s knee now sympathetically. “John, I want you to stay with me. I want you to live at Baker’s street with me. I want to help you.” He whispered out, voice wavering as his eyes locked with John’s. “I want you to live the life Sam wanted for you.”
The homeless man's eyes light up as he took the folded blanket, he looked like he was going to cry. "Captain, I can't take this." He said in a whisper, his thumbs running over the coarse fabric. John smiled, placing his hand on the man's shoulder.
Sherlock looked to both ends of Wardour, shit, the cops. They were closing in the paths that lead to the Captain's only way out. No, not just the Captain. Twenty men and women came pouring around the corner of Lisle splitting up as ordered. The Detective looked behind him at Rupert court, there were no cops. He knew what he had to do. He took a deep breath and shouted as loud as he could to the men and women. "Captain! Over here! Down Rupert! There are no cops!" His throat stung, his lungs were burning. But he got their attention, they all stopped and looked in his direction.
John smiled, shaking his head as he squeezed the gun in his hand. “For you?” He asked, grabbing Sherlock by the collar and pulling him into an even rougher kiss. “I’d go through three more tours of Afghanistan for you.”
Sherlock was getting lost in some lewd thoughts just then. He was silently wondering if John could 'train' him in the same way. But the ding of the oven snapped him out of that. "Dinner is ready boys! You two just take a seat anywhere you like and I will bring you a plate!" Mrs.Hudson smiled as she passed Gladstone back to John, walking towards the kitchen as Sherlock directed the Captain to the living room chairs near the television.
The little girl giggled. “Mummy always said to stand up for what you believe in.” She said with a shrug of her own. “I believe in you, Captain.”
Lestrade let go of John’s throat, holding his hands up as he looked up at Sherlock. “Sherlock, have you lost your mind!? Why are you helping him!? He just held you hostage!”
"Oh yes, I have many connections to the homeless community. You see, they provide me with information as they are the least suspicious people to overhear conversations and such. Some would argue they are invisible to us 'civilians' as your little group calls us. For their information I provide payment. Either in money or food, it is a win-win situation all around."
"Hello again." John said with a chuckle, extending his hand towards Sherlock as he had done at The Hub. "I'm surprised you recognized me dressed like this." He said, motioning to his very plain civilian outfit consisting of a jumper and denim trousers. "I went to a second-hand shop and picked this up, I paid with cash of course. I couldn't have anything tracing back to me if I needed to leave this behind."
“Why does it have to be you?” Sherlock asked, squeezing John’s hand in his. “Can’t Briars and her partner take up the mantle? They seem quite competent.”
John rubbed his face, looking to his right to where the park was just a few kilometers away. He was playing a dangerous game meeting this stranger, but he was so curious and he was never one to run away from danger. "Sure, what time?" He texted back, already grabbing his bag and standing.
"Oh, thanks!" John yelled as he opened the door, grabbing the clothes Sherlock had set out before shutting the door again. "My uniform is in my bag, feel free to dig around in there if you want." John called from the shower now.
John scoffed at that. "Oh please, I think you are amazing." He said honestly, not looking up from the map. Sherlock blushed a deep red at that, it spread to the tips of his ears.
John nodded, setting down his duffel bag and unzipped it before rummaging around for a moment. "Here." John said with a smile as he pulled out a blanket, it wasn't much but it was something. It was his, but he could always get another, he still had some money in his account from his time in the military. He wouldn't get paid until the next month, but this man needed it more than him.
Sherlock nearly choked on his own spit, his blushing returning. Did this man just call him cute to his face? "Oh, I see." Sherlock said, coughing into his hand as he tried to recover from his shock. "About staying at my flat, are you willing to do that?" He asked, rubbing his chest.
Lestrade looked to the vent that was on the floor, then the ceiling. “Is she hurt?”
Sherlock broke into a sob, his hands resting on John’s hips. “I can’t.”
“Oh, that?” Sherlock asked, sighing. “My plan really, had to beg the Captain here to do it. Not his fault really, but mine. You can say that I held a gun to the back of his head.”
Lestrade sighed, running a hand through his well-deserved greying hair. “I’ll leave one in here, with the door open so you can see everything going on. Okay?” Lestrade asked as he started to pull his men back out of the room, keeping a close eye on the Medic as the team member left propped the door open with his foot.
“Six!”
"You got one thing wrong." John said with a smile beneath his mask.
"What's this?" She asked, a smile on her face as she carefully picked up the soaked notebook paper that had fallen into the puddle. "Did your boyfriend write you a little love note?" She asked, smirking to herself as she opened the note delicately. She scowled though, the fresh ink had smeared as it came into contact with the water, effectively making it useless trash.
Sherlock chuckled as well, he was so tempted to thread his fingers into the Captain's just then. "Maybe so, but you know I am right."
Sherlock hummed, giggling almost. “Something like that.”
"No sir, that number is accurate." Came the giggle again, the Captain blinked then looked back down at the camera. He looked surprised.
"What will he think when I do not leave in the morning?" John asked with a smile. "I hope you've already come out to him, I believe this would be an awkward way for him to find out." John said with a laugh.
“Scotland Yard police department! Everything alright in there? A flair was shot off in the park, we thought someone was in distress.” Lestrade said, his pistol out of its holster and the safety clicked off with an army of SWAT behind him holding automatic rifles. “Is there anyone else in there with you?”
“You know Colonel Moran isn’t going to like this.” Kaitlyn said seriously, folding her arms as she now scowled at the Captain. “You know how he feels about soldiers leaving the platoon. You know how he feels about-…” She stopped, looking down at the two men’s hands that were holding. A flash of fear went over her eyes, swallowing hard. “Captain, John… Please be careful. Please. You know how dangerous Colonel Moran is.” She whispered.
"You said you could run, I suggest you start running. Go to your flat, go to a shop. I don't care, just don't follow me around like some lost puppy. Okay?" The Colonel straightened back up before turning to run down the street, leaving Sherlock standing on the corner as the sounds of sirens came from the opposite direction of which this Moran fellow had started running. Sherlock was now seriously wondering what in the Hell he had gotten himself into.
John head side to side, stretching out the tense muscles in his neck as he looked at Lestrade with a scowl. “Maybe I do. Maybe I want to relive my days of painting Afghanistan’s sand with brain matter.” He growled out, sending a shiver down Sherlock spine. Dear god, why was that growl sending his blood flow south? “Maybe I want to shoot these two and take a couple of you out with me?”
Before Sherlock got a chance to speak, Mrs.Hudson was all over the puppy and cooing at it. "Oh, he is adorable!" She squealed, petting the puppy and squishing its little face gently. "Gladstone you said? What a wonderful name for an adorable baby! Of course, he can stay while you are here! Oh, I just want to make him a little sweater!" That made John chuckle, passing off the puppy to be loved on by the landlady.
“Sherlock, please go!” John pleaded.
Sherlock pressed his elbow over his nose and mouth, his eyes burning from the gas as he felt his way to the door. But a large hand grabbed him by the collar, dragging him out of the room and down the hall. He moved faster than the Captain, he was stronger than the Captain. "Take deep breaths, Civvy!" The Colonel yelled as he tossed Sherlock over his shoulder like some ragdoll cat. Sprinting out of the building and attracting the attention of many officers who were wondering what in the Hell was going on, the smoke alarms were going off in every corner of Scotland Yard.
“So you can shoot me?” John asked with a laugh, shaking his head. “No, I don’t think so.”
“We?” Kaitlyn said, looking at John who was trying to form a plan in his head quickly, he needed to get Briars and Sherlock out of there immediately. “I do hope you understand if I am a little skeptical about opening the door to the restroom in the dead of night for a stranger.” Kaitlyn said, trying her hardest to make her stalling more believable.
Sherlock tensed as he was dragged, even though he was about a foot taller than this Captain, he found it hard to keep up. He found himself focusing more on the Captain's face than the movement of his own body however, he was so... handsome. "Focus! Look ahead and run Civvy!" The Captain yelled at him, finally letting go of his collar to allow the Detective to run at his own pace. Rupert Court was a small alleyway, maybe two people could run side by side comfortably without tripping over one another.
Tears were streaming down Sherlock face as he looked up to Kaitlyn, his heart breaking in his chest. “I’m not worried about me. I am worried about those animals shooting John!” He hissed through his teeth.”
“Same here, though I didn’t make a list.” John said with a gentle smile, looking into Sherlock’s eyes. “Listen, if we make it out of here, I’ll take you on a proper date. One that doesn’t involve a public restroom and the cops.” John said seriously.
Sherlock shrugged. “Job security for me, I suppose.”
John was reeling from all of this. "What? My phone why do you need my phone for?" He asked, but Sherlock was staring at him so much intensity that he dug into his trouser pocket and pulled it out before passing it over. Sherlock took one glance at the front and then the back.
“Uh, what about me?” Hughes said.
Mycroft sat across from his little brother, casually sipping the tea that had been brought to him by Lestrade. His eyes burrowing holes through Sherlock who sat handcuffed across from him in the dimly lit room. "You know how this is going to go, Mycroft." Sherlock said seriously, eyes glimmering with rage as he too stared holes through his brother.
"Really, sir? Is this the time?" Asked one of the men in the crowd of Veterans, his flak jacket had the last name 'Hughes' stitched into the tan camouflage under the right breast pocket. Sherlock took the paper in his hands as he snuck a peek at the Captain's last name, only to find it had been skillfully cut off and discarded. The Captain chuckled.
“I let her go.” John said.
"I cannot say that I do, seeing as I never served. Though I can imagine the graphic scenarios that you were put through."
"It isn't like that, Mycroft." Sherlock spat hatefully. "You know the people of London look up to the Captain, you know they see him as their white knight! Just last week he stopped over fifty women and children from being sold off in some shipping container! Something Scotland Yard and 'you' failed to prevent! The only reason the cops arrived at that harbor was to arrest the Captain and the Veterans with him!" Sherlock was practically foaming at the mouth now in his anger, his fists slamming hard onto the metal table before him. "He is giving the people hope. Something I have never been able to do... Something none of us have been able to do. Why does that make him a criminal?" He asked quietly, looking up to his brother now. "Because the way I see it? It doesn't, it makes him a hero."
He arrived at the kettle, held his hand to it and found that it was hot, though empty of water.
If Sherlock Holmes had wanted people to like him, badly enough to go to all that, then why had he written such dry articles? Why had he covered his own home in poisons, and skulls, and other flashing signs that would have made any sane person want to keep out?
A flood of links populated the page, and he was shocked at the number--with a name like that, it probably wasn’t a coincidence.
John's reflection stiffened slightly, before taking a cautionary glance at the door he'd walked through.
The flat was much less sweet. It was a mess, and it was, erm. Eccentric. It definitely seemed like the lair of a psychopath. Apparently, the previous tenant was a mutual friend of Mike’s and the landlady’s, who had passed away a couple of years ago. I guess he was a strange bloke, who happened to have all of these odd heaps of junk piled everywhere that Mrs. Hudson couldn’t seem to part with. Even so, it's a nice change from where I am now.
He crossed the sitting room to his jacket, where it hung on the wall, and fished the keys he’d been given to the flat from the pocket of his jacket, then returned to the locked door.
Sherlock watched as the stranger's eyes descended upon his possessions: the red-yarned net, a physical map of Moriarty's metaphorical web, which still hung on one of the walls; the strange selection of books; the leather and steel armchair; the skull. The skulls.
. A dream of another time, of one who was once a stranger, and then a lover, and then a stranger again, echoed out from his memories.
It didn't add up, John thought, but he wasn't sure exactly how. He furrowed his brows, scrolling down past images of crime scene tape billowing in the wind beside a stationary ambulance, police standing as if for portraits, looking mournful and sick. He absently noted that it had been his own Alma Mater, St. Bartholomew’s, that they'd chosen as their death place.
He made a mental note to ask Mrs. Hudson for the key later--after all, this was his home now. He should at least know what’s in it. From the look of the place, John would only be half surprised to find a corpse behind that door, for christ’s sakes.
This is the first fic I've posted--in order to keep it realistic for me, I'm going to keep the chapters short for now, but may group them together in the future.
He picked up what appeared to be the log to the experiment, skimmed it, but found the net of black, needle-like writing unhelpful.
And dead.
Now that he was here, in this flat, it did seem a bit insane, didn’t it? To live with what remains of some dead, probably deranged…..
He said the name aloud to himself, repeated it in his mind. Even the man’s
Had he realized that this would happen when he’d jumped? Yes.
"What, milk?"
There was nothing, and then there was the stranger.
John stepped onto the last creaking step onto the second floor, nudged open the door to his new home, and dropped his armful of boxes in the living room. He pretended not to notice the sudden absence of his limp. He took a moment to look around at the flat, taking in more of the signs of the man who had once lived there--he smiled slightly, as he noticed the bright colors of the box to ‘Operation!’ shining incongruously in a corner, but was distracted by something more capturing--the dust swirled down before the curtains, reflecting, and forming a pillar of light that seemed to creep into the silent room. It made its way toward the floor in a ghostly procession of what might have been the man’s skin before it became dust.
The flat, in a manner of speaking, was the closest thing to a body that Sherlock currently possessed--it being a space which contained his soul, by any reckoning--and as such, its parts reacted to him when, on occasion, his presence was strong enough to dictate them. It hadn’t happened in so long, he nearly forgot that it
Automatically, he lathered his forearms, and rinsed in the mechanical way prone to doctors.
If he could have, Sherlock would have grimaced at the headlines John clicked on. Page after page of sullying tromp, countless online “news” sources repeating the same few pieces of sensationalist fluff, all painting Sherlock as a criminal mastermind.
"Here you go, love," she said easily, passing him a cup and saucer, complete with biscuits leaned onto the saucer's rim.
Even dead, Sherlock could sense that it was in disrepair. To think, he had to die to get Mrs. Hudson to stop dusting. All for the better, he thought.
“We’re out of tea,” He said, simply.
Thank you for reading! Also, while I wasn't writing as much, the "soundtrack" to this fic was made private (but I think of it as "under construction")--I'll link to it if/when I perfect it.
-before carefully placing it back on the table and digging out some soap to wash his hands.
The strangest part might not have been the flat itself, though...there were a couple of minutes when Mrs. Hudson insisted that Mike go downstairs with her to take a look at some old photos, and I was in the left in the place alone. It really was all a bit strange, but I swore that, for a moment, I saw this face in the mirror. It was probably a shadow on the wallpaper or something, but I felt like it was looking at me. God, Ella, if you’re reading this, please take it easy on me at our next appointment...but that was what made me sure that I could live there.
His previous guests had been, to put it nicely, complete and total idiots. Worse still, they had been lousy housemates. One had taken it upon herself to wash his plague-ridden petri dishes with liquid dish detergent, resulting in a nearly-fatal illness that had motivated her to leave the flat; another had begun selling Sherlock’s things on Ebay, to the very small (but surprisingly dedicated) “infamous fake genius” niche market; and yet another had been incredibly rude to Mrs. Hudson--not to mention that his idea of ‘hygiene’ had been to wash up in the shower with the same tattered tea-towel he used to clean everything else.
The landlady was nice. The sweet, absentminded type. She reminds me of my gran. Especially when she gave me biscuits with my tea, even though I hadn’t asked for any.
With the door unyielding, and John (as well as John’s bothersome hip, which had once again become stiff) unwilling to break it down, he resorted to more modern means of finding out about Sherlock Holmes.
He felt out into darkness, sensed Mrs. Hudson, and Mike Stamford with the stranger. Were they really trying to rent it again? Had Sherlock had eyes, he’d have rolled them at Mrs. Hudson’s unending quest to give an explanation to the sounds she heard from his flat at night.
He opened the cupboard directly over the kettle, and found what appeared to be an ancient box of crummy tea bags, a jar of black slime that John didn’t dare touch, and an oddly placed wooden spoon.
I was walking in the park and I bumped into Mike Stamford. We were sort of mates when we were students. We got coffee, and I told him about my situation, with the bedsit. He said that he knew of a flat near central London that I might be able to afford, naturally I wanted to go and see it.
Also, please take it easy on me.
He pushed his one small box labeled ‘kitchen’ across the linoleum with his foot, then looked up to notice for the first time that the kitchen table was still littered with the remnants of some kind of science experiment; out of curiosity, he picked up a petri dish and wiped the grime away from its inscription--
His devastation softened as the stranger shut off his computer and leaned back into his chair with a sigh. He was clearly exhausted, rings forming around his eyes--nightmares? Had Sherlock already given him nightmares? He could probably use a cup--
His eyes snapped open. He looked over into the kitchen, and of course, no one was in it.
Not tonight, he thought.
As Sherlock thought it, the kettle’s sound echoed from the kitchen, causing the stranger to jolt.
When the flat remained silent, he apparently resolved to take the advice given. He returned to the sitting room for a sheet of paper, listed a few grocery items--very few, Sherlock later realized--and then promptly left the flat. He forgot to lock the door, Sherlock thought, and the deadbolt slowly creaked itself around.
He cleared his throat, before going back to the other links.
There is an immortal part of one’s identity which livens to being addressed, and which drives us to respond in kind. Sherlock guessed, in the ponderings that followed the realization that ‘ghosts’ did exist in some capacity, that this was the source of most superstition--
It would be taking too much credit for Sherlock to claim that he scared them all away on his own--though he was glad to see them go, it was not always a conscious effort. When you’re a ‘ghost’, sometimes you make the effort to smash people’s things, wake them up from nightmares whilst your bleeding face looms over their bedside, sending them screaming from your home, and sometimes it just sort of...happens. Either way, in every previous case, his tenants’ prompt and often dramatic exits left him almost pleased, almost satisfied.
Sherlock could feel John thinking about him. It was cheating, he knew, but he couldn’t quite help it--the thoughts, like warm light, extended from him unseen and reached whatever existed of Sherlock there. It brought him to a slightly higher level of consciousness, as it always did. He didn’t bother contemplating the mechanics of it, but instead enjoyed the sensation of existing, thinking, seeing.
He glanced to Sherlock’s door again. Locked, still. Stoically guarding the secrets that could have answered these questions.
He continued to observe the newcomer with interest.
He turned the water off, and stood a moment.
he was doing.
John flexed his leg, noted the ease with which the muscles worked as they should.
"I'll take it," John said to Mrs. Hudson, more firmly than he'd intended.
The stranger made a doubtful hum before exiting the “news” websites, and switching over to the image results. The stranger earned a spiritual roll of Sherlock’s non-existent eyes by whistling to himself, and murmuring a zesty “Well, hello there,” to himself, and for an instant, Sherlock nearly felt something, some rose-coloured warmth, before devastation momentarily took hold.
Dying is a rather large commitment, he had come to realize, one he had rushed into rather hastily. He hadn’t even bothered to finish his last experiment, to solve his last case--he knew, now, that it had been the housemaid, but could tell no one. A small guilt, to accompany those unscalable ones which dominated his few scattered, cherished thoughts.
As the three of them got closer, their thoughts of Sherlock wheeled into him, and made him feel--in the echoing, distant way that he could feel--guilt. The energy they devoted to him for that moment allowed him a greater presence, great enough to watch his flat through their memories.
"I don't think it will be."
He was shocked to find a number of news articles about his suicide, especially ones with headlines in all caps, screaming from the page things like, “FAKE GENIUS DOUBLE-SUICIDE,” “SECRET AFFAIR OF MADMEN UNCOVERED,” and, “SHERLOCK JUMPS: THE DEATH OF INTELLECT.”
It was not nearly enough, and yet it was more than he could have asked for.
Based on the web of madness on the sitting room wall, it had seemed that maybe he was some sort of investigator?
Ah, yes. Psychokinesis.
Just as he was about to leave the subject for a moment, John decided to look at the image results. His eyebrows shot up.
He tried the door to Sherlock’s room, and was disappointed to find it locked.
Tranfixed to the image, there they were.
His unfamiliar creek on the stair had been enough to stir the scattered bits of Sherlock’s consciousness back into its entity. Sherlock felt him moving through the flat, as one feels slow ripples break over them underwater--he couldn’t see the man, not yet.
Being seen was an odd sensation.
In this state, he sometimes wandered. Memories, impressions sometimes washed over him--
Typical.
“Erm, there’s just one thing...don’t touch any of his things,” She said, seriously, her voice dropping to a whisper, her curled hand pressed into her chin. “He
“We’re out of tea,” he murmured to the empty flat.
He knew that he had little (if any) control of his comings and goings, but he attempted to dissolve his consciousness--he tried to see nothing, think nothing...but was disappointed when all his little world remained before him. In fact, he felt as aware as he had ever been--post-mortem, anyway.
Sherlock shook his head as Arthur grabbed him now, pulling him away from John. “Sherlock, they won’t shoot us. I promise you that they will not kill John.”
"You do?" He asked, watching John mark the locations carefully and with precision.
John held up his hand, stopping Sherlock there. “No, for some reason Colonel Moran has formed some sort of obsession with me and the feelings were not mutual. Ever since that man laid his eyes on me, he has been possessive, I do not know why either.” He explained, squeezing Sherlock’s hand tighter, hoping the Detective understood.
“I say we get a cab to the Gardens; you lost your jumper back in the restroom and it is awfully cold. I would hate for my Captain to get sick in this weather.” Sherlock said with a smile nipping at John’s bottom lip.
"Oh I salvaged a signal counter, would you like to know how many people you are currently staring at?" Asked the female with a knowing giggle.
John goes to meet the person who has been texting him at The Hub.
Lestrade growled, slamming his fist into the tile. “Sherlock, you absolute bastard! When Mycroft hears about this! - “
John stood now, still smiling. "What makes you think I am wearing boxers to begin with?" John asked with a wink, heading towards the shower now and leaving Sherlock stunned in his seat. Oh the mental images he was having now.
"I have to say, the Colonel really knows how to put the fear of God into a man. Is he a sniper? Possibly a Marine Sniper?"
"You let them getaway! You let the whole lot of them getaway! We had them cornered, you damn fool! You do realize we were playing the Captain's live footage to track him right!? We know you just aided in the escape of those men and women! You aided in the escape of a damn criminal!" Shouted Lestrade who was already pulling out handcuffs to restrain the Detective, several more cops arrived in cruisers and on foot to surround him.
“John! We don’t have time! Please!” Sherlock said in a rush, taking John’s gun from his holster and placing it in the medic’s hand. He looked deep into his eyes. “Please.” He whispered. “For me.”
Sherlock was panting hard as they all exited out of Rupert Court and onto Rupert street, Sherlock knew this city like the back of his hand. "Captain, if you and your platoon keep heading down Rupert Street, to the right, then take a left onto Shaftesbury Avenue you will come to Piccadilly Circus Station on your left. You can go underground and lose them!" Sherlock said through sharp gasps, resting his hands on his knees. Everyone was looking at him oddly, a familiar look he had grown used to by now. But the Captain? He was smiling at him beneath his mask. "Or... Or you can just split up at Piccadilly Lights in the center in either direction you choose." Sherlock mumbled, suddenly feeling shy with the Captain's gaze on him.
"Leave that to me, Ms.Donovan." A soothing voice called from behind her, causing Sally to turn and step aside to reveal Mycroft. He looked amused, stepping forward to his little brother who looked anything but pleased to see him. "If there is one person on this Earth that can pry secrets out of a steel trap, it is me."
“Shit, backup is fourteen blocks away.” Kaitlyn hissed as she put her hand on her service weapon. “Should we call it in?” She asked John, looking over her shoulder.
Sherlock sighed with a smile, shaking his head at how silly, yet how happy Mrs.Hudson was. "Her word is law in this flat, so yes, he can stay with us while you are here. I would hate for him to go without his training and lose any progress you have made." The Detective said seriously. "Though I would like to see the commands you have taught him, I use to have a dog myself as a child. Though I never really trained him, he was more of a best friend that I got into trouble with."
John smiled up at Sherlock, their hands lightly touching again. "Thank you, it hasn't been easy balancing work and training, but there has been a lot of progress with him."
"Nothing. Nothing at all." Sherlock mumbled, staring at the cafe now.
Most episodes started in some alleyway or under a bridge, but not tonight. Tonight it showed the Captain himself, but not his full face. No, no that would be too much help in identifying this man. He had a mask on that covered the lower half of his face, just up to the bridge of his nose. His eyes were a steely blue, his hair a greasy, greying blonde that was combed back with some effort. It was obvious to Sherlock that this Captain had some sort of a beard growing, it wasn't wild or messy. Just enough facial hair to distort the outline of his jaw, smart really. "Are we live?" Asked the Captain to a person off-screen, perhaps another Veteran who was running the IP address scrambler that Scotland Yard had yet to crack, not even Mycroft's little army could decode it. The signal and live feed had to be run by a Military coder, probably something out of date and discarded, the sound of a gas generator hummed in the background.
John rested his chin in his hand now, staring at the couch that was up against the wall on the other side of the room. “Five years ago, but the image of Sam bleeding out in the desert sand will always stick with me.” The medic choked up now, biting the finger that rested against his lips. “Those blue, lifeless eyes staring at me as I was drug away in a Hell storm of gunfire.”
"By your instructions, Captian." Sherlock dug out a map from his peacoat and spread it across the tabletop. "I know you have a pen, Captain. I want you to mark the locations of your patients, then I want you to write on the back the health concerns of your patients and the medicines they need."
John blinked, oh he was 'really' starting to like this guy. "But how would they know which people to provide medical treatment to and what medicine to give?" He asked curiously.
Briars looked deflated, Hughes spun back around to show his surprise with wide eyes and his mouth slightly agape. “What?” Hughes said, looking equally deflated. “You’re leaving? Why?”
John hummed, pressing a kiss to the Detective’s cheek now as his eyes adjusted to the dark. Smiling as he looked the man over, his hands coming to rest on Sherlock’s cheeks. “I apologize for dragging you into that mess, I also apologize for hitting the back of your head with the barrel of my gun.” He whispered, finding himself pushing Sherlock gently backwards up against the wall, his hands sliding down to Sherlock’s waist.
“Remember our deal, Sherlock. I need someone to take care of Gladstone if I get in trouble.” John said pointedly as Hughes stepped up and started ripping off the vent with all his strength. “That dog could track me down in a tornado, you have to trust me.”
“Guys!” Kaitlyn yelled.
Now Sherlock Holmes wasn't a man that easily caught feelings, so to speak. He prided himself on his cold demeanor towards people and liked to keep his 'friends' just out of arms reach, for their own safety of course. But there was something about the way this Captian looked at him that just made the world feel... whole again. He sighed, looking down at the notebook paper he held in his hands for a moment before opening it. He blushed madly as he realized the Captain had written down a phone number. Oh. Oh, dear. He felt like his heart was going to explode as the tips of his ears turned red. But the feeling didn't last long as he was tackled harshly to the ground, the paper landing in a puddle just a few inches from his hand. "What the fuck do you think you are doing, Sherlock!?" Came an all too familiar voice. Goddammit, Lestrade.
To say John was surprised would be an understatement, this really wasn't what he was expecting when he came to The Hub. "Um, okay." He mumbled as he pulled a pen from his trouser pocket and started to mark the locations. "You think of everything, don't you?" John asked with a smile, glancing up at Sherlock as he worked.
“Do you think this is some sort of game?” The inspector growled, popping his neck as he leaned it side to side. “You took two men hostage just to buy your mob out there some time? You coward, you absolute bastard! You aren’t getting away from here to easily, you are finally in a corner where I can get a good look at you.” Lestrade reached up to grab John’s mask, only to have the Medic swiftly connect his forehead to the inspector’s nose.
“Funny you say that.” Sherlock said, holding John’s pistol down in Lestrade’s face. “My brother calls me a glorified imbecile.”
"As many times as you can!" She teased, going back to the stove as there was a loud knock at the door at the bottom of the stairs.
Sherlock chuckled, not minding that John was holding his hand for just a little too long. No, he didn't mind it at all. "That is quite alright, but that cannot be healthy for your mind. You need to stay sharp, Captain. After all, you are trying to make this world a better place."
"Yes you can, think of it as an early Christmas present from me. Okay? Besides, I don't need you getting hypothermia, it's supposed to snow tonight." John zipped up his bag before standing and starting to walk away, he didn't want to give the man another chance to argue with him about it. Homeless people were generally very humble, some didn't want any help at all. They felt ashamed of their situation, even if how they got on the streets was a series of bad luck.
"Like Hell you can! You were winded running from your flat to Soho last night!" Yelled the Colonel over the sound of the alarms as they busted through the front doors and onto the sidewalk. "The Captain says to give him a call anytime." The Colonel said as he sat Sherlock down on the sidewalk, an adrenaline-filled smile on his face. "Or a text, whatever you want, just pick up a burner phone. Can't have them pinpointing the Captain can we?" The Colonel asked with a wink as he started walking towards Big Ben.
“Miss?” Lestrade called, knocking hard on the door. “Miss is everything alright in there? We really need you to open the door for us. I promise you that you are safe.”
John smiled, standing as well as he placed his mask back on. He took Sherlock's hand into his, squeezing it tight. "Call me John, Sherlock. It was nice meeting you too." Sherlock's heart fluttered in his chest, he was finally able to put a name to the face of the legendary Captain.
John laughed now, ruffling her hair as he holstered his weapon. “Deal, now, run along. Get home safe for me.” The little girl said her goodbyes and ran off into the night away from the shouting mob that was outside. “I have a gut feeling she is going to grow up to be a convict.”
“We won’t shoot you, okay? No one must die tonight. Why don’t you tell me what has you all worked up tonight? What made you so upset?” Lestrade looked at Sherlock who was busying himself with counting the tiles on the floor, but also playing a convincing role of the hostage. “Maybe we can get you some help?”
“Seven!”
Sorry for such a short chapter, today is family dinner day.
Slowly both men let go of the other as John took the seat across from Sherlock, resting his arms on the table and rubbing his cold hands together. "I am just taking care of the people this world has forgotten about." He said with a shrug, he couldn't look away from the Detective's eyes. They were pulling him in.
"Well they certainly get straight to the point and I haven't seen a dangerous-looking one of them until today." Sherlock said with a smile as he rubbed his wrists as the handcuffs were taken off, the Colonel chuckled at that.
“Where is the girl?” Lestrade asked gently. “Where was the girl I was speaking to?”
Sherlock inhaled lightly, his eyes lighting up. "He is here, just like he promised he would be." He whispered, flinging open his flat door and racing down the stairs. He stopped though, giving himself a once over in the reflection of a photograph that hung on the wall. He looked, okay or decent really. He had showered and dressed appropriately just a few hours beforehand, black trousers and a silk purple dress shirt. He shook his head, catching himself acting silly, this was merely a friend. Nothing more. He sighed before opening the door. "Hello." He greeted about as tamely as he could, but electricity once again shot through his body as he met those steely blue eyes and that trademark smile.
"Yes sir." Came a female's voice, the sound of a metal chair moving against the concrete could be heard before footsteps approached. The camera was pointed at the Captain's face, obviously hiding what their current surroundings were. Also smart, the Detective thought to himself. This Captain knew what he was doing.
John chuckled; mask pulled up over his nose once more even though he was dressed in the clean clothes Sherlock provided him after his shower. “I just hope Gladstone behaves for Mrs. Hudson, though I have a feeling that when we come back, he will be dressed in a freshly knitted sweater made just for him.”
John choked and grabbed the hands around his throat, Lestrade smiled up at him. “I’ve been in more fights than you’ve ever been, ‘Captain’.” Lestrade growled out. “Don’t think just because you’re some glorified hobo that you can kick my ass!”
“Oh, I’ve been waiting for this since you gave me the slip at the China Gate.” Lestrade said with a breathy laugh, holding his fists up. “You are coming to Scotland Yard with me tonight.”
Sherlock is taken to Scotland yard for interrogation, conducted by his brother Mycroft. Will Sherlock be able to stave off his brother's questions? Or will the number the Captain gave him be pulled from his mind by force?
“Do you have a mobile on you? Go ahead and call the police station to verify it is the police. I understand that you are scared to open the door for me, you make a good point about opening the door for a male knocking on the women’s restroom.” Lestrade said with a small chuckle, trying to sound harmless.
"Oh dear, little brother. Could it possibly be true?" The eldest asked as he leaned forward, closing the gap between them. "Are you in love?"
Kaitlyn stepped into one of the stalls, swallowing hard before hollering. “I’m in here! Just a minute!”
John pulled Sherlock into a deep kiss, holding him close as electricity shot through both of their bodies, hands tangling deep into Sherlock’s curls. “Please.” John whispered, inches from the Detective’s lips. “Please go.”
“My, oh my. Sherlock Holmes, the Sherlock Holmes I presume?” Kaitlyn asked as she approached with her partner Arthur Hughes who nodded with a soft smile to the Detective.
“If I don’t?” Lestrade asked angrily.
"I have never felt 'love' before, Mrs.Hudson. You know I consider it a chemical defect that causes you to lose focus, a chemical defect that causes you to make mistakes." He said seriously, dropping his hand to his side.
"I like you, Civvy." The Captain said with a hearty laugh, patting Sherlock lightly on the back who couldn't help but blush. "Here." The Captain said as he pulled a notepad from his left trouser pocket, scribbling something down in pen before ripping the paper and passing it to the Detective.
"Don't worry about the note, Sally." Lestrade said as he pulled Sherlock off the ground. "Sherlock here has the mind of a steel trap, remember? All we have to do is pry it out of him."
Sherlock cocked a brow, studying Kaitlyn’s demeanor and to where she looked. “John?” Sherlock asked quietly, turning towards the Captain now, hand still in his. “Were you and Colonel Moran a-…”
Mycroft sighed, rubbing his temples as his elbows rested on the table. His eyes closed as he opened his mouth to speak. "Sherlock, please listen to yourself right now. You sound like one of those people who are star struck by this man. A vigilante who has taken the law into his own hands! We have copy cats running in the streets in second-hand military gear! We have protests demanding the protection of this man! This has thrown London into chaos! Why are you protecting him!?" Mycroft asked in a shout.
"Because he served this goddamn country in Afghanistan! Doesn't he deserve to have someone at his back now that he is home!?" Sherlock growled back, his teeth clenched tight.
Sherlock smiled, taking John's hand into his, both men reveled in the strong energy that never died as skin once again met skin. The Detective couldn't help but fall in love with the feel of the calloused hands in his, the hands of a man who worked tirelessly with them. "The black surgical mask is a slight giveaway now." He said with a smirk. "That and how could I forget a face like yours?" Sherlock blushed suddenly as John chuckled, his grip still firm in his hands. Did he just flirt?
“I would read you off the list I made of all the reasons I love you, but I feel like now would be a bad time.” Sherlock said with a smile, rubbing the back of his neck, looking down at the tiled floor of the restroom. John chuckled, rubbing his arm now.
“John.” Sherlock said quietly, his heart hurt for the man.“You couldn’t have saved them, not from a headshot directly to the center of the skull. The chances of living from a fifty-caliber bullet to the brain are next to none.” The Detective said gently, knowing statistics helped him feel better. But he was not sure it would help John any. Grief was grief and it always took time to process. “How long ago did they pass away?”
“Two!”
Sherlock could not run twenty-one miles, and he was not sure if the Captain could either. Sherlock pulled John into an alley way off Lansdowne Road and into the shrubbery next to a little bare patch in between some houses. John and he began to laugh in the dark, pulling each other into a tight hug, swaying with each other in their arms. “That was quite the night, Captain.” Sherlock purred into John’s ear, pressing a kiss into his blonde hair.
Oh? This was... odd. John leaned forward now, elbows resting on his knees as he held the phone in both hands. He was trying to think, but his exhausted mind was coming up with nothing. "Who is this?" John asked again.
"Four million? That is half of London..." He said with his own nervous laugh, rubbing the back of his neck as he held the camera a little higher. "Hello!" He waved to the camera, laughing. "I can't believe you all find this entertaining... We are just a bunch of homeless Veterans trying to make a change for the better." He mumbled, a blush spreading to his ears. Sherlock gulped, God he was cute. "Alright, I am going to cover the camera for about thirty minutes to get the Hell out of here and meet with some others from the platoon. I'll uncover it when I get to the location." He said to the camera, digging in his flak jacket pocket for the camera lens. "See you all in just a moment." The Captain said before the cap was placed on, it was nothing but sound at that point.
John jumped though when he heard his phone ding with a message, odd, usually his sister called him. Never a text message. He dug into his trouser pockets and pulled out his old flip phone, opening it to see a text from an unknown number. The message simply stated. "Thank you." John blinked at it for a few moments, tilting his head like a golden retriever as he tried to guess who the hell this was. It could be anyone.
"What's wrong?" Sherlock asked who took his seat back across from the Captain.
"Who is this?" John texted back.
Sherlock nodded, turning back to the washer as he loaded the clothes in. He hit start and sighed, wondering if he had just made his first mistake with the Captain.
“Harrington Square Gardens!” John said with a smile. “Where I was when you first texted me!”
Sherlock scoffed, but couldn't help the corners of his lips turning up into a smile. Mrs.Hudson was wonderful to be around. "I suppose that is an accurate deduction, though I can't help but wonder if I am making a mistake. Me of all people, Mrs.Hudson, to make a mistake."
“Where is Check Point Alpha?” Sherlock asked, squeezing John’s hand in his as they ran.
“One!”
Sherlock shook his head, pointing at the shower again, a smile spreading across his face. "Take a shower Captain, that's an order." He teased.
“Oh shit.” Arthur whispered.
Sherlock couldn't help but chuckle at that, hanging his head and shrugging his shoulders lightly. "How many times do I need to apologize for that before you let it go?" He asked, making Mrs.Hudsone giggle as she turned back to the kitchen.
The Captain shrugged, smiling down at the camera as he walked over to where the streaming was operated. "Sure, enlighten me." He said, squinting his eyes at something. "That can't be right, turn it off and on again."
Sherlock smiled. “Why on Earth would I need a plan? You already called in the reinforcement.” Sherlock said with a wink, making Arthur look away in surprise.
The young girl sighed, putting the bat over her shoulder. “Okay, fine…” She grumbled like she was just told to wash up for dinner. “But I want to pet your puppy one day that I saw on the telly.”
"What on Earth is that?" The Detective asked, just in time for John to pull out a four-week-old English bulldog from the canvas bag.
"You're right, I apologize." The Captain said as he pointed to the right. "Let's all split up at Piccadilly Lights and meet back at checkpoint Omega." The camera that was streaming live footage was still rolling, the Captain couldn't outright say where Omega was. Even if he did want this very... stunning civilian to meet up with them there. "Everyone ready?" The Captain asked the platoon who responded with 'Yes, sir' before they all started off down Rupert Street. The Captain, however, stopped about fifteen feet from Sherlock and turned back to face him. "Thank you for your help." He said with another warm smile before taking off down the road. "Hope to see you again!" He yelled, leaving Sherlock standing in the middle of the street.
Sherlock frowned, offering a tissue gently to his new friend who took it with a shaking hand. “I’m sorry for your loss.” He said meekly, leaning forward now to place a hand on John’s knee. “But Sam would not want you to hurt like this, they knew the dangers of war. You knew the dangers of war.”
"Oh! Look, Sherlock!" Mrs.Hudson said as she quickly moved to click on one tweet, it was a video of the Captain with a small girl dressed up in a similar uniform, they both looked so happy to see each other. Mrs. Hudson clicked play and stepped back as the video started.
"Still, you must take a break once in a while." Sherlock said seriously, straightening his back. "Maybe announce on the television during your live stream that you need to take a little break. There is no shame in taking care of your personal health."
Sherlock looked down at the file, setting his plate aside to pick up the envelope. "Mostly speculations about your identity, all wrong might I add. They can't even pinpoint you from a military database without your name or full facial features. My brother is currently running a full-fledged scan with every soldier in the British Military who has been home within a year." John nodded slow, chewing his food and swallowing slowly.
John blinked, nodding slowly as he lowered the pistols. Quite impressed by the little girl’s aim, dead center in the teeth. “Thank you, but you should really get going, honey.” He explained gently. “A war zone is no place for a kid.”
"Who on Earth could that possibly be?" Mycroft asked as he stood from his chair but froze as a towering, very built, strawberry blonde appeared behind Lestrade. He had the eyes of a serial killer, the smile of a criminal mastermind. A sniper, cold-blooded, the name under his right breast pocket read 'Moran'. Mycroft's face must have spoken everything he was thinking for this man laughed. Lestrade stepped aside, looking to his partner with a look of concern.
The man raised his head, blinking in confusion for a moment before a smile spread across his face. "Captain?" He asked as John pressed a finger up to his covered lips to signal him to lower his voice. But he was smiling too, it was good to know that the homeless people could see through his civilian disguise. "I'm okay, just cold... You know how it is." The man said with a chuckle, rubbing his arms. "I don't think anyone here is sick, just trying to stay out of other peoples' way."
“Miss I need you to open the door, we just need to check that everything is alright.” Lestrade said, shoulder pressed to the wall just outside the door.
"I'll tell you that in a moment." John said, his voice sounded flat. Almost sad. "It's a uh... Long story."
“Eight!”
Lestrade almost flinched as the gun was aimed a little too close to home, scowling at the three as they carefully stepped over the unconscious SWAT member and ran into the night. They could hear the mob all around them, shouting and throwing things. “This way!” John yelled as he took Sherlock’s hand, running for Walmer Road. “Hughes! Split up! Find Kaitlyn if you can! Meet us at Check Point Alpha!” He called back to Hughes who broke off from the group and ran into the mob.
"Captain, this is not a trap. I promise you this isn't a trap. I am just trying to help you." Sherlock said, his hand sliding to John's wrist and grabbing it lightly.
“Sherlock! Come on! I am worried about Arthur too! He can’t fit in the vent either! It will be okay; they can handle themselves.” She whispered back, eyes pleading.
John hummed, nodding slightly as his lip was bit. A gasp threatening to leave him. “That sounds like a wonderful idea Detective.”
Hughes shook his head, taking back his pistol from John. “We should get going while the mob is distracting the police. Kaitlyn is probably out there stirring the pot to buy us time.”
"If this was a trap, Captain. Why would I choose an open-aired location? A location where you can see your entire surroundings? A location without cameras, might I add. The Hub is surrounded by glass, you can see through the entire cafe! No, if I were going to trap you, I promise you it would be far more elaborate than this. Perhaps in a warehouse with few exits, hell, a warehouse with nothing but a wall to your back. I am trying to help you."
“Miss if you do not open the door then we will be forced to break it down!” Lestrade yelled, becoming impatient with the stalling.
Mycroft froze, calmly blinking as a smile spread across his face. "Afghanistan? Why Sherlock... Did you deduce this man in your short time with him?" He asked, his hands folding calmly on the table as his head tilted ever so slightly. Shit, Mycroft was reading him now. "You did, didn't you? What else did you pick up on, little brother? Perhaps a name? The day he came back from war? Perhaps an injury?" Sherlock looked up and away at the ceiling, praying to whatever God was listening to strike Mycroft down right now. "Interesting, little brother... Very interesting. I am no longer interested in the phone number he gave you, for it seems you have more vital information tucked away."
“Ten! SWAT move in! Move in!” Lestrade yelled as the SWAT began to beat down the door, the wood splintering with each hit of the ram. There was a hole made in the door next to the handle, an officer reaching in to loosen the knot on the door made by the jumper tied to it. The door flung open and SWAT moved in with Lestrade leading with his pistol drawn. Lestrade’s heart stopped as he saw the situation in the restroom, Sherlock and Arthur down on his knees with John standing over them. Two pistols in the Captain’s hands with the barrels pressed to the back of each of their skulls. “Whoa! Whoa! Hold it! Hold it!” Lestrade ordered the team, holding his arms out to pull the men back. He held his arm out to John, palm outwards. “Listen, you don’t want to do this.” He pleaded with the Medic.
