This went on for several minutes, that seemed hours to the doctor, until Lestrade called them for a new case.
Sherlock ignored the question and John kept on looking at the empty cupboards to find something to eat. Then, he opened the fridge, saw a head in there and suddenly closed the door "Oh!" exclaimed John, opening the fridge again to see that he was not hallucinating. No, he wasn't. There was a head in their fridge.
Once Mrs. Hudson had left, Sherlock and John stared at each other for a long time realizing how lucky they were to have each other.
"It's Greg! And no, I did not come to spy on you. I came because I need you to help me with a case" replied the Detective Inspector, clearly pissed at the fact that Sherlock still didn't know what was his name.
"You've already heard me, Sherlock", replied John looking down at his feet with flushing red cheeks. The detective, though, didn't respond to that. He just stood there looking at John, with a frown, clearly confused. How could someone as great as John love him? How was he supposed to react? He couldn't think clearly; he was, somehow, paralyzed and as much as he wanted to, he found that he was not able to express how he was feeling; he was too shocked to even speak. So he just stood there, in front of John, whose face saddened when Sherlock didn't say anything.
"So, as I was saying, a week after that, something really weird happens; drunk driver, totally smashed, the cops are chasing him and he turns into the drive of the Anderson's house to try and get away, but he crashes with a car, causing a huge explosion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They arrived to the crime scene, where Sally Donvan greeted both the detective and the doctor with disgust, but neither of them gave it a lot of importance. They went upstairs to see the body of a woman. Sherlock started examining it, looking for evidence and after a while he asked for her suitcase and when Lestrade told him there was no suitcase when they found the woman and, out of the blue Sherlock screamed "Brilliant" Oh, clever!" and left the room, with a very confused John and Lestrade.
"Oh... Sorry to interrupt you boys! I'll give you some privacy", she said smiling and leaving the room.
Sherlock was not really an emotional person so when he felt such strong feelings like the ones he was experiencing at that moment, the only way he found to express them was to play violin. So that's what he did; he couldn't even look at John because it hurt him. It hurt him to know that his love wouldn't be reciprocated. It hurt him to ignore John and see the concern on his face, but he couldn't talk to him; he just couldn't... 'Sentiment' thought Sherlock to himself smiling sadly 'What a waste of time.' However, the detective couldn't help but to feel a hollow inside him. He had always felt it but learnt to live with it; now, however..., it intensified... His head was being ruled by his emotions right now; he couldn't think clearly; he was overwhelmed by his own emotions. He had never felt like this before... He was beside himself.
"John." The doctor turned around to see him standing there in front of him. He was thinner than usual; his cheekbones were more marked than ever; the detective's dark curls were a little bit messy and longer that they used to be; he had a slightly pained expression on his face.
Once in the street, Sherlock had a huge, genuine smile plastered on his face; he purposely had attempted to look good to impress John, and it seemed to work because, even though the doctor thought Sherlock didn't see him, the detective saw his friend's cheeks blush and how he was staring at him. Despite that, Sherlock didn't believe John could like him.
While having dinner, Angelo congratulated Sherlock for having found a partner finally but John, nervous and tense, claimed, for the second time today that they were not dating but the man ignored it and brought them some candles to make it more romantic. Then, John felt intrigued and asked Sherlock about his love life "So, erm, do you, eh, have a girlfriend?" he asked "Girlfriend?" replied Sherlock "No, not really my area" he said. John frowned, confused, and then he realized what he meant "Oh, so a boyfriend then? Which is fine, by the way" Sherlock then looked at John straight in the eye, making him feel shivers down his spine "I know it's fine." said the  detective dryly. "Okay, okay... So, do you have a boyfriend then?" insisted the army doctor while licking his lips. Sherlock looked at him again and simply said "No." John then said "Okay. Unattached. Single. Like me..." and all of the sudden Sherlock seemed to realize something, looked John straight in they again and said "John... I think that you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I am flattered by your interest, I am not looking for any..." Sherlock's speech was interrupted by John almost choking on his drink and saying "No no I wasn't hitting on you, no." But then John thought to himself  'I wasn't hitting on him, right? I'm straight... I have no doubt of that... or do I?' but he left those thoughts aside and continued eating his dinner until Sherlock saw the supposed murderer and started running after him, causing John to follow him as well.
The detective always tried his best to deny his feelings for his best friend and flat mate John Watson because he had always thought that love was a generous disadvantage, a human error... Now though, it was different, he wasn't able to divorce himself from his feelings anymore, because, as much as he pretended to be emotionless, it was true: he had fallen in love with John Watson.
Mrs. Hudson was doing the dishes when, suddenly, she heard the front door opening. The woman grabbed the pan she was washing and prepared to go out to see who was sneaking into the flat. Once she opened the door she couldn’t believe her eyes. After her initial shock, she started screaming waving her hands frantically in the air
"I'm going to see Lestrade" plainly replied the detective while putting on his trench coat and scarf.
"No, but then I never am." He said sadly. John had never seen Mycroft so concerned and sad... He had had to deal with Sherlock's addiction many times in the past.
"You really care about him, don't you?". John looked at him without knowing quite well what to answer to that. Of course, he cared about him, he loved Sherlock...
"That's it" said John "how did I do?" asked, quite unsure of how to feel. He was trying to do what Sherlock did, and he was extremely nervous, since he really wanted to impress him, even though he knew that he didn't do as good as the detective would've. He really admired the way Sherlock never missed any details about anything. John thought that what his friend did was brilliant; deducing people's lives just by looking at them or at some object related to the person... It was extremely fascinating.
During the journey, the detective was concerned; were they going to tell people that they were dating? He was afraid that besides being stupid, Sally Donovan could be a homophobe as well...
"Intuitions are not to be ignored, Doctor. They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend."
Not much after, John started to unbutton Sherlock's shirt and when he was about to take it off, the detective pulled back a little bit, as if he felt embarrassed to show his body. John's eyes looked a bit sad now. For what horrible things might he have had to go through to feel so embarrassed of himself? John felt really sorry for Sherlock and gave him a warm smile and kissed him very softly on the lips and that was enough for the detective to know that for John he was perfect. This way, he slowly took his shirt off, timidly, looking at the doctor while he did so.
A week had passed and the situation didn't improve: Sherlock was still moping around and bogged in bitterness and resentment. John was desperate, he didn't know what to do. It hurt him real bad to see his best friend and man he loved to be in such pain and not being able to help.
John started telling him that he had visited Molly that day and that they have become really close since his suicide and, after a while, he couldn't help it but to start crying. It was all too much, he couldn't do that anymore, so he told Sherlock that he wouldn't visit him anymore, because it was too painful; it was too painful to talk to him and not have an answer, it was too painful not to hear his voice nor his laugh, not to see him... It was just too much pain to handle and John felt like he couldn't take it anymore because every time he went there to talk to the detective, he ended up crying uncontrollably; he wasn't even talking to Sherlock, just to his grave, he needed to move on and get over his best friend's death, as difficult as it could be, he had to learn to live with the pain.
He went back to the living room with the stash on his hands. Sherlock was now awake and when he saw his best friend he opened wildly his eyes. No. He couldn't have found it. Sherlock felt sick. He had been clean for a whole year now, but he still kept the stash, just in case. Those days he had felt the need of doing drugs again to escape from all those sentiments he had been having, but then he thought about John and how going back into his old habits would let him down, and he didn't touch them. But now, his best friend had found them and he could see all the concern, anger and disappointment in his eyes. Sherlock didn't say anything, he just sat there in silence looking at John who went to the kitchen, broke the needle and the tube with his bare hands and proceeded to flush the stash in the toilet. He then walked in the living room again and yelled
After explaining to Mrs. Hudson the details of how Molly helped him to fake his death, Sherlock went upstairs to where he used to live with John. Everything was exactly as he left it.
To his surprise, Sherlock wasn't awake yet. His heart sunk a little when he noticed the absence of his flat mate. 'What on Earth is wrong with me?' thought to himself the doctor. Not long after John had sat in his armchair and grabbed his laptop to write on his blog the recent case Sherlock had solved, the detective came out of his room, already dressed with his button up shirt and slacks. The shirt, was his purple shirt, the one that was a little too tight around his chest. It seemed that he had brushed his dark curly hair, or at least attempted to. John couldn't help it but stare at Sherlock. He looked handsome. The doctor could feel a slight brush spreading over his cheeks; he started "reading" the newspaper so his flat mate couldn't see his face blushing. "Where are you going, Sherlock" asked, curious and clearly nervous, John.
"Don't worry, then. Plus, why would we tell her about us anyway?" said John laughing a little in order to downplay a little bit the issue.
Mrs. Hudson asked "What are you on about?". The slender man looked up from the microscope, again, thrilled, and screamed "Clostridioum Botilinum! One of the deadliest poisons on Earth!"
There was a short silence that made it easier for the two men to notice that it was raining outside. The silence, though, was broken by the detective replying to John's comment
"Sherlock, I love you and I am not embarrassed or ashamed of you okay? I was stupid and I am sorry" said the doctor with a little smile on his face, not looking at the consulting detective because he was afraid that he would be mad. The taller man though, was now smiling too and he hugged John.
He arrived to the flat soaking wet and trembling from cold and saw Lestrade there, sitting in his armchair, probably to talk to Sherlock about some case. "Hey there, John! I was just telling Sherlock about this new case..."
"Good morning Sherlock" he said. No response. John was still concerned about his friend and asked him
"The figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner has been here, the picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains." The detective paused shortly and kept on talking
"and so is the future" Sherlock got a little closer to John, who stil was not understanding what was going on
"Did I just make the stoic, supposed to be an emotionless machine, world's only consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes, blush?" said the doctor now hugging the taller man from behind
"It's wrong" he paused briefly "Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed. Almost verging on OCD"
"But I have been feeling a bit nostalgic lately, so I think a visit will be good, to revive memories and all... Also, I should see Mrs. Hudson, since I didn't keep contact with her after... Well, after you died" he was trying to hold back his tears before continuing
The police arrested Marty Reed, and he confessed it all. After that, Sherlock and John went back to their flat.
"What are you talking about, Sherlock?" asked the doctor nervously and laughing a little. Sherlock, simply said
Mot much after Sherlock put his violin down and turned the TV on. For his surprise, there was a classical music concert playing. He smiled, turned to John, who was sitting on his armchair and asked in a barely audible voice
John's jaw almost hit the floor when he heard that. 'Sherlock? A junkie? No way' he thought to himself. Mycroft kept on talking
On their way there, John had told Sherlock to be gentle with Neil, since that was a difficult time for him, so the consulting detective, following his friend's advice, started asking him about simple things like her daily routine, people who were close to her...
"What?!" said Sherlock a little bit louder than he intended to, feeling a mixture of anger and jealousy "it's when two people who like each other go out and have fun" said John laughing a bit. Then Sherlock, with all he courage he could find, answered "That's what I was suggesting". He couldn't believe that he just admitted that he wanted a date with John. "No it's not. Or at least I hope it's not" said the doctor, chuckling and obviously unaware of how those words hurt Sherlock.
"You don't want Donovan to insult you, eh?" said the doctor. The woman was always saying such horrible things about Sherlock and, John knew that even if the detective did not show it, those things affected him.
"What took you guys so long?" said the detective inspector a little bit pissed because of the fact that he had had to wait for so long. Then he shook his head and continued talking, now telling them facts about the victim
John's blog had been growing quite a lot and it became very well-known all around the world, so people would write their case there and both, the detective and the doctor, decided if they wanted to take it or not.
"No! It's not okay! You were dead, Sherlock! I saw it happen. I went to your grave every goddamn day! Two bloody years!" he took a deep breath and kept on talking "I was moving on and now... Now you just come back into my life again? Don't you dare tell me it's okay!"
John started to walk away from the cementery for what he thought it would be the last time, tears flushing down his cheeks.
Sherlock had come back from dismantling Moriarty's network a month ago but he couldn't reveal that he was alive yet, not until Mycroft had made sure that there were no more Moriarty's workers free.
Mycroft's glare was concerned and sad. The doctor started to sweat nervously and to be a little scared.
"No, I'm not joking" replied Sherlock very calmly before continuing his explanation "All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise. But, even though I can't be certain, I think that Charlie must have suffered some sort of seizure. You said he felt unwell, right? He dies there and then."
The doctor could hear his flat mate playing the violin downstairs, He always enjoyed it when Sherlock played violin. It wasn't only the pieces he played that John enjoyed, it was also the elegance and class of his hands movements on the violin, the passion and sentiment his pieces transmitted; it's almost as if those musical compositions were talking to him, telling him how Sherlock was feeling.
John's mouth hung open and his eyes started to burn, causing tears to flush his face. He couldn't believe his eyes. Once he steadied himself a bit he said
"John Hamish Watson... will you do me the great honor of becoming my husband?" asked Sherlock with a huge smile plastered on his gorgeous face and his eyes glittering with love, something that rarely happened.
"Okay... Do you want something to eat for breakfast?" John inquired while looking for something edible to eat. But Sherlock simply replied that he was not hungry and went back to playing his violin.
Sherlock's cheeks rose in colour and his cupid bow lips twitched upwards. John smiled too, relieved that both, the detective and the doctor himself, had finally confessed their feelings, even if it was not with words, they both knew what that kiss meant.
That night, his flat mate spent many hours playing his violin, but this time the pieces he played sounded much more melancholic...
"No cases for today either?", she asked a bit worried for his sake, but Sherlock didn't reply; he just sighed and plopped dramatically on the sofa.
Sherlock smiled a little at John and gave him a quick peck on the lips, just before arriving to the crime scene.
He felt even worse when he thought about how he was pushing john, his best friend and flat mate, away... He was hurting him and he knew that, but he couldn't help it.
That was all it took to convince his boyfriend to dance with him. He stood up and directed to where Sherlock was standing, and just like that, they danced in each other's arms several hours, feeling as happy as ever and thinking how lucky they were for having found each other.
Hey! I really hope you guys enjoy his fanfic as much as I am enjoying writing it! This is the first fanfic or story that I have ever written, so excuse me if there's any mistakes or it's not good enough!
A week later, John had already started working in a hospital where he met this gorgeous woman: Sarah. The doctor, after a few days working there, couldn't resist it anymore and asked Sarah on a date, to which she happily accepted.
When they were done at Scotland Yard, the detective and the doctor hailed a cab to go home and on their way back to 221B, both men were feeling blue because of the case that had just been solved; a man who was secretly in love with his best friend, never told her because he was too afraid and now it was too late for him.
"My brother, has the brain of a scientist or a philosopher, yet he chooses to be a detective. What might we deduce about his heart?"
On his way home, the doctor found himself buying coffee on the same exact stand where 7 years ago he bumped into Mike Stamford, the man who introduced him to Sherlock. As soon as he realized it, he started feeling dizzy and sick; all the memories were coming back to him, he felt overwhelmed, so he started walking to his new home, tears rolling down his cheeks, while thinking 'Why? Why did he have to do it?'. It was still very hard for him to process that Sherlock Holmes, his best friend, was dead; everything was so different and dull now that he wasn't there... A few days after Sherlock's death, John had wished at the taller man's grave for a miracle: for him to stop being dead. He knew it was impossible, but still, he wished with all his strength that it could be true.
"Well, I am sorry for not being able to help you, John. The only advice I can give you is what I have always told Sherlock: Caring is not an advantage. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a very important meeting that I must attend to." He said while standing up and walking John to the door.
She falls asleep quickly and he makes sure the baby monitor is switched on before returning downstairs to the sitting room.
He snatched his phone back and googled information about the breed his best - and only - friend had been turned into. "Oh, this is fantastic, John! Looks like your breed was designed specifically for hunting ducks. Ducks, criminals, barely any difference there. Now tell me, what does it feel like?"
He wrenched open the door and strode into the hallway, just in time to see John stumble through a similar door down the hallway, a hand over his mouth. Sherlock glanced around, reached for the nearest vaguely bucket-shaped object and rushed down the hall towards him, shoving the thing - a large, empty waste bin - into John’s arms.
Silence. He had said all he wanted to say, all he had needed to say. And god, it felt good, an entire mountain range lifting off his chest. It was good to finally be honest, to get to say what was on his mind and mean it.
He squeezed his eyes shut as if that would somehow block out sound, and tried to cover his ears with his hands.
John took a breath and finally allowed himself to admit it out loud. "I want to make this work because I love you and I don't ever want to lose you again."
The detective caught his hands in a surprisingly strong grip and stared down at him, a strange look in his eyes. Then a smile spread on his face and John realised the look was mostly amusement. "We're in ma room, Jawn."
In the beginning, Sherlock had been so tense John had wanted to reach out and touch him, to pet all the tension out of his body. He had refrained from doing so, however, not wanting to distract his mate or accidentally cause some dissonance through the physical contact.
"I think it's time for you to go now," he said, noting that John was very clearly not going to eat any more. "It was good to see you, John. Thanks for your help on this case. I'll be in touch."
John sighed. "Yes, I know. If you wanted my permission, you've got it. I don't really have a leg to stand on, do I? You can shag whomever you like, Sherlock. If you liked him, go get his number and see what happens. Who knows, it might turn into something."
The DI pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. "Sherlock, I cannot arrest someone for littering!"
Lestrade shook his head. "Didn't ask her about it, but she did mention that he was absolutely willing to pay child support and apparently even set up a trust fund in his son's name."
He tightened his arms a little, hoping Sherlock would feel it. “It’s me, John. You’re all right. Come on, wake up.”
He had barely come to that conclusion when he was already pushing off the wall and hurrying after Sherlock. As much as he disliked confrontations of this kind, it would be better to just get it over with sooner rather than later, before either of them could find the time to say or do something stupid.
"Got it," he says, rocking back down as he switches the light on. Both movements happen almost simultaneously and so John has the perfect view of Sherlock's face as he unconsciously lowers himself right onto the detective's lap.
"Hey Johnny," she said when she noticed he had decided to join her. "Trying to get away from His Highness for a bit? Can't blame you."
Sherlock's hand was surprisingly warm, his fingers rough and calloused from his violin and the various chemicals he handled. His hand was also much larger than John's and John couldn't help but wonder how his paw would compare if he were to shift. He shook the thought away. Now was not the time.
He took another deep breath and struggled to his feet. His temple hurt - he must have hit his head on the way down - and he was bloodied and bruised all over from hitting the uneven tracks at full force to escape Mary's bullet. His ears were still ringing from the shot, too.
"Me looking at you like this?" Sherlock allowed some of it to show on his face, let it bleed into his gaze as he stared at John. It was quite difficult to overcome years of instinct telling him not to let John see.
"Says the man who spent two years hunting down people on the off-chance they might try to kill me," John retorted.
A wise man wouldn't have speculated, but Sherlock had never claimed to be wise and so he was not at all surprised to find himself entertaining the idea.
John thought about it. "Well, there was a moment where I wasn't sure, actually. Two, now that I think of it. There was that moment when we were dancing in our room at the Last Stand and you looked at me and I thought ... well, I thought I was imagining the longing in your eyes. And then, later that night, there was a crazy moment when you kissed me where I thought maybe you really were interested. But then I saw the disgust on your face."
It drew a ragged moan from his throat, followed by a full-body shudder that made John step closer, wanting to feel more of it, of Sherlock, of everything.
They got out at the far end of Regent's park, near the London Zoo, and took the long way around. Technically, the parks were locked once darkness fell but Sherlock knew the gatekeepers' schedules well enough to avoid being locked in by accident. And of course even if they did get locked in, he would have no trouble picking the locks to let them out.
He shrugged. "My brother works in an expensive office where they barely allow people in, let alone pets."
He closed his eyes for a moment and sighed. "I'll have to talk to her, of course, explain somehow ... but I don't think she'll be too surprised. She's been making comments, too." He laughed bitterly. "God, even my own fiancée saw the way you looked at me."
The wine was still quite warm and deliciously spicy. John sighed happily. "Brilliant. Did you make it yourself?"
John hummed at the memory and stretched again, indulging in the ache of strained muscles protesting any sort of movement. He turned his head and found Sherlock sound asleep next to him, lips slightly parted and his face half hidden by the pillow.
He finally turned to look at Sherlock and found him staring at him with an inscrutable look on his face. "What?"
Sherlock snapped to attention. Before his brain had time to catch up, his arms had risen and wrapped themselves around John, pulling him closer, drawing him back in.
John stared at the phone, apparently taking the picture in. Sherlock wondered what he thought of his appearance.
At present, his flatmate did not seem inclined to find anything funny, however. Instead, he stared at Mycroft with his eyes narrowed. "Must I remind you that all this -" he made a wide gesture with his arms to encompass the pool, the flash drive and his own state - "is the direct result of you asking me to retrieve the stolen data? That's the third time you have come to me with such a matter, maybe you should improve your security systems to prevent further occurrences of intelligence theft."
“I am,” John confirmed. “There is an entire life I could have led, a life I’m now never going to have. But it hinges on too many what ifs. What if Mary hadn’t died, what if Mary hadn’t been an assassin? What if the child had been mine? And so on. It’s impossible to believe that all of these what ifs could somehow have worked out differently and still ended up with us getting married. So I’m mourning the life I might have had and the person I thought she was. But I’m not mourning the real thing, if that makes any sense.”
John eyed the treat for a moment, sniffed at it and ate it off Sherlock's palm immediately. He wagged his tail in approval and Sherlock actually flinched as a wet tongue licked his hand in search for any morsels John might have missed.
And now all of that was gone and all that remained were the scars on his back and the fresh horror in John’s voice and body language as he tried not to imagine what Sherlock must have gone through and clearly failed.
"Yes. They have natural healing abilities and not all of them also have a medical degree, though most do. A pack healer can use their Alpha's strength and through him the entire pack's strength, to heal a wounded pack member. I've seen healers literally coax bullets out of open wounds. Their abilities aren't unlimited. If you are too grievously injured, you can still die. But your chances are a lot better with your pack healer than anyone else."
Sally doesn't need to ask who "he" is. She simply accepts the tin and digs into it with Molly when she comes over for tea the next day.
So it must have been someone with access to the church and knowledge of where precisely Mary would be at what time.
Sherlock stares at him, not moving a muscle except for that rapid blinking thing he does when he's processing new information.
It took a full five seconds for him to try and convince himself that this, too, was a hallucination, but he quickly discarded the notion. John had never touched him like this. He wouldn't have imagined it like this.
The paper fell open almost on its own accord, just as it had done earlier. Sherlock must have folded and unfolded it countless times, must have read it often. That alone was interesting because John was sure Sherlock didn't need to re-read things unless he had actively deleted them from his mind. Whatever this was, he chose to carry it around with him at all times.
The text message made him suspicious immediately. It was a polite request, included the word "please" and was not signed. In short: It was everything Sherlock Holmes would never
John snorted. "William, of all names. How on earth did you come up with that one? Was it one of the ten most common names in England?"
John sighed and ran a hand down his face, wishing he was less exhausted. "Fine, as far as I can tell. She's quite shaken up of course and I suspect she will be rather clingy for a while, but so will I. They've taken her for an x-ray just to be on the safe side but they don't really expect to find anything. I'll probably be able to take her home in an hour or so."
The pathologist shakes her head. "No. I suppose he didn't think I was important enough until suddenly I was very important and then it was too late. So we sort of skipped that part."
They said goodbye and continued on their way, in the opposite direction. Sherlock stared after them in some confusion before looking back at John.
Just then, his phone chimed with a text message. "There is a car waiting for us outside," he said. "My brother is surprisingly fast at times. Probably had a bloody Quick Reaction Force waiting around the corner the entire time I've been working here." He turned to Lestrade and pierced him with his glare. "You would know, of course. He sent you here to have an eye on me, after all."
They made a left turn and Lestrade steered the car along the outer edge of a rather long park. He found a suitable parking spot and parked the car. "There we are. Remember, no telekinesis, no funny stuff, try to keep your mouth shut for as long as possible. And for the love of god think carefully before you do say anything."
Sherlock blinked at him. "Yes of course. She's the most brilliant woman I've ever seen. She'll tell you she's only dabbling but I have her books somewhere in the flat. And they're still threatening her with a Nobel price."
There was no chance of any of this now and it was ridiculous to think that there ever could have been. If he and Sherlock had managed to get married without anything ever happening between them, there was no chance of anything happening now, when John was
There was no trace of Sherlock. John allowed himself half a moment of resignation before the panic set in.
There is no mistaking the way they look at each other, though. Sally has rarely seen two people more in love. It makes her feel as if she is intruding on a private moment.
And really, that dog was ridiculously adorable with his reddish fur and white chest and white blaze and floppy ears. He looked a bit like a fox, she thought, and decided to look up the breed as soon as she got the opportunity.
"Anthea. She's my brother's personal protection detail and direct contact to the squad. I know there are others that he deals with on a regular basis but Anthea is specifically there for his protection."
Certainly his marriage was something to look forward to and he couldn't wait to call Mary his wife. He simply didn't like how this would affect his friendship with Sherlock. Obviously they wouldn't be able to spend as much time together as they used to, but that had been an issue ever since Sherlock's return. Now it would simply grow even more pronounced.
"My lips are sealed," Mr Hendriksen promised, and mimed locking his mouth and throwing away an imaginary key.
Lestrade sat down on the edge of the bed. Well, fuck. What was he supposed to do with that? But deep down he couldn't help the swell of warm pride. That Sherlock had reached out to him of all people made him think that perhaps this friendship wasn't entirely one-sided after all.
There was more, a lot more, and he wanted to press closer and just breathe, dissect and analyse every last little trace - he hadn't even started on Sherlock's own scent yet - but Sherlock was already moving again, marching towards the car. "Come along, John. The sooner we get out of here, the better. I don't want any of these imbeciles to try and conduct ruthless experiments on you."
And what if it was? John obviously knew what he had done, that was the entire point of his leaving Sherlock alone in the flat.
Sherlock stared at the cracked, aged leather of the sofa, remembering the many times he had seen John sit on it. "I don't know." He swallowed. "I agreed to do it. I told him I would. I won't break his trust again."
"Never mind the temperature, if we drink this entire flask right now, we'll be too drunk to decide which goat is the right one," John had wisely concluded.
She ruffled John's fur one last time as Sherlock picked up their bags and then they were down the stairs and out the door and getting into the car.
Since they couldn't open the windows for fear of any reporters spying on them, they were left with no other option than to sit and sweat it out. They both took too many showers (separately) and started to skip tea and toast in favour of cereal and iced coffee.
“Really?” Sherlock’s voice was low but John could hear the teasing note in it. “Because I could think of a place or two that would be even better. Less public, definitely.”
"Not at all," Sherlock replied. "If you wish, I can give Inspector Lestrade a call and he can confirm that I have been involved in this investigation since Mr Forsythe senior's body was found."
John grins back and shrugs. "Conductor of light, remember? But I think ... I think the victim would have continued to fight back. Like this."
Sherlock felt the compliment to be a bit premature, seeing as he hadn't done much worth praising yet. That was easily sorted, though. He let his right hand drop into the water, teasingly brushing his fingers across John's chest before sliding lower and grasping both their cocks.
He almost jumped out of his skin in surprise at the sound of John's voice. The notebook slipped from his fingers and he barely managed to catch it with an undignified scramble.
“I think the Natural History museum is high up on the list,” John said. “But it’s a bit too obvious.”
Both hands followed the path of the whip marks, long, angry red slashes running diagonally across his back from his right shoulder to his left hip, criss-crossing every so often.
"Hell-oooo, what have we got here?" the young man asked, having just reached their table and staring at Sherlock with the rapt amazement people usually reserved for the detective before he opened his mouth and ruined the effect his looks had on them. "New faces! Would you like anything to drink?"
All too soon, it was evening and Sherlock excused himself to take Redbeard for a walk while John made sure Rosie ate dinner and then got her ready for bed. He walked around Regent's Park, thinking of the promise he had made to Mrs Hudson and wondering if fulfilling it would destroy him for good.
"And make sure to find a lovely spot for the honeymoon," Henryk Walczak added. "My wife and I had our wedding trip here. We fell in love with the country and have returned here every year since."
Sherlock beamed. "I thought, since this is supposed to be a holiday for you, you might like having breakfast without needing to get dressed first."
Sherlock spent the entire cab ride home trying not to stare at John, both for fear of what John might see on his face and of what he might do if he looked at him for too long. He had never wanted to kiss John so badly in all his life, and that included that moment in Kew Gardens.
It made something in John's stomach twist that he couldn't quite explain. He thought it might be jealousy and didn't like the thought. He had no right to be jealous. Sherlock didn't belong to him, after all. And he had Mary, for fuck's sake. The only reason he was here right now was for the extra cash for their wedding. If Sherlock wanted to flirt with someone, he was well within his rights to do so.
John grinned at himself in the bathroom mirror before moving towards the shower to turn on the water. Sherlock Holmes was one hell of a challenge indeed. But, like all challenges, he was not impossible to succeed at.
"It's a linguistic feat, not an emotional one," Sherlock informed her calmly. "And therefore it is well within my abilities."
Sherlock opened his mouth, closed it again - and didn't respond. John noted he also didn't comment on the 'partner'-thing but that was probably because Sherlock simply did not understand that Mrs Hudson had not meant it in regards to a work relationship.
"Alright then," he muttered, stepping on the first step to get to Sherlock's other side and gently steering him towards the rail. "There, hold on to that, keep your other arm around me and let's take it slowly. One stair at a time."
There were the cars outside - fewer of them now that most people were already home and in their beds - interspersed with the buses and Tube. There were some pedestrians walking along Baker Street and the raised voices of a couple mid-argument across the street. And, most annoyingly of all, there were Mrs Turner's married ones next door, making use of their bed in a way that had little to do with sleeping.
After several long minutes, Sherlock managed to grab the discarded towels, wiped the remnants of oil from his own hands and back and decided that if John wasn’t sleeping in a t-shirt, he certainly wouldn’t bother with one. It was hot outside. It was hot inside, too, and Sherlock wished he could open the window to lure an elusive breeze into the room and help cool them down. But the spectre of the press stuck to the edge of his thoughts and he couldn't bring himself to risk it.
He was therefore not at all pleased to walk into his own sitting room and find Mary Morstan standing in the middle of the flat.
Leaving the rings where they were, he picked up the folder instead. There was a smaller one beneath it, also labelled in Sherlock's own hand: "
"Uh... yes, of course, sorry," Molly stammered. "Just... uh.. make sure he doesn't touch or lick anything. Or get out of this room. I don't think he'd be welcome in any other part of this building."
She glanced around to make sure no one else was there - silly, they would have heard the door - and lowered her voice. "I asked around in the healing community and I've been told if changelings don't shift for a long time, they might go insane or ... or lose the ability completely. He's ... he's not acting weirdly, is he?"
John's scent was a heavy layer on the Psy male, hugging him like a second skin. It wasn't ingrained deeply enough for an intimate relationship but she was already surprised enough. This, though ... she breathed in deeply ... this smelled of emotional attachment. It wasn't difficult to imagine what John might see in tousled hair, bright eyes and pale skin. Holmes' voice positively gave her the shivers and she could only imagine what he might sound like if he added some inflection when he spoke.
He could almost feel the glare already that Sherlock was sure to send his way as soon as he read the entry.
"Everything okay? Are you hurt?" A wave of concern washes over him, chasing away some of his irrational arousal.
John took up position on the other side of the body and leaned forward to examine the ligature marks on the victim’s neck. “Attempted strangulation. I don’t think it was the cause of death, though - look at that nasty head wound.”
It takes them a couple of minutes to calm down and another minute or two until John feels his legs are steady enough for him to stand. Someone really should get up and turn on the lights, so he tries to do just that.
He tried to imagine what would have happened had Sherlock actually given this speech on his wedding day, in front of all the guests and Mary.
Sally sighs. "It has been made clear to me that they are in very real danger here. Now, I don't know about you two, but I'm not going to attend another funeral for Sherlock Holmes."
It was all very odd and he had a feeling that half of these examinations were simply being done in order to reassure him. If that was indeed the goal, they failed miserably.
"He's gone," Sherlock concludes, voice completely void of emotion. "But it's clear from the route he took where he's headed." He pulls out his phone and texts Lestrade the address. "Come on. Let's go find a Chinese. I could do with a Dim Sum."
"Hm, I still have my scars, too," John husked and cleared his throat several times until someone got the point and handed him a glass of water. "Thanks." He drank a few sips and when he spoke again, his voice sounded much better. "Didn't think I'd get those back, actually. Could have done without them, really."
He tried to hide his panic. John wasn't here. Of course not. But if the point had been to get Sherlock away from him specifically rather than from people in general, then John was still alive. And, knowing him, it would only be a matter of time before he woke and went looking for Sherlock. Unless he was being held at a different location, of course. But Sherlock didn't think so. Surely the game would be more appealing, more enjoyable, if tinged with the knowledge that John was somewhere out there, looking for Sherlock.
"I won't need too many resources," Sally adds. "Give me one or two PCs to help with the research and the paperwork and I can at least make a start, do some follow-ups."
he thought, wondering how on earth he was going to explain this to John. Or the police, for that matter.
John's muscles twitched and his hips stuttered as Sherlock nosed along one hip bone and his breathing had grown heavy and a bit short. Had he realised yet what Sherlock intended to do? He must have. Sherlock knew better than to assume he had anything approaching subtlety on his side.
Luckily, Mrs Hudson was home and had heard them outside. She came to open the door and jumped back with a startled shriek at the sight of John.
"Lestrade says the results of the drug test were negative. The substance they found in the son's flat was some sort of skin powder. They're still trying to figure out what kind precisely."
Sherlock blinked and considered. A practical application would mean touch, which was forbidden and therefore inherently fascinating to him. "Depending on your responses, I may conduct some experiments."
"Actually, that is something we should discuss inside," Sherlock told her before turning to the driver who had just unloaded their luggage. "Upstairs, just put it in the sitting room."
"Oh, is that supposed to reassure me?" John demanded, opening the door to their room with more force than strictly necessary. "Because it really doesn't."
But clearly Sherlock had either forgotten or was unable to speak in a linear fashion. "She was dead and I thought... I thought you could finally come home. I had been gone for two years and all I wanted was to come home and then I did and you were gone. And that was... it wasn't great but I could accept that. Accept her, if I had to."
It was so warm that they both had opted to leave their jackets at home. Sherlock brought a messenger bag filled with a small shovel, clippers, a sharpie and a collection of plastic bags with empty labels already stuck to them for his samples, and several pairs of single-use gloves.
Sherlock shook his head. “No. I just ... you know we can’t, not here in public, but ... I was thinking how we’ll be able to do that soon, give it another month or two.”
John took that as his cue to sit up, looking not the least bit embarrassed to have been caught making out on the floor. "Hullo Greg."
What did happen was that Sherlock made a noise John had never heard before and jerked forwards even as his entire body tipped back, pulling John with him. A moment later, they lay sprawled on the sofa, still kissing as if they had just invented it.
"I'm all right and I appreciate the question," Molly told him. Of course she would, John thought. There probably wasn't anyone else who would be stupid or presumptuous enough to ask.
Sherlock finally raised his head and looked at him and there was a hint of defiance in his gaze. "Just because you didn't want me around, that didn't mean she should be cut off from me as well. I wanted to make sure she knew my face and my voice. I wanted her to know that, no matter what, I will always be just a phone call away." He swallowed. "I realise I went behind your back on this. I saw no other choice. I did not believe you would ... understand ... or be in any mood to listen to me make my case. But she never ... she never called me that. I didn't think she thought I was ... that."
By now it had become obvious that Sherlock was either completely unaware of the reason women kept approaching him in the park or simply pretending to be unaware so as to let them down more easily. However, thanks to their encounter with the soldiers the previous morning, it was equally obvious that his lack of interest did not extend to men and therefore John was starting to look at them as potential poachers on what was definitely his territory.
They stopped at the Ready Money drinking fountain for a few sips of water. John couldn't quite reach the fountain himself, so Sherlock offered him the water in his cupped hands. It wasn't the most dignified method but John found he rather enjoyed the added benefit of licking Sherlock's hands and watching his friend shake with barely suppressed laughter. Apparently he was ticklish. John filed that information away for later, just in case.
"I was waiting for you to say something like that," John sighed. "This investigation has been far too tame for your standards so far. We've only gone snooping around in the middle of the night once."
He glanced around the room and caught sight of the bedside table, where someone had put a small zip-lock bag with Sherlock's meagre belongings. Having arrived in pyjamas, there weren't that many. Just his wristwatch and the gleaming wedding band. Silver, John thought and reached out for the bag before he could stop himself. He carefully extracted the ring and examined it.
"Oh, no. No, it was fine," Sherlock replied. "Molly has discovered trace amounts of a chemical compound in the stomach of one of the victims. She is trying to analyse and replicate it so we can study it in more detail."
The corners of Mrs Hudson's mouth turn down and she sighs. "I haven't heard a single explosion since he came back. Of course, he's been out a lot. He says he has to reacquaint himself with the city again, but I think he just needs an excuse to not be up there all by himself."
With the state of mind John was currently in, Sherlock really didn’t want to have to explain to him that he had shown up at the Landmark with fresh stitches and bandages all over his back. John had already gotten enough news to turn his world on its head this week. There was no need to add more guilt for something beyond his control to the pile.
"I used to have a dog when I was a child. An Irish Setter. His name was Redbeard. I didn't much care for the company of other children but I loved playing with him." He sighed. It sounded a bit shaky. "He had to be put down when he got cancer. I was eight."
John dragged the trousers up until Sherlock was able to reach them without doing himself further injury, steadily avoiding to let his gaze linger where it had no place being.
"To see me," Sherlock finished. "I thought as much when it became clear that there was no other possible reason for him to have walked all the way to Regent's Park from his home so early in the day."
This restless energy was quite different from the one that had had him in its grip this morning, however. John knew this type. This was the "nothing in this case is making any sense so obviously I'm missing a piece of the puzzle and I want to know what it is" tension that usually happened shortly before Sherlock made some sort of mental leap and the entire thing unravelled into a stunningly obvious trail from cause to effect.
Sherlock blinked. "That is rather the point of us allowing people to think we are in a relationship, is it not?"
“I’m sure you can come up with a couple more questions to ask John,” Sherlock said sharply. “And have you interviewed Mrs Hudson at all? Now if you’ll excuse me.”
Sherlock shrugged and began shoving the wooden planks back into place. "Wanting something and knowing whether or not it is feasible are two different things, John. I am well aware of what is and isn't possible for me and there are too many factors standing between me and any relationship I would care to cultivate."
From his position right beside the bed, John could see how tightly Sherlock's hands were clenched around a corner of his duvet. His knuckles were white.
"I think I've changed my mind," Sherlock murmured, his lips inches from John's ear, hot breath ghosting over his skin.
The hug they shared in their sitting room some months ago is seared into his memory and he still doesn't know if John noticed him kissing the top of his head, just because he could and might not have another chance. He dares anyone to be thrown a lifebelt and not reach for it.
“John, we’ve been over this. No need to apologise,” Sherlock chided him softly. “Believe it or not, it did actually occur to me that the funeral might trigger more nightmares.”
on life itself, I could do things differently, tell you the truth. I imagined what it would be like if you felt the same."
Mrs Hendriksen seemed to understand anyway. "That's very thoughtful of you," she told him and he felt something in his chest relax a little. It was hard to tell what John might appreciate, but if a completely ordinary person who had been happily married for over three decades approved, it couldn't be a bad idea.
"Well?" he demanded. "Am I going to meet the man who has kept me so delightfully entertained in recent weeks? I came all this way, after all. The least you can do is tell me your name."
She doesn't have reason to be worried, though. She trusts their justice system. She certainly trusts Mycroft Holmes to ensure the justice system works the way it is supposed to when it comes to a woman who could have and did cause his little brother so much pain.
Sherlock frowned. “Nonsense. People can’t take several weeks off their day jobs for bereavement,” he pointed out. “They can’t expect you to hide away in here forever. Come with me. If anyone asks, you can always tell them you’re going stir crazy cooped up at home.”
Perhaps he could go to the morgue, ask Molly for a body he could dissect. Her quiet presence would help, keep him from doing something stupid, keep him focused on the Work.
"Don't look like that, John. He'll be back in no time at all, just you wait. Your man can look after himself for a time, even though you wouldn't believe it just looking at him," Mrs Hudson tried to console him, patting his back and ruffling his ears. "Now budge up, they're showing Skyfall on Channel 4. That Daniel Craig is a fine specimen of man, let me tell you."
However, the detective didn't seem in the mood to comment on the deplorable state of John's fitness. Instead, without so much as turning his head to acknowledge him, Sherlock spoke.
Sherlock shook his head. "We always buy too much and there is a limit to how many leftovers I can eat. Please have some."
John doesn't know what precisely happened during the conversation they had, but after that Sherlock has been avoiding both St. Bart's and Molly, conveniently leaving the flat every time she comes by to visit Rosie and only returning long after she had gone.
"I think Sergeant Donovan elbowed me in the stomach," John provided, wincing at the memory. "But I think I may have stepped on her foot in retaliation, so we're even."
Despite his words, the old man looked like he needed to sit down. "I have heard of you, of course. Word travels even to our parts, eventually." He blinked at Sherlock. "Aren't you supposed to be dead?"
He returned to his bedroom, got dressed in fresh clothes, and inspected the bed. The sheets definitely needed a wash and the room a good airing.
He held up his hands in a placating gesture. "Believe it or not but I didn't actually know what was going on. Did you never wonder why I didn't say anything about our wedding? I literally had no idea it had happened until Mary and I tried to apply for our licence. And when I came here to confront him, he didn't say anything about how he felt about it, of course. We weren't ... well, we weren't even talking, why on earth would he tell me anything at all that I might use against him?"
He dragged Sherlock down half of Broad Walk before the first sounds of unusual activity reached him, and he promptly turned in that direction. Sherlock let himself be pulled along, walking in long strides and appearing rather amused by John's eagerness to get to the action.
Things had been said on both sides that John wasn't happy with. He could have handled the situation better, that much was certain. Of course Sherlock would be defensive and contrary.
John would remember that he had a perfectly adequate room upstairs and get it cleaned out and habitable once more. And once he did, Sherlock would be left with this empty bed full of memories of John in it. How was he going to deal with that? How was he supposed to ever find rest again without John right there?
While Sherlock composed, occasionally stopping to write down the notes, John admired the gruesome bacteria crime scenes dangling from their tree and let his thoughts wander wherever they pleased. If that happened to be his flatmate's lithe body, he wasn't about to question it. After four years of constant exposure to Sherlock Holmes, John's excuses and denials had worn rather thin until he had finally decided to just let it go. After all, it wasn't as if anything would ever happen between them, so there was no use getting all worked up over people misunderstanding.
Sherlock's mind searches for suitable replies and draws a blank, further evidence that John is correct in this.
"What else do you propose to do then?" Sherlock asked without bothering to raise his head. "Do you want to track down everyone in that train car to question them in person? You could put out an alert, ask witnesses to come in, but the killer will not be among them and it will be quite impossible to tell who was there and who wasn't."
It wasn't said bitingly and he was correct, so Lestrade chose not to comment. "Got a bit of experience in trying to work things out, too," he said instead.
"That ... does not reassure me at all," John sighed. "But I suppose we don't really have a better option, do we?"
Another quarter of an hour ticked by in quiet companionship before Sherlock finally sighed and set up. "All right, off with you. I don't know about you, but I spent an entire afternoon with your head on my bladder and could do with a visit to the bathroom. And judging by the low level of water in your bowl, I'm assuming so do you."
Sherlock snorted, moving his arm a bit to scratch John's ear. "My father is not at all what you may imagine. No crazy scientist, no dazzling genius. He is, and to my knowledge always has been, a completely average man, only distinguished by an exceptionally kind heart and the amazing ability to look at mother and our 'utterly brilliant madness' as he calls it, and see only something worthy of his love. My parents are the most devoted couple I have ever seen in my life. It is quite incomprehensible how someone like Mycroft shares the same genes, but then I shouldn't be one to judge, I suppose."
"You must know that," John said, aware that he was on very thin ice here. "I mean, you do own a mirror. You must know you're beautiful."
But Sherlock seemed to have a different idea. He turned and walked to the window, staring out into the darkness of the early morning hours.
Perhaps one day he would be able to solve a murder while John's thumb was tracing circles across his hipbone, but for now that day was a long way off.
He tries to find Sherlock's pulse in the dark, plants his fingers right on the other man's lips by accident, quickly drags them down and... and moves his hand right back up again as soon as his brain catches on to what his senses are telling him.
John turned his head and gave him a half-hearted glare before sniffing at the hand Lestrade held out to him. Warmth, steadiness, quiet competence, nicotine and stress and too much coffee - Lestrade smelled exactly as John would have expected. He gave his hand a friendly lick, wishing he could laugh at the surprised 'Oi!' that garnered him, and then went to lie down in a patch of sunshine seeping through the window.
He supposed the bruise on his face must be a truly alarming colour now. It said something for the apathy of the general Londoner that no one had commented on his appearance during his little trip to Forsythe's office.
They returned to Baker Street, mostly because there was nothing else for them to do while they waited for Molly to get back to them with the autopsy report.
John swallows. "You ... is that what you think this is? That I'm using you as a ... a substitute for my wife?"
Sherlock closed his eyes, knowing that John could have every last minute he had to offer. It was a bit pathetic to admit, even to himself. Three years away, and he hadn't gotten anywhere at all.
," John agreed, sitting up and dragging Sherlock up as well until he was sitting in his lap, hands tangled in his hair and the front of his shirt. "And get that thing off."
John laughed and kissed his neck again, pushing until Sherlock lay down again, half-naked and desperate to get there all the way.
For the first time ever, John witnessed his brilliant mate at a loss for words. "Fantastic," he murmured, gathering Sherlock close. "It's fantastic."
"If you say so. I'm taking a shower. Again. I think I've got dust in places even a medical man wouldn't expect."
He knew his Psy would be unlikely to tell him about it, but it didn't matter. Anger in itself was already an improvement, a sign of progress. Anger was a rather volatile emotion. Not something Psy usually experienced. John thought of all their furniture floating around the flat, thought of Sherlock dragging a fleeing suspect toward himself with his Tk, thought of how Sherlock had once smashed a gun in a man's hand from 20 metres away, and found himself fervently hoping that he wasn't the one who had inadvertently triggered Sherlock's anger. Instead, he found himself hoping the Psy Council would be at the receiving end of it.
It took him a moment to realise that John hadn't replied. He merely stood by the door, wide-eyed and slack-jawed.
If he wasn’t holding a cup of scalding hot tea, Sherlock thought there was a good chance he might have hugged her.
He stood and stretched. "You may wish to slowly get used to ordinary food, too," he said. "But start out small. It will take your taste buds some time to get used to any sort of flavour that is stronger than very mild tea."
Only a day ago he had told John they could not continue this, had to put a stop to the experiment and stay as far from each other as they could. He would hold on to that. For now. He would hold on to it until he was calmer and the other changelings stopped staring. He would hold himself to his own words until he had a plan of action. And now he knew that when the time came, John would be by his side.
“Can’t remember,” Sherlock said, pulling the teabag out of his mug and settling onto a chair opposite John. “You are acting disturbingly normal.”
"Patrick Wiltshire," the man introduced himself. "Sorry, should have introduced myself right away. I'm afraid I'm not at my best right now."
The portly man nodded. "Aye. Took pity on him when he couldn't get a straight word typed out on his phone. He said to text ya, so I did. He's yours, then?"
Perhaps Mrs Hudson understood - she had always been more clever than he was willing to admit and she knew him well enough. Now, her soft hand clamped around his arm in a surprisingly firm grip and she pushed him towards his armchair. "Sit down."
“And then Mycroft was waiting for us at home with all his revelations about Mary and that night John asked if I thought she had ever really l-loved him, and I told him she’d have been an idiot not to.”
"Fine," he relented. "You stay where you are, under the covers, and I'll lie here, on top of them, and no funny business. Got it?"
For those who are wondering, I've moved back into 221b. It may be the only time I've ever managed to thoroughly shock Sherlock and I hope I never will again. As I said, it wasn't an ideal situation.
"You know more than most other people do," Sherlock reminded him. "Come on, I want to wrap this up and get home before midnight for a change."
"Explain to me how lying in the snow in a city in Sweden on Christmas Eve to watch whether or not a massive straw goat goes up in flames is traditional," John said.
Sherlock blinked at her. "Why wouldn't he be? That is the standard reaction to losing a friend, is it not?"
"But don't you worry," the other Psy said, smirking coldly. "I will make a nice carpet out of his fur so you can see him every time I have you dragged to my office for some minor cleaning task. Rehabilitation won't leave you with the skills for anything else but I do hope you'll still recognise his head when it's mounted on my wall."
He realised he was stroking his lips and quickly lowered his hand, feeling deeply unsettled and ever so slightly flushed.
It shouldn't make him blush, that compliment. He was well aware of his looks, knew people found him oddly attractive. But hearing it from John was different, more meaningful.
He thought his friend's face looked a bit flushed, a hint of colour on those sharp cheekbones, clearly visible despite the dust. And there was a lot of dust in Sherlock's hair, too, which was surprisingly messy. Dust seemed to be covering every inch of him but that didn't explain the messy hair. Sherlock was fastidious about it and only ran his hands through it in moments of great 'Nothing about this case makes sense' frustration. The dust made sense. The messiness didn't.
"Did you have a good time at the park?" John asked when they finally managed to stop kissing long enough to talk.
He clearly hadn't meant to say it out loud and John thought he did a good job of pretending he hadn't heard, even as his pulse sped up. Surely Sherlock hadn't meant...?
Sherlock looked at John, then at the bird, then back at John, who stood with his arms crossed and his back ramrod straight, feet planted slightly apart in what the detective recognized as his "I'm Captain John Watson, don't mess with me" stance. He decided not to take any chances.
Sherlock shifted next to him, the dim light catching in the tips of his curls just visible around the edge of his white wool hat, and John felt a sudden and entirely expected wave of fondness sweep over him.
"Seems like a reasonable assumption to make," Lestrade said. "I'll take his statement later, once he has decided to shift back."
Despite her harsh tone towards Sherlock, it appeared she had not been all that eager to be part of this discussion either.
"Thank you, John," Sherlock said and John watched Donovan's jaw drop. "That was a most helpful explanation. I shall keep in mind that your sense of smell can sometimes be a hindrance."
"They can't stay away from each other," Mrs Hudson says. "Stubborn as John is, he knows where he belongs."
Even now, after six months, it was hard to remember his return as anything but a nightmare. To John perhaps it had been less so - at least all he had had to grapple with was Sherlock's initial lie, which was being drowned out by the joy of having him back. Sherlock, on the other hand, had come back to see everything he had fought to come home to slipping right through his hands. And he couldn't even talk to John about it.
He checked his phone again, hoping he had somehow missed the chime of a new text message. Still nothing.
Molly took samples and placed them on the glass slides, positioning them under the bright light of the microscope. There were particle analysers she could have put the samples in, but like most scientifically-minded Psy she preferred taking a look by herself first, to see the bigger picture a machine would miss.
And less than a month from now, he would say these words out loud and he knew his voice wouldn't waver because he had never been surer of anything in all his life.
Sherlock had asked for one week where they could simply be the way they had been before all this. One week away from weddings and anything but the two of them and the case.
"I've never been much of a talker," a man's voice drawled from the shadows. There was an odd echo to it - it could have come from anywhere within the place and when Sherlock reached out with his mind to find the other Psy's mental plane, he came up empty. "But for you I might make an exception."
It was his own hand, yes, but it read as if it had been written by an entirely different person. He remembered Sherlock saying John had pushed him away, that he hadn't been able to drop him fast enough. It hadn't made sense to him then. He had thought he knew what his letter to Sherlock had said. And yes, there had definitely been some things in there that could have made things between them rather awkward. Still, he hadn't understood why Sherlock had withdrawn so completely after reading it.
With this chapter, I have reached the half-million word milestone on Ao3. Thank you all for reading along - your comments and kudos and recs are the reason I keep feeling inspired and excited about publishing my works for you.
Thank you so much for reading this far, for giving this story a chance and for letting me know what you think about it.
John turned his head and blinked at him. He had quite a couple of suggestions, actually, but rather suspected that Sherlock wouldn't like any of them.
"It happens," Sherlock said, shrugging the apology off. "Tell you what, I won't hold it against you if you promise not to mention any of this to John. He can get terribly cross with me when I smoke. I don't like upsetting him."
"What?," John spluttered. "If you can barely move in there, how do you expect this to be any easier with two of us crammed inside?"
"Him," Sherlock corrected. "Well, the other option is leaving him alone at home. You have seen the state of my kitchen the last time you were forced to come by, haven't you? Do you think my flat is a good place to keep a dog in unsupervised?"
Redbeard looked around at the sound of his name but seemed to realise that Sherlock hadn't called him. He returned his head to its former position and wagged his tail at John, whining softly. John found himself reaching out, burying his fingers in Redbeard's soft fur and giving his ears the apparently desired scratching. Brown eyes closed in abject bliss and the tail wagging intensified by several degrees.
"Because there was no sign of a murder weapon anywhere and in a house that old, everyone who has secrets will be hiding them in the attic. Narrativum, John. People always feel compelled to do what they have read in a story somewhere. It's ridiculous. All this wilderness around us and you can bet the killer left the weapon right here in this house. It's just waiting to be found. Now, if you will excuse me."
There was a skip next to him, blocking most of the light that came from the street lamp just around the corner.
John gave a short “Hmph” at that but it didn’t sound as put-out as he had probably intended it to. Did he notice that Sherlock still had his arms wrapped around him? Did he realise that Sherlock’s body language was saying so much more than he dared to put into words?
"Mystery writer, eh?" John said, smiling. Then he frowned. "And what are we? Friends? In a relationship?"
It was too much. These words, everything he had ever wanted to hear, four years and a wedding too late. It couldn't be true, all evidence to the contrary aside.
"Similar reasons, I suppose. Well, without the boyfriend. Sometimes you just get too much going through your head and need a way to unwind, you know?"
He pulled back a little, moved down a bit so he could nip and kiss at Sherlock’s long, pale throat. “Don’t bother holding back. I’ll make you beg soon enough.” He paused, then smirked. “Twice.”
Sherlock had not gone far. He sat about twenty feet downhill in the grass, his head in his hands. The mere sight of him made John's heart hurt.
He didn't think Sherlock would find much. There were always Psy around, of course, but not as many as in other parts of the city. The number of people in the square usually made Psy keep their distance, much like the Tube did. Perhaps they would get a couple of witnesses anyway. There was nothing like Sherlock being able to see the crime through the eyes of a witness. Sometimes, the PsyNet had its advantages.
for me to love. Someone I could love and be sure to have it returned. I don't know why I thought Mary fit the bill, but there you have it. It never occurred to me that you did. Greg had to tell me to my face."
Once they had left half an hour later, Sherlock moved over to the sofa, gave John a look and held up his datapad
Updates every Monday as per my usual schedule. Thank you all for following me down another rabbit hole ♥
He couldn't remember ever having been this incandescently happy. Just this once, he had everything he wanted.
John blinked and sat up straight, torn out of the blissful state Sherlock and his violin had kept him in for the past hour. He turned his eyes to the ceiling to see what the hell had caught Sherlock's attention this time.
It had always been that way, if he wanted to be perfectly honest about it. Sherlock just had that effect on him, made him want to be near, drew him in like a moth to the flame even if it burned him. Sherlock may be the one who had said he wanted to rebuild their friendship, but John could be honest enough to admit that so did he. He simply hadn't been brave enough to get up and do something about it. And now the universe itself had neatly solved the problem for him by throwing an even bigger problem in his face.
Sherlock shook his head. "There are too many people passing through here every day, too much data. And he didn't have to be close to her, he could have been anywhere. Just another commuter on his way to work. We will not find any answers here."
The young man shrugged apologetically. "We will need to check your blood pressure and heart rate, do a full lung capacity test and perhaps get an echocardiogram, check your reflexes ..."
He made it all the way to his bed, collapsing on the edge of the mattress with his elbows on his knees and his face buried in his hands. He felt mildly sick.
The spoons he had just pulled from their kitchen drawer slipped from Sherlock’s grasp and clattered loudly on the floor. He whirled around to take in John’s face, slack-jawed with surprise.
The kettle boils and John pours two cups of tea, adding the prerequisite amounts of milk and some sugar for Sherlock, then carries them into the sitting room.
"Stop it," John tries to admonish him, failing miserably. He's still grinning. "Shit, we're lucky most of the candles went out when the tree fell and didn't set anything on fire."
John could respect that. He didn't particularly like talking about his own scars, either. But at least he had had his therapist. The chances of Sherlock talking about this to anyone were below zero.
"Fine," comes the muffled reply and it takes him a moment or two to realize that both his question and Sherlock's reply could be interpreted in two rather distinct ways. Of course by then it's already too late to not think about it and if something doesn't happen really soon ...
"I'm merely confirming a theory," Sherlock replied, not at all perturbed by her attitude. "If it had been self-inflicted, you would have had quite some trouble figuring that out."
Ages seemed to pass, or perhaps he merely blinked, and then he was in bed, still shaking from head to toe, and those same hands were there and he buried his face against a surprisingly hard chest and breathed in the long-missed, half-forgotten scent of home while Sherlock whispered senseless words of comfort in his ear.
"I suppose that is easier than to admit a psychopath was hiding in the Net all along and using Silence and his twisted Telepathy to murder changelings and Psy alike," Sherlock noted. "They will want to forget it ever happened and they will definitely want to keep the broader populace from finding out. There has been too much bad press about the PsyCouncil and Silence recently. With all these high-profile defections and their recent losses in skirmishes with the DarkRiver and SnowDancer packs around San Francisco and in the Sierra Nevada, they are already in a precarious position. The Council will try to keep its hold on the Protocol for the time being. Don't expect them to admit Jim Moriarty ever existed. As far as they are concerned, Silence is flawless and does not fail."
"It took them over twenty minutes to realise I had accessed the building using a stolen ID," Sherlock pointed out. "Despite the fact that the ID had your photograph on it."
Sally opened the bag and rummaged around in it. She wasn't entirely sure about unleashing him, but there had to be something she could do to entertain him with.
John found himself staring back, unable to break the intense connection as Sherlock's gaze grew heated.
Even as the thought crossed his mind, he stepped closer to Sherlock and reached out, the gesture unthinking, to wrap one hand around the back of Sherlock's neck and pull him down so he could press his nose to the Psy's throat and just breathe.
John chuckled. "Uh-huh. It's all right, love. You don't have to hide this from me. I'd like to know what happened, too. Who did it and why. It'd be nice to know whom I have to thank."
He wonders, sometimes, if John realises that Sherlock is aching in ways he never could have imagined five years ago, that Sherlock is gasping for air, that Sherlock is going out of his mind counting raindrops, replaying every instance John ever touched him and wishing he had more memories to go on. Wishing he had more reality to go on to keep him afloat.
John's ears turned in the direction of the window as he became aware of a car turning into Baker Street. It stopped right in front of 221b. He stayed where he was, listening to the doors opening and closing.
The speed with which he had adapted to his circumstances was impressive – Sherlock wondered how much of it was due to John's army training and general ability to adapt to new situations quickly. After all, he had easily settled into their life together as well, fitting into Sherlock's life as easily as if he had always been a part of it. By now, he could no longer imagine anything else.
Sherlock nodded very seriously. "Yes, of course. Her first day at school. Her first holiday in France. Her first meltdown over homework. Her first loose tooth..."
"Nope. I'm afraid I left them at home. For some weird reason, I didn't expect us to require scissors at a public pool."
He softened his voice. "Sherlock ... he's ... he's treating you right, yeah? You, uh, you know if he ever does anything to hurt you, you can just walk away, right? You've got friends. If he is in any way-" he hesitated, not wanting to say 'abusive'. People tended to shy away from the word, to clam up because this sort of thing only ever happened to other people.
It was an anchor and a lifeline, a pulsing thing of love and rage and fear. And it pulled him straight to Sherlock.
She wonders sometimes if this is the feeling that has Holmes rushing off and chasing after killers without backup. If she got a hot lead now, she honestly doesn't know what she would do.
He decided to ignore Sherlock for the moment and focus on taking in their home with every sense he had - first and foremost his nose.
Sally does. Molly is half an hour away and - to no one's surprise - drops everything to rush to Baker Street.
Gasping and cursing, he managed to get upright, leaning against the train carriage until his legs stopped trembling. He thought he might have bruised a rib on the tracks but it hardly mattered. He needed to get to Rosie. He would have time to recover later.
Was it possible that John really was that clueless? That he could be jealous of other people's attentions to Sherlock but still tell him to go and pursue them without realising the contradiction of thought and action? That he could spend all evening staring at Sherlock with open appreciation of his looks and then go home to his fiancée whom he claimed to love?
Nodding to himself, John reached for the thermos flask Sherlock had indicated earlier and began to fill the mugs they had brought.
He rolled onto his side, closer to Sherlock, and gently petted his hair, letting the curls snag at his fingers. Sherlock made a soft sound and nudged into the touch, so John repeated the gesture. Sherlock hummed a little and opened one bleary eye.
"Mr Holmes, if I understand your earlier words correctly, you believe my husband was going to consult you on some matter?"
"What I mean is, if you do not tell Sherlock to do this job for me, I will ensure that no one will be available to officiate on your wedding day, the catering will fail to show up and most of the guests won't be able to make it in time because of an inconvenient road blockage. Do you understand me?"
Sally spends the night in her old bedroom, sharing the bed with her sister. Her brothers are camped out on the sofa in the sitting room. All of them were too tired and full to even consider going back to their own homes. Only Marcus, her eldest brother, has shepherded his family back home. They live two doors down, though, so it's not like they had far to go.
John stepped forward and picked it up, turning the ring over and over in his hand. The inscription was rough under his fingers and he read it again. XXIX-I.
"I really don't think so," Sherlock said. "But it's never a bad idea to know all the circumstances. So, was it active?"
"I never saw you wear it," John murmured. "Not until after we argued about the divorce papers that first time."
he had said in his best man speech. But Mary hadn't loved him all that much, in the end, and that only left one person. John couldn't help but wonder if Sherlock had meant it.
Not knowing is okay. Not being ready quite yet is also okay. Both imply a future of knowing, of being ready eventually.
"What is it?" Lestrade asked. Clearly his patience had abandoned him and he stepped into the flat, curious to see what it was that they had discovered.
John whined in agreement, thumping his tail against Sherlock's legs. He was getting hungry and a walk sounded good, even if it was a very very short one into the back yard so he could relieve himself.
"We have a solution. I'll send a car to Baker Street to pick you up and take you to Baskerville. Bring John along and hopefully we'll have this all resolved by tonight."
"Well, you stay right where you are and I'll make you something to eat," Mrs Hudson says, patting his hand. Sally wonders if she's deliberately ignoring what Sherlock just revealed. "And after that, you will go to bed. No arguments."
Sherlock shrugged. "Don't know yet. There were some interesting details but I'm not sure how they fit the picture. I'll have to replay the conversation in my head and see if I anything sticks out that didn't appear significant just now."
"This is my second batch," Mrs Hudson told her earlier. "A certain someone ate the first yesterday afternoon."
It takes her a moment to notice the sound of water gurgling through the pipes. Mrs Hudson wouldn't shower at this time of day, so it must be John.
John hadn't gone for longer than an hour or two without hearing Sherlock's heartbeat since this entire thing had started, a calming reminder that Sherlock was alive and nearby. The longest he had gone without the sound had been at the park with Donovan, and even then he had known precisely where Sherlock was and what he was likely to be doing.
"If you say so," John grumbled. "Still, a man can be vain every once in a while. And get that thing out of my ear," he snapped at an overeager scientist who had used his distraction to try and take his temperature. "Just because I'm not a dog anymore doesn't mean I won't bite."
"Molly is getting married next month," Sherlock said, talking right over him. "Which you would know, if you had bothered to stay in touch with her. Or anyone, really. Mrs Hudson has been quite upset. You didn't even stop to say hello to her yesterday."
"Yes, and thanks to my interruption, they have no idea about your engagement. Do stop and think for a moment, John. No one here knows you aren't interested in men, therefore no one thinks you are cheating on your fiancèe with me."
Instead of answering, John pressed his head a tiny bit more firmly to Sherlock's abdomen and closed his eyes again.
She softened a little. "It's just hard not to wonder, you know? Here I am, with a fiancé who is married to his best friend who won't sign the divorce papers. And I'm not stupid, John. I know what everyone thinks about the two of you. Or used to think."
"It was a camping trip and it was an absolute disaster - as if the entire universe had conspired against us. But we got through it without any major fights and I knew right then that she was the one," Arthur said, smiling at his wife. "You don't just let a woman prepared to fight a bunch of raccoons with a paddle in defense of our sandwiches go without a fight."
John shook his head. "You did. I'm sorry, this wasn't my intention. You're just so ..." He waved a hand, words failing him.
"What for?" John asks. "For respecting my personal boundaries for once? For not wanting to make me even more pissed off with you? If anything, I should be sorry. I can't believe I never noticed anything off about her. I lived with her for one and a half years! I wanted to marry her!"
He resolutely turned his back on the detective, unwilling to give in to the urge or - even worse - to have Sherlock somehow deduce it.
It was hard to tell in their gloomy sitting room but John thought the crests of Sherlock's cheekbones might be a bit less pale than they usually were.
London. A sea of twinkling lights and grumpy people working the nightshift. Snowflakes, tinted varying shades of grey by the smog, flutter softly to the ground where they instantly turn to mush. It's too cold for rain but too warm to turn the phrase 'walking on thin ice' into something a bit more literal and neck-breaking. The city is as calm and peaceful as it ever gets.
Crime picked up, or at least Lestrade called Sherlock about crime increasingly often, and they fell back into their usual rhythm of crime scenes and visits to Barts and Scotland Yard and post-case take-out or late-night visits to restaurants in whatever part of the city they happened to be in at the time.
"Make yourself at home," he muttered, pushing the chair opposite himself away from the table with his foot.
At least it was a distraction, Sherlock being here. Nothing but the surprise of seeing him here could possibly have pulled him out of his helpless terror for Rosie.
This particular client had invited them to some sort of private fundraiser function because she was worried about someone stealing funds from her charity.
Emily shrugged. "Something else must have happened. Do you recall anything happening, anything at all, that would have triggered such a change? Did he have a recent break-up? Did a relationship go south? If he hasn't been getting enough physical contact on top of his refusal to shift, this might have increased his stress levels."
John smiled. "Of course not. Thank you. I'm sure he'll be able to arrange something to get him off on a technicality."
"I'll have you know that I can eat whatever I want. And you certainly don't get a say in it," Lestrade grumbled, then added "Hello John, how's it going?" when John, tail wagging, approached him.
It turned out to be a rather short moment indeed, for a moment later John had wrapped his arms around him and unceremoniously picked him up. Before Sherlock quite knew what was happening, the room spun around him and a moment later he was sitting on the opposite side of the tub with John on top of him, grinning that dangerous smile of his that had been the precedent to bullets and fists flying. Sherlock suspected with no little thrill that he was in for quite another sort of retribution this time around.
He made sure that the knives were all still safely tucked into the holster around his leg and pulled one out, leaving the gun tugged away in his shoulder holster. Guns, while neat over a distance, weren't his preferred weapon. A throwing knife, on the other hand ... now that was a weapon you didn't want to see your opponent use.
Finally, he put his datapad aside and went to bed, wondering what the next day would bring. For once, he did not wake screaming.
He sighed and forced himself to pay attention to the food he was loading onto his plate. There was no point in wracking his brain about the issue. There was nothing he could do about it.
John gave a low rumble in reply, then turned his head to nuzzle at Sherlock's face, blatantly disregarding the threat a fully armed team of predatory changelings represented.
“They are going to fade quite a bit,” he said. “Scar tissue usually does after a while. I’m sure they’re already a lot better than when you first came home.”
"I'll be there, too," Tyson added. "But first I want to get back to the conversation Hanson just interrupted with his little adventure."
After that came what felt like an entire questionnaire, specifically designed to be answerable with clear 'yes' or 'no' options - or in this case, whuff or growl.
Sherlock looked away again and bit his lip. There was an odd expression on his face that John couldn't quite place.
The compliments, the effort John had gone to in order to spend time with him, every look and every kind word he had said ... it had all been a means to an end. And he had truly been so stupid as to think that John had ever wanted anything but for him to sign these bloody papers.
Side by side, they lost themselves in the maze that was the massive Westfield Shopping Centre once more. The excursion had done wonders for John's mood and he felt decidedly light and happy. Every now and then he stole a sideways glance at Sherlock to find the hint of a smile hovering around the corner of his mouth. It looked a bit mischievous.
"Hardly surprising," Sherlock said calmly, ignoring the glare she sent in his direction. "Psy do not socialise."
He used his TK to switch on the lights, hoping that using his power would help deplete it a bit more and buy him some additional time before the dissonance inevitably set in.
"Guns down," Lestrade ordered. "And don't approach Sherlock, unless you want me to explain to your families that you died because you were being stupid."
"It's been more than nine months since my divorce, I think I'm good," John replies, clearly thinking in an entirely different direction.
Here's a little secret: John isn't very good at making tea. It's reliably free of chemical additives that don't naturally belong in tea, but that's about all that can be said about it. Sherlock, on the other hand, makes tea as if he learned it in a tea ceremony somewhere in rural China in the 19th century. Except for the chemicals, of course, but he does make an effort not to put these in these days and even washes out the cups beforehand.
He couldn't be sure in the dim light but he thought he saw the corner of Sherlock's mouth tilt upwards. "Of course not, John."
Of course he had seen humans and changelings touching each other, had seen them hold hands and hug and kiss. But somehow, despite John's explanation of intimate skin privileges so long ago and despite his own rudimentary understanding of copulation, he had never quite realised that touch was not restricted to hands alone.
Sally nods at the officer by the door and he opens it. Another officer comes in, carrying a duffel bag. He sets it down on the table between them. Sally puts on her gloves and opens it, reaches inside and pulls out the rifle. "Interesting laser pointer you've got mounted on there. What's it like, being engaged to a man you were prepared to kill three years ago?"
