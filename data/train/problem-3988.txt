Sam picks up another one. This time it's the one closest to the trash can. The markings are a bit sharper than the paper before. Almost more angry. It appears some words are smudged but still legible.
"Last time I checked, but with no angel or juiced up kid on standby, it's a bit more tricky. There are other ways to access the Veil, but they aren't as reliable. Magic always comes with a cost," he sighs.
Like clockwork, Dean wakes up a little over four hours later. He sits up and rubs the sleep from his eyes. Sighing, he considers telling Jody goodbye but decides not to disturb anyone. Instead, he leaves a note on the refrigerator:
“Dean, you don’t belong here. I made my decision to save Jack and I would do it again,” he grins. Tears form in both of their eyes. Pulled apart once more, but Dean shakes his head, refusing to accept it. “I appreciate you saying it back,” Castiel softly says.
” It mentioned a plethora of lore regarding reapers, but Sam was focusing on the chapter dedicated to the mystical physiology aspects. The passage described ways on how to obtain reaper’s blood while in the Veil, including magic. Sam safely assumed that astral projection is second to magic, and if a psychic was able to land them in the Veil, then so could a witch.
"Fine," Claire deadpans, looking at Dean in her peripheral. He’s mindlessly twirling a lump of spaghetti, staring at the gap forming on his plate.
"No offense or anything, you are cute, but you look like shit. I see a lot of people, everyday, and I’m pretty good at reading people - comes with the job. I can tell you’re hurting. I won’t begin to guess who hurt you or what, but,” she trails off. “To be honest, it looks like you've been to Hell and back. I am just asking because you look like you could use a pick me up." She leans forward, speaking softly, "I can get you something stronger than whiskey. Not me personally, but I know a guy.”
Once again, he calls Castiel. Even though it's pointless. Even though he looks like a widower who can't let go. He calls Cas. The voicemail picks up again and Dean listens but he decides to not hang up. Not yet. The dial beeps, waiting for a voicemail to be recorded and Dean is still. He breathes in, motioning to speak, but stops. He hangs up. Anger rises in his chest.
All three are silent for quite a while. Their breakfast grows cold but no one pays it any mind. "What if it's a sign?" Eileen questions.
Dean isn't too surprised to see her here but is happy for Sam nonetheless. "Morning, Eileen. I hope sasquatch here didn't take up the whole bed."
in his head for a few moments. But he's met with silence like every other time. Dean accepts this and wipes his tears away, picks the cart up, grabs the broom and dustpan from the kitchen and picks up his mess. He can't have Sam see what a hypocrite he truly has become.
Castiel eyes Dean with a knowing, sorrowful look. “Dean, I didn’t mean to hurt you with what I confessed. I’m sorry.”
Glancing at his watch, Sam realizes the delay. “Yea. It’s been almost an hour. Claire seems to be alright for now, though.”
Dean spits up blood from the pressure and his eyes begin to roll back. The Shadow laughs, satisfied. Preparing the final blow, Castiel interrupts, throwing the Shadow back. Dean hoarsely coughs, filling his lungs, regaining his composure, and sees Castiel swaying above him. Immediately, the flowing blue light returns its connection to Dean. The Shadow laughs dryly.
"Well, with the objects I will be able to conjure your friend. It won't truly be him, but you'll be able to talk to him. Touch him even." Lucian smirks. "I just need a personal object of his, something that maybe belonged to him or is connected to him, and a picture of him. It's quite a simple spell."
He all but trips, racing up the steps with Eileen in tow. The anxiety and concern emitting from Dean is tangible. She tries to muster an explanation out of him, but Dean stays focused on the isolated asphalt.
“When an angel possesses a human, they leave behind traces of their grace.” Then, Dean has an epiphany.
The young girl plays with a strand of her greasy hair, and looks to her right. Dean snaps his fingers in front of her. “Hey!”
"Yes. Michael's grace will successfully open the portal to the Empty and with Claire's connection to Castiel you will be able to pass through."
"Cas," he breathes. Not able to reach out or hug him yet. Dean blinks and sees two Castiel's for a moment. He shakes his head to clear his vision. "I have so much I want to say."
“The hell are you thinking? I told you to leave this shit alone. We have a way to save, Cas!” Dean says, voice steady and his jaw tense as he advances toward Sam.
The demon remains unprovoked. Dean pulls out the demon knife, threatening him. Eyeing the blade, the demon answers. “Alright, alright. I don’t know this for certain. I have just heard rumors, okay. Demons talking. But apparently Rowena was visited by the new God.”
It's 6:35 pm and nothing has come across the wire. Social media is quiet, so Sam texts Eileen that the date is a go. She replies five minutes later, ready to go and excited to see Sam. Dean offers to let Sam take the Impala out to pick Eileen up. For once in a long time, Sam is excited. When he reaches the garage door, Sam glances back at his brother and sees him nursing a brand new whiskey bottle. Sam frowns at the sight. Dean deserves to feel excited, to be happy. Sam will go on this date with Eileen, tell her about Cas, and they will come back to help Dean. Help Dean get his best friend back.
Dean ponders Sam's offer for a moment. "What about the people that will die, if we don't save them?"
Dean speed dials Sam's number to check in. Knowing his brother, Sam is probably calling all hospitals, morgues and county jails within a fifty mile radius.
“Whoever is listening, please let this work. With everything that’s happened, this has to work. It needs to work.”
Dean licks his lips. His mind is swirling with apprehension, yearning, and disdain. Every fiber of his being knows this is wrong. Every nerve fires off throughout his body, telling him to turn around and leave- go home. And yet, he stays. The house creaks in silence and it makes Dean's stomach turn. The smell of incense lingers in the air. It reminds Dean of moments after a rainstorm. When the atmosphere is still thick with moisture and grass drips with the afterthoughts of the storm.
"Dude, what the hell happened? Say something. You alright?" Dean glances over Sam, and around the bunker, checking for any intruders.
"Already did. Here ya go," Sam slides Dean's mug across the island, "your highness," Sam says under his breath.
Dean walks forward and picks up the photo of Castiel. The few droplets of the warlock's blood have ruined the picture, but Dean takes it anyway. It's Cas.
Dean waves his brother off and slumps into the chair in the library. It's not very comfortable. In fact, the wooden back is digging into his thoracic spine and causing some pain. But it's better than the alternative. The alternative of thinking about what he's lost, who he's lost, and how he lost them.
This whole situation seems off. He watches her, puzzled. Dean takes the napkin and reads the address. He recognizes the street but he’s never been around that area personally. “What did you mean by the police don’t believe in this stuff? Cops bust drug deals all the time.”
“Something told me to bring my Dead Man’s blood nail bomb. It slowed them down, but,” Kaia steals a glance at Claire. “Not without Claire getting hurt. I got out in time, thinking she was right behind me. I turned back to the warehouse and she wasn’t there. So I started to panic and ran back inside. The vamps were mostly cowering in pain, except one had Claire pinned.” Kaia tucks her hair behind her ear, and swallows deeply. Dean sits up, concerned even though Claire is sitting right in front of him. Kaia recounts that evening.
The room is silent. Dean and Jody are both glaring at Claire, but with a hint of relief and confusion. Alex is pouring her third glass of wine. Dean begins to reach for his whiskey in his jacket pocket, until he remembers what is actually inside. Claire finally makes eye contact with Jody. “Is anyone going to say anything?”
“Right," the warlock smirks. He carefully places the book back on the shelf and turns back to Dean. "Well, there are a few things to help you see him again. I can offer to place you under a hallucination spell, but those can be tricky. There's also an herb tea that could possibly lead you to him. Think of it as a vision walk, though, they're based solely on the subconscious and unpredictable."
"Right. Can I have my picture back?" Dean points to the desk where the contents for the spell remain. Lucian gestures him forward.
Sam and Dean share a knowing look before everyone gets into position for the spell. Jack stands off to the side while Dean and Claire face each other, holding hands. Walking slowly, with her hands in loose fists, Kaia joins Jack.
But he doesn't remember his last encounter with the angel. It's gone. The last moment he sees is him and Castiel running from Billie, standing in the dungeon about to die. Then telling Sam and Jack, Castiel saved him. That Cas is gone.
She sighs, glancing past Dean at the library where Sam stood merely thirty minutes ago. He  was reading from a book titled, “
“Right, but Michael, a fucking archangel, flaunted my ass - twice. There’s gotta be some juice left in me. It’s worth a shot,” he sounds almost hopeful.
"I know about Cas." Dean's eyes widen slightly. "At least I know there's more to the story. You didn't tell me everything and I know whatever happened is eating away at you." Dean gestures to dismiss Sam. "Dean, I know you. I can see it. I know when you get like this it's because of something close to you." Sam pauses. "I also read some of your crumpled up papers." A dark look crosses Dean's face. Almost like he wants to punch Sam.
“So, who pissed in your Cheerios?” Dean asked under his breath, crossing his arms while he monitored an impromptu soccer game.
Dean grinned. “You were that bored? You know, you could have just called in your super-hot secretary for a… how do I put this delicately for your virgin ears? Oh, I know! You could’ve gotten your head out of your ass, called that beautiful lady into your office, and kissed her senseless.”
The ‘Dean-is-straight’ thing was bothering Cas, too; why had Dean offered to ‘get out of here’? Why had Dean done anything at all in regards to Castiel, other than ask why Cas was staring? Castiel sighed, rubbing his eyes. “Well, I was watching him sing,” he explained, resigned. This was going to be a long night.
Cas growled, burying his face in Dean’s shoulder. “No,” he mumbled petulantly, clinging tighter. “I like it right where I am.”
Dean swore and untangled his limbs from Castiel’s, giving the smaller man a placating kiss on the forehead. “Sorry, Cas, I completely forgot. No wonder Sammy was so pissed at me.”
’, Dean tossed the smaller man onto the bed, grinning predatorily at the flushed face. “I’ve wanted to do this for a while,” he sighed, peeling off his tee and tossing it over his shoulder before kicking the door closed behind him.
Castiel stepped in, offering helpfully, “I’m Gabriel’s brother. I’ve recently decided to move, and since Dean is friends with my brother, and Gabriel is a terrible friend, he has foisted me off on Dean as an attempt to familiarize me with my surroundings. Dean told me that I would have to visit the Roadhouse to truly start to ‘fit in’.”
Dean relaxed a little, giving Cas a light kiss and an apologetic grimace before jogging into the living room. “Robbie! Your mom’s here!”
Dean visibly reddened, throwing the package of popcorn into the microwave. “Swayze always gets a pass!”
“You’re gonna burn the eggs!” Dean chuckled at his brother’s admonition, returning his focus to the scrambling eggs in the frying pan. He lowered the heat, scooping a healthy amount onto his syrup-soaked plate, at which point Sam pretended to gag.
Dean blushed, glaring at Cas half-heartedly. “Make that a Dr. Pepper,” he amended, giving the waitress a charming smile and reaching over the table to take Cas’s hand again.
Dean sighed softly. “Can’t we just kiss some more?” He jutted out his lower lip, which made Castiel grin in amusement and want to press gentle kisses all over Dean’s face.
“Uncle Dean, I’m hungry,” Robbie complained, wriggling around in Castiel’s lap until he was facing the blond man.
Once they were safely hidden away in the alley, Dean loosened his grip on Cas’s hand. He opened his mouth to say something, but before he could ask what was happening, he was shoved forcefully against the brick wall, and Castiel’s lips were on his own, teasing, tasting, and nipping gently.
Castiel wrinkled his nose. “That is abhorrent, Gabriel,” he admonished, frowning at his older brother, who just stuck out his tongue.
His boyfriend paused, hands just ready to shove down his jeans. Instead, his smile widened. “Okay,” he murmured, taking slow, careful steps to the bed. Dean didn’t take his eyes off of Castiel’s once, crawling across the bed to straddle the smaller man, hips jerking involuntarily. Cas moaned loudly, reaching out to run his hands up and down Dean’s chest. He tried to lift up his hips, seeking friction, but Dean’s hands were pinning him to the bed. “Not so fast, baby,” Dean whispered, nipping Castiel’s neck gently. His teeth caught the collar of Castiel’s button-up shirt and tugged, making Cas whimper. “Are you gonna be a good boy for me, and sit still, or am I going to have to take this off the hard way?”
“Fuck, baby,” Dean whimpered, his hand snaking into his boxers, gripping his still achingly hard cock. He hissed at the touch, starting to jerk when Castiel’s hand brushed the tip and Dean cried out.
…” Gabriel grinned, pumping his fist in the air before yelling at the top of his lungs, “Yeah, Cassy, GET SOME!”
Gabe snorted. “As if. No, never Michael. He’s too proud to ask anything of anyone, even if he was dying.” Dean waited for Gabriel to share which of his brothers it had been, but after standing in relative silence for the better part of three minutes, he decided to go back to guessing.
Gabriel beamed. “That’s wonderful, Cassy!” He hesitated. “You aren’t going to, well… What you did previously?”
Hi guys, it’s been,,,,, seven years, holy shit. So earlier this year, I thought to myself “I will never write for the supernatural fandom again” and then, of course, 2020 completely derailed my plans. I’m back in my spn phase, and currently rewriting this au, coincidentally. I’m gonna make it into a new story, because it’s going to be reworked so much, but I figured I might as well post what’s been sitting in my google docs for years to here. Enjoy?
. He listened to Dean babble drunkenly the rest of the way, absently agreeing with all of Dean’s nonsensical ideas. He pulled into the apartment complex’s parking lot ten minutes later, smiling at the man in his passenger seat. “Are you ready?”
“What the…?” Cas asked grumpily, but it didn’t take long for him to realize the problem. Dean bent over, clutching his stomach, and promptly vomited.
The sandy-haired teen grinned sheepishly. “I convinced Dani to reconsider kicking me out. She stuck to her original plan, though, after a week, when she found me making out with her sister.”
, Dean thought as he did his head count to make sure everyone had arrived. “Hi, everyone!” he announced in his most soothing tone. “Welcome to kindergarten! I’m Mr. Winchester, and that is Mr. Gabe, but you can call me Fitch.” He winked conspiratorially, and a few of the kids giggled. One boy looked confused and raised his hand, much to Dean’s pleasure. “Go ahead and tell us your name while you’re at it, soldier.”
Dean hissed, his grip on Castiel’s ass tightening fractionally. “Is your brother here?” he demanded, fumbling with the handle of Castiel’s door. At Castiel’s faint ‘
Gabriel chewed his lower lip thoughtfully. “Cassy, you know I love Fitch; you’ve heard me talk about him in my work stories.” Castiel nodded, smiling slightly at Dean’s nickname. Gabriel continued. “But are you sure you want a relationship, even if it’s a purely physical thing, with someone so deeply in the closet?”
etc. It was not a face Dean was fond of. But, he figured, he probably deserved it. Sam had supported him ever since he had dared to desire the dream of teaching, and Dean had just ditched part of a ritual that Sammy had started to help Dean get back to himself after teaching had proved more stressful than Dean had prepared himself for. So, yeah, Sammy had a right to be pissed. “In my defense, I have to bring up the hot-chick clause,” Dean threw in helpfully, hoping to get even the slightest grin. The hot-chick clause was a rule that the brothers had put in place when they were nineteen and fifteen, respectively (Dean had been doing it for longer, but it was the first time Sammy had recognized it as a real excuse) when Sammy had met a hot girl who wanted to
“If you tell me what the hell is going on with you today. You’ve snapped at three kids, broke a paintbrush, and you’ve pretty much been giving death stares since you got in,” Dean replied, his eyes flickering between the kids and Gabriel’s face.
Dean grinned. “Garth is a third-grader. He’s in one of the other classes Gabe helps out with, and he’s kind of a problem kid. He needs a freaking para*, and we have an opening, but nobody’s signing up.” He scowled, frustrated with the school system, but shook his head. “Anyway, Garth’s mom doesn’t get off work until fifteen minutes after school is over, and she’s got a half-hour commute from where she works to the school. So Gabriel asked me if I’d let Garth start hanging out in my room until his mom gets there. He’s a little weird, but he grows on you.”
“Let me take care of you, baby,” Cas whispered, kissing Dean’s lips gently before flipping their positions. Dean’s last coherent thought was how beautiful Cas looked with his lips wrapped around Dean’s throbbing erection.
Sam released Dean with a goofy grin on his lips. “Dean’s in loooooove,” he singsonged, and he reached in to pinch his brother’s cheeks with an evil look in his eyes.
“Dean!” Cas cried indignantly, attempting to smooth down his raven locks. “Actually,” he said tentatively, “I’m no longer unemployed.”
Castiel’s eyes darkened with lust, fixed on the half-naked man in front of him. He wanted to say something, tell Dean to hurry, tell him to touch him, to tell him something,
Dean paled, breathing in sharply. “I, uh..” he stumbled over his words, trying to find an explanation, but it seemed he didn’t need one.
After a good half hour, Dean was enjoying Sammy’s bullshit cop show. The police officers were major douchebags (seriously, who wears sunglasses at night? And that synchronized badge-flipping thing they all did? Totally fake) but it was always satisfying to see anyone, even assholes, put away the bad guys. Plus, it was sort of gory and those were Dean’s favorite sort of movies. He snorted as one of the detectives interviewed some scantily-clad jogger. If only joggers dressed like that in real life, Dean thought wryly, which lead to him wondering if Cas jogged. Dean grinned; he could just see it now: the way those silky athletic shorts would ride low on Cas’s slim hips, a sweat-covered tank top plastered to his surprisingly well-toned chest, leaving nothing to the imagination, that damn hair of his even more unruly than usual, and his eyes – those baby blues would be dark, Dean decided, like they were when they were hooded with lust.
“Are you going to tell me how the fuck you got Dean Winchester, ultimate straight dude, lemme tell you, Cassy, to fuck you?” Gabriel exclaimed impatiently.
Dean couldn’t resist. He sidled up to his boyfriend, sliding his arms around Castiel’s middle. “You’re a cute little housewife,” he whispered teasingly, pressing a kiss to Cas’s neck.
yours.” Gabriel gave his brother a knowing smirk, and Castiel blushed from his toes to the top of his head.
“Aw, Joseph, don’t be that way,” Dean called over his shoulder, swaggering over to the bar’s men’s room. He stood in front of the urinal, unzipping his jeans and sighing in relief, closing his eyes and leaning against the blue tiled wall. He shook himself off, rezipping, before going to one of the ancient porcelain sinks and staring into the cracked mirror. He studied his reflection while washing his hands, frowning as he concentrated on gold-flecked green eyes, a smattering of light freckles over the bridge of his nose, plump, pink lips, and bright white teeth.
Dean shakes his head, chuckling, and heads over to pour himself a glass of whiskey. “Yeah? What kinda stuff? Are we talkin’ sappy, chick-flick, or straight up gross?”
The first time they’d kissed, the first time they’d stumbled into his room with their hands all over each other, he’d had a clear purpose.
He put just a hair too much emphasis on that last part for it not to be a reference. A reminder. Dean feels strange and hot, almost feverish, and he shifts uncomfortably under Cas’ gaze.
“Yeah,” Dean says, his free hand tight on the steering wheel. “I… I want— um.” He breathes. “I’ll take anything as long as it’s with you, Cas.”
He’s still here, at least; he’s not leaving Dean alone, which is the only thing Dean had really been scared of. Dying alone. But instead of just
He also makes a pit stop in the kitchen to steal the bag of barbeque chips from the pantry. Y’know, for later.
Dean’s left knee doesn’t click when he scrambles to his feet, as he and Sam dart to Jack’s side, but his voice still cracks around Jack’s name. For a moment, the kid's face is still and slack. Then his eyes flutter open and he makes a small, puzzled noise. “Mmph?”
Cas winces slightly. “‘Sam Winchester, the boy with the demon blood.’ I never apologized for that, Sam. I’m sorry. I truly didn’t mean it the way it sounded.”
Cas’ lips are warm against his, and Dean’s heart is thudding in his ears as he gently taps Cas’ wrist. He opens his mouth, exhales, and Cas breathes in just like Dean told him to: slow and careful, their mouths bumping together. Dean moves away, just far enough to see the glitter of reflected light in Cas’ eyes, and listens as Cas lets the breath back out.
“Jesus, Dean.” Sam sighs. “No, I’m not happy. I just want you to, y’know. Get somewhat better, eventually. And I’m sorry, but I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t know how to help you.”
Dean’s still holding his breath. Oops. Ducking his head a little, he blows what smoke is left in his mouth out in a thin, secretive stream before turning back to Cas. “Um. Hey.”
He scowls and forces himself to do it. Predictably, he regrets it as soon as the pill slips out of his hand, landing in the water with a pathetic little
for… for shutting down. I hate it. But I can’t help it, I don’t…” He screws up his mouth, bringing one hand up to cover his eyes. “I don’t know how to be yours.”
To his incredible surprise, though, he’s not the first one to crack. Sure, he’s getting low enough on his stash of sleeping pills that he’s starting to get concerned, and it’s getting harder and harder not to
Castiel will not allow harm to come to Dean. To Sam, to Bobby. To the world. He will save them, no matter the cost.
He has to scrap the whole thing and start over. He knew he was out of practice, and it’s not like he was ever a
Lucifer wheedles, leaning in a little. “You haven’t stopped looking at me since I showed up. This hot and cold treatment is really throwin’ me for a loop, babe. No wonder Cassie waited so long to spill the beans.”
He doesn’t try to match Dean. He just takes a few small sips of his drink, waiting until Dean’s done pouring his third measure. Then he raises his eyebrows. “Ready?”
The guy stays remarkably calm, considering Dean was probably never supposed to see this. He leans in to read the message Dean’s pointing to, the one that
He leaves Castiel kneeling in the centre of the clean, bright room, muttering something about speaking with Bobby and Sam before they make any decisions.
Dean gets up at a reasonable time. He sits at the table and reads the newspaper on his phone while Sam makes breakfast, takes his meds with his coffee and eats what gets set in front of him, sprinkling in some annoyance about Sam’s health nut shit whenever the situation demands it. Then they get dressed and go on a walk; doctor’s orders. “Mild physical activity” until he doesn’t feel like an octogenarian, and then slowly working back up to normal levels. Well, normal for normal people. It’ll probably take him a little longer than the upper estimate of eight weeks until he can take out a werewolf or a vampire again. Which he fully plans on doing. But that depends on whether he’s able to convince Sam he’s not about to eat a bullet or walk into a knife.
Cas— his thumb strokes comfortingly up and down a small stretch of Dean’s spine, just a few times, and it’s all Dean can do not to slump forward into his shoulder as Cas speaks. “We can leave. This is largely unnecessary, at this point. We’ve already been seen together enough to get the rusalka’s attention.”
Sam flounders for a moment; what kind of test would even work, here? Silver and holy water are the obvious route, but Rowena’s had Hell in a vise grip since Jack took over, and a shifter or some other monster would have to have some pretty damn big balls to try and pull this off.
And before Dean can even open his mouth to ask what that means, Jack is reaching up to press two fingers to Dean’s forehead, his nose scrunched up in concentration.
They haven’t even started drinking, and Sam is already regretting this. There’s a careless, nihilistic spark in Dean’s eye, in the crooked sickle of his smile, and it scares him. But…
Jack leans into Sam’s side, and Sam squeezes him a little tighter. He’s doing his best not to cry, but this is, uh. He’s pretty sure it’s a losing battle.
“Does it hurt?” Dean asks quietly, his voice small, his hands clenched in his lap. “I can— d’you want— I think we’ve got some frozen peas. If— if it hurts.”
Dean gets into the car, his plastic bag crinkling loudly in his hand. He rummages around for a second, then pulls out one of those god awful bears and twists around in his seat to hand it to Cas.
Sam’s looking like the most insufferable son of a bitch that’s ever walked the earth when Dean turns around. “Congratulations,” he says, leaning back in his chair and folding his hands over his stomach.
The place isn’t too far outside of Lebanon. It’s beautiful, Dean supposes: situated in a sunny clearing and surrounded by trees. There’s a little walking trail he can see next to it that leads off into the woods, and there are only two steps leading up to a porch that runs along the whole front side of the cabin. It looks lived-in, cosy. Dean couldn’t care less.
It’s not Charlie he sees first, though. A bark echoes through the trees, and Dean’s face cracks like a glacier around a small, honest-to-god smile as Miracle comes bounding up, scrambling up onto the bench next to him and covering his face in slobbery, excited licks. “Hey, buddy,” he says warmly, ruffling the fur below Miracle’s ears and scrunching his nose against the ecstatic assault. “Missed me?”
He’s been expecting some sort of intervention ever since he yelled at Sam that night last week, but this isn’t what he thought it’d be like. Not at all. Sam is
A flame leaps up at the flick of his thumb, and he brings it to the tip of the joint. He remembers enough to know not to treat this thing like a cigarette: trying to take a drag while lighting it would fuck everything up. So he just watches the end of the joint and turns it slowly, making sure the cherry that’s slowly forming is even all the way around.
“I can be plenty coordinated when I feel like it,” he says back thoughtlessly, grinning. Then he realizes how that sounds. His grin fades.
Dean picks up the glass of water carefully, not quite trusting his hands to play along, and raises it in a toast once he’s sure he’s not gonna spill it all over himself. “Cheers.”
Cas can’t hide his surprise every time he glances up to find Dean already looking back at him, but Dean can’t bring himself to drag his gaze away for more than a few seconds at a time. It’s still too unbelievable, still just a little too good to be true, and he’s scared witless that Cas’ll just…
Dean stands there, looking at Cas like there is nothing he would like more than to take him by both shoulders and
So Dean does. He points out Hydra, Ursa Major, and Virgo; in return, Cas points out a couple of bright spots and names the angels who created them.
Dean grabs his drink again. “You know me so well, Sammy.” He tosses it back and thumps the glass down onto the table between them when he’s done, putting both hands on his knees and pushing to his feet. “Well, thanks for the drinks, but I’m gonna call it a night.”
They end up driving the rusalka (Magda, she tells them with a sniffle when Cas asks) to her daughter’s house, a slim, dark-haired woman who’s probably older than she looks and whose eyes are just a little too big and silvery to be completely human. After a short conversation with Cas and her mother in whatever language it is they speak, she apologizes and thanks them for treating her mother kindly. Which is a funny way of saying “thanks you didn’t bash her head in with an iron rod”, but Dean doesn’t snort or anything, just accepts it with a slight nod. That’s about as gracious as he’s capable of being, right now.
Sam reads the case on Dean's laptop and begins to feel nauseated. He has a bad feeling. He, again, has a sense of deja vu. Two days in a row, it can't be a coincidence. It's like there is an itch at the back of his brain, crawling to the surface, wanting to show him something. He feels a headache come on and the pain is similar to when he used to get visions as a young adult. The pain grows stronger as the itch continues, pulling toward his frontal lobe.
Sam pulls the covers off and walks toward the kitchen for a glass of water. The bunker is quiet, peaceful even. He still hasn't gotten used to calling it home, not really. The thing about a home is, four walls don't constitute it. Family is similar. It's not based on who you're related to but who loves you and has your back. Family, a home, whatever they are things you build around you. He had learned that long ago.
“How does it feel knowing you came all this way to say I love you and it wasn’t good enough?” Dean grimaces as the Shadow connects another fist to his cheek. His left cheek is swollen and bright red.
"Well good morning to you too," Sam replies a bit offended. He's flipping bacon as Dean yanks the tongs out of his grip. "What- I am making breakfast. Can I not make breakfast?"
Riley eyes him. “You’re not a cop, are you?" She asks, carefully. Dean looks at her questioning the sudden inquiry and shakes his head.
This story is evolving to something bigger than just a fix-it fic....oops. I didn't have anything in this chapter in mind until I starter writing lol but angst/pain is where my heart is content. Then followed with a happy ending. So buckle up :)
Dean clenches his jaw. "I don't know. Not all angels were good. A lot of them were dicks, but I don't know if that constitutes them going to Hell."
"It was my choice, Dean. I did it for you. It's always been you." Dean reaches out for Castiel's hand and his fingers are freezing. Dean looks at Castiel with worry.
"I tried everything! I can't save you! There's nothing left! How could you do this to me, you son of a bitch," Dean cries. He places his hands on either side of his head, thinking. "Jack! How can you just leave us? We need you. Cas needs you! Fuck this all powerful, all knowing God bullshit. We're family!" Dean tosses the cart over. "Isn't that enough?" He pauses and glances around for a moment. Nothing. "Dammit, Jack. Why won't you answer my prayers? I need some help!" He cries out and slowly sits down. "I can't do this on my own," he whispers between his sniffles. He begs over and over again
“Dean Winchester, welcome.” The man leans against a tall, cushioned red chair. He gestures ever-so gingerly with his fingers, coaxing Dean inside.
Although the whiskey does not keep the nightmares at bay it does keep him numb. That is enough to continue drinking. He reaches for the bottle and misses.
She scoffs. “He lied about Castiel, and now won’t say anything about that phone call like it’s some big secret? Keeping information from us like we don’t matter. You think you get to decide that? You selfish dick.” Dean gives her a look.
"It's possible," says Sam. "Maybe he has taken himself out of the narrative, but what if he's helping us still by guiding us through this vision?"
Dean has realized his mood swings are ridiculous lately. At one moment, he's super depressed and doesn't care about anything. He honestly doesn't care if he lives or dies.  The next moment he can't wait to see what life has to offer. It's as if his brain doesn't know how to comprehend what Castiel's sacrifice means to him. His thoughts can become so tangled and incoherent Dean doesn't know how to act - what to say. That's why he started writing down some of his thoughts, and then thought how much of girl that made him and crumpled the papers up. Right now, he can really use a moment to write down his thoughts.
Dean’s expression falters. He gasps as the new sliver of hope rips his heart out, shattering it. The demon, chuckling, closes in on Dean, whispers in his ear. His breath is hot and moist against Dean's neck. He shivers in disgust. “You must have known I was lying. But why don’t you say we kiss and make up?”
"'Hey, Sam?' What the hell, Dean? Where are you? You’ve been gone for like three hours!” Dean can hear the glare his brother is giving him through the phone.
Claire is buzzing with anticipation to hear what the hell Dean and Sam's conversation meant. It obviously has something to do with Castiel. No matter how much she pushed him to explain, Dean wouldn’t say anything.
“The difference is you get to keep the remainder of your soul. I take a part of it. You won’t be condemned downstairs, as far as I know at least.” He flashes his pearly, white teeth. His canines are wickedly pointed.
Dean chews the inside of his cheek, unsure for a moment until he remembers Claire has been possessed by an angel. Castiel, in fact. “My guess, angel grace,” he takes a swig from the glass of whiskey Alex pours him. “It’s a miracle she even had some left.”
"That's not true," Eileen says, with tears in her eyes. She reaches out and places her hand on Dean's cheek, pleading for him to understand how wrong he is.
Confusion crosses his face. “It’s like four in the morning. Why the hell are you eating at four in the morning?” She looks away. “Eileen,” he moves so she has to look at him. “Eileen, where’s my brother?”
"Just one. One connected to your friend since he was the object of our session. An important one as well." Lucian rubs his hands together with a smug look on his face.
"This is my voicemail. Make your voice...a mail." Dean closes his eyes at the sound of Castiel’s voice. He only speaks for two seconds but Dean hears every syllable. His brow creases and he clenches his jaw to bury the pain. Dean hangs up. He calls again.
Riley’s story is beginning to make more sense, but still so many unanswered questions. Dean gets out of the Impala, eyes on the open field, straight ahead. He glances around and goes to the trunk for his pistol. As he closes the hood, someone bumps into him.
He sloppily rises up and makes his wake toward the kitchen. Nothing really sounds appetizing except for some string cheese. Only, they don't have string cheese.
but my highest price is their soul. Or at least a part of it." Lucian removes the Necromancy book from the shelf for emphasis. "Necromancy is a unique subject. Most wouldn't dare to even consider it. You must be desperate." Dean swallows. "If you’re wanting me to perform some type of necromancy ritual, the price will be high.”
“I said wait,” he raises his voice, normal volume. Dean sighs before continuing. He knows he told Sam he wouldn’t do anything stupid, but he has to know. “There is one thing I need to know. If I am to make any kind of deal right now, I need to know something first.”
Switching directions multiple times, Dean becomes irritated as he wanders the darkness blindly. He begins to think the compass is useless and misleading him until in the distance he sees a tan speck. His heart begins to pound against his chest, breaking into a smile, Dean sprints forward.
The next morning Dean wakes to his Jack Daniel's replaced with three ibuprofen pills and a glass of water. Grateful, he slowly takes them one at a time due to the agonizing headache. Usually he doesn't have headaches or hangovers but the nightmares don't give him much rest. He really isn't able to sleep off the alcohol. Pressing the heel of his hands into his eyes to push back the headache, Dean sighs with exhaustion. He doesn't even know what time it is. His watch reads 4:32 but Dean is unsure if it's AM or PM.
Dean’s phone rings. He pulls it out of his pocket and the caller reads, “Sam.” He doesn’t want to deal with his brother’s concern or speech about self-destruction, so he declines the call. A notification for a voicemail pops up.
“He did a local beacon spell and believes there is a powerful warlock in the area. He’s on his way there now,” she says.
Dean glances between Eileen and Sam. Fiddling with a loose string on the end of his flannel sleeve, he sighs. On one hand, he'd love to see Castiel again. He'd do anything- to hug him and tell him all the things he didn't get to say. But on the other hand, he's so tired. So very tired. There are no leads. And he's lost all faith in his search to save Castiel.
He grabs his head and shakes the images away. Groaning in pain, he sees he's on the floor. He must have fallen while the vision took over. Eileen is at his side, freaked out. She's signing, "Are you okay?" over and over again.
Several miles pass and Eileen surrenders in her attempts to understand what's happening. So, she opts to stare out the passenger window, withdrawing her attention from the road. When a sudden jerk from the Impala forces her to the side, it causes her to shriek in surprise. Dean zooms forward and whips around in front of another vehicle, stopping it - stopping Sam. Tires screech against the asphalt, leaving rubber burns. The Impala is parked sideways, blocking both lanes of the road, but Dean disregards it. Both brothers hop out of their vehicles.
Lucian leans against his desk, holding onto the side. His shoulders slightly raise from the movement.
He rounds on Eileen, his brow creased. “Tell me where he is.” His face softens. “Eileen, please. I’ve already lost Cas. I can’t lose Sam too.”
"Dean," Sam starts. "You're giving up way too easily. There is always another way. Don't you always say that?" Dean doesn't respond. "I know how it may seem hopeless but we have options. We have the resources to continue the search to save him. You can't give up now, Dean. This is Cas."
Dean walks through the open field under the moonlight. He notices all the people lying on the ground earlier are gone. All the shady looking cars have disappeared too. He wonders if all of it is an illusion. Dead leaves crunch under his boots as he reaches the Impala. He glances at his watch; it reads 3:12. The leather seat of the car squeaks as Dean sits. He pulls out his cell phone and sees thirty missed calls.
Sam grabs the coin on the table and holds it out to him. "Both of you come back in one piece, alright?"
He removes his hand from Dean’s chest, and backs up. A sharp pain pierces Dean like a spear, seeing Castiel recoil from him. “Is this supposed to be some twisted version of good cop bad cop? You cut into my psyche and bleed me dry like an animal and then play nice?”
We're starting to get into the meat of the story, barely. I don't know how I feel about this chapter. I hope ye enjoy!
“Then we’ll cross that bridge.” Dean pats his brother on the cheek and gives him a knowing look. “Come on.” All three separate into the two vehicles. Dean in the Impala, Eileen and Sam in the other.
Dean sighs, pulling on his jacket. “We’re getting nowhere. I feel claustrophobic and cooped up in this damn place. I haven’t left in two weeks. I need to stretch my legs. Get some air. I promise I’ll be back before curfew, Mom,” he adds, rolling his eyes.
"It's not that, he's dealing with some, he's just-" Sam doesn't seem to know how to finish his sentence, or fully explain his brother's behavior.
“With all the research we have been doing, it’s been a bit difficult to keep up with groceries. So we didn’t have anything to eat. He’ll be back soon.”
He quietly shuts the front door and is back on the highway toward Lebanon. Dean pockets his phone and dials Sam’s number.
. He's thinking of "I love you's" and "Goodbye, Dean" and black goo. He's thinking of how the image of his best friend disappearing into a black mass of nothing is seared in his memory forever. He's thinking of how he didn't get to say goodbye, or anything really, and now he never will.
With that, Dean slams the demon knife into his stomach and twists the handle. The demon yelps in surprise and then falls to the ground. The night air ruffles the neck of Dean’s jacket. Even with the long sleeves, he still grows goose bumps on his arms. An owl sounds from across the street, in a tall bare oak tree. Dean feels like he’s in a warped moment of time. The midnight sky, the sound of the owl, silence from the road, and a dead body before him. He continues to stare down at the body for quite some time. His head becomes numb, but in the sense he doesn’t feel real. He hates this feeling. It’s how he felt when Chuck told Sam and Dean they have no free will. He writes their stories.
Dean moves his lips to speak. His mouth is dry. "Cas!" His voice cracks. "Cas!" Dean looks left to right and is met with darkness everywhere. "Castiel!"
“Eileen found it. She and Sam have been the brains behind this operation. I’ve been-I’ve been dealing,” Dean says, avoiding Castiel’s eyes. His guilt and shame rise to his throat, bubbling like acid.
Sighing, Sam places the glass in the sink and walks back to his room. His feet make a pit-pat noise, approaching the hallway. Dean's door is cracked open slightly with faint light seeping through. Sam turns toward the door and peers in. His face softens, taking in the scene. Dean is cuddling a pillow adorned with a worn, rough, blue pillow case. The light emits from a lone lamp on his desk. Some type of paper for a mechanic position sits atop a few books from the library. Sam eyes the paperwork, puzzled.
Dean finishes the whiskey bottle before Sam gets home and he's still not drunk enough. He rises from the chair and walks to the liquor cart. All the bottles are half empty or nothing but drops of whiskey, gathering at the bottom of the glass. He picks up one empty glass bottle and stares at it for several moments. His vision becomes distorted from the small glass textures, his left ear begins to ring from the silence as he falls into a trance like state. Then, a glint of sapphire reflects in the textured glass. It catches his eye; Dean swallows. Suddenly, he's thinking of Castiel.
He's angry at Castiel for leaving him. He's angry at Jack for leaving him. But most of all, he's angry at himself. At how he's failed to bring Castiel back. At how his best friend died and he didn't even say goodbye. At how he's known for a while his feelings about Castiel but never has the guts to admit it.
The song overhead changes from “Renegade” by Styx to “I Want to Know What Love Is” by Foreigner. Around the edges of the room, couples slow dance to the song.
"Reaper’s blood?" Jody inquires, and Dean nods in confirmation. "How does that work? Don't you have to be dead?"
Dean clicks the arrow for the next page, and it shows an error message. His brow creases  in confusion. He clicks the refresh button and the message appears again. He clicks four more times. The message remains on the page. Dean grows frustrated. He slams the laptop shut and stands.
Dean’s eyes flick back and forth between the demon’s, searching for a hint of deceit. “The fuck does that mean?”
The driver’s door closes with a loud groan. This time Dean pays it no mind. He is too preoccupied, thinking of the address in his hand. Dean sits in his cold car for several moments, weighing whether he should investigate the house, go get Sam, or see what Riley is talking about.
Dean sighs, and face palms. He's too exhausted to whip up a recap at the moment. Jody quickly runs down a summary of the situation at hand - Castiel being in the Empty, Jack being the new God, and the brothers working to save Castiel.
“Oh yes, Castiel. Castiel, the angel who defied Heaven and lost everything. The angel so love-sick with humanity he couldn't be a good soldier anymore. The angel so
“Eileen told me your stupid, dumbass plan. Get some sketchy witch to do the dirty work? We don’t trust witches!”
"I'll call some hunters and give them a heads up on what to look out for when they go there. It'll be taken care of," Sam reassures.
“I don’t know. I only know what I heard.” The demon walks away from Dean and turns back, facing him. “Listen, if you don’t want to make a deal I am just wasting my time. There are other losers out there desperate and willing to sell me their soul. It's kinda my job, so…" Dean is silent, staring at a large rock in the gravel. It’s much larger than the others, out of place really.
Forks scrape against glass plates in silence. Alex glances between everyone before her, feeling the tension, unaware of the situation. Kaia places her hand on Claire's thigh, silently asking if she's alright through concerned eyes. Claire doesn't respond in any form and doesn't need to. Kaia already knows the answer. Tearing a piece of garlic bread off, Alex asks, "How was the hunt?"
“Not necessarily a sale. I consider it more of a transaction.” Lucian watches as Dean steps away from him slowly.
He grimaces at the bottle, squeezes the neck so hard his knuckles blanche, and throws it across the room, into the kitchen. It lands by the island, shattering to pieces, with a deafening crash. Dean feels his eyes burning and hot tears gathering at the corners. Before he realizes, Dean is grabbing all the glass bottles and throwing them into the kitchen. In his fit of rage, Dean throws one bottle too high and it shatters against the side of the kitchen table. Glass spreads across the floor. He doesn't even register the intensity of the mess until one bottle knocks off another, shattering it at his feet. He stops throwing the bottles, breaking from his trance.
Lucian straightens his posture. "I told you. I offer one in a lifetime experience. That was it. Conjuring isn't some abracadabra spell."
The bartender leans across the counter, and points to her name tag. “My name is Riley, not sweetheart. And that is our strongest whiskey. We can try a different liquor? I have vodka.” She offers, holding up the bottle.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut, and a lone, hot tear threatens to fall. He wipes a hand down his face, and sniffs.
Dean grazes his hand over a small lump in his pants pocket and retrieves the small jar. The lid is glass and closed shut with a latch. Dean slightly shakes the liquid and it glows.
“Right now, she's unconscious and unaware of what's happening. As long as Dean works quickly, she'll be fine," Jack replies.
Apprehension flows through her veins thick and heavy. She glances down and motions to speak but uncertainty dries the words in her throat and she struggles to meet Dean's eyes.
Dean weighs the option before slamming on the brakes and makes a dangerous U-turn. He parks to the side and buries a small metal box with his picture along with other trinkets inside. Dean barely slides a layer of gravel over the box when he feels a presence.
Dean closes his bedroom door quickly, and shuts his eyes. His heart is pounding. This is it. For weeks, he’s searched and searched for an answer to bring Castiel back. With every dead end, he felt something latch onto his ankle, pulling him further under the surface. Now, the grip has loosened and he’s above water. Exhaling, Dean’s shoulders relax and a large amount of stress rolls off of him.
. After a few tries, Dean successfully retrieves the bottle and downs the remaining third of the whiskey. His head feels heavy and his chest feels hot. Dean can feel his fingers tingling and toes numbing against his socks. This is the sweet spot of feeling drunk, he thinks.
Nodding, Dean makes his way to the portal and carefully steps through. Swirling darkness engulfs him as the passage to the Empty processes his entrance. His head continues to spin from the spell and confusion overcomes him as unfamiliar images of Castiel begin to form in his consciousness. Castiel standing before him crying and saying something. Then, clear as a bell, "I love you," and the memory of the confession comes rushing back.
She straightens her posture and stops rubbing Claire's back. "A few months back Claire and I went on this hunt in Wyoming. Nothing we couldn't handle, at least we thought."
“You’re right about one thing, Dean, you’re not leaving.” The Shadow backhands Dean, flinging him a few feet away. Upon impact, the compass rolls out of Dean’s jacket pocket and lands near Castiel. The Shadow stalks forward, ramming a fist into Castiel, rendering him to the ground, before advancing to Dean. The compass lays inches within the angel’s reach. Castiel squints his eyes with curiosity. He recognizes the language on the compass, and even the artifact itself. Pushing down on the diamond, and twisting, Castiel ejects the piece from the disk, revealing a razor sharp pointed end. Looking up, Castiel sees Dean struggle under the Shadow. Pushing through shaky legs accompanied by a dull ache, the angel gets to his feet.
Dean grabs a hand towel and wraps it around his left hand before returning to the broom. The kitchen is just about clean. Within about 5 minutes, all the glass and spilled whiskey is gone. Almost as if it never happened. Dean places the broom and dustpan back in the corner and trudges through the hallways.
"No, I do. I want to. I never get the chance to tell you how I feel. I've always been too damn scared, or I don't know. But I'm ready now. I shouldn't have let you go like that, Cas. I-"
Dean's gaze falls to the floor. He's quiet for a moment, processing this information. "You live a happy life?" He barely says.
Dean’s phone vibrates against his leg. The music drowns out his ring tone. The caller ID reads “Sam” again. He declines the call. A part of him feels bad, dodging Sam like this but he wants to be alone right now. This whiskey is warm and numbing but his mind is clear. The fuzziness has not consumed him yet. He needs something stronger. He can continue drinking whiskey, but he needs at least a full bottle.
"This is my voicemail. Make your voice...a mail." A tear falls down Dean's cheek. He needs to hear Castiel's real voice. He needs to see him again. Touch him.
“Yea.” Dean pours another glass of whiskey. “I can see the resemblance now.” He turns to Jody with a half smirk.
Castiel scoffs. Dean grabs his cheeks and stares intensely. “Listen, I’m not leaving without you. I’ll carry you over my damn shoulder if I have to. We’ve fought our way through worse. Right? I’m not going to let some slimy pile of shit stop us.” Dean smiles, trying to reach Castiel.
Sam awakens from his nightmare, disoriented. The visions of seeing himself grow old, having a family and dying feel all too real. The beginning of his nightmare is fading and somewhat fuzzy but he remembers Dean making an appearance. He remembers seeing himself fight alongside his brother, killing some vampires, a normal hunt. Then his memory clears and the image of his brother impaled against a wooden pole catches his breath.
“Hey!” Castiel yells, turning the Shadow toward him, piercing the diamond into its chest, disrupting it.
"I'm not- it's nothing. I just needed a drink. A break from research, but I'm on my way home." Sam huffs, tells his brother to be careful and they hang up.
i really enjoyed the end result of this chapter, but it was a bitch getting it all together lol I have a feeling everyone will be happy by the end of it :)
“Yea. They had this long ass meeting. Some demons are saying they came to an ‘understanding.’” The demon emphasizes with air quotes. He smooths out his jacket again and eyes Dean.
“The last time we tried to extract angel grace from a human it almost killed them. I’m not going to put you through that.”
Dean lays his head on the table from exhaustion, but doesn't shut his eyes. He won't risk falling asleep. Instead, he focuses on counting the books on each shelf to his right. Then, once he's done with those he counts the ones on his left. Dean notices some of these books, he nor Sam even use. He doesn't know half of the content in these books. Unfortunately, Dean underestimated how counting can cause drowsiness no matter the subject at play. His eyes begin to drift when Sam walks in with loud footsteps.
He wipes a hand across his face, trying to erase the images of Dean saying goodbye, of Dean's hand dropping as he took his last breath, and the image of lighting his own brother's pyre.
“Everything mystical or cosmic related. I know a great amount. It was my job at one point. Where did you even find it? Last I saw of that, Abraham was tossing it into a river. Not sure who gave it to him.”
“Uncharacter-” Dean turns to face Sam. “He thinks he’s been uncharacteristic.” Facing Jack, he yells, “You’ve been a complete dickwad! You left us! We were family! We don’t leave family behind. I thought we taught you that.”
The connection with Castiel's grace overpowered the warlock's spell. Relief fills Dean as the coin begins to spin uncontrollably. Taking a few steps forward, the high-pitched echoes shoot through his ears and he doubles over in pain.
Dean's head is still somewhat fuzzy and heavy. His ears are no longer ringing and his vision is back to normal.
“I hope so.” Sam grabs the syringe and starts to twist off the needle but stops. He looks up in shock.
Sam shakes his hand to free the whip cream, watching Dean rake the remainder of the pie off his chin with his fork. Suddenly, Sam's temples begin pulsing painfully and he has an immense sense of deja vu. His smile falters and he feels out of place. Almost, as if he's reliving this moment. It's similar to the feeling he had this morning.
Dean downs the remainder of his whiskey and orders another glass. “Damn, you’re pretty popular tonight with the ladies. Though, I can’t say I don’t blame them,” the bartender says.
Claire’s head falls loosely to her chest, with her eyes closed. Everyone remains still and on edge. The silence blankets the room, increasing Kaia’s anxiety. “Claire?” She remains unconscious, but still standing. After a calm moment, violent coughing erupts from Claire, followed by a pool of dark crimson.
"Yea, yea. I'm fine. I feel like I just got hit by a freight train. Like how my visions used to feel." He pauses. "I actually think I just had a vision." Sam looks at Dean with bewilderment and Dean returns the look.
“Hm. I don’t do drugs. Weed doesn’t count.” He pulls out his wallet and lays down a fifty dollar bill. Replacing the leather, he turns to Riley and salutes. “Thanks for the whiskey.”
Slowly, Sam regains his thoughts and tells Eileen he's okay. Dean rushes by Sam's side by this point after hearing the loud thud from his fall. Dean places his hand on Sam's shoulder, in concern.
Sam swallows past the dry lump caught in his throat. He glances at Dean, making sure he's still asleep. Dean briefly shifts, pulling the pillow closer. Sam relaxes and picks up one more crumpled up paper. This one appears fresh, as if Dean wrote it tonight.
It’s cool out despite the sun, and Dean shoves his hands into his pockets. It’s October, now, and there’s a faint chill that’s started to linger in the air — fall getting ready to dig its hooks in.
Dean’s world shatters for the fourth time in five minutes. Sam can speak, so he’s the one who asks the question. “Wait, so is… is Cas in there? With you?”
drinking in every tiny, imperfect, impossible-to-fabricate detail about him: the way his hair curls just behind his ears. The lines at the corners of his eyes. The shadow of stubble on his jaw. The faint little mole just above the arch of his right eyebrow.
His grip is tight, more than a little painful. Cas’ eyelids flutter involuntarily as Dean tugs his head back by the crown, pulling until his face is upturned like a flower towards the sun. Cas’ breath hitches, and Dean keeps staring down at him, mesmerized. Mesmerizing.
He’s resourceful, though. And recently-impaled or not, he’s still a hot piece of ass. It only takes a little bit of eyelash batting to get his nurse to find him some sleeping meds, and from there on out it’s smooth sailing. In addition to being stupidly effective at knocking him the fuck out, the pills also have the added benefit of not leaving him hungover the next morning. He’ll have to find out what brand they are, stay on ‘em once he’s home again. Jack Daniels doesn’t really work that well beyond actually getting him to sleep.
He stands there for a while, just staring out into the woods with his hands braced on the porch railing and his coffee slowly cooling beside him. He can’t really hear the road from here. It’s just him and the wind and the trees.
The ticking of the clock is the only response Dean gets for a long minute. Then Cas sighs. “You can be… difficult. But I— I forgive you. For last night.”
Sam just looks at him. Dean drinks again, looking at Sam in return. “You should go home. Shower, try and sleep. Eat something.” Then he frowns. “Wait, did someone pick Miracle up from the daycare? You didn’t forget my dog, did you?”
the mistakes nipping at their heels momentarily distant and the task ahead of them looming like a thunderhead, dark and weighty on the horizon.
The barista shakes her head, a couple of the few dark curls escaping from her bun bouncing cheerily as she waves him off. “No, go ahead. It’d just go right into the recycling, anyways.” She smiles, a small twinkle in her eye. “If you’re set on paying, though, you could just promise to come back. I work the morning shift, most days. My name’s Ashley.”
Cas tilts his head. “I don’t what?” Then he grins, and Dean elbows him in the arm, going from embarrassed tomato to angry tomato in roughly two seconds flat as he realizes Cas is fucking with him. Cas just smiles wider in satisfaction and awkwardly accepts Sam’s fist-bump. Dean tosses his utensils onto his almost empty plate.
They just sit there for a while, talking about random things. What Charlie’s done since he last saw her, how Stevie is, the LARP event she’s got coming up in a couple weeks. It’s easy, being with her; she doesn’t delve into difficult things or look at him like he’s broken. She just treats him the same way she always has.
“Gay?” Dean finishes, only a little weakly. He tries for a grin. “Nah. If someone’s got a problem with it, that’s on them. Not my fault they can’t wrap their tiny brains around it.”
He goes back to his dessert, but he’s quieter now, and he knows Cas is picking up on it. A tiny line appears between his brows, and Dean wants to reach over and press his thumb to it until it smoothes itself out again. Or maybe his lips. Yeah, lips might work better. He’d slide a hand around to cradle Cas’ skull, fingers threaded into his hair, and Cas would let out a shaky breath as his eyelids fluttered shut, the warm air fanning softly over Dean’s collarbones.
He wasn’t even sure he’d be able to find any in Lebanon; this town ain’t exactly a bubbling cesspool of sin. But after only half an hour of bumming around the slightly seedier side of the tracks, he struck up a conversation with a guy named Joe (almost as bad as ‘Doug’, in terms of dealer names, but beggars can’t be choosers) and paid what seemed like a ridiculous amount of money for two grams of the good stuff. And, after the realization that he had no supplies whatsoever, some rolling papers and filters too.
“Even though he’s a dude, I’m starting to think I’d let him,” Charlie laughs, and reaches over to give Miracle a belly rub. Somehow, his tail wags even faster, and Dean almost chuckles at it.
They’re fine, they’re not fighting or anything: Cas forgave Dean for kicking him out a long time ago, and by this point Dean’s even starting to forgive himself. He’s a good roommate, and both Sam and Dean like having him around. He’s family.
He doesn’t remember getting out of bed; one moment he’s there, the sheets pooled around his waist, and the next he’s at the door, yanking it open with his back practically
Sam’s refilling his glass when he finally asks the next question. “This isn’t anything like last time. Why?”
He thought he had Sam convinced, if not that he was a-okay then at least that he was somewhat decent.
And god, Dean doesn’t… he can’t hold back the sad, hopeless little laugh that trickles from his lips. “For
Dean does his best to relax during dinner. They’re supposed to be playing the perfect couple, and Cas is right; looking like he’s about to murder someone the whole time they’re sitting out here in the open won’t do them any favours. So he keeps his eyes on Cas and doesn’t let himself slip.
Or maybe this isn’t that at all. Maybe Castiel is kneeling here and offering up his obedience, his supplication, to a false god. A pagan altar. Maybe he’s blinded by his— his affection for the Winchesters. For Dean.
So he answers honestly, tonelessly. “Where’s it leave us? Screwed. I’m sure Chuck’s ready to make a move.”
The others are staring at him. Dean looks back down at Cas’ face, at his closed eyes. At the way his head rests against Dean’s shoulder.
“Dean.” Dean looks up to find Cas standing in the door of the bedroom, his bag at his feet. He raises an eyebrow. “I’m ready to go.”
He clears his throat, looking determinedly at the road now. “Hey, uh, you never told me. What did that blessing mean that got you so flustered?”
But Sam’s a bitch, edging dangerously close to ‘motherfucker’ territory at this point, and Dean just keeps gathering more and more evidence of that the longer this fucking staycation drags on. “Got any suggestions?” he asks neutrally. ”I mean, we could go back to that meadow. The one with the brook and the windmill?” He keeps talking like every word isn’t another twist of the knife. “It seemed like he liked that. It was a nice place.”
to. Crowley is waiting for him; they have work to do. He can’t afford to stay here and try to explain his way out of this. He can’t— he can’t keep playing both sides.
It feels like reverse heartburn and vomiting all at the same time, a continual gag reflex for the whole time it takes to do it, and the plastic tube
He stalls for a second in front of the door, hoping against hope that this isn’t just another one of Chuck’s sick jokes. But the doubt is already being swamped by a warm, buoyant feeling rising in his chest like helium; he pulls the door open, and—
“And Cas,” he says, turning to him with a rueful kind of smile. “What was the first thing you said to me when we met?”
“Yes I do. You passed out in the TV room last Friday night and you were miserable all day Saturday because of it. And that was neither the first nor the only time that has happened.”
“You really think this’ll be enough?” Dean asks, scanning the restaurant. Some guy shoots them a dirty look, and Dean glares back at him until his eyes drift away.
“I’m,” Dean starts, shying away from the implications of that. He swallows and tries again. “You hungry?”
Dean lets out a slightly delirious laugh. “Okay, first of all, you could ask me whatever the hell you wanted right now and my answer would be ‘fuck yes’. So, fuck yes. But you must be crazy if you think shotgunning is the only time I’m gonna put my mouth on you from now on.”
“You’re an idiot.” And before Cas can do anything more than open his mouth to retaliate, Dean steps forward and kisses him.
He doesn’t, because he’s a wimp. But c’mon, you realize you’re in capital “L” love with your best friend and it’s
Dean almost recoils, he’s so surprised. Castiel looks up at him, hands facing out, palms open as he sits back on his heels. “I’m lost,” he says plainly. “I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m
Without another word he does as Dean says. Silently, Dean waits for him to reach the steps and then follows him up the stairs. He scrubs his sleeve across his face while he does.
“So,” Sam starts quietly, “where does this leave us? We need that book open, and we’re out of options.” He’s trying to keep it together, but Dean can hear the faint, pleading note in his voice. He’s looking to Dean for answers, answers Dean doesn’t have. Answers Dean never has.
He’s going to worry anyways— that’s kind of his thing. He doesn’t bother saying that out loud, though. He just puts his forehead down on Cas’ shoulder, turning further in towards him and hesitantly resting a hand on his leg. “I don’t know how long it’ll take,” he says to Cas’ grey t-shirt. “But I’m gonna try. I’m trying.”
As he walks into the library, Dean wonders idly if he’s got half a chance of convincing Cas to watch Tombstone again.
Dean flicks his straw, watching it flop drunkenly around the inside of the cup. “I don’t know what you want me to say, man. I’m
Dean doesn’t know if Jack even hears the yes he screams. The wind seems to snatch it right out of his mouth.
April 20th. But that shit’s funny, okay? Don’t judge.) He hasn’t smoked anything since… shit, the last time he can remember must’ve been… before the first apocalypse? Yeah, he thinks… yeah.
Dean’s face is wet when he bolts upright in the dark, his blankets tangled under him in hot, sweaty snarls. He hunches forward, one hand shoved against his mouth to muffle the helpless little sobs and whimpers trickling out of his throat. His shoulders shake. God, that— fuck, it’s
Because he knows better than anyone that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, doesn’t he?
I have no idea how many times Sam called before I picked up the phone! And it’s a good thing everyone else had poofed away, because when I finally got on the road I would’ve
There are a few things that pop unhelpfully into Dean’s head. He could ask her to bring a six pack or a bottle of whiskey, because Sam hasn’t bought them a drop of alcohol since they’ve been at this godforsaken cabin. Or he could ask her to get him a refill of those sleeping meds; she’d definitely be able to do it, even without a prescription.
“No, Sam, I’m not okay. Happy now? I’m not. I’m fucked up, I’ve been fucked up this whole time, and now I want a goddamn drink.”
Dean takes a drink. “Yeah, I guess. It sucks. I don’t know why, though, so don’t use up a question asking me that.”
a smug little Sam-voice corrects him in his head — he wanders back out into the main area to find Cas already set up at the desk with his laptop, his messenger bag hooked over the back of the chair. Dean stands in the doorway to the bedroom, his eyes catching on the way Cas’ dark blue pullover hugs his arms. Then he swallows and walks over, putting a hand on the back of the chair and looking over Cas’ shoulder at the screen.
So this is what he’s been planning. This is the big “help Dean cope” effort Sam’s been cooking up in that massive, stupid brain of his.
This thing kind of took me by the throat for a little while, and I'm honestly thinking that it's going to be my longest fic yet, the way it's going. Most of the chapters I've written so far are pretty chonky, so you've got lots to look forward to there. Is it ridiculous that I'm writing yet another season fifteen fix-it? Yes. Am I going to do it anyways? Also yes.
Dean's eyes widen in terror. "No!" He remembers when he did lose all of his memories. He felt terrified and alone. He doesn't want to feel that way again.
“Coming right up,” she taps the counter and winks at Dean. He knows she is just flirting for a nice tip, but the gesture seems nice. After a few moments, the bartender comes around with a short glass full of dark, honey like colored liquid and slides it in front of Dean.
Dean's head feels like he went ten rounds in the ring and lost. His ears are ringing. "What did you do to me?"
His words baffle Dean. “Don’t do that. Don’t apologize. It wasn’t what was said, Cas. It was the timing. You left and my idiot brain had no time to fully process what the hell was happening. But I finally did weeks later, and you weren’t here. And it hurt too damn much.”
“What’s the difference?” Dean asks, eyeing the necromancy book as Lucian flips it over and over. His throat feels dry. His palms are tingling and it’s not alcohol this time.
Holding her wine glass with both hands, Alex stares at the middle of the table - overwhelmed. "If angels are from Heaven, wouldn't they just go to another Heavenly realm in death? Why would they go to a hellish dimension when they die? They're supposed to be good. Doesn’t make sense." Tears almost form in her eyes as she wonders how the hell could she make it to Heaven if an angel can't.
Sam joins Dean at the table and a long beat passes between them. Sounds in the kitchen of water running, the clinking of plates, and banging of pans fill the silence instead. Dean repositions himself in the chair, still not making eye contact with Sam. Sam, however, is studying Dean. He appears disheveled, bags under his eyes, day old stubble and crust around his lips from dried whiskey. He's a wreck.
Eileen blushes and laughs at Dean. "I don't kiss and tell," she winks at Sam as she kisses him on the cheek. "Who wants breakfast?"
Castiel and Dean watch the Shadow gasp for air as its original dark form materializes and slowly crystallizes, freezing it in place. The two share a look before Dean steps forward and lightly pushes the frozen statue. Slowly, it falls to the ground into pieces. Dean huffs in surprise and glances at Castiel, both smiling. The two, finally alone and reunited after everything, share a look before wrapping their arms around one another. Dean squeezes his eyes shut, pulling the angel as close as possible. Castiel, eyes blissful, clenches onto Dean’s jacket. They stay close like that for a long moment, neither one wanting to let go. Then, sudden vibrations erupt throughout the Empty, throwing the pair off balance.
“You can’t win this, Dean,” the Shadow laughs. “I’m an undead cosmic being, and you’re a pathetic human.”
Dean smiles, knowing that this case will help keep his mind busy. And he will be able to save someone. At least this way he will feel like his life was worth saving.
On the bed, Kaia and Claire sit closely, whispering. Kaia has her hand on Claire's knee, wishing to take her place and protect her from this. Dean walks up to them, feeling as if he's interrupting a private moment.
She slides his second glass of whiskey across the counter and eyes him. He has dark circles under his eyes, a pretty thick five o’clock shadow, and he's staring at his left hand. “So, why are you here by yourself? Where’s your lucky lady?” She inquires.
Dean rolls over as the aroma of burnt bacon fills his room. He rubs the sleep from his eyes as he sits up. Realizing that Sam is about to burn the bunker down, he slips on his robe and jogs to the kitchen.
Dean slowly sits up, removing his feet from the table. He swallows, and glances around the room. Eileen and Sam are giggling quietly. She shoves his arm in response to Sam’s remark. Dean pulls the laptop closer to him, and continues to read.
“Stop! Okay, just stop. I’m tired of your games. I know this isn’t real,” he sits up, with exhaustion written on his face.
Dean smiles, that tired, sad smile. "No, Sammy. You and I both know as long as I'm alive you will always be in this life." He looks at Eileen. "You two will never have a chance at a happy, normal life with me around. Besides, hunting is what I do. There is nothing else for me. Not anymore.”
"I see. With your friend on another plane of existence, meaning not on Earth, it makes things more difficult. My hallucination spell can possibly break the boundaries, but it may be painful." Lucian looks up and down Dean. "But I'm sure you could handle it. The tea won't allow you to converse with him. You'll only see him. I can also throw together a spell. I will need a few objects from you, though." Dean squints at the warlock.
He begins to walk toward the staircase when the closed wooden doors open. A couple, man and woman, hold onto one another as they exit the front door. Dean turns to face the room and his gaze falls upon a dark headed man with classy fashion. His attire runs similar to something Crowley would wear, Dean thinks. The only difference is his hair falls short of his shoulders.
Dean opens his eyes and the warlock's office comes into focus as his head spins. He's lying on his back, staring at the ceiling. Lucian is bending over to his right. Dean scrambles up to the best of his ability. Holding himself up with the wall.
Dean shuffles down the staircase of the bunker, and is met with a warm welcome from Miracle. He grins as he barks in greeting and jumps up, twirling around with excitement. “Okay, boy,” he coos, trying to calm down Miracle. “When was the last time someone gave you any attention?” He kneels down and rubs both sides of the dog’s face. Dean looks around, scanning the library. It’s vacant aside for the books piled on the tables and thrown haphazardly on the floor. “Sam? Eileen?” Miracle whines, and Dean ruffles the top of his head before standing.
The glow turns into an eye-aching supernova, and Jack spreads his arms, looking up to the sky. He’s speaking; not words, but pure
He fights, and he fights hard, but there’s no stopping it. The lead weights dragging his eyelids shut and the stones piling up inside his limbs — they’re a slow, inexorable creep he can’t hope to escape. He lost this fight the second that pill tumbled out of his hand earlier today.
Royally fucked up in more ways than one, decidedly ambivalent about whether or not he continues to exist in this world he fought so hard to save. There’s a price, there’s always a price; and if you weigh the alternative against the billions of people that are out there today, getting to live lives that are fully their own, then Dean guesses that a single guy’s happiness is a small one to pay. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one.
and letting Dean say his piece, Sam’s checking to make sure there’s no exit wound at Dean’s front and talking a mile a minute to the 911 dispatcher. Hence,
The silver four door has long since disappeared down the lane towards the road, but Dean’s still just… standing here. There’s so
Sam is still gawking at the kiss as Dean stumbles away, leaning heavily against the wrought iron railing and whipping his gun out of his waistband to point, trembling, at
Wow, milestone - I’ve hit 50 subscribers! Thanks to all of you who’ve hit the button, it means a lot to me 😁
Dean lets out a harsh laugh and stands, turning to face Sam. “Well, that’s a one-eighty from earlier. Did your conscience finally kick in?”
He stops mid-reach, waylaid by his coffee cup. He stares at it, at the slim, shiny handle of a spoon resting jauntily against the edge. The sugar bowl is suspiciously close at hand.
Cas’ voice rumbles out from the speaker, and Dean looks over at Sam, his heart leaping into his throat. The voice is exhausted, but it’s
“Fuck!” Dean shouts as he scrambles upright, Cas doing the same next to him. A tiny old woman with steel grey hair pulled back into a bun stands in the doorway to their bedroom, smoothing down the front of her cleaning lady’s uniform with nervous hands.
that was, though; all he was willing to admit to himself was that staying in, making some good food, and then maybe hanging out on the couch with Cas watching a movie sounded
Dean points a shaking finger at him, guilt crawling up his throat like bile. “Say you understand me. Or I could go on, if that wasn’t clear enough for you.”
Dean just shakes his head. Charlie had said she’d be by for a bit, and there’s the matter of the single remaining sleeping pill to be decided. Other than that, no. Obviously not.
They’re halfway through a race when the rumble of the Impala announces Sam’s return, and Dean loses his focus completely as his eyes snap towards the door. The game makes an annoyed beep at him and he starts, cutting a guilty glance at Charlie, but she just smiles and takes his controller. “Go on,” she says, the almost angry glint in her eyes at odds with her pleasant expression. “I’ll fend him off.”
The bleariness of sleep clears from his face all too quickly when he meets Dean’s gaze and realizes where his limbs have migrated during the night. Dean’s eyes drop helplessly to the bob of his throat when he swallows. “Uh,” he says, his voice sleep-rough in a way that makes Dean’s heart lurch in his chest. “Good morning.”
Dean gets a flat, sour glare directed his way for a response. “She wished strength and virility on us both for many years to come, that we might fulfill each other’s needs and have a happy marriage bed.”
Dean averts his eyes from Cas’ face for good measure, under the guise of scanning the restaurant again. It’s just something he does, an instinct at this point, and it’s one that Cas shares. They’re both soldiers, in a way. It’s why they’re sitting in the back corner and neither of them have their backs to the room.
That is, until Dean stands up, shoves the bottle into his pocket, and opens the door with what is probably more force than necessary before stalking down the hallway to the bathroom.
Cas’ mouth quirks into a mischievous smile. “I’m glad it wasn’t him. The food here would probably make him gassy.”
“Not anymore,” Cas says, a grin audible in his voice. Dean dissolves into giggles and sags against him, running his hands over Cas’ shoulders. Cas hums. “I like shotgunning.”
“I trusted you,” Dean whispers, his anger pulling down into a tight, hard ball. “I backed you. I stood up for you to Sam and Bobby even when they were starting to make sense. Because it’s
Sam shakes his head. “Uh, I guess that carbonara you made a couple weeks ago was good. What about that?”
He’s got a less intense version of that shell-shocked look from the end of last night plastered across his face, and Dean’s stomach drops right past rock bottom to some new subterranean low.
Dean’ll get back to playing his part eventually, and when he does, Sam’s just gonna have to deal. It’s worked for the past six months, and it’ll work again.
Dean drives in silence for a minute, willing the warmth in his cheeks to go down. Then he shrugs. “I mean. Nice of her.”
feels like that too, all the way from the backs of his teeth down to the soles of his feet. He feels
Cas sways dangerously, trying and failing to clear his mind, to settle himself. “So what?” he calls plaintively after Dean’s swiftly retreating form. Bereft, adrift. “You’re just— you’re just going to leave me here?”
It’s surprisingly good, though. And it turns out that shoving a spoonful of it into his mouth is a great way to prevent any ill-timed confessions from slipping out.
He sets the glasses down as he sits in the sagging armchair across from Dean, cracking the bottle open and pouring a measure into each one. Dean picks his up and waits for Sam to set the bottle aside before clinking their glasses together. He grins and it’s flinty, bladelike. “I don’t know about you, but this is gonna be a shot for me. No questions until I’m on my third one, got it?”
“It’s not,” Cas says. It’s still more gentle than Dean deserves, for all it’s bluntness. And it also stings, a little, because Dean is fucked up like that. “I’ve been a paradox for far too long. I needed to make a choice, and I can’t go back to Heaven— that hasn’t been an option for years. Earth has been more welcoming, historically.”
Jack’s eyelids droop, and he looks exhausted, but he seems… peaceful. He smiles, a little drunkenly, and sighs. “Balance,” he mumbles happily, and Dean doesn’t know what the fuck that’s supposed to mean. But he doesn’t care. Jack looks up at them, his expression still glazed and dopey. “Sam. Dean.”
He might regret this tomorrow, but for now he’s just feeling nice and floaty. So he gives Cas a small smile, tinged with only the slightest hint of wariness, and he picks the joint back up. “Well, if you’re sure, I’ll show you how.”
“Yeah, forgive us if we don’t exactly take that at face value,” Sam replies scathingly. “You’re a little short on trust right now, man.”
“Just… dealing. Life in general. You had some days there where you were pretty okay. Hell, the day of the vamp hunt itself wasn’t bad. But that’s… they’re gone now.”
“Right,” Dean says, swallowing down the disappointment that sweeps through him. Of course. It’s— it’s for the case. That’s all. “Yeah, definitely. Good idea.”
“Oh. Of course,” Cas says. Dean isn’t looking at him, but he can hear the slight embarrassment colouring his voice as his hand slips out of Dean’s.
“Well,” Lucifer drawls with a razor-sharp smile, “I was thinking. If you’ve got some unfinished business with
He thinks it must say something about Ashley that he doesn’t even remember why he wanted the paper so bad until he’s halfway back to the Bunker. But even getting flirted with can’t distract him from the solution to his years of not-actually-third-wheeling for long.
The third one, his nice one, goes into his nightstand with the leftover weed and the rolling papers; a little something for that next time Sam mentioned. The other one goes into his pocket with his Zippo, and then he shrugs on his coat. All set.
“Hey, you assholes, I’m—” Sam tries to protest over Dean’s surprised laughter. “You’re unbelievable, Dean. You’re not stupid, but you are
He stares down at Jack, drawing a complete blank. But then, apropos of nothing, Jack’s expression clears in understanding.
He stumbles to his feet, ignoring the protest of his back, and does the bare minimum to keep it down as he gets out into the main room. Where the hell is the whiskey? Sam’s probably squirrelled it away somewhere, that sanctimonious asshole. Whatever. Dean knows him, he should be able to find it without too much trouble.
He just has to go sit in the kitchen and call Sam, let him know what’s up. Then… maybe he can drink. Or go sit outside or something.
Castiel has been looking for a sign, for something to guide him. He’s been praying to his Father: countless questions that have all, so far, gone unanswered.
The couch squeaks, like Charlie’s just gotten up, and she drops her voice to a whisper. It’s probably an attempt to make certain Dean doesn’t hear. It might’ve worked, too, if Dean wasn’t so paranoid and self-destructive. “C’mon, I wasn’t born yesterday. What are you trying to do, here? It’s not helping.”
The room is silent as the grave. Cas doesn’t blink, still staring at Dean. “Yes,” he whispers hoarsely. “I… I understand.”
Sam shakes his head a little, a grin creeping back onto his face. “Nah, I don’t think so. Not this time. Thanks for the offer, though? I guess?”
“No,” Dean cuts him off, his voice bristling with sharp, jagged edges. His jaw tenses. “I sat here, I let you bribe me with whiskey, and I did what you wanted,” he bites out, low and raw. “You know the whole sob story. So now I’d really appreciate it if you showed a little goddamn sympathy and
“It’s more of the same, Cas. Some people think that sorta thing’s romantic, y’know? Tell someone you love ‘em with a big confession in the paper, leave a message for your partner. You gotta remember, Dean’s just a bitter asshole about Valentine’s Day in general.”
Still, there’s something missing, and Sam frowns a little as he thinks back to the slightly more in-depth explanation he’d wrung out of Dean in that brief window between Jack’s departure and Dean locking himself in his room. “But… what was his true happiness? You said that was the condition of the deal. So what was it?”
happened before. He always fucks it up, or something he can’t control fucks it up, or there’s a huge “but” waiting in the wings to kick his ass when he least expects it. But nothing happened, and as far as he can tell, nothing’s
The three hour drive back to Lebanon passes in near silence, but Dean starts to feel himself relax a little as they get closer to the turn off for the Bunker. It’ll be nice to be home. Just a little bit longer, now, and then—
Every single medical professional he sees tells him how incredibly lucky he is. That somehow his spine didn’t get in the way, that his internal injuries weren’t too bad, that he’s improving so well. He doesn’t lash out at the kid again; he’d felt… bad, after that first time back in the hospital. But he didn’t take back what he said, either.
His gaze slides to the pill bottle sitting next to it and he grimaces. He could’ve tried a little harder, he thinks. To get a refill. He probably could’ve… he could’ve done something. Offered to get the medical stuff and sent Sam off to grab them coffee. Sucked it up and weathered Charlie’s displeasure and pity. Something.
rolling out from him in impossible waves. Dean holds onto Sam, squinting, crying, feeling like he’s coming apart at the atoms, and—
Dean and Cas stand there for a long time, longer than Sam’s ever seen them hug. The place where Dean usually steps away and claps Cas on the shoulder, or cracks some stupid joke, or rolls his eyes and acts embarrassed, it just… passes. Dean doesn’t move, doesn’t loosen his grip in the slightest. If anything, it looks like he holds on tighter.
He still can’t help but feel a sloppy flush of relief whenever he sees Lucifer. Can’t help but stare. Even though it’s not
He doesn’t do that. “Then don’t,” he whispers instead. It still feels like a confession. Of what, Dean isn’t sure.
than enough, even if he doesn’t see it that way. Everyone else does, though, and it’s high time he gets his head out of his ass enough to see that they’re right.
gonna have to deal with it, so that sucks for you, I guess, but I’m not letting you brush this one off. You fucked off before you could deal with it once already, but too bad. You’re back now and you’ve gotta clean up your mess.” He scowls, his heart giving a painful throb. “Hell, I bet some part of you was
The stealth part of their plan went off without a hitch, at least. Michael isn’t paying attention, but Dean saw the way Jack stiffened every time one of the heavy hitters threw a fireball. He was sucking up their power. Maybe… maybe this will work.
Dean crosses to the living room. Sam wouldn’t have been dumb enough to shove it under the couch cushions, would he? “You can’t. So stop trying.” He pauses, looking at Sam again. “Actually, you can leave me the hell alone, if you’re capable of that.”
“Get out of my face, bitch,” Dean mutters in reply, making a beeline for the coffee pot. He drags two mugs down from the cupboard, filling them both with coffee, and then adds a little sugar to his and a splash of cream to the other.
He’s hyper-aware of every sound that comes from the direction of Sam’s room as he stands at the counter mixing up pancake batter. He slops some flour over the side of the bowl when he hears footsteps, forcing himself not to turn and look when there’s a slight pause before they retreat down the hall towards the bathroom. He almost drops the package of bacon when he hears the door open back up again. He nearly botches a flip when one of the chairs scrapes against the floor.
Magda either doesn’t notice his sarcasm or doesn’t care, because she bustles closer and reaches up to rest a palm on each of their foreheads. She says a short phrase in that language of hers, then steps back and smiles. “There. Eet is done.”
Cas shifts, then, his hand sliding over Dean’s chest to rest right over his sternum, and abruptly Dean goes from barely breathing to not breathing at all. Cas lets out a small, snuffling hum, and opens his eyes.
Now it’s Dean’s turn to go still. He can’t see much of Cas; it’s properly dark now, so he can’t see his expression. “Yeah?” he rasps.
And lmao I’ve already gone off schedule. I knew this was gonna happen, but whatever. Them’s the breaks, right? Don’t worry, I fully intend to finish this story, it just might get a lil choppy from here on out. Love you guys, and thanks so much for the support <3
wine, and how can Dean argue with that when wine-drunk Cas is so soft and affectionate and rosy-cheeked? He’s weak; Cas is more likely to sling an unselfconscious arm around his shoulders when he’s like this, to lean into Dean’s side and look at him even more than he usually does. So you can bet that Dean’s never gonna say a goddamned word about it.) He does that very thing as they walk out of the restaurant, actually, except it’s an arm around Dean’s waist instead of his shoulders and he’s—
cautious in his approach. But Cas does nothing more than continue to stare up at him, pleading— hoping. Praying. Dean has always known what the right thing is.
Sam goes out that afternoon to run some undisclosed errands, so Dean gets something of a respite. Charlie, blessedly, pretends she didn’t pick up on the tension between them and drags Dean into a MarioKart tournament, Miracle curled up on the couch beside them. Dean loses more than he wins; he’s off his game even more than usual today. Charlie does manage to draw a couple little huffs of laughter out of him, though. Her victory shimmies are just…
Then his walls slam down, and he squares off to Cas like he’s getting ready for a fight. “Then I’ll do what I have to,” he growls.
And Dean knows what Cas is talking about. The question has been tugging at him ever since he realized Cas was sleeping, since he watched him put away, like, six pancakes. That’s not normal for Cas. That means something bad.
Dean stares down at his and Cas’ joined hands where they rest on his thigh, feeling like he’s stepped into the fucking Twilight Zone.
“Then let it go!” Dean shouts, grabbing Sam’s arm. The wind has whipped up to gale-force levels, and Dean’s seriously starting to get worried that he and Sam’ll just… blow away. “Don’t give up your life for the world, kid! It’s not worth it!”
Cas looks over at him, and their faces are way too close for Dean to be able to breathe properly. He can see every smile line at the corners of Cas’ eyes. “It’s a public area. It’s a good place to be seen, if you’re amenable to it.”
Dean swallows, then drops his hand. “You can use Sam’s room if you want,” he finishes in a clipped, utilitarian tone. “Or there’s books on the shelf. I’m gonna try and sleep.”
“Is there a point to you,” Dean grits out, his hands clenched into fists, “or are you just annoying me for no reason?”
Dean chokes, nearly spewing his mouthful of pancake all over the table. Sam stifles a laugh, because the careful innocence in Cas’ face means he’s
The afternoons are long. Dean usually finds himself at loose ends halfway through, so… he fiddles. Sam gets so fed up with him trying to fix various things around the house and ‘overworking’ himself that he sits Dean down at the table and tells him to find a case. Do the research, then send the details off to
“Oh dear,” she says in a heavily accented voice, looking between the two of them in dismay. “You veren’t meant to vake up unteel eet vas done.”
Dean snorts. “Well, your references are still pretty shit, but at least you’ve got your backhanded compliments down pat.”
Sam puts his headphones on, keying up Netflix on his laptop, and settles back into his pillows as the intro music for the new episode of
Cas leans against the wall just outside the door, the corners of his eyes pinched with pain, his hands pressed to his stomach. He smiles.
He traces the expression on Cas’ face over and over, committing it to memory. He wonders if he looks anywhere near this peaceful when
Cas huffs a small laugh at that, and leans back against the metal box. “Look,” he says. “The stars are out.”
He has a revolving door of visitors. Everyone Sam said, plus Eileen, and Patience and Alex (who both wanted to come too, for some unfathomable reason). It doesn’t look like Sam’s shared his fears with any of them, at least: no one tearfully asks if he’s okay or if he’s feeling depressed. Well, Garth
Or, they almost trigger something. Dean’s so smothered in gauzy, cotton-wool haziness that the impulse fizzles out before it does anything more than catch his attention for a fleeting second, a tug in his gut that fades almost before he registers it.
A spark of defiance lights in his eyes and he straightens up, getting all up in Dean’s space. “Because I love you, Dean,” he hisses. “And I needed to say it to
who explodes one night after dinner. It’s been two and a half weeks since he got out of the hospital.
Michael sighs. “What I can help you do is kill my Father. Lucifer’s contribution will allow the book to be opened and read, and we can finish this. But Castiel’s fate is out of my hands.” Then he looks up again, and his gaze pins Dean to the spot. “Though you should know: if I have to fight Lucifer, I will kill him. I don’t care who he looks like, Dean. He will die.”
He keeps— the thing about the funeral is just the beginning. He keeps poking and prodding all day under the guise of innocent reminiscing, needling at Dean’s ongoing muteness with exasperated, badly hidden concern. Dean tries to ignore it, tries not to give Sam the satisfaction of knowing it’s cutting as deeply as it is; but he’s no paragon of temperance, and just after lunch, when Charlie’s in the bathroom, he snaps.
into all the crap swirling around inside his head. Sinks down into it and lets it yank him every which way, lets it pluck at his fraying seams and dig its claws in deep.
A little sheepishly, he drives through the intersection. Cas doesn’t laugh, but the amusement emanating from the passenger seat makes the tips of Dean’s ears feel warm.
Cas sits up, muzzy and wary, and Dean’s tunnel vision slowly expands to include the rest of the room.
He wants his dog, and his bed, and the jacket in the back of his closet with the bloody handprint on the shoulder. He wants his chores and his liquor and the cars to keep him busy.
He watches it sink, and he’d say his mood sinks with it, but it doesn’t have that far to go in the first place.
“Hell yeah he did,” Charlie says as she walks up, grinning. “You should see him on the way here. Getting to come drown you in slobber is the highlight of his week.”
“Oh.” The bag in front of Dean is only half-full of research and other random shit. He opens his mouth, but before he can say anything Cas is already at his side, picking up a pile of stray papers.
it. Somehow, she… well, she thinks she knows something. He resolves to ignore it and pretend everything’s fine.
“Something like that. I do offer other services as well.” Dean gives him a strange look. “Get your mind out of the gutter, Dean. I mean magic. I provide services other than the intoxication of magic.”
“Hey, Sam. I think we may have overlooked this whole angel grace thing.” Sam is quiet, allowing Dean to continue. “When Gadreel possessed you, he left some behind right?”
"I have this picture. I don't have any of his belongings though," he says slowly and extends his hand. His gaze never leaves the picture.
Dean's heart aches with anguish. Knowing the risk of the spell, realizing it's over, he wipes a hand across his mouth. “We’re not doing that."
She shushes him. “Yes, like drugs. Jesus, you don’t have to announce it. Cops come in here all the time.” Dean swallows the last of his whiskey.
Lucian nods. "So, you want to speak to him? Hm, that makes things more interesting. Is this friend of yours on the same existing plane?" Dean eyes him. "So not the veil. Heaven?" Dean doesn't answer. "Hell perhaps?" Dean glances to the side. Guilt rises in his throat.
Dean slowly sips down the blue liquid. His head becomes fuzzy, he starts seeing double, and suddenly he feels the warlock grab both sides of his head. All of Dean's senses disappear. He can't feel his body. He's floating. Like in his dream. The ribbon is carrying him again, except he's surrounded by darkness. And he doesn't feel warm. Everything is cold. Dean flutters his eyelids open and is alone. Castiel isn't here.
Please leave a comment to let me know what you think! I really appreciate everyone that has so far. Constructive criticism and ideas are welcomed as this supposed to be a play on the finale! Thanks for the love <3
Sam quietly crunches the papers back up and places them back where he found them. Dean doesn't move. As Sam switches the lamp off, he feels the heaviness of the dark engulf him.

"How can you be so sure? How can you be so positive that this is from Jack and he's trying to help us? Doesn't make a lot of sense that out of all the times I've asked for his help, to save Cas, or help me bring him back, he's now warning you of an ordinary hunt?" Dean says frustrated.
