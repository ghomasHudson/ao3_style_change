“Oh,” John said, “Oh no.” His eyes stung with the prickle of fresh tears at the thought of being replaced and forgotten.
, Bill had corrected him) that were cats and snakes and owls and rats, no students had reported their pets harmed. In fact, John often saw Toby the cat roaming freely through the halls, with his owner chasing after him (he hadn’t learned her name yet, so he thought of her as Toby’s girl). Sherlock showed no interest in other people’s pets (familiars), although John knew he visited the Owlery both days to sneak treats to Mycroft, which was a surreptitious but not evil act. Per these observations, John concluded that the small animal population of Hogwarts was safe, for the time being.
“No one’s bugged. Who’s bugged? Not me,” Sherlock shrugged. “I’m cool.”
“So, he was under the water. I understand you’re frightened, but he was only playing. You know how little boys are.”
“Of course I can count to
And underneath his hands and all around him and inside of him Sherlock’s skin and flesh was so cold, so cold, as if it was
Unpacking would take two weekends’ worth of work, at least. The sooner she got it done, the better. Hazel opened one of the boxes and lifted one of John’s little jumpers out.
“Well,” said Sherlock, “You
“He won’t see me,” Sherlock reassured him. “You’re the only one who’ll see me tonight.”
been mindful to choose a pair of casual slacks, however, now that he knew that was a point of judgment.
“I’m sorry,” says John.
“Second cousins,” Harry reminded him, “twice removed.”
He shifted down quickly, shoved John's legs open himself and forced his thighs to spread. Grabbed one cheek of his arse and squeezed it hard, round and firm in his hand, and held him open as he licked a hot, wet stripe up the crack of John's arse.
He watches John's face in the low light when he rubs against it, finally, the way his whole body arcs up as if trying to peel off the seat, the tremble in his thighs and the sound of his gasp.
His current abhorrence for Gryffindors was borne of their detestable attitude and resulting behaviours to his person. The way they whispered about him so obviously when he swept past, and the way the more idiotic ones - like that third-year, Powers - saw fit to knock over his books or hiss “freak” at him in the halls.  He also despised their tendency to band together and laugh and to steal away potentially interesting people who might have been friends once if not for the pathetic House bigotry.
He’d never had alcohol on its own, really, without the accompaniment of heroin or cocaine. It was not a bad experience, insofar that he could tell.
By the time Sherlock gets home, it is well past midnight. His father is still up in the study, the paper open in front of him, not reading, smoking his pipe.
He found himself grabbing at Sherlock’s wrist; Sherlock let him. His skin was warm and dry to the touch, just as skin should be. John placed two fingers over where the radial artery ought to be, and thought, for one horrid moment, that he would feel nothing, Sherlock’s body still warm but blood bright red on the pavement, skull shattered as if it were sugar and thick red seeping out and—
“Sherlock,” John says,

being the next -  with styled dark hair and a leather jacket and pale skin that, in the darkness, seemed to be painted in the soft blue tones of twilight.
started up. That was only John - sleepwalking again. The drawn-out howling, those doleful, animal cries - that was the dog.
“I didn’t think we would have any classes together,” John said, and offered him a shy sort of smile that made Sherlock scowl because it made him feel funny. “I don’t suppose you’d want to be partners?”
“You have to admit it would have been a considerable improvement,” Sherlock said.
A small dark head reappeared in the distance, breaking the waves.
“Never mind,” Hazel said. She shook her head. “Now what did I say about playing with your food?”
He brings John’s hand to his own mouth, kisses each of the dirtied fingers, gently laps them clean. His own fingers reach out and he rubs the semen over John’s skin, staining the purity of him with white.
But when Madam Pomfrey poured the healing potion directly into his wound, it was John’s turn to do an impression of a tea kettle, except the sound that he made was more towards the high-pitched whining end of the spectrum.
“And the zucchinis are coming in! So many zucchinis!”
John nods, reassured. Nothing below the waist and his purity’s intact; he really is an idiot sometimes. Sherlock doesn’t mind so much.
John was a terrible lush. His predilection for alcohol showed in the false euphoria it gave him, how he found the slightest cliched wordplay hilarious, and how, horrifyingly, it even made him
And so he drinks, and he smokes, and he drags, and even after winning five races in a row half-juiced on whiskey while chain-smoking cigarettes he’s still ready to tear screaming out of his own skin.
“Oh, you should have heard him. He was a hundred percent young Hollywood. You know I always said he should have concentrated in Theatre. Impersonating people was his favourite thing.” Victor pauses and corrects himself, “Well, you know, after being right.”
"But what were you doing there?" John asks. This is not so fine.
“So you were a couple of juvenile delinquents,” John smiles.
What did John have to hide?
“Lick,” Sherlock commands.
“You know, I’ve been thinking about you,” Sherlock said.
some things I can do for you,” Mycroft finally said.
“Now, not so much,” he admits.
Rocking, and then small shifting movements, in and out. The tightness of his body was giving away, he was opening, yielding. Hot, whimpering. His body opening more and more, need unfurling in the pit of his stomach, dark flower blooming. Slick slide out and then the easy glide back in. And again. Sherlock moving into him, inside him, and he was so close, closer than John had thought possible, climbing right up inside of him, his cock pushing into the softness of his organs, rearranging his insides. John’s face pushed against his pillow, clutching at it, at the sheets, the linen summer humid and damp from his panting breath, his sweat, his open mouth.
tried to scream and he could not, the sound   (
“Oh, yeah?” Sherlock asked, perking up a little.
His tongue adhered and rippled against the curve of the spoon, practically fellating it as he sucked, and then pulled away to carefully trace the edge.  He drew delicate slow-healing trails through the viscous fluid with just the tip of his tongue, and then caught the resulting drips and drew them back into his mouth.  At one point, he simply stuck the spoon in his mouth (his hot, wet mouth), sucking at it hard enough to make the stem waggle, and moaned softly in delight at the sweetness.
“He’s only meeting with a professor, Bill,” said Mike, “not going up against the Wizengamot.”
except just then John looked at Sherlock and really saw him.
“I know, it sounds mad,” says John. “In fact, I’m still certain I’m certifiable.”
“I don’t remember the last time he blinked,” whispered John, concerned.
And then he shoved up hard, both hands holding John down, bodies smacking together, forcing him to sit flush against his hips, completely impaled upon his cock.
Now he finally understands, with a bubble of sound caught in his throat, the moonlight on the gleam of scales and wet skin pressed against him. Strong arms with corded muscle slide around him, wrap around him and trap him, sinuous steel, and wet lips press to his ear.
“Goodnight, Bill,” said Mike.

“I did no such thing,” said Sherlock. “I said I would grade the quality of your made-up story a
Summer of 1953, summer of bruised lips and blood-stained teeth; of wrongness and wildfire.
Sherlock scraped his teeth against the trembling skin of his stomach. “I think I’ll need to hear you say it again.”
“Well I think everybody’s making a big deal outta nothing. Philip said that the Sheriff said that the next time he’s caught out he’ll be spending the night in jail, just to teach him a lesson!”
Rocky.”
John breathes, eyes closed, nodding.
“You intrigue me,” Sherlock said. John’s pulse picked up for no apparent reason.
He’d nearly exploded with joy when he saw the great-horned owl; two days after he turned eleven. It was both a surprise and a rather fortunate thing that he hadn’t; it was difficult to attend school to learn magic when one was a messy pile of once-John smithereens.
A few years back, Tulsa, Oklahoma was dubbed America’s Most Beautiful City by Time magazine. A city with wide, clean streets...towering buildings that gleam in the clear, fresh air of a smokeless industrial center . . . mile upon mile of residential areas as beautiful as a quarter million prideful residents can make them . . . one of the nation's finest vacationlands right next door . . . and general --
,” John whispered, all under his breath, as if he said it too loudly he might still get in trouble.
“Professor Hudson!” Carl whinged.
“Well, I’ve never met any boys without tails, so there you have it,” Sherlock said.
John smiles, pulls him in for another kiss, this one softer. Feels Sherlock’s skin warm, his shirt slightly damp with sweat.
“Never!" John knew the rules. "This is the first time!”
John buttons up his collar tight at school, but the wine-red-violet bruises still peek through, incriminating, daring. He wears a scarf for a few days and then switches to a turtleneck and no one accuses him of being a beatnik. Sherlock catches him later, traps him between his body and the shaded brick wall, and sucks a hickey hard, above the edges of the turtleneck.
The first death was necessary.
So he had stopped drinking tea.
) like the broken radiator in church, it was so hot, he was so hot everywhere, when he opened his eyes his vision was blurry, blurring with - sweat? Tears?
Sherlock jumped up, shouting with shock. (It might have been a scream, even.) His cigarette dropped onto the carpet and John was suddenly an accessory to arson.
“Wow,” said John, agreeably. “But I bet Hogwarts has a whole lot less students who go to the Infirmary with vines and leaves and stuff stuck in funny places,” he added, remembering the pictures from Sherlock’s illicit book.
The night air rushed into the room, autumn’s chilling breath upon John’s face, slipping in between his pajama shirt and his skin. He shivered. John looked down at his hands, remembered the ice-like smoothness of the windowpane beneath his fingertips. He gave himself a sharp pinch to his own arm, and was rewarded with a bloom of pain.
“Is it really 11?” John asks. “How long was I asleep?”
“Hold it right there,” Sherlock said, taking his expression for agreement. “Just like that.”
John felt like the monkey banging on his heart suddenly broke down. He felt his heart drop away.
The stellar remains shrink rapidly.
Sherlock narrowed the short distance between them and slid John’s belt out of the loops of his trousers. He snapped it between his hands, a sharp sound that cracked through the air. “Should bind your hands together sometime with this. I’d like to see you gagged with your tie in your mouth. Would you like that?” John forgot how to breathe for a moment. The very words had gagged him and stolen away his voice. He was giving away just how much he would like that, indeed.
“Fucking-! Give me that!” John rasped. A mighty struggle for the camera ensued, John hugging it to himself like a rugby ball while Sherlock clung to it stubbornly with his obnoxiously big hands.
John sang along with the song blaring tinnily from the speakers overhead.
Sherlock had seen bodies more destroyed than this; scenes far more gruesome, far less fresh. He had smelled a body left to rot for three weeks in oppressive summer heat; he had smelled much worse than the warmth of fresh blood and shit that filled his nostrils now. And yet he retched again.
maybe have Piracy as part of the curriculum.
For the time being, at least.
John rounded the corner to find a mysterious figure down near the end of the hall, his back to him. His silhouette stood stark and striking, the sunlight a glowing corona around his dark robes.
“Were you just talking to
“Sherlock was being bullied, Professor,” John said. “I had to step in! That’s how the fight started.”
Stop. Rewind.
“No,” said Sherlock quickly. “Well, yes. I mean, yes, but it’s not what you think. Don’t take away House points. Can you get me a terrarium?”
Now John was starting to worry. What if Sherlock wasn’t going to school this morning? What if he was sick? Or worse, what if something had happened to him?
"It’s already enough that you’re here. You didn’t even get a detention! I'm fairly sure I'm meant to do this alone. I mean, not that I’m not
He had leaned out of the window far enough to fall, and the swoop in his stomach was like he already was falling, with only Sherlock there to catch him, to pull him out into the night.
Sherlock could not pinpoint the moment when he fell asleep, when his thoughts slipped gently and blurred into dreams. John’s voice was a murmuring hum in the background, fading. Sherlock’s thoughts slowed and smoothed themselves out.
“I could be wrong,” said John carefully, “but I think...that’s none of your business.”
John’s chest arched forward, ropes around his pectorals making a pretty presentation of his nipples. They were hard and swollen from Sherlock’s cruel twisting and teasing, turned puffy and pink.
“Sacred Wonder-full Anti-evil Guardian,” said Bill. “It should ward off bad luck, Curses, nightmares, and minor skin problems. And it will protect you from the Evil Eye.”
Her hand squeezes Sherlock's thigh, soft and suggestive. "You know, if you need an idea of what to do with all that delicious frustration, I have a few creative illuminations."
“Oh, Sherlock,” she says, shaking her head. There’s a pity in her voice that makes Sherlock grit his teeth, just slightly. She slides an arm around his shoulders and gives him a squeeze. Sherlock tenses.
John had seemed different. He had been
Breath catching, Sherlock snatched up the camera and closed in. Strong, vulnerable, battered--if John could see what he looked like asleep, he would understand he had nothing to fear from any camera.
“Particularly not,” she added, “before a Disciplinary Meeting in regards to fighting in school.”
“You don’t have to answer right now,” said Sherlock. “But there is
"Yes, oh god yes," John says, nodding frantically. His eyes are squeezed shut with the sensation of it, eyelashes dusky against his cheeks.
He would taste the cigarettes on her breath later, when she hedged him up against a wall and kissed him. He would discover that he liked looking up at her. She was a very handsome girl. With her grey eyes and long dark ponytail and her long, coltish legs, she was far too striking for an ordinary word like “pretty.”
Her words were stolen away from her, strangled in the grip of a sharp wind. She could not tell if the water on her face was tears or rain.
In the window, stripes of red glowed bright across the white flesh of the Lord’s back. The sun scattered drops of red onto the congregation like rose petals, or perhaps flecks of blood.
He was so pleased, in fact, that he didn’t even notice the slug that had started to make its way up his leg.
“My affection,” Bill replied, “is the better part of my valor.”
Approximately 60,000 to 80,000 wildfires occur in the United States every year.

how long the incubation period is, after all.”
A giant ball of twine sits in the middle of town in Cawker City, surrounded by banners of red, white, and blue. John reckons it is the size of a barn. A banner declares it to be the World’s Largest Ball of Twine. For a city whose population peaks at 500 on a good day, this is a big deal.

Then John says, “But you’re the coolest.”
Harriet and John both volunteered to help out in the garden, although Harry soon grew bored of picking strawberries and began chasing the dog around instead. John, on the other hand, was a bit
“It’s not anything you would be interested in,” Sherlock replied.
Tidepools, John knew, were full of interesting things, like shells and clams and see-an-enemies and little crabs. He nodded with understanding. It made sense that Sherlock would want to look at them, because John wanted to look at these things too.
Sherlock’s lips were cool against his, cold from the night air, surprisingly soft. John was being kissed, at last, for the first time, and the ache deep down in the marrow of his bones became a surge: at once both rushing satisfaction and desire for more, so much more.
“Oof,” John says, tries to speak and spits out a mouthful of black hair. “Pfft.”
“What?” John said, quickly drawing his hand away.
In the school gymnasium, they have dimmed the lights and strewn up pink and purple streamers of cheap crepe paper. They are playing saccharine Top 40 tunes.
his Housemates didn’t like him now, but he wished that they would, even if it was just a little bit.
Sherlock clutched the edges of the book tight, and waited for it. Weird. Boring. Strange. Unhealthy.
It took only a small amount of coordination to slide up into the space left open between John’s spread thighs, so that his ankles rested on Sherlock’s back, chain strung between them, the two of them bound together now. His dick slid neatly into the warm, slippery crevice of John’s arse and he rubbed it up and down in the wetness that dripped out of his closed hole, teasing them both.
“Hmph!” said Sherlock, who felt a need to express his general displeasure. His fingers gently probed John’s swelling left eye; John winced but did not flinch away. “I don’t think anything’s broken. Do you think you can make it to the Infirmary, or do I need to carry you?”
Anderson’s face fell for a moment before he turned white with fury. “You little Dark Wizard shit!” he swore. He shoved Sherlock, hard against the wall, causing all his books and scrolls to go flying all over the floor. Anderson stomped on an essay, purposefully grinding the scroll underneath his heel before walking away.
Something was playing there. Somehow, John didn’t quite want to watch it, he felt the urge to cover his eyes, and, as he might when he was younger, peep only from the safety of between his fingers.
What sounded like hundreds of tiny birds were chattering just outside his window. A flock of migrating house sparrows had chosen to nest, temporarily, in the tree next to John’s window, and they had woken him up every day for the past week. When he finally blinked his eyes open he could see the little brown blobs hopping from branch to branch, through the window, fluttering their wings.
Slippery and wet and pushing into him. John jolted, gasped, and his body jerked purely from the shock but Sherlock’s hands were keeping his thighs open. Wetness, so soft, slippery and sinful and so filthy and good, slithering inside of him in a way that made him whimper with the shameful pleasure of it.
“I’m not so sure,” she said, and shook her head. “Sometimes when we’re together it’s like you’re here but...you’re not, like you’re off somewhere else.”
“I know,” said John, and stopped where he stood, frowning. “And that’s why I don’t get into cars with strangers.”
So it was a wonder when he didn’t jump or scream, when it happened - what he’d been waiting for, what he’d been dreading: the knock at the window.
“Sherlock!” John hollered, banging on the window. “Open up!”
If he closes his eyes and listens, there it is - next to the beat of his heart. He can feel it like a pulse, often unnoticed,  always present. Melancholy is the melody, and how it haunts him. It slithers into all the dark crevices of his mind, curls up like a snake in the hollow.
inside its terrarium at all times. Then, perhaps, we will work on Charms for your drawer.”
Dead.
Then John took up his pail and shovel - because a weapon was necessary, for adventures, and a shovel was as good as any.
“No,” John replied, and put his bike into that awaiting chamber. He had to reach up on the tips of his toes to get the lid of the trunk, before slamming it closed with both hands.
“You’re such a slut for me,” Sherlock said, rolling his hips as John arched, whimpered and clenched around his dick. “Only me, only me.”
"Seeing as how you're only 18, how long ago could it have been?" John points out.
Of course. Victor
Sherlock likes John on top of him, clutching and desperate, the weight of him slight and they fit into each other like one gear into another, working each other, each one making the other turn. He likes him underneath him, and that’s where he ends up next. John caged in by his arms and pinned down, struggling and wriggling, pushing back but never hard enough, never meaning it, and, like the little idiot that he is, never actually trying to escape.
His logic was sound. Even just a mile seemed impossible at this rate, in this growing darkness. But there were some things that were beyond logic, the uncomfortable
This was all silly, he knew, and he told himself so as he stared determinedly into the suds and running water frothing over his hands.
Sherlock rewarded him with one of his weird little smiles, the kind that was a little crooked and wonky and strange, like he was an alien trying to imitate human expressions. It was a little funny-shaped and it wasn’t quite happy but it was amused and maybe a bit happy all the same. John realised that this was the first time Sherlock had smiled at him since they’d met.
! Even if that’s the clearly
Sherlock above him was only a shape in the dark. John tried to focus on his face and he couldn’t. And was Sherlock so quiet; eerily    silent.   The only sounds in the room were the sounds John was making, his little animal sounds, the hiccuping breaths, the sick solid smacking of flesh together on impact again and again. Sherlock was not speaking or moaning or panting, he was dead silent, he was not panting, no sound  of  breath, no   breath-
Sherlock’s hands were all over his body. Touching him wherever they could reach, over his hair, his neck, his chest, his arms. Exploring him, running all over, wandering all over, up underneath his shirt, cool hands on his bare skin, skimming over all the sensitive parts of him, squeezing him as if trying to feel him out.

When John looked at Sherlock, however, and beamed and beamed like he’d just watched an Abraxan take flight into a stunning sunset for the very first time, and he whispered, “You’re a
Over on the sofa, John looked up from his work applying leather conditioner into his best boots, favourite belt and pocket holster. “You what.”
"John," he said.
, and then, inexplicably, the warmth in the pit of his stomach and the rising flush to his cheeks the longer those eyes lingered upon his skin.
, came an unbidden thought, and she didn’t know where it had come from. It was not something that Hazel Watson would normally think.
In a few hours, it would be morning.
“Don’t be silly,” said John. “We’re partners. That means we help each other and we do everything together. We’re a team. Isn’t that right?”
Safety was but an illusion.
Sherlock cast, causing the little pile to promptly burst into flame.
“Oh, John, I want to believe you,” Bill said, quite tragically. “But that also might just be your head injury talking.”
“No way!” said John.
“Do you see anybody else here?” Sherlock made a grand gesture to show how empty the room was. “You have to be under observation; and who, do you know, is better at observation than me?”
"Oh gosh, you guys don’t
“It was actually because of Carl Powers,” John corrected.
(See the end of the chapter for
Heat rose off of John’s skin in waves, sultry and languid. He was so hot that the air around him seemed to almost shimmer like a desert mirage. Or, perhaps, and more logically perhaps, it was merely lust that fogged up Sherlock’s vision and cloaked his brain, with John tied up and perfect, splayed over Sherlock’s lap, stuffed full of his cock.
“I’m gonna be ill,” Mike said faintly.
“Can I make a whale?”
Inside his room, John stared at the mirror, and ran the comb through his hair once again. He couldn’t get his hair to settle down, and he’d changed his shirt three times already. He
“Yes,” John said. “I can see that.”
Sherlock staring down at him, dead silent

“Because....?” Mike prompted.
Together, now.
Sherlock set his cup down and pressed his hands together, a gesture that let John know - with a little flutter of excitement - that Sherlock was about to explain A Thing.
“That’s...but...but, no,” John says numbly, squirming away from the touch. “That can’t possibly work.”
John watched with rapt attention, as the slug slowly inched across the table.

he’d tell John,
In London, Sherlock says, the fogs are thick, and dark, and oh, so very quiet.  It is strange, like a muffled blanket dropped on the whole city, letting London keep its secrets in silence.  They say anything can happen in London, in the fog.
"I'll be careful," Sherlock promises, because pain is a factor that John doesn't really know about. I'll look after you, he doesn't say, but he will, if that's what John needs to hear. Sherlock will promise anything if it gets him what he wants. The easiest lie.
“I’m all right, thank you,” says Sherlock evenly.
“...I was at the library.”
“If fields of grass thrill you so inexorably,” Sherlock drawls, “then the ocean is going to blow your mind.”
Sherlock pressed against him, body pinning him to the stall, tongue and then teeth on John’s skin and rubbing a finger against John
“So….your relationship…” John begins, clears his throat. “It was...fun?”
This close, he could see flecks of green in Sherlock’s eyes, like chips of broken bottle glass. The light in his bedroom glowing above them formed a yellow halo around Sherlock’s dark hair.  He could see the shine of his own saliva on Sherlock’s lips. And then he saw nothing as he closed his eyes, mouth opening for another kiss.
His parting words lingered with John long after he was gone:
, John noted, looked dirty and grease-stained and crumby; it had been pristine and brand-new last week. It made John’s chest twinge to see Sherlock thumbing delicately through the soiled pages. Mike blew up their cauldron because he added four horned slugs instead of three. Sherlock finished early; his potion had a pure golden tone, shimmering and perfect. It was placed in the front of the class as an example of what all their brews were meant to look like.
“Hurry it up,” Sherlock said, feeling the heat of John’s palm press into his belly.
“Well, that’s nice of you to say, and I really hope so, but…” John trailed off, wondering if this boy somehow had the power to read his mind.
account. No one had ever been hospitalised on Sherlock’s account before, and of the very short list of people that would do something that grand (Mummy, Mycroft) he found that he sincerely did not want them to, ever. It was only a John Watson thing to do, then, and Sherlock could not figure out why he’d done it, and for once, not knowing was more intriguing than infuriating.
John sighed and opened his eyes wide so that Bill could assess them for himself. “See? Nothing evil going on, okay? But I think you’ve given me a headache now.”
The way Sherlock was looking at him was certainly helping with that. “Just think of me away over in Germany on a case.” He pressed his cheek to the side of John’s head and spoke into John’s hair, voice dropping to a coaxing purr that rolled through John’s muscle and bone. “Missing you terribly. Opening that photo on my phone to remember just how soft your lips were when I covered them with mine. What you tasted like. How warm and strong and pliant you were in my arms when I held you and bent you backwards in my eagerness.” He swayed illustratively, arching John back a little. John shivered again; he felt Sherlock smile into his hair. Sherlock’s lips brushed John’s ear as he tilted his head to murmur, “And then what we did next, after I put down the camera.”
For another moment, John stared at him as if Sherlock had begun speaking in very rapid French. Then his lashes fell to veil his eyes, his lips parted, and something indefinably alluring happened to his posture.
There were meant to be words. What were words? There were blank spaces and nothingness where words were meant to be.
“I don’t know,” she said. “Do you even like me the way I like you?”
” John said, indicating the book, which was open to a very lovely rendering of a person choking to death on Bloodroot, “you can borrow some comic books as...proof I’ll return it.”
Sherlock has beautiful hands - elegant and pale and long-fingered. They are a musician’s hands, the kind that can coax wood and string to sing, they are the hands of a scientist, slicing into a specimen layer by layer, until all the secrets of its anatomy have been found out. Kind hand, violent hand, cruel in gentleness, loving in brutality.
“Hey, has anybody seen Harry?” said a melodic girl’s voice. John could hear the noise outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. The secret society had come to collect their wayward member.
“Come on,” Sherlock said, and slid easily into the pool in the middle of the cave. The water was still quite shallow, but it was enough for Sherlock to slide on, pulling himself forward with his hands and his tail pushing, strong and undulating. It was like watching a little seal move, except Sherlock didn’t look silly doing it like John thought he would. He looked graceful the way that animals did, sliding along smoothly. His tail gleamed silvery-blue as he moved, in the darkness towards the light.
“We take fighting amongst students very seriously here at Hogwarts, Mr. Watson. And so early on in the year, too,” Madam Pomfrey reproached. “You don’t seem like that type of boy, but heed my warning that multiple offences shall be met with various disciplinary measures, up to and including expulsion.”
What was infuriating, however, was that he could not currently see John because John had idiotic
, oh wow, an owl, oh wow he owned an owl, how brilliant was that!) and his trunk and then all that was once order was chaos. All that he had known for his entire admittedly rather short life was now standing on the platform, waving up at him, and he didn’t know anybody and he was on his own.
The twist deep down in the core of John’s body when Sherlock stared at him, that undeniable pull inside like someone tugging on sinew, the hot,
On August 27, 1587 Governor John White sailed from the newly-founded English colony on Roanoke Island. He left behind the first settlement in the new English colony of Virginia, consisting of eighty-nine men, seventeen women, and eleven children. One of those children was his own granddaughter, the first English child to be born in the New World — Virginia Dare. None of these colonists were ever seen by English eyes again.
Sherlock said, his whole little body sliding closer in the shallow water, hand still on John’s wrist. His voice had taken on that odd, pleasant little thrum to it again, that made John feel like he was listening to a lullaby.
John wanted to ask Sherlock what House that he thought he’d end up in. (Or rather, what House Sherlock
And then he bit him.
Still, he found Sherlock’s absolute confidence reassuring. The Slytherin boy was holding pressure onto the dressing, and he lifted up an edge of it to look at the cut.
“Professional dominatrix,” Victor says, and shakes his head. “And here I am, a barrister. My parents never told me there were more career paths out there than doctor or lawyer. Clearly, I’ve wasted my life. ”
Sherlock swore, mostly cursing himself. He had miscalculated the angle when he had aimed, he had not quite accounted for the kickback of the gun in his hand, and although this wound was most likely fatal, it was not the easy kill-shot he had been hoping for. He had never been the excellent marksman that John was.
"Where?" Sherlock prompts, lightly tapping the tip of one erect nipple with his fingers. "Right here?"
Three smashed vials and one green-and-purple-splattered wall later, Sherlock didn’t feel much better. So he slammed his book shut and headed for the Hospital Wing.
This of course prompted Sherlock to immediately clap his hand over John’s mouth, since he’d promised Madam Pomfrey 1.) not to make a commotion 2.) not to disturb John 3.) not to kill John, and although Sherlock was fairly sure he could get away with breaking the last two rules without ever being found guilty, if John screamed she might think he was guilty of all three.
Sherlock grumbled. “But I want to keep Rachmaninoff - the slug - in my room, next to my bed. I need to be able to observe him whenever I like and the Common Room is too busy and full of people always and that’s too distracting for me. And Trevor will probably mess with him if I keep him out in the open. It is very important that Rachmaninoff stays in my room. It is imperative. In the name of the pursuit of knowledge. For magic.”
It was just as well that he couldn’t find it. Sarah had a lot to tell him, like he was a nice boy, and she really, really liked him, and they’d had a swell time together, but...
she mean to you?” John asks again, even more on edge with the grammatical edit.
“I’m not sure about this,” John admitted. Still panting, feeling weird, scared and wrong. He’d only wanted kissing, really, had only thought so far. He had no idea what Sherlock intended to do, what he wanted, only that it was sinful and bad and wrong, so forbidden that John had no comprehension of it.
“Now this
Such awe in him. So much to be in awe of, in him.
By the time John made it down, Harry was already seated at the table, jamming breakfast into her mouth. His plate was noticeably empty of bacon, with one sad little half-piece left.
inside, wet with lube, welcoming and wanting, and Sherlock didn’t stop pushing until he was in all the way, his balls against the curve of John’s arse. His weight on top of John held them both down, the chain kept John’s legs up in place; they were the two of them locked together.
“I do
The bastard laughed and dropped another kiss to his stomach. “Since you asked so nicely.”
only yesterday, a personal victory that, while he had not directly admitted it to Sherlock, had been made obvious by the quiet
He had walked through his day as if in a trance - who had he spoken to? What things had he done? Nothing could touch him. Only the prickling buzz underneath his skin, like the vibrating hum of cicadas at the end of summer. The now-familiar heaviness in his stomach.  His heart fluttered in his chest every time he thought about it: Sherlock’s lips on his, his fingertips against John’s own cheek - gentle. How unexpectedly soft and welcoming Sherlock’s mouth had been.
John swore (and it was the most he’d ever sworn - he was raised better than that). He’d landed hard on the pavement, and his body thudded with pain. His palms were skinned and bleeding, with little pebbly bits he had to pick out. His trousers felt sticky and damp at his knees, scratched up gray and dusty on the outside, sore enough to let him know that he’d skinned both knees as well.
!! Her art is as cute as she is ;3;
John began to talk, describing the plot of a story, something about a crime lord with a disfigurement who became a maniacal jester. He was already yawning by the point in the story where the man fell into a ‘chemical’ vat, which Sherlock gathered was something like a botched potion.
He was gone in the next moment, and when he returned he had that clicking black monstrosity in his hands.
- the sound of someone screaming.
“I don’t know,” said John. “Maybe.”
“No, you wouldn’t,” said Harry.
Probably it wasn’t all bad. Maybe they needed something to slow them down a bit, even if John felt a bit lousy that the ‘something’ was his own issues. Left to their own devices, the two of them barrelled into situations head-on, with little regard for life or limb. Relationships were not meant to be acts of terrorism or high-speed pursuits.
painted on them or maybe fashioned funny hats out of aluminium foil.
“You’ll have to take some zucchini home with you, dear. We’ve already given a bunch of them away and they just keep coming in!”
"You have some interesting old friends," John remarks later, after Irene Adler has wiggled her black-clad curves away. Irene Adler, or as she is more infamously known, school-wide, and most likely, county-wide: The Woman.
John slumbered peacefully on. Sherlock listened to his breathing, felt the rise and fall of his chest against his body. He found himself humming along, unthinkingly, to a song on the radio. The tune was very familiar.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up with that rare, beautiful look of wonder that John got to see when he’d done something truly unexpected. He glanced with an uncertain frown between John’s face, probably red with more need than he’d ever felt in his life, to his hole, gripping hungrily at the two fingers that were managing to only tease him with the promise of being filled. He was this close to begging for Sherlock’s cock like one of those porn videos he’d watched in uni between girlfriends.
asleep,” she added.
“So, then,” Sherlock continued, “What actually did occur makes far more sense - that perhaps I was walking out of the library, and you, having just recently come from Charms with your failing exam results, found me an easy target. You pushed me down and then proceeded to taunt me, ruining my homework in the process. A crowd gathered. John came to help. You, however, continued to persist, shoving John to the ground, a poor decision that ended, pleasantly, with his fist in your face.”
John headed for the library, head down, careful not to make eye contact with anyone. This vantage point that also allowed him to keep a close watch for any stray legs that might suddenly appear in his path. If he walked briskly enough he didn’t have to overhear anything, and he was only knocked into twice - both times happening so quickly that they could have been interpreted as accidents, if he so chose.
John’s eyes popped open.
“Good!” Sherlock chirped. “Then give me your wrist.”
Sherlock looked at him, his mouth dropping open in a comical little ‘o’ of surprise. John relished it. It made the throbbing in his head worth it.
In New York, Sherlock says, the neon lights flicker all night, and the skyscrapers are tall in a way that reminds us that our ancestors once held a foolish desire to reach God.
“Hey!” John tried, and feigned a look of surprise that he couldn’t really see, because he didn’t want to risk using the bakery window again. “What a coincidence!”
“Oh,” said John, with a little breath of relief. “So it’s...you think it’s okay.”
“Hey!” said Bill.
Kissing Sherlock for a picture, though? He wrinkled up his nose. That was so… He was still adjusting to kissing Sherlock without pictures.
But then John thought of his Mummy’s face, all sad and crying. Daddy would be sad, too. Maybe even Harry would miss having someone to boss around.
Sherlock scoffed. “She probably thinks intercourse is something that’s served between the appetizer and the entree.”
John had always been aware that Sherlock
He wondered if the Hat took requests.
Sherlock took his pleasure, greedily, easily. The sight of John so lost to sex and sensation made him helplessly aroused, made the dirty lust burn hot inside of his body, his own heart pounding and breath smouldering in his lungs. He rammed himself in deep, and John groaned and pushed back, wanting deeper, needing it, all the while moaning like a whore. John had always been like this, meeting him halfway, two thirds of the way, all the way; he wanted everything Sherlock could give him and then he always begged for more. He had always been miraculous, in his own way.
“No!” he said firmly, pulling away. “It’s mine.”
is where Sherlock has him, where John needs him. Thrusts right up into him and John clenches, spins out a sound that is half-whine and half moan. "Ready?" Sherlock asks, hips moving in teasing, rubbing motions, pulls out just enough so that the head of his dick is rubbing against John's prostate so that he can watch John shake.
Milk, Ice Cream.
Although his prayers had been answered, although he’d been strong, he couldn’t help thinking that this relief felt awfully similar to disappointment.
“I like oatmeal,” John said, cheerily.
Sherlock’s cock inside of him, the force of Sherlock’s body pushing into him, hips against the curve of his backside, Sherlock’s mouth against John’s ear, lips kissing his hair, his hands all over John’s body, clutching, squeezing. It was so big, it was inside him, it was
“Hazel,
The petroleum jelly warms to something viscous between his fingers. He presses just one finger against that tight little hole; a moment of resistance but one finger slides in easily, John's body hot all around him. John's brow furrows with the odd feeling, a look of confusion. "Sherlock, that's weird," he says, and then gasps when Sherlock bends to gently lap at the head of his cock as distraction.
“We were dating,” Victor says slowly.
“Mm,” Sherlock murmurs, humming into his kisses. “You’re not nearly hip enough.”
"I wouldn't want to disrespect your wishes," Sherlock says. "Nothing below the waist, right? I couldn't do that to you. I couldn't wrap my fingers around your dick and stroke you just right, and squeeze and rub you until you come all over my fingers. I couldn't take your cock into my mouth and lick and suck on you as if you were the most delectable treat I've ever had. That would be unkind, wouldn't it, John?"
John couldn’t tell you your profession by your shoes or whether your wife was unfaithful by the cut of your suit, but he can tell the tension in Victor’s shoulders and the tightness in his eyes. He can see the sleepless nights and the meaningless, endless days. Perhaps it is that grief calls to grief; it is that one void recognises another, like dark magnetite in the earth attracting iron.
"How about -- oh."
The sea was already so close to them, and now it was coming closer.
before bed tonight.”
He looked at John, very quickly, and then back to his writhy black potato again. He proceeded to scowl at it, as if displeased with its very existence.
“Hey!” John called up, pelting pebble number five. “I know you’re home, you jerk!” Pebble number six.
“Don’t be silly,” John said, and pecked her lightly on the mouth. “You’re the only girl for me.”
The plastic of the bouquet rustles in John’s hand, his palm sticky with the bare and bleeding stems. He sucks in a deep breath. They are both quiet then, looking down at the name etched in smooth black marble. The leaves whisper all around them as the wind twists its way through the cemetery trees.
- Sherlock imbued that word with particular scorn, until it was a little burst of a black scribble in his mind - who very obviously did not like Sherlock, and moreover, sought to poison John’s mind against him. It was enough to make one want to throw things against the wall.
“Yes, well,” Harry says, “We can’t
wallpaper and berber carpet splattered with telltale flowers of blood. It was John stirring the sugar into Sherlock’s tea in the morning, with the same hand that had fired a gun the night before. It was bickering over whether or not one could perform dissections of necrotic severed limbs upon the kitchen table, and savage battles of rolled-up newspapers to determine who had power of the remote control for the evening.
Victor cocks his head at him curiously, dark eyes glittering with amusement. He lets his lashes drop, hooded gaze for a moment, regarding John. John feels a hot sensation, tingling just underneath his collarbones. “Oh, yes,” Victor says, “Before it got bad, it was so, so
“Iwearridiculousjumpers.tumblr.com,” Sherlock suggested helpfully. “Weareoutofmilk.tumblr.com. Myflatmateisagenius.tumblr.com. Ilikemyflatmatesbig--”
“Not helping, Bill!” John cried. It was really quite a feeling, to have one’s fragile little ego, only recently rebuilt, shatter into a million pieces. He’d never quite experienced anything like it.
“Mycroft, don’t be
“Oi! Hold still so I can squeeze you,” John told the Bubotuber sternly, but it paid him no heed. He gave one of the shiny swellings on its body a firm squeeze while it wiggled around, sending a projectile spurt of yellow-green goo arcing up into the air and splattering onto a desk, completely missing the bottle.
As for Sherlock, he is all gone to ashes, incinerated, with only pieces of bone and teeth recognizable.
They look at each other awkwardly, both of them dressed up and holding bouquets, as if they were two teenagers who have shown up on the same girl’s doorstep, to pick up the same date.
He’d gotten hard in math class thinking about it. In between the applications of
John swallowed; for the first time since arriving at Hogwarts he felt genuine fear. He
When they kissed it was slow and tentative, almost shy, the unhurried brush of lips against one another, the lightest pressure of mouth to mouth. It was not a tentativeness that came from inexperience or ignorance, but rather from knowing too much, too well, knowing the cost of loss. Sherlock’s hands shook and his whole body was shaky and his lips were just so - so light and tender against John’s mouth. It was as if he could shatter him with the wrong touch. It was not because John was fragile, for there was no fragility about John, but it was because Sherlock knew too much about the fragility of humans, their skulls and soft brains and vital, beating hearts.
“That was...fantastic,” John said.
Sherlock picked up the camera and sidled around behind his chair. “What’s wrong with documenting your face while you sleep?” He liked touching John, he liked having John near, but just now John was planting one foot firmly on the leather chair with a throttling kind of look in his eye. Sherlock drew his arm back, just in case John got strategic and went for the camera again. “I
“The camera isn’t hurt, but I may have broken something,” Sherlock declared to the room at large.
“Now, Mr. Powers, this isn’t the first instance where you’ve had an issue with fighting, now is it?” Professor Hudson asked.
"Please," John corrected himself breathlessly. He laughed a little, that sound just as breathless, and Sherlock laughed a little too, the irony of Sherlock reminding John of his manners not escaping either one of them.
Hazel had left John in the bath 20 minutes ago, and now she was returning to check on him. He was old enough to bathe himself, but he still needed reminders to scrub and wash behind his ears. Such activities were often forgotten when one was busy splashing around and playing battleship with the sponges.
“Look at you,” Sherlock said, because he knew John was looking. His voice had that roughness to it that came out only during sex, that John knew so well. John’s blood ran hot all through his body, and a small damp spot formed underneath Sherlock’s fingers, right where they insisted on pressing and rubbing the material against the sensitive head of his cock - the wetness of his own excitement.
“John!” she screamed. The roar of the ocean was in her ears, the wailing cry of gulls overhead.
John took a deep breath, and pulled himself back from the ledge.
All you
“Yes,” Mycroft agreed, “But I assure you that my room does not pose a severe health hazard to myself, my Housemates, and potentially the entire school.”
"What do beans have to do with anything?" John needed to know. "And why does the number of them matter?"
This is how John finds them, Sherlock leaning up against his car, Irene all but curled around him.
With that, Sherlock decided that he’d had enough of school. He’d given it the old college try, and now it was time to go home.
But when John smiles at him and says something like “You’re kookie,” because that’s the little bit of lingo that he’s hep to and so he says it a lot, Sherlock doesn’t know how to stop the endless meiosis, and all he wants to do is smear him with his DNA.
“Really?” asked John.
According to popular sentiment, the object of one’s affection was meant to resemble some rosy-cheeked cherub when they were asleep. John didn’t. He mostly looked tired.
oh shi-
And special thanks to people who made me lovely fanart!! Aahh!!
Sherlock puts a hand on cool stone and commits it to memory; the stone used for the well casing was brought in from the Medicine River, 12 miles south from here. John thinks about Sherlock’s hand on his heated skin in the dark, committing John to memory. Sherlock’s skin looks yellow in the light of the lamps mounted on the wall, his cheekbones thrown into sharp relief. He shouldn’t look good, but he does, and that’s Sherlock for you.
“What’s wrong, Mummy?”
Couldn’t think, couldn’t finish a thought, and the thrusting wasn’t slowing down, it was merciless. Crimson blooming in his mind, and heat all inside his body, thought of, (
“A new blog.” John sat back with undoubtedly premature satisfaction to regard his screen. “The other one is so…” His face twisted up. “Commercial these days. I'm trying to think of a name, though." He leaned forward and typed something.
As he closed his eyes, he could hear the rumble of an engine coming to life, the sound of tires rolling down an empty street...
But in the first week of their cohabitation, something happened. Sherlock, playing the first movement of Bach’s
that the latter did it.”
“Come on, John,” Sherlock said - and John liked the way that Sherlock said his name, although there was nothing special to it, it just had a nice, comforting sound - “Hop in. I promise I won’t bite.” He then flashed John a quicksilver smile, friendly gleam of white teeth in the darkness, and John heard himself laugh and say, “Yeah, all right. Thanks.”
"I know what that implies!" John snapped.
“Not that one, you incompetent woman!” Sherlock practically shouted. “That potion stings! You’re going to hurt him!”
And then nothing.
“What is it?” asked John.
shirt with
While searching he noticed something even better, the tree that went up the side of the house, with sturdy enough branches. Sherlock was fond of inviting himself into John’s bedroom in a similar manner.
Lying wins him a wide-eyed look, over-eager kiss. No prospects for the future, the guidance counselor had said, but what was the future?
Victor’s Sherlock was like that: wild, reckless, self-destructive. “Stole Sebby Wilkes’ motorbike once for an all-night joyride. I think we may have dumping it in the river, but don’t worry: Wilkes was a grade-A twat if you ever saw one.”
His method of asking, however, still lacked a certain...consensuality: John was leaning in, halfway to a kiss with his eyes drifting closed and mouth already parting, when Sherlock abruptly plastered a hand over his mouth.
But something inside of her stirred; a strange, off-kilter feeling as if her bones were on a tilt, as if the blood in her body were running backwards through her veins.
“Actually,” said Bill now, “I think there
“What do you mean?” John asked. “What could they possibly say about me and Sherlock?”
But still, there was sand.
“Something bad? Like what?” Sherlock’s tone was curious, but there was a silkiness to it, as if he were touched by John’s concern.
“Well, your arch-enemy, according to him,” John clarified. “Sometimes. Do people have arch-enemies? And is that a real part-time job?”
But it was natural, wasn’t it, to want a friend. Someone who understood the appeal of Poe and
“All right,” John said, smiling up at him, just as Bill and Mike entered the Common Room.
heat that flooded his blood and made his blood flood his face - it all made sense, then, with Sherlock’s chest against his and the curl of Sherlock’s fingers on his shoulders, burning,
“Oh, come on, I know I’m no Sherlock, but give me a little credit here,” Victor says. “Who was the text from? Bad news from your sister or…?”
“I want to move.”
His body is a wasteland in the aftermath, drained of all its energy. It is working on remembering the basic biological functions, his breath hot and heavy on John’s skin, John’s breath against his.  He collapses on top of John, blanketing him with his body. His mind is blissfully quiet for the first time in a very long time, and he closes his eyes to enjoy the silence, his forehead pressed to John’s cheek, both of them slick with sweat.
That had all changed when he’d been Sorted; he knew that look of crushing disappointment on John’s face, the sudden glimmer of instinctive fear. When he’d taken his seat at the Slytherin table, he’d indulged himself in a single glance back. Their eyes met for just a moment, and then John dropped his gaze, obviously uncomfortable.  Sherlock had not looked back since.
“What is it…?”
“Sherlock-” John said, strangled little sound. But it was too late, now, to say stop. He’d agreed, hadn’t he? He had moaned and he had nodded, and even now he was hot all over, and hard, twitching wet at the strange slippery sliding feeling, in and out.
“Sorry, seat’s taken,” Violet drawled, placing one slender hand on the spot next to her.
Because mer
Sherlock,” John said, and because Sherlock was
“Your Mummy’s not here, John,” Sherlock said, soft little voice going low for a second. The way  Sherlock said his name was funny, with a little musical hum to it. It made a hum vibrate through John's body as well, as if he were a string on a guitar or a harp being gently plucked. Sherlock's tail swished back and forth, the water curving out in tranquil waves around him. “Just a little look?”
“Well,” says Victor, “You
Perhaps it had swung around on its nail, or something. That must have been it. He put down the record he’d been holding, and walked over to the cross to fix it.
Caught with his pants down and his arse out, too tangled up to save himself, on the living room sofa in full view of God and Sherlock and...well, nobody else really, but it was the principle of the thing. It should’ve been humiliating, and his cheeks burned with the knowledge of it, but the butterflies in his stomach were fluttering a path right down to his cock.
When she looked up again, Harriet and the girl - Carla - were doing handstands in the water. And John was…
“And of course, Mr. Watson, there is one more thing I forgot to mention,” Professor Hudson said.
“That’s mighty big talk coming from someone who…yes, hm, who still wets the bed,” Sherlock replied. He looked him up and down, scrutinising. He was doing what John was starting to think of as the Sherlock Scan, wherein he tallied up one’s attributes, personal history, and calculated their stats in the matter of minutes.
In reality, it wasn’t all that different from kissing a woman, although the height difference was admittedly new - the tallest woman John had ever dated had been 5’8”. Aside from the craning, the only true difference was that when John opened his eyes, it was Sherlock blinking lazily down at him. John felt revealed under that gaze. It was a little like the first time they had met, when Sherlock could tell everything about him from a glance. John had wanted to hide from it and bask in it all at once. Kissing Sherlock, with his soft, enthusiastic, supernaturally unchapped lips, made a warmth unfurl in John’s chest, made his breath catch with excitement. Most of all, it had made him want to do it again.

The homeroom bell rang, its shrill chime bringing an end to conversation. They sat up straight and faced forward, paying attention as the teacher began roll call.
pictures?”
The return address read:
“We're not putting a picture of me next to a body on display in our living room. It upsets company." John turned back to his keyboard and poked it with an air of finality.
“There’s a button on it, what does it do? Does it explode?” Sherlock asked. He was suddenly very intrigued, with his thumb stroking over the raised part of the paw pad.
“Yes, please,” said Hazel.
"Sherlock!" John cried, aghast.
pictures. He liked archiving them, sorting them, cataloguing them all for his own edification. There was a part of him that enjoyed organisation. The fact that he enjoyed showing off was barely a consideration.
The keening sound that tears from John's throat is a single golden note of arousal and unhappiness. He arches his chest up into Sherlock's manipulative fingers, both hands clutching at Sherlock's back, his whole small body shivering violently. "Sherlock," he says, near tears, "Sherlock, just do it, touch me, please."
John and Harriet were arguing over the correct identification of a bird that they had seen. They had been playing a game that involved shouting out the different things they spotted along the road, but currently just seemed to involve a lot of shouting.
“You’re not distracting me that easily,” John said when he pulled away,  and he nipped playfully at Sherlock’s lip as punishment. He was smiling and his eyes were bright and his cheeks were flushed and he was panting a little, soft little huffs of breath between them. It was enough to make a man want to kiss him again. Devious.  “Now you go. When did you know you first wanted me?”
Those awful small, clutching hands. Those eyes. So large and pale, fixed upon her with a cold, unblinking stare. Hazel shuddered. She felt frost forming in her bone marrow.
And it wasn’t that he was unused to being stared at. It was not a thing that bothered him, normally. But to feel the heaviness of eyes upon the back of his neck, even when he sat in the very last row in Biology, where he never sat, was a bit too much.
“Say, I got school in the morning,” he said, instead. “I really really need to be getting to sleep.” It was the truth but why couldn’t the truth at least sound a little cooler? “And...it’s the middle of the night. You should get home before something bad happens to you.”
They had decided to head west, the way that dreamers do. There’d been a little argument at first about where to go, all the cities John had never seen yet- Los Angeles and Boston and New York and London.
Marvel of marvels, nature that made John Watson. How random the recombination of genes, the exchanging of alleles, the coding of DNA. One egg, one sperm, mother that sips alcohol even as she runs the Hoover downstairs, white-collar father whose hands get too heavy with the drink, the two of them who had exchanged curses and insults just as easily and perhaps with even greater passion than they had swapped bodily fluids. Both of them very ordinary, normal, boring, and yet: John.
“Are you all right?” Sherlock insisted, this time giving John a little shake by the shoulders.
“So what you are saying,” John said, “is that we could get away with murder as long as we don’t get caught.”
Then he ducked his head and smiled a bit sheepishly. “Bad news for me, it turns out you have to be a little more specific than just saying
His face burned with humiliation at the treachery of his own body, this state he once again found himself in. He beat Harry to the shower, turned it as cold as it would go, and threw his overheated body into the freezing spray; cold droplets stinging his skin just as hot tears of embarrassment, helplessness stung his eyes.
Sherlock really thought he wouldn’t wake up until morning, which was terribly dull, considering how very not-tired he himself was. He considered giving John a shake himself to wake him up, and after another moment’s consideration, he slid himself out of bed to do it. He had both hands on John’s shoulders and was about to shake him when John stirred and woke of his own accord, letting out a sharp little cry of surprise when he saw how close Sherlock’s face was to his own.
The children stopped abruptly.
tiny lil cookie today but long chapter coming up!  (Should we wait? hmm...)
“SLYTHERIN!” shouted the hat.
in his entire life.
What he does know is that some indiscernible amount of time later (and some indiscernible racket later), Victor is placing a hot cup of tea in his hands. John takes a sip. It is the worst cup of tea he has ever had: too bitter, too milky, and far, far too sweet, all at the same time.
John scrabbled to obey, letting out something close to a sob as he gave himself a good squeeze. His cock was hot and iron-hard, his hand sliding on the abundant lubrication of his precum. It was positively humiliating how completely his body had spun out of his control. He’d never leaked this much in his life. He could practically hear the slick squelch of his fist, dribbling more with each stroke of Sherlock’s cock inside him.
“It’s what couples do, isn’t it?” Sherlock wheedled. “Jeanette still has that photo from last Christmas up on her Facebook, and you never complained about that.”
He rolled his hips to see John shudder, to feel the tightness of his wet, slick hole fluttering around him.
When John opened his eyes the house had gone silent. His bedroom door was closed. Darkness all around him. The middle-of-the-night stillness that befell all living things; the silence of sleep.
There was something in the water with him, a thing of pallor and shadow. Its sleek dark head was small like a child’s, although Hazel knew that it was not a child. It was not human. Its skin was pale and milky, wet and gleaming in the moonlight -
“All the old Wizarding families know that the Holmes family tree has borne some rotten fruit. Or rather it’s grown from bad seeds. Or it’s rotten at its roots. I forget which it is that Da’s said. Anyway, point is, Holmeses are bad news. They’re all known for being brilliant, the whole lot of them, but weren’t a Holmes alive that wasn’t Sorted Slytherin. They’re sneaky. They know too much. It isn’t healthy. And…” Bill took a breath, pausing for dramatic effect, “Arawn Ilex was a Holmes. Or they’re related at least.”
“Is everything all right?” Victor asks.
“Because he looks like some stupid old dead wizard,” said John. “And he’s in Slytherin.”
“He was plenty visible when he was here with me earlier,” said John. “I’m also sure that he has better things to do than to watch you talk to me.”
Eyes squeezed shut. He could barely open them. When he did, looking at Sherlock was too much, made him feel even more; the dark blue intensity of his   (
“No,” said John, decisively.
resolved with violence--”
John's eyes are dark like the hue of the skies outside, and if Sherlock were more foolish, or if he wanted to sweetly lie, he might say that they, too, hold the stars of night. But stars are useless gaseous balls millions of miles away that hold no significance at all and so Sherlock says nothing. Later, in the backseat, he kisses John's eyes closed.
The absolute worst part was, of course, that if given the chance - he would have done it all over again. And
And then he kissed him.
On Monday, Sherlock ate alone at the Slytherin table. There were other students at the Slytherin table, of course, but they all seemed absorbed in talking to each other. Sherlock sat surrounded by people, and no one talked to him or even seemed to see him.
” mumbled Carl, not at all that word.
“I know you think this is all very amusing, Watson, but you need to listen to me,” Bill huffed. “I’m just telling you what everybody knows. Arawn Ilex was skilled in wandless Legilimency. He could look at you and in a second know everything about you, go all the way deep into your mind and discover all your secrets and your desires and secret desires. And even though you don’t believe me, everyone’s seen Sherlock do exactly that!”
“I tried it, but I didn’t get quite the same kick out of it as he did. Sherlock loved it. Absolutely fucking

“She’s the daughter of a minister,” John pointed out.

“Then I don't plan to stop,” Sherlock said. He pressed the shutter button again.
“One of my few marketable skills,” Victor says, and winks.
The colony of Roanoke, located in what is now known as Dare County, North Carolina, was one of the first settlements in the New World. On August 17, 1585, Sir Richard Grenville left Sir Ralph Lane and 107 men to establish a colony on the north end of Roanoke Island, promising to return the next April with more men and more supplies. The group built a small fort on the island.
didn’t want to kiss them!
Murder. Murder murder murder.
right where everyone can see.
“I’m fine, Sherlock, really, it’s okay!” John said, smiling to show that he wasn’t trying to be brave. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed suspiciously as if John were trying to get away with a terrible lie, but then he nodded and released him.
Sherlock with all the knowledge in the world like he’s holding out a shiny red apple, and just a little taste couldn’t hurt. Just one little taste like the forbidden touch of tongue inside his mouth. The rush in John’s body like running too close to the edge of the cliff, never knowing if the next step is fall or fly.
“Maybe,” Sherlock said, a little annoyed at being laughed at. He bit John’s scar, making John gasp, which, of course, made Sherlock feel a bit better.
“Do you still want me to delete the photos, John?” Sherlock asked him, words pressed to sticky, sweet skin. He marked the curve of John’s shoulder with a line of wet kisses, scraped his teeth over his collarbone.  His hand spread warm on John’s chest, rubbing and exploring. Index and middle finger found a nipple, grazing it delicately before he rolled it between his index finger and thumb.
“John, sit down. Have some tea,” not-Sherlock said, in an encouraging tone, and poured John a cup.
“Let me buy you another,” the stranger drawls, in a voice too close and rough in that same too-close way, so that it feels like stubble grazing over the back of John’s neck. John nods, smiles sure, playing at older - like the dregs of caramel liquid in his glass are whiskey and not cola.
“Why?” John asked, but he already suspected the answer. He felt his jaw tighten for a moment. “I don’t care about what people are saying.”
“No,” says Victor, “I mean, literally. He told me his name was Hunter Van Savage.” He blows on his cappucino to cool it. “So it’s our first year of uni, and I’m at this big party and this bloke comes up to me in this leather jacket with these Ray-ban sunglasses and stone-washed jeans that were so tight I thought he was going to sound like a soprano.”
“Maybe...maybe we can meet up at school?” John suggested. But he’d never seen Sherlock around school before, surely he would have noticed someone like

It seemed as though anything could happen, in the middle of the night...
Oh, yeah. John shivered. The wet touch of Sherlock’s tongue over his body was now graven into his muscle memory. God, the blissed-out look on Sherlock’s face as he had licked honey off John’s trembling stomach. He’d deliberately made his noises as obscene as possible, slurping and sucking and groaning with deep, thoroughly expressed pleasure, and he’d narrated the progress of John’s debauchery as he went, painting a picture with words of how John looked as he got increasingly flushed and damp and lost all physical restraint. Sherlock had reduced John to a writhing mess, just as promised, making high keening noises of such desperation that John couldn’t let himself think about it too much till he was in bed and could have a good wank.
Sherlock was looming over him, spreading him again, looking at him, hissing with satisfaction at what he’d done. John could see his face now, could see that predatory glint in his eyes and in the darkness, a slow spread of a smile, all gleaming

“What?” said Sherlock, looking at John, and then followed his line of sight. “Oh,
“Have you ever tried asking an adult about curfew before? I bet you have. And I bet they told you to wait until you were older. That you knew all that you needed to know.

You comb through the obituaries for anything out of the ordinary.
Its wet, white arms were wrapped tightly around her child.
Then John thought of tears on Mummy’s face, tears he had never seen before, as she called his name over and over, when he couldn’t answer her, could never answer her again.
“No,” John lied.
“But you
Instead John said, “I’m glad you came to visit. Where’s Sherlock?”
John wondered what he should  be looking for when he was looking for signs of The Evil. He suspected that he should catch Sherlock doing something horrible, like torturing puppies or something, but as far as he knew there were no puppies at Hogwarts. As for the other pets (

“It’s interesting,” coaxed John. “And Batman’s parents were
A documentary on cliff divers is running on BBC One, something that is far more amusing than it ought to be after half a bottle of scotch - Victor’s choice - shared between them. John finds himself comfortably leaned over, shoulder against Victor’s arm. Sometime during one of the commercial breaks, he looks up in the middle of an offhand comment about Pepsi versus Coke to find Victor watching him, eyes dark with an intent that tugs at something deep in his stomach. Unthinkingly, John licks his lips.
“That’s okay,” Victor says. His voice is low and almost kind. “I used to believe in God.”
. Sometimes he thought about them still -
“You had better delete those.”
“I assure you, Mr. Holmes, I am not trying to poison Mr. Watson,” Madam Pomfrey said, with such supreme calmness that John greatly admired her.
Sherlock threw himself face-down on the bed. “aaarrrgrghhhuuuuuffffff,” he said into the pillow, a sound of general frustration.
“Mummy,” said Harry, “Tell John to stop making up lies about things that he saw.”
Sally only laughed a little, quietly and not unkindly. “You’re an interesting one, John,” she said. “Who are you?”
“Yes,” said Hazel, for she was a reasonable woman. She did not mention the small, white hands and large, hollow eyes for the same reason.
John Watson hadn’t a wink of sleep the whole two weeks before school started. Every night he’d climb out of bed to sneak books out of his trunk to peruse them, marvelling at the illustrations, reading them by torchlight under the covers. He especially liked the Monster Book of Monsters, as it purred when he drifted off, and sometimes it liked to cuddle. As a result of his late-night study efforts, some nights he never even made the journey to his room. Sleep would claim him in inopportune locations: on the couch, on the table, on the floor; with his cheek on the page, drool sticking the latter to the former, and he’d have to be carried to bed, muttering and squeaking the dreamt-up words of spells the entire way. He’d insisted on wearing his robes at home, despite the heat of the material in those early autumn weeks, with summer still lingering on its edges. Robes were allowed. His wand, however, was kept locked away from him. There was a very strict no-wands-in-the-house-rule, which was a wise decision - probably the only thing that kept all the Watsons out of St. Mungo’s that summer.
The knocking didn’t come again, and John lay awake in bed for at least another hour, just to make sure.
“Ew!” cried Mike. “Double ew!”

There was a noise downstairs. Movement.
“Not yet.” Sherlock’s voice was sharp and authoritative. “If you come, we’ll have to start all over again, from the beginning.”
“It’s against the rules,” John said, “You know that.” He knew that. “You’re a stranger, I don’t know anything about you.”
The boy rolled his eyes. “Obviously. Do you think I’d still be here if I weren’t stuck?” He held out a small, wet hand. “Help me out.”
“Where are you taking me?” John heard himself ask.
Other nights John visited Sherlock at his home after his shift, his parents dead asleep and Sherlock usually working in the garage. Sherlock liked the company, even though he never said so. John liked to watch him work, and said so often.
“This will hurt,” Sherlock said, “But real quick, just for a moment.”
Tension stretched across John’s shoulders while he made tea, his neck prickling with the sensation of eyes upon him. Paranoia? The flat seemed empty, but John knew better, especially against this particular adversary.
“Sherlock was someone different when I first met him,” Victor says.
“Shh,” Sherlock shushed against his skin, and dropped a sweet kiss to the hollow of his throat. He looped the collar around John’s neck and slid the strap in place, tugging until it was snug before fastening it with the buckle.
“Very good, boys,” smiled Professor Hudson. “Now, who would like more tea?”
And when he finished, John said, “That was brilliant,” with applause in his voice, and Sherlock said, “Of course,” with perfect nonchalance, and turned away. It wasn’t until he set the violin down that he realised that he was smiling.
The October night rushed in, with its cool caress, the rich smell of wet fallen leaves. The crisp dark night with its smoke-whisps of clouds and all its stars. John shivered at the chill of the wind; his skin prickling with delicate goosebumps.
Maybe he was spending a little too much time around Bill.
“Touch.” Sherlock gasped, carried away by his own pleasure. The word was almost lost in their resounding groans when Sherlock drove into him with the full force of his body weight. “Touch yourself. I want to see you.”
John was panting, hands on Sherlock’s chest. “What gave me away?”
“Yeah!” Bill chimed in. “The

"Shut up, Bill," said Mike.
Sherlock slips a hand over John’s mouth, clamping down to feel his own name against his palm, the wet press of John’s open mouth against his skin.
"Good," John decides, and in an instant he's pulling Sherlock  towards him, over the gear shift. He mashes their lips together with no coordination, click of teeth colliding at first, but then he finds his way, licking at Sherlock's mouth and demonstrating what an expert study he is.
There was sand all over the house.
"I don't," Sherlock replies. "So let's cut outta here."
Sherlock was a treasure trove of useful information.
The cave was easy enough to get to, with only a few rocks to climb over, and John was very careful where the rocks were wet and slippery. At the entrance of the cave, the water was only up to his shins, warmed by the sun, and the sand did indeed squish delightfully between his toes.
tie. He’s going to pick out John’s outfit and fling it onto the bed at him, bark at him to get up and dressed and John will know that mostly Sherlock is cranky because he wants breakfast and there will be the smell of burnt toast in the air and if he stays in bed, if he keeps his eyes closed, Sherlock will come storming in, any minute now…
The sheets were cool, underneath the blankets, and it would be a few minutes before they would warm up again. His heart was still pounding, erratically. Nonsensically. It would be a few minutes more before it calmed down again.
When both wrists were fastened, John tested his strength, yanking hard so that the chains rattled, but it all held fast. His breathing was fast, pupils dilated at his own vulnerability.
He’s heard it since he was a child, and wondered why his mother forbade him from the windows at night, why she barricaded his bedroom door. He wondered why, when he asked about the ocean, he was always quickly shushed.
She is a nurse, by her hands: the nails clipped short indicating one who works in a manner of physical labor when the fashion of the day is to keep them long and painted, the dryness of the skin inevitable when one washes them repeatedly throughout the day. Her mention of shift work - what other profession would require a woman to work the night shift? Combined with their economic situation,  and John’s interest in medicine, it was all so obvious, the details lurid like the lack of ring on her finger.
And John says, after a moment, “...do you wanna get to second base with me?”
“I could have told you that,” Sherlock said to John. “You can tell by the way they twitch their noses.  Also, you should stay away from apricots, if you know what's good for you.”

Despite Bill’s not-really-reassuring statistics, he still felt that he was Gryffindor House’s Undesirable No. 1.
“Oh man, this is a great way to get out of service, Johnny boy, if only you could have done it before that ghastly sermon!” Harry said.
There was sand all over the house.
Hazel reached for the door, hand trembling.
He keyed in to the tune of John’s voice more than the actual words, the rise and the fall of it,  the rhythm, the pattern, the lull and the lilt of it.
It’s not the day of the trial, or any days before that, and John has to get up, eventually.
Mike lived close enough to the library. John could probably make it there before curfew. Maybe. But that was in the opposite direction.
“Whatever you like. Pretend the camera isn’t there. Relax. There’s no one here but me. And If you don’t like it, we can have a do-over.”
“When would I go home again?” John asked, slowly and carefully.
“EW!” Carl cried, yanking his hand back. “Professor Hudson! Did you hear
trying, made a grab at the Bubotuber and squeezed it so hard that it somehow managed to slip out of his hands and wriggle away from him. It squirmed wildly once it was free, as if performing a victory dance to mock John with its triumph.
No answer came.
“You can touch, if you like,” Sherlock said, noting John’s interest. John hoped he had not been staring. Mummy said that was a rude thing to do. But then again, if he hadn’t stared, then Sherlock would not have said it was okay to touch it.
“Well,” John says, after a moment, “The rent is paid up until the end of the month, at least.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John woke gasping, in tremors, shuddering with pleasure. It rolled through him in little waves, one after another, his stomach clenching, and he whimpered with his own release.
“Maybe, yeah,” said John, tilting his chin up. “Who cares about stupid nature?” He stood up and peeled off his moustache, slapping it down on the table.
He found the dog underneath the leafy shadows of some ferns. Being a boy of strong constitution, he did not yell or scream, although he did let out a singular gasp. He could taste the forest air in his mouth, the loamy scent of earth and rich pine.
“John,” she said. “You’re magnificent.”
They were silent for a few more moments. “There

“I’m awarding you twenty House points, for your display of courage in standing up for a fellow student. While I cannot condone the outcome, it was still quite brave of you,” Professor Hudson said, and smiled at him.
they will be....”
“Oh,” said John, taken aback. “Of course I knew that’s what you do...it’s just that I thought...”
"You don't want to be seen with me?" John asked, voice tremulous. He never thought that
John laughed. He couldn’t help it. “Like Schrodinger’s cat?”
"It's only a phase. Sherlock will settle down one day," his mother often says.
He dropped her off at home afterwards, walked her up to the front door. They stood on her doorstep, the porchlight left on for her although the house was dark and quiet.
Blood. There was a trickle of blood running down Jesus’ heavenly, handsome face, but that was impossible,
John couldn’t help but ask, “
John considered this. “Yes,” he said, “that I do,” and undid the next button, torturously slowly, smiling to himself.
People whispered about Sherlock when he walked through the halls. Sherlock pretended not to hear, but John knew that he did, because Sherlock’s hearing was sure to be very good. It was how he picked up clues. And even if Sherlock didn’t hear, John knew that he could look at you and he’d know exactly what you were thinking, and if you were talking about him.
“Why don’t you go find a seat at the Slytherin table?” hissed Athelney Jones, a dark-skinned fifth year boy with green eyes; the only thing John knew about him was that he was on the Quidditch team. And that he now hated John, apparently. “I’m sure you’d be welcome there.”
"Oh," John says. His eyes are wide. He places his hand in his lap and kneads his own thigh.
His first instinct was to run. But there was no way to outrun a car, that was silly. Not even if he dropped his bag and abandoned his bike.  And where would he go? Into the woods, that dark unknown? Or to a stranger’s house, banging on the door - a stranger himself? Why, they’d call the police! Even if they didn’t, they would not let him in, that was against the rules.
“Say your name, your whole name, and say ‘I agree to the contract,’” Sherlock said. “That’s a special thing you have to say. Oh! And you have to say, ‘I do it freely.’”
“I mean it,” Victor says. “Work hard, play hard, right? Except Sherlock never worked all that hard. He would get other people to do it for him. I was never quite sure how, since nobody liked him all that much. Blackmail comes to mind.”
“I had a wonderful time,” Sarah said, and John replied that so had he. He smiled at her, took both of her hands into his and squeezed them gently.
Later, they were all necessary.
Sherlock gasps, thrusts up harder at the feeling of John squirming helplessly upon his cock, fighting but not-fighting, rubs his dick inside of John in a way so
Sherlock smirked. “But you like it when I tell you what to do.”
“Sherlock!” John tried to chide. He was sure he was smiling too much for it to be taken seriously. The little giggle he had at the thought certainly didn’t help matters.
“John, are you up yet? It’s time for school!” Momma shouted up the stairs.
Sherlock’s lips were brushing against his ear, each word like a kiss, “You might not have the words for it, you might not know the mechanics of it, but there are things you feel, you

and with Mycroft’s name on it.
He spun her and dipped her. She gasped when he leaned in for the kiss, her cheeks flushing a pretty pink that brightened the rouge on her cheeks. He held it for just a second, kept it dry and chaste.
“Me either,” said Bill. “Do you think he’s dead?”
It was too much - too rough, too hard, too fast, too much. Pure sensation: not pleasure and not pain but rather some hot electric shock of feeling like all his nerves were exposed, his insides were exposed. Bucked on reflex, tried to pull away on reflex, wanted to struggle on instinct but he was pinned firmly in place, Sherlock above him and inside him and around him, the movements merciless.
“It’s perfectly acceptable to have companions that can’t talk back,” Sherlock declared, hair a bit wild when he turned around. “Those that talk back often waste the ability with the most inane speech, and they’re absolutely horrid company.”  John liked the way he talked, like how people spoke in books or in movies. He didn’t know anybody his age who talked the funny, proper way Sherlock did. Maybe it was because he’d been homeschooled. Sherlock opened up his hands and presented John with something of his own: a human skull.
At this moment Sherlock is down to the last cigarette of his pack, he has smoked it down to the filter, and he is pushing himself up off his car, his body vibrant with energy, illuminated, aflame.
“Tell me everything you know about murder,” said Sherlock, all in one excited breath.
Their bodies pressed close, then - and wanted closer still. They pressed against one another, hands and hearts entwined. Their breaths slowed and evened out together - rising, falling together - soft and sighing in the night.
John’s living room looks comparable to the set of
“Come step into my office,” she said.
“Because they’re
His father, and his endless wanderlust, his distant eyes always looking beyond the horizon, at something John could not see.
Sherlock pounded John into the bed, mattress creaking beneath them, bedframe rattling and chains shaking and bedside table shaking a bit too. He fucked him hard, like an animal rutting in heat, without thought, operating only on raw instinct, hormones and need. His orgasm was building up inside of him, curling up in the pit of his stomach, tugging at his balls, and it made him want more, like it was never enough, like he could never do this enough, never touch enough, never fuck John enough.
His eyes seemed to gleam in the dark.
“Oh, Harry, there you are!” a pretty Indian girl said as she stuck her head out of a compartment. “Come on, we’ve saved a spot for you!”
“We can’t,” John said, although the hitch in his breath betrayed him. He shook his head as if to clear it. “We’d never get anything done. We would starve to death. Who would make dinner?”
“Nobody knows,” said Molly.  Her voice hushed even further. “And there was this family in her neighborhood, the Smiths, who just up and vanished. All of them. The dad, the mom, their two kids, even the dog, all whisked away in the middle of the night. They didn’t say that they were going away.  Their car was still in the driveway. There was no sign of a break-in or nothing. The door was locked. But the really weird thing is that the lights in the house were still on and dinner was on the table, like they’d vanished in the middle of whatever they were doing. ”
On Friday, John did not follow Sherlock. Which was why, he supposed, that by the time he walked in, it was far too late.
John had spent his whole life up until that moment like a match unaware of its own purpose. Now he was lit, and the knowledge would consume him.
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes,” said the young man. “And you are?”
“No...not an animal. I don’t know what it was. It was like a child...but not. It was something else.” Hazel shook her head. “It sounds crazy, I know. And it was...touching him, Tom. I saw it.”
John shrugged, obviously unable to counter that argument. “I honestly thought you were bored, and it’s all been a sort of experiment.”
"Oh," says Sherlock, as if with epiphany. "Right here," he says, very lightly trailing his fingers over the obvious shape of John's erection through the layers of fabric. Very lightly he traces the shape of it, teasing, gentle brushes and suggestions of pressure, and then John gives a strangled little cry as he pushes his hips up and his whole body shudders hard as he comes with just that, the slightest touches from being so uncontrollably overstimulated.
Next to him, Harry was humming -
about him,” Bill continued. Bill, as John noted before, was very blasé about ghosts, while John still rubbed his arms up and down to try and get the goosebumps to go down.
