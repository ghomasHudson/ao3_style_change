“Ugh,” Lucifer makes a gagging sound from a corner of the room. “Aren’t you bored of this yet?”
Castiel blanches. “I have,” he replies, trying to keep his voice even. Of course he’s heard of the infamous Marquis. He’d heard of a great many dark and disturbing things when he was living in the capital. And because of the libertine lifestyle much of the aristocracy indulged in, most of the things he’d heard were of a sexual nature. De Sade’s writings had become a frequent topic since their recent publication. But Castiel hadn’t expected to hear such things out here in the country.
Then suddenly, he feels another sensation. The grip of another hand, clenching around his thigh.

, asking for help where Castiel cannot say No or turn him away?
Back in the capital it was, at times, problematic. The confessions he’d heard, the things he’d read… sometimes he had to go to such extremes of purification, it took many days to recover. It was part of the reason why he’d been sent to the countryside, in the hopes that a less stressful environment might improve his health. It has worked so far. He feels well-rested and mentally prepared to help with this particular sort of problem, although he’s never personally administered this kind of treatment to another before.
Dean hisses in sharply at that, and the way his pupils flare is definitely not a trick of the light. “No,” he answers breathlessly.
“I gotta get to the Guidance Office,” Dean explained. “I promised Moseley I’d submit my last elective by the end of the day. I’m already way late and if I push it anymore she’ll have my ass.”
Dean groaned, slapping his hand to his face.
“It’s good to see you, Missouri,” Castiel murmured, squeezing her tight.
Castiel caught the movement, his eyes flicking down to Dean’s mouth, and Dean cleared his throat uncomfortably, for what seemed like the millionth time trying to shake off the effect the other boy had on him.
“Yeah Cas, that was awesome!” Sam chimed in. Castiel’s mouth twitched as Sam used his nickname, giving the younger boy a fond smile.
Castiel frantically tries to hush him, afraid the sound will carry to the cottages nearby and wake his fellow priests. But Dean is so far gone he pays Castiel no heed, slack-jawed with pleasure and eyes glazed as he mindlessly writhes back onto the Discipline’s handle. In desperation, Castiel grabs onto Dean’s hair with his other hand, pulling Dean’s head back to thrust his cock into Dean’s mouth again.
"Hey Cas, are you gay?"
He hated running. But he’d tried the salads and the shakes, the detox diets, and even colonics… in the end it was just too much to ask for him to give up burgers and beer. And pie. Goddamn how Dean loved him some pie.
And wouldn’t you know, that’s when the DJ decided to play a slow number. Obviously, he’d heard Dean’s outburst too.
The feeling lasts all of a couple of days, before Dean is miserable and missing Cas something fierce. He starts listening to old phone messages just to hear Cas’ voice, starts reading through old texts, flipping through the folders and folders of pictures he’s taken… but when he gets to his videos, Dean is shocked to find a new one has been added without him knowing.
“Come back to me,” Castiel still murmurs, gently cradling Dean’s face even as Dean comes with the force of a freight-train, snarling with every snap of his hips, deep inside Castiel’s body.

Castiel’s knees finally give out, and he collapses back against the altar, sliding down until he lands on the floor, cock still hanging out of his pants, rosary defiled. He cannot even make a move to cover himself as he gasps to catch his breath, staring numbly at Dean in utter disbelief.

Dean cries out, the sound garbled in his throat by Castiel’s cock, and the vibration of it sends Castiel reeling again. “Stop, stop!” he gasps, still swinging the Discipline, but each strike only seems to spur Dean on, his moans thickening around Castiel’s length as he takes it even deeper.

Dean was halfway through explaining to Cas why the ’67 Impala was a far superior vehicle to the ’65 Mustang when the first warning bell went off. He cursed under his breath, realising he was going to have to cut short one of the most enjoyable lunch periods he’d had that didn’t involve making out with some girl in the janitor’s closest or sneaking off campus to get some pie down the road at BigGerson’s.

Castiel blinks in surprise at the voice that comes through the woven screen of his Confessional. There are few houses of wealth in the surrounding provinces, and of those, most that visit their small chapel are women. But this is a voice Castiel hasn’t heard before – deep, and rough around the edges, as many in the country are – but still too cultured to be anything other than aristocracy. Castiel tries not to reveal his surprise as he recites his blessing.
And somehow those few rumbled syllables seemed to calm Dean down immensely.
It’s dated the morning of Cas’ flight, the morning after he recorded his confession on Cas’ phone, and when Dean plays it he’s stunned to see his own sleeping face in the dim light of dawn. He hears Castiel sigh, then sees Cas’ slender fingers reach up into the frame, lightly tracing along his sleeping brow, down his nose, and across his cheek as Cas’ thumb brushes over his lips. It’s then that he’d stirred a little, mumbling Cas’ name in his sleep, and Dean cries out in horror as he watches. He didn’t even know he talked in his sleep!
“Of course,” Castiel nods, swallowing down a sudden dryness in his throat. “I hope you have managed to pass the day as I’ve advised?”

As the quarterback disappeared through the small crowd that had gathered around them, Castiel turned his death-glare onto the onlookers, quickly scattering them as well.
Even as a teenager, sex in the Impala had been no easy task, no matter how big the backseat was. And fitting two grown men, both over six feet tall, enthusiastically groping like teenagers while trying to get each other naked, was a feat of logistics no backseat was ever designed for. But while they’d never gotten to do this while they were in High School, it certainly wasn’t their first rodeo in Dean’s car, so they knew exactly how to manoeuvre around that limited space. They’d gotten it down to an art, right down to the lube and cleanup rag Dean permanently kept in the pouch behind the driver’s seat.

Dean sighed again, leaning back on his locker and shutting his eyes as if it would make the two girls go away. Not five minutes into his Senior year and the shit was already about to hit the fan. He had a vague notion that this might be a good chance to suggest a threesome, but quickly decided he wasn’t caffeinated enough to finesse that yet. Resigned, Dean opened his eyes, intent on finding another escape route-- when he was stopped dead in his tracks, transfixed by a pair of startling blue eyes, focused directly on him.

With his wrists tied the way they are, Dean is forced to lie back across the small altar, and he automatically lifts his legs to accommodate the position, planting his feet on the end of the altar to brace himself better. But the position also forces his legs to splay open, displaying himself for Castiel, and Castiel can’t help the pleased rumble that escapes his throat at the sight. He is so pleased by it, he picks the rest of the altar cloth up off the floor, tearing the remains into two last strips, slinging them under Dean’s knees and tying them to the hook as well, keeping Dean in that position.

But when Castiel walked towards him, as deliberately as he had on that first day of Senior year, stepping right into Dean’s personal space and transfixing him with the intensity of his stare, Dean felt as breathless as he had when he’d first seen those blue eyes, all those years ago.

But when Castiel finds himself transfixed by the naked planes of Dean’s shoulders, hypnotized by the subtle shift of muscle underneath and the long, sloping trail of his spine… Castiel wonders if helping Dean will count for anything if ultimately he cannot purge his own desires as well.

But when it finally runs clear Dean still doesn’t move, save for the trembling in his arms where he’s holding himself up against the shower wall.

For a moment, he considers strapping Dean again. It would be useless, though, Castiel knows. But as he fingers the little piece of leather in his pocket, he thinks perhaps it might be better to use it on himself instead. He is so

Until Cas finally catches him, that is. And having to explain what he’s doing is almost as embarrassing as the first time Cas found all those secret pictures of himself on Dean’s phone. But that had turned out alright in the end, and lucky for Dean, so does this.

In order to reach the hook, though, he has lean closely over Dean’s body, in between the inviting splay of those legs. And as he does, Dean strains up towards him, desperately trying to press himself against Castiel, to kiss his lips again. It is then that Castiel realizes how aroused he is, when he finds himself nudging – no –

It takes another moment for Castiel to shake himself out of his trance, moving to take their cups and leave them on the shelf before turning to the back of the room. Along the wall there, is the small altar Castiel and the other priests use to prepare their vessels and vestments for mass, though at the moment most of its surface has been cleared.

“I’m sorry,” Castiel apologized, his gaze boring into Dean as if he could make his remorse felt with his big blue eyes. Dean should’ve been used to that look, lord knows his brother Sam had turned it on him enough times over the years, but coming from Castiel he found he was no where near immune to it as he should be.

The man turns to where Castiel is coming out of their motel room, “Oh I think everyone within a 10 mile radius knows your name now.”
Dean starts to worry. He knows that look.
“Come away with me,” Dean whispers, still cradling Castiel’s cheek against his palm as he gazes down at Castiel. “We will start a new life together, in the colonies, you and I,” he says.
Dean squirms uncomfortably. This isn’t what he intended, but hey, children don’t always understand things straight away. It takes time, and experience, and a hell of a lot of guidance to learn how to deal with their newfound emotions and growing will.

“Yes, I know who Superman is. Just not in so much detail,” Castiel explained. “…And no one has ever made that comparison to my name before,” he added, shooting a small smile Dean’s way.
Nothing, however, could have quite prepared him for the first words out of Mr. Alastair's mouth.
” he whimpers, but again Ezekiel shushes him, taking control.
When all the beads are inside Dean’s body once more, Castiel begins to pull them out again. One by one. So very slowly. Every now and then pushing a few back inside, before pulling them out again. And all the while, he continues his strikes with the Discipline, all along the insides of Dean’s thighs, down to his bottom. He cannot strike Dean with as much force at this close distance, but as he plays with the beads in Dean’s anus, Castiel can read the success of his efforts written in the tight lines of Dean’s body, the wide-eyed and gasping shock on his face. Dean is in a
"Yes Dean." ...*eyeroll*
Castiel steels himself. When he turns again, he is prepared to keep his eyes politely trained away as much as he can… but he is stunned by the sight that greets him, frozen and unable to look away.
And when he finally musters the courage to look across the circle, Cas is blushing all the way to the tips of his ears, wringing his tiny hands in his lap.
“Well…” Castiel replied breathlessly, “There wouldn’t be any of that mind-blowing sex for one thing.”
“Eat sparingly before you return. And until then, spend the day in prayer. Recite the Our Father. Prepare yourself in mind and spirit so as to better purge the body of its desires.”
But it was this, or suffer the gym with all the other mindless beefcakes.
Castiel is impressed. The young Lord is taking to it very well. If Dean hadn’t told him otherwise, Castiel might not have even suspected this is his first time. Castiel begins to think that perhaps it will only take this one session to cure Dean of his affliction after all.

The flogger pushes in easily, the wood smooth like silk from years of handling, and Dean cries out, a wet gurgling sound around Castiel’s cock as his body arches and bucks at the penetration. Dean doesn’t even have the opportunity to catch his breath before Castiel begins to thrust the handle, renewing Dean’s cry before it even has the chance to abate, and before long Dean is wailing in one long continuous howl.
“Yes, beloved, I’m always here,” Michael replies, carefully taking Adam’s aged and fragile hand in his own.

And the fight for who gets to top Sam next begins all over again…
Hello Dean,
Dean is woken by the sound of curtains being yanked open, the glare of sunlight piercing mercilessly through his closed eyelids. Grabbing the pillow he was sleeping on he covers his face with a pitiful groan.
“No. I don’t.”
“Go back to sleep, Dean. I’ll watch over you.”
“What is,” Castiel asks, breathless and bewildered.

There was no need to speak as Dean opened Castiel up on his fingers. He knew what Castiel liked, knew how to read his reactions, knew when Cas was ready. And as he lined himself up and pushed in, Dean knew what angle Castiel wanted, knew how deep to thrust, and how agonizingly slow he needed to in order to make Castiel tremble and shake in his arms.

He considers deleting it and re-recording the whole thing, but he doesn’t think he’ll be able to get through it again. And he kind of knows that once he deletes it, he won’t even try. But he worries about it. All night. Until the worry finally tires him to sleep.

Judging by the way neither of the sisters weren’t clawing his eyes out on sight, they obviously hadn’t found out about each other yet.
A cold dread begins to press on Castiel at the thought of Dean’s leaving, sinking into the pit of his stomach and pressing on his lungs until he can’t seem to catch his breath.
“Okay,” the child replies, looking down at his feet. He begins to fidget, toeing and kicking at the grass with his shoe.

“One moment,” Castiel answers, leaving the Discipline on the chair as he stands to open the door. He doesn’t know what kind of man he expects to meet on the other side. Something of a brute maybe, from the tales young Samuel had shared with him – plain and oafish, for all their family’s good breeding.

They were head to head in points by the time the 10 second countdown began, and the screaming in the auditorium reached a fevered pitch as the last pancake launched their way. Dean jumped into the air with his pouch held out in perfect position to catch it, but the Meddie jumped just milliseconds after Dean, and the timing knocked him into Dean’s side, throwing Dean off-course. And as Dean went down, air whooshing out of his lungs, he saw the Meddie twist mid-air, the pancake landing squarely in the other player’s pouch.

At first, Cas merely laughs at him for being so adorable, which makes him bristle a little, because hey, he has his masculine pride to think of. But then Cas kisses the hell out of him, and says, “As if I could forget you. As if I haven’t sketched your face a million times from memory alone. As if I couldn’t sculpt an exact replica of your body blindfolded, with only my sense of touch to recreate you.”
“Hey there, big boy,” the twink coos, winking as he passes by.
“Ugh,” Castiel sighed, flopping face-down onto Dean's chest. “I regret the day I met you, Dean Winchester.”
“You too, angel,” she replied fondly.
But by the time Dean works up the nerve to raise his eyes, Benny’s gaze has already moved on, sweeping across Dean’s naked body with a grinning leer. “Yeah…
Dean grinned. He’d found his new home.
And perhaps it is Castiel’s mistake, but perhaps, if it had been with someone else, it wouldn’t have mattered. But when Castiel strikes Dean’s rear, the sound Dean makes then is… more than just a cry of pain. It’s also a whimper, a moan, and his entire body seems to shudder differently than before. The reaction makes something inside Castiel tremble as well, giving pause, and he finds himself breathless at it.

Castiel seemed to pick up on Dean’s mood, their kisses becoming less urgent and more soft, slow, something quieting between them as they took their time to really look at each other in between each press of their lips.
He jumps to his feet with a growl, throwing open the door of the Confessional and hurling himself out of it, nearly pulling the door on Dean’s side off its hinges in his haste open it. Dean yelps in surprise, hastily re-fastening his pants, but Castiel grabs Dean’s wrist away, dragging him to the antechamber with rough yanks on his arm. It’s well after mass, so the church is quiet and empty, but even if it wasn’t Castiel would not care. He is consumed with fury and fire, and it
He cannot.
Dean walked briskly through the abandoned warehouse to meet his CIA handler. He was late for his briefing at SN-6,
“Cas?”
Dean drew in a sharp breath at the sight. It was the first time Castiel had really laughed out loud during their conversation and Dean found himself liking it. A lot. So much so, that he found himself still staring long after Castiel’s laughs had subsided.
“Oh God,
much.”
“About what?” the other boy frowns, climbing up to sit on his windowsill.
“I’m here, Dean.
“Father Castiel?” Dean calls softly in the silence, and Castiel heaves a resigned sigh, unable to ignore the uncertainty and misery in Dean’s voice.
Dean blinked.
It takes a few more times before Dean comes back to himself again. Sometimes it takes less. Sometimes a lot more. Sometimes days. But Castiel stays with him, holding him, letting him take what he needs, waiting until Dean is ready to talk.
Dean turns back around. Somewhere above them a crow caws loudly, circling down through the air. As it lands on the grass behind the boy, Dean feels the ground begin to tremble beneath his feet. A rumbling sound, like a low-flying airplane, roils through the air, and as the ground shakes even harder the brightly colored structures of the playground begin to topple, one by one.
“Welcome to Terra Nova.”
Castiel sobs, openly now, unable to hold back any longer. If he is doomed to love Dean, to the eternal pits of Hell, then he is going to make damn well sure that Dean forever remembers the man who first took him. He begins thrusting harder, faster, grabbing onto Dean’s hips for desperate purchase. And as his movements become more forceful, Dean begins to thrash in his bonds again, straining to meet Castiel’s thrusts. His moans grow louder, building to a crescendo, until finally, Dean cries out, the Discipline tumbling from his lips as his climax overwhelms him.

Castiel is overcome.
“Cas you freakin’ child, you should’ve listened to me,” he whispers into the dark, reaching up to scrub away the… sleep… from his eyes.

“Okay, I do have something,” he said after a while. “I think I may have even used it at that party, but it’s short. It’s called ‘A Drinking Song,’” Castiel smirked.

Dean’s grin softened into an answering smile as he tilted Cas’ chin up, pressing their lips together again. It never got old, kissing Castiel, not even after ten years together. And he knew Cas never tired of it either, if the matching smile on Cas’ face when he finally pulled away was any indication.
Title: An Uncertain Future [part of the Channel Surfing series]
“I know the feeling, kid,” Dean mutters, scrubbing a hand over his face. The boy sniffles, tilting his head with a frown, and again, the gesture is... too familiar for comfort.
It’s dark when Dean near collapses through the door of his motel room, staggering towards the bathroom and leaving a trail that tells of death and destruction in his wake – a bag of weapons, soiled jackets, crusted thigh-holster, grimy knife, a ripped shirt, bloody bootprints – shedding the last pieces of himself on the ratty carpet floor as he forces his feet to carry him to the only source of light, slivering through the open crack of the bathroom door. He’s naked by the time he reaches the mirror over the sink, but he doesn’t recognize himself, can’t see past all the
“I dunno, Cas. I’m not really the brainy type.”
“Sure thing, boss,” Benny salutes. So he climbs up onto the bar, orders everyone to hold up their glasses, and shoots his load into their drinks.
He supposes it’s inevitable when Dean eventually seeks Confession again. But when he does, Castiel is stricken with despair at how readily he responds to the sound of Dean’s voice, haunted by the memory of Dean’s gasps and cries.
, he told himself, if he could get rid of those 15 pounds, he might come back and… “reward” himself.
Dean grabs it, his other hand still pumping his erection, and begins thrusting the handle in and out of his rear, fucking himself with it as Castiel did for him before. It doesn’t take long after that. Dean groans and writhes on the ground, silhouetted by the fireplace behind him, the light of it giving his skin an almost ethereal glow as his orgasm shudders through his body, splashing across his skin like a benediction.
“As you wish… Dean,” Castiel says, testing the name carefully on his tongue, and he wonders if the flutter he sees in Dean’s lashes then is just a trick of the candlelight. “Have you… ever been strapped?” he asks.
Dean barely held it together as Castiel left to prepare his order. And when Castiel handed Dean his pie, brushing his fingers against Dean’s when he handed it to him, Dean practically bolted out of the place.
“Wine comes in at the mouth

But instead of Dean’s cries becoming louder, as Castiel expected they would, they begin to lessen, until they are nothing more than breathy gasps in between the words of the familiar prayer.

Castiel groans, losing himself in it. He tries to clench his eyes shut against the sight of Dean, but of course, that doesn’t help either.

So his only recourse has been to start wearing a cilice – a chain of metal around his skin with prongs turned inward, strapped with enough pressure to cinch the flesh and create constant discomfort. If he moves too quickly or accidentally stumbles into something, the stab of pain teaches a fast, sharp lesson in constant vigilance.
“Dean?” Castiel tilted his head inquisitively, leaning forward as his blue eyes searched Dean’s face. Dean’s eyes shot down to Castiel’s lips as the other boy moved closer, and he found himself licking his own lips unconsciously as he stared.

And he wouldn’t go unless he could bring Dean.
Castiel heaves a quiet sigh. He hadn’t expected this, but it’s not as if he can turn this man away. It is his station to listen. To provide absolution. “Have no fear,” he replies soothingly. “Tell me, what makes you think this?”
“… You can has my cheeseburgur?” Cas-kitty offers.
“Cas,” he growled, “I need you in the backseat, right now.”
No problem Cas. It was the least I could do. I didn’t like the thought of you being there all alone while your sick, and I know a guy who can track down that kind of information. But don’t worry, I won’t abuse your privacy or anything again if you don’t want me to.
That is when Castiel realizes the state Dean is in – pupils blown dark, and the front of his breeches…
But again, what evil could stand the touch of a holy man? If that is what Castiel is anymore. How can he pretend purity when he has craved the touch of Dean’s skin? Known the pleasure of Dean’s mouth? How can a rosary be sanctified when it has been buried in the depths of Dean’s sinful body? And how can a church be sacred when the very air has been filled with Dean’s pleasured screams?
“It’s just… you had quite a reputation in High School,” Castiel hedged, chewing on his lip nervously.
“Hello Castiel, My name is Crowley,” the president introduced himself. “On behalf of the student council we’d like to welcome you to the school. Would you like to join us for lunch?” Crowley asked, giving Castiel a too smooth smile that marked him as having a bright future as a used car salesman. Or a dirty politician. Which he probably was already.
Castiel’s eyes fly open at that, and he is greeted by the sight of Dean kneeling between his legs, reaching behind himself and filling himself with his fingers, as his dark and dilated eyes beg Castiel for
The tremulous murmur of Dean’s prayer is broken with a gasping cry at the first sting of leather, the muscles under Dean’s skin rippling as they clench in shock, and Castiel is mortified to hear a similar gasping sound escape his lips at the sight. It’s a long moment before Castiel can compose himself enough to make another strike, and when he does he clenches his eyes shut, so as not to see the fine reactions of Dean’s body again.
“Cas,” Dean grits out, choking through the taste of entrails in his throat. “I need you.”
“Oh, I see. Dean? Do you want to watch the flashy box instead?” Cas-kitty asks.

Dean introduced Castiel to his baby with a loving caress across the shining metal of her hood. Castiel’s mouth merely twitched in amusement as Sam sighed in exasperation, but it was still a step up from when Kali had flat out refused to get in “that thing” last year. Dean did see a small gleam of something like appreciation, or respect, in Castiel’s eyes though, but it seemed to be aimed at

It’s just… he was pretty sure kangaroos didn’t love pancakes?
“Was that another Superman reference?” Castiel asked, narrowing his eyes at Dean as they sat down.
And as if his torment wasn’t already unbearable, Dean begins attending mass every Sunday. How is Castiel supposed to forget when Dean appears every week to remind him? Gazing up at him from where he kneels in the pews, lips moving gently around the words of a prayer, the pink of his tongue as he takes communion – every act, no matter how innocent, reminds Castiel of that night.
. Trust me, you want to.
And yet, though Castiel knows all this, he cannot bring himself to stop. Cannot even bring himself to move away or pick the Discipline up off the floor, as he so desperately should. He finds himself clutching at the rosary around his neck, as if it might give him strength. He clutches it so tight, he feels the beads
"...??!!"
Another thing Dean still regretted not doing with Cas in High School was taking him up to The Lane in the Impala. Well, it wasn’t so much of a ‘Lane’ as it was a field, really. A quiet, out of the way place where teenagers came to park and “look at the stars.”
Castiel stands back with a satisfied huff, surveying his work with a smirk. But as he leaves Dean there, squirming and whimpering helplessly on the altar, Castiel’s own aching hardness makes itself known again, throbbing insistently within the confines of his pants, and he finds his throat painfully dry.
But the second strike has momentum behind it now, and when it hits, Dean shouts, eyes flying wide at the impact.
Startled, Castiel crosses himself out of habit. “Very well,” he says once he has caught his breath. “There are some methods I know of that may help cure you of this affliction.”
Dean’s pretty sure Gabriel had something to do with the poo and farts bit.

in its reflection. But Cain’s Mark throbs angry and dark against his arm as he reaches out to turn the shower on.

His soul must remain clean, and pure.
A shocked cry punches out of Castiel at the brief, wet touch. His entire body freezes, hand stopped on his length, flogger hanging limply in mid-swing, eyes wide and unable to do anything but watch as Dean repeats the tease of his tongue, lapping at the arousal weeping from his slit. Then Dean opens his mouth, and sucks.

Cas ignores him, jumping the small distance from his roof to the roof below Dean’s window, and climbing into his room. Dean leans back out for a second to check the distance to the ground below and immediately pulls back, feeling sick.

“Oh,” Dean replied, a pleased flush creeping up his neck. Castiel stopped, turning to face Dean, and as those big blue eyes found him again Dean squirmed under the gaze, flushing all that harder and cursing himself for it.
It’s as if God has abandoned him.
“Oh,” Dean breathed, internally facepalming himself. Real smooth, Dean. “So… I guess I’ll see you around then?” he said, hoping it didn’t sound as overly hopeful as he thought it did.
Pairings: Lucifer/Michael/Adam
“For what?” he sputtered. Castiel glanced over at the door they had stopped in front of, ‘Guidance Office’ written in bold across it.
And what he sees is Dean falling back to the ground, in a mirror of Castiel’s position, chasing his own release. One hand flies over his cock as the other wanders the planes of his chest, searching out a dusky aureole to pinch and fondle with his fingers. And in between gasps Dean licks at his lips, tongue seeking out the smatter of come that’s dribbled down his chin.
And please remember that the use of the term 'Sadist' here loosely applies to any behavior/practices related to the Marquis de Sade's works. They were only first published in the 18th century, so the term 'masochism' did not exist yet.
“Good morning to you too,” Benny chuckles.
Sam turned to his brother as Dean’s cantankerous housekeeper Bobby disappeared back into the kitchen.
He doesn’t know what time it is exactly, but even in the dark of night he can still see the outline of Cas’ window, just across from his own. Some shuffling noises come from inside the other boy’s room, and then a moment later Cas’ sleepy face emerges, leaning over the sill.
The sun is just breaking over the horizon when Dean revs up the Impala again. He waits for the hover modifications to come online, then flies out of the motel’s hoverport, heading for the next town.
“Please face the altar. You may use it to brace yourself,” Castiel instructs.
“Why do I put up with you again?” Castiel sighed theatrically.
Dean lunges for him, grabbing him in his arms and crushing their faces together, gasping into Castiel’s mouth like it’s his only source of air. He’s gripping Cas too tightly to walk or move, so Castiel’s grace brings them to Dean’s bedside, and gravity does the rest of the work, toppling them to the sheets with Castiel naked beneath him. Dean pushes into him, rough and urgent, and Castiel has prepared for that too, already loose and wet – ready to give Dean whatever he needs.
He’s halfway to his car when the kid shouts after him.
Castiel’s smile trembled as his eyes filled up with emotion, and then he was pulling Dean into the Janitor’s closet with him.
“Yes,” Castiel replies without hesitation, to everything Dean promises. “Yes. Yes!” he repeats, over and over like a prayer, worshiping Dean’s skin with kisses from where he kneels at Dean’s feet. He does not care where they go, or what plans need to be made, he only needs to hear one thing, one promise above all…
Afterwards, Castiel’s body falls lax, like a puppet with its strings cut, and all he can do is lay there in a heap on the cold stone ground, watching the sight before him.

As they walked towards the Guidance Office, Dean found himself breathing a bit easier, the other boy’s eyes now turned ahead instead of pinned on him and turning him all kinds of stupid. But although it was a brief reprieve Dean still found himself furtively glancing at Castiel in the hopes of catching his eye again.
Dean cursed under his breath as the buzzer sounded, winded, wincing, and his pride wounded as he tried to manoeuvre himself back up in the bulky suit.
“Okay, if you don’t like ‘reckless’, I could use ‘
“Oh,” Dean replies, somewhat breathily, his cheeks reddening prettily with embarrassment. Again, Castiel finds himself grateful for the lack of powder that would have covered up the sight, and he has to force himself to look away, clearing his throat to break the long silence.
Snarling, Castiel rips himself away, only to be confronted with the sight of Dean’s entrance, open and grasping as he squirms his hips, begging to be filled. Grabbing the wine again, Castiel splashes it across the clenching pucker, as if he could douse the fire of its desire. But Dean only moans in response, his body collapsing at the sensation, limbs going lax as the cool liquid drips down his heated skin.

Castiel reaches down into the opening of his pants, unfastening the cilice from his thigh. Its pain has been long forgotten, lost in the pleasures of Dean’s body. Now, he no longer has need of it.

Castiel groans, thrusting deeper. “You are

He must take the Discipline to himself. Immediately. It is the only thing he knows to do when such a bodily reaction…
Dean breathed a sigh of relief as they neared the school’s main entrance, the noise and music from the gym quickly fading behind them, the cheap balloons and streamers already shrinking and falling off the walls, and Castiel’s whispered promise of something involving a French Maid’s costume ahead of him. But as they rounded the corner to the exit, Dean caught sight of one last monument from their time there.
Dean tries to pinpoint the source of the sound, but as it grows louder it seems to be coming from all around him, echoes reverberating from every direction. Then suddenly, abruptly, the sound is sucked up, vacuumed to a single point, where a child emerges from the trees.
He lurched to a stop on the sidewalk, his hands going to his sweatpant-covered knees to support himself as he bent over and tried to catch his breath.
‘Dinner Saturday?’ followed by a phone number, which with a shock Dean realised had to be Castiel’s.
And if he admitted it to himself, Dean had begun to enjoy these clandestine meetings with the CIA agent.
It was a bit eerie walking through the halls of their old High School again. Streamers and balloons were strung over everything in sight, the muted throb of music echoed through the corridors, leading them onwards to the Reunion in the gym – and yet the halls seemed strangely silent, empty without the noise and bustle of students roaming the halls. Even though they hadn’t been one of those students for years, being there again made the memories feel fresh, as if they’d been there just yesterday.
“We all are, kid,” Dean reassures gently. “But you’ll learn to deal with it,” he says, his hand going to the kid’s shoulder to soothe him. The child looks up at Dean then, and for the first time during their conversation the boy smiles.
He laughs and laughs, until his laughs turn to sobs. Until his chest begins to ache and tears stream down his face. Until Dean approaches him, carefully, cupping his face in his hands, and leaning down to kiss his lips.

With another growl, Castiel yanks his rosary off his neck, striding forward to stuff the beads into that sinful maw. They go in easily, all the way to the end of the cross, as if Dean had fingered himself open just before. With a start Castiel remembers Dean’s confession, realizing that’s exactly what he must have done, thinking of

He may only be a mechanic, but they still needed mechanics over there too. Or so Sam had said.

Some of the kids start whispering excitedly as they begin forming a giant circle around the gym, but Dean’s never heard of it. Cas would know. Cas knows all kinds of things.

And Dean doesn’t know what to say to that.
“Recite,” Castiel barks angrily, frustrated with himself for being so weak. For letting such base and sinful thoughts and desires run rampant within him. When he finally turns around again, he is prepared for the sight that greets him this time, and wastes no time resuming his strikes, punishing Dean’s newly exposed flesh for its temptations.

Summary:
of things he never got to do with Cas that Senior year, thinking their feelings were unrequited - and he was kind of hoping tonight might make up for it in some way. He’d even slow dance if Cas wanted to.
Pulling himself together, Castiel stands, smoothing his palms down the insides of Dean’s thighs as he steps between them. Dean’s whines become frantic when he feels Castiel lining up against him, thrusting his hips up to try and take him in his hole, still loose and dripping with wine and Castiel’s saliva. But Castiel forces himself to thrust slowly. So slowly. Taking in every agonizing sensation. He wants to remember every moment of this perfect ruination, carry it with him to the fires of Hell and hold it close for the rest of eternity.
” Dean wails, writhing around the beads.
Castiel follows the sound to its source, and his breath leaves him in shock at what he sees.
“What else was I supposed to call an 8-inch dildo? ‘Dean Junior’?” he smirked.
Decision made, he parts the robes of his cassock, undoing his pants to release his length. Dean’s eyes go wide at the sight of it, and as Castiel hastily straps himself, Dean’s mewls become frantic, his cock visibly twitching between his legs.
Castiel smiles again at the report, impressed by Dean’s forethought and dedication. “One drink to calm the nerves will not do any harm,” he replies, pouring Dean a cup from the bottle on the shelf. It is not a bad vintage. Probably not as rich as the wine Dean is accustomed to, but certainly better than the ceremonial wines used for mass.
“Do you want to go prowling? That always makes you happy.” Cas-kitty flicks his tail.
“He speaks with you about me?” Dean asks in surprise.
“Maybe you should. We could use a new Sheriff around town. Maybe then you could do something about the cafeteria food. Seriously, have you seen the kitchen? It’s like the friggin’ apocalypse went off in there!” Dean complained. Castiel laughed, his eyes lighting up with mirth and crinkling at the corners as he threw his head back with it.

“Dean…? Who is that guy climbing over your fence?”
He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised when Dean’s gasps become more frenzied, his voice thickening with heightened arousal under the onslaught. For a Sadist such as Dean, to have his bare bottom flogged, while simultaneously being prevented from reaching completion, it must be the sweetest of torments.
"Well Sam, let me tell you a secret about women’s hair: as long as you sort out the fringe first don’t worry too much about the rest. Besides, it’ll just get nasty again when you start banging the shit out of your drums."
“Was it all that bad?” he asked, searching Castiel’s face.
“Then just ask,” Cas smiled. “That’s all you’ve ever had to do,” he added softly.
With a groan, his lips close around that dribbling furl, tongue soothing that hot and swollen skin. He wants to drink from the chalice of Dean’s body forever, wants to kneel and worship every inch of his beautiful skin and fill his ears with nothing but the prayer of Dean’s rapturous moans. Why would God create such beauty, such joy, and call it evil? Why would He deny His children such bliss, charge them to resist? And if

Not even this man that Dean has fallen in love with.
But no, this time was about Castiel. So Dean took the option rarely used, and laid Castiel down across the backseat, positioning himself on top of him. It was easier getting Castiel’s pants off from there, and even though Dean didn’t need to take his own off all the way as well, he wanted to. Even though for him to do so still ended up with a bit of fumbling in that position, Dean didn’t want this to seem like a backseat quickie. He wanted to take his time laying Castiel out tonight, make it something memorable, something they’d been working towards since they first met each other all those years ago.
To answer your question, yes, I have people to look after me. My brother Lucifer drops in from time to time. Also, my landlady Meg is rather nosy and would notice if anything serious befell me.
“Dean,” Sam says admonishingly, taking pity on the ex-angel.
“Please remove your coat and vest, and then come here. You can leave your things on the chair beside you,” Castiel instructs, clearing away the last items on the altar and placing them in the closet nearby.
“I’ve never been away from my family for so long. I’m scared,” he says softly.
of sensation.
“Father?” Dean’s voice comes from behind him, scared and uncertain, and Castiel whirls around in rage.
Cas-kitty jumps down onto the seat, nestling into Dean-kitty’s other side and resting his head over Dean-kitty’s shoulders.
But then, Cas slowly raises his eyes to look at Dean, and gives him a small, hopeful smile.
Dean whirled away, his jaw clenching against the angry tears welling up in his eyes, blurring his view of the latest sketches covering the walls of Winchester Designs. He felt Castiel approach him from behind, the other man’s hand press hot and heavy against his shoulder, and then, finally, a single, defeated tear rolled down Dean’s cheek.
Watching-Dean however, begins to panic. He starts to wonder what the hell else he’s done in his sleep, just how much he’s revealed already. His groan of mortification is cut short though, when Cas begins to speak.
“Thanks a lot, Dean,” Cas deadpanned.
“Dean? What’s wrong?” Castiel asked, his attentive gaze quickly turning to concern.
They could probably make a fortune off the videos they shoot – Dean jacking himself off, Cas murmuring words of encouragement as he films and jacks off to it, then shoots all over Dean’s come-covered and sated body… Dean sucking Cas off until Cas comes all over his face, and then Dean coming with Cas’ fingers inside him… Dean riding Cas, leaning back and giving Cas and the camera a perfect view of his ass as he impales himself on Cas’ cock… One close-up of Cas’ dick thrusting into Dean from behind… And that one comes in handy pretty quick, because then they watch it while they’re still fucking, and Cas starts thrusting into him at the same time as on the video, and it blows Dean’s mind so hard that when he comes he nearly cracks the screen of Cas’ phone, he’s gripping it so tight.
“Are you serious? About helping me out?” he asked. Castiel’s eyes softened.
And yet, Cas always came back. Unfailingly. Over and over again. Until finally, one time, in the midst of his madness, Dean had kissed him.
“Yes, darling?” Balthazar asked, raising his head.
“Nah, you’re right. What’s High School without angst?”

But for all his brother’s teasing, apparently Dean making a friend was a bigger deal than he’d thought, because by the time Castiel appeared Sam was so flustered that the first thing he did was shoot his hand out awkwardly in greeting. Castiel raised an eyebrow at the formality of the gesture, but after a moment he stiffly reached out and shook Sam’s hand.
But the way Dean strains towards him, cock full and ready again, eyes pleading for more… Castiel is
But it didn’t get the response he was expecting. Instead, Castiel frowned, hand going to the back of his neck and rubbing it in that way Dean knew meant Cas was uncomfortable about something.

But then, while Balthazar was in between Sam’s legs, doing things with his mouth that had Sam panting and squirming in a mindless frenzy… Sam felt fingers. Fingers, brushing against a place… where he had never felt fingers before.
“Frequently,” Castiel replies, smiling.

“Wait, wait! I have one for you!” Dean gasped suddenly. Castiel stopped, looking up at him in curiosity.

“Like, Superman? You know, nerdy guy Clark Kent by day who turns out to be, well,
And in the next shaky breath, Cas is standing in front of him in the shower, gently pushing his hair out of his face and whispering, “I’m here.”

Dean’s heart clenched in his chest. It had never occurred to him how it’d affected Castiel when he was in there with whatever random girl he’d decided to fool around with at the time. And now that he knew, he felt like an absolute heel.
Dean takes a deep breath, nodding and doing what Castiel has commanded, leaning over to grip the stone edge of the altar.

A sob leaps into Castiel’s throat at the sound of Dean’s voice.
Castiel would like to hope that it is because the prayer has given Dean focus, that he has begun to transcend the punishment of his body – as Castiel sometimes experiences when he takes the Discipline to his own flesh. But as the prayer comes to an end, Castiel sees it is just the opposite. Dean is even more aroused than before.

How dare they make this look so effortless.

And when Castiel strikes Dean’s balls, drawn close and tight to his body, Dean’s cock jumps and twitches until Castiel cannot help but strike it

Dean winced as he straightened up, intent on escaping this evil boardwalk of temptation, but as he did so he saw the barista standing behind the cake counter, a small smirk on his ridiculously full lips, and his insanely blue eyes twinkling with humor as if he could read Dean’s every tortured thought.
He doesn’t go far though. He just props himself up on a pillow, and leans over, filming Cas sleeping peacefully beside him.
Even if Castiel is beyond redemption, Dean, at least, deserves a chance to be saved. A chance to cleanse this filthy taint from his immortal soul.
“Sam?” Dean asks, waving his hand in front of his brother’s stunned face.
“Of course,” Castiel replies, guiltily averting his eyes. He is not fast enough, though.

“Love at first sight actually,” Cas replied softly.
When Castiel’s mouth curled up into that shy smile again Dean finally realised it seemed to happen every time he used Cas’ nickname, and Dean found his own lips curving up in response.
Dean pauses before he writes his address down on the clipboard. A pair of large blue eyes and ridiculously full lips pop into his head and Dean grins, writing down 13 instead of 12. Two weeks later the hot guy from next door shows up with a handful of his mail.

He throws Dean into the antechamber before him, bolting the door shut before stalking towards the altar. “Undress!” he orders as he crosses the room, grabbing the half-empty bottle of ceremonial wine, and drinking from it with deep, desperate gulps. Then he grabs the edge of the altar cloth, and yanks, with one vicious pull, chalices and cups and cloths falling to the ground with a clatter.

Dean chokes in surprise, but it does the trick. While his moans are still loud in his throat, at least now the sound doesn’t escape past his lips, muffled by the meat of Castiel’s flesh. In fact, if possible, Dean’s moans become even

“Arms up,” he orders, removing the heavy cross above the altar and exposing the large hook used to hang it on the wall. Without a second thought he drops the cross on the remnants of the altar cloth, heaped on the floor, and ties the strips he’s torn off onto the hook. Dean raises his arms, wrists hand just below the hook, and Castiel ties the hanging ends of the strips to them, binding Dean to the wall.

“Seems like you’ve been saving my ass all day,” Dean said. And maybe he would be all year too, what with offering to help Dean with his Stats class. Dean remembered what Moseley said in the office earlier and thought, yeah, maybe Cas really was like a guardian angel or something.
Castiel chokes down another sob, reaching down to press against the cilice. But his aims errs, and he finds himself pressing between his legs instead, palming the aching hardness there.
But as soon as they stepped through the gym doors, what looked like an older Meg Masters stumbled up to them with a drunken swagger, just like she did ten years ago, the night he and Cas finally got together…
As soon as they made it back to Balthazar’s place they were grabbing at each other like pent-up teenagers, and Sam
. And even amidst his consternation, Castiel’s hand stubbornly manages to find a rhythm, enslaved by the sensation. Soon he is dripping his arousal, and it catches on his fingers, wetting the beads and smoothing their glide over his skin. He gasps and groans, throwing his head back and letting the sounds escape past his lips into the air, utterly helpless to stop them.
“But why?” Castiel asked, a hint of amusement in his eyes at Dean’s embarrassment.

Dean for the ugly lust he inspires.
Castiel quickly shoves his fist into his mouth, stifling his cry of pain as he presses hard on his thigh, the metal prongs of the cilice there digging into his skin.
Castiel’s eyes fly wide, startled at the touch. And when he looks down, he sees Dean kneeling before him, head tilted up towards him and lips parted to catch the drops of Castiel’s desire in his mouth – as if receiving the Eucharist during mass.
“But I do!” Castiel blurts out suddenly, his face reddening with embarrassment immediately afterwards.

This time was no exception. Except this time it became embarrassing for entirely different reasons. Because just as Dean was ready to go off, the door of the closet slammed open, and the room’s sole lightbulb flicked on, sending its glare all over the things they really shouldn’t have been doing in there. Dean cursed, scrambling to cover himself.

“My family wants me to go into accounting,” Castiel grinned. Dean laughed at that, it seemed to fit Cas perfectly.
When Castiel finally turned back around, his face had returned to normal. But when Dean still couldn’t stop gaping Castiel eventually reached out to grasp Dean’s shoulder, snapping him out of it.
As many in the country are, Dean is dressed simply, without the frills and powdered wigs typical of his high-class counterparts in the city. His dark blond hair is simply tied at the nape of his neck, the long strands curling naturally at the ends. There’s no sign of powder or rouge on his face either, and his skin glows with the warmth of many days spent in the sun, riding on horseback. And yet, his features are more delicate than many a noblewoman Castiel has seen – lips full and pink, eyelashes naturally curled to perfection, skin soft and smooth with lingering youth – even the freckles smattered across his nose are a testament to the beauty of youth, whereas most others would try to hide such blemishes under layers of powder.

“Yes, that’s it. Beautiful boy,” Michael murmurs into his ear. “Work for it. Ride me like you mean it.”
“Please take your position,” Castiel says, gesturing towards the small altar along the back of the room. Dean’s eyes widen minutely at the words, seemingly frozen for a moment, before he nods, hurrying towards the altar to brace himself.

And maybe he pouts a little too pretty when he says that, bats his eyelashes not-so-innocently, because the only warning he gets is a feral glint in Cas’ eye before he’s being tackled and hauled to bed.
“Yes, ma’am,” Castiel replied, tugging Dean out of the small room. Cas stopped at the door, though, to give the older woman a hug.
Dean was panting by the time Castiel released his lips, his hands fisted in Castiel’s lapels and his body plastered around the other man’s for any available contact.
Cas slapped his hands over his face. “Why didn’t I just throw that thing
“Aw I know, sugar,” Benny croons sympathetically, “That’s why I brought you some coffee.”

They have the kind of sex Sam’s never had before. The slow, deep, healing kind, that takes him apart and puts him back together again, whole like he’s never been before. The kind Sam thinks he won’t be able to live without, ever again.

“I…uh… “ Dean stammers, embarrassed. “Yeah,” he finally admits.

“Sam,” Dean growls, “Get out. Now.”
His flogger lies on the ground, not far away, and even as he reaches for it he doesn’t stop pumping himself, so far gone is he. But of course, if the Discipline has done little for him before, it is near pointless now, with Dean sprawled on the ground in front of him, naked and panting, come dripping down his thighs. Castiel doesn’t pull his strikes, but he barely feels them through the cloth of his cassock in any case, only the hot throbbing need of his cock, and the sweet slick friction it finds in his fist.
His hands are already pulling off his robes before he even makes the conscious decision to.

“K-Kevin Tran!” Sam finally stutters out, pointing at the retreating figure. “That was Kevin Tran!” he repeats, before turning to Dean and grabbing him by the shoulders. “Kevin Tran just winked at me!” Sam whimpers faintly, like the big girl that he is.
“But seriously, Dean. You never liked going to school, or any of the people in it. Why would you agree to come back here?” Castiel asked softly.
The pool is lake-sized now, waves dark and thrashing around the child, as if clawing for him. And then, impossibly, Dean sees a dock at the far end of the water, and he wants to tell the kid to go there, to run for safety, security… but then the dock implodes, splinters soaring through the air as the structure is sucked under, and Dean sobs, cries out again, “
it is a sin!”
Castiel reaches for Dean again, binding the cilice around Dean’s strong, naked thigh.
“What the hell is this, Cas?!” Dean barks, waving at the assortment of sex toys dumped out across Castiel’s bed – dildos and plugs and vibrators – and one huge,
Sometimes he wonders what his soul looks like now. If his true face is tainted, twisted like a demon’s.

“Please, come in,” Castiel says, stepping back to allow Dean entrance to the room.
Castiel takes a deep breath, clenching his fists until his fingernails pierce into the flesh of his palm, and the pain clears his head of such obscene thoughts. Dean may be young and beautiful, like no other Castiel has seen, but he is still to be treated with respect. Though Samuel may complain of his brother as many younger siblings do, he also loves and esteems his older brother, describing him as a loyal caretaker as well as a clever man, in many ways aside from book-learning, straightforward and true of heart in way that is sadly lacking in the current aristocracy.
“Yeah, that was all I had, sorry.”
“Cas,” Dean breathed quietly as he followed, spilling every last bit of himself into Castiel.
Still, Castiel cannot look away, utterly bewitched. When Dean’s fingers leave his chest to roam downwards, Castiel’s eyes follow every inch of their snaking trail across Dean’s skin, down to the turgid head of Dean’s cock, nearly purple with the need for completion. The leather strap Castiel had bound him with is gone, whether it has slipped off or Dean has removed it, Castiel does not know. But when Dean spreads his legs, Castiel sees what Dean’s really reaching for – the flogger, still embedded deep inside his body, which is clenching and squeezing around the handle with every squirming movement of his hips.
And then the flashlight went off, and he was looking into the bluest pair of eyes he’d ever seen.
“That won’t be necessary,” Castiel swallows, returning to the chair to pick up the Discipline, “You will feel this through your clothing.”
Dean squirmed uncomfortably when they pulled apart. “I would give you a hug too, Missouri, but that would be kind of awkward right now.”
“I mean, I’m
“And I did it -
“Let’s go,” Castiel said softly, and Dean nodded dumbly, following him to the car.
“Anything,” Dean shrugs.
“Anyway, how do you think I felt when I found out you’d been messing around with Mr. Happy all year?” he teased.
“Given the right conditions, the punishment of the flesh can be a powerful tool of cleansing and communion. In fact, I myself have experienced great joy and closeness to God through the Discipline. But it is the joy of penance. Perhaps, through proper exposure, we can purge the body of its inappropriate sexual desires and make way for true contrition and penitence,” Castiel explains.
It’s too much.
“…And?” Dean asked.
And so the inevitable. Too much time at work, too much pie in the hole, added up to a good 15 pounds at the waistline, with no signs of stopping. So as much as all he wanted to do when he got home was pop a beer, plop on the couch, and pass out, he now found himself dragging his limbs into a pair of sweatpants instead, forcing himself from the safe confines of his shiny, happy, apartment, and out into the deep dark misery that was night-jogging.
“The Prophecy…” Cas frowned, handing Dean a large piece of paper with a drawing on it. “It’s you.”
“Would it have? Really?” A disbelieving eyebrow was raised.
"We're in the men's bathroom, come in when you're done."

But when Sam makes him come like a freight-train, all over Dean’s shiny blond wig and pretty pink lips, it sure feels like a win/win for everyone.
And yet, all that is nothing compared to feel of Dean in his hands. He tries to be as quick as possible, but the hot weight of Dean’s hardness presses insistently against his palm, as if begging to be grasped. And though the feel of it scorches him, he cannot help but let his fingers linger, tracing the velvet of Dean’s skin around the leather under the pretence of testing the strap’s tightness.

Rhyming is hard,
His old tools are no longer of any use. The Discipline, the strap, his rosary, even prayer itself bears no respite, his thoughts entirely consumed with

between Dean’s legs, unable to resist the wanton invitation of Dean’s body.
Castiel clutches the beads of the rosary at that, once again in its rightful place around his neck. He had cleaned the rosary and the Discipline as best he could with soap and boiling holy water, though the urge to simply throw them into the flames was strong. But he just couldn’t bring himself to do it. Instead he often found himself staring at the objects, for long minutes at a time, pondering what it was in Dean that made him desire to seek pleasure with them.
Summary: Destiel...?
And that’s when Dean formulated a plan which would pretty much guarantee he spent as much time with Castiel over the next year as possible…
His only hope is that with time his memory of that night will fade, and the lust it inspires in him will lessen. He prays for the strength to endure until then, but even that comfort is tainted. He cannot find his rosary. Not since it fell from his fingers that night.
As the pain in his side began to recede Dean raised his head to take in his surroundings. He found himself in a kind of market area that he didn’t even know existed in his neighbourhood, lined with cafés and restaurants amid the odd bookshop or newsagency. It was nice, well-lit and welcoming, and Dean found he wasn’t the only jogger that favored this route as a few similarly attired men and women whooshed past him.
“What’s wrong?” Gabriel mouths at him from down the circle. Dean’s not surprised Gabe has noticed his mood. He’s usually the first to laugh at Gabe’s tricks, but not today. Dean glances at Cas, who is still stubbornly ignoring him, and shakes his head at Gabe, his scowl deepening.
PS - Nobody knows when Ion’s birthday is. He erased the information from Gabriel’s files.
Castiel didn’t reply, but after a second he peered through his fingers, revealing his eyes, crinkled with mirth. Dean leaned in, pulling Cas’ hands all the way down, and the other man was grinning widely underneath them.
“No problem, Sammy.” Dean shrugged as he turned towards the grand piano.
