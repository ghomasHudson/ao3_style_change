“Oh Sherlock, sweet thing, I have been holding back since we started out. If you want it you are going to get it, baby, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
“I’m quite sure you could have just said something to her. She will undoubtedly appreciate your change of style. Sarah has always wanted you back, John.”
“So...are Greg and Mycroft an item? Greg keeps starting to tell me, but leaves it at him going out with a man. Then there is nothing but silence.”
“Andrew Beckwith Sr. died last year. He had the sole custody of his son, who is his sole heir. He received a considerable inheritance, including the man’s make-up business, which is outstandingly lucrative. Andrew Jr. is a smart, bright young man, and a prosperous business man, but he is quite physically compromised by cerebral palsy. He can’t live independently, and although he has professionals that have been taking care of him for a long time, you have been feeling guilty and spending more and more time with him, reconstructing a relationship that dropped off when he was five, and you moved to the States. Lizbeth, those are the facts, right? Why would you think that Charlie, being a nurse, and a mother herself, would fail to accept Andrew, or fail to understand that a young woman felt ill equipped to deal with such a responsibility and moved away?”
Sherlock shared a cab with John and Watson, then went home himself, to find Harry Watson smoking against the doorframe, a large bag next to her. Without saying a word, he opened the door, gestured her in, and let her in his flat. She put the cigarette out.
John turned to Sherlock, astonished, to find the genius was no longer next to him, but sitting on the bench. John stepped towards him. “Did you hear what she said to us?” he asked.
Sherlock considered he had made good progress with doctor Quentin. He was able to talk about his cases, his interactions with Donovan and Harris and Stewart. They spent ten minutes talking about his interactions with Harris in particular, as the doctor asked many questions. He pointed out to Sherlock that Harris’ behaviors were flirtatious, while Stewart’s were not. Sherlock had paid little mind to it after he had told Harris he did not date coworkers (of sorts). Sherlock told Dr.Q about Watson’s ordeal, which had turned into a conversation about old memories and feelings about Mary.
Sherlock sent the recorded interviews to Donovan, who told him she would send Stewart to move the scientist to a secure location and retrieve the information, while she readied a team for action. Sherlock replied he was fine with it. Stewart arrived quickly and eagerly took over the memory stick and the scientist. Billy was happy, Sherlock was glowing. John was.... surprised.
Over in Edinburgh, John closed his eyes and rubbed his brow. This was going to be a shite storm. “Calm down Sherlock...it’s not really her fault, she doesn’t know you.”
“Little Bee, what you did tonight. It meant everything for me. I loved every second of it. That alone will sustain me, always. Your dad, he has this idea. I need to know, first. Anything you answer is good, Watson. I know little girls need mothers. It’s perfectly fine if you want one, but…,” by this point, Watson had looked around, her eyes settling on the papers on the little round table.
“Can I come with? I have my running shorts and trainers. We can catch breakfast later and I can, I don’t know, help with the case? Make calls? What do you say?”
There was nothing other than that little girl on the stage. A sun, bright in the darkness, shining and burning him. Her voice was the beacon that would ground him. Everything else could fail and fall away. This was the unbreakable bond. At the moment Sherlock did not need anything, anyone else. He felt a presence next to him, reminding him to breathe, a hand in his, far away.
“I hope so. I think he may still… anyway, don’t say anything about this to him. Please. Let’s just see what happens.”
“Let me know if you want me to drop Watson off here or if you want to go to Mrs. Hudson. It’s Sunday morning this time, right?”
“I will get myself into a more comfortable position for a good pounding, if you are so inclined,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock reacted by getting into John’s personal space. His face flushed with anger and breathing harshly. He might have looked menacing to anyone else, but John knew him too well. The genius was out of rude comebacks. “Answer please.” John asked.
When finally, people started congratulating them and trickling away, Mummy and Daddy taking their guests with them, the Wiggins, and the girls, The Watsons and the Stamfords stayed back to do the clean up with the wedding caterers, and the singer came over with his group to congratulate Sherlock.
“From what my friend, Dr Stamford told me, that would mean quite a loss for the well being of Queen and country.’
Quincy, the wedding singer, repeated the first two stances to give them some more time. Once that was finished, he sang “Love Me Like You Do”. John danced with Mummy Holmes and Sherlock had his first dance as Sherlock Watson-Holmes with Mrs Hudson, who was as happy as he was. Then he danced “A Thousand Years” with his Watson, switching partners, giving Rosie to John, who gave Mrs Hudson to Daddy, who gave Mummy to Sherlock.
John wondered again, why the obstination of not allowing him upstairs. Mrs. Hudson interrupted his thoughts.
“Hey, what’s the hurry? You’re still drunk, shouldn’t be alone on the streets. Stay, Rosie is at Mike’s, you can sleep in the room. I sleep on the couch anyway.”
Rosie had a box at 221B somewhere, with pictures from their wedding, an invitation, a swan napkin and pictures of mother with baby. Some other stuff, more than certain. Mary had rarely been a topic of conversation in her home with two dads. They took up all the space in her heart and in her mind. If she wanted a mother on mother’s day, she had Nana Hudson and Grandma Violet. She remembered being very little and asking Dad about how he met mom, and how they fell in love. That had eventually changed into her asking about Sherlock. It was only now, with this stupid little white notes, that she got to thinking about her jean mother, no genetic mother. Why would she have to worry about being like her?
They did make it in time, to the relief of the cab driver. Sherlock needed help up the stairs, and unerringly made it to the loo, as John turned on the telly, and put on tea. Rosie was safe and sound at Mike’s, with Mel and Pepsi. Sherlock made it out of the bathroom, still drunk, a little green, but more himself.
“Sherlock? I’m here. I’m here…” Love. He had wanted to say love. Then he sat next to him, put his hand on the back of his neck to stop him from hitting his head.
“Yeah, but that’s part of what got us in trouble in the first place. I won’t do anything that would affect what we are trying to rebuild. I do want to at least see what they’re up to though. I would love to try to implement it here."
by Itsallfine. It's an epic S4 fix it, lovely format, the boys working hard to be able to succeed as a couple. I remember following it as a wip and being so happy with each update!
Most of the preparations for the ceremony and the party were kept from Sherlock. He was happy that John had gone with doing it at their Sussex house. They had stayed over the weekend a couple of times, with Meghan. Now there were fairy lights hung all over and everything was decorated in camel, light blue, blue green, sliver gray and off white tulips.
“Shh Little Bee, everything is fine now. You were in no way responsible for what happened today. In no way. And if it was a dirty thing for the perpetrators to do, they are the filth, not you. They are in jail now. At Donovan’s tender mercy.”
“Nah, just been busy, with Rosie out for the summer and the private cases plus the ones for Yard. You remember how it is.”
Another dream that plagued him was of seeing Sherlock sitting in his chair, at Baker, a pool of blood at his feet, down his sleeves, streaming down his face. Lestrade, dressed as a doctor, trying to find the wounds, plasters in hand, telling John he wasn’t needed, that he could go. Sherlock greyfaced, his head tilted uncomfortably to the side,  the pupils of his beautiful eyes vastly unequally dilated, unresponsive to Johns calls, then screams, then cries.
The cases described in this story, will always be secondary to the men's story. Cases are only to highlight what they are to each other. For a story with a great case (There are many in this talented fandom), may I direct you to,
John had to admit the meeting had gone quite well. Mrs. Hudson occupied a central place on the tree, with Harry and Meghan, Mike and Bill as siblings of a sort, on his side. On Sherlock’s side, his parents, The Queen (how they had laughed at that!), Molly and Greg. Sherlock had delicately mentioned Mary and nearly had his head torn off with an emphatic “Nope!” Mike’s Melanie and Peggy (Whom Rosie called Pepsi, ever since she could talk) were labeled cousins.
Those hopes took a hit, when a couple of weeks later, John  tried, with no results, to find out if Sherlock could look after Rosie an extra night,  so he could take a night shift for a colleague who was going out of town. Even when using “Rosie”, Sherlock was not answering his texts. After several tries and with no patience left, he decided to call Greg. “Oi! Do you know if Sherlock is on a case? I’m texting him and getting no response. I wanted to see if he wanted to look after Rosie tonight, before I asked Mike. I have a shift to do.”
This did not have the desired effect. Sherlock’s leg was jump, jump, jumping. “Some people do not need infinite time to know that they have met the one they can not be without. They dated for a year, which you would have known had you observed Lestrade, or had any kind of conversation with me the last six months of our situation. They have lived together for three months. They are getting married, after giving it serious consideration. Mycroft wants Lestrade included in the family trust.” Sherlock had given up on the ice cream and thrown it in the can. He stayed farther from John than necessary. John thought for a moment about asking him how had he been supposed to ask him about his brother and Greg’s relationship, when Sherlock never spoke or answered him in the last six months without screaming, but he prudently closed his lips.
”) He noticed the bathroom shelves only contained Sherlock’s things, nothing else. He looked back at the bedroom and saw dust, the bed undisturbed, the closets almost empty. Sherlock saw him noticing. “I couldn’t sleep here, after- you left. I sleep in the daybed in the library."
“Nope, not dating anyone. Plenty of time for the cases. And for Sherlock.” he said, a bit alarmed at the force of the possessiveness that immediately took over, at this woman talking about Sherlock.
In the evening there was a formal dinner, hosted by the Holmes for the guests. Sherlock kept a low profile, sitting with Harry and Meghan, avoiding most of the out-of- town Holmes’ extended family.  The following day, the wedding participants had to rehearse, while the rest of the guests enjoyed different activities at the Castle grounds. Watson’s antics, making faces at her father, throwing fake rose petals at Pepsi, and giggling inappropriately, helped him get through.
John came in, looking worried and contrite, bringing with him medicine. He checked Rosie, confirming Sherlock’s deduction. John offered to take Rosie home. She responded with: “I am home, John”. And John had three pairs of eyes glaring at him. Sherlock never took his eyes away as he said to Mrs. Hudson, “Mrs Hudson, could you take Rosie upstairs? She needs to rest. Please make sure you take her to her room and close all the doors.”
Sherlock entered G R I M M and the box opened. Inside he found a saddle blanket enveloping … “John,” he called.
“Well John...he might just be trying to … move on, you know?  I mean, he looks alright, he’s using his words, trying to be social, he has a new haircut. He looks very handsome by the way, it really brings out his eyes…”
Thank you to all my lovely readers. You have no idea how much you have helped me these last couple of weeks.  I was surprised and grateful for all the positive comments about my OC! I love him too!
Finally, the cab made it close to the Convention Center. John opted for paying the driver and just running the last two blocks. There was a police line, and some officers standing guard. He approached the group of officers. “Excuse me, I’m looking for D.I. Lestrade? He asked me to come.”
“No, please, sweetheart, let me help. I’m here with you. I will always be. Let me make you feel good, Sherlock’. He tugged at the sheet, and Sherlock let him take it, still on his side. John took the flannel and cleaned him off carefully. Then he became a big spoon/octopus and tangled Sherlock’s legs with his. He kissed his neck as he carded his hair and pulled it a bit, got one hand under and around to touch his chest and belly, while the other caressed his legs. “I want you to feel loved. I want you to know I’ll stay with you.” He played with his bollocks, talking to him, saying how beautiful he was, how brilliant, then wet his hand and gave Sherlock’s cock the attention it was needing. It was hard and heavy, but not ready to come, while Sherlock’s breathing was fast and shallow and this forehead was sweaty.
“Let me introduce you to the forensic. She’s been friends with him for a while. I think I heard her mention he was coming around today. I believe she’s let him work in the morgue after hours.”
“Thank you John. We were lucky to have you. Vasquez refused to talk to D.I Harris. He talked to me, but I knew he wasn’t telling me everything. Want to come to the Yard with me?”
“Quite frankly, John, for a romantic your pessimism is worrying. Molly and Wiggins are doing fine, as you should note from the considerably expensive engagement ring. Besides he obviously adores her. She was distracted by trying to keep a secret from me, which only brought it more to my attention, though it is clear as day.”
“Mr Sherlock Watson-Holmes, it is such a pleasure to see you again, and in such a joyous occasion! My most sincere congratulations!”
“Invalidate? I will have you know, both Sherlock and I are MI5. We have collaborated in situations much more pressing and urgent than this!”
“You don’t understand! This is a surprise!! Sherlock hates surprises! This is a bad idea!!” Rosie fretted.
“Incorrect. Unless it’s about Watson, I’m not available until this case is closed. Married to my work.”
Sherlock’s phone shocked him out of his Mind Palace, where he had been researching the differences of orthodox vs non-orthodox jewish weddings for a case. As he reached for the phone, it quieted, but he received a text from John.
Downstairs again, Sherlock showed John the kitchen, double sinks, and bigger island in the middle, with four stools around it. They had a double refrigerator now. The shelves were big, and there were some portable step ladders to help smaller people reach the higher ones. The stove was also bigger and had an oven.
So John stayed still as Sherlock washed both their bodies. Sherlock seemed to be holding himself back, John however, could see the emotion in his eyes and the slight tremble in his hands. That made him want his lover even more.
“How are things going with the two of you? Do you still feel like you want to recapture what you had?” Beverly had listened to John agonise over Luther and Charlie.
John deduced the situation pretty easily. “Wow, I see there is love between the DI and you. Lestrade must be jealous.”
“Because you are my best friend. I wanted to make myself present and I would like to know about you, too. Nothing complicated, just a friendly talk.”
John left, not bothering to go back and tell Sarah, but concentrating on finding a cab. What had happened? John had noticed from the start how hard it was for Sherlock to ask for help. They had been bickering this morning, but in jest, John had seen Sherlock’s half smile as he left. Now his voice had been filled with sorrow, not the posh arrogance he affected when ordering John around. ‘I might get - get lost.’ Lost, back to the streets, back to the drugs. Not happening! In the taxi, in his distress, he thought to text Sarah, citing a family emergency.
Though he had a sense of having been cuddled to sleep, Sherlock woke up alone, smiling thinking of John, though one look around showed him this was not his flat. Still half asleep and disoriented, he looked at the bed he was in and how well he was tucked in, and felt despair, this was Luther’s bed. Being with John had, of course, been a dream. He buried his face in the pillow again, not wanting to think, but taking in a distinctive scent from the pillow next to him; there was also a strand of blond, gray hair. John’s!!
“No, John has not faltered. I will do my best, Molly. Fine, I will look for a suit, I guess. I will not match his clothes!”
“It’s just that you already reminded me of my husband. This is rather much though!” The man had a beautiful smile.
“Anyway, a look into his finances reveals no outstanding debt, no casino privileges, no serious health concerns. By all indicators a man with many reasons to live. Find out what the poison is, and compare it to the other suicide victims.”
“I suppose it could be considered retribution. I listened when you were afraid of having a setback while Meghan made up her mind about moving from the U.S to England to live with you.”
“Thank you so much, Dr. Sternbach, for helping him, and for telling me what happened. I neither accepted the position nor have a commute plan. I’m actually going to leave in a while. I do have one thing to tend to. If you are ever in London...”
They spent a very pleasant Saturday with Harry and Meg, visiting their very favorite Cardiff places. Meghan and Rosie made headbands to go with her new style and Harry made sure John knew what she thought about him and Sherlock. She had advised he fight to get him back. Pronto.
“I know it won’t. But I couldn’t actually kill the idiot, so at least I had my say, “ John said back.
Sherlock paced the room. “Yes. We first found out through their girl, Nyla, when she played with Watson at the park. Then Charlie, my friend, told me Lizbeth had come to talk with her. Charlie, Nyla and Andrew have met, and had a very positive start towards a possible relationship.” Charlie had run towards Sherlock, almost knocking him down in her hurry to hug him and thank him. The ladies were still tentative, in the talking stages, but the divorce procedures were in definite hiatus, and there had been conversations that revealed both women were interested in renovating their family.
John sighed. They had been doing so well. “Sherlock, yes there has been an offer…,” Sherlock stood up, to start walking. John caught up to pull him by the arm and Sherlock pulled it away, John got in front of him to try to stop him, Sherlock tried to push him aside. ‘He. Can’t. Leave. I. Will. Lose. Him.’  John’s frantic mind screamed. In desperation, he put his heel to Sherlock’s knee, bringing them both to the sandy ground. John tried to hold him down. Sherlock grappled.
“Sherlock. I believe we have gotten to know each other in these months of intense work. While initially, I believed your relationship with John endangered your *mental health and your independence, I have seen you make great strides in both areas. You have been doing well taking care of yourself, your journals reflect verbal interaction with the people around you and you have been able to take care of your daughter independently, after the time spent at Mycroft’s. I hope you feel you have proven to yourself you did make it through your dark times, as you called them. You did it for yourself and for your daughter, and now there is no doubt she will remain a presence in your life you are responsible for. You no longer need John Watson in your life. This is what is confusing you. You no longer need him, but if you still want him, you can attempt a new relationship. He is right about that, Sherlock. You set the pace.”
Luther looked shocked for a minute, then shook his head “That was incredible! Did you research me?” he smiled.
“Nah, you are only taking me home now because of the dance,” John teased. “I knew there was no way you were going to resist that blatant display of sheer sexiness.” He winked at Sherlock and they laughed together.
“You didn’t baby. You never pretended to want a relationship with me. This is a friendly arrangement. I will text you to see how you are feeling, ok? Don’t let it get to you.”
“Go, I’ll be fine.” Sherlock told him, while splayed out in John’s robe. “I’ll entertain myself reading your medical textbooks.”
John decided to give him space. He went through his email, and found an interesting proposal. His recent work with the veterans had been noted. The newly founded  Veteran’s Health Association was offering him a series of conferences that would prepare him for a senior post as an Advocate for Veteran Services and Resident practitioner in their newly completed Veteran’s institute. This would be quite a commute from London, especially if late nights turned into common occurrences. He couldn’t deny that he loved the idea of the job though. He was so lost in thought, he hadn’t looked at his phone for a while.
“Sherlock when did this happen? It’s not looking good at all! Was this that brawl you got into with the art robbery accomplices last week?”
“ I would say zero to minus five,” John answered, returning Sherlock’s smile and giggling.  Rather than walking around looking for something, Sherlock sacrificed his vest, cleaning first John, then himself and not having any other option than binning it in the tiny garbage basket under the desk.
John was also furious; with himself for having thought this would be easy and with the git for being well impossible. “Am I to understand you do not desire to continue being my partner? Are we back to co-parents?" He asked in the calmest voice he could muster.
“Dr John Watson.” said Sherlock grinning. “He is also my in-home doctor, so you need not worry about me, I’ll be taken care of.” The nurse’s cheeks turned red.
They signed the papers. John helped Sherlock get dressed and changed his own bloody vest for the new one. They got Sherlock's medicines and caught a cab to John’s flat. What would be their last night there. Once they were in, Sherlock in the bed, his protests ignored, they shared a cuppa, and Sherlock asked John to tell him his side of the story, and John obliged. He also told him about his encounter with Mycroft.
Ms.O’Keily called John, and Sherlock snatched the phone away from her. “John! This woman doesn’t know I’m Rosie’s Parent!! She says my name is not on the file! She says the beginning of the year papers are not the most current ones!  I can’t see Watson because of this stupid idiot!!
“Of course, you git, or I wouldn’t have said. Relax, have some tea with me. It’ll settle our stomachs.”
Sherlock covered his eyes against the visual of John fucking and holding him on their bed. Almost overwhelmed by the sensations, the sounds, and the smell of the two of them together. He moaned and writhed and shook with blind need. He had to come soon, to finish, or it would all be too much. He wanted to tell John, but his words had abandoned him.
The man threw himself back. Sherlock’s chest was instantly coloured red with blood; he fell to the floor, limp, dead?
“Use that brain and think, Lestrade! If there are no similarities in the place, or in victims, the killer must be using the same poison. Check for aeroplanes or aeroports in common, hair stylists, clinics. The killer is randomly selecting them, but they must have all come to him first. Think Lestrade, I would love to bet your team against me!” Sherlock seemed about to jump for excitement.
“He doesn’t answer my texts if they’re not about Rosie. And I’m not allowed upstairs at Baker Street. Can’t get around Mrs. Hudson, and Sherlock, well he hasn’t exactly invited me.” John complained.
“You see that as manipulating? Maybe there are some other issues at play for him? You told me he is on the spectrum?”
“Mary Watson was a persona she put on. I confess I almost liked her when met her, even given the circumstances. I knew there was more than what she wanted to let on when John was taken and put in the Guy Fawkes fire. I deduced her gaslighting and emotionally abusive tendencies from her actions, as the wedding drew near. I was, however, completely unprepared for her to shoot me.” They talked about the aftermath, Magnussen and A.J.
They gave the movie a try, though neither man was interested. Sherlock gave up, lowered the volume and turned to face John.
Sherlock looked, puzzled. “John. I can’t say I see a resemblance. Maybe his coat looks like my Belfast.”
“I once told you love, that you are the most human, human being I’ve ever known. You heard me. I meant it then and I still do. Let people love you. You deserve it Sherlock.”
John exercised what self control he had managed to accumulate through his therapy. Eyes closed, fists clenched he took deep breaths and reminded himself he actually could leave it at this, not engage further. He nodded at Donovan and left. John was sure of one thing. No more games. No manipulations. It was what it was.
“So it will be boring, is what you’re saying?” asked John, but the look Sherlock gave him showed him he was not forgiven for not going.
They walked towards Sherlock, and found him handing over the bubble machine to Mark’s dad and showing him how to use it. Rosie ran to talk to Jackson.
John turned to Sherlock. The man wouldn’t look at him, but said, “I planned this much before you left. It was to be- a peace offering. I was planning to show you the blueprints and sweep you and Rosie off your feet to Disney World in the US. Then we would live in one of the flats that Mycroft keeps for important visitors until the renovations were complete. The house next door was bought and remodeled to fit our needs. It was bought with money from the cases, John. I was going to show you that week, when I came back from the case. But by then we were so fed up, it all went up in flames. Everything was paid for, services were contracted. The only thing I gave back was the trip to Disney. Mrs.Hudson has a perfectly good sofa, and during the noisiest of the renovations, I paid for her to take her sister to Brighton.
And to my lovely readers, kudo givers and comment writers, I'm so thankful you are still reading on! You have been through most of the angst, now you will start getting the good stuff! You are cordially invited to the Mystrade Wedding! Come, enjoy the stag night with us too!!
“More like testing me! She said yes there were renovations. The two of them slept on Mrs. Hudson’s sofa for months. She likes her bigger room, and she has a room for her friends to stay over. Oh, and Sherlock doesn’t have to go out to do her clothes. Rosie said he does the laundry himself and I know that’s a lie, because he’s a lazy berk who couldn’t be arsed to move a finger. That child didn’t say a word about it to me until I realised what I was looking at and asked her if that was how  221B looked like now.” John took a breath. “Sherlock never told you, Molly?”
Sherlock felt a bit not good about going with Luther to this event, an orchestra night for charity the man had been invited to by some of the people he kept contact with. It was Friday, and Watson had stayed at Mrs Hudson, who had sent him on his “case” saying “she’ll be fine!” Though Watson didn’t look fine, she looked upset he had chosen to take this “case”. But Luther had asked, and it had been so long since Sherlock had heard a live orchestra playing classical music, in agreeable company, that he had been looking forward to it since last week. Tonight, Luther was looking great, charcoal suit and waistcoat and blue shirt. Sherlock had his black suit on with his white shirt.
“Cooking…” John said, smirking, “... that thing people do to have something hot to eat. Those of us who like to eat, that is.”
John ended the call and turned the phone off. He put the package in a carrier bag, and went to meet Sherlock, calling him as he rode in the cab.
-Taking care of her is not a problem! The issue we are having is that she has a tear on her trainer. She caught it on that horrible counter corner at your place when you two were hurrying out. Her foot is unharmed. SH
Rosie and Mrs Hudson came back on the same day, both overjoyed with the news, both so happy to see them back together and resume being the Baker Street family they were meant to be.
Out of options, and with no way to communicate with Sherlock, John had to continue to go on with his life.   However, he learned distance and silence really did make the heart grow fonder. It wasn’t easy to be broken up, and moved out, when your ex-partner was ignoring you, and maybe even moving on without you. Ex partner. John found himself thinking about Sherlock constantly, what was he doing, was he taking care of himself, would he ever see him again. The possibility of their fight being the last time they talked, made him want to break down.
He took a minute to breathe, and went on, “...about the ‘partner’ bit… Sherlock, I screwed up in many ways when we were together. I’m just realising lots of the things that were so not good; we weren’t just friends, even best friends. We were life partners. I should have always introduced you as such, to everyone. I was a coward. I guess I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of knowing we are broken up, not when I don’t feel that things are over between us.”
Bill was still and quiet, waiting to see how he would respond. John  was livid; “Yeah, I was married, and damn miserable until I wasn’t. Sherlock didn’t try to turn me. I’m bisexual. And I didn’t just ‘run around’ with him. I slept with him. I lived with him. He was my partner for seven years. Which is longer than any bloody relationship you’ve ever had, excluding the one with your hand.” They finished up and had the practice rides on the sled. When they were done, John stood up. Captain Watson in place. “I give zero shits about what you think of me. You. Do. Not talk about Sherlock ever again, or refer to anyone as a ‘faggot’ in my presence.” With Bill at John’s right, the Wells bloke was out of options. “Got it” he said, looking at the ground.
“Cocaine, John. Lestrade won’t let me work cases unless I’m clean, and Mrs Hudson prefers tenants that are not junkies.”
It was Lizbeth’s turn to get up and pace; “Because it’s unforgivable! I left my child, my disabled child and ran away to the U.S. I worked at the family business and made quite a lot of money, none that I gave to Andrew. I met Charlie and started falling for her, and couldn’t tell her. We had a baby!! Charlie trusted me enough to have my baby growing inside her, while all the time I’m a woman who abandoned the child that needed her! When we came back I went to see him and that was it. His father had just passed away, he was left in charge of the business and his stress levels were affecting his health, I’ve seen numerous doctors and therapists so they could work with him. Throughout it all, Andy has been nothing but loving and understanding. His dad was 20 years older than me, he died in a car accident. Andy says his dad never spoke badly of me, that he taught him to give me a chance. He even wants to meet Nyla, but I don’t know what to do! I only know I couldn't’ ask Charlie to accept it. I’m not the kind of person she deserves!!”
“Are you alright, love?” he asked when Sherlock emerged in clean clothes and smelling fresh, to get in bed next to him.
Sherlock tried hard to keep up. His mind kept thinking about the same old thing. John, John, John. Wishing he had gone for that pizza, knowing full well it would have never ended there. This time, he would have left John’s phone well alone, and nothing on earth would have made him leave. Not good, not good. Luther had taken him to a nice cozy restaurant, where he had a full meal, but Sherlock had just asked for a grilled shrimp salad. He talked with Luther about the security procedures Lestrade was working with for the Parliament and about international travelling, the differences between the U.K and the U.S.
Sherlock was looking at the floor, and his fingers were drum, drum, drumming on his thigh. He took a deep breath, “Incidentally John, I have a couple of questions for you: First, why did you hit him? You know I’m used to being called all sorts of epithets, it never bothers me. Second, why did you call me your ‘partner’? You broke up with me. Besides, you never called me that to begin with. I was always your ‘best friend’.”
Sherlock ran down the stairs, barely looking at John, to pluck her out of his arms. He swung her around and threw her in the air, before hugging her tight, his nose on her neck tickling her; “Hello little Watson! Do you know how much I have missed you?” He asked as he playfully poked her belly. Rosie squeaked and laughed out loud. “I have surprises for you” he said as he took her upstairs and presented her with connecting building blocks, alphabet stencils, a busy book, and a plush dragonfly, to go with Little Bee.
John put his forehead to Sherlock’s chest. He grabbed on to the flaps of his jacket. Deep breath in, he asked  without looking up, “Please Sherlock, will you take me back? Will you - Will you take me home?”
Sherlock raised his glass and clinked John with it. “To my Dearest, because I was homeless until he came back to me. We are home now.” They drank.
“She’ll be alright with almost anything if you get her to help prepare it. There are few things she objects to, such as Brussel sprouts, cooked carrots and beans on toast. Just remember to present her small portions. Other than that, you should be fine. Is she staying with you tonight?”
Even an ardent reader like me, in fandom for almost four years may still discover "new to me" authors and stories. Today I recc
“No. As a matter of fact, he is leaving the day after tomorrow. He talked about meeting us in Nice, but I have to say, I’m not in the mood to go.”
“No. He is very understanding and supportive of her. He always answers, even if it’s to say he will talk to her properly later.”
“Dr Watson, good to finally meet you, Dr Sawyer has a lot to say about you.” Molly said with a smile that did not reach her eyes, her handshake weak and cold. “So you are his new flatmate? Odd, he didn’t say anything about that to me, just wanted to check out that suicide victim.” She looked John over, not particularly in a nice way.
Harry picked up the mood in an instant when her niece, sunny and chatty on skype, was sulking more than the git himself. Rosie did say hello. They liked each other. When they got in the car, as John put their things in the back, she asked for Harry’s phone. She wrote a quick text message and gave the phone back. Harry needed to have a long detailed chat with her brother.
“It’s me John…” said Sherlock and his voice was all wrong. It immediately made John’s heart heavy and he felt chilled.
Then John brought up the trip to Cardiff and how Rosie had liked the city. Immediately, he noticed how Sherlock stiffened up, and practically stopped looking at him. His ex’s body language now clearly signaled “stay on your side”. John noticed Sherlock’s thumb touching the tips of each finger, as if he were plucking the violin strings, his old tell.
Sherlock had made up his mind to visit Rosie’s school, interview her teachers and access her student account the next day. However, Donovan appeared at his door the next morning with news that three more homeless men were reported missing. These men were again younger than the initial veterans and apparently drug addicts. Sherlock and Stewart looked for them, found one dead and two barely alive. Sherlock worked their blood samples and interviewed some of his homeless network, to piece the story together.
So John looked at his husband, older than the man he met at Bart’s, wiser than the friend he had at Baskerville, more human than the man who had let him go. Still, he was the most beautiful person John had ever met.. Sherlock, here, laid out for him, was all he ever really wanted. He kissed him once more, and entered him like his husband liked it, all the way to the hilt first, then some rhythmic thrusting. “There’s no one else here love, you can let go”
“Try? It’s not that hard, you git. We can find lots of things to talk about.” said John, making his voice sound light.
John smiled and did his Sherlock impersonation: “Tell Sholto that South America is a surprisingly good option to settle down in. Most people take education seriously and are excellent professionals. He can also have some advantages being an immigrant as he is a volunteer of much experience. He must be careful about overindulging with liquor as it can be surprisingly strong and easy to obtain. Also, Argentina has a precedent of conducting gay marriages even earlier than the U.S, so there is less stigma, at least for foreigners.”
“We have talked about some of the misunderstandings that led to our separation. Some of my behaviours were addressed. John recognized some of his behaviours were not good, and also that he had been surprised when I told him he could go if he wanted to.”
Sherlock tried, he did. This was his “ex”, the one who left. The one who “couldn’t take it (him) anymore”. He knew tomorrow he would go home alone. That is what “broken up” meant. John had been kind enough, not leaving him alone to deal with his excesses. Sherlock had basked in John’s keen attention during the party. He took in the experience of being in John’s home, alone with him. He participated and listened to the conversation. In the end, he was overwhelmed. There he was, the person that still meant more to him than anyone, so bloody handsome, looking at him with kindness and maybe something more. His hands, right there, his gorgeous eyes, made Sherlock cease to understand what John was saying now. He just knew John was close enough for Sherlock to take in his scent, and oh, did he smell like longing, and love, and home. It was all Sherlock could do to tuck his hands under his thighs, and try to breathe, to keep himself from pouncing on John. He wanted so much, so bad.
-Very well then. Would you like to meet up tomorrow? We could take the ladies to Speedy’s for breakfast and then to the park. SH
*Wiggins managed to talk to an old professor of his, Dave Sping and take a peek of the list of researchers, instead of having the whole research department taken over by Scotland Yard. An ICTM researcher could not have an operation like the one killing the veterans. The research team, which was conducting translational research on autoimmune diseases, had signed confidentiality contracts.
They got together quietly, each undressing the other, kissing, getting in bed, touching and licking and kissing languorously. John kissed him lovingly. They had had make up sex, needy rough sex, playful, acrobatic sex that left them both panting and sweaty (and sore the next day, they were fit, but far from 20, even 30). This, though, this called for love, for savoring, for a deeper connection.
Sherlock said it with such drama and flair, Rosie couldn’t help herself, spit out some pastry and laughed her head off at the idea of her dads physically pushing and pulling Mycroft around, wearing a crown. The absolute best part was that her dads looked at her in surprise, then looked at each other and burst out laughing, too. For a moment there, they were themselves, like it had been before The. Cold. War.
John went over to him. He had changed out of his suit, and was back to wearing his old jeans and that white way too big t-shirt he had on when he first saw him. Sherlock had discovered John’s trunk, and was sitting cris-cross with it in front of him. He had been going through his documents, and passport. Now, he was looking through John’ army pictures.
“I did not deduce. That would have meant I thought about… your dating life. I was merely informed of the situation.” he answered.
The thought of Sherlock watching gay porn, and opening himself up in the shower, made most of his blood rush south, and he had to breath against the dizziness. “How should we do it then love?” John asked, and Sherlock turned around, lay on his back. John sat between Sherlock’s open legs and kissed his thigh, making Sherlock tremble. He slicked his hands with lube, blew on his hands to warm it up. Then he engaged one hand in caressing Sherlock’s perineal area, rubbing with just the right pressure. The other hand gently introduced a finger through the rim of flesh that he indeed found had been opened somewhat.
That Sherlock said that, aloud and so transparently stated hurt John’s heart. He couldn’t answer. He just breathed. Of course, they were not just friends. But Sherlock was so careful these days, so reserved. If John asked him to give their relationship one more try now, he would just say no. So John was going back to the start, trying to find a way to deserve him.
“Yes of course, Mr Holmes. Yours is not the only student we have with security concerns. The security guards went through the footage, and all the children that left early today were clearly seen, with their respective parents.”
Then they went to his flat and stayed outside on the balcony standing against the rails, smoking Cuban cigars and looking at the city. Sherlock noticed Luther was waiting for him to make the first move, so he put out the cigar and slipped under the circle of his arms.
“Not extraordinary, simply the result of focusing one’s mind. Any idiot could do it.” Sherlock hissed.
“Doctor, there is a vast difference between my relationship with Luther and that with John. Luther and I were clear from the start. Friends ‘with benefits’. He is here temporarily and doesn’t want a relationship. I wanted to know I could be found attractive and function with someone else. I can. Luther and I share sex, friendship and company and that is it. While the sex is satisfactory, there is nothing else there. With John there is so much more. The experience itself is more, there are other sensations with him, more warmth, comfort…”
Sherlock stepped away from the music to have a forbidden cigarette. He saw another smoker, and was about to move away, but:
Sherlock was decidedly in a strop. This case was prolonging itself, more people were disappearing, and Donovan would have no alternative but to close the case, due to lack of concrete evidence. Even with Harris and John looking out for any kind of clue, Sherlock simply wasn’t concentrated enough to make the connections. There had been other, interesting, urgent cases, he took care of.
Sherlock was in awe. He retrieved the suit, and really looked at it for the first time. Molly had helped him pick the off white jacket and the white shirt. Light grey trousers. There was a deep blue green bow tie, and matching blue green socks, and a pair of gray shoes. He held the shoes in his hands, surprised; Dad just smiled and said “Mycroft”. He put the clothes on, with Daddy helping him with the cuffs, placing some of his own cuff links on them. He helped Sherlock put the bow tie on. Then Daddy looked at him, and his eyes filled with moisture. “You look so handsome, my boy.”
A bit angsty, this chapter. A bit more to come. They men are together and fine, though, and will have, as promised, their happy ending! Songs for this story on the
“Were all your guests there? Everyone present knew you guys are together again, right? Even the owner of the restaurant knew you as a couple.” Beverly stated.
As he got in the cab, John looked at his phone and found the problem. Harry had set unknown numbers to hidden. He now saw texts from one number.
He took John’s hand and carelessly opened the door, almost hitting D.I. Harris with it. The poor man’s eyes grew wide when he saw them.
When they got to Mycroft’s he greeted her warmly, and showed her what would be her room. When she asked for Sherlock, Mycroft told her he was resting, he hadn’t felt well all week. After tea, for which Mycroft had given her the most delicious chocolate dipped biscuits, Sherlock finally appeared, and Rosie almost fell out of her chair  in her hurry to get at him and hug him. He smelled as if he had just taken a shower, like lavender and home. He hugged back and sat down on the living room couch with her on his lap.
“I wish I could tell you I was only protecting our privacy, but I have to admit, I was being an arse. It was never you, Sherlock. I never doubted my love for you, I’ve always wanted you. I’m the idiot. I preferred that my army mates didn’t know I was in a relationship with a man. Murray knew, as well as Darcy, but some of the other men were really idiots about same sex relationships. I don’t know why I held back. I needed to see you slipping away, another man leading you away from me, happily holding your hand in front of Queen and Country, to wake up.”
“I wasn’t aware I had called out to John while Luther and I were, intimate. He kept it to himself. This time, I suppose it happened because John came to the party. We hadn’t seen each other in over two months. He was very friendly and open with me. He seemed to want to be close.”
…” Sherlock was reaching out, calling his ex-lover of over a decade ago. (Adrian help me...Look! She...killed me! Help me...don’t leave!)
“John does not drink, except for some beer when he goes out with Lestrade. We argued, but he never fought physically!” Sherlock insisted.
“You should talk to her, sort all this out and allow her to make an informed choice. Don’t let her go thinking these last couple of years, she wasn’t loved.” said Sherlock. "Also, consider Nyla. Doesn’t she have the right to know she has a half-brother? Does Andrew deserve to be kept as a secret? Something to be ashamed of? I am not going to expose you, Lizbeth. It is not my place. Charlie needs answers though. As is, she is stuck thinking you left her because your family hated her and wants you married to a man. She is convinced all those doctors and therapists you have invited to dinner to review Andy’s treatment, were dates. Charlie thinks you stopped loving her because she’s a woman, and you only go to her when you're between men. Does she deserve to think that?” The men left her with that question to ponder.
“That may be, Dr. Watson, however you can not tell me there isn’t some truth to that lie. The position has been offered to you and you have considered it enough to create a commute plan.”
“After your divorce, you  had an affair with a man that didn’t quite work out. It ended and you decided to travel. You have had some one-nighters with men, but you haven't liked that much.”
Sherlock paled when he finished reading and placed the letter in an evidence bag, then offered it to John. As Lestrade walked in, Sherlock said, “I believe these shoes are a souvenir Moriarty kept from a crime he committed. He did not steal the shoes to use them, as they are in almost pristine condition. Therefore, he committed a crime against the shoes’ owner. In order for him to keep the shoes, he most likely killed him. I say 'him', because the model seems one for boys, that were in fashion some 8-9 years ago. They show some sign of light usage, and have what looks like oil stains on the inside. The man I used to know was able to use different plants to make both mixtures to make horses’ coats healthy and shiny, and boys’ skin itchy and irritated. It’s doubtful the stains will yield any evidence now, but I believe the latter was applied. Have the team look for DNA. I have to think about who the victim could be."  That said, he left, while John showed the D.I the letter. By the time John was done with Lestrade, there was no Sherlock anywhere in the building.  John's calls were not answered, so he texted.
“My fingers are inside you, Sherlock.” Teased John, who knew Sherlock avoided cursing and used to complain about John’s dirty mouth.
They got up then, to tidy up. John decided to make some tea, to get some sugar into Sherlock. Seeing his man step out to the covered front porch, to sneak a cigarette, changed his mind in favour of a last whiskey neat.
Sherlock had a hard time not reacting to her sheer nerve. “It seems O’Keiley, that you have made a tactical mistake. You chose to target a child that has as parents an MI5 Army Captain and a Consulting Detective. She took pictures of every note you sent her. In them there are links to your email account. You have just confessed to harassing and endangering a minor, who you  will find has not been left unprotected by the forces that stopped her mother. That, and at this moment you have helped us find and detain the leak that gave you secured information. Having seeked access to use as part of criminal activity will count against you, O’Keiley.”
“No! I have never met Dr Sawyer. It was Molly who told me the two of you were going out.” he confessed. John noticed he was turning a little pink.
“Oh! Yeah, I was offered sex for a price, fortunately ignored by the drug trade, and got into a fight to save a bloke from being hurt.” John said.
“Why do you insist on reminding me of every reason I shouldn’t even consider this? Fine. John had maintained contact with Sholto. I hadn’t been aware of it. I saw emails from ‘Hearts for Africa’ but I read through one that was a request for donations and never looked at them again. I was supposed to respect John’s privacy. Anyway, Sholto had told John about his relationship and his breakup, his return to London. He was devastated. Looking for old friends, to listen to him. John went out with him, got drunk with him. Then, he invited him over. When we were alone, the General asked me if I was ever going to make a move on John. I understood it then. Sholto had been in communication with John, through email but he didn’t know. John and I had been together almost five years. Five years, and he didn’t consider our relationship worthy of telling Sholto.
Sherlock sighed: “Must we go over all the ancient history? One psychiatrist said it when I was eleven. Later on, I was classified as being on the Autism Spectrum, either Asperger’s or PDD-NOS, depending on who you ask. I also have been diagnosed as having comorbid SDS. Obviously, my cognitive skills have not been affected.”
Kaia was a caring, considerate person, who, having grown up without a mother, took to Mrs Hudson immediately. She was small, thin, with long black hair and dark skin. Claire was outspoken, bad mouthed, and quick to be angry. She was taller and bigger than Kaia, her originally blonde hair often tinted blue or pink. She had grown up in the streets after her mom had started bringing home a different boyfriend every week. She also took to Mrs H immediately, and to Rosie also, though she would not easily let it be known. Claire wanted to be an EMS, Kaia wanted to be a social worker, as a case manager had saved her life, even if the lady had been taken off her case soon after, and Kaia had had to run away from home. At first the two young ladies barely tolerated each other, but over the weeks, John saw they created an alliance of a kind, and wondered if Sherlock had purposefully picked each girl. Especially since Mrs Hudson took to them like a duck took to water, and insisted on feeding them both and having them over for tea, constantly. Her stories of the “good old days” endeared her to Claire. She was soon calling them “my girls”.
John did send Sherlock a text about the parent/teacher meeting. It was on a Tuesday, late in the afternoon, 5:30pm. Case time, no chance the great detective would want to come, but John sent the reminder anyway.
“Where did this come from Watson? I am your father by adoption and because I helped your dad raise you. John and I, we- we are sorting things out.” Rosie told him about the conversation at Nyla’s
After a while of this, they went to the living room and Sherlock realized her bag had a six pack of ginger beer and a carton of cigarettes, those exquisite, italian biscuits dipped in chocolate, and enough food to take them through a week.
It had taken Harry’s harsh talking to, for him to begin to see things from Sherlock’s perspective. James had been abroad for a long time, in a relationship for almost 8 years, and had a terrible fall out. His return to England had been because of it. Sholto had contacted John and sounded and looked so sad, John hadn’t had the heart to tell him about Sherlock and him. As Harry had said, he could see so clearly now just how much of an idiot he had been. Sherlock had always been very jealous of Sholto. John thought of how he would have felt, if Sherlock had told Irene Adler they were “just friends” if she came around to visit him. Sherlock would have never done that, though. *When his old lover, from the time he was away, Adrian, came from South America to London with his British husband and paid a visit, Sherlock had introduced John as “my life partner” and held his hand and made sure he sat next and very close to John. On the outings they had with what had actually been a lovely couple, Adrian’s husband, Tom, had been very cautious around Sherlock initially, obviously jealous, but he had relaxed once he saw Sherlock and John together. Come to think of it, John could trace Sherlock’s increasing obsession with work back to Sholto’s visit.
“Although I personally think running away is an idiotic way to resolve problems, I understand how your average intellect may believe it a comforting solution. I will differ with you in that I do not neglect Watson and I consider her of the utmost importance. I will also sustain I have attempted to show you affection multiple times, only to be rejected once and again. Therefore, John Watson, you are free to do whatever you please. Far be it from me to hold you to a person who can’t perform to your liking and whom you are uncomfortable to be around.”
“I admit to being quite confused and fuzzy brained. After all, John wasn’t being specific, he was throwing questions at me while I could look in his eyes, feel his hands and his breath, catch his scent. I understood that he wanted to kiss me, so I hurriedly said ‘Yes!!’ Quite enthusiastically.
John and Sherlock divided a pie, John’s half was the meat lover's pizza, with ground beef, and sausage, while Sherlock’s side was low on cheese with an extra helping of shiitake mushrooms. John also asked for a salad and chicken wings. Sherlock eyed the wings, but didn’t take any. John took a small plate, and served him half his salad, giving him most of the hot peppered olives. Sherlock sat there, blinking for a couple of minutes and then simply said, “Thank you”.
“Earth to Sherlock?” John asked, and Sherlock actually gasped for air, he looked up at John. There was such longing in his eyes, John kneeled next to him, took his friend's face in his hands, and kissed him, oh so gently. It was glorious. The bolt of excitement, his lips, so supple, so male, the smell of evergreen from his soap was dizzying. His eyes, looking at him as if he were the lucky one. Sherlock was looking at a worn out, insignificant, useless soldier, as if John were a prize. Though he knew that if he wasn’t those things anymore, it was thanks to Sherlock.
“Boring, the killer made cuckoo clocks, when he had a target, he made a special one, added a microchip to find out when the victims were home alone, stroke up friendships and came to their homes to kill them. All solved yesterday.”
When he got back in his rental, he felt lighter, his head clearer. He took one deep breath, let it out, nodded to his image in the mirror and started the car, heading back to his life
It went like clockwork, Nelson went wide making the curb, Stewart stood, pretending to get ready for the stop, Sherlock put his newspaper down. Nelson stepped on the accelerator, the suspect lost his balance, making a show of his hand slipping off the security bar. Stewart moved forward as Nelson jerked his hand back and slammed the brakes. Stewart called out for the passengers, “Please remain calm, This is a police investigation."
They finally stopped to take a breath. “That… that was the most ridiculous thing I have ever done!” John said as he caught his breath, but he was smiling.
“Pssf, some genius. I send you comments about my day. You could send me a comment about yours. Not required, though.”
You can find all the music I listened to on repeat while writing this fic + a couple of Luther's pieces, here
John decided to give dating another try. Something about hearing that Sherlock looked great had made him want to dress up and go out. He had made up his mind to only date women. No man could compare to Sherlock.
“Not at all. I never paid Sherlock for his last ‘favor’. I asked him to help me find the mole in our trainer’s program. He told me he was too busy with… other activities to tend to the case, but did it in due time. I didn’t realize I hadn’t deposited the sum in his account. I was notified this property was on sale, and finally had a chance to invest his money in an appropriate way. This was Marcel’s property, Sherlock.”
He found some mango flavored rum, present from Molly. Sherlock made a valiant effort and talked about the girls’ experiment, feeling very uncomfortable, what had he been thinking?
“A concerned party. He would call me an Archenemy. Though in reality, I worry constantly about him.”
The HAPPYs are here!! There will be birthday celebrations, when John will have a long held dream come true!! It is a surprise for Sherlock and Rosie and they will both be so excited! There will be lovely family fun.
The musicians started to set up, and John noticed the singer, looking at Sherlock. Of course, who could blame him. The fellow was in his mid twenties at most, tall, kind of lanky, wavy dark brown hair, full lips, green eyes. He had a Spanish look about him, decidedly a handsome bloke. John hoped he didn’t have to stop the lad from flirting with his partner. The guests started arriving and the  minister also, which prompted the band to start the music. One of the members of the band played the violin, well, though he was no Sherlock.
Sherlock did not like to feel confused. It was proving difficult to define John’s intentions. He was being friendly, letting Watson invite him to dinner, then splitting his salad with him, giving him most of the olives. Then, did he ask for dessert because Sherlock had only eaten half his part of the salad and the shiitake mushrooms? After so much food, he relented from getting a cab immediately in favor of walking with Watson. The walk was beautiful. John had kept remarking on different things until Sherlock felt compelled to talk about history, just to avoid any intimate subjects.
“Your clothes are dark and edgy, but pricey. Your shoes are high end, Dylan. Your arms have sleeve tattoos. Your haircut is grown-up and very modern. You have higher education, sat at a graphic design class. Lidia, you have tattoos on your forearms, your shoulders and your wrist, which would make it difficult to cover up for a job such as a teacher, a nurse or an office assistant. Your hair and nails are professionally cared for, and you have opted to colour your modern cut with blue tips. It suits you well. You are comfortable around each other and are over the early stage of need to touch in your relationship, and I distinctly remember how artistically talented you are. You have done very well for yourselves.”
When the boy struggled at that and the man behind them succeeded in taking down the boy’s jeans, John ran towards them, raising his cane in his hand and jabbing the man on the back, hard. The man screamed, and let go of the boy, while the other two came to his aid. For a moment, John thought the would-be victim had run off, but he had just taken a moment to pick up his trousers.
Sherlock took a seat then; “Lizbeth, would you prefer to let Charlie go back to the States, then? See Nyla six months of each year and Charlie none? She told me a friend of hers connected her to an old flame. You didn’t like it when she went out with me or when she ‘slept over.”  He said in a meaningful way.
“Rosie, some people’s phones can be either low in charge or incommunicado due to being in the tube” Said Sherlock.
As always a thank you and a shout out to two extraordinary beta readers, authors, artists and overall amazing friends,
Sherlock was grateful for Mrs Hudson’s presence, but as the day progressed, he couldn’t help getting nervous. He wanted John, how was he supposed to go through with this? He should just go out there and find John and tell him he couldn’t do this...
“Somewhere in the middle, I guess. I thought he didn’t answer my reminder texts, so when I saw him there, I was...upset. I was convinced he was playing games, trying to get the upper hand. Then, once I got home, I realised he had answered. I just didn’t get them because I got caught in a mess of traffic in the tube.”
“Like you said yourself, you are basically married already. You have adopted Rosie. Now it’s a matter of you having the same name, and being able to include John in the Holmes family, and having shared healthcare, and filing taxes together, and all those things married couples have. That’s all it is! Look at me, Sherlock. A year ago, I was alone with my cats. Bill blasted through my walls like an explosion, and turned my life arse over tits. And I love it. I wouldn’t change this for anything! You know John, you have seen how much work he has put in to fix his mistakes. He loves you Sherlock and he is determined. Has he failed you these last months? Will you let him down?” Molly asked and looked at him with affection.
“I’m fine Sherwin…” Both men laughed. “.... wanted to check in and brought you breakfast, just to see you strolling down the street, looking like the cat who got the cream.”
When Sherlock appeared to breathe again, he reached for the jeans’ pockets and retrieved a small tube of lube. He slicked his hands and John’s cock with lube. John did not need much, as just grabbing that arse almost threw him over. He did grab Sherlock’s hips with one hand, and teased a nipple with the other which caused a groan, so he kept teasing, causing Sherlock to pull on him harder and John to spill over.
John has left London with Rosie. On Sherlock’s days. He only meant to find refuge with his sister, unthinkingly leaving Sherlock fearing the worst. Alone in the night, what will he do? Is there anyone to help him? How will they go on from here? While the beginning of this chapter is indeed full dark, with no stars, there is a door, a warming fire behind it, and a long road to discovering how to rebuild oneself when all seems lost.
“I’m his fiance, Mr Holmes and very pleased to meet you. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for the advice you gave this hard headed kid. He only gave me a chance after he met you. Your wedding was the most beautiful I have seen.”
“Sherlock, look! This is Jackson! He is the Birthday boy! Jackson, this is Sherlock Holmes!” Rosie introduced them as Jackson stopped to say hello to her.
“Yes, fine. It’s just, tomorrow is a Watson day. I don’t want her to remember me, as I remember my mother. As I was growing up, nothing I did was important enough for her to take time away from work. No science exhibition, no research project, no musical concert. My parents never knew the extent of my social problems, or of my isolation. Mum didn’t really know me. I want Watson to feel differently. I want her to know she is important to me, and be confident that I know her.”
“Fair enough. How did you know I had a relationship with a man that didn’t work out?’ Luther’s smile was encouraging.
Gianna had finished picking up the art supplies and came to the office, pushing a food cart with tea service for them. She talked soothingly with Rosie and John. Sherlock tried hard not to pay attention and harder yet not to think of… When at some point he looked up at John, he found him looking at Rosie. Sherlock got a text from Stewart, letting him know he was on the way.
John left, to his choice of an empty flat, where Johnny Walker was the only friend available to him.
“Yes, Little Bee. I am. I have an illness in my mind. It makes me tired and my thoughts are a little mixed up. But, Mike is being my doctor. He is helping. And I’m not contagious.”
“How did you know about the guilt?” asked the man, extending his hand to him, “Wilson Sternbach.” And Sherlock knew one of those names was a lie. American, 5’9, some 7 years older than Sherlock. Thin, low muscle mass, suffered a major illness a while back.  Brown sandy hair, lively brown eyes, nice smile.
“Everything!! I think I didn’t notice just how much I missed it! I loved going to my grandparents’ house. That was going back home.”
John went straight to Mrs. Lewis, but Sherlock had left. “Such a handsome young man you have, John! I could have sworn you were, how do you young ones say it nowadays, straight? But I can see how you two are good for one another.” John murmured some hurried thanks and went to his flat.
He turned around and looked at John. “He will not stop. Moriarty issued a direct threat upon you when he said he would clear my path. I will not blame you if you decide to…”
Voicemail: (tense voice) “John, it’s Sherlock. I’m calling because you stated you wanted to assist in cases. It is fine if you can not at the moment, though an answer would be appreciated. If you have chosen not to participate at all, an answer would still be appropriate.”
John hid his own nerves with his Captain persona. He had done his own research, his own preparation and was ready. Now that they were both hard and willing, hands all over each other, he said, “I want you to come inside me.”
“Sherlock, could we please move forward with this? *Can we start over? One more time…” John asked, trying to convey his feelings in every possible way.
The minister gave a non-secular sermon about the joys and responsibilities of matrimony. He spoke clearly and was jovial and concise. Greg’s vows were spoken in his clear, friendly voice, promising to take care of his husband, let him bounce ideas off him and follow him to the ends of the Earth. Mycroft got surprisingly sentimental and vowed not to let his husband doubt how much he had changed his life and would never leave him behind because of work.
“Stop that right now. I’m not ‘people’! I absolutely do not need or want a break from you. Since I was here, I got to thinking that this room is one more floor removed from Mrs Hudson’s acute sense of hearing.”
John and Sherlock have each acknowledged that help was needed to addresss the issues that led them to their break up. Each is at work with a therapist. John has finally opened up to Beverly and they are discussing topics he has had challenges with. Sherlock trusts Dr Q with advice and with helping him gain some objectivity.
Sherlock needs to clear some things up for himself, and for Luther. Then, dinner with the family? They finally have a pretty nice time, even if they both are careful, careful, careful.  Sherlock asks Mike a favor. Mike though, recommends somebody else.  Then there will be a dinner together, most certainly nice. Rosie is having some trouble, that also leads her to think about her mother.
“Only when Molly’s jaw dropped to the floor. Quite naughty of you to invite her and not tell her he was there.”
I’ve had them for as long as I can remember. I also have two grandmas, three aunts, two uncles, a grandpa and the Stamfords, who all take care of me. For your information, Sherlock is my real dad, he adopted me. He is not mean, he’s honest and has no patience for idiots. Not only does he do experiments at home, he includes me so I can learn from them too. And if I have a question, he answers, and if it’s about girly stuff, we look it up until he can answer. I couldn’t do without either of my dads.” Rosie glanced at Pepsi, who nodded briefly.
The substitute Principal, Ms O’Keily,  Mrs Burns out due to a broken leg, tried to talk to him. “Mr. Holmes, that is not the most recent document we have on file. Your name is not on the latest form.”
The feeling of Sherlock in his arms, when morning came around, all angles and stolen blankets and legs tangled up with his, made John so happy, tears leaked out of his eyes. He fell back to sleep just looking at him. Rosie woke up later, hearing the absolute silence she got up to investigate. Upon seeing her dads, all tangled up together, she gasped,  but quietly got John’s phone and took a picture so he could find it and draw it later. She commandeered some Italian biscuits, cause this was one special occasion, and went back to her room, to call Pepsi.
for being such loyal supporters and finding time for me as you write your own stories and live your talented, fulfilling lives.
“Hey, all I mean is I’m happy for you. If this bloke is good for you, I say carry on. You deserve some fun.”
John smiled warmly; “you sound as if I intend to oppose you in some way. We are a couple, remember? Sherlock, do you think I would have taken a step like this lightly? I am very sure of what I did. I simply gave my daughter her father in writing. Nobody else deserves to call themselves her parent. Once more, I’m not going anywhere, ever again. I am sure. I’m your partner now. I will be anything you want me to. I will stay as close to you as you want me to be.”
Those eyes would haunt him, stare at him from a broken, fallen Sherlock. John hadn’t dreamt about the fall in years. Now he thought about the dead years. Sherlock had given John a  basic version about what he must have gone through. John’s dreams were now filling in the blanks, as he saw Sherlock suffering every kind of torture he could imagine. John would wake up, desperately searching for his other, and find himself alone in his flat, with Rosie in the bedroom. Being so alone would drive him crazy. He had to do something. As soon as was polite, he made a call.
Rosie, Nyla, Pepsi and Mel, had a spectacular evening at the theater. Then, a trip around the city, getting their nails done “Wicked” style. There, they had met a classmate, Alison, out with her mom. They had been invited to join the girls’ playdate  at Nyla’s mother’s place, where they would have dinner before Mrs Stamford took them home.
When they cleared the lane, the song started and there was Harry, looking stunning in her dress, but Sherlock only had eyes for John. The mad man had his full state uniform on. He was dancing in it! Dancing. John lipsang to it and had the biggest smile, his eyes had such happiness:
They both dozed off a little again. Then John’s stomach rumbled and he got up to go to the bathroom. He came back with a flannel and cleaned Sherlock off. “You can rest a while and I’ll take the first shower.” Said John as he took fresh pants to the loo. “Mhjnnnfff” said Sherlock and was about to drop back to sleep when he heard a text message. He couldn’t find his phone anywhere so, it had to be John’s phone. Rosie? Sherlock made a mistake.
'and never, as you know well my dear, a reminder of my utter passion for "the Woman." And what was more laughable than choosing Sherlock Holmes for witness at one’s wedding…a calculating machine, a man against passion…or so they say… You know how much I can be forgiving with crimes of passion, don't you Doctor ?
- ‘You staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise, when you learnt that she had left England - 'Never to return.' And I uttered the three last words dramatically, 'détachant chaque syllabe' [1].
- ' The Woman, yes, she deserved the surname, ‘c’est vendeur’[1], and last but not least ‘She thought I was handsome’.
- ‘I’m certainly not,’ I cried. 'Must I remind you that I was not the man whom she gave a sovereign, – and I raised my voice – 'A man, who decided to wear it on his watch-chain in memory of the occasion.'
'2/a Against mighty Kings, 2/b Against the world,' he said with a sudden vehemence,'like you she was brave'
I began to run back in my mind, the principal events in the King of Bohemia's story ; he was not so unhappy, as my friend had solved his case and - moreover the man was such a boastful and arrogant fellow, unfortunately (and I thought it was the right word at the time) such men were usually happy.
- ‘Pray hear me…’ he said, and I restrained myself not to answer ‘an’ please your honour’ like Trim in 'Tristram Shandy'–
- ‘Dear me - You sound very confused this morning, as you may recall Bohemia has sea-ports in winter, friend Watson. I rather expected you would be, indeed you really drank too much of this excellent Montrachet, yesterday evening when we came back from Covent garden -and, after the night we –‘
I was reading the Daily Telegraph, relating the fashionable and sumptuous wedding of our last poorly noble client, Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Falstein.
After a dramatic pause, to gather the full attention of his audience, Holmes looked at me with a mischievous glint in his dreamy grey eyes, and as I looked at him looking at me, I scorned to change my state with kings…with or without seven castles…or with Irene Adler of divine repute, or with anyone else in the world. Then leaning forwards, and laying his hand gently upon my shoulder, my lover declared solemnly
Our hearts, both of Holmes and I, were alike subject to sudden over-flowings ;—a short silence ensued
- 'The King of Bohemia, and please give me the eggs and a couple of rashers Holmes,' I replied, 'was unfortunate, as thus—That taking great pleasure and delight in navigation and all sort of sea affairs—and there happening throughout the whole kingdom of Bohemia, to be no sea-port town whatever—'
- ‘Wounded in the knee ? Really Watson, according to your works, my dear fellow, you were struck on the shoulder, or later wounded in the leg ! The knee is more specific’
be told my dear man ! At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight that it may have an influence upon Watsonian history.' Holmes laughed.
My companion was with a cup of coffee in one hand and a boiled-egg in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.
Yet, for not caring to retract my epithet—and less to explain it—and least of all, to twist my tale (like men of lore) to serve a system—after a hum and a haw, I went on—
- ‘This unfortunate King of Bohemia !’ I blurted out, pointing at the newspaper with my egg-spoon. And my words appeared to afford Holmes considerable amusement.
- ‘What a sentimental journey breakfast is, with you my dear Watson !’ And he swallowed his last boiled-egg with a grin.
‘So... Well, this is why all people say you are in love with Irene Adler’ said I, with a feigned offended voice.
Ah, the power of a cup of tea. Why not? He won’t be able to get back to sleep any time soon. “Sure,” he agrees.
he’s trying to stem the bleeding but it’s too much, the bandages soak through again and again. Sherlock’s face is waxen and his eyes flutter closed. John’s hands are in Sherlock’s guts and he sobs as he keeps packing the bandages. It’s futile. He knows he can’t save him.
Sherlock’s making tea. Again. John’s beginning to wonder if Sherlock hasn’t been replaced with a pod person. Still, tea. John slides out of Sherlock’s bed and stretches again. He feels good. Probably should stop looking gift Sherlocks in the mouth and go and have tea. Maybe he can talk Sherlock into making breakfast as well, he thinks, as he makes his way to the living room, then remembers he hasn’t looked in the fridge for a while.
“What if you injure yourself more seriously next time? Or if you are attacked? You are in no condition to take care of yourself.”
“I just told you. Are you usually this slow in the morning? Don’t answer that, the question was rhetorical.”
He wakes to a familiar impatient tapping sound. He opens his eyes to a room shaded in gloom, but with light peeking around the edges of the curtains. John feels the difference immediately that just getting a few hours uninterrupted sleep has made. He’s ready to face the day.
Sherlock’s looking at John’s lap. No, at his hands, resting on his thighs, palms facing up because the scrapes on the heels of them are still raw. There’s still dirt and debris ground into them. Treatment should be his first priority; most of the skin’s gone. He hadn’t realised in the dark how much skin he’d managed to take off; he hadn’t given them a thought when he’d returned home. The throbbing of his hands hadn’t seemed important as he’d collapsed on his bed and closed his eyes, not expecting to be able to sleep but desperate to try.
John sits up. His hands are shaking. He crosses his arms and tucks his hands into his armpits to still them. The bedside lamp is on and he can see Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bed beside him, watching him, a crease between his eyes. If it had been anyone else, John would have said they looked worried.
John sips his tea. It’s apparent that Sherlock’s not about to say anything else, and John honestly doesn’t have the energy to pursue the point. It’s peaceful enough. The adrenalin rush has left him. He sits and cradles his tea and, eventually, his eyelids start to droop.
John’s expecting the tea to be cold; he’s pretty sure he put it down and forgot about it. He’s just alert enough to register the warmth of the mug against his fingers and the steam rising from the top before he scalds his mouth by taking a too big of a drink. He blows on the surface near the edge of the mug a few times and then takes a careful sip, then another. It’s clearly freshly made and exactly how he likes it, which is a miracle in itself. Sherlock’s usual attempts at making tea, on the rare occasions he can’t browbeat Mrs Hudson or John into doing it for him, seems to be to throw the tea bag, the hot water and some milk (if John’s lucky) in the general direction of a cup and hope for the best. Sometimes John feels nostalgic for a time when he could afford to be particular about the way he drinks his tea.
He wakes up to the morning light, fully expecting Sherlock to have fled at some point during the night, so he’s surprised to find his housemate dead to the world, limbs sprawled over as much as the bed as humanly possible. John regards him fondly for a few minutes, but he needs to pee, so he carefully lifts the arm that’s flung carelessly over his hip and slides out of bed.
“That was a rhetorical question.” John’s well aware he looks like hell; he doesn’t need Sherlock to point out the obvious, thank you.
