He attempts a little composing, but everything comes off sounding trite and amateurish.
Strangely quiet for the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday.
“Yeah?
Didn’t say that at all.
I—I don’t…
“You’re defending her.
He had his ideas, and that’s how it was, and that’s what you did, and so I did, and now here I am, just maybe figuring things out and…”
On the contrary, John seems to crave it, being needed, almost as much as Sherlock craves being wanted.
I’ve never been this way with anyone, and it’s surprised me, too, the things I feel when we’re together.”
His brother says the other children aren’t worth his time, so far below his level as to be almost insignificant.
My offer still stands, Captain.
The school.
John looks over at him, and then quickly away again.
Okay.”
“Flattery?”
Sherlock tilts his chin down and buries his nose in John’s hair.
I shouldn’t have…”
“I’m not so sure.”
He reaches down and lays a hand on his forehead, which really isn’t necessary, but this is Sherlock being a miracle and a menace in one lovely package.
The room is cold when he finally gets out from under the covers.
He’s dressed up a little: plaid button-down shirt, done all the way up to the collar, navy v-neck jumper pulled on over top, a pair of neatly pressed chinos with brown leather brogues to finish it off.
Interesting.”
“Oh, I forgot about those.
I promise you that.”
John reaches out and takes Sherlock’s gloved hand, gives it a squeeze, just to make sure he understands that John’s words are the light-hearted banter he means them to be.
And there’s something in Sherlock’s voice that snaps something in John, brings him back in control of his own body, and he manages to hold back, somehow.
John repeats.
“In the top drawer by the sink in the loo.”
Everything.
But then, that does seem to be his lot in life…
John’s eyes spill over.
“I know.”
His hand drops.
Well, that’s good.
“Ahh…”
“Fine.”
My grandmum’s recipe.
He swallows tight, and sighs in frustration.
Sherlock hears him sniff.
Right.
John grins.
Come around to the flat first.
He grins the grin Sherlock has fallen in love with, and then nods his head toward the pantry.
John looks up, catches Sherlock’s eye and must see the confusion there.
“And all.
Sherlock takes a sip of wine.
Perhaps he shared a cab with a dark-haired stranger.
It makes his eyes pop marine blue, even in the dim of the foyer.
John sighs, and hates the wash of relief he feels at the sight of Sherlock’s frantic texts.
“I left home when I was seventeen.
Okay.
But it’s all still so new yet, and he doesn’t want to presume.
“That so?”
Sherlock pitches his voice low, in a tone John now realises he reserves for ASMR videos, and other, rather more intimate situations.
“You want to come back here?”
That’s—that’s not…
“I know.
He did.
John tucks back in.
I love you.”
She leans in closer, cups a hand between her mouth and his ear, conspiratorially.
He’s so close.
He sits up a little straighter in his chair.
“Yeah?”
On the ‘morrow then.”
Sherlock’s hands cup his face.
“What do you mean?”
John regales them with the details of his internet sleuthing earlier in the day, and finds a raucous audience in the men around the table, all save Huxtable who has been looking more and more constipated with every passing moment.
And then, suddenly, John is on his back, empty, aching, and Sherlock is scrambling above, him stuffing a pillow under his hips, pulling him toward him by his upper thighs, fumbling with the condom, and finally squeezing out the last of the lube to slick himself, dusky purple, throbbing, rock hard, with a groan.
“Sit on my lap.”
He mutters on instinct.
He can see her examining him out of the corner of his eye.
He gets to his feet as well.
“Here.
Things will be alright.
He tries to ignore the sour knot that forms in the pit of his stomach at that.
But it sounds considerably less seductive, congested as he is.
“Oh, this is much better…”
he looks down and realises his hands are shaking.
“Just what do you think you’re playing at, hmm?”
“I love you.”
Now take your clothes off and get under the covers.”
James Bond.
“No, no.
“A half hour ago.”
But it isn’t Sherlock doing it, this time.
John is pouring himself another glass of scotch.
It takes a moment for Sherlock’s mind to register the pop for what it is.
After a moment more, he turns the key in the ignition, and pulls out of their parking spot in front of the village pub.
“You’ve talked openly about these things?”
“More for you, I guess.”
“Woo hoo!”
A comfortable silence descends between them.
“Fine.”
He feels Sherlock pout sleepily against his neck, and smiles.
And I don’t want you to feel…”
“I shouldn’t have cleaned you afterwards.
“I’ll tell you when we get home.”
“Then I imagine that over time actions will speak louder than words ever could.”
), a basket of bread, and a bottle of wine, and then finally leaves them in peace.
“Of course.”
He seems to hesitate.
John sits up a little in his chair, and Sherlock mourns the press of his foot against his.
“Shall I tell you what I’ve dreamt of doing to you?”
Sherlock briefly wonders if the gesture might qualify as a date in John’s mind, and then stuffs the thought down deep.
Sherlock reaches out and pulls John against his body.
Slow.
Sherlock shakes his head.
“He didn’t suspect you, I imagine.
Sherlock smiles.
At some point he sleeps.
John blinks, stunned that Sherlock remembers.
Sherlock feels his cheeks heat, and wonders at it.
John just shrugs.
Let me.
Look at him, thin as a whippet.”
“Not going to last if you…”
“But Donna came regularly?”
But John is fraying at the seams, slipping, and there’s nothing he wouldn’t do to stop that from happening.
The last week or so I’ve begun to wonder if you are simply tolerating me.
Sherlock.
John rubs a hand across his eyes, shakes his head.
He lazily wipes his hand on the sheets, and then reaches down to card his fingers through his unruly curls.
Not anything like what he feels when he is with John, but unmistakably pleasurable.
He can’t take his eyes off the bottom of the screen, the spot where Sherlock’s hand has disappeared, the flexing of his forearm, like he has himself in hand, like he’s…
“Must we.”
Use discretion.
“You want me to keep on?”
“Mind if I suggest some?”
“Kisses aren’t a get-out-of-jail-free card, just so you know.”
It’s stretching Sherlock to his limit, and there have been days when he has felt that if something doesn’t happen soon, it will tear him apart and leave him raw, and bloody and beyond repair.
And perhaps that is part of what had so terrified John tonight, a part of what he had grieved: the seeming impossibility of what Sherlock is suggesting, to John’s mind the abandonment of ‘happily ever after’, and instead the conviction that what he wants is not something so easily won, something that instead lies at the end of a long road that John feels too weary and worn down to traverse.
“Shampoo,” Sherlock says next, and John complies immediately, no roll of the eyes, no huffing, no objection of any kind.
“Oh, is that so.”
He ignores the whoops and snickers from the rest of the detectives as he heads for the elevators.
He’s twined close enough to John that he knows he must feel it, and sure enough, after a moment John breaks away with a moan and rocks against Sherlock’s thigh, his hands knotting into fists in the thin cotton of Sherlock’s T-shirt.
Sherlock isn’t sure whether to be relieved or not.
John hates his shirt and vest.
“They didn’t have the kind of dumplings you like.
“I need the boys correspondence, all the letters he’s received in the last month.
“Like love?”
- This girl's channel is just a delight.  She does a lot of personal attention vids, which are usually not my cup of tea, but I enjoy hers.  She even did one, recently, for people who may be coming out to their families over the holidays.  She also does a lot of binaural mouth sounds videos which I very much enjoy.  There's no hiding of her face here, so if intense eye-contact makes you uncomfortable, you may want to try just listening and not watching.
Sherlock is glad he thought to order the risotto.
Didn’t you?”
There had been shrapnel missed.
Maybe he should just stay offline for awhile anyway.
But we’ve said them now, so here we are…”
John gets to his feet, walks across the room and adjusts the thermostat up a few degrees and then returns, snatching a decorative pillow and faux fur throw off the back of the nearest sofa as he does.
I’m sure it’s coming.”
When the cab pulls up in front of the flat, Sherlock stumbles out and heads inside without waiting for John.
Sherlock thinks John doesn’t want him.
His clothes from the day before are wrinkled and clinging to his ribs and shoulders in spots.
“Well, it seems I’m outnumbered.”
John’s eyebrows ascend and disappear into his fringe.
“You want me to get in there with you?”
There is clearly more he isn’t saying.
The hotel.
“Okay.”
I mean—we’re adults.”
Sherlock nods.
And then he…”
want?”
The grip of his hands on John’s knees tightens.
John is half hard.
John stirs against his chest.
Nothing.
John is stunned at the generosity, at the simple act of kindness.
“Oh…”  Soft, and slightly pleased.  “Well, I’m not going anywhere.  You know that right?  I’m staying this time—if that’s alright with you.”
“Both.”
But bring me tissue first.
The ear thing’s the worst of it, I think.
For years they didn’t know what had happened to him, then when I was sixteen it was in all the papers, a farmer clearing a bit of land that had laid fallow for decades, found human remains.
When they finally come up for air, John has no idea how much time has passed, but he is awed and grateful that Rosie still seems to be fast asleep in the next room, and he is reminded all over again, why the first time they made love he had cried with regret, off-and-on for days, because though he had fantasied about it now and again, he never could have imagined what it would be like to hold Sherlock in his arms, to share the things they share, to love and be loved in return.
“This is difficult for you to talk about.
He looks her up and down.
Pads of his fingers rubbing against John’s scalp.
“Why do you think?”
Time to go.
“See, I told you he’d come ‘round.”
But John doesn’t question it.
“She’s responding, which is good.  Seems disoriented.  Not very talkative.  A bit agitated.  But her vitals are good, and the swelling seems to be abating.  She might have gotten really lucky.  Still, it’s going to be a bloody long, hard recovery, and you know Harry…”
Holdernesse drops his hand and leans back in his chair, shoulder’s slumped, gaze distant and sad.
“It’s absurdly simple.
I’ve said so.”
And Sherlock must know somehow, because he kisses him until John can’t think straight, until any fear that might have tried to hide, tried to stay, has been chased from the furthest and darkest corners of his mind.
John lowers them.
“You have a T-shirt I can borrow?”
“Yes, Watson.
“Maybe, yeah.”
“It’s nice, Sherlock.
“That a good thing?”
He looks sad, Sherlock thinks, and then chastises himself.
“Things were just getting good.”
John traces a finger slowly down his forearm, from crook to wrist.
Sherlock dumps a spoonful of sugar into the cup.
The restaurant is small and intimate.
“How are you not tired of me yet?”
John’s heart aches.
John takes them out of habit, and then looks down and registers what it is.
It’s something John never thought himself capable of—either of them really, but here they are, and they’re doing it.  They’re loving one another, and it’s a gift.
He dips down and sucks a lovely pink mark into the pale skin of Sherlock’s chest.
“John!”
“Daddy will come?”
John whispers back.
Okay.
“Yeah.  You seem—off?”
“Who is he, Sherlock?”
Anything at all.
After I got shot, couldn’t do that anymore, and the thought of being a GP, treating strep, and piles, and head lice all day, wasn’t all that appealing after three years as a trauma surgeon in the desert.
Still SensoryScience though, slowly pouring sand from one glass into another.
He fucking flinches.
But for whatever reason, it’s just made his job all that much easier.
“Mm?”
“What did I just say?”
I do have to dash, though.”
“John, I…
John’s breath catches.
She won’t be up until much later, if at all.
“Mmm…”
John laughs about it, and mentions that it’s only the mad ones who are out strolling the beach in so much cold, and Sherlock’s blood sings at the lightness of his tone, and the way his eyes sparkle while he presses in close for warmth.
For all they have done, they still haven’t done that, and there is an intimacy to it, Sherlock thinks, that is something more than stroking another’s knee, their thigh, more than tracing the length of their spine, or burying your fingers in their hair, or even of growing hard against their body.
“We got a case?”
Sherlock loves it.
Sherlock goes.
John could lie.
C-O-C-K
It’s unlikely.
He doesn’t matter to people.
“Will you be alright if we go?”
He’ll just wait.
He has to take a few slow, deep breaths, get himself in the right mind set.
“Yes, I do.
The proprietor is leaning against the counter flirting with an older woman in a purple dress.
And Sherlock seems ridiculously pleased with the outcome, and looks better than anyone has any right looking in his ninja kit, so still high on a adrenaline, they end up playfully wrestling one another to the floor of the lounge when they get back, which then devolves into something altogether different.
No friends.
When he gets to the door of the nursery it’s to the sight of John trying to wrestle Rosie into her clothes, while she wails piteously on the floor.
His chest rising and falling as he catches his breath, and he is still sick, and the floor is cold, and…
“You can say the word, John.
It takes them a few seconds to get their limbs sorted, and find a position that feels comfortable, but Sherlock likes laying with his cheek against John’s good shoulder, John’s arm slung over his ribs, his face pressed into John’s chest.
To lose himself in John’s taste, and breath, and heat.
He holds up the the glass jar labelled ‘Lavender’ and tosses in a scoop.
What do you want?”
Sherlock finally says out of the blue.
Sherlock reaches across the space between them, and slips his hand over one of John’s.
“I want to go out and check the hives.
He looks back up at Ella.
“Listen, who are you?
“I missed everything, and I hoped—I hoped we could pick up where we left off.
He gets to his feet and heads for the loo.
“Do you?”
“In your case, age could hardly be considered a detriment.”
Sherlock looks up, and John smiles, small and crooked.
The question seems to catch John by surprise.  His hand stills, like maybe it’s just hit him, what it is he’s suggesting, what it is they are about to do.  He looks down at Sherlock, forehead damp, eyes full, and nods.
John loses all track of time, but at some point Sherlock’s lips start to wander.
John can feel the pull and burn in his shoulder.
He can hear a chopper somewhere, getting closer.
He returns to the counter for the teacups.
From what you’ve told me you have been communicative and open with one another.
“Mm, I want to try something.
Okay.
“Tell me you know you’re my best friend.”
He watches the man stroke a hand over the woman’s hair, watches the way she stares up into his eyes with a look not unlike the one Redbeard used to turn on him when he would scratch behind his ears.
His voice is low and intimate.
Apparently James shared your taste in tacky holiday trim.”
“It was the most—perfect thing that’s ever happened to me.
He goes from flushed and curious, to pale and terrified right before John’s eyes.
And the food is delicious.
“You miss it, don’t you—still?”
But the man merely moans, and then tries to prop himself on one elbow, before promptly vomiting violently onto the pavement.
“You’re mad.”
He lays in the dark and listens to John’s breathing, and wonders why it makes him ache, why it hurts to hear him so still and so vulnerable, why he yearns to somehow pull John inside of himself so that that nothing can ever part them again.
Greg pats him on the back.
“Why would you think you…?
Do you feel the tension coiling tight here?”
“No.”
He clings to John like he’s drowning.
Water.
“You’re here now.
He showers her with praise, and encouragement, and terms of endearment.
“More,” he chokes out.
He’d look at you and tell you your whole life story.”
“Well, what?”
I got off with a bloke at a party in uni.
He swallows.
Sherlock’s hands are transport and anchor, giving him wings, rooting him to the bed, to earth, to reality.
John sits up further, and tries to clear the sleep from his brain.
“Oh.”
“No one at all.”
They’ve finally reached the A-Road, and John merges onto it, and then seems to relax fully.
“What?”
“Sugar?”
He swallows tightly, quelling the fluttering moths of anxiety flitting about his belly.
Sherlock turns around and then stops dead, stares down at John on one knee with the simple platinum band in his palm, and blinks.
“Yeah, I did, didn’t I…”
His eyes fill and spill over.
He’d accompanied Mrs. Hudson to the gravesite a few weeks later, and then disappeared for almost two years.
“So it seems, but why?”
The man’s head snaps up.
I have wanted this—you, for years, and I…
She’d be bruised and bloody, and it was always just fucking love to her…
And so Sherlock does, and gets it right.
I—I have a bad habit of teasing when I’m out of my depth, and it’s not appreciated here.
And I wanted you, so I…
“But this case—it’s personal to you, yeah?
It is what it is.
Sure if you’d like.”
Fuck him.”
Sherlock moans long and deep, a moan that breaks off into a breathy grunt as he feels John push impatiently against him at the sound.
And John had thought,
John’s eyes snap up to him at the sudden movement, and then drop to his lap again.
“Yes, if I can.”
Sherlock recognises the internal panic behind his eyes when he feels too much.
“Okay, then.”
“It was…”
He remembers how fortunate he’d felt when Victor had started to seek him out, how it made the year easier.
It’s fine.”
All he knows is John,
“I would, but the thing that Frank was working on was top level.
Sherlock huffs against his chest, and John draws lines over his back with blunt of his nails.
There’s really no reason why he should be feeling it today more than any other day, but here he is, struggling through rush hour traffic with stars in his eyes and smile on his lips.
“Don’t be ridiculous.
And John thinks again, of the little box stowed away in his overnight bag upstairs, and all the doubts and fears he’s wrestled with for the last year, and of the decision he’d come to just a few days prior, and now here’s confirmation that Sherlock wants, and needs, and loves him just as much, and predictably John’s been a right arse about it.
He watches the corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirk upwards.
John means it.
Some of the anger drains out of him.
Sherlock smiles.  “A bit.”
He buries his face in the mattress.
“Yeah, yeah.
Sherlock catches himself.
Sherlock wipes his hand as thoroughly as he can on the sheets, and applies more lube, trying not to think about the fact that they are doing all of this without protection.
In the dark.
She’s rather pleased about your existence, you know.
It’s oddly comforting.
“‘Course.”
Sherlock’s face does a myriad of things John can’t interpret, but finally settles into something fond and slightly amused.
It needs to be said.
No choice to make.
“Did it ever occur to you that maybe I don’t want to talk to you at all?”
“Earliest fantasy was this.”
It’s totally a ‘me’ thing.
The words rumble through John’s chest.
“Oh?”
He looks down at Sherlock’s knit brow.
Rosie curls up next to him, and pulls at the fabric of his T-Shirt.
So he wants you to drop the case?
(John doesn’t understand.  He thinks ‘love’, like you love a friend, and it is that, yes, it is, but it’s more, it’s so much, it’s everything, and John can’t possibly understand that is what he means.  He can’t, because if he did, he would not have said it back, not so easily, not with so much softness, not so matter-of-fact, not so calm.)
“You the only one who can make a business appointment every time you want to have a chat?
Not brave enough, not smart enough, not strong enough, not enough by far, plain and simple.
“What’s all that then?”
He gazes up at John’s face, eyes screwed shut and brow knit, face flushed scarlet, lips parted.
When we were at uni together, he had this trick he used to do.
Her nose wrinkles, and she pulls a packet of wet wipes out of her desk, and starts wiping Rosie’s hands.
“Well they’d better not take all morning.”
“A perfect match then.”
John’s eyes are closed, his head tipped back, and his fingers flex and mesh with Sherlock’s, even as his erection twitches, and leaks and bounces against his belly with Sherlock’s movements, and it’s the most overwhelming thing Sherlock has ever experienced, and in the best of ways, and all he wants is just this, just the two of them, joined together, breathing the same breath, hearts beating the same rhythm, his pulse thrumming along side John’s deep inside.
Sherlock’s hand slides up the whole length of John’s spine, and comes to rest tangled in his hair.
Maybe he longs to be filled by a man.”
“From the inside.”
Sherlock reaches down and takes his bag.
“It’s not because we’re—blokes.  Not that. Not—really.”
Well, that’s not really…”
“Would you take off your jumper?
He smiles back.
When he gets back, he’s still getting alerts, and he has a text from Mike:
You were injured?”
You want the other one?”
That includes not putting yourself in positions where you go off half-cocked, and get yourself into shit where I can’t help.”
John’s head snaps up.
“What?
His mouth and eyes feel like sandpaper.
He nods.
He wants desperately to hang on to this.
“Hey, hey, hey…”
“No.”  All heads turn his way.  Sherlock shakes his head.  “No. That’s too easy. It’s what he would want us to think.  He’s got to be somewhere else.”
He laughs at his jokes.
“Yeah.”
“Do you?”
I’ve never, I mean there’ve been a few circle jerks, but not like…”
“John.
“Slide up for me.”
“‘Cause listen, there’s this…”
It was lunch hour maybe?
John’s brow knits, and then lets go.
“Well, the somethings have been said.
“You wanna come
John whimpers in his sleep.
To be honest I’ve not really even thought much about dating in over two years.
The cottage had been decorated, top to bottom, the day before, and they had both collapsed onto the sofa after dark, and shovelled down a couple of bowls of tinned stew, and some bread that John had warmed in the oven, before falling asleep together on the sofa.
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic, little brother.” Both Sherlock and John turned to look at the polished man in the suit while he leaned on his umbrella. He entered the room, ignoring the glare from Sherlock and the curious eyes from John.
“I’m done if you are,” Sherlock murmured, already shrugging on his coat. John jumped out of his chair and tried to put on his jacket with trembling hands. Sherlock stood behind him, pressing his hips into John’s back.
John rolled his eyes and took a sip of his. “Thanks,” he chuckled sarcastically. He watched as Sherlock’s hand quaked when he brought the cup to his lips.
“Or did you actually mean for lunch?”
“I can be extremely abrasive.” John looked back to see Sherlock leaning heavily against the doorway into the kitchen.
John nodded and helped Sherlock toward the sitting room where he collected their spare medical kit and water that Sherlock immediately gulped down. Sherlock stumbled up the steps, but John held strong to him.
“Stop there,” he said urgently.
“Sure. Why not.”
“Tell me, John. Make me understand.”
“I’m not in shock.”
John stared at Sherlock’s blank expression. The bastard had gone and left him for his mind palace. John began to pull away when Sherlock focused and held onto his forearms.
“What’s going on?”
Sherlock faced him once again, eyes piercingly cold. “For once, you’re right.”
“Oh, dear, you’re in such bad shape, Sherlock. How about I make you a cuppa? Maybe it will settle you.”
He closed his eyes against the blinding sun.
“You’re going to eat.”
There was nothing in the room but the sound of their heavy breathing. Sherlock glanced over toward the door and burst out laughing.
“I know I am not an easy man to be around, but you had managed to find a way.” Sherlock lifted his head. “It was relieving to not have to find another flatmate, especially one that was equally useful.”
“There,” John said with a kiss to Sherlock’s temple. Every mark was covered in salve and the deeper ones stitched. Sherlock wore only a pair of thin pajama pants as John looked over his back. John carded his fingers through Sherlock’s wet silky curls.
Sherlock pulled off John’s cock. “What is it,” he rasped, lips swollen red and slick. John urged Sherlock up by his arms and kissed him hard until he was dizzy from oxygen deprivation.
“When was the last time that you did?”
Sherlock’s cup fell to the floor.
“Keep your voice down!” As the walk past Sargent Donovan, John said awkwardly, “Sorry – it’s just, um, nerves, I think.”
“You’re bloody fantastic, Sherlock Holmes.”
John admired Sherlock’s perfect form haloed by the sunlight. He continued to play even with John’s presence making his skin prickle. Sherlock could feel the other man approaching. He tried his best to seem engrossed in his own music, but John wrapped his arms around his torso, and the bow screeched across the strings. John smiled into the middle of Sherlock’s shoulder blades. Sherlock held the violin and bow loosely in his hands, shivering into John’s kisses. The man was his ultimate weakness, but after last night, he remembered exactly why he pushed so many people away. As John’s hands slid down to his belt, Sherlock twisted out his arms and stood tall by the coffee table.
“Let me through!” John fought against two burly male nurses. “I’m a bloody doctor!”
John’s gut was never wrong.
“I successfully deleted it.”
Sherlock would never find out. That John was certain of. He could never know. It was hypocritical, yes, that John wanted Sherlock to divulge every aspect of his life, past and present, to him while he kept this a secret. It would burn a hole through his heart. The thick fog around his head would settle heavier on his shoulders.
“I had one of the guys run the number.” Lestrade passed a folded piece of paper into John’s palm, while Sherlock spouted the fine details of the case to Sally Donovan.
With blood-stained hands, John can't think of anyone but Sherlock, even Lestrade can see it. Sherlock comes to the realization that he and John will always go into battle hand-in-hand, so why the wait?
“Until you understand why that word would upset me.”
“He makes cocaine?”
“You’re rambling.”
Sherlock jumped down and closed both doors to the flat. He was just about to enter his room when he stopped. The vial was growing warm his hand. He wanted to be rid of that violent memory of John, but maybe he shouldn’t. That rage was part of John, and he wanted to remember every piece of him. The smell of his own blood overtook his nostrils. Nausea washed over him. Sherlock pressed his forehead to the cool wall. No, he didn’t want to remember John like that, he decided, and swallowed the bile rising in his throat. His grip on the vial and syringe tightened as he turned for the stairs to John’s room.
“Understood?”
Hands gripped the sides of his face. His chest ached so much. He reached up and felt those familiar steady hands.
Sherlock quickly tucked himself back into his trousers and replaced his coat. He was mouthwateringly attractive even looking like a disheveled shag. Without giving John time to make himself decent, Sherlock was already making his way toward the door.
“You’ve come to the wrong place, mate? I only sell the purest shit in London.”
“Forgot my bag,” he said, eyes quickly scanning Sherlock.
“When I went into your flat, I noticed you had an empty bedroom upstairs,” he stated matter-of-factly. Mycroft was silent as he considered this.
But those days were rare. Every waking moment, John swore he thought he saw Sherlock. Every tall dark haired man caught his eye and made his heart race. He would accidently order two takeaway meals, and save Sherlock’s favorite. Sitting at the microscope, he could almost feel Sherlock leaning over his shoulder and adjusting the knobs. After a while, John stopped going into the kitchen too, settling for teas and coffees from various cafés and Speedy’s next door.
kisses!
“You’ve got a visitor,” she said grimly.
“I’m just not as hungry as I thought I was,” he sighed. They took all of John’s food back home with them. John immediately went upstairs to his bedroom, not bothering with his jacket. Sherlock went back downstairs and knocked on 221A. Mrs. Hudson opened the door.
This whole cuddle lark is simply an experiment.
John’s mouth presses into a tight line, and Sherlock sees him trying to master his anger.
But that is something to consider another evening.
“You brat.
Sherlock waits.
He has steady hands, and an even steadier manner.
He never stops talking about you, and you two have had such a night, haven’t you.
“Anxious?”
He goes for the vest next, spares no time in pulling it off over John’s head.
“Chicken cordon blue and potatoes gratin.”
He’s wrapped up warm, on John’s orders, and he had been feeling well enough today to spend some time on his hair.
He goes.
Fine.
He takes a deep breath and does.
I didn’t want to lose you.”
You started it.”
“Jesus, that’s…”
It looks like he has his face buried in his hands.
If you must.”
You smile whenever you talk about him, did you know that?”
That’s sure to cut the mood.
The sheep lets out a bleat, and John cocks a brow.
Never seemed to be in any kind of trouble.
He has no doubt he could get it up again in an instant if need be.
She nods.
He strides over and snatches it up.
Where are you going to fit me?”
Okay.
“Come on,” John murmurs as they both right themselves.
John pulls the blankets up over them again, and listens to a single ambitious song bird herald a dawn that is still well over an hour away.
John had been right.
“You okay?”
“You mind adding in a bottle of that, mate?”
He feels John grin against his skin, and then he is kissing him again, a deep press of lips and long glide of tongue that grows closer to his cleft with each pass.
You’re taken care of, but I still have to support me and Rosie, and…”
John sighs and pinches at the bridge of his nose.
He’s just about to sit back down when he decides he might as well get back into bed.
His head starts to throb in earnest.
His eyes widen a little as he peels back the tissue paper.
Sherlock steps over his legs, and then crouches down beside him.
The blindfolding you, tying you up?”
Sherlock takes another careful sip of tea.
The traffic outside is a whisper.
I’m desperate.
God knows what was growing on the walls of that cave.”
John shudders and sighs.
Some of his ease is slipping.
“You seem defensive, John.
“Sherlock.”
“Okay?”
John glances up at him, pauses for a moment, a calm breath in the midst of the maelstrom that has been his morning thus far.
John swallows tightly.
Catered to the
“What?
“She’s experienced odder things.”
He is shocked at the surge of desire that races through him, the way it prickles over his skin like an impending summer storm, an almost irresistible urge to surge forward, to press his face there, breathe deep, breathe him in, take him in, taste.
“Then I’m staying.  Go get us some coffee.”
“John!”
So good.
A wave of anxiety crashes over him, but when John doesn’t pull away, doesn’t try to leave, but only curls in closer, Sherlock feels some of it dissipate.
“My dad was… Mum killed herself.”
Right.
“You dream of me?”
“Do you acknowledge that it did.”
“Then I fail to see why one should wait.”
He could read for awhile…
“Bed.
He can hear a car coming slowly up the road behind him.
John blinks in shock.
It’s novel and new, this.
Sherlock sighs.
Sherlock asks.
“Mm, yes.
Right.
At the furthest most reach of the beam, the light catches two figures.
Angelo’s, maybe?
“I’m not okay, and I’m getting worse, and I’m not fit to look after her.”
He swallows, licks his lips, and then looks up at John from beneath heavy lids.
“Mmm…”  The only response he gets.
You blacked out?!
“Shall I give you a blow job?”
He lifts the glass into the view of the camera, takes a sip and sets it down again.
“It’s not a game, John.”
I can assure you, the NHS isn’t in the habit of hiring pre-teens.
Yes you mentioned it the other day.
He sees the moment John concedes.
She offers him a sympathetic smile in return.
“Thought you hated the country.”
“North Korea?”
John drops to his belly on instinct and scurries along the ground until he reaches the cover of some low-lying holly bushes, and is able to stockpile a few snowballs beside him.
Sherlock’s eyes drag down John’s body to settle on his crotch.
There’s the…
And suddenly he realises that the voice is outside rather than inside his head, and is calling his name, here in the middle of London where he knows no one.
“Good.”
“Really, Sherlock?
“Why are you here?”
“I do like it…”
“Make yourself at home, gentlemen.”
When he gets no response to that either, he gets up, steps into his pyjamas, yanks the duvet off the bed (let him freeze), and stomps out to the lounge where he flops onto the sofa and listens to the soft hum of late night traffic outside.
Sherlock looks down.
“Whatever is wrong?”
“Okay.”
“She kissed me.”
“Yes.”
“Right.
The other day, what we shared, it was—a revelation.”
Sherlock pulls his hands from John’s, stroking the top of John’s thighs as he stands up.
I suppose you’ll do the same given half the chance.
It’s petulant and hopeful all at once.
Please.
“John.”
He’d gone and had a cool shower, dealt with it swiftly and efficiently.
“Okay…
And she had been right really.
“Because I wanted to.”
It’s true.
Sherlock’s eyes slide open, heavy-lidded, he’s flushed all over and glistening with sweat.
“Just had a feeling.
“What?”
“John.”
“I don’t know how to…”
They’re happy.
“I’d say you’re just in time.”
Sherlock pulls out a chair and sits down across the table from her, and John turns to get him a cup of tea, returns, places it in front of him, and then stays standing, just behind, a hand on his shoulder.
Sherlock hears the scrape of chair legs against wood, hears John settle into a chair behind him.
“John.”
The top floor has two bedrooms and a decent sized bathroom for such an old house.
That was harder for my sister, and I get why she left when she did, and I—I don’t blame her, but it was worse after she left because he was angry about her and her girlfriend, and angry about her defying him and running away, and he didn’t have her to take it out on, so he took it out on me and mum, and because I didn’t want mum taking the brunt of it, it mostly ended up being me.
You know that.
“You do realise that this film is likely much longer than the forty-five minutes, or so, we have left.”
John sinks all the way down and hisses, and then stills, and Sherlock’s entire consciousness pulls in with laser focus to that one point, to the place where they are joined, and John is around him, hot, and slick and tight.
“Ahh…”
I mean it,” Sherlock pouts, when John seems to hesitate.
“God.”
“Yes.  A few times.”
“Are beginning to do things to undermine this thing between us, and…”
“Yes.”
The wave of nausea passes, but the pervasive sense of dread remains.
He swallows again.
Sherlock nods.
“John.”
He sucks in a breath that seems somehow too deep and not deep enough, and he sees something like revelation dawn on John’s face.
John stuffs the letter in his pocket and heads out the door to the offie on the corner.
“Just continue on this road?”
There’s no preamble.
“Mm.”
Sherlock tosses rather violently for a moment or two, occasionally punching the pillow to fluff up the down, but mostly to telegraph to John how unsatisfactory the sleeping situation is, how very much he needs…
He places a hand on Mrs. Roundhay’s back and leads her back toward the staircase, but turns and comes back to whisper urgently in Sherlock’s ear.
And there’s the look again.
Sherlock
He’s holding up two different shirts against a forest green jacket.
“Not when he’s angry.”
“No, he wants them.”
The damage is done.
I should go back to my flat.
Come on.”
Tutting like John is a misbehaving child, and John struggles a little, because he wants to, because it feels like Sherlock wants it, and Sherlock only smirks down at him.
“It’s nice.”
He wants to feel the heat of Sherlock’s hands against his skin, the whisper of his long fingers against his belly.
“Jesus, I thought MI6 was supposed to be—I don’t know—organised.
And John comes, without further hesitation, as though glad the decision has been made for him.
John couldn’t help but stare at those brilliantly sharp blue eyes. They were glacial in color, but as Sherlock turned his gaze toward the good doctor, John swore he only saw warmth. Their hands hovered close to each other on the seat. The cabbie glanced in the rear-view mirror to only see the two men staring intensely at one another. The turned back to the road and muttered “freaks” to himself.
Tears prickled behind Sherlock’s eyes when a red Irish setter came around the corner with ears flattened and teeth bared. Sherlock grit his teeth. Redbeard stood loyally in front of John, poised to attack. Sherlock had to push down the sob welling up in his throat.
John let his eyes close. “What if I tell you that it doesn’t matter how you say it as long as you do say it?”
“Another apology followed by a reason why everything is my fault,” Sherlock stated.
“I kept a newspaper clipping of you folded into a tiny square under the sole of my shoe. When I managed to find a place to sleep, I would set it beside my head and imagine that you were there next to me. It is what kept me grounded the most, I think. I had another version of you in my mind, of course, but he would always call me a prat, and well, the photo of you never did that,” he laughed quietly, eyes drifting to the marks on his forearm. “I do regret trying to forget you. I tried so hard after that night. You were so cross with me, and I thought that after telling you about the child, you would never be able to love me or think I was brilliant. The only thing I wanted to do was forget that you were the most important thing to me.”
Right before they closed both doors, John stepped forward and demanded he go along.
“Well done, John!”
Ahead of him, a homeless man huddled in blankets under a shop canopy with an upturned scraggly hat next to him. John reached into his pocket for some loose change. Just as he was about to bend to drop it in, the man glanced up at him with a steely glare.
“That’s because you say everything on that bloody mind of yours.” Lestrade sat back in his desk chair. “I know it must’ve been hard for you to share that with me, and I really appreciate that you came to speak to me about it, rather than going off on some binge or getting yourself into alleyway chases.”
“What happened with Sherlock?” John couldn’t sit there any longer and bolted out the car. Lestrade jumped out after him.
John didn’t realize how intensely he was staring until a cabbie honked outside. He snapped out of his trance and moved back into his living room, unaware of how far he had been leaning out his window to observe the odd stranger. He would go back to his previous residence to gather the rest of his clothing. Not much, of course, but there was still some jumpers left to retrieve, and how could his landlord say “no” to a wounded ex-army doctor?
, John repeated to himself.
The man behind him walked in front of him. Despite looking like a soldier, his slumped shoulders suggested otherwise as he held up a syringe to the spot between Sherlock’s fingers.
He ended their visit with a prescription for amoxicillin and said he goodbyes to his patient. Sarah gently rapped on his door again.
“That was never real.”
It was the end of them. They would not solve crimes together. John wouldn’t leave gentle kisses against his skin or call him brilliant or even stay in the same flat as him. Sherlock had ruined it, just like he always did. John would call Mycroft, and he would be sent off to another rehabilitation center where they would question his mental stability and whether or not he really wanted to get sober again. Lestrade would ban him from crime scenes, and Anderson would be relieved to never have to submit to Sherlock’s wishes again. Everything would be taken away from him, and all because he needed an extra kick to rectify his mind palace. Certainly John would understand. It was his fault to begin with. He was the initial reason why Sherlock sought Victor in the first place. The rest just had to happen to clear Sherlock’s mind.
“Maybe we can knock out more after dinner,” John offered. Sherlock shrugged. John pressed kisses along Sherlock’s shoulder and neck. “Or,” John started, leaning up into Sherlock’s ear, “We can try something different, if you’re so inclined.” Heat sparked in the center of Sherlock’s chest. He had wanted this before, didn’t he? He had spent nights in Serbia dreaming of John’s touch, and when he had returned and a relationship outside of John’s marriage bloomed, it was all he could think of. The cocaine had always increased his. . .
In the late afternoon they make their way down to the rocky shore, stroll side-by-side and listen to the waves wash over the gravel.
They lie there for so long the light in the room changes.
And now John is letting him just walk away, letting him make it easy, like he always does.
Best not to leave him waiting any longer.
He wants to say something, to ask, but…
“I don’t want it to be.
John’s eyes have adapted well enough now, that it is clear that it is the shape of person.
“You pull me in closer.
“There you go.
“I just—I guess I never really thought about you wanting any of this at all, so I…”
“You were right.”
Sherlock scrambles off him, settles into John’s chair, and shivers as John crawls into his lap in the same position he had just been in.
It makes him look young, and besotted, and all the things that John never thought to see on the face of a man looking back at him.
“John and I have to leave now.
He chuckles.
John grins.
Moriarty takes a few steps closer to Sherlock, and John feels himself coil tight, prepare to act, in a blink, if needed.
Sherlock has pulled the sofa over closer to the telly, and is curled up in one corner, wrapped in his afghan, still clicking through one channel after another, one leg bouncing frantically, even though he’s got it curled mostly under himself.
I’ll do better.
“I can’t believe you forgot to set the fucking alarm.”
John glances down at Sherlock’s cock, and reaches for the lube, puts a bit more in his palm, and returns to what he was doing before.  “Thought the first time, I could maybe—set the pace?”
“How long ago did you take the last dose?”
What, really?
John is chewing on his lip, occasionally rubbing a hand down the thigh of his bad leg.
“What do you mean, it seeps out of me?
He shouldn’t.
“Sorry about today.”
A few more inane pleasantries are exchanged, but Sherlock hears none of them, because John’s neck is slowly flushing around his collar, and Sherlock is rapt.
Sherlock pulls back, and looks down at him, cheeks flushed pink, eyelids heavy.
“You’re at the zoo?”
“I’m serious, Sherlock.
A siren races by in the street.
“I am sure that we will have much more to tell you in the next day or two,” he assures the headmaster as only John seems able to.
I really do.”
“Yeah, or maybe family, or someone, owned it after them, but they just left all their stuff here.
It’s easier in the dim glow from the dying embers in the hearth, curling up next to John, sharing one pillow, so close he can feel John’s breath on his lips again, remembering that morning, and then all that had happened when they got back from their excursion.
“Ahh, wee girl.
Sherlock snaps and pushes past him to flop down in the nearest chair.
Sherlock leans in closer, and John feels his body explode with pleasure.
“Mmm.
We should be out of here in just a bit.”
“Move.”
It always ends badly, always him, always his fault, and he likes Sherlock, he really likes him.
“Tell me what you want?”
He’s never felt he has anything to worry about.
This means Sherlock doesn’t have a clue, and the petulant tone is in full swing now.
Not a care in the world.
“Hadn’t really thought about it.
“Palace?”
“Around both of us.
Yeah.
What?”
“I miscalculated.”
Sherlock is smiling down at him in the half-dark.
“You look gorgeous.”
You thought friends in general were a danger to him.
“What—what do you want?”
He looks, and Sherlock lets him look his fill, let’s him reach up and graze the back of his fingers over his ribcage, lets him walk around behind him, take in the map of old scars on his back, trace the roads they make, wrap his arms around his waist, press his face between his shoulder blades and cry.
“Would rather stay down here.”
“Fine.
It’s Sherlock who has to drop his eyes, first.
You should eat too.”
Of course.
Thought I’d gone back in time to that first year we were living together, there, for a minute.”
John scowls.
“I think—I think I am.”
John draws closer, slipping a leg between Sherlock’s, and tucking his head back beneath his chin, like he’s getting ready to hear a bedtime story, something he rarely if ever had the pleasure of doing even as a boy.
He’s not.
His phone buzzes on the desk beside him, and he picks it up.
“Maybe.
“That, Dr. Watson, is none of your concern.”
“How do you know?”
Up until just recently I’d had a good long run of things not working the way they should.”
“Yeah.
He pulls slow, savouring the pleasure racing down and pooling at the base of his spine as he wanks himself slowly, watches Sherlock watch him, slack-jawed, and half drunk with pleasure.
“This isn’t a cuddle session, John.
It’s not the ‘
How the hell was I supposed to know he would take it so seriously?!
John whimpers, but it doesn’t sound like pain, more like—relief.
Sherlock gifts him with a smile.
There is a small red dot beside the Messages icon, and so he stretches, sits up a little, and clicks.
Sherlock whines into John’s hair, and wonders for a moment, how he, of all people, could be capable of making such a sound.
John looks pleased with himself, and Sherlock gives his hand a squeeze.
“What did you say?”
Sherlock’s eyes flick up to meet his for a moment and then return to the task at hand.  “Is it?”
Sherlock’s cheeks are scarlet red, and his hands are shaking as he attempts to work the small buttons into place.
It’s three days later, after John has been released from the hospital, and set up on the sofa at Baker Street with telly, and tea, and a very attentive Mrs. Hudson, that Sherlock finally goes to see his brother.
“Don’t have any of my things.”
He sees a muscle in John’s jaw twitch.
“That’s a big change.”
Next time you want to make what I assume was at least a half million pound purchase, maybe we could talk about it first.”
Her words seem to hit a nerve.
Tried.
After a moment or two she curls on her side, lays her head in his lap and sticks her thumb in her mouth.
I’m drenched.
Take it slow.
Do you want me to make some coffee.”
Just the way you did the night of our first case.
He wants it, so why say ‘no’?
“Not particularly, Sir.” Clive pipes up.
He practically launches himself into the backseat to find the lube in his overnight bag, and proceeds to give Sherlock an earth-shattering hand job where he sits, while simultaneously wanking himself to completion in the drivers seat beside him.
The other professors will be there as well.”
“You don’t have to tell me about it, just—like I said last night, when it gets to be too much, tell me.
Sherlock steps closer.
You keeping me now?”
“Doesn’t matter.”
This isn’t flirting.
It takes a little doing to get the ring over Sherlock’s knuckle, but once he does, it fits perfectly, and he’s rather pleased with his own deductive skills at guessing the size.
“It’s going well.
“Soldiers now.
Sherlock wonders why he feels like he’s going to cry.
Ella looks up.
John laughs outright, and Sherlock chuckles along with him.
John’s eyes drop away.
Even Ella sits back a little at the force of John’s response.
He’s dreamed of this, breathing in John’s scent while his cock drags along his cheek, over his lips.
It won’t help anything if he loses it now, collapses into a pathetic, slavering mess out here in the open where Sherlock’s meddling arse of a brother probably has a million eyes.
Movie night, as soon as you’re up and about.
John lets his own hand wander downward, rubs his hot palm against his straining abdomen, feels the fire build as the backs of his knuckles brush against his cock, as he tenses, lets the ache build, and build, releases again.
* The abuse in question is and never will be described in any kind of detail.
“We don’t need them.”
John settles back into bed.
Sherlock just shakes his head.
“For what?”
“Good, then let’s eat.”
Honestly, I thought no one would even see it, so it was a bit of a shock.
Sherlock is grateful to see him eating.
It’s something.
She lets you see her face, nice blue eyes, a light smattering of freckles over her nose.
John’s eyebrows retreat all the way up to his hairline.
He opens his mouth like he might refute him, but then he stays silent after all.
His heart twists.
“Here you go.”
He’s in a strange bed—Sherlock’s bed.
“Christ, you’re a sight for sore eyes.
“Why?”
He does, he tries at least, because Sherlock is asking, and there are his eyes, a place where John can either drown, now, or float, calm and buoyed up by Sherlock’s hands (on his face, on his arms, holding fast and firm).
He slides off his lap, and Sherlock notices he’s half hard.
“It’s still very early.
“You can wait one minute.
Sit down.
“Right.
Why would any pub be closed at three in the fucking afternoon?!
Good.
He laughs at the gorgeous absurdity of it all, lying here in the dark, covered in more come than a man his age should be able to produce, he thinks, nearly delirious in the afterglow, and the only catalyst was the voice of a near stranger in his ears, and an inexplicable love in his heart, and a willingness, a willingness to finally, finally let it happen.
He turns his back on Sherlock and peruses the rows of tinned soup.
“Back before everything.”
His skin prickles, mouth goes dry, abdomen clenches…
“Yes.”
But tonight—tonight he had been foolish, and if John hadn’t come along…
“Yeah, yeah, okay.
Moriarty grins.
He rolls over onto his side, and takes John with him.  John makes a small sound of objection, but then yields and actually tightens his grip when Sherlock wraps his arms around him and pulls him close.
“You’re gorgeous.”
“‘M not.”
John’s thumbs stroke the length of Sherlock’s pinkies.
You’re recovering.
Usually it’s case related chat, or the weather, or light banter about something on the telly.
“Pretty fucking sure.”
Alone in this dismal flat arguing with himself.
A fucking ray of goddamned sunshine is what he is!
He grins and John finds himself grinning back, huffing out a laugh, and shaking his head.
“A bit.
Sherlock watches him pick around his plate, his hands shaking now and again.
John drains his glass, and brings a hand up to cover his eyes.
“Warm, buttery, cinnamon-sugar toast.”
He hopes they’re somewhere far away.
Why, Sherlock?
“About what?”
She looks at John.
John’s voice is soft, and fond.
“Mmm.
Sherlock forces his eyes open at that, forces himself to meet John’s gaze, reaches up for his face, pulls him down, presses their foreheads together, presses his lips to John’s cheek, just one side of his nose, and feels John melt.
Sherlock’s voice breaks a little in the middle.
He sits up, opens his eyes, and stares across the garden.
It’s hard to tell all the way out in the lounge, but it almost sounds like profanity.
Sherlock strides forward and takes it.
“What?”
Well, that had been more of a futon, too.
“Don’t be ridiculous.
“I’m leaving.”
“You never told me that.”
He takes a cab.
“I don’t know.
John’s hand slips over Sherlock’s thigh, and Sherlock’s eyes snap open.
“Listen, can you either get in or put something on, because this is…”
“I’m sorry if I woke you.”
John has to look away; still not used to Sherlock occasionally being so forthcoming with his regard.
He’s trembling all over, head to toe, he’s drenched in sweat, he’s overcome and it’s heaven.
John’s breathing slowly evens out, but Sherlock can’t sleep.
“I don’t care about any of that.
“It hasn’t,” Sherlock whispers.
John is wearing a cotton vest under his shirt.
He can feel the tension of those muscles now, the way John holds himself up, holds himself
This is a man who is a hero.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything.  John has long projected his desires onto Irene Adler, something worth considering, but not tonight.
Sherlock splays a hand over his back.
You said you know I don’t do that, but I do.”
John loves Sherlock.
Mycroft arches a brow.
And if anything, Sherlock thinks his brother sounds impressed.
“He seemed to know your brother.
Sherlock’s brain whispers like rushing water.
“Glad to hear it.”
He leaves his brother behind, goes deeper
Sherlock feels mildly chastised.
He can feel how he fits neatly in Sherlock’s cleft even though there is the thin cotton of his pants, and the thin cotton of Sherlock’s pyjamas between them.
But that was over two years ago, and none of it seems very worthwhile anymore.
“Just listen to me, okay.”
It was—good, John. I’m glad you said it.
“I have thought about it.
“Lie back.
It wasn’t abnormal.
“No?”
Hours during which John will need to find a way to occupy himself.
You know the rules.
“Let me undress you.”
“Am I not allowed to take care of you?”
post-war radiators and fireplaces or wood-burning stoves.
The case?
“It’s just a half-mile from the sea, a 20 min walk to the cliffs, a mere jog to Eastbourne and easy drive to Brighton.”
The sun is shining, the world looks like a jewel box of ice and snow, and he feels better already.
“And I would let you, I imagine, but not here.
“This time, when things got too big, was it because of how I handled things at our last session?”
Her prescription: eat bread, bath with salt, sleep with someone you trust, and you’ll feel better.
One of those types who was born into wealth and then ended up hard up on his luck, and was never quite able to accept that.
“Up until recently—no.”
He hesitates when he sees it.
Sherlock’s finger’s curl in the fleece, nails on skin.  John feels it, thinks he feels it, over his chest, grazing his nipples.
And how is it that this man has agreed to share himself in this way?
“Okay.”
He takes a bracing mouthful of tea to quell the emotion, burning the roof of his mouth in the process, before finally turning away, and going back into the lounge.
But it’s a kid thing, right.
John shakes his head, buries his face in Sherlock’s neck, and moans.
Civilian life wasn’t suiting.
There is a furrow of worry between his brows.
Now who’s impatient, Jesus.
He walks back to the other side of the bed, pulls off his belt, and toes off his shoes, but leaves the rest of his clothes on as he crawls onto the bed and pulls the bedspread up from the foot of the bed, to cover himself.
John twitches against his thigh again, not even moving, and surging with desire.
“No dreams?”
Well, I’m thanking you again.
This isn’t one of your amateur little puzzles.
I have a flat.”
“Show me, John.
But if she was secretly involved with one of them, you would think she would be in London where they’re being treated, not all the way out here, lurking about the lanes and meadows.”
Sherlock feels a bit thrown off.
“Think I’m getting sick.”
John’s mouth forms into a thin line.
It’s quiet, wholly quiet.
“Yeah.
“I’m not entirely sure that’s the sort of work out she had in mind, though it did involve both cardio and weight bearing exercise.”
When it grows dark outside, they retreat to the bedroom again, and lie close in the dark, breathing the same air, sneaking their limbs as close as they dare to share body heat.
“But why on earth would Lord Saltire do such a thing?”
There was an accident.
“Hey…”
“And you were late picking her up, too?”
Mrs. Hudson gives his arm a light squeeze.
Next one…
Sorry.
Sherlock gives a knowing grin and a nod, and John smiles back.
For what?
“I know, John.
We’ll help.
“The shops!”
Getting dressed, or…”
“Then do.”
“Good.”
“And I could be the death of you.
“More.”
“Mmm.
Nothing hard.
He strides over and offers her the box.
Sherlock knows this.
When they get to the room and the bellhop has left, John looks at the opulence surrounding them, and bursts into a fit of giggles.
Oh, the hunger is definitely there, but the way Sherlock looks at him in moments like these, is intimate, a little shy, something almost like awe.
“I wanna.”
He nods, strokes his hands up Sherlock’s legs and down again.
Is that the secret?”
“Usually we hear the door creak when he comes in or out.
“You tired?”
John reaches out for him, but he pulls away.
“I mean everything.”
When John finally looks up, his eyes are red-rimmed and his eyelashes damp.
Come on.
The police will be here, soon. They’ll have some questions for you.
Sherlock turns and pretends to busy himself with something at the sink, listening as Mrs. Hudson descends the stairs.
Here, this you getting in your yearly charity contribution?
My life…”
“This.”
And he’s earned that, hasn’t he?
You got what you came for, now get out.”
He ran off and missed supper that night.”
Rosie has moved on to rooting through the shopping bags.
He tops up his wine and stares.
John’s finger stirs against his.
“What?
“What would work for you?
Three buttons undone, revealing just a tease of chest and hint of long pale throat, before the rest disappears out of frame.
John is getting up out of his chair.
“How do you want me?”
Sherlock walks over and sits down beside him.
John bites down on the inside of his cheek and goes to fetch it.
He stumbles and almost drops his phone, but recovers his footing and continues on, blindly, not even sure if he’s headed in the right direction, but he can hear footsteps slapping against wet stone behind him, so he knows he’s not alone.
“Tea?”
John remembers to breathe, he turns his head, opens his eyes.
He’s scrambles up, hurries to the loo, strips his sheets and pillowcase, and shrugs hurriedly into some pyjamas before ringing Sherlock back.
John a raging wildfire of passion unleashed.
In the meantime you will stay where you are and keep out of it.”
Christ, I love you.
He’s fully clothed except for his bare, flagging cock hanging sadly out the flies of his trousers.
“Okay…”
“Yes.”
And when Mrs. Roundhay sent me the news, I—I knew it was him.
Slow.
That’s all.”
“Of course.”
“This one’s never seen the sea.”
“I can’t go back to what we were, Sherlock.
“Why?”
John thrusts against the mattress, and Sherlock follows him down, but when he arches back up again, he stays put, his tongue plunging even deeper.
But you can call me William.”
John huffs and tilts his chin down, blows warm air through his clasped hands and onto Sherlock’s.
Sherlock has become a man obsessed, possessed.
A notification alert sounds for John’s Messages.
“But it can be.”
John asks.
Sherlock snorts and then takes another bite of toast and washes it down with a sip of tea.
“A child is missing, John!”
“Mmm.
John hits the pause button.
John looks stunned, and Sherlock suddenly realises just how much he’s let show.
He shrugs.
“Peppermint?”
John looks sincere and slightly troubled.
“Oh, so if I suddenly shuttered the door on all this, if I—I—suddenly retired to the country, you’d still be here, you’d still be happy?!”
You need anything?”
He takes some more pictures, trying to think like Sherlock, trying to do as he’d said and see the valuable, the telling, the important in the seemingly insignificant.
It’s barely a whisper.
“Sherlock, I don’t know what you’re trying to say.”
My prior objections were ill-founded, and—they were about me.
Sherlock isn’t hard, himself.
And when you touch me, and I get..
This is as much John letting go as the orgasm that gripped him only moments before.
He nods toward the vista spread out below them: rolling, brilliant-green farmland threaded through with ribbons of trees and dotted here and there with small, stone villages and snowy flocks of sheep.
You—you’re so fucking beautiful.”
He is.
“You’re having second thoughts.”
You provide a service, then.
“Mmm, Freud?”
True, John is strong, the doctor and the soldier in him used to death and loss, and it is likely he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and got on with life in very short order after Sherlock left.
He really does need to stop just blurting things.
Sleep now.”
It’s difficult for me, John.
“Christ, I’m late.
“Don’t be stupid. It will be fine.”
The mattress shifts.  He can feel John prop himself up on one elbow, to stare down at him, though he can barely see a thing.  “I’m not angry.  I’m—curious.”
And John’s voice is soft in a way that Sherlock hasn’t heard in years, not since before he’d left, before everything fell apart between them, and he isn’t sure if John is talking about this, here, the drug, or if he’s talking about the whole of them, everything they are now after losing so much, after almost losing everything.
“Oh, right.
You want me to stay in these clothes?”
“Jesus.
“You can’t promise.
“No!”  Sherlock pulls back to look up at him, face pale and mouth set.  “I love you—
That was the best bloody sex of my life, and I have no idea how you…”
Alright.”
Two equal if different reactions to a very similar upbringing, he imagines.
John sighs and rolls his eyes heavenward.
John feels trapped.
Sherlock’s arse is warm even through the thick fabric of John’s trousers, and he arches his hips up again without thinking.
A few seconds later Sherlock’s phone buzzes in his pocket.
“Mmm.”
It’s not a requirement.”
“Maybe I should stay?
He lets his shoulder press against John’s.
John shrugs, fighting hard not to rise to the bait of Sherlock’s tone.
“No.”
He’s wearing a black collarless shirt and jeans Sherlock has never seen before, and has his hands shoved casually into his pockets.
Not asleep then.
Sometimes he takes his service revolver apart, cleans it, counts the bullets he has left, puts it back together, and then just holds it for awhile.
“Another storm is coming.”
Sherlock pulls back grabs John by the hips, and pushes him up toward the headboard, and then leans down, grabs his bound wrists, and ties them to it.
It’s—safe.
“Then, for God’s sake give it to me, so I can leave.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but the woman proceeds apparently unaffected.
It had taken all of two minutes, and then he had sat down again, and not moved and not spoken through the entirety of the rest of the service.
“Yeah, well…
John’s fingers are working their usual magic on his scalp.
I needed to see you.”
“Going up for Britain's next top baker, are we?”
The bed issue, Sherlock realises.
I stay above it all.
“Go lie down.
He looks around the homely little kitchen, at the sun outside, trying to break through the cloud, catching on the fine snow drifting down from the trees, and turning the whole world into a shimmering, diamond wonderland.
There’s nothing but pain, the red-hot sear of burning sand beneath his back, and the cool, grounding weight of James’ hand.
His eyes search Sherlock’s.
“Yes.”
“Did I?”
His eyes do open at that.
Sherlock sits up a little straighter, and lets go of his grip on his knees.
“Come on,” John grins crookedly.
The locals like to know.
Mrs. Hudson cries, and hugs them both, and John can tell that Sherlock is properly satisfied with the level of sentiment expressed, even if he pretends the whole lot of them are ridiculous.
“The night we made love over the phone.”
Mycroft takes a deep breath, and lets it out slowly.
“Why would you think otherwise?”
“Barely, and she’s getting older.
He’s not—not at all…
Infuriating really.
“Yeah.
Torn knees in his trousers, so a scuffle maybe.”
“Sleepy.”
“I’m pleased you think so.
Something shifts behind Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock sits up.
Sherlock knows he is fortunate to be allowed to stay here.  Some meddling of his brother’s no doubt. He’s grateful for once.  He can’t imagine what he would do if he weren’t allowed to see John, shut out, family only.
“I’m find.”
God, your hands…”
Are we required to know everything about one another just to share a flat?
It’s good hearty bread.
What do you think it was that did it, all those wives in far flung locales?”
Leona shows up this morning, a very attractive woman, a woman he obviously was acquainted with when in Afghanistan, and it’s only natural he should—have a reaction.
She blows a cloud of smoke out slowly.
John looks over at him.
“Tell me, can you feel that?
“Let me help.” John murmurs, letting go, and smoothing a hand over the unkempt riot.
Sherlock urges.
Sherlock sighs.
“May I?”
“It’s been wonderful.”
Sherlock blinks.
“Yes.
I just gave my landlord notice.
When he gets to the other side of the bridge, he hails a cab and heads home.
He feels a chuckle rumble through Sherlock’s chest.
He strains against Sherlock’s hold on his wrists, just enough to keep their mutual desire stoked high, but not enough to be interpreted as actual objection.
I love you.
John’s voice is rough.
John is surprised.
To bed.”
I—I’m sorry it’s not tonight.”
John stares out the window into the cold, clear night.
Honesty is the thing, okay.
“Is that a lung?
“It doesn’t.
It’s going to be okay.”
Anything I should know about?”
“I—yes, I…”
John still has his back to him.
I know you lo—, and I do, too—you, I mean.
“Wasn’t sure you missed it, really.”
John sighs.
And he doesn’t know why it’s happening now, why tonight.
“Yes, then.
You have done.”
He thinks he should worry about that.
He wants it.
You meant the agency, or…?”
And so John takes them, and they go.
John goes back to YouTube, presses play again.
“I’m real,” Sherlock assures him, sobering.
John’s weight, and scent, and breath corralling his frantic nervous system.
I think I never had to consider the ‘why’ of it.
This is what you do when you wanted to have sex with someone you fancied, and did.
He sleeps.
For everything.”
It’s gratifying to think that he would take offence at the weather, simply because it was thwarting Sherlock’s ability to solve the case in a timely manner.
This is not at all the response Sherlock had been anticipating.
He pours himself a drink, hears Mycroft’s voice echoing in his head, and tops the glass up a little more.
I will.
“There is, as a matter of fact.
The memory of it is what carried me through all those months away, and I’ve been wondering…”
Sherlock states stupidly as he joins them on the landing.
Might think I’m a bit—I don’t know…
And Sherlock’s body pulls him deeper still.
It’s something he’s sought for years to avoid, and he’s done well.
Angelo’s prices are reasonable, but he figures that he should be clear about the arrangement.
That last case was…”
Yeah, okay.”
A man, not a child, Sherlock observes with a flood of relief.
“Give it a minute.
Each stroke leaves him more and more like jelly.
“Tell me.”
“Do you want me to stop?”
Perhaps that had been why it had been binned.
Sherlock’s eyes flutter open at that, pupils wide and dark.
I know.
“Feel better?”
, whatever it is, will have to take a back seat.
John sniffs, and balls a fist at his side, under the table.
“You should talk.”
He frowns at John’s back.
Sherlock’s chest is flushed as pink as his cheeks.
John cracks an eye open, and stares up at her.
“Was it okay?”
And then Sherlock’s hand is wrapping around his cock, giving a long, languorous pull, and John drops his forehead to Sherlock’s chest with a strangled sound he’s fairly sure he’s never made before in his life.
I’ll keep an eye on it.”
“What would you like it to look like?”  It’s low and quiet. There’s really no need.  They’re all the way at the top of the house. There’s no one to hear.  But the topic seems to engender a kind of reverence and care.
“Want more.”  John presses down a little more, stops, and then relaxes, taking Sherlock’s fingers all the way in.  He settles, breathes, and then his hand finally begins to work Sherlock’s cock again.
John teases, and then falls silent when Sherlock doesn’t banter back.
“I’m not stupid you know.”
Might be a bit of a lark.
He does it again, and watches John’s lips part, and when he reaches the top of John’s thighs the fourth time, he sweeps his thumbs in a crescent along the soft skin between them, and watches a slight bulge begin to form beneath the cotton of John’s pants.
“For more.”
“That so?”
“But you’re right.
John sniffs, and looks down at the knickerbockers with a frown.
Sherlock blinks.  “When…”
He looked frightful.”
“Go slow.”
I—I’ve no doubt.”
the only word Sherlock can seem to manage.
It’s flattering, I guess.
“No?”
“Much.”
“A surprise?”
If he was waylaid, there must be a reason.
He was still strict, still always insisting it was his way or nothing, but by the time I came along he’d started drinking just to get through the day, and he was outright drunk at least a few times a week.
Sherlock’s head pops up just below John’s chest.
She was pretty practical about patching us up, and we weren’t supposed to cry, just sort of keep calm and carry on.
You’ve seen my sister.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Sherlock huffs again.
They haven’t talked about that.
He sounds slightly defensive.
Stay.”
John slips his fingers out, and brings them up to his mouth.  Makes a bit of a show of slicking them up, and then plunges back down again, in again, and slides deeper.  Sherlock’s legs suddenly turn to jelly.  The burn, the stretch, the sensation of John pushing deeper, slowly, slowly, so achingly slow.  John’s breath is ragged, and Sherlock can feel him pressed hard and twitching against Sherlock’s thigh.
I can’t imagine anyone murdering her.”
“Oh.”
“He’s ended up being a bit more than a work partner, actually.”
A woman about his age approaches him as he stands in the middle of the stacks, no doubt looking completely out-of-place.
It crashes over him and pulls him under, drowning him, transcendent release, making his back arch up off the mattress, and his toes curl, and his rhythm around his cock, falters as he starts to come, so hard, and so much he probably should have thought it through, but fuck,
John’s thumb slides across the back of his hand, and he lifts his other to smooth through Sherlock’s hair.
I don’t know, maybe we tried to cover too much, today.”
Sherlock nods.
“This should go swimmingly.”
“Well, I suppose Watson and I can occupy ourselves with food.
What is there to say.
Truthfully, it’s mostly the boy he can’t get out of his mind.
And John can see the slump of his shoulders that he’s trying to hide, and the wetness building in his eyes just before he turns away, the way all the things she did to him, to them, vibrate through his body like a waking nightmare.
Sherlock grins and steps out onto the ice, circling the rink with a grace and ease that comes as no surprise, his coat sailing out behind him, scarf fluttering over one shoulder.
Her eyes snap to John and then back to Sherlock again.
John’s face does something Sherlock can’t interpret.
Sherlock?
“Yeah.”
As you may have noticed, we have called you here alone, there are no police present, John and I are your only judge and jury, and I can assure you that though excessively fair in all things, my John does have a strong romantic bent.
Christ…”
He still hasn’t managed to look Sherlock in the eye, and it’s starting to grow awkward.
it’s a heady thing, a thing he doesn’t want to take for granted.
He grunts in surprise and then moans in pleasure, thrusts faster, starts to move his finger inside.
Sherlock bites down on his lower lip, and John wants to kiss him so badly it hurts.
This feels more like—play.
“I imagine I may have made everything sound a great deal more serious than it is.
What would John think if he knew?
“I don’t want to do that again if we don’t talk about it, Sherlock.”
Ella suddenly asks.
I like the fantasy role play.
“Let’s take care of that, shall we.”
It takes them a little while, but they do eventually make it to the village square, and the small shop that is supposed to be there.
“Sounds more like a war zone.”
Gran was Welsh.”
John looks at the next question, reaches down and drains the rest of the whiskey in his glass in one, long pull, before beginning.
“Yeah you did.”
“John!”
“You know what the doctor said!”
“I thought he did, but he didn’t.”
Right then.
John adds, and Sherlock turns and looks at him.
John smiles.
John stares down at his hands and hates himself.
“At all?”
“Think we saved each other.”
A smile teases the corner of John’s lips, and he laughs outright when he sees Sherlock roll his eyes with a slight flush to his cheeks that probably has nothing to do with the warmth of the pub.
John reaches over his waist, finds the lube and slicks his cock, and hand, before pulling Sherlock back against him, and letting his cock slide deep in his cleft.
“John, when I told you that it was alright, whatever you wanted, needed, I meant that.”
He should be bloody ashamed of himself, because he knows what it was that spawned it, and he’s never let himself give into it quite like that before, and it was rather inconsiderate considering Sherlock’s lack of interest, but he’s not sure he regrets it at all, and he’s not sure how he should feel about that.
I guess.
What do I have to do?”
After everything?
We can—watch a film, or play a board game.
Hope you’ll come again.”
Was a bit worried for a while.
‘Course not.”
“You were the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.”
Fine.
You’ve been on the run all week, and if I didn’t know better I’d think you hadn’t slept or ate since Monday.”
Should we try to convince him?”
“You ready?”
Traffic is picking up.
Perhaps his brother was right after all.
“Just a dream.”
John wakes to the smell of sandalwood, vanilla and roses, to the sour taste of champagne on his lips, the slip of satin sheets beneath his naked body, and to the sensation of warm breath wafting gently against his neck.
John turns on the radio, flips through the channels for a moment or so, and then turns it off again, when he finds nothing to his liking.
But he gives no sign of waking.
“Rest now.
“I need you too.”
Sherlock agrees.
“There’s my good man.
Has to swallow down an emotion he doesn’t even understand.
Sherlock whinges, but turns into his touch at the same time.
I used to eavesdrop when she was talking to the neighbour ladies.
You need to let your brain and body heal.”
Reaching down, he slowly turns the handle and steps inside.
Of course I know what hockey
“Guess that solves that, then.”
After a moment, he drops his hand to the seat between them, and hooks his pinky over John’s.
“Pull.”
He smells fresh, like he’d showered not so many hours prior and has just now fully dried.
makes it sound like a stroll in the park, or a Spring day that’s warm in the sun and cool in the shade.
But they can’t, can they.
After a moment his eyes return to Sherlock.
John’s face does something strange.
Molly gets to her feet as they enter the lounge.
And there it is, the thing that still hangs between them sometimes, even now.
“What about it?”
He deserved to be safe, to feel safe.
Then let’s go there.”
He aches to…
“Mmm.
“That’s nice, Luv.
But it was one that had to be made, and I made it.
The naked part especially.
What I want to do.”
The thing inside Sherlock sighs, and rolls its eyes.
John’s tears are silent and contained, but he doesn’t push Sherlock away.
Sherlock is tempted to lie, to keep this one little thing to himself, but there is something about the way that his brother’s face has blanched, and his brows have knit together in something that Sherlock might almost interpret as worry in someone else, that makes him decide to be forthright.
“Ella Who?
He’s hardening against his palm, just like that.
John thinks it’s the maddest thing he’s ever done.
“It’s okay.”
My pleas fell on deaf ears.”
“I like you like this…”
“And yet…”
“Sounds perfect.”
He thinks of John standing on the bank of the pond earlier, a look of desperation on his face:
“Okay then?”
There’s a long pause, and John thinks—maybe this is it, maybe I’ve stepped over the line, and he’ll retreat now, and it won’t be me, won’t be my fault, not really (well maybe a little, well maybe a lot).
Sherlock’s brow smoothed out, a smirk playing at his lips. “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Upstairs, John had the windows to the sitting room open, a humid breeze flowing in and warming Sherlock. John had lent him an older jumper that he didn’t mind getting salve on to save Sherlock’s posh silk clothing, but he was still cold. The bath he took was painful. His body ached as he sunk into the warm water, feeling every lash on his body sting. John was hesitant to leave Sherlock alone in the bath, but Sherlock assured him that he could manage by himself. It would give him time to thoroughly wash himself of the dried semen between his thighs and cleft of his arse.
Sherlock sighed to himself and opened a box.
“She’s my wife though.”
“How bad?”
“Hm,” Sherlock hummed distractedly
Sherlock lowered his head a little and with a sigh, went to the fireplace, reached into it and produced a dark wooden box. He handed it to John while facing the windows.
Sherlock didn’t try to move as John threw the side table into the kitchen. He ripped the letter opener from the mantle and stabbed it into the wall over and over. Sherlock heard a pair of kitten heels climb the stairs and quickly intercepted Mrs. Hudson before she could enter the flat.
Sherlock smirked slightly. “I am a ridiculous man.”
Sherlock wanted to see John’s face change, of course, but for good things like a solved case, fresh warm bread at Angelo’s, and when they would kiss. He wanted to see what his face would look like twenty, thirty years from now, wrinkled from laughter and worry. Sherlock wanted to see all that on John’s face, but without a doubt, he did not want to witness the sadness and disappointment he would certainly see once he faced him.
The mystery of it is almost better than the knowing, but still…
He wonders how long a wait it might be.
“Oh yeah?”
This time I’m telling you the truth.”
He sees John understand.
Well, I just—wanted to tell you that…”
As always, thank you for reading, and thanks so much for your patience, as work and real life got uncharacteristically busy soon after I started writing this one.
“Arthur’s shirt was covered in blood, but he wasn’t bleeding anywhere.”
I just need to figure some things out.
“Stay here.”
Sherlock sucks in a deep breath.  “To ask if we’ve, as she so delicately puts it, ‘pulled our heads out of our own arses, and put them somewhere in the vicinity of one another’s’”.
John goes back to youtube, maximises the screen, and just stares for a moment, before pressing play again.
“I solved it.
John rolls his head against the cushion and glances around the small and homely space, mostly one room for cooking, eating, living, and then two bedrooms off the main area and one loo.  “What is this place?”
Besides, Greg told me he’s planning on proposing the Saturday before Christmas.
“Happened to me a lot after I got back from A.
John frowns, and cracks his eyes open, squinting up at Sherlock’s serious face.
He just sits and cradles John’s bloodied fist in his large, warm hands, and he waits.
John fishes it out of his pocket.
More Tolkien?”
“I believe he means when we are intimate.”
John had ended up snapping, and there’d been a row, which had involved Sherlock slinking off into a corner to sulk, and John grumping around the flat, confused and irritated for two days, before Mrs. Hudson had told them both that they were completely nutters, and that she wasn’t going to see them fall apart when they’d barely started, so they’d better pull their oversized heads out of their too-tight arses, and talk about it.
John goes back to eating in silence, after his plate is clean, he picks it up, and Sherlock’s as well, and takes them to the sink a few steps away.  “You think Mrs. Hudson still has the flat available, or will we need to find a new place?”
“I’m not leaving this room.”
“Oh.”
We’d best try then.”
“You’ve hardly anything to be ashamed of.”
“Yes.”
“Ahh, that must have been one of my brother’s people.”
“Yeah,” tight and raw.
John lifts his arms around Sherlock’s waist, and hugs him back.
He takes a deep breath.
They try not to do this, but it’s a strange house, and she’s got an adventurous streak.
All of it.”
“A girl is dead.”
He gets up and goes to the kitchenette, sets the mug and cereal bowl in the sink, and pours himself a couple of fingers of whiskey.
John offers.
“Hmm, and you’re sure you want it?”
John returns when the tea is made, two cups, one in each hand.
“Hey.
It was familiar, but it was also relatively safe.
“We keep running away from one another.”
“You okay.
John frowns.
It’s agony not touching, but beneath it all something else is starting to build, and he realises, as it grows, and grows, and grows, that this is it, this is what he hadn’t managed the last time.
If you like.
It will have to be enough.”
John replies knowingly, and doesn’t bother to probe any further.
“This isn’t funny.
“So you sought out a stranger for sex?”
“Then why did you call me?
“What?”
Now he seems—well, more himself.
I believe I’ve quite overwhelmed that oversized brain of his.
Once they reach it, they go their separate ways, John to the loo, and Sherlock in the bedroom to undress, and change into his pyjamas.
“So, you want to retire to the country with me, hm?”
He jumps at the sound of her voice, much closer than he’d anticipated.
Sherlock slaps his hands on the tops of his thighs and gives them a rub.
John is warm and already sticky with sweat.
He’s shaking.
He breathes raggedly against John’s ear.
“What?
Don’t mind.
There had been years where he could only dream of it, a secret fantasy he was hardly even willing to admit to himself and now, here they are, and here is Sherlock telling him he loves him like it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
“Why are you here?”
John frowns.
“For variety’s sake, let’s say yes.”
He looks.
“Last time I checked you don’t get to dictate the cases I take.”
The ten o’clock from King's Cross.”
“You love it.”
He waves a hand dismissively.
Not yet.
Freud’ll work.
It’s cocky and slightly shy all at once, and John loves him so much it physically aches.
“Oh for god’s sake.
“No.”
John reaches for him, pulls him down, until Sherlock settles onto his lap, straddling him.
“As long as…”
He lets it rest there for a moment, takes in the expanse of John’s back, the puckered, ruined flesh of the exit wound in his shoulder, the burn scars he had observed before.
“Jesus.
It takes Sherlock a moment to register that John in referring to the example he’d just used.
John picks around inside a container of red curry for a moment or two until finally digging in.
“If you need to go, go.”
“Probably would have passed out.
“Nice.”
“Wo—would you?”
He stares at the screen and waits.
He suddenly knows exactly what he wants in a white hot flash of brilliant clarity.
“Roll over.”
They lefd uth food.”
“Okay, but if I think you need to stop, I’m stopping.”
After several minutes his breathing slows, and deepens, and Sherlock keeps on, slow, gentle passes of his fingertips.
John nods.
“If I may?”
He opens an internet browser, and navigates to his blog.
“Good-morning, brother.”
“Jesus, Sherlock.
Stupid, to be so forthcoming.
Sherlock winces as he pulls himself up off the cold tile, John’s dressing gown falling gracefully to the floor, and then hurries over to the tub to tentatively dip a toe in.
He groans loud and long.
She stares at him, incredulous for a moment, and then laughs.
“You have two broken ribs and a broken nose.
I’ve been told I’m rather attractive. The director of the Tate Modern once described me as
John arches a brow suggestively, and Sherlock rolls his eyes.
He sounds petulant.
It’s just…”
John’s seen it before, in the eyes of dozens of men.
John ties the blindfold, and then steps back around, and instantly feels odd about it.
He shivers, and smiles softly to himself, before frowning.
“Sometimes I wonder if that’s why she shot you.”
“Now?”
“Okay.”
“Have I got TM rupture?”
“Fine.”
Sally just snorts after a moment’s silence, and waves her hand dismissively.
There are places in the world where marriages are still arranged, and people fall into lifelong unions with people they’ve never even met before the day of their nuptials.
His eyes snap open and his head drops, his eyes meeting John’s.
Sherlock must show too much, because John races in to clarify.
It could end everything.
Mine says PTSD.
He throws a couple of day’s worth of clothes into a satchel, rushes for the train station and just makes his train by a hair.
Sherlock can feel John’s breath, warm and moist against his scrotum.
They talked, and talked and talked.
Sherlock’s eyes snap back to the screen.
Great.
His cheeks are still pink, but he isn’t sure if it’s due to the shower or his cold.
“Ahh.”
Sherlock presses up against his side seeking out his fingers as the folds of his coat enfold them.
“Not sure, really.
“Lord Saltire, of course.
“As I’ve said.
“Get off!”
I’m just asking if you consider Sherlock to be a friend.”
And this fried rice might be questionable, but beggars can’t be choosers, I suppose.”
“Sorry?”
He doesn’t look at anyone else like that.
He can breathe the air John exhales between them, even as John inhales his.
Sherlock feels the pending question jolt through his body like a physical pain.
“Oh yes, we do.
You know how I hate public transit.”
Disgusted?
John reaches down, and wraps a hand around himself.
The water is up to John’s waist now, and the voice, the voice is drowning, but still John can’t seem to…
I’ll just show myself out.”
You’re slipping, and there’s nothing I can do about it, and I—I can’t stop thinking about what would happen if I lost you again.
“I can correct her, put a stop to it.”
“Look at me,” Sherlock says again, because John’s eyes have squeezed shut, and he needs to know, needs to be able to see him when he does what comes next.
But not before he caught you, it seems.
“It is.
“Quite exhausted, but my personal physician confirmed your assessment of last night.
“Fuck, John…”
Properly divested and comfortable, John walks back over to the bed, and traces a finger over the fabric of Sherlock’s pants.
be prepared, John.”
“And get naked.
John reaches down and fastens his seatbelt as Sherlock slowly accelerates and carries on his way down the snowy road.
It’s something languid and calm, like water lapping at the shore of a placid lake.
He adds as an afterthought.
“I know.”
It’s perfect.”
But you
I guess that means no new videos for awhile, yeah?
Maybe it’s the mirror-touch synaesthesia Sherlock had been talking about, but when he watches the videos where Sherlock pets, or strokes, or smooths things, it’s almost like he can feel it.
There was only a name—Moriarty.”
“Does it?”
John relaxes a little.
“You don’t have to answer that one, if you don’t want to.”
Don’t…”
This morning is no different, and John is scrambling to support himself against the counter, heat bursting, toes curling, a loud shout filling the small kitchen, in no time.
“People might talk.”
He takes a sip of coffee.
“Now, whatever it is you want to do to me, just be out with it, for God sake.
John looks up again, and Sherlock smiles.
Sherlock gets up, and strolls over to the sink, where John is slipping the mountain of mugs stacked beside it into the sudsy water.
“Yes.
They don’t say anything.
“Mmm.  I rarely answer, but she is persistent.”
“Not stalling.
Rose will love this.”
Sunlight and moonlight combined.
It’s forceful, firm, and sounds rather like a promise.
You’re clearly getting your feet under you.
If I’d known how dangerous he was, I never would have…
He would very much like to crawl back down into the inviting warmth of their shared bed, but it’s one thing in the dark, at night, when they are meant to be trying to sleep, and quite another, midmorning in a curtainless room, with no other motivation but the craving of warmth and companionship.
“Alright?”
“It has been too long.”
Muttered under his breath.
“I don’t see you that way.”
Right.
Lestrade fishes a donut out of the box in front of him and then hands the box across the desk to John, who takes one, and then leans back in his chair.
He’s like that these days, quiet and withdrawn much of the time, some days trembling with barely repressed rage that seems to rise out of nowhere.  Sherlock has learned to give him space, to diffuse it when it comes.
Sometimes he tastes the salt on John’s lips, and thinks of the taste of his own tears on John’s mouth, thinks of John’s inherent taste, a little like the sea, a little like fresh brewed tea.
I was wondering if you could pick Rosie up from nursery that day, and watch her until I get back.”
Sherlock’s thumbs trail through pools of come, leave slick, cool trails in their wake over his abdomen and hips.
“How did you know about this place?”
He’s right.
“Me too, if you haven’t noticed.
You walked, and you were wearing the same pair of trainers you are at present. You snuck up to the house through the side hedge, and threw the gravel in your pockets at the window until Tregennis opened it to you.
“What da you want?”
She looks up.
There are no doors, but it’s out of the snow and wind, and it will do.
“No thanks required.”
Think I’ll get up.
Sherlock chuckles.
People change, of course, but…
MARY.
“You’re shivering.
John doesn’t say anything to that, just stares, and then reaches out and gently squeezes Sherlock’s shoulder, before getting to his feet with a hiss of discomfort.
Order me about?
He nods and then sits back in his chair, stares down at his hands.
You were closer.
She seems completely unaffected.
John asks, beside him.
“It’s okay.
He feels keyed up and depressed all at once.
“She’s arriving tomorrow before we leave,” Sherlock mumbles into John’s t-shirt.
“Yes, in retrospect, I suppose I should have done.”
Mycroft sighs and digs the tip of his umbrella into the carpet, turning it in small circles.
John had sighed and propped himself up on one elbow, before patting the mattress beside him, and Sherlock had sat down, hands and the sides of his dressing gown folded primly in his lap.
John doesn’t know what to say, but he doesn’t have to think about it long, because Sherlock gets back up and goes into the loo again.
Sherlock drags his nose through John’s hair, down to his ear.
We hab to go!”
His choices are his, and this time—this time there will, of necessity, be consequences.
It’s okay.”
He wanders the streets and watches the birds flit and chirp in the bare, dripping trees hanging over the sidewalk, and stops to pet a drenched and miserable looking cat that clearly belongs to the house it’s in front of, but appears to have been forgotten outside.
The coals in the hearth have all but died, but they’ve forgotten to pull the curtains again, and there is just enough light that he can see the way John’s eyes search his in the dark, looking for answers, wanting to help.
He glances around them, and then pulls a pocket knife out of his coat, and scrapes a little from under the man’s nails.
“And just where do you feel that, mm?”
John has his head turned away from him.
The faux fur blanket is ridiculously soft, and warm against his chest, and abdomen.
Sherlock doesn’t argue, which worries him even more.
We have those nasal strips.”
“Very like.”
“For Christ’s sake, Sherlock,” John hisses.
And then John is outright giggling.
He curses himself as he strips swiftly in the dark, and pulls on the pants and t-shirt that make it almost impossible to sleep.
Didn’t realise it had snowed quite so much.”
A cool breeze drifts in from the sea, ruffling John’s newly cut fringe away from his still clammy forehead.
he lets John pull him back down into his arms, and press his lips to his forehead.
“Never thought that.”
“Think that’s pretty natural.”
He might not send it anyway.
“Of course it is.
“Just miss putting things up, I guess.”
“Yeah.
“Life’s never boring with you, Holmes.”
He grins and writes.
Something.
Yeah.
John turns back to the fridge, pulls out a carton of milk, and slams the door with a little more force than is probably necessary.
“I love you.”
“I need a shower.”
“Sorry.
“He’d gone cross-country.
He doesn’t understand it all.
Everything she told the press, that was just fiction.”
“Yes.”
So, go rest.
And John lets himself be stripped bare, grateful for the fire he’d built earlier, and which is still burning brightly in the hearth, as Sherlock sits up, cheeks pink and hair wild, and starts to divest him of his trousers as well.
John’s stomach flips, like he’s just stepped off a cliff into nothing but air and he’s hanging, suspended, for that microsecond before he starts to plummet.
I promise.”
“Yes.
He wills himself to calm the fuck down.
He doesn’t want to fight.
“That I’m supposed to ask for what I want.”
John huffs softly, and shakes his head.
I know that.
Stop being sorry.”
“Let go, Idiot.”
Stop stalling.”
I wanted out.
“I think this can work.
They sleep.
’Cause I’d be surprised, Sherlock; really I would.
It’s a matter of pride, almost, knowing that he can provide for him and Rosie, that he’s not burdening Sherlock with that, at least.
“I don’t know.
“What does that me—mean?”
He somehow manages.
And when Sherlock rolls onto his back, taking John with him, all he can think about is how it isn’t enough, how no matter how close, how much of Sherlock he can touch, feel, taste, it will never be enough.
Spent all his time at school, at the library studyin’, away from the house, then uni in London, then the army…”
“Noo!!”
There’s more talking there.
John grins.
“Right.
I’m here right now because you’ve bloody well told me what to do.”
But still, still he craves one thing, one thing he can no longer give voice to, and he hopes, beyond hope that John knows him well enough now, that they won’t need words.
“No.”
The room is growing lighter now, the muted, silver-grey of dawn, and John is looking at him, looking at him like he wants to unwrap him, to solve all the mysteries, deduce all the secrets, and then take him, vulnerable and raw, and keep him; pull him under his skin, shelter him beneath his ribs, mend together all the cracked and broken bits with little pieces of his own soul.
“Gorgeous.”
John is very still beside him, he suddenly realises.
“This morning I found out that he’s in hospital.
#love confessions, #first kiss
“Yes, I know, but these are specifically Daddy things.
“Yeah—in theory.
“It wasn’t meant as an insult.”
“Right.
Alright.
“You’re pretty, bloody good at this for someone who’s never…”
Sherlock’s warm, the hair at his groin slightly damp from having just washed, and his nipples are peaked and hard against John’s chest.
Hope it’s sunnier where you are.
“I’m never sure if it’s something you want, or whether you just—I don’t know—indulge me.”
“‘Course I want you to.”
He steeples them in front of his mouth.
He places a steadying hand on her arm.
“Dessert?”
John insists.
“So it seems.”
You made this mess—apparently.
“Wish someone had taped it.”
Cuddler?
Never been to the seaside in the winter, though.
You’ve promised.
“Figured we’re a bit young to spend the rest of our days taking leisurely strolls through the highlands.”
“Mum killed herself.”
“And it’s good to see you bundled up warm.”
It seems to go on forever, and Sherlock does begin to worry after awhile.
John nods.
“Are you hungry?
He licks his lips.
He presses and circles, while he strokes his cock, and it is almost too much.
“He’s not a stalker, I swear.
He will have to do laundry now, before John gets home, and then there will be the awkwardness if John notices, because Sherlock doesn’t do laundry—ever.
I knew what to expect.
“Oh, I love this one!”
* This is not something that features heavily in this chapter, but there will come a time in a later chapter when Sherlock will finally talk to John about it.
Not sure you’ve had enough of a taste to…”
“I don’t realise it, you know.
“Does it matter?”
No one else.
“It’s okay.
Wherever did you get them?”
There is silence behind John’s door.
People still commenting on his two videos, which seems like madness to him, but what does he know about social media?
John is lounging back in his seat with his eyes closed, when they finally get back to the car.
“Good.”
The video begins with a shot of the now familiar black, leather chair, and after a moment a set of legs appear, hop up onto the seat, and then the man himself sinks slowly into a cross-legged, sitting position, facing the camera.
But it’s adequate.
Just…”
But right now, John is here, he’s alive, and he needs him, and Sherlock would die before he would leave his side.
John rubs at the back of his neck and laughs that high-pitched giggle that is usually reserved for one of Sherlock’s more brilliant or humorous observations, and Sherlock narrows his eyes at the woman at the door as he comes up to stand behind him.
He spots Sally Donovan as he approaches the office, and sees an out.
“To family, then.”
Sherlock is still curled into the foetal position.
He’s better.
There’s a case, a good one.
“I know we were meant to meet in town, but I was lucky the trains were running at all, and then it took a miracle, and more than a few bribes, to get a cab here from Eastbourne, and I thought, ‘there’s no way poor Sherl will even make it out of the drive in all of this, so I thought I’d just come over.”
Where the hell did you go, anyway?”
“Now.
He slides over.
Should we go to bed, do you think?”
The flock of ducks turn in tandem, and start to swim back in their direction with a chorus of eager quacks.
John cries for a long time, and Sherlock holds him, and strokes his hair, and lets the tears join every other part of John’s body that had flooded his tonight.
Wasn’t expecting that.
Here, you sure you’re okay?”
He wouldn’t return calls.
John hums, and nods with a smile.
I’m drowning.”
Things are more complicated, more spontaneous; they don’t always go to plan.
He looks up and forces a smile.
“She's married, isn’t she?”
The blanket follows, draped carefully over Sherlock’s still shivering frame, before John finally deposits himself on the bench beside him, close enough that their thighs press together, close enough that Sherlock can feel John’s heat.
“Well you know John, would take a hell of a lot more than that.
John sounds petulant and all of 13 years old, and he knows it, but Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind.
What if I snuck upstairs while you were in the throes of it.
Now come drink your tea.
“Well, well done.
There’s a little thing with North Korea that needs attending to.”
“I would like to hold you.
I can’t…
He goes across the room, and shuts the curtains, and then returns toes out of his own shoes and socks and quickly divests himself of his own trousers.
John’s mouth waters as a bead of precome wells up at the head of Sherlock’s cock, and then swells over to run down his shaft.
So—do you have any questions for me?”
“What?”
You’ve just inhabited the body of my friend—without his consent.
“I’m afraid I’ve been rather…
“There’s a doctor coming.”
They can’t eat takeaway five days in a row anymore, they can’t pull all-nighters without a headache the next day, and they can’t chase shadowy figures down damp cobblestone streets for miles without feeling it for days afterwards, apparently.
He sigs.
Sherlock’s eyes snap to John’s even as he feels his cheeks heat.
It will happen when it happens.”
“Get out.”
“Molly will be here in an hour.
the collective lunacy of New Scotland Yard reaching a fevered pitch.
After that he can’t think of anything.
“You’re not okay.”
Murmured messily against his shoulder, followed by more kisses, and a deep, wet, suck to his shoulder.
John reaches out and grabs Sherlock by the hips.
Sherlock presses another kiss to John’s forehead and he feels himself relax.
He can see a light shining in one of the rooms off the foyer.
“Sherlock is coming with me.”
“Us?”
“Are you quite sure.
“Well, as far as I see it, Dr. Watson, you don’t have a choice.
Wouldn’t be right or kind when he knows what he’s like, what he does.
No one has sex on their wedding night.
“Are you alright?”
“Told you I’m bad at keeping clients.
Seemed like maybe it made you uncomfortable—the video, showing your face.
When he finally is able to look John in the eye, again, he finds John’s eyes soft.
He loses all track of time, and when John finally pulls away, looking as drunk as Sherlock feels, he thinks that perhaps it all might be alright between them after all.
“One more time and you were going to force me to retire.
She’s just…
Sherlock grins and disappears beneath the sheets, just like that.
“Yes, well…”
John warns.
“You.”
But it’s delicate.
“What if you were the doctor?”
He had intended to take copious mental notes the first time they did this, to gather data, to remember what he liked and didn’t like for future, to determine how John might like to be touched himself, but his mind won’t seem to work at all.
It was alright.
Fresh tears spill over.
“Oh.”
It takes Sherlock a moment to realise he’s talking to him.
Again.
Or do you actually prefer to live in this…”
You’ve made something indescribably beautiful from the pile of detritus that long stretch of years before you arrived had left behind.
John gives Mycroft a parting scowl, but does, as he says as he climbs out of the car, and heads for his flat.
Sherlock frowns in confusion.
“Your doing remarkably well, Holmes.
“Indeed.”
He’s invited him into his life without so much as a by your leave.
“Yeah.
He needs something—someone—he can trust.
He slides open the door, and Sherlock looks up, face pale, eyes red-rimmed.
And then suddenly Ella is looking at him, instead.
There’s nothing to see, really.
“I love you.”
“There are so many things more intimate than fucking, John, and this thing you keep worrying about, this thing you feel you’re denying yourself, denying me, it’s not about fucking.  It’s about trust. It’s about giving yourself over into my safe keeping, and that isn’t easy, especially now, especially after everything that’s just happened.”
“Oh, you do?”
Never really tried that before, and it’s not that I found it sexual exactly, but…”
“The thought never occurred.”
“It’s a lot of wasted time.”
John snatches his bag off the counter, throws some money at the proprietor and dashes out the door without even waiting for his change.
Sherlock jerks a little at the sudden increase in volume, and he does catch himself this time, unfortunately so does John.
“Let me hang those up for you.”
“Perhaps we should be thanking her.
But really, coffee and scones can hardly make up for two years absence, can they?
Usually he is tolerated, and that’s all, but John has been surprising him since the moment they met, and so it still goes…
“Did you know she’s sober.”
“Was I supposed to wear pants.”
I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.
“It’s okay now.
When he was drunk he had a short fuse.
He nods.
His head hurts considerably less than it had a few hours prior.
“Now, John!”
John kisses him back, small sips from his lips, hand sliding down Sherlock’s flank to cradle the rise of his arse as well.
“Good.”
I know.
“No, but I think you do.”
Ella writes something on her clipboard.
He’d told him he was over dressed, but Sherlock hadn’t listened, as always, and now he’s paying the price.
“I think there’s something really wrong with me.”
You or us.
Now John is going to move in.
Yeah.
“You were a ray of light in the darkness, a spark when all excitement had seemingly gone out of the world.”
Excuse me.”
“I’m not a child, John.
What do people usually say?
John shrugs.
Sherlock doesn’t waste another second.
He gets up, goes into the kitchen, and pours himself another couple of fingers of whiskey, leans back against the wall and thinks.
I—I took her back to the flat, got her sorted, and then I couldn’t…
Sherlock tries not to worry.
He can hear John breathing in the next room.
I don’t think it is.
None.
Well, that’s me done for then.
But this is harder.
“Alright.”
“You were what?
His cock has started to take an interest, and John glares down at it, as though it’s betrayed him, as though he doesn’t want this, isn’t teasing this to the surface purposefully.
“Well, there’s a mood-killer.”
“Mmm…  I’m okay.”
Yeah, okay.
“That so.”
Let’s not ruin this.”
Don’t know how you determine that stuff.
But I wanted to, and I think he did too—maybe.”
“Mmm.”
You need to shave.”
“You look exceptional.”
“The ones in the gallery.
Sherlock’s neck is wet.
“You should put heat on that, and I’ll be more careful how I bind you next time.”
“Oh?”
John blinks at the unexpected admission and tries not to be surprised that Sherlock had known all along.
Rumours are the Americans are setting up a Joint Task Force to coordinate against Da'esh.”
John huffs softly.
the first time Sherlock had taken John in, he couldn’t believe how wet he had been.
Not a woman.”
“It’s fine.”
“Alright.
“Sorry.
Sherlock gets up from the table, walks over, stops and looks down at him.
There is an infant’s life in danger, and I would think that you of all people would…”
Sherlock nods toward the bed.
The look on John’s face suggests he thinks it a horrible idea.
“Sherlock?”
She writes something on one with a biro, and then peels it off and sticks it on Rosie’s cardigan just as Sherlock walks up.
Sorry?
Why are you even here, Harry?
He tries not to think about what John must look like standing in the stream of warm water, sighing in relief as he slicks his hair back with one hand and dips the other down to…
“Plans?”
“Well, not yet.”
“‘Course then you came back, and I tried to kill you myself.
He stops recording, and decides to just post it without watching it back.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches upward in a fond smile before he turns his attention back to the road ahead.
John desires these things.
John glances up like he has no idea what Sherlock is asking, and then opens his mouth wide, stuffing the entire cracker in at once, while piling cheese on a second one.
He is nothing but a ball of white hot need.
John is looking at him like there is so much more he wants to say, like maybe he knows all the things Sherlock has been thinking and feeling these last few weeks, like maybe he’s been feeling them too, like maybe—maybe he wants to do something about it.
I was rather—forthright.
She scowls.
“Be careful.
Me too.”
He has not heard from him since their last session.
“Broken.”
“John…”
Maybe he won’t tell her.
He does as he’s told, without hesitation, crawls onto the mattress and lies down beside Sherlock rather than on top of him.
He waits for it to warm, lays on top of the covers, and closes his eyes, listens to Sherlock’s voice, and thrusts up into the cold air, denying himself, waiting until he’s so desperate for touch he thinks it might kill him.
It’s a far-flung, bleak sort of a place, precisely the sort Sherlock hates, where it’s all too easy for people commit atrocities with complete impunity.
It rings, and rings.
Let Sherlock do the starting this time.
“So how is old Sherlock, eh?
John nods, and stares down at his hands, rubs absently at the white ring of skin where his wedding band had sat until just a few weeks prior.
You haven’t heard what it is yet.”
John holds Sherlock in that way he sometimes does now, like he’s afraid of their happiness, afraid that Sherlock might be snatched away from him at a moment’s notice, and he might be forced to face the world alone again.
I love you, and I’m asking if you would ever want to…”
It’s full and deep, and Sherlock luxuriates in it, in the way John explores his mouth, lets his hands wander, cataloguing every inch.
It’s tentative but desperate.
“John…”
I imagine these cottages let way in advance in the summer months.”
“Say it.”
“Ta, for this.”
and I’d much rather you, than the alarm.”
Sherlock is usually more careful with him, but perhaps this is Sherlock more thrown by the video than he realises, desperate, stampeding through rather than treading on eggshells the way he usually does, and maybe that’s a good thing, necessary even, but…
“Really?!”
“I’m going to say something, and I’d appreciate it if you kept your mouth shut until I’m done.”
“If you mean him, then no, he seems to think rather more.
Sherlock chuckles.
“I WANTED YOU!”
It’s way more hours than he usually gets.
“It’s—it’s not like that.”
Sherlock moves on, traces the backs of his knuckles over John’s belly, it’s soft and nearly hairless, his chest too.
This wasn’t easy for him.
In for a penny, in for a pound, John thinks.
One only needed to wait until you were frustrated enough with the mess, and you would begrudgingly tidy yourself.
Don’t worry, I’m not going to rub off on her.
“Would you like to do more of what we’ve been doing?”
Look at you.
anyone who treated him that way.
“You assumed I’d put you off.”
“Don’t they?”
wasn’t braver.”
He has a travel mug of coffee spiked with something a little stronger clutched in one white-knuckled hand, and a wrinkle between his brows that indicates that the headache from the day before is still tormenting him.
“No, no.
His cock throbs between their bodies at the thought, and John’s hand fumbles behind him, returns to his arse cheek, squeezes.
Why?”
John shakes his head.
And when Sherlock just stares.
Because the good doctor is a man of his word.”
Showed up here at 4:30 in the morning, can you imagine?!
“Hmm?”
Sod off.
“I know we had a bath earlier, but I might not be really clean, and…”
John is smiling that soft, half-smile of his again.
Sherlock dips down to kiss just below his bruised cheek bone.
“Good.  Neither do I.  Now come.  Let’s bathe.”
John leans back, deep in thought.
Sherlock’s breathing changes.
I didn’t ask.
At this rate we’ll probably be conducting it in a hospital room.”
Sherlock is totally lost.
John winks, and then skates a few circles around him, before forging on ahead and skating backwards again, which seems to impress Sherlock to no end.”
There is no reason Sherlock should.
The thunder rolls, and Sherlock’s body with it.
“I panicked.”
Sherlock stretches and murmurs into his hair.
“God yeah.  Please.”
“When I spoke to Wilder in London he mentioned that your son was a very practical boy, that he would not have been prone to running off with strangers.
He pushes closer, and John doesn’t object, so he pushes closer still.
And when Sherlock backs up, and plops down, wordlessly.
It’s warm, but John still shivers.
He listens to John move around in the darkness, undressing, moving to the loo to brush his teeth and relieve himself, and then tries to pretend he’s sleeping when John slips beneath the sheets behind him.
“We shared a room.
“Yes.”
He’s home now.
Old house.
Sherlock nods.
“How are you feeling about it, so far?”
“I’ve never felt about anyone the way I feel about you.
Two stories later and she’s dozing in his arms.
“What did they steal?”
“We don’t need to talk about this if you’d rather not.”
He winks, and John grins.
“Thank you.”
He’s been there, the sort of full body grief that once it begins just seems like it will never stop.
Stop him.
She finishes, grinning at Sherlock.
They’re so extra in every way.
Doesn’t mean you just leave.
He is.
A series of seemingly disconnected suicides all over the city.
It’s—fine.
He instantly regrets it.
Sherlock…”
Sherlock sounds a tad indignant.
He just nods, eyes still shut, and John must accept his response, because he feels the mattress dip beside him, feels the press of John’s body along his side, the warm press of his hand over his belly, John’s breath wafting over his shoulder, his lips warm and firm pressing against it, moving up the curve of it, to his neck, up, up behind his ear, and Sherlock makes a deep, rumbling, strung out sound of pure want that causes John to make a breathy sound in response.
The baby, John.”
“Then we shouldn’t have done this.
Crimson, crushed.
He shifts up and leans in a little closer, lifts a hand to Sherlock’s hair, thumb teasing the the waves at his temple, he leans down, and Sherlock stops breathing.
Sherlock blinks down at him.  He still looks a little stunned.  “Dinner?  Oh.  Dinner.  Yes, fine.  Good.”
“No.”
But, the police don’t consult amateurs.
And Sherlock smiles.
You’re here at the flat with me.
Not cruel, not angry, but more imperious somehow.
It’s slow, and sweet, and lazy.
“In retrospect, perhaps I have forgiven too much.”
“The Duke’s secretary?
Need the loo.”
“I would rather show you, and it requires one last, small experiment, which I very much hope you will help me with.”
Come for me.
Was it on when you entered the room?
John is lying atop him, elbow of his good arm propped on the mattress, his other hand stroking the hair away from Sherlock’s forehead, his erection flagging.
“I forgive you, and I’m glad you’re home.”
I know.
“A little.”
It—it’s a part of why you’re here, isn’t it?
“What?  Love yourself?  Well, we all know that.”  John breathes into Sherlock’s curls with a chuckle.
Here.
You don’t have to prove anything to me, and you don’t have to put your life at risk just to keep me interested.
“Yeah.
John’s hands, hot and strong, splay against his lower back, press just enough to keep their bodies close, just enough to make John’s intention clear:
“Was it a good idea, this?”
Christ, please.”
I’m saying it’s all of our fault: Alex, James, Me, You.
“This really isn’t a ‘
I refused to commit to it as a boy.
“Mm, staring to see the benefits.”
“You could have died.”
“Joh-John…”
“Yeah.
“Why, Sherlock?”
You were in a war zone, I imagine you must know this.”
