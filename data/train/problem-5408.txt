Well, that much is true. Between work, worrying about Sam, and trying to schedule an appointment with the perpetually booked neurologist for Cas, Dean had felt like an overtight drum. Even now, on this incredible trip that Cas had put together for him, Dean still had moments where he thought about how far away from home they were, how he wouldn’t be able to help Sam if there was an emergency, or assist his coworkers at the hospital if they needed him. How he couldn’t do his job, just because he was weak and needed to relax.
He’d woken Cas up with a blowjob that morning, slipping under the covers and sucking him off slow and gentle until he’d come shaking into Dean’s mouth. Afterwards, Cas had pulled him up and kissed him while he jacked Dean off, fast and hard, leaving Dean breathless and dizzy in the aftermath. Then they’d kissed before Cas left for work, sweet and easy, just like they had every morning for the past few days. It was… Dean could admit he was incredibly happy. Even the crappy weather couldn’t bring him down today.
It feels like an epiphany.
Moonlight dances across Cas’ face, shifting like waves as he shudders and comes down, still pressed inside Dean. He tucks his face into the curve of Dean’s neck, pressing his lips against Dean’s hammering pulse, then takes a breath, pulling his hips back.
At the first bite, Castiel’s eyes widen almost comically, and he begins shoveling food into his mouth at a nearly alarming rate. Dean watches, slack jawed, as Castiel downs four of the pancakes in record time, and then starts in on the fluffy pile of eggs he’d taken for himself. “Whoa, buddy, slow down there!” Dean says. “You’re gonna make yourself sick at that pace. Food ain’t going anywhere, I promise.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, nodding. “Makes sense. Okay. Me and Sam’ll start looking for this key or whatever first thing.” He starts to set down the whiskey bottle still in his hand before pausing, twisting the cap off once more. “What do you say to a nightcap? Sounds like we were both pretty successful today. We should celebrate.”
“You’re a heavily pregnant man. I sincerely doubt you’re just “fine”.” Dean throws her a dangerous look. She throws her hand up in response, “All I mean is I’ve seen you massage your back for the last few minutes, you look like you haven’t slept. Clearly you seem uncomfortable deary.” She rubs a sympathetic hand over his shoulder.
Rowena shakes her head sternly, “Now try saying that to that dear tweetiepie of yours. I’m sure all he wants to do is help. But he can’t if you’re not willing to let him.”
Dean lets out a small chuckle at that, Sam continues, “You are going to be ten times better than dad. You know why?” Dean shakes his head hesitantly, “Because you have been the best parent for me my whole life. You just need to stop getting in your head about hunting. Read a book or learn to knit, I don’t know. But, you can’t go on a rampage while you’re the size of a house-“
The blood freezes in Dean’s veins, and he bolts up from the table, his half-finished beer forgotten. How could he have been so stupid? He never even thought to ask if Cas knew how to swim, if it was something Cas had maybe forgotten. Holy shit, he was so fucking irresponsible, he should have
It takes a moment for Dean to think of anything to say, his mouth too dry to speak as he faces down yet another cosmic being. “Where’s Cas,” he manages, injecting some steel into those two words despite everything. “You took him. Where is he.”
Taking care of Sam definitely taught him that, if nothing else did.
He jogs back to the house, listening as Cas begins to explain very seriously to Jack about certain language that shouldn’t be used in front of people. Inside, on the kitchen table, sits a neatly wrapped box with a “Congrats, Grad!” card addressed to Sam perched on top. There hadn’t really been any “Congrats on completing your apprenticeship and becoming a full witch and business partner!” cards or anything at the store, so Dean had compromised.
He doesn’t waste anymore time after that, just turns his head to press an open-mouthed kiss to the hot shaft before wrapping a hand around the base and sucking Cas down. He tastes like skin and salt on Dean’s tongue, a little bitter from precome, and Dean bobs his head down and down, taking as much of him in as he can. Cas is
Sam’s face crumples somewhere between distress and frustration, a tired light in his eyes. “You love him,” he says, and it sounds so simple. Easy. The words don’t hold the same weight on Sam’s tongue that they do in Dean’s brain. They don’t bang around the inside of Sam’s ribcage like they do in Dean’s, bruising his heart until it nearly breaks.
“Good. That’s good,” he says, immediately wants to kick himself, so fucking
“Sam? Rowena?” Dean shouts, voice harsh in the conspicuous silence of the ruined office. “Sam! Sammy!”
Dean ushers him inside his apartment and makes him sit down on the couch. “I’m gonna go get my first aid kit, and then I’ll take a look at your ribs,” he says, heading for the bathroom. He digs under the sink for the kit, and also pulls out a roll of gauze tape with it. His hand knocks against a bottle of Tylenol, but he knows it’s expired, so he leaves it behind.
“Him.” Gesturing towards Cas, Dean prepares his request. “As Cas just mentioned, he’s got some pretty severe post-traumatic retrograde amnesia. It’s nearly total memory loss. When I found him, he only remembered his first name, and he didn’t have any ID on him or anything. I asked Sam and Rowena for help, but they couldn’t do anything either. And I know that you need a bit more than
“Cas?” Dean’s voice sounds small to his own ears, confusion crawling up his throat even as his ankle feels like someone set a small fire inside of it. His jaw aches as well; he’s gonna have an impressive bruise there tomorrow, he can tell.
“I’m looking for Cas,” he says as she looks up.
.” Castiel’s eyes are narrow slits, his mouth a hard line as he glares at Dean.
For a moment, Dean stutters incomprehensibly, and then finally the synapses between his brain and his mouth snap together again. “Get out!” he yells at Sam, who is still standing in the doorway looking like the world’s largest, dumbest deer caught in the headlights. “You don’t just barge into people’s rooms! Get the fuck out!”
He watches as understanding dawns on Dean’s face. “And it’ll take him out, too. Like it was supposed to with me, when I tried to kill Amara.”
“Great, thanks, Dean. I know this was probably really easy and simple for you, but Rowena and I feel a lot better that you helped us out.” He frowns thoughtfully as he continues to examine the monitor. “I’m not entirely sure what Rowena plans on doing with this, but she seems excited.”
Two weeks later, Dean walks out of the hospital after an overnight shift, pulling out his phone to check if Cas has texted him yet. They’re supposed to go get coffee before Dean takes him over to the Gas-n-Sip for his shift, and Cas had agreed to meet Dean by the employee entrance.
Something shifts at the corner of Dean’s vision, a hint of movement that has him swiveling his head, nearly puking. Across the clearing, Sam sits up, pale and shaking, and extends his arm. Sweat is visible on his brow from the clearly immense strain he’s fighting against.
The water here is a much deeper shade of blue, the sunlight glinting off it like a postcard. Dean licks his lips as a salty breeze ruffles his hair. Overhead, seagulls and other ocean birds wheel through the sky, their sharp cries mixing with the rhythm of the waves as they wash over the sand.
It sounds like an accusation in his head, Cas’ message looping, still, just like it did the whole six-hour drive from Texhoma to Lebanon. And no one in the bunker had picked up their goddamn phones to tell Dean that everything was fine. There’s a part of him that wants to laugh, bitter and mean, because Dean can’t even keep track of how many times he’s left the exact same message on Cas’ phone, how many times he’s prayed to Cas with the exact same question.
. Cas is sitting on his couch wearing a dark suit and tie under a rumpled tan trenchcoat, like he didn’t used to
“Cas,” he breathes, shoving his face into the juncture between Cas’ neck and shoulder. He’s solid and real in Dean’s arms, familiar and
He closes his eyes and lets himself pretend that Cas is laying in bed and breathing next to him, that Cas’ arm is slung across Dean’s waist in a comfortable, intimate embrace. That Cas is tucked up against him and Dean can feel the rise and fall of his chest as he breathes in and out.
“Makes sense,” Sam nods, and then sneezes.
“It’s fine, Sam,” Dean cuts him off, pulling two more bottles out. He pops the lid on one, offers it to Sam, who shakes his head silently. “If you ain’t gonna join me for a drink, then go back to bed. Go back to Eileen.” Yeah, he’s not proud of the way his voice cracks on her name, but oh well.
Dean chuckles down at his screen. Cas and mornings don’t exactly mix very well; he generally tries to be tolerable during these early morning coffee sessions, but sometimes the caffeine dependency jumps out.
The Empty makes Cas’ face smile, teeth bared, and it stalks around Dean, like a predator sizing up its prey. “You humans aren’t terribly bright, are you?” it asks, almost conversational, voice strangely nasal. It grates on Dean’s ears. “He expected to see me as Meg, because the angel said I was Meg, so that’s who he saw. I can be many things, Dean, many things to many people. But mainly, what I am, is
He watches as Dean’s pulse thrums, rapid, in his neck, the way Dean’s brow furrows even further. There are -- there are tears in his eyes, Castiel is surprised to see. A thin sheen of them, but tears nonetheless. “Yeah?” he says roughly, twisting the bottle of whiskey in his hands before setting it back down with a rough thunk. “Just in case what? You planning on running off, finding something that makes you so fucking happy you can’t help but be snatched away? That your plan?” He takes a step forward, into Castiel’s space, closing the distance between them. “You’ve decided that if you’re gonna die, you want to do it alone? What the hell, man?” Dean’s eyes are alight with a desperate anger that Castiel has seen so many times before, but there’s something layered under that gaze, something akin to the sadness that Dean tries hard to mask in front of others, but so different at the same time.
Dean hugs her back, closing his eyes for just a moment before breaking the embrace. “I’ll do my best,” he promises.
“What if I am a serial killer?”
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asks instead of answering him. He kneels down next to Dean, hands hesitant as he carefully pushes the mangled hem of Dean’s pants up his calf and out of the wound. “Are you bitten?”
“Yeah, but -- I mean, what the hell was that? What’s going on?” Dean says. “Were those
Which is the only reason Dean is able to hear a muffled thump coming from the head of an alley as he passes. Startled, he looks down the space, trying to make out any shapes from the early morning gloom. He thinks there might be a dumpster back there -- maybe a raccoon or something got caught in it? Should he call Animal Control? A vet?
“That’s not what umami means. You’re talking about flavor layering. You enjoy your beverage because of the juxtaposing flavor profile it presents. I’m enjoying my beverage for the sweet and somewhat spicy flavor profile it provides. We all have different tastes, quite literally.”
Dean thinks about telling her about the selkies, about the attack on the beach, about Cas disappearing under the waves as a gray light. She deserves to know the truth about her friend.
Surprise flits across Castiel’s face. “Thank you, Dean,” he says, and the sincerity in his voice makes Dean’s palms sweat just a bit. “I really appreciate what you’re doing to help me. I don’t know what I can do to repay you.”
He feels like he’s about to crawl out of his skin but Cas keeps the pace of his hand slow and easy, and Dean curses and moans beneath him, pulling at the sheets. “Please, Cas,” he gasps, heat rising like a tide inside him. He needs more; he needs
Cas’ eyes have narrowed, and Dean is struck by the image of a predator tracking down prey. Or a threat. “There’s someone here,” he whispers to Dean, pulling him closer. “It doesn’t… something doesn’t feel right.” His head swivels back and forth; nothing seems off, but Dean feels uneasy.
There’s a sharp creak from the chair as Dean lifts himself up, holding on desperately to the back for leverage. Cas bites a line of kisses across his collarbone and up his neck, his hands warm and solid as they grip Dean’s hips, keeping him grounded. Keeping him steady. Cas won’t let him go too fast, which Dean loves and hates at the same time. He desperately wants to let go, to take Cas as fast and deep as he can, but this is amazing, too, raising himself up slow only to roll back down, hard.
“Wonderful,” Rowena says. “I’ll leave you boys to it.” She exits the workshop, picking up a book on her way out.
Cas’ face shifts, and he pulls his fingers out of Dean, hands shaking as he picks up the bottle of lube and drizzles even more into one palm. He jacks himself quickly, spreading the lube around, then grabs Dean’s hips, moving him until he’s practically in Cas’ lap, thighs spread wide around Cas’ hips. Heat rushes up Dean’s face, but he forgets about it quickly as the head of Cas’ dick tags against his hole and he groans; he doesn’t have any leverage like this, can’t buck his hips or grind down. Can only take what Cas gives him.
“What? How does that make any sense?” Dean demands. Seriously, how does that make any goddamn sense?
“Find anything good?” Dean asks, plunking an open beer down on a coaster on the coffee table in front of Cas. The bowl of cookies gets set down next to it, and Cas automatically leans forward to snag one.
And then he left.
Something cold and hard drops into the pit of Dean’s stomach. “No, he --”
He sits next to Cas at the table in the kitchen, a half-full drink in his hand, their knees bumping underneath. Dean carefully doesn’t think about the unmarred flesh of Cas’ forearm. Doesn’t think about how close they came to locking Chuck away and putting the Mark on Cas, ugly red raised flesh that would have burned and burned. Doesn’t think about how sometimes he can still feel it on his own arm, how a phantom pain had itched when Cas had left all those months ago in the face of Dean’s anger.
“Rosie?” Castiel asked looking confused, “Who’s Rosie baby?”
“I am sorry Dean.”
Whining, Dean scrunched his nose. “..cold..”
“You’re welcome sweetheart. I’m glad you like it.” Smiling, Castiel combed his hand through Dean’s hair. Hearing his boy hum again, he started to push his happy baby.
Everything inside him was numb, his mind only showing him the image of his baby’s terrified little face, over and over again, like something evil was pressing a rewind button, loving making him relive every tormenting moment. He did know what to think. He knew only one thing, and that was that he was a failure. He failed to protect Dean, his baby was gone and he had done nothing.
Feeling Daddy pat his diaper, Dean turned, meeting Castiel’s bright blue eyes.
Soon as Dean did as he was asked, Castiel got to his feet. Holding Dean close to his chest, he turned towards his nephew. “Sammy, could you do something very important for me?”
Trying to keep his mind off of what the doctor was doing, Dean turned his eyes to Castiel’s tattoo again, seeing it closer he could see the detail of all the symbols. Bring his hand up Dean traced his fingers across the grey and black ink on his Daddy.
Blinking, Michael looked at his little brother with a slight blush on his cheeks. “Sorry Castiel, I was daydreaming.”
“In here Gabe,” Castiel winced as he tried to sit up. Hearing his brother’s footsteps, Castiel soon saw Gabriel standing in the doorway.
Dean looked up to his Daddy, unsure. Would he be allowed to go?
“I’m funnier then Uncle Mikey right?” Gabriel asked grinning.
Gabriel looked at his brother. He could see the love shining in his eyes. “It’s okay baby bro, I’m just glad you are happy and you’re going to be the best Daddy in the world to this special little man,” placing a kiss on the top of his brothers head, Gabriel moved to leave. “I’ll call you in the morning. I’m going to go into work and sort out the paperwork and maybe I’ll pop by to see my nephew in the afternoon.”
Walking in to the kitchen, he grabbed one of the bottles in the fridge and put it into warmer. While he waited, he lightly hummed as he rocked Dean.
Frowning Castiel knew what Dean meant. Dean didn’t want to be a baby anymore. “Dean, you don’t want to be my baby?” he asked, sounding heartbroken.
Dean felt his breathing start to hitch, hot tears ran down the sides of his face he started to cry loudly.
Castiel burst out laughing at the look on Dean’s face “Okay, I’ll agree nothing can beat Gabriel’s pancakes.”
Looking over to Dr Bailey, Castiel noticed her starting to undo Dean’s diaper, he knew Dean wasn’t going to be happy with her looking down there.
“When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of neon light, that split the night and touched the sound of silence.”
“We need to get Dean cloths first.”
Standing up Castiel walked over to the baby rocking swing that had been set up yesterday by the decorators. Pulling it over he set it up in front of the television. Gently lowering Dean into the seat Castiel placed Dean’s arms and legs into the straps before clicking them together. Picking up Rosie he lay Dean’s bee next to him. He pressed a small button on the side and the swing slowly started to rock his baby. “Alright baby, I’m going to go clean up the kitchen and get stuff ready for lunch. You enjoy your cartoons till I come get you.”
“Hey, how’re my favourite people?” he said as his brother came up next to him.
Gabriel couldn’t help rolling his eyes “Cas I’ll deal with Michael when the time comes and don’t worry, Dean doesn't have to come willingly. None of the other homeless had to. Michael’s made it so they don’t have a choice.”
“I know where the boy is and we’re going to go get him, but first I want to know why he was taken in the first place,” Michael said, looking very angry towards Lilith.
“Iadoptedalittlelastnight.” Gabriel mumbled.
“Hush, now,” Castiel soothed. Picking Dean up he held him close to his chest. “Daddy’s here baby.”
Picking Dean up, Castiel could see Dean had tears in his eyes, he must have looked very funny to his baby. Feeling the cold, Castiel held Dean close to his chest using the softness of Deans jumper to stop him shivering.
“Oh, poor baby.” Moving in front of his brother, Gabriel undid the straps to the stroller. Lifting his nephew into his arms he hugged Dean close. “Was Daddy mean taking you to the doctor Deany?”
Looking at his Daddy, Sam couldn’t believe he had asked him, “But..it pink,” he stuttered behind his pacifier.
“Just delivering a nursery that was ordered,” the man said, walking away into the room across from his.
Sam frowned in confusion, Dean was a little? He never remembered Dean ever being a little, his big brother was always the one that was responsible and looked after him when they lived together.
“Yes Sam is a Little now. John tried to sell him to the AB Program a few years ago and left him there, so the program kept him.”
“I don’t think my husband would appreciate me running off with a younger man darling, but I’m sure if I was fifty years younger,” she laughed as she walked back to her trolley. “Have you got a lot left to do?” she added
Castiel stood, looking at the front door in shock. He couldn’t believe his brother baled on him. “Your uncle is a bit of a scaredy-cat when babies cry, isn’t he Deany,” he chuckled, looking to his boy. Dean still cried as Castiel talked to him. He wasn’t really listening. Unsure of what to do, Castiel walked back to the sofa. Sitting down, he cradled his upset boy. Silently, Castiel watched his baby. Even though Dean looked blotchy and upset Castiel still thought he was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Holding Dean closer, Castiel starts to hum a tune as he brings his hand up to stroke his thumb along the boy’s forehead.
Castiel sighed looking at the bowl, he really didn’t want to do it but he had to convince his boy. Placing a spoon full in his mouth, Castiel held it on his tongue. He couldn’t really give a name to what it tasted like, all he knew was it was disgusting. Quickly moving to the sink he spat it out. Turning round he hears everyone laughing loudly.
Stepping into the littles clothes store, Gabriel decided to wander off, leaving Castiel to look around with Dean. Going down each aisle, Castiel pick up clothes he liked. So far he had seven onesies, four rompers, and three pairs of elastic jeans.
Nodding, Dean cuddled into his Daddy to breathe in his scent. He had no plan on letting Daddy go today, so sitting watching cartoons sounded great to him.
Chucking into his cup Castiel notices Gabriel give him a confused look. “What’s so funny?” he asks frowning when he sees Michael smiling too.
“What’s the matter sweetheart, are you feeling okay?” Castiel lowered his hand on top of his baby’s head. He doesn’t feel warm, he thought. Lowering the rail, pulling Dean’s covers back he soon smells what’s wrong. Hearing Dean start to cry quietly he picked him up out of his crib. “Oh Deany, it’s okay baby. Shh Daddy’ll fix it.”
Nodding, Dean was glad to hear that Sam was safe now and will be loved like he should be.
Dean nodded happy, he stop listening when he heard Daddy say okay, he was just excited to get the chance to do something he wanted to do.
Taking out what he needed, Castiel started to undo the snaps of Dean’s jeans and bodysuit. Dean whimpered when the smell of his diaper hit his nose. He really didn’t like using his diapers. Looking at his Daddy he was expecting him to have a look of disgust, but in all honesty Dean thought Castiel looked a bit proud.
“Never do...and don’t forget my marriage offer!” Gabriel laughed to himself.
Once he was back in the living room, Castiel let out a long sigh as he looked around the room. He didn’t like being on his own. Hearing his phone vibrate on the table, Castiel quickly picked it up to see Gabriel’s name flash up.
Dean’s eyes widened in shock. It’s a dress, but he’s a boy...man, why did he get him dress? Dean looked to Castiel in a panic but by the look on the man’s face he was just as shocked as he was.
Thank you for all your lovely comments and kudos you are all awesome and lovely.
“I could be your Daddy,” Gabriel whispered, he never thought he would make a good Daddy, he didn’t think he could be like Castiel. His brother was loving, caring and protective everything. Gabriel thought he wasn’t, but when he looked into the face of the cute boy in front of him he wanted nothing more than to have Sam with him.
Once they finished eating Castiel put the plates in the sink before grabbing a cloth with Dean’s bottle from the warmer.
“I remember, you were looking after Dean,” Gabriel said getting her attention.
Pulling up onto Castiel’s drive Gabriel grabbed his files and the toy car. As he got to the door he hears loaded crash from the other side of the door. Starting to panic, Gabriel opened the door running in. “Cas! Cas where are you?”
Standing, staring for a while, Castiel jumped when the brown haired boy coughed even louder than before. He really didn’t sound well. Pulling out all the bills in his wallet, Castiel crept closer. Trying his best not to wake the boy he folds the bills and places them close to the boy’s head so he could find them.
“Silly!”
“Samuel, Castiel is the most loving, caring soul, he is going to love having you as his new nephew just as much as I am.”
“I’m sorry baby, I shouldn’t have left you,” he whispered, kissing the back of Dean’s head. whimpering, Dean rested his head on Castiel’s shoulder. He was just happy to be back in the man’s arms.
Castiel could feel his heart against his chest as he paced up and down Hannah’s hallway, looking at the front door. He knew he was working himself up, but he just wanted his baby. He needed to feel Dean in his arms to know in his mind that Dean was back and safe again.
“Casey, come here,” Gabriel whispered. Putting his arm around Castiel’s shoulder, he turned them to face away from Dean. “Cas, why don’t you go find Dean a stuffy or something,” Castiel looked up into his brothers grey eyes looking confused.
Gabriel knew he needed to look after his family right now, but he had something important of his own to sort out.
Lifting his head up Castiel grinned, “Ice-cream? Daddy did promise Ice-cream, but first we need to have a check up.”
Gabriel could see she was about to start the waterworks, but he knew she was just putting it on. Last time he had to deal with Lilith she had tried to make him sleep with her, but girls trying to “Work their way up the ladder” were really not his type. So he fired her, but she had other plans. Guess it was a lot harder trying to get into Michael’s pants if she’s only his receptionist.
Clutching his new car, Dean tried to look over Gabriel’s shoulder as he was lifted out of his seat. He couldn’t see any cars yet, all there was was a big warehouse. Maybe Gabriel got lost or something…
‘Piss off’ Castiel mouthed to his brother. Hearing Dean laugh behind him, Castiel grinned to himself. He loved Dean’s laugh.
Walking back to his room Gabriel heard a low whine. Moving faster he found his little boy crying.
Shaking his head Dean lifted his arm up as far as he could to point to the TV. “..That..”
Charlie just sat quietly, cuddling her Uncle as he cried. She knew what he needed; her Uncle Cas always cuddled her when she was sad, so now she wanted to do the same for him. Hannah blinked back her tears, her little girl was so sweet. Sometimes she wondered how she was so lucky to have such a lovely child.
“..Cream...” Dean nodded, smiled up at her.
Soon as the brothers made eye contact, both Dean and Sam stared at each other in silence. Sam could feel his heart beating through his ears. It was Dean, his Dean. Looking his big brother up and down he didn’t know what to do. Dean was dressed in full body suit with a pacifier clipped to the neck. He looked just like the younger babies back at the hospital.
When she got back at her desk, Lilith looked at her boss. She couldn’t believe what she had witnessed. Michael didn’t order her to call the Bouncers to have the little collected, he was obviously not thinking straight, he was going to risk everything and for the stupidity of his brother. She never like Castiel or Gabriel, mostly Gabriel. Before she became Michael’s receptionist she used to work for Gabriel’s department and she never thought he appreciated her the way she deserved.
Dean found he actually like the stroller. It was comfortable and the vibrations of it moving were very pleasant. His favourite part was that the hood covered him up well enough so people couldn’t see him.
“Okay then, we’ll be back in a minute.”
“D...Dean,” Sam started to feel his eyes tear up. he hadn’t said his big brothers name in so long, his Dad had band him from talking about Dean. If he even mentioned him, his Dad would get angry and hurt him. Whimpering Sam hugged his bear to his chest, he felt so bad, he missed his big brother so much.
Moving as fast as he could Castiel lifted Dean into his arms. “Shhh..it’s okay baby..oh my bumblebee it’s okay,” Castiel whispered into his baby’s ear as he walked the room swaying trying to calm Dean down.
Nothing he said seemed to be getting through to his boy. Moving as fast as he could Castiel made quick work at diapering his baby and dressing him in a white romper suit. Picking Dean up, he started to rock his baby.
“Do you think Cas will ever forgive me?”
“Yea Daddy, Deany loves cars,” Sam said shyly, he might not have seen Dean in forever but he always remembered that his big brother loved cars. “It that okay Daddy?”
Walking to into Dean’s nursery Castiel lay him down onto the changing table. Picking up a diaper and cream he placed the diaper under Dean bum then put some cream on the end of his fingers.
“Oh, you liked Rosie hmm?” Feeling a small nod, Castiel smiled towards Gabriel who grinned shaking his head. This was clearly the quietest fight over a toy they had ever see. When he and Gabriel were little they use to scream at each other over whatever toys the other had, not caring who’s feeling were hurt. But watching Sam and Dean it was clear they were trying not to upset each other.
Gabriel followed the men to their truck with tears in his eyes as the dragged Dean into the back, the poor boy screaming for his Daddy. How could this have happened, how did they find out? Hundreds of questions ran through his mind, but he knew the answer to one. The men that took Dean were Michael’s men. He recognised one of them from previous meetings. So he knew where he was going to get Dean back.
“Hey little man,” Gabriel grinned, holding out his arms for the boy. Soon as Sam reached him, he picked Sam up into the air making his baby giggle. “What are you doing up so early?”
“Of course not Hannah, we really should have told you more of what was happening. I’m always happy to see my special girl,” Castiel smiled, winking up at the curly hair girl and making her giggle.
“Yes, I am quite a beauty, aren’t I baby?” Castiel laughed, bouncing Dean on his lap. Dean just looked at them like they were crazy. Pointing to the Lion King, Dean snuggled into his Daddy.
Dean watched anxiously as Castiel walked round to his side of the car. Opening the door he leaned half his body in coming close to the boy.
Dean’s eyes shot open. Did his Daddy say home? Turning his head to look behind him, Dean looked up in shock. The house was an old ranch style building with tall red brick walls and a white wood porch that went all the way round the house. Coming down one side of the porch was all different flowers and shrubs that made a path to the driveway. It looked like something out of a magazine.
“Don’t do that baby,” hearing his Daddy, Dean looked at him with sad puppy eyes. “Do not blame yourself for this. You didn’t know, this was all John.”
“You’re welcome. I also took the liberty to order some cloths for Samuel, he himself has picked most of them.”
“Are you sure you don’t want me and Charlie to say with you Cas?” Hannah asked, standing in the doorway of Castiel’s front door with Charlie asleep in her arms.
“Stop us then.” Michael said with no feeling.
“I...I..” Michael winced hearing his little brother.
“That’s good to hear,” Gabriel said, standing taking the plates to the sink.
“Who?” Michael looked to his brother confused which just pissed Gabriel off even more.
“Thank you,”
Hearing his brother’s words, Gabriel could feel a lump in his throat. That was the most loving thing Michael has said in a very long time. It was nice to hear that his big brother truly loved being Sam’s Uncle and wasn’t just pretending.
Dean came out of his thoughts when he heard Charlie squeal, laughing at Gabriel playfully blowing kisses into her hair.
“The nursery is beautiful Gabe, thank you.”
“We will soon baby, but right now both you and Dean have been through a lot tonight. And you’re my priority. I want to get you comfortable in your new home first before we go see Dean.”
“Are you positive?” Bring his face closer, Sam gave a small nod, looking nervous. Burying his face into Sam neck, Gabriel blew a loud raspberry in to the boy’s skin. Squealing, Sam wiggled trying to get away, but Gabriel held him in place continuing to tickle him as he blew into his neck.
“You did so well Dean. You can dress him now,” Dr Bailey smiled. Patting Dean’s hair, she sat in her chair as Castiel stood up to re-diaper his baby.
Hearing his Uncles say present Sam looked up from the man’s chest towards Dean.
“I’m sorry Dean.” Michael grinned kissing his nephew’s forehead.
“You’re very welcome Dean. Enjoy your cars gentlemen,” Crowley smiled, shaking each man’s hand, including Dean.
Shrinking into himself Sam sobbed playing the helm of his t-shirt.
Sam stopped play with his bear, looking to Gabriel, he looked to Meg nervously. Seeing this Gabriel turned to Meg, “Could you give us a few minutes,” he ordered giving her a look to say he was not really asking. It was clear the child was nervous to talk in front of the women.
“Dean did not hurt me, the glass did. Anyway, what did you do with Dean? Did you put him down for a nap?” Castiel asked, walking out of the bathroom. He should go check on him.
The car was very quiet on the way to Castiel’s house, Gabriel didn’t know what to do. His brother hadn’t said a word to him since they left the mall. Gabriel knew he had screwed up. He should have been paying attention to Dean, he should have seen the boy was uncomfortable with the women fussing over him, and seeing the upset look on his brother’s face made him feel even worse.
“Gabe, why don’t you go lay him in his crib?”
Both Castiel and Gabriel gave each other an unease glance, it was not surprising that Michael knew John’s middle name.
Following Deans hand, Castiel picked up the toy and handed it to his boy. “There you go baby, did you want to play with the puppy?”
“I’m not sure.”
Sitting on Gabriel’s lap in the back of Gabriel’s landrover, he kept his eyes closed, trying to avoid seeing Michael driving in the front.
It makes Cas turn back to him, eyes searching, calm and blue and deep, and Dean doesn’t look away from that. He hopes Cas finds whatever he’s looking for. Hopes Cas will tell him about it, someday. That whatever it is, Cas likes it.
“Don’t be so dramatic. If anything is going to give you an early heart attack, it’s your proclivity for ordering a bacon cheeseburger every time we go to Benny’s. You’re a nurse, shouldn’t you be setting a good example for your patients?” Cas teases.
The werewolf’s breaths are panting hot and acrid against his face and throat, and Dean throws out a fist, knuckles meeting painfully with a semi-elongated snout. Then there’s a shout, and the wolf is tossed off of him, flying several feet and colliding with a metal trash can with a loud crash.
Cas pulls Dean back down, Dean’s head pillowed on Cas’ chest this time. His heart beats slow and heavy and methodical against Dean’s ear. A hand brushes over his head, and Dean closes his eyes. “Go to sleep,” Cas murmurs, voice drifting off into the night. He falls asleep quickly himself, breathing deep and even.
. “But that’s what everyone does, right? They leave you. They love you but they leave you, because they know you’re broken inside. Because you’re worth dying for, but not worth living for, hm?”
“Like what?” Dean all but squawks.
“Dean!” Another push, and Dean can feel it now, someone’s hand on his shoulder, shaking him awake. The Empty fades out around him, the dream snapping all at once as he opens his eyes and looks up, squinting, into the strangely blinding light of his room.
He could put on Scooby-Doo, maybe. But even that feels like too much effort, and he’s pretty sure it would be a bad idea to watch TV with his probable concussion.
“Okay, okay, I get it,” Dean says, scrubbing a hand hotly across the back of his neck. Next to him, Cas snorts in amusement. “Alright, if we’re done listing my myriad fuck-ups, can we get down to business?”
,” he says, and god, the burr of his voice sends a shiver down Dean’s spine. “You’re a good man, Dean, and you’ve been under a lot of stress recently. You needed a break, and I knew how to give you one. The work you do is important, and so are you. You put so much of your time and energy into helping others; for once, let someone help you.”
It makes sense, Dean has to admit, but he still blows out a frustrated breath and scrubs a hand through his hair. Across from him, Castiel slumps in the chair, disappointment etched across his face. Dean’s heart aches in sympathy for him -- it can’t be easy, being told that there’s no way to get in touch with anyone who knows you. No way to get back to an environment that might help you regain your own memories.
Dean shakes his head quickly. “No, no! I’m super turned on, I swear. I don’t--I don’t know what’s wrong.” Embarrassment rushes through him, a sickly hot rush that makes his palms sweat. Normally, Cas makes him feel like a 20-something again, getting hard at the hint of a stiff breeze. He’s never had a problem in the past with him.
The moonlight draws sharp lines down Cas’ face as he looks at Dean. “You need to get to safety, Dean,” he says. “What Zachariah said was true. They’re going to keep coming for me, and they don’t care who they have to hurt to do it. Please, we have to go.” He holds out his hand again, plaintive.
Dean bursts out laughing, the noise startled out of him by Cas’ earnestly deadpan delivery. The fucker hasn’t broken, either, but there’s a clearly smug glint in his eyes.
“I’ll ask Charlie what your favorite Hallmark movie is, I’m sure she knows,” Cas says with a sideways smirk.
Dean cuts her off. “Charlie, I need your help. Please. Sam’s missing, Rowena too, and I think they were taken, but I don’t know where they went. Can you track Sam’s phone? I think he still has it, I’ve been calling him over and over again and it just goes straight to voicemail.”
. Yeah, Dean’s known for most of his life that to the rest of his family, he’s broken -- he just didn’t think he’d get confirmation from his own brother.
“God hates me,” Dean whines, doesn’t care that he sounds so pathetic.
He swipes his thumb across the screen, holding the phone against his ear. “Cas? What’s up?” he asks, turning off the sink.
Dean had expected it, but he still grins at the way Cas’ eyes widen with interest as they pull up to a small lake about a 40 minute drive outside of town. It’s a perfect day for swimming and general lakeside activities -- the sun glints off the dark, placid surface of the water as perfectly white, fluffy clouds drift by, no hint of an afternoon summer storm hidden in their depths. The small strip of sandy shoreline isn’t too crowded, thanks to the fact that it’s a weekday and most people are at work. There are a few groups and families dotting the picnic tables and grills that ring the lakeside, and beyond the roped off swimming area, a dad and his two daughters canoe slowly past, the girls shrieking in delight.
“Well, the angel wardings in here seem to need recharging,” Cas bristles at that, “don’t worry tweetiepie. The warding shouldn’t affect you. Only angels trying to locate or enter the bunker.” He visibly relaxes as she continues talking, “The black grimoire is capable of many things. Last I checked, albeit it many moons ago, there is a spell that should charge up these Sigils.”
Dean watches over Cas, yellow light emitting from his palm onto his stomach. It’s slightly uncomfortable making him cringe, but nothing is really happening. A few moments pass and Dean is beginning to grow impatient. He shifts under the yellow light as a strong thumping rings in his ears.
Lazily throwing on his t-shirt, boxers and pants, that were thrown on the floor, his mind races. Automatically his hands rake through his hair as he tries to piece together what
“I’m glad man, but we gotta keep the excitement between us.”
“Yes. That is common.” Cas nods, “It will hopefully ease over time. This will all become easier. I promise.”
“Hello.” Cas replies, his smile can be heard over the line, “Just checking in. How are you holding up?”
Cas looks down, chuckles and cups a hand to his abdomen, “Hello little one.” He whispers.
Lucifer considers for a moment, “Well no, but it’s either trusting me or being subject to the wrath of those tight asses upstairs. Your choice.”
“Thanks.” Cas beams, his expression returning to his signature furrowed brow, “But what about my grace? If we need to ward against heaven, I can’t stay with Dean.”
Sam bites the inside of his cheek to resist the urge to smile.
“No. No we didn’t.” He takes a beat, the anger that has been boiling now becoming more prevalent. “Because you stole my memories and you threatened to “tear me apart”. And you made me repeatedly act out Dean Winchester’s murder.” His voice is starting to rise, so he lowers it, stepping closer to her. The two angels now only inches apart, “And you killed many, many people.”
“Shit. Have you got anything to do a purification ritual?” Dean sounds more stressed than Sam.
“Gifts?” Dean spits, “What, a one-way ticket to the cage? I’ll pass.”
“Of course Dean.” Sam nods.
Sam sits at the map table in the kitchen with his phone by his side, Cas’ number glowing on the screen. He had called him countless times in the past month, every one of them going to voicemail. Something was going on, but Sam couldn’t voice this without getting his head bitten off or Dean retreating to his room in a huff.
They exchange a look that expresses more words than either of them can muster. Cas’ eyes are glossy as he looks at Dean. A familiar feeling wells up amidst the chaos of pain. Failure. The same feeling that he would get when John would find out he had backed out of a case. Or, when he had left his post beside Sam. Dean had been selfish, ignorance and denial clouding his judgement. He’s almost 5 months pregnant God damn it.
“Positions? Location?” Dean echoes nervously, feeling very out of his depth. He places a nervous hand to his stomach.
“That doesn’t seem like just an “ache” Dean.” Cas warns.
~~~~~
The noise of his older brother sifting through their groceries, causes Sam to look up. Dean is wearing some old, baggy sweatpants that he hasn’t worn in at least 5 years. He quirks a brow, “Are those sweatpants?”
His phone has multiple missed calls from Sam, and previously he left them unread. Untouched. He couldn’t bear the thought of disappointing Sam. He couldn’t burden him with the true gravity of the situation. Was it wrong of him to avoid both the Winchesters like this? His thoughts are cut short as Sam talks.
After saying their goodbyes, Cas and Sam leave for Michigan. Dean waves them off as they go, and it takes everything in his being to restrain his jealousy.
“Lucifer. Entrance. He knows.” Are the only words that come out of his mouth. The pregnant hunter and angel flash wild looks and follow after Sam down the hallway and into the entrance.
“Hey Sammy.” Dean says in a cheery tone, he approaches Sam who doesn’t respond at first and looks over his shoulder, “Whatcha readin’?” He then plonks himself down and looks over to some of the various papers strewn about the table.
“Come on.” Dean begs, laying on his back and sucking in a sharp breath. He groans as he tries to button up his pants over his stomach. “God damn it!” He growls.
Sam winces, “No, and that’s the exact reason we want to help you out. Besides, Rowena’s aiding spell will only last so long and we have no idea how strong it will be.”
“And the murders started happening a month ago?” Sam recounts noncommittally, not looking up from his notepad.
“Hey. No mushy rom-com moments.” Dean squirms, not meaning it in the slightest.
Cas sits beside Dean and places his hand on top of Dean’s in reassurance, “I understand this is difficult Dean. Adjusting to Nephilim’s presence was something that took me by surprise as well-“
There are two voices coming from the entrance of the bunker. One, Cas, is familiar while the second voice isn’t. He notes that he’ll investigate after he’s taken a leak. The need has become more urgent now that he’s standing up.
While Sam mumbles his awkward one-sided conversation, Dean turns to look over at Cas, a small grin playing at his lips. Cas looks nervous, his eyes a little wilder than usual.
Sam sighs with a small smile as he undoes his shoelaces, “Got it Cas.” He then stops, “Wait, but you sleep with Dean?”
“Hi,” Dean whispers back, smiling against the kiss.
Dean trudges slowly into the kitchen, heading straight for the fridge.
Sam reaches for his phone frantically and presses Dean’s contact.
pregnant there man.” He says, gesturing a pen towards Dean’s growing stomach. Dean narrows his eyes dangerously.
Sam thinks. His jaw clenches, “Well, thanks for your “visit”, now close the door on the way out.” He spits poisonously, gun still at the ready.
“You’re killing me.” Dean whispers, interlocking them in another kiss. Cas kisses back passionately, placing a hand on Dean’s chest. A finger brushes lightly against his peck. Suddenly, Dean recoils from the kiss, a wild look present in his eyes. The touch, although gentle,
“Yep. Friggin witches probably did it.”
God, Dean is really in deeper than he ever thought he would be. Not that getting pregnant with his and Cas’ kid was ever on his bucket list.
He exits the bathroom and slowly plods his way to the entrance. As graceful as he can with his large stomach, he attempts to tip-toe towards the voices as they become increasingly louder. Hiding behind one of the bookshelves in the library, he tries to get a better look.
The heartbeat only lasts a few seconds before Cas pulls away and looks to Dean. The hunter’s mouth is slightly agape, and his eyes are teary.
image rattling around in his brain.
Dean looks to Cas with a quirked brow, “What?”
“It was fine,” Dean says, gently easing himself down onto the chair beside Sam. In recent weeks, his stomach has grown from ‘plausibly deniable beer-gut’ to ‘full-on-bump’. “A little busy, but we were in and out of there pretty fast. The entire time Cas looked like he was going to smite the next person that gave me a side eye.” He considers his bump for a moment, feeling a flutter of movement from within, unaware of the observing eyes.
“You are unable to lift heavy things.”
“Yes.” Cas recites. His demeanour juxtaposing the nervousness blooming in his stomach, “I was going to earlier, but I feared it would be unwise to take advantage of Dean while he was unconscious.” He makes a pointed gaze at Dean. Dean just huffs and rolls his eyes.
“About
Dean’s breath slips from his lungs unexpectedly. He’s left speechless. Cas is willing to sacrifice himself yet again for him.
“I understood you needed space. And after the conception of the Nephilim, I needed to distance myself as well.” Dean can feel the weight in his words. A saddened expression dances across his face for a moment. Only a moment, before he flashes a smile down to Dean’s abdomen.
The disturbance happened suddenly. It shook Cas to his core, making him wince as his vision swam. It took time to gather himself after the initial shock. But his mind had smashed to a million pieces. Heaven’s harsh scolds clouding his judgement. It was unnatural force, born from the throes of carelessness.
She nods with apprehension, the round glasses on her face falling down her crooked nose, “Of course, deary. I was there when we got my Brian cremated. But that was years ago, why would you be asking now?”
“Yeah figures,” He huffs, making Sam quirk a brow, “The largest library of supernatural lore and we can’t find anything to help us, just for a change.” He quips, his sour tone from earlier creeping back into his words.
“Are you alright?” Cas is staring at him, but his hand lands on top of Dean’s on his middle.
Surprising even himself, Dean doesn’t shrug her off. He just looks down to his bump, his palm pressing against the steady jolting from within. “Alright, I’ll bite.” He clears his throat, still not able to meet with her gaze, “I feel like hammered crap.” He swallows back the burning tingle of his eyes, “I-I’m just huge. Like I’m a blimp and I still have like eight more weeks of growing to do! Nothing fits right anymore. I can’t go five minutes without having to pee. And the kid is always kickin’ me.” Dean is taken aback by how much he’s sharing. But he’s too worked up to back out now, “My back’s constantly hurting – no matter what the hell I’m doing. And-“ He hiccups a breath, desperately fighting the tears that are willing their way out, “I’m so scared to be dad.” He finally adds, in a cautious whisper.
“Well, at least you’re keeping yourself occupied. Thank you for letting me on this case, I know it’s difficult for you, but I think that if I hunt a bit now then there is less to do later.” There’s that pang of guilt again, it’s sharp and stabs Dean right in the chest. Cas sounds so hopeful and sweet. Hunting has helped him feel more useful around the bunker, given him a purpose outside protecting Dean. And yet, Dean is being selfish and going out on a hunt by himself and lying about it.
“As long as I am, I want no judgement for this absolute masterpiece.” He declares, making a disturbing sound of pleasure as he shovels a handful into his mouth.
“Well, Rowena has given us the aiding spell to help with general pain relief.” Cas concludes, continuing the conversation as if Dean isn’t going rigid next to him. Sam nods along at that, typing something on his laptop. Is he taking notes? “But we haven’t discussed positions or location.”
“Our Nephilim will be safe. If this talisman can ward us against heaven, then I can be here. Always by your side.” Cas whispers in the hunter’s ear.
Sam rolls his eyes and looks to Cas, “Dean wants to go on a case.” The younger Winchester declares loudly.
He then lets out another shaky pant, this time bracing a hand to the base of his swollen stomach. Cas’ eyes instinctively travel down to Dean’s hand. He’s panting and struggling a bit. Then a moment passes, and Dean relaxes.
It takes Dean a moment to process the new information. He slows his breathing down as the claustrophobia from earlier seeps into his bones. Cas’ touch only does so much to ground him. But trying to get used to this “new normal” is a big task, even for Dean Freaking Winchester. But eventually it clicks in his mind. If he has to be warded from angels, but can’t-
Sam winces, “Dude, you should take a load off. Maybe get some rest?” He tenses his shoulders in preparation for the berating of a lifetime.
Dean’s heart soars and his body tingles at the word. He tries to keep his composure, “What?”
“Sammy, I’m too tired for this.” Dean huffs, his free hand bracing against his back to fully face his brother. The large swell of his stomach bridges the gap between them, “What the hell are you talking about?”
Dean will never admit it to anyone but as looks through the nursery, tears cloud his vision. Running a hand along the crib he turns to Cas and Sam’s smiling faces.
“Yeah no.” Dean says firmly, “I don’t want our baby to be born a fish. Let’s stick to land only.”
“Uh,” Dean really doesn’t have an answer for that one. His silence is telling enough for the conversation to continue.
“I’m turning into Dad.” Dean concludes solemnly, breaking the blanketing silence. Sam tips his head in confusion, brows creasing. Dean shakes his head, “I went on a hunt instead of thinking of my kid.”
The younger hunter then holds back a yawn, “Alright, I am going to get my 4 hours. Do whatever you want but meet me back here in the morning.” Cas nods.
“Missed you.” Dean mumbles and wraps his arms around Cas’ waist. He stops as he can’t push against him all the way. The small swell of their baby is blocking them. The hunter frowns down at his stomach, “Hey.”
An anger boils to the surface as Sam puts two and two together in his head, “Wait, so if angels were able to detect the presence… Were you able to detect it?”
The angel shakes his head. Reasoning with a hormonal, stubborn hunter will get him nowhere. He looks to Sam, “Sam, I will work the case with you.” Dean squirms under the stare thrown his way, “Dean, I want you to stay here until we get back. We can shop together when I return.”
That is all! Happy reading
“I’m going to sleep. That drive, mixed with the fight today? I’m beat.”
Cas stays silent for a few moments, causing Sam to bite his lip. “Okay.” Cas finalises his answer simply, truly the only word that could materialise in his mouth at that moment as he considers his next answer. After another few beats of silence, he speaks again, “I will take a look at dean.”
“Dean you don’t have to justify yourself. I took advantage of you.” The slight panic from earlier starts to creep back into his eyes.
“Sammy! Finally, I thought that the welcome party was never going to come.”  Lucifer cracks coy smile.
Dean picks up his phone and dials their local pizza joint. He orders 2 large pepperoni pizzas, a loaf of garlic bread and a bottle of ginger ale – according to Sam it’s good for heart burn. With his feast at the ready and multiple seasons of Dr Sexy taped, Dean relaxes into his bed. Maybe house arrest won’t be so bad.
A strange heave of emotion grips at Cas’ throat. It’s suffocating. His mouth can’t seem to stay in coherence with his mind.
“Hey, it’ll be fine.” Dean croons over at his angel.
“Yes Dean, last night you confessed your innate desire for sexual intimacy with me.” Cas takes a beat, his head tilts, once again calculating Dean’s expression as it hardens with anger. “Was it wrong that we engaged in-“
“Is something wrong? I am busy at the moment.” Cas answers with a quick lie.
“I asked if you’re okay. You seem tired, maybe you should lay down?” The angel turns the stove down to a simmer and approaches Dean. A hand landing on his large bump.
“Anyway, I found us a case.” He states instead, turning around his screen to face Dean. Dean pipes up his head and hums in agreement, prompting Sam to continue, “Two men were murdered last night in their homes in Andover. No signs of breaking and entering, but get this, both victims had a handful of rocks and twigs stuffed down their throats.”
“Oh, you know, watching Dr Sexy reruns.” His response is awkward, maybe a little too forced. But Cas hums his agreement.
“What?” Is all Dean can manage as he pants through a – much less intense – cramping of his stomach.
After shucking off his sweats and shirt, Dean eases himself onto the bed slowly. He settles on his side – the only comfortable position now - and almost instantly, he can feel his whole body relax. Dean’s memory foam mattress was definitely calling his name.
Sam looks to Dean first, while Cas continues to watch the movie for a moment. The angel grabs the TV remote and actually pauses the movie. He really had been watching. He then looks down to Dean.
“I gotta take a break,” He leans back his very uncomfortable chair, trying to shift the tension in his lower back, “And a beer.”
Dean groans, his temper wearing thin, “Your clothes were filthy Sam, I wanted them clean.” When Sam doesn’t answer, but conceals his chuckle with a cough, Dean sighs, “And then, I saw the other piles of dirty laundry and thought I should get them ready before everything happens.” He adds sheepishly, shying away his gaze. Suddenly, the floor is the most interesting part of this conversation.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas starts, leaning into the gap he had made, bridging them closer, “You’re very kind.” He adds, a hand going to Dean’s face.
That is all. Happy reading! :)
Nowadays, Dean’s brow usually has a light glistening of sweat as burdened by lumbering around an extra the 20 pounds strapped to his middle. But as he pants a little more than he usually does as he sits. Cas notices that he’s
But right now, the kid is making sure that Dean knows that he’s been sitting in the chair for too long. He winces and braces his back.
“Winchesters.” Rowena mutters, sulking off to sit in the library.
That is all. Happy reading!
Cas calculates Lucifer, his face falling into its signature squint. Normally, the familiar look would cause Dean to hold back a smile. But Cas is thinking about something. Probably nothing good. “So, this “insurance”-“
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean feels his cheeks heat up as he looks between Sam and Cas. He’s missing something. “Seriously, is no one going to tell me what the hell is-“
He shields his eyes as the light turns on.
“Dean.” Cas steps towards him, his right hand stretches forward, ready to hold Dean’s arm and try to reason with the hunter. But Dean doesn’t want the contact. He doesn’t think before he reacts. On instinct he recoils from the touch and throws Cas a glare. The angel looks hurt, but pauses himself, a pained look in his eyes.
Dean turns to the coffee machine again and yep, no coffee ground left. He grumbles something under his breath and sits heavily down at the map table opposite Sam. His head falls into his hands. Sam just shakes his head and returns to his laptop. A nagging question sits behind his lips, but he chooses to bite it back, Dean doesn’t seem in the mood to talk.
“How long was I out?” Dean half jokes, but the comment sounds forced, making him cringe.
Cas shyly nods his understanding, “Yes. I’m sorry. I got excited.” Sam lets out a small laugh at that and elbows him lightly.
As Dean addresses his bump, rubbing a hand along his side, Cas feels a warmth flit in his grace. An adoration for the pure joy that his hunter radiates with. Then, a flicker of pain crosses Dean face briefly, his brows creasing, but it is immediately gone, a boyish smile replacing it. His attention once again focusing on his bloated midsection. The slight change in behaviour would go unnoticed by anyone. But not Cas.
A week after Dean’s ‘incident’ as Cas has come to call it, the baby started to move more. Small flutters turning into shifts and light jabs from within. Unfortunately for Cas these movements have only been felt by Dean, although they’ve tried to get him to feel them. Cas takes every opportunity to rest a hand on Dean’s stomach, hum songs or poke him to catch a small foot or hand. So far, nothing.
Sam lets out a mirthless laugh, “We thought we might come up against a cross-roads demon Dean! We’ve got squat for the ritual!” He yells, before getting thrashed against the wall.
Despite becoming closer in the past month, all the physical contact between them is still
“A drill in the head wasn’t gonna kill me. You should know that.” She seems too calm for Cas’ liking.
“Hey! Woah. Slow your roll there, Web M.D.” Dean interjects quickly, throwing his hands up in defence, “I am
Rowena nods and considers something, she tuts, “And, the pain might be a sign that your birth canal is starting to form.” She concludes hesitantly.
. Thank you, Cas.” He says, greedily taking the popcorn and ketchup. Sam cringes as he watches Dean squirt the condiment liberally into the bowl.
Sam stays unmoving, looking like he wants the infirmary to open up and swallow him whole.
“No.” Dean pales again and kneels over the toilet seat. Cas nods in understanding, as he only vomits bile. Once the hunter is finished, he rests his head against the cool porcelain. “This is terrible. I’ve officially thrown up everything I’ve ever eaten since 2005.”
“But nothing Dean.” Sam starts, wriggles a little closer to him, “Not once had Dad regretted going out on a hunt and leaving us.” Dean opens his mouth, but is stopped, “Not once had Dad made sure that he was doing the best for us. Not once did he try to be there for us.” Sam’s statements grow in intensity as he speaks, as if the words he is saying have been held back for a long time. “You’re trying to do the best that you can for you and Cas’ kid. Even if that means breaking old habits.” He smiles and makes a pointed gesture to Dean’s stomach, “Hell, you’re carrying the damn thing and still having doubts about if you’re a good parent or not.”
“Oh dear Dean, there a whole lot of crap those books won’t tell you.” He inspects the talisman in his hand, rolling the pendant between his fingers, “Hell, I don’t even know some of these Sigils. Call them… Biblical.”
The three of them converge in the entry, Dean having put on a shirt, and meet with Rowena’s smiling face.
“Thanks. And what are you doing, judgy?” Dean grunts, grabbing the components of his “breakfast” from the fridge. The meal of choice consisting of yogurt, peanut butter with a chopped banana on top.
Naomi takes a step back, scoffing, “Well forgive me for taking a few years to put my thoughts back in my skull!” Cas winces at the volume, “And after all that time recovering, I come to during a heaven-shattering revelation.” She starts to pace around her former garrison-mate, eyes narrowing, “That a Nephilim has been conceived on earth.”
“Peachy!” Is the sour response, “Just enjoying the “joys of pregnancy”!” Cas smiles at the use of his earlier reference.
“It seems that way,’ Cas nods, “Let’s go back to the bunker.”
Cas struggles to pull his gaze away from Dean’s, but eventually he does, “For now, Heaven is unable to track the Nephilim. Once the child has reached 14 weeks into the gestation period, dean will need to find better means of protection against them. That means that an advanced warding system will need to be put in place.”
“Are you mad with me Cas?”
Don’t push it Daddy, Dean thought, glancing at the man.
Still crying, Dean let go of his Daddy’s shirt. He knew Daddy wasn’t going far but he couldn’t stop feeling anxious and scared that he was going to disappear.
Castiel watched both boys cuddled against him, seeing tears running down the boys cheeks, he knew he needed to do something to make it right between them.
“Good boy,” Gabriel said. Slowly picking him up, Gabriel placed Dean in his arms, resting the boy’s head in its crock. “Let’s go find your new daddy, baby boy. I know he is dying to see you.”
Feeling the heaviness of the cloth diaper, he started to walk into Dean’s nursery. Moving over to the changing table, he tried to lay Dean down on the matt, but Dean was having none it. Letting out another loud squeal Dean tightened his hold around his Daddy’s neck.
Dean groaned into Castiel’s chest. Why was Daddy crying? He wasn’t the one with a sore ass.
Letting Michael drive, Gabriel sat in the passenger side so he could watch his baby in the back.
“Don’t thank me Cas. I was wrong and I know I said that I’d have spanked him, but even as mad as I was I don’t think I would have. We’ve made him a baby so he should be treated as such. I’m just glad he is okay with me.”
“Dean, would you like Daddy to get the Impala?”
“Shh..shh Deany boy, everything’s okay. Hmm, are you hungry baby boy?” Picking up a folk full of omelette, Gabriel held it to Dean’s mouth.
Gasping Gabriel put his hands on his checks, “Oh no!”
“Are you laughing at Daddy?” Castiel grinned as he tickled Dean under his chin. Dean tilted his head into Castiel’s fingers giggling at the feeling. “You’re too cute sweetheart,” Castiel added, moving his hand to comb Dean’s hair back. Dean sighed, grinning behind his pacifier. He really liked it when Castiel touched his face. Closing his eyes he leaning into the man’s touch. “My beautiful boy.”
Dean just looked at him. He didn’t know if he should tell Daddy. He didn’t want Daddy upset and think he ruined their day.
“Dean..I...” Sam tried to talk but crying took over, moving his arms around Dean, he hugged his big brother tightly. He had his Dean back.
Flicking though the pages Castiel started to wonder if he could do this with Dean. He always wanted to be a Daddy. Maybe he could be Dean’s Daddy.
“It's not time to make a change, Just relax, take it easy, You're still young, that's not your fault,
“It...it’s loud Unc..Mikey,” he whispered before hiding his face.
Thank you everyone for the comments and kudos, you are all amazing and a big help. please let me know what you think xxxx
Dean’s jaw slacks and he scrubs his face with his hands, “No- God Sammy you’re killing me with this! Next you’ll tell me I can’t have pie.”
“Yep. There has been a bunch of witchy activity reported there. I’m thinking a coven-“ Sam continues to speak about the case, but Dean can’t focus on his words. His mind buzzes with unanswered questions. Cas’ face flashing in his mind. He can’t place the fragments of memory together, but a heavy feeling of guilt and embarrassment weights him. But that could be the looming hangover that seems to only be getting worse in the stark artificial lighting of the bunker.
Dean puts his hands up in a joking defence, “No complaints here.”
A silence falls over the both of them, it has been happening more than Sam would like at the moment. He would have thought that after 8 years of friendship, they could be a little less quiet with one another. Granted the silence isn’t uncomfortable – the both of them just exist in the same room – but it would be nice to talk more often.
Sam blinks, “What?”
“Yeah you have.” Dean deadpans, sounding more irritated than he’d like. But he can’t shake Sam’s words out of his head.
He is standing in the mirror, frowning down at his belly. His stomach pokes over the top of his hot-dog pyjama pants. It sticks out a little awkwardly, a silver of skin poking out the bottom of his shirt. His bump may be small, but it’s still there
“Well Cas, that’s the thing. Dean is sick and it’s been going on for weeks. I don’t know what’s wrong with him, but he thinks he might have been hexed by the witches we came up against a couple months back.” Sam pauses, realising that his nervous ramblings are very fast and slows himself down, “I want you to take a look at him."
“Of course.” Sam says, gesturing for Cas to sit beside him. There is a pause as the Sheriff settles down into her seat.
Sam looks up from his laptop, at the couple opposite him. Cas is reading a baby book titled, “Your Newborn and You.” While Dean looks down at his phone, probably watching dog videos again. Just the other day he was bawling over a particularly cute one.
“When are you due?” Cas’ voices suddenly, his monotone drawl dragging Sam from his thoughts.
“Are you sure you’re not nesting Dean?” Sam teases lightly.
But, knowing Sam he’s probably read every book there is on the subject.
“We really just made a deal with the Devil.” Dean lets out a mirthless laugh, “And it was you two’s fault.” Cas frowns at that.
Sam’s brows crease, “Yeah…okay weirdo. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you willingly eat fruit.” The older hunter narrows his eyes dangerously, “At least that has nutrients I guess.”
He mentally scolded.
~~~~~
“And…A bottle of ketchup?” Sam dares to question, but by the hungry look in Dean’s eye he already has his answer.
Dean tries to keep his cool, despite the warmth radiating from the tentative touch, “It’s not all that interesting. Just unpacking groceries.” He tries to go with a more nonchalant reply, but his response is breathier than he would like. Cas rests his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
In his trench of thought, Dean stirs in Cas’ lap. “Ugh.” He grimaces, pressing a hand against his lower back.
He rests his head down on the cool concrete and lets out a cry, it’s weak and troubled as it echoes emptily back at him.
“You seem to be the one carrying the Nephilim.” Cas interrupts Dean’s anger.
The angel is actually sitting on a bench at a park, watching as children play on the equipment in front of him. Warm sunlight peppers his cheeks, and he was, until he was rudely interrupted, enjoying the serene calm of the day. Drinking in the vastness of the rolling green hills as children laughed and played. He found comfort in these moments, they reminded him of heaven. The stillness of the trees echoing the sounds of laughter filled him with a keen sense of joy.
His eyes are washed with an uncharacteristic serene. But his mouth his pressed into a firm line. He looks calmed. Shoulders relaxed and posture slouches only slightly. Dean searches for any clues on the angel’s face but finds nothing.
Cas hovers his hands over Dean, his eyes screwing shut. A soft yellow light emits from his hands as he scans from Dean’s head downward. The two Winchester brothers share cautioned glances.
“Hello Dean, I’m your new Daddy,” he whispered as he stroked Deans damp cheek with his finger.
(See the end of the chapter for
Still, with Dean roaring into his shoulder, Castiel patted lightly on Dean’s diaper feeling it was heavy in his hand.
Seeing his baby’s eyes locked on the screen he noticed Dean’s milk starting to dribble down the side of his mouth. Picking up the cloth, he wiped away the stream.
“Nearly done baby.”
“Uncle Mickey?”
“Hello there little one. I see you’ve woken up.”
Opening the door Gabriel stepped into the warm hallway. “Cassie?”
When Castiel finished, Dean nodded again with a smirk. Acting normal, Castiel stood with Dean in his arms and turned to his brother, “The pancakes were amazing Gabriel. Dean absolutely loved them, didn’t you baby?” Dean nodded, giving a little smile.
Sam smiled as he woke. He had had an amazing dream. He had been adopted and he was going to see Dean again. He had dreams like that before but they never felt as real as this one did. Snuggling into his covers, he realised he was very comfortable and warm. The covers at the hospital were thin and itchy, he never felt so cosy when he woke in the morning.
Gabriel didn’t know what to say, looking at his big brother he could see tears in the man’s blue eyes. Placing his hand on Michael’s shoulder he waited for the man to look at him.
“Gabriel! Slow down.”
Feeling Daddy pick him up, Dean came out of his thoughts. He looked down at himself to find that Daddy had him dressed.
Hearing a little knock, Castiel turned his head to see Gabriel standing in the doorway. Looking closely he sees his brother with one of the smaller bottles in his hand.
“Thank you.” Kissing her check, Gabriel opened the kitchen door, not noticing Hannah’s face turn red.
“Are you awake now baby.”
An excited smile fills Charlie’s face, but she feigns boredom. “Oh, is that it? You just want me to construct a fake identity from nothing? That’s practically child’s play.” She can’t hold the facade for long, though, and she breaks with a gleeful laugh. “I can start whipping something up this evening and turn you into a real boy by the end of the week, probably. How does that sound?”
“It’s okay,” he murmurs, shakes his head as Cas opens his mouth to protest. “You gotta save it, man. Don’t waste it on my clumsy ass right now.”
“You may want to close your eyes,” Dean warns as he twists the doorknob. “It’s going to be bright, and you need to adjust.”
The sun is up but still weak, casting a pale light in between the deep shadows that crisscross haphazardly across the street. It’s nearly April but Dean’s pretty sure he saw snow in the forecast for next week. “Shoulda brought a scarf today,” he grumbles, tucking his face into the flimsy collar of his coat as best he can. It doesn’t do much to help against the biting wind. Fucking Midwestern winters that won’t just give up and let spring come early for a change.
Cas notices. Dean can tell he does, from the way his eyes go wide and then considering, from the way he can feel Cas’ gaze follow him across the room. Dean darts his tongue out to wet his lower lip, trying to hide a grin as he feels Cas’ eyes burrow into his back as he walks away.
“Holy shit, what happened? Are you okay?” he asks, using his shoulder to help Cas stand. “Did you hit your head?” He quickly looks Cas over for any visible bruises or wounds, but doesn’t see anything.
Dean chews on his lower lip, torn by the decision he’s about to make. “I need you to stay here,” he says, putting up a hand to stop Charlie’s immediate protests. “No, seriously. I’ll pay for you to get a room here somewhere, or to rent a car and drive home, but you can’t come with me. Because I need you to track my phone, okay? Make sure it doesn’t go anywhere crazy, but if it does, do whatever you can to get in touch with Cas and tell him the situation. Tell him I’ve gone after Sam and Rowena, but I’ve been taken, or whatever.”
“Yeah, he blew me off for lunch again, but I actually got to talk to him for a bit this time, which was nice,” Dean huffs. “Still waist-deep in his research, the nerd.”
Sam’s fists clench at his sides, his jaw trembling as he says, “I wish you would trust me. What happened before isn’t happening again. I’m not using vervenalin, this isn’t some other drug, this is real! I don’t know what else to say!”
Charlie’s faint laugh follows him as he opens the fridge with a snort. “Nah, I’m a regular degular human just like you and Dean. He calls me a technomancer because he’s a nerd who’s read one too many bad sci-fi books.”
“God, not this again,” Sam rolls his eyes. “How many times do I have to say I’m fine?” He stands behind Dean, watching as he hooks up the power supply and begins connecting cables to various ports. The monitor turns on with an electrical hum, different colored lines running in unsynchronized blinks across the main screen. The secondary screen remains blank, though a small green light along the panel turns on.
And it must be the wrong thing to say, somehow, because he can practically see the shutters come down in Cas’ eyes, and he looks away from Dean. Down at the floor instead. The map table’s between them and Dean is struck by the sudden image of a ship dashing itself to pieces, trying to get closer to shore.
“I just finished my shift and was walking to meet Cas here to go get coffee, when the werewolf jumped out of the bushes and attacked me. I’m not sure how they managed to only partially shift, since we’re at least two weeks away from the next full moon, but I think the pain of a partial shift may be to blame for the aggression. If anything, you should be checking on them, not me.” Dean tries to wave away the nurses’ hands, suddenly grouchy as the adrenaline begins to wear off.
should be doing right now. But instead, I’m talking to you. The human so desperate that he traveled along the border between sleep and death only to arrive at oblivion.” It chuckles, a considering noise, the sound raising the hair on the back of Dean’s neck. “I wonder how long you have to stay asleep before you become mine?”
His hands are in Cas’ hair, messing it up probably, but Cas has his own hands fisted in Dean’s shirt, his mouth hot and wet and expansive beneath Dean’s own. Heat curls at the base of his spine, ignites into an inferno as he feels Cas hard underneath him, licking up his nerves until he thinks he might shake apart. He thinks about getting on his knees for Cas, about spreading Cas out on a bed and sucking him in, and something inside of him clenches and bucks.
There’s some rustling on Sam’s end, like he’s switching his phone to another ear. Then another sigh. “I dunno, Dean, I’m honestly just super busy right now. You heard about all the other werewolves on the same day that you were attacked, right? All partially shifted and attacked people, too? There were a whole bunch of them across the state that it happened to. I think a couple of them killed people, and a few of them actually died from the pain.”
Thankfully, things have been mostly quiet in the hunting world while Dean and Sam have been out of commission, so to speak. When anything does pop up, they’re able to call someone else to handle it, which makes Dean chafe a bit, but it’s better than getting dead. And spending a few days resting in the bunker is actually pretty nice. With Cas back and actually talking to him, it all feels so much… lighter than it did before. Less empty. Like Dean can breathe again.
Unease curls under Dean’s jaw and he asks, “What does that mean?” It comes out sharper than he intended, too suspicious. The unease slides down the back of his throat and takes root in his gut.
His mouth twists and he raises a hand to scrub against the back of his neck. “Guess I ruined the mood,” he says with a dry chuckle.
Maybe it doesn’t really matter.
Except--
Back in the living room, Castiel is examining one of the larger bandages on his side covering a laceration that runs from his oblique to nearly up to his shoulder blade, his back to Dean. Thankfully it hadn’t required stitches -- which had been unexpected -- but Dean had hissed in sympathy as he’d cleaned it out, because whatever had left it had been nasty.
“It’s so great to meet you!” she says, stepping back and clapping her hands together. “Dean has mentioned picking up a new roommate a couple of times, but he’s been super locked down about the details. So, first question: light side or dark side?”
“That wasn’t my question.” Rowena shakes her head. “Would you be able to slot the shard of bone back into its rightful place in their body?”
Castiel thinks that if they weren’t fighting God, if he didn’t know about Jack and Billie’s plan, if this was just an ordinary, nondescript day --
“Oooh, Cas, huh? Gone to a nickname already?” she teases, but follows him further into the apartment. Cas is sitting on the couch, reading some book on magic theory that Sam had given him the last time they’d all had lunch together, but he looks up and smiles when Dean and Charlie walk in.
Dean clears his throat. “You decent?” he asks after a few moments.
“Your boss is a saint,” Dean says as they get into the car. He turns the radio volume down low, trying to keep it just loud enough that it will cover the sounds of the road without hurting Cas’ head.
Cas is staring down between them, brows knit tightly, and Dean realizes that he’s still… soft. Like “I’ve been reading about horrible witch rituals and all their nasty bodily fluids for the past three hours” soft.
Dean lets himself touch the side of Cas’ face again, traces the line of his cheek, memorizing the curve of his grin. Cas brings his own hand up, capturing Dean’s so he can turn and kiss his palm. Overhead, the dawn-pink clouds slowly begin to fade to white as daybreak fades into morning.
But then Cas is there, throwing a silver-gray hide -- his own sealskin! -- over the baby just as the flames start to lick the ground around him. White-hot flames twist over the skin in an instant, but it’s thick and protective like a fire blanket, and Cas scoops the baby up, unharmed, dancing out of the way. He leaves the silver hide behind, running for the protection of the nearby shoreline.
Instead, he’s met with feverishly bright yellow eyes and a fanged grimace. A snarl rips through the air, pained and
“Come in,” a lilting voice calls from inside. Sam pushes open the door, revealing Rowena perched on top of a large mahogany desk, scribbling notes down on a pad, a flowing blue gown draped elegantly down her shoulders. A delicate-looking china teacup hovers in the air next to her, steam wisping from the surface. She looks up as the three of them enter, taking the cup and sipping from it. “Samuel, I’ve told you,” she admonishes, “you don’t have to knock before coming into my office.”
“Yeah, that’s something we’re gonna have a chat about soon, too,” she threatens.
been his plan. He knows his own place in the narrative; the Winchesters are the messengers of God’s destruction, preparing and protecting Jack for his confrontation with the cosmic entities who have played havoc with their lives for so long. Castiel is… superfluous. If he must trade his life for Jack’s, well. He’s done it once already, even if the bill hasn’t come quite due yet. Dean of all people should understand.
“Okay,” Dean echoes, a little dazed, leans into the kiss because how can he not, even when it’ll probably be bad? And this one is… well, it’s nearly good, actually, their mouths sliding together, Cas’ lips a little chapped against his own, stubble brushing against his cheek. Dean tries to keep himself in check, keep his lips closed so he can’t ruin the kiss, but when Cas presses his tongue into his mouth, he lets himself fall into it with a moan, hands coming up to grip at Cas’ shoulders. The kiss turns from good to great, actually, and Dean loses himself a little bit, closing his eyes as Cas bites down on his lower lip. Not hard, not painful, but the way he knows Dean likes it, the way he knows will make Dean gasp into Cas’ mouth.
Once Dean had finished eating Castiel handed Gabriel the bottle. “Casey, I’ve never done this before,” Gabriel said, holding the bottle looking unsure.
Hiccupping as he cried, Sam lay his head on Gabriel’s shoulder. He really hoped what Gabriel said was true. He didn’t want Dean to hate him. “See him?” Sam mumbled into Gabriel’s shirt.
“Good idea, it has to be suitable for Dean to watch,” Castiel stated making himself and Dean comfortable under a blanket.
“Please Dean, you have to go in your chair.”
Hearing his Daddy, Sam groaned, feeling his cheeks warm. Why did Daddy ask that? Now Dean will know he uses diapers.
“Oh shush you,” Gabriel felt his face warm. Seeing Sam clap his hand over his mouth, he knew Sam was finding Michael rather funny, which was just odd in his opinion. His big brother wasn’t the funny type, but it was good to see Sam was getting on with Michael so well and that his brother was trying.
Dean knew he wasn’t Castiel, but he was hating looking at Michael because he looked so much like the man he was missing, making him want to cry when he thought of his daddy.
Gabriel sighed, lightly hitting his phone to his forehead. He really had hoped Castiel would say yes.
“Yeah,” Dean said, nodding his head, frowning towards his Daddy.
Suddenly Dean hears something that sounds like a screeching banshee. Turning his head back into Gabriel he saw two women coming up to them, smiling.
Wrapping his arms around Dean’s back, Sam pulled Dean’s head under his chin causing Dean to wrap his arm around Sam’s stomach.
“Castiel, I have to take him into the bedroom to start the treatment, but you can’t come with me.”
“Okay, Daddy’s back baby. Look what I have!” Putting on a smile, Castiel placed the bowl on the tray in front of his boy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seeing his baby so happy, Castiel rolled his eyes, he knew there was no way he would say no to his beautiful boy.
“Bye Uncle Cas. Can I give Deany a kiss too?” she asked shyly. Holding Dean up, Hannah leaned Charlie in so she could kiss the top of Dean’s head. “Bye baby Dean, you be a good boy for Uncle Cas okay?”
Castiel grinned, placing a light kiss on his boy’s cheek, “Want Daddy pick for you?”
“I was just thinking you might like to get your baby something special from his Daddy, you go have a look round and I’ll take Dean with me.”
“Do you like that baby?” Castiel asked, kneeling down next to the tub. Dean nodded his head sluggishly. This was the best feeling he has had in ages.
Nodding Sam hugged the bee close to him. He wished he had one to. Maybe Dean would share her with him?
As soon as they stepped in Sam jumped at the nose of the other Littles and children running around playing with the toys. Being around so many loud and fast people was starting to make him feel nervous. Squeezing his Daddy’s hand, Sam quickly grabbed hold of Michael’s hand making the man jump.
How can Daddy say it was okay? John had abandoned his little brother, he had to go get him, he couldn’t leave him. But he couldn’t, his body didn’t work like it use to, he was stuck.
Dean’s eyes widened hearing Gabriel. He really didn’t want to hear this. It was bad enough knowing he was wearing a diaper, but these men expect him to use them? Lying in this Cas’s arms, Dean groaned hoping they wound stop talking.
Castiel was loving how happy his baby looked, his boy was so cute as he waited with his mouth wide open for more.
“The cars are inside kiddo. This show room doesn’t leave their cars outside, some of them are too special to be left outside.” Dean looked at him, confused. Shaking his head, Gabriel kissed his nephew’s cheek. He had a feeling Dean was going to love what was inside this place.
“I thought you made it so that single people can’t adopt, only couples?” Lilith said, looking confused.
“Well, he did have an accident after I cleaned him up. He only wet, he hasn’t messed yet.”
Wrinkling up his nose Dean shock his head, “...nu...”
“What did I do?” the man asked, looking at the brothers like a deer in headlights.
Dean hadn’t watched TV in, well, ever. His dad wouldn’t let him, even after school his dad always told him and his little brother Sam to go up to their rooms and not come out and bother him. He could remember one time he did try watching the tv once. Dean had snuck down while his dad was asleep, he must have been watching for about five minutes before his dad came thundering down the stairs. Feeling himself cringe Dean tried to not think about it, he just remembered why he never tried again after that.
“If I remember rightly Gabriel, I used to change your diapers,” Michael smirked, “Your Daddy used to run around half naked when I changed him Samuel. He used to think he was so funny running away from me.” Michael winked towards Sam.
Feeling his cheeks warm Dean looked away from his Daddy, feeling a little embarrassed. “Yeah.”
Feeling Daddy bounce his knee, Dean looked round meeting his Daddy’s blue eyes.
“His father, a John Winchester. The records say that he demanded money for the boy, but when we did a background check on him, he found out and did a runner, leaving the boy here.”
“Hey Uncle Cas’s baby Dean. I’m Charlie. You can be my friend coz …coz Uncle Cas is my friend, and-and we have to play fun games, okay?” Charlie said, smiling down at Dean.
“I have missed you,” Castiel whispered leaning into his touch.
Sucking on the pacifier Dean felt his head start to hurt. Looking at the back of Castiel’s head, the man was sitting in the front seat chatting away to Gabriel about things he really wasn’t listening to. The dark haired man, from what Dean had learnt in the short time he had been with him, seemed to be a genuinely nice guy. He had been nothing but kind and loving and he hadn’t shown any inclination that he was going to hurt Dean. This was the problem that had Dean feeling so confused. A part of him was actually enjoying the attention.
