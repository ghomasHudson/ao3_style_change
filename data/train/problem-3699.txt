"Then I would suggest you sing your lullaby before they mangle you because it's you who keeps them trapped," Dean replied more courageously than he felt.
At this time, he thought about his job for the first time. By means of the physiotherapist and also because he was putting himself under pressure, he was able to make great progress a short time later and made the first wobbly attempts at walking. He was also promised to spend Christmas at home.
"If you had not been. You saved my life!"
"Hey, Tony ..."
"That was very brave what you did two weeks ago."
"Your first battlefield injury," Dean grinned when he saw his boyfriend standing in front of the bathroom mirror and hugged him from behind.
The hunter meant everything to him, and he would do anything for Dean.
So, for one, there was the fact that after the procedure, there was a possibility that he no longer felt sexual, and then, on the other side, a very long, painful process, the outcome of which was uncertain. That would change him entirely and possibly cost his job.
Voight and Platt exchanged a look and finally nodded.
With all his might he tried to hold back the rising tears.
These whispered and honest words produced goose bumps on Cas's body despite the heat and smiling he replyed the words.
"Not yet," the black-haired man whispered, gently scratching Dean's neck with his fingers and breathing soft kisses on the smooth skin of his neck.
Since Cas's health, apart from the coma, was currently not in great shape, Dean had to pass through a lock and got a reasonably sterile turquoise-green tunic.
"I'm fine, look for Dawson," she screamed as Kelly checked her pulse.
A little carelessness and a few seconds later Cas found himself lying on his back.
"Do not know if you're allowed in," the dark blonde sniffed.
"Hey. Damn it all, stop the nonsense!" Chief Boden screamed and knocked over a chair when he heard the screaming of his crew. "What the hell is going on here?!"
"Nice to see you," the friendly, older man grinned and shook his hand, but Dean immediately pulled him into a hug and sighed with relief.
"Maybe we got married too soon, or he wanted to go back to a woman ..." he sighed, wiping the tears from his face with the sleeve of his shirt and taking a sip of coffee while Kim just looked at him and did not know what she should say. She could only be there for him.
"Dude. Completely wrong time, "the dark blonde policeman snorted and pushed him slightly in the side.
"To drive the ambulance, you have to earn first."
"And she's coming ..." Trudy muttered as she saw the dark-haired woman come in at the door.
That he would be faster with a damn car, Dean thought as he made his way. He knew his goal, and even if it was not far, it felt like an eternity. The policeman had no idea what to expect. Without a weapon, safety vest and support, he ran to the warehouse, praying not to be late. He did not know how many he had to expect, only knew that he had to free Cas.
As if of course, his hands clung to Dean's hips, while the other's hands hid in the soft, black hair, caressing his cheeks tenderly, and finally coming to rest on the nape of his neck.
"You smell so good, and you taste even better."
Under no circumstances did he want to leave here, but to experience Adam's rescue.
Damn bastard, where was he? On the way to the car, he thought through the places where the fireman could be. When he arrived at the bridge at high speed, he barely trusted his eyes. He remained seated for a moment. Cas looked so lost, and for a moment Dean feared that he might do something stupid, but he ignored the chill that spilled over his spine and got out in no time. Kim stayed in the car.
A brief giggle escaped him at the thought that he was already engaged, but had not even had sex with the other. That was the new Dean Winchester, and admittedly, he was a bit proud of himself.
"Listen. This spell only works once. If it works, decide where you want to go." This decision was not difficult, because Dean was not obsessed. Neither an angel nor a demon.
"You have more enemies than you think," she grinned, looking at her fingernails.
He did not know the feeling of jealousy, but he did not feel well.
There was not much on the video, but one thing caught Dean's eye. As the camera swiveled from Cas to the kidnapper, he recognized the brown-and-white tiled floor and the shelf of various chemicals. He was sure it was this storeroom where they had caught the drug lord back then.
But there was never any money, and so he always had to borrow gloves. And then there were these used boxing gloves in a shop window system. Always after school, he stopped and imagined what it would be like if he had had his own boxing gloves. But he never said anything because he knew it was impossible and his parents could not afford it.
'Good morning, this side next to me will hopefully not be empty for long'
"Are you crazy?" The redhead shrieked and wriggled out of the grips.
"Oh, how boring. Neighborhood dispute."
At first, only a low squeaking sound was heard, followed by a noise that the men knew too well. As if rooted to the spot, Joe stopped and looked around for help as he felt the ground beneath his feet give way only slightly, then open and he plunged into the fiery hell.
Completely perplexed, Dean stared at the display, then at the two ladies who looked at him questioningly.
Then there was silence again. So someone was here, and the hunter was determined to find it. He called again and again until he was almost hoarse, when suddenly the voice stuck in his throat, because he saw a small light, as from a street lamp.
A few minutes passed without anyone saying anything. Dean, because he had to sort out the impressions of the previous experience, and Cas because he was mentally trying to calm his aching penis.
"Tony has a freight elevator back there," he continued, handing out little kisses around his neck, and could not be dissuaded when his husband pushed him away quickly.
Three days before ...
"Has any of you fled half mast? Do it." With that, he turned to Severide and went back to his office.
"That might have been a challenge, but I did not give up," he laughed, and the others joined in to pick up the slightly depressed mood.
In his mind, he tried to imagine his face again and again. The bright emerald eyes, the sassy, short-cropped hair, the beautiful smile, and the cheeky sayings he always had on his lips. If he caught that moment and fell into a deep sleep, he dreamed of him. Of them both. From work, from the common home.
Even though Dean was a police officer, he suddenly felt like a small child. On the other hand, he was also glad that someone was there.
"Kim Burgess. I look forward to working with you, "she introduced herself with her sunny nature and handed Dean her hand, which of course immediately looked her up and down. But something about the look she gave him, which had changed within seconds, told him she could do it differently and the following words confirmed his guess.
Only then did he realize that Cas was almost naked and wondered when that happened. But he could not see a great deal, because the two men were lying too fast under the covers. No one said a word, both looked at each other, and even if none of them did it, each of the two wanted to reach out, feel strangers skin under their fingers. At some point, both fell asleep again, and the next time it was Dean who first opened his eyes as electric lightning flashed through his body.
The interview took a long time, a lot of heads rolled, but no one had heard anything about a human who had ended up in purgatory.
All that mattered to him was that his friend did not die because of him.
"You. Cas, you are the most beautiful and wonderful thing that has ever happened to me in my life. Your eyes, your lips ... "
"Do not you wear shoes?" Cruz screamed and everyone laughed.
After a few more bumps, Dean was also at the end. His sperm mixed with the warm water on Cas's stomach and chest and dripped onto the floor of the shower.
"Sure, there might be a bunch of explosives stored there, do that," was the sarcastic answer.
"What's your favorite Christmas memory, Dean?" Cruz asked, and everyone looked at him.
"Do you recognize something?" Ruzek asked, but Dean shook his head, determined to go there alone.
Panting, he finally sat and clung convulsively to the handles, their lips were the only thing that moved.
"I love you."
And after Dean had heard of some of these fears, he also insisted on sleeping with him in the narrow bed the next night.
"Naturally. I promise, and I have Cas."
Gabriel tried to comfort his boyfriend and accepted that he was blaming him for not saving his brother, he accepted that he was hammering wildly on his chest, accepting that he was raging and screaming and so desperate that he could hardly calm him down. But he was holding him all the time, whispering to him, swallowing his own rising tears.
"Are you looking for Sylvie Brett?" A nurse asked, pulling him out of his thoughts. Nodding, he responded to this question, and with a relieved sigh he followed her to another station.
"Dean!" He yelled in a long-drawn-out tone from the bathroom.
That was the moment, one of the most beautiful sights for the black-haired. Then, when Dean's eyes widened and he was in the moment of total pleasure and liberation.
After thinking about it again, as he lay sleepless on the couch, he could have slapped himself for thinking something of Dean, and his husband probably thought now ... He did not want to imagine that. Not after all that the two had gone through.
It was just whispered words, but Cas heard each one of them. A renewed blush settled over his cheeks, and since he did not know what to answer, he was silent.
"Cas? May I come in?"
"You are beautiful, my angel. I love you. And this ... you're no less a man that makes no difference, "Dean whispered, eliciting a relieved sigh from the other.
Since he did not want to be idle, his hands caught in the short hair sometimes pulled slightly and then a little stronger. Every time Dean had to smile. The short stubble of that intimate hair tickled and scratched his nose and face, and Dean could not wait for them to regrow. When he finally put his full lips over the hard cock and took it slowly but steadily into his mouth, Cas escaped a shaky breath, fetched by a deep moan.
"Purgatory," Cas mumbled, tilting his head, thinking back to the time.
"I'm fine," Dean repeated annoyed and wriggled out of the medical grips.
Kim had become an excellent friend for him in the last few days. Not that he did not find her attractive, but that's why he did not want to screw it up. He also noticed that she had something going on with Ruzek and he did not want to mess with it.
Your life is my life.
"Should not have happened."
"Good morning, honey. You look good."
So many dangerous situations had the policeman overcome, so often facing death, and now he should not be able to do anything? The helplessness that rose in him, gnawed at the young man, made him kick the wooden bench he passed, before desperately settling on it and dropping his head on his hands. Dean was not one who gave up, no one whined and pitied himself. But what should he do now? What could he do? Where was the straw of hope he could cling to?
"It's like this. They call us back here next week."
"And he kept yelling, 'armed and dangerous.' Say I'm armed and dangerous. "
There was not much to see except rocks, three small fires and an incredible amount of dust and smoke. Coughing and panting, he stood up, which was not easy, so he decided to crawl on his knees. Again and again, he called for Adam.
"And what does Dean say about that?"
He did the same the next hours? Days? Weeks? The hunter had lost track of time; he could see nothing, was alone and confused.
"Do you know where you are?"
He also decided to stop drinking so much, because he now knew where that could lead. After getting dressed and drinking a coffee, he noticed the note Dean had left him. Should he call? They could not go out of their way in the long run. They saw each other at Molly's, and at work.
The chief briefly clarified the matter with the shift's boss, and although he knew he needed to engage in some conversation afterward, it was a clear case and a personal issue for him and his team. And as it turned out, it was good that the fire brigade was there.
Strangely, he was not hungry or thirsty. Only the thoughts of his friends kept him from falling completely insane.
Neither said a word as they walked along the long, paved path, listening to the wind rustle through the leaves.
The young policeman looked him straight in the eye and took the cold hands of his husband in his own.
Dean had slept for about five minutes that night. Although his wardrobe was in front of the broken door, he still sat on the couch with his gun in his hand.
"Please kiss me," the dark blonde whispered, biting his lower lip full of desire.
"Can you remember now?"
And so it was. It was a boring job, and Dean wondered why anyone could get excited about it. Of course, being able to tackle the prisoners harder here also had its appeal, but basically, the action was missing.
The hunter coughed and gasped, and it took a few seconds for the angel to just staring at him, unable to say or do anything before he remembered and helped Dean up.
"That's so touching that I want to puke my guts," suddenly the voice of the kidnapper sounded and was accompanied by slow clapping.
"Cas!"
Shaking his head, Chief Boden held back the police officers who were about to storm the building after Voight told the Chief about the explosions possibly caused by propane gas bottles.
"It was his own fault. Just like that black-haired angel there," she smirked, pointing to Castiel, who only frowned at her with a questioning look.
As Dean took off his shirt to make himself comfortable in bed, Castiel could not help but stare at the beautiful, smooth, toned body.
And what the hell was that annoying beeping? Besides, his hand hurt as if something was inside. It felt like a knife ... It was not possible to swallow either. He had the feeling of suffocating, did not know that he was artificially ventilated.
"If it calms you, Dean is just as nervous," she chuckled.
The building plan was already on the hood of Boden's car, and it was not long before they figured out where the three were, and after a few minutes, the plan was fixed. Casey, Severide, and Otis set off.
At the same time, Voight had arrived in front of the warehouse with Antonio, watching a man get into an armored van and seem to be waiting for something.
With trembling hands, and after taking another deep breath, he cut open the paper, carefully opened the box, and the loud and horrified swallowing of the three could probably be heard throughout the police station.
Dean chuckled as he took Cas's hand, which trembled slightly, and put the ring on his finger.
Suddenly another gust of wind and the small angel walked purposefully towards Sam and kissed him.
"We have him and are on the way."
"That's nice," Dean slurred sleepy, and with his eyes closed, he clasped his husband even tighter. With a smile, Castiel grabbed the strong hands that lay around his chest and leans his head back.
"Oh, God!" Matt called a moment later and tore open the door even before the fire engine had come to a complete standstill. He was worried about his girlfriend and wanted to get to the car immediately.
"Damn, I was looking for you everywhere!"
"I'm sorry, but I'm gay," he murmured, shrugging apologetically.
Dean sighed a little sadly at the reaction and loss of warmth he had felt until a few moments ago.
Tenderly, Dean stroked Cas's knee as they both lay in the bathtub an hour later. With a shake of the head, the black-haired turned his head and kissed him briefly.
"It's not about Cas. I'm worried about you."
"We lose him again, where is that ...?!"
"See, those little sins punish God immediately," the young policeman smirked, giving him something to drink. But that hurt even more and shaking his head, the black-haired man waved.
"Hello?! I keep the store up there running. It would have gone even faster if I had not chatted with an old friend by coffee and cake."
I just want you for my own
Only what ... no matter ...
Somehow, Dean still could not believe he would be a married man in less than an hour.
"And you, do not be uptight, Novak," the blonde countered.
"Where do demons come when they die?" Sam asked.
"We have them. Cas has a gunshot wound. We're coming out now, "Casey said to his chief, smiling with relief. Then everything went very fast. Too fast that Dean's brain could handle it.
Sighing with satisfaction, Dean closed his eyes as he felt those soft but at the same time a bit rough hands of the firefighter on his chest, his fingers tracing every line leaving goose bumps on his well-toned body.
Even so, Castiel was in a mess of emotions. One second he thought that everything would be all right again, but the next one he was devastated again and broke into another crying fit that made him tremble.
Will laughed and Cas ... he tried, at least, but it ended in a fit of coughing.
Cas's body was stiff and rigid, his eyes wide open, and his face grew redder by the second.
The blonde was checking the equipment in the ambulance as Cas sat on the bed. She said that he had the sad puppy face and asked why.
Angels and demons. There were two options. Either they were grateful to him, but that was lunacy because they were trapped ... or they would kill him, but that was just nonsense, because he was already dead. In any case, he was sure that would not mean anything good.
If the dark blonde had not been so caught up in his feelings, he might have blushed.
"See, everything is fine," the dark blonde smirked satisfied, helping Cas on his feet and in his gown and escorting him to the bed. He then went out to take the result to one of the nurses and watched as quickly as possible to return to his great love.
Concentrated, he listened to the Chief and his instructions.
It was not even eight o'clock the next day when Dean returned to the hospital. There he told the staff because they did not want to put an extra bed in the sickroom, that he would sleep at the door if necessary. And Will knew that he was serious too because he had known him for a long time.
The chaplain was there too, and everyone gave him much courage and hope.
Once again, the young policeman turned around and waved goodbye to Cas, who had just dropped him off at the police station. Dean was happy. He did not have a car or money, nor did he feel secure in his apartment, but he knew that this could be more serious with Cas.
Cas was grateful and glad to have him. Dean encouraged him, promising him that it would work together and that he believed in him very firmly.
Dean was everything Cas always wanted and whoever would not dare would not win either. Or?
"Sammy?"
The Intelligence unit had also stopped working for two or three hours, but an emergency plan was ready. Gabriela was able to replace Cas, and Sergeant Platt was happy when she was allowed to patrol again while Dean could see the wedding relaxed.
"You may have a stubborn husband."
"And I advise you, do not screw it up again!"
And always someone was there. Often even the entire guard of the 51, because if an emergency came, you had no time to collect the rest of the crew.
"That's not possible!"
Castiel was well aware of the furtive glances that burned into his body and each time it tingled to the tips of his fingers. Looking around, he realized that he knew pretty much everyone, and even though he'd been there for almost a month now, the dark-haired cop had never really noticed him. Maybe it was because he was always in Molly's when the other one was not there.
The constant staring could not go on like that, but somebody had to take the first step.
"Okay, Gabe. Look in heaven."
"Maybe he's not into blondes," Kelly laughed and tickled her until Mouch directed them out of the room, who wanted to catch up on some sleep.
One pushed the other and then it happened. Dean’s head hit unhappy a stone and there he laid; unconscious. The other two idiots quickly ran away while Sam leaned over his brother.
"Hey, there he is again," Dean whispered, stroking Cas's hair as he slowly opened his tired eyes.
"Ok boys. Once the monster is tied up, you and Sam take it by the hand," she said to Cas." I'm talking the spell, and Gabriel cuts its head off. It is important that you do not let it go. No matter what happens."
"Do not try to move."
"Me too, I'm sorry I doubted that and ... this fight ..."
Groaning softly Cas clutched himself with slim, graceful fingers and slowly began to rub up and down. Dean could not help but watch for a moment.
Dean thought for a moment before answering.
Cas reached out and pulled him up.
"I can not anymore ..."
On the third day, thank goodness, this tube was removed from his throat and nose and then explained that the cut-out lymph nodes were sent to the pathologist who did a histological examination, which meant that the lymph nodes were cut into thin slices and looking for cancer cells.
"Ventricular fibrillation!" That was the doctor's word that burned deep into Dean's brain.
He was alone, sitting in a chair and did not know what hurt more. The wrists that were tightened with cable ties or his stomach, which had already had to take a few rubdowns, probably even a rib had broken. The young firefighter tried to think of something nice.
The applause was long, and the ceremony was beautiful.
"I miss you. Who will give me cooking tips now, who ..."
The heads moved towards each other. Too slow. Soft lips laid on each other and it took only a blink of an eye until both were merged into one passion. Slow and lazy, fast and nimble. Just as their mouths and tongues moved, their lower bodies rubbed against each other. For nothing in the world, Dean wanted to leave that position, even if it meant he was coming in his pants, like a fucking teenager.
"Water march!" The black-haired called and turned on.
Fainted by the anesthetic or painkiller, he felt very well in the circumstances and even sent a few text messages to his friends.
Everyone had a story ready; everyone tried to cheer up Cas.
Only slowly, already after he had closed his eyes again and tried to fall asleep in full clothes, he thought about these words. Nonsense. Of course, he wanted the other would reach over, and if he had not been so tired and unable to move, he would have taken over himself.
"Do you know what a date is today?"
"Thanks for everything, without you I would not have made it," Cas replied with tears in his eyes.
Then he said he was interested in boxing when he was thirteen.
"Great. The ship went down, and it was a life and death struggle. "
But there's nothing in order. The reckless action meant that a hole had burned into his protective suit, that Adam got little air, and this other idiot in custody, but the three were trapped. And then happened what was predictable.
"Be quiet, you wake everyone else," this figure said, and on closer inspection, it turned out to be someone Dean knew better than anyone else.
"Plus point for you. You followed the instructions. Does not help you!"
The smaller waited patiently at the door of Dean's room until Sam came.
Due to the weak light incident, the hunter noticed that this creature considered.
On the one hand, he felt relieved that everyone looked after him so well, on the other he was worried when he heard a woman's voice.
When Dean finally fell asleep, he found no peace in his dreams. Several years ago, when he started working for the police, an incident occurred that did not let him go.
Now the fireman knew again why he did not like doctors. Why the hell could not it just be a bump on the arm instead of ... down there?
But how much the subconscious heard, you could not check. Experience has shown, however, that talking to patients and having regular touches had a positive impact on the patient's condition.
"Wow ..."
"And has it always been your desire to become a police officer?"
"I know you can hear me, at least I believe in it," he whispered, squeezing his hand lightly, staring at it and sighing. What did he expect? That Cas would squeeze back?
"The angel is still missinging," the young policeman said and crossed his hands, so that Cas could climb on it. With a giggle, he shook his head and kissed Dean instead.
Several days passed and even if Dean did not show any signs, those words that had said that asshole, could not get out of his head. The experience of the last few years had shown that a case was far from complete when one of the bad guys had been caught because most of the friends were already waiting for a new chance.
"I just had to explain to a mother that her son is dead and you behave like idiots.
The wise words of the chaplain reinforced Dean's actions and he was so glad he was with them.
With a kiss on his forehead, he greeted him before he sat down on the bed and took Cas's hand in his own. It was a nice feeling to finally see him without that annoying, and admittedly, also a bit scary, tube. He also got used to the monitor's beeping. On the contrary, something was reassuring about hearing the powerful and regular heartbeat.
"Yes, I can be with him," he mumbled, looking at his sleeping husband.
"That was given to you."
Earlier than expected, that morning was there, and after a thorough shower, Dean was already at work, he sat in the car and drove to the Chicago Med. Some of the staff were not strangers to him, he knew them from work, from Molly's, or his stay at the hospital.
"Who's the guy at the bar?" He asked Mouch, who turned and grinned.
Dean was so edgy that he felt he had to run up the walls. It was worse than in captivity.
"Congratulations, kid," Hank Voight said, patting Dean on the shoulder.
Dawson and Casey teased lovingly behind the bar, Severide tuned his guitar, Dean was with Otis at the Christmas tree to give it the finishing touch, the chaplain had as always for everyone a few nice words. Gradually, the colleagues of the police, as well as Will Halstead came to the happy round.
"Will he bend a knee?" Mouch whispered, chuckling softly, but Trudy warned him to be quiet.
In between, Gabriela, Kelly, and Cas used the time to clear the tables and bring cakes and coffee, mixed with wonderfully scented candles.
Cas's smile turned into a grin when he heard the soft, happy whistling. The policeman stood with his back to him and wiped his hand over the fogged mirror, but stopped halfway in the movement when he saw in the mirror who was standing behind him.
"We have to find the portal," Sam murmured, dropping to the floor exhausted. "After a short nap."
"Is this a joke? Get out of here," he grinned back mischievously, hugging the dark-haired woman.
With his eyes closed, Dean tried to find somewhere to hold, because he felt that his legs gradually gave way. With one hand resting on the sink and the other buried in the thick hair of his fiancé, he threw his head back and had the sensation of burning as fireworks exploded in his cells.
"W ... wait. You have completed bets?!"
"Do not worry, colleague, my radio is on standby," he said, got up quickly and pulled his husband by the hand.
Dean sprang from his bed, turned around once more, and looked startled at his alarm clock. Yes, he had already seen correctly the first time.
"I'm sorry ... I ... Oh god!"
He looked a bit surprised even to be asked and cleared his throat briefly.
Cas shook his head inwardly because it did not seem that long.
Three days passed without further incident. That means ...
"You can expect that" Dean smirked, getting to his feet and shaking his hand. "Thanks, Doc."
Rolling her eyes, she replied that Severide took over babysitting in two hours.
There was a loud rumble of thunder and rain came through the broken window, dripping onto the floor as Dean moved closer to the trembling body and took Cas's hands in his. This window was too high up for anyone to get through and there was only one door in the small room, and it was locked. It was somehow ... hopeless.
"But!"
"The first thing I do is to spank your sweet little ass, should you say another word," Dean muttered, pulling him to his feet.
"Just a bright guy," Dean joked, because he knew no answer, possibly because he was human, but cleared his throat because his counterpart was not funny. "Listen. I want to go back because here, there is absolutely ... nothing?!"
And then this terrible incident that many of the two guards had to go through and Dean and himself had almost lost their lives. And then there was something the dark blonde had to tell him, and he was trying hard to hold back his tears and give his friend support when he told him the bad news.
"Who gave it?"
"Was in my locker."
The young firefighter opened the door for the men, and Dean could barely catch his partner as she sank to the floor, crying.
"Keep an eye on him," Boden said to Matt as Cas left.
"Yes but ..."
"I think that does not help," Gabe sighed softly in Sam's ear, whereupon the younger is staring at him in surprise. Giggling, the angel threw him a stealthy look and put Sam's hand on his crotch.
But Dean did not care, and slowly he opened the bathroom door. Immediately the other pulled his legs protectively against his body and clutched his lower legs. Since the surgery, his husband had not been able to see him, let alone touch him there. Cas had too much fear of the reaction.
Then, finally. Cas took Dean's hands and put them on his hips.
"We can not do that!" Dean warned, biting the back of his neck gently.
Will had to hold his glass because Dean hugged him so stormily and it finally amounted to a group embrace.
"I saw the light, and I thought you were not sleeping. I have just come from the shift and wanted to see how you are."
"Do that again," he whispered, laying his hand on the blanket, directly over Cas's heart. He waited tensely, one minute, two ...
"What are you doing?"
"You have some fever," the little older lady noticed as Cas brought out the thermometer under his armpit and handed it to her. "I'll give you a suppository."
"I know that," Dean replied, taking Cas in his arms and squeezing him, stroking his hair and back, whispering trivia into his ear until he calmed down.
"Her name was Rosita. She was my sister, went to university here and wanted to study medicine, and then she met you. She was young and pure, and you polluted her and then dropped her. Rosita had her whole life ahead of her. One night with you and there was nothing left of this happy girl when she found out she was pregnant."
'It was just the beginning,' was the note that lay bloodied on a piece of meat that was easy to identify as a heart. No human, thank God. But that did not make things much better. It did not help, and now Dean had to speak out because there was no way around the strict Trudy.
What they saw there when Sam opened the door was like a miracle.
"I'll kill you if you do not bring Sammy back to me," he whispered urgently to his brother, leaving no doubt as his eyes flashed blue for a moment.
"I ... Sarge, something happened. I have to go home."
That evening, Dean had made a decision. He did not want to go home. He missed the closeness of his husband. So he took off his shoes and jacket and thought for a moment how to do it. The bed was way too small for two full grown men.
Since neither of them could stand the uncertainty, the appointment was already held the next day. The two men sat in the waiting area of the oncology and Dean felt the fear that his husband had. Cas lowered his eyes; he could not bear it. Everywhere people were drawn by this disease. People with bald heads, people who were very thin. People who looked like they had a long ordeal. Should he be one of them soon? In what nightmare was he just caught here?
Cas nodded, sighing, but at the same moment, he was filled with happiness as his fiance stroked his naked torso.
"If I have money again," came the counter-response and both laughed.
Before God and our friends, I take you, to my husband. I want to love, respect and honor you. In good times and in bad times, in illness and health, until death separates us. Wear this ring as a symbol of our love and faithfulness. "
In a good mood, the two clasped their hands as they opened the large glass door to the fire station. A beautiful scent filled the room, as Cruz and Otis were already preparing the evening meal. That would be built later in the Molly's when all had end of work. After a warm welcome, Dean helped in the kitchen and Cas was put on the couch to 'rest'. The young firefighter acknowledged this with an eye-roll, but he did not stay seated for a long time.
Sergeant Voigt tried with all his might to keep his young policeman awake and had to control himself, not to panic.
Then everything went in quick succession. Dean wanted to buy a new TV and pay with his credit card, but it did not work, not even after the seller pulled it through for the fourth time. Since the young policeman did not have enough small change in his pocket, he ran to the nearest ATM to get cash. When he saw that his entire account was empty, it ran hot and cold down his back.
"Coma?!" the young man asked, frowning as he sat at the table, glancing at the open laptop.
Dean felt restricted, for Burgess did not leave his side. He was glad to go to the toilet alone at least. He even slept at her home, on the couch.
"It's pleasant ... petting me," Dean replied in a low, husky voice that continued to vibrate in each cell of Cas's body, and as the cop, as if by chance, moved his head back a bit, he sensed that the other was the same. That made Dean smile because now he had the answer to his mute question.
Most likely, there is no human being who did not immediately think of something bad if the patient was not in his room and it looked like no one had ever been there
"Come here," the fireman grinned wryly and wiggled his eyebrows. "The bed is big enough for the two of us. If you promise not to cross over."
"Hey guys, can you give us a hand?" Gabriela called as she opened the two rear doors.
Sighing longingly, he looked into his husband's face and wished that those eyes would open again.
Finding demons was not the problem. To torture and kill them was less of a problem but nobody had an answer to their questions.
"Looks like the fire broke out in the back, probably in the kitchen area. Severide, go in and open the windows and exits!"
"Who is this?" The young policeman wanted to know, but Sergeant Platt shooed him back into the room.
"Honey !?" Dean murmured as he stopped in the middle of the sidewalk.
Cas saw that his friend was in danger and went after him.
Suddenly he heard a murmur close to him, and more voices joined in. Startled, he turned in all directions as he slowly heard someone clap his hands.
He was a creature that could not do much with feelings. Although he had learned a lot about it during his time as a human, he felt the need to learn more.
"Novak. Ten minutes!"
After some hesitation and with tears in his blue eyes, he took Dean's hand and dipped it in the water. Both hearts raced, the eye contact was not interrupted, and neither of them blinked. While Cas held his breath as Dean's fingers probed his testicles, the cop also got wet eyes, but a grateful smile crept onto his face as his lips sought Cas's.
"You can look at me ever so forcefully with your angel eyes."
Then she told him that he did not get the number and went on undeterred.
After Dean had undressed to the underpants, had slipped under the blanket and turned to the side, as the other slept deeply and tight anyway, a small smile sneaked on his face. Forgotten were the previous days, forgotten was the fear he had.
"Oh yeah. Casis the best secretary keeper there is. He has been here for weeks, and only yesterday he told me that he ... I mean ... I'm gone again, I have not heard anything and said nothing. Forget that I was here ... " As fast as she had come, she scurried off again and was annoyed with herself, because she still had talked too much.
With the words that Voight would make the little bird sing, she left the office.
Cas got it all and was glad he could not see, but felt the heat on his face continue to rise.
"You can not go back. You messed up your chance."
"You will be back the day after tomorrow. I will get you an appointment in urology with a colleague. Then your test results are there. Before you leave, please pee in the cup. "
But since he did not want to start crying again, Cas only told them that he would probably have to take the next few shifts off because he would not feel great health and he could not say more about it. That was accepted.
"Do you want to watch me, you tensioner? I can do it alone ", he grinned and winked at his colleague, who was already talking on the phone.
With the remote control, the young policeman started the film and tried to concentrate on it. Not easy, with the handsome man beside him.
"You're talking about my brother!"
With the words that it might be used, Cas put the intimate shower next to the soap.
"I would have wondered, too," Sam replied with a deep sigh. "Who is in charge of hell now? Crowley is dead. Asmodeus is dead. Lucifer is dead."
"Thanks for getting up for me," Dean replied, knowing that it could have been worse than just a two-week suspension.
The fireman drew in a sharp breath as he felt a hand under his nightgown, stroking his chest, taking turns taking his right and then the left nipple between his fingers, rubbing it lightly and teasing.
He explained that the access was filled in, but there was a control room some feet away. If he could make it this far, the crew would start digging from the other side. Adam had no idea if he could do that, but he promised to give it a try.
Maybe it was the fact that he had not visited him at the rehab because he had been sick in between and he had not seen his sweetheart for so long. Maybe it was the fact that he had come home a day earlier, had not seen Dean yet and that woman had suddenly confronted him with accomplished facts ...
After Will measured his blood pressure, which was a bit too low, he took blood from him.
Then it was Cas's turn.
As soon as he had wrapped these around his legs, he covered him again with the blanket. Damn, that was cold. Cas gasped.
"Cas ..." Gabriel muttered suddenly as he felt vibrations that he could not really classify. But he was sure something had happened.
"Shh ... do not worry about me, Dean," the black-haired man replied, squeezing the policeman's head against his chest and putting his other arm around his trembling body as well.
"It is said that the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body. Wanna fight?"
"Winchester. We should go. You are a real bunch of nerves. Let's see that we get you under the hood," Sergeant Platt intervened.
Supported by his IV pole, his policeman on one side, and his Chief and Otis on the other, he walked through the corridors, still a bit weak. The visitors came and went, and since Christmas was coming in a few weeks, Casey and Severide brought him an Advent calendar filled with beer.
The beeping on the monitor rose, and Dean chuckled.
Cas smiled at the warm feeling spreading through his body and just twitched occasionally when Dean drew circles over his kneecap with his thumb.
"The time was right," she answered calmly, looking at them one by one.
"Do not worry, just a little conversation among acquaintances," he smirked confidently, winking at the policeman and approaching the men, then asked quite friendly if there was a problem.
"No alcohol on duty," Herrmann replied, and after some persuasions, the chaplain accepted the ride.
Only then did he notice the clip on his index finger measuring the oxygen saturation. A glance at the monitor and he wondered if those values were good or bad.
"Apologize!"
That life was not fair, Cas knew that. And he also knew that his job was to save lives.
"I wish you both good luck. You deserve it, and you are such a beautiful couple."
"Do not worry, he's getting sedatives, remedies for the infection and to strengthen the circulation and organ functions, as well as many fluid infusions, he's going to sleep now."
With crossed arms and a grin, he watched his man trying to make something with flour and water.
"Nice to have you back," Dean whispered as he gently stroked through the black, soft hair.
The piece of cloth sailed to the ground, exposing him totally to the bandage that stuck to his stomach with the last remaining hose.
Castiel had survived. Maybe because no one had given up hope, maybe because he was a well-trained, young man. Maybe it was just luck.
Slowly he sat down next to him, put a hand on his shoulder, after which he heard a deep sigh.
Of course, all ware upset at the rescue mission of a different kind, but Chief Boden warned to rest.
"Empty ..." Dean repeated, made questioning hand gestures and considered because somewhere he had already read that once. "I am no angel and no demon. Why I'm here?"
"I'm here," Dean whispered, putting his hand on Cas's cheek and pressing a kiss on his head.
"Hey, I think we do not know each other yet. I'm Castiel. "
The satisfied hum, he accepted as an invitation to keep going, and he did not have to be asked twice to do so, he only briefly considered where to start.
Cas's soft giggles turned into a coughing fit.
"Have you heard? Oh, Cas. I miss you so much."
"I have something to tell you, and I'm sorry I've just realized it. That an angel and a human can not have a future - that's what everyone has always talked about. For thousands of years. And I never felt the need for physical closeness. And then I met you. Dean, you mean everything to me. I would die for you, but much more I want to live for you. Live with you. I love you, Dean." His hand gripped the hunter's lifeless hand and did not let it go.
Although it was rare, it happened that someone had allowed a joke.
When Chief Boden glanced at the young firefighter, he nodded approvingly and Cas had to admit that he did not even look so bad in his dress uniform.
During the meal, he ran his thumb slowly over Cas's lips and whispered in his ear that he was horny and wanted to disappear with him.
When he learned that it was the truck driver who caused the ambulance accident, Dean panicked. For one, because nobody told him about it, and another because he was worried about his friends, and most of all, he wanted to talk to that bastard. However, Trudy only pushed the quick-tempered man back into the chair, but she was persuaded to call the fire department for further information.
Two hours later, Sergeant Voight nodded to his colleague before calling Chief Boden.
"But he breathes on his own."
"Sarge ..."
"Did not you hear, no police. These bastards will kill him!" He exclaimed in horror as Antonio ripped the phone from his hand, grabbed his arm and was about to go up one floor.
"I think you should take care of me," he sighed, settling heavily on the bench before giving him a sexy look. "Can you take me home ... I'm ... I think I'm a tiny bit drunk."
"Yes, I know, a sexy nurse looks different. It's only for a short time."
'Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61 ... '
"Pull up your gown," he said, rolling his eyes as Cas told him he was naked because of the lack of power to put on his clothes.
Not only did Dean live, but also that he felt so comfortable in the angel's arms.
"I'm just happy and grateful to be a part of it," he muttered a bit embarrassed as his chief asked if everything was alright.
A mocking laugh was all he got in response before he reached into his jacket pocket, took out a picture and threw it on the floor in front of Dean.
His heart was beating faster now.
Cas got nothing of it at all, the last words he heard were from the anesthetist, who asked him to count backward from 10 ...
But even the archangel had no luck.
That went both Cas and Dean a little too fast. Surprised, the younger man sprang up, grabbed Cas's hand, who was staring at him desperately and with big blue eyes, and ran beside the sick bed as they brought his husband back to where it all began.
'Closed Society'
Castiel opened his eyes and blinked a few times to get a clear picture. A man was standing in his bedroom. Why the hell did he stand there, even though he should have been lying under the covers long ago?!
"You son of a bitch destroyed my life. You will pay for that!"
Once he had killed that death, and Dean vowed that, if he ever came out, would do it again. And then there was the fear that the others had given him up. What if they burned his body? Would he ...
Time and again, long fingers brushed his short hair, down to his neck, causing goose bumps after another. Sighing happily, Dean closed his eyes but forced himself not to fall asleep.
"You were not lying when you talked about a thorough check-up," Cas grumbled behind the curtain and put his shirt back on, but his pants off.
Castiel blushed a little. Although he was not ashamed of it and also wanted to make no secret that he was gay, now it was out, and he was relieved that his colleague received so well.
But, you do not look a gift horse in the mouth, right?
"So, but now under the shower, the time is pressing!" Herrmann called and shooed Cas through the lounge.
A few days later he had another drop. Two boys had fallen into a sewer while playing. Castiel was roped off headfirst. At first, everything went smoothly, and he managed to bring both of them to safety. Suddenly he could not breathe and fainted in no time.
"And the best thing is ... It's exactly 248 steps to Molly's. And that's exactly where we're going now."
"What do you think?" Cas asked with an excited smile.
If Sam had not been aware that it would not have made any sense anyway, he would have punched her in the face. He was so angry and had to breathe deeply several times to collect himself.
With a worried look, he followed Will out the door, where both sat down. Where was the warmth in his voice?
Then it went back and forth for a while, what and how much the debt should contain.
"You will never be without debt."
"Damn shit, Cas. You should go to the police," Dean joked and let out a short laugh.
"Platt will tear off your head, but you need a new lock."
"Dean!" The older man croaked hoarsely, hugging him as hard as he could.
Jay, Will's brother, and his colleague at the police, and his best man stood shivering with his hands buried in his jacket pockets on the steps.
Although he could not see anything but hear. The firefighter tried to remember what had happened. But as hard as he tried, and that was exhausting ... the last thing he knew was that he was so cold and that nurse wanted to give him a suppository.
"That sounds bad, but we discovered it early enough. The chance is not bad that we get that under control. We will monitor him and can only wait and hope that the meds take effect. Cas is a fighter. It will be alright."
"What now?" He asked with a wink and looked at Dean in the mirror.
Again he was trapped in the dream world. The world he loved and hated at the same time.
When he looked at the clock, he moaned in frustration, because he did not have much time left, had to go to work. Or instead to the desk work, because until everything had not clarified, he was not allowed to leave the house. In no time he got dressed and wondered if he should write a message to Cas. Only what? So he decided to scribble his phone number on a piece of paper, with a request to call him, called a taxi and drove off.
"I can not anymore," the young policeman whimpered after he had told him everything.
Everyone was in a good mood. Everything seemed to be fine ...
Suddenly he felt the weight on his shoulder getting heavier and heavier as Cas's head sank deeper and deeper.
"Medicines," she smiled as he looked questioningly at the young woman. "Do not you want to rest a bit? We will inform you when there is something new."
"Go home. You can not do anything for Castiel."
The deep whisper, the teasing circling of Dean's lips, parted to stroke his friend's forefinger with his tongue, and the fact that he looked so deep into his eyes, finally made him beg. The growl became a groan and the groan a gasp when he felt a demanding tongue less than ten seconds later, stroking those places between his legs so gently that it almost hurt — those places that sent electric charges through his body and made his head swim.
A few hours earlier ...
For him, it was constant chaos of emotions. Minute changes in heart rate or blood pressure on the monitor were interpreted as a glimmer of hope. The two were sure that Cas could hear them.
"It's all right. I overreacted. Okay?! Now eat your cold lasagna and then put your head right here," Cas said in the evening as he sat on the couch and patted his thighs.
"Thank you, Dean," the seated man smiled somewhat embarrassed as he felt gentle hands on his skin gently lathering him.
Castiel was taken by surprise, and frankly, he did not feel like it at all, and that's exactly what made itself felt.
Only with difficulty could Sergeant Voigt prevent him from running into the building.
Nodding, Will had to admit that this was a headway. The black-haired man tried to say something, but his lips did not move. Then he was left alone again, and only a few seconds later he fell into a troubled twilight state, but after almost 160 hours of sleep, one was probably well rested.
The cheers were great when the two men finally came in at the door, and all hugged each other in relief. Dean had thought for a long time, and a part of him said that it was something personal between the two, but on the other hand, he wanted everyone to be there, and so he had decided to ask him here in front of the assembled team the question of all questions.
While the entire crew in the big hall was busy setting up chairs, flowers, blankets ... Orlovsky came over with a cup of coffee in his hand and watched the hustle and bustle with a smile. Once again he was proud to be part of this wonderful guard and to consider these men and Dawson as his family.
Overpowered by the emotions, Cas fell around his neck and squeezed his friend as hard as he could and, lacking in words, showed him what he thought with a long and passionate kiss.
"I feel a bit strange. Probably due to the weather, comes and goes. ," Cas murmured, and Dean put his arm around his waist, kissing his cheek and whispering. "I'll take good care of you."
"Only at the limit one gets better," the senior physician said.
"No. Not really," the hunter mumbled, quickly tying his bathrobe.
"Damn son of a bitch!"
So far he had not been able to touch anything, not even a pebble. There was nothing there, and it was dark. Again and again, he wondered where he had landed.
"What? No, "Dean replied, and with a roll of his eyes, he explained that the two were old acquaintances and that he had only played scrabble with her.
The angel did not understand the excitement, but Dean saw red.
"But just tell it, if it does not take you too hard," his worried husband said and stroked Cas lovingly on the back. With a smile, he nodded as the young policeman pressed a kiss on his forehead.
"Sure Dean-o. Talk about that until you believe it yourself. I see it in your eyes, and I can feel it too. This yearning. This desire. This passion, if you both ... "
And of course, it would be nice if it did not cost anything.
Cas's right hand rested on his cheek, and a pleasant shudder passed through the younger man as he felt a breathy 'I love you' on his lips.
"Sure, what do you have there?" Herrmann asked, and as he held the first bouquet in his hand, he raised his eyebrows questioning.
"If you keep on stroking, I'll fall asleep," he muttered, his eyes closed as he felt soft fingers caressing his scalp. Smiling, Cas looked down, the remote in his other hand, with which he switched through the channels.
Dean stammered the next morning in front of his superior and Kim.
Dean was happy and kissed him again and again and again. Cas could no longer control his emotions and with a mixture of sobs and groans, he experienced an orgasm he had missed for so long, while the tears of relief ran
"So you think I'm the woman in our relationship?!" the black-haired teased and looked over his shoulder, shaking his head.
"I have never been to Alaska and have never shown any interest in it. But for some reason, I was in Alaska again and again, and it was so beautiful," he marveled as all eyes were fixed on his lips.
The way he said that ... So sincere and yet pleading, hopeful and anxious at the same time. His eyes were radiating infinite warmth and affection ...
"I'm fine." A relieved sigh and a shake of the head followed.
"Nevertheless, I have to advise you as Cas' doctor, that you have to treat him from time to time a little rest. Back off!"
When he turned into his street, he did not notice the black van, which had been standing in front of his apartment for two days. Nor did he see that two men got out.
"Oh come on, make an exception," Dean pleaded, but the nurse was afraid to get into the devil's kitchen.
It would have been easy to give up. But Adam was a fighter, and all of his colleagues outside stood around the radio and helped keep him awake.
"Already on the way," he replied and kissed Sam goodbye before he disappeared with a noise of his wings.
All I want for Christmas is you'
"What a huge shit," Otis said, expressing what everyone thought.
"Go. We will contact you if there are changes!"
"No. Dean! Wake up!"
The young policeman sensed that he was shaken and opened his eyes. Panting, he sat up and looked in the horrified, dilated eyes of his bed neighbor, who had put a hand reassuring on his shoulder.
"Well. Just sitting around and brooding will not get us anywhere."
"No!" Castiel screamed though he himself saw that it made no sense, but he had promised him.
Another deep moan as he felt Cas penetrate slowly, carefully and very tenderly. Invitingly, he raised his pelvis, pushed towards him and lost himself again in the overstimulation.
The nurse put a small bottle of water on the bedside table, the only problem was that he could not open it. The strength was missing. Somehow he managed to do it with the help of his teeth. Well, and since the water had to go out again, he needed a urine. Just where to put it? On the floor, so Dean accidentally tip over it?
The bodyguards were quickly tracked down when they wanted to smuggle the ambassador out of the hospital, and Voight and his team disarmed them as the ceiling toppled over them.
"I can not, without you," he whispered with a quiver in his voice, and the pain that squeezed his heart almost took his breath away.
"What about you two? Ten years is a damn long time. Is it ever going to work? Will Sammy and I still experience it?"
Nervously Gabriel went up and down. Again and again, he looked at the clock and hoped that nothing had gone wrong.
"I love you, and it’s fucking cold" Dean whispered and moved away a bit.
The two patrolmen had just come back from a mission and Dean, shaking his head, threw the report on the counter.
"I'm always there for you Castiel. That's us all. "
"Alright, kid. Castiel needs you now."
Cas remembered an oil rig and a house where he was trapped.
The dark-skinned man bravely climbed over the debris that lay in the way.
The conversation lasted a little longer than expected, and when Adam saw the open window, the badge, and Dean's gun, he could only moan annoyed.
"Chief. How is Dawson?"
"Stop!" Dean shouted because that was all more than scary.
With these words, he took the note that he got and when Dean had briefly flown over this, he rolled his eyes.
"Here at work, ma'am," he shouted in alarm, wincing at the sharp voice.
"Thank God. Oh fuck. Man Cas, please stay awake, I'll get you out of here!"
"He needs some rest now, you can come back later," the nurse said and squeezed his shoulder. Dean was so lost in thought that he did not realize she had come back.
"Sincerely, the Shady Pines Mortuary, who just wanted to dispose of everything," the black-haired smiled and was already clearing up.
"For a relationship, combating death is the biggest challenge," he said. "One is mentally and physically completely naked in front of the partner. Imagine that your husband lies at the bottom of a sea and has to fight his way back to the surface from deep depths, slowly and tenaciously. Surely it is where he is, dark, cold and lonely."
When Dean came after his shift, the horror was literally in his face. Without a word he ran to the nurse and insisted on having Will call out, who came a few minutes later. He frowned at Cas's bed and checked his pulse on his weak wrist. Way too fast. Immediately afterward, he put on a cuff to measure his blood pressure. Much too low.
Granted, Cas got a little queasy at the sight of the amount of blood.
"Ok, it's your turn."
Gabriel did not get any further because Dean had already gotten up after giving him an angry look and disappeared into his room, where he slammed the door shut behind him.
For half a year, the two lovebirds were married and still so in love that it was often too much for the others.
As he sat down to his husband on the bed, he shook his head.
"What about food?"
After ten minutes, the pizza dough was rolled out, and Dean asked him for the sauce. With a frown, he asked what Cas was looking for when he opened all the drawers and boxes.
"Dean ..."
And shortly he had the idea to do this right in the shower, but at the last moment, he could rely on his self-control. To see the trembling body in front of him, which was just as hard to hold on to, and the certainty that it was he who had it in his hands how this should end up for Dean made him growl happily.
The next shift was hard for Cas, but he wanted to work, at least not to think about his life for a few hours. Inwardly, he fought with himself, whether he should say it at all, but that was Cas missing was the poker face. He was a person where you could read the emotions on his face.
Dean was sure he would not have survived had he lost his love.
The birdie had not talked after one hour of intensive questioning.
As Cas lay on Dean's bed, he wished he could fall asleep, not always thinking of him. And above all, not having to think about Dean getting his hunter's funeral in a few hours. It had taken a long time for him to realize how much this human meant to him. Dean had always had to explain to him the personal space, and at some point, the angel had thought that Dean did not want to come too close to him and had given up. Had he known that it had only been self-protection of the dark blond not to have to admit his own feelings.
Adam now knew why he drove this vehicle, and his eyes shone because secretly he always wanted to do something like that. He was in constant contact with the patrol officers and taking advantage of the first opportunity, and without thinking much about it, he rammed the black van. Over and over again.
With small steps, the four firefighters examined the stability of the roof.
"We'll pull you back up, stay calm," Cruz shouted, but Mouch noticed that Castiel was quieter than calm and urged the others to hurry.
Dean took Cas's hands in his and looked at him scrutinizingly.
Dean took a moment to look at Cas. His eyes were glassy, he kept chuckling, and the hair was disarranged even more than he remembered. The slightly flushed cheeks matched perfectly with the red lips, which he steadily moistened, and Dean could not help but stare at the reprobate tongue tip that kept flashing between his lips. Damn, the guy was handsome. But apparently, it was a bit conspicuous because the policeman noticed the look that Severide and Casey exchanged and lowered his eyes slightly flushed.
Everything happened within a blink of an eye. With difficulty, the two others could hold Otis back, who was screaming to help his friend. But there was nothing left except a hole, fire, and smoke. The bloodcurdling screams startled the rest of the crew on the ground.
The crackle in the air was literally felt, as both held their breath for a moment to inhale the sweet air of the other.
"Open. Immediately!"
Full of desperation and with tears in his eyes, he pressed his lips to Cas's.
On the one hand, he thought that was a pity because he would have liked to have someone to cuddle again, but on the other hand, he wanted to get to know Dean.
"Sore muscles? Train on it! "The physiotherapist smirked.
He did not know it himself and felt tears burning in his eyes. Since when was he such a sensitive person? Castiel had back pain and just wanted to sleep, but he also did not want to see Dean so sad. But before anything could happen, an emergency, which came in between released the two from the tense situation.
"I stay with my husband! You can not just kick me out!" He shouted in a shaky voice as Cas's body was seized by the resuscitation device and sank back limply. The beeping became more regular before it stumbled again.
Cas nodded and sighed. The last days and weeks had plunged the sensitive firefighter into a chaos of emotions. For one, he had found the dream job and could do what he wanted to do as a little boy.
It was a horrified and bloodcurdling scream and wide-eyed, Dean had to stand by and watch Castiel sink to the ground. As if of course he jumped up and wanted to go to him before he felt a punch in his stomach, which forced him to his knees.
"Nice to have you there," Dean smiled, stepping aside so he could warm himself up.
The first Christmas together. Of course, there had to be a tree. Hand in hand, they strolled through the Christmas market, bought small Christmas tree balls here and candles there and finally stood in front of the few trees that were left. The selection was not big anymore, had not Cas been in the hospital so long; they would not be that late. But it was Dean's need to do it together.
Sighing happily, Cas rested his head on his shoulder and closed his eyes for a moment as he felt strong hands hugging him affectionately.
Not only did Dean's legs tremble and eventually they both stumbled and lay laughing on the cold tiles in the bathroom.
With each passing day, the pain became more bearable, but he was afraid of the day he first saw himself. Besides, there was the fear that it would not be as it was. An important component was missing. Although he did not have to worry about an unfulfilled desire to have a baby,... How would it be if both had sex again?
"September 18th," he replied, wondering if there was anything special, but then shrugged and looked at his brother questioningly.
"Do you hear that?"
"Should I know something?" Chief Boden asked when he saw Dean and Kim coming, and after some whispering, the two men disappeared.
"Maybe the other tie?" He sighed as he looked at himself in the mirror and was about to open it again.
After some back and forth, the young firefighter was beaten because such a thing was not in the house.
Cas had no idea how many hours, days or even weeks had passed. He woke again when he heard a familiar sound.
Mutually, they swallowed the sweet sounds and took only air, if necessary. Everything was perfect. Even their body size. Tenderly, Dean nibbled on Cas's lower lip, opened his eyes to see the other man's flushed face, his ruffled hair and his gleaming eyes. He knew he looked the same.
That long, deep hum of his name telling him to pick up speed. Meanwhile, Cas had him so far that he almost begged for it.
Expectantly, his eyes followed Dean, who had made himself comfortable on his thighs and stroked his chest again. The feeling of soft hair under his fingers made him hot, and yet he let his gaze wander, following every touch with his eyes.
"You are never careless, Cas. Does that happen more often?"
"Yes, sir."
Fortunately, it only hit the ambassador who was hospitalized for a kidney transplant. One could only determine his death, buried under the rubble.
How many times had he been dealing with the ransom and told the victims exactly what Antonio told him? But it was a bit different when you were in this situation yourself.
"You're so damn hot, Cas ... I want to ... ahh ... want to make you scream, suck on your skin until there's a bruise and everyone sees ... oh fuck! You are mine."
As Sylvie stared at the white ceiling of the hospital room, she knew that the entire crew of the guard 51 sat in the waiting room. Because it has always been like this. All held together in difficult times. Her thoughts darted to Gabriela. No one had ever told her what was going on.
"Is Burgess there?"
"You should have told him," he suddenly heard a whisper.
Shortly after that, he felt something soft, wet, which touched his left ass cheek, followed by three kisses.
Dean nodded with a heavy heart because all he wanted was that Cas did not have to suffer.
Only now did Antonio realize that the lock on Dean's Spindt was missing.
"Lieutenant!"
"Wanna watch a movie?"
He really kissed it. With a smile, he took off his shoes and tiptoed to the dark brown door, which was wide open. The wet noise had stopped, and he watched Dean step out of the shower, dry himself and tie the yellow towel loosely around his hips.
Satisfied and with a big grin, he patted his fiance's ass and placed a kiss left and right, as it slipped in.
Dean became aware that it was serious business when he sat down at his computer and did his research. Half an hour later, he had so much information in his head that he grabbed a bottle of whiskey because he was afraid of losing his mind.
"First of all, my men get an overview. Casey, Severide, split up your teams!"
"Shall I accompany you tomorrow?"
In a few words, the kidnapper told him that he now knew what was most important to him after watching them the night before and that he would take that from him. Thank God he did not elaborate because that was not really for Dawson's ears. The demands were clear. Come alone and unarmed — no police. But what was missing were the clues.
After half an hour Castiel fell asleep, and Dean watched him with a dreamy smile. He looked relaxed and satisfied. After turning off the TV, he quietly lay down and fell asleep a short time later.
Half an hour later, the two were back at the station.
It took a long time, the strength of four men was necessary to unravel the door, and it took another long time until she finally lay on the backboard and knew that it was almost done.
"Honor Guard, Attention!"
Will rolled his stool closer, and his eyes remained fixed on Cas' testicle. After putting on a glove, he fiddled there for some time.
He got almost everything the people around him talked about, what they did to him. He had never used drugs before, but that's how he felt. As through a veil. Like on a trip. Partly beautiful, partly pure horror.
"Patient, male. Suspicion of ..."
Cas heard the door lock and sighed in relief. The whole situation was so uncomfortable for him that he could not look Dean in the eye and so he had been entrenched in the bathroom for a quarter of an hour after he had taken on the problem and with his hand. This hand, which had already done this for two years.
"Halstead. What's going on? "He asked in a panic.
"It's okay. You look good," Burgess laughed and tied the blue-striped tie back on.
Suddenly he felt a pull in the groin and put as naturally a hand on his testicles. It was Dean who dealt with his balls more often, so it was not until now that he realized what he meant a few days earlier.
The next problem was that the battery of the radio was slowly failing.
"Toilet," Cas stammered.
It was the early afternoon of the next day, and Cas was alone. Only the TV was on, any telenovela he could hardly follow, and it was not so exciting that he could explain his sudden shortness of breath. Out of nowhere he suddenly felt terrible, so bad that he grabbed the emesis basin in panic and vomited.
"What ?!" He asked perplexed and looked at him uncertainly, because the blood in his brain, which was necessary for thinking, had long ago rushed down.
"It's alright. I'll be back in a few hours," he murmured, and the nurse turned to Castiel, laughing.
"Shit, look at you," the young policeman breathed. "You look so hot!"
"And you're not going out alone anymore. Not with the crosshairs on your back."
"Get out of here!" The doctor shouted, looking directly at Dean. "Let us do our job."
"I'm sorry," it came timidly, and as Cas turned and sank in the arms that caught him safely, he sobbed and could hardly calm down anymore.
Herrmann hung this sign on the outside door of the Molly's before he turned and closed the door behind him. This case had united the two uniformed families even closer, and everyone looked at each other with helpless faces.
Kim hugged him and noticed with some reproach that an update was long overdue when Dean opened the door to Molly's.
At some point, it seemed like hours, he had passed the passage and straightened up with his last strength. What he saw then was disturbing. Everything was burning. It was hopeless.
"Winchester! Did not you still block it?" Sergeant Voight called after him, causing him to turn around.
"Is he feeling worse?" The policeman asked uncertainly.
When he raised his head and had the same hallucinations, the adrenaline was back in no time and screaming, he made himself noticeable.
Meanwhile, the gloves were torn, and the hem was missing but never would he dispose of or give away.
"No, it does not. The last thing Castiel needs now is for you to fold up. How many hours have you slept in the last days?"
"Do not worry, I'm familiar with it, I've often done that to my nephew."
Your hold is my power.
"That he was drinking with Severide and his battery was empty, so they went home with the two girls. He fell asleep on the couch while Severide was having a good time. Who knows what else he did in the two weeks ...?!"
"Thanks, Sarge," the policeman replied and sat down next to him at the bar for a moment, looking out of the corner of his eye at his fiancé, who was laughing and joking with his colleagues and smiled.
If he had a better grip on writing his own script in the beginning, it suddenly became more and more the case that these dreams controlled him. Maybe it was the medication, maybe it was because he did not know if he was awake or asleep.
Without the black hair, which gave a sharp contrast, Cas would hardly have been seen under the white sheets. He was so pale. His eyes were closed, his breathing was regular. Thank God. Cas looked so fragile, so vulnerable and somehow ... afraid.
He put the two cups of coffee on the bedside table and sat down on the bed. Cas slid up, suddenly clapped his hands over his face and began to sob. Dean did not know how to react at first, just looked at him wide-eyed.
Had someone cursed the angels and taken away their power? Did fate want it that way?
"Seriously?" Sam asked shaking his head but only received a shrug from his brother.
For three weeks Castiel was but was only briefly called Cas by all, on guard 51. Everything was still new, exciting. Every job was different, especially. He admired the team that was like a family, not just on duty. He had never experienced this trust and the commitment that each one had to the other, and it was a wonderful feeling.
Then the coffin, adorned with countless flowers, was carried out by his colleagues and lifted onto the police truck. Numerous units of the police, as well as the entire crew of the police house 21, the fire house 51 and some employees of the Chicago med. proved him the last honor. For him, the siren sounded the last time.
In the waiting room, Dean met not only the entire crew of the guard 51 but also his husband. First, he exchanged a look with Kelly, who looked at him blankly and then he sat next to his husband in the free chair because Herrmann had got up, knowing that the two had something to clarify because Cas had behaved so weird at the firehouse.
Tears of despair burned in Dean's eyes. If it hit him, alright. But not his friends, that was not fair.
"I think it's time for you to come out of your shell. I love you. With one or two balls," he laughed, but Cas did not feel like laughing.
"Yes, I ... I'm Dean ..."
Somewhat stormy but very careful, he pushed the young firefighter against the wall and covered his face with kisses and delicate bites. Within seconds, a heat spread in Cas and this tingling sensation in his body hurt in his stomach on the one hand, but on the other, it was one of the most awesome feelings he did not want to end.
Tears came to Cas's eyes as he imagined he might never see these people again, that he liked so much. Especially now that he had found his great love ...
He then escorted him to the door of the operating room, holding his hand and reluctantly releasing it as his husband was pushed through the door into the sterile room. Then Dean sat down in the waiting room, made in between a visit to the canteen.
But what bothered him was the sleep disturbances. The whole events of the last weeks came again. He dreamed of people who kept him from doing something or wanted him to do something bad.
"Stop complaining!" Matt shouted.
"You gave us all a real scare."
"But I remember one thing, and I have to tell you that before either of us dies again," he grinned, clutching the angel's face with both hands.
The heartbeat was a bit high, and he felt that Cas's face had darkened slightly. Carefully he sat down on the bed, took his hand and stroked the other over his cheek, while he spoke softly and quietly with him. The young policeman's heart broke as he saw a tear slowly making its way down the pale cheek.
Will put a hand on his shoulder and held him back, but Dean wanted to be only with his husband.
Dean was not aware of any guilt, just shrugged and just wanted the time to pass as quickly as possible.
"Are you alright?" He asked worriedly when it seemed that things were not moving, and Dean adjusted and tried to relax.
It was so loud for Cas, and he wondered why this doctor was shouting at him, but that just felt like it.
Some days passed.
Smiling, he sat down next to him on the bed, took his hand and looked around.
"Dean ... Dean!"
"You, as his maid of honor, should keep to me," Dean grumbled, leaning forward and kissing her on the cheek before his husband sat down again.
"Promise me you are careful. Sam. I want you back in one piece."
In no time the crew of the Intelligence Unit retreated, and it took less than five minutes to get all focused and 100% ready.
Both noses pressed against each other's neck, as they lazily rode out their orgasms and slowly came back to normal breathing.
"Dude, when you're on your feet again, you'll get the receipt for that. Because I do not want to beat up a helpless man in bed!"
"I think we need to ask questions," the black-haired replied with a shrug.
With a wink, she took her bottle and joined the others.
"Tell me something beautiful," the black-haired whispered. He was so cold, but it was a warm feeling to have his friend so close.
"Where is the ring?" Cas joked with a smile on his lips as Dean still held his hands.
"How are you? And more important, how is Cas? I tried to reach him yesterday, but he pushed me away," Matt said, sitting down at the table with the others.
"Do we have a frightened chicken here?" Dawson laughed and patted his shoulder before she headed for the ambulance and the others split into the other two vehicles.
The black-haired man could not decide where to look first — Dean's arms, tense enough to reveal every single muscle and tendon, or their pelvis, which had united and pulsed in unison, or into his face where the glittering drops of water reflected.
When the two men were alone again, and Cas wondered why he was still lying on his side with bared buttocks, he heard a familiar growl behind his back.
Two doors were locked, only at the third, he was lucky. As hard as he tried, this door creaked, and Dean closed his eyes, groaning in annoyance. That was not to be missed. And so it was, and the surprise visit was no longer one. First, he felt a sharp punch on the back of his head and then he found himself on the ground again on his hands and knees.
Dean had no idea how many low blows he could take without finally collapsing as he reached out his trembling hand to clasp his husband.
"Winchester!"
A few minutes later, the young policeman breathlessly gasped as he felt demanding hands on his pants and lips that drove him out of his mind as his eyelids fluttered from open to closed. There was a mass of heat and pressure in his lower body that made him moan helplessly.
Everything in his body screamed to finally be able to touch those lips, but Cas took extra time to look at his husband, after all, he had plenty of time to catch up and countless seconds passed before he leaned down to him.
The angel could not figure out where the water was coming from, that was dripping from his eyes again, but he bridged the gap again and murmured at his lips how much he felt the same.
The next day, Burgess received the message that Boden's son had been born, and during lunch, she and Dean set out to visit the two, armed with a teddy bear as a gift.
A few days later, all the firefighters of the guard 51 were in the lounge. While some watched TV or ate something, Cas played with Herrmann and Mouch Ludo.
Cas wondered how he was doing because his friend was so sorry for him because he knew that the dark blond was torturing himself with objections, although he could not help it.
Grimacing, he moved his mouth again and again, and with his tongue, he managed after a long time to inhale a little more oxygen. Relieved, the black-haired sighed. But that relieved sigh changed to horrified the moment the heavy door creaked, and an amused voice was heard.
Dean picked up the remote and stopped at the movie 'Terminator'. Sighing, the young firefighter closed his eyes, based on the different film taste.
Dean's mouth clung to his chest and licked a line in the middle before going over to his left nipple. He whirled his tongue around until the nipple hardened and tingled, down to the tips of his toes. With a gentle bite, he sucked hard and elicited a deep groan from the black-haired.
He bit his lip to stifle a giggle and was a little proud that he was still managing it. Carefully he slipped in and out and was surprised and relieved at the same time that it worked so smoothly in the truest sense of the word.
Exhausted, Sam sank onto the couch, leaning his head against the backrest and closing his eyes.
After the shift, he wanted to go home to bed, but Dean called to meet him for lunch.
"Dean, I have to talk to you."
We can replace the function of failed kidneys with transient dialysis. "
"Do you have the rings?"
"So close ..."
"Ruzek? Can you hear me?"
"Are you tired, honey?"
When Hank Voight saw the young policeman sitting in a corner away from the goings-on, he remembered that he and countless police officers had previously struggled with these things. The task of his unit was to uncover these cases and, even if it was still a little slow, he was sure that he could solve this case as well.
The hope and confidence were back, and after a long shower he just allowed himself and a long letter from his colleagues, he went to the hospital.
In between, he had talks with the operating doctor and the anesthesiologist, who was responsible for the anesthesia. And Dean was always by his side. Cas was infinitely grateful for this support. The doctors asked him if he was not nervous because of the big surgery. Before the fireman could answer, Dean took over.
He did not feel like drinking beer, but Cas was still happy about it as a little kid. But when the senior doctor told him that biopsy showed no abnormalities, Dean came over with a bottle of champagne and Cas approved a cup.
Cas nodded and was grateful that Dean made him feel worth more.
"Is not mine."
Back at the firehouse, his lieutenant pulled him aside.
"Wow, Cas. No, no, look at me. Do not get flabby now. You want to hear something beautiful?" With a jerk, he turned to him and took his face in both hands.
Twice they had to reanimate Castiel. Even though Dean was always reassured that his husband had the heart of a fighter, the dark blond again lost a piece of his hope and that hurt so damn hard.
"Not only for that. You should have told him. "
"The first step, sober up. You still have a wedding today. "
"You had something with her," Kim smirked as the bartender left after putting their drinks down.
Dean tried to keep his eyes open, but he was so tired.
"Dean!"
That was a good question to which none of the three had an answer.
With a kiss and a little plush angel as a present, Dean greeted his wounded boyfriend at the hospital. When Cas glared at him with his sky blue eyes, the policeman fell in love again. Relieved to have survived everything, he squeezed him, causing the black-haired to cry out.
When the engine started, he realized that he had been kidnapped, and as much as Castiel tried, he could not guess where the ride was going. Only one thing he knew for sure. He would not come out alive if no one found him, for he had seen their faces.
"Kid, everyone you have contact with could be in danger! Or did you learn nothing from it?!"
"Should not we pack away Dean before he starts to stink?"
"I'm your doctor, I'm not looking at anything, and I've seen it before ..."
"I remember just sitting and watching the beautiful landscape for hours. It was freezing cold, but I did not care. As it turned out, I was cooled down with ice because I had a very strong fever."
The entire time their mouths did not separate. They breathed the same air, swallowing their sounds and trying to be as quiet as possible. Hungry, Dean's gaze wandered to his own cock, which his husband pampered with skillful grips before his head landed heavily on his shoulders.
"Nice that you could come," Sam laughed, offering her a chair.
Never had he come so hard. Relief and happiness flowed through him and for a moment he cursed himself to be such a sissy, for he already had too many tears in his eyes that rolled over his face. But that's exactly what Dean loved about his sensitive husband.
"Merry Christmas, friends." Sergeant Voigt raised the glass, and everyone followed.
He wanted nothing more than that anyone would wake him up. But he did not dream. It was the bitter reality. Cas felt that time was at a standstill and his body shook more, with every passing minute. Suddenly the nurse called his name, but the young firefighter sat quietly. He was paralyzed and just wanted to get away ... far away.
"You also have a battleship injury," he smirked as he felt the burn scar on his soft lips and squeezed a kiss on it.
"Please hold on. Help is on the way, certainly."
To get him out of the gloomy thoughts, Jay told him about the work and managed to make him laugh a couple of times.
After that, he stayed. Five minutes, ten minutes. Again and again, his gaze went to the bathroom door, but there was no sound except the swoosh of the water.
like a waterfall.
The orgasm exploded in his brain like a huge firework. He panted, gasping, his whole body burning, the blood rushing audibly through his veins.
The air was getting tighter, the eyes heavier, it was hopeless, and both had come to terms with the fate. The fire was crackling around, and both men were caught on the stairs. Hugging tightly and pressing their cheeks together, they crouched on the steps. On the one hand it was frightening, but on the other hand, it had something reassuring.
"We fell," Castiel replied, pointing upwards. Since he was too weak to flee anyway, the fireman decided to forego the handcuffs and crawled on to his friend. Adam's mouth was covered in blood, and he also coughed up blood. Cas did not have to be a physician to know that Adam had internal bleeding.
"Your wish is my command, my angel," he whispered back, leaning down and kissing him on the lips. With shampoo, he did not have anything else, he started to get ready, and Cas had to stop his work, because this incredible sight, as Dean's finger gradually disappeared slowly in his hole, almost brought the older man out of his mind.
In the lounge of the guard 51, he then met the others of the crew before he responded to the alarm again a little scared.
He loved this male scent, rubbing his nose along Cas's neck, down to his hair, taking a deep breath as the fingers of their hands joined together.
"Good Morning Sunshine."
Anyway, that was in such a place called 'Empty'. That's exactly what happened to him. Darkness. Nothing.
One last time he retook a deep breath, the grip on the bag in his right hand became stronger and with a ducked head to protect himself from the rain, he set one foot in front of the other.
"Okay, that looks bad. Hang on; we'll get you out," Kelly tried to calm the blond woman, who still held tight to the steering wheel and sobbed slightly.
"You can go in now, Mr. Novak," the nursing assistant smiled and pointed to the door.
"You do not look that way," he joked and looked questioningly at Matt, who answered in a slightly shaky voice.
"Nothing. Dean is not in heaven," the smaller replied with a shrug.
He had the feeling that those tubes in Cas had doubled and when he slowly let his eyes wander, it was not just the annoying sound of many monitors, but also the smell of industrial disinfectant that made the small room uncomfortable.
"You ..." Cas shouted angrily and walked purposefully towards her, but as soon as he reached the circle, he was stopped by an invisible force.
"Sarge! We are out of the line of fire. These bastards have what they want. Let us help!"
"Forgetting is better than never having got it," he replied cheekily, taking a friendly punch in the side. He was happy to be back, without fear.
Breathing hard and with his hands tied behind his back, he mumbled something that nobody could understand. The shirt was torn and the pants dirty. Those bastards even took his shoes and socks. It was just terrible to see that and tears were swimming in Dean's eyes. But he did not have to bear this picture too long, because when the camera swiveled, he found himself confronted with a pig mask.
Gently but quickly, he relaxed his hand, and Castiel lay on his back again.
When he returned to the room with the two cups, he had to laugh when he witnessed the other man slowly wake up. The black hair stood in all directions, he yawned, and the blue eyes opened with a blink.
"Chief!"
"Um ... yes," replied the dark blonde and scratched his neck a little embarrassed.
Moments later, his head almost burst as Halstead told him about infectious agents in the blood, toxins in the body, blood clots, oxygen deficiency of organs, and tissue damage.
On it was a young woman. Dean suspected a Mexican, like the man standing in front of him.
So he decided to bury those feelings in the back of his head and the deepest place of his heart. His heart ached, but it was okay. You could count on one hand how many times fate had meant well to him.
What he saw when he finally had his blindfold removed was hard to believe. Shaking his head and still amazed, he noticed that all his belongings were carefully distributed as he walked through each of the rooms with Dean.
"Water comes in two minutes. See that you get your asses out!"
As he stood with his back to the door, he did not realize that Antonio was approaching him and almost dropped the phone in shock when he spoke to him.
The strong pains robbed him of the air to breathe, which was very barely anyway and lying on his back, he closed his eyes.
With his eyes closed, the younger man enjoyed feeling those rough but incredibly tender hands brushing his sides and kneading and massaging his ass after all the rains of the arts, making them loose and ready. Within a short time, he was horny again.
"I'm sorry," Cas mumbled into his ear but did not back away a millimeter. On the contrary, he moved even closer and let Dean feel how aroused he was. He could not do anything against it. His husband smelled so good. After fresh clothes and Dean. The best smell there was.
