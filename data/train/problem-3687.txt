“Will you just let me say it?” Dean huffs out a ragged laugh. “C'mon, I'm dead. I get at least one wish, don't I?”
He suspects that's something he should spend a little more time thinking about, but he has other things on his mind.
“You okay?”
Cas looked up at Dean, surprised at the out-of-the-blue question. Sam had taken Kevin to his private library, full of fiction and nerdy stuff, to try and find him
Then, immediately after Dean moved aside, he seized the opportunity and took the chair the peasant had just vacated from the wall to place it in front of his desk again. Without looking back at Dean he started arranging quill and ink, parchment, took his notes from the nearby bookshelf.
“Think we can swing that?”
Castiel fell silent at that. He didn’t feel like a very capable healer at that moment. A rookie mistake had prolonged his patient´s suffering, and at the same time rendered him helpless to help him otherwise through magic. He looked up to see Dean looking at him, and the hunter made a small smile.
him out.
“Okay, man. Thanks”, Dean smiled at him, green eyes grateful.
, he distantly thought.
That… he approached to his forehead?
“There it is”, Sam said pointing up with his spatula before using it to move the eggs around the skillet, “I think it´s not just that he cares and he would sacrifice for us, which he would. I think it… has something to do with being an angel”
With a towel at his hips, he passed a hand over his mirror to wipe the steam away. He grimaced while tilting his head, seeing how some bruises were already appearing on his neck, shoulders and jaw. Those damn tentacles… But he smiled to himself. He had seen enough hentai to know that a couple of neck bruises were the best possible scenario he could have gotten out with.
, he thought, remembering his ankle, and the wolves, and that time was precious, and that so much could happen in a second in a fight…
Some worldbuilding in this chapter. This is the first universe I create and I am honestly very very happy how it turned out. Again I must mention the influence of The Way To a Man´s Heart is Through Chlamydia in this chapter, since it really made an impression on me: Naomi being the mother, Samandriel being the youngest, everything being really strict, and the scene with all the siblings lined up from oldest to youngest... In that fanfic, they are a rich, religious family. I changed some of the brothers, of course changed their destinies (some are gone lol) but I think all of that is what started to create the nobility in my head ^^
“Now, now, Kevin. You had been such a
His little brother shook his head.
He had frozen for a second, surprised, their eyes locking upon each other, his hand still on the man ́s arm; until he had spoken.
“By that, you mean the children. Dead”, he stated with an uneasy voice.
As he got to the T-shaped intersection where the portal had opened, he stopped in his tracks… as he saw the sigil on the wall trashed.
Dean frowned a bit then, looking at Cas. He looked back at the footprint, and then up at the sky, where the sun was still shining bright.
“I´m sorry”, Cas muttered, eyes low.
“Oh, for
, he thought,
Yeah. Right.
“Go on lad, I don’t have all day”
“Jess is here too?”, her mother asked, marveled.
The angel was half-incorporated on his elbow, looking at the thing in horror; still griping his hand to his chest. He was alive, conscious, and out of the fucking fire cage. They had that much at least.
The healer looked at his brother, slightly surprised. Getting Corrupted, unless it happened in the most ruthless battlefield, was considered a weakness among the nobility. It meant lack of discipline and character, lousy control of one´s magic; and suggesting someone could have gotten even a bit of Corruption was considered insulting. Supposedly, no one ever passed through that, though he as a healer knew it wasn´t true. That was one of the reasons why studying the disease was so difficult- possible patients denied having ever had it, so the information was very scarce. But then again, Gabriel had always disdained etiquette and whatever the nobility considered important.
“No!!! No, no, no, no, NO!!!!”, Dean screamed.
“Bitch”
Since now he had a good excuse, he fully intended to enjoy it.
Crowley rose a hand and stopped him in mid-charge. A firm push of the demon´s hand against the air sent him flying against a wall, leaving him sprawling in the ground after the hit.
The hunter. The forest.
“I… you seemed in trouble”, Cas protested weakly.
"Well, it kinda was", grumbled Dean scowling.
“Oh, no; please, no; let’s just, go back already”, Cas said, closing his eyes for a second in relief.
“Hi, Dean”, she chuckled.
“And how good are you with this? Be honest, I need to know”
His heart was hitting so hard onto his chest that it hurt. He was glad that Cas was by his side and he could look forward without seeing him.
Cas´s eyes got a bit wide at the sight, and he took the bottle with careful movements, as if he was being handed the Holy Grail. Dean would have burst out laughing it that hadn´t ruined everything.
“Leave that right there, you
Castiel smiled so widely at that. Dean´s eyes just shifted between the angel´s and his mother´s smiles, drinking eagerly from each image, his chest filled with light, a moronic smile on his own lips.
“Hey Kev”, he heard as Dean entered his field of vision.
It was a white flag, if Dean had ever seen one. He looked away, trying not to squirm uncomfortably.
He saw Sam wince on his peripheral vision.
“Dean, wait”, Cas ordered as he rose too, “You can ́t help anyone like this. Your brother, wherever he is, is probably better than you are right now. He ́d be the one helping you”
“That was awesome, Cas. And it took real guts to come back like that. However”, he pointed very severely at him, his voice suddenly a growl, “I
”, Gabriel said, raising his eyebrows on a
Then he turned back to the angel, pointing an accusatory finger at him.
“Ugh. My freaking mouth… Honestly man, didn´t wanna make you uncomfortable, it was just a joke”
“I´d advice to put the repellent on as we get on the field, since its effect doesn´t last long”, Cas added, “We will have to apply it several times over the day”
Dean had adopted a light jog that he had kept up
Suddenly, in the farthest distance, he heard… thunder? Dean blinked and searched the sky. The was not one thundercloud in sight… But had the clouds moved? He´d swear they didn’t look like that a moment ago…
And there he was, by the road. He could have done this anywhere, he supposed… but he had just drove and drove until the knot of nerves on his guts seemed to ease. Though it had come back with a vengeance as he had left the car, so all the
, he thought; pinned on the floor he was going to be able to do very little. He covered his face with his arms, protecting himself from some hits, then suddenly ducked Dean on the chin. They got arms on each other, grasping on their clothing, tussling on the floor.
. For protection, the most basic of things. This was just… extra ornamentation on a daily object, completely unnecessary. He knew that if someone melted that down, they could maybe make at least two silver-coated throwing knives.
now. First, his mind hadn´t been on doctor mode. Second, there had been so much more skin unveiled. Like,
Special thanks to:
And there they were, saying nothing like the two idiots they were.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah. I wanted so bad for them to go to the forest- but I had NOT ANTICIPATED AT ALL how INCREDIBLY FUN it would be to write this!!! I am so happy, folks. My longest chapter ever written, and *so worth it*. I think this is the coolest chapter I have ever written- and Im very proud of chapters 1 and 2 of Dreams of Perdition, but *dang* this had my heart thumping on my chest- and I already knew what was gonna happen! Writing to The Witcher soundtrack I guess helps xD
He wakes to fingers against his bicep. Warm fingers. His breath catches in his throat. Will he die again if he doesn't breathe in Heaven? He doesn't need to. It's muscle memory. Staring at the wall, Dean doesn't dare to move, lest the fingers slide free. When they remain after one breath, two, he risks a slight roll of his shoulder.
to see you, but—”
Just for a little while, then. Jimmy will be helpful in relearning how to move with skin and bone restraints. He can see the Holy mission Castiel has been charged with and know that he is part of it. He has prayed for this, to see, to know, and Castiel has the ability to grant him that, if nothing else.
, a voice that cuts through the worst of the grime coating Hell around them, and it echoes through Castiel’s grace.
“Like what?” Cas asks.
Dean Winchester looks at him with eyes that see too much and too little, with a soul that burns brighter than the whole of the garrison. He is calming, somehow, a soul Castiel knows more intimately than even Jimmy’s, trapped in the same vessel as himself. Castiel’s grace longs to reach out and touch Dean’s soul again just to feel the surety and promise it affords, but he holds himself back.
, one wing curling around to shield Dean’s eyes from the brightness of it.
He leaves with the promise to return for dinner and takes the long way home, looping in and around of the fields and trees, the flowering brush and the dusty road.
Was his vessel devout and pleased by the offering to be part of something bigger? Or had Uriel promised something he would never deliver?
Castiel has no answer for this. His allegiance is to Heaven and the Host’s missions, not to the vessel he is borrowing, and not to Jimmy’s family. Jimmy said yes, and that was all the consent Castiel needed. Still, it feels wrong, somehow, to ignore them, and Jimmy’s pain is beginning to soak into Castiel’s interactions with the others in his garrison.
“You don’t know how I mean it,” he says instead, because–-
None of it changes anything.
Specifically, he goes to see his mother, but he knows his father will also be there. It's strange how he almost wishes he wasn't. He's glad to know Mom's happy, of course, but…it burns a bit. It smolders still in his chest, at what things could have been. Might have been.
He doesn't think Heaven would trick him, but still.
There’s a rite for angels who have lost their way. There’s a fix for those charged with Heaven’s mission who can no longer see the path. Castiel is nothing, and then he’s remade, and the storm that rages in the clouds mirrors the same storm curdling through his grace. He’s felt and wanted and needed, and they burn all of it out of him.
“Sammy,” he finally chokes out.
“I never needed it.”
Castiel’s grace flickers to him, though his fury is still palpable.
Dean closes his eyes, counts his fingers tapping out a nervous rhythm against the mattress. Then he opens them again. He's still staring at the wood panels of the cabin walls. “I get it. I didn't give you anything to hold onto.”
Castiel has no corporeal form in Hell as he slashes through the demons and gore, but he still feels the licks of flame against his grace, shocks of
“To reunions,” she echoes, and something in her eyes shines.
“Can you just…can you just come down here? Or…up here, whichever. I need you.”
Castiel finds himself on a bench next to Dean Winchester, his hands strung together in his lap.
He hasn't gone to see his parents yet.
Dean huffs out a mirthless laugh. “Why not? We can now, remember?”
“Of course. This is Heaven.”
Soldiers of Heaven don’t feel fear. Soldiers of Heaven don’t
Castiel understands this, he does, but he doesn’t
Cas’ eyes flash again. “As if you’ve never done the same.”
It's so fucking quiet.
It doesn't feel like home.
Dean Winchester is sleeping, and Castiel does not wish to wake him. He sits on the side of the motel bed and watches a mouse scurry past the window. He listens to the clock click to the next minute, slow and steady, a rhythm his vessel recognizes.
“With the changes Jack made, I think you get several.”
all along.
Castiel says nothing. He is a soldier. He is an angel of the Lord. His vessel’s heart slams against his lungs, echoing against his ears, but he says nothing.
“Yeah, I know,” he replies. He doesn't wait to hear what she was going to say.
“What’s the matter?” Chuck asks. “Not a fan of the truth?”
He will find Dean later, in the real world, the world of salt and blood and mud beneath his feet, the world his brothers and sisters don’t fully understand. He passes him an address, and the eyes around them begin to close in.
you.”
“What?” Dean barks. Whatever Sam had wanted, it’s not as important, not as imperative and immediate as the noose around their necks. It’d been funny when the internet couldn’t lie. It’d summoned a smile to his face despite it all, despite Jack, despite his mom, to see the comments under the internet posts devolve into truthful declarations:
Dean closes his eyes, sinks into Cas's back.
them when they are cut down by demons and hellhounds, but he cannot let it deter him.
“Gone.”
“I will carve those pearly wings off your back,” Dean replies, spitting blood onto the mud before Michael’s shimmering grace.
“'Bout time,” Ellen says, and plops a beer down in front of him without Dean having to ask.
“Dean,” Sam says, and then again, with more force, “
Dean dreams, and Castiel goes to him. He has to tell him, but the words get stuck in his throat. Dean’s soul shines, a lighthouse in the storm, a beacon Castiel will follow until his soles bleed, and he swallows because he can’t find the right thing to say.
His voice lowers, barely a whisper. “I
Cas goes across the room to Sam’s side, like Sam is easier to deal with, like Sam hasn’t personally betrayed him, and fuck that, honestly. Jack’s gone nuclear, and they’ve been around this block before. You don’t get to save people that far gone. You don’t get to save people who snapped your mother out of existence like it was nothing, like
He puts a hand to his face, fingertips trailing across his eyebrows, as Cas says, “Do you think I enjoy it any more than you, Dean?”
That isn’t a lie. Dean’s pissed as hell, cheeks hot, but god damn, he can’t do this now. His mom’s too fresh, too open–-the wound isn’t closed, hasn’t scabbed over, hasn’t gotten to the point again where Dean can maneuver around it safely. He’s dragging his heels over a minefield, and Jack’s stupid spell is tugging him right through the middle. He scrambles for something, anything–-
Jimmy is there, surrounding him, surging up from the corner he’s been hiding in for days.
Castiel has to send him to sleep in order to proceed. In doing so, he loses control over some of his vessel’s functions. His eyes narrow, his fingers shake, and he doesn’t bother to correct it. Dean Winchester stares at him with wide, disbelieving eyes, and Castiel is overcome with the desire to shake him. Does he not remember being pulled from Hell, being taken, being saved? There is a quick brush of something dark against his grace.
Two wolves kept prowling towards Dean, but another one got his tail between its legs and looked back at Cas, started trotting towards him. Dean hacked down with his sword, whirled to dodge a bite directed to his ankle, and at the end of the turn he made a throwing motion towards Cas. Without looking at how the throw ended, he grabbed his sword with both hands and with a roar, he delivered a vertical cut that sent blood arching towards the sky, to immediately hack down with the strength of his whole body.
He already had two burners with bubbling substances at the far end of the table. He took a third and lit it with a snap of his fingers, then put a glass container over it and poured the crushed powder inside. He took one of the bottles that rested next to the wall and poured light green liquid while in a practiced move, he kept his face away, not even surprised by the small puff of smoke that rose as the fluid came in contact with the ingredients. The mix started to bubble soon, and he adjusted the flame so that the boiling was low and constant.
“You sure you don’t wanna give up already?”
At that, John let out a delighted low chuckle. Cas looked up at him, eyes shining at his approval as he started to smile a bit. Dean bit his lip. This couldn´t be going better.
“Well, you got no veins, were making noises. Had to make sure”, Dean shook his head for a second, “Was a nightmare, though, right? I´ve got some of those”
Also, something I feel kinda guilty about xD I think I heard/read somewhere that since brain does not have nerve endings, if you hurt it directly you can´t feel pain. So the bit about "putting a spike through the part of your brain that processes pain for torture" its a bit of an artistic license xD Or maybe Crowley knows but is just making a damn good intimidation!
“I´m sorry. I… don´t want to make you uncomfortable”
He shot daggers at him, eyes shining.
Today, they go to the forest.
Dean blinked owlishly for a moment, looking around until his eyes got to Cas.
“Dad, Cas!! YOU MURDERED THEM ALL!!”, he screamed as he charged brutally against him.
“I can”, he murmured as he allowed the cloth to cover him again, eyes still cast down.
The day had progressed through merry and laughter. Charlie had asked Dean to participate in a little friendly softcombat tournament with Jo and Cas, and though the angel had politely declined, John had shown some interest. That had led to some smiling dares, and had ended up with Dean facing his dad with foam swords on their hands. The fight had been witnessed and cheered by everyone, Bobby and Ellen even placing bets. Dean had won, if barely, thanks to a technique Charlie had taught him long ago. As he lifted his father from the ground through a tight grip, his old man had smiled proudly at him, telling him that
“Yeah, okay”, he accepted at last.
A quick glance at the wall clock told him that it had been, in fact, a bit more than two hours.
“Thank you, man. Like... really”, he rasped weakly.
“Hello”
“Told you she´d like it”
There was only
Chastity was one of the highest values in nobility. Showing one´s neck or chest, being male or female, was considered scandalous, and frowned upon. So of course, his rebellious brother usually walked around flashing everyone a bit. But he usually had ways to hide his skin from their mother, even if just with illusion magic. If he was caught in such a disrespectful fashion, he would surely be disciplined in some way.
“It was his choice, you know”, Dean lifted his eyes, fear pinching his heart; while Jack observed the scenery in total peace, as if he could gaze at it for a century, “And it is the nature of things, that angels go into The Empty when their time is due”
“Don’t worry, Dean. I´ll get us to the motel safely”, he said in passing, but with some warmth behind it.
Cas was fighting tooth and nail.
Cas looked at him confused for a second.
“We got fooled, that´s what happened”, Dean answered in a low voice, “It´s not a fucking djinn”
. I´m beat. We can talk in the morning”
“Ugh”, he grunted, “Sorry I called so late. It´s nothing”
Dean stood looking at him, eyes wide.
“What?”
He looked to his left. The food tray was still on the bed, but mostly empty. Half of the salad was still on its bowl, though the nuts and berries were gone; but the plate that had contained the pie didn’t even have breadcrumbs in it. Cas squinted as he pursed his lips- Dean must have liked it. Could food be another incentive?
“Behind me, back to back, now”
Michael shook his head slightly, letting out an exasperated small huff of air, before resuming walking towards the youngest of the house.
The hunter stayed looking away for some moments, before sighing and making a small tired smile.
Cas smiled, but Dean knew him well enough to see the sadness behind it.
But as he tried to walk forward, the world tilted, and suddenly his hands were holding up the floor. Or he was holding himself on his knees. He wasn´t sure.
And he wouldn´t change it for anything, ever.
Dean was frowning, eyes widening as he touched the stone.
“Of course I´ll have you”, he said in a raspy voice, tears streaking down his face.
He looked back at Cas, who beneath his arm was frowning slightly.
“I… do not understand the mission for which my Father created me”, he finally said.
- Harry for inspiring me and giving me the courage to publish :)
Cave was a bust. Eerie, creepy as fuck- especially being illuminated by Castiel’s little ball of white light instead of the warm, shifting oranges and shadows of a torch. But it was empty- no kids, no nothing. Cas stepped on a bundle of giant spider web that was by one of the walls, and after cutting him out Dean noticed more bundles, like sheets extended in one place or another. Guessing the place had new inhabitants, they skedaddled away to continue after Sammy’s path.
“I´m… practicing some life magic”, he provided, uncomfortable, “Don´t worry, you will not have to clean that, I´ll take care of it”
Castiel glowered at both of them, as annoyed as a teenager would be towards his overprotective mum, and closed his eyes. In the next few moments the wounds of the angel started to disappear, his skin returning to his habitual tanned tone. The stains remained, though; as they had in Dean´s clothes. He was apparently not wasting any Grace on aesthetics while running low. When he was done, he looked at the brothers.
“Look… I don’t know exactly what God could want from you, Cas… But you can´t be doing it so wrong if he keeps bringing you back, right? Had you thought of that?"
“Who do you think you are?!”, Castiel roared as he swirled back.
“We need to move”, Dean growled.
However, the missing persons count had raised dramatically from one day to the next, so getting to Oklahoma had rapidly climbed up on their list of priorities. First it had been four, in the article Sam had come across to. A fifth person had been fortunately found, but the local police had declared her erratic and out of her mind. The next morning, there were already eighteen people missing; in a town that was not big enough for it to not cause a bit of a panic. Something was moving, fast, taking a huge amount of victims on its way… and the hunters wanted to get there before more official attention arrived.
“I will need only seconds, if we are so close. Hold on five seconds for me, Cas”
“They don´t look minor from here”, insisted Dean petulantly.
The door creaked, opened by the same servant that had made the bell rang from the hallway, but none of them moved.
Dean jumped back as he threw his hands up, the Impala still on his right. Panting, trembling, Cas needed a second to recognize him, and for his mind to catalog him as
Those two last ones were for him.
Also, because his mind was buzzing with an
“Dude, what the fuck!!”, he heard the hunter behind him.
Castiel made a small hopeful smile, as Kevin squirmed a bit on his seat.
They had left them? When Crowley obviously wanted the Angel Tablet back? Why?     He looked at the end of the right hallway. Nothing was there…
I absolutely LOVE this chapter. I wrote it all listening to an instrumental version of Wolven Storm from Witcher 3 on a loop, just cause the lyrics of that song go: "These scars long have yearned for your tender caress..." and I could absolutely see the events depicted here as those words flowed through my mind. Feel free to read it as it sounds, too (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j-065rVSGo). Someday, when I feel like it, Ill record myself describing the scene with the music; or maybe include a recording of me singing Wolven Storm- cause I just simply love that song ^^
He was dimly aware that the few people left around him had turned away, going towards his brother. He grunted and made a step towards him to help him.
Smallest warning: there is some talk about gender and sex. I really hope I didn't fuck up, I'm not an expert on the issue (though I did ask some nonbi and trans friends to help) and Dean´s gotta be a little bit ignorant, and this is all told from his point of view. So... hope it´s fine like that.
like him.
to make you happy, you grab it and you don´t let go. We´ve lived some intense lives, and things will probably get better with Jack in charge… but we can still get killed any day, you know?”
Fuck. He remembered alright.
“Dean!”, protested Sam.
“How does it work?”, he said in a guarded tone, still frowning angrily at Cas.
Castiel closed his eyes for a second, taking a deep breath that he let out in a sigh. He allowed himself to feel for a second. The lingering fear, the embarrassment, the enormous frustration that kept growing. He felt useless.
“How do we do it?”, he wondered out loud in absolute confusion.
Castiel sent his awareness through his hand into Dean´s lifeforce stream. He had realized over the night that it was probably best if Dean did not know he could do magic, so he veiled his actions with the physical exploration.
“I… could see if they have some pie”, he proposed with an interrogating tone.
Maybe she was the alpha to what you are facing”
They shut up, hearing the footsteps. They held their breaths, trying to fuse with the stone wall. The footsteps got close, then steadily far away. They had taken another hallway.
“Why?”
“…L-like…”
Or maybe the thing was out. Hunting more prey. Maybe they had gotten lucky.
“Look, Dean… I want to help you, I truly do. You´re hurt. I still want to try and help you with your brother if I can. But I won´t be able to if you don´t let me. And as your doctor, that requires that you trust me to some extent. You have to trust my judgment if I say that you need to rest, to stay put; and that you can´t get out of this room. I don´t… want you to feel unsafe in your place of healing. At the very least, that would be counterproductive. I also don´t want to feel like I have to watch my back around you. I´m going to have to leave eventually, or to sleep. You are, after all, in my room”
He looked at his baby brother with the most confused expression of all time.
Cas stopped drinking, and looked at Dean while he panted, waterskin still in hand.
he was, what he was
Thanks so, so much to the ones that commented with good wishes and interest in the story. Truly, you helped me motivate, and  Ive been thinking a lot of all of you. And thanks for everyone leaving kudos! In a horrible, horrible week in terms of my personal life, stars aligned and I got a kudo a day for like a whole week xD It was really the highlight of my days and it helped me lots to get through it!!
He saw Dean glimpsing at the door at that.
PS- This fanfic was inspired by another one but I dont remember the title nor author. It was one in which Dean started having dreams about Cas being a bit BDSM with him. If anyone knows it, please let me know so I can credit it!!
But the hunter had dodged masterfully to one side, and in the next instant he hacked down with a grunt, sword in both hands, and severed the head that just passed him.
Dean chuckled, amused at that.
. I think it was funny for my dad. After the years, he kept the name”
“The flame flickering doesn’t mean he is dying or hurt, that much I can tell you”, Cas provided,
there were no problems in Heaven. It was Heaven. It was perfect, as it should be.
Castiel nodded and kept going. The hunter started to dart looks back at him, and the noble started to feel embarrassed- but he could not for the life of him stop dragging his feet and hunching his shoulders forward. His arms felt as if they weighed tons.
But no. They were dead, all of them.
All of the beasts snapped their heads back to him, and even Dean stopped for a second to shoot a wide-eyed look at him. He had no time to further register the hunter´s reaction, because suddenly the creatures had spread widely around him.
“You good?”, the hunter said, smirk still on.
Castiel frowned slightly in confusion.
He quickly took out his phone and clicked the first number on his speed dial.
Kevin shuddered. Crowley got really close, to whisper into his ear.
He could barely remember to finish the scotch and leave the glass on the table before rushing towards his brother, half running. He didn’t want to look like an eager teenager- but damn did he feel like one.
“Wanna give them a try?”
He didn’t stir. Shit, he slept like a brick.
“His proudest creation”, countered Cas, smiling back.
“I got you, I got you! Hnng!”, he grunted as the centipede reached him anyway, and he stopped its clacking mandibles with his sword.
“Hey!!”
By his side, the angel took a deep breath and steeled himself, straightening his back. Dean smirked, he looked as if he was squaring his shoulders for his garrison inspection.
Both lowered their eyes for a second, considering themselves mildly scolded for insulting each other- again. Then Dean smiled up at his brother and walked two steps towards him.
“What is it?”, asked the angel.
dropped his beer. He´d remember that! He would. Where had that idea come from? His stomach tightened again, cold fear sipping into his veins.
that wants to eat me in better condition. Or you´re waiting till I´m okay to cook my organs into a potion”
“Well”, said Dean with a fake, tense smile to his lips, “as I see it, the symbol had been trashed and the portal was gone. So getting you out of the fire meant getting all of us a ride back home, the
He found a glowering Dean turning back to him from where he was standing in front of the window. He looked upset, but not as enraged as before.
“Such wit. So much
If he had been smarter… faster, stronger, if he had known, if he´d been better…
Castiel let out a sigh of relief while he slowly turned, trying to figure out how he was supposed to look at the hunter in the eyes now.
So he dismissed it as he kneeled beside the man that had ended all his hopes and dreams, and roared wildly as he punched his face, his knuckles blooding.
“Uuuuh, I don’t know, spending the rest of your life with someone you love?”, Dean answered opening his hands, palms showing.
“I get the thingy, you get to work, man”
“Exactly”, Dean grunted, and the mage could hear the smile in his voice.
“Oh, please”, she groaned, mortified.
“Alright, Sammy”, Dean said, closing the Impala´s trunk, “Let´s roll”
“What?”, he blinked at him, confused.
His head snapped upon Dean´s warning and he lounged to one side, the endrega missing him and bellowing his rage. He scrambled up to his feet and looked around. The plant was up ahead, the endrega was slowing down his charge on his right. Close behind him, Dean still roared and hacked, but the other endrega was far from finished.
“He´s got a gift for you”, Dean provided.
Cas nodded, head slump. He had to honor Dean´s decision. He hated it, and he was sure it was a bad choice. But he had to. And he understood the drive to protect those he loved.
“Wow. Really?”
… Just, bring the stuff already!”
the gaps of his pelvis, diving down into his covered groin, and he gulped. Dean looked at him with a weirded out expression as he tilted his head. A big drop of water fell from his hair at the movement, sliding down his neck, hitching for a second on his clavicle, to finally continue its journey down his pectoral.
The mage nodded before plumping what was left of the pastry into his mouth and cleaning the sugar from his fingers with a white napkin that he quickly put away.
Their heads would reach up to Castiel´s chest, and they were bigger than horses.
Cas stared at Dean, his face an expressionless mask.
Dean looked down and patted on his belly, raising his eyebrows as he probably felt absolutely no pain for the first time in days. He grabbed his shirt and before Cas could react, tucked it out of his pants to check his unmarred stomach. The mage cleared his throat and looked away.
to care for his wounds and clean his skin. And... anyone with eyes would have to admit that that was a beautiful specimen of a human being.
“She was with you, you dumbass. It´s not like I ever had a secret crush on her”
YES, as a welcoming event, I'm publishing two chapters at the same time, weeee ^^
But Cas smiled at him.
“Ok, ah… H-here it… it talks about h-how an angel can get like… a lot of power…”
They had decided to stay one more day on the bunker to help Kevin settle down. They had used the unlimited credit card Charlie had made them, that solved their need for more scamming, to buy him a videogame station amongst other things. The kid was still pretty jumpy, and had asked for pills to sleep; but he seemed eager to resume some of the hobbies he had before focusing solely on studying first, then on the prophet deal. Like games and books.
“That I´m as interested in that little quarrel as I am in all of the Four Stars shit they keep trying to drag me into”
At the end of their second day hunting together, Dean and Cas found Sam's trail. Dean suggested celebrating it, and they both talked and drinked together, but when Dean adresses in horror the subject of Castiel's arranged marriage, the mage is clearly offended and angry. They both go to bed with things tenser than ever.
The mage frowned.
, wow”
Dean blinked and looked at the bed he was occupying, as if he was considering Cas´s side of things for the first time.
. Move!”, he said with a shoving move of his hand.
That he was touching his chest in an almost hypnotized fascination.
before I met you. I have duties and responsibilities, that I have been postponing for way too long”
“Wait a second. Are you saying that nobles don’t ever
He passed his hands over his face, letting out a deep breath into them.
The angel turned to look at him. He was still wearing the damned suit and blue tie, Dean had convinced him to ditch the trenchcoat for the occasion. The hunter shook his head as he saw the tan garment folded over a near chair.
“Yes”, he opted to say before opening his eyes again and blinking them open, pressure fading.
But the other monster had not stopped moving. It had immediately run around its partner- and it now charged against Dean, against the other creature.

, he thought,
“Then… can we just be guest and host, and forget about everything else?”
A small silence followed his statement. When Cas looked up at Dean, having gotten lost in thought with a small frown, he found the hunter with a puzzled expression.
“Did you learn nothing from Purgatory?”, Dean roared towards him, angry.
. But
going on between us, but I don’t know, I thought it was cause you are an angel, and whatever the
“Hell, when you stopped like that…”, he snorted, “I thought you realized it was silver and that your cover was blown. Jeez, don´t do that, man”, Dean said, shaking his head.
The Seraphs were the title of the most important generals in Heaven´s Army. They were reduced in number, incredibly powerful, decisive for battle, and a huge awful loss for the whole kingdom.
“I have no idea how you can notice those things”, the mage sighed behind him, “Even when you point it out, it’s so difficult to see”
“Release!! Him!! Fucker!!”, he roared as he did.
“I see that!”
As he crossed the frontier that the treetops formed, lion-like roars from the creatures traveled to him; but also a cry of challenge, and… the guttural whine of a beast being hurt.
He was lying on his motel bed, a pillow under his knee, a packet of ice over it to reduce the swelling. Sam had cleaned it and bandaged it as best he could, and left him there to rest as he checked the local news on his laptop to see if any statements on the victims found by the police were published. Dean was watching TV, volume low since he only wanted a minor distraction, and had his back prepped on some more pillows. He needed to be kinda vertical to drink, after all.
“Very”, agreed Cas.
Michael, Samandriel, Lucifer, Uriel, Castiel himself- they always wore their shirts buttoned up to their necks. The only difference in summer were the thinner fabrics, and maybe arms exposed if the occasion was casual enough. Aside from Gabriel, and from… Dean the other night, Castiel hadn´t seen the exposed skin of another besides hands, faces and arms since he used to bathe with his brothers, when they were practically babies. Other people he had healed, their wounds hadn´t been so serious, and he could do it all through their clothing with magic. His situation was not a rare one, given that he hadn´t gotten married yet. Some nobles visited brothels to skip that restriction… but Cas truly wasn´t into that.
Cas did not raise his gaze. He hated worrying his brother this way, and lying to him…
The noble made a sleepy sigh as he frowned, and a few moments later, opened confused eyes, blinking like an owl.
“Untie me”, said Kevin, “I´ll help along”.
“Where´s the bluestone right now?”, Dean grunted over his shoulder.
“Snap…! Out of it!!”, the man grunted as one, two savage hits got Dean on the face and he blinked dizzily for a second.
“But he doesn´t have a higher purpose now”, Dean answered, “I mean, he stopped following Heaven´s orders long ago”
“Come with me?”, he repeated.
Cas nodded. He walked towards the door, but stopped with a hand on the handle.
Cas looked at Dean in absolute surprise, marveled and shocked at the display of emotion and happiness that something so simple and unimportant to him had created. The hunter passed an arm over his shoulder and took him closer fondly.
And then, he looked up at Dean.
Cas looked at him surprised. When had he taken the weapon again?
“I swear, I will replace anything you may have lost. I have the money. Even for a hunter´s sword”
“How´s the war going, Mother?”, asked Lucifer.
“This morning, the anesthetic I applied the previous night was still acting, masking the pain. Of course your wounds still hurt. Closed doesn’t mean healed”, Cas clarified, “They are just not bleeding anymore. They are still tender, you can reopen them if you move around too much. I can apply some more anesthetic if you wish me to”
Dean smiled a bit too and clasped his shoulder once before letting go.
“Yes!”, he hissed, flinching, “Y-yes…”
And Dean stopped at that, panting. The crack was like a palm long now… but it wasn’t a matter of breaking the glass and gripping the doorknob on the other side. Sam had tried that, and it hadn´t worked. No, he´d have to tear it all down, to the wood, to the frame…
with a fond smile.
“I remember his love. His patience. I remember sitting on his lap while he told me stories. I remember him nursing me back to health, patiently by my bedside. I remember that for a time, probably after he spent so much time healing me, he paid more attention to me than to any of my other eight siblings”, he said with a guilty smile of glee, “I remember his lessons. His values. I just don’t remember, you know. His face, or his name. But that’s not important. I remember who he was, in the way that matters”
“Can we turn it off?”
“I know that this is uncommon, and that it must be difficult for you to trust a stranger, if your life has been as complicated as you tell me it has. But I swear to you- I mean you no harm, nor bear nefarious intentions towards you. I will teleport you out when you are healed, and I
A sound indicated that a head rolled through the leaves, but Cas didn’t see. Panting, he couldn´t tear his eyes away from the creature that had run towards him- Dean´s dagger buried to the hilt into its head, the creature limp on the floor. The mage blinked in confusion. He located his angel blade in one of the corpses on the ground. When Dean had switched weapons, letting go of his blade and taking the dagger from his belt, he had never seen it.
“Cas, I
“What? But, we still have hours of daylight”, Cas protested with more doubt than disagreement.
I wanted to talk a bit about the so many tags I have xD There are so many things I want to touch and include. But I know I don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable, so I will as much as I can, find ways so that people that don´t want to read something that can trigger them, can avoid it. Some parts are key for a story and can´t be avoided... but some are. For example, about transphobia, I have figured out a way to mark the part it´s mentioned so that anyone that wants to avoid it can- and still miss nothing of the plot. It happens, it is in the lore, but they don´t have to read over the specifics. The same with smut- I know people are not comfortable with it, so if it ever happens, it will be set in a separate chapter that non-smutters can easily jump without missing anything (it will have happened in the story, but they don´t have to read how it happens). Let me know if this works for you guys or if there are any other triggers I should pay attention to!
Crowley was out. It was game over.
“My family”, he said in a slow, deliberate tone, “can be very protective of one another. They don´t… disregard peasants as much as others- but having one of them in their halls is far different than managing their villages fairly. Understand that I have brought a stranger into our home and, potentially, put them in danger. There are expensive possessions in our house, valuable information. I think… if some members learned of your presence here, their reaction would not be a positive one”
“They are not unkillable, but it can get pretty messy. I wouldn’t like facing two at a time. And we don’t have much time to waste”, Dean explained.
There. He´d said it. He risked a look towards the angel. His back had straightened and his eyes, lost in the cornfield, were getting wide. He was pale. He looked… hopeful and scared at the same time.
and not understanding
Because they knew it was their kind of deal. According to the articles, the woman in the hospital kept blabbing about her perfect life lost, her long-dead son being with her again, how badly she wanted to go back.
And after adopting a serene expression, he opened the wooden double door.
“Your
“Did you”, he said in a slow whisper, “intend to die on the mission today?”
The hunter pressed his lips in frustration, but nodded meekly.
“I have to go”, he grunted, swinging his legs over the side of the bed with a pained wince, but looked up at Cas as he put a firm hand on his chest.
. He grabbed his head and violently crashed it into his unhurt knee. His enemy groaned and fell to his knees, dizzy. The hunter bent down to entangle his fingers on that stupid long hair, and grabbed it to smack his face into the stone floor. Dean heard him cry out as he felt the satisfying crunch of a nose being broken, and he smiled.
“… but I thought that, since I could finally show up, we could have a little something today if you don´t mind?”, Dean smiled at her.
He gasped, panting, he couldn’t breathe. It was an effort to inhale and exhale.
The angel looked at both of them with uncomprehension, then at Dean, who gave him an encouraging smile. He then shrugged, as if he simply decided to accept it, and dedicated the couple a small smile.
Crowley looked down to him, his face turning into stone, but voice frighteningly soft.
“No if you wanna keep your promise of being already searching at first light, it´s not”, Dean growled as he crawled back to his side of the bed to sit on the edge, “In my opinion, we are in fact
in his room. That could really bring him a world of trou…
“Cool”
Sam was looking at him with a confused and very sorry expression. He parted his lips as if he was going to say something, but then pressed them as he winced, eyes glistening a bit.
Dean crawled to the dropped cellphone on the floor and took it to his ear, while Cas kept calling them incessantly.
“Do you want to find out?”, Cas barked out.
“Just, accept it and drink it. Not the whole bottle, space it out. Don´t look at him too much. Look at the garden, at the people, instead. Be relaxed, as if nothing happened”
“I...”
“I´m just glad I could help. And that we could get Kevin back”
To his horror, his dad run towards his mum, taking the hand she extended to him as a cry of help- and the fire swirled from her arm to his, to his chest, to his whole body.
He blinked, an idea latching. His clothes. Very flammable.
I ALMOST FORGOT SOMETHING SUPER IMPORTANT!!!
Dean closed his eyes and just panted, savoring safety for a second, and tried to convince his highly adrenalized body that the danger had passed. He had fallen on his side along with Cas, who he had still been hugging when they popped up. He rolled onto his back, an arm pinned to the floor by the angel´s weight, and the stone felt cool and calming against his sweaty, tired flesh.
Dean was even having fun.
“Magic”, Cas smiled, “It´s just some basic lightomancy, purification”
“Yes, Dean?”
The hunter was mostly clean- as clean as one partly wiped could be-, his wounds treated, and he was profoundly asleep. Castiel took the sheets and covered him with them, a proud smile to his lips, considering his task finished for the moment.
A few seconds later, the pair of earrings shone on her ears, their green radiance lighting her eyes.
They both hug and slapped their backs. As they did, Sam whispered into his ear:
He walked to the sink as he sighed. He tapped gently the runestone that allowed the water to flow and splashed some on his face, washing away the last remnants of sleep and a bit of the panic too. After wiping the last droplets away with a towel, he looked himself in the mirror. He wasn’t pale, unlike the previous day. He got even closer to the surface, leaning forward as he unbuttoned his shirt. He grimaced in slight disgust and rubbed frowning the little spots of black that marked the skin over his heart, but other than that and some weak tendrils that tried to stretch themselves towards his clavicle, it was all gone. Not bad, not bad at all. He could do magic without problems that day- and if he didn´t exert himself too much, it wouldn´t even pile up. He finished undressing.
“Not many, gotta admit”, Dean shook his head, “The few encounters I had… let´s say they didn´t leave me
Of course, it was her reaction the one he feared the most if Dean was discovered. He would not stop following his beliefs, even with the shadow of his mother hovering over him. He was a healer, and as such he would not turn his back on someone that needed help. He had found his own ways to secretly rebel- what she didn´t know, wouldn´t hurt her, and neither would him.
“I thought healing magic was like potions. Potions don’t fix cirrhosis, that I know for sure”, he snorted, “Most of the hunters I know chug’em on a daily basis, but that ain’t stopping the alcohol reaper”
Cheerful sunshine entered the white-tiled kitchen through the glass doors and the big picture windows. The room faced the backyard, and it received gladly every ounce of light the exterior would offer. Outside, Dean could see the big extension of grass where he had learned to play catch with his dad, as well as throwing knives; surrounded by trees and bushes, a high wooden fence delimiting the whole space. Mountains in the distance. Clear skies.
Castiel inhaled and huffed out firmly, a determined expression taking over his features. He had been taken off balance, but he was back on track. This little pause would be incredibly helpful.
Dean looked at him for another second, then let out a sigh while he shook his head, anger slipping into disappointment and maybe relief.
“No spying, either?”, Cas looked at him squinting his eyes in suspicion.
“He wanted to know how it had gone. I didn’t tell him you were hurt”
. How many times have you saved the world? Do you think it can afford to lose you?”
. Great move, Cas! And praising his sons´ hunting abilities, he was
“Kevin”
Danger.
Castiel looked up and smiled slightly at him.
“Oh, hey”, Dean caught her by the wrist with wide eyes, “I just got an idea. Why don´t you put on that green dress you have? I´m sure it will look awesome with those. Can you do that for me?”, he gave her his sweetest smile.
“What? No, of course not”, he grunted offended, frowning, making Cas smile.
Sam´s eyebrows shot up and he looked at Dean, his idea latching on his brain too. The angel looked at Jessica as if asking for permission, and she made a small smile and nodded. He looked down at her womb and… his eyes melted, as if he was seeing the most moving thing that had ever existed.
Dean just ate, observing the angel. He seemed suddenly hopeful at the mention of the tablet, a small smile to his lips. He was still laying on the bed, both hands on his chest, one on top of the other. Seemed to have no intention of sitting up.
“As I said, if I don’t use my Grace for the next days, it won´t get worse. It´s just uncomfortable”
“Oh, yeah”, he nodded as he rose his eyebrows- as if he could ever forget.
A chapter at a time :)
“So you mean, he feels his angelic penis is too small and he has to compensate?”
Dean let out a huff. Awkward was so awkward. He hated it. Fuck, what he would give to be able to have an excuse and go to another room. But till he found Sammy, this room was his whole world, he guessed- forest aside. He shifted his weight between his feet, feeling a little bit trapped.
“Gone”
In the confinements of his car, his home, with no one close, he started hitting the dashboard with a fist, over, and over, and over; as he grunted and finally screamed. He roared in rage and fury, for all the ones he had lost, for all the ones he thought he had gotten back, and lost again; until he ran out of breath.
Sam pursed his lips in thought as he beat some eggs. They were both engaged in making breakfast, alone in the kitchen of the Men of Letters.
“Dude, you have
“Like
He was safe.
Cas hastily took the cloths that had contained his meal and used them to surround the heart of his apple before putting them inside his bag. He didn’t want to leave any obvious trails that a creature could use to follow them. Dean’s hand appeared in front of his face as he started to stand up, and he took it with a grateful little smile. Dean didn’t smile, his expression focused. After bringing him to his feet, the hunter quickly turned away to start walking.
But Dean didn’t listen. Christ, he could still hear him screaming, both with his gravel voice and that screeching sound… Relief made him close his eyes again, a shudder running through him. The bastard was fine. He was hurt, still a stubborn son of a bitch with some sacrificing wishes, but
His skin spoke to Castiel as clearly as his muscles did. A long scar on the man ́s palm told him that he was disciplined or stubborn enough to have stopped a sword with his bare hand. Star-shaped marks on his knuckles drew him a picture of fistfights as he passed his towel around each finger, one at a time. With his injured arm clean, Cas turned to his chest. He found claw marks over a well-defined pectoral that told him both about past battles, and about the strength that man had to push monsters away from him. He remembered how he had shoved away the woodland fiend. His cloth traveled down his neck and shoulder, developed enough so that he would have no problem climbing, or lifting things over his head. In his mind, Cas saw him raise his longsword in the air for a finishing blow. The hunter did not bulge with overdeveloped muscles, but was lean like a runner, like a climber, a jumper- made to thrive in nature, and obviously built for a fight.
And then Dean gasped violently as his whole body started to shake. His brain snapped in two and he screamed in pain, and his sound redoubled as he started feeling the horrible cries of help his body was sending him, his knee the most painful. He slumped against the floor.
He was back on the rack. Back on Hell.
Dean had just looked away. There was no easy answer. So he gave none.
Hot liquid fountained on Cas´s cheek and chest, and he turned his head away as the wolf let out a high-pitched whine and its paws patted frantically on top of him. The panting hunter planted his feet and as he roared he shoved the beast strongly with his shoulder, making it tumble away from Castiel.
Dean kept his gaze low, looking at his beverage. Cas took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh.
He had to get to his brother. He needed him. He was his responsibility.
Sam frowned as he saw Cas enter the room still clutching his arm.
Yes, if they could hide in the ferns, it meant that they weren´t as tall as his knees. Cas took a shaky breath and nodded, though a little voice on the back of his head reminded him how Dean had said earlier that he didn’t know how to use a sword if he hadn´t ever killed anything with it.
Castiel whirled his head in that direction- and saw the fern leaves disturbed… making a beeline of shaking plants towards them.
“Cas?”, said slightly.
But suddenly Dean stopped, and his back bumped into his.
“Magic can heal anything. Almost anything”, he corrected himself, “If the healer is good enough”, he added with a small smile.
“Oh, no”, he answered with a small smile, understanding the confusion, “He just left”
“Hey, you. Martyr”, he grunted, “How about you heal yourself first, huh?”
“Holy shit, Sammy”, he repeated, a bit out of breath.
“Death was not my objective… but it was a possible and acceptable result”.
“Dean?”
“I can clean up”, Dean offered.
“What?”, the mage asked, turning his head towards him.
“Tell me where you are”, the angel demanded, “I will get there immediately”
“Well. No wonder there´s almost nothing in this part of the forest”, the hunter said, and he looked up at the mage, “Those were…”
The angel stopped talking, sadness in his eyes. Dean felt like shit. He felt like he was making Cas feel bad about having told him. He didn´t know how to do this right. But he had a speech, and it was the only thing he could hold on to.
“Okay. Plants are denser here, so watch your step. In every sense. For one, raise your knees higher than you usually do, step with determination so you don’t slip on the leaves. Also, remember there can be things in the bushes, in the trees, or beneath the ferns or fallen leaves. Don’t forget to stay alert and watch your surroundings. I´ll take the lead, you follow”
“Ah… yes”, Castiel admitted looking down.
“So your batteries are low, huh?”
- MossMan(Note) for their awesome, AWESOME Cas designs. I could not be more in love with it ^^
“Oh?”, he said.
In those confusing instants the tentacles had strengthened their grip on Sam and Kevin, who started to emit suffocated screams; and some had curled up Cas´s arms as he extended them towards the prophet and his brother.
“It´s showtime”, Dean grinned an eager grin.
“I am so fucking sorry”, he could not help to say, “I never… meant… I only meant that… you deserve better, man, and…”
“He was your father”, he told the sky, a knot on his throat, “Without him, you would have never been born. Damn, Sam and I were eager to gank you. So… I thought that maybe, just maybe, you could… I don´t know. Make an exception?”
“I… will check if there´s any Corruption left when I get in the bathroom”
“Cassie”, his brother took his chin to make him look him in the eye, “I know you´re training hard, okay? You barely ever leave your room, everything you do is related to the Academy in one way or another… I get it, okay? It´s important to you, to get into the army. But
And they stayed there, sitting against the Impala. For some moments Dean focused only on breathing, his brain finally catching up completely with what just had happened. Had it really happened? He´d said yes!! He couldn´t believe it. It was crazy. He looked sideways at Cas, who seemed to have regained control over the waterworks, and had his eyes closed as he kept the happiest and most thrilled smile he´d ever seen in him. It moved him a little.
Cas fled, heartbeat a furious drum on his chest, blood rushing in his ears, as the electric shock of fear tingled down his limbs. The last thing he had seen had been Dean charging towards the two enormous creatures, that right now rumbled in unnatural angry growls at his back. He tripped once, and twice, on the irregular forest floor; but both times he regained his footing in a flail of limbs and shaken plants. He´d only been this scared when the Darkness had chased after him as a teen, and his mind unkindly reminded him of it, making the noose on his stomach tighten even more.
, he said to himself breathing in deeply,
The Road So Far: Castiel, a mage that was returning from the Academy, finds a wounded hunter in the Doomed Forest of Wyvernon. He brings him home to heal him.
“We won’t have to hunt for our subsistence in the Army, the Crown provides prepared rations”, Castiel countered.
in there. Dean had never been small, and it was a fucking pain to have his shoulders trapped between the wall of the thing and his non-stopping squirming sibling. His giant thing of a brother had to bend his head to one side to fit, and was obviously even more uncomfortable than him.
Dean looked sadly at the angel. The poor thing had probably thought for years that this could never happen. That Dean could not ever love him back… It was probably difficult for him to believe this. Maybe he needed more. And he deserved more. Dean took a deep breath and steeled himself before turning fully to him.
. Was pretty sure that those ointment bottles beside the shower- he could get five out of each. And a dark, dark part of himself told him that if he took one, Cas would probably never realize.
The hunter looked at him in confusion, but he wasn’t fighting anymore.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes”, the mage answered as he took a bowl and started to munch on some oatmeal.
an issue among the nobility”, Cas admitted, looking away in slight discomfort, “Like… people
Castiel opened his eyes with a startled sound, hands pushing away whatever tug on his arm, recoiling. Heart racing, he looked wildly around.
“Hey…”, he murmured as he carefully opened the door after knocking, head peeking in as soon as he was able to.
Since the rock didn´t buck, the force dragged him and the beast through the carpet of dirt and leaves.
, Cas thought for the millionth time.
“Oh! Sam!!!”
“Of course, milord. I will get to it right away”, smiled the servant.
“Even after defeating the biggest power that´s ever existed, you still believe you didn’t do enough. That is… so you”, he smiled fondly.
“Um, Dean…”, he turned to him with uncertain eyes, “What… would you like for breakfast?”, he asked shyly.
He got lost in the repetitive motions for a little while, and a comfortable silence extended between them. They passed the waterskin back and forth, and ate. Dean started to alternate bites from his sandwich to his apple, his eyes alert around them. Cas finished his sandwich and cleaned his sauce-stained hands with the cloth, to immediately dive down to the rest of the sweets. He still felt pretty hungry when he got to his piece of fruit, then a slurping sound made him look up.
The House of the Mighty was the most powerful of them.
He felt so relieved. He liked Cas. He hated having made him upset- but that was water under the bridge. Now they’d go search for Sammy. And he would train him as they did. He would help the noble as much as he could, just as he was doing for him. He had no magic to offer him- but he had experience, knowledge, and Cas needed exactly that.
It got to him. That dark fog, engulfing in its speed everything around him immediately - the garden, the sky, the Spire walls, still so far away… all gone. Only darkness. He fell to the ground coughing, suddenly short of air, and he desperately gasped. He felt it crawling through his mouth and nose, getting
“I don´t see a reason why not”
He wanted to kick himself in the nuts. He already knew. Or did he?
“There are two options for nobles, Dean”, Castiel said in a severe tone, his frown deep, “You have many children, or you fight in the Army. Or in my case, if you’re asked for it, you do both. You don’t have a say in it. You do what you’re demanded to do. It doesn’t matter what you
“Well, I don´t know exactly, but I´d bet my sweet ass that… time´s up”
“I guess not”, said Cas, smiling.
“Start reading”, and ordered the demon beside him, “Start writing down”.
“Holy…!”, he started exclaiming.
“I´ve… never studied a lot on the matter”, he admitted, “What´s exactly the problem you have?”
“Hey, Castiel, hold up”, he heard behind him, “Just one thing, before you go”
Dean huffed out a breath, obviously uncomfortable, anguish in his eyes. He looked as restless as an animal in a cage. Cas understood- he had thought he was finally leaving, right that moment…
“You haven’t been, for the longest time now, so
Castiel shook his head a little, bewildered for a second upon realizing how commonly a phrase like that was heard in their dinners. He took his fork and tried to eat something, sternly ignoring the icepick nailing the center of his forehead.
“Yeah, I guess. I mean… Fuck, Cas. It´s important”
This story will see the light.
So he put on some sweatpants and got out of his room while still pulling a cotton T-shirt through his head.
Kevin looked around in confusion… he couldn’t move his head a lot. He was tied to a sturdy chair that had built-in straps that trapped his ankles and wrists… and something metallic was strapped to his forehead.
The hunter had his gaze lost in the cauldron. He looked at Cas…  with a strange mix of anger, hope, worry, and a little confusion.
He had intended to
“And we still get to travel, and go to bars and meet chicks and watch TV”
he had done it. He was a
“Keep. Reading”
“The merit was not only mine”, the angel dedicated half a smile towards Dean as he looked at him sideways.
There, in… the middle of the cornfield that extended in front of him. There, in his stupid trenchcoat and blue tie.
Sam got up shortly after, mentioning he was going to get the other sandwich to Kevin. Dean finished his beer and took both bottles to the sink before leaving the kitchen towards his room, half a sandwich still to eat on his plate.
“Is there anything we can do for you? Shall I prepare you some holy water shots or something?”, he asked bobbing his eyebrows.
And the mage winced, praying hard that something he had
“I know”, repeated the angel, looking annoyed at him.
“Yes, he´s here”, he said bluntly but without heat, more tired than angry, “Since he´s the only reason we could pull this off. And since he´s family”, he added, wanting to make sure utility reasons were not the important ones.
, even from the outside!”, Dean declared in an amazed tone.
. He took all of the staff members, housekeep or soldiers, that got to him before my older brothers did”
“Castiel”, Dean said immediately in a menacing tone, “I have looked
Their joined birth had resulted in two incredibly strong magical talents with basically the same level of power; which was good for the House reputation, and good for the kingdom, always in need of strong warriors. However, it also posed a problem for heritage. Traditionally, the Morningstar would be the one to lead the house after the father stepped out from those responsibilities, or after he passed away. Their parents had let them all know many years ago that which of them would be considered Morningstar would be decided when they got older, and that until that point, none of them were. Their mother ruled the House for the moment.
They must have entered through a door at his back, got close to the demon silently and killed it without it being the wiser. Not allowing it to use him as hostage.
Cas took another deep breath. His mind raced, trying to think if he could be forgetting something, anything they might need. He went over the list of monsters he knew were most common on the Wyvernon Forest from his mental bestiary one last time. But finally, he pressed his lips. They had potions, Dean´s expertise, his magic, a plan. There was no more preparation he could make.
Getting closer.
“Cas, teleport out!!”, Dean said in a shrilling voice.
, are you? You had no idea something dangerous was out there”
“Oh, here he comes”
Bobby gave him a warm, compassionate smile, and said nothing else.
he had tried but had failed. Such a mess”, Dean chuckled.
Cas managed to look up to glare at the hunter.
Seconds passed, there was confusion, shouting, hissing; and suddenly every lasting victim was swarming them in the entrance hallway as the slithering creeper came down the steps. Dean was like three feet away from Sam, who was at the end of the stairs, and each of them had their own share of sick people at them.
“Dear Lord, let me see”, the mage said with a worried frown as he put his palms on his abdomen and back, surrounding the penetrated area, and closed his eyes.
think I´m ever going to be able to forget that?”, he asked, a small shrill in his voice, looking at his friend as if he was crazy.
Dean frowned as he handed the blade back to his friend. After Sam and Kevin used and closed the portal, if Cas´s wings were fucked up; they were not getting out, even if they ever made it out of the Holy Fire.
Dean blinked tiredly, thinking... then his orbs wandered in different directions, connecting dots, and looked up in alarm.
“Yeah, yeah. Same. Whatever”, Dean grunted as he let his eyes slid close.
. So fucking wrong, and I can´t… And you know what? You are
“Dude, you can try to explain all you want, but the truth is that everything you did tonight, it was us first and you last. Even when it didn’t make sense!”, he gestured with an open hand, “We all needed you wings to get out but you took care of me first”
“Cas…”, he whispered.
“I didn´t mean…”, he frowned in regret.
He looked back at Dean with a small smile, a bit more confident- and much more present, the hunter realized.
“How do you want to do it?”, asked Cas.
”, and he marked the word with a big amount of incredulity, “not ask any questions, and stay out of my business, if I asked you for something sketchy?”
. His skin felt still on fire, the pain was incapacitating, and he groaned in frustration. He suddenly felt a hand on his arm… And almost fell to the floor in relief. He looked down to see Cas lower his hand and close his eyes, laying his head on the floor.
“What is it?”, the hunter asked impatiently, eyes searching frantically around the trees.
He had realized that he was looming over an unconscious, half-naked man.
“I´m sorry I cannot offer you a separate cot”, Castiel sighed.
“´Course I can”, grunted the hunter, getting to his feet.
“I don´t just need to pass the tests. I need to pass them
“Oh. Hey”, he heard Dean at his back, and he turned to him, “Had a look at your clothes earlier… and I realized, I´ve got two petitions for you, if you are going to come hunting with me”
“Dude,
“It’s okay”, he sighed, “It was a long time ago. I got over it”
“Surprise!!!”, a dozen voices chanted.
Dean seemed outrageously okay with his body being torn and bleeding, and kept looking at him as if he had lost his mind for wanting to restore it to an adequate state. Castiel looked down, trying to settle. If he didn’t want to, that was it. He respected his patients’ wishes. It was also true that… right now, doing more magic would certainly wear him down enormously. But he couldn’t stop frowning, a yearning on his heart unable to be unheard.
“Do you know…”, he continued, low and menacing now, “what I have planned for you?”
“Hey, it´s
And two eyes opened, furiously illuminated, spearing him.
His mother run to throw his arms around his neck, and his gigantic sibling took her and even lifted her up a bit from the floor as he hugged her back.
“We gotta do something. We´re sitting ducks here, they´re gonna find us eventually”
. The hunter hadn’t pressed, simply shrugging and telling him to do
Air in. Cas was gazing at him, too long, too intently, as he so many times did.
“That´s better”, grunted Dean.
“Dean!”, he heard Sam shouting.
Castiel looked at him, shocked for a second.
“I w-will show you to the bathroom!”, Cas stammered, starting to walk around the bed, walking past the window.
“Don´t be so hard on him”, Sam said as he poured the batted eggs into a skillet, “He thought he was doing the right thing. As always. And it´s not as if you or me haven´t done that kind of stupid thing before”
“What the hell, man!”, exclaimed Dean.
The house was big, an old colonial thing, with a wooden porch with creaking old steps that menaced to give in under their weight. Its windows have been boarded long ago, the wooden planks covered in moss and mold. The years had not been kind on the abandoned structure, and it looked like one of so many haunted houses they had been to in the past.
“Yeah, but… Dean…”
Dean pursed his lips, saying nothing, probably doubting. Cas floundered for a second.
Castiel blinked at that, and frowned pensively. Dean felt some hope. Maybe he wasn´t doing such a bad job.
Stab, twist. Holy shit, of course. He and his brothers, they were hunters. They had started hunting because of mum´s death…
Halfway through the bowl, he started moving. He frowned, coughed some liquid out, and suddenly started flailing.
“What if we misgendered our child for years, Dean?”
Castiel looked up at Dean´s snap, who was looking annoyingly at him.
“Kevin”, Cas said, leaning on the kitchen table, “I… don´t intend to force you to do anything. But this is very, very important. Crowley, he has this… new beast. Maybe we could find in the tablets the way to fight it”
“Hm. One day if we are lucky, two if we´re not. Really depends on how many problems we run into, how fast we move. Do we have to go all the way back to where the stone thingy is?”
Cas looked at him, a swirl of emotions stirring in his belly. His initial glee for being where he was dissipated as his usual worries came back into his head. He unintentionally let out a sigh. He stayed silent for a moment, expression serious and somber, as he searched for words.
He looked up and shook his head.
… Wait, I don’t…”
For a fucking second there… he had only thought of his dead family members.
“But not only that. That´s just taking their Grace, that´s too easy a feat to appear in the Angel Tablet.
On a final note, here you got the ages in case someone's curious (THIS WAS A BITCH TO MAKE xD):
, but dizziness made him unable to move for a second.
… two.
“The hell... are you doing...?”, rasped a voice.
“Saw it. T’s okay. Juveniles won’t attack unless you literally kick the nest”
Crowley made a little smile, hands clasped behind his back, unimpressed at the display.
The fire cage had seemed to have contained around eight demons- now only six alive- but now he could also see the seven hellhounds. It was fucking crowded in there. One of the pooches went to the ground, but as Cas retrieved his blade, another jumped at his back and… chomped on mid-air. The angel threw his head back in a roar of pain, as two huge black wings suddenly flicked in and out of existence, appearing as the hound shook violently his head to tear and rip.
After facing several monsters, Dean and Cas continue their journey through the Doomed Forest of Wyvernon, searching for signs of Sam´s presence.
“Uh… sorry, what… what does that mean?”
, he thought, looking wildly around.
To anyone accompanying me for the ride, thank you ^^. Im really glad you like my little world.
“Six”
Sam´s eyes shot wide open and he looked down at her.
“…oh”
“Okay, I´m decent”, he heard, still a bit too soon- but maybe he was a fast dresser?
, or worried about protecting us because we are
“Hi, Jess”, Dean said, raising his eyes to the woman´s, still with one knee in the ground and still with one hand to her belly; a silly smile on his face.
“Okay”, he murmured, “Research time”
“What?”, Dean said incredulously, “You´re mad at me because I saved you?”
, and he would have no other chance. So he gulped as he slowly, doubtfully, raised his hand to… take it closer… to the glass…
“And… I, Dean Winchester, give you mine...”
“Yes, definitely”
Jessica´s and Sam´s voices quickly followed Castiel´s, one higher-pitched, another more howling; a chorus of nightmares, the worst thing Dean had ever heard, he thought as he screamed too.
“Yeah, yeah, I know”
Jo needles him in the side with her elbow. It's just as pointy as Dean remembers. “You left us hanging for so long. I'm not exactly
“Come,” Michael commands. It’s not spoken, but it is, it’s
Castiel stands above Dean Winchester’s sleeping form and stares, stares, can’t tear his eyes away.
Somehow, it's easier to say to the dark. The night doesn't judge, doesn't mock. The shadows curl around him in an embrace, emboldening him. Shit, he should have said all this before he even died. He should have yelled it to the sky until Cas finally heard him. It's what Cas would have done, probably.
“That’s because each time something goes wrong, you shut down and immediately jump into being defensive!”
They stare at each other.
He is breaking rank, disobeying orders. Behind him, others in his garrison have already turned to fight off the demons closing in on their location, and he should help them. He is a soldier, a sword of justice, and only that, but in the presence of Dean Winchester, he feels like more.
“Stop. It was never your fault. It was time.”
The beer mug is cool beneath his palm. He raises it to Ellen. “To reunions.”
, there, and it’s not missed. Cas’ expression twitches, though Dean can’t read what’s lying beneath and doesn’t trust himself enough to keep searching. His eyes fall back to the gun in his palm.
Jimmy whispers, followed by another blossom of warmth, and Castiel flies.
If Castiel had thought the return from Hell was rattling, it’s nothing compared to the sudden
In the bunker, lies swell up on Dean’s tongue again, easy and dripping, and he says one, and then another just to prove he can. He’d never really thought about what his life would be like without the lies he clings to, and having been stripped bare, falling back into the shield is heavenly. They can sidestep around the rest as Chuck blathers and preens, proud of himself and the damage Jack’s done somehow, but Cas keeps staring at Dean with that unblinking gaze, and Dean feels just as exposed as he did without his pretenses back in the conference room.
None, his mind whispers. Because he's dead. Dead-dead, this time. No cosmic take-backs. No snap of all-powerful fingers.
The atmosphere sighs, tensing around his shoulders. It's waiting for something; it's waiting for
“Don't think he had a reason to come around, not directly,” she says. The ending hangs open.
Instead, he runs his tongue over his bottom lip to feel the dry, chapped flesh.
He picks at a bit of the wood grain, which has peeled back from a particularly deep notch.
“Right.” That's the truth. Cas is still wearing that trenchcoat, the first one—the one Dean always preferred. But it's still far too many layers for the quiet parts of night. Dean slides off the bed and stands up, reaching for the collar.
“You told me that you’d help,” Dean seethes. “You told me you believed in me, and now you’re gonna let these dicks win? You’re gonna let them destroy everything? Wipe out all of humanity?”
He is no longer himself, and neither is Jimmy. Castiel can almost feel the vessel’s body, but from a distance, a play spread beneath him. The demons have captured Amelia and the Winchesters, and Jimmy Novak is sparking with rage and fear. Castiel moves to reach fingers he no longer has, and his wings beat against his back, propelling him forward.
Jimmy hangs back. There’s a strain between them now, but Castiel doesn’t find it wholly frustrated anymore.
Jimmy turns his head away, nearly fading of his own volition to a place Castiel can no longer find him.
Christ, his whole chest hurts. Remnants of Billie's cataclysmic heart-rending or—
His mother’s death throbs, but it’s the sort of gaping hole Dean was always used to, and skirting around the edges has come naturally since the second grade. He can shut it down, lock it up, and keep the whole thing far away from the task at hand–-or at least he could before Jack had cursed the whole damn world to rattle truths out from between everyone’s teeth.
Castiel has his blade in his right hand, and Dean’s eyes travel down to it. It’s obvious by the widening of his eyes that he understands, but he doesn’t
“This isn't Heaven without you, you know? It's not right. It's not…well. It's not everything I want. Not yet.”
Castiel wrings his hands as he waits, a move too human, too instinctual, to be perceived as anything else, and hopes that his superior does not notice.
He shouldn’t, but he does. He finds Amelia Novak in her sleep and lets her dream of her husband making breakfast in their kitchen. He seeks out Claire Novak, with her blood running as hot as Jimmy’s, body built to house Castiel’s grace, and summons memories of her past, her family, whole and complete.
Dean's never loved anyone so fiercely or hated anyone so vehemently before in his life.
Like the wind. Like the black shadow of his wings once burnt into the dirt. Cas took his love and he fled with it, leaving the gaping wound behind.
“Cas, it's always been you,” Dean says. He's never meant anything more. The admission almost hurts. “You're it for me.”
and him alone, and Dean Winchester is carving tendrils from a weeping life that might have, at one point, been a young woman.
“You said I didn’t know what you meant,” Cas says.
Castiel complies.
His phone vibrates on the floor. Christ, he has so many missed calls. The ringing should reassure him, because Sam's still out there. Sam isn't gone, dead-gone, erased into nothingness—
Unchecked, his wings burst into being across the planes of existence and quake against the walls, defying everything.
He spits out a bone-splintering sob as Sam's hand closes down around his shoulder, anchoring him in place.
Shell-shocked, Castiel raises his hand to stare at the slim fingers and tries to move them one by one, managing only half before his vision, now limited and linear, with a single plane of existence that bucks up as if to meet his face, blurs.
But Cas never answers.
Now, though–this shit isn’t funny anymore. It’s dangerous, and it’s sharp edges, and it’s glaring at him from across the table like Dean’s the one responsible for the mess they’re in. Fuck.
She kisses the sides of his face.
“Don’t.” Dean shakes his head. “Don’t start.”
Dean’s knuckles turn white against the table, just like the bare bleached wall behind him. “Get us out of here and fix this.”
“Well, sometimes, I can’t talk to you!” Dean says. Was that what he meant to say? No, no, that wasn’t what he meant to say; hopeless, his tongue runs along the backside of his teeth. “And I definitely don’t wanna to do it here–-”
Silence falls over the room. Cas stares at him, eyes blue and dark and wide and angry, and Dean’s bristling, but that was true. All of it’s true. Laid before them, it seems stupid, but wading through that’s a bitch.
“Why not?” Cas asks, head tilted in a challenge. “Because there are things you don’t want to say?”
Cas’ gaze finally wavers and pulls away. He hunches over, drooping shoulders spread wider beneath that damn coat, and stares at the blank wall. “I don’t want that like you mean it, Dean.”
He stops a few feet in front of Dean's location. Are there any clues left behind as to what happened, what went down? How the Earth wobbled and spun and fell, never to be righted again? Is there even an Earth left anymore?
There is only a moment before Dean has roughly shoved him away, and the knife goes clattering down to the floor. Castiel is too thrown to reach for it, too surprised to bend down, and then Dean is pushing him again. There is anger there, and frustration, and something concealed by a thread nearly unraveled. Dean corners him against the wall and surges in to grab Castiel’s lapels. His hands are fisted around the material and shaking, trembling, so much so that Castiel can feel the tremors in his chest.
“We were.”
that reverberate through his consciousness. Part of him feels proud that he has been chosen in the garrison sent to retrieve the Righteous Man’s soul, even if he is nothing but a foot soldier in the midst of greater beings, a number paling in comparison next to the blinding goodness of the archangel leading the charge through the gore and carnage, stained red like human blood. Castiel’s brothers and sisters are in front of him and behind him as they carve their way through the misery, and he hears them,
He isn't sure if he's ready to, yet.
Guilt.
He spends the next day with Ellen, with Jo, with Ash. He visits Rufus and Bobby, reminisces with them, jokes about days spent pretending to be FBI agents and digging graves beneath moonlight. It feels good; it feels
