Things were different now though.  Laws were different.  There was no reason he had to do without and make do with wishing now.
for it.  And more than that, he’d put himself into the situation where he needed to beg for it all by himself, and now the consequences were positively going to
Tonight, for reasons that surely made sense to the misfiring neurons somewhere in his lizard brain, Tony was letting the most perfect specimen of manhood he had ever laid eyes on take off his pants.  No, not letting -- Tony was asking him to do it.  Asking this beautiful, funny, sweetly snarky man to reveal all his damage to the light, to look his fill, to
“It was always the plan to put me in front of the public,”  Rogers went on, a glance too quick, and too loaded to be read scraping over Barnes before he fixed his attention back on Fury.  “That’s what you’ve been telling me since I woke up here; the fancy clothes, the history lessons, the business and public speaking coaching;  all that’s really no different from the old USO act, just with fewer chorus girls.  And frankly Colonel, I think we both know that’s a waste of the serum’s potential.”
“I have, over the years, come to suspect that Howard Stark rather preferred it that way,”  Jarvis offered to the tall, dark silhouette beside him.  “He did certainly stir up the hornet’s nest at SHIELD as soon as young Sir had taken himself off on his own, and I have been told that things got rather heated when he did.”
“So,” he said,  smiling when Steve startled upright, “You thinking welding and fabrication, or more like the coding or drafting classes?  I’d suggest auto repair, but that can be hard on the hands, and I like yours the way they are.”
It was a heady rush of lust Tony weathered then, propped over Steve's thigh, tugging long, moist strokes along that beautiful cock when he wanted, so badly wanted to set his teeth to the curve of Steve's hip and bite down hard.  He knew, he just knew that Steve would rise to it, all shock and shivering wonder in his voice as the pain drove his pleasure higher, maybe high enough to break...
"No, it's not like that,"  Steve hurried to declare, blue eyes wide and earnest.  "I'm not stepping out on anybody else, I promise.  Haven't even been on a date since before I shipped out, either, so... it's just... well."  He chewed his lip, brows furrowed in thought.  "Have you ever started to feel like people think you're some kinda property?  Not like you're a slave or anything, but maybe a car, or an heirloom chair; something more valuable than it is useful, you know?"
Tony stretched into the space Steve had yielded, and offered back a grin.  “There you go, ruining our ‘intimate strangers’ paradigm with your curiousity,” he shook his head in theatrical disappointment.  “I’ll give you three questions.”
He traced them reverently between his own for a moment before he raised one hand to his face so he could kiss the palm.  Tony made a hungry noise, rolled toward him, and that was all the encouragement Steve needed to deepen the exploration.  Tony gasped when he tongued at the eye of his palm, groaned when he nibbled gently at the heel on his way to suckle the sweet, thin skin over his wrist.  The other hand threaded back into Steve’s hair, anchoring him to his task in a way he couldn’t help but find soothing.
That won him a glance, sharp and blue over one shoulder, the eyebrow above in a challenging arc.  “About damn time,” he said, drawing up to the garage and turning beside its keypad lock.  “Get us inside, and we’ll talk.”
There came that rustling sound again, and Tony could just picture one of those broad, square hands scrubbing back over Steve’s hair as he sighed.  “I.  I have no idea.  Tony, can I just make sure I understand you here?  You called to yank my ear for showing up at your place uninvited, and because you’re mad at me, you want me to buy you dinner now?”
“Is it,” Tony murmured, keeping his voice absolutely level, and completely respectable, “cool enough yet?”
“It was a hot zone.  State Department and Military CID were already digging the place up looking, and we were already stretched too thin on this side of the Atlantic, as the attack on Carter proved to us.”  Clint was impressed at how Fury could say that without his voice shaking in rage at having been so terribly blindsided.  But that was probably why he was in charge, not Clint.  Well, that and the paperwork too, probably.
But he’d swallowed his pride and asked for help.  Begged for help.  Then been something of a little bitch about taking the help he’d asked for.  And now...
in this man’s bed.  He closed his eyes and sighed in relief as Tony brushed gentle kisses over the lids and murmured, “that’s all I need.”
something I ever want to do again.  Bodycount from a stand up fight is one thing, but this shell game bullshit is bad for my blood pressure!”
No false claims as to devotions of husband or fatherhood there, Jarvis was grimly satisfied to note, just a finely detailed list of Mr. Stark’s many and varied contributions to mankind’s technological ability to destroy itself, engraved on the sides and back of the imposing stone edifice.  No mention anywhere in the list of the son Stark had left behind.  Twice.
And then it was done.  Steve slid his mouth away from Tony’s with a gutted sigh, and collapsed across him, catching his weight on his elbows until Tony dragged him the rest of the way down, and tucked the golden head low under his chin.  “Good,” he huffed, stroking Steve’s sweat-damp, heaving shoulders as his heart began to slow inside him again,  “That’s good.  That’s Perfect.”
Clint took a deep breath, blinking as the data points started to line up in a whole new way.  Over by the desk, he saw Barnes narrow his eyes, clearly thinking just as hard.  Fury just took a breath, laced his fingers together, and regarded Rogers over them.  “Go on...”
"We can wait,"  Steve began, with soft eyes and wry lips.  "I know you said you don't do hook ups until you-" He cut himself off with a grunt when Tony yanked him forward, one knee pressing between Steve's own, so that the denim-trapped bulge of his erection rubbed hard against Tony's thigh.
"Well.  It was a civilian venture, not military.  We weren't there to fight the war, we were there to help people survive it, and we went by civilian transport all the way, so we wouldn't be a target for insurgents, you know?"  He smirked, rubbing a hand on his pants.  "Only it turns out the I was a target anyway.  They had... This outfit called the Ten Rings.  Somehow they got the design specs for my machine.  For the power source.  They wanted me to weaponize it."
“Who is ‘her,’ by the way, and is there some reason she can’t walk on her own?” Clint asked, jogging up the front steps and muscling the big formal doors open.  His hearing aids picked up a muffled grunting that sounded a lot like it wanted to be furious cursing, but was having trouble enunciating around something thick and fluffy stuffed in the curser’s mouth.
Steve chuckled, and let Tony withdraw his hand to get out his keys at the door.  "Well, I'll admit I was curious about that,"  he said, then shrugged at the eyebrow Tony shot him.  "You said you lived upstairs, but I didn't see an elevator when I was inside, just that open central staircase, and..."  he fidgeted under the weight of Tony's stare. "And you obviously manage just fine, but I was just..."
"Hey, no,"  Tony answered, his hold on Steve's hair gentling to a broad palm, a spread of fingers that steered him in close enough to kiss -- one whelming press of lip to lip, tongue to tongue, and then a rain of sweet, quick pecks across Steve's cheeks, his brow, his eyelids.  "No, you're good, you're so much better than good.  You're amazing at that, and I want more, I promise."
"You mind getting my pants and shoes?" he asked, as if it was the easiest, most natural thing in the world to ask for such a basic help.  Steve couldn't help but think with chagrin back to his own fragile youth, and his graceless, prideful stubbornness in the face of any hint of help or charity.
"Well maybe Cap never met an order he wasn't ready to buck," Tony allowed, sliding his grip down the smooth leather of the sleeve until he could snag Steve's broad, square hand,  "But I'm getting a feel for Steve Rogers that tells me he might sometimes like to not have to be the one in command."
“- didn’t really like it either, I could tell,”  Tony finished for him, fiddling with the hem of his shorts to give his hands something to do.  “And the second reason is because the wheelchair tilts the playing field for me.”  Steve gave him a querying look, and Tony sighed.  “People either are more into me than they would have been because of the ‘plucky survivor’ idea, or they feel like they’re doing me some kind of a favor by paying attention to me, or they’re turned off by the idea that I might be breakable.  It kind of sucks no matter which way it rolls.”
, damn him.  And now this -- Nick couldn't even send out teams to search Cap's few favorite haunts, in case one of his agents got made and led Hydra right to the man.  Nick gave up and pinched at the budding headache between his eyebrows.
He froze, skin suddenly taut with horror like a dousing of icy water,  Tony pulled his hips back, fingers still clenched to hold Steve's head still until his cock slipped free, and he dropped to the bed with a gusting sigh and a screech of bedsprings.
In the army hospital in Kabul, the doctors had told Tony that they could do some reconstructive work on his legs -- re-break some of the awkwardly healed spots, install screws and pins to reinforce others -- and that they might possibly, with a year or so of physical therapy, get his legs stabilized enough to let him walk with crutches most of the time.  Maybe.  The State Department had agreed to the treatment -- sort of a ‘sorry about all that torture, let’s make nice now and who needs lawyers’ package deal, but Tony had only wanted to know one thing at the time.
Cheers to all my along-the-road cheerleaders.  I value each of you beyond rubies, and if you'd like to come and hang out with my multishipping, multifanfom, semipolitical semiaesthetic semifashionista mongrel of a blog on
“So do I get to ask you questions now?”  Steve asked after awhile, sitting up and righting his hair again with maddening ease.
Huh.  Bambi?  Since when was Rogers on a first name basis with the fearsome shadow-dictator/admin assistant over at SI?  Last Clint had known, Arbogast didn’t let anyone from the White Star end of things get cosy with her.  Rogers was turning out to be an intriguing exception all around.
He tugged Steve into a nice, easy rhythm, and twisted back to reach the box he kept in the headboard.  Lube in a lotion bottle (never let anyone say being able to get at your lube one-handed wasn’t an important feature!) and a sleeve of condoms that Tony could only hope were still within range of their expiration date.  Steve didn’t have the right angle now for his earlier trick of seamlessly deep-throating Tony, but he was still giving it a solid try, and the occasional, violent flutter of Steve’s throat muscles fighting off a gag reflex was just about as distracting.
"Since...?"  Tony felt Steve brush a tentative hand up along the side-brace of his exosuit, and he nodded, grateful now for his earlier, annoyed confession.  It meant he didn't need those words now.
Tony’s smile was a warmly indulgent thing as he eased himself down onto the bed again.  “When it’s gonna rain, yeah,” he said, leaning to reach a sort of keypad tucked inside a hidden curve of the walker’s frame.  His fingers set up a quick and furtive rhythm, and the chair began to move again, folding, sliding, shifting and rearranging itself down into the bulky, two wheeled shape Steve had first seen.  Then it backed up, pivoted neatly, and rolled itself along to what looked like a kind of charging station by the bathroom.
Steve held still for it, the skin of his wrist so smooth and hot under Tony's fingers, that it was a trial make himself let go while he still had some cool to bargain with.  The way Steve slid his hand out from under Tony's when he was done though -- slowly, gently enough to let the fingers drag and almost, almost tangle together on their way past -- that suggested that maybe Tony was doing better than he'd thought.  "Carbonell?"  Steve asked squinting at Tony's handwriting in the gloom.
“Hmmmnh,” Steve agreed, eyes falling closed as Tony pressed his cock inward along the strong curve of his tongue, until the press of his throat fluttered around the head, and good god, but that was a pretty sight.  Tony let himself enjoy it for a long moment, and the rhythmic press-pull of tongue and suction as Steve held still and suckled at him, and hell yes, it was tempting -- the idea of spilling himself down that warm, eager throat.  But long dry spell or not, Tony wasn’t a teenager any more, and it would be a damn shame to lose out on the rest of Tony’s brand new and specifically Steve-related wish list.
“I let her corner me,”  Rogers shrugged back, a satisfied smile tickling the corner of his mouth as he balanced the back of her barstool in one big hand.  “But if she’s that slippery, maybe we’d better secure her someplace more-”
“Hmmn mm,”  Steve responded eagerly, shifting to get his right hand up to Tony’s belly without letting go of the prick in his mouth.  When Tony pumped a few good squirts across those fingers -- and what nice, thick fingers they were, too -- Steve immediately smeared them together, and hiked his ass up off the bed, reaching back as he spread his knees wide.
Tony’s cock lurched unhelpfully in his shorts again, even as his brain cursed him for putting himself into this (delicious) torture.  He wouldn’t say it.  He wouldn’t!  It was too much!
“Don’t thank me yet.  There’ll still be questions and rumors.  Stane’s kid will probably keep digging, and,” here he cut a canny, searching glance Jarvis’ way, “Army CID might not have made a big deal of the staggeringly high amount of morphine in Stane’s blood samples, but a Stateside judge might feel differently.”
“Better,” Steve allowed, sparing him exactly one glance, and exactly half a smile, and yep, right on cue, Tony’s cock started suggesting that maybe things weren’t so bad after all.  “Core muscles,” the golden haired sadist then reminded him as that damned pencil resumed scratching.  “Using your back instead of your core’s why you keep falling off the rope in Gym class.  Tighten up your belly, tuck your hips forward, and it’ll hurt less.”
.”  Then he ducked out the door, neatly evading her grab for his bagel, and not even feeling bad about it -- he’d seen two pumpernickels in the bag, after all, so she wouldn’t even have to share hers with Barnes.
He pressed a heated, sucking kiss to the spot instead, wrung a long groan from the root of Steve's cock, and licked the salt from his lips to whisper,  "What do you want, Steve?"
“We’re a private company, not the US Army.  You won’t have the weight of the Government behind you if you screw up.”
Definitely too conspicuous to go missing without comment then.  Phil huffed a sigh.  “And the transmitter?”  Barnes just smirked, and held up a spent Widow’s Sting between two gleaming metal fingers.  Which made Phil sigh again, imagining what Johnson would say about her ruined and abandoned tech.  “And the books?”
Well, we're flying without a net now, death-dumplings!  We've just run through the 'already done and waiting to be posted' bits of story.  Which means, if I get the next scene done tomorrow, that's when you'll get it, and if I don't, you'll just have to console yourselves with another viewing of Captain America 3: Civil War.
"Shh."  Tony curled his fingers tighter, not letting anything slide away, and not for a moment asking himself why keeping this literal stranger beside him was suddenly so important.  "It's fine.  Doesn't have to be like that at all, if that isn't what you want."  Tony cut a look upward, at the chiseled jaw and bright-flushed cheeks.  "I'm just saying it could be, if you do want."
Barton whipped the hand in question under the table, and scowled.  Nick turned his head to glare the analyst back to her own business.
“And even if he is really dead and gone, we still don’t know if he acted alone,”  Tony answered, too gentle for her rising temper.  “We don’t know if he was the mastermind, or somebody’s catspaw, but either way, putting my foot into Stark Industries now...” he shook his head.  “I don’t wanna make guns, Pep.”
“So when my friend was in here,”  Phil asked as the man set the drink down, “did he leave with anybody?”
He'd show up at the White Eagle around 9:30 or 10:00, slipping quietly in as the last of the Corporate Happy Hour Slummers were staggering off to make their way back uptown now that they'd had their fill of risky for the night.  First glance, he fit right in with them; hot, white, and rich -- money in every line of him, from the perfect tailoring of his bespoke suits, to the 'hours-of-workout-every-day' body he fit into them.  Even the cut of his corn-gold hair was expensive -- the kind that a man could ignore, or abuse, and still look photo-spread ready with five minutes, a little water, and a comb.  Tony knew better than most of the White Eagle's regulars what kind of money it took to get results as reliable as those.  But Mr. Thursday Night's wore his gorgeous like he didn't notice it, and his money like it itched, and he never once tarried with the other Suits as they crossed paths in the taproom.
Here was a kid just as lost, just as lonely as him, a kid who felt that hiding in public was better than being safe at home, wherever home was, and it wasn’t right that they should reveal each other like this and still feel so helplessly alone.  It wasn’t right.  It wasn’t what Tony wanted this to be.
Steve carefully backed out of the transformer box, and put on his very best simple-but-pretty face as he turned.  It was the shopgirl behind the gun, the rising sun playing warm light and harsh shadows across her dark skin and hair, gilding fire along her silk flowered dress.  She was holding his right shoe in her free hand, waggling it back and forth like a lure, so Steve let himself smile and take a step forward.  “Yeah,” he said, as if the gun wasn’t making his heart thunder for a fight,  “Thanks.  I’da hated to have to break up the set-”
“Yeah, really,” Tony agreed, spreading his thighs as wide as he could, and cocking his good knee up to make room.  “You’re gonna do the heavy lifting tonight, big boy.  If you think you can handle it, that is.”  And oh yeah, that was the face of a man who never met a dare he didn’t take.  Steve made his answer with action however, and it was Tony who hissed in a breath at the sudden, firm swipe of a wet finger across his entrance, and oh fuck yeah -- not shy at all.
Barton and Romanoff were in the break room when Nick Fury arrived at White Star Securities' Manhattan office: a half-full carafe from the coffeemaker, the scattered contents of a first aid kit, a bag of frozen peas, and two forks in an empty pie plate on the table between them.  Both looked up briefly when he strode in, then went back to the business of bandaging Barton's bloody right thumb.
“Now I can’t order you to put your faith in Captain America if you haven’t got it to give, but I can and will ask you to dig deep and find a little bit for the ones who recruited you to White Star’s cause in the first place.”
Steve bit his lip when Tony’s thumb moved off of it, considering for a long moment.  “It didn’t seem like you wanted me,” he answered at last.
"Because of who you're hiding from?"  Tony asked, and wasn't it interesting how the sightlines Steve immediately checked when reminded of the evasion weren't the lateral ones -- up the street or down, doorways or cars, but more aimed at the rooftops and balconies along the converted tenements that made up Jay street.
Steve heard the past tense in that sentence, heard the weight of loss behind it, and he wondered just for a second, how far the gulf between Tony and his friend had grown.  There were so, so many ways to lose a friend, after all, and Steve knew some of them were more absolute than others.  It didn't take death, or even a world of distance to feel loss like a rotten tooth when the voice that meant home to you spoke in a stranger's tones, suspicious and terse when chance crossed your paths in the house you shared with him and his friends, in the future you never asked to see...
“You know this was the last place I actually saw Tony face to face, right?”  James asked as he left the path and crossed to meet Jarvis at Maria’s stone, as polished and precise in his civilian clothes as in any officer’s uniform, but this had pretty much always been the case with James Rhodes.  Jarvis had briefly, futilely wished that the trait would wear off on Tony, but of course it never had.  “Right over there, under that hydrangea.”  He pointed to a tall bush beside an empty fountain, and Jarvis returned a nod.
Tony cut him off, ducking low to kiss his nose fondly.  "No, sweetheart, your real name.  I just..."  He laughed again, and sat back at last, freeing his hands to begin undoing the straps that held the bulky walking chair to him. "I can't sit here calling you Steve Rogers in my head while you're sucking my cock," he said, stealing a wry glance.  "I just... it feels too much like I'm thirteen years old, and terrified my Dad's gonna come in and find me masturbating over his comic collection again, and... I just..."
Tony chuckled, and sucked the last of the alcohol from the ice left in his glass.  "Well that's because I'm not, really.  But I grew up with one, and there's only so many times you can hear a dead guy's life history before some of it starts to stick.  Hey, you drink whiskey, right?"
Tony had never been tall, but now he’d be looking up to everyone, yes, even Justin fucking Hammer.  He’d never taken dancing very seriously, but now even hump-grinding on a crowded dance floor was off the menu.  He’d scorned athletics as a waste of his time for years, but now athletics would scorn him.  He’d never walk somebody down the aisle now, even for a joke.  He’d never get to follow through on that threat he’d once made, to dance on his old man’s grave...
“Ugh,” the bundle of blankets groaned, levering itself up so Clint could glare at both of them, tucking one hearing aid in as he huddled and scowled.  “It is way too early for these Russian Dramatics.  You,” and here, he pointed one callused finger at James, “Take it easy on Tasha.  She’s not used to having nice things.  And you,” the finger moved to target Natasha, “Quit acting like James is something we stole.  If he was gonna dump us for Rogers, he’d have done that months ago.”
“Shhh, honey,” Tony grinned at the anxious wrinkle between Steve’s eyebrows.  “Shh.  I’m going to tell you yes.”  The eyebrows raised, wrinkle banished, but Tony pressed again to stall whatever he was going to say.  “Not because you’ve convinced me of the purity of your intentions or anything though.  I’m going to tell you yes, because I can already tell how stubborn you are, and I’m pretty sure if I tell you no, you’ll just find a way to dump money on me from a third hand or fourth hand source.  Am I right?”  Only then did he lift his hand away.
“Yeah,” Steve sighed, reaching for Tony’s hand.  Tony steeled himself to pity at that, but the look he got when he met Steve’s eye instead was simmering with a deep, banked anger that strangely made it easier to let his own annoyance slide.
“Hey,” he snared Steve’s attention just as he yanked his jeans down, and for a moment, when Steve’s cock sprang free, Tony completely lost the plot, because Holy Chrome, but it had been a long time since he'd literally had his mouth water for a nice prick.
‘Today’, in fact, was only about an hour and a half old by the time Phil found a parking space to put Lola in.  He unclipped his seat belt, and with his hand on the keys, paused.  “You can stay with the car if you’d like,” he offered to the statue in his passenger seat.  “I don’t expect this will take long...”  The offer was genuine -- it really wasn’t a great neighborhood to be leaving a car like Lola unattended.  But Barnes’ lip curled into a silent snarl at the supposed challenge to his courage all the same, and he unfastened his belt with a furious snap, and was out of the car before Phil even got the keys out of the ignition.
Okay, it was cheap, but at least it made Rogers laugh.  And it made Natasha freeze, her eyes narrowing as she took in the captive’s face, furious and defiant, and then scared when the satisfied smile spread across the Widow’s face.
Tony had always despised smalltalk, from as early as he could remember his mother trying to drill it into his head for her big fancy dinners.  When he'd struck out on his own after her death, Tony had gleefully refused to attend any event that might require him to fill it up with that kind of  polite and cheerful verbal diarrhea.  But that didn't mean he couldn't see Steve's skill at it.  He complimented with his eyes, and smiled as if for a camera, and his idle chatter was just as impeccable and hollow as it had been back in those first few nights when the man had shown up to turn every head in the White Eagle.
Boneless and quivering against Steve’s chest, Tony couldn’t help whining. “Couldn’t I please just have another spanking instead?”
,” he said.  “So you need to figure out how to let me lead from the front.  There’s too much at stake right now to have the two of us at odds over this.”
“Isn’t gonna do anybody any good now that Stark Industries has the patents on it,” he cut back.  Then he sighed and rubbed at his cheek with grubby fingers.  “Look, Pep, I know you want things to go back to the way they were before,” and there was a hitch in his voice there, a moment of careful word choosing that made Pepper’s heart twist inside her.
The barkeep sighed, and braced one fist on his hip.  “Honey, you’re gonna have to buy more than a coupla drinks if you’re shopping for that kind of gossip”
“Hand,”  Tony gasped, tugging Steve up short on a downstroke, and waggling the lube bottle in answer to his confused glance.
"Well. You're of age now though, right?" Steve tried for ‘gently ribbing’ in his tone, but from the softness that question brought to Tony's warm eyes, he guessed he'd fallen somewhere short of it.
“No.”  He withdrew his hand gently, but with a finality that made Pepper just want to grind her teeth.  “I don’t want to wrap my life around the company that killed my father.”
"You know what?  It's fine,"  Steve said, letting annoyance shave a hard Brooklyn edge onto his voice.  "I'll just find him next time we're both at the club."
ANYway!  To all those taking the time out of their weekend to read and comment -- THANK YOU!  You're what keeps me at the keyboard!
“It’s fine, Tony,”  Steve answered after a silent moment of staring at their hands.  Then he licked his lips and turned his wrist to bring their palms together on the table.  “I’m fine, I promise.  It’s just... one moment we’re all alive and doing okay, and just a year later... well, there’s only two of us now.”  He stared at the scarred table, and a crease dug deep between his brows.  “And James... some days I wonder how much of himself he still has left after... after his capture.”
The flinch Steve gave when reminded of the practicalities was strong enough Tony could feel it all the way down.  “I... it was while I was deployed,” he replied immediately, blue eyes too earnest to doubt.  “but like I said, I haven’t been with anyone since then, so...”
Tony rolled his eyes.  “No, last week.  Of course right now!  It sounds like a bank vault full of monkeys and washing machines over there.  Is that dubstep I hear?”
“It wasn’t,”  Barnes said after a long silence.  “He didn’t come here because of that.”  The word ‘that’ came along with a telling nod toward the two women chatting with the doorman.  Barnes picked up the full shotglass in his gloved left hand, held it up and peered through it like a kind of lens.  “Place like this, the bouncer at the door looks at you.  Talks to you.  Flirts.”  He tossed back the drink and poured another.  “Remembers you.  Not even I could could follow him in here without him knowing about it.”
“You have something you need to say?” It was no invitation Daisy would’ve ever taken, but she guessed Hill knew her way around the Acting Director’s minefields after all the time they’d worked together.
It was strange how Steve's hand didn't pull away from his, didn't flex, or grip, or flinch or stiffen at all, but somehow the comfortable intimacy of the contact was gone, leaving only something awkward and alarmed in its place.
Tony glanced over to the breakfast bar and grinned.  “That’s just Dum-E’s idea of home security, I think,” he said, watching the helper bot wave his manipulator arm.  “He’ll stop once you’ve been properly introduced.  Probably.”
“I didn’t say it was your fault,”  Barnes glowered, stalking forward.  “I’m gonna blame you anyways.”
, but the words, when he found them, were far more neutral.  “Before we lost ARC, but it’s just not gonna happen.  We haven’t got the resources to try and take Stark Industries to the mat over those patents, and we’re kinda way too late to be resisting the takeover at this point.”
“Uh...”  Clint dithered, completely unprepared for this turn of events.  “Maybe you better page James, okay?  Or Fury maybe.  Or... y’know, maybe everyone.”
"Well, I've heard those things can be traced, you know," he bullshitted with a big grin, as if he knew Tony wouldn't be buying, but intended to shovel it anyway.  "I don't want uh, Hydra to use it to find me while I'm here with you."
In the darkness of the locked up clothing shop, Steve took care of a bit of housekeeping; set the  computer to deleting everything but the operating systems, and downloading the online phone book that nice barista had shown him on Sunday morning.  He figured that ought to do for the security footage, assuming she hadn’t already sent it to anybody.  This girl didn’t strike him as the type who’d settle for a picture of a catch if she stood a chance at the real thing though, so he’d just have to hope for the best.
Steve looked away with a wry twist of a smile, and Tony peered at him, wondered if the pink on his face and ears was maybe more pleasure than embarrassment now.  “You like that, don’t you?” he ventured.  “The pet names?”
him into a symbol instead, and he had to go AWOL, commit mutiny, and rescue 359 men before anybody took that symbol seriously."
But then when he’d asked to see Steve, instead of pride or lust, Tony watched those blue eyes fill with chagrin, worry, and a baffling sort of regret.  Then Steve had stripped, as quickly and efficiently as a soldier with two minutes to get through his shower; nothing enticing about it, nothing drawn out or coy, nothing done for show.   He looked perfect, gorgeous, and fully as miserable about it as Tony had felt, and all of a sudden Tony had found that he
“A mistress or girlfriend, you’d have reported so we could run a security check on her,” he went on as the couple headed for the exit,  “But a gay bar with a kinky club in the basement?  I figured you’d probably just look into it on your own, so that nobody else would have to know he was coming here.”  He snagged the bottle and glass and poured one out.  The vodka smelled primal and terrifying, like prairie wildflowers hiding a sabre toothed cat.  He sniffed it again, and put the shotglass down.
Tony kept that thought, and the hysterical laughter that went with it to himself though.  Twenty questions wasn't nearly enough to scratch the surface of all the rest, either.
"Aw, don't be like that, saucepot,"  Tony said, dumping the keys into his pocket and wheeling himself over to the stairs; a rising bulwark of concrete and steel under linoleum, flanked along the inside by incongruously ornate wrought iron and walnut balustrades.  "I still haven't shown you my chair's second-best trick."
Rogers’ smile only deepened.  “Then I guess you’d better not treat me like a weapon and only pull me out when you want to point me at someone,” he came back sharply, then let his smirk fade into a heavy earnestness that looked bulletproof.  “I’m not a figurehead, I’m a
“Last call’s in half an hour, honey,”  the bouncer smirked, waggling a rubber stamp between thumb and forefinger like a cigar.  “But Downstairs serves till four.  Private club.”
"Those ones too,"  Tony agreed.  "So what; you running away from home and telling Dad to piss up a rope?"
“I think you don’t much want to shoot me at all, ma’am, or you’da done it before you spoke up,” he answered her straight.  “Which means you’ve got it figured that I’m more valuable to you alive.”
In which is debated red versus black, losses against gains, and the merits of a bohemian steampunk ideal.
“So... So about this time the goat’s had enough...”  Steve soldiered on at last.  “Bites the hell outta Tim’s hand, knocks the pub table right over onto Pinky and Jimmy, and kicks the old man right in the goolies.  Then it’s up the stairs and headed for the street, and Jones... Jones just... opens the damn gate and lets it go!”  He wiped at his eyes with his knuckle, still grinning.  “Far’s I know nobody ever caught the mean old thing either.  I wound up paying half my packet for the month just so the old guy’s sons wouldn’t go for the Shore Police, and to this day, I have
Tony closed his eyes and shivered.  “Only if you get up here and kiss me with that filthy mouth once you’re inside,” he declared.  Then he gulped out a long, quavering moan as Steve bent low, hitched Tony’s thighs up over his own, and pressed that glorious cock into Tony’s body at last.   First the head, a sudden stretch, and then the long, heavy glide; muscles yielding to the thick press, fullness and heat stealing Tony’s breath away until finally they were pressed together, balls to balls, and Steve’s lips were on his own again.
“Have Klein get whatever you need, and work with Delta team for logistics,”  Fury threw back as he headed for the stairs, either not seeing, or else ignoring the glare Barnes whipped in his direction.
“Well it does make sense,”  Natalia sighed, shoving Clint over mercilessly when he tried to fight her for the covers.  “May had some eyes-only paperwork for him to sigh earlier that morning, so he did spend some time over at the SI den yesterday afternoon.”
Happiness? Well maybe it was, at that, but it could just be the long-forgotten taste of freedom on his tongue too.
She shrugged.  “Who bothers asking these days?  They’re pretty much the same.  Now,” she said, sobering, “you lead the way to the stairs.  Slow and easy, mind you.  I’d rather put a couple of rounds through your gut than bother with chasing you in these shoes, so remember that if you’re tempted to get clever.”
Rogers flipped the folder open then, spun it in place, and shoved it to Fury’s side of the desk.  “No he didn’t.  If he’d thought his son was dead, the will wouldn’t have given three years to show up and claim the whole kit and kabootle, pending a psychiatry exam and a DNA test.”  He leaned his elbows on the cluttered blotter, and pinned them all, one by one, with a piercing blue stare.  “Howard thought his son was
The light came on automatically as they entered, revealing a bedroom exactly suited to the living space outside it -- bed unmade, laundry flung against one wall, books and papers piled everywhere that would hold them, and a series of paths just wide enough to roll the chair throughout it all.  Further detail he didn't bother with, because the feeling of Tony's mouth moving under his, the scratch of his trim little beard against Steve's chin, the firm swell of hip flexing against his knuckles was far more relevant than any analysis of Tony's housekeeping skills.
“Yeah.  Stane’s armored SUV was recovered from an insurgent encampment by a troop of Marines last month,” he said, watching Jarvis so closely he could not have missed his involuntary flinch at the news.  “In Panjshir.”
“Well, he would be a lamp if he was brighter,” Tony said fondly.  “As it is, he’s just a charming quirk of artificial intelligence, so long as you’re willing to define ‘intelligence’ loosely.”  He gave a nod to U, who was dutifully illuminating Steve’s reading material without any menacing behavior.  “His brother seems to think you’re okay, if that makes you feel better.”
It was a shield, Tony realized, watching Steve pay the bill in cash -- a thing he hadn’t often seen back when he'd had more money than he could care about, but saw all the time now that he lived around people who worried about money all the time.  The courtesy, and charm, even those cardboard smiles that almost,
“The Hydra rumors,”  James agreed, darkly.  “We got whispers of all that overseas, but conspiracy theories from home are just downtime entertainment when you’ve got a war to fight.”  Then he tugged the pockets of his jacket down, a restless, frustrated move that sounded bigger than it was in the gloom.  “Until they aren’t.”
And no, that hangdog note in the man’s voice did not make Tony’s flinty heart suddenly turn to goo.  Not at all.  Especially since he knew damned good and well how protective Jarvis could be ever since Afghanistan, and there was a good likelihood that he might not have given Tony Steve’s number for several days.  Or longer, if the ‘Old Friends’ Tony wasn’t supposed to know Jarvis still kept up with from his Loyal Stark Employee days had trouble digging up a profile that looked kosher to the wary old bulldog.
In a way, Tony came to realize, the chaos of his preferred seat seemed to calm the man as he sat there, week after week, nursed his drinks, and watched the slumming Suits gradually get outnumbered by the Twinks, Bears, Queens and Daddies who ruled this roost by night.  And there he'd stay until last call; happily watching the people around him as if he himself were somehow invisible, and not the total focus of every horny queer in the place. with his blue eyes, his impossibly wide shoulders, chiseled jaw, and plush lips that looked built for sucking cock.  He spent more time cheerfully scraping men and boys off his lap than any other club favorite Tony had ever seen come through the Eagle -- and Tony had started coming here when he'd left home after his mom's funeral in '91, so he'd seen a lot of darlings rise and fall from the White Eagle's favor.
He left the tiara behind on the table, figuring his odds of winning it fairly by next Thursday were looking pretty good.
He slipped from the bed, taking care to tuck the blankets down around Clint first, lest the draught of chill wake him.  Natalia did not turn as he padded near, but a moment after he stopped, she pressed away the last few milimetres of empty air between her back and his chest.  He did not put his arms around her though, did not tempt the restless ghost of half remembered training sessions and other, sweatier moments stolen from the silence, and punished brutally upon discovery.  That would never be comforting between the likes of them, the Widow and the Soldier, again.
It had been a year and a half since Tony had gotten laid, that much was true, but it had been far longer than that since he'd been with a sub or a lover as eager and responsive to his every touch as Steve was.  He drank in Tony's touches hungrily, gasped and arched and left no doubt whenever Tony's hands, teeth, or tongue found a new sensitive spot, or when he just lingered at a known one, and worried at it till it glowed with heat.
Which, when you put it that way... still sounded about right.  The only other thing Tony had intended to do with the evening was to go over the latest Extremis data to see if he could help Maya out with her little exploding posy problem, and frankly that was a cold second to the idea of seeing Mr. Thursday Night sweating and flushing over a big bowl of tom yum goong.   “Gold star to Captain America,”  Tony grinned.  “How far out are you?”
“Yeah, well make sure you don’t lose your wallet before you get that ass of yours back down here to Jay street,”  Tony laughed.  “I’m starving, and my favorite Thai place is just down the block.  If you hurry, we can beat the dinner rush.”
Steve did as she asked, mostly.  As his path took him by the streetside facade of the building, he hesitated, peering down.  “Huh...”
Steve caught Tony’s hand and brought it back to his lips for a kiss.  “Perfectly,” he said.  “You don’t need money anyhow.  Not with Captain America on Blue Velvet hanging over there to watch every single thing you do.”
Tony breathed a shiver and let his eyes slip closed.  “Jesus, Steve, if you’re trying to get me up for round two, I’m game, but it’s gonna have to be quick.  Jarvis never lets me sleep in on weekdays.”  Steve dropped Tony’s hand at once, but Tony grabbed for it before he could retreat.  “Kidding, sweetheart, he laughed.  “I know your motives are pure.”
Steve laughed at that.  "Nothing so simple, I'm afraid.  More like I'm AWOL and keeping a look out in case I need to take off and lead the MP's away from you."
And yes.  Yes, they'd known that, dammit.  Damn near the entirety of White Star's legal department, and half of logistics had been working on how to make their recently rescued, and not nearly so dead as he was presumed, war hero into an actual, legal entity, capable of representing White Star to the world now that Margaret Carter couldn't do it anymore.  It didn't help that Howard, in true mad genius fashion, had filed a last minute will with his lawyers just before shit got hot with SHIELD and HYDRA, naming Steve Goddamned Rogers as his sole heir now that his own son was dead.  So they couldn't even change Cap's damned name without losing White Star's entire funding base to the inevitable squabble of second cousins and lost bastards!
“It wasn’t like I was trying to change your mind or anything,” Steve went on.  “Even aside from how I’m crap at talking to people I like, there’s about a hundred good reasons why I shouldn’t be doing anything like this at all,” he waved vaguely at the two of them, the bedroom, the robots, “but what I really wanted that night was to talk to someone who wasn’t trying to get into my pants for once.”
"Jesus, Steve!"  Tony gripped his hair tight now, tugging, warning, so Steve shifted for a better angle, fixed his grip on Tony's hips and shoved in close, tongue pressed up to strafe the underside, throat open to accept the weighty thrust as he pressed his nose to Tony's belly and- "Steve, stop!"
are a seasoned field agent, sir.  You’re a spy.  We all are.  And what we’re doing here, the war we’re fighting is a cold one, not like the one he remembers.  There’s precious little room in this game for Grunts.”
“Yasha,” she started, turning, reaching.  She stopped when he put his metal hand up, palm first between them.
Tony turned back to him, still grinning.  "Hey now, don't harsh," he chided.  "I'll have you know I paid good money for that in Vegas!  Like... twenty bucks, at least."  Steve snickered, as he was pretty sure he'd been meant to do, and deflected the poke Tony aimed at his ribs.  "Besides -- Captain America on Blue Velvet has been good luck for me since College."
“Nope.  This city’s full of rich, white pretty boys like you,” she said, the shoe dangling from her fingers now, as if she might accidentally drop it.  “I mean you’re cute enough, but not in any way I particularly like.  I’d have forgotten all about you, only there’s motion activated cameras over there,” she pointed with the shoe at the corner of the roof, “and there,” another point toward the stair access, “and they stream the footage straight to my computer.  So imagine my surprise to see you breaking the lock on that transformer, and stripping down to your altogether right here on my roof.”  She shook her head and made a tsking noise.
“Admit it now,” Tony pressed, leering as he tried for another snap, “You just want to see me in the Tiara.”
This guy though, he was smooth.  Gracious to everyone, with a wide, camera-ready smile that never got into his eyes for long; a good tipper, a better listener, and just shy enough to blush a charming pink whenever he got a little flustered.  (That quickly became a competitive sport among the twinks, and Tony didn't even pretend not to be as entertained as all the rest.)  Best of all though, Mr. Thursday Night never went home with anybody, and never let anyone, no matter how insistent or charming, lure him out onto the dance floor, or into a booth, or into the makeout corner.
“It’s Steve,” the man answered, not looking up from the folder he had splayed across the desk blotter.
When the walker nudged up against the bed, Steve halted, dropped to his knees and thumbed open the button of Tony's flies.  The walker offered just enough room between the bracing around Tony's ribs and the hinged struts over the hips for Steve to yank Tony's pants and underwear down around his thighs.  Not far, but just enough to let Tony's hard cock spring free and slap up against his bare stomach, and this... oh yes, this, Steve could do.
The most obvious damage was the left knee, back-thrust, a little sideways under Tony’s weight, and knotted thickly above and below with scars.  It was all too easy to imagine bone  shards punched through that pale skin, and months of bad healing to set that awkward angle up to last a lifetime afterward.  Steve wanted, for a shaky moment, to kiss that poor, abused knee, but that far this indulgence surely could not stretch.  Instead, he lifted his hands to settle gently on Tony's ribs, and looked to the other leg.
And with that, he stooped below the bar, rattled around for a second, and came up with a shotglass, and an unlabeled bottle that steamed an icy breath into the club’s sultry darkness.  He plopped both in front of Barnes, and turned a wolfish grin to Phil.  “Don’t give him too much of that before you take him Downstairs and beat the aggro out of him -- This vodka makes ‘em mean.”
And there went Rogers’ Gosh-Who-Me smile again as he tapped at a corner of the desk blotter.  “Because Howard wrote this reporter’s name and her number right here about two weeks before he died,”  he said.  “His handwriting’s pretty shaky, but I can make out ‘ask re Afghanistan.’  So I figure it had something to do with his son’s kidnapping.  I want to know what they talked about.”
Hill cursed again, staring at the ceiling as if praying for strength.  Fury, though, gave Daisy a searching glance, and scooted her tablet a little bit closer to her on the desk.  “Can you get me the shop’s transaction records for the past three days?” he asked.
"Three months,"  Tony said, the words feeling something like relief as they escaped him.  "Then the prototype blew the whole cave system to rubble.  Killed everyone inside it but me, and one other doctor they'd kidnapped.  A trauma surgeon who'd specialized in cardiac..." he flinched away a sudden flash of Yinsen's face; battered, dusty, smiling.  Dying.
“No,” Steve protested, deflecting Tony’s attempt to fuck with his hair again.  “I mean I knew you better than that.”
Neddy at the front door had even tried to pre-stamp his hand once, just as a favor to humanity, because apparently mankind
Nick felt the muscles under his good eye twitch as Natasha picked up the frozen peas and held them to the bruise swelling her left cheek.
, but only barely.  “If he wanted more than that, more than what both of you have, then he could not have it.”
Fury answered with one just like it.  “And I say he’s worth it.  Maybe it doesn’t seem like it now, but let him get his bearings, and he’ll be the best asset we’ve ever had.”
It really was dreadful.  The texture of the cloth made the painted costume look like some hairy kind of carpeting, and the velvet's brilliant hue made the pale skin tones look like the man was half dead.  Steve could only imagine the outrage the designer of his original USO poster would have felt at seeing his work reproduced this way.
' look over the lip of his glass, and Steve glanced up long enough to catch it.  "I mean I don't have it with me,"  he clarified.  "And it's a new one, so I don't have the number memorized yet."
Rogers put on the kind of face that Clint interpreted as ‘Aw, debriefing...’ but he nodded anyway, and bent to drop the will back into the file cabinet he’d jimmied earlier.  “I’ll have Ms. Arbogast call your office to set up the meeting, shall I?”
Steve looked down, ears pink.  “I can’t... um.  I can’t do that.  Go with people I’ve only just met, and just...” he waved a hand vaguely toward the bedroom before using it to fix his hair again.  Then he gave a sulky little glower when Tony laughed.
Steve stopped, one leg hovering as he followed that soft word to Tony’s face.  His generous mouth quirked down a bit, those wide blue eyes fixed on Steve’s face with what could be concern, but could also be doubt.  He swallowed.  “What?”
And he never, not even once, turned up at the speakeasy entrance and asked to be allowed Downstairs.
Tony’s stare never wavered from Steve’s face though, and the look in his eyes now that Steve stood, bared and blushing before him, was one of rapt appreciation.  “You’re so beautiful,” he breathed, without a single glance at Steve’s body.
"I'm afraid Mr. Carbonell will be quite busy today, sir," the man deflected so smoothly Steve just knew he had years of practice at it.  "There's a luncheon meeting with the Centre's accountant, and in the afternoon, Mr. Carbonell teaches the drafting and robotics classes.  Very popular, you understand.  Perhaps if you'd like to leave your name and number, I could have him ring you once he's free?"
“Well, Lieutennant Colonel Rhodes,” Jarvis said, pushing off the stone, “see that you do not accidentally or with deliberate intent sell my charge into indentured servitude with enemies of the free world, and I shall have no cause to wish you ill at all.”
he found it when Steve Captain Of The Wrestling Team Rogers stopped being polite and went over all growly, possessive and dangerous.
I realize this one's short, Murderblossoms.  I'll make up for it with another chapter tomorrow.  In the meantime, enjoy!  And thanks in advance to those of you who pause to comment -- you give me LIFE!
"College, huh?" Steve deflected another poke at his ribs, but didn't move out of range.  "See now I'm picturing that hanging over your bed, watching you make time with- Oof!"  Tony's fingers were pointier than expected, and Steve hadn't realized he'd be ticklish there.
Phil heard Barnes’ arm whir against the sleeve of his tac suit, and rushed to intervene.  “No need, I promise,” he said, picking up his glass. “We’re not here to make trouble for anybody, and we’ll go in a minute.”
“So, out of curiosity,” Steve said to her as he bound her hands with his tie, and knotted his dress socks together to form a gag, “Do they still honor citizen’s arrest these days?  Not that I’m going to let you run off and tattle on me either way, it’s just I figure my lawyer will probably want a bit of heads-up for whether he’s gonna charge you with attempted kidnapping, or prepare a defense for me on actual kidna-”
Phil allowed a smile, trying for resigned instead of triumphant.  “I thought places like this ran on gossip and SoCo.”
Steve hummed a sigh then, snuggled his head down against Tony’s chest, and clung like he wanted to belong nowhere else, and Tony decided that the practicalities of clean up and condom disposal could wait a bit.  This moment here, cooling and sticky, and panting and perfect while the blood sang, and the air calmed between them, felt more important by far.
"Pretty sure it doesn't work like that," Steve chuckled, figuring basic telemetry couldn't have changed all that much since he and Morita had used radio signals to locate Hydra bases in the Austrian hills.  The kiss, however, he allowed; damp and spicy and bristly with beard, and just like that, the fight in his head dwindled to distant, meaningless static.  This
“He’d been dead inside for years when that happened,” he said with a sad shake of his head.  “Look, just give me this for now, Pepper, okay?”  A sweep of his hand took in the tiny, rumpled office, crammed with books and tools and crazy ideas Tony would never stop turning out.  “Give me my crappy little steampunk bohemian ideal for a year or two.  I might go back to the Corporate Jungle one day, sure, but for right now I think I’ve earned a break.”  And here, he flashed her a wry, sad smile that broke Pepper’s building rage and her heart into tiny splinters.  “Just give me some time to get my feet under me first, okay?”
“I’ll go,” he said, clipped and short.  “I’ll find him, and I’ll bring him back.  Then everyone can stop worrying.”
“People smile after they’ve talked to you,” Steve chuckled after a moment.  “Real smiles, not put-on, performance smiles.  It’s in the eyes, the difference.  And you...” he reached out, stroked a curl of hair off Tony’s brow, and let his palm linger on the curve of his cheek.  “You have kind eyes.  And beautiful hands.  I noticed your hands first off.  They look like a musician’s hands, or a painter’s, from a distance.” Steve dropped his gaze and his caress both to the hand Tony had left curled in his lap, lifting it gently, turning it to the warming light from the windows.  “Still do up close, but the scars and calluses show just how hard you work with them.”
Hell, for a time, Tony had been one of them; all bad boy chic, runaway millionaire come slumming to shock the fuck out of Dear Old Daddy with as much raunchy sex as he could fit into a day... But Tony'd had too much to prove back then, with a gigantic, Howard-shaped chip on his shoulder, plenty of high-end designer baggage to sling around (new-minted as well as heritage stuff), and no real world practice at not being an utter douchebag.  He hadn't been the darling for long, and if dear old Arnie hadn't taken him under his wing, Tony might've burned every bridge in the Village before he managed to figure out that it was him who was on fire.
He smirked to himself at that, thinking of Tony, and the sharp little thrill his captive heart had given when Steve had walked away from his customay spot at the bar and pulled out a chair at the enigmatic man’s table instead.  Maybe this thing with him, whatever it turned out to be, would be what Steve needed to settle in, cool his blood, and find something worthwhile to do with himself in this weird world he’d woken up to.  The thought set up a pleased sort of hum under his skin, like a buzz he could faintly feel through the pulse and thrust of his muscles, and the rhythmic slap of his feet.
“Heard Coulson talking with Fury about it down in the library earlier,”  Clint agreed, budging over at last, and cuddling up to the long curve of Natasha’s body.  “Current thought is that one of the bitter old timers got hold of his ear when Rogers went for lunch at the cafeteria.”
“No way, Poster boy!”  Tony went on.  “I’ll be the one to decide when you get to fuck off out of it, and it won’t be before you’ve given me a fair shot at that tiara!  Now where the hell are you?”
“Oh hell no,”  Tony cut him off, savage and grinning over his desktop collection of bills, biochem tracts, coffee cups, and lesson plans.  “You don’t get to ninja your GQ ass all up into my business, drop your digits on a note, then backflip off of the roof and disappear into the night.”
"Ahoy, Barkeep!"  Tony yelled over the din, drawing every eye in the place, "I'll have the Black Tiara of Envy, and two Jameson's on ice for me and my buddy whose name is ..."
Steve ground to a halt, not quite able to believe what he was seeing.  "You should start with suing whoever sold you that painting," he said, pointing past what looked like a very tall swing-arm lamp with a sort of claw where the light should be.  "It's terrible."
Steve made himself laugh, shaking the intrusive self pity out of his head.  This wasn't about Bucky.  It wasn't about Tony's friend either, and it wouldn't do either one of them any good to make their stolen evening swing that way.  He refocused his attention on Tony, and found the same kind of wry regret haunting that rakish face as he felt in his own.
Steve clenched his eyes shut and hesitated, heart pounding as his stomach twisted with futile, feeble guilt.  Above him, Tony had stepped off the landing and turned down the hallway with quiet thuds of his walker's legs.  Keys were jingling Tony's hands, and Steve's erection pulsed against the crease of his jeans like a trapped and angry thing, and there was simply no way he was backing down and running for cover now.
“Steve Rogers wanted none of that,”  James cut in at last, only slightly surprised to hear the words roll out of him in English now.  “Me like this,” he flexed his metal arm, and the plates whirred one against the other, flashing in the low light as they moved,  “with a list of murders longer than I can remember to my name; Carter barely able to recognize him, and hardly able to move or speak when she does; all the rest, everyone else he knew, gone to time, old age and treachery while he waited to be found, or to die?” he shook his head hard, long hair fretting at his shoulders as he pushed back away from her.  “The money Stark left him, the house, the business -- all that’s just dead men’s clothes, passed on at a wake.  You take them to be polite, but that doesn’t mean you’re excited to wear them.”
Steve didn’t pull back, didn’t resist the weight of Tony’s hand, didn’t squirm or plead with his eyes, he just waited, content to trust that Tony, barely more than a stranger to him, would let him breathe when it was needed.  For a moment, the power of that trust, the heated weight of it made Tony’s vision glitter, and his balls draw up tight against Steve’s chin.  It took several deep breaths and a vicious bite to his own lip to drag Tony back from that edge.
Tony blinked.  “It didn’t?  Because I did.  I mean I obviously did want you.  You really couldn’t tell?”
“No,” James said, not sure whether he was protesting or agreeing, “I can share each of you with the other.  Rogers... if he wanted-” he did not say,
From the corner of his eye, Tony saw Steve’s head lower, and turned to find him staring way too hard at the publicity flyer in his hands, that pretty blush staining the creamy skin of his all the way down his chest.
It was hard for Tony not to flinch at those words -- the implication behind them hit a lot closer to home than Tony had been ready for in his moment of outreach -- but he’d thought he managed it.  Until Steve’s fingers tightened on his, and those blue eyes were suddenly locked on, wide and worried.
Tony shook his head.  "Twenty questions ain't near enough, Cap," he laughed, tongue numb and cold against his lips.  "Few years back, I went to Afghanistan to do a technical stint with Doctors Without Borders.  My... I'd designed a low-cost, portable dialysis machine with a new kind of power supply, and I needed to be sure the clinicians understood how it worked, and what to watch out for before I just left it with them."  He licked his lips again.  "It was new tech.  Not experimental, but not like anything else anybody was using.  You can't just ship that kind of thing through the mail and hope nobody screws it up, right?"
Tony laughed.  "What, that's it?  No suggestions?  No invasive questions about what flashy new treatments I might not have tried yet?"
“Even the guy with the-”  Tony mimed an enormous mustache, and Steve’s hair flopped about as he nodded wildly again.
"But if it isn't,"  Tony winked as he turned his chair toward the door and tipped the man a sarcastic salute, "it's damn sure a better alias than Steve Goddamn Rogers!"
“Well, you did turn up at my place of work, sneak in to slip a note under my office door, and sneak back out without any of the staff or the students spotting you,”  Tony chuckled, idly spinning a wrench in circles on his desktop, “And let me tell you, we have some smart students and paranoid staff members around here, so that takes some doing for a man your size.”
“That’s terrible, Tony!”  But she was laughing even as she groaned, and surrendering even as she gathered the empty takeout containers to take to the trash.  She’d gone to the mat once to defend him, them, their company, their dreams, and Pepper knew she’d do it again in a heartbeat... but not if Tony wasn’t fighting for it with her.
thought he was dead,”  Fury corrected.  “Or close enough to it that he rewrote his will to cut his son out of it.”
“Oh, well perhaps it was.  I’ll confess the bullet made me feel far more certain about the whole matter.  Erm, speaking of which...?”
Behind him, Barnes shifted, a burring rustle of vinyl on kevlar.  Phil smiled and took out his wallet.  “Not this time.  How much for two?”
“Hi Clint,” Rogers waved, slinging his thrashing luggage over one shoulder and brandishing a waxed paper bag in the other hand.  “I brought bagels if you want one.”
Tony didn’t bother to stifle his chuckle at that.  “Well I hate to say so, darling, but you failed pretty badly on that account.  I was just as into you as all the rest, and look” he snaked a finger in to give the waistband of the boxers a snap, “you’re the one who got into
Nick closed the door, shutting out the murmurs from the rest of his crew, then put his shoulders to the door, crossed his arms over his chest, and waited.  It didn't take long.
“Because nobody knew his son was dead yet,”  Clint went ahead and jumped through the hoop when a long beat of silence proved the others were just gonna stubborn it out.
He felt laughter under his sweating back, and a moment later, he was swept up off his feet, like the noodly little nerd he was.  “Sure, Tony,” his beautiful tormentor allowed, carrying him back to the sofa, and the belt still draped over its back,  “You can have a little reward before we start again.”
But by then the gate had finished opening, and Clint’s only reply was an engine whine and a crunch of itty bitty tires on the gravel drive.  He grabbed his gun and his phone and took off around the house at a run.
She didn’t dither, she absolutely did not.  “I was looking for Mr. Coulson,” she answered, brandishing her tablet by way of excuse for interrupting what had probably been some kind of world saving, evil-confounding business, to judge from the cold-water glare Ms. Hill was giving Daisy over the Acting Director’s shoulder.  “Thought he might be in here with you?”
"What?"  Tony gasped, backing into the apartment and towing Steve after by his hand, "Television has lied to me?  Call my lawyer! Whom do I sue!"
Rogers was waiting for him in the late spring sunshine, rolling his sleeves up over his forearms, with his jacket and vest folded neatly over one of the loungers, and an unfamiliar green tie over the lot.  “Thanks, Barton,” he said, taking the plate when Clint thrust it at him and turned to pour a cup out of the pot.  “Which one’s yours?”
“Not as hard as his father’s survival.”  A hint of bitterness in the not-quite-neutral words, but of course there would be; that was the bleeding heart of the matter, the bone they could not pick between them for biting at the other.  James the son of a single mother, with a void where he had always wished a father might be, and Tony with a living, present father whom he despised, and blamed for his mother’s death.  Both of them too young, too bright, too easily wounded to step away from the pointless fight before their bridge was in flames, both of them too prideful to try and reach across the gulf after it had fallen to ash.
"And then people start acting like you can be collected, or bequeathed, or..." Steve's jacket pulled up over his wrist as he gestured, and a Breitling watch peeked out of the sleeve.  "Or even sold, and you get no damn say in it."
"Sure, Tony," he said, making careful, but short work of the clothing so that Tony could step delicately out of the sprawling framework of metal, leather, and canvas.  His weight stayed solidly braced on Steve's shoulders though -- a heady kind of trust, and in its way, strangely more intimate than the feeling of Tony's cock pressing down his tongue had been.
As if summoned (or more likely, listening at the door, as the analyst had a habit of doing,) Sousa the younger put her head into the room to announce,  "Animal Control filed a pickup report on two adult raccoons and three juveniles in Grand Central this evening, Boss.  Said they were nesting in the store room of the bagel place that closed down last month, and workmen probably disturbed them."
When he'd come back the next week, he hadn't removed his gloves at the door.  The mystery had endured, the betting pool had swollen, the debates as to top or bottom, kinky or vanilla, and Dom, sub, or switch continued as Mr. Thursday Night, (who was just asking for it if he kept on telling people his name was Steve) held to his pattern, sat in his corner, and spent his money like nobody in their right mind would wonder what brought him there, or what it would take to bring him somewhere more private.
Yes, I used Skye.  I’m not sorry, she’s an awesome character.  As usual, once you're back from the movie, come and speak to me in the comments, my apple trees, my whippoorwills -- I value your thoughts!
As expected, when Tony got himself into the living room, he found Steve in the recliner, rosy and golden in the low light of a single lamp, wearing his own blue t shirt and a pair of Tony’s boxers as he peered at one of the promotional pamphlets that Tony had picked up Friday.
"Um, excuse me," Tony said, wheeling his chair close and nodding at the whiskey and soda he'd left waiting for him on the high top, "Aren't you kinda late?"  Which, granted, was probably not the smoothest line of approach he might have taken, but sue him -- he was entitled a little slack on account of distraction.
“You trusted me with your submission,”  Tony smirked, ruffling Steve’s soft hair into even wilder spikes.  “I kinda feel like I should be the one saying thank you for that.”
“Sonofabitch,”  Tony breathed, and for a moment, Pepper was more than a little alarmed herself, but then the smile broke like sunrise across his astonished expression.  “Son of a
"S... Steve..."  Fingers threaded into his hair, trembling just a bit as he turned his face, turned his kiss to that heated thrust of cock and knelt back in a long, wet slide to reach the head.  This, he knew.  This wouldn't be different, new, or strange -- neon lit, chromed, and computerized.  This would be just like it always had been; the taste of salty skin, the growing hint of come spreading across his tongue, bitter or funky or sour or sweet or all of them together.  The heavy slide, solid and thick and knocking against his gag reflex until he made himself relax, open into an almost-yawn and-
"Ah," the man replied, slightly more pleasant now.  "I'm afraid Mr. Carbonell is teaching a welding class this morning, and cannot be disturbed."
In which scars are measured in less than twenty questions, and the matter of the missing elevator is explained.
And Tony had to cackle at that.  Hydra, indeed! "Yeah, that would be the worst possible way to blow your cover, wouldn't it, Captain?"  Then he reached for Steve's hand again, and pulled a sharpie out of his bag with a grin.  "Okay then, since you obviously need some tech support in this modern era, here's my number.  You give me a call sometime, and I'll show you how to fix that phone so the bad old Nazis can't use it to find you."
He always choose the shitty seat at the far end of the bar when he came in, never caring how close it was to the bathroom door, the wait station, and the gloomy make-out corner where every horny couple that thought they could get away with a quick blow or handjob without paying club cover for Downstairs went to get as busy as they could before Karl threw them out.  He just ducked the swinging door, dodged the sloshing drinks, and blushed a furious rose whenever he needed to politely ignore some public indecency going on beside him.
she answered him as he’d spoken, only the ghosting light’s play over her hair making proof that she’d moved even enough to speak.
been a massive op, and it had pulled every single one of White Star’s people far out of their comfort zones, and there had been more than a couple times when it looked like critical and absolute failure was in the cards.  Even though Director Stark and Agent Barnes had both made deliberate targets of themselves in Hydra’s crosshairs, none of them had expected the car bomb that took out Director Carter and her escort.
"Might be my real name, you don't know,"  Tony challenged, slipping his jacket on, and replacing his bag as Steve, Mr. Thursday Night, except miraculously here on a Saturday, hurried to stand like a sophomore when his date comes downstairs.  And god, he was gorgeous -- high, wide, and handsome, and as tempting as every single terrible idea Tony had ever had in his life, with his bright, anxious eyes, and that adorable fucking wrinkle between his eyebrows as he wrung his ballcap between both hands.
With his foot on the step, Fury turned and smirked.  “Oh, I haven’t forgotten.  It’s just that I’m late for an interrogation report on your captive, and you’re late for a debriefing with Assistant Director Hill, so we’re gonna have to leave our quid pro quo for after the dust settles.”
“Colonel Fury,”  Rogers cut in, a note of amusement in his voice.  “Good to see you.  I was about to ask Clint if he could track you down.”
“Nice, if you like beefcake,” the barkeep answered with just a quick glance. “Myself, I like em a little older though.”
Nick gritted his teeth until the urge to shout had faded just a little.  "Well, did Barnes bother to tell
Steve gave a shudder and a look of experienced horror when Tony mentioned the poultice, and cleared out of Tony’s way to let him get back into his mobile chair again.  But then he dropped back to the sofa once more, as if it was important to him that they be eye to sober eye for this one, and said.  “Can I... Can we do this again sometime?”
"Some people would say he signed up to be a symbol anyway, so what does it matter whose poster he's on?"  Thursday's expression was mild as milk, but the challenge remained in the quirk of his smile, and it couldn't have got under Tony's skin quicker.
.  Brought hundreds of POW's home, and left the whole prison camp in flames behind him, then he spends the rest of the war doing it again and again and again?"  Barton shook his head.  "Dude like that was never gonna stay quiet and play in the yard for very long, Boss.  You were gonna have to introduce the world to him sometime or other."
When Tony’s balls wrung up tight and hard, tension coiling like a trigger spring in his belly, and his cock bucking wet and ready between them, Tony dragged Steve down to him by the hair, kissed him hard, hard, hard: all teeth and tongue and more teeth again, and snarled, “You come when I do!”
“Hilarious,” Steve deadpanned.  “You still played it cool though.  And even if you hadn’t asked for my number, I enjoyed talking to you that night.  I probably would have gone to sit with you again on Thursday just for the conversation.”
There -- more information many of you've been wishing for, regarding what happened to put Tony where he's at.  There's more, of course, but you'll have to wait for it.  Love as always to all my commenters -- you're what keeps me going!
Tony was in hell.  Absolute hell.  And the sick part of it was, he’d asked to be put there.  More than asked, he’d
"I'm not hiding, exactly,"  Steve answered after a moment, voice softly thoughtful.  "More like avoiding."
“First thing when I got back to the states,” Tony said, cuddling close, “I got a cheeseburger.  It was just the most disgusting thing I could remember eating in my life, but goddamn, was I glad to have it.  I guess that would be my watershed moment.  All the rest, the walker, the Center, teaching, they were just the things that drifted by while I was figuring out what to do next.  And before you go looking up to me, I want it known that I’m still not sure how to answer that question.”
That won a grimace and a headshake by way of reply, and Rogers dug the keychain out of his pocket and passed it over.  “If you wouldn’t mind?  I get a crick in my neck just trying to get into that tiny thing.”
That made Steve look up in surprise, squinting past the worklight to examine U’s manipulator arm.  “Well I’ll be,” he murmured, reaching up to trace one of the grippers, and then grinning when the claw gently closed on his thumb and gave it a little shake.  “You built him, didn’t you?” Steve asked, “Both of them.  And your chair... That’s what you do here, when you aren’t teaching, isn’t it?”
Well, it wasn't quite a freeze, exactly, but it did take a heartbeat before that elegant left eyebrow quirked up into a challenge.  "Now why on earth would Captain America do a thing like that?" Mr. Thursday Night Who Was Gonna Need A New Name And Soon asked, slipping into the seat with an expression that he probably intended to be a deflecting smirk, but which read to Tony as 'intrigued despite himself'.
And those terms by God were gonna include one damned night of freedom per week, even if Steve had to throttle somebody to make it happen.
“You wouldn’t have to make guns, Tony.  Howard died owning more than 73% of SI’s stock.  That would give you enough of a controlling share that you could tell them to make bricks for children’s hospitals and get away with it!”
And Tony had to laugh.  One of the reasons he’d been able to afford to buy the Centre after he’d come back from Afghanistan to find his company tanked, his father dead, and all his patents tied up in the post-death ‘because I say so, young man’ of Howard’s estate, was that the building was nearly ten minutes from the nearest subway station.  That, and the lack of an elevator were the only things that brought it down into Tony's price range.
“Oh yeah,” James nodded.  “First thing after they ran the VIN number.  Positive match, of course.  Coroner said he was confident Stane couldn’t have survived blood loss of that volume in such a hostile environment.  They’re declaring him dead, and given where they found his car, and the dirty connections that are starting to surface around his tracks, CID is closing the investigation into his death as well.”
“You didn’t really seem to think twice about the chair though,” he said.  “Not aside from noticing it was there, so that was a point in your favor.”  Then he waved the whole pitiful mess aside with an airy hand and demanded, “Next question.”
Phil was preparing to translate when the barkeep laughed, and replied in the same language, but with a decidedly Warsaw accent.  “
“Um, sir, ma’am, waitaminute?”  Daisy waved both hands, palms out before her.  “I said the tracker hasn’t moved.  Like, not even shifted attitude or slid a little bit.  Like it’s still sitting exactly where he put it down when he took his shoes off.”  Then she leaned over the desk, and tapped the grid map over to street view so they could all get a good look at the building around that single red blip, and the hand lettered sign that hung over the door.
Steve chuckled, and let himself be led across the apartment.  It was clearly the man's haven; untidy and enthusiastic in a way that was at once chaotic, and deliberate, as though Tony might be able to find any book, any paper, any tiny fiddly screw he wanted in the uncertain landscape within minutes, so long as nobody ever snuck in here and cleaned anything up.  The furniture was of the slouching, sturdily comfortable sort; too well loved to be cheap, but too well worn to be valuable, no one item matching any other, but all of them broken in the way that none of the furnishings in Howard Stark's mansion seemed to be.  Though technically it was Steve's mansion now, signed, sealed and notarized by a lawyer who seemed to find the whole thing just as baffling as Steve himself did... but honestly, it was a relief to find himself in a place where the furniture looked like you were
He changed clothes quickly, picking out a new tie and socks from the store, and taking care to leave money for them, in case someone honest also worked there.  Then he wiped the place down, packed up the computer, gun, and the remains of the rooftop security cameras he’d ripped from their mountings, and left; shabby clothes and sneakers in a plastic bag, unconscious would-be assassin tucked up snug in his duffle.  He put both into the teal Smart Car, and crammed himself behind the wheel to take them all back to Manhattan.
He shrugged with one shoulder, and didn’t look at her.  “What do I need a salary for, Pep?  We’ve still got plenty to live on.”
“Ah.  8:20, sir,”  Daisy said, caught offguard by how very human her top-bosses seemed when stress had worn them thin.  “Ten minutes before the closing time listed on the website.”
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed like a man doomed.  “I want analysis on this location.  Full insertion writeup and history in half an hour, and get Delta over there to see if we can get eyes on whoever’s got him-”
Okay, so I didn't expect this pairing/tripling until boom: suddenly there it was, and now I won't lie, I love it more than just a little bit.
made it to the man’s eyes, but couldn’t shift the enormous thing already there; it was all a shield that Steve picked up every time he needed to deflect... what?  Attention?  Questions?  Meddling?  Pity?
He had come to this belief lately in his life; only, in fact, once he’d allowed himself to be seduced over to White Star’s side of the playing field, and more to the point, the really nice pool out back of Howard Stark’s place.  It wasn’t actually Clint’s fault, when you came right down to it, because Howard himself had been the one to set up most of his Monday mornings around work that could be done beside the pool in his dressing robe.  And if his protection detail included staying nearby, on a pool lounger, in his swim trunks, well who was Clint to argue?
Tony yanked his hand back, flexing his fingers out wide on the table for a moment.  "It's fine,"  he bit out as Steve began to stammer an apology.  "It's... Don't.  Just let me..."  He snagged his glass, mostly ice now, with tea and sweet milk clouding the dregs, and tipped it back to slurp some of the ice between his teeth.  The crunch of it fracturing as he chewed helped Tony bring his heart rate back down to sane levels again.
One scene left in this installment, my Adders.  Many thanks as always to those who've been reading along and cheering me on toward the end -- your words give me life!
“Oh, you know her then?” Rogers asked, tipping the stool precariously onto its back legs when Flowers got a look at Clint and immediately started thrashing again.
"It's okay,"  Tony shrugged, tapping his nearly empty glass against the tiara that was still sitting on the table.  "I don't typically do hookup sex with strangers until I've had their phone number for at least a month."
“A little,” Steve admitted shyly.  “I mean, not in the creepy way, but... yeah.  I noticed you at the club, and you intrigued me, so... I kept an eye on you.”  Tony met his wary glance with his biggest grin, propped his chin in one hand, and settled in expectantly.
Natalia’s look was skeptical, but then she was a Widow; words were her snares, her traps, and her weapons.  Declarations weren’t anything but air.  Clint though, gave a decisive nod, as though that fully settled everything.   Then he thrust both his arms out of the blanket cocoon and made grabby motions at both of them.  “Now come on.  I want to get at least a few more hours of shut eye before Fury sends us over to comb through Stark Industries’ dirty laundry.”
sound loaded.  Steve’s face was pensive in the low morning light, eyes downturned, as if examining the worth of his two, big hands.  Tony could think of a few thousand things to say to shake Steve out of whatever dark place it was he’d wandered, but there was something in the turn of Steve’s lip, the crease of his brow that stopped the words on his tongue, and made him wait the silence out instead.
came on the radio just after he’d disappeared down the alley, and the song was nearly down to the final drumbeats by the time he turned up empty handed at the passenger’s side door.
“Okay sugarpie,” Tony laughed, and threw an arm across those broad, sturdy shoulders.  “So tell me...”  He waited for Steve’s glance, and the wary nod that followed it before continuing.  “Why pick me?  Why my table?”  He shook his head and thumbed Steve’s lips still so he could finish.  “I know I’m not the only regular at the Eagle who has good hands and a compulsion to make people like him, so why, when everyone there had been thirsting for you for weeks, did you decide to come sit with me?”
This time Tony did whimper.  But he also put every ounce of willpower he had into smoothly bending his elbow and wrist, drawing the tablet in from full extension while keeping it carefully level on his palm. When finally, the ridge of plastic touched his own naked chest, Tony dared to breathe, dared to hope.
"You gotta give the guy credit,"  Barton muttered with a wince as Romanoff knotted the gauze, "The raccoons were a stroke of genius."
“Be my guest.” Rogers nodded graciously and tipped the stool upright, stepping away from the island, the captive, and the operatives who were even now crowding into the kitchen like kids on Christmas morning.  “I’ll just leave you to it then,” he said, catching Clint’s eye and tipping a nod toward the back door and the pool deck beyond.  Clint nodded, then turned back to watch the bagels toast as Captain America slipped away.
James shook it without a moment’s hesitation.  “So Stane’s kid kicked up a little bit of fuss at the news, but given that he won’t inherit if his dad’s just missing, that didn’t last.  At this point, far as the USAF is concerned, Obidiah Stane was either killed for the money Stark gave him to ransom Tony, or he was backdoor peddling Stark weaponry to enemies of the state, and was killed when a deal went bad.”  Which in a strictly literal sense, were both true.   Jarvis did rather appreciate that irony.
“Because Rhodey said he was gonna wring your neck if he had to keep coaching you on weights like normal people do,”  Steve’s mild voiced reminder let Tony know his internal narrative had slipped out on him again.  “And I may owe him, and occasionally think you’re cute, but I don’t need to be treated to your rich-little-asshole act when I’m trying to do you a favor,” he set the sketchbook aside now, and those arclight blue eyes fastened on Tony’s with an utter lack of pity as Steve uncoiled from the sofa like a rising storm god.  “So since
Steve let Tony play him like a grand piano, eagerly rising to every stroke and bite till he gleamed with sweat and knotted his fists in the rumpled blankets, till Tony had rendered him glassy eyed and gasping.  And oh, but Tony wanted to test his range; wanted to see if that lithe back would arch as high for a rake of nails down his belly as for a stroke of tongue; wanted to see what the pitch of that sigh would sound like if he were to slap Steve's cock instead of just licking it; wanted to find out if this lovely boy would yield and yield and keep on yielding until, say, all of Tony's fist had slipped inside him.
And then Tony kissed him, and Steve let himself be kissed; leaning into Tony, face tilted upward in a drowsy smile, as if being kissed at such an angle were a comfort to him somehow.  It was unlike any other kiss with any other hookup Tony could remember in his life -- warm and slow, unhurried and tender as if they'd been lovers for years, and easy kisses and reverently wandering touches were a daily thing between them.  As if easy kisses had been any part of Tony's life at all in the three years it had been since Afghanistan spit the chewed remains of the Estranged Stark Heir out, and Jarvis brought Anthony Carbonell home in his place.  As if there had been anyone in all that time, whom Tony had wanted to bring close enough to him that he
"I... uh, I don't.  Have it.  My phone," he said, evasive in all the wrong ways all of a sudden.  Tony leveled his best '
That was when the phone rang -- not Clint’s, but the one on Howard Stark’s desk.  Rogers put up one finger to Clint, and plucked it out of the cradle.  “Rogers.  Oh, hello, Ms Arbogast.  Bambi, of course.  Sorry.”
Tony pressed his fingers again, smirking.  “Yeah, that’s what I thought.  Okay then, here’s the deal.  You can donate funds to the Center.”  He gave those soft lips one tap, and then leaned away.  “
“Well anyway, I’m sorry I overstepped,”  Steve went on, audibly squaring himself up against the rejection he thought he had coming.  “I promise I won’t bother you aga-“
“Your message said you had news,” Jarvis mustered himself to ask eventually, and looking grateful for the interruption to his thoughts, James nodded.
Tony pulled a face.  "Yeah, ok, no.  Not into Thugplay here."  Which made Steve giggle, which made Tony need to kiss him again.  "Okay," he managed eventually, when they were both just a little breathless once more, "no humiliation kink, got it.  But is it okay if I tell you when you've pleased me?"  Steve's eyes fluttered closed for a moment, and a shivering stretch of pleasure worked its way seismically through him.
to answer the question of which side of a flogger Adonis (Neddy's nickname for him) preferred.  Mr. Thursday Night (Tony's nickname for him, and one he clung to ferociously so as not to accidentally call the man something that would out him for the enormous nerd he'd spent decades trying to pretend he'd never been,) had allowed the stamp, and had bought the whole place a round that night, but hadn't gone near the back stairs.
Steve wasn’t in the bed when Tony woke up. Tony weathered a moment of disappointment over that, glowering at the 5:30 on the alarm clock’s entirely unreasonable face until he realized that there was a light on in the other room, and his chair had been brought over from the charging stand, and parked beside the bed.  Listening hard, Tony caught the faint whirring of servos at work in the other room, and the occasional flutter of paper, and then he smiled.
“I...”  Steve stammered, just the right side of flabbergasted to put Tony’s singing nerves a little to rest. “Stalkery?  What?”
we were then.  I’d like to see him again.  I know,” he held up a hand, fending off Jarvis’ reply.  “I know he must’ve suffered like hell in captivity -- I’ve seen guys come home from that shit, and I know it’s hell and then some, and maybe he won’t wanna see anybody that reminds him of that, but... Will you tell him anyway?  Just tell him that I miss my friend, and I want to see him again?”
Tony moved slowly, careful as a cat picking its way across a cluttered table, but there was something in the act that seemed like permission, even an instruction to look his fill, and get it over with.  So that’s what Steve did.
Rogers stared back without blinking.  “I think it’d be stupid of us to leave that to chance.  After all, no matter what his relationship with his father might have been, the kid was still a Stark, and he must have gotten more from Howard than just a lot of money.  And I’ll tell you this for nothing -- Howard might’ve been more of a tinkerer than a fighter, but I still wouldn’t want anyone with his kinda smarts working against me.”
Steve stared back at him, sober and unmovable, his hand still gently curled, palm up on the table where Tony had abandoned it.  Then he gave a single nod, and clearly settled down to wait.  And shit.  Now Tony really did have to figure out what to say.  He stared at Steve's hand, thoughts churning, until those fingers flexed wide again -- an invitation, and one he was surprised to find himself taking.  His own hand was trembling like a bird as he let Steve's broad fingers curl around it.
She sniffed hard against the infuriating urge to cry, and pressed on.  “Stane hasn’t been seen in nearly a year, Tony.  They’ve been
“I’m betting that list would start with Jarvis, and go on through just about everyone you know, Tony,” she answered.
Barnes was quiet for the rest of the ride.  Not his customary ‘nothing worth saying’ quiet, either -- this was his ‘sniper’s nest’ kind of quiet.  The sort of quiet that told Phil that even if he put the effort into getting a look at Barnes’ shrouded face right now, he’d find it as opaque and inscrutable as a kevlar mask.  The sort of quiet that got heavier and more menacing with every turn Phil took toward the place he clearly did not want to go.  One day, Phil mused, he’d have to let Barnes know just how telling that quiet was to anyone who knew the first thing about him.  But that day wasn’t going to be today.
“Update Coulson on the trackers,” Fury nodded, reaching over to scoop Daisy’s tablet off his desk.  “And get Barnes in here too.  Johnson?”  It took Daisy a moment of watching Hill shut the door behind her to realize that last was meant for her, and when she did, she found the Acting Director’s gaze fixed on her over the tablet in his hand, like a cat watching a mousehole.  “What do you have to add to this discussion?”
She laughed, and bent to kiss his cheek.  “You’d only fill it up with classes and tinkering if they did.”
“Love note from one of your students?”  she asked with a smirk as she turned the square over and spotted the doodle scribbled just where a seal would go  -- three concentric circles shaded cleverly in pen-scratch, surrounding a star.  “Someone knows what you like.”
when, upon returning from a trip to the john around midnight one Saturday, Tony rolled up on Mr. Goddamned Thursday Night -- out of his Armani and poured into criminally snug jeans, a ball cap, and a little blue shirt that deserved hazard pay for what he was putting it through -- pulling out the chair and preparing to sit at Tony's table.
Steve summoned a theatrical shiver, and darted a glance at the horrible painting again.  "Only if you turn that creepy old man to face the wall.  I don't think I can get it up with him staring at me..."
The look Barnes shot him then was eloquent with scorn, but he put it into words anyway.  “Please.  I may not be as good with code as the Widow is, but I can manage a little backup like this.  Not even the SETI screen saver noticed I was there.”
"Yes," the man replied in exactly the same overly patient way that Peggy did when she thought Steve was being particularly dense.  "You've rung the Jay Street Technical Arts Centre."  There was a pause, while Steve sternly told his sinking belly not to be ridiculous, that Tony must've thought Steve was a cheating husband on the slide from a controlling wife, and so of course he hadn't given Steve his real number.  He'd been stupid to imagine that after all these years, he could just -
The yellow and red caution sign glared at him as he reached in past the wires and collected his bag of clothes, but Steve just gave it back a smirk.  He’d counted on the metal box to block the passive signals from whatever bugs White Star had put in his clothes, and on the electrical interference to baffle whatever active trackers they’d had on him, and to judge from a whole weekend free from the crawling, itchy feeling of watching eyes on the back of his neck, Steve figured it had worked pretty well.
Barnes shook his head in emphatic agreement, and Fury sat back, giving up all pretense to resistance with a sigh.  “All right, then this’ll be your case, Deputy Director Rogers,” he said, and acted like he didn’t see Rogers blink back from the WTF title like it had smacked him in the forehead.  “Johnson and Romanoff are working on Flowers’ encryptions.  I’ll have Klein get you the records we have on the kidnapping in the morning.”
“Well,” Clint caught up the coffeepot and jogged after, “either that, or you could tell me what you’re looking for, and I’ll help you find it, and that’ll keep us both outta trouble for awhile.”  Again with the skeptical face, but this time Clint met it with a grin.  “What?  Call it a bilateral show of trust if you wanna, but we got to start somewhere, right Cap?”
Clint looked at the keys dangling in the sunshine, then gave Rogers another once-over, and set the coffeepot down.  “Or you could just ask me to open up Stark’s workshop for you,” he offered.  “I mean, it’s kinda yours anyway, so it’s not like I’m particularly invested in keeping you out of it or anything.”  Rogers gave him back a deeply skeptical eyebrow, and Clint shrugged.  “What?  It’s not like you ever asked before!”
In the meantime, may I draw your attention to this Official Sciencey Research that says that feedback comments make writers write faster...? (Points offscreen)
Not what Daisy would’ve called a fair assessment, but she bit her lip and made like a hole in the air.  After all, it
“Stark and Carter both knew what they were risking with this op.  They both knew how hard Pierce, Ross, and Garrett would fight to keep Rogers, and they both knew very well what it could cost them personally, and they never once flinched.  Hell, Howard even rebuilt his will expecting that this might be the op where Hydra finally killed him, and you damn well
“Oh geez, Tony no!”  Steve cut in again, flustered and rushing over the words.  “I just... You said you wanted a phone number, back when... and I didn’t have it that night, so I just-“
"He."  Tony swallowed a ghostly mouthful of sand and granite dust, blood and cordite smoke.  "He was a POW?"  The words staggered getting past his numb lips.
make everything worse if he let them out, Tony lifted the arm that was balancing the full teacup on top of his tablet.  His shoulders were screaming at him, his thighs trembling under the weight of his spread stance, and his extended arm felt like it had been on fire forever, but he managed to bring the liquid level inside the translucent china without sloshing any on the screen.
The Bouncer, a great wall of a man with a curly ginger undercut, and a unicorn tattoo on his neck, took one look at them -- Phil in his fitted suit, Barnes in his tactical black, and smirked.  “Downstairs, I presume?”
He was still musing on that, distracted and more than a little grateful for it, when Steve let the shop door swing shut behind them, and asked, "Do you want a hand?  With the chair, I mean," he added in answer to Tony's perplexed look.  "Hill grade's not that steep, but it is up the whole way back."
Clint sighed, slipped his phone into his tac suit pocket, and leaned back over the ledge.  “Hey Cap?” he called.
That won him a glance, and a chilly little smile.  “You don’t need to run interference with Fury for me, Clint.  It’s fine if he knows we’re down here.”
Clint glanced toward Rogers, and the thin strand of hope he held out for a rescue from that quarter, but that one glance was enough to drop the play right out of his mind, and bring both feet solid to the floor.  The man had gone bloodless white, so pale that tiny blond freckles stood out across his nose and cheeks.  His blue eyes were wide, focused on the middle distance and flicking restlessly at nothing as he checked and rechecked some unseen tally in his mind.
let it bother him.  This was New York.  People shouted in public twenty times a day, and if they could ignore it then, they could damned well ignore it now.
"Bartender said that, huh?"  Tony took a glance at the bar, and found Karl leering from behind it, flashing Tony a completely unsubtle hand sign that might have stood for 'OK', or might have meant  'Hit That Till It Breaks'.  He grinned, and nodded the gorgeous blond back toward his chair.  "Well, he's not wrong.  Take a load off."
"I'm sorry,"  Steve managed, hands hovering, the words like gravel in his throat.  "Tony, I'm sorry, I thought you... God, I'm so-"
So he fetched out one of his better naughty grins and said, "If you've ever used the White Eagle's bathroom, you've stepped in worse there, too. But come on," he edged his chair a bit to the side and beckoned Steve to step up beside him.  "I'd rather have you loom over me from the side than be responsible for ruining those shoes of yours."
“Didn’t look,” he answered, more Brooklyn than Moscow in his accent tonight.  “Too late for a retrieval anyway.  Left shoe was sitting on the front counter, right next to the register.”
"He lost you."  Nick turned a chair to perch astride it, and steepled his fingers on the headrest before him.  "A man who's only been awake in this century for about a year, has managed to ditch White Star's very best retrieval team on their home turf in a train station, in the middle of the day, over
But then he drew Steve’s head back up, gave them both a second to gasp in the sweet reel of oxygen, and set him back to work with a murmured, “Good, very good.  Now more...”
"Oh," Mr. Thursday said, snatching the cap from his head and bouncing straight back up to his feet.  "I'm so sorry! It's just it's so crowded, with the show going on upstairs tonight," he said, tipping a nod at the thudding bass bleeding down through the ceiling.  "The bartender said you wouldn't mind if I joined you at your table, so..." his hands, broad and strong, with long fingers that gave all the right suggestions, flexed on the chair back as the man dithered to a halt, clearly ready to leave at Tony's slightest hint.
"Yinsen's nephew came to the camp a few days after the cave in, looking to pay the ransom.  He found me and his uncle's body instead.  Got people from his village to come back and dig me out, and they did their best for me, but Gulmira was so deep in hostile territory that it was another month before anybody with more medical skill than the local midwife could have a look at me.  Then another two months after that before they could get word to the UN that I was even still alive.  By that time the bones in my legs and pelvis had already started to heal up wrong."
Steve let it go with a grudging smile.  “Okay.  This might seem... um,” he ran a hand through his hair again, almost dithering with a sudden, nervous energy.  “Okay, it’s weird, and you might not like it, but I’m just gonna ask anyhow,” he declared, then turned on the sofa and reached for the discarded flyer.  “Could I maybe help you fund the Arts Center? Because I can tell it’s good work you’re doing here, teaching important things to people who are probably never gonna be able to afford college, and your website said the Center operates on tuition and donations, but I don’t want you to think that I’m trying to buy, um,” the flush on his cheeks went bright as Steve waved a hand between them and stammered, ”-
Rogers gave him an unimpressed look and asked,  “So there was no White Star action taken on the kidnapping?”
Not that he hadn't been invited.  Just about every week since he'd turned up, and usually more than once or twice a night, too.
“We’re not going back yet,” he replied easily, as if they both were calm as a Sunday picnic.  “There’s one more place I’d like to check out before we head in.”
“Besides,” Clint gusted a deep, deflating kind of sigh, and flung one arm across Natalia’s ribs to curl over James’ metal elbow.  “I figure Rogers is fine.  He’s just out looking for what anyone looks for when they’ve lost everything; he’s looking for some sign of home.”
There was cream cheese in the bag, so Clint put that on one of the bagels, buttered the other one, and grabbed the coffeepot and a mug for Rogers, more or less ignoring the impromptu interrogation being set up behind him.  Until he turned to go, and found Natasha directly behind him, hands braced on her hips, and eyes fiercely calculating.  “You stay on Rogers,” she warned.  “If this is just a distraction...”
“Good.  God, that’s good,”  Tony bore down with a groan as Steve sucked hard on his cock and slipped a finger into him with a long, easy slide.  Just quick enough to bring a flutter of sting, but then it was a stretch of sweet sensation that made him want to arch and writhe like a cat.  Steve’s knuckles pressed at the back of his balls, and Tony flexed his hand to cup Steve’s head as he purred, “Again...”  And this time, he held Steve low over his cock, nose pressed to his belly, throat fluttering around Tony when his finger pressed home.
"Yes, he was,"  Steve said evenly, and began to rub his thumb back and forth across Tony's knuckles, circling each one as he went, as though to keep him present at the table, anchored from the past that was prickling like high desert frost across Tony's skin.  "He came home just before Christmas last year, and they say he's making great strides, considering."
“He’s gone to the SI campus,” Hill answered,  “Cell won’t reach him there, but Active Com will if it’s impor-”
“So you get to continue your fellatio rights without the benefit of latex, because I’m clean too,”  Tony told him fondly.  “Which is good, because I want you to put that gorgeous mouth back on me right now,"  he stroked the silky hair back from Steve's brow and smiled as he took firm hold again and made Steve's eyes go dark and wanting.
Rogers’ lip twitched as if he got the joke, but the wicked glint was gone almost before Clint had seen it.  “One of each then,” he said, setting the plate down and waving the coffee away.  “Say, you know the access code for the garage, right?”
"Due respect, sir," he said, taking the coffee back when Natasha passed it over.  "I think you're maybe forgetting something important."
"Thanks for being patient with us,"  Steve cut in smoothly, his charming Poster Boy face back in place as he took the bill with one hand and dug his wallet out of the pocket of his jeans with the other.  "We're sorry to have kept you so long, but it was a really lovely meal."
"He'll come back,"  Romanoff opined after a moment.  "I give him the weekend.  Maybe a day or two longer, and then he'll come back.  He won't leave Carter, and he won't leave Yasha.  Just give him time to feel his point's been made, and he'll show up with bagels like nothing ever happened."
being a horny little shit at the time, of course, but everybody else at MIT was at least three years older than me, and Rhodey..." for just a second, that weightless smile flickered out, but Tony caught the slip before it fell too far, and carried the joke home valiantly.  "My roommate would have killed anybody who took me up on it.  He was ROTC, too, so he'd have known a dozen foolproof ways to get rid of the body."
“Pepper,”  Tony reached across the table and captured her hand in one of his.  “Pepper, I can’t do that.  You know why I can’t.  We’ve talked about this.”
“Did...”  Rogers swallowed then, and dredged up a cheap plastic smile from somewhere as he blinked the two of them back into focus.  “Did he say Howard’s son was named
she went on, challenging him to point out that she had looked for ghosts, rivals and hidden threats just the same after she’d decided to stay with White Star.  He didn’t.  That was a trap, and they both knew it.
It was a tough job, but he was up to the challenge.  Even after the protection detail had shifted from Stark to Rogers, Clint had done whatever he could to maintain his weekly devotions to the Saints of towel, oil, and lounge chair.  Especially when there was a shitstorm brewing over at headquarters, and nothing he could add to the atmosphere besides another butt available for the chewing.  He figured if anybody needed a slice of his particular butt, they’d know where to find him, so it was best he should stay put and make some good use of sunscreen while everyone else panicked.
“Tony, you didn’t include your salary in these figures.”  Pepper tapped her fingernail on the misleading bottom line without mercy.
Steve was still exploring that notion when he arrived back at the vintage shop, and so it was with perhaps a bit less caution than was warranted, he ducked into the alley and made the climb back up to the roof again.  The transformer box was sun-warm already, dusty and dull from the rains of a dozen years, but it opened up with barely a squeak for him -- he’d taken care to oil it well when he’d first come up here to break the lock and get it open.
“Your time is worth paying for,” she told him, trying for earnest rather than exasperated and ready to smack him.  “You’re a genius, Tony!  Your mind operates on a world-changing level, and you know it!  The ARC battery alone-”
Phil chose the stool in the middle, and sat down, wallet beside his hand on the scarred wooden bartop.
He gulped a breath and thrust roughly to his feet beside the bed.  His cock, too long strangled between his bunched thigh and deeply creased denim, gave a blood-hungry surge of pain as he did so.  That wrung another grunt from him, but the ache was bracing too, and in its shadow Steve made short and efficient work of his task.  Simpler than one of those suits; tee shirt over his head, folded in two quick swipes; boots toed off in a quick tumble, socks whipped free and tucked into each boot as he righted them; jeans yielding almost as soon as he popped the button open and began to tug.
"Jay Street Technical Arts Center," he repeated to himself.  Then he grabbed his empty cup and plate, and headed back up to the counter to ask the girl there if they might have such a thing as a phone directory about the place.
Fury turned to his lieutenant.  “Get Barnes on it.  I want proof this was a willing sale before we move in to recover.  What time did the tracker go still?”
And yeah, Tony probably should have expected that he’d get little more than a wordless croak and a hip-thrust in answer, but he had to chuckle anyway.  He tightened his grip just a little, and gave Steve’s scarlet, straining cock another slick pull with his fist, then he slithered up to put his lips to Steve’s ear to whisper again.  “What can I do to make it good for you?”
Fury just smiled though, unlaced his fingers, and tipped his head back to nod.  “Well, that may be true, but I invite you to think real hard about the fact that the Grunt in question managed to ditch the very best protection detail we employ -- which is made up of our best spies -- and he did it while he was scrapping every one of the trackers he wasn’t supposed to know were in his suit, and ditching those pricey shoes you’re so worried about.”
“I think you’re forgetting the other half of our sharing moment,”  Rogers called, his face set in a scowl that said plainly that he wasn’t gonna be bought off with some busywork and a wild goose chase.
Fury though, wasn’t interested in Hill’s diatribe at all.  He was peering at the street view like it was a crystal ball.  “Rogers is worth more,” he said distractedly, turning the view to see farther down the street.
Phil’s request for the vintage cocktail made Barnes scoff loudly, even as it made the barkeep beam with delight.  “Ooh, you do know the way to a mixologist’s heart, don’t you?” he crowed, flapping at them with both hands.  “Go sit down, lovebirds.  I’ll bring it out in a minute.”
He felt Steve's nod in the subtle vibration of his arm, though the thumb never stopped its restless process.  "I suspect it's mostly true, too.  Can't be easy, coming back from torture."
By which, of course, he meant the ransom money; existing in a tenuously legal grey space between Edwin Jarvis’s loyalty and Tony Stark-no-its-Carbonell-now’s stubbornness.  None of his kidnappers had lived to collect it, and Howard hadn’t lived to ask for it back either, and Howard’s estate seemed to have better things to think about than a stray ten million gone from petty cash.  For now, anyway.  But instead of picking at the thread of
who do.  And in a war zone with more factions than one or two in play, there’s a whole lot of ways that things can turn out.”
“Your priorities remained unchanged to the very end, I see,”  Jarvis said to the tombstone, and was immediately surprised to find the sentiment accompanied not with bitterness, but with an odd pang of nostalgia.  There had been good times, working for Howard, of course -- mainly those years when his Ana had been alive, and Agent Carter still a vibrant force in the shallow tapestry of life with a genuis playboy insustrialist, but he had loved his position in Howard’s household once.
Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to do that math, really, and there was something about Steve -- some watery relief to his giggles, some lingering edge of pain beneath the tears in his eyes -- that suggested that he wouldn’t much want to show his work on that equation either.
"I can just climb the stairs,"  Tony agreed, "If I wanted to, I could use the chair to walk, run, or even fight, in a pinch, but really,"  he reached out two fingers to hook Steve's chin, and urge him to lean in close.  "Right now, think this is the best perk to the standing formation..."
.  And something fragile and barely mended inside him collapsed under the thawing weight of that promise, thin as it was.  He dragged in a breath, shivering and wet over his tongue, and then he managed a smile.  “I’m just a kid from Brooklyn,” he said.
that the only reason we can afford to let his ass run around New York at all is because SHIELD and HYDRA each think the other one killed him getting him outta the ice?  Did he maybe tell Rogers that the game of Three Card Monty we had to play on those two agencies to keep them from dissecting him to harvest Project Rebirth's only success is what killed Stark and put Carter out with an injury she is never coming back from?  Did he maybe explain what could happen the instant any agent of the Government figures out that Captain America's ashes are not buried at Arlington because he's walking around Manhattan
There was a beat of silence, some loud public rustle filling up the air until Steve coughed once, and sighed.  “I didn’t think he’d give it to you.  My number.  Fella who answered the phone sounded like a real hard case.”
“I’d like to see everything we have on the son,”  Rogers put in, standing when Fury did, and flipping the folder closed as well.  “If he got away from his kidnappers, I’ll need to know where he might have gone to heal up from whatever happened.”
He blinked, and her smile grew wider.  “What’s wrong,” she teased, “Do you think I’ll miss at this range?”
?  Oh, and did Barnes maybe tell him any details about HYDRA's little super soldier reeducation program while he was telling his best buddy all the rest of the facts of twenty-first century life?"
“What?”  Tony laughed, rolling closer so he could jostle the man’s knee with his own.  “It's ok, Steve,” he said when that won him a flickering, sidelong glance, “you can say what's on your mind.”
But it wasn’t fair to use any of that against Tony now -- not with everything he’d lost just finding a way to come home at all.  And it also wasn’t fair for Tony to be pouring his genius and his remaining fortune into a flyspeck trade school that comped more tuition than it collected, and hadn’t got even a distant dream of being accredited.  It wasn’t that the Tech Arts Center wasn’t doing good work within the community, of course, it was just that Pepper couldn’t shake the certain knowledge that Tony was meant for
," he giggled, giving Steve a shove through into the darkened front hall.  "I'd apologize for yanking your chain, but that was just too adorable for words!"
“Where the hell did you get that car, and didn’t they have one in your size?”  Clint blurted, jamming his feet into flip flops as he hit the gate release.
"Well that makes sense," Tony agreed, leaning a little so Steve could undo the last clasp, highest up on his leg.  "There must've been hundreds of little Steve Rogers in those first few baby boom years.  Hey, sit back for a minute, ok?"  he asked, then as Steve complied, leaned over and braced both hands heavily on Steve's shoulders as he pushed up out of the metal frame's embrace.
Hill didn’t look happy about that either, but she gave the nod they all knew she was expected to before she headed for the door.  “Anything else, sir?”
That won a breathless, half-desperate giggle, and Steve's arm bunching under Tony’s weight, turning at elbow and wrist to gently, shyly stroke at Tony's cock where it thrust warm and heavy against Steve's side.  "I..." he licked his pink lips, shivered in a breath and tried again.  "I don't beg," he said, and his voice was suddenly steady as steel, "and I really don't like mean names, or... or insults.  Had enough of that as a kid, and it'll just make me wanna sock you in the nose, okay?"
Steve hitched up on one elbow, face puzzled as he nodded, as if he couldn't imagine a different way of going about things.  "Sure, Tony," he said.
“Barnes,”  Fury’s voice came down like a wall, though he didn’t ever once take his eye off Rogers.  “Your point’s taken.”  He squared his shoulders to the front again, and continued. “And so is yours, Cap.  It’s about time you and me laid some cards out on the table.  You wanna start with why you’re using Howard’s phone to set up dates with reporters?”
Then Clint got busy with the bagels while Rogers secured his ahem-guest to one of the barstools, and finally unzipped the duffel to reveal her flushed, rumpled, and furious face, and, “Holy shit, is that
“You don’t know the field,” Fury said.  “It’s a different war, a different game from the one you played in Europe.”
And with that, he keyed in the tap-code on his hidden touchpad, shifted his balance just so, and stood.  The chair shifted and flowed around him until it held him erect -- tall and straight, and standing on his own two sturdily-braced feet.  He took that first step up, thrilling as he always did at how smoothly his machine moved with him, the balance perfect, the servos whisper-quiet, the range of motion elegant and poised as he swung around on the wide step and found himself face to face with Steve Rogers' open mouthed, unabashed awe.
James shook his head, chuckling.  “No body, no slug, no casing, no ballistics.  The gun you asked for was a captured item, and by now it’s disappeared into one of a hundred arsenals.”  He spread his hands wide, palms toward the ground in front of him.  “Case closed.  But I hope you won’t take it personally if I don’t let you make me tea for a little while.”
But then the wary look in Steve’s eyes snared his attention away again, drew Tony in as he hesitated, one leg almost out of his jeans to ask, “What?”  And there was a line between his brows, petulant, stubborn, defensive.
It was a fine morning, crisp and bright, with a sky the kind of blue that New York didn’t often see, and the damp of a heavy dew clinging to the long shadows as the sun made its way up through the skyscrapers.  Steve headed for the subway station with a spring in his step and a ridiculous urge to whistle held firmly behind his teeth -- this was New York, after all, too much cheer before rush hour was always held in deep suspicion. But he hadn’t gone more than a block or two before he realized what a shame it would be to spend any part of a morning like that underground.  And it wasn’t all that far to Brooklyn on foot, especially if he took it at a run.  Heck, he’d probably even wind up getting there faster than if he hailed a cab at this hour, anyway.  And well... he could stand to burn off a little bit of energy before he took himself back to face the music at White Star.
Tony allowed the point with a nod, but rolled on anyhow.  "But I think mostly he'd be somewhat appalled at having been turned into a poster boy for the modern Gay Pride movement without any say so of his own."
“Yeah, well it’s better than drinking,”  Tony answered, realizing only after he’d said it just how bitter and defensive that had sounded.  “I specialized in robotics when I was at MIT,” he offered by way of an olive branch.  “Among other things.  These guys were actually supposed to be my lab helpers, to hold up heavy things when I was welding, fetch tools when my hands were full -- I even tried to teach Dummy to cook once.  Only once.”  He had to stop there, swallow against the quaver in his voice that rose up on him every time he was reminded how close he’d come to losing them too.  If U and Dum-E had been at his ARC workshop instead of at home, they’d have been seized along all the rest.
Tony let it come, clenching side, watering eyes, and all, wondering how long it had been since he’d let himself laugh like this, openly, loudly, unafraid... and more importantly, for joy instead of for show.  Not since Afghanistan, definitely, but before that, Tony had mostly spent his time with Vanko, who as far as Tony knew didn’t actually know how to laugh, and with Pepper, whom Tony had been desperately courting on many levels.  Jarvis was good for a bit of dry sarcasm, of course, but after Ana’s illness and the split with Howard, the old man’s jokes came less frequently.  Maybe back in college, with Rhodey... well.
He gave a slow blink that could have been acknowledgement, or a warning.  She plunged on anyway.  “And maybe if you’re gonna put a depression era kid from Brooklyn in thousand dollar shoes?  You should probably not put our best trackers in them, because now we’re gonna have to go buy them back from that vintage shop before she sells them to someone who’se likely to take them through an airport and figure out what’s really in there.”
This is it, Death lilies!  It took me a lot longer to knock the final chapter into any shape I liked, but it's here at last, and all for you!  If you like it, I'd love to hear from you about why.  If you REALLY like it, I hope you'll direct thence other friends who might like it too, because I don't write these things for ME, after all.
apparently need more motivation than just a passing grade in Gym class to get your muscle tone up to par, here we are.  And where we go from here depends on you, but I should say that you haven’t actually earned the kind of reward our last session ended in,” he lifted Tony’s arm a little more as he leaned in close, “yet.”
"Well,"  Tony said, nudging the chair to corner up the walk that led to the Center's main entrance, and keeping hold of Steve's hand to tow him along up the ramp. "I guess we'd better get you upstairs before you cause a scene then, hadn't we?"
A year if he let them do the work right there, with no guarantees of success.  A week if he signed the offer away, and let Jarvis sneak him back into the US quietly and quasi-legally.  Jarvis knew a guy who knew a guy, and he had a new passport and ID for Tony, and Tony had decided he wasn't interested in asking any more questions just then.  He was going home, no matter what name he had to do it under.
Rogers sat back in the seat and folded his own hands over the desk. “I met someone this weekend who probably shouldn’t have survived what he did, and it got me thinking about all of us,” he waved a hand to take in more than just the four men in the workshop.  “If any of our people went missing, we’d be damned sure we had a body before we wrote them off.”
“Oh sweetheart,”  Tony sighed, shaking his head.  “I grew up with money.  I know those feels.  But what made you come to the Eagle at all?  I mean, look at you --” and here, he ruffled Steve’s hair askew again, just to get a grin out of him.  “You can’t get a drink at Starbucks without finding a barista’s phone number on it, can you?  You hardly need to hang out at a shady queer dive to get a little willing company.”
“Apology accepted,” she said, flicking a glance toward Rogers before making a tentative gesture at his captive.  “May I?”
“May I?”  Steve asked, even as he backed up to kneel between Tony’s spread thighs.  “May I please fuck you, Tony?”
Rogers grinned in reply, and lobbed the bag Clint’s way.  “Yeah, they’re my favorite too.  Hey, can you get the door for me?  I don’t want her to whack her head on the way through.”
Steve's expression was hung halfway between awed and delighted as he watched the chair start rolling gently forward up the hill without the aid of Tony's hands at all.  But he only answered with, "That seems rude to me.  Mind if I walk beside you?"
Steve closed his eyes, tipped his head back to the night as if to sip at higher, colder air, fill his lungs with it, and hold himself together, and yeah, Tony knew that drill.  Breaking the iron bands from the inside sometimes felt like all you could do when that fist closed around your ribs and your mind started rabbitting in circles.  He held on, rubbed his thumb over Steve's knuckles, just as Steve had earlier, grounding the man in the present and hoping he'd stick around for whatever was coming up next.
"Nope," Tony said with a firm headshake as he dug out his phone and unlocked it to engage the chair's Micro RT propulsor. "People being right up close behind my chair makes me cranky.  I'd rather you walk in front."
“Sir, ma’am,”  Daisy said, setting her tablet on the Director’s desk, and activating the holo projector above it.  “I activated the codes for six tracking devices this evening.  Three pinged back, but two of those went out pretty much at once, and haven’t responded since then, but it’s not hard to cripple those nano-gel trackers with a little salt and water.  Even some kinds of soap will drain the batteries down to useless, so...”  She caught a restless movement from Hill in the corner of her eye, and hastily let the details drop.
“Yes, of course,”  Jarvis murmured, making an effort not to remember the smell, the heat, and the icy draught of panic setting in as he realized that he had a two hundred pound mess on his hands, and no idea how to tidy it up.  In a life such as his, it was difficult to assign which moment was luckiest over another, but the moment when Lt. Colonel James Rhodes chose to take his call, and talk him out of turning himself in to the authorities on the spot sat very high in the rankings.  Jarvis did not for one minute regret having killed Stane.  He was then, and remained to this day, ready to face prison for his act of revenge against that duplicitous parasite of a man, but that did not mean Jarvis was in any way
interesting...?  “We don’t have to do anything more than this,” Tony warned, gentling his grip to a coy caress and tickling his thumb across Steve’s balls.  “I’d be willing to keep you here awhile; hard and gasping and desperate to come...” he licked the ear he’d bitten, and pressed a kiss to the sweaty hair at Steve’s temple.  “Bet we could do this all night...”
Then he turned back to Maria’s tombstone, and leaned carefully to brush a few fallen leaves from the top.  “How they did miss you, madam,” he told her, as he always did when he found himself holding this audience with the dead.  “I’m sure it would shock you to see how well you held those two together.”  Because, of course, in her absence, the two Stark men flew instantly, violently, and irrevocably apart.
There was no hiding the expression that bitter memory brought to Tony's face then, so he didn't even try to do so.  "Yeah.  Yeah, I do know those feels."
This time, Fury took the hit.  “We had a lot of other things on our plate when Howard’s son went missing.” he said, and he was probably aiming for patience in his tone, but it was hitting closer to defensive.  “Between Hydra finding you, SHIELD nearly capturing Barnes, and the COO of Stark Industries disappearing under suspicion of illegal arms dealing, we didn’t have the spare resources to go chasing after ghosts just for fun.”
There was a more delicate tracery of scarring that ran a spiral pattern up from the right ankle around the shin, and several deep, ropy pockmarks -- looking more like burns to Steve's battlefield eye, than any crushing damage -- across the span of his right thigh.  The highest was just over the bone of his hip, half hidden in the drape of his shirt tails.  It was this leg Tony had to work the hardest to lift free of its metal cradle.  Both feet were perfect; pale and oddly delicate as the bones spread to take what weight he could put on them, but the right seemed more tentative to Steve, as though he wasn't sure until the ankle weighed in that he'd reached the floor with it.  Nerve damage then.
One thumb press brought up Tasha’s phone, ringing to voicemail at once, like it always did.  “He’s here,”  Clint reported as soon as the beep stopped,  “He’s alone, and uninjured far as I can tell, and ... well hell, that’s the same suit he wore outta here last Friday,” he added as he came around the hedges and caught sight of Rogers unfolding himself from that ridiculous toy car and trying to smooth his clothes down before he reached into the back seat and drew out... a kicking, swearing rucksack.
And to that, Jarvis could only smile, and give the man’s shoulder a steadying pat.  “I will tell him, James.  I cannot guess at what he will say, but I think perhaps it would be good for Tony to have a friend such as you again.”
“Stop,” she said, all teasing gone from her voice as she backed up and sighted the gun on his face.  He stopped, and noted with some interest that it took her several seconds to find that teasing grin or hers again.  “You might have gotten away with it, you know,” she said at length, “I might have just thought you were weird, coming in in Armani to buy tee shirts, jeans, and Chucks, but I wouldn’t have really remembered you.”
Later on, Tony would think back over every detail of the encounter, and realize with a flush of awe, how perfectly Steve had behaved for him -- he’d followed where Tony led with an eager grace, let himself thoroughly enjoy being put to use without greedily pushing for more.  He hadn’t even rutted against the bed as he opened Tony with two, and then three of his thick, long fingers, though his throat hummed and worked with moans, and his back glistened with sweat.  When finally Tony growled “enough,” and slapped a condom into Steve’s other hand, he rose from the bed with his cock standing scarlet, damp, and eager.
The White Eagle had clearly benefitted from the gentrification trend in this part of the city, though it put plenty of effort into making certain that passers-by knew it wasn’t just another hipster-fuelled, craft-beer engine.  A thousand tiny details, from the rainbow flag pen at the Bouncer’s station, to the teddy bear in kink leathers tied suggestively to the security bars over the basement windows stood up to announce that this was a place that put Family first.  Phil appreciated both the message, and the subtlety.  It was hard to be subtle when your movement’s banner was a rainbow.
Which, when you put it like that, Daisy could kind of see what had Hill so pissed off, but still.  If the guy wasn’t comfortable with the fancy clothes, why had they got them for him in the first place?
“Actually, you aren’t,” she mused, tilting her pretty head to the side, as if she meant to draw him, and was checking her perspective.  “The bounty’s out for information leading to the recovery of your corpse.  But I suspect that handing over a live and breathing Captain America will probably loosen SHIELD’s wallet quite a bit.”
“I ... have no idea what that is,”  Steve answered, halfway between adorably bewildered and annoyed.  Then the unmistakable hollow crackle of a loudspeaker announcement echoed over the line, giving it away.
He turned to take his leave, but a gentle hand on Jarvis’ elbow stopped him.  When he turned back, James’ face had gone sober, a hint of worry in his eyes.  “Will you,” he began, then licked his lips and tried again.  “I miss him.  Tony was a real little shit in college, but he was still my best friend, and I miss him.  We were hothead, idiot kids with big mouths and chips on our shoulders back then, and it kills me that I let so many years go by without trying to track him down and make it right. And then one day there you are, kicking that door back open again, bringing Tony back into my world because if I don’t help you get into a war zone, that little shit stirring brat’s gonna get killed.”
The whine turned into a roar, Steve’s thrusts coming harder as Tony grunted, dug his nails into that broad, sweat slick back, and came like a goddamned hurricane.  And even through the storm of it, Tony could feel Steve’s prick pulse inside him, rhythmic answer to his own body’s clasp and drag, as if, though stilled and pressed tight in orgasm, the fucking continued deep inside them both.
“And what, hurt Steve’s feelings so bad he had to run away and sulk?”  James huffed, settling back into the bed again, “Have they
Clint shrugged.  It wasn’t a very likely scenario, given the curvature of the drive and distance from the gate, but smart money would have a metric fucktonne more cars converging on the Stark mansion from every point of the city soon, and they were going to need every inch of driveway space they could get before all was said and sifted.  So, “Sure.  You wanna bring it around?”
"I mean, Jesus, those things are way bigger up close than you'd think, and fifteen, maybe twenty raccoons running around in Grand Central Station at rush hour on a Friday?"  Barton went on, picking up the carafe as though to drink from it directly.  "You couldn't ask for a better distraction."
