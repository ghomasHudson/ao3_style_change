Cameron lifted a tea glass off the side table and tapped it, still wearing that smile that made John oddly irritated.
The teacher blinked in bewilderment. “Um. Okay. Well, what seems to be the problem, officers and professor?”
Knowing how rare it was that Sherlock deigned to eat, John looked up. “Right. What do you want? I could order us some takeaway.”
Sherlock knocked on the door. A blond man, early forties, opened the door cautiously.
Sherlock looked at him, waiting for the rest of the sentence. John was going to mention that they’d barely spent any time together in the last month before realizing he sounded like a clingy girlfriend.
John walked back over to Lestrade, far enough away to be out of earshot among the voices of the forensic team. He lifted his eyebrows to let Lestrade know he was ready to talk.
John was about to walk up to his bedroom when Sherlock stopped him with a gentle hand on his elbow. John had already taken one step up, making them at almost the same height. They were close again, and John was right, he could feel Sherlock’s breath on his face. It smelled like tea.
“Don’t call him mister Alex, John, this isn’t grade school.”
“Ah, fuck, cold,” John winced as they squeezed water on to him. He hurried out to put on his clothes; brown and blue linen in the sturdy shapes of the working class. He poked at the shutter which was swung inward so the birds could get in. If he had any sense, he’d fix it so he could sleep in until the rooster crowed. But it was probably better to be up before the quartermaster, anyway.
John chuckled. “I’m just saying, is all, is that when someone makes someone else feel bad, more often than not, that person gets an urge to prove their worth to the person manipulating them.”
John got in the shower.
“You do, Sherlock, look at the thermometer.” John held it in front of his face, displaying the 102 symbol.
“Nothing hurts, idiot, you’re a metaphor for human thought. Now let's get on with the question at hand.”
Sherlock looked over at him, looking him over with the deduction squint. “What…?”
John let out a sigh of relief when he saw her at the other end of the hall the next week. She gave him a friendly wave.
John whipped around. “Uh, yeah, I suppose. Wasn’t like she was going to go anyway, right?”
“Don’t I know it, princess.”
“Wait, you must tell me your name!” Sherlock shouted, reaching after him just to wince and grab the bruise again.
The majority of the trash was piled around the desk, surrounding a high backed leather desk chair. Sherlock was rifling through the closet, scarf pulled over his nose to block the smell. There was a lacrosse stick propped in the corner, but covered in dust. Other than that, it was hard to really see more about the room since it was so messy.
Sherlock climbed, still in his coat and shoes, on top of the covers. He reached up and pulled back the corner of the comforter to see John’s face. His eyes were red with what was clearly hours of crying, and salty tracks were dried into his cheeks and stained into the pillowcase.
A dental surgeon came through the waiting room doors a short while later, looking pained.
John felt a bolt of discomfort through his stomach at Sherlock squeezing his arm. He was starting to feel guilty, like he wasn’t supposed to see Sherlock when he was so clearly not in control of his facilities. “Okay, Sherlock, stop it now, you have no idea what you’re saying.”
“Seems like you two weren’t just arguing about the case.”
Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement, but otherwise didn’t respond.
“Yes, I am, who are you? Who are these men?” the teacher gestured to Alex and John like they were Sherlock’s hired muscle.
“It’s not-- hard to see, even through your suit.” Sherlock took a deep breath and straightened. “I could teach you, you know.”
“Uh… I think we have some leftover roast chicken?”
The prince smiled at him. John’s stomach dropped out through his feet. The way his hands were shaking now, his heart pounding against his ribs, made John feel a way that no woman he’d ever met could cause.
“Power is the ability to make someone do something they wouldn’t otherwise do. Power to make someone do something just because you tell them, or even hint to them, to do it.”
An hour later, Sherlock and Alex were prowling along the corridor of the high school while John completed the triangle behind them. Bloody long legged bastards, six feet and all, making John scurry like a fucking mouse behind their stupid--
He left work ten minutes late after fighting with the clock-out machine, and started his bus ride back to 221B. He remembered, directly after passing the stop for Boots, that he still needed to buy toothpaste. He got off at the next stop and had to walk a quarter mile back to get it. They were out of the brand he usually used, and he had to pick one that was evergreen instead of winter mint.
Sherlock came over from where he’d been colluding with a forensic aide holding a laptop. “John, let’s go, I found the girl.”
John gently guided him over to a plastic chair. He turned back to the doctor. “Hi, Doctor Watson, I actually work down in,” he gestured toward the general practice area.
A sharp grunt sounded from the other room. John raced to the doorway, but Sherlock had already retrieved the phone from the couch next to his neck.
“He thinks Sherlock should be nicer.”
John was already halfway toward the door to the gardens, running as quickly as he could. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”
“Bending my morals to accommodate someone else seems malapropos to me.”
Can anyone guess who named the skull Billy?
John’s little man briefly left his place at the crank to slide Macfucker’s name further up the shitlist scoreboard.
Sherlock looked at John like he was dumb. “Why would I need a coat when my own body is--” he cut off suddenly, reaching out to grip the doorjamb. John rushed over to quickly support him.
“Whoa, whoa whoa,” the other half replied, leaning back in its chair and throwing its hands up, “Who said anything about love?”
“Still. An attractive sugar daddy. A silver fox.”
John followed, ignoring the father spluttering in confusion and anger.
He definitely heard “No”, though. He was already pulling back his comforter, climbing off the bed to go turn this shitty Scottish Macfucker’s face concave when he stopped abruptly.
Today, he would be preparing the carriage to take the family to the grand ball, the one colloquially referred to as the “Chain and Ball” since the main purpose was to find a wife for the prince. John barely spoke to the house servants in general, but he had no doubt that the tower girl would be pining for some invitation.
Well there you have it folks! Thank you so much for following on this! I am so grateful for your nice comments and kudos!
The nurse had smiled. “I’m great, how are you?”
“Yes, yes, um, I do have a question,” Sherlock said. He stood up to crowd over John, between them only their respective hands holding cups of tea. “Can I have sex with you?”
Thirty minutes to go. Ten.
Selflessly, because Mycroft does know that John is still fully hard. John’s erection is pressed between them. Mycroft turns onto his back, and manoeuvres John on top of him. Mycroft kisses John, opens his legs, and John slides inside of him without much resistance. The feeling is still remarkable. Mycroft allows him to thrust inside of him, saying things like, “God, you’re marvellous, the way that looked…”
Mycroft looks down at William. “It was a special time.” Mycroft says it as if right now isn’t a special time at all. As if it was some far away dream. He swallows. “I am grateful for it.”
He should go to work after this, too. Get out. He’ll make sure that Sherlock gets home, and then he should go, and let him… do what he needs to do.
“No one.” Sherlock says.
Sherlock nods, and watches John open his trousers for him, and do it, stroke him. It doesn’t feel like much. Sherlock is shivering, always cold, when he’s doing this. He can hear the blood thrumming in his ears.
Sherlock comes back fully dressed, apparently he took him at his word. He’s even wearing shoes.
Anthea sidles up to him, and says discreetly, “Parenting skills coming in handy, sir?”
He had instructed Anthea to only contact him during the wedding if there was an issue of the utmost importance. She had not. And because of it, he had a full day to focus solely on his family. Mycroft is exceedingly glad that he was able to do so.
Soo Lin and Molly used the copper wiring for welding on their sculpture as well. They made some sort of animal skull – a deer, maybe?
John sounds distant as he says, “Oh wow, yes!” and thrusts even harder. Mycroft hangs his head and is nearly pushed off his knees with the force of him. He enjoys those strokes even more, being fully taken, the remnants of his orgasm still shuddering through him. John stutters in his thrusts, then makes a low sound as he comes inside of him.
Mycroft does just that, then he puts William into his carrier and, with a smile that he hopes portrays his gratitude to both of them, leaves.
He will most likely have months of this, several cycles before he even is pregnant.
Best Christmas ever, John said.
“Ducks!” She says. “Big, big bird! Bird eating.”
They choose, “Raz... You are doing the barber shop pin-up.”
They have chosen to do graffiti with a heavy black outline, along with flames along the edges of the car. The work itself is nothing extraordinary, Sherlock believes. There are plenty of car shops in London who could accomplish exactly this.
John points out, “You have freckles.”
Afterwards, Mycroft puts Violet to bed, and then stretches out on his own bed with his legs up, trying to relieve some of the strain on his lower back. He briefly worries, and the thought comes accompanied with a small tensing of his stomach - back ache, what if it is… No. Mycroft calms his mind purposefully.
Sherlock catches the humming, and looks him over questioningly. John shrugs.
He can’t hear Violet, she’s probably asleep, but he can hear Sherlock say, “…then Angelo rang the doorbell, and he had John’s cane.”
Mycroft lets him in, and leads him to the library. John says, while they walk, “Sherlock told her your favourite, so, um, it’s a Battenberg. If that’s right?”
Sherlock goes up the stairs first, and he uses Violet as a distraction, because Mycroft can hear the soft cry from Miss Hooper, “Oh! What a cutie!”
He nearly died there.
“Sherlock?” Irene asks, “Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat’ by Van Gogh. How did you find this to tattoo?”
John doesn’t have the faintest clue what Sherlock is about, asking to marry him. He honestly thought he was joking at first.
Mycroft walks into Baker Street only to be treated to a scene of utter domesticity, as is the standard these days.
He’s sitting there, holding a huge sheet of paper.
John, after a few more moments of directing his pleasure, releases him and says, “Come up here?”
Since he has not done this often, he fears that he does not do it well.
There
Sherlock wonders how he knows. Then again, Mycroft always can tell. He admits, “We have an open relationship.”
for them, or their lives. Sherlock never has. The work itself is all that matters, his superior artistry. Not the subject.
Anthea notices. She asks him, privately, when they are back in the office, “Everything all right, sir?” There is something expectant in her expression. She thinks she knows.
that there’s a limit somewhere. That Sherlock finally put down a rule about something, that he’s drawing lines. It means that it actually matters who John fucks. That it finally isn’t all the same to Sherlock.
, John!”
Sherlock thinks he is used to it, the fear. That there’s nothing that truly matters as long as John is here, as long as they can reach for something familiar. But they don’t quite get there, yet.
John looks at him closely.
And Mycroft doesn’t reply again.
And all their couplings have been so riled up in heat and touch, before, that this feels like a whole different world.
you to touch me, I always want you to, you have no idea how much I do, I’m just… I’m trying here.” John laughs a little. “It’s been three months, Sherlock.”
. The scars have swollen notably and are distorting the image - there is nothing he could have done to prevent that. He did place Boudica’s face high enough so that the scars’ distortion would be under the flowers.
, no.
They hurry to Sherlock’s shop while Sherlock asks quickly, “You have a full back piece, as well as your chest and stomach?”
Sherlock’s body rebels, it throbs and whines like a caged animal. His mind feels shaken, unreal, but he
It’s never-ending, the bits and pieces that prove amusing to John. Sherlock says, “Hmm, fine.”
“One more thing.” Jim takes over. He seems obnoxiously pleased with himself. “As this week’s theme is audacity…” He looks at all of them. “You will be each other’s canvasses.”
John makes a low sound in the back of his throat, and moves his hand over his erection, obviously enjoying this. “Am I?”
just helping out, then? John thinks about that while he positions his stencil onto the client’s thigh. It could be good to have an ally in this competition. And certainly someone like Sherlock Holmes - he’s bound to make it ‘till the end.
In the distance, John laughs again.
Mycroft wraps his hand around John’s cock again, then leans over until his breath is close - John can feel the heat of it.
Sherlock frowns. “We can’t bond.”
And then, strangely, a bottle of whisky.
John shifts. Sherlock’s legs have opened to lean closer to John, so it has the effect of John’s arse and lower back pushing against Sherlock’s crotch. Sherlock ignores it, and sucks a small circle on the reddening, wet skin of John’s neck.
Mycroft gets up, a faint feeling in his body. A disconnect, as if he is nothing but a head walking on stilts.
She gives them both a hug later and whispers, “Thank you, boys.”
And the soldier touched him in return - because he is that kind of man, Sherlock suspects. The kind who believes in fairness. But it was mid-day, and Sherlock was disappointingly sober. He was somewhat aroused, but not sufficiently.
Not before he gets to have more of this.
“Well, thank you.” Mycroft says it easily.
“Yeah?”
Mycroft’s house is dark, but Sherlock has a key. He uses it, disarms the alarm, and as soon as he opens the door he can already smell a hint of it - baby, milk, a sweet scent, something powdery - it curls on the air.
He is almost cruelly surprised. She is alive then.
When John does open the website again, he has over a dozen messages. Some who recognise him from his profile picture. Some plain offers for sex. John doesn’t reply to those. Although he doesn’t delete them, either.
“I am not working.” It is none of Sherlock’s business if he is, in fact, but he is willing to let that slide at the wild way that Sherlock seems to be looking him over. Was he genuinely afraid? Why?
It never happens. They don’t fight.
Mycroft glances at Violet - her bright, beautiful spirit.
Then says, “You can delete the file now.” The one Mycroft has on Mummy. The detailed list of everything she did wrong.
After an hour of useless wandering, John takes them into a warm coffee shop that Sherlock remembers from a stakeout years ago. John says something like, “I liked the coffee here,” but Sherlock is barely listening, trying to think it through. Why a message? Why send a message if the corpse has nothing whatsoever interesting about his death. Was it truly just about the note itself?
Mycroft does, and John laughs into his neck. “God, sorry, it’s just been…” Well, since last time. Which hasn’t even been two weeks, but it’s been a frustrating, heated two weeks.
John briefly strokes over his arm - his fingertips catching the small hairs there in a rush of sensation - and then lets go. “Violet doesn’t.”
Sherlock doesn’t tell him. He just holds on harder and feels the rumble of John’s voice under his body. Smells him. And tries not to feel too hopeful.
Sherlock spends some hours in his mind palace until his body has calmed down and the wild thrumming has evened out. He curls up around John in bed that night and presses his nose to John’s neck.
Sherlock obeys and moves just like that, in slow, deep thrusts. John closes his eyes. He can feel rushes of goose bumps appear all over his skin. It’s not even his cock, it’s all of him, a full-body sensation of pressure, John can barely breathe with how good it is.
Sherlock had noticed it earlier in the day. He wrote in the notebook they always pass around with each child, ‘temperature 37.5, fussy at 7.10PM’. Mycroft had noted it, but not truly worried.
Mycroft agreed to take the morning off from work. There is not much left to plan, but he had assumed that John or Sherlock might require his assistance in some way or other.
Mycroft tilts his neck so Sherlock can reach, and he licks, then bites it.
Mycroft’s stony humiliation made him refrain from making any more jokes, but it felt pretty great to have it happen right in 221B. John had been worried, sure, but mostly convinced that it would be fine. Eight months is early, but not unusual.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, and dutifully replies, “These things just
Sherlock’s heat was... well, the way all heats tend to be. Sherlock’s scent was like a blanket covering the flat. John could hear Sherlock groaning and moaning in his room and moving on the bed in quick thrusts. Sherlock whimpered and groaned. Begged John to sedate him, to make it stop.
They have never done this together.
The gates are still open, but they’ll be shut soon, so he’ll have to hurry. John walks over the gravel, scanning the trees and the water as well as the expanse of grass.
Yes, Mycroft despises posing for pictures. He always has. Sherlock notes, “We don’t have a single image with the five of us.”
It’s no longer a mid-life crisis, it’s graduated to… just shit.
There’s a pause. A slight shift, and then Sherlock replies, “Milk.”
Sherlock bonds to Mycroft the next day. They haven’t been making a lot of time for it, and they do need to be careful of that, so Sherlock tries to linger longer than he usually would.
Sherlock still feels shaken up by it by the time the nanny brings Violet, and he leaves her with John, just in case there genuinely is something wrong with him.
Predictably, Mycroft’s eyebrows rise. “I don’t think that’s quite what John intends, I believe it is rather more…” his mouth pulls, “to do with biology, as you suggested.”
It’s the right thing to do. John’s not sure what else he would have wanted him to say. Or well, maybe he is:
“All right.” Mike looks between them and gives him a quick, private smile as he says, “John, you are working with Sherlock.”
, sir?” as if she could not imagine any possible scenario in which he would wish for this.
Sherlock would take her as a client himself, if he had the choice. Which makes it even more surprising that while Bainbridge and Raz deliberate, they explicitly glance at her and then look his way. Sherlock calmly returns their gaze. If they believe that this will throw him, then they know
The sound of his voice alone is enough to curl over Sherlock’s spine and arouse him even further. “Leave me alone.”
Sherlock faces him. “Be with him.”
It’s nearly eleven by the time Mycroft has a bath himself and gets to bed. He is aware that if he were to attempt to sleep now, he would do nothing more than dwell on it, so he takes some paperwork with him to bed, piles the pillows behind his aching back, and works.
Sherlock forces himself to walk to his workspace and leave John behind - both of them need to focus on preparing for their clients. But the teasing tone of their conversation continues to play on his mind.
“Janine, you are up last.”
Mycroft wonders how much John has had to drink. He doesn’t seem to be overly drunk.
He mostly ignores it.
And then the slow un-tensing. John falls back and leans into him as a heavy weight.
Mycroft knows this to be his cue, as Sherlock looks at him expectantly as well. “I had the first sonogram today.” Mycroft reaches into his inner jacket pocket and takes an envelope containing the picture. It is only a black and white, grainy image, but he hands it to Sherlock. John sits down on the sofa, close to Sherlock, and looks, too.
Sherlock offers into the silence, “Extrapolating from the latest sonogram, the baby weighs approximately five pounds.”
The night before the implantation, Mycroft lies in bed with nervousness creeping over his skin.
seems surreal still - Sherlock can’t hear that word without feeling a strange thrill.
John’s moved enough that Sherlock can see John’s penis, still half-hard, with wetness at the tip that catches the light.
John, after seeing the minutes tick away, says, “Never mind.”
He knew he was pregnant with Violet from a home pregnancy test, and perhaps there was some charm in that moment, but this time around all he truly wants is certainty.
The cameras pull out of the shot, and he is allowed to leave while the other artists further project some sort of emotion at Bainbridge’s elimination.
They’re good, too, these days. Close, really. Friends - obviously.
Greg asks, smiling, “You
Sherlock remembers Mycroft and John sitting together at Christmas for most of the evening, but this time John sits by Lestrade and chats with him, leaving Molly to awkwardly talk to Mycroft. She asks him how he’s been, and then falls silent.
John looks up with concern. “You doing all right?”
He makes sure he’s up when John gets breakfast and leaves for work, just to see him.
It is hardly sexy.
he is, Sherlock, I would never contest that.” Mycroft looks at him, trying to underline how sincere he is. “You must know that.”
. “Ill-advisable. The removal of body parts.”
Sherlock eyes him, and says, low enough that John does not hear, “Can you take her early next Wednesday?”
The footsteps outside hesitate. Sherlock believes he might pound on the door or shout at them.
It’s a young bloke, maybe twenty at most. He looks between them questioningly, and then very earnestly does not speak. Sherlock will probably throw him out, John thinks, considering he just came.
John seems normal as he takes off his jacket, but then he looks back, and it’s right there, heavy and tense between them. “Hi.”
But Sherlock looks him straight in the eye. “You know when, John.”
John almost has the door closed, when Sherlock’s voice says, clear enough that John can’t pretend he didn’t hear it. “You didn’t touch me. Yesterday.”
It’s a question that could be answered in many ways. But Mycroft should take himself out of this equation, he does not belong in it, and he refuses to cause Sherlock any more pain than he already did. “Then you need to discuss that with Sherlock.”
After a while, the door opens, and they break apart.
Sherlock knows that if he says, ‘leave it,’ John will do that, and it will be okay. But it’s been a long time since he’s come. That’s why he responded like that to Mycroft as well. It’s been weeks, he should. John would like to see it, probably. So Sherlock sits up a bit.
And Sherlock says, maybe stupidly, but he can feel it so clearly that saying it won’t change a single thing, “I love you.”
He calculated well. He has only been waiting for three minutes and fifty seconds when the lift pings and John walks out.
He eats enough to be pleasantly full, and on the way back, in a regular cab this time, they sit close. John thinks he could probably die quite happily around now.
John’s eyes linger on his, and then he looks away.
Sherlock doesn’t seem at all bothered. “Yes, just a two-minute waltz.”
“Yes, he does so love to be...” Mycroft says the word very precisely, “...difficult.”
The deep baritone is a surprise. John swallows heavily.
When Sherlock hears the lock of the outside door, and then the creaking of the steps, he wants to throw the door open, but he doesn’t. John might not want him to comment on it at all. But as soon as John walks in, none of those considerations seem to matter. He seems small tonight.
She nods. “Baby William. My brother. He’s home.”
John finishes cleaning up, pulls his pants up, and finds his laptop. He needs to write a blog post about the vampire case. Before he starts though, John texts Mycroft. “Sorry that got interrupted... J”
It doesn’t take too long. John starts moving, he moves his hips back and forth, pushes himself into his hand, too.
Raz takes his phone out. “He on Youtube?”
John picks up on it, saying, “You’re getting along better now, aren’t you?” And then, with a grin, “Maybe bonding wasn’t that bad of an idea.”
John can feel
It looks nice enough though. John can see a blue sky with some small white clouds through the window. They dressed Violet in shorts and a top, so she can play.
In the morgue, John watches Sherlock move from corpse to corpse with the air of a child unwrapping presents on Christmas morning. John shares an amused look with Molly.
Sherlock quickly sends a text to Mycroft. “We’re on a case. Violet at Mrs. Hudson’s. S”
Mycroft is saved from replying when Molly Hooper comes over to ask her husband, “You want to go to bed? My feet hurt.”
It only lasts a moment. The path’s too crowded, and Sherlock has to let go to walk first, then Mycroft steps aside so Violet can walk in front of them. But John can feel it resonate. The sun’s bright, they’re all out here, and it’s…
Sherlock knows what he thought. That Mycroft was different.
John can hear Violet say, “Simba is going to be king!”
“Yes?”
John laughs, tiredly. “God, I’m done.” He glances at Sherlock and says, “No idea how people still have sex after this.”
She moves back, and takes the file with a sigh. “I’m sorry, no.” She shows him the results of his latest blood work.
Mycroft catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror as he walks into the bathroom. He is dressed in a sharply tailored suit, holding William, with the nappy bag hanging from his shoulder. He looks older, these days. Tired. But he can see the mild flush on his cheeks from dancing, as well as deduce the subtle signs to his suit that he has been wearing it all day whilst also holding children.
Sherlock says, while he zips up the overalls - they looks ridiculous on him - “I wanted to work with you.”
They have William over for a few hours every day, and at night Sherlock goes to Mycroft’s to help. Until Mycroft puts an end to that, and then they switch nights, either Violet with them, or William.
Mycroft looks as if he hasn’t slept at all.
The nurse asks, “You were scheduled for a C-section?”
He wanted to use all of his leave, first, and then take an extended leave of absence. But he barely has any days left, all they need is another good case and he’s run out for the year. Or for Violet to get sick, or Mycroft to need bed rest, or any combination of things.
Sherlock stamped back and forth in frustration, “So, I’m not allowed to ask a question?”
As Sherlock quietly left the room, he noticed the wheelchair backed in a corner, overwhelmed by the situation Sherlock tried to compose himself, after a few attempts he strode over to the couch where John lay. Sherlock didn’t bother to wipe the tear that slid down his cheek as he took John’s ice cold hands in his own, “Oh God, John, why did it have to be you?”
Laura ran her fingers through Sherlock’s curls as she purred. “Of course you do my pet.”
“I don’t have time to explain. Are John, Anderson and the baby okay?”
John’s breath caught in his throat. He felt dizzy whenever Sherlock looked at him like that.
When Sherlock next awoke it was to the sound of John’s voice whispering in his ear. “Sherlock, I love you.”
Another pause. “Sherlock, oh Sherlock…”
“Sherlock, who is Mary again?”
You put her at ease. “It’s alright, Mrs. Hudson, we’ll take care of him.”
“Anderson wants a snack and I think he is in a lot of pain. Is it time for one of his pills?”
“You’ve probably blocked it out. It was a terrible day.”
“Prolonged good-byes will only jeopardize his treatment program,” she said clasping Sherlock’s arm. “You can see him in 30 days.”
Sherlock was about to push John further when Mycroft grabbed his arm. “Sherlock, stop now. I think your display of passion in the desert was enough don’t you?”
“Room Service,” a nasal voice intoned.
My robe fluttered open as John squeezed his jean covered legs into my side. “Why, Sherlock, why?”
The edge of Sherlock’s Keffiyeh blew in the wind as he stared down at John. He then blinked and looked away. “You are quite correct, Doctor. Perhaps…”
I nod, then you come forward and hold me in your arms, careful not to squish the child between us. Her small fingers curl around the buttons on my coat. I want to weep, but I don’t. My arms and legs begin to tremble betraying me. I am not invincible. When you release me I feel woozy.
Before John could answer Sherlock replied in a clipped tone. “No, but please don’t ramble.”
John leaned over the seat. “It’s okay I’m a doctor. His blood sugar is low and ….”
After I release, and Anderson swallows my load with his usual relish, I slide between his legs, finishing him off with the tip of my tongue, his come in my mouth a lovely pre-tea snack. Then like a choregraphed dance, you slide out of Anderson, I slide to the floor, then you and Anderson pull me back onto the bed. Like dogs we roll around in our own scents, while I sniff and taste you both.
His eyes teared up and all he could utter was, “John…please.”
The next day, John determined he would somehow find the couple that he had overheard last night, for the sooner the case was solved the sooner Sherlock would be by his side again. John looked around him in frustration wondering if any of the passing crewmembers were Sherlock; however they had both agreed that Sherlock wouldn’t contact John on the ship unless it was an emergency. If such an occasion arose, John would order a Brandy Alexander Cocktail from room service with extra nutmeg. It was tempting to wheel back to their cabin immediately and order said drink; however Sherlock would be quite cross.
A few metallic clicks latter and I am in Anderson’s flat. I expect the inside to be as dismal as the outside and I am surprised when it is not. Though the décor is sparse, the place is clean. I smirk, looking at the freshly polished kitchen floors.
Their plan to take Laura down had failed. As if reading his mind Laura gestured to a group of Bedouins and barked orders to them in their native tongue. When one of them approached Sherlock and attempted to take John from him, Sherlock pulled out a gun. “Stop, Sherlock, let the Bedouin take him to a tent where he can be cared for properly.” Laura ordered.
John smiled absent mindedly and said, “I’m fine, just fine…”
An shook her head in fear. “No, the Golem have been forcing us to do their bidding. If we refuse they will kill again, just like they did the baker.”
I ignore Lestrade and forge ahead. I push past two uniformed police offers, ready to bay like a hound. I am so intent on my quarry that I fail to notice the crazed figure that charges towards me, screaming obscenities. My intellect is no match against the fight or flight adrenaline that causes my body to freeze in place. I wait for the cutting blow and am surprised when another figure rushes forward, throwing me to the ground. Who has taken my place with the grim reaper? A shot rings out and my would-be assailant drops, letting his machete clatter to the floor.
“I need you to help me remember something, or rather someone.”
I turn to see you in the doorway, holding baby Alice. She looks adorable in a little white dress. It’s dotted with red hearts and I smile. You are dressed in black trousers and a red shirt. I frown, attempting to recall why you are both dressed up. You laugh. “It’s Valentine’s Day, Sherlock and we are all going out for a fine meal.”
Sherlock nodded and looked out the window as trees, buildings and cars rushed by and Sherlock’s heart felt heavy, for with each tree, each car and each building that whipped by  he was being carried further away from John.
I barely hear our pursuers as they walk by and say, “Jesus, fucking disgusting bun boys.”
You come into the room, God, how I am aging you dearest John. I don’t put on a robe I just lounge on the chair. You pause for a second your eyes clinically observing my naked body as a Doctor would. Wait; hold on, John you do know exactly where to look. Your eyes roam over my body like a hungry predator, pausing to look on my pubescent tree and its fruit. A thrill of electricity runs through my body, I spasm, jiggling the fruit. You stare. You frown. You lick your lips. You then look away. I inwardly sigh with relief and disappointment; there will be no cherry picking today. I am glad I am disciplined for the thought of you tasting my forbidden fruit is enough to send me into a pre-orgasmic fit.
And state secrets or cases, one smile from that baby and both of them stop what they’re doing to look at her.
Mycroft had been certain that he would not get involved in their relationship, but he has. It could be doable, as John says, but the potential complications are not the only reason why Mycroft must resist. He admits, “John, I believe Sherlock is mistaken.”
Sherlock finds the hug deeply unpleasant. Even more so because Molly is wearing her autopsy visor and it bumps into the side of his face, but he makes certain to tell her, “I have always appreciated your support in matters of the heart, Molly.”
“Mycroft?” John asks quickly.
Ah. Sherlock has tattooed over scars on several occasions. Most notably on his own forearms.
John frowns. “No... Sherlock.” He half-laughs, as if it was a joke. “It’s not
Her wild curls, that he tries to comb down every day, and then gives up as a lost cause. Mycroft’s own hair has some well-tamed waves as well, but nothing like hers.
John says, “He wanted to help you plan it.”
John sits down, and Sherlock lets Mycroft and John talk, something about the case, he doesn’t listen.
After that, there is a picture that John picked as his favourite - it’s a shot of Sherlock turned away as he feeds William. The line of his arm around William looks protective, Sherlock thinks. There is a shot from the same scene from further away as well, the bright, populated mess of the party, and then Sherlock and William to the side as a separate, quiet tableau.
Nothing to keep Mycroft from realising, at times with a bit of a shock, that he is pregnant. Truly - pregnant.
Sherlock scans the portrait. She seems healthy. Some make-up. A bright smile. “Delusional parents only see what they want to see. They ignored the signs.”
It’s three in the afternoon. There is some bleak February winter light falling through the windows. Mycroft was resting, supposedly, but John got his text and…
He’s bored.
He wouldn’t have sex for months, and then it would all become too much, and he went back. He always circled back when he was crawling with feeling and aching for the distraction of another human being.
Sherlock blinks at him. “What?”
Like a lot of the stuff that Sherlock says, John feels like he ought to argue that statement. But it’s more fun to just reply, “People are shit, really.”
There’s a pause. John stares at the screen, not sure whether he wants a reply or not.
Then John starts making noises that they can invite them over, if Mycroft is up to it, and no, they can’t. Eventually, Sherlock texts Mycroft, admitting defeat: “Bond more difficult to break than anticipated. Stay away. SH.”
John wakes up with a hard-on.
“Sherlock’s going to be good at it, I think.” Being an uncle. Judging by how much he’s reading now, he’s taking it seriously, for sure. “The baby, he’ll like it.”
The images from this evening’s episode are still fresh in John’s mind. Cut together and edited like these shows are, he’d thought that maybe it wouldn’t be there, whatever
John looks at him as if he would like to argue more, and Mycroft - as much as he has let John see him while in the throes of passion - would like nothing more than to show him the door in this moment.
It’s time, he thinks. It’s time to move on, because if he doesn’t do it now, he never will. He’ll get lulled into this, and he’ll be a bachelor with a non-partner and a non-child forever.
John opens it. It’s a watch. A nice one, actually, very nice.
He walks to the bathroom. But John isn’t done. John yells after him, “Yes, it does!”
John laughs, out loud.
He looks at Violet as Sherlock walks off, but he doesn’t stop them. Sherlock turns the light off on his way out as a silent command.
John’s got no idea what he’s going to do.
Violet is indeed tired - she doesn’t want to eat much and whines though her bath. Mycroft puts her to bed an hour earlier than he usually would, and she falls asleep within minutes.
“This is a perspective challenge, and that’s wacked out of proportion. AGAIN.” Jim seems exasperated.
“It’s cold!” She squeals, entirely enthusiastic. Mycroft envies her simple joy sometimes.
“Yes.” Sherlock says it easily.
Mycroft carefully avoids John for most of the week. He only runs into him again a couple of days before Violet’s birthday party.
Mycroft sounds more awake than John would have given him credit for when he replies, “I am wondering…”
Sherlock hears Mycroft say, with an upturned nose, “John, please be advised, you smell of
Figures. John likes her already. “So, what was her name then?”
John actually feels pretty good about deciding not to go there anymore.
Sherlock walks over the Jubilee Bridge, and he makes it to the South Bank before he sits down on a bench. Violet is awake, but she has been mostly quiet since he left the flat. She likes being carried, something about the up and down motion when he walks.
Yes. Sherlock believes him. That’s why he needs to say this.
Right after, there is a rare text from Mycroft.
Mycroft has deduced something though, because he asks, quietly, “What is it, Sherlock?”
John.” He raises his, so that John is shielded from the rain as well.
He collects a respirator and instructs, “We should experiment with various spray patterns on paper before committing to the wall.”
“You don’t have anything yet?” John had half imagined he’d be tucking this tattoo behind Sherlock’s knees, too. Or on his upper leg or something. Not a prime spot.
John smiles brightly, and Sherlock wants to shake him and tell him that no reasonable human being
John sits upright. What? He looks between them.
“Yeah, well.” A brief flicker of sadness glances over John’s eyes. “Can’t have it all.”
Violet’s answering “Bears!” is highly satisfied.
“Yes?” Sherlock says. He looks a bit confused, but John isn’t sure whether it’s actual embarrassment, or if he’s just putting it on for him.
“You’ll be working in teams of two.”
John runs his hand over his face and then eyes him. “You sure you want to know?”
Mycroft opens the letter while mentally still running through contingency plans and possible further complications.
– lowers them so Sherlock can see what he’s on about.
Instead, he says, “I’ve got a…” date? No, that’s not it, is it? “I’m seeing Mycroft. Tonight.” John’s not sure if Sherlock will be annoyed by that. “We’re not going out or anything. I’ll go to his at ten. That okay?” John’s willing to call it off. He doesn’t
He’s nervous. He’s not sure why, exactly, but it’s rippling in his stomach. After that first burst of texts early this morning, Sherlock’s quieted down and John hasn’t heard from him. He’s busy, probably. John looks at his phone and doubts on whether to send him something. They shouldn’t talk, right? That’s how it goes, usually, before a wedding. He’s got no idea why, though.
When he walks into the lobby, John looks around, but Sherlock isn’t waiting there today. Not that Sherlock
And then it is the day of the party.
Mycroft arranged an appointment for John with one of his personal tailors that does great work in a slightly more casual style. Mycroft had intended to be there, but then there was an issue with a Brussels terrorist cell, and he was unable to make the appointment. He called and offered his apologies.
Sherlock answers automatically. “I read Chemistry at Cambridge.”
John takes him out properly then, to a nice restaurant, and Sherlock admits that out of all of his birthdays, this one was probably one of the more bearable. It makes John smile.
He has received massages from qualified staff that were undoubtedly much better than John massaging his foot, but it is the expression on John’s face and the care in his eyes which makes this impossible to endure.
But it’s not the same, is it, because John’s parents were shit. “It’s not... It’s nothing like Violet though. She’ll be fine on her own.” She’ll never have to do without anything at all, will she? John looks at Mycroft. Did Sherlock actually manage to make him feel guilty about having only one? It sounds like it. “Really, she’ll be fine. She’s happy.” John’s rarely seen a more loved kid.
John takes the kids to the living room, feeds William a bottle, pours Violet a glass of juice, and reads her a story.
They are safe.
. John knows he’s just playing. Violet is right here, looking at them in glee.
Perhaps Sherlock understood that so easily because he himself knows the effects of it only too well. Perhaps that is why Sherlock would give his permission, because he does not want this suffering for anyone else.
John takes his phone again, goes to bed, and instead of saying what he’d want to, something like ‘Why does it all need to be so fucking complicated?’ John tells Mycroft, “Good night. JW”
It’s never been a hard job, really. He just sort of wades through most days, one person after the next. John sees anywhere between twenty and fifty people a day with a variety of symptoms. It can be interesting occasionally. But the truth is that anything he even cares to hear about is rare, because it’s never just symptoms, it’s always
John is still angry, too. It’s in his shoulders, in his sighs, in the edge to his voice. But Sherlock knows what John wants from him. He takes a series of cases, anything that sounds remotely interesting. Sherlock drags John along from one crime scene to the next, because it makes John feel alive. It’s what John needs, so Sherlock provides it.
John looks around. “You need a bowl?” He’s not about to clean vomit off the floorboards, it’s Sherlock’s turn. Forever, in fact - after that one time with the bile. There’s still a bleached spot on the woodwork.
John hesitantly walks closer, his cane gently tapping on the linoleum floor. When he’s near enough, Sherlock’s eyes flick up at him. “You are wondering why I am here.”
He looks at Sherlock again. And he just... John can feel his heart beat in his throat enough that he’s nearly nauseous.
He returns only when both Violet and Mycroft are already gone.
“Does that matter when the bird’s
John seems amused. “Well, then.” He takes a step to the side. “Teach me a thing or two.”
She is taking the first steps towards becoming a person, and it is as if he hardly knows how it happened. She still is a small baby when he feeds her a bottle, when she has fallen asleep in his arms. But then she is energetic as well, she plays and screeches with laughter, she has a sense of humour, of curiosity. Mycroft finds his eyes on her often, wondering who she will become.
“Okay.” John seems calm about it. “Okay, we’ll see how that goes, then?”
“Yes.” Mycroft can feel some emotion at this, some sense of it being too close, really. He has not allowed anyone to touch him like this except his doctor, but more than that, it is good to see the surprised joy on Sherlock’s face. Mycroft lets go of Sherlock’s hand, and Sherlock leaves it there for another moment, as if reluctant to say goodbye to the sensation.
Mycroft looks a little stunned.
He’s not prepared for her to ask again, when John is trying not to fall asleep in her ridiculously soft bed, “You want to stay over?”
Sherlock thinks about it. He could nose John’s neck, and search for a scent there. The urge to do so is there often, he always pushes it away, considers it useless, but he could. John is not an omega, of course. It wouldn’t do anything. But if John wants him to...
Mycroft, for the first time in weeks, makes it out of the door without having to face a tantrum.
“I like that,” Soo Lin says.
John smiles. “Morning, you.”
Sherlock’s reply makes him shiver. “Yes.”
He’s lying; he is going straight to bed.
When it’s time to change, John drops Violet on top of Sherlock, who seems surprised that there’s suddenly a toddler on his chest. “Here, I’m going out.”
Mycroft instantly agrees. Yes, it should be John’s news to share.
He’d choose it a million times over.
Getting his pregnant body out of bed is a mission that takes at least a full minute of waiting for the dizziness to recede before standing. He dresses first, and only then wakes Violet and focuses on her, so that she is at least dressed and fed by the time the nanny takes over. Mycroft does not need to do this, but he already has so little time with her, and he believes in the power of routine. He wants to be the person who puts her to bed in the evenings and wakes her in the mornings.
John laughs, feeling something raw at the emotion of it. Oh, all the times he’s wanted to hug him.
John brings it up with Sherlock. They’re sitting in the living room, both watching Violet play with some marbles. They roll loudly on the wooden floor, and she’s lying on her stomach, fascinated by it. Sherlock seems relaxed, sitting back against his chair, so John dares to ask him, “Sherlock, your parents... they still don’t know about Violet?”
“Would you mind if I check on Violet first?”
John was asleep. Or he was lying on his bed while considering the idea of sleep when he checked the website just one more time.
Sherlock is pleased. The last case was finally interesting enough to keep him busy for days. The solution was something he’d never heard of before, and he could have thanked the chemist granddaughter all day for being smart and interesting and not just smothering the countess in her sleep the old-fashioned way - finally, a murderer with brains!
“Hi.” John’s eyes are bright.
Sherlock lights a cigarette, and when John holds out his hand he wordlessly receives one as well.
John says things. Excited, happy things, but Sherlock isn’t listening. He can’t speak straight away. There’s a block in his throat he can’t swallow around.
John nods tiredly. He can feel the weight of all of this piling on top of him now. He made it to the final. This is what he wanted to do, but now he made it this far, he can’t be sure it’ll be enough.
Sherlock sits at the top table with a glass of champagne in front of him and a spread of food on his plate.
“I want a barber shop theme pin-up... on my bum.” Christ.
.” John breathes.
John sits in his chair with Violet on his lap. She is listening attentively as he reads her a story.
Anthea seems surprised to see him. “Sir!” She looks him over. “You did not need to come for the trade agreements, they are being taken care of.”
John replies, “You need to work all night? Sleep some if you can. JW”
He doesn’t hear anything, so he opens it.
But now it is an entirely different thought process, because Mycroft knows, completely and intimately, what he would be choosing.
Sherlock is waiting for him in the lobby.
John meets Sherlock’s eyes. “London?”
Two hours later, Sherlock hasn’t replied to a single message.
In reply, Sherlock
John looks at Sherlock. He’s still sitting on the floor, bent over his work - he likely didn’t even hear the announcement. He’s definitely not going to stop, so John takes a sarnie and a cuppa and brings it over to him.
Sherlock
Sherlock sits down on the cold pavement and picks at his sandwich.
No, John lowers his shoulders and keeps his mouth shut, as instructed.
Back to normal.
Now he’s said it, he wants to get on with it. John reaches up to the side table and finds the lube - he’s doing this himself. Sherlock doesn’t comment when John lies flat on his back and reaches down. He applies the lube, pushes in with one finger and spreads it around, then adds a second finger and widens them in a scissoring motion. It’s easy. Practiced. Medical standard.
- Sherlock can hear an echo of Mary’s voice. But the basics are the same as they always are. Lie still, let it happen. All they want is the upper hand - everyone always does.
She seems like she had fun, but when Mycroft comes to pick her up that evening, John says, “We’re not doing that again until she’s older. Also, don’t buy her a pet any time soon, she might kill it.
so much. It felt like a betrayal, too. That Sherlock didn’t try to talk him out of it, not once.
“I really like these legs, the way that they’re shaded, the position, I think they’re beautiful.” Irene smiles. “I like the way you coloured this piece as well. It’s got a very soft look in the dress. A strong tattoo, Molly.”
To prove his love? No. There is nothing he can do. Nothing.
Sherlock looks at the desk.
John knew this was coming, and he fights the instinct to shrug and say ‘whatever you want’, because that’s what he did with Mary. Back then, it was Sherlock frantically planning all of it, and it was a perfectly fine wedding, romantic and all that, but it hadn’t felt a thing like it was his. So John says the first thing that comes to mind, “I want it in London.”
with arousal. Mycroft says, lowly, aware that he has wanted this for so very long, “You can do it, John.”
John eagerly strokes his cock, close…
Mycroft clarifies, “To your Christmas party?” Mycroft looks at Sherlock, who simply nods. He is not pretending that John made him, instead it seems to be quite genuine.
It wasn’t fun, a case without John. It was intense, Sherlock was jumping from one thread of thought to the next, being brilliant and amazing and on fire. But it didn’t matter. All of his deductions, all of his greatness - without John it barely mattered at all.
“Yeah.” Bainbridge seems nervous. John doesn’t fancy being sent home on episode one either, especially on a traditional piece. But he’s thinking he’ll be all right. There’s much worse work in the room today than what he did. Some of these pieces are completely wrong for the style.
It is hardly a full bonding, but Sherlock lets go and seems satisfied. “Violet, time for clothes.”
John smiles widely at that. “
John says, “Want me to order something to eat? And we can give it a try while we wait?”
And then he pulls his hand back, still smiling, but there is something darker about him.
Sherlock stiffens the way he always does when touched.
Sherlock selects a sandwich as well and picks at it while he waits for John to finish his meal. John chews heartily, as if he enjoys this. John’s hands are strong around his sandwich, and John’s mouth is working around the bread. John’s throat constricts as he places his mug of tea to his lips and swallows.
But as much as he did foresee the physical discomfort, the exhaustion is worse than he had allowed for. He gets through the day in a wavering, undefined state, simply to collapse into bed again. He finds it disconcerting. He needs his mind, and he needs the control it brings, as well. He ups security on Sherlock. He denies himself the constant temptation to check up on him, and instead stays away.
It took another month before Sherlock used his skill in response. “John, are you in love with me?”
“I’m not--” John sighed. He stared down at his hands on his lap to get out, “It’s not that I’m uncomfortable with you being-- I really was telling the truth when I said it’s all fine; boyfriend, girlfriend, I don’t care. I just don’t-- Alex leaves a bad taste in my mouth.”
“The milk!” Sherlock said loudly. John and Lestrade snapped to look at him. He blinked in surprise, as if the deduction took him unawares. “Uh, the milk. The poison is in the milk. Arrest the housekeeper.”
“This doesn’t normally happen to me,” John confessed. He hated to lie, but he couldn’t see another way to help her. “What do you do when you feel depressed?”
Sherlock smiled at his back as John turned to lead him into the bedroom, knowing he’d follow this man anywhere, because no one had ever loved him as he does. And what a strange, wonderful pain to be so loved and accepted. What sweet torture.
“We were just thinking about him riding our cock earlier this week.”
John snapped his fingers in recognition. “Right! You were the physics professor, weren't you?”
The doctor, a short, round black woman that John hadn’t met around the clinic yet, escorted Sherlock back with a firm arm around his bicep.
“Alex is right. I need to be nicer.”
“That’s it, that’s my box of-- hey, where did you find that?”
Sherlock’s eyes hardened. “I really don’t owe him anything.”
“Still coherent? Hmm, I guess I’m not doing a good enough job,” John grinned wolfishly.
The first time John noticed it was at crime scene. Sherlock was bent over a body, folded nearly in half to see the palm of the man’s hand, when he straightened suddenly.
He was starting to feel the effects of not eating around four, after he’d run back and forth along the Thames checking the drying development on his skin samples. He’d been dashing to each one, trying to get precise measurements for the rate at which they cracked in the sun, and after an hour had to lean against the tide wall from dizziness.
“A case, a secretary was transposing numbers and making it appear as though her boss was embezzling.”
He couldn’t make out the words, exactly, but he recognized Sherlock’s voice, and the other with the Scottish twist-- must be that professor.
“Which means he can’t date you.”
“To me?”
“Oh, yeah.”
John knocked him with his shoulder as the commoners and the royal entourage looked on in wonder at his casual treatment of his grace. “That’s John to you. John Watson.”
“He rarely does.”
“Well, hold on--”
John smiled, letting Sherlock tempt him into the shadows between the window panes. “Mm, all the fancy ladies out there are lined up to dance with you, why should I steal one?”
Sherlock glared at him, cheeks rosy. “No.”
“I mean like, that’s cool. You have to acknowledge that’s cool.”
Notably, a woman in Bart’s had told him, “I’m going to kill myself tonight.” She was a nurse, a nice one, who smiled at every patient and scurried around filing reports at top speed.
A moment later, “Wait, this isn’t an experiment, right?”
John smiled at Sherlock’s defense. “Oh I’m sorry. Been going on a few dates with this professor Cameron, then, haven’t you?”
John smiled, blushing despite himself. He saw an opportunity. “Well, I am very flattered but you should know… I consider myself married to my work.”
The night seemed to be a rousing success, John halfway into his third and feeling a bit floaty, when he noticed Sherlock’s face scrunching in discomfort. He leaned forward to talk to him over the pop song blasting out of the jukebox. “Alright, Sherlock?”
When they both looked back at Alex, a second longer than was really appropriate to stare at each other in public, he was wearing a tight smile.
Sherlock blinked.
“Well my calls never get through to you anyway,” Lestrade grumbled back at him.
He started mucking out the stalls as soon as he was down, already so used to the smell that the earthy (read: shitty) scent of the stables did him no harm. He didn’t even hold his breath anymore, as he’d done when he was first sold to the castle by the orphanage. His back hurt from morning to night, cleaning the barn, brushing the horses, reshoeing the horses, feeding and watering the horses, saddling the horses when the members of the family wanted to ride, de-saddling the horses when they were done ten minutes later. Mainly it was the horses that he worked with.
Sherlock stared hard at him, and Lestrade looked down at John in confusion. John could just watch Sherlock’s synapses firing as he tried to connect some deja vu of John putting him in cuffs. John had hoped he’d never remember what he said on the laughing gas, but clearly Sherlock’s mind was trying to connect the dots.
Dean shrugged. "Well, good. Cause I'm really not that interested."
Sherlock sat up, throughly agitated now. “This is my hard drive and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful. Really useful! Ordinary people fill their heads with all sorts of rubbish and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters. Do you see?”
"Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thanks for asking." He snipped as he regathered all the stray papers. "Long enough." He answered before standing and all but throwing the folder into Sherlock's hands. "Why in the bloody hell are you two in here discussing vampires and monsters like they're real?"
Once inside, they both sprinted up the stairs to 221 B, John leading.
Her eyes were wide and they kept darting to the phone on her desk. Greg took a steadying breath and ran a hand through his hair, trying to reign his rage into a deadly calm. "No. She always works on Wednesdays." He countered, his voice rough. The receptionist stared at Greg and slowly shook her head. "She hasn't worked a Wednesday in months, Greg. I'm sorry."
"Yes, Well, this event was inevitable." Mycroft stated as he finished entering the small office and closed the door behind him. He chose to stay standing, rather than take a seat. So, the detective swaggered over to the front of his desk and leaned his weight back onto in, not quite sitting or standing. Ever the flirtatious rebel. Mycroft briefly imagined how Greg might look splayed out on top of that desk. He cleared his throat. Perhaps another time. "I am quite grateful, however, for the way you handled my little brother both at the crime scene and here at the Yard. With a firm yet understanding disposition."
The door to the room opened and Greg rolled in a cart filled with all sorts of menacing looking weapons and tools. The D.I. glared at the vampire, taking in it’s greasy appearance, skinny frame, and dread locked hair. “You sure you’re going to be able to extract any information from this one, Mycroft? He looks like the nest’s lackey, at best.”
“Your father is the reason you’re here?” Mycroft inferred, twirling the hammer.
“You know what?” Sam spat. “Pull the fucking trigger.”
“Aliens? You can’t be serious.” Dean added. “They’re not real! The only time we even encountered a story of E.T., it was just Gabriel playing tricks.”
"Dean. You're going to stab one of us with that blade." Cas chided. "Besides, that was forged in Heaven, not hell."
The angel sighed.
"Oh good. You're home." Sherlock greeted as soon as John came through the door.
“Well?” John asked in return, straightening up in the seat. “You know, pink lady, pink case, pink phone, there was a lot of pink.” He elaborated, thoughtfully rubbing his chin.
The hunter rolled his eyes. "Right. And why would an 'angel' rescue me from hell?" He bit out.
"Speaking of." Dean interjected, bring his hand up and back down in a sort of patting manner on Cas' shoulder. "I found some old weaponry that I want you to check out. See if it's what we need for the heroes spell."
"No." Was the simple reply. "And now, the entire nest has been alerted. They've scattered into the wind, I'm afraid."
Sherlock’s head rolled back in pleasure and he moaned John's name.
“You really intend on closing the doors of hell?”
A smile pulled at Dean's lips as he watched Cas observe the scene in front of them.
“Heroes from the past.” Cas practically whispered. “What did he say about them?”
"Oh, Gregory." Holmes despaired. Greg's eyes shot up to hold his gaze at the sound of his name on Mycroft's lips. "My brother has a brilliant mind, as you've witnessed, but unfortunately he does not handle 'feelings' or 'emotions' very well. I'm sure you'll come to learn this."
“Pull the fucking trigger.” Sam punctuated each word as he shakily stood. “You cowardly piece of shit.” He added, striding forward in a threatening manner.
“Heard the local…
“That makes two of us.” Cas assured. “I…I still have very little grasp on human social norms and all the details that accompany your rituals. Perhaps, we should stray from them, anyway. Our situation is extremely atypical. An angel engaged in a romantic relationship with a human is practically unheard of and is in fact frowned upon by heaven.”
“You know, I don’t normally get a strip tease from the hunters that have
The hunter locked his eyes on Cas'. "Then why are you here?" What other reason was there?
"Oh. Oh!" Sherlock responded.
useful in the archives." Sam commented, sitting more upright in his chair and preparing to give Dean more of his attention.
**************************************************
“Well good, cause where we’re heading doesn’t sound like a picnic.”
“Okay…thanks? I guess.” The hunter remarked and then he was out the door.
“Cure a demon?” He pondered out loud. “Okay, knowing the fact that I don’t actually know what that means, if we do this, you get better, right?” He asked Sam. “And then you stop tryna cough up a lung and bumping into furniture?”
Mycroft smiled lightly and dipped his head to try to hide his amusement. "Yes. I'm afraid that you've only just begun to uncover the eccentric nature of all that encompasses my little brother."
"I need you to go along with everything I say tonight." Sherlock instructed as he buttoned his wrist cuffs.
**********************************************
“Sherlock?” John called. The doctor and the detective inspector both come to a halt in the living room. Sherlock was sitting in his armchair, Mycroft in John’s.
Dean noted the huge, what was that? A spear? In Cas' hand. It had a gold tip but the handle looked to be made out of carved wood.
“Uh…” Dean thought hard for a moment. “He said that closing the gates of hell was a choice. That we should think about the cost before doing it. Not that that made any sense. I mean, why wouldn’t we lock the door on those sons of bitches now that we know how?”
Though he had befriended and moved in with Sherlock within record time, John was sure he would be unraveling the mystery that was Sherlock Holmes for the rest of his life. And he certainly hoped that would be the case. Sherlock was as intriguing and brilliant as he was irritating and emotionally inept. John marveled at the contrast.
“Oh, just do it.” Sherlock yelled back.
“Don’t be a dick to your brother, Sherlock.” Greg grumbled.
Despite himself, Mycroft returned the chuckle. "I really do need to have this discussion with you."
****************************
The distraction made it easy to press through the crowd, and because the fight was escalating, more security guards rushed over to help.
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Cas?”
Dean helped Cas get into the bunker and down the stairs.
Sirens sounded in the distance. Flashing lights were the last thing Sherlock was aware of.
**************************
The soldier abandoned the kettle on the stove and strode over to the kitchen door frame to glare at the taller man taking up the couch.
very attractive, but I was…I was only wondering if I could crash at your place tonight? M’not sure I’m ready to face Sherlock again just yet.”
And how much of it has been at the hands of your kind?” Sam shouted.
Dean quickly shot up out of his chair and held a hand up to Sam’s chest. “Woah.” He cautioned.
John and Sherlock. Greg is a good friend. Mycroft can be dick sometimes. Sorry it's been so long.
“Look, why don’t we call it a night and pick this back up in the morning? I’’m exhausted.” Sam said.
"You're asking me to be Sherlock's handler, aren't you?"
Gerard, knowing that the life would leave Sherlock's eyes soon, turned his head to look down. And in doing so, the grip on his pistol loosened.
Upon hearing his name and title the other man's body relaxed ever so slightly. "I'm sure you're aware that I do, in fact, possess a mobile phone." Greg snarked.
"That's probably for the best." Sherlock chuckled.
"It was my mistake." Castiel admitted. "Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them." He explained. "I was wrong."
"Yes." Was the simple reply.
One late night at the office, after a long day of endless paperwork, Greg's infamous bad luck hit again. He shuffled through the next stack of papers and cursed under his breath. "Ah, Fuck."
"And if he doesn't?"
The rest of the trip was spent in contemplative silence.
Dean followed. “Hey, how’d you get passed Crowley’s warding measures?”
A horrible panic and rage coursed through John. He couldn't do anything, not yet.
Dean stood slowly from where he was crouched down. "Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing." His voice was bitter and he was agitated. Angry that this, thing, took him for a fool.
John pursed his lips in thought for a moment, before standing and promptly heading to grab his coat.
“Out. I need some air.” John responded angrily before bounding down the stairs.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Alright Cas, fine. I get the point. But we either need to find a weapon or have one made."
city though, Dean. Any idea how your going to find the needle in the haystack?" Sam closed the notebook and looked over at his brother with a quizzical expression.
Finally, the last button was relieved of it's duty and John parted the fabric, revealing the supple and pale skin underneath.
"And what 'visage' are you in now, huh? What, holy tax accountant?" Dean snarked.
”You knew what this was from the start, Gregory." The politician accused, his cold demeanor now settling in. "Don’t get agitated with me because I haven’t been swooned by your charms like you may have hoped. While I admit that I've enjoyed our time together, I am unable to become emotionally involved." He took another, more generous sip of his liquor. "That would be a risk of national security. My work is of the utmost importance, and therefore, will always come first before anything, or anyone, else.”
He shrugged to himself. "Sherlock needs a firm hand and he needs to understand that his actions have consequences. But, he's also brilliant and I'd prefer not to charge him for his offenses today. Don't want him to be deemed unfit to work along side my police force."
Dean looked to Sam in confusion before rushing over to help Cas to his feet. The angel could barely stand upright.
The angel looked up at Dean. There were bruises on his face and blood was soaked through the clothes on his midsection. “A little help here.” He gritted out.
A cabbie dropped Greg off at Sherlock's apartment building. He walked inside and up three flights of stairs to the door that read 307. He prepared to knock, but he caught two voices from behind the wooden barrier. Sherlock and Mycroft.
Mycroft tried not to smirk, though he was amused at the sarcasm. "I prefer to meet with persons-of-interest face to face." He explained.
John reluctantly grabbed the head again, opening it’s mouth and checking the teeth. “What am I supposed to be seeing here, Sherlock?” He asked.
“Invade. Invade the United Kingdom.”
Sherlock halted in front of the other man. "Yes, well, even at my worst I am still worth a thousand times more than your most competent officers at their best." Sherlock retorted with sincere arrogance.
Dean settled a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Good.” The hunter declared, patting the spot amicably, though a bit awkwardly.
Greg looked deeply into Mycroft's eyes for some time, searching for something. Seemingly having found what he was looking for, he nodded. "Yeah. Alright."
"Agreed." Came the happy reply.
“Oooh. Scary.” The creature quipped sarcastically with a roll of his eyes.
**************************
“Uh, I mean, yeah, we do. But not until you’re healed up. Cas, you’re not flying off anywhere right now. Not in your condition.”
My schedule has become very chaotic for me, so I anticipate posting chapters bi-weekly from here on.
Hmm. Interesting. Not that Mycroft couldn't just force his way, but he would much prefer not to. Besides, he only needed to invoke more favorable words of reason in order for Gregory to agree to his ways. "I would have to ask that you reconsider. For Queen and Country, and for the sake of the world itself."
By the time a bouncer arrived, Sherlock was very pleased with himself for causing such a perfect scene and distraction.
This starts in the middle of the brothers conversation with Metatron when they first found him.
"Oh, hey." Sam muttered, still very much distracted by his work.
“You already knew that. Didn’t you?” The creature sobbed.
“What about you, Sasquatch?” Dean asked his brother.
The words came across his lips before his brain had fully processed the question. It was an automatic answer because it was the truth.
Looks were exchanged around the room.
**********************
John made quick work of his henchmen in quite a display of power. Normally, he wouldn't have gotten away free from knocking out a group of guys in a club, but that was taken care of by the fact that the security guards were distracted.
"Not in my experience." The phrase was hard, but the tone was softer. It caused the angel to recede.
*****************************************
“A spell.” Sam echoed. “How complicated is it?”
“Cas.” Dean tried again, but he couldn’t seem to say anything more. Fortunately, there was enough emotion behind the way he said the name, that Cas seemed to understand the gist of what he was trying to convey. A smirk lifted at the corner of the angel’s mouth. “Dean.” He replied, and the hunter chuckled before returning the smile.
“But we’re heading somewhere.” The Winchester in the passenger seat asserted.
“Oh, great! You utter bastard!” Dean shouted at the stacks of books piled in the room. But moments later Metatron returned with a crumpled young boy in his arms.
"Right. Shall we go, then?" John asked as he stood from his chair to grab his coat.
“Are you barking mad?” John yelled at him.
"You're not planning on dancing tonight, are you?" John laughed.
“It’s your choice. I mean, that’s what this has all been about. The choices your kind make.” Metatron explained. He grabbed a legal pad and pen from the kitchen counter and began to scribble something down as he spoke. “But you’re gonna have to weigh that choice. Ask yourself, what is it going to take to do this? And what will the world be like after it’s done?”
“Kevin?” Dean recognized.
to gain knowledge from me.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock was stunned for a good few moments before he reacted and kissed John back.
************************
Dean ventured into the war room, where Sam was nose deep into research. He cleared his throat noisily to catch his brother's attention.
Mycroft utilized a few seconds to internalize Greg's words. "I suppose you are correct, for the most part. However, Sherlock is a bit of a special case. And, again, his messes usually end up disrupting my most exceedingly crucial work. Not to mention, as with all addicts, he needs a bit more support to ensure that he's taking proper care of himself."
It took several more hours for Sherlock to regain consciousness.
"No. Your normal attire will suffice."
“Good. Good. Oh God.” Greg practically giggled, wiping away a tear of laughter. “Shall we get a cab, then?”
“Oh Hell! What does that matter?!?” Sherlock argued. “So the Earth goes round the sun. If we went ‘round the moon, or ‘round and ‘round the garden like a teddy bear’, it wouldn’t make any difference! All that matters to me is the work. Without that my brain rots.” Sherlock violently tousled his dark curls, then abruptly stopped and glared at John. “Why don’t you put that in your blog? Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world.” With that Sherlock threw the magazine back onto the coffee table, and then flipped onto his side to lie down facing the couch cushions like a sulking child.
"You don't have to use my full title, it's a bit of mouthful, yeah? Greg is fine. Also, I didn't catch your name."
“Metatron. You found Metatron? I was under the impression that he died a long time ago.” Cas informed.
“No.”
Sherlock found himself rubbing circles into the soldiers hipbones as they continued snogging. The action was drawing some amazing sounds from his partner. Which were then quickly filed away in the detective's mind palace, inside a new compartment in the ever growing space dedicated to John Watson; Soldier, Doctor, Friend, Blogger, and now, Lover.
“I have a hard time getting away sometimes, with such a consistently massive workload. Seems like people are always killing each other and want me to work myself to death too.” Greg huffed but then his face lit up in a smile at the other man. “Speaking of people killing each other, how are you and Sherlock getting on?”
Dean swallowed thickly. He was completely out of his comfort zone and he didn't know what to do next. It was an unusual predicament for him.
"Oh...kay. Moving on from that can of worms. Now we have the weapon forged in hell." Dean gestured to the spear. "So next up is the dragon skull. Which is apparently in London." He pretended to tip his nonexistent hat. "You know, England."
He was alone in the war room, leaned back in a chair with his feet up on the table and a beer in his hand, when the bunker door creaked open and Cas walked in. "There he is!" Dean announced, placing his feet back to the floor and smiling at his angel as he descended the staircase. "And with weapon in tow."
“Dean? Dean!” Sam hollered a minute later from the sitting room.
"You really think you're being serious? Are you high right now?" Greg quipped in return.
"Any particular occasion?" He asked while on his way to the kitchen.
Sherlock released the tension in the make shift tourniquet around his arm, the chemical compound now mingling with the red blood cells in his veins. A sigh of relief escaped him and he slumped against the dingy wall of the slum house he was in. Sherlock closed his eyes and began assessing the changes in his body as the cocaine solution took hold. Increased heart rate, an added alertness to his mind, and yet a pleasant buzz from dopamines flooding his brain.
The man in question sent a few guys from his group after them, and then he made his way to escape into a back alleyway.
sitting on one of the shelves!”
“Fine.” The politician spat in reply.
"DON"T. WANT. TO. KNOW!" Sam bellowed, throwing the papers in his hands at his brother to get him to shut the hell up. They flew around in a flurry of white, none of them hitting their target.
Mycroft, also down to his shirt sleeves, mirrored Lestrade by placing his glass down on the desk. He navigated over to the other man and stood directly behind him, chest to back. He pressed into him and gripped the edge of the desk with both hands, trapping Gregory between the inanimate object and himself. "I disagree." He whispered, his hot breath caressing the shell of Gregory's ear before he kissed the sensitive skin just below.
"There are other options besides shooting up, Sherlock!"
After a few moments of followed silence both of them burst out laughing at their mutual awkwardness.
"Oh, Sherlock. I want to make you feel so good." John panted into the other man's ear as he rocked his hips forward to emphasize his point.
“Arrangement.” Greg repeated in disbelief. He bent over quickly to snatch his shirt off of the hardwood floor. “Huh. Guess I was wrong about her, and about you.” He snapped.
“But, are you in?” Dean inquired. “With us, I mean.”
"Bitch."
“Because you’re an idiot.” John sighed fondly. “Okay, just remember the plan. Inject them with dead mans blood, then tie them up and leave them until we come back around to collect them all.”
He nodded solemnly at the receptionist who gave him a pitying look in return. Greg didn't like it, but he supposed he'd have to get used to seeing it on everyone's faces soon enough.
“I think it’s time then, that you learned what is really going on in the world.”
“You only kiss me when one of us is in pain.” Cas stated with certainty.
“You say that like you’re surprised. I was in the army, Sherlock. Remember?”
“You will not be granted the mercy of a quick death until you give me the information I require.” The politician stated with cold certainty. He reached up to the knot of his blood red tie and pulled it side to side, loosening it, undoing it, and then tugging it forcefully off his neck and slamming it down on the table.
He doesn't get to finish the inquiry, because Sherlock's lips have silenced John's.
Meanwhile, Sherlock had ran after the killer.
“You’re saying Sam would die?” Dean fumed.
Mycroft's face fell and he backed up a few steps. Once removed from him, Gregory's hands settled backwards to grip onto the edge of the desk as if to steady himself.
Depends if you’re buying. GL
In an instant, the old metal shingles on the roof of the barn started clanging and knocking heavily.
something useful in this bunker! I knew it!" Dean lifted up the file he'd been reading and pointed at it. "It's an enchanted object that indicates when supernatural artifacts are nearby."
“Nothing ever happens to me.” That is what John had told his therapist so recently. Now here he was, swept up in a whirlwind named Sherlock Holmes. Every day after they met proved more interesting than the last.
John sighed. He didn’t like the way Mycroft said that, and he can only be leading up to something dramatic. He tipped his head and raised a brow for the other man to continue with his theatrics.
The older man continued grinding down against his partner and his hands quickly fumbled to unbutton the detective's shirt. This simple action, however, proved much more difficult than usual while riding these profound waves of pleasure.
Cas let him. The angel's heart broke as he listened to the quiet sobs and felt the tears seep through his coat. He was the cause of this pain. Why did it feel like he was always a source of pain for Dean, when all he wanted was to bring him peace and comfort?
“Or if the Earth goes around the sun.” John cut in.
"Hello Dean." He greeted the eldest Winchester when he arrived at the bottom of the stairs.
"Of course." Was the immediate answer. "Though, it's highly unlikely that the Men of Letters would possess such an weapon. Even with their knack for procuring rare supernatural items."
John raised an eyebrow at his friend.
The mysterious man swayed with the force of the blow. Then he grabbed the handle, pulled it back out, and dropped it to the floor, completely unaffected.
Dean let out the breath he didn't know he was holding and sat back into the bench. A whoosh signaled Castiel's departure.
“Ugh. Well, it’s not all bad. I’m certainly never bored.” John sighed before downing the last of his beer.
Sherlock locked eyes with a man dressed in all black at the corner of the club. John knew instantly that this was the guy they were after.
"Yep." John confirmed his cooperation.
"We need to talk Dean." The creature announced. "Alone." He added, while looking curiously down at the collapsed hunter.
"You miss understand me, Dean." Cas objected. "I am not like you think. I...I was praying that you would choose to save the town."
A week after the incident, Lestrade came over to get the full story and finish the report.
Ah! Yes, that was the reason Sherlock kissed John in the first place.
"You mean the gas station and the motel. That was you talking?" The angel nodded. "Buddy, next time, lower the volume."
Cas leaned into the table and glared at his boyfriend. "Oh yeah. I'll just pop on down to hell and do some blacksmithing. Any other requests? Should I extract the iron for it from the blood of your enemies as well?"
“Did Metatron tell you how you’re supposed to ‘cure a demon’? I didn’t realize that was even possible.”
“How’s the diet?” Sherlock retorted.
"I'm the only smart person you know. Well, that is unless you count my brother, but I..."
"Dr. Coleman," The eldest Holmes brother greeted with a false tone of light cheer. "I do hope that things are being handled rather discreetly regarding this infestation."
Sam held up a hand at Dean. "Dude. I don't want to know any details about your boyfriend's ass."
“Wow. Cool!” He heard Kevin exclaim when he entered with Sam behind them.
"This is, however, one of his creations. Made eons ago for a...
"What kind of things?"
"We are. But we may as well settle in a bit. Wouldn't want to draw too much attention to ourselves, and besides it may be a while before our guy shows his face." Sherlock explained over the loud music.
Dean's eyes went wide and his mouth went slack. What the fuck was he supposed to do now?
have some freckles..."
"Because they are." Sherlock deadpanned. Mycroft shot him a murderous glare. His little brother just shrugged. "He was bound to find out eventually."
He flagged the bartender down and ordered two more.
Care to join me for a pint? JW
They stalked through the corridor of the condemned house, stopping at the entryway to the next room. John peered inside to scope out the number of vamps inside. He held up four fingers to Sherlock. Two each. He didn’t like those numbers. Not when they weren’t supposed to resolve to killing them.
“Nah. I got it. Thanks though.”
The next morning John awoke with a pain in his shoulder. He abruptly came back to reality when he realized that he wasn’t alone on Greg's sofa. They had both fallen asleep there while watching the telly last night.
John relaxed into the couch, his shoulder still throbbing dully. The news station was doing a story about some long lost painting that had been recently found. The next story, however, made John bolt upright.
John's head was swimming with what had just transpired.
“You know what he was talking about?” Sam turned to ask.
"So." Dean clapped his hands and rubbed them together. "How soon will you be up to traveling again?"
“Cas, I…” Dean began, but his argument died in his throat when he realized the angel was right. So the hunter switched tactics and decided to be honest with him. He leaned his backside against the table and sighed. “I’m sorry, Cas. I’m shit at this. Always have been. I don’t know how to do long term relationships.”
The television set was still on, News now, and the D.I. was still asleep. He must have shifted closer in the night, because now he was leaned into John’s side. No wonder John didn’t have any nightmares last night.
. You are an abomination.” Greg sneered. “Mycroft?”
On the ride back to the bunker the brothers caught Kevin and Cas up to speed on everything.
As he leaned back he made sure to tell Cas, "You better come back in one piece or I'll kick your ass." Dean meant to sound serious, but he ended up just sounding worried instead.
Sherlock was a thorn in Greg's side for the entire ride back to the Scotland Yard. He spent the time berating and belittling everyone that had been at the crime scene today. By name. And in great detail. "Shut up, Sherlock." The D.I. groaned when he finally pulled into a parking space. "Jesus, you're insufferable."
Sorry this one took so long to write. Such is life. Enjoy!
"Right?!?" Dean asked, gripping the edge of the table and dipping his head forward to emphasize. "Anyways, Cas went off to go search for a god named He...fest-ti-uhs?" He grabbed a stray paper off of the table to scan, and Sam snatched it back.
Sherlock’s head popped up at the noise. “Where are you going?” He inquired.
Castiel furrowed his brows slightly, and tilted his head to the side. "I told you." He declared firmly.
That pub near the yard you were telling me about. I’m on my way now from Baker Street, by foot. JW
***************************************
Dean attempted a false smile and then readjusted his focus to the road, only to see something laying in the middle of it. He stomped on the brakes, bringing Baby to a skidding halt.
He felt Dean's eyes follow the movement, so he glanced up to find the hunter now fixated on his mouth. The angel swallowed roughly. "Dean-" The name came out breathy and low. It wasn't even all the way across his lips before the hunter stole it from him, pressing their mouths together.
"You're making a mistake." Sherlock shouted. "You NEED me!"
"You sure you did the ritual right?" He whined at Bobby. The older man glared daggers at him, and Dean immediately apologized. He knew it wasn't Bobby's fault. He was just tired of waiting. "Touchy, touchy, huh?" He added sarcastically, because that's his default position.
It intrigued Dean, so he shrugged slightly and tried to keep the inflection out of his voice when he replied,  "Okay."
Sherlock fell into John, who caught him and uprighted him.
John was halfway through the entertainment pages when Sherlock emerged from his room, looking very well put together, as always.
Sherlock pushed his sleeves up to his elbows, smirked at John, and then went straight in towards the pack. “Sherlock!” John shouted, alarmed by the recklessness. The detective got a needle into the first vamps arm and she dropped. But then the other two monsters attacked. They quickly rid the detective of his toxic syringes.
John huffed and rolled his eyes. Typical Sherlock.
This chapter has been updated. It will no longer be a two part, instead I'm adding more to the end.
"How long have you been standing there?" Mycroft demanded.
"Who are you?" Dean demanded again.
" The shorter brother rounded the table and pulled out a chair. "See, the Men of Letters kept files on every demonic possession for the last 55 years."
Greg's heart sank. They were arguing about something. They were always arguing, those two. Greg pushed his ear lightly to the door to hear better. Sherlock was loud, as per usual, but he only caught parts and pieces of Mycroft's sentences.
Clare nodded. “You are; however if we have to stand and fight a pack of Yoma, we are going to need all the warriors we can. You are a slow traveler, due to the fact that you have to eat and sleep; however I have seen you train and you are very fast for a human.”
I sigh. “I’m fine.”
Sherlock slipped off his shirt and stood before John. John didn’t back up as Sherlock stepped into his personal space.
“So, do we need to send a home care nurse round to look after him?” the doctor’s voice intones.
Clare stopped short of going in the living room when she heard the unmistakable sounds of Sherlock and John’s love making. A tear slid down her cheek, as she contemplated the evil that would consume John. John’s destruction would be Sherlock’s destruction and the world would be a darker place without them.
“Who’s this?” John asked, when Molly brought the child forward.
Sherlock felt as if he’d been slapped, as all the anger drained out of him and was replaced by hurt.
I take her hand and bring it to my lips.
Sherlock’s eyes grew wide and he collapsed against his chair with a thud.
I frown as I prowl the perimeter of the room. “How do you know that they didn’t just run off?”
Sherlock nodded bravely, handed John a towel to throw on his lap for privacy and then at John’s signal he slipped John’s pants down.  When Sherlock’s hands reached his upper thigh, John jumped as Sherlock apologized, “I’m sorry my hands are cold.”
Sherlock set a beaker on a near-by table, then glared at him. “Because that’s what you are—the lackey, or would you rather be called the minion?”
The Shaman’s blue eyes glittered as he met John’s gaze, “John, look again and this time use your powers of observation.”
We decide to stay on in Prague for the holidays and for the first time in my life I am happy. The love of you, dearest John and Mary keeps me safe, makes me whole. A fear, a premonition claws at my sub-conscious like an evil bird of prey. I ignore it. When I shiver you hold me tighter.
Yellow
Without a word Sherlock sat down heavily in the chair nearest him, as Mycroft came and stood near him. “Sherlock, a third of the city has already died. London is now a closed city and under martial law, the city has run out of places to bury the corpses and have they begun to burn them just outside the city.”
“Good Morning, Sherlock, have I told you how much I love you?” John asked softly as he rubbed the back of Sherlock’s neck until the hairs on his arm stood on end.
“Yeah, I know you’re always sorry after. I’ll be in the next room if you need me.”
“She…she made me kill my best friend, Victor.”
I feel my control slipping away, so I become indignant. “I’m sure I did no such thing.”
“Mrs. Hudson, promise me you’ll keep them safe. Promise me.”
You pound your fist on the wooden floors, causing the solar system mobile above Alice’s bed to shake. “Why do you always have to be so difficult?”
Sherlock stirred and winced at the shooting pain that encompassed his entire skull. Regardless of how much it would hurt Sherlock sat up and looked around him. Where were John and Clare? Sherlock felt gentle cool hands supporting his neck. Even before he spoke Sherlock knew it was John’s touch that supported him.
Sherlock felt as if someone had jerked the rug out from underneath him, “What letter? I want to see it now.”
I smile and say, “A puzzle.”
“Sherlock?”
“Sherlock?” A voice called from behind him. Sherlock knew without looking it was John Watson.
You reach up and touch my forehead. “You feel like you’ve got a fever. No doubt you’ve been working yourself up about all this. Let’s get you to bed and we’ll talk about this in the morning.”
Sherlock was glad to back in London, far away from everything that reminded him of John for even though he and Sherlock were going to go back to London after Sherlock’s case was over, Sherlock didn’t know John’s London address and John didn’t know his, so it was as if the cruise had never taken place. Sherlock paused outside the gallery where his paintings were displayed and then sighed and went in.
The scout’s eyes were large and round, “He went back through the tunnel. He went home to London.”
Mycroft watched his little brother go from a furious state to a fixated one in the space of a few seconds. John. He wanted him, craved him, loved him. He turned away, hoping that John’s love could protect his beloved younger sibling. “Fine, just be ready to leave bright and early tomorrow.” He waited for a retort. When none came he turned around to see Sherlock taking John’s hands in his own. He was down on his knees speaking in low tones, his fingers rubbing John’s arms, while his head bowed in grief. Mycroft swallowed, sad that John was learning the truth about Sherlock and sad for himself that he would never have the privilege of someone to weep over him.
An nodded. “The portal must be closed through a great act of sacrifice.”
Sherlock smiled smugly and replied. “I can look at any person and tell their ring size, their shoe size, their shirt size….etc,”  Sherlock’s voice trailed off as his face colored.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he said, “What do you mean, car accidents?”
As if sensing John’s presence Sherlock sat up in bed and sleepily held out his arms towards John.
I yawn. “Yes, if one likes cheap theatrics.”
John laughed as Sherlock took his hand and kissed it. Though Sherlock had meant to let go of John’s hand after the brief kiss he clung as tightly to it as he did the vision of John leaning back in the recliner and for a moment it seemed as if John had not been injured. He was just a man holding his husband’s hand on a pleasure cruise. John felt relaxed, relatively free of pain and as the sun shone on his face he closed his eyes. The last thing John heard before he fell asleep was the chattering of happy passengers and the sound of the ocean as it swirled around the ship’s hull.
“No of course not,” John and Sherlock echoed back.
“Oh really?” John said as he reached back and grabbed Sherlock’s belt.
Molly looked back at her. “Yes, very.”
Sherlock as usual was right for he only lasted about .58 seconds, but John didn’t care for he loved the smell of Sherlock’s manly fluid on his hands. John gave Sherlock a chance to get himself under control and then they wheeled out into the open like nothing had happened. Sherlock calm and looking bored wheeled John out into the open. John sat in his chair with a dopey smile on his lips as he smelled his hands.
“Sherlock, be careful.” John called out wheeling his chair back and forth.
Mycroft laughs. “For someone who is so intelligent, you can be incredibly stupid. Sherlock, when you died in John’s arms I have never seen such devastation in an individual’s face. It would break my heart if something were to befall you, brother dear. John, on the other hand would die slowly inside. Take care dear brother; his heart is in your hands.”
Sharon studied John’s face on the cab ride home, “John, I thought that the cruise would be good for you, but you look pale and tired. Is everything okay?”
“He must have known about her before he went around the bend, then.”
When I speak my voice sounds like a child. “No, it’s just that I feel…tight…like I’m going to explode.”
“Yes.”
John grabbed his arms so tightly that Sherlock yelped. “Sherlock, I would die for you a million times over. I would disembowel myself with my sword, I would poke my eye out, I would …” John’s voice trailed off as he tickled Sherlock. “Come on world’s greatest detective, stop the dramatics.”
“God above, Sherlock, we have responsibilities. We have a baby and Anderson to look after. Your last blood panel revealed that your kidneys and liver are under a great deal of strain from your past abuses. I can’t lose you again. Why do you feel the desire to hurt yourself? You need therapy.”
John almost seemed to get a perverse delight as he tightened his hands around Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock turned his head to the side in an effort to get air. “John, please come back. I love you,” Sherlock coughed.
Anderson groans and pushes against me. “I hacked into dispatch and arrived there first, then I cut their toes off.”
When my eyes open you are curled up at my back in the fetal position. You used to sleep with one leg draped around mine, your head on my shoulder, with your hands wrapped around my torso, your fingers resting on the trail of hair underneath my navel. I used to complain of the closeness, now I miss it. I miss you.
By this time tears were pouring down Sherlock’s cheeks. “John, it doesn’t matter now. What’s done is done.”
Sherlock walked forward and said just out of earshot of the security officer said, “What a colossal moron. He makes Anderson look like an Einstein. I’m surprised he didn’t tell you to not leave town.”
Sherlock placed a kiss on John’s head and Mycroft marveled at his brother’s ability to show public affection, something he would have never thought possible. He then turned to face them. “I’ve saved the man I love, that’s what I’ve done.”
“Yes, I follow you anywhere. I will fix this. I will fix everything.”
I nod. “Take off the bandage around your ribs.”
Jake stopped to thank her for the compliment and then decided to remain silent, due to the fact that he wasn’t sure whether he had been complimented or not. Pretty soon he felt his eyes grow heavy as his head drooped against his chest. The last thing Jake remembered was Clare’s glowing eyes fixated on him.
Sherlock stiffened. “John, please promise you will never do something that foolish again. Clare, is not what she seems, however, I don’t think she means us any harm. Just the same John, please don’t follow her again.”
The nurse nodded sadly for they both knew he was lying, as John smiled in assurance at her the nurse wavered for a moment or two and then with a gentle nod from John she bolted away from him, lest she become too immersed in his world of sadness, for no one wants to be reminded that his or her life could become tragically altered in a second. John watched her scurry past the window, through the falling snow, her figure briefly illuminate by the red tail lights of the medical transport van. A young man bounded in through the front doors, looked around for a few moments and then as soon as he spotted John he came trotting over.
Sherlock awkwardly backed out of the main room went into the kitchen and when he opened the small refrigerator he gasped for there was nothing in it. “John, your ice box is empty.”
Anderson gives me a sly look under hooded lids. “Of course I’m coming-again.”
Sherlock nodded, “That will be like heaven…I mean that sounds sort of corny doesn’t it?”
The Shaman and John left, leaving Sherlock to contemplate the situation on his own. After a few musings, Sherlock became bored with battle plans and fell asleep. When he awoke someone must have carried him to bed for it was dark and Sherlock was tucked in tightly. He smiled when he felt John’s kiss on his cheek, “Goodnight, Sherlock,” John said as he jabbed a needle into Sherlock’s neck.
As they trudged upstairs, Clare looked back at John and Sherlock. “You two must have a lot to discuss. We will reconvene tomorrow, goodnight.” Clare locked eyes with Sherlock and then looked away as she made her way to John’s room. John and Sherlock didn’t speak until they were situated in Sherlock’s bedroom.
John looked up at Sherlock to see if he were joking. He wasn’t. John smiled as the sun beat down upon them. He then leaned back, resting his head on Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock hesitated and then stroked John’s hair. John shivered from the touch and from the lengthening cool shadows that were starting to advance on the sun’s rays.
John shook his head in frustration, at not being able to obtain the information Sherlock wanted as well as the closeness of his proximity for he could feel Sherlock’s body heat and John became so overwhelmed by the stimulus that the hair on the back of his neck stood on end, as he self-consciously rubbed the base of his skull.
Sherlock swallowed as he forced himself to drag his gaze away from John’s wriggling bare toes. He then looked over at Lestrade and said in a bored monotone voice; only John heard the slight tremor that made his normally dulcet tone slightly off key, “Murders aboard the cruise line that I met John on? Sounds boring, but I guess it would be a chance to go away.”
This thought squelched any hesitation. His need for a fix was now justified. He looked down at John while he slept. Beautiful.
Sherlock detested when individuals that had been knocked out sat up and invariably asked in a sing song voice,” What happened?” Despite it being a pet peeve that is exactly what Sherlock did as he sat up with John supporting him, “What happened?”
Wiggins looked at him, then folded his arms across his chest. “Fine, what did you find?”
Anderson takes off all of his clothes except his pants and then slips in beside me. Like two orphans lost in a winter storm, we cling to each other and shiver in each other’s arms.
“Never mind him, he’s clueing for fucks, the little tramp.”
Sherlock smiled jauntily and said, “I’ve been on a suicide mission before, besides what does it matter as long as John is by my side?”
Then as if reading his mind, John pummeled his target again and again until they both moaning, Sherlock’s extensive vocabulary silenced, replaced with guttural grunts and whimpers.
You bounce the mattress with your fists again. “What the fuck are you talking about? Are you high?”
“Mycroft, are you there?” I call out to the empty room.
John patted her shoulder. “Take care of them the best way we know how.”
John bit back his report as Mrs. Hudson ushered an Asian man into the kitchen. “He says he was expected. Next time you need to answer the door yourself. I’m not your housekeeper or your butler.” Mrs. Hudson chided cheerfully as he cleared away the small biscuit plates. She then turned toward their guest. “Would you like some tea and biscuits, dear?” She asked warmly.
Anderson doesn’t answer when my fingers resume their crawling. His head falls back against the piano. I am getting off just watching him. “I’m going to jerk you off quick.” I say.
“Good, for I have something new I want to try,” John said as he jumped out of bed.  A few moments later he came back with a blind fold, hand cuffs and some sort of long, pointy things.
After a brief shower back at the flat, I shoot up and collapse into the warm sheets of my bed. Anderson then takes his shower. The smell of cocaine wafts through the air as he stares down at me. I roll over in the sheets like a caterpillar spinning in its cocoon.
“It’s time for you to take another pain pill. You want me to get some biscuits to swallow it down with?” you ask.
Mrs. Hudson raised an eyebrow. “I did have ear phones on.”
Sherlock handed it back to him. “Well, it’s unacceptable, get me another.”
Mycroft smiled at Sherlock as if he were a child. “Oh, Sherlock you are so naïve.”
“He disgusts me, right now,” Sherlock thought and looked away. Suddenly, John sat up and exclaimed, “What the hell?”
By the time, we arrive at Baker Street, I am in a foul mood, knowing that a cloud of darkness is coming, I burst forth from the cab, rush past Mrs. Hudson and make my way towards my violin.
Sherlock and John both leaned back enjoying the warmth of each other’s company and the water. Finally, John slithered closer and kissed Sherlock on the mouth. It was just meant as a kiss, but Sherlock felt like he was on fire as he kissed John back.  As John’s tongue made its way into his mouth, Sherlock marveled at how John could make a kiss seem like sex itself. As John tentatively explored the inside of his mouth Sherlock responded first slowly with wonder, and then hard and passionate. Sherlock leaned his head back against the side of the wooden tub as John moved his mouth over Sherlock’s neck. The stars were so bright in this world Sherlock thought as he tried to control his emotions. John had wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s waist and as always Sherlock had to fight the urge to cry as John’s hands rubbed his stomach. Sherlock gasped for air as he waited for John’s hands to reach their next destination.
“Rotary?” I ask.
I stroke the side of his face. “One case that stands out in my mind is the case of the dismembered barrister.”
“Clare, what do you want?” John whispered.
Sherlock sighed impatiently,”John, I know what a proximal phalanx is, go on.”
John shook his head, “No, not at all I think we just need some fresh air that’s all.”
“You know the cryptic ‘at least not yet.’”
Laura clapped her hands together, which made John’s body twitch as he sat up. “What’s happening?” He asked in a sleepy voice.
“ENOUGH, Get out, I’m not taking your case…we’re not taking your case.” Sherlock shouted as he pointed to the exit.
Sherlock watched John watching him and became lost in the blue eyes of his doctor.
You place your forehead against mine. “Sherlock, Sherlock, yes I’m dehydrated. Now what’s this about Beethoven?”
A knock at the door interrupted anything that Sherlock was going to say and after eyeing John’s disapproving gaze, he hastily grabbed a robe and opened the door.
I look straight ahead; my eyes fixate on the drug addict next to us. Our eyes meet in understanding. I take a deep breath. “Come on John, back to Baker Street.”
He was about to string up another arrow when a deafening sound filled the air as a bubble formed around one of the horsemen, it grew larger and larger and then exploded into a mass of misshapen horrific creatures that crawled up the mountain towards them in scuttling, crab-like movements.
Sherlock made a point of inhaling, then exhaling in an exaggerated manner, then he spoke in clipped tones, accentuating each word. “Oh, for god’s sake, you can cook up a batch of meth in no time, now figure it out. The kitchen’s that way.” He then pointed in a vague gesture towards a hallway to their left.
John stood in battle stance, not even feeling the wood shards from the door as they cut into his bare feet. The Golem laughed and pulled a giant mace out of a bag that was slung over his shoulder.
John gave Sherlock a sly smile. “Do you have an observation Mr. Holmes?” Sherlock shook his head overwhelmed by the betrayal of his body-his desire for John. “Well, perhaps I might shed some light on the situation. You watch my throat as I swallow and you are reminded of something else are you not?” Sherlock’s face blushed a becoming shade of red. John smiled as he teased Sherlock just a little bit more. “Tonight as we lie underneath the stars I will test my hypothesis.”
Mycroft stood up and began to pace, his motions slow and agitated like a caged animal. “Last night was a danger night.”
I stare at her in annoyance. She is right of course. What sane person would bring a baby to 221b Baker Street?
John looked down at Sherlock’s glazed expression and sighed. “Come on, Sherlock, we need to train. We’ve already missed breakfast. I know you don’t like to eat, but I do. We don’t have time to play,” John said sternly and then sighed when Sherlock continued to stare up at him. “Okay, fine but it’s got to be quick and no getting undressed.” John said as he kneeled next to Sherlock. “Let me show you one of the attributes of these wide legged pants,” John said as he rolled up the pant leg, so that he could easily get to Sherlock’s groin. Sherlock gasped for air as John stroked him gently at first and then firmer, and then, “Oh God, harder,” Sherlock begged as he thrust his pelvis into John’s hands. John tried to make things last longer for Sherlock but when John observed Sherlock’s intense facial expressions and quicker heart rate, he knew it was time to help Sherlock finish.
Mycroft nodded and they inched forward into what felt like the cavern of hell. Cold stale air assailed their nostrils and John grimaced. A few moments later he wished for the stale air again. He took a few deep breaths to steady his pounding heart and immediately regretted the decision when the smell of urine, unwashed bodies and the sickening smell of burning toxins overcame his olfactory senses.
John grinned sideways at Sherlock and said,”Of course you do. You are a proper genius, my proper genius.”
John was mentally exhausted though and so he asked Jake a nonchalant question. “Okay, where is Sherlock? I had better check on him. So, lead the way,” John said as he gestured for Jake to take the lead. Their living quarters had the same green columns that adorned all of the buildings and the roof was covered with purple tiles that looked like scales. The front door was the same color as the purple roof tiles. John thanked Jake for showing him to him and Sherlock’s residence and then John waved good-bye as he went inside. The residence was smaller than it appeared from the outside. The main room was nearly empty, the floor was dotted with cushions here and there and there were large blue vases in each corner.
“John, I’m just a little embarrassed,” Sherlock said miserably.
Sherlock stopped his frantic procession and gave him an innocent look. “What?”
Sherlock strained his ears, but didn’t hear anything. Then Rathery screeched out a warning just before a large black winged dragon like creature flew into the courtyard. On its back sat a glowing eyed Yoma. John, Clare, and several other warriors from the complex joined John and Clare. The black evil looking dragon looked at its enemies and decided that the odds weren’t to its liking and it flew off. The Yoma stayed to fight. As always John was the first to challenge it. John and the Yoma circled each other in order to size each other up. Instead of fighting with John the Yoma reached back and grabbed Sherlock by the hair. Sherlock cried out in pain as the Yoma dragged him across the courtyard on his knees. The Yoma laughed cruelly at Sherlock’s dilemma and then raised its clawed hand back so that it could rip Sherlock’s throat out.
“So, I need to revisit the formulation?”
I pull on my pants and trousers. I am angry and I don’t know why. “Good-bye, Anderson,” I say, then leave, wondering why hours later I still can’t dispel the look in his eyes when I left, or the last lingering notes of the Adagio from Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto.
Mycroft’s cheeks felt tight as he smiled and replied. “Hmm, yes it appears so.” He looked through his infra-red goggles and then let them drop as he said, “Dear god in heaven give me patience.”
Sherlock moved back and forth in his chair. “I don’t know.”
“Of course, they did.”
I observe as his eyes lose their luster. Like a corpse he slumps to the ground. I hear pounding; it is not my heart. Someone is knocking on the door.
Mary’s blue eyes bore into mine. “Sherlock, I know you’ve been in love with John ever since the first night I met you and John has been in love with you long before he met me. The fact that you slept together has been a long time coming.”
My fingers dance over the rim of the teacup that sits in front of me. “No, I suppose not.”
Sherlock opened John’s shirt, his skin was not pierced either, and just to make sure Sherlock slid his arms around John’s waist, until he was satisfied that John was unharmed.
Lestrade’s eyes bulge out as he puts a hand over my mouth. “Sherlock, just solve it, don’t predict. I don’t want to have to arrest you on suspicion of murder again.”
“Sherlock, right here, “John whispered as his warm breath tickled Sherlock’s cheek. “Now prepare yourself, for you have been a very bad boy and you need to be punished. “Then Sherlock felt the slight sting of the riding crop against his thigh as he began to shake with anticipation. Usually in these types of bondage John would constantly check with Sherlock to make sure he was still okay.
Mycroft sighed. “Fine, I’ll be there as soon as I can.” Then he disconnected the call, looking down at the phone with a frown.
“They stop talking every time I enter the room, I don’t get it,” the boy said and shrugged.
I awake, feeling like Scarlett O’Hara after Rhett took her up the stairs. Anderson throws off the covers, smiling when he looks down and sees the morning wood I am sporting. “Nice,” he says, then begins to work at dispatching it.
John frowned and then said, “Molly? You mean Molly Hooper your friend that works at the morgue?”
Sherlock frowned again. “John, stop babbling, you’re wreaking havoc with my concentration.”
“John, it’s okay. I’m pretty sure Mycroft had them all killed.” I state in a matter of fact voice.
Anderson doesn’t reply. I hold back my laughter when I see him squirming. With all the cunning of a true predator, I slip my shoe off and press the heel of my foot between his legs. It’s a good thing the music is loud for it covers Anderson’s whimpering. The muscles in his neck tighten then his body goes limp.
When John finally helped him release, Sherlock felt as if he was going to faint. John was barely out of breath as he straddled Sherlock’s sweat drenched body. “Sherlock, I love you. Does your Doctor know best?”
John’s eyes instantly dilated as he glanced where Sherlock was pointing. “Sherlock,” John said as he put his hand roughly between Sherlock’s legs, “we’ve got bigger problems than you and I right now. Throw some cold water on yourself and get out there, NOW.”
Sherlock swiveled his hips forward, making John’s head snap back to rest on his shoulder. “That look,” Sherlock said as he looked into John’s glazed eyes.
You look confused and then realization makes your eyes go wide. “You’re not teasing me? You love me?”
John leaned over the back of the wheelchair and looked up at Sherlock, “Sherlock, it’s okay…I’m not exactly…an object of desire…”
John lifted up the back of Sherlock’s shirt; the bandage had a spot of light seepage coming through. John gently removed the bandage. “Sherlock, just leave your shirt up. I am going to get a couple of things from my bag.”
John nodded, “Uh haw.”
Mycroft fixed his blue eyes on Irene as he whispered through clenched teeth. “I’ve always been there for him and I always will. Now show us what you know about the key or I will splatter your brains against the back of the wall and let brother mine solve the mystery without your assistance.”
Mycroft paled as he looked over at Sherlock. “Irene this is not acceptable.”
He is sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. “Are you alright?” I ask.
“How can he switch gears so quickly?” John thought as Sherlock rambled on about his creative process of painting. “Doesn’t he care about my feelings at all? Do I not arouse him, please him, and titillate him? Oh, God worse yet, do I bore him?” John thought in despair.
“Oh, John what are we going to do?”
“No, I love you, John,” I say in a small voice.
I smile at the slowness in which her mind works. “Annette, dear that’s what I’m counting on, I will be your Sherlock Holmes look alike sex worker. Is my John Watson a trust worthy ally?”
John looked down and then met Sherlock’s eyes. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I don’t know what go into me. Maybe I need something to get into me,” John said as he suggestively smiled at Sherlock. John then came and whispered into Sherlock’s ear. “Imagine making love in this cave while being pursued by Golem, it makes me hot with desire to think of it.” John turned around so that his motions were hidden from the other members of their party. He softly brushed his hand against Sherlock’s crotch and smiled smugly. “It looks as if you feel the same way, Sherlock. Better get some cold water, for we can’t play with all these hangers on and a dragon too.” John turned away without another word and motioned for the party to follow him. Sherlock’s loins ached with desire as he stumbled along after John. “The old John would have never played him like this”, Sherlock thought in despair.
John leaned forward as he said, “The statue that is supposed to be made of gold from the Temple in Jerusalem?”
Sherlock nodded and was about to say, “Me too,” when his phone beeped stating he had a message. At about the same time John’s phone beeped as well. They both looked at their phones read then messages and then swapped phones so that they could each read each other’s messages.
“Well, it happened in New Orleans during the recording of “Let Them Talk”. After a late night recording session I walked out of the studio to call a cab. I was drunk off my ass and decided to walk back to my hotel. Not very wise of me, but I was drunk.”
Clare clutched her arm, as she walked over and stood in front of Sherlock. “You have to leave now,” Clare said solemnly.
John nodded, as he kissed Sharon on the side of the cheek. Afterwards she looked down for a moment and then caressed John’s face, “I’m happy for you and just keep in mind if you ever need me I’ll be there for you.”
Sherlock took John’s hand and led him to a waiting cab. “Come on, John, home to Baker Street.”
“Good to see you too, Mycroft.”
“Your kisses are worth waiting for, burrrh,” John sang and then began to play an imaginary set of drums.
“Well, we’ll see about that. Where is that damn healer anyway?” Sherlock asked as he looked around. As the needle slipped into his neck Sherlock cursed himself for not being more alert to his surroundings. Then-darkness-nothing.
“We’ll be in touch,” Sherlock said as he removed his hand up to push the chair. He moved his hand in front of John’s nostrils, just long enough for his own musky scent to flood John’s olfactory senses. Then without another word he turned the chair around and wheeled John into the men’s restroom. Once they were in a stall, Sherlock knelt down on the floor and unbuckled John’s trousers.
Anderson chuckles. “Ahh, Sherlock you are such a bad boy-my addiction.”
“Well, we sort of hire ourselves out to gain information and to take things,” Laura said.
I shake my head. “John, please don’t talk. It will distract me.”
Irene turned on him in a rage. “It’s my key from my family.”
John sighed and said, “Aww, Sherlock what am I going to do with you?”
The last chords of Hugh’s last song faded away. He stood up thanked the crowd and then disappeared off of the stage. A few moments later a figure in a black hoodie came up to Sherlock and John’s table. Without a word he pulled a gun out of his pocket, fired a couple shots into John’s chest. The plasma bag burst covering Sherlock and the shooter with red spray. The shooter then turned to Sherlock as he whispered, “I’m truly sorry, Sherlock.”
“I want to say something. What…WHAT? Oh, John we are both blind. We see but we do not deduce. We dare not deduce. I then rest my head against your arm. As I fall asleep I hear you and Mycroft auguring about my treatment. I smile for you are with me-John.”
John’s mouth stood open as Sherlock breezed in through the open door, “God he’s magnificent, so full of life,” John thought as Sherlock nervously paced the perimeters of the room, his long, black coat trailing behind him.
John shook his head, the tears openly spilling down his face by this time, “Please, let’s change the subject,” he begged. “Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
Sherlock ground his teeth.
I am uneasy but I smile anyway. “Anything for you, Mary. What is it?” I ask as I watch the people below us. Some are talking. Some are stretching. Only a few sit in dazed shock from the power of Mozart’s music.
“John, where are your clothes? Did you just walk out here naked?” Sherlock asked in surprise, for John had always been the modest one.
Sherlock opened the door to Baker Street, knowing that Mrs. Hudson would be waiting for him.
An got up from the floor, carefully skirting around John, and stood before Sherlock. “It is obvious that I have been attacked, so perhaps I could say I was injured when you three escaped. However, you are going to need some help interpreting the Chinese texts that contain the stories about the end of days. I will talk to my cousin; he is an expert in ancient Chinese. In the meantime, you must go quickly. Come,” she beckoned, “this way.” An with the help of Clare pulled open a door that An unlocked, and they made their way through the darkened passages of an old abandoned sewer system. As they quietly walked through the tunnels, An whispered directions on how to find their way out to Sherlock. “I have to go now, I will be missed. Sherlock, can you find your way back?”
John rolled over and began massage Sherlock’s neck as the music of Fats Waller, “Ain’t Misbehaving”, filled the room. John began to hum along with the music, which Sherlock found utterly enchanting and before long Sherlock began to relax.
“Beautiful, aren’t they?” Irene whispered in Mycroft’s ear, running her long nails down the back of his neck. “We must keep them safe. It would be a shame if something happened to one of them. How long do you think Sherlock would last without his Doctor or vice versa?” When Mycroft didn’t answer, Irene continued. “Who would have thought that Sherlock Holmes would have found true love? That’s something that you and I will never know.”
After he shut the door Sherlock rushed to John’s side, “Come on we’re getting out of here on one of the life rafts that I saw in…”
John shifted his hip and grunted as if he were in pain and then turned his face away from Sherlock so as not to reveal the lie he was going to tell him. “I told Laura that you were a spend-thrift and that I needed the money.”
Sherlock dug a warning finger nail into John’s neck. “Hugh, let’s get down to business, shall we?”
“Sherlock, you don’t honestly expect to take her on cases, do you?”
John started to get angry and then joined Sherlock in laughter. “We are docking today. How would you like to go ashore and meet a lady?”
Sherlock reached up and felt his cheeks. “I’m walking upstairs,” he whispered.
Teddy was blushing furiously as he avoided John’s gaze, “I say I didn’t mean to offend Watson, old boy. Let me make it up to you. Why don’t you join us at the Captain’s table, you know the “A” list?”
“Sherlock, slow down,” John laughed as the wheelchair careened wildly around another corner.
“Sherlock, are you okay?” John called out in a frantic tone.
Anderson’s face is pale. “I’m tired, Sherlock. Just sit with me a little while.”
Once inside the flat, Anderson and I go about our work in silence. “The victim is male, in his 30’s and appears to have choked on a piece of the roast beef he was eating,” Anderson states aloud as he encircles the body like a hound treeing its prey.
“Then how….,” Sherlock started to ask and then trailed off as John finished his sentence.
“My…my sister. She looks like me, her eyes are dark but they see the battlefield like mine do. She is not on the side of angels. She is evil.”
Sherlock nodded and then looked back at John and said softly, “That thing you did, calling me Fernando so that I would focus, that was brilliant.”
“Sherlock, did you ever find out what her puzzle was?”
You squeeze my hand. “Sherlock, wherever you are come back and look at me.”
Laura took a long seductive drag on her cigarette, “Evening out the score, John, evening out the score.”
My heart sinks like a stone in my chest. This isn’t about love for you. It’s just lust. My eyes brim over with tears. What have I done?  Like a virginal bride on her wedding I look down at the ground. Then I lie on my back and stare up at you. You stop your preparations. “Sherlock, what is it? This is what you wanted, isn’t it?” I nod unable to meet your eyes. “Sherlock, you have done this before? Jesus, you’re not a virgin are you? You can’t be you went undercover as a sex worker.” You say aloud as you bite your lower lip.
Ugh, my poor Destiel heart! I hope those two work it out. I'm not pleased with the way Dean has been treating Cas.
By the time they pulled back from each other, they were both a bit breathless. Lips swollen and tingling.
"Is...Is he..?" Lestrade tried to swallow the lump back down, but the sting of tears kept it firmly in place.
“Just this.” Dean said, producing the folded piece of paper from his pocket. “I haven’t looked at it yet.”
Lestrade eyed the tall man suspiciously. He clasped a firm hand around one of Sherlock's forearms, preventing him from getting any closer to the body lying in the alleyway. It was still swarmed by half of the forensic team anyway. Greg's gaze intensified as he soaked in the sight before him. The raggedy appearance, the dilated pupils, and the buzzing energy overflowing and causing Sherlock to bounce on his heels.
"Why?" He pushed. Mycroft sighed into the crook of his neck. "Don't do this. Not tonight."
“Okay.” Dean acquiesced. “Good. Now we know how to make Sam better.”
He allowed a curious hand to venture under John's shirt and reveled at the heat and softness of the flesh there. Not that John was particularly soft. There was very firm muscle just below the thin barrier of cushion. A very nice contrast, indeed.
"I had asked you if you trusted me, because I had deduced that a kiss between us, two gentlemen, would provide the perfect distraction to get to the killer. I saw an opportunity that night, and I took it. Also, bravo on your part, you really sold it...why are you looking at me like that?"
“Can’t?” Mycroft questioned, not believing his brother in the slightest.
Fortunately for Sherlock and John, the drunken man turned his attention to the bartender.
"At least I'm not a jerk." Sam threw back.
Castiel's head righted itself and his lips pulled tight for a moment before he answered. "Because God commanded it." The angel asserted. His eyes locked onto Dean's. "We have work for you."
Greg almost chocked on his beer. “Sorry?” He sputtered.
********************************
John shook his head. “Now hang on a minute, I didn’t mean that in a…”
“John.” Sherlock simply greeted, plucking a string on his violin.
“Crowley.” Cas seethed before stumbling. Dean caught him and held onto him tighter. As he helped Cas into the backseat next to Kevin, the angel told him something that made his blood run cold. “Crowley, he…Dean, he has the angel tablet.”
"Please do see to it that Sherlock is not charged with anything substantial. I feel obligated to inform you that your career would be in jeopardy should you ever choose to disregard my recommendations." It was said lightly but with a firm sense of certainty.
"London is a
"Oh, please." Sherlock rolled his blood shot eyes. Lestrade shoved him ungracefully into the back seat, slammed the door, and then locked it. "I'll deal with you after I wrap up here."
*****************************
The Winchester brothers were sitting in leather armchairs, in the middle of confronting the newly found scribe of God.
"If you don't want your boyfriend to die, then I suggest you stay exactly where you are. Don't move."
John looked over at Sherlock, laid out on the couch with a bandage around his head and a neck brace on, and thanked God that he was still alive.
