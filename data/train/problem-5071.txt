“So it’s actually a butt plug?” Dr. Stark asks after tapping on Steve’s shoulder a couple of times “You know, the ones that have wide bases?” he adds, and he sounds ever so skeptical, which is just enough to bring back the gut-stirring shame in full force and make Steve’s palms sweaty again.
It’s unfair and it’s absolutely painful, but it’s the fucking right thing to do. It takes Tony every single bit of his will power though, to let go of the edge of the desk, cup Steve’s face and bring it up so he can see Steve’s eyes. “Steve, what are you doing?”
And Steve … he feels that he has been a total dick about it. He feels that he needs to kick his own ass right now, as he has been a self-centered prick, too overwhelmed all the time, that he has not taken a second to do something for anyone else, especially the man who’s held his hand through the ups and downs of the roller coaster that’s been the past couple of days.
He can’t go to sleep. He checks his emails on his laptop that arrived earlier that afternoon, right before the press conference. He replies to a couple, but he can’t focus, and even finding the box of Zaro's black and white cookies with Nat and Clint's silly note doesn’t make him feel any better. He is jittery and unsettled. He feels horrible.
Steve pulls the covers over them and makes sure that Tony is tucked in and warm. He loves the way it all feels right with Tony, he tells himself as he closes his eyes and presses Tony to his chest, just a bit further.
Steve runs his hand in Tony’s hair and something prickles his scalp, moves through his spine all the way to the tip of his toes. He closes his eyes and gasps when Steve’s fingers trail down the side of his face and, God, touch his lips. He’s not sure how good of an idea it would be to part his lips and taste them right now.
“That video is only two minutes forty-five seconds. I’ve watched it countless times since that day, but back then it took hours and hours for the breathtaking suit to sway across the sky before it disappeared. Something changed, something moved. Something melted in my heart. I started to feel warm again and stopped shaking and my teeth stopped chattering. Just like that, like a magic spell, I wasn’t terrified anymore.”
Steve is not sure if it’s physically possible to be more turned on than he is right now. Or embarrassed for that matter as he is cherry red all over and he is absolutely leaking in his underwear. He nods and probably blushes some more because Tony’s eyes get even softer and yet darker with intent.
Tony wishes that he was doing something else right now; something where he could happily take Steve up on his offer to help. And it’s not like he can’t start
Someone gasps and Nat digs her fingers into the flesh of Steve’s arm which does nothing to keep him in place, obviously, as he finds himself right back in Tony’s space, with Nat practically dangling along. Steve’s aware, vaguely, that punching Tony is a horrible idea, and that’s what makes him keep it together within an inch of raising his hand. That, and the faint citrus scent that comes like a slap in the face, to bring him to his senses, a reminder that he will never hit an omega, no matter what.
This is not possible. The way Tony’s on fire from head to toe, the way he is weightless and absorbed as if he doesn’t exist at all, only Steve. This is how it must feel to be a star gravitating toward a black hole; not that Steve is a black hole, and fuck, he truly hopes that he hasn’t said any of that out loud.
“Tony needs a change of clothes.” Nat twitches her lips when she smiles. It’s reassuring and calm and takes Tony’s mind off the true meaning of her words, at least for a little bit.
Tony is gentle and relentless and Steve can’t quite figure out how those two things can be true at the same time. He is smaller than Steve, height and build and all, but Steve feels absolutely powerless in his hands. He allows Tony to drag him along to the bedroom of what seems to be a luxurious penthouse and goes easily as Tony pushes him onto the enormous white bed, gentle but firm.
He opens his mouth, sips the too-sweet water and blames the sudden rush of glucose for the instant feeling of warmth and the heat that is most probably shading his cheeks pink. Nothing to do with the bergamot scent. Or the insanely calming smile.
“We’re whatever you want us to be, Steve,” And he forces a smile because hopefully, this can mean many things in many contexts.
He doesn’t remember when he stops to dance, but the sun is shining in the sky when he opens his eyes. There is a woolen throw covering his feet and chest, and something is lingering in the air, a warm presence maybe, a vague feeling of a kiss that someone had placed on Steve's cheek, that doesn't seem to have happened in the dancing dream.
Tony’s eyes start to sting, and he focuses on breathing in and out as Captain Rogers talks about his house, the lightfilled rooms, the buzz of the neighborhood and the ridiculous tax rates.
There was a small knock behind Steve and he turned to see Tony standing there, looking half asleep in a robe. “Leave the boy alone Steve. You’re just wasting his eating time.” He gave a small wink to Peter and shuffled into the bathroom. “Everyone get out! I gotta take a piss.”
Nodding, Gwen turned his face from side to side, checking for bruising and cuts. “Yes, and your name is?”
"Get in here, nerd." The man said as he pulled Peter into the house, his single star tattoo arm wrapping around the others neck to pull him in. Once Peter put the plastic container down, he was pulled into a tight embrace. "Missed you like crazy kid. Merry Christmas."
It felt like an hour which could only have been a single minute; Gwen finally tore her eyes away to look at the ground. "We are one plate short, um, for dinner. Do you want to come over? For Christmas dinner that is." Gwen sounded so hopeful and was shyly looking at her boots instead of his eyes.
Harry looked down to the floor nervously. “I saw that your dad was being rushed to the hospital on the news. I...I wanted to come and support you.”
Peter had no choice now. He took off the hood, but kept his head down. It didn’t take long for his father to notice the swellings. He placed his hand under Peter’s chin and lifted his head to get a better view. “Not as bad as it looks.” Peter said with a grin.
He was amazed that she understood his world of photographic meaning. He tried to say something, but it ended with just his mouth opening and closing a few times before he smiled and nodded his head a few times. When Gwen nodded her head as well, they both broke out into small laughter. Peter seemed to relax a bit and let his shoulders drop. “Yeah, that’s the exact concept I was aiming for.” He finally said, all of it coming out smooth and not in a fit of broken words and stutters.
"I love you too." Peter said even though the lines were disconnected. Putting his cellphone down, Peter sighed and pushed his keyboard away. "Don't you dare cry. You're too old for that." Peter half yelled at himself as his hands rubbed his face vigorously.
Sitting next to him, Bucky handed Peter a burger anyways. “Eat.” There was a silence for a while as they are. “Don’t you dare contact that kid. His number is blocked, leave it that way.”
Once again he prayed she couldn’t feel his heart pounding. Peter looked to his watch, it was really late. “I’ll walk you home. Make sure you get there okay.”
The bell rang and Peter flew out his seat and out the door quickly. But he knew Flash was just as quick to chasing after him. Running down the hall, he shoved his way into the staircase and flew down the stairs, skipping some, in hopes of making it to his next class without a sore rib. “Peter!” He heard from way too close behind him. As he pushed through the doors into the next hallway, it was packed with students. Peter pushed through the crowd and receiving complaints from the students around him. Someone tripped him, and Peter hit the floor hard, pain shooting up his elbow. He rolled over, grabbing at his elbow and sighing in pain.
Peter opened the front door and ushered the reluctant dog inside. Kicking off his boots, Peter made his way into the kitchen. "Morning dad." Peter said when Tony was spotted at the stove.
I know it feels like we’re saying goodbye, but we will carry a piece of each other into everything that we do next,  to remind us of who we are, and of who we’re meant to be. I’ve had a great four years with you, and I’ll miss you all very much.”
He got home and took Jarvis out for a quick walk. The house was quiet, when he arrived. Checking in on his dads, they were both asleep, the TV still on. Peter quietly searched for the remote and turned off the television, smiling as they didn’t flinch or wake at the lack of sound.
Peter went to sit in the recliner by the Christmas tree and rocked slightly. He thanked the man for the controller as it was handed to him before answering the question. "School is school. How goes being a super-secret spy? Did you get your next mission yet?" Peter asked with a large smile.
Harry frowned and nodded. “Yeah. I was. Hope your dad is okay, Peter. Number is the same.” He said before turning and leaving.
Steve took a seat across from the teen and smiled. “No, I suppose I’ll spare you this morning. Hurry up though, I’ll drive you to school.”
They carried idle conversation while they ate. Finally both stuffed and unable to eat another bite, they started packing the food away. Peter made sure to grab a good amount for Tony to eat as well to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. With the food all packed away and the kitchen cleaned, Bucky invited Peter into the living room to play games.
“Yeah.” Gwen said quickly. “I mean, I’ve never done any myself. But I’ve always loved to interpret what others capture.” She spoke in a rush and then smiled after, laughing.
“You’re right. This is your battle. Just...do the right thing.” Steve fixed his cap and took his keys out of his pocket. “I’ve got to get back. But this conversation isn’t over young man. Room, now.”
Tony stood quiet for a moment. The sound of papers on the other end made Peter understand the momentary silence before Tony even spoke. "I'm backed up here, kiddo. I won't be home until the early morning. Don't wait up. You got school tomorrow?" Tony asked.
Peter woke up with his husky puppy cuddled at his feet under the blanket. He yawned and reached for his phone. The light was strong and caused him to squint his eyes, but he fought through to read the text that had come through from Gwen. “Good morning. Hope you had a wonderful Christmas. Still holding you to your word. See you at South Street Seaport at six tonight.” Peter read the message out loud before tossing his phone somewhere on the bed.
Peter shook his head; soon realizing that she wasn't looking up at him and had no idea he technically answered her question. "No. But I don't really want to do this professionally." He answered honestly.
“Yes sir.” Peter said, smiling at his father. It was nice to have Steve actually give him a chance to take care of something by himself. He made a mental note that his sometimes stuck up military father has a soft side that loves and worries for his family’s safety. He made another mental note to seriously thank Gwen tomorrow. Not only did she help him, but this gives him another chance to speak to her. And maybe it will turn into more chances. Peter lay on his bed, the pain of the day kicking in once more. He got up, took some aspirin, and threw himself back on the bed, pulling the covers over him and finally going to sleep.
“No, Uncle Bucky, it’s ok.” Peter grabbed onto his uncle's arm and pulled him back. “He was just here to send his good wishes. He was leaving.” Peter looked at Harry with pleading eyes. His uncle would not stand for Harry staying there to support him. Uncle Bucky was there for him through his depression after the incident. He knew how hurt he was.
“That’s funny, because I could have sworn I heard it go off at exactly zero-seven hundred hours.” He leaned against the door frame while Peter chewed the inside of his bottom lip and then smiled with a shrugged.
“That’s true.” Peter chuckled. “But the crowds are low. That’s always a good thing.” He got them large cups of hot chocolate and they picked a seat closest to the large windows to look out at the view of the Brooklyn Bridge.
The faucet was shut off and the sound of heels brought Peter to look at his caretaker. Gwen grabbed some paper towels from the dispenser and patted Peter’s face dry. He was in such shock and flustered that he just watched as she carefully dried the now swollen bruises on his face. “Don’t worry, no one comes in this bathroom. Hasn’t worked all year. Except the sinks of course.” She tossed the paper towels into the nearby trash.
Peter looked up to the ceiling, the smile never leaving his face. It wouldn’t even if he tried. “I was thinking around east midtown. They have a bunch of houses there that decorate every year.” He looked back down at her, holding his books in one arm and keeping his other firmly in his pocket.
Since the class started, Peter has had an incredible amount of paper balls thrown at him from the bully sitting behind him. It’s only ten minutes into the class, but Flash was wasting no time in crumbling up another sheet. Peter sighed to himself. “Not like he was going to use them anyways.” He mumbled to himself as he tried to pay attention to the board and copy notes as another paper hit his shoulder and landed on his desk. He pushed it off his desk, the paper joining the growing pile at the side of his desk.
After taking a long walk out in the cold, Peter returned quietly home and went straight to his room. Part of him wanted to check if Tony had poured the spiked coffee down the drain, but the stubborn half of him wanted to keep his father at a distance to portray his anger. He loved his father and regretting some of the things he had said, but he could only try so hard. Locking himself in his room, Peter stripped of the semi wet and cold clothes and started to look for clothes for his date. Was this considered a date?
They began to walk and soon enough the lined houses came into view. They were decorated practically ground to roof in lights and signs. Peter turned on his camera and began snapping away. Gwen watched him with a smile, she spoke about how she loved the decorations and which were her favorites. “Can you teach me?” She asked suddenly.
Smiling brightly, Gwen swayed on her feet. "Okay. Okay good. I'll text you on Christmas and let you know what time. I mean, I was going to text you on Christmas anyways. But...I'm rambling." She laughed just as the bell rang. "We're late. I'll see you later Peter!" Gwen waved as she rushed off down the hall.
“Don’t touch my hair.” Peter quickly pulled the graduation cap onto his head and held it down while walking towards the front door.
Nodding, Bucky seemed to accept that as an answer and turned his attention back to the game. “Well, if anything happens just let me know. I have no problem putting that punk in his place.” They had played for quite some hours when Bucky’s phone went off. Ignoring Peter’s quick questions of who was it and if it was his next mission, Bucky answered the phone. “Hey Stark. Shut up Peter, it’s your dad.”
Steve rolled his eyes as he was fixated on fixing his own tie. “Can’t believe you are graduating high school when you think the earth can get to a million degrees. Are you sure you didn’t cheat on any test?” He joked, finishing his handy work on his bowtie and grabbing his blazer. “It’s too late to change anyways, we gotta go. Peter, go grab my bag in the kitchen please?”
Tony nodded and stood from the table. "Well I'll be in my room. Self loathing." He walked away and headed up the stairs.
"Never really good at writing. English class isn't my best subject." Peter playfully retorted. They had stopped walking and now looked at each other in comfortable silence.
Tony smiled. “That’s my boy.” He pulled Peter into a hug. “Congratulations. And yes, we are going with the Stacy’s for Dim Sum. Harry...will you, uh…be joining us?” The words were choked out, but Tony was making an effort.
The meal was filled with chatter and idle conversation. Harry and Tony ignored everyone else as they began speaking mechanics and Peter know Harry had finally won Tony over. Soon the food was gone, the bill was paid, and they all left the restaurant.
Doing as instructed, Peter sat down and the two started to fill that plates. There was way too much good for just the two of them, but he already knew his Uncle had made extra for his parents. Well, at least for Tony since Steve wouldn't be home for another few days. Before they started eating, Bucky said his grace. Steve often did the same thing on holidays and large gatherings. Peter and Tony shared different beliefs from the best friends but respected them nonetheless. At this moment with only the two of them, Peter bowed his head and waited for Bucky to finish. Once it was over, they dug in.
Reaching over the cabinet nearest Steve, Peter made eye contact for a moment and they smiled at each other. Peter could already tell what the dinner conversation was going to be, but he didn’t fear it now as he did earlier. Not after what Steve had told him before he knocked out. But he did still have to explain to Tony why he had some bruises on his face. Good thing everything seems to have swelled down after his nap. Setting the table, Peter sat in his chair and watched as his father’s finish up their cooking.
Staying there for a moment longer, Steve straightened up and ruffled Peter’s hair. “Just press the call button.” With that he walked down the hall and descended the stairs.
Nodding, Peter looked down at his clothes. He wore light blue jeans and a button down red shirt, the top two buttons open. He looked back at his father and smiled a bit. “Going out to take pictures.” He had to admit his attire said differently, but that actually was the truth.
The door opened and Tony leaned against the door frame in his robe and smiled at the teen. “Hey kiddo. Just wishing you a good night.”
Nodding, Steve took a step back and sighed. “I see. Well, we’ll just have to give this Flash kid a little scare now, won’t we?”
Steve tilted his head to the side and glanced Peter up and down for a moment. “Going somewhere?” He asked, obviously amused.
Steve stepped inside and closed the door behind him. “Peter get down here!” He yelled. He waited a moment until Peter slowly descended halfway down the stairs. Steve pointed in front of him and Peter sighed, walking the rest of the way down the stairs to stand in front of the much taller man. “Take off the damn hood.” Steve said, crossing his arms.
"Bit of both." Peter said as he took off his jacket and draped it over the back of a chair. "I mean I did have to buy it from the store. But after buying it all, I cooked it. Even peeled and mashed the potatoes myself!" He laughed and laughed even harder from the look Bucky was giving him.
Peter could not figure out how he wasn’t melting into the snow right now, or how his legs were even moving. It sure wasn’t on his own because his mind couldn’t focus on walking. All he could think about was his arm wrapped with Gwen’s own and how fast his heart was beating. He heard the whispers around him, saw the faces turning their way, but he didn’t care. If this moment could last forever, he’d capture it on his camera and print it immediately. But it also scared him.
Holding up his free hand in mock surrender, Peter chuckled. "After Christmas and before New Year’s I'm all yours." He laughed before blushing at his choice of words. "I-I mean, I'm coming...I'll be there! For dinner, that is. After Christmas but--and it'll be fun." Peter decided to stop speaking before he dug himself any deeper.
He didn’t look at his phone for a moment, but he felt the vibrations of response. He was nervous for some reason, but finally looked at his phone.
Feeling the trouble today, Peter turned around, Flash’s book in his hands and set off to doing every problem wrong. He finished off his own work before handing Flash back his notebook and standing to hand his work in to the teacher. The teacher looked most unpleasant at having Peter up there first, but checked off his work and half congratulated him on getting them all right.
"That's alright, I've got a can in the cabinet." Bucky said as he grabbed the container and led the way into the kitchen. "Is all of this store bought or did you actually manage to cook some of it?"
He sighed in relief and blushed when she gave him a greeting hug. “Glad you made it.” He said, his throat drier than he thought. Quickly he cleared his throat and smiled at her. “This way.” He said, pointing in the direction.
No matter how buried it gets, or lost you feel, you must promise me, that you will hold on to hope and keep it alive. We have to be greater than what we suffer. My wish for you, is to become hope. People need that. I know that we all think we’re immortal, we’re supposed to feel that way, we’re graduating.
Steve turned the radio off and put the heat higher. “So, are you going to tell me what happened at school today?”
Shaking his head, Peter stood up and helped her up as well. “It’s okay.” Exiting the train, they walked in a comfortable silence to her apartment building. Peter noticed it was a very tall building at first and looked very classy. The doorman out in front nodded his head to Gwen and smiled as he opened the door and let them in. They took the elevator up to the twentieth floor.
It only ever seemed he had no clothes when he actually wanted to dress nicely. Meeting with Gwen shouldn't be this nerve wrecking. But for Peter it was proving to be so. Even though they've gone out before, something about the holidays made it seem a bit more romantic to him. Figuring they'd have coats on, it didn't really matter what he wore underneath. He grabbed a white t-shirt and black sweater, closing his closet door with a bit of disapproval at it. It didn't do him much justice this time.
Taking his seat, Peter watched as Flash got up from his seat with only a minute left of class to get his work checked off. Grabbing his bag and shoving his books into it, Peter watched as the teacher looked over the work and shook his head. He’ll have to run to his next class if he didn’t want to go home with a black eye. Flash turned to glare at him, and Peter couldn’t help the smirk that came onto his face. Now Peter watched the clock as Flash returned to his seat. Ten seconds to go. He was already halfway off his seat. The sound of books being shoved quickly into a bag behind him. Five seconds.
“I will.” Peter said as he hugged his uncle and then rushed out into the cold. Getting into the car, he buckled his seat belt and waved goodbye as Tony pulled the car away. “How was work?” Peter asked as he sat back in his seat.
When Peter shook his head and looked back out the window, the light turned green in his favor and Steve was forced to pay attention to the road. They were quiet the rest of the ride. The truck pulled up in front of their house and Peter grabbed his bag, opening the door quickly. “I’ll see you later.” He got out of the truck and shut the door, hurrying up the small steps to the door.
“Yeah, okay, so I’ll see you in a bit.” When she agreed, they said their goodbyes and hung up. Peter shoved his phone into his pocket and grabbed his camera and wallet. He ran down the stairs and quickly got his sneakers on, grabbing his coat and keys.
Running a hand over his face quickly, Peter felt no swelling but knew there were still light bruises on his face. “Thanks.” He said, this time a little louder. “I also--thank...for yesterday, you know?” He spoke with his hands moving all over the place and quickly shoved them into his pockets. Looking down to the snow covered ground and smiling.
"Dad!" Peter flushed as he got the milk out and refused to look at his father. He didn't say anything else though. After all, Tony was right. Steve not being home was taking a toll on the poor guy. Even Peter wasn't as distraught. But for a married couple, military life is hard. Sitting down at the table, Peter placed a comforting hand on his dad's shoulder and smiled. "Don't take it personal dad. You know he would have been here if he could have been."
Peter looked down at her, his brows creased in confusion. "I-I'm sorry...um...what?" Peter shook his head in confusion and waited for an answer.
"So, how goes school?" Bucky asked as he turned on the television and the gaming system, handing Peter one of the controllers.
Peter thought for a moment. As a kid he used to cry. Only an hour ago he had wanted to do the exact same thing. Then he got angry at himself for wanting to cry, and then Gwen had called. Yet that wasn't the case when he was younger. He and Gwen had only recently started speaking and hanging out. He thought for a moment more before finally giving her the best answer he could come up with. "The anger. Like I said before, you have every right to be angry. And you should be angry. Because it's something you should never have to accept. Your father putting himself in the line of danger is a risk. Never give in to the fact that it's 'just his job' cause then if something bad happens... 'just his job' won't deem him the hero he is. So be angry and never stop. In the end he knows it's because you're scared. And you're scared because you love him." Peter took a deep breath and laughed sheepishly. "Sorry, I didn't mean to preach." He scratched the back of his head as he spoke.
They said their goodbyes just as he finished getting ready. Looking down at the puppy, Peter pet his head and smiled. "You can't come with me. Though I'm sure Gwen would love to see you." He told the dog. "Maybe next time." Peter rushed downstairs and grabbed his coat, leaving before he changed his mind about bringing Jarvis with him.
Tony and Steve glanced at each other and then looked down to their plates. It was Tony that looked up at Peter first and motioned for him to sit close to the table once more. “Sorry son. We didn’t mean to…argue.” Picking his fork back up, Tony looked down at his plate. “Peter, what happened at school today? Heard there was some incident.”
Taking up his camera again, Peter stood in the middle of the parking lot and snapped a picture of the school building. It looked eerie this empty so early in the morning. The sun was up, but the clouds covering it gave it a gloom depressed look. Perfect for a high school. Peter smiled at the thought and took a few more shots. There were some soft footsteps behind him but he paid no mind, simply checking his camera, trying not to be caught taking pictures of the school. Others didn’t understand photography like him.
The sun was already coming up when he finished his editing and started printing them. As they printed, Peter left to take a shower and wash up, returning to his room and dressing for the school day ahead. The final picture finished printing just as his alarm clock went off. Peter shut his alarm clock off and scooped up the pictures, placing them into a folder and putting the folder carefully into his backpack.
Seeming as if this was not an answer she had been expecting to hear, Gwen looked up at Peter. "What do you mean? Peter these...no one can take these pictures." She pulled one of the pictures out to emphasize her point. "Look at this! It's really outstanding."
Peter took his time as he finished up his own work and then Flash's. The longer he took to hand in the work, the larger his head start will be. With only a minute left, Peter turned in his seat and handed Flash the paper before rushing to the front desk to hand his in to the very unamused teacher. Once his paper was marked off, Peter returned to his seat and scooped all his belongings into the bag just as his bully went to the front desk. The bell rang and Peter was out the door the moment the teacher looked down at the paper.
Harry was panting, as though he had been running. His black peacoat was covered in a shiny layer of melted snow. “I...I saw it on the news.” There was silence as Peter stared at Harry for a while, his mouth slightly open in clear shock. “I’m sorry. I know I shouldn’t have come. But…”
Peter immediately recognized the voice as Gwen’s and he turned around quickly to see her standing just a few steps away from him. He smiled at her and waved a shy hand, letting his camera go so it hung once more. “Morning.” He said just above a whisper. He hated his shyness.
Gwen slid her arm into his and giggled. “It was fun for me too. I can’t wait to taste this pizza you spoke of.”
Peter still wasn’t ready to say he was going somewhere with anyone. He knew it was just Tony being protective of him because of what happened. But he didn’t want them to put their two sense in. For some reason, it boiled Peter’s blood. That’s what made shit hit the fan last time. “By myself, dad. I’m going out by myself. Can I go now?”
“Where are you?” Steve replied roughly. Anger was clear in his voice, but Peter could hear the worry and panic in his voice as well.
Steve eyed the mess of hair on his son’s head and crossed his arms. “I don’t know. I think it’s time for a haircut.”
The train stopped at the 63rd street station in which he transferred to the six train. Peter felt that he was making good timing and within the next twenty minutes he had made it to his destination. Gwen wasn’t there yet and he was happy about that, but of course his mind began rummaging through the negatives. Maybe this was a trick and she wasn’t going to come. Maybe she would tell everyone how he waited out there in the cold and dark for her and she had no intentions of going in the first place. Just as he began feeling that unsettlement in his stomach, he felt a pat on the back and turned to see Gwen smiling up at him.
Harry wore a slim dark blue suit to match Peter’s own. “I’m pretty sure this color matches me better then it does you.” He smirked.
Peter snickered and looked over to Tony in the kitchen. “Hey dad, remember when we had to fix the engine three times in one hour?” He asked then shoved another spoonful of cereal into his mouth.
“They do the fireworks at night here. Want to get on the Wonder Wheel before they start?” Harry asked, taking Peter’s other hand and rubbing smooth circles with his thumb.
“No!” Tony and Peter yelled in unison. Peter grabbed Harry’s hand and quickly pulled him out of the house, following Tony to the car.
“Flash!” Peter heard someone yell. There was arguing. Yelling. But of what Peter had no idea. The bell rang and the first stupid thought that came to Peter’s mind was that he was late to class again. “Hey.” Someone said to him, snapping their fingers in front of his face.
A moment passed. Steve crossed his arms but couldn’t really get a word out. If there is one thing he noticed it’s that Peter looked really happy. He looked him up and down. He was dressed like any other day. His backpack slung over his shoulder, a pop tart in his hand, his camera hanging around his neck. Steve smiled slightly and shook his head, letting his arms fall to his sides. “Have a good day at school.”
Steve took his seat as Tony brought a hot pan around and placed hot spaghetti onto each of their plates. Setting the pot back onto the stove, Tony then brought three water bottles to the table and handed them around before finally taking his seat. “Dinner is served!” He boasted proudly. “This pasta is handmade, so hope you enjoy it. I’ve never made it before. Might kill all of us.” He picked up his fork and twirled it around in the strings, moving them to soak up the sauce.
Gwen nodded her head and took a few steps back. “Yep. Okay, see you later.” She turned on her heels and walked away, taking a glance back and smiling at him once more.
“Out. But I have my phone, so I’ll call if anything.” With that, he waved off his dads and met back up with Gwen and Harry.
Peter sat between Gwen and Harry, currently speaking to Gwen while Harry had a heated debate with Tony about something scientific; though Peter was glad to see them getting along. Steve was speaking with Captain Stacy and his wife, one officer to another it seemed.
Steve on the other hand, dropped his fork onto the plate and sat back in his chair. “This sucks.” Closing his eyes for a moment, Peter looked over at Steve and raised his eyebrows. Sighing, Steve picked his fork back up and smiled at Tony. “I’m just messing with you. It’s…good.” He twirled some more strings around his fork and took his time in bringing it back up to his lips.
Peter looked to her hand. “One of those punches must have messed up my glasses.” He said sheepishly. In truth, the room was spinning and all he wanted to do was go to sleep. It was a nanosecond later that cold water was being splashed on his face. Peter woke with a start and stood up abruptly. He looked around to see he was in a school bathroom. The worst part was it was the girl’s bathroom. “What?” He asked, suddenly feeling wide awake as the cold water dripped down to his shirt, making his chest feel cold.
“Thank you, sir.” Peter looked over to Tony, his sunglasses hiding his eyes. “Are we gonna go eat now? I’m starving.”
Today was the day at last. Peter was about to put high school behind him and live his life to the fullest. Looking in the mirror by the door, he liked the blue of the cap and gown, but June in New York City was hot. Under the cap and gown, Steve made him wear a suit. Peter was sure by the time they made it to the graduation, he’d have become a wet puddle on the ground.
Smiling, Gwen took the folder from him and took out the pictures. “Wow, these are really beautiful.” She gasped as she flipped through them.
“Peter!” She responded and he was certain she was smiling into the receiver. “Gotta save your number into my phone.”
Tony took a sip of his coffee and leaned against the counter. “Military life. That’s what it does to people.” He looked out the window and took another sip from his mug. “Get dressed, I’ll drive you to school.”
Just a trigger warning, there is mention of medication in this chapter. Just in case this is a trigger for anyone...yeah.
“Of course.” Peter answered, returning the smile. “I’ll edit them tonight and print them out for you to see at school tomorrow.”
Steve was shocked to see Peter already walking out the door while he was just waking up. Something was wrong. Something was very wrong. In Steve’s mind, there was no way today was right. It wasn’t going to be an easy swell day. “Peter?!” He called just as the teen was about to close the door behind himself.
Suddenly Peter was looking up at Flash. He must have fallen to the floor from that last hit. Boot made contact with his rib. So much for trying to make it to class with his ribs not hurting. “Trying to make me look like an idiot, huh?!” Flash yelled.
Peter continued to curse himself because he couldn’t peel his eyes off of Gwen’s which means she could definitely see the blush that was playing across his face. He closed his hand in hers and smirked. “Thanks.” He still spoke in a whisper and excused himself to go and get their readied pizzas. Upon returning he placed the pizza’s down and set the bag with the Zeppole to the side. “Careful, it’s hot.” He went back to grab their drinks and then sat back down.
At this Peter looked up at the man who now had his back turned to him. “What?! But I made it in the classroom before the bell rang!” He watched as the teacher, along with the rest of the class turned to look at him.
Bucky nodded his head and paused the game. “Your dad is outside.” He hung up the phone and stood up. The two got the food and Peter’s jacket. “Come by anytime, you little nerd.”
Peter smiled but shook his head, once again forgetting his father couldn't see him. "No pops. I hate being there. Don't worry about it. You both have New Year's Eve off. We'll all be together then. Anyways, I have homework to do. I'll see you tomorrow."
When Peter awoke again his room was dark. There was some shuffling downstairs and he could smell a smoky sauce in the air. Getting up hurt, a lot. He left his room and quickly jumped in the shower. The hot water did little to stop the pain, but it released some of his tense muscles. That was a plus. Getting out, he dried himself and tied the towel around his waist. Heading back into his room, he pulled out a pair of winter pajamas and put them on, noticing as he buttoned his shirt that the bruises on his stomach and chest were just about gone.
“Are you going to be okay?” He asked, now thinking about how far they were from her home. There was no time to drop her off first. Bucky sounded too serious; Peter needed to get home now.
Peter is unsure of anything. If Tony will be okay, why Harry is back, if Steve knows. What will happen if worst comes to worst?
Smiling at him, Gwen picked up her bag and books, also handing Peter his bag. “You’re welcome. Might want to get class before you miss the whole thing.” She spoke kindly and softly.
“Yes sir.” Peter looked down at his almost empty cereal bowl and suddenly didn’t feel that hungry. Once Steve had given Tony a quick kiss and ruffled Peter’s hair, he left and Peter placed his bowl in the sink. “Why is he always so uptight?” Peter asked Tony.
Tony shrugged his shoulders as he looked at Peter. “But he is an idiot.” Unable to help the laugh that escaped him, Peter clamped his hand over his mouth. Steve on the other hand nudged Tony. “Right, sorry. So what, you called him an idiot. And that gave him an excuse to beat the hell out of you?”
Peter took the paper and shoved it in his pocket. “Right, cool.” The bell rang loudly over their heads and Peter realized just then that the hallways were filled with many students now all scrambling to get to class on time. “So, seven. Phone. I’ll call you.”
Peter looked to the scarf, a blush creeping up to his cheeks. “What about you?” He asked, running his fingers gently over the scarf.
He had a mouth full of toothpaste when there was a knock on the door. He gave a small grunt to acknowledge the person on the other side. The door opened as Peter began gargling some water to rinse out his mouth. Turning off the faucet he smiled at the man standing at the doorway. “Morning, sir.” He said, morning grogginess still in his throat. Steve, a captain in the military, did his morning checkup routinely. Peter never knew when his father was going to show up to make sure he was ready for school in a decent amount of time, but the times he didn't Peter always managed to be late for school, so this might be a good thing. “In my defense, the alarm clock never went off.” He lied sheepishly while Steve looked at his watch and crossed his arms.
Now Peter had done a lot of internal therapy to not take anything Flash says seriously. But at this moment with his head pounding, ribs burning, stomach on the verge of sending his morning cereal to his throat, those words hurt. He loved his fathers, and didn’t care if he had friends or not. And in the end, it was he, Peter Rogers-Stark, that would have an outstanding life, not Eugene ‘Flash’ Thompson. Blood seemed to rush back into his head and Peter began to rise to his feet. It wasn’t for long though as Peter received another punch to his stomach and was once more down on the floor.
Smiling, Steve looked to Jarvis and patted his head. “You’re on duty. Guard your post.” He then locked the door and made his way to the car.
Letting the door close, Peter rode the elevator back down and went back into the cold, but felt none of it. He got home way past his curfew but didn’t care. No one was up when he arrived and he locked himself in his room. He knew he wasn’t going to sleep tonight as he turned on his computer and brought up his editing software to fix the pictures. His stomach floated with butterflies when he got to the pictures with Gwen posing. They flew like crazy when he got to the pictures with the two of them. He made a special note to print the pictures she took herself. They really were good shots and he made the lights shine brighter.
The way the question was asked, Bucky sounded a bit concerned. It made Peter a bit unsure of how to answer the question. Was Oscorp not a good place to intern? “Well, it’s more for science whereas pops is all about machinery science. I really don’t want to know how to make weapons for the military. I have enough of that life at home. And I’m not going to let what happened stop me from getting possible scholarships into the programs and field I want to be in.” He sounded more honest than he thought he had been. Whatever worked.
Tony was the owner of Stark Industries. He built weapons even though he was against the idea completely and wished to one day make his company into something more humane, but as he states, it’s money. Steve was a captain in the military and was often at an office filling out paperwork or commanding a training base. Both of them did very amazing things in Peter’s eyes. Sometimes though it’d be nice to have dinner as a family like they used to when he was a kid.
“Good morning.” She replied, taking off her scarf. “It’s cold out here.” Gwen slung her scarf over Peter’s bare neck and tied it.
Tony ignored the question and handed Peter a small wrapped gift box. “Merry Christmas, Peter.” Tony smiled.
Peter knew Steve was listening intently even though he didn’t look up as he shoved another forkful of food into his mouth and reaching for his water bottle just as fast. Motioning his own fork around the plate, Peter shrugged his shoulders. When this got Steve to finally look up from his food, Peter took a deep breath and thought of what to exactly tell his parents. He couldn’t really tell them that this guy usually threatens him into doing his work just enough so he can pass. Or that out on the field or court this same guy often has a knack for tossing a ball Peter’s way when he wasn’t paying attention. Or that this same guy tossed him into a very filthy garbage can just last week.
He knew who Tony was referring to. Looking down, Peter shook his head slightly. He hadn’t thought about him in a long time. In the last year, Peter chose to focus on school and not pay attention to what had happened. “N-no, dad. He’s gone.” His words were just loud enough to be heard.
It was a sure fact that Steve was shocked to see his son up before himself, but he felt proud and delighted and they made breakfast together. Tony had walked down the stairs into the smell of eggs, toast, and bacon. Though he nagged about not smelling coffee, he thanked his family for the meal before heading off to work. Steve had done the same and Peter was last to leave the house. Still, it was a hell of a lot earlier than he was used to. So here he stood now in front of the school to a practically empty parking lot.
Steve chuckles as he digs through the drawers to find some of the cookies he had baked on Wednesday while obsessing about dropping by at Tony’s apartment to give him some. “You should come back to my place to see my paintings,” he says without thinking, before sitting back down at the trolley to finish sterilizing the tattoo equipment. “They’re half creepy and doubly magnificent.”
Right now, though, Tony is floating in a pain-induced haze. He has no mental capacity to worry about the fact that it’s been way more than 40 minutes since the phone call, that CaptainRogers has asked the girl on the other end and a few others to meet him at
“Now you come forward, one, two, and back, one, two, wow amazing, Steve, look at you.” Tony sounds genuinely proud and the admiration in his tone spills like a warm wave into Steve’s chest.
happy to go, not with the sorrow that had filled his eyes as soon as Tony had handed him Barnes’s telegram. It was the lack of joy in every word and every look since that moment and the heartbreaking wistful brush of his lips against Tony’s cheek that were not sitting right with Tony.
The room lights up suddenly and for a split second, it feels like they’ve been standing there for so long that the sun has finally come out. Steve turns to look out the window over his shoulder and turns back, looking confused and distant. He then decides to sit down just as the thunder roars, or gets frightened by the sound, Tony can’t be quite sure, the way he flops and collapses onto the floor. His guts churn at the sight though, and he goes down on his knees as if he’s pulled by an invisible string. He leans in to wrap his arms around Steve before he catches himself and freezes in place in an awkward position.
He didn’t talk much, mostly wrapped up in his constant battle with the demons that seemed to be haunting him restlessly, but would turn into this enthusiastic young spirit, who couldn’t stop talking about the
And now Tony’s lying on the operation table, fighting for his life because Steve is terrible at his job and is fucking terrible in general, and he might never come back and Steve might never get to tell him the truth.
“Is this okay?” Tony asks, pressing at Steve’s hole, and it takes a bit for Steve to catch up with the question. Of course it is, Steve tries, but what comes out is a bunch of overwhelmed meaningless noises, as two fingers circle his hole with the slightest pressure. Steve nods, managing some form of an affirmative apparently, and he clenches around Tony’s fingers many times as they press in, thrusting deeper, and then back out, so slowly, to slide in all over again.
He nods to Bruce. He either needs to have his fingers realigned without any anesthesia or have them realigned… well without anesthesia. It’s not safe to wait anymore and as far as Bruce is concerned, access to a different drug might not be that easy. So he nods, pretending it’s his choice to go through the torture. It’s not like Tony is not familiar with pain anyway; it can’t hurt any more than when they were being dislocated.
The fourth beer comes quite unexpectedly, from a guy Steve had not spotted before. He can usually tell if people are watching him, even if they are not in his line of sight, but he had not seen this guy, not before the bartender puts the beer in front of him. Steve turns to the direction the bartender points to and the guy raises his glass, nods, and wow, smiles.
Tony is breathing softly and his body is pressing against Steve’s, firm and solid. He had stayed, holding Steve through the night, and that calms Steve down a little. He takes a deep breath and then another one. It will be fine. Well, mostly.
“Naked Captain America serving breakfast in bed?” Tony teases as he opens his mouth to take the piece of the fancy blueberry breakfast cake from the fork Steve’s holding out. “If you were wearing an apron I would have wondered if I had died and gone straight to heaven.”
Slipping inside the CCU is a piece of cake for a SHIELD field agent specialized in galactical combat. What proves to be out of Steve’s league, however, is keeping steady and remaining hopeful as he wobbles through the beds and looks at people’s faces one by one. To keep going with trembling knees and blurry eyes, to suppress the voice that gets louder and louder by the second, that yells that Tony might not be here after all. That Tony is—
for SI. It's one of the first things Ty says when he wants to get in  Tony's good books. Even Obie has called him the golden goose when SI share prices skyrocketed after the StarkWatch1 release. But the way this  stranger alpha picks up on Tony's disappointment and knows exactly what to say as damage control is just amazing. A part of Tony's brain is screaming at his stupid need for validation but the rest of him doesn't care. He is suddenly extremely happy and he is not cold or nauseated  any more.
It’s just impossible for it to be real, the way Steve melts under Tony’s touch, trembling with the brush of Tony’s lips, or the way the blush spreads from the tip of his nose to the back of his neck, as soon as Tony pulls the t-shirt over Steve’s head, and the back of his hand brushes over Steve’s nipples along the way. The way he just goes with Tony’s gentle nudge, the blush spreading down on his chest, smiling at Tony soft and pliant as Tony strips out of his clothes. How he holds his hands out and pulls Tony under the stream of the warm water that’s washing all the black stains from Steve’s body.
Steve certainly remembers. Along with every single slide of Dr. Stark’s fingers, in and out, and how stunning it felt although it shouldn’t have, right before the squelch of his fingers pulling out; he remembers that nothing should hurt, that Dr. Stark doesn’t want him to be in pain at all, or something along those lines, so he nods and maybe makes some noises too, but he can’t be quite sure about anything at this stage.
A little too giddy with the idea, Steve doesn’t notice the intrusive alpha scent for the first few seconds. He can just tell something is off, because Tony’s shoulders tense, and his smile fades away as he looks up.
throw good things at us at some point,” he smiles or he tries to, even if what he’s doing feels more like a meaningless expression. “Throwing the precious human being that you are to me? Giving me the honor of watching your cheeks go pink when I run my fingers over your skin, or the amazing things you do just because I gave you a StarkPad and a bunch of kids to order around? Good things do happen to people, Steve, and you deserve all of the good that the universe might ever have.”
Steve starts with his fruit salad, and so does Tony. They eat quietly for a minute or two, staring at each other, as if this, eating breakfast and sharing feelings, is something they do every single day.
Captian Rogers steps forward and shakes Ty’s hand. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you in person, Mr. Stone.”
The minor detail of it being Iron Man and not Tony, doesn’t really matter, does it? The fact that Tony IS Iron Man means something, right? It has to, Tony tells himself wistfully. It has to mean something, that Steve fantasizes about Tony in a suit of armor even if he doesn’t know it’s Tony inside there.
This alpha is not old. He is not small and he is definitely not bald. He actually has a very nice head of hair, blond and, well, beautiful.
Then, the light gets closer, this time not right into his eyes, and Tony can finally see the distinctive figure of the person holding the flashlight. Captain Rogers is still covering his mouth and the horror in his eyes is not comedic anymore.
Tony wishes that there was a definitive way of discussing things that did not require words. Especially now, as Steve has undone Tony’s zipper and is pressing his nose to Tony’s briefs, and the only sounds Tony can manage are meaningless, broken syllables. Stopping Steve is the last thing he wants to do right now, the bottom of the list after dealing with board members and suffering a horrible death. He will kick himself for this, for stopping Steve and possibly talking him out of it, but he just
Things get even more blurry after that. Tony strips out of his clothes except for his briefs and lies next to Steve. His hands and lips are back on Steve’s body as he wraps his feet around Steve’s. The words that he whispers don’t quite register anymore, but they are doing magic to Steve’s nerves because he feels calm and liberated. He doesn’t try to control his hands anymore. He just wraps them around Tony and lets go, of the embarrassment, the cold, the anger, the pain, and the sorrow.
Tony doesn’t love Steve. Hell, he doesn’t even like Steve. They’re just fuckbuddies, for God’s sake and Steve has to stop being so sappy about it.
It’s still raining outside as they make their way to the bedroom and Steve shudders with every touch of Tony’s fingers, as Tony removes his clothes, one by one. Steve’s tears stop as they get to the bed, and his body warms, slowly, as Tony rubs his palms, kisses his fingers, and draws gentle lines on his back. Steve presses his face to Tony’s chest and curls his feet around him. He falls asleep with his lips on the scars where the arc reactor used to be; every breath, a gentle kiss, a prickle to Tony’s heart, a caress to his soul.
Tony argued for half an hour with the head engineer in Gun Emplacement Room 5 and gave two different incorrect directions to two groups of builders before he decided to grant himself a leave of absence. He walked up and down the stairway from the fort to the barracks a few times before he made his way to their residence and he sat on the front deck, unable to bring himself to go inside. Watching the cloudy sky and the angry sea, he remembered the first time he heard Steve’s voice from behind the main quarantine building, on a cloudy dark day just like this one. How he had expected to see a bulky alpha as he heard punches being thrown and ‘I can do this all day’, how he was shocked out of his core when Steve’s small figure appeared from behind the bulky alpha who was being beaten up.
Steve smiles and ignores the way his heart does a happy dance as he watches Tony going through his food. “I was worried you’d have something illegal on you too. I would never have called the police, it was a bluff to begin with.”
Tony looks at his reflection in the mirror. There are absolutely no marks around his eyes, haven’t been at least for the past four  months, but applying the concealer under his eyes has now become a pleasant routine. Something to hold on to; something to control.
I know, I am so sorry, It has been over 3 months since the last update. My energy levels and writing juices came crashing down sometime early-July and I've been struggling to write ( as well as doing most of the other things with my brain :)) )
Tonight, however, Ty does not get to close the loop or complete the cycle or whatever made-up psychological shit terms he loves to use to theorize what he does and part of Tony is thrilled by this minor victory. The other part, however, is too tired to win anything. He just wants to close his eyes, lay his head on Ty’s chest and fall asleep.
Steve takes a deep breath, and slides Tony off his chest, as gently as he possibly can, and despite the lifted weight, it's harder to breathe suddenly. Steve has to get away though. He has to put a distance between them, at least a few feet because he is an inch from waking Tony up and blurting out all the things he can't begin to imagine saying out loud.
Tony’s heart drops at Steve’s sudden Captain America tone and he panics a little. It’s not that Tony doesn’t love the authority that’s radiating off Steve right now, because he absolutely does, so much that it’s tingling the base of his spine. It’s just the contrast with how awkward Steve was a minute ago, giggling and stuttering, and God, what if he thinks that Tony’s being cheeky or is mocking him?
Tony looks up from his phone and blinks at the sight of the guy, fresh out of the shower. His hair’s still damp and his cheeks are flushed from the heat of the shower. Tony can’t decide if he looks more perfect naked, or framed in those unbelievably skinny jeans and a plain white t-shirt that’s almost see-through for being this stretched over those amazing pecs. Tony swallows, thankful for the genius idea of putting his jeans back on a minute ago, because as uncomfortable as it feels with his dick twitching against the rough fabric right now, it would have been way more uncomfortable to deal with the embarrassment of getting hard at the sight of the guy, in front of the guy himself.
This guy, sleeping next to Tony, smiling in his sleep for some reason, whose morning breath smells like a honeycomb, and is in love with Iron Man, just to add to the already impossibly long list of his magnificence.
Steve loosens his grip for Tony to take his hand away and he opens his mouth again to attempt at making words one more time. “No, no, everything is perfect, Commander. I’m glad to finally meet you too,” he manages to get out while punctuating his short breaths between the words. “Any issues around here? You’ve done a fantastic job with your state-of-the-art engines,” he adds and pats himself on the back mentally because Tony’s face opens up into a bright smile that makes Steve’s heart skip a beat and do a flip all at the same time.
Tony doesn’t lift his head from the headrest of the tattoo table. He doesn’t even open his eyes. “I’d have you tattoo it on my forehead if you wouldn’t freak out. I love you. I admire your stupid guts and the fact that you’ve been beaten up in every alley in Brooklyn. I’m sure, Steve. I’m certain.”
The alpha towering over them, on the other hand, is just too much. Steve has seen his kind so many times, the ones who think they’re just precious for being born an alpha, or that having broad shoulders and blond floppy hair makes them superior. He has even ‘designed the tattoo himself’, because he has a minor in visual arts, and can’t shut up about his degrees, his inventions, his black belt, and his parents’ mansion in Malibu, the whole time, as Steve gets his tattoo set ready.
“But you’re … still hard. Just let me, okay?” Tony whispers as his lips brush against Steve’s and he rubs the skin right above Steve’s waistband suggestively.
“So how is it going, folks? No drunken casualties so far?” he yells as they both bring their ears close. “Is everyone here and doing okay?” he adds casually as if he just means ‘everyone’ and not a certain ‘someone’.
Or at least it doesn't look that way, because he’s still in a hospital bed, and in a lot of pain when he wakes up. The room is dim and quiet, except for noises one’s unlikely to hear in the afterlife, beeping of monitors, and soft rhythmic breathing for example that’s coming from someone’s sleeping in a chair next to his bed. It’s Nat, curled under a large jacket with a giant red star on the back that means Bucky’s here too, most probably.
you're telling me that I was staying with the guy who has made the Iron Man armors? Mark I to Mark L? That
Thank you for coming along with this fic so far and please let me know what you think. Comments including emoji reactions are highly and truly appreciated.
But Captain Rogers does not steer the wheel. He still looks furious and smells off but he doesn’t do a U-turn. He doesn’t say a word, doesn’t even look at Tony in the mirror, but he is not driving back to the house. Tony’s heart starts beating,so  fast that his chest almost hurts with it. He has been on this road less than a handful of times and he is not sure if there is a better turning spot just ahead but he can’t see anything. He contemplates asking a fucking question, a smiple
“I have a perfect view of the plug now. I’m going to try and grab it with the forceps. Stay very still for me, Steve.”
“Imagine a box on the floor,” Tony says as he places a hand on Steve’s back, “and its four corners,” and he twines the fingers of the other hand into Steve’s, bringing their joint hands up to chest level. “Think you're holding a frame, by its sides. Keep your back straight, there you go.” He smiles wide as Steve does as Tony says and Steve’s heart flutters and flips.
As a doctor, Steve reminds himself, but it is no use, as his body only cares about the fact that someone’s kneeling before him to look at his dick, not so much about the reason why. A jolt of arousal shoots up Steve’s spine, and he leaks some more into the gown, right where Dr. Stark’s face is right now.
“I am gonna take these off too, if you don’t mind,” Steve explains as he unbuttons Tony’s jeans, “I know it’s not part of the dare but they’re gonna come off with the wheel spinning anyway right? And besides, these questions have to be rigged somehow because, why do you have so much more clothes on while I am completely-” and he removes Tony’s shoes and socks too quickly to be humanly possible “-naked?”
“Oh God, that came out all wrong,” and he throws his head back as he laughs, tightening his hold around Tony, so they are both shaking with the power of Steve’s laughter for a few seconds. “I thought the fact that you picked me up from a bar, and we got caught on camera in a public elevator should have been good hints for you,” Steve says in the most endearing way possible, and Tony’s heart fills with some sort of liquid happiness.
Tony takes a bite of the bread and stabs one of the boiled eggs with his fork. Words can look plain white with a shade of gray, but pull them apart and you will find a dull yellow crumbly ball inside.
The fourth chapter is here, as promised. Thank you to everyone reading this so far. Your nice words make my day and they are truly my fuel to go on writing this daily. I love you all and I hope every one stay safe and happy during this hard time.
“Where will you be staying? Does Barnes have a flat or something in a decent neighborhood?” Tony’s eyes traced the lines of Steve’s body back to his face. The neckline of his shirt was too large, as usual, and the edge of the bite mark showing through was making Tony’s heart squeeze painfully. At least Barnes was not wrapping his arm around Steve’s shoulders like he was minutes ago, as he was helping Jarvis get all of Steve’s belongings into the carriage, thank God, and Tony could finally think clearly, enough to feel it all the way through his bones, that Steve, his perfect, feisty Steve was leaving him for good.
“He is coming?” Steve’s eyes were wide and his cheeks were starting to color. “Two to three days? He is actually coming?”
This is not how Tony had expected Steve to approach ‘doing a scene’. It’s never been like this for Tony with anyone, no matter how experienced they were or how much they presumably were in love. Nothing like Ty, thank God, with everything he did that made Tony promise himself to never even think about a collar.
Steve opens his eyes finally and looks at Dr. Stark, sitting on a stool right between Steve’s spread legs. He is definitely a rare occasion, in every aspect that he can think of and Dr. Stark has picked up on that, but Steve’s brain’s too worked up to figure out the reason.
Tony has been quiet, a little longer than he has planned for. It’s not like he is not interested in the services Homes for Heroes currently provides to veterans to prevent homelessness, because he really is. He has been mentally analyzing a number of SI production lines that could be scaled down and implemented in this upstate facility that will provide on-site job training and employment opportunities for the discharged veterans with no job experience.
He is not depressed and he has not lost his will to live. There is this gigantic piece of rock he’s carrying around, while ironically feeling hollow all the time, but otherwise, he is fine.
Tony leaned his side against the wall, taking a deep breath, and the vague image found the perfect moment to turn wild. It was Tony instead of Steve, kissing Bucky’s neck, touching Bucky’s chest, feeling Bucky’s body pressed to his own
“Spanking - or slapping for that matter - doesn’t have to be about pain,” Tony says as they finally break away and sit back, still facing each other. “I mean it can be, a lot of people get off on pain, but it’s not just that.”
He lies down with his chest pressed to Steve’s back and doesn’t stop drawing small circles on Steve’s back long after Steve falls asleep. He pulls the covers over them, makes sure Steve’s tucked in and warm, and falls into a dreamless, deep sleep.
Nat is holding his other hand out of the blue and Bruce is bringing a water bottle to his lips. “They’re doing everything they can Steve, his heart…” Nat trails off and sniffles and something stabs at Steve’s heart.
Thank you so so so much for reading this fic, and sending so much love my way, I don't really know how to thank you.
Ty takes a step forward and balls his hands into fists. “He doesn’t need to,” he says from between his teeth. “He’d be proud to show off his alpha’s name where it belongs.”
Steve is busy. He’s not hiding away, he’s just too busy to go to Santa Maria rescue celebration. Or the gym. Or team lunches.
He stops swaying and Steve feels a little awkward to stand still with the music still going. He runs his hand in Tony’s hair on one side, and his heart skips a beat as Tony closes his eyes and leans into it. “Unless you’ve been cheating on a partner with me, nothing you’d wanna say could be that big a deal. Me on the other hand--”
Like always we're discussing the COVID-19 pandemic without mentioning the name ( although this chapter has no real reference to it) so if it's something you don't want to be exposed to, please take care of yourself and don't read this on.
? Why has Steve decided to trust Tony in the first place? He can’t play the ‘being drunk’ card, at least with himself.
The second chapter, Day 1, is here, as promised. I am planning to update daily so please help me go with your precious kudos and comments <3
Clint places a gentle kiss on top of Nat’s hair. “Now that we won’t need to dispose of a dead body tonight, I’ll make some cookies to calm the nerves.”
He closes his eyes, with his chin brushing against Tony’s hair, as Tony pulls the covers over them and falls into a dreamless deep sleep.
He might not need to hold water in his hands after all. All he might need to do is take the mask off, show himself, the skinny broken boy from Brooklyn, and hope for the best. It feels right to do it. It feels right to at least try.
Dr. Stark’s eyes go wide, for a fraction of a second, before the corners of his eyes crinkle with concern. “Okay. That's okay, we’ll figure it out.” And he smiles again, his eyes still on Steve, and Steve’s so damn grateful, as he feels so numb and small that he might float and get lost in the sky without them.
Thank you to fiftyshadesofstony, and JehBeeEh for beta, guys you make my work readable and I really really appreciate your help <3<3<3 so many nice things upon youuuu :))
Not quite though. He catches himself right on time, and he has to remind himself that not all things that feel right turn out alright in the end so many times before he can bring himself to let go of the doorknob, step away, and walk out of the room.
Steve blinks and the lights of the living room flicker in his eyes. “I opened my eyes to a beam of light spilling through the curtains into a half-empty room. I didn't even need to look around to know where I was; the room reeked of despair, that deep frustration of being stuck in the same place for so long that you would lose count.”
Tony wants to do it a month after. Steve insists on waiting a year. They settle on their six-month anniversary in the end, and it has to be a late Saturday night, so the appointment ends up being five months, three weeks, and six days after that very first time.
Steve opens his legs slowly and squeezes his eyes shut. “I’m so fucking sorry, I have no idea what got into me, it’s just… too sensitive, I… sorry, I’m so so so sorry.”
But here we are, after (at least) three major rewrites, this is what made the most sense to me, and I am so very much hoping that it would make some sense to you too!
“I’m sure you got it, Captain. I’m gonna set the speed on steady, fingers crossed we don’t jerk too much.” He smiles reassuringly and the noise in Steve’s brain quiets down instantly. “Ready?” Tony asks.
Invisibility seems to be the most awesome superpower a person could have. It makes a strange kind of sense, Steve thinks, because invisible people do not end up in the Emergency Department on the 4th of July for being so stupidly strong, and they certainly don’t produce so much pre-come that would be enough to make a small puddle. And even if they did, they wouldn’t turn cherry red during a medical examination, just like Steve must be now, with the way his skin is burning all over.
Making an inhuman effort, Steve manages to pull Tony up and hold him against his chest, before sitting back down on the bench. He keeps Tony’s gaze, petting soothing circles on his back, and breathes through the flood of satisfaction that seeps into Tony’s scent and washes over Steve’s body as his knot inflates, making Tony come again, pulsing around Steve. It’s almost heaven, until Tony cards his fingers through Steve’s hair and kisses the side of his face; then it’s heaven. It’s complete.
Tony stands up, takes a step forward, and brushes a strand of hair off Steve’s forehead. “Saturday is perfect.”
Even with the heavy blanket covering him that wasn’t there before, he doesn’t feel like he’s sitting on fire anymore. He’s lying on his side, with his feet curled into his stomach and not up on stirrups. He is not aching, he is not hard, and except for the small holes that shame has probably burnt into his skin, he is not uncomfortable, not even the smallest bit.
Steve looks around the room and swallows. “This is not about training or capability…” He ducks his head and shuffles on his feet, wishing so bad for his rational, civilized brain to take over at a very near point in the future.
Ty’s deep alpha voice is supposed to be enough. In a simpler life, Tony would roll over and show his belly on hearing only one of the sweet pet names Ty is throwing at him right now. It’s not a simpler life though. His fucking stupid hormonal omega brain hard coding is too incompetent to handle the situation.
Tony reaches over his desk to grab his coffee and donuts before sitting back. “I’d love to,” he says and takes a bite, his lips pressing down into the donut and coming back all sugary, making Steve want to pull out from behind his desk and lick the sugar off his lips.
, he repeats to himself hazily, but the idea does not bring a rush of anxious thoughts as it had before. He
This is the third T-shirt he’s tried on and for some reason, all of his clothes look unflattering this afternoon. He has not been this nervous about how he looks for many many years and even then he never had to pick an outfit, as he would always wear his uniform anyway.
“Right,” Tony says and rubs his chest. “Right,” he repeats as he starts to walk away and turns back a few times as he goes down the stairs, mouthing the word over and over again. Downstairs, Tony stands in the middle of the crowd for a few minutes, as if he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do, the image being what finally brings some sensation back to Steve’s limbs as the blood flows back up to his head so he can finally start to move slowly at first and then run down the stairs to get to Tony.
“Okay. It’s okay Steve, thank you for telling me.” He places a reassuring hand on Steve’s shoulder, and it’s stupid and he’s probably thinking with his ridiculously hard dick, but all Steve wants to do right now is lay his head against Dr. Stark’s bare forearm.
and there is a calming ring to her words. “Please do. I am starving. I need cookies.” Clint kisses her hair again and then looks at Tony and his eyes smile. “We could all use some cookies. What is your favorite Tony?”
on the bed next to Bucky, pressing him to the wall with his side. Bucky was struggling to push Steve back and Steve was not moving, and they were so worked up pushing and laughing that it took them a minute to notice Tony at all.
Steve takes a deep breath and puts the design sheet on the tattoo trolley. He takes his latex gloves off, one by one, and repeats to himself that punching clients is not a good idea. Not only because he needs this job, but also because he’s a human being, and one must use his words before his fists in all situations.
Steve opens his mouth to say something back but it’s harder to get focused when Tony’s remarks are this perfect. The vein pulsing so beautifully in Tony’s neck and the urge to bite doesn’t help either and Steve closes his mouth to gather his thoughts as the door swings open and Nat walks in.
He’s learned to do other things by watching YouTube videos before and some have been successful on the first attempt, like that ‘high release backhand’ frisbee throw that had knocked Batroc out on the field. This probably won’t work that well, and it’s a small thing to do anyway, but it’s what he can do, or at least try to do here and now, and he is not going to not try, for fear of messing up.
The nurse at medical checks his pulse, takes his temperature, and browses through Steve’s medical records. “I’m not too worried about an asthma attack. Or heart arrhythmia. Have you been experiencing any stomach pain?”
For a long second everything goes quiet. Even Nat loosens her grip around Steve’s arm, although Steve can’t quite remember when she got her hand there, and no one even breathes. Tony smirks and takes a step back, which to an unassuming audience - people who don’t know Tony Stark well enough - he might seem to be backing down, but Steve knows him better, too well maybe, to believe that even for one second.
Tony scratches his beard as he squints at the screen as well. “Does it have it to be someone new, or could it be someone I’ve already banged?”
Tony’s cheeks start to heat up as he reads the dare challenge on TV, and his mouth goes a little dry, as Steve stops fidgeting and stands up. “Up,” he orders, and Tony stands up without missing a beat, confused for a second because Steve sounds like he did last night, as he was playing Captain America. The idea of Steve mixes with Captain America again, in the most delicious way, as he sweeps Tony off and presses him to the wall adjacent to the couch. Tony’s feet wrap around Steve’s waist instinctively and his head spins a little as Steve kisses him, so passionately his lips hurt.
Steve keeps his eyes on the alpha, who looks taller and larger now. He watches him as he opens his mouth to say something, then closes it as he throws his hands in the air. He then groans, turns away from Steve, and starts tugging on Tony’s hand. “I’ll make sure you pay for this,” he mumbles and Steve can’t quite tell who’s on the receiving end of the threat. “Up, up, let’s get the fuck outta here, now!”
Tony thinks about what Steve just said for a moment. He smiles and pulls Steve in to rest his forehead on his again so he can stare into his eyes, not caring much about what it means to stare into a guy’s eyes like that and he echoes Steve’s words to himself a few more times, just to be sure, that he has, in fact, said it out loud that he ‘admires’ Tony.
I left Melbourne— I’m sorry. I wrote home with my new address as soon as I got my own place in Sydney, but it was obviously too late.” Bucky wrapped an arm around Steve’s shoulders and Steve laid his head on Bucky’s chest. He smelled like home, like the slow comfortable afternoons of their childhood. He smelled like a time when life was simpler and no one died from the flu, the days that civil wars were not leaving houses in ruins, and no one had to flee their hometowns to put food on the table and find a shelter from the rain.
Steve takes Thor to bed after the 15th beer and sits with Natasha in silence for as long as it takes her to fall asleep, everything already quiet when he steps out of her room. Everyone’s asleep. All of the doors are closed.
It’s not even odd, that Steve was having a painfully out of reach dream about dancing with Tony, a couple of days ago. It’s magical but not surprising that Tony does exactly as Steve needs, even when he has no idea about it. The same way he knows how to touch Steve, exactly the right way, to make him rise and fall at the same time. How he knows what to say to make Steve’s mind stop reeling and start moving forward, how he knows what to do exactly to steady Steve and help him go, like taking off the mask Steve had been wearing for so long without even knowing it existed.
The city is waking up slowly and the lights of dark windows are flickering on. Steve closes his eyes, to keep the tears in, and imagines Tony’s hands in his hair. He imagines hiding his face in Tony’s chest, trailing his lips along the amazing artwork of scars, that Steve is dying to ask why, and talking, maybe crying while no one can see. Tony’s soft words, and his endless string of kisses, the way he holds Steve tight and takes his breath away with a single touch; the way he fits, he’s right, he is the one.
Steve is the most boy scout kind of guy Tony has ever met. Not that he usually comes across a lot of those people, because his circles are fucked, but Steve has this raw, genuine, greater good aspect to him that he doesn’t even try to hide. It’s like a breath of fresh air, the way he believes in making a change, the way he operates almost all the time, and it’s beyond astonishing how his ways actually work, as naive and unworldly as they look, how he has done more in the past three days, than the president's administration in the past three months.
For about two seconds exactly until Dr. Stark’s gloved slick finger touches the rim of his hole and pushes in very gently. That’s the moment he loses it completely.
Tony doesn’t care that they have been sharing a bed for almost a week. That they’ve kissed and talked and ate and slept together over and over and over again. This guy, who makes Steve his mom’s pasta and yells at the chief of staff to the president of the United States, who gives so much he forgets he deserves to receive things too, who is gentle and kind and always has a second to kiss Steve’s nose in between his crazy hectic days; he doesn’t care if Steve is half-naked and fully hard, if Steve is panting and shaking in his arms. He doesn’t assume, doesn’t take silence for consent, he doesn’t even accept nodding and gestures. He needs words, actual solid words to take the next step and he will ask every single time, and Steve loves that about him.
Was this all Tony’s imagination, though? The way Steve went pale before blushing all over and loosening his grip on Bucky’s shoulders? Bucky jumped, literally, off the bed as soon as he saw Tony at the door and shoved his hands into his pocket. The air in the room stilled for a second before Steve turned and smiled at Tony.
“You’re here? God, I panicked for a second, I thought--” and he cuts himself off, rubs his face and his hands start to fiddle with his t-shirt, straightening wrinkles that seem to be invisible.
There is a trading card in the box, an unpackaged blue … butt plug, and a note, that Steve opens with shaky hands, and has to read a few times before he begins to comprehend the words.
Tony brings his other hand over to cover Steve’s and the sight of post-surgery needle bruises on the back makes it hard for Steve to hold his tears back. “That’s too much death talk for the occasion, Rogers,” Tony says in between scattered coughs and Steve starts to laugh because of course Tony is the funniest person in the room in every situation.
Tony takes a deep breath in and nods, his eyes a little hurt, still. Steve watches him leave and his heart clenches with the pain of failure.
I fell for him from that first punch, Tony thought with a pang of pain in his heart. From the first words, the first look, the first time he turned down my offer to help him to his feet. The fat lip and the burning gaze, the balled fists that were ready to punch anyone who would get in his way.
Tony cries, sobs, as Steve’s mouth moves up and down his cock, soft and tight, and Tony is not sure if he orders or begs but Steve doesn’t hesitate to touch himself, as soon as the words are spoken. They come together, at the exact same second, and it’s not bizarre even the slightest bit. It’s just magic; unearthly, not explainable, pure, like every other thing that happened in the past 10 days, that led them here, right to this moment.
He does finally come apart. With Tony’s finger sliding out and pressing in gently a couple more times, and his hand sliding over Steve’s cock in perfectly timed strokes, between Tony’s kisses and the words that make no sense but feel like kisses to Steve’s soul, when Tony’s finger enters Steve one last time,  a flash of lightning burns Steve’s core and he falls from the edge into the land of mystery in blazing trails of magical fireworks.
His back hurts. His nose hurts. His hands and his head hurt too. He is also light-headed and he has probably started shaking at one point because Captain Rogers stops  the car to cover him with a blanket he pulled out of nowhere. It might be a precautionary measure, Tony thinks, to keep a light travel blanket handy in your car in case you rescue a random shaking omega from your trunk. The car has taken a few tries to turn back on and it’s running with a suspicious sound that Tony would have brought up if he has the energy to, or if he had been on talking grounds with Captain Rogers.
“He is releasing the stimulus package, huh? I guess…congratulations?” Steve kisses Tony’s forehead. The delight of the unexpected win, blends with Steve’s passionate embrace and Tony’s heart starts to race in response.
The image goes straight to Tony’s cock, and suddenly, instead of finalizing the list of the essential items he needs from home, all he can think about is Steve. The way he gasps and closes his eyes, the way he had been lost in Tony’s touch and the way he came apart under Tony’s hands.
We are discussing COVID-19 pandemic, as usual, without mentioning the name, so if you don't want to be exposed to that topic, please take care of yourself and don't read this one.
Tony’s lips brush against the side of Steve’s face and the tears stop running down. He kisses the line of Steve’s jaw and Steve’s shoulders stop shaking. His lips find Steve’s and the choked sobs disappear. Steve tastes Tony’s mouth as Tony parts his lips. It’s sweet and so painfully familiar. Steve’s suddenly dizzy with the flood of sensations washing over his skin, a knot coming undone, deep in Steve’s core, that he had kept so tightly tied.
Ty draws his hand out and his fingers touch Tony’s chin. His touch is cutting and cold but for a fraction of a second, part of Tony’s omega brain craves to be buried in the familiarity of Ty’s scent. He leans in toward Ty, because the world might stop spinning if he rests his head on Ty’s chest. But right before his cheek reaches the smooth fabric of Ty’s Jacket, Tony feels a sharp stabbing pain deep inside his belly. Something invisible grabs at him and pulls him back inch by inch. He is still light-headed and shaky but he is not uncertain anymore.
“But I’m paying for it anyway, Steve. You’re basically doubling up if that’s what you're worried about.”
It was like trying to navigate a sand storm at first, with the chaos that had been their lives for a few months after Steve had told Tony that Bucky was alive since he’d brought Bucky back home, but now with all the dust settled and the air clear between them, Tony could clearly see why Steve was willing to put his life on the line for Bucky.
Tony watched Steve’s footsteps marking the sand as he walked away, not turning to look back even once. With what Steve had been through since he had set foot on Australian soil, Tony couldn’t blame him for wanting to prepare for his departure without delay. As if losing his mother on the ship and arriving among hundreds of flu patients was not enough pain, he had to go through the trouble with the immigration authorities who found his travel documents invalid as an unbonded omega with no guardians and were about to send him right back to Ireland. Tony could not blame him the slightest bit, but watching him walking toward the quarantine buildings so quickly felt like being stabbed in the chest.
We are still discussing the pandemic of the COVID-19 (although I have not mentioned the name so far) so please take care of yourself and don't read this fic if you don't want to be exposed to it.
This is all Natasha’s fault, well at least partly, because she found it funny to pack all of Steve’s plain white t-shirts for these two weeks, to get her point across maybe, that Steve does actually need some help in that area. Steve takes off the T-shirt he’s wearing to put on another one, which looks exactly the same, and pouts with frustration before he kicks himself mentally. This is not a date, he reminds himself for the five hundredth time, even if Tony has declined Steve’s offer to help cook or set the table and has said that he will
He walks backward, until he hits a cold hard wall before he finally finds the door to throw himself out. He runs through the corridors, takes three wrong turns, and ends up by the swimming pool at some point, so tempted to just jump in with his uniform on.
“May I?” Tony asks, soft and gentle and Steve has to bite down a sob before he can get a hang of himself long enough to tilt his head in what should hopefully form an unsteady nod. “Tell me, Steve, with words please. May I touch you like this?”
Tony’s body went numb. He couldn’t feel his feet as he ran out of the door so he missed a step and twisted an ankle but he couldn’t tell if it hurt or not. Steve was
“Only a little,” he sends back too quickly. “Now show me the photo,” he adds, in about a minute or so, and stops counting the days, hours, and minutes between his calls after that.
Omegas in Tony’s situation can die, like Nebula herself, and have their names slapped onto an act in return, that’s practically unable to change anything, anyway.
“Now I’m going to insert the retractor. Remember, you have to let me know if it hurts at all, right?”
Steve throws punches at an imaginary sandbag and uses the doorstop to do some chest presses. It doesn’t work as well as his usual five-mile runs and two-hour workout in the gym, but it’s something, and something is better than nothing. He takes another shower, eats, takes a nap and wakes up to the sound of Tony yelling, again, about how saving 2000 jobs in the middle of a crisis will not force SI to go bankrupt.
He also thinks about babies. Many of them actually. He somehow feels he is trapped in a cute nursery, or a haunted house, and there is a baby at each and every corner. He can hear them cry and coo and giggle. He can even almost smell them and that is absolutely ridiculous.
Tony swallows another half-egg and shoves some tomato on top. He knows for a fact that no such act existed in any state when he still had access to free internet, and other than the rare common practices in Vermont and Massachusetts, no courts had processes in place to grant temporary relief of bond duties for omegas urgently. Will he get sick if he takes one sip of the hot chocolate? The idea of warm milk makes his insides twist, but it’s not an easy decision to pick between disappointing an alpha who’s gone into trouble of making hot chocolate in a pot just for Tony - the grownups are having coffee, of course - or keep what’s in his stomach right where it is. He stares at Captain Rogers’s long fingers unwrapping another granola bar and dipping it into his coffee mug, and does his absolute best not to come up with too many vivid images of the events that must have happened to Nebula over the past year, so fucking horrifying to have made alpha-dominated bodies of legislators even consider passing a bill named after an omega. Photos of graphic injuries perhaps, he thinks anyway, or recordings of a terrified voice in multiple 911 calls, her friends’ testimonies - if she had any friends left - or stories by her devastated family believing her finally when it was too late to do anything at all. Captain Rogers’s Adam’s apple bobs up and down and Tony wraps his fingers around his mug. He can’t think about this anymore - he just can’t go lower in this hole - so he might as well drink some hot chocolate for the first time in ten years, and focus on keeping it down instead of heart wrenching speculations about this other omega’s pain and despair.
He points to his strained neck, and watches Tony as he tilts his head to brush his lips against that spot. It’s chaste and gentle and it burns from the point of contact right down to Steve’s heart. He then trails up Steve’s throat, to kiss the spot Steve has pointed to on his chin, then his cheek, then his nose, all the way to his painful, possibly-bloody temple.
Tony looks up at him, eyes glassy, cheeks flushed. “What’s happening to me?” Tony asks, voice low, words breaking on the edges. “I’m burning up, like I have a fever, but why would I have a fever?” He trails off with his mouth slightly open, as if he’s searching for words he doesn’t find.
what Steve’s doing to him, without saying a word. He tightens his hold on the edge of the desk and does his best to stay still as if he is holding something fragile in his hand that could break with the tiniest of trembles or be disrupted by the lowest whispers.
Tony has touched bodies before, too many to count maybe, but there is something wonderful about touching Steve. The idea of running his hands over Steve’s wet skin burns a line of fire through Tony’s spine, and a giddy sort of sensation fills his heart when his hands reach each other on Steve’s back. It feels like the first time Tony thinks, pressing Steve to himself and his cock twitches and leaks as he feels Steve’s erection against his. Steve hums softly into Tony’s hair, his flush getting darker under the hot water and the way he feels in Tony’s arms, warm, solid and trembling slightly is like nothing Tony has ever felt before.
“I’ll get him something to change into for tonight. We can get anything he needs tomorrow.” Captain Rogers’ voice is low and deep. Tony is tired, dizzy and extremely hormonal so he can blame the way his eyes dart around the room to follow Captain Rogers stepping out on his stupid omega brain. The way Captain Rogers is blushing right before he turns to get out of the door though, can’t really be Tony’s brain shenanigans. It’s not even that uncommon anyway, alphas loving to mark omegas as their property despite the circumstances, it’s just the fact that he did not even get a say in it, because everyone is pretending that he does not exist, or worse, is incapable of making a stupid fucking decision.
Steve is blushing all over. He is smiling and casual, on the outside at least, but Tony can see the red that’s already spread down the neck of his t-shirt and the narrow strip of skin between the hem and the waistband as he flops on the couch next to Tony.
with his bread and butter, and ignores the fact that he actually knows why his throat is suddenly so parched.
Steve’s still smiling while Tony turns around to leave. It takes him a moment longer, his usual 'in Tony’s presence fogginess' slowly dissipating, before he catches up. Did Tony say that
“Did you hear me asking for your suggestion?” the alpha cuts in. “I don’t want you to suggest shit here, just do what you’ve been paid to do.”
It takes forever to get to Brooklyn; or at least much longer than Tony has expected. The back seat is way more comfortable than the trunk, and that’s a comparison no one should ever make, but Tony is still in as much pain and even more.
What if Tony manages to prove himself wrong by just being too much like always? What if Steve finds out finally, like all of the other ones, that Tony is not good enough for the scene and not worth Steve’s time? What if he figures out that Tony’s just not good enough in general, despite all of his efforts, and stops loving him?
He turned away from Jarvis and walked to where he’d stand every afternoon waiting for Steve to show up from the bend of the road. No one would be coming home
He wishes he could at least cover his face with one of his hands or slide a bit lower and hide under the light blue blanket that is still covering him under the white woolen throw, but then the thing, the force, the being tugs the inside of his lower belly and a wave of certainty runs up his chest and washes over his heart.
He reaches for Ty’s hand on his arm and pushes it away, then presses his fingers on the burning spots. His hands are too small and running them across his arms can’t really put out the fire burning his whole body right now.
“Steve’s been rotating as a volunteer through different jobs across the quarantine facility since he was released from mandatory quarantine. He was free to spend his days drawing the breathtaking surroundings, but of course, he’s preferred to read to sick, quarantined immigrants. Or to breathe in the disinfectant for hours at a time, which does no good for his lungs, but he has to help no matter what, because ‘
Gentle strokes clean him up, and soft warmth envelopes his body as Tony pulls the covers over them. “How are you feeling?”
Steve cries and shudders as Tony pushes his third finger in and loses track of every single thought left in him. There is only Tony, and the thrumming sensation ripping through Steve’s chest as he moves his fingers and opens them wide, the stretch, the burn, the impossible flow of senses wrapping around Steve and breaking him apart.
Steve asks about Tony’s shouting match with the White House earlier and Tony’s face goes hard for a second. The president has denied the financial relief package proposed by a symposium of his largest donors including Stark Industries although he was scheduled to sign and announce it that afternoon. Steve can’t believe that Tony would donate to this president's campaign, and Tony explains that it’s not up to him, that it’s been a company policy forever to donate the same amount of money to both presidential candidates so they have an equal amount of support, whichever gets elected to the office.
“My presence is vital for saving these civilians, and there is no real difference between the danger I’ll be exposed to compared to you.”
He tries to think, to come up with a new plan, but his brain cells are busy panicking. He can’t see anything. He can’t really move and his right hand is unlikely to be able to maneuver any buttons and levers right now or anytime soon. He tries to shift a little but his back is apparently spasmed. It’s not even ironic that he can absolutely do nothing at this moment. He just waits. Waits and hopes for the best.
Steve laughs, throwing his head back a little and Tony twitches his fingers in his pockets, using up a lot of his usually low supplies of self-control to not reach over and wrap his arms around Steve.
Dr. Stark’s eyes go unbelievably wide, and he opens his mouth to say something, probably, or to try and breathe as Steve just sucked in all the air in the room, or maybe because the plug, the doom of Steve’s being, decides to shift a bit again, sending fireworks all the way up to Steve’s neck, making him dizzy, forcing a low moan out of his lips. “Was it a particularly old plug? Like from the 40s? Or left in corrosive solvents for too long? Because—”
Well, almost perfect, because Steve starts to lick Tony’s length just then, and Tony can’t get a hold of himself anymore. He presses his fingers into the desk and closes his eyes, opening them in the hypothetical paradise of pleasure where there is nothing, except for stars and flowers and Steve. Steve, who is sucking Tony’s cock, somehow kissing his soul in the process too, and there,
Which means no surprises, so their plan will hopefully work. The black hole extends to eternity before their eyes, half of their view just pitch black with the event horizon horrifyingly near. They're at the edge of danger, literally, but for now, the pull towards it stays minimal.
It’s after midnight when Steve finally opens the door to his old office. He imagines Tony, sitting in this chair, leaning his head against the window, tapping on his StarkPad, mumbling to FRIDAY from time to time. The moon reflecting on the silver in his hair. The dim light of the screen dancing in his eyes. Like a couple of years ago when life was simple. Like the time Steve remembered what happiness was.
Tony can technically drive back to Manhattan if he hires a car but being on the road for 21 hours does not really sound like adhering to the self-isolation guidelines. Getting on a plane, even his own jet, is not an option either and less conventional ways of travel may raise some unwanted suspicion. He will have to stay here for the next 14 days, and as Pepper has just mentioned, half friendly and half annoyed, it’s not the worst place one could find themselves stuck.
He takes a deep breath, puts his t-shirt on, and gets back to his list. He has to wait a bit before putting his jeans back on though; no way he can fit his cock behind any type of zipper right now.
Ty turns his head, gently, and smiles. He looks calm and measured but Tony can smell his distress. Ty is caught off guard. He does not have a plan and he is shit at thinking on the spot. “Tony, this is not what you’re thinking, doll.”
“I’m sure they are.” Tony closes the album. “People put a part of their soul in their art,” he says, and smiles with his whole face as he breaks the cookie in half.
, Tony thought, relieved as he took off his StarkWatch to throw it over the pile of his stuff on the coach. Walking through the living room, he unbuttoned his dress shirt and stopped just before opening the bedroom door; there was someone else in the room with Steve.
Captain Rogers does not look gentle though. He does not look calm or compassionate and the smile he was wearing  all night is gone. Clouds have mostly covered the moon and the car is dimly lit by the the car lamp, but Tony can’t be making this up. He can even smell the way his alpha scent has shifted from the gentle black tea to  a sharp woodsy thing. Well, Tony can never tell the scents apart properly because he has been
“Still can’t believe, well, any of this,” Tony says, and he groans as he sits on the stool by the kitchen counter. “Is there anything comfortable in this whole place? The couch broke my back.”
Steve looks up and it feels like someone has knocked the breath out of his lungs. He opens and closes his mouth and tries to say something but no sound seems to come out. He nods, after many attempts at finding words and failing miserably, and the guy sits down on the stool next to him, not even two inches away.
Tony laughs, and something flutters in Steve’s heart. “Captain America was literally the peak of human perfection. He freed 400 prisoners that the army had given up on with his bare hands and drew an exact map of all the other HYDRA bases by looking at the original map
Dr. Stark stands up and takes off the gloves to toss them in the bin. “How long has this been going on?” he says, as he washes his hands, and it’s a small blessing that he is facing away from Steve, so he can pretend to be invisible for a second.
He doesn’t cease to exist, at least for another few minutes, as Tony slides his finger inside further and further and further and all that Steve can feel, is just that, the way he is opening up to let Tony in, no control, no thoughts, just the sensation; intense, incredible, extraordinary.
“And now,” Steve sighs, and shakes his head slowly as if it hurts to move faster, “now, you’re telling me that you-” he turns to point to the TV, and back to Tony “-
“Truth,” Steve says determinedly and leans forward, elbows on his knees. Tony looks at him for a second, the way he is still blushing on every inch of exposed skin, even his toes, and how Tony can see the line he has just teased on Steve’s chest because there is a darker shade going from his neck to his waistline right where Tony’s tongue's been a minute ago. He is worried about the next question, and Tony wants to hug him from behind and kiss the tension off the back of his shoulders.
“Look at my abundance of happiness and joy. He is exactly what I want. Everything I ever wanted.” Ty reaches for Tony’s hand on the table and kisses it. Tony’s heart is actually racing now; every word making his heart beat a little faster.
“I sure can. I’ll just have to mention 'Four Seasons' at my press conference tomorrow. If they throw in more money, I might even say I’m generally happy with their service. It works in all cases.”
“You seem to have a fever,” Tony says and his palm touches Steve’s forehead. “You should definitely go to medical, you might have picked up some virus from Earth that you don’t want to spread around.”
Steve wraps his free arm around Tony’s waist, presses his nose to Tony’s neck, and kisses the line of his jaw. “What I think is that you’re brilliant, and charming, and so damn sexy, and I must have done something good in my life for the universe to bring you to me like this.”
Steve’s face stiffens for a second, and Tony gives himself a mental kick. “Ah, I don’t know? I mean I get beaten up quite frequently and there is nothing sexy about broken shoulders and black eyes.”
“You suggested we play a game, sweetheart.” Tony winks at Steve, as he brushes a finger over Steve’s bottom lip, and he can’t tell which is more of a turn-on; the way Steve closes his eyes from the touch, or that his tongue touches the tip of Tony’s finger. “I just need a brain break, Steve, help a friend out here,” he rasps, not as playful as he planned to.
He rubs the shampoo onto Steve's hair, the one that smells like lavender because Steve smells like that one all the time. He is shy and careful at first, worried that he might make Steve uncomfortable, but Steve doesn’t seem to mind, because he smiles and tilts his head a little to give Tony better access. Tony presses his forehead to Steve’s, now that he can reach it, and giggles between the small kisses he plants on Steve’s nose when the shampoo runs into his eyes as he rinses Steve’s hair.
“I did it because your stupid ass was in the parking lot trying to light yourself on fire. If you hadn’t gone after that freak with a flamethrower, who was actually already half-unconscious anyway we wouldn’t be having our collective asses roasted right now!”
“It was… brand new. Top quality, and expensive,” Steve says, gritting his teeth. “I might look like the most stupid person in the world right now, Dr. Stark, but I certainly am not
Tony hates love songs. He hates the fact that they are full of hope and stupid surreal promises. He hates the way they make you feel warm and fuzzy all over and he hates the fact that they are cold outright lies.
Just like that, the president disappears from the screen as he is not taking any questions, and Tony stares at Bret Baier moving his lips without really hearing his voice. He then turns to Steve, doing his best to keep his mouth from hanging open and spends the next few seconds staring at Steve as he scrolls through the channels, trying to figure out what on earth just happened and why, until Steve plays some 30s playlist on YouTube and finally turns to Tony. He doesn’t look surprised though, Tony thinks, but he seems happy and he is slightly blushing but Tony doesn’t get a chance to wonder why. Steve is looking at him with a sparkle in his eyes and he is smiling with his whole face as he wraps his hands around Tony’s to pull him close, and the next thing Tony knows, he is, well, sitting on Steve’s lap. Casually.
“I was just about to— you can’t do that Steve, not again, God, it’s not like you’re my alpha, so you can’t really play the jealousy card here.” Tony finally lets go of Steve’s arm to run both of his hands through his hair. Steve’s hand lingers in the air for a second though, Tony’s words ringing in his ears and making something pound in his head.
“So if you do love Italian food, how about I make some for you?” Tony says, doing his best not to get overwhelmed by the way Steve suddenly seems absolutely startled, “You know, as a thank you, for making sure I don’t die from hunger,” and he searches Steve’s face as if knowing how he feels about what Tony had said would give him a chance to change it in any way, “I’ll get J to organize delivery, and I’ll let you do the dishes.”
It made no sense, but it felt right at the same time. Wanting Bucky was just a part of wanting Steve.
The guest is probably a small old bald alpha, like the other ones who come to beg for some SI money for their stupid-agenda charities, who have long sticks up their asses and think they're too precious to look at the omegas in the room, let alone talk to them. Tony hates those alphas the most, even more than the ones with filthy looks, as much as it hurts to see the pleasure in their eyes as they undress him in their crap-filled brain. They at least acknowledge his existence, which in the most horrible way is better than being fully ignored and considered non-existent.
When he resurfaced from his own drooling fantasies again, Steve was still standing there, head cocked, blinking innocently.
He chokes mid-swallow at the photo accompanying that last one; Steve, standing behind him – tall, blond, handsome, smiling from beneath his lashes as he pulls out Tony’s chair for him with a flourish. Tony, faintly flushed and lips curved up in what is more a goofy grin than the smooth smirk he’d been going for.
“I love you,” he breathes as he raises the ceramic to his lips. Steve gives a little twitch, but by the time Tony has opened his eyes again – it’s a long moment, not savoring the first sip is a crime against humanity, even when it’s so hot he can’t even taste it – he’s schooled his features again into that disarmingly soft smile, small and pink and utterly kissable. Tony bites his own lip just thinking about it.
“No, unfortunately, that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” Tony mumbles into the fabric of Steve’s shirt. He can’t help himself; he wraps his arms around Steve’s waist and huddles closer to him, breathing in the scent of his laundry detergent and sighing. Might as well soak as much of this in as he can while he still can, right? “Pepper’s handling it, but I… don’t think I can sue them all.”
Tony mentally tells his knees and his dignity to brace themselves for the amount of groveling he’s going to have to do today. Sometimes he really misses when Pepper was just his PA,
Blinking furiously, and groping the counter blindly for his mug with his free hand, Tony dares to scroll down his news feed. In some dim corner of his mind he realizes that he should probably ask JARVIS to keep Steve distracted until he gets this sorted –
“I bet you that every single person in that office has at least one piece of Stark Tech in their home,” Tony says, crossing his arms over his chest in something uncomfortably reminiscent of a pout. “And this is the thanks I get! I make everyone’s lives so much more convenient and they turn around and slander my boyfriend, call us a bunch of sluts –”
Any stupid, half-hearted hopes that Tony had harbored that Steve, of all people, might be immune to the kind of scrutiny that Tony Stark is drenched in is flushed down the toilet. This, he registers dimly, is not even close to the worst of it. This is tame.
In a bizarre twist of fate, Pepper finds the whole thing hilarious. Tony is torn between feeling pathetically grateful that she’s not mad and wanting to shake her until she understands that this is the end of the world.
“I still think that we should just hold a press conference,” Steve is saying in the present, nuzzling under Tony’s jaw. He’s so huge, a massive wall of muscle pressed up behind him; Tony is starting to feel a little dizzy and he’s pretty sure that it’s not just because Steve is slowly suffocating him. “Confirm the rumors, take away their power. They can’t speculate on anything if we tell them everything.”
A hand shoots out to catch it before it can crack against the wall; Tony clenches his fists and twists violently away to no avail. Steve catches him around the waist and pulls him in in a move that’s quickly become familiar, equally infuriating as it is terribly nice, in a way that strips Tony emotionally bare in milliseconds and leaves him feeling fidgety and vulnerable, quiet because he doesn’t know exactly what will come out of his mouth if he opens it. He wants to struggle or to protest but he knows from experience that Steve will just wait it out, patiently petting his arms and his face and his hair until he stops ranting and starts nuzzling back into the touches like he obviously wanted to from the get go.
“At least consider it,” Steve pleads, except he says it with certainty – like he knows that Tony will, and asking is just a formality. Wow. Tony wants to get his hackles up over that (prove him wrong! Some incredibly stupid part of him screams) but it’s really, really hard to say no to Steve Rogers. Especially when he’s so goddamned earnest about it, fuck, is that really necessary? “We can do it together. I can take your hand in front of the whole world.”
“That doesn’t bother me,” Steve says confidently, tugging him back in and flattening his palm against Tony’s back, rubbing it in slow, firm circles. The tension has drained back out of him and his lips are incredibly soft where they press to Tony’s forehead, following his hairline. He doesn’t even complain about the taste of the half-gallon of product Tony’s got in his hair to keep it coiffed and perfectly in place. “But if it bothers you, we can make a statement.”
“Listen to Steve and Pepper,” she advises, cocking her head and examining his face in a completely unnerving manner. Thor has plucked the pages out of Bruce’s hands and is squinting at them, completely transfixed and apparently utterly disinterested in Steve and Tony’s love life; Bruce has been murmuring the answers to his questions for the past five minutes while the rest of them bickered. Clint is still on the floor, and Natasha is nearly done painting the nails on her left foot. She’s not even looking at what she’s doing and it’s flawless, which is… oddly intimidating. “It’s not like everyone in the world didn’t see this coming.”
Steve is sitting a foot away from the thing, not even looking at it, which should have tipped him off. Alas, Tony is not awake enough to read a room, much less Steve’s morning stoicism. His coffee cup is dangling from his pinky finger now, utterly forgotten. He blinks once, groggily. Squints his eyes and wills the letters to come into focus.
Tony’s reputation has been limping along for a long time. Visibly scarred, just like his chest. But Steve is the type who believes in second chances, in wiping a slate clean.
appreciates me around here,” he sighs dramatically. Just a few more feet and he’s home free. He’s just got to keep Steve from getting in the elevator with him. “I’ll see you later, alright? Busy day, blah blah, you know how it is – I’ll be back in time for, well, maybe not dinner, it’s movie night though, it’s Bruce’s turn, right? Don’t let Thor near the microwave if I run a little late.”
Tony kind of wanted to taunt him about it, but that would have been hypocritical, probably. (Definitely.) He’d have to settle for bringing it up during sex. Mm… Steve, naked, sprawled out on Tony’s bed. Pale against the silky red sheets. Looking up at Tony the way he does when he lifts the faceplate after a battle, eyes hot and searching, pupils blown with adrenaline. Oh, God. That… that was a very nice mental image.
“No,” Tony says again, and Steve shuts his mouth reluctantly. “No, no, still no. We’re just going to wait it out.”
“That could be really interesting, actually,” Tony says reluctantly, and he’s so, so, so glad that Steve fits his wide palm over his mouth just then because whatever was about to come out of it was both woefully off topic and probably irreversibly awkward.
“I don’t need these,” he said, and that – that should have set off some warning bells, Tony sees it now, because of course, Steve doesn’t
Refreshing the page only brings another two headlines, but Tony knows that by noon there will be dozens, maybe hundreds. He’s lucky that Steve avoids Twitter like the plague. But still… Damn. Pepper really
“You call The Bugle a legitimate news source?” Natasha squints at him like he should know better, which, fair. But it’s the principle of the thing!
Which, while entirely incomprehensible and also very, glaringly stupid, makes Tony feel like the arc reactor is overheating in his chest. He clutches a hand to it almost as if to check, but it’s cool to the touch as usual. Steve – Steve is looking at him the way that Pepper used to, except it’s more, and Steve’s not about to let him down gently with “I can’t date a superhero”, nor, apparently, is “I can’t date someone who’s been gangbanged on tape” apparently on the table. Tony sucks in a breath. He knows he’s zoning out but he can’t help it. Something momentous is happening in his brain and for once it has nothing to do with circuits.
“I’m so fucking glad that you’re amused,” Tony growls. Steve’s arms, which are wrapped tightly around his midsection, are all that’s holding him back from lunging forward and mauling the tablet on the coffee table. “Give me that, I want a name.”
The elevator doors glide open abruptly to reveal Steve, who takes one look at Tony and smiles sheepishly. “Hey! I was just about to go looking for you.”
Tony reached over and plucked the glasses back off of Steve’s collar and unfolded them, shoving them none-too-gently onto his face. Steve scrunched his nose up.
Frowning, Tony glances back over his shoulder at the elevator, wondering if Steve had bothered to look at the news before his run. Wondering if he’s upstairs right now, doing the same thing that Tony is doing – staring down at his StarkTab in horrified fascination as the speculation piles up. Some pathetic, quivering part of his brain is so overcome with anxiety that he half-expects it to start leaking out his pores at the slightest movement. Steve’s never been on the receiving end of the kind of media frenzy that Tony Stark can generate just by stepping outside, not like this, and despite the fact that it contradicts everything he knows about the man – his, holy shit he can hardly believe he gets to say this, his BOYFRIEND – Tony can’t help but feel paralyzed by the possibility that Steve had taken one look at the headlines this morning and decided that this wasn’t worth it, after all.
Inside the twisted love triangle of infamous Tony Stark, ex-fiancee Virginia “Pepper” Potts, and his new lover – Captain America himself!
Tony throws up his hands and huffs, stalking out of the room, five pairs of eyes trailing after him in bemusement.
Steve only blinked at them, confused and fondly exasperated, which is an expression that all of Tony’s friends seem to adopt around him all the time. He looked Steve up and down, slowly, and grinned smugly. He was
“Well it might be a little soon for that,” Steve hums thoughtfully. “But I’m not ruling it out.” He pauses, apparently unaware of the fact that Tony’s brain is now melting out his ears. “Except for the middle part, I’m not even going to dignify that with a response.”
“Nothing bad,” he promises quickly, grabbing Steve by the wrist the moment he’s in range. His wrists are thick enough that Tony can barely get his fingers all the way around them. “How about some privacy, first.”
feeling won’t be dislodged from his chest, from his throat, no matter how hard Tony rubs and taps at the reactor. No matter how much he swallows and coughs and breathes to ten.
“Please don’t kill Clint,” Steve says, frowning down at the paper in his hands. The cover of which is decidedly lacking in pictures of Tony’s face. Tony approves. “He promised to spar with me today and I don’t want him getting out of it that easily.”
“I’m not sure I want to know where that sentence was going,” Steve says drily from behind the towel he’s using to mop the sweat out of his hair. Tony’s mouth snaps shut and his eyes zero in on those glorious thighs. He might be drooling, he’s really not sure anymore. He’d discovered last night that sex was an excellent distraction from his anxiety and it’s a struggle not to cling to Steve like a baby koala and forget about the world for a few days. Or weeks.
He hasn’t even given any thought to how he’s going to tell Pepper about this thing between him and Steve. Outside of a professional context, she’s probably going to be hurt. Not about the fact that he’s moved on, of course, she’s been silently willing him to for months now, Tony could feel it, but – he hadn’t told her. Hadn’t asked for her advice or anything. In fact, he’s shocked he hasn’t got a dozen missed calls from her already, which can only mean one of two things: either she’s dropped everything and is already working to get it under control, or (more likely), she’s waiting for Tony to get his head out of his ass and confess to her before she lifts a finger.
“Right,” Nat sighs, reaching across to the fruit bowl and selecting an apple, turning it over idly to inspect it while she talks. “All those newspaper clippings pinned to your bedroom wall are starting to make so much sense.”
“What are you thinking about?” Steve asks, just a touch of the worry he’s clearly trying to smother in his voice. That’s… fair. Tony’s tendency to get lost in his own head is a well-known warning sign for some of his more ambitious pet projects. He’s got a couple of those half-assembled down in the workshop right now, actually, come to think of it, which he makes a mental note to stow away before the next time Steve decides to pop in unannounced and force-feed him the dinner he’d skipped.
Another thought occurs to him suddenly and Tony’s skin starts to feel too-tight, clammy. Fuck. Pepper… is
Steve was midway through tucking the arm of the glasses into the collar of his shirt; he smacked his hands over his pecs and flushed nicely.
It’s been weeks and Steve still hasn’t freaked out, or left, or gotten tired of his constant moping. Tony doesn’t
Just as Tony steps into the room, Steve looks up – it’s like he has a sixth sense, sometimes, for when Tony is in the room, or maybe he’s just hoping that it’s Tony because his eyes absolutely light up when they find him. “Tony! I thought you had to work!”
Sources say that soon after the Avengers team had settled into Stark’s iconic tower, Pepper felt she “couldn’t compete.” The Stark Industries CEO retreated to the West coast mere weeks later – “probably to get away from the lovebirds!” The same source tells us that Ms. Potts, 38, had been contemplating a separation from Mr. Stark for some time preceding the incident in Manhattan that spelled the end for their relationship. Inferences could be made about the strain of running a Fortune 500 company, which Stark has cited multiple times in the past as the driving force behind his more public breakdowns. It seems logical to conclude that Ms. Potts, who took the reins two years ago, might not have time for romance around her blossoming career.
Tony doesn’t want to think about JARVIS Jr. right now, though (which is really more proof that Steve has turned him into a gigantic useless sap.) He realizes he’s gone rigid in Steve’s grip; he relaxes, leaning back against him and tipping his head back to look at him trustingly, upside down, grinning at the way Steve’s smile softens of it’s own accord.
“I’m listening,” Steve says. H e’s doing the nervous jaw-clenching thing again, and Tony wants to reach up and rub at it, soothe him.
“I thought you were out?” Oh, no, that’s Steve’s frowny voice. Tony hates the frowny voice. Often, it’s the first warning sign before he whips out his Captain Voice, which is about ten times worse and has an unfortunate side effect of making Tony want to punch him a little. Or a lot. But Steve’s not reading him the riot act right now – he looks genuinely concerned, the cut of his jaw even more striking than usual from the way he’s clenching his teeth, eyes darting over Tony’s face in uncharacteristic nervousness as he offers, seemingly in explanation, “I read your interview with The Advocate.”
nice. Good job on the outfit, by the way, no one will be able to piece together your secret identity when they’re busy staring at your nipples.”
understand the media these days. It’s been a couple of years and it’s not like he hasn’t been thoroughly acquainted with the internet but sometimes the things he says in interviews are so painfully honest and real that Tony has to press a hand to his own chest and wince, something carefully cultivated in his chest curling up and dying of secondhand embarrassment. He wonders sometimes if Howard is rolling in his grave; he wonders, actually, if Howard knew this about Steve and had just charitably ignored it. Maybe assumed he’d grow out of it? If only he’d set aside some of that patience for his own kid, right? Tony is not bitter, not at all.
Steve cleared his throat, that shy smile twitching at his lips again. Tony feels a bubble of unbearable fondness burst in his chest at the sight of it. Steve doesn’t shift from foot to foot or stammer or give any obvious signals of distress, of anxiety, like any other person – he’s too used to keeping himself in check for that – but Tony can always see it in the way he holds himself, slightly stiff, almost formal, whenever he’s gearing up to say something about his Feelings, capital F. “You – you look nice. I don’t ever see you leave the Tower without a suit jacket.”
There are hundreds of replies, and Tony’s finger twitches toward the “show this thread” button before he can stop himself. It’s like a slow motion trainwreck, except it’s Steve’s LIFE.
He fully intends to keep talking until the doors slide shut behind him but he doesn’t even make it into the elevator before Steve follows after him, reaching for his arm to pull him back and frowning when he steps neatly out of range and nearly trips over himself getting into the compartment. “Tony. Hey. What’s wrong?”
“Oh,” Tony repeats vehemently, then falls suddenly quiet. As quickly as it had come, though, the blinding rage that had descended red across his vision dissipates; he’s not sure what does it. Maybe it’s Steve’s good-humored smile, or his heartbeat, which Tony can feel strong and steady against his back – not elevated at all, not stuttering and uneven, the way Tony’s heart feels whenever he has to read another bad word about Steve. A few months ago he might have wondered scornfully if Steve even knew what a sugar daddy was, because surely Mr. Apple Pie would be offended at the implication that he could be bought –
is what did him in, because God, Steve is just, he’s too adorable for his own good. Which is how Tony found himself ordering sixteen pounds of cardstock and rubber cement at 3am on a Tuesday, wondering how the hell this is his life.
Fuck, he thinks desperately, and has to force himself not to grind his teeth over the next one. Buzzfeed has already begun rounding up the most popular tweets.
“That’s shocking. You’ve never paid someone’s tuition in exchange for regular morning blowjobs? And here I thought you were a philanthropist.”
“Not true,” Steve says, looking put-out and still suspicious but the edges of his gaze soften as Tony waves him goodbye with his pinky finger. “I miss you already. Text me?”
Tony glares. Steve shoots her a million-watt smile, fingers carding through Tony’s hair. Unconsciously, he tips his head back into the touch, eyes fluttering shut.
At least, when he’s not being a stubborn, self-righteous asshole. Which is a semi-regular occurrence, really. But Tony had a tendency to think a little more charitably about a person that he was reasonably certain was going to end up passed out naked and sticky in his bed later, and right then, all prettied up and smiling shyly at Tony every few moments, blue eyes glimmering under those impossibly long lashes, Steve was absolutely delectable. Indescribably sweet.
“What, yeah, here I am,” Tony babbles, taking a firm mental hold of the threads of his sanity and pulling them in tight. He cannot lose it here, or in front of Steve at all. Or in front of anyone. He hops off his stool and tucks his StarkTab against his side, moving toward the elevator that Steve’s just vacated, narrowing his focus down to the number of seconds it will take approximately for him to be safely ensconced in his workshop, where he can start making the necessary phone calls with Steve none the wiser, superhearing notwithstanding. “Just on my way out, actually, did you sleep okay?”
It’s barely noon when Tony finds himself dragging his feet into the communal living area, after being literally chased out of his own office by an exasperated Pepper. He’d managed to earn his keep by attending a meeting in her place, a rare opportunity that he knew she wouldn’t be able to pass up, and had managed to make good on his promise to text Steve under the table for at least half of it until he was forced to start paying attention. It’s been a while since he had to attend one of these for any other purpose than presenting a new prototype and it’s excruciating; Steve had kept him hanging onto his sanity by a thread with a steady stream of flirtatious banter and strings of emojis but it couldn’t quite distract Tony from the growing ball of dread in his gut, leaden and ominous.
“Tony,” Steve and Bruce sigh at the same time, in almost the exact same tone. They turn to look approvingly at each other and Tony takes his chances at breaking free while Steve’s not paying attention, but he might as well be pushing at a set of steel bars; Steve just hugs him closer against his chest and rubs his smooth cheek deliberately against Tony’s scruffy one.
