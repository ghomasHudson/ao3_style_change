, with Sherlock. He’s wanted him for a very long time, and this is the closest he’ll ever get to figuring it out, so that’s what they’ll do then. Give it a try.
John takes him out properly then, to a nice restaurant, and Sherlock admits that out of all of his birthdays, this one was probably one of the more bearable. It makes John smile.
“My preferred style holds little difficulty for me.” Sherlock seems confident in his work. As he should be, it seemed like he was doing well.
Sherlock turned his head to throw him a withering glare, the tyres briefly riding up the kerb to smack back down onto the street.  Harris yelped and reached for the wheel with his free hand.  “I would be insane to let the man poking a gun into my side divide his attention like that.  Now
And so when the car parked on Baker Street Sherlock ended up lagging behind for a moment whilst John went upstairs to pack a few things. "I must apologise," he said and then turned away, flipped his collar up against the wind, and opened the street door, leaving them open-mouthed.
Some acts can be learned only through experience. John had not yet been the receptive partner during intercourse, given their mutual inexperience with that configuration; Sherlock's tentative advances in that area now were well received. Fingers were familiar, and John's body readily accepted them as he moaned and spread his thighs shamelessly. Neither of them was prepared for John's involuntary clench upon phallic penetration, nor for Sherlock's resulting involuntary buck. John's fingers closed on pale hips so hard they left purple marks blooming beneath the tips and he choked out "Wait" with watering eyes.
"The patient sends his personal thanks as well, Doctor. He understood the risks and is happy with the results."
Sherlock had kissed him hard and John had pulled back, gagging and spitting. "Jesus, what the hell have you had in your mouth?"
You’re more interesting than this. I thought your case would be interesting but it’s mind-numbingly pedestrian, oh,
John remembered pale, wide eyes looking up at him from his own bed, adrift and uncertain but determined to give him everything he asked for. He half-fell forward, pressing their foreheads close for a moment, holding his lips to feverish skin. When he straightened again, he ran a trembling hand through soft curls, whispered "I trust you, oh, God," and gave himself over.
"John Watson. And it's fine, really. Would you like another glass of wine whilst you tell me all about the rest of the people here? Particularly the ones who were rude to me?" He grinned. After a beat, she laughed and looked relieved.
“Just the two of them, single room, no hiding places. Harris is on the floor and Sherlock's got him covered. Does he know how to use a gun? His grip's odd.”
"And watch it explode. Stop pushing this and start using that massive intellect to figure out how to give ourselves time and still solve this case."
Sherlock's dressing gown fluttered as his sides heaved. The movement was visually disturbing. Mycroft averted his eyes.
The good Detective Inspector was informed of his new Craven Hill flat, an easy Tube ride from New Scotland Yard yet miraculously affordable on a policeman's salary, before he left his office that same day. Mycroft retained a very, very good barrister for the arson charge that never went to court, and Inland Revenue unexpectedly discovered they had a few matters to discuss with the landlord.
" he groaned, flopping backwards on the bed. "She must have heard a rumour about this stupid party and thought she had to get us a gift. We can't keep it, Sherlock, we have to tell her to cancel it, we really do." John sounded somewhat less than convincing. "We can't accept it under false pretences."
"It's fine, John. We'll come up with something else." One side of his mouth twisted in a half-wistful smile. "Ah, well. I was so looking forward to introducing you to Sebastian Wilkes as my
His ears flamed when he recalled how that lanky sod had announced John's sterility as if remarking on his brand of shoes. Mike's surprise had been bad enough, but the pathologist's
, who smacks me with a ruler when I garble something and makes this story much better as a result.  All mistakes are my own.
He slept even less than before, worrying about Sherlock. His newly poor stamina made his daytime fatigue insurmountable, and often he would jerk into awareness, disoriented, having fallen asleep in his chair like a doddering pensioner.
“Impressive deduction,” he ventured for the fourth time. John had not registered any of the previous three. “How did you come to your conclusion?” He paused, prepared to go on with a different topic if John's gaze remained unfocused—well, not so much unfocused as focused both inwards and quite far off simultaneously.
"You never asked if I could drive," Sherlock complained, using his elbow to bat away the revolver shoved into his ribs, "you just told me to do it. I complied. Now remove that before we hit something and you shoot me by accident and have to explain to your employer why both Holmeses are dead with nothing to show for it."
. Odds are that I'm wrong anyway; these doctors are the very best. I don't compare, and that's not through any false modesty on my part.”
The bundle Ava finds wedged into the high rafters is sickeningly small. Robbie takes her out to the dark car-park to throw her reward ball and tell her what a fine girl she is out of sight of Lestrade's team.
"Pick something else, anything, I don't care. But I can't carry that off."John stood, dropping the cardigan into the just-vacated chair, crossed to the door, and marched away down the outer hallway.
John didn't sleep that night, nothing at all like real sleep. But twice he was roused out of dozes that threatened to descend into ugly, bloody dreams by the strains of a violin being played quite badly by someone unable to properly hold a bow, and when he finally woke for the last time just after sunrise, it was to a softening erection and a warm slickness in his pants that left him confused and aching and feeling even more fucked-up than he had been before.
Mycroft, who had walked him around the garden long past the time it would have taken to call for a car to the safe-house. Mycroft, who had a dozen reasons for every action, poking and prodding his brother's partner about their intimate life, keeping John distracted...so he would react naturally when the time was right.
Finally John straightened to put his back against the wall, pressing a hand to the stitch in his side, breath slowing.
Desire was a slow burn, stirring embers rather than a conflagration. The mouth against his was soft, the hands moving over his back deliberate, their breathing deep and relaxed.
His brother regarded him for long moments, and Sherlock steeled himself. He would not co-operate. He would not. He was not a child and Mycroft couldn't bend him to his will anymore.
Sherlock was, as expected, obnoxious, obstreperous, and thoroughly vicious, and Mycroft would cheerfully have stabbed his ferrule through the little bastard's foot a hundred times over the next nine hours and sixteen minutes had Sherlock ever come down off the furniture.
A new toaster. John thought longingly of a toaster that had never had asafoetida in it. He could have one. That was something that could actually happen.
bring Ava to St Swithin's after nightfall? Robbie's stomach sinks, because Ava's a cadaver specialist, not their best live tracker, and this means they think that missing boy was murdered.
So John just brought his clean hand up to stroke the flushed face next to his, and if there was an unusual amount of sweat trickling down Sherlock's temples and John's throat was too tight to speak, well, neither of them would mention it afterwards.
it, I knew you weren't listening to me. I told you in any military society technologically advanced beyond swords that wouldn't—no. No. This won't work. I'm not falling for it. I'm not arguing with you and I'm not leaving. And what did you do to your thumb?”
position over the flagstones again, looking for approval, and before Robbie has to point it out to him, Jason realises he's being an arse and calls her off.
No sooner had the handshake ended than Mycroft had materialised at Sherlock's side. "Helen, how is your grandfather? Please give him my regards when you speak to him next. It would be a pleasure to have him for dinner when he's in the city. If you'll excuse me, I'm afraid I must steal away my brother; there's someone he really must meet. Sherlock, if you will." And just like that they were gone, and if John hadn't known to look for it he would never have seen the stiffness in Mycroft's carriage from his injured ribs.
That doesn't mean he's not fiercely, viciously glad when he sees a familiar silhouette in a posh coat striding eagerly up the stairs to the church, where he's met by the DI. Nothing in the world will bring that boy back to life, but now Robbie
His mobile rang as he was debating takeaway versus a butty, on his way to check the contents of the kitchen.
When he was high, he didn't care about pleasing omegas. When he was high, Mycroft couldn't compel him to do anything at all.
It started to rain, the slow, steadily increasing sort of drizzle that meant it was settling in for the day. Again. London had not had one full fucking dry day since he'd returned. His shoulder would ache tonight, what with the weather and the pounding he was inflicting on it. His bedsit already reeked of damp and depression and pain-sweat even to his sorry nose, and this wasn't going to help matters.
He jerked awake and heaved breaths in through his nose, stripped off his sweat-soaked shirt and pressed his forehead against his knees. He was glad Sherlock was wherever he was out of the room so there were no witnesses to the shameful whine he couldn't seem to stop.
The trousers wouldn't come down far, not with Sherlock's legs spread wide enough for John to kneel between, but it was far enough for John to get his hand in and Sherlock's cock out, to press his forehead to a too-lean belly and pull the foreskin up over the glans with his lips until he could play with it with his tongue. Honest to God, he didn't know how Sherlock was staying upright, and the way his hips jerked would surely mean a lumbar sprain but no, no, they were
Mycroft rose and stood nose to nose with his brother. "John is not Victor, and because he is not, I am making him a different kind of offer. And for your sake I kept that young reprobate out of prison, if you recall. For
When teasing and worshiping turned to urgency and fierce joining, the words these two could not say, might never say, burned between them and left them shaking.
He'd been doing so well. He had the cocaine and the little flat on Montague Street and a man on the Met who was starting to pay attention when Sherlock told him things. Life was not terrible. Mostly. Certainly not as long as he had the cocaine.
He must have been quiet too long or maybe missed a question, because Sherlock was looking at him oddly.
Impossibly dull. Indescribably dull. Possibly fatally dull. His brain might actually rot if things went on much longer like this.
John shook his head and continued to scowl out into the night. Dear God, trying to talk with the man was even more tedious than arguing with Sherlock.
Yeah, he understood that it wouldn't even occur to Sherlock to say anything. What he didn't get was why John hadn't either.
Eventually they moved beyond kisses. He stroked and caressed, worshipping with his fingers, his lips, his gaze, with all his heart. Several times he had to stop and just lean their foreheads together, breathing steadily, forcing his desire into softer channels.
“She's young,” Robbie tells him. “Give it time. And probably they got him indoors before it actually happened. She can't find a scent that isn't here.”
John shook his head in confusion before he remembered not to do that because it damned well hurt. "Um, why'd they do that? Who's responsible?"
The next thing he knew, he was sitting on a low stone wall on the other side of the field from the body with absolutely no idea how he'd come to be there. The view was nice, though, and it was a quiet place to think.
John's unsteady footsteps paused on the stair and then continued on to his bedroom. Sherlock perched on the back of the sofa and watched the fire burn down to embers.
“Your hand,” he said, spotting the rawness of his palm before Sherlock quickly turned it away. The rotation exposed long bloody scrapes around his wrists and there was something wrong with the angle of the thumb—
Then John had come back and that was better, except that it wasn't because he looked tired but very satisfied and so he might leave again to do things for Mycroft. Things that made him a part of a different world, one Sherlock couldn't follow him into because he could never follow those rules even if he cared what all of them were.
Pleased with himself, he'd started to describe the technique to him over lunch, the first meal of their day because they'd slept until early afternoon. Before he'd even explained the injury, Sherlock had abruptly declared "Boring" and pushed away from the table. John'd sat until his soup was cold, then had left his food on the table, taken his coat, and gone walking.
He blinked. There was a beat where he and Tobin glanced at each other, suddenly realising what this looked like from Harris's point of view. Tobin twitched his chin downward:
Sherlock had been pacing, making abortive attempts at playing the violin, and irritably refusing to eat while stealing John's cups of tea for hours. John had been making replacement tea without milk and savagely cursing what the frequent resulting trips to the toilet did to his knee. Mrs Hudson's presentation of John's hated old crutch (which he'd binned months ago, but "waste not, want not" was one of Mrs Hudson's favoured idioms) did not help his eroding temper. Unable to fall back on his habit of going for a walk when Sherlock became too obnoxious to bear, he was entertaining thoughts of bludgeoning the git with the kettle.
"Well, I'm hardly doing it on purpose. I'd rather like to avoid being coshed in future." He flipped the phone over. "Ha! Twice the memory of the old one. Thank you, Mycroft; Harry will spit when I tell her."
work, the kind of work that meant there was a man who would be able to use his hand again because of John, and he had something to be proud of. Sherlock could understand that. Sherlock would know what that was like, to have work that meant something.
By then he'd seen so many people make the same recalculation regarding his social status that he could anticipate every glance, every mental shift.
After a moment he closed his mouth, cleared his throat, and said in a tone that fell far short of the outrage he'd been aiming for, "Did you just threaten me?"
“Switch it on. I'll text you with the information for Mycroft when I have it. Take the car with the scrape; tell Mycroft—”
"—conspire with me against him, I know. I'd never ask you to betray his trust, John. I'd never put you in a position where you'd have to agree to that."
"Is this..." John was rarely hesitant. "Is it all right if we do this now? If it's...more than sex, when you have to be sharp and brilliant and on your guard in just a little while? Would it, um, be a distraction?"
He wasn't very worried about John and himself. That relationship would be fine. After all, the man left wearing the jacket.
John's eyes narrowed. Sherlock was breathing rapidly and he’d jerked his jaw, the one tell he never seemed to be aware of. “What are you planning?”
Then he'd watched Watson pull a gun and shoot his sodding brother-in-law right in the heart, cool as you please, just pulled it out and
Sherlock had said, as near enough as John could remember, "We need to find the pruning secateurs and the lips. I've had my solicitor draw up papers and applied for the license so we can be married Wednesday morning."
. And that’s still not the end of all this, because if they were going to cover that up, they had to get rid of the kid.”
"Here we are, now. I thought you boys would like a keepsake. You kept it so quiet! I understand not wanting a fuss or a crowd but I thought you'd at least tell—well, no matter. Young people these days! In
John prudently waited until the ambulance came to a complete stop before helping the cabbie up and limping to the paramedics. "Broken wrist here. Anything more serious up there?"
The man tilted his head as if Greg had just done something interesting, and after a slow, lazy moment, he challenged lightly, “What would you suggest?”
"—and he's never met Mr Holmes the younger, Sir, so naturally he thought that when you had visited them that day it had been to attend the ceremony, and as a result he classified this as low priority."
—and after a dozen bloody texts gone unanswered by you two—thanks very much for that, by the way—I get a call on my mobile from an untraceable number telling me to come here and tell the two of you it's all over the news, you can go home now. Whatever the hell that means. And I'm to fetch you myself because God knows the Met has nothing better for me to do than save you cab fare. And what the bloody hell happened to your faces?”
All through his childhood, alphas had been bigger, stronger, meaner, dominating the sport he wanted to play, shoving and snarling for status. The omegas were told again and again to be patient, to let them have their fun while it lasted. Some of the adults looked at the loud, pushy alphas with something like pity when they said that, but John just gritted his teeth and learned to shove back until the packs knew to leave him and his friends alone.
Well. That's...that's...when Donovan had said "gets off"...he'd honestly thought that was just a rumour.
But he didn't. He didn't because Sherlock had gained nearly four pounds and had lost the frightening grey undertone to his skin and the ketones on his breath. He slept, sometimes—still not nearly enough, but he did sometimes sleep instead of falling into an exhausted stupor, and Mycroft knew with absolute certainty that there were no needle marks on him even in the hidden places. He would keep his mouth shut and buy John Watson a new suit every damned day of his life for the nightmares he was no longer having about getting The Call, the one that stopped his heart: not the one that said, "A pinpoint nuclear bomb has been detonated at Whitehall" but the one that said, "Sir, we need you to identify a bo—"
"This is not a secure line. Get in the car, Doctor." The line went dead and John stopped worrying about being obvious and just ran.
When the footsteps had faded, Mycroft let himself curl into a ball of agony. Every breath sent spears of blinding red through his chest, focusing his attention exquisitely inwards. He lay in puddles of freezing water; he'd be risking exposure if he couldn't get to his feet soon. At least to his hands and knees, off the ground, he told himself, but bones shifted when he tried and he exhaled hard through his nose, stifling sound, and lay still just a moment longer.
Then John's hands were pressing his thighs apart, and Sherlock could only draw great, heaving breaths and cock his hips in anticipation, but again John merely ghosted fingertips and lips over Sherlock's phallus. It wasn't enough, and it was all too much, too much sensation, too much alien emotion rising in him; Sherlock closed his eyes and fought it down.
He turned from the window at the annoyed tone and regarded the figure in the doorway. "Oh, you're angry."
Author's note: M/M sexytimes herein, just in case you thought you'd wandered off into a different story.
John took a hasty swig of too-hot tea and did not think about lube, hoping his blazing ears would be chalked up to mortification.
"Dublin." Mycroft broke eye contact to collect his coat and umbrella. "We'll need an answer in short order, please; we'll arrange a cover story if you decide to accept the offer—attending medical conferences and the like, I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another appointment."
Don't do that, John. Don't. Don't." And the hands gripping John's hateful jacket had pushed him against the wall, dragging his body upward, and this time it wasn't for the sake of John's fantasy but because Sherlock wasn't frightened anymore, he was
John made a heartfelt sound of solidarity and washed down his deliciously salty chip with another mouthful. He became aware Terrence had fallen silent and he glanced up from his plate to see him, slightly open-mouthed, looking over John's shoulder. He twisted his head around, which made the walls of the pub do interesting but not entirely pleasant things.
"Dead or wounded, then; no backup from him. Would he have trusted Malcolm Harris if he'd come to the gate tonight?"
I swear to God, give me a bottle of wine and my mouth just runs on its own. Let me start over. Hi, I'm Helen Blaketon and I'm not actually as big an arse as you might think if you'd met me a few minutes earlier."
“I don't have rates. I take cases that are interesting. Sometimes people give me money or,” he waved vaguely, “tie pins or body parts or deals on the rent.” Flashing blue light from the street pulled him to the window.
But he's never shaking either man's hand after a case unless he knows they've been to the gents first.
He added, “If Waterhouse agrees to support the charge of treason, Mycroft will be safe again. Once the information has been disseminated, it will be pointless for Fitzhugh's people to target Mycroft any longer. They'll begin hiding their own tracks instead.”
It took only a few moments for a black car to stop at the wide end of the alley. By then all garments had been tucked, buttoned, straightened, or—in the case of John's tie—located in a pile of unidentifiable alleyway horror and left to dissolve. The lines of their trousers had returned with remarkable swiftness, for which they had Mycroft to thank.
"Yeah, well, I mention this on the off chance it'll keep my arse from being called out to find you next time, but you might have wanted to check yourself in before you went wandering around."
“The reason you're fatalistic and reconciled to death is because you recognise that it is a perfectly plausible outcome. You're quite right: on your own, you can do nothing to stop those whose interests would be advanced by your disappearance. You need me for that.”
hell. Mycroft was here. He hadn't had any breakfast and his choices for getting to his room were a towel or his ratty, slept-in clothes, and Mycroft and Sherlock were having a row in his flat. Excellent. Fucking splendid. Just what he needed.
My thanks as well to my beloved partner, who walked me through drug interactions and provided a crucial plot point, and who made me cumin-turmeric aloo.  I knew I loved you for a reason.
“I'd appreciate knowing any information you have about what we're headed into.  I can do my job better with more intel than less, and I'm flying blind right now.”
Swearing, she got out to inspect the damage. John thought he ought to do the same, but didn't want to risk his knee on that ice if he didn't have to. He peered through the windscreen and saw people standing calmly on the pavement near the three cars ahead. Nobody badly hurt, then.
“The glucagon helped significantly. We’ll have their most recent assessment shortly.” It was difficult for the doctors to sort the after-effects of the heart attack from the effects of the insulin. That, of course, was what had made it such a good assassination vehicle for a cardiologist personally familiar with hypoglycaemia. Mycroft would have slipped progressively towards coma and irreversible brain damage, helped along with a massive subcutaneous injection from the syringe in Banks' pocket, the cause undetected until it was too late and that, too,
he'd ever pulled, not yet understanding about himself, not yet knowing he could like both tits and cock, but knowing he wanted
day we'd have made a fuss about it, reception and rings and such, but then in my day the two of you couldn't have—well. Very small gathering, was it?"
him. His feet were pounding down the stairs whilst his head was still spinning from the sudden change in position from horizontal to vertical. He could vomit later, on the fire if necessary.
He could argue, but rejecting the gift seemed counterproductive. He settled himself and drifted, feeling the warm hand on his belly slide over his skin, around and around.
“Well, go on, let's see,” Mrs Hudson said brightly, leaning over and poking the tissue paper aside for a better look.
John was entertaining thoughts of removing his own eyeballs with a runcible spoon to stop the light stabbing into his brain when he smelled the smoke. He'd learned to ignore a great many things since moving into the flat but never ignored that one; fire around Sherlock was rarely an end in itself but usually a precursor to something worse, and there were likely to be sirens of some kind in the near future if the situation wasn't diffused immediately.
Everything had been all right after that, until they'd been eating and John's eyes lit up as he talked about the
Right there, right there in an alley where anyone might see them, right in that dirty, narrow, sordid little street, Sherlock dropped to his knees and licked John's balls.
If anyone had asked him, Robbie could have told them the way they were handling Holmes was all wrong. They were giving him lots of attention for behaviour they didn't like, and for a man or dog as lonely as Holmes, even negative attention was better than being ignored.
He was drowning in sensuality. Regardless of how he bucked or writhed, John would not quicken the pace, would not press any harder, would not concentrate his attentions on Sherlock's erection. Warm hands and lips and tongue roamed everywhere, the arousal maddeningly diffuse, filling his entire body instead of focusing on the one organ he needed to climax. It wasn't enough, it wasn't nearly enough for orgasm, and it went on and on and on without end until Sherlock was so lost in a haze of desperation and pleasure he might have wept. "Shh, shh. Just let me. Just let me," John said, his mouth on a flushed nipple, and Sherlock's back arched helplessly as his hands clawed at the sheets.
“You even burnt a fucking Windsor Blue Menthol. I think they violate international bans on biological weapons.” John paused, eyes narrowing as he sniffed, reflected, and soldiered on resolutely. “But the thing with the left thumb—”
“Full, less one round.  And yes, I had figured they weren't going to walk him into headquarters.  I doubt they've even let Harris know where that is.”
We three are going to have a little talk and you are going to stand outside in the dark and preserve your night vision so we're not all blind. Go.”
Sherlock scrambled across the rooms, dressing gown untied and flapping around him, and interposed himself between John and Mycroft, bun forgotten and dangling in one sticky hand. "Remember the coda, John," he said, staring down Mycroft, who looked understandably puzzled at this cryptic statement. Bitterly he went on, "Oh no you
Three and a half weeks later his wife said she'd like to try again, and he discovered just how big a coward he really was.
“Things that don't fit,” he said absently. That was Lestrade getting out of the car. What urgent case required a personal visit with no scrap of discretion whatsoever? Honestly, the man was
although the fabric of that shirt was still crisp, Greg tasted salt on skin when he tongued a nipple, and it was wonderful.
The streets to the hospital were remarkably clear of traffic. Sherlock had turned his head away and stared out the window into the night. Neither of them spoke. What, after all, would they have had to say?
Mycroft shifted, trying to ease the pain in his ribs. "If I can't prove that he can be useful to us, that he is a unique, irreplaceable resource worth the trouble he causes and the concerns raised by his violent allergy to authority, I don't know how long I can shield him. He has to be valuable enough to us to outweigh the risks of his potentially being used against us. This investigation is an opportunity the likes of which may not come again. I can't afford to let it pass by."
“Detective Sergeant Gregory Lestrade.” The man rose and offered his hand. Sharks had warmer smiles. “How delightful to see you again.”
They both let stand the fiction that John could be placed unsupported into a wet environment because really, it was better that way.
secret thrill while John twisted himself into knots wondering if that thing he sometimes thought he saw between them (the one everybody else seemed to see without any contortions at all) was real or all in his head.
His unofficial orders had been quite clear: Get John home at once unless it was medically necessary he stay at the hospital. If he needed anything to make that happen, it would be provided. He was not to concern himself with paperwork or policy.
Sherlock stilled, his head close enough to John's that he could feel warm breath on his face. “Oh,” he said, in tones of revelation.
Sherlock himself couldn't stop moving. “Dark fox, receding hairline, air about him that says he enjoys enemas? Yes, Mycroft. Did he offer you money?”
The brand-new black saloon idling at the kerb was upholstered in leather, so it probably wasn't going to be where he died. The abandoned warehouse it pulled into, on the other hand, seemed just right for the purpose.
"Right. Mind putting the cheese and the milk over there, thanks? That one's got bread and eggs in it, so keep it on the top and don't let the cans roll over on it, yeah? And don't shake up the beer."
He could start planning his revenge, though, since stroppiness would be the proper state of mind for that. For truly poetic justice there should be symmetry, so...lots of confusion for Sherlock. John had no illusions about his ability to take on the man in terms of intelligence but in terms of deviousness he'd give himself even odds or better.
John rested his forehead on his knees and choked back the humiliating whine in his throat. Home, London, the flat, Sherlock, home, he was home and nothing was exploding. It was fine. He put a hand on Sherlock's hair and concentrated on touch and scent to ground himself.
Gritting his teeth, he plunged into the frigid water, squinting up at the bridge and trying to estimate where the phone had fallen. It should be right...about...here. He stuck his arms into the soft, mucky bottom and rooted around, arching his neck to keep his face out of the water.
And as the alphas matured and were removed one by one when they were no longer able to control themselves around the opposite sex, the rugby teams became all-omega, and he loved that too.
Eyes closed, John pursed his lips, took a deep breath, and nodded. “Right. First thing,” he said, “no killing the neighbours.”
“The only way to make absolutely sure you’re dead is for me to cut your head off myself. I should have known better.”
Nothing sounded right. Finally the cacophony grated his own nerves raw and he tossed his bow into the chair and just raked his fingers over his head again and again. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
"It isn't that you're attracted to Mycroft," Sherlock said as he walked back into the bedroom, towelling his hair. "You're aroused because he's very dangerous and you think he might kill you for buggering—"
“Please,” he said. “Please stop this. I will pay for a clinic. I will buy you a flat. I will agree to any terms you choose. Just please stop before you harm yourself again.”
“This won't bring them back, you know. No matter what you do to me, no matter what you do to anyone, the dead will remain just that.”
By virtue of acquaintance with some former military mates who were now mercen—er, private peacekeeping forces, John had access to some very, very private websites. On those websites, there was every so often a photo of one of these, with its proud owner showing off injuries sustained while acquiring or retaining possession of said item. With something very like reverence, he lifted it out of the cardboard and gently shook it open. Strangely, when he did so, a pair of socks fell out onto the floor, but he ignored them in favour of the prize in his hands.
Mycroft had heard those tones before, from men who had nothing left to lose and whose focus had narrowed to the next breath, the next step towards escape, and the desperate attempt to hold on to the last vestige of restraint.
“What I wanted to tell you is that the security detail told me to play up his injuries over the phone in case the call was monitored,” Murray said.
They regarded each other. The colonel looked into the darkness after Harris, nodded thoughtfully, and said matter-of-factly, "We're fucking screwed."
you.  You're all safer if we catch the son of a bitch responsible for this shit.  I stay with you, you stay with little brother.  He’s a civilian; bound to be an idiot.”
John suddenly realised he'd never asked Mycroft what his security rating had been changed to.  It must be something at nosebleed-altitude if a colonel of the Grenadier Guards was deferring to his judgement without question.  Well, now that loyalties had been established, anyway.
that he might want to hurry because Sherlock was doing truly terrible things to his violin, which John could hear only too well for himself. He'd stopped sawing at the poor thing and was staring pointedly and haughtily out the window with his back to the other occupants of the room when John came in.
When he was high, he had no libido, no chinks in the armour, no handle for an omega to grasp and pull him this way or that. When he was high, he could rise above his instincts, could be a mind instead of a cock to be ridden, could be a
So far, Sherlock had managed to keep John from being chatted up by several entirely inappropriate individuals and prevented his coming to the attention of three minions of Mycroft-equivalents in hostile governments. The evening was not as boring as he'd predicted after all. But Mycroft could bugger off if he thought Sherlock would search for that damned codecracker just because he was here. He wasn't Mycroft's trained monkey and John had done that hair thing and seemed to have forgotten all about their agreement so Sherlock was busy with other matters and Mycroft could go—
Robbie liked dogs. He understood dogs. Jamie had been the best cadaver bitch he'd ever been privileged to see work, the reason he’d gotten onto the Dog Unit to begin with. An absolute bloody genius of a nose, but she got sod-all respect because know-nothing dicks got weirded out around dead things.
happened for some time now, a fact which might account for John's increased irritability and masturbatory frequency). And now John had a different and highly attractive hairstyle and had been on the verge of going home with a man for the first time. Granted, he'd thought he was going to kip on his friend's sofa, but he'd never done that before, and really, even someone as oblivious as
from each other. You're in my blood; I'm in yours. How do you think you didn't say yes to this one thing? How do you not understand? You're not that dim, so what else is going on?”
Three drinks later, he'd had a flattering amount of attention paid to him and was beginning to realise he could afford to be choosier than he'd thought. He was still reeling in a very pleasant way from turning down an offer of a threesome (and wondering what the hell was wrong with him,
John's hand crept down to stroke dripping curls. "Better now?" Sherlock nodded against his leg. "Good."
"Really lucky." She jerked her chin up the street. "Here's an ambulance. Must've already been coming for them." She tilted her head towards the cars that had blocked the roadway.
Although, really, it was hard to see how it could get much worse. Tomorrow he'd see about finding a place to stay for a while, until he sorted things.
, we backed down, and they have no respect for that. Now they think we're weak and our people out there will never be safe again. And eventually they’ll bring the fight to us. There will be more bombs in the Underground, plagues at football stadiums, chaos and fear because you let them think we’re weak."

You don't have your bloody armour and we won't have time to carry you if you get yourself shot, the window of opportunity here is too short for that. You're a liability and I need you gone so I can concentrate. Go and plaster Mycroft's knees; it's all you're good for now. Your grasp of military tactics is abysmal, by the way; it's a good thing they never let you lead a squad.”
Mycroft regarded the document in his hands. John Watson was a man of exceptional talents, it seemed, including the ability to be in a Dublin surgery and a London registrar's office at the same time.
Greg had absolutely no idea what was going on there, but the temperature in the room rose about twenty degrees and John's ears flushed pink. He resisted the urge to loosen his collar, mainly because any action that led eventually toward having fewer clothes on was disturbing. He really wouldn't have minded having an encounter suit on hand just then, as a matter of fact.
The kids are the worst. The kids are the worst and he doesn't have the luxury of getting angry. His priority is Ava.
The problem with living with Sherlock, John thought eventually, attempting to ignore the increasingly urgent pressure in his bladder as he lay very still, was that you never, never, ever knew the significance of anything. With some other person—some average, ordinary,
Sherlock, as always, lay comatose as John disentangled himself, and if John's hands slid over his bare ankles as he placed them back on the sofa, it was only because he was setting his legs down gently.
A split second later he was wide awake, eyes as fixed and staring as a hare watching a lorry bear down, convinced Sherlock had heard him from six streets away.
Sherlock tucked the skull onto the mantle, shifted it six centimetres to the left, one and a half back to the right, rotated it twenty-six degrees anti-clockwise, and then took his hand away even though the skull wasn't optimally positioned because he
It was different this time. John was slow, so, so slow. He kissed not with the urgent drawing and thrusting of the night before, but with soft presses and pulls. Sherlock shuddered and tried to grasp his neck to bring him down, but John just smiled, shook his head, and continued the slow, soft touches. It wasn't enough.
“Your proposed solution is that I hold your emergency cocaine for you and you sign emergency divorce papers for me.”
In the time it took him to hail a ride, he could have walked home on a better day, one without ice or a swollen knee. He was beyond being annoyed by then and was just grateful to be inside the cab.
They meticulously search the whole house, and when Ava finds nothing, Holmes flings up his hands and complains, “What did I say?!” as Lestrade punches at his mobile.
Because Mycroft employed very intelligent and experienced persons who were extraordinarily good at their jobs, he was notified that there was a crisis before John had left the house and was therefore able to arrive at the gate in time to forestall a greater crisis.
“He does, but that's not as reassuring as you might think.” He held up the mobile. “I'll text him we're coming in. You get the door; I'll take care of Harris.”
John's nose wrinkled again, but evidently the advantages of an affordable flat in central London outweighed the durian. He dropped gracelessly into the chair facing the window. “I met your brother yesterday. At least, he said he was your brother.”
he wasn't going to lie still as ordered, how could they have expected him to do when he thought he was fighting for his life? His John would never lie still and let anyone kill him quietly.
been the one to capture this one...yeah, yeah, that would work. And it was probably better if Watson wasn't around to see him pulling a gun on the guy he was fucking because even professionals could get funny about shit like that.
John would apologize soon and then everything would be better. He had a great deal to apologize for but Sherlock was prepared to be generous.
The deranged thing was, John understood this warped logic. But—“And what happens,” he said, “when you get bored of me? When you get frustrated that I can’t keep up, and you—you just go on without me, and—” Shit. It was getting hard to breathe again. Not
“Do struggle, if you like. I've performed total globe avulsion only on cadavers and I've always wondered how different it would be on a live subject.” He wiggled his thumbs slightly as a guide for the anatomically ignorant and Harris lay gratifyingly still. “Drop the gun.” A
He closed his eyes and rested his forehead against the handrail. He was going to have to wade in and search for his phone, then walk home with squelching shoes, trousers, and sleeves in the sleet because no taxi driver was going to stop for him. And his phone wasn't even going to work once he found it. Well, Sherlock would enjoy playing with the carcass.

Having a who-can-be-silent-longer contest with Sherlock was like trying to stare down a cat: you only won if your opponent became terminally bored. He cleared his throat. "I would
Supper was rich and comforting. He sat across from Greg and counted down the mouthfuls until he could press himself close, soak up that warmth and easy sensuality. He thought about the lube and no condoms on his nightstand and had to take slow, deep breaths.
John's outraged “Me?!” was overrun by Mrs Hudson's, “Are you two having a bit of a tiff, then? Well, with all the gadding about you boys get up to I suppose you haven't had time to settle into your new life as you ought. It can be a bit stressful, you know. All that change. You must remember to make time just for yourselves, especially at the beginning. That's one of the secrets of a happy marriage: making time.”
But then, John had texted him to come out to the pub a few days ago, that day he was dealing with paperwork up to his bloody eyeballs and hadn't even left the office until half eleven. Maybe he'd been going to tell him then.
Sherlock sprang up and paced agitatedly. “You keep saying that. What had we not already given each other? Was there anything that wasn't just a formality?” He whirled, placing his hands on the bed on either side of John and leaning intrusively close. “We kept
important patient they're supposed to be protecting—” He doubled over, giggling helplessly as his shoulders shook, sucking in his breath as the motion strained his abused back. “Oh, God. Oh, God. I can just imagine—”
"You appear to be the easiest target," he said, "the least well guarded and the one most likely to talk without realising what you've revealed. We'll let them come to you."
"Christ, you're cold and wet and now so am I, you inconsiderate git. Yes. When it was hit it felt like a bomb."
He had a new nightmare now, to add to the ones about Whitehall and the morgue. In this one, his thoughtless,
was that garment he was wearing? Any charity shop in the sceptred isle would have consigned that jumper to the rag bin without a second thought. He briefly closed his eyes, steeled himself, opened them again, and smiled pleasantly. "Dr Watson. What may I do for you?"
The kissing was lovely and hungry and started a burn low in Greg's belly. He took his time, sliding hands up and down the wiry back for a long, long while before undoing buttons and pushing fine cotton halfway off. There was more chest hair than Greg had expected, and freckles peppering pale shoulders. And oh,
John felt a strange pulsing warmth in his trouser pocket and started. Mycroft's phone. Right. Nothing as prosaic as a vibrate setting for the elder Holmes. He pulled the fabric out just enough to let him view the screen, cupping his hand over the top to block its glow. There was a text from a number he didn't recognise.
John. My whole physiology has changed to accommodate your presence. You will never not be a part of me. That is not sentiment, not choice, it is biological
Sherlock lowered his paper a few inches and glared over the top. “You're having salacious thoughts about something that isn't me. Direct violation of our agreement. Stop it.”
"What are you waiting around for? Get the car," the colonel told Harris. "We need to be long gone by the time they find the body."
He poured himself another whisky after supper, with an eye towards loose-limbed relaxation and slightly delayed arousal. Greg nodded at his inquiring eyebrow, and sipped his own refilled tumbler with half-lidded eyes and a flattering fullness beginning to press at his fly.
“So I'll give this to you. You'll put it somewhere; I won't try to find—well, yes, I will, because that's how I am, but I'll leave it alone. I've left it alone for years, I never touch it, I just need to know it's there, but I'll never use it. And you—I'll have my—our solicitor draw up papers. I'll sign them, you won't, and we'll leave them with the solicitor. You'll know they're there, if you need them. But you won't ever sign. You see? It fixes everything.”
John shifted uncomfortably in his chair again, carefully replacing the ice pack. “I forgive them the jaw,” he said lightly. “I was chewing on the bloke's wrist, after all. The sodding kick to the kidney was just retaliation, pure and simple, though. I expect I'll be pissing blood for a while.” Sherlock must have looked quite alarmed because John hastened to add, “It's normal after that sort of trauma.”
"Difficult marriages are nothing new, John. People find ways of coping. When the union is not what one had hoped, there can be other compensations. Children, for example. Arrangements could be m—"
When he was high, he didn't wake from dreams of lying on his back, wrapped in an omega's embrace, enveloped in wet heat, squeezed and squeezed and squeezed until his orgasm was pulled out of him and he could come apart, held safe inside a strong body, held safe within a strong will. When he was high, he didn't dream of surrender and submission and wake to a puddle of semen and a cold, empty ache in his chest and
Harris wasn't trigger-happy, which was a damn good thing because otherwise he'd have pissed away what was probably the biggest break he was ever going to get in his career.
“God, I needed that,” he sighed, stretching his stockinged feet towards the fire and splaying out his toes. “I don't even want to think about what's in my bedroom, given the fridge. Something awful, I'm sure; he was right pissed off.”
Sherlock grunted and rolled them both over onto their sides. John nuzzled into his neck, still too dazed to think about getting up to clean off the sticky mess. “Liked that, did you?” he mumbled, exploring a hint of stubble with his lips.
It was bloody hard to look into a stranger's face and shoot him. How much harder was it when you knew the man you were shooting?
Interesting, Sherlock mused. John's trying to hide something. Futile, of course, but intriguing that he's trying.
My God, he'd thought, blinking in astonishment. I can look like this? I've never looked like this. I could go clubbing with hair like this. And they'd
sometimes, he would say yes, and not realize the planned post-pub activity was sex instead of football on telly until the child had his tongue in John's mouth. Drunk, lonely, sexually frustrated John Watson, who continually insisted he was not gay but who was addicted to the rush of adrenaline, of surprise, of uncontrolled impulse.
Mycroft said it aloud for John's benefit. "Catch the spy and we'll have his master. Tell us everything you remember about the conversations you had today."
Sherlock choked out, and took both hands from the wall to wrap them around John's head. “God, yes, anything you want, but
John and Tobin pelted towards the noise as soon as they heard it, staying to the wooded edges of the field for cover.
Mycroft's people traced him to a magistrate's, where he'd been scheduled to receive an ASBO. A note in the report stated the man had minor injuries and a possible concussion but had refused medical treatment, saying he was a doctor and lived with a flatmate experienced in first aid.
"Oh?" He glanced up and wished he hadn't; Sherlock had come still rumpled from bedding his partner, hoping, no doubt, to provoke a reaction of disgust. He refused to allow the childish tactic to succeed. "Am I wrong? Had he said yes to you in the half hour between when I left the flat that day and when the car came for him? Was he so overcome with the need to be yours he couldn't wait until he'd returned? Then tell me why he wears no ring, Brother, because if John Watson ever made that commitment he
"That would be best," said Sherlock agreeably whilst crowding into Lestrade's personal space. "You'll want to be home early today. See what the wife's up to and all that."
"Nice try. You're changing the subject. We're going to need to soak this off. How old is this injury, Sherlock?"
Mycroft had taken advantage of the request to use John to bring Sherlock to heel (and oh, he would pay for that), but why had John approached him at all? John could be distressingly slow at times, but his natural self-preservation should have kept him away from that piranha. This required thought.
"I'm...glad to hear that, glad I could help." He couldn't help shooting a sideways glance to see if Sherlock was listening, but all he could see was the bow tapping against the fingers of his free hand behind his back.
“Yes, it’s mutated. But—” John sneaked a glance out of the corner of his eye to find Sherlock staring rigidly at some point over John's right shoulder. “—but it survives. It is not what it would have developed into without disruption, but it is capable of all the necessary processes of life: it respires, it eats, it excretes, it's even capable of reproduction, which is a luxury process.”
When he had poured himself into John, all his lust and rage and desire and fear, he'd felt him shaking beneath him and heard him, muffled by the duvet, gasping, "Please, Sherlock, God, please, I need you to touch me, please." So he had; he'd rolled John onto his side and taken him into his mouth and demanded everything. He hadn't stopped until John was spent and begging, "No more, too—too much,
"You realize that was the embodiment of every gay-sex cliché in the book, don't you? Public, violent, degrading, power imbalance—"
There were at least eight agents being prepped for surgery, possibly some in the operating theatres already and God only knew how many were incoming. Mycroft's other medical specialists were being pulled in as rapidly as they could be transported. Clearly something had gone disastrously wrong but as no one was briefing him on that side of things he'd just have to wonder what.
He put the man on his back in the bed, straddled his thighs, and for a long while simply stroked the pads of his fingers over the body beneath him, mapping the changes in texture both gross and subtle and noting hitches in John's breath. When at last the rigidity in his spine and neck ebbed away, he rolled him onto his side and repeated the process on his dorsum.
When Sherlock returned, he looked very closely at Mycroft in a way he had not done for years, observing, cataloguing, processing new data, sifting through Mycroft's mind in a distinctly unpleasant and exposing manner.
Two days later, Sherlock raced off on his own without a word whilst John was still at a crime scene. A very pissed-off John was fumbling out a text when a prickling on the back of his neck made him surreptitiously scan the area. One of Mycroft's men met his eyes, casually tapped the phone at his waist, and then went back to watching the crowd.
“Trust issues,” Sherlock murmured, letting his hand slide down and turning away—a small, unexpected kindness. “Who was your Victor, my John?” And he glided out on cat's feet, slipping the door shut behind him.
"Good to see I've still got it in me," he rumbled, and Sherlock replied, "No, I think you'll find it's all over my chest" which set them both laughing breathlessly.
, go and masturbate in the shower if you must" that had effectively wilted his enthusiasm and taken care of the problem in an entirely different way than the one he'd been hoping for.
John snorted good-naturedly and pushed at his chest until his head rested on the pillow. "Let me do this."
Sherlock grabbed the phone out of his hands. “Stay with him. Don't leave him alone for a minute, stand outside and guard the door of the operating theatre when you get there, and don't surrender your gun to anyone.
damn it. “—and I'm left behind, still tied to you, and you can't be arsed even to end it? What happens then?”
, he decided, climbing the stairs. Large, near-continuous, post-orgasmic doses of oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine might keep John from noticing any little remarks alluding to their happy state dropped by others that might occur over the next few days. An inoculant of sorts against any uncharacteristic bouts of observation on John's part.
no—until exhaustion had him nodding off for a few moments, only to jerk violently awake, slapping at the phantom draughts shifting his hair around, heart pounding, throat dry. All. Bloody. Night. For two nights.
Sherlock, even if you don’t give a damn about what happens out there, one day those soldiers will come home. And when they come home, they will bring all that wrongness back with them.”
"Yeah," said John. "It was. That unbelievably stupid arsehole with delusions of grandeur has Sherlock, who is a genius and a loose cannon and
John'd thought things would be better the next day, but despite sex that left them both shaking, sweaty, boneless, and nonverbal, they were still on edge with each other.
suggestive that a flat in a prime area of central London—specifically, 221C, a terrible security risk if occupied—remained unlet and empty, damp notwithstanding? Or that Mrs Hudson had ceased to receive bills for any utility at Baker Street since Mycroft's brother had moved into her building?
There was no sense wasting a kidnapping that included a free car ride when there was heavy shopping to carry, after all, John thought. Besides, it was just a little hard to walk this morning.
John reflexively dropped into a crouch when the door smashed open, reaching for a sidearm that wasn't there since he was only in his pants and socks. "What—?" he started before Sherlock flung himself down on the bed.
He was scrolling through the contacts in his mobile, deciding who he should send the message to since he didn't have Fitzhugh's direct line, when there was a sharp
you understand? Tiger’d been waiting for an excuse for two years and now he had one. He took volunteers into the mountains and they wiped out the kid’s village, every fucking thing that moved, down to the
The codecracking device they'd snitched a little while ago was at the heart of it. He got that. Certain groups thought the best way to it was through Sherlock and John, who had taken it. He got that, too. Somebody else'd had the idea to go through Mycroft, and that was where things got interesting because the number of people who could possibly reach Mycroft was quite small and most of them were supposed to be on his side.
For example, he had just discovered that his enemy was aware of the contingency plan that involved falling back to the boathouse, where there was both an emergency communication device and a weapon.  He'd discovered this when he'd leaned on a bit of statuary by the pond on his slow trek from the gazebo to try to catch his breath.  As he'd observed his surroundings, he'd seen the faintest flicker of movement a sniper's distance from the door:  insects riding the tiny thermal caused by human body heat.
The phone was a cheap, low-end model with little memory. Clothing good quality but outdated, likely from a consignment rather than charity shop, and slightly loose on his frame despite having been recently purchased: money problems, more than just the difficulty of affording London alone on an Army pension. Gambling, not for money but because he was bored and chasing a thrill. Oh, this man was
Sherlock puts a hand on John’s neck, and John breathes at that as if he likes it. Sherlock tilts his face, so John can kiss on. John does, over his jaw, too. Then back to his mouth, hard. Sherlock doesn’t pull away, but he wants to.
Of course Sherlock feels comfortable with it. He felt it from the second Violet was born. Probably before, too, but he didn’t know yet that he did. He’s aware that his answer sounds choked. “Yes. I want to.”
And then they’re up to John. He’s not nervous - it’s solid work, and he knows it. Mike looks at the tattoo and comments, “I think you absolutely understood what the challenge was and didn’t overdesign.”
And then to have John kiss his shoulder and say, “I’m going home, promised we’d go to the morgue early tomorrow. Molly’s back from her honeymoon and there’s a pile of bodies.”
John’s eyelashes are dark with tears, his cheeks gleam with wetness, and he wipes his nose on his sleeve. He seems embarrassed. “Sorry. About that.”
Sherlock is counting the days - how many since Mycroft’s last failed implantation, how many since John got a girlfriend. He’s always conscious of both. They are a clock in the back of his mind.
The camera crew comes around because they want to film each tattoo as well, so John actually has to take the cling film off again for that part.
Oh, actually… “I’ve got some space behind my knees.” Mike skipped it because the skin was scarring and considering the pain level they agreed it was for the best. “Not easy to tattoo though.”
Or the face John makes now as he asks, “Good?” There is a momentary hesitation in John’s hands as he waits for an answer.
, surely. Or Mummy must have suspected at least. Sherlock says, “We didn’t come because Mycroft has a child.”
As soon as the camera operator signals him, Mike announces, “Good afternoon, contestants. Your next elimination challenge has been set by… Irene!”
Sherlock wears John’s engagement ring, even though it feels foreign on his finger. It is a simple gold band, exactly the right size. Sherlock develops the habit of curling his hand around it and touching it.
John takes her out of her high chair, cleans her face, and plays with her for a bit. Sherlock can feel his heart hammering, aware that they’ll be talking about it soon. They have to. When Mycroft arrives, Sherlock dresses Violet quickly, and practically pushes her into his arms. “Yes, bye.”
Sherlock gives him a kiss before he goes to work in the mornings, and John gives him one back at night.
There’s a flicker of surprise on both Mike’s and Irene’s faces that is smoothed out quickly. Did they think he was going to agree?
“Well…” John reaches out and plucks the cigarette from between Sherlock’s fingers. Sherlock frowns at him, but John’s eyes shine with mischief when he says, “They’re not good for you anyway.”
John hands him the towels, and then sits next to him, presumably for comfort. Mycroft tries to dissociate from the feeling between his legs, but at the same time it is all he can feel. The slow tension building inside of him, as well as a rolling sensation that is perhaps the baby, perhaps just his own fear.
But his life hadn't felt real since the Incident, and despite knowing the dangers of hope, he wanted to believe there was a chance of survival.
Sherlock's lips twitched. "That's one way of putting it into perspective." And there, the easiness between them was back. John drew a deep breath and let his shoulders relax.
"You could read. I packed that horrible novel you were reading." John was going to refuse until Sherlock added, "And maybe you could stroke my hair?"
A sharp rap at the door preceded the appearance of a stocky man in a doctor's coat, who seemed surprised to see John and Sherlock there and surprised again to see Mycroft alert. He said with a sigh, “If they let you on this floor, there's no point in my saying you shouldn't be disturbing my patient because I won't be able to throw you out. The lads outside have been over my security clearance so I suppose you'll be wanting to grill me on my medical credentials.”
“A tendency to myopia, perhaps, but that runs in families, you know. Miss Anne already needs spectacles.”
"You think detection the centre of my life. London, my lodestone. Once, perhaps. You know Winwood Reade writes that ‘there is a great enterprise in which men have always been unconsciously engaged…the conquest of the planet on which we dwell.’ He goes on to say ‘we can conquer Nature only by obeying her laws, and in order to obey those laws we must first learn what they are’.  If my true centre comes with me, I may get nearer the laws of nature the further away I get from the laws of man."
221b Baker Street rarely reached a state of grace but by this time in his career Holmes had means enough to have no need to eke out the coals: not that he gave a jot for appearances. Otherwise, he might not have been stretched out as he was on our sofa before the fire, in place of our accustomed chairs, still half-dressed, when anyone might have come in.
Stored in a certain tin dispatch box are secrets that would topple governments, ruin families, explain a dozen international mysteries and gravely embarrass a dog-catcher in Deptford. Yet there is one story that shall never find its way there. It has stayed within the confines of two skulls for twenty years, almost the whole of this present century so far, and though I write it down now – to read aloud at our hearth and remember - it belongs to us, not to the world.
Sherlock Holmes threw down his newspaper and, still stewing in disgust, stalked over to the mantelpiece to refill his cherrywood pipe.
He snatched the rags from my hands and stuffed them away seemingly somewhere under his chin, muttering.
People have asked me if I am ever weary of it: of waiting to be told, of being two steps behind, of being the junior partner in the enterprise, although I am the elder by some years and a man of the world as Holmes, in so many ways, is not. What they really mean, of course is that
be interested in men as well as, undoubtedly, women. In what light he regarded myself specifically – on that subject, I veered between hope and dismissal several times a week.
“Do tuck in, Mr Holmes.” Her smile would not, in point of fact, have been out of place on a successful turf accountant.
She made sure he saw her tick “severe” on the tablet. Eliza had an eidetic memory and Mycroft's record would be wiped before she left the building, so the gesture was especially pointed.
"Yeah, that's fine," he said, trying to keep his teeth from chattering. "Would you mind turning up the heat?"
The boy's body swayed toward John. His eyes followed John instead of the projectile. His posture mimicked John's so closely they all but breathed in tandem. In about twenty minutes, he was going to ask John home. And because John really could be spectacularly
“This article, Watson. The author skirts and weaves around the subject like a timorous waiter at a garden party. Listen to this: ‘No decent-minded person can be ignorant of the danger to the budding flowers of our  great nation of corrupting entertainments, of effete, oriental trash masquerading as art, of so-called works of philosophy which are nothing more than conduits for perverse suggestion. They can only weaken moral fibre, compound the natural folly of youth and leave boys lacking what is most necessary to good character: manliness.’ We are no doubt supposed to infer his true subject without putting him to the unendurable trouble of plain speaking.”
"Or of our sort and not shy about it," said Holmes. The young clarinettist in the third chair seemed to lend weight to his case, giving us both something of the same, broad, rather conniving wink as the zookeeper. I could not help but sense some connection. Yet beyond Holmes’ not unreasonable suggestion – for it was true, the fellowship of inverts, into which I had plunged since becoming Holmes’ more than intimate friend, shared such greetings and signals constantly under the nose of the common herd – I could not put my finger on it.
It was the year before the Agra Treasure was cast into the Thames. I was five years past thirty and the world had sunk its claws into me.
Dawn spends a great deal of time and energy creeping about making ready to enlighten the world. First birdsong in the darkest hours, mist and grey shadows streaked with red, the shape of the plane tree in our yard distinguished more and more and then – nature strikes no clock, though man has tried to pin down sunrise to the minute, but morning comes and none can deny it.
We had been running down a hundred alleyways south of the river all afternoon, pursuing a gang of Rotherhithe coiners. By the time they were twisting and swearing in official hands, I was not the only one limping. A cab ride home eased me, but Holmes continued to frown and fuss under his breath even after we arrived at our rooms.
A case. He wanted a case, and a benevolent providence duly sent him one. Miss Lucy Filbert had been sick, sick all her life, but according to her doctor’s report not likely to die of it at thirty-eight. The railing of a lively and independent mind confined to a trivial round of paying formal calls and winding wool for her aged mother, would have been my own diagnosis. When she died less than a month after that sole parent left this world, it would have been easy to praise the riches of her filial affection and ignore the enormous fortune that would have finally set her free.
We alighted at the Crystal Park Station and made our way up Sydenham Hill toward the great cathedral of glass, once the wonder of the nations, the magnet of the people and now…a very large greenhouse, supporting a thin family of potted palms and a dense crowd of late-morning tea-havers and dance-card markers.
One should stand tall when taking an oath, making a promise, owning a fault and claiming a prize. All the more when one is doing all of them at the same time.
Galaxies of blackthorn flowers surprised and delighted, their white stars scattered all about the hedgerows. Faded Persian carpets of buttery primroses, sky-blue squill and white and purple crocus lay spread over cottage gardens, waiting for the sun to bring out their colour. We bumped over a bridge across a canal, past the lock basin. Gloss-painted barges bobbed in the swells; whiskery pull-horses ate from buckets of oats strung round their noses. Willows wept the yellow fire of their new shoots into the water.
Beside the station was a goods yard. Stacks of timber, bags of feed and barrels of tar crowded one another with only a few spaces between. Into one of these Holmes scrambled, carrying his bags awkwardly in front of him, nearly toppling a pile of empty pallets. The foreman, I noticed, was enjoying a swift smoke and a newspaper behind the outhouse.
“And you in turn have no desire to be put there.” It was not a question. “Then refuse. A lady is permitted to refuse marriage.” He appraised her again. “Forgive me if I state the obvious, and ask the obvious too. Miss Heacham, why have you come to
The boatman Fosdyck, who it appeared often posed as a crony of Holmes in his Captain Basil disguise but in truth acted as his knowing guide and factotum all through the Thames fraternity – cheerfully let us off at Ratcliff Cross Stairs – near the scene of that infamous (and still unsolved after almost a century) domestic slaughter on the Ratcliff Highway: an account of which, Holmes had once told me, was his first introduction to sensationalist literature, "and bungling officialdom".
It was early spring in the English countryside. Despite the mud that sprayed up every time the dog-cart’s wheels passed through a dip in the lane, despite the cold air nipping at the tops of my ears where my muffler did not quite cover them, the season’s gift of freshness, and the promise of warm days to come, buoyed me up.
“My current way of life is a distinct and deliberate departure. I have had enough of other people’s secrets and lies to last a lifetime, thank you.”
He wanted to ask why and when and and what now but the questions were too many, too crowded, too dependent on one another to struggle into the open on their own.
"To business, Mr Holmes," said Kitty, lifting a heavy ledger onto the counter. "We know every customer, every piece; it's all here. The first attack was a shock, I can tell you – the second a coincidence, p'raps – there's enough in London as don't think twice about doing such things - up to five, where we are now, all of them ladies we know: by
Of all the things Robbie resents most on behalf of his cadaver dogs, it's the notion that the dogs should be sorrowful when they find a body, which is bloody hypocritical because the police themselves don't do that, can't afford to let soft emotions get mixed up in it that way. No, when a dog finds what he was set to find, be it a lost toddler in the woods or a bomb in the Underground or a corpse, he has a right to celebrate. But because civilians are squeamish about cadavers, a handler learns to take his dog off somewhere out of sight to throw his favourite toy and make a fuss over a job well done, and Watson seems to have figured that out.
John shoved his Browning in his jacket pocket and zipped it in. "Took you long enough to get here. Sodding
How lonely did a man have to be to crawl into his flatmate's bed for a scrap of comfort and human touch? It made his chest hurt to think about it, and all his anger at the deception and his need for revenge drained away. It was a stupid plan—meta-plan—anyway. That had been an awfully nice suit, though, and he was still pissed off at Sherlock for throwing it out the window. It wasn't like he had another couple of hundred pounds to just toss around like that. John sighed. To Sherlock, money was something that happened to other people.
he didn't say, because his brother would never let him into his life that way again. Not after Victor.
"You said you wanted the blood on my hands," John said. "You meant the killing, I know, but it's this too, Sherlock. Time to decide. Did you mean it, that you want it all?"
Whereas John was not dull. And if Mycroft would just bugger off, Sherlock could secure John's agreement to his enormously clever plan and they could start testing the hypothesis right away. He bared his teeth at Mycroft and hissed in annoyance, which led to more pointed umbrella thumping.
He stripped off his coat and threw it over his chair, then knelt to build up the fire. He didn't get it. He just didn't get how she could notice so much and still have such a blind spot where Sherlock was concerned. “Look at that freak,” she'd said. “They're just pieces of meat to him,” and John had wanted to ask her how she thought it was that a man who supposedly didn't care about people spent his time observing them with all the fascination and longing of a kid with his face pressed against the window of a sweet shop.
“They wrapped my shirt over his face and told him they’d give him to me. I was—I was just starting to go into heat, my shirt reeked of it, and he was
John knew. That was bad, but bearable, that John knew, because John was part of him and it wasn't much different from knowing himself, not really. John understood it was precious and private and held close, wrapped in silence to protect it. It was...all right that John knew.
Sherlock nodded. “Of course. If he appeared likely to die without...outside assistance, there was a better chance Fitzhugh's people would wait and see if an assassination attempt was really necessary,” he said coolly, but John saw the way his eyes scanned his brother's pale and clammy face, the IV taped to his forearm, the nasal cannula.
I first learned about soldiers wearing dogtags on their boots so at least one body part could be identified in the event of an explosion from
John twitched interestingly before considering and finally pronouncing, “No.” A comprehensive search of John's possessions moved from number 8 to 3 on Sherlock's list of priorities. John adjusted the pillow behind him and continued, “Looked up your blog last night.”
He made a dissatisfied noise but John could see the wheels already turning at the challenge. "If your grandmother taught you entomology, why did you call my insects 'bugs'? Only a third of them are."
He shifted in his chair, trying to ease the tightness in his lower back. He wasn't as young as he used to be and lying around with Sherlock hadn't done his lumbar spine any favours although it had been worth it to run his fingers through those soft curls and watch Sherlock's expression smooth out and grow lighter whilst his breathing deepened. He'd looked happy and relaxed as he sorted out bits and pieces of information about the case aloud, organizing them in his idiosyncratic way.
Presumably Mycroft's fictional disapproval would have been justified had John been a plumber, then. Interesting.
Something huge, white, very angry, and fast beat the shit out of him. Somehow, feathers were involved.
He went east, away from the big parks and their bloody swans, and watched his breath puff in the cold air with each stride.
was that with Sherlock, the explanation could be literally anything, and you just absolutely never knew when it was the obvious thing and when it was something...else.
, who made this better than it was and who deserve medals for the feat.  All errors, blunders, lapses in sanity, and spells of contrariness are my own.
Sherlock, I bought it and don't you dare go tossing it out because I'm not spending a couple of hundred pounds every time you—what are you choking on?"), for her expression to settle into a polite, distant mask, for the conversation to trickle off as she made her excuses and glided away to talk to someone with more potentially useful connections.
To every single person who commented, subscribed, left kudos, and lurked: Thank you for taking the time out of your day to engage with this story. I'm deeply grateful that you chose to do so.
“Clever,” Sherlock said, which was probably as close as the Holmes brothers could ever come to saying “I love you and I'm glad you're not dead, you insufferable twat.”
His bandages peeked out from beneath his cuffs, and John had a sudden, horrible thought. He whirled and caught Sherlock's elbow.
“Is that the best you can offer?” he asked cheekily, and was delighted to see a small, surprised, pleased smile in return.
Sherlock was still sleeping when John had made dinner and washed up, so he left a wrapped plate on the nightstand and slipped into bed next to the long, sleek form that was now as necessary to his happiness as breath.
There was one hell of a commotion by the side door but Mycroft had toppled, coiling around his chest again, and couldn't lift his face out of the slime to see.
When the suit had been delivered (along with a shirt, tie, and pair of shoes John didn't remember buying), Sherlock had grudgingly admitted it was a nice suit, glared at the tie as if it had insulted his mother, and flung himself onto the sofa, knees up, to curl his lip at the ceiling. John's eyes had naturally gone straight to that arse, and that's when he decided he was going to the barber's to buy hair product.
Sherlock nudged him with a knee. “Hearthrug. Pull down the blanket from the sofa and rummage in the seat cushions. We left a bottle of lube there in November; I doubt Mrs Hudson removed it when cleaning. We're going to have intercourse and I want to be warm. The beds will be freezing.”
"No. Don't. No games, Sherlock." The man on the bed looked at him then, with eyes that weren't John's. "I can't even be angry with you. You truly don't think you've done anything wrong."
"You are seriously creeping the hell out of me, Mycroft. This conversation is unbelievably inappropriate. Drop it
"I've had three hours of sleep in the last two days and I was in surgery for most of one of those. Could I at least have coffee and toast before you start in on me?"
When he sat on the bench by the winter pond and tossed maize to the ducks, he wondered if that was really the best legacy he could leave behind.
Sherlock would probably have something cutting to say about that flight of sentiment, but Sherlock made fun of him for many things and John wasn't much inclined to change important parts of himself just because of that. A decent bloke didn't lay open someone's body and heart and soul that way and then leave, even if that someone said a body was transport and he didn't have a heart and nobody had a soul. You just didn't do that, didn't knock down someone's walls and then leave him vulnerable and alone. The two of them could just order takeaway again, it wouldn't matter for another night.
—and growled a steady monologue of all the curses he knew. When he eventually ran out, he started combining them creatively and personalising every single one of them for Sherlock.
Eventually the door opened and the two men emerged. “An ugly business,” said Waterhouse, who was now holding the backup drive. “To think that one of our own.... I'm sorry to hear about Mycroft. I'm sure you'll want to be with him now. My gentlemen will take you there.” It was clearly a dismissal.
Lestrade's jaw went oddly rigid for a moment. He cleared his throat, swallowed, and said, "No trouble at all."
"And John? If you ever touch someone else that way, I will do bad things, very bad things, and Mycroft will cover them up."
Sherlock estimated he had another forty minutes before this tremendously interesting painkiller's side effects dropped below useful levels. Never one to waste an opportunity, he leaned in to nuzzle John's sensitive, vulnerable ear and purred, "Why don't you—" John pressed into the hand stroking his abdomen. "—tell me a secret."
Sherlock propped himself up on one arm and trailed his fingers through John's hair. Waiting, John realised. He took a steadying breath and told himself he could not in good conscience refuse to do something his lover had just done for him and which he had on several memorable occasions literally begged other lovers to do. He let his fingers curl around Sherlock, ran his thumb in circles over the slick head. The body under him arched, and he looked up to see silver eyes locked on his own face. Slowly he lowered his head and ran his tongue over the path his thumb had taken.
"Lestrade, come here." Sherlock pointed to a spot on the ground below the railing that looked like every other spot beneath the railing. "John, take a look."
“Beer's a diuretic; it'll be good for my kidneys. And seriously I can't take Mrs Hudson’s comments one more bloody minute. You'll be doing me a favour. Be there in twenty.”
Instead her face lit with sudden warmth and she said artlessly, "Oh, it's a love match, then," before slapping a hand over her mouth and blurting, "Oh, God, that was tactless. Forgive me."
The phone pinged softly.  John glanced at the screen and blinked at the message sent from his own mobile.
In every scenario he'd imagined, John had been angry. Sherlock had anticipated that, had contingencies for every variation: shouting, flinging projectiles, attempting to storm off. He could direct anger, could talk John around. Anger was fine. In some scenarios it led to sex. He would provoke John into using the handcuffs and being very rough, and when his anger had burnt out and he felt guilty he would come around. It would be fine.
"There?" Sherlock placed the heel of his hand over the spot and leaned his body into it, eyes glittering like some lethal jungle cat's. The pain was shockingly vivid. "You provoked him repeatedly, every time his attention turned from you. What didn't you want him to notice?
"—so physical intimacy really is the most sensible solution. We will of course refrain from intercourse during cases—I can't have that kind of distraction; it's nearly as bothersome as eating—although you may masturbate if you really can't help yourself, since it doesn't seem to diminish an inferior brain the same way and tends to make you less irritating. So, we are agreed? John?
“It's good to see you boys have made up,” Mrs Hudson called up the stairs after them as they slammed the doors to the flat shut and proceeded to ensure they'd be receiving a second pointed gift from the neighbours.
Her lovely, lovely face pinches, lips going tight, and oh, hell, he'd really liked this one. But better to find out now—
it, all of it, loved surrounding hard, hot flesh, loved the whimpers and shouts, loved the way semen would drip down his thighs when he pulled the orgasms from his bedmate.
Right. That strategy explained some of the anomalies he was seeing, but not all. John kept flipping through the chart. He backed up, read the test results again, examined the monitor readouts. “He did have an MI, and his lung was partially collapsed but a chest drain sorted that out. That's good,” he added for Sherlock's benefit. “He's had periods of consciousness?” Murray nodded. “His response patterns are...atypical,” he noted. “He's intermittently alert but doesn't speak—” He had, in fact, become more confused and disoriented over time rather than less.
After several long minutes of nothing, John levered himself to his feet with the cane and stumped out onto the pavement. A woman looked up from her mobile, blinked at him vaguely, and said, “This way.”
Since they'd begun having physical relations, John's innate sensuality had thrummed against Sherlock's skin like the notes of a cello. Annoyingly, he was not alone in this;
, who not only points out where phrases have gone all pants but keeps me on-course regarding how characters would act. (I have a virtual alpaca cria for you, dear. I figured you'd prefer that to a biscuit.) All mistakes are entirely my own.
John hastily scooted backwards off the bed, nearly getting whiplash as his head was yanked forward in protest. “Sherlock,” he said desperately, “let go. I've got to piss.”
His lips were numb. His tongue was thick and uncooperative. “All you've done is replace one addiction with another. He's got to be something more than your new habit, Sherlock.” His hands were all pins and needles. His heel throbbed. He fumbled with the car door and clambered through, slamming it behind him.
Both Greg and Sherlock regarded the unsteady doctor, listing noticeably even whilst standing still, and came to the same awful realisation simultaneously.
Voice, the one John had heard most recently whilst listening to the sleet and watching Sherlock's eyes shift from grey to green to blue as the sweat had dried on the body beneath him. He'd tried not to swallow too conspicuously as Sherlock smoothly extended his hand to Helen.
Fifteen minutes later, showered, shaven, and dressed in the suit that had been hanging just outside the bathroom, John found a breakfast tray set up in the bedroom. Mycroft was there, Sherlock was not.
He could have told himself it was because John needed the comfort; clearly his nightmares had returned. He could have said it was insurance against John's anger if he found out about the registrar's. He knew very well, though, that those were partial truths at best, and to himself, if to no one else, he could admit the yearning and
"Jesus, I hope not. He was breathing when I took his phone but I don't know how bad his injuries are. He said he couldn't be a hostage."
“—wool. Friction burns are going to make wearing trousers a nightmare and no, I will not wear one of those atrocious tracksuit bottoms in public, John; I have standards, so don’t even think of suggesting it. And I would appreciate it if at some point you could see your way to removing your iliac crest from my bladder.”
"Damn, my knee hurts." John shifted his shoulders to get more comfortable and closed his eyes. A moment later he half-opened them, found Sherlock's, and murmured, "Not tired?"
Back in his car, Greg turned the ignition and then sat for a couple of minutes, considering what he'd just left and what awaited him at home. If he was ever lucky enough to have someone look at him the way John Watson looked at Sherlock Holmes when he wasn't hiding anything, he hoped he'd be brave enough not to give a shit whether it was a man or a woman either.
him exactly, because they weren't introduced, but was in the same room at the same time—DI Lestrade's people had found the body in the wall just where Holmes had said it would be, and the man had spun triumphantly on his heel and laughed.
He drank in the sight of his John deep in passion, chest flushed, hips rocking, throat working around low, earthy moans. His phallus stood to attention between them, proud and wet with arousal, and Sherlock reached to glide his fingertips over the head in small circles. The moans turned to shuddering cries and he found himself driving up into the body clenched so wonderfully around his own, wanting more, more,
"Don't try lying, John, you really are terrible at it and it's ghastly to watch. You need a proper painkiller. Paracetamol isn't enough."
At first, it had been hilarious. John had sniggered to himself in the queue for tea, ridiculously chuffed at being cleverer than Sherlock. He'd seen through Sherlock's smokescreen and was one up on the git, and there had to be a million ways to take advantage of that. But then it had sunk in.
To tell the truth, he'd been a bit hesitant to call Sherlock out for this one. He was pretty sure it was a case Sherlock would consider dull, dull,
John had said the night before, and John in a vest hung with explosives had not looked so desperate to be somewhere,
Sherlock kissed his thigh and lifted his face again. "Everything," he said hoarsely. "Don't keep anything from me."
He woke on a narrow bed with the softest, crispest sheets he'd ever touched. Right, then. He was in the safe-house Mycroft had insisted on. A very, very posh safe-house. Sherlock was pacing and messing about with his phone on the other side of the room instead of tearing around London, so they must still be in lockdown.
Sherlock slid into the seat beside him, Tobin at his heels. The door shut and there was no more sound from within. John watched the estate as if he could stare through the chassis by force of will alone.
The good doctor was making a heroic effort, but clearly the body was weaker than the spirit and he was flagging. He hoped Sherlock would remember to let the man sleep at least a short while.
"You think yourself very clever, Mr Sherlock Holmes. It is no use to assure you that I did not do it, I suppose?"
“I am seldom persuaded by the concerns of medical men, Dr Simpson. They are quick to raise the alarm over intemperate habits, yet too slow to spot crime: surely a more immediate danger to life and health.”
My friend made no answer, only lengthened his stride so that I was extremely hard put to keep up. Injecting himself like a dose of cocaine into the rushing bloodstream of London, he swept out of our front door and north along Baker Street.
Watson gets much of the credit for that. In his stories I am a paragon of pure reason who disdains human connection, emotion and the flesh - scarcely human or, if human, not very likeable. Candidly, I admit that last part is probably of some substance. One must make an effort to be universally likeable and I do not care to. I care for the good opinion of very few but I do care a good deal about those few. I care most of all about only one.  For more than twenty years his words were my advertisement and then and after also my shield. Now Doyle is dead and Watson has no heart to write at anyone else's bidding. The oeuvre – the myth - is complete. I have even heard of a sort of correspondence club made up of gentlemen with apparently nothing better to do, devoted to speculation on the "truth" behind our exploits. As if there was only one truth to be found. As if we did not purposely hide the most important ones.
And so to the end of the avenue of limes and the front door of Low Hall, where a servant girl of no more than twelve let us in, cradling a feather duster in the crook of her arm as if it were a doll. She took our hats and coats, carried them piled on top of her until she nearly disappeared beneath a heap of plush and wool, and hung them on the coat-stand before skipping off to find her mistress. She made me feel old as Methuselah.
“It is a gift undeserved. A man decides in favour of another, even as you decide which cells to feed and which to ignore. Royal jelly, not to make a Queen but to make a life as rich as any man has a right to. Even a solitary bee like myself. It is more than association, more than rank, more than role. It always has a name and mine… my friendship is called John.”
I made several precise cuts into the last of a hot game pie to render it into digestible morsels, giving the action all my attention as I spoke.
"A 'woman's weapon' is any weapon she chooses, as is a man's. A man's motive, now what would that be?"
Anyone familiar with our lives only from what Doyle insists his readers want to hear, would think it one long round of chases on foot through the blackest streets, tussles with hardened villains on the docks and the deductive equivalent of pulling rabbits out of a hat. In fact I have spent many more hours searching through archives, in newspaper rooms and waiting in corridors to see people who fancied themselves more important than I am.
Butterworth turned between us wide-eyed, appealing to the ladies, twisting his head to look behind him - suspecting a prank, some rude initiation  from colleagues even now hiding in the shadows. Four pairs of patient eyes waited for the proverbial penny to drop. In the back room, the clatter of tools and treadles had silenced and a gaggle of girls in leather aprons watched us through the hatch.
I left off the thought of how a man might feel even years after a deception such as Reichenbach. Watson, I could see, had not: yet he did not bring it to the table.
Low Hall deserved its name. Its eaves hung heavy over the upper storey of a long, squat building that might have been made for midgets or dolls, so cramped were its doorways, so miniature its windows. The grounds, though, were glorious. Sweeping pastures, crowned with wreaths of oak and beech groves, rose up around a domestic garden devoted to flowering shrubs, above all to the camellia in every variety.
Sherlock Holmes wanted nothing of the flesh – except instant obedience - and cared nothing for love. So I thought then. For every slice of wedding cake sent by reunited lovers as thanks for his help there was a speech for me about the traps the procreative urge has set for mankind, how much violence is done to good sense by giving in to its prompts, how it can never bring lasting happiness.
When John's hands finally moved to Sherlock's nipples, he exhaled sharply in relief and half-rose off the bed to tear at John's clothing, but again John shook his head and pressed him back to the mattress. He trailed light, teasing fingers across his bare abdomen, sternum, ribs, running fire down Sherlock's spine and making his shoulders jerk involuntarily. "Shh, shh. Push into what feels good," John murmured in his ear, the warm breath bringing another rush of blood to his groin.
"No, no, that's...fine. I could sleep through Guy Fawkes tonight, I think. I'm not kicking you out of your bed, am I? I can make it up to mine."

of Mycroft's that he had clearly enjoyed very much and wanted to do again, and all Sherlock could think just then was
When Sherlock actually did so without argument, John upwardly revised his estimate of the severity level.
He let silence settle between them again. "Is it truly unforgivable, that he was so frightened of losing you that he reacted this way? He doesn't understand the difference between the form and the spirit of the thing, but John, at least he tried to give you something he thought you would want."
“Oh, don't try to convince me that was anything but a cover story to plant a bodyguard with your brother.”
at him during the car ride from the flat to Mycroft's, and quite possibly John had not breathed even once the entire trip. Immediately they'd arrived, Sherlock had whisked him past the rest of the house into what would be their shared bedroom. John had the impression of lots of wood and light but mostly his thoughts, if you could call them thoughts, were of the desperate need to get Sherlock's wicked tongue on his cock
Now they were on the bed and John didn't know how that had happened or where their clothes had gone and he really, really didn't care because he'd kept hold of the lube, which was the important thing. For a bloke who had never given nor received a blowjob until three weeks ago, Sherlock was bloody
capacity. It's not just for my benefit, but yours as well. Despite his hopelessly obnoxious manner, I believe you've found him quite useful at times. In fact, as you are aware, his unacknowledged assistance with several difficult cases may have been instrumental in your possible promotion, Detective Sergeant. You're up for review shortly, are you not?”
The reagent was finally at the proper concentration and the experiment was at a delicate stage but progressing very nicely when John stormed into the kitchen and shook Mycroft's damned jacket under his nose, blocking his view of the flask. "Did you bring up marriage because of this?" he demanded. Sherlock impatiently pushed it aside, craning his neck to watch the flask. He'd need to add the copper as soon as the foaming started.
"The thing is," John said thickly, not raising his face, "the thing is, you don't think you've done anything wrong. That's what really scares me. You genuinely don't understand consent, and that is truly frightening."
Mycroft breathed with the unnatural stiffness of a man with a cracked rib. John squinted at Sherlock's bound arm and wondered what they weren't telling him. Probably more than he could imagine.
"Get these off." Sherlock unfastened John's cufflinks and dropped them into the chair. "What? We'll remember where they are."
He ought to have been shaking. Any normal person would have been shaking right now, and instead his left hand was rock-steady. There was something wrong with him, deep-down wrong, to get steadier in the face of awfulness like this.
John was supposed to have said, “Staying isn't hard, you great git.” He was supposed to have brought a mug of tea to Sherlock, let his thumb run over Sherlock's knuckles as it exchanged hands, and smiled his warm, slow smile. Then everything would have been all right.
He's bad with words, but there's no possible way he could be worse at it than Holmes surely was, so that's hopeful: apparently you can do a miserable job of it and still have it work out. That takes a bit of pressure off. He can do this, he thinks, stroking Ava's muzzle with a forefinger. Even if he fucks it up a bit, they can still come out all right.
“There are a few perquisites to go with the annoyances.” He toyed with a stoppered flask of—oh, that was where the chlorine trifluoride had got to. Best set that aside. “Mycroft's penned us in. We've come to the attention of influential people now, and we'll need him to keep them off our backs.” He drew a breath. “John, I know—oh, bloody hell,
but at least he was safe now. Something didn't seem quite right about that bit but it was fine because he had fresh chips in front of him and that made everything all right.
He pressed his lips to the flapping ones below him. “Yeah, fuck you, you tosser.” He grinned, still a bit cross-eyed. “As many times as I bloody like, in fact.”
Robbie can't help but notice that when Holmes looks at Watson this time, Watson beams admiringly, and when the men walk together to consult with the Met team that will be searching the wharves (on overtime, God help Lestrade if Holmes is wrong), they're shoulder-to-shoulder and leaning towards each other. That's good, then. He wonders how they did it, how they found their way back to each other when they'd been so far apart with no dog to lead the way.
Robbie wasn't currently on the Dog Unit (or the Dog Squad, as they called themselves, never mind the bloody public relations). He'd transferred back onto the street eight months ago, after some lowlife piece of shit hiding a meth lab had set a bear trap under snow and Casey'd lost the lower half of his leg and been retired.
"Shut up. How do you know what a dahlia is, anyway?" John smacked the kettle down on the hob. He needed tea and a shower. Bits of hair had worked down the neck of his jumper and he itched like a bastard. That barber—no, no, no, don't think about the haircut, don't think about the haircut, Sherlock will
"Then at least we go together." He knew his therapist would be horrified at that and it wasn't the least bit healthy, but it was true and right and comforting, and Sherlock at last came and leaned his head against John's.
John, at the Swan and Badger. A young man at his shoulder, late twenties, feature writer for a travel magazine, doing well for himself. They'd met at the pub a few times before, chatted, shared rounds, played darts.
“Impertinent. Yes, indeed. Spanked for it many a time and not yet cured, I’m sorry to say. Only try it, Mr Holmes, some afternoon or evening when you are quite out of human earshot, here on the top field. They tell me that you should dance for your nest-mate, with whom you once shared a corner of a great brick barn in a village without enough flowers to go round.  They met him once, and he is good for you. You are like the solitary bee who cleaves to other solitaries: needing and yet not needing, not as they need each other. They do not really understand friendship, though I have done my best to explain. Perhaps you will do better, having a better model.”
"We have not yet exhausted the other end of the transaction, Watson. Consider motive, for one. I knew a man once so incensed by ornament that he banished it not only from his own house but from those of his tenants, his place of business and at last was caught attempting to remove a Sanderson Chinese wall-paper from the dining room of the East India Club. At which point he was smartly conveyed to a private asylum."
I gave him just enough room inside the ridiculous, fascinating garment to stop him fainting, for it would never do to waste the least conscious moment of this. Under the hem of his skirts I took off boots and stockings but left the rest. All the while his face was hidden amongst the cushions and he was silent in that ever-watchful way of his – listening, deducing, waiting for the criminal to show his hand. Waiting for danger.
He blustered, laughed in our faces, called us deluded by our own fame, making up some story to go with the pantomime performance, said he had  not the least idea what I meant.
He lifted his eyes to me and there was no mercy in them for the culprit. Poison, like deceit and betrayal, offended him especially. Human relations, which he understood as few men I have known, rarely shocked him with their failings. It made him seem cold in first light, but the more I knew him the more I glimpsed the banked fires of his spirit. He was not shocked, but he would not accept the ways of the world. He burned to see right done, to know of promises kept and family ties honoured, and to bring those who offended to justice.
"No, Mr Holmes, I don't believe I shall," said Miss Kitty Winter, the sparkle of success making her bold. She and her patroness – and friend - had made the journey together to Canonbury and spent an entire afternoon with Mrs Brace. What transpired there I was indeed never told, save for arch hints at the secrets of womankind that I could not hope to unravel, for all my airs. I did gather that something about the both of them going together, they who had saved each other in their own hour of need, had swayed her. At any rate, the attacks stopped. Inspector Portmore gained the credit and Constable Butterworth a promotion. Officers come and go, but the ways of the Metropolitan Police stay precisely the same.
“If crime is common, hypocrisy is well-nigh universal, it seems. I, too have been guilty. I allowed your little fictions to go unchecked, until they became a reputation that shielded me so well, I did not mind that it hemmed me in as well.”
This was all delivered in the driest of tones, more obliterating than any bomb. It might have shrivelled the jungles of Sumatra.
Another case which will never appear in The Strand. Without Sherlock Holmes, we might, instead of rejoicing at a Jubilee, have been mourning a Prince murdered by anarchists as he presided at the opening of that tunnel.  I would not give England’s enemies encouragement by admitting in print what a very close call it was.
We sped through London’s bustling traffic to Bayswater, where Holmes negotiated our way into the house on the back of some breath-taking falsehoods and proceeded to strip the sickroom of everything that took his fancy. A  large piece of wallpaper which he removed with a pen-knife was subjected to the most intense inspection, then folded and slipped into his silver cigarette case (‘SH from JHW, 1887’) to be taken away with his other trophies for a closer look.
Yet so far everything I had was circumstantial.  Those breathless introductions in the stories; the unusual sympathy he extended to victims of blackmail (nine of out ten who came to us were inverts either confessed or deduced); the latitude I had observed in his reading: none of it weighed enough in the scale. None of it was worth a tenth of what a minute's honest conversation could have offered me. And all I believed I knew was that he
We both stood staring, open-mouthed, until Holmes remembered his knightly duty and thanked the lady, our sovereign, with some of those potent turns of phrase which he could apparently pull out of a pocket at a moment’s notice. And I am supposed to be the wordsmith.
He had risen that Sunday morning in a fit of nervous energy more like the hungry young detective of our youth than any mood I had seen in him for some months. Latterly, he refused more cases than he took - declaring once that if he was no longer in want of bread and cheese (certainly true, once the generosity of the Duke of Holdernesse had been carefully invested), what point using his talents for any but the most complex, the most arcane of problems?
The great procession of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee had come and gone. Old Tom followed behind, gathering up the leavings with brush and cart just as he had even before Holmes and I had come to Baker Street. He never grew older, so far as one could tell, only ever more silent, until the day he did not come out at dusk and we knew he had no more to say to anyone.
, for example,” he went on, “is expressly designed to flatter me. I am its subject, and its intended audience.”
I wished I could speak of even queerer ones. Was it my imagination - so unused to an airing - that despite his protest Watson was in fact distinctly interested in the idea of…byways?
In one half-excited, half-scandalised breath the deed was done, and she had surely repeated something like it to everyone who had come in before me. If the local public house was the chief centre for country gossip, the post office was surely the other.
I profess no religion and never have, but there were days back then when I longed for a confessor – anyone to know my thoughts but the one man who needed to. To convict in a criminal case the evidence must be beyond reasonable doubt. Contemplation of a crime, most particularly planning a joint enterprise in breaking the law, surely needs no less?
“Yes.” She flushed, angry yet refusing to be humiliated. “Oh, they want the land. Certainly they do. Demand for building materials remains high as the population, in enthusiastic defiance of Mr Malthus, continues to grow. They want the land and the clay underneath it, and would pay for it if they cannot get it by other means. Yet if it were only a matter of money. Money can, given time, economy and toil, be recovered. If it were simply about the gossip, the sneers, well: pride is a snare and reputation a fiction written on sand. I do not care for novels. What is intolerable is that they will not
Indeed.  Now I come to think of it, the “someone” who had kicked the pot under Sherlock Holmes’ bed in his haste to get into the aforesaid bed, had probably been wearing steel-capped shoes.
outright on account they know you won't be listening when they do. There's enough trade to go round, never fear. It's a... growing market." She grinned. Butterworth smiled wanly back.
I could have railed, could have asked him why he did not tell me before now, why he insisted on keeping his cards close to his chest even with me, one who would see and guard his every hand and partner him at what table he willed. What use? It was his nature: a nature I loved and still love in all its angles, acute and obtuse.
"Those were your goodbyes, then? I had not known you had so many…friends. And one a woman, of all creatures."
The distinct note of promise, of persuasion, brought me quickly to his side. He had been reading a very dry-looking tome for hours, something to do with the law of evidence, and I had resigned myself to another night alone. We had these dry spells, whole stretches of days in which try as I might he could not be moved to tenderness, let alone passion, by any wiles I possess – and I pride myself on having my fair share.
"I have some small resources of my own, inherited from my late mother. In the wake of last year's…misadventure, I took advice and determined to prosper by doing good. One of my investments is a shop at the east end of Oxford Street. In just a few months it has become *the* place for the woman of fashion to buy her hair for the season, for balls and parties, tours of Europe,  her trousseau - a hundred occasions."
damnably close and hot, that particular August day) or – one must state plain facts – downright tetchy.
Inductive, if not deductive, logic, led me to expect another detour and so it was. Holmes darted into an alley beside a chandler’s store not a hundred yards from Manze’s. Of all things, a young woman was waiting for us: thin, delicate featured, dressed in an assortment of hand-me-downs too large for her and a man’s flat cap. Yet cheerful enough, she appeared to be taking stock of the great coils of rope, vats of tar and pots of varnish under tarpaulins in the back yard. A heavy key marked her place in the ledger, and it was this key she gave up to Holmes, who thanked her gravely and by name, unlocked a cellar whose hatch was hard up against the back of the shop, and jumped down into the dim interior with a "stay there will you, John?". The girl Maisie beamed at this and at me. Whether a co-conspirator, or merely amused for her own reasons, I could not tell. She did giggle as Holmes emerged, smut-stained yet dignified, from the coal hole, brushing off his coat with his hands, spreading the smuts onto his cuffs in the process.
“Indeed. The clay was there before any of us, before humankind, before the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. From Dorsetshire it comes near the surface across a swathe of Oxfordshire and Bedfordshire, east to the Fenlands, north as far as Yorkshire. Fine white and yellow clay, and from it the finest and most decorative house-bricks are made in their millions. Have you ever seen a brick clamp ready for firing, gentlemen? A Ziggurat of ingenuity and earth, clay and coal in precisely calculated amounts, even down to a percentage of cinder in the green brick. Once touched with fire, it glows from within as the firefly makes its own light. You are surprised, Mr Holmes. You took me for a Luddite, a Blake, wishing that England were an eternal a pastoral fantasy in which to wander. ”
I pressed the blade flat, feather-light against the nape of his neck. Powder and sweat mixed slick there, the scent of violets over the reek of sex on his skin. Crushed mother-of-pearl gleamed in the stuttering gaslight, scattered in the powder until it faded to nature scarcely less white and no less fine. There was a blue shadow under his jaw and no-one would think him woman now. Within the skirts – God, fumbling in the folds of velvet I found his thigh and squeezed, found his arse and knew he’d gone out like that, cock-and-balls-bare under a dress.
Mary’s and my journey turned out to be a stopping train and our destination, entirely earthbound. She is gone now and I will not break confidence too far with her dear shade, but without a mother she was sorely unprepared. To be lover and teacher both is to make a poor show of one or other of them and we never quite got over the strain of those stumbling early lessons in adding one upon one. Add to that my still-divided heart and you arrive at the reason, I think, why multiplication in the end escaped us. Mary wished to please me, never had to be persuaded – only to be asked, but when asking feels like imposition, one soon stops asking very often.
