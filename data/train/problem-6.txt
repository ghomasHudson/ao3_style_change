, he had grinned to himself as he had brought up the surveillance a pp on his laptop. The grin was wiped firmly off his face when he'd realised that the feed from the camera he had placed inside the skull on the mantle had gone dark. His eyes had gone to the image from the camera placed above the refrigerator and he had just been able to make out, in the bottom left hand corner,
John's surgery is already done; he had texted Sherlock before and after the procedure which had been done under a spinal block. A nerve block meant that he had watched the whole thing on the same arthroscope screen as Laura. Sherlock had called him after his second text and John had given him a recap, saying that he'd felt fine apart from the moment when Laura Arthur had taken a shaver to smooth out the scraggy part of his medial meniscus where a bit had torn itself off. The sight had made him a bit queasy though he had handled the anaesthesia for plenty of similar cases. "I knew it's different when it's me on the table," John had said on the phone, "but I thought that since it would be a lot less dramatic than my shoulder…"
"That's not the point, Sherlock. I'm talking about boundaries. We need to set some. Taking my laptop, taking my
He sees a smile blossom on the face of Jim Moriarty, who mutters in a voice just loud enough to be heard, "that's my boy."
The black and white footage opens on a figure he instantly recognises—Sherlock Holmes—standing on the balcony outside the living room.
"Sorry, Doctor Watson; we're a few minutes later than I thought we would be." Philippe, the chalet's chauffeur service driver looks apologetic as he parks the SUV.
"I chose you, Seb. I've always known that Mycroft Holmes set you on me; it was rather fun at first to use you to feed him whatever disinformation I wanted. My lovely spy… You do know that I've done my very best to further your career in the service. Even to the point of being willing to let you go off and do your thing in Afghanistan after Eton. All part of your cover."
Short and to the point, the message clear and inescapable — Sherlock has gone to this death, and John is the one who let him go.
Hands are reaching in now, widening the hole, and Branger's face comes back into focus. "Holmes, I have to leave you now, but the others will get you out. We need to find Pavel."
people there—a creepy Japanese guy with a grey ponytail who never says a word and then some woman who organises the cleaning and does the cooking when he's there, which isn't often, to be honest."
The wallpaper looks bare somehow, the smiley face is accusing you of all the things you failed to do: to keep him tethered to this world, to help him believe that being the World's Only Consulting Detective didn't mean he had to solve Moriarty's puzzles. You failed him in that. Didn't give him enough reason to resist the temptation. And when his reputation had been destroyed, cases stripped from him, when it came down to what you could tell him from your position on the street, looking up at the lonely figure on the parapet of the hospital roof, your words failed him then, too.
The fluorescent lights in the station foyer are harsh where we have gathered before the closed iron gates. It's warm here; I open the zipper of my jacket and remove my thin merino wool hat, shoving it into the helmet dangling from the crook of my elbow.
He pulls in a sharp breath through his nose and then blows the breath out again through his mouth. “I saw him,” he whispers.
Sherlock doesn't know. He had reacted without much consideration of the consequences of his words, but why is he the one being called out on the things he says?
The bristles on the back of John’s neck had to have been practically visible as he'd stormed out of the kitchen to stand beside Sherlock’s chair. Sherlock hadn’t flinched, standing (or rather sitting) his ground, fingers steepled under his chin, daring him it seemed, to go further. Belatedly realising that he was practically looming over the man, John had taken a breath and a step backwards to sit down in his own chair.  John had sat there for a few minutes, getting himself under control while Sherlock had simply closed his eyes, shutting him out.
That fact seems to lift an enormous weight off Sherlock's shoulders, just as the waltz ends. He doesn't release John, however. "Another?"
“Oh,” John had responded with a tight smile, his anger dangerously controlled as he looked Sherlock’s way for the first time. “We have quite a lot to catch up on.”
"Lestrade, we need you and your car to get us to Barts as quick as you can and then on to Heathrow. Molly's working on the body of the Google employee who called in sick, the one whose access card let Moran into the building. Turns out the police found him dead in his flat wrapped in a Semtex jacket, wired to go off at noon. The bomb squad defused it and sent the body to her for examination. She says another message has been left, but can't explain what it means. So, off you go, John and get packed; we're on a tight schedule."
John looks a bit startled, his gaze shifting to the telly, probably wondering why such an inane conversation is taking the place of whatever mindless crap was passing for his evening entertainment.
Sherlock finishes his coffee and puts the mug down. "The idea of having earmarked time each week for research is appealing."
The doubling up had given him enough of a boost to work out the timeline. Mycroft's trips to Tbilisi started in the summer when he was eighteen. Sherlock was under house arrest, waiting to go up to Cambridge University. Then there'd been a long trip through the Caucasus region during his second year at Trinity College, while he'd been busy with Victor.
“That lovely Ms Hooper came round while you were out yesterday,” she places the flowers, now resting in a couple of earthenware jars that John is pretty sure once held human remains (
Just as John is about to start typing up a text, the lift doors open and Sherlock walks out. Instead of a suit, he's wearing black jeans and a white dress shirt neatly tucked in under a burgundy cardigan. His coat is unbuttoned, and he hasn't worn a scarf. There are dark shadows under his eyes and his pallor signals the same: exhaustion, insomnia, worry.
"My line of work can be quite profitable. I haven't bothered because I don't need the income. That could change."
Drugs make him randy, an unfortunate consequence of stimulation, and yet another reason to avoid being anywhere near John. The light in Victor's eyes is going out, replaced by the sad expression that had been on his face when Sherlock had told him the lies that he didn't love him and that he never had loved him*.
Instead he mutters, “Nothing,” knowing he sounds somewhat defensive. He doesn't care, still feeling a bit bruised about how Jim is treating him. “You shut me out remember?”
Patricia Dahl, a thirty-eight-year-old great grand-daughter of Roald Dahl, is currently being chatted up by the American doctor who had been the leader of the team that had failed to get the new smart shunt design project off the ground. With his peripheral vision, Sherlock can see the man ogling Miss Dahl's breasts. He can't help but overhear their discussion because the middle-aged doctor's voice is nasal and pitched at a loudspeaker volume that Americans seem to have hard-wired into their system. The man is one of those pontificators that Sherlock has come to detest — full of himself, utterly convinced that the project should have stayed on "our side of the Atlantic instead of mired in the mess of the NHS". Nothing in the man's blatant boasting is acknowledging the fact that the project has been relocated because his leadership had failed to get it off the ground. Sherlock has no idea why the Steadman European head Dirk van Hoek had invited the man, Charles Macdonald to this event. If Sherlock had been in his position, he would have stayed at home, embarrassed of his failure.
“Look, spare me the big brother concern. Sherlock and I have decided that it is for the best that we um … no longer … that is to say we have ... parted company.”
As the helicopter lifts, the patrolman asks me if I knew his name and I have to admit that I do not, but I think I may be able to help him find out. We both ski to the cable car station, in the hope of finding the poor bugger's friends.
Sebastian's worries about what is going to happen to him later are pushed aside as he realises the scale of what Jim has done. The news sites are going absolutely
This is not possible. It is not your physical injuries that concern me. My other colleagues here have attended to those. I am here to assess the
Sherlock suspects that John is still as cranky as he had been that morning. He is back at work after two days off due to high fever, taking antibiotics for his fourth tonsillitis in two years. John appears to have become a mostly asymptomatic carrier of the causative bacteria after contracting it from some teenager he'd gassed for a peritonsillar abscess surgery. He refuses to hear it when Sherlock tries to point out that he fulfils the criteria for an elective tonsillectomy.
Young Carlton practically jumps sideways at the snarl, knocking into the side table, wobbling the glass of water and causing some of the contents to slosh over the side and onto the linen napkin underneath. The stain spreads rapidly along with his mortification.
Mycroft flicks the first bit of ash from the end of his cigarette into the fire. "A person should know when they’ve been beaten. If I take the punishment that Moriarty clearly wants me to, then perhaps it will be enough."
, is the only word that comes to John’s mind. He feels it in his bones, the rise and fall of agony and anguish as in his mind's eye he sees bow hairs drift back and forth, rosin catching along the strings. Climbing the stairs, John wants to stay out of sight, but he just can’t help himself. He watches from the landing as Sherlock, facing the window, dressing gown over his pyjamas, sways back and forth with the music.
" She types something quickly, then frowns while making a few mouse clicks. She then reaches over to the printer beside the desk and hands over a printed badge. "There is tape that will peel off; please wear it." She points to the doors. "Through there and turn right. Count six cubicles, he will be on the left."
Sherlock senses, rather than sees, John stand up from his chair. And then there are hands on him, pulling him to his feet, slipping around his waist. John steps into his line of view and he’s smiling, the daft bugger.
Lestrade storms out. The front door onto the street slams so hard that it rattles the window above it.
"Do you think he'll ski again?" Mycroft looks at his glass thoughtfully. "I suppose that, after a frightful experience, he might want to get back to it promptly. Not with his injuries, of course, but… perhaps in the spring."
“No,” John replies leaning into it a bit more, the metal biting into the thin skin covering Moran’s skull, “Fuck you. Just making sure that you don't interfere in what's going on out there.”
He has no destination in mind, but the first step is to gather his things. He starts a pile on the landing, and then heads into the bathroom. He takes his toothbrush, shampoo, soap, razor and shaving foam, trying to ignore the aromas of Sherlock's posh products. Somehow the peaty tang of the next glass of whisky masks the scent memories of waking up with his nose next to a certain head of dark curls. He decides to leave the (his) emergency medical kit where it sits under the sink — no doubt Sherlock will need it, although who the hell will patch up Sherlock in the future? Will the impulsive madman resort to dragging the needle through his own skin rather than subject himself to the (
Mycroft stops in his tracks. "This is about protecting the country, Sherlock, and our allies, not to mention the millions of people who use the airlines every day—not just as passengers but as consumers of the goods that travel by plane. He cannot be allowed to hold the countries to ransom. Rather than hypothesising personal motives, you really need to focus on what you think the three o'clock threat is going to be and when it is going to take place. We need to anticipate his next move."
As she moves off, crying child on one hip and pushing the baby with the other, Sherlock considers the situation. At least the seven-year gap between him and Mycroft had been easier to manage for his parents. With a smirk, he realises that he and John could do with an au pair, too, if they truly are such a help around the house and with guaranteeing their employers a respite. That, combined with thinking about his own mother who always did everything herself, makes him remember the Christmas gift from her a year and a half ago.
Sherlock seems to ignore the whole diatribe of great excitement. He crosses his arms and leans a hip against his own armchair. John can tell he's too high-strung by this meeting to sit down.
There is also that fact that Lestrade doesn't mince his words in John's presence, and at times it's been the two of them against Sherlock. It's about time Sherlock had some backup of his own.
"Maybe we could come up with something as far as possible from tedious to do tonight. It's been a while, you know?"
"---people never appreciate esters; they think they're just for flavouring foul confectionary when in actuality phosphoesters are the backbone of DNA molecules. Besides, I’ve always found especially the banana-like esters to be olfactorily too close to the mercaptopurine group---"
"Steadman and Dahl want a smart shunt bad enough that they'll throw anything at him to get him to say yes," John concluded. "Sherlock says there are some rumours about Steadman's prior design team's efforts having imploded."
"It's a good quality example of polished India Jet Black granite. Resell value should be around eighty percent of original price—enough to pay for the materials, if not the labour of your re-decoration. Lots of not very prosperous families would be glad of a lower cost on a tomb stone. You could try Ebay."
There is only one mental health professional Sherlock has voluntarily confided in, and that was after a long period of hemming and hawing, testing and challenging her, and that person — Doctor Joanna Pichler — still occasionally has to work hard to gain his trust.
Behind them as they walk, there is the sound of a commotion, and both he and Moriarty turn their heads to see that Moran is now kneeling on the grass, his hands out by his side, and John's gun to his head. Sherlock clarifies, "Just ensuring your man doesn't get any ideas."
Note on the 31st March 2020: after this story finished posting, the Covid epidemic hit, and J. Baillier penned a short story which is not part of the official time line of the series, but takes place in this AU. It's called
He panics, desperately trying to figure out some way to reverse this. He knows he needs to say something, do something but he’s frozen, at a loss. Time continues to pass, swirling, stilling around them both as they stand there across from each other. In the end, some long, slow seconds later, it’s John who breaks first, unfolding his arms and making a move towards the door of the flat. Without conscious intention, Sherlock’s hand snakes out to grasp at John’s forearm.
If the plan, with all that ‘it’s not going to help’ bullshit, had been to deter John from his self-appointed mission of locating Sherlock’s body, Mycroft had well and truly missed the mark. Now John is even more determined than ever to see this through. Whatever tempering had taken place as a result of his arrest, has been incinerated by the white heat of anger.
That's why Violet worries about the new job: for at least two days a week, John's not there. At least Stella Wolfson, who she had called last week, had been able to put her mind at ease: the work at GOSH seems to be going well. Violet wonders whether Sherlock will ever volunteer any information about it, perhaps realising that when he'd shown her the video of the surgery, it had helped her understand more about him. She hopes so.
With the faintest of smiles she leafed through the pages of her notebook until she found a strip of paper. She pushed it across the table to him: mass-produced wisdom from a fortune cookie.
When they had arrived at Baker Street, she had turned off the engine and stepped out onto the pavement with him.
Mycroft’s face contorted into something resembling a genuine smile, though it looked as though it pained him.
As they slow down to a red light, he leans forward and knocks on the plexiglass separating them from the driver. The intercom crackles to life, and before the driver has a chance to inquire what he's got on his mind, Sherlock instructs him to stop at the next possible place that might sell cigarettes.
case with your name attached is going to end up with us in court and a criminal going scot-free. Talk about wasting police time … the money spent investigating your death, the inquest. Christ on a bleeding crutch, Sherlock! Whatever possessed you?"
They approach Moran, who is sitting on the grass, having pulled the body into a clumsy embrace, Jim's bloodied head in his lap. He is stroking the dark hair, and in the failing light, Sherlock can see the tracks of tears on Sebastian's face. The sniper doesn't acknowledge their presence, lost in his grief.
He pulls out the foil containers: it’s Sherlock’s favourite, Cha Sui Bao— barbecued pork buns with a sweet chili dipping sauce. There's John's favourite, too: Moo Goo Gai Pan, in a foil wrapped triangular package. There are also fried sesame balls and a hot and sour soup, some dumplings, and fried rice.  Nothing dramatic or out of the ordinary. He puts the pork buns on a plate and into the microwave to heat up.
on eight. Do it now with Masha; I clap. Each clap, you step. No clap, you shout out 'pause' to me. Okay?"
"There's really no excuse anymore." Mrs Hudson is standing there with one hand on her hip and the other is holding the ostrich feather duster as if she is brandishing a weapon at you. "This place needs a good clean, John. I understand if you're not feeling up to it, but I need to do it to protect the furniture. Left too long, it gets into the wax and dulls the finish."
There is a pause, which Sherlock assumes is Lestrade using his browser to translate the Latin. When no new text appears, he resumes.
He doesn't need Sherlock to tell him that the video and the audio have been published without the approval of the air accident investigators. Someone is ramping the whole thing up to maximum volume.
to enjoy them," Sherlock snaps in a tone he realises too late is accusatory. He regrets the outburst; Edgar is working tonight at his behest, and it's none of Sherlock's business what the young man does or doesn't enjoy. "Thank you for the… non-existing phone call. You were attentive. That is appreciated."
"So, no prior warning from him about Moriarty's plans? I mean, how the hell can this guy hack into the Air Traffic Control systems on both sides of the Atlantic? Are you really sure it's him and not some state-sponsored hackers like the Russians or North Koreans?"
"I already apologised for being pissed off at him at the hospital." In a crisis, Sherlock's solution is either burying himself in work or behaving like a five-year-old. "Whether he'll ski again is hardly the most pressing point. Right now, he needs to talk to me about what happened. For his sake more than mine."
"That detective fellow. Don't cha remember 'im? 'E's the one that stopped that bomb under Parliament."
She counts them out for him. When they're over, he draws a breath and coughs, heartbeat whooshing in his ears.
"Of course not. The PM is already going to have my head on a block. I can't expect the other service chiefs to back me again. They'll do what anyone would do in their circumstances—blame me and run for cover."
The walls of Baker Street start cracking, crumbling, falling down around them as Sherlock keeps holding his head and John keeps screaming the ugly words.
You wake with a start when the alarm rings. As your eyes blink open, the thought that this is another early day shift at the surgery pumps a bit of adrenaline, enough to make you sit up. It's then that you realise something odd about the light in the room. Despite the curtains being closed, it's surprisingly bright in the room, making you wonder if you've somehow overslept.
At that her brows lifted, but she let him talk, giving no sign she wanted to interrupt or opine. Rare quality, that. He didn’t have it himself. But then, he usually knew how people would finish their sentences, and grew impatient waiting for them to catch up with him.
"I asked him about what was going on, what had happened the previous night with Moriarty and what he was planning to do next."
"And how do you feel about accepting that help? We discussed earlier how important it was for you to succeed on your own."
When he opens them again, John is hovering by the door. “I'll just be downstairs in the living room,” he says quietly, "if you need me."
There's no way for John to stay at home to look after him, though. He's got too much on at the moment, and there is no possible cover available. John goes to the sitting room and drops into his chair, mobile in hand.
To my surprise, and relief, it has to be said, cross-country technique is completely different from what I've been doing the past two days. "Nordic skiing" as the instructor, Marie Rochat calls it, "is more like an exaggerated walk. You use arm and leg motion in opposition to drive yourself forward." She says there is another, more modern technique that looks a bit like speed skating on skis, but it would require different kind of equipment. I'm fine with tradition.
As a rule, Sherlock doesn't use profanities. That fact that he's doing it now tells me all I need to know about how
Sherlock hums. "You hate him, then. Pity, really. I thought he seemed quite competent." Sherlock grabs his phone.
Sherlock's heart sinks. Could Violet have been so crass as to go to Stella to try to get her to convince him to help with her meagre, misguided charity work? She had tried to twist his arm about it several times to no avail, and that wretched conversation at Christmas a year and a half ago had been the final straw. He'd given her a piece of his mind regarding how well he thinks she is suited to helping families with special needs children. She hasn't brought it up since.
The momentary pain serves only to cut the slightest of swathes through the caffeine, nicotine and stress hormones that seem to be substituting for his real blood these days. Within seconds the brief respite fades, replaced again by the thrum of anxiety that has become the background noise in his head, his constant companion.
“Two years…” He breathed, the words tight in an even tighter throat. “Two years. You let me gr— you let me belie—.” Sherlock’s lips were pressed together and he nodded, his eyes wide.
She had considered the question for a moment before shrugging. “The usual. Went to therapy. Wrote about it. It was sort of weird; writing it down made it feel real. I wrote to his family, told them that I would keep his memory alive, keep doing what he'd loved doing. It took a while, but in the end, it seemed to help.”
John looks at her, digesting the implications of living in a place that was not regulated. Maybe that's exactly why the rent is affordable for someone on his pension and meagre salary. "Money laundering? I thought your ex was a murderer?" Sherlock had implied as much on their very first meeting at the flat.
"Sebbie…" Jim's reflection appears behind him, wearing a smirk which dissolves into an expression of wide-eyed, faux concern. "Oh dear, did diddums get a bit of a bwuise?"
He can understand the doctor's motivations; after all, he'd been Holmes' pet and pets pine when their masters die. The thought makes Sebastian even more annoyed with himself.
to smile, to sit still, to do something that people would do in a photograph. He was so… resistant and disengaged."
Maybe he did, but John is nowhere near saying it has 'worked out'. He turns the questions over in his mind and finds he doesn’t even have to lie when he answers.
"You're spoiling me. Let me return the favour," I offer, and not just out of husbandly duty. I will never get tired of watching his enjoyment of what I'm doing to him, really focusing on him and relishing that fact that he's never let anyone see him like this.
Sherlock is looking thoughtful. "Joanna wanted to know whether I had talked to my family about the decision. I told her that you are the only one whose opinion I value. My mother, father and brother would all be arguing against me trying to do this."
The apology seems strikingly out of place to Sherlock’s ears in light of what Moran has already done to him and the sweeping strokes the man starts to make carving the next letter. With endorphins fighting for space with his depleted opioid receptors, there is no mercy from the pain as Moran carves the letter ‘O’. Sherlock knows now that he’s found the hell he has been looking for. Maybe, if his luck holds out, he will die before John even thinks about turning up. He can only hope that whoever does his autopsy is as good as Molly Hooper is so the time of death will give John the alibi he needs.
A type of Latin American dance music incorporating elements of jazz and rock. In Latin American cooking, salsa is a spicy tomato sauce. In street talk, salsa is a musical way to get a good looking girl's clothes off.
She'd been right, but not in the way she'd thought back then. The whole damned world seems to be standing around Sherlock's dead body, and he is the one who put it there.
Sherlock slides under the duvet just as John is drifting off some half an hour later. Instead of a book or journal, John's annoyed to see he's brought his tablet. Soon, the crease between Sherlock's brows reappears in the light cast by the tablet, and he starts typing furiously once again.
“You did,” she agreed, “a bit like a shark. Sharp and full of teeth and ready to bite any hand that came close, even the friendly ones.”
, Sherlock thinks and instantly catches himself for making exactly the same sorts of assumptions that people have always made about him.
Sebastian paces the living room. Finding a contractor willing to come in on Christmas Eve had not been easy and he's had to pay through the nose to get it done. But no way is he going to sit out the holidays in the freezing cold. The temperature in the flat has plummeted, but at least the open-to-the-air circulation means that the lingering scent of smoke is gone. The glass has been hoovered up, the crumpled frame removed, and the contractor is now shaking his head. "Mate, the best I can do for now is to board it up."
Sherlock watches from the window as John exits the flat, shoulders his way through the journalists, keeping his eyes down and refusing to react to their barked questions.  Sherlock turns away, dropping disconsolately onto the sofa, then sits there playing with his phone. He can't go out; refuses to be doorstepped by the journalists. Mrs. Hudson comes up, exasperated by the doorbell being continually rung and the knocker being smacked against the wood.
The scene itself is quite surreal. The log fire smoulders in the grate at John’s back and a half-empty bottle of Dom Perignon sits in a bucket of melted ice on the side table. One empty champagne glass sits atop the mantlepiece and the other rests on the table. A celebration? The suit jacket and tie slung casually over the back of the sofa suggest a scene of relaxation. But the current state of the man speaks directly of the opposite. John’s gaze flickers between the two Holmes’ and then go back to the corpse, his attention caught by the engraving on the handle of the knife in the man’s limp hand.
John pauses where he is, halfway across Sherlock’s lap and shakes his head, biting back bright tears. “It’s really not.”
John puts his chopsticks down and takes a swig of Tsing Tao beer. "Tell me what happened. You've not said a word about the board meeting, so out with it, now," he prompts gently.
Mycroft scowls at him, but there is a flicker of amusement in his gaze. Then he gets serious. Sitting up straighter in his chair, Mycroft reports. “We have another problem.”
being said what's going on. I'm not being dependent — I'm being realistic and getting professional help. I'm outsourcing those aspects of this project which are not within the realm of my expertise."
Opening a door marked Staff Only, she leads Mary down a poorly lit hall. The soundproofing is less evident here, and the music from the studio bleeds through the wall. She and then turns left, stopping in front of a wooden shutter on the left wall. "This is far enough."
He doesn't like travelling alone. He doesn't like doing things without John. That thought, together with his husband's misdirected ire, is making him feel wrong-footed. "Pour one for me, too."
Two days ago, however, she had received a call from the Holmes matriarch inquiring whether that offer still stood. Violet stated dismissively that she wasn't entirely sure the timetable would allow it, but that she was planning to spend a few days in London in a few weeks and might be able to fit it in. Joanna wondered what had happened to change her mind — or perhaps she had just needed time to think about this. She makes a mental note to ask Sherlock about that after Violet has visited the group.
She met John’s gaze as he shifted his attention back to her. He wasn’t smiling, but his expression had a kind of openness it hadn’t a moment before.
She clears her throat. "Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is timely that we took a break. Session will resume in twenty minutes."
He'd give anything to be able to do that now, but the place is devoid of everything and everyone that he had wanted to find there. His eyes keep roving around, trying to find some tell-tale clue, some piece of evidence that would have meaning only to him and Sherlock, something to cling to that would say all of what has happened is a charade.
"You dislike his more extreme hobbies. Perhaps he fears you will use this incident to dissuade him from ever skiing again, and that he doesn't have any good counter-arguments."
"Doctor Watson! I have warned you that this is not the time or place to make accusations. Please step down from the witness stand."
The brass end is savagely pulled out, making Sebastian flinch and cry out. His face is pushed into the pillow. With no lube, no warning, Jim plunges his cock straight in, making Sebastian shout into the pillow.
“You caught me. Can’t get anything past you, can I? Not even a romantic evening for the… the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
"You wouldn't allow a psychiatrist such as myself to pick up a scalpel and operate on a brain tumour, would you?"
Dressed in the suit Jim had insisted he wear to the inquest—camouflage to blend in with the uptight corporate types that make The Shard their home away from home, Sebastian casually eyes the white marble reception desk. The minimalist lines of the lobby and its infinite number of sightlines makes any attempt to gain unauthorised access to one of the Shard's thirty-six lifts difficult. According to the floorplans he'd researched, the hotel reception area on the thirty fourth floor controls access to all the rooms between there and the fifty fourth floor. No one from the rest of the building's occupants can get one of the lifts to stop.
"Greg, don't … just don’t. I don't know how to fix this yet, and I'm sure as hell not going to let him use this as an excuse to avoid dealing with the fallout from what's happened. I can't pretend that things haven't changed. They have, at least for me. If you've got any advice on how to get him to stop playing games, I'm all ears."
“Nah, dey're a lettle too 'igh and mighty fahr de likes o' de cahmmon fahlk like me, what wit deir fancy pahnies and dahgs.”
"That's true. I'm not interested in any of the position being recruited for through public adverts."
Sherlock knows he should inquire about John's leg and general wellbeing, but it must be the residual whisky which leads him to launch straight into recounting the incident at the dinner table.
Anthea is looking at him in surprise. "Are you sure? Shouldn't we give more warning the first time you visit?"
It's the reason he finds himself standing out in the early morning drizzle waiting for Gerry to answer his knock at the side door wearing attire that is decidedly not his usual, but appropriate for the circumstances. Black Northface clothing — a mountain futurelight jacket over exploration trousers — a brand choice that will establish him as a well-heeled recreational kayaking fanatic. At the sound of someone approaching on the other side of the door and the key turning in the lock, he takes a breath and assumes the persona.
John casts his gaze over the expanse of cowpat-infested countryside and huffs a little laugh. Unless he is planning to commandeer a hay-laden tractor-trailer and drive all the way to Galway at ten miles an hour, he really doesn’t have much choice.
His brother’s voice has the level of smugness it gets only when he is sitting behind (formerly) Uncle Rudy's art deco chestnut desk in his office in the bowels of The Diogenes Club, playing God with the world with the Queen looking over his shoulder. Sherlock sniffs. Apparently, it hasn't taken long for Mycroft to fall back into favour of the powers that be, once Sherlock had solved all his problems for him, that is.
“You do know that this place isn’t Victoria Station, it isn’t just open 24/7 for your convenience? “The staff are beginning to wonder whether you have taken up permanent residence.”
He curses the fact that he has not researched this better. Maybe if he injects straight into his heart? He picks up the syringe, ignoring how his hands are shaking. Is it from the cold or because he's coming down from the drug?
Sherlock blinks, less than a second, and the John who was a moment ago smiling at him brightly is now slumped at his feet and there is Moran, standing right behind him, gun arm straight out holding a weapon. He didn’t hear the shot. Why didn’t he hear the shot?
Before pressing the engine start-up button of their BMW, he shoots off a text to the PA that he should be home before rush hour starts proper. He has no doubt that Sherlock has been well looked after, but still feels an early pull of home.
Sherlock knows where she works. Magnussen's office had been one of the first parts of his research. "It's within walking distance from your office; it shouldn't take you thirty minutes."
Sherlock’s on his back on his bed. Has been since John pushed him onto it to crawl up over him and hold him down. The slide of thigh against thigh, knee nudging, shins rubbing. Sherlock’s fingers trace tentative paths over Johns ribcage, smoothing up and down as John moves above him. Is he allowed this? He knows this body by heart — the body of the man he loves. But he’s not sure it's welcome.
Sherlock is tempted to shrug, giving physical expression to his ambiguity about the question.  At least Edgar doesn't seem to be judging him for his lack of reaction to the question.
I have to laugh again. "Just think of it as me wanting to appreciate the view. You can tell me all about your thrills of the day."
It's not like the man doesn't know how to find him. Mycroft's pulling up alongside him in his ridiculous car of his with his ridiculous henchmen, (well, Anthea is actually quite nice, but never mind that) to abduct him on a whim for a ‘chat’ more than demonstrates that he is able to reach out to John if and when he wants to. But he doesn’t want to. No. What Mycroft wants to do is sit back and watch his brother's name, Sherlock's legacy, be dragged through the mud. And he seems more than content in lending his own hand to that dragging, with his insinuations, his willingness to add fuel to the fire being stoked by Moriarty and the press.
"Play that thing you were practising last week. It's turned into an earworm I'd prefer to turn off before bed. Sometimes, it helps to hear the end of a song." John has no idea what Sherlock had been playing last week, and he couldn't hum the melody of any of the recently practised pieces if he tried but, as ruses go, Sherlock just might fall for this one.
Sherlock takes a moment to drown out the eardrum torture of the brass instruments being tuned before he can continue. "You know I have ASD. Autism spectrum disorder. You know this." The words and the abbreviation have always felt cold, metallic, distant to him. Not part of his usual vocabulary. They are something to be treated with care, with suspicion. It makes him feel awkward saying this to Edgar, as if he has to explain. "It was made clear to you on the very first day. Being on the Spectrum comes with communication deficits and a lack of social skills that is not wilful, but rather innate. I also have to endure Sensory Processing Disorder, which gets worse when I am anxious. And that makes my behaviour even more of a problem in social situations. It's a vicious circle." He isn't slurring his words yet, but the rhythm of his speech has slowed, become less precise.
My heartfelt thanks as always to the amazing beta-ing/pompom waving skills of @88thparallel (literally, pompoms!) - your feedback means the world to us.
He's in Morocco — Guerin’s place. It seems fitting that it would all would end right back at the beginning, in Marrakech, where his intimacy with both John and Moriarty had begun, Sherlock muses as he runs his fingers over the flocked crimson wallpaper, the ridges of his fingerprints catching in the raised velvet.
"A man can't be in two places at once. The Moriarty who was captured in a photo attending your Sandhurst Graduation wasn't the same Moriarty who was sitting his doctoral viva exam at Trinity College Cambridge at exactly the same time."
John makes his way back upstairs while mulling on the encounter. He once again finds himself thinking that Edgar's enthusiasm is oddly reminiscent of Sherlock's interest in medicine — it's just that, instead of concrete facts of science, Edgar seems to be fascinated by people above all.
In the safety of home twenty minutes later, Sherlock has managed to regain his composure and is able to fix himself some tea. As he waits for the kettle to boil, he chastises himself for not remembering to buy a ready-meal, given that John won't be home to cook their supper. When he'd put the milk away, Sherlock had surveyed the fridge and concluded that there wasn't much at all there — certainly nothing that would meet John's criteria of a sensible dinner. Sherlock wonders why John hadn't told him to buy something to eat in addition to acquiring milk.
The discarded mask and canister of Narcan are still lying on the bunker floor and in his current position, close to his left shoulder. Shuffling slightly over, he nudges them with his nose, pushing them forward. Then, bringing his cuffed hands down over his head, he uses the bloodied fingernails of his right hand to scrawl an abbreviated message in the bunker floor before tugging the canister and Narcan back over the marks. He’s hoping that whatever is on Moran’s to do list when he returns, housekeeping is not one of those things.
"Don't you start!" snarls the mother at her daughter and drags her back up the aisle as she howls in protest.
To his relief, she laughs. "Yeah, I can't see you at a singles night. And as for policewomen… it would be a bit like a busman's holiday."
The craving diminished, though not regularly or permanently. He might be walking through the London crowds, or sitting at the microscope, or just lying in bed, and it would come roaring back, clawing at his nerves and scorching through his blood vessels with an intensity almost undiminished.
Tentatively, I offer a potential explanation: "A neurosurgeon has to have mastery over his fine motor skills, to work with the precision needed. He clearly enjoys that, thinks of it as problem-solving."
"I might actually give a damn except I'm rather busy right now holding the world to ransom. Three little lines of code and I have brought the world's airlines to a standstill. Or has that news not reached you in your graveyard yet?"
happy here. He relaxes a bit to let it show. "I'm just asking for a bit of compromise, Sherlock. And a healthy dose of common sense."
"Everybody lies, John. It's vital to being a social animal. We are taught from an early age never to say what we really think."
"I didn't agree with all those therapists back in the day, you know. The approaches of some of them were quite… ruthless."
John suddenly laughs at the concept, shaking his head with a fond smile. Admittedly, a few days ago, he had been in a bad mood at home when Sherlock had given him nary a glance as he pored over tons of documentation connected to the Centre into the late hours. John had gone to bed and brooded for hours, thinking that if Sherlock had stayed full-time at King's that he'd have more of the man's attention when they got home.
"Nothing more, Love," John assures him. He can tell his husband is tired yet trying to be polite; coming from Sherlock of all people, John appreciates such effort and consideration greatly, which is why he's happy to let him off the hook.
A pager buzzes in Sherry's jacket pocket. "Uh oh. Got to go. My guests in the Southwark Suite want me."
"It isn't an open process; he gets first shot. Only if he turns it down will they go to competitive recruitment. And from what he's said, they're offering pretty much anything he wants in terms of people, budget, space. Very few people would say no," John points out.
. I need to check blood gases again to see if your gas exchange issues have resolved. You must also accept that you may not be thinking clearly. Avalanche victims almost always endure transient dizziness, fainting, and anxiety. If the idea of staying here is distressing you, then it could be a sign of this happening. To leave now is wrong. You must know this."
The man nods and disappears again into the back room. Sherlock takes up a seat at a desktop computer near the window and gets to work.
"The Charleston—it's usual practice in dance competitions to put some into a quickstep routine; after all, the dance is just a hybrid of Charleston and foxtrot."
“Curious. I am reasonably certain that dying on the Heath wasn’t in his plans that evening so either there wasn’t a network in the first place or Moran has taken care of it.”
John stares at the handwritten numbers on the note on the kitchen table sitting just to the right of his breakfast dishes. The note that was delivered inside Sherlock’s glove to Baker Street by Moran — the coordinates, he is sure, of where Sherlock is headed.
), at the hitherto unknown, nameless, faceless person who will come along and assume his place. The person who will get to know Sherlock’s body as well as he has. The person who will share late nights in front of crap telly amongst discarded takeout containers until the hour grows late and they head to bed ...
"Poetry?" You bark out a laugh. "Ridiculous. Dirty limericks and cockney rhyming slang are the only things that have ever stuck in my memory." You hated poetry in school, all those silly verses about daffodils. Ella is giving you a side-eye, a look that says she isn't convinced, so you try to explain. "I'm not one for pages and pages of useless stuff about wandering 'lonely as a cloud'."
“This is your first meeting, so I will give you some leeway, but compose yourself or you will be asked to leave.”
“John,” Sherlock said with infinite patience, “within the last 24 hours, you have called me both a dick and a twat. I’m fairly certain that biologically I can’t be both.”
Once his phone is back in his possession, John walks out of the station into the gathering twilight.  He stands on the pavement and hits the first number on speed dial.
“I didn’t actually get to eat in there. Are you hungry?” He asked Sherlock, and ignored the thrill he felt at the familiarity of it all.
"On the contrary, John; if we had, then we wouldn't be in a position now to find out where Jim Moriarty's successor is."
"Lordy, the man's obsessive about that place. I've only been once. It's freaking enormous but he's got two, just
With nothing left to occupy his time or his thoughts, Greg’s text asking him to share a pint has been a welcome interruption
He needs a drink  — orders a pint of the Welsh red ale, abjectly refusing to refer to it by name. “Tiny Rebel.” How is that even a name for a beer? The “Paulaner Munchen Hell” —now that’s a more apt descriptor. He doubts it translates from the German, but it’s exactly how he feels right now.
When you're finally allowed back in, other residents are hanging over the balcony watching the show below. They tell you that it was Kendall, the Robinson's boy on the fourth floor. There's a lot of head-shaking and hand-wringing; one woman he vaguely recognises is crying and shouting at a constable who is doing door-to-door. "Who gonna solve this crime? Why don you do som'at about that gang? Where's justice gone?"
"I don't want to end up in a battle of wits and denial with you today, Sherlock. I have promised to call you out on when your tendency to compensate for embarrassment by dismissing your need for support threatens our therapeutic relationship."
Sherlock strides to the door of the meeting room and throws it open, "Take a sniff and tell me that's from a fire."
"Does that phrase sound like John, do you think, or perhaps someone else?" she asks, lip quirked up.
"Yes." Jim is wearing an inscrutable smile that tells Sebastian he has no intention of following the barrister's advice.
"You are the reason I am alive, you idiot. When I came back from Afghanistan, I thought I'd lost everything, but you showed me how wrong I was. I know we don't talk about these things … God, feelings … but I loved you almost the moment I first laid eyes on you. Do you have any idea how happy I was when we finally connected?"
what happens behind the scenes of the rag trade, I tell you; many assistants learn from experience that it's best to make such rules explicit rather than implicit. Some people just don't know the difference between
Sherlock’s fingers reach out tentatively to touch John’s arm, resting lightly, barely touching. John stares at the fingers for a moment.
John pokes his nose around Lestrade's door. Catching the Head of Neurosurgery at his desk is a rare event, and he wants to take full advantage of it.
Mycroft takes his drink over to the leather reclining chair and settles back. "Do tell; I love your flights of fancy."
The doctor nods, pushing her dark shoulder-length hair back from her face. "Looking at the depth and spread, it is possible to estimate the quantity at somewhere between two to two point two five liters of blood."
He starts pacing again, walking the length of the sitting room, swivelling on his heel as he reaches the wall. The movement helps him force the sentimental thoughts from his mind. Now is not the time. Once Moriarty has been taken down and his web permanently pulled apart. Now that Sherlock knows what he is up against, the 'if' is something that he has to deal with properly. Is it better to let John think he killed himself, or let him believe that Sherlock had been killed by Moriarty? Knowing John, he'd hate the latter more than the former. The ambiguity Sherlock has built into his fake death will give John some solace; John can't blame himself for an irrational act that might have been suicide or murder. Being unsure, John won't go after Moriarty himself, in some sort of blind revenge. He should be safe for now.
"Seeing as neither I nor Mycroft are likely to produce offspring of our own, it was agreed that the Holmes Family Trust should be extended to one Rosamund Mary Watson. Godfather's prerogative."
As the crocodile of people inches forward towards the gondola station up to Mont Fort, the reason why I had dawdled before deciding on this trip becomes ever more annoying: too many damned holidaymakers cluttering up the landscape, getting between me and what I want to do. The man in front of me must have nearly bathed this morning in a disgusting aftershave. The stench of it offends my nose and makes me want to sneeze. He's already got a sheen of sweat on the back of his neck getting up the first two lifts to this point. He's overweight and obviously not intending to use the skis he is carrying. Moving this much lard down the black run would be a recipe for disaster.
He's so intent on adding this to his pile of today's woes that he nearly collides with Lestrade in the junction between the trauma and gastrointestinal theatre corridors.
When he nods, I continue, "Sherlock called me from the scene of the accident. Told me that he was being airlifted here."
"I don't know. Don't shoot the messenger; I'm just telling you what he said. And it's important that you go."
Sherlock has opened the lid of his laptop but isn't typing, just staring blankly at the screen. His head snaps up the minute the door clicks closed behind John. "First impressions?"
Lounging back on the sofa, Jim's smirk deepens into a toothy grin. "Your pride is bruised more than your face, Tiger. Not to say that the mark on your face is nothing to write home about. But just imagine what the damage would have been if you had Sherlock's cheekbones."
"Sherlock…" With my tone, I am trying to warn him that right behind the curtain, another woman wearing a medical staff badge has arrived. She's not wearing scrubs or a white coat, but the way she carries herself still telegraphs
"The truth, and nothing but the truth." Sherlock slings the bag onto his shoulder. He carries the Belstaff over his arm, and heads back to the centre of the glade. "Coming?" he calls back over his shoulder to John.
John grins. He hadn't quite anticipated how much seeing it in print, on-site, would affect him. Saying that he's proud would be a little… condescending, wouldn't it? Then again, why shouldn't he be allowed to be proud? Sure, he'd expressed his reservations, but they shouldn't be things which wouldn't have occurred to Sherlock as well. He'd been supportive of John when he'd been promoted to Clinical Director and, at first, John had merely felt obligated to return the favour. But now, after seeing how hard Sherlock had worked, particularly in areas where he had to throw himself into something that he found particularly difficult, John's admiration for him has increased immensely.
John reaches out to finger the cuff of Sherlock's shirt which is peeking out of his coat sleeve; he tugs it playfully a few times. "Sorry I couldn't be there last night."
It isn't until somewhere around midnight that it occurs to John that he never found out what Sherlock wanted to discuss.
Sherlock doesn't understand where the depth of her defensiveness comes from. After all, when he'd been underage, Violet had lapped up everything the so-called professionals she dragged him to see without much overt criticism. She had agreed to this meeting after they'd had perhaps the most constructive dialogue of their entire lives when Sherlock had visited at Sussex, but it had just been the two of them alone in her home turf. Now, she is highly defensive and territorial, keen to undermine Pichler's authority. Her expressed approval of the fact that Sherlock is seeing a therapist seems a bit fake.
Sebastian tries to push away thoughts about how Jim will punish him. Leaning up against the tiled wall of the holding cell, he focuses instead on Watson, adding fuel to the bonfire of his hatred of the man.
John raises an eyebrow in question, but Sherlock is lost in thought — later, explanations can wait. “So, what now? Hospital would be my recommendation. Get you cleaned up, check that there's no internal bleeding."
Sherlock seems to have settled enough to start drinking his tea. "Some kind of a framework of terms must be still discussed in advance, I assume."
Branger has kept talking to me on the phone but I can't seem to follow the conversation. The best I've managed is to throw in the occasional grunt or a yes to tell him I'm still here, still breathing. All the while, I keep thinking about John and how he will be waiting. The images conjured are so intense that they wrench tears from my eyes: John, sitting on a bench in the sunlit café with a cup of hot chocolate, looking up the valley for me to appear, to ski across from the rest of the group. What will he feel when I don't appear? When will he decide that something must have happened? Branger's company had made us fill out our emergency contacts onto the disclaimer sheets. I'd put John's number there. They haven't called him yet, have they? They shouldn't. They should only call him to tell him I'm fine. And I
"I wasn't referring to just you. Yes, this change involves us both, but this is about me. This is about not wanting to waste time feeling guilty for certain things not occurring to me, and for the time it would take to do those things."
And, he runs his hand up the inside of the victim’s forearm cupping his palm over the faint outline of an iconic K and a U in phosphorescent ink.
It's just at that point in his internal musings that his mobile, resting on top of Sherlock’s discarded clothes in the passenger seat, vibrates with an alert for an incoming text. He’s got the attachment open, one eye on the road when he realises what he is looking at; the sight of a beaten, bloodied and bruised Sherlock worming his way across a beaten earth floor. The sight makes him swerve violently, only narrowly avoiding sending the car into the ditch. He pulls over and with shaky hands, resumes the video.
What’s that line from the U2 song — ‘a dangerous idea that almost makes sense’? He’s tired of being lied to, manipulated and pushed around. And he’s tired of protecting Sherlock from himself and his brother. Lacking the sentiment of the words themselves but desperate to break his foul mood, he replies,
As they approach the corner, he starts to turn his shoulders; she misses the cue, so when he steps she is off balance, and loses the rhythm completely.
“Still not fessing up, hm? Fine. Fine. Continue your little game.” John slammed the phone down in its cradle and paced the floor in front of his desk, curling and uncurling his fist. The old man, the book, the fortune cookie… all within a week of the anniversary of Sherlock’s death? It was all too much. He knew, deep down, that Mary hadn’t organised something this extravagant just to play a trick on him. That would be downright cruel, and the Mary he knew was never cruel. Must be coincidental then but…
As Mycroft makes a third circuit from the windows to the wall, Sherlock decides that he needs his brother to take this personally. He takes an A4 sheet of bright pink paper from the pile on the side table and uses a marker to draw a giant letter M. He walks to the wall and right in the middle, in the empty space to the right of the two o'clock, he blu-tacks it up.
Sebastian knows it’s a rhetorical question, and he's got his orders to stay silent. All he can do is sit quietly in the corner, at the back of the room, and play witness to the chaos being orchestrated by Jim.
Tonight, he's going to try south London for a change. He has a dealer there he hasn't tapped up recently, and the man says there’s a convenient doss house not far from where John and Mary live. He might wander past their flat just to see if the lights are on.
John recalls what the dark-haired doctor at the inquest had estimated; “Two to two point five litres,” he confirms.
The choice of dance tonight had been appropriate; after the rush to get the most out of the hour with Irina and Masha, they stop at a tapas bar for a quick bite before he proposes coffee back at the flat. The reality is proving to be tedious. Service is abysmally slow, the music loud, the crowd noisy and annoying. When a glass of chilled Fino sherry eventually arrives with three small dishes of food he does not recognise, Sherlock tries to stifle his dismay.
Projected on the enormous television screen at the front of the room, a panel of CNN reporters sit behind a news desk discussing the events of four o’clock that day. Sebastian watches in awed fascination as the latest of Jim’s games is recounted; four systems going dark and a Facebook post to announce it to the world.
There is a little tableau unfolding in front of him, and he gets momentarily distracted from his thinking. A young mother with a baby in a pushchair is talking on her phone and has managed to lose eye contact with her toddler who is slowly following. The little boy —
The notepad from his office, innocuous except for the foreboding message scribbled hastily on it, seemed to mock him from where it sat on the desk.
On autopilot, he washes up the breakfast things and then goes into the living room, turning his chair to face his evidence wall. John uses the time to fill in the gaps, posting new notes up. He prints out the messages from a concerned friend, sticking them up alongside the map of Hampstead Heath. There is method in this madness; if it does turn out to be a plot by Moriarty and Moran, then John wants to be able to lead Mycroft to it—that is if Mycroft ever manages to get out of whatever hot water he's managed to get himself in. At noon, John gets his Browning pistol from the drawer upstairs and proceeds to give it one of the most thorough cleans he's ever done, anger and anticipation fueling his motions. He checks and re-checks the weapon's functioning. There is no tremor in his hand when he takes aim at the smiley face on the wall over the sofa. He doesn't waste the ammunition by actually firing—no need to add to the damage Sherlock already inflicted on the plaster.
Then Jim places both hands on Sebastian's shoulders and shoves him down hard. Obediently, Sebastian squirms and wiggles further down the headboard, until only his neck and head are pressing against it. Jim shuffles forward, straightening up and pressing closer at the same time so that the tip of his cock is now nudging against Sebastian's lips. It's a frankly ridiculous angle for his neck, but Sebastian moves to obey, craning his neck to swirl his tongue around the tip of Jim’s cock, licking it into his mouth.
Mycroft drops his hands to the smooth surface of the mahogany wood, running his hands outwards across the inset burgundy leather before getting to his feet. No point in putting off the inevitable. He asks Anthea to call the driver.
Should he be feeling anger, disappointment? His discontent with abusing Eurus and being used by her for all these years has reached a critical point. There should be relief, but the weight of the years as her gaoler has not shifted from his shoulders.
… all planned in advance and no one the wiser? If Sherlock is behind this, then this is just the sort of thing he'd come up with, John realises.
When he enters, Sherlock is already fully engaged with the microscope and what lies beneath. John glances at the kitchen, wondering if more tea might make this easier.
I was about to launch into just that lecture, about how his lying to me was wrong and how seeing that happen should have made him come to his senses about these challenging routes, and if I'd known, I would have tried to talk him out of doing the off piste trip.
“Did you see that?” Donovan asked without turning her gaze away from the scene playing out in front of her as she felt Lestrade's approach. This bit was familiar. She'd seen it a dozen times or more. What had come before, though - John Watson taking control of the situation and the resources and organizing the rescue - that was new.
Sherlock sniffs. "I could have told you that it wasn't about the ransom; he's just doing that to put the wind up the Americans."
assistant, paid for by him alone and not the Trust. No, Edgar is not the problem but the fact that no matter how well he behaves and how helpful he appears, the young man's an intrusion. One John had not really anticipated and still doesn't know how to deal with.
Mrs Hudson gives him and the gloves, one of which has landed atop the kettle, a dirty look but proceeds to remove it and click on the kettle nonetheless.
“You know the family?” John is suddenly on guard, he’d rather not be served up to Moran on a platter like one of the sides of beef in the back of the van.
He can remove a brain tumour, learn a foreign language quickly and design a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, but try as he might to summon his fledgeling confidence constructed with John and Dr Pichler, the notion of a ballroom full of people still makes him feel as though he's been flung back to elementary school. He takes a deep breath and tries to swallow his anxiety while staring out the Bentley's window as they come ever closer to his moment of truth. For once, he would have hoped for a longer drive.
He casts his mind back to the old man who they had met at the start of the hunt those many months ago, how had he referred to Moriarty’s manor? “Uh, the old O’Madden place at Kilnaborris?”
“Since when have you known me to joke?” Mycroft sniffs. "You know the nuts and bolts of Moriarty's plot; other services around the world are trying to identify the people who put it into action. Most identified so far have been innocent dupes with no onward trail to link them to Moriarty. The one name we had in the UK — an IT worker for the NATS facility in Swanage — died in a car accident in early December. As for Moran, from what we can find, he played no role in the plot. None at all. That’s it. That’s all of it. No talk, no chatter, nothing. Just whispers, rumours, nothing that anyone can pin down.”
With the second wave of Covid cases in the London area, John has had to take on even more hours, both at the clinic and telemedicine appointments and Sherlock has taken on the role of caregiver during the day. In an abundance of caution, for Rosie, for the other children at her school, and most importantly for Hudders, John had made the decision a few weeks ago to pull Rosie from the in-person school and enrol her in the e-learning option. He’d stressed about it for days without mentioning it, growing increasingly agitated as Sherlock had observed quietly with a really good hunch.
“If you've read my messages you wouldn’t need to ask.” Sherlock only just manages not to pause after each word.
John collapses on top of him and immediately pulls out, rolls to the side, turning his back, without touch. Sherlock lies there, staring at the ceiling while he listens to John’s breaths even out, become deeper. When enough time has passed, he swings his legs over the side of the bed and pushes himself up to sitting, his skin prickles and his toes curl as they touch the cold wooden floorboards the rug doesn’t quite reach. He turns to run his eyes over John’s sleeping form one last time.
The doctor turns back to the front and the Coroner continues with her questioning. “In that case, given the estimated blood loss, in your opinion, could a victim of this volume of blood loss possibly survive?"
Mrs Hudson shrugs. "When Frank bought this place all those years ago as an investment, he put it in my name. He said if I rent it out officially, then it means taxes and inspections and all sorts of building regulations that he didn't want to deal withal that legal stuff about who I can and cannot allow in, not to mention what I can charge. The local council people are such busy-bodies, sticking their nose into things. The fact that it's 221b on the front door is because there's no locked door to your flat; and that's against the rules, apparently."
John doesn't want scripted words though, he wants answers. "Time?” he raises his eyebrows. “What about the last seven weeks? Hmmm?"
Jim breaks the kiss, pulling back a little to examine Sebastian’s face. “You need some rest, Tiger.”
Somehow the Russian's praise is a way to make her relax. Sherlock's brows furrow as he considers how that has happened, and whether he can learn it quickly enough to make a difference. John had said that he could always tell when Sherlock was faking it, and it is important to be convincing if his plans are to work.
Despite the number of agents hanging about, John still can’t put his nerves to rest as he follows Sherlock, Mycroft leading the way, down the oriental carpeted hallway, his eyes darting this way and that, instincts refusing to let him believe that everything is safe. There are still more
Standing in the middle of the floor-to-ceiling window encompassing the entire north side of the top floor state room of St. Ermin’s Hotel, Jim runs his gaze from right to left over the powerhouse that is the English political and legal systems. From the Houses of Parliament to the Ministry of Justice, as far as his eye can see, under the increasing cover of the darkness of a winter afternoon—his playground. His eyes narrow in calculation on a cavalcade proceeding up Tothill Street. Ministers, Supreme Court Justices. Civil servants. The minions he chooses either to do his bidding or to destroy. The whole world, his to do with as he chooses.
He shakes his head. Trying to get John recruited would nullify all of his attempts at proving he can function without his husband. He'd only be hiding behind John's back again, and it would also make Lestrade angry as hell if he lost John because there is no way that a Clinical Director position could be a part-time arrangement. Would John even want to be in charge of something as big as the Steadman Unit? Unlikely. In an open competition for the clinical director of a neurosurgery department, the person chosen will probably be a specialist surgeon and not an anaesthetist. Pushing John forward only to have him be turned down would not look good.
… you didn't think that was it did you? How could we leave it there with all this delicious angst! Stay tuned for the next installment in this series: From the Cold Ashes!
"Me, walk?" Janine's laughter grates on his ear a bit; luckily, she can't see him grimace. "You haven't seen the heels my boss makes me wear. All the one-way streets seem designed to add to the taxi cost, but when I've got sore feet it's worth every penny. Text me the address tomorrow. London’s still a bit of a mystery to me.”
He curls his toes in the worn antique tiger-skin rug beneath his feet, trying to move the flattened hairs on the hide, to ground himself. Despite blaming Jim for the situation with Watson, he knows that he got himself into this predicament all on his own. He was the one who reacted to the taunt. He was the one who lost control. That's one of the exciting things about being with Jim; it demands a level of self-control that is positively, electrifyingly, arousing. He deserves this punishment for failing to maintain that control.
I'm now halfway down the section and feel more confident about anticipating what negotiating it requires. I bring my skis into a narrower stance, balancing the weight between inner and outer skis. This is a three-dimensional problem I am solving rather than the usual two. I have to make choices about how deep I want to be in the powder: the deeper, the slower, for sure, but there is a risk of getting bogged down and stalling. Too fast, on the other hand, runs the risk of misjudging a placement. Get it wrong, and I could disappear into a cloud of powder on a turn that blinds me to an obstacle — or I might fall. On a slope this steep, that might well lead to severe injury. Getting it right, as I am now, creates a sense of invincibility, of freedom itself that's unbelievable. It's quieter here, too, as compared to groomed pistes; the silence is so profound that I can hear my own heartbeat, elevated from the adrenaline rush. At last, I am
The DI mulls over John’s suggestion before eventually shrugging a shoulder apologetically. “Honestly not sure how much help I can be — haven’t had much experience with boyfriends coming back from the dead. But if you need someone to talk to, you know where to find me.”
John shakes his head. "I am not going to pretend that I'm not hurt by the fact that I seem to be the last to know about this."
An unconscious person could have been carried straight across the street. Between the cars parked on either side of the road, the open space is only about four meters. It could be timed; two taller vehicles—say a van and an SUV—on either side of a narrow gap would have shielded anything going across from the cameras. It was a dark night after all.
John isn't done berating him. "Unsurprisingly, you've decided something like this without even bothering to consider what it might mean to me."
As he gets to the end of the aisle, and looks back at the jurors, Moriarty waves and says, "Bye bye, Jonny Boy!"
They both watch the flames flicker through and around the bricks for the next few minutes until the ringing of Mycroft's phone breaks the silence. Sherlock turns to regard him with a deducing stare as Mycroft moves to answer it. He ignores his brother to focus on the message being relayed. It's from his PA and the content makes Mycroft's eyebrows rise.
As John struggles to extract his arm, Moran says, "Hey, man. Relax!" loud enough to be heard by the pedestrians who are staring as they give the two men an even wider berth, passing as close to the walls as possible.
." Sherlock frowns. "Those ADHD traits which are most noticeable in him will certainly make some people uneasy, amused or even suspicious; they certainly did John. Since those traits are something which Edgar cannot change, he learned to work around them, and the skills he's picked up, he is now using professionally. He's quite clever. Clearly, the intellect can compensate for a lot."
Edgar nods. "We need to establish rules and methods of interaction. When I am not needed, I will be unnoticeable. Never hesitate to say so if you require time alone. I assure you, it's absolutely fine. Our arrangement is for your benefit, not mine."
Sherlock's really got no choice but to agree if he is to get what he needs from her. Lady Smallwood can't wait: the Parliamentary Oversight Committee that she chairs is due to give its report to the Prime Minister next week, and Magnussen wants a white-wash. Sherlock can't waste any more time.
“Well, it’s— there’s— it’s a bit complicated, yeah? We’re… more. Different. There’s more here than just… friends. Or maybe I’m…”
She's still standing by the window, looking out as she sighs. "I can see I am going to make no progress with you. Such a disappointing dullard at times, Mycroft. I shall have to rely on Sherlock to be the sensible one here. At least he is trying to communicate with her. You've given up on her completely, haven't you? Told us that she wouldn't talk or engage …that ridiculous phrase of yours—'she's passed beyond our view'. Codswallop. Sherlock has proved you wrong; their music is so lovely, and his playing is improving again. She taught him well; he must have missed her challenging him. I'm looking forward to seeing the two of them together."
"You never resist my romantic offerings, you git. I hardly need to have you drugged for a snog." Only Sherlock could joke about such a disturbing concept and make it sound entirely normal.
“We will find Moran,” Mycroft responds stiffly, picking a piece of non-existent lint off his trouser leg.
He knows he needs to try to avoid emotive language. Yesterday, he'd been so tired and thrown off balance by the news that he knows he might have been a bit… brutally critical. Challenging something Sherlock proposes head-on can result easily in the man becoming rather defensive and even mulish. It is both a strength and a weakness: on the one hand, Sherlock's determination to succeed in something when others think he can't do it is what has made him the man he is today, and John highly respects and loves that in his partner. On the other hand, that stubborn determination can make Sherlock a bit unrealistic and blind him to potential difficulties. He has a tendency to put himself under too intense a pressure without realising he's crumbling under it before it's too late. What had happened two Christmases ago with Violet is a good example, and so is how stressed Sherlock had been when building the international network for his research project. John worries about his husband; he can't help that. It's part and parcel of loving him.
“I think I gathered that from the high chair. And the new cot upstairs. You’ll never be rid of us now.”
As soon as the BBC's coverage is done, Jim is on the hunt for another version, flicking manically through the channels with the remote. He swaps to the internet and starts trawling the news sites.
John sighs. "Yeah, that's exactly why we need to have this conversation. And dispose of those gloves properly before you touch anything, or we're both going to end up with diarrhoea.
Sherlock shakes his head. "You don't understand, John." He taps the laptop. "It's all part of the game; we have to go."
As my breathing calms, caution kicks in, and I look back up the steep incline, watching the four others making their own way down. I am not surprised that each decides to find their own tracks down. Who would want to play in someone else's trail when we have the whole of the pristine backside of the mountain to explore?
He had his suspicions when he stepped out onto the Health to meet Moriarty. The man’s schemes too grand, the gestures too big. They were a point, part of a larger message, and not just for him. Sherlock had originally thought that it might have been all for Moran. But Moriarty’s willingness to exclude him from the rules of the game, taking Moran’s gun from him just in case he decided to take matters into his own hands, suggested no. A fraud in Moran's eyes, yes, but more importantly, fraud in the eyes of someone who had mattered before Moran. This went back further. Further than the bodyguard-come-lover, further than a plaything.
I can hear other voices — calm voices — in the background, which means Branger is not the only one looking for me. My breath hitches at the realisation that I am going to be rescued. I exhale with relief, close my eyes.
He won't eat that last one which I recognise as grilled, glazed eel on rice wrapped in seaweed, but he knows it's one of my favourites. I assume the shrimp version is for him. He really
“The bug wasn’t yours then,” John states, somewhat redundantly while walking over the waste bin to retrieve it.
"No, he is certainly not a parent or a caregiver, but in the past, you have deferred to him in many things which you are now attempting on your own."
The running has turned out to be something that John enjoys, even if his joints are paying the price. With his spouse as absorbed as he is at GOSH, John has used the spare time to work out with a couple of other people from King's who were also doing the run.  The distance between the flat and the hospital is a convenient 5.4 miles — nearly 9K — so he's taken to running it twice a week instead of taking the car out. Without having to worry about Sherlock, he can take the tube into work, and then run home. He's lost weight and tightened up his muscles a lot, sleeps better and interestingly enough, really enjoys having the time to stop thinking about anything other than putting one foot in front of another. It means he arrives home much more relaxed than he would have after having to battle London's traffic in the car. It's just that his right knee is swollen again and keeps locking, the joint cracking and snapping, causing pain to shoot down his shin. He's never injured it enough to stop his training, and his left one is fine. He did take a bit of a stumble during his first week of running, but he hadn't fallen or even hit it on anything. Why would it cause so much trouble?
A moment passes —or is it longer? He can't tell. But something is tapping his cheek and it's getting more insistent. He manages to prise open one eye, to see another bloodshot eye looking at him with concern.
It makes him an adversary worthy of Jim, and Sebastian begins to think he sees something of bigger plans here. The business with the little brother may only have been a feint, a ploy to take the elder Holmes' eye off the ball. Whatever Jim is doing out there, it's rattling Mycroft Holmes now.
The Exeter student gives me a sympathetic look. "It's tough. I understand. Try the phone again. Maybe your man is one of the ones whose helping."
"Good, you're awake." When John had first glanced at him, he had looked as though he might just slump down and migrate into a heap on the floor. "Let's get you to bed."
Somehow, that doesn't sound like Sherlock. What I know of my husband is that he's highly competitive, enjoys a bit of adrenaline.
Now, Sherlock is truly reaching for the professional independence and confidence John has wanted to help him find right from the start — right from the very beginning when he'd told Sherlock that he believed the man could sort out his own messes. John doesn't want to stand in the way of that even when he feels uncomfortable letting go.  Maybe the key is to remember that even if things between them as physicians can now be less interdependent, at home, they're still them. There, masks can be dropped, facades taken down. There, he can need Sherlock and Sherlock can need him for not just the important things but even small, peculiar things that matter within the safety of their privacy.
“I'd meant to bring her here tomorrow,” he said to the stone. “I've told her about you, but … before I moved on – moved
His teeth start to chatter, so he bites down hard to silence them. Wraps his arms around himself as a full-body shiver runs through him. Warm where skin meets skin but cold everywhere else. By this stage, his balls have receded and his cock has shrivelled and shrunk, seeking the heat of his core.
Janine lifts her hands from the keyboard, and puts them down in her lap, keeping her eyes averted from the malicious glint in his eyes.
Inside the airport might be warmer, but the time has passed tediously slow. Why it is necessary to check in over two hours early and loiter in this hell hole airport for a less than a one hour and twenty-minute flight is beyond him, but he doubts that the airlines are willing to bend the rules just because the UK and Ireland have a common travel arrangement meaning there are no passport checks. Now that the air traffic world has started spinning on its axis again with the end of Moriarty’s scheming, a return to routine is not going to make the trip any shorter.
, sinuous figures of eight that allow his partner to show off just to please him. Their connection is exhilaratingly better than anything Sherlock has experienced before on a dance floor, simply because this is
He is, however, thoroughly pleased with the way today’s events transpired; he couldn’t have planned it better. Taking the bait, Watson had ended up arrested and cooling his heels in a jail cell, saved only by the arrival of Holmes’ Met connection. The loyal Detective Inspector must be getting tired of Watson’s antics by now. As it was, he definitely did not look impressed at having to bail Watson out of a tight spot yet again.
"I'll see if she's got a minute tomorrow," John says. The bag of ice is beginning to sweat droplets, so he rises from his seat to put it away. He grimaces as his knee crackles and snaps.
He has also complained recently — numerous times, in fact — that Sherlock has no right to share his private health information with other people, not even with other physicians.
The fact that Mycroft doesn't speak, but just opens the connection, tells Sebastian that this is the call he's been waiting for and that it is likely to be from someone who is working for him. After a moment's silence during which time Sebastian wishes there was a way to bug the man's bloody phone as well as the flat, Holmes barks an order, “We need everything that is scheduled to be in the air at two o'clock.”
“They’re designed that way, you dork. General enough to let anyone find anything they want to read into them. It’s fun—the start of a conversation about what you’d like your future to be.”
"You say these things, that you know I'm an independent adult, but don't seem to realise that the relationship is supposed to have changed as I grew up," Sherlock points out. "When I visit you and Dad in Sussex, everything is as if I was still five years old. When we saw each other last, I told you that I don't think you're interested or willing to see anything else than all the things in me you have always found so hard to deal with."
It’s going to take him nearly two hours to get to Galway, even if he doesn’t quite stick to the speed limits, so there is plenty of time to plan. First, he needs to get rid of the idiot agent who is tailing him. When he reaches a particularly empty bit of the single-track road, John jams on the brakes, throws open his car door and marches back to the car behind him. The agent powers down the window and asks, "Problem?"
Fiedler clears her throat, looks back down at her clipboard and begins to write, announcing, "Patient has declined examination, and is discharged against physician's advice." When she has signed the form, she hands the clipboard to Sherlock with the pen.
Shocked and distressed, the Italians are demanding to know what had happened to their friend, Antonio Fabiano. Y
When Mycroft finally returns to Montague Street around lunchtime, the first thing he does is sniff the air. His face wrinkles. "You've been smoking."
The thought of it takes him by surprise, though this address has been consistent — more or less— for well over a decade. Home, he realises, has nothing to do with this black door, or the comfortable cluttered chaos of the sitting room. It has nothing to do with material items and everything to do with the man waiting for them upstairs.
For Sherlock, there seems to be nothing amusing in that statement. He murmurs John's name as he nimbly turns in place within John's arm on his torso, and there's awe in his tone. John's heart stutters in his chest as the sorrow over witnessing Sherlock so unconfident after a setback, seeing how he always thinks his successes are, deep down, something that happens despite himself. John hopes for nothing more than for that to change, for Sherlock to see himself the way John sees him; someone he's privileged to love.
He spent the rest of the afternoon sweeping the flat to make sure that Moran had not left any other gifts, save the additional words on the smiley face that mocked him every time he passed through the sitting room. He'd found one bug in the living room, but nothing more. As he'd smashed it with a hammer, John had wondered whether it was Mycroft's or Moran's.
Smirking, the man says, "Surprise!" as the commuters split to flow either side of the two obstacles now in their path.
“Oh, you know as well as I do that he's been plotting to have the place refurbished for years. This will give him an excuse.” Sherlock waves a hand breezily as he turns back to regard his handiwork, “Anyway, you're going to thank me.”
The main bedroom is located up a flight of narrow stairs, and it takes all of Sherlock’s remaining energy, and John at his side, to make the journey. He’d like to go straight to sleep but he knows that his (
. He said they would talk later, and they will, but he knows that John needs something from him now.
I inhale and crinkle my nose. Of course, our colleague is right, and it would be convenient for all concerned to believe his words. But I am not quite prepared to let Sherlock off the hook, because I know that, even if he'd been in his right mind at the time, my husband would have minimised it all, hoping to be able to shrug off any injuries as minor because he wouldn't want to admit that throwing himself down a mountainside at speed is actually dangerous. "No, you're not going anywhere tonight. I'm staying right here, and so are you, until they think you are fit for discharge."
