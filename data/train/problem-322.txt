, then everything will have been futile. If he gives in to the voice whispering in the back of his mind, Moriarty will have won.
A few policemen, who also heard the insult, snicker at her words, partly because they found it amusing, partly because they're appalled that a stranger, who isn't even a police officer, has solved the case before them.
, a movie about dinosaurs that was entertaining enough to distract him at least a little bit from the fact that Sherlock sat frustratingly far away. John knew that the genius didn’t like to be crowded, and he respected that, but he couldn’t help but feel a bit strange when his friend was sitting so far away. After all, it was rather unusual. Normally, when they watched a movie, Sherlock would scoot over to John after a while, either resting his head on John’s shoulder or simply pressing his side to John’s. The blonde didn’t really know what made him different from all the others that Sherlock disliked touching, but he felt honoured.
The answer the brunette gave, was a short, distracted “Hm?”, not bothering to look up from his experiment.
When Sherlock Holmes wakes up the next day, it's to three missed calls by Lestrade, an aching head and constant screaming in his mind.
Tonight, Sherlock lay softly snoring on their old couch. John had woken up in the middle of the night, feeling thirsty and when he had went to drink some water, he had found his friend asleep, curled up in a blanket, his mouth hanging slightly open.
Because Sherlock Holmes doesn't have friends, he just doesn't. He's never had any and he's come to terms with the fact that he'll also never have any, and that's okay, he doesn't have any desire to change that.
If all he was were a genius, it would be easy to help his friend, who was caught in a nightmare upstairs. It would be easy to take action, he'd know what to do.
When he shrugs his coat off and takes his shoes and scarf off,  the word seems to drown out every other noise.
“No.”, he said, stood up and switched the TV off, pacing a bit. “No, this is absolutely impossible, there’s
And the fact that his friend, Sherlock, knew – quite surprisingly – next to nothing about greek mythology, had absolutely nothing to do with John’s new interest. Nor did John use that to his advantage and made puns about greek gods the brunette didn’t understand, or used pick-up-lines on him, which referenced to mythology. No, John didn’t do that. Not at all.
Hi there again! I just quickly wanna ramble about Jurassic world, so if you still want to watch that movie, please don't read this note. <3
"Right". He nods, back still turned to John, who's watching him with confusion and a bit of concern.
But then he hears what Sally, the impolite woman who Sherlock's disliked from the beginning, whispers to herself, and his smile slides off his face as quickly as it appeared.
He's confused by Sherlock's confusion, the surprise in his stare, the nearly defensive posture the other has adapted.
Their dinner continued silently – a rare occurrence – and John couldn’t help to feel a bit nervous. He had thought about this a lot, and he didn’t want to come across like a pining fifteen-year old (even though this would be a precise description of how he felt), and therefore he had chosen a a bit less corny line. John looked at their plates, noticing that Sherlock had nearly finished and seemed ready to retreat back in his mind palace, if his unfocused eyes and slow breathing were any indicators.
I recently saw the movie and it was nice and action-packed and fun. I liked the movie but the one thing that really bothers me is that the damn indoraptor died because there's no way this skull wouldve killed him when he fell on it, as he has scales and
Sherlock doesn't have friends and that's fine by him, even good sometimes, because they could be a hindrance, a weak spot for him, because caring weakens him, emotion can destroy the clear logic of rational thought and that's not something Sherlock can allow.
Sherlock pressed his mouth into a thin line, looking out of the window. Maybe it was really just the tiredness that got John to speak nonsense. It wasn’t worth investigating – for now at least. But if his friend would continue to say illogical things, then Sherlock would search for the reason behind this. For now, he had better things to do. The wing about tobacco ash in his Mind Palace needed to be upgraded.
“You know Sherlock”, the blonde started once they had begun eating, “next time we have a meeting with Lestrade you could try to be a bit less harsh. I’m sure he’d appreciate it.” Sherlock who actually ate the chicken with rice John had made, scoffed. “When he becomes competent enough to actually do his job himself I’ll think about it.”
whispered a treacherous voice in his head - had said so himself. The problem was that he didn't know what else to do. He didn't know how to help John, didn't know how to make it better.
Sherlock tries to ignore him. He knows if he gives in now, gives in to the urge to signal John somehow that this isn’t real,
“No one important. Charon is just a man I read something about a few days ago.” That made Sherlock look up, his eyes now gleaming a bit.
John`s voice is breathless and shakes just a little and the one word Sherlock tries his best to avoid lies on the tip of his tongue, ready to spill out of his mouth. He swallows hard and steels himself.
It wasn't a loud piece, wasn't played at a fast pace, but a beautiful, calming melody. Sherlock had composed it himself, weeks ago when John had woken up from a nightmare and just hadn't stopped crying upstairs in his room.
Sherlock doesn't care about the stares that follow him when he leaves the crime scene or the look Sally gives him when he passes her. He doesn't even really care about
Sorry it took me so long! This is for Lionnamerlend who left a lovely comment on the last chapter. Ihope you all like it! :)
The two friends were in the kitchen, John preparing tea, and Sherlock was busy with whatever experiment he was engrossed in this time (John hadn’t bothered to ask, maybe he would do that another time), when John turned to Sherlock, facing the man who leaned over the kitchen table, looking intently at a piece of a burnt red handkerchief.
John silently agreed with him and chuckled a bit but still, for some reason didn’t dare to stroke his friends hair nor did he put his arms around him. Instead he laid them over the back of the couch in a rather uncomfortable position. And that didn’t go unnoticed by Sherlock. He turned, still lying down, an action that nearly made him fall on the floor. Now able to look at John’s face, he stared at him, a crease between his eyebrows.
Sherlock sighed. He wished he could do more for the man upstairs he had come to like, had let in a way he had never let anyone else in.
Sherlock doesn't really care about the amused policemen, he doesn't care about the way Lestrade looks at Sally sharply, or the heartfelt speech he receives from Lestrade for helping them. He gives the man a short nod in response and a another one as an answer to the question if he'd be willing to help with more cases.
this skull didn’t break, this is inacceptable. The dinosaur wouldn’t have died, he has scales! Scales, John! He wouldn’t have been impaled on the triceratops’s horns because it is a
And therefore, the only logical conclusion was to interrupt Sherlock’s thinking process with tea and food, hoping that there would be the perfect opportunity for using a line while they had dinner.
At those words, Sherlock looked up rapidly and John was immensely glad that his friend was already leaning against the door or else he surely would have fallen over at the fast movement.
This earned him an irritated huff at which he laughed at, as well as an elbow in his upper leg as Sherlock turned to face John.
The detective gave a short nod but an amused smile played around his lips as he leaned back on John, his hands in his friend’s. John let out a content sigh, enjoying the closeness and turned on the TV once more.
Sherlock made his way to his violin, lying in the windowsill. He picked it up, stroking it softly, nearly caressing it. It was valuable, not only was it expensive but also important to Sherlock. And John, in a way.
He turned his back to the kitchen, looking out of the window, down on the dark, quiet streets and started playing.
This, right here, was the part he could handle, he knew what to do now. It didn't need a genius to figure it out.
For all the man claimed to sleep as little as possible, John found him like this quite often. He didn’t mind it, though; finding his friend asleep on the couch was vastly preferable to finding him engrossed in his experiments at half past two in the night.  It was always damn near impossible to get Sherlock away from them, or convince him that even a genius needed sleep.
A screech from the TV interrupted Sherlock, who whipped his head around just in time to see a giant dinosaur fall onto the skull of a triceratops. The dinosaur got impaled by the horns of the skull, the other one that had been on top of him jumping of his corpse and Sherlock turned back to John with a tortured expression on his face.
Still, he hadn't stopped playing until well into the early hours of the morning, when the sun had started to rise. He hadn't dared to, hadn't wanted to risk John waking up again.
the night before or maybe because he liked gently teasing Sherlock as much as he liked flirting with him, he added: “I guess you could say I like being patro-close to you. You’re my Achilles heel.”
Sherlock and John uncover a lead from Oliver when John attempts to transfer him out of Lestrade's office and into a prepared interrogation room.
"I'm not sure. Why don't you tell me about the rat?" He prompts, leaning against the wall and crossing his arms. The man shakes his head furiously and looks down at the carpet around the chair.
"Antipsychotics." Oliver said, for the first time with certainty. "Psychiatrist," he breathed, as if remembering something, "I have-" He shifted in the chair and felt for his back pocket, but realized something and looked down at his body. "What the...? My wallet's gone!"
"Think you can take your button-up off?" John asked, watching Sherlock kick his shoes off his heels and shake them off his long feet, hitting the floor with a soft thud. "I'd like to wrap your stitches with some gauze. It should help with the irritation."
Sherlock... He had really changed after Mary died, and even more now that John and Rosie were living in 221b with him. John wasn't sure whether to say it was for better or for-
"Oh. Good. So... you were staring at me now for the same reason that you had stared at me when I asked you to be my best man... correct? It wasn't that you were-"
The sound of a door opening cut Sherlock's sentence off. He turned on his heels just as a man dressed in scrubs walked around a large free-standing glass cabinet of white plastic bottles. The man froze, staring at Sherlock and John with wide eyes. In a panic he dashed back the way he had come, and Sherlock followed him just as quickly around the corner of the cabinet.
Plates were fixed and dinner was eaten, and as usual Rosie made a mess of herself and her clothes. Ms. Hudson wrapped a plate in foil, placed it in the fridge for Sherlock, then ducked her head into the bathroom to say goodnight to John and Rosie, who was getting a bath. Once clean and dry, John looked at the time and found that dinner and her bath took up more time than John thought it had. It was only seven o'clock, but Rosie's bedtime wasn't far away and he still had to get her dressed, which always was an ordeal. So, he carried his daughter up to his room and dressed her for bed, grabbing her favorite blanket and stuffed animal on the way. It was going to get cool tonight, so over the course of twenty minutes he managed to dress her in a long sleeve shirt and soft pajama bottoms.
"Time's come to stop playing pretend, Mr. Holmes." John smirked, surprised when he noticed a tiny twisted smile play across the corners of Sherlock's lips in return. "Welcome to the crew."
"Ah, good. Keep an eye on him, I'll be down once the crew search the island." John ordered the boy, then looked past him at the rest of the crew coming up from below deck, "Before that, however, I've got a lesson to teach about responsibility."
Sherlock chuckled softly, watching and catching the different toys Rosie brought him while John applied antibacterial ointment to the line of stitches, placed a pad of non-stick gauze on top, then taped down the edges with medical tape. By the time he was done, a pile of stuffed animals had formed on the couch next to Sherlock. John noticed it and laughed, looking over at Rosie as she waddled off in search of more toys. He followed her and picked her up, kissing her cheek.
"Ah." Sherlock hummed. "Still, no need to thank me. As you are fond of reminding me, sleep is necessary for proper bodily functioning, and 'sleeping in' is merely a social construct of-"
Oliver looked down at the wooden table and thought hard, his eyebrows furrowing. "I remember an alley and a street..."
After a few minutes of shushing and rocking, John went to put Rosie in her crib again. She whimpered and clung onto him, and he carried her over to his bed and sat down with her.
Oliver eyed his hand and cautiously took it, standing up. John smiled softly at him, let Oliver's hand go, and gingerly put a hand on his shoulder to steady Oliver as he led him out of the office. When Oliver saw the small group of officers standing just outside the office, he stopped and stared wide-eyed at them, stepping backwards into John. John gripped his shoulder firmly, his free hand reaching up to Oliver's elbow instinctively in case he tried to run away.
patients, really." She toyed with the bracelet on her left wrist. "But yes, I'd say so. I spend a lot of time leading group activities and discussion sessions. We grow close with how much time we spend together."
"Help me?" Oliver whispered with an edge of worry to his tone. John motioned to Oliver's hands, which were gripping the arms of Lestrade's chair.
"You know what's at the end of all this?" John prompted, patting the pocket where the letter was. Sherlock shook his head.
"I'll get some rookies to prep a room." He walked off, leaving John and Sherlock to watch Oliver through his office window. Some time passed as they were silent, each lost to their own respective thoughts. John wondered how they were going to move Oliver to a different room, what objects he should be allowed to have in that room, and if relocation would close the door of Oliver's mind that John had just managed to pry open.
"Your note," John's face settled into cold seriousness within an instant, staring down his prisoner, "
"I could have told you that." John joked, smirking softly. Sherlock rolled his eyes. "In all seriousness, I appreciate this newfound revelation. In fact..." John paused, wondering whether to continue the sentence. It wasn't like John, either, to say aloud 'such things'. He could sense Sherlock cautiously glancing over at him. It took him a few seconds, but he made up his mind. "Ever since you returned, I've noticed a change in you."
to handle." Isabelle answered after a moment. "From what you described, Doctor Watson, you experienced one of Oliver's episodes at the Yard?" John nodded. "I'm glad you were there for him, but for us this isn't something all too surprising when it comes to Oliver. That's why the orderlies sometimes aren't as..."
He ignored the message and finally reached his destination after a couple more minutes of walking. When he arrived, he found John standing outside with his arms folded. Judging by the look of John's face, he must have found something worrying, perhaps immoral. Sherlock approached him, and when John met his gaze, Sherlock gave him a questioning look.
"Thank you again, Ms. Hudson." John told her, setting the book down on the couch and holding Rosie as he stood up.
"I dreamed that I was back in Afghanistan, in the middle of a firefight." John admitted. "I guess I thought of you and Rosie at some point because suddenly you both were there in the middle of all that mess and... Fucking hell." John wiped his face with his hands, trying to wipe away the tears before they even had the chance to form.
"That's why you started using again when you came back. You started doing reckless things, like picking fights and letting yourself waste away on cocaine. Sherlock Holmes realized he was a mere mortal and it scared him."
"Great." Sherlock replied with a husky voice. "I think I need a few more to focus on, though." John chuckled, giving him a smirk.
"It's likely the morphine," John replied, reaching over and grabbing one of Rosie's many bibs from a drawer, "so it wouldn't do much good to wake him."
John spent the majority of the night deciphering the secret message within the handwritten words that the paper contained. It wasn't simple, but for an educated man like John Watson, it wasn't particularly difficult, either. It took a bit of trial and error, but John figured it out and transcribed the true message onto a piece of parchment, tucking the original into his desk drawer. Once he was done, he limped below deck and consulted his map table and globe.
"I'm still alive, am I not?" Sherlock countered softly, trying to lean and catch a glimpse of John's face but grimacing with pain.
"Wouldn't they notice if the basement was smaller than usual?" John questioned, wincing slightly as he stood up straight again. "I mean, they'd certainly notice if someone was building down here, right?"
Oliver's brows furrowed and he blinked, eyes drifting over the walls and furniture of the office. John could tell he was thinking hard, struggling to remember. Either that, or he was struggling to hear through the noise of his mind. Hopefully the voices had quieted down by now, but John was by no means an expert on schizophrenia. The closest he got to understanding the disorder was his own instances with mental illness and what he learned over the course of his doctorate while studying at Bart's.
Rosie waddled off toward the television where the rest of her stuffed toys lay on the floor, and Sherlock murmured to John, "It appears I'm being offered sacrifices."
"I don't know." Sherlock replied, this time a bit easier. "Mycroft paid my way out and sent me home. I didn't care enough to ask at that point if he bombed the place or what. I was just ready to come home and have everything back to how it was supposed to be."
John huffed out a disbelieving laugh, and Sherlock side-eyed him with a raised eyebrow. He set the warmed plate of food on the counter and pulled out a fork from a drawer nearby. "Do you have a secret organization of adrenaline-hungry London doctor's that I'm unaware of?"
"No-" John whispered and rushed over, setting his gun down on the floor beside Sherlock as Sherlock stepped back and leaned against the wall, clutching his side. John recognized the handle as a scalpel and he breathed a bit easier. It could be bad, but it definitely could've been worse.
"Hurry up, John." Sherlock demanded, shifting his weight on his knees in an attempt to get more comfortable. John took it as Sherlock shaking his arse impatiently, and admittedly he wasn't too far off.
"I can't hide anything from you, can I?" John teased, looking over his shoulder at the similarly bare-chested detective behind him. Sherlock rubbed his hand over John's right shoulder and down his side, pressing a chaste kiss to the back of John's neck.
"What happened?" John asked, glancing over as Sherlock walked up to Lestrade's office window to peer inside.
"No running in doors, little Watson." He chided her softly as he lifted her, kissing her cheek before he turned her around and sat her on his thigh. He draped the trailing edge of her blanket over her pastel pink trousers, arm holding her jumper-clad torso in place, as he said, "Why don't we play the bubble game while your father fixes himself tea?"
"Just before I came back." Sherlock whispered softly. The tender nervousness startled John. He'd never heard Sherlock sound so utterly rattled. "It was in Syria."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, a small smile tugging at his lips. John helped Sherlock out of the cab, tossing the fare into the passenger seat, then led Sherlock up to the front door of 221b Baker Street. John opened the door and Sherlock carefully walked up the couple steps and through the door. It was much easier to go up stairs now that he had morphine coursing through his system and the stab wound was cleaned up and stitched neatly. His stitches were incessantly itchy, though.
"John, I can barely walk straight." Sherlock countered. "You're wondering if I can utilize fine motor control?"
John was about to pull at his sleeve cuffs behind his back when he felt two hands grip both of his wrists. He paused, wondering what Sherlock was doing, and let Sherlock's hands slip his shirt off his shoulders and down his arms. John smiled when Sherlock tossed the shirt toward the clothes hamper.
"A sociopath, Sherlock Holmes..." John paused, taking a breath in, and cautiously rested a hand over Sherlock's.
Sherlock looked at the two men next to him after he spoke. Greg met his eyes for a moment then looked at Oliver with a thoughtful gaze, as if he could figure out what was wrong just by looking. Sherlock and John met eyes next, and John new that expression on Sherlock's face and the message hidden there.
John grabbed a small sheathed knife out of his coat pocket and used the blade to uncork the bottle. When he was successful, he fished out the parchment and set the bottle and cork down on the steps leading up to the helm. John idly limped down to the lowest deck, being careful on both flights of stairs, and hummed thoughtfully to himself when he finished reading. He looked up and saw two sets of eyes looking at him - one familiar hazel pair and one entirely new blue pair. Peter was sat against the wooden hull on a barrel, facing the iron cage in the center. The bars encompassed a small space floor to ceiling that had just enough room to sit down and not much else. Peter was watching John with his hazel eyes, waiting for whatever John was going to do or say to the man.
Before John could go any further, Sherlock pulled his lips just far enough away so he could take in a deep breath. John did the same, both men finding that their lungs were empty of air. When John exhaled, he let it out in a laugh.
Flashes of the anguish in that nightmare rose to the surface of John's mind, forcing his eyes to close as if he were in physical pain. He swallowed, remembering shouting Rosie's name when he woke up. Rosie cried for half an hour after that, and it took both Sherlock and John to calm her down. A pang of guilt hit John as he realized that Sherlock had really been taking care of them both in the wake of John's nightmare.
"No less?" Peter challenged. John begrudgingly nodded. Peter grinned cockily and held out a hand. "Deal." John shook it firmly, and when they let each other's hands go, Peter motioned to the paper. "So, what do you think? He had to hide it for a reason, right?"
"Ah, good, I see you've already asked her." John looked at Sherlock. "Lestrade wants to see us at The Yard."
John grinned and Sherlock returned the mischievous look, watching John lean over, open the bedside drawer, and grab a small bottle of lubricant that was half used. The doctor sat up and gestured for Sherlock to roll over, popping the cap open on the lubricant and sitting back on his heels. Sherlock recognized what John was asking as part of the process for what the educational videos called 'preparation' and he readily complied, flipping over onto his knees and forearms. John watched him between glances at his fingers as he poured the lubricant onto his hand, finding it incredibly difficult to take his eyes off of his partner.
On the floor just below the deck, most of the crew were eating and drinking, chatting merrily among themselves. It wasn't until they heard over this chatter the thud of John's cane walking across the wood floor that they realized that their captain had come back from interrogating the prisoner. John, Sherlock, and Peter watched the faces of the crew change from happiness to confusion to resentment. Most of the crew, John remembered, were street rats like Peter when John offered them a place on his ship. They had all been no younger than twenty when John found them, though - much older than Peter.
Sherlock's frown faded and he stared thoughtfully at John, just as he reached the bottom of the stairs.
"You didn't wash your hands." Sherlock deduced and told her, firm but not mean. John knew this was the case, but must have had an odd look about him that made Sherlock question it when he glanced at John. He focused on Rosie after a second of glancing at John. "Go wash your hands, please."
"'Course, Cap'n." Peter answered sincerely then headed out, closing the door behind him. When the door was fully closed, John looked over at Sherlock, who was staring blankly across the room. John recognized the man was lost in thought, but was forced to break him out of it.
Within a few minutes, thanks to Sherlock's preparation in the shower last night, John could easily fit two fingers. He
Sherlock stood and dropped Rosie's blanket beside her on the floor, then took off toward the door. He grabbed his coat and raced down the stairs to knock on Ms. Hudson's door, but she was already exiting her flat and turning to look up the stairs when he was about halfway down.
As they exited the building Sherlock's phone buzzed, but he ignored it, assuming it was Lestrade who was messaging him.
As the kissing took a heated turn, John pried himself away long enough to inquire, "Do you care if I-?"
"Did 'who' hurt me?" John pries, standing up straight and skirting the far wall so he can see the man and not strain his back.
"Go on, boy." John nodded toward the room, and Peter eyed him with uncertainty. "You're not in trouble."
"I'm not ill, if that's what you're wondering." Sherlock remarked. "The past few months have taught me many things, one of those being that it's best to say what I...
"Ah, yes," Sherlock answered before John could deny the offer, "I'd like to investigate the basement."
The two took a couple of steps then stopped next to where Sherlock was standing, looking in. There was a young man, in his mid-twenties, sitting in the corner of Lestrade's office. He had dark brown hair and chocolate eyes that were staring absently at the carpet. His lanky form was contorted so his bony knees were against his chest, his arms wrapped around his shins. His palms had the dried remnants of blood staining his skin, splatters dotting his hands and forearms.
John's smiling face shows the barest hint of confusion, eyebrows drawn together, mouth sagging a bit. "I said that you were my friend, Sherlock.", he repeats, shifting his weight on the stool a bit, hand holding his cane only a bit tighter.
Had it been the inelegant attempts at flirting? Had Sherlock noticed and felt now uncomfortable at the idea of touching John because he feared that it would send the wrong message?
After a few more minutes, in which they both watched the admittedly, bizarre story unfold on the TV- screen, John smiled softly.
floated in his head, over and over again, almost as if it were mocking him. If such a thing was even possible, being mocked by a
In the last few days, John's nightmares had become more frequent and the blonde woke up due to them almost every night, screaming or trashing around in his bed.
It is stuck in his head and refuses to leave. The word hurts him, it hurts him so much for some unknown reason, and this isn't the first time, he has experienced this before, and he knows where it will lead if he can't shake off the insult soon enough.
This chapter is a bit longer than the other one, but I'm really tired at the moment, so if I made mistakes or anything's unclear, I do apologize, and please tell me where I made errors.
It's not the first time someone has called Sherlock a freak and it probably won't be the last time, either. But nevertheless, the word stings every time, in a way that makes him wonder why. He has faced many insults and harsh words in his life, but for him,
“Are you sure? We have got pomegranate tea, it’s delicious.” Sherlock frowned at Johns back. He couldn’t remember the man buying pomegranate tea, nor had he known that this was a taste John liked. “No, I strongly dislike the taste of pomegranates. I didn’t know you liked them.” Weirdly enough, this drew a chuckle from Sherlock’s friend. “Oh, I’m just trying out new things. You know”, John added, a smile forming around the corners of his mouth, as he turned around to face Sherlock. “I would willingly eat a whole pomegranate for you. Not just six seeds.”
and start again two paragraphs further down at the line: "Sherlock was interrupted the second time this night, this time by a laughing John, and he stopped pacing and stared at his friend incredulously. "
Persephone had been kidnapped by Hades, and in order for someone to stay in the underworld forever, they had to eat something in the underworld. She ate (/was tricked into eating) six pomegranate seeds
Could it be possible that Sherlock was merely too immersed in his own mind to actually notice how far he and John were sitting apart? Or was today just one of his more touch-averse days? The genius got them sometimes, those days on which he would shy away even from John’s touch and when a simple brush over his arm or just the closeness of them walking together on the street felt uncomfortable or like too much. That was indeed a possibility. Normally Sherlock told John when one of these days came, but maybe he had forgotten today-
Sherlock had picked up his violin then and had started playing, for he did not know what else to do. And after a while of playing, after the minutes had ticked by, one passing slower than the one before, John had stopped sobbing and the creaking of the bed had told Sherlock that he had fallen asleep again.
“Why are you so careful not to touch me?” It was a normal question, Sherlock’s voice sounded the same as on every day, but John thought that he could hear an underlying tone of hurt. And that was unacceptable.
They were sitting on the couch together, watching TV. Sherlock sat on one end of the couch, his legs tucked in, arms crossed in front of his chest as he watched the film with a disapproving look on his face, doubtlessly criticising it. John on the other hand, had settled comfortably, legs stretched out before him, his head tipping slightly in Sherlock’s direction.
The Consulting Detective closed his eyes, his head, which had shot up at the shout, relaxed into the cushion in the couch once again and he took a deep breath.
The next chapter is finally there! Thank you all so much for the positive response I got for the first one, keep it up if you want! I'd be happy. :)
Sherlock turns, meeting John's eyes, his thoughts running wild, because he still cannot wrap his head around the lie the other has just told, twice. Why did he lie?
Sherlock takes a deep breath, lets go of the phone. Takes one last look at John Watson, his best friend, the man standing on the street, who`s screaming at him to stop.
Sherlock doesn't wait for the nod of approval and heads for the bathroom, his mind turning this one, simple word this way and that way, over and over again.
Just in that moment Sherlock huffed, interrupting John’s thoughts, stretched and laid down on the couch while simultaneously scooting over to his friend so that he could put his head in the lap of the other man. John raised both eyebrows, surprised and didn’t dare touch Sherlock the way he usually would – stroking his hair or resting his hand on his friend’s arm - even though the man had just initiated touch.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but apparently the Fates were watching over John for once in his life, because the Consulting Detective let out a long, suffering sigh but surrendered with a grumbled “Alright, John”.  Then he stood up and started walking in the direction of his bedroom, John following suit.
John gave a half smile at that, amused at Sherlock’s response. “You know, if Lestrade solved all of the crimes himself, you would pretty much lose your job. “ Sherlock just shot him a half-hearted glare and said nothing. John smiled, as this was an argument they had often. He knew that Sherlock knew that most of they got most of their cases because of Lestrade, and he was sure that his friend was thankful for that. In his own, mad way.
When he climbs up the stairs to his appartment, one step at a time, there's an echo of the word playing in his mind.
"Who is Charon?” the Consulting Detective asked, looking somewhere between amused and annoyed because John had interrupted his experiment. The blonde just chuckled.
Slowly, John made his way upstairs, hot tea in his hand and a smile on his face. Even though Sherlock didn’t get his jokes – or maybe especially
But well, here's the next chapter, I really hope you enjoy! It's a Little different from the rest, with kinda insecure!John and sliiiightly touch-averse Sherlock.
It's one of the very first cases in which Sherlock assists the police. It's an easy one, clearly the husband has murdered his wife because he'd been cheating on her and wanted to get rid of her. Sherlock says as much, after not even ten minutes on the crime scene, and he smiles a bit when he sees the surprised faces of the detectives, wonder all over them.
With that, John turned around again, took the kettle from the stove and filled his cup with steaming water, totally ignoring Sherlock’s confused expression. “And in what way would I benefit from you eating pomegranates?”, the Consulting Detective asked, brows furrowing. His friend’s words didn’t make sense today. Was it because John was too tired because of the late meeting with Lestrade? But no, Sherlock knew that even when John was exhausted, he was still able to form logical sentences with a decipherable meaning behind them. But what was behind this utter nonsense if not John’s tiredness?
John felt his heart clench uncomfortably at the thought. But then again, when had Sherlock ever been hesitant to speak his mind? If the whole thing really had made him uncomfortable or was unwanted, he’d already have said something. So what was it then?
"I'll take a shower.", he says, looking straight at John who's still looking confused and vaguely concerned.
“You should really take better care of yourself”, John mumbled quietly, mostly to himself, when they reached Sherlock`s bedroom door. “I couldn’t stand seeing you get hurt. After all, you’re the centaur of my universe.”
The blonde pushed his plate away from him, making a lot of noise in the process, and woke his friend from his stupor. “Do you want tea?” John asked, smiling a bit, as he carried the plates to the kitchen. Sherlock huffed at John’s back.
“No, sorry to disappoint. We don’t have any cases currently, as you deemed the last two as not worth your time.  Go back to your experiment; I’ll be upstairs, reading a bit.” Sherlock scoffed. “Those cases were hardly even a five, why should I waste my time with them?” With a slight shake of his head Sherlock turned back to his experiment, ignoring the small chuckle John gave at his facial expression.
“What did you want to say?” asked John, a little amused. “I was saying that I`m fine and really don’t need to sleep anymore.” Sherlock replied flatly, looking up at John in an almost defiant matter.
John and Sherlock had just come home from a meeting with Lestrade, and John was exhausted. The meeting had gone rather well – Sherlock had insulted the DI and his team only four times – but it had started late and ended at half past twelve, and John felt drained. He hadn’t eaten in more that six hours and since he knew that Sherlock hadn’t eaten for even longer, he had started to cook once they had gotten home.
John settled back into the chair thinking of how to answer. What did that even mean? How do you describe a friendship?
"I see your waistline may have unnecessarily shrunk while your ego was equally and unnecessarily made larger," Sherlock replied heading to his chair. "You already know I liked it quite a lot.
"Work, alcohol and then more work and more alcohol. All coupled with cutting people out of my life that reminded me of what was now over. Greg, Molly, Mrs. Hudson."
"Maybe not." He lied outright. "If he knew he'd say something. I'm always really careful. It's not like the alcohol, you can't tell. He can't tell. He suspects. I'll give you that, he suspects."
"You didn't lose me." John said ignoring the rest and pulling the man into an embrace. "Quiet down now, you're ok. I think we just gave each other an accidental fright that's all."
"I really am glad you're doing well. The last time I saw you I...well, I was worried. Sherlock and I had remained in contact and I didn't know what the next message from him might say."
"Well, maybe we can have just a day or two to sit on it. With just us knowing. Plus, I want you to have a ring too."
"No, you want to pretend as though you let all of this go. That's not healing, that's malignancy. Malignancy only feels better in the short term. This hurts, yes, because resurrection, I imagine would hurt. You want to resurrect, you want to come back to life. There is a difference in acknowledging your anger and justifying the actions that sprung from it. You can do one and not the other. And you can be angry John but you can't make your home there."
"So much better." They kissed briefly and after a moment John turned his attention to Sherlock's neck.
He went in search of books on anger management next...but not before adding a few of the ones that rubbed him the wrong way to his cart as well.
John had tried to plan for every eventuality but he'd been stupid enough to miss this one. What this would do to Sherlock's career.
and I couldn't write a mystery if I had the ghost of Dame Agatha Christie whispering in one ear and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the other. This was just to put a little interesting tale out there for Sherlock and John to get into. :)
Though once of twice he had bristled at the Three Continents nickname he had, as a sexual world traveler, developed some finesse that came only with a great deal of experience.  One of the things he'd learned and gotten extraordinarily good at was slowing things down.
"Ok, that's good, I think that's very good. It concerned me that you weren't looking out for your own mental health and well being and it seems as though you are. I'd be happier if you had regular appointments with Ella but for now, this is good." Hanah added with a smile. "Now, is there anything you need to say to John? If so, say it directly, say it now."
Sherlock didn't usually speak in sentence fragments. I knew there must have been a small part of his brain short circuiting but I decided to tease him about it later.
"Is this what it's like when I go quiet and focus on my inner thoughts?" Sherlock asked. "Because this silence is interminable."
"I say this with all sincerity," he began as he looked down at the sleeping child in his arms. "It was my pleasure."
He started spanking him again, slowly at first, watching John wince and groan and wince and gasp with each strike as he worked his hand up and down his erection.
"An open conversation with your partner is always a good place to start. And he is your partner, John. Long before you decided to become an item he was your partner. Have you at all discussed your childhood, your father?"
"Happy? For the first time in my life..." He began. "I'm only looking ahead. It sounds so simple, so trivial but it's huge. I've always been looking over my shoulder and that's at best. Sometimes I've stood with my back to what's in front of me."
"Sort of...but the alcohol didn't do that for me. You know how they say it's a depressant but they mean in terms of the central nervous system? For some people, it's also an emotional depressant. It puts them in this really negative headspace. I was never a happy drunk or a relaxed drunk. Honestly, it always made me feel worse. But I kept chasing it. Daft, really. So, that's not how you felt?"
"If sexuality, desire, need, want was a...a faucet, for lack of a better metaphor, I've turned it off...at some point. I don't remember when."
Ten minutes later they were naked in bed, both lying on their sides, kissing gently. John was nervous and had been since Hanah had suggested this but he'd also been champing at the bit to try.
"John, I was so worried, you must promise to never, ever do something like that again. I know I'm not your mother but if I had lost you..."
He quickly removed his ring hand from sight, feeling embarrassed, as always, when someone called attention to it.
But Sherlock had been suffering too. The detective had wrung himself out at the behest of his wife on John's behalf. He had dragged himself on hands and knees through hell and had almost died in the process.
"We hope by the end of your stay here, John, that you'll agree with us. Now, are you currently suicidal?"
This is boring. That's awful to say but it is. I'm bored. Not with her, not Mary. Just...the sitting. I'm so bored of the sitting.
He thought but didn't voice aloud. Still, he immediately regretted it. It was rude and uncharitable.
Closing his eyes, John enjoyed the sensation silently for moment upon moment until Sherlock's sudden cough jarred him.
"Yes." He said simply. "Though I never gave it much thought. I nipped sexual attraction in the bud. But some of it is coming back to me now. I'll explore any implications later when I have the time. But anything that doesn't involve you is strictly academic at this point. I have no desire for anyone but you."
"Or," John offered. "You could go back to sleep while I head to my meeting and when I come back I'll make you blueberry pancakes."
He threw the first of a few tantrums when we were halfway there, deducing and shaming the driver and pushing him to a point of such agitation that he almost kicked us out. When we arrived I dragged him out of the car, into the building, up the stairs and into the flat.
John planted his lips to the crown of Sherlock's head first kissing him and then just inhaling his scent. He felt good. Today had been a good day from start to finish and he felt hopeful. He felt that just maybe he might look back on this moment one year, five years, ten years from now and be able to say this was one of those days that everything changed for the better. This was the day he left so much shit and baggage and unhappiness behind.
"He didn't break my heart. He just...didn't let me down easy. He made sure to emphasize our distance whenever we were outside of our bedroom. He teased and bullied me quite mercilessly and used to whip the other boys up into a frenzy with it as well. They hated me and he lead the charge. But when we were alone together he was all kindness and gentleness. Kind words and caresses. And I was too confused to know what to do. He made it clear he wasn't interested in a boyfriend. He didn't even want to be mates. But I thought...I asked him, well, we're at least friends, aren't we? I stressed the word friends, at least trying to get him to admit that what we did in bed mattered. He shrugged and said "Yes, we're friends. But that's all we are." I confess, that's why I introduced you as such when we three met at the bank. I wanted him to know...even though it wasn't true. I wanted him to think it was. He caught my meaning. I'm sorry about that."
"Mycroft, if I feel myself slipping, if I start to fall, I won't grab onto him. You won't have a chance to get to me because I will make myself disappear. I will pack up and vanish from his life forever. I promise. Never again, hmm? Alright? Never again."
But slowly the color and joy of it all had drained out of his world and he hated himself for it. He started passing her off to whichever eager woman in his life would like to take her for an afternoon, an evening, a weekend...or more.
"Now, I want you to tell me if there's something you don't like. Something I'm doing wrong. If you wanted it harder or softer or slower or faster. If it's a bit too much teeth. I've never done this before either so, please, tell me what you want."
The strange thing was her description could have been from any number of times. Nothing about it stood out as anything especially noteworthy to him. It was all part of a cycle that by that point he was very accustomed. Trying to separate one beating from another was a fruitless action.
"You were happy because you're moving back in with Sherlock which I agree is a positive step. Between now and the time you're released I want you to focus on things that you can do for yourself that make you happy as well."
“Is there something beyond devastated? That would qualify. Logically I knew he wouldn’t take such a drastic step unless he needed to but...but I was so hurt. I mean, maybe I could have helped. Maybe we could have left together, I thought. I loved him. He was the only family I really had left and he just abandoned me. At least that’s how I felt at the time.”
His phone buzzed in rapid succession from where he'd left it on the sofa cushion. Walking over he picked it up and saw there were two missed messages.
"Ok." She said. "Ok, maybe later. John..." She started then sighed and glanced away from him. He was in bed and she was sitting on the edge of the mattress by his feet.
Everything felt as though it were piling on top of him, swamping him, sinking him. He tried to escape it by sleeping but was met with the most horrible dreams. Back in the forest, always back in the forest running from assailants unknown, running from the trees themselves. And every time he saw what seemed like a break in the dense woods, a scrape of lights, it closed up. The closer he got the more quickly it vanished. And when he turned around everything had rearranged itself and he was even more lost than before. The trees howled and moaned and whenever he had his back to them he was certain he heard them creaking with broken movements, slouching toward him. The ground was loose in some places, eager to give way beneath his steps. But it was viscous in others, and when he tried to lift his foot the mud and the grass and the leaves and the weeds would cling like molasses or porridge. He grew exhausted. He fell, again and again, bruising his face, slicing open his hands on the sharp, dead land. He lost his balance one last time, slamming down hard over a petrified tree, the bulk of it hitting him in the stomach, knocking the breath from his lungs. He lay there helpless and started to feel the trickle of heretofore unseen water dampening his fingers, his jumper, his pants. The water started coming faster graduating from a trickle to a stream. His face was resting in a pile of earthen debris leaves and muddied ground as he felt the water strike his face. It tasted bitter, alkaline on his tongue, it burned his nostrils and his lips started to tingle. Soil full of radionuclides and strontium, cesium, and plutonium, thick and heavy and polluting and deadly. He tried to raise his head but couldn't. He didn't have the strength. He tried to roll away, to at least get on his back, but he couldn't do that either. He was helpless. Utterly helpless and all he could do was lie there and sputter as the water rose and rose and he eventually started to drown. His last thought be he lost consciousness in the dream and returned to consciousness in real life was that no one would ever find him. The Red Forest would reclaim his body and swallow him up. He would decompose, slowly mummified, petrified, calcified, forever frozen in his own personal nuclear winter. He woke up gasping for breath, clawing at his own throat, (clawing so deeply as it turned out that he left three large scratches on either side), half of Sherlock's name on his lips.
He watched him a little closer as he talked, watched his lips form words, watched the skin around his eyes crinkle as he smiled and he did smile quite a bit.
"Well, it makes me feel like a bloody teenager. Not to mention the fact this isn't just about me telling him I'm...bi. It's about saying I...I want us to give it a go. He could say no."
"Maybe I'll take it up as a second career." He said with a smile. "Eat your dinner before it gets cold."
"Good, that's really good, I'm glad." John said before clearing his throat before he grew over emotional. "Um, well, I haven't had a chance to get back to my editor yet but I will tomorrow. Oh and the check from Squire, Squire, Hackerman & Dudley finally cleared. I checked your account."
The kissing was amazing and only got better and better. Sherlock not only liked kissing but he was good at it in a way that John didn't quite understand. To the best of his knowledge he'd never had a partner; male or female and never had anyone to consistently practice with so how was he able to do that thing with his tongue that made John nearly forget his own name?
"Well, yes of course." He said his brow furrowing. I could see his mind working as he tried to ratchet his thinking down to ordinary terms. Just what was it dull John had assumed was happening. "What else could I have meant?"
Throughout the entire affair, Sherlock was moaning the most lovely, filthy, erotic things as his back curved and arched. John's only regret was that he couldn't see his face as he came, those cheeks pinked from the exertion, his lips parted, eyes closed except for the occasional flutter of his lids. Sherlock was practically cherubic in the throes of orgasm but he could always see him next time. When it was all finally, finally ebbing, John felt Sherlock begin to pitch forward clearly looking to rest on the bed, but a hand placed on his abdomen stopped him.
St. Lucian was old. He'd been expecting, perhaps, one of those newer model churches. The ones that from the outside could be a dentist's office or a museum or a place to rent vacuums cleaners. This was one of those ancient goliath's with fortified brick walls, a steeple, a rusty looking bell, grotesques, and turrets. He stepped inside and cursed himself for being nervous. It was stupid. He'd done this before. Nearly every fucking day for the past three months even. Why was he going all weak sister now? He took a steadying breath and stopped in front of the bulletin board.
"Had I not been so diligent in my pursuit of compartmentalization of thought and deduction and want, my desire for you would have driven me to distraction. Especially if I decided to dwell too long on those little 'Ahh Ahh Ahh' noises before you come."
"Yeah! That's it. Hypnic jerk, I feel like just as I'm starting to relax a hypnic jerk occurs. And the only way to fight it off is to focus on you and not me."
Sherlock broke into a wide smile and nearly hopped to his feet. John kept his eyes riveted to his face. His face. His perfect face.
"You told me, not long ago, that I should drop my armor in our flat but especially in our bedroom. Don't you think you should as well?" Sherlock asked.
"Mrs. Hudson, the paper?" Sherlock asked again. "Oh, and how did you know? You're not on Twitter now too, are you?"
"You're not." John said softly as he switched off the lamp, glad the darkness could now hide his smile. "Please, stay as long as you like."
"John..." He said quietly and John felt those eyes roaming over him. They lingered on his face, no doubt making complicated calculations and estimations unimaginable.
"I sometimes start to sweat, get short of breath...just your run-of-the-mill panic attack, I suppose."
Without giving either of them time to agree or protest he left the room the door shutting behind him.
As the Family weekend drew near the mood of the entire places changed. Everyone seemed more antsy, more upset, touchier, nervous.
"There have been times in the past where I've stashed certain things away in various places around Baker Street should I need them."
"Did you think it was ok, to do that? To piss all over my memory of you?. I didn't care about the papers, or the reporters or the knobheads taunting me in the street. Your suicide would have caused that anyway, that was completing the narrative. I get that. What I care about is that you tried to put it in my head. How dare you. How dare you do that us and do that to me."
When he started to buck against his finger John had the impression that it had taken even Sherlock by surprise when after a few firm pumps from John's hand he started to come.
Sherlock had his head turned to the side, resting on the pillow and his eyes shut but not as tightly as he imagined. Good, that was good, it meant the relaxation was taking hold. Without any particular focus on what his hands were doing John got a bit lost in his face for awhile. The beauty of it and the serenity. He rarely if ever got to see him this face, at ease, forehead un-creased, mouth a bit slack, lips, parted. Still, just still and enjoying being still.
“I’m sorry. I lack the language and experience to couch this in nicer terms. I can only compare you to the fleeting feeling I've been chasing all my life. But you're not fleeting and I don't have to chase. It occurs to me now you mentioned earlier you’d spent your time chasing the way you felt with Duck. The both of us...always were running."
"I'm still adjusting to the idea that I'm going to be lucky enough to spend my pensioner years here with you. It is an amazing gift, Sherlock. Thank you."
"It's thicker because your arse doesn't self-lubricate. And I'm putting it on my fingers because I need to get you ready first."
"Ok, well, um, I just wanted to say a few words. First of all, thank you for coming, all of you. After Mary died-"
But John ignored him and instead lay flat on the bed between his legs and took him in his mouth. Sherlock hadn't gone soft but he was flagging a bit and John intended to turn that around. He acknowledged the ragged and lusty gasp from Sherlock by placing a hand on his chest and gently telegraphing that he wanted him to remain as he was. He took his time. Slow, deliberate movement of his lips and tongue until all that wonderful precum was flowing again. His own cock was pressed firmly against the bed and he wasn't above humping the mattress to relieve some of the pressure. His fingers returned to Sherlock's arsehole just to check, just to make sure he was still slick and open and ready.  He could have stayed there, he would have been happy to make Sherlock come with his cock in his mouth and his finger in his arse. He would have been happy to fuck the mattress until he orgasmed hard against it. But they weren't there for that. Not this time.
Fine. A mistake. Fine. I could accept that mostly because I had little choice. I was not going to plead my case before Sherlock Holmes.
He went to Sherlock's Twitter first. Nothing. His blog. Nothing there as well. As best as he could tell he had no new online activity. He scanned newspapers, searched for Lestrade's name and words like "murder" and "unsolved" and phrases like "no leads" and "seek the public's help". But there was nothing. Nothing at all.
But he'd already dropped the phone, it became too difficult for him to hold as the convulsions started. He pitched forward from his chair landing on the floor, his body tight, alternating only between contracting and contracting harder. His legs shot out knocking into the table sending the empty wine bottle and the glass crashing to the floor. The ringing in his ears, now accompanied by a pain in his head was unbearable and he might have whimpered if he could but his throat was tight and dry.
And as the two times before Sherlock's hand danced over his skin, loosening his muscles, prying firmly at his flesh.
"I believe I'm an alcoholic. That's a quantifiable medical condition. But do I believe I have a problem, no. A problem would be a disruption to a life. I don't feel that I have a life anymore. There's nothing to disrupt."
"He's a recovering alcoholic who hopes to stay that way, you know, the recovering bit. He's tentatively happy. He's scared. He's in love. And he wants to be a good man, a good dad, a good boyfriend, a good doctor and he wants to do it all without ever touching alcohol again. That's who John Watson is."
"Good. So...I think we should have sex. I assumed you would want to penetrate or be the top, as I believed it's referred to. However, as you also mentioned the purchase of Fleet's I may have misjudged."
"Yeah, I understand, Sherlock. Me neither. Look, you're worrying. But maybe, for the first time in a long time, we have something that the two of us don't have to worry about, ok? I mean, we've done a lot of the hard bits. Living together, arguing, getting through a fight, not infringing on one another's space too much. When you really think about, we survived a breakup, you and me. Not to mention a marriage. Think of it that way."
"No, I know. That's not what I meant when I said you shouldn't have to, I meant it's not enough. I want to change it. Grow it."
. I know I shouldn't go looking for logic in a movie about dinosaurs but that's a thing that bothered me (and still does, sorry). Uff.
John’s train of thought was interrupted by Sherlock turning on the couch, so that he now faced the blonde. Slowly, Sherlock opened one eye, blinking twice and then he opened the other one and shot up into a sitting position.
He only knew for sure that he’d continue flirting with Sherlock, now that he had taken a liking to it.
Sherlock had to use all his willpower to tug on his arm sleeve, a simple gesture that he knew John would interpret correctly. John hesitated, looking at Sherlock questioningly, and when Sherlock didn't change his mind John stood up and helped Sherlock pull his arms out of his sleeves. The cloth fell between Sherlock's back and the couch, and Sherlock swallowed thickly, his heart beating harder. He sat up a bit straighter when John pulled the shirt out from behind him.
"The rat will kill you?" John asks, pushing himself off the wall to stand freely. The man nods, and John nods slowly, taking in the information. "Is it alright if I sit across from you?" The man eyes one of the two armchairs placed a few feet away in front of Lestrade's desk, and his lips tighten into a thin line. He gives a sharp nod, not once taking his eye off John as John follows the wall and then tugs the chair a little further back and sits down.
"So it was pretty bad, wasn't it?" John was staring into his soul, searching for something. Sherlock wasn't sure what John was looking for, as that concerned him. It also frustrated him. "How bad was it, Sherlock?"
Captain Watson deciphers the note and finds the next lead, and forges a deal with a stowaway the crew locked in the brig.
"I want what I've always wanted since I left, John." Sherlock shifted his hand underneath John's so their hands could interlock. "I want to be here, with you, in whatever way that makes you comfortable."
Finally looking down at the piece of paper Peter handed him, John studied what was written. The words on the page were hand written, and at first they didn't make much sense, but the longer John looked it over the more he noticed a pattern. Peter was watching him intently, lips slightly parted in a smile. John glanced over and offered the boy a nod of approval.
"What if I want to touch you?" John whispered, ghosting his hand over Sherlock's injured side carefully.
"Bubbals," she clapped excitedly and watched Sherlock poke his laptop and move a weirdly shaped ball around on the table, pressing on it with a finger every so often. When she looked back, The Bubbal Game was in front of them.
John sighed heavily, a tinge of a growl at the end of it, and Sherlock cautiously glanced over. John was utterly furious, jaw clenched and glaring across the room at the unlit fireplace.
"Sounds a bit nicer than 'rest of your life'," John confessed, expression carefully blank, "doesn't it?"
"It's around." He murmurs. "'Round, 'round, 'round. It's always around, always listening." He looks back up at John with wide, crazed eyes and a warning tone to his voice. "You have to listen or it hurts you."
"If we can shift the mental instability, even if it's just a tiny bit," John paused, trying not to sound too hopeful. "I mean, he was coherent for a second, there. I could see it in his eyes."
"Not at all. I firmly believe I'm the only London doctor that finds chasing after scalpel-wielding orderlies preying on their patients to be a fun break from the dullness of routine life." Sherlock snorted softly. "But I don't buy that you're a sociopath. At least not anymore."
"... wouldn't have come back to me." John looked down at Sherlock's chest, seeing the circular scar where Mary's bullet pierced him. "At the very least, not
"And now you and Ms. Hudson are taking care of my child because her father isn't strong enough." John scowled, starting to shake with emotion. "Isn't
"It's fine," John said, sounding to himself like he was speaking through water. Sherlock was still rambling about an excuse, something about knowing John's shoulder was aching from the case yesterday and helping Sherlock today, but John wasn't paying much attention. "Sherlock, it's fine."
Following John's impromptu interview with "Oliver", Sherlock and Lestrade join him outside the office to discuss what Oliver said and what to do next.
It took a moment for John to understand, and the panic that came with the doubt of what Sherlock wanted caused him to shakily supply, "Only if you want to. I'd like to - I mean, I want to be closer to you and, uh - and I don't think I want to be with... anyone... else." John trailed off, realizing he was rambling. Sherlock watched the strangely vulnerable doctor with a blank expression, but behind the mask Sherlock was struggling to comprehend the situation.
John quickly searched the room and, thankfully, by the time he was glancing around hoping to find something to bound the man with, he could hear sirens in the distance. He looked over at Sherlock, glanced down at the man who was pale from blood loss, and jogged past him and over to Sherlock. The man wasn't going to get anywhere anytime soon, John reasoned. Besides, Sherlock was more important.
"Um..." Rosie rubbed her eyes with her sleeve, and John decided it was best to let her get away with it this time rather than chide her. "I like bubbles."
"You pay my crew and I for services rendered and never breathe a word of us, including anything from the layout of the ship to the names of the crewmen, to another soul. If you agree to these terms, we will feed you and keep you unharmed until we reach the harbor of London, in which you will be escorted to your residence by either myself or Peter to collect our payment. If you don't agree, well... It doesn't take a
"Alright, get comfy." John told Sherlock, removing his fingers. Eagerly, Sherlock flopped onto his back, spreading his legs for John. John couldn't help but smile and slip into place between Sherlock's thighs, leaning over the detective's torso to kiss him.
The tall man was staring only at the ground now, beginning to shuffle his way backwards. The driver had completely dismissed him now, focused on the friendly customer who would no doubt pay. It was hopeless.
The truth however, is usually not what either party thinks it is. In this case, the truth involves a particularly rainy night, a single coach, and an inadequate overcoat.
The last few days were a blur, and Sherlock felt as terrible as he looked. His dark hair was matted and much to long, falling about his face in wet strands. A thick black coat was wrapped around him firmly, his only solace on the nights he was unable to return to his flat and ended up sleeping it off in an alley.
Tonight though, he had a single thought. He needed to return home. He didn’t know what drove him so. Perhaps it was the drugs - an obsessive thought that had wormed its way into his skull and proceeded to push through piles of grey matter to the front of his brain, squashing any other impulses that arose.
Jumping away from the couch, he gathered up his hat and coat, abandoning his walking stick in his haste to leave the flat.
Of course there was the residual awkwardness, at least on John's end, that came from moving into a space that felt like it belonged so entirely to someone else.
He felt violently ill, the high receding along with his boundless energy. He wasn’t quite sure where he was headed, but he was sure that he didn’t have the money for a coach. It grew more and more likely that tonight he would stay in this unknown neighborhood, and wake to the light of day just as lost and penniless as before.
He heard the slightly slurred voice call out to him as he walked away. Something about sharing the carriage ride, but it was all to easy to simply let his mind get washed away with the rainwater swirling down the street as he wandered off again into the night, following the swirling pools of water as they too rushed down the street in search of a gutter.
“What is going on here sirs?” He mumbled, in a very amenable way if you’d ask him, still a distance from the pair.
No longer in motion, the figure was no less imposing but slightly more pitiful. He has stopped by the driver, just slightly in front of the carriage but not yet close enough that Gregory was worried that he would grab him. The man swayed where he stood, uncertain what to do with his hands as they fiddled with the sleeves of his coat.
nervous - John reached the other side of the couch and crouched down, shaking the man's shoulder with the intent to wake him.
John didn't know very much about Sherlock Holmes yet, but this flat seemed to him like a perfect reflection of the man's soul. Parts of it were organized extensively. There were beakers in the cupboard that seemed to be arranged both by size and glass thickness, impeccably clean, yet there were dishes in the sink and sprawling all over the counter, most with dried chunks of food and many that were busy cultivating colonies of mold.
It was true that John was the most rambunctious man in the place, but wasn’t it just his luck that he should have been singled out amongst his peers, who had been nearly as loud and disruptive as he. It seemed like ever since he has gotten back to England, he has had nothing but poor luck.
"Of course. I'll change and be right in." He said with an obliging tone that would have struck John as so odd months ago. Now, it just sounded normal.
"Because I'm not going to have her turn out to be a weird little ponce like you." He said affectionately. "No offense, of course."
"You take to writing. I'm not sure if you're aware. That why I gave you that book. You know, one amid the stack of books I gave you as you left The Location. The stack you haven't touched." She said with a smile.
"No, I sought these assignments out. I only got back Thursday evening and Mrs. Hudson promptly gave me your letter as I entered the flat. I read it in the hall, packed a bag and then made arrangements to come here."
I'm in rehab. I am a worthless, drunken piece of garbage just like you were. All that talk, all those times you used to ask me "So, you think you're better than me, eh, Johnny?" Turns out, I'm not. I never was.
"I honestly don't know. I don't expect this to help me, I don't even know if I want it to help me. But it may help my best friend...my emergency contact...we used to be best friends, at least."
So he did. He considered the trajectory and everything within him, save his fear, was telling him it was the right time.
"Thank you, John." Harry said quietly. "I feel, well, things make a bit more sense now, don't they?"
The nightmare came back to him with horrific clarity. At Mary's side, holding her hand. Barely able to even plead with her to stay because doing so would be accepting the knowledge that she was leaving. Right then. Right now.
He had several visitors over the days that followed his return to lucidity. Harry and Clara had called and asked if he'd wanted to see Rosie but he immediately said no. Other than that he hadn't said much. Mostly he just offered apologies.
The third avenue he'd yet to attempt. That was buying directly from someone off the street. It would always be a last resort but he had to know, in a jam, in a rush, that he could do this. Still, he was putting it off.
no more coming. Sherlock was starting to become a word that was synonymous with blueballs in John's mind. If it were anyone else, anyone at all John would have thought they were deliberately teasing him and doing a dreadful job of it. After all, the purpose of teasing was to whip someone into a frenzy, to get them just to that point and then to finally give them what they want. What you want them to have. The point was not to drive someone half mad from desire.
At least he had the privacy to cry. Which he did. He'd never been much a crier. He'd gotten smacked around for it as a kid and one certainly didn't cry in the army. You also didn't cry around Sherlock Holmes. Well, not the Sherlock Holmes that he
"Are you saying I'm like a drug to you?" He said with a soft chuckle as Sherlock slid his hand beneath his shirt.
For whatever reason, a reason he hoped to discover as their relationship progressed Sherlock was afraid. Afraid of failure, afraid of disappointment, afraid of intimacy, afraid of his own body or being so close to someone else's body. Any of these possibilities seemed likely. He knew he hadn't ever had sex before. Mycroft had hinted of it long before Sherlock had confessed it to him in a quiet voice that strained to keep embarrassment at bay.
"No, no, John I'm not ill. I...I'm doing this all wrong. How on earth does someone manage to get this wrong." He said running a hand through his curls.
John opened his mouth to speak but faltered and Sherlock didn't seem to have anything on the tip of his tongue either.
"You're uncomfortable with him touching you in bed." She continued. "Your focus during sex is lopsided, uneven, lasered in wholly on pleasing him. You have difficulty focusing when you're not in charge. I guessed at that one, but feel free to tell me I'm wrong."
That was all the invitation his friend needed to resume and John craned his neck exposing more of it for his mates lips.
"Well, you know, if it did. It's not as if I think Harry and Clara would put up a fuss, they love you. It's just...it would make me feel better. And you can't exactly change your name, you're a brand."
"But I did. I lost you somewhere in these few rooms. If not lost you then lost some opportunity upon which I cannot place my finger." He said into his ear not fighting the hug in the least.
"I did find a minor diversion but it was unpredictable, ill-chosen and ultimately did not end as I had hoped."
"I realize that was probably a terribly improper response considering the situation." He said finally.
"Of course." She said quickly before handing him a bottle of water and a bottle of orange juice. He downed the juice first and then after a moment unscrewed the top on the water.
"Funny you should ask that, we just spoke before I came out here. Yeah, she agreed to come." James replied.
The suddenness of seeing the three dots indicating a reply was being written made John's heart leap.
From there he ran his fingers and his lips all over his lover's body, getting to know the smooth planes and the rough rises and falls. Scars he didn't know existed, some healed some new, revealed themselves and the topographical map in John's head expanded. The 15 minutes went by quickly and as the alarm was sounding he was arriving at Sherlock's old track mark scars. It had occurred to him that despite the fact of his lover usually, until recently, wearing a t-shirt to bed, his arms had always been bare. He'd ignored it. Subconsciously, sure, but still purposefully. And he didn't want to ignore any part of Sherlock. Every inch of him deserved to be loved. Especially the angry marks that told of collapsed veins, binges, need and pain.
"Fair enough. First off, congratulations on your 30 days. That's quite a milestone, John. I want to tell you this isn't just a triumph of not drinking. I have seen you grow over the past month as an individual and I hope you have as well."
I shoved my hands into my pocket not willing to meet sweet, kind Mrs. Hudson with an obvious bulge in my trousers.
"Unnecessary, John. There's only a little more than an hour left.  Besides, I enjoy driving anywhere that isn't London."
Your friendship...your...love changed my life. I was just about ready to retreat from the world and happy to do so before you blew in.
Sherlock was silent, oddly silent when he entered. He was cleaning up, putting the dishes in the sink and the trash in the bins.
"But 50% of the 12 Steps involved God. Now, I was married in a church and my daughter was christened in the Church and I say all the wildly inappropriate blasphemes that everyone else says but...I don't believe in God. I don't know how to believe in God. I don't want to believe in God. And I certainly don't want to surrender to him.
He sighed, frustrated with her but more so with himself for having gotten so far from his point. He needed her to agree to this.
John's sentence trailed off, but Sherlock knew what he was asking. They both knew that John, if given the chance, could deduce what had caused Sherlock's scars. They were distinctive, unique to the shape of a whip's lashing strike. Sherlock wondered if he could stall, somehow, but he knew John wouldn't let him even try, now. Besides, he would see the scars as soon as Sherlock's shirt was off.
"I could leave the stab would," Sherlock let out a content sigh, mumbling, "but otherwise this is how it was supposed to be."
"Jesus, Sherlock..." John reached out and gently pushed on Sherlock's shoulder, making him lean back against the couch. "The bastard's dead, right?"
Much like they just had done, the two kissed and caressed for a few long moments before continuing to undress. They took their time with each other, learning and exploring, even sharing stories. Sherlock noticed the little scars and marks left in John's skin that hid beneath his undershirts during the night and his jumpers during the day, and John told the stories he could remember that accompanied them. Most of them were from the war: grenade debris, a bullet grazing, some small burn marks from hot metal casings that got underneath his clothing somehow. But a couple came from studying at Bart's, such as a shimmering white line across his bicep and a larger, jagged line along his forearm. John explained that the first was a pocketknife that a drug addict pulled on him while on shift, and the second was received while treating a patient that had been impaled through the hip by a piece of metal during a car crash. Sherlock was fascinated - it was as if he was studying the wounds of a victim during a case, but the story was more personal and intriguing because it was John. It was a part of John's story that Sherlock hadn't been there to experience alongside the soldier.
