"Don't apologize, Sherlock. It's fine." John whispered as he grabbed the sheets and wrapped them over the both of them. He curled up next to Sherlock and kissed his chest once or twice. "If you want to apologize for something, apologize for how red and sore my ass is going to be." He chuckled.
"No, I'll get a ring too. But you get to pick it out for me." Sherlock yawned, moving a bit closer to John. Not enough to where his body heat would pose a problem but close enough where John would be able to feel he was there. He continued to stroke his chest as began to drift off. "Goodnight, My beautiful fiancé." He whispered before sleep finally took him as well. John simply mumbled already dropping off. The last thing he fully registered was the need to be closer to Sherlock and his vain attempts to wake enough to scoot towards him. Then sleep took him.
would you take that?! Why would you go back to drugs?!" A few tears splashed down over them as John returned his grip to Sherlock's shirt and pulled him up. He threw him hard on the couch, making himself an angry wall between Sherlock and the doors. There was no way John was letting Sherlock out of the flat. Not unless he was dead. The silence stretched for a long moment as the two of them glared at each other. Both their chests heaving for breath, anger overriding their rational thoughts and forcing down the overwhelming concern they normally housed for the others’ feelings. Pure adrenaline and anger coursing through their minds and bodies. "And I already said you're not fucking leaving. You colossal prick!" John was ready for war and angry enough to forget how he felt for the person on the other side of it. As Sherlock was tossed into the couch the room spun violently, keening around him in a flurry of colors. He grabbed his forehead and shut his eyes. His stomach lurched and his anger grew. This was John's fault. John was ruining his high. His precisely calculated and rather expensive high.
"No it doesn't." Sherlock snapped and he stormed off to the bedroom, only stopping himself from slamming the door because of the boys. He undid his shirt, throwing it angrily on the floor before flopping himself in bed. Laying face down and scowling into the mattress.
"I always worry about you." He said softly. "I have to because any minute something can happen that might take you away. Because you don't worry about yourself the way you should." He said it as firmly as he could, pain showing in his eyes. A deep breath in...
"I have a better idea, I can make you something back at the flat. How does cheese cake sound?" Sherlock asked suddenly with a warm smile. He started to rub John's leg gently. If he had been considering everything the way he normally did instead of being overly concerned with the desert uniform in John's closet he might have realized that though his attempt was a good one he'd forgotten on important fact.
"Yes," He heard himself answer John. His voice flat, lacking emotion completely. John tensed but he didn’t notice.
"Cocoa is good with peppermint." Hamish said, giving praise to his cousin. "We are gonna be bestest friends." He promised.
"We'll build a fort and I'll order us some take away." He promised as the car came to a slow stop. "We're home." He said to Hamish, letting him crawl on top of his shoulders as they got out of the car. "Duck your head." He ordered happily as they stepped through the front door. "Sh, we have to be quiet or we'll wake Nanny Hudson." He added as Hamish giggled. They walked up to the flat door and he opened it. "Duck," He added again as he stepped through the door. "Come on, Monkey. Get down so you can help build the fort." He helped Hamish climb down and he laughed as Hamish began pulling out the couch cushions. "Wait for Papa to get here." He said as Sherlock walked through the door, the case file already open in his hands.
"Look Mycroft, no offense but it is none of your business what our relationship is. I have a patient to care for. Where is the detox kit I asked for?" He turned and glared at the elder Holmes.
"It's not just about that Sherlock, you can't give all your money to Victor." Mycroft sighed and sank down in Sherlock's chair.
"Do you think you can tell me where the main source of the pain is?" John took a deep breath and actually tried to look up at the doctor properly but found his vision was somewhat blurred.
"Victor, I'm glad you came." John said softly following him and Sherlock inside. He got Victor a glass of water before opening the kit slowly. "I am a doctor as I am sure you know. I have some medicine here that can help with the withdrawals and coming down. It has to be administered via injection and we should give you a dose now. Then if you are feeling nausea I can give you something for that in a bit. I can let you give yourself the injections if you want but I will prepare them for you, in front of you, and monitor you while you administer it. You are welcome to look over the med kit if you want first." John stepped back his hands at his sides in a clear nonthreatening position and the med kit lay open.  Victor was surprised by the amount of trust John was giving him. His eyes cautiously taking in the man and the medical kit before seemingly making a decision to focus on the kit itself. He didn't see anything in there that he knew could be used to kill him so he lay back on the couch and tried to relax.
"I'm sure." Victor mumbled. He really wasn't sure but he figured if he wanted to get clean cutting ties with everyone who had some sort of relationship with drugs was the best thing to do. Plus he wanted John to understand he was committed to this now. That he was accepting not just Sherlock's rules and money, but John's concern and help. "Just do it, Johnny boy." He said as he stood to get the kettle that was now boiling. Sherlock sat up on the couch not being able to stop himself from deduce every movement Victor made and seeing how much pain he was in. But there was something else there he couldn't deduce, something he couldn't understand. There was a softness, a new vulnerability in Victor that correlated to John - but Victor's movements were still sharp and defensive.
He was alright now. They were both alright now. John hadn't left and Sherlock remembered. John was asleep and near him and nothing could hurt him again. He heard the noises of someone walking around upstairs and frowned at the thought of Victor. Sherlock heard what John said about him being polite and not wanting to take him upstairs. He knew John's intention was to tell him that Victor understood his actions. But he wasn't upset about waking up in bed with Victor. He knew Victor would never take advantage of him like that. No he was upset because Victor had put his hands on him in anger, he injured him, and had caused John to suffer so much grief. He didn't know the right way to proceed from this moment. He wanted Victor to leave so he'd never have to see John cry like this again, but at the same time he knew John had already forgiven Victor which usually meant Sherlock should be more rational about his decision. He decided to start with talking, so he slipped his phone off the bedside table, sitting up out from the blanket bubble and making sure John was still tucked underneath. He sighed and keeping one arm on lump of blanket's that signaled John's presence he began a text to Victor.
"Have the withdrawals started yet?" Greg asked curiously while John ate, Sherlock tensed and looked upset.
"Victor do you want me and John to leave you alone?" Sherlock asked because he figured if he didn't no one else would. John wasn't keen on leaving Victor alone, but he didn't protest as Sherlock spoke. Victor clutched the counter his eyes shutting tight.
"I erm... I will." He forced out. "Is... Is that something you've thought about?" He blushed more, looking down at Greg.
"I want to. I just want to know what it would be like. They've shared you, I want see what that feels like. I belong to you but I want to see what it would be like to have Sherlock handcuff me." Alex chuckled and pressed his lips to Victor's neck. "We've never even tried handcuffs before."
." Mycroft tensed and his eyes snapped back to John as John's appraisal of his actions dismantled the deductions he was trying to make about Sherlock. He realized that was exactly what John intended to have happen and it flustered him more.
"Oh, John." He moaned his head dropping forward on to the table as he tried to rock back his fingers. "Oh God!" He growled wanting to thrust into John's hand and move back on his fingers at the same time. The sensations short circuiting his brain. "Fuck, John. Please give me more!" He begged, looking over his shoulder at him. "Please, Master." John grunted and abruptly stopped what he was doing. He grabbed the lube making sure he was well coated before he just pushed his way into Sherlock, utterly driven by need. He panted hard, the tags clinking slightly as his chest heaved.
"Careful, John. You're going to be sensitive to sounds, lights, and even moving for a while. I am sure that your son would prefer you healthy to worrying about the trappings of Christmas."
"Have you imagine doing this to me before, John?" He pleaded sounding aroused and needy. He was desperate to know he pleased John. "Am I as good as you imagined?"
"Of course no one is blaming me. Because they don't see the truth. I could have stopped this three months after we got Hamish. Ten other children and their families were injured or killed because of me." He finally met John's eyes, the tension in him easy for his husband to read. "I feel like my head is going to explode."
"You don't really want me to stop, if you are to be honest my love." He purred in his ear, grinning. "But I will for the sake of the children. I hope you sleep well, you're going to need your energy." He promised, pulling him closer.
"Oh... John..." He panted, his head resting on John's chest. His curls damp with sweat and his entire body shivering. He felt his mind start to slide back into function and he realized there was a huge wave of emotion pooling in his belly. One he was too weak to stop. Tears came and leaked down his cheeks and onto John's chest as he clung to him, weakly and utterly boneless but deeply affected. One of his hands slowly, shaking as it did, made its way up to John's cheek as he turned his eyes upwards. "I love you..." He whispered. "God I do." At the sight of the tears in Sherlock's eyes, John's heart began to ache and tears started to blur his own eyes.
"Sherlock you never told me how you're feeling." He forced out, trying to cover over the fact that somewhere in his completely addled brain he had almost suggested that Victor stay with them.
"You took so much into consideration." He said, his voice cracking a bit as he slid it onto his finger and stared at it. He span it just to see how it would feel and he let out a laugh. Yes, he would spend his days spinning this ring on his finger while he though. He turned his face to John and kissed him as hard as he could through his tears of happiness. "I love it. I love it so much, John. I'll never take it off." John flushed with pleasure and pulled Sherlock close to his body, kissing him and laughing slightly at the stupid tears the two of them were shedding.
"Fine." Mycroft conceded but his mouth was still fixed in a thin line. "What do you make of all of this? Of them? Now isn't exactly the opportune moment to confess their feelings for one another, is it?" Greg gave a sigh, resting a hand on Mycroft's knee. For a man who claimed to be detached he could worry himself sick about Sherlock.
"We're going to make sure notto be that busy again, okay? You won't ever be lonely." He nuzzled his cheek with his nose. "We're going to have fun, Hamish. We'll make Christmas cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve and maybe in a few days we'll go for a walk through town so you can see all the Christmas lights."
He stepped out of the room, leaving the door open only a crack and sweeping over to the couch. His ring spinning at high velocity on his left hand as he typed with his right and flung himself on the couch. He was cursing under his breath. He couldn't play the violin, or turn the telly on, he needed something to distracting himself. His eyes falling on the case file on the table.
"Mycroft is being polite Sherlock, he bought me a new phone and brought lunch." John said softly, cutting off Mycroft's retort.
"Oh God," John whimpered and it took everything he had to stop the word, 'Please' from falling from his mouth but he couldn't stop his face from betraying how he felt. His breathing got heavier and his hands tightened on the bed. He could hear the need in Sherlock's voice and it shot straight through his body and made his own arousal skyrocket. His mind drifted imagining Sherlock ordering him to do things and he groaned needily. "What if..." He both started to ask and tried to stop himself. "If that's..." His breath was ragged. He didn't say it but Sherlock could almost feel the unspoken answer.
"Oh very good..." John grinned and leaned down, kissing Sherlock roughly. "Lock the doors, I want you naked in the kitchen when I get back. Hands on the table, back to the living room." He gripped Sherlock's hair claiming another vicious kiss as he stood and strode to his room.
"No... I just heard your tones. I didn't want to move because you were so afraid.." John's voice caught, revealing just how much Sherlock's fear had affected him. "But I could tell from the tone there was some bond there."
"Oh no, you are buying me a real ring. I think I deserve that at least." He laughed and then coughed again, curling up in a ball as he did. "You can get a tattoo if you prefer but I want to see what you pick out for me." He blushed a bit but sighed happily at the feel of Sherlock's hand on his chest. "I hope you can sleep." He fumbled about setting a soft alarm for four hours later and his head falling to the side slightly as sleep tried to claim him.
Without a sound in the room Sherlock swept out of it, found a bottle of water and opened it, and returned gently nudging the bottle against John's hand and handing him the pill. He slipped an ice pack over John's forehead. Which flooded John with relief. He adjusted the pillows and blankets, readjusted the towel over the lap, and made sure again the curtains were secure. He was a bundle of nerves and panic but it didn't show on his face or in his movements. Only his eyes, flicking back and forth quickly as they did when 'scrolling through information,' betrayed him but they were hard to see in the darkened room. Hamish snuggled closer to John, clutching his shirt in his tiny hand.
"I... It was too much... You didn't..." His voice was scratchy and dry making it hard for him to speak. "I couldn't sleep... I couldn't be in there." He whispered. He coughed again, his entire body racked by the sound of it. Sherlock was tense and concerned, John was shaking and absolutely ill. "Are you okay?" He asked quietly, trying to push himself to be strong again. He tried to stand and swayed before falling.
"Yes, Sherlock, I should rest but I have to give you an injection and we both need to take our flu medication again. How are you both feeling?" Sherlock sighed as doctor mode came back. He'd never understand how John could get less than thirty minutes of sleep after not sleeping the entire night and in this case while practically being annihilated by the flu and just pretend his was perfectly normal again. Then again it was probably his fault, after all when he was on a case he didn't sleep for days. John always tried to keep up with him and now here they were, three idiots trying to be the death of each other - all for
"We do. Your Daddy is an amazing doctor and he helps your Papa figure out what the bad men are doing. That's how we found you." He gently slid a finger under Hamish's chin and smiled.
"You don't know him like I do." He growled. "Take control from me, I dare you." He hissed before he sucked John's entire length into his mouth.
"Oh, please don't." Sherlock groaned at the thought of Mycroft and Greg knowing they were going out. "If you tell them John, we'll end up going on a double date!" He called up stairs as he stood in the living room with just his trousers on. He was buttoning up his purple shirt, the one he knew drove John absolutely mad, when his phone buzzed. He sighed and walked over to see it was from his brother. "Too late, they already know!" He yelled up the stairs, he glared at the bookshelf where he knew there had to be a camera.
"Then you'll be happy forever, John." Sherlock whispered against his skin. "I never get bored with you, I always need your help even when I don't want to admit it, and I have always relied on you." He tore his lips away to gaze into John's eyes trying to show him just how much he meant those words. "When a case does come along I
"Christ that is sexy and adorable." John whispered against Sherlock's ear as he kissed over it. "That warmth is desire. The flash of heat as your body reacts to the touch of someone you care about, someone you love." He whispered, keeping his mouth close to his ear as his fingers gently explored his torso, moving upward across his abdomen. "It's how I feel when you
"My Mummy and Daddy got hurted too..." Hamish said quietly, still offering the juice box. "But my Daddies ado.. Adopted me and helped me." Marius lip quivered and tears came to his eyes.
"Whatever you want," He whispered unsure of what exactly John wanted but knowing that he was willing to give it to him. "Anything, just stop crying. Please." He brought a hand to John's cheek and wiped a few of the tears away.
His face was childlike in that moment, desperate for the answer but terrified of what it might be at the same time. He wanted to find a way to make this easier for him. To make sure that he never had to put his life in danger again. He wasn't sure his own heart could handle it, let alone Hamish's. His eyes searched everything about John's face as he prepared to answer, scanning his eyes, the way he wrinkled his mouth, the way his body moved, all of it to find the truth. The truth was he himself had not handled the abruptness with which their situation had shifted, nor his own rashness at bringing Hamish into their lives very well. He didn't regret it but he had been completely ill prepared for the enormity of the task. He was also haunted by the persistent doubt that he was making a mess of things because he had no idea what to do. But God he loved the man sitting beside him. So much it made him ache to even begin to imagine what his life would be like without him. John wasn't prepared for the rush of emotions that suddenly poured out of his usually distant husband. He hadn't opened up like this in ages. He couldn't even remember properly the last time Sherlock had shed a tear. He stared at his husband with an utterly stunned and confused expression for a moment before his words actually sunk in. Sherlock was worried about his happiness. Of course he was happy. He loved being a husband and father. He had feared that would never happened, that Victor had been wrong about Sherlock's desired and yet here they were with a three year old. It was wonderful.  Sure maybe it wasn't perfect but he was happy. There were times where he missed having Victor around but now he had Hamish to cuddle with. It wasn't really the same thing but all John needed was someone there who said he loved him and wanted to touch him.
"What the hell are you doing?" Sherlock shouted, wincing at how hard Victor was tugging on his hair.
"Because it was time for him to go." John explained. "He lived with a us before you even came along, darling. Since he moved in his goal was to leave one day and take care of himself. He did that. He's happy with Alex now and that's a good thing." He ran his hand through Hamish's hair, rubbing his scalp a bit because it always calmed him down. "You'll be staying with your Uncles and Marius and maybe even Uncle Vic and Uncle Alex for a few days." He added with a smile. "Won't that be fun? And in the summer, we'll all go somewhere together as a family."
Victor had been surprised when his phone chimed. He was sitting in his study looking over some information for a meeting he was going to attend in January. He replied quickly, pleased to finally have heard from the boys.
"Just do whatever will keep you from worrying. If you go shopping, have Mrs. Hudson come up in case Hamish wakes up and I can't take care of him."
As John watched his son comfort Marius tears came to his eyes. He had no idea Hamish could be such an amazing comfort to another child. If they had another child he would be the best older brother in the world. He was so caring and sweet. John, fearing some more tears were about to come out, wrapped an arm around Sherlock and hid his face in his shoulder. A few tears had fallen from Marius eyes, but he tried to be big boy and wipe them away on John's long jumper sleeve. After he was done, he took a shaking breath and nodded slowly as he took the star gently. He gave Hamish a careful hug.
"Alex I think we'd better start coming around more or else it will just be utterly confusing when we do make it by." Victor smiled but furrowed his brow a bit at Alex's face. "Is everything alright?" He whispered, leaning close to Alex so only he could hear him.
"Oh," Greg blushed, not entirely sure he had the nerve to even try anymore. Mycroft had dominated him so very perfectly. He was sure he could not compare to his skill. He nodded, swallowing hard and forcing himself to pull away and grab his shampoo. "You'll have to keep me awake long enough to finish this shower because I am already sore and exhausted. You were too thorough with me." He laughed.
"You have to tell me. I can't read emotions... Well not all of them. Even... No especially from you." He whispered. He felt miserable, like a child. "You are the only one allowed to or who should be able to tell me to stop. I can't watch you hurt like this anymore. You have to tell me. Promise me." He leaned up, claiming John's lips in a heated kiss. "My mind is on edge. I need to touch you before I go crazy. Let me show you how much I mean what I'm saying." He whispered as a plea, his hands sliding through John's hair. The doctor felt the breath taken away the second their lips locked. He gasped and tried to catch his breath when they separated. It was so hard to keep up with him. One moment his husband was crying, the next he was trying to prove a point with his touch.
"Mummy." The boy kept crying over and over again. Not being soothed by Sherlock's words at all. The child knew something was very wrong. His Mummy was bleeding and she wasn't moving anymore. He didn't know what exactly that meant but he knew it wasn't good. "Mummy!" He sobbed again. He had no idea he'd lost both his parents at the tender age of two. He didn't know his father was even in the house, having believed he was still at work. Greg helped the officers get the two assailants into police cars and then helped do a sweep of the house. Sherlock had scooped the boy up again, trying his best to soothe him with his injured arm. Greg came back down the stairs and felt Sherlock's guilt as if it was his own. The Detective's face betraying every sentimental thing he was feeling.
"Sherlock, you will be the death of me. You git, you like me being guilty?" He teased, laughing slightly. Sherlock chuckled softly.
"Come on Daddy, put your coat on so we can go." Sherlock grinned, teasing John. Hamish giggled and crossed his arms, pretending to pout.
"Oh, oh my... Sherlock." He gasped, sounding desperate as he reached for his touch. "Let me hold you." Sherlock whined again, still caught off guard by the noise as he almost completely collapsed on John. His arms shook, barely holding him up. It took several minutes before he could even shift enough to slip out of John and the slight movement sent him gently down on top of his lover.
"Oh... Fuck, John." Sherlock growled, panting hard. His heart pounding in his chest, because he hadn't expected John to need him this much. He bucked his hips up to meet John's motions, shuddering from the feel of how tight John was around him. "God yes, take it. Use me." He gasped the words breathless with his arousal. He let his hands run down John's chest until his found his erection, wrapping his hand tightly around him, so each motion John made pumped Sherlock's hand over that aching cock. "Like this?" He growled. "Come on, use me."
"I never want that again..." He whispered still unable to stop the shaking sobs. "I never want you to look at me and not know me..." He coughed more. "It was almost worse than what happened at St. Bart's... I... I love you." He was too exhausted to check himself. His body utterly wracked by tremors as he spoke. He fell silent for a long time, clinging tightly to Sherlock just to keep him close.
"Trust me Greg, the game was ours alone. Mycroft is not involved, that would make it a lot less fun." John smirked. His tone was smoldering as he met Sherlock's eyes. "Just a little something we came up with for our... Handler." He winked at Sherlock before slowly turning his gaze back. Sherlock was deeply aroused by the look in John's eyes and bit back a moan, focusing instead on the table.
"He's mad at me. I can tell. I wish I knew why though. He brought up when I left him which makes me think that's why he's angry with me but..." Sherlock gave a sigh as he inclined himself. "I don't know. I just want him to be content and I'm worry he won't be with me around." He was trying not to but he sounded very childish and John grinned slightly.
"If it gets to bad I can sedate you. I have enough to keep you out for three days." John whispered, cuddling Sherlock close. "We will get through this together. You aren't alone this time."
"He ran off chasing a lead, forgetting I can't keep up with him. He was gone before I got to the end of the street and since I have yet to get a text or anything I just came home. He'll figure it out soon enough. But look at you! You're smiling, it looks good on you." He grinned as he teased. It had been amazing how much he and Victor had bonded over the last few months. Victor had been an anchor in the sea of Sherlock's insanity. Case after case had come in and with Sherlock stuck in case mode it had been nice to have someone else on the same wavelength to watch movies with, get dinner with, and just be around. "He'll likely pop in, in an hour or so and offer to whisk me to dinner to make up for forgetting about me. Or else cursing at me because he's been telling me important information and I won't remember any of it." John let himself look Victor over closely, he looked a lot lighter. "So what brought you flying up the stairs?" Victor moved to sit next to John, his hands practically shaking with delight. He hadn't been this happy in a long time. He was happy, well content really because he was here with Sherlock and John. He'd developed a strange relationship with them, not really a lover but not really not either. He'd had John, Sherlock, his improving health, a job, and a new lease on life... But now, now he had all of that and his family back. He smiled brightly at John, ignoring the familiar flutter of butterflies in his stomach.
"Yes, please." Sherlock whispered his voice shaking because how badly he wanted to. He leaned his into John's touch. That was the only thing he could do because he wasn't allowed to touch anymore and he was utterly desperate to feel more. Asking for things seemed to make John keen to give them to Sherlock, and that was a dangerous piece of knowledge to give him. "I want you to use me," He begged. Now he was entirely desperate to be under John's dominance. He wasn't sure when his mind switched but it became all he desperately wanted - to give John control and what he wants.
"What do you say we have a nice night in? We can order some takeaway when we get home, we'll let Hamish pick a movie, and we can build a fort in the living room. I think we still have a bottle of wine..." Sherlock offered with a smirk.
"Your hair hasn't been combed properly in three days which you've tried to cover over using your hair gel. Your jacket hasn't been cleaned in a week and you're wearing the same shirt as you were yesterday because you haven't had a chance to do the laundry and you refuse to allow me to touch it after I turned everything pink. You also forgot to shave this morning." Sherlock smirked, his mouth still close to John's. "You're just following me blindly into hell again and forgetting to take care of yourself. We're not setting very good examples." He ran a hand through John's hair, smiling as he did.  John blushed; he hadn’t even noticed he was forgetting to take care of himself. No matter how hard he tried that kept happening and he hadn't even realized it. Well, damn...
." He brought the riding crop down against his skin for a sixth time, unable to stop his own hips from bucking into John desperate to feel some friction. "Maybe if you ask really nicely I'll give you exactly you want." He whispered and then brought down the crop for a seventh time.
"I'm so lucky to have you." Sherlock whispered and John was very confused but he smiled as he let himself wrap his arms around him and pull him closer.
"Yes, they need us to leave." Greg said gently as he stood. "Feel better soon, John." He said as took Mycroft by the arm lead him out the door.
"We'll get there before anything happens. We have to." Greg insisted, almost as if he said the words out loud it would magically make it so. Too many families had died because of his mistakes. Because of their mistakes. They had to fix it. "Stop spinning that God damn ring, Sherlock. I can't think straight." He snapped a few moments later. Sherlock however did not comply, in fact he didn't even make a sound of recognition at the order instead keeping his eyes focused ahead. They finally reached the area where Greg said the family lived and quickly got out of the car. Greg sighed and against his better judgment looked to Sherlock for instructions. "Tell me what to do." He snapped darkly.
"Non, je n'est pas ton Monsier. Je suis ton Dominateur." Mycroft's face betrayed how much he was enjoying this already. His eyes scanning Greg's body. "Are you enjoying yourself, my pet?" He whispered, stepping closer to him. His eyes were dark with arousal and his voice was very low. "Undress me. Only undress me. Do not linger too long, do not touch more skin than is necessary, and do not touch my erection." His commands were
"He's supposed to be cooking himself lunch." Sherlock mumbled as he stood and stepped in the kitchen. He found John on the ground tool box beside him, trying to fix the leg of the table. "That could have waited until later, John." He teased crouching down to look at the leg of the table. "But your right, it is fixable." He was surprised when John barely made a grunting noise at him. He sighed and furrowed his brow. "I'll make you some toast be sure to eat when it pops up." He ordered before walking over to the toaster and putting two pieces of bread in. John had been somewhat confused when Sherlock came in and then sighed setting the tools down. Right, eating was important. He put the kettle on and stood there staring at it as he did. His mind racing over the last few days in quick succession. Sherlock had agreed to give Victor some money, would that mean he would come back asking for more? Was Sherlock actually in danger from him? Would that man really try to make Sherlock relapse just to keep a client or was there something deeper at work here? Sherlock walked back into living room to sit next to his brother with a sigh, "He's just trying to fix the table we broke." Greg looked at him curiously and hesitated before asking.
"Why on earth would you be sorry? You didn't do anything wrong, John. You were just being yourself. You're perfect...marvelous, caring self." Nervously, he leaned up and brushed his lips across John's cheek. Trying to reassure him both that he was worth the effort Sherlock had put into avoiding his feelings as well as for Sherlock feeling them in the first place. "You didn't do anything wrong." John moaned softly as Sherlock's lips grazed his skin and looked up to meet his eyes.
"I'm sorry we were late. The brawl was unexpected. Consequently Greg your accounting robbers have been apprehended along with the murder weapon. Do try to process the case correctly." Sherlock moved over and offered to help Mycroft remove the paper and glue. Mycroft grunted but accepted without speaking. "He's only three Mycroft."
Mycroft tensed his mouth and hummed in displeasure. He dried himself off and pulled his pajama's back on, before forcing Greg up and drying him off. He was limp in his arms, already mostly asleep. Mycroft disliked physical labor but as his husband was seemingly unable to carry himself, Mycroft hoisted him up as best he could and managed to carry him down to the living room. He quickly scanned the bed to ensure no little ones had clamored into it while they were gone and set Greg down. He managed to get him under the covers and then moved to ensure the boys were both still sleeping. He kissed both of them on the forehead before ensuring that there were no wakeful noises coming from Sherlock's room and returning to bed. 221B Baker Street was eerily quiet and for the moment a sense of peace had settled between the six Holmes men inside it. Something that happened far too infrequently.
This chapter is a little bit shorter than the last few mostly because of the way we've broken up the story. The story is complete all that's left is editing! Chapter 7 should go up soon depending on studying and exams!
"I love you, cousin." Hamish whispered softly. He was comfortable and content snuggled with him. His cocoa long gone and his eyes half closed.
"I got here about ten minutes ago. Sherlock's got me moving your things." Sherlock looked up towards the tap with a glare.
"Uncle, I'm going to go help with Daddy... Sometimes he doesn't like to let Papa go out on cases and Papa needs to go now." Hamish said, getting down and sneaking into the bedroom. He crawled up in the bed and hugged John. "Papa, I'll take care of Daddy. I promise. You go get the bad men." He whispered.
"Well that would have shortened my career considerably." He pulled Sherlock to him, turning so they were facing each other. "I was never glad to be injured before but if I hadn't been I might not have met you - and while I wouldn't have known how hollow my life was it never would have been as fulfilling as it is now beside you." Sherlock blushed because he knew that John getting shot was the sole reason they had met. He had one simple injury that could have taken John's life, to thank for them being together. He smiled at John, bringing a hand to his arm as he started to stroke up to his once injured shoulder gently.
"Close your mouth dear, you'll catch flies." Alex teased, closing Victor's mouth by lifting his chin and smiling fondly at him. "I'm just as shocked as you are but I suggest we pretend as if it's all normal because if we cause too much attention to their wonderful behavior they could start acting like their old brooding selves." He gave him a quick kiss, giggling and choosing to ignore Sherlock's sudden hissed 'Get out.'
"I love you too," he said right after John no matter how many times he said it. He started to giggle when it became clear that John was sort of stuck in that admission. "I love you too." Sherlock honestly did love John more than words could explain. He loved John so much because he made him feel important just by holding him tightly and saying so. If anyone else had done this, he wouldn't believe them but he believed John. "I love you too," he said with a giggle for what had to be the twentieth time now and he gave John a curious look. John stopped, realizing he was sort of stuck in a loop and just let silence fall around them for awhile. He just held Sherlock to him, listening to his breathing and his heartbeat and feeling him in his arms. He didn't know what else to do or say right now, he was completely at a loss. His mind raced from here to there, trying to find the perfect thing to say. The perfect words to speak his mind, but nothing came. He pressed a soft kiss against Sherlock's mouth, his eyes searching Sherlock's as they broke apart. Sherlock was utterly comfortable like this. Even though they weren't speaking he was at peace. They didn't have to talk. They could simply look at each other. Just like they were now and feel like they were the only two in the world. He brought a hand up to John's hair and played with it mindlessly, it was always so soft. "Do you want to watch telly or something?" He asked John with a shy smile. "That is what couples do, correct? Sit on the couch and watch crap telly?"
"I didn't let her flirt with me," John tried to argue in between kisses. "It just happened. I didn't even notice until you got that look in your eye." John couldn't help but moan into the next kiss because Sherlock was digging his nails into his hips.
"How can you say that?" He asked, but John's kisses stalled his mind a bit. "How am I supposed to just let it go that children died because I was being stubborn? That now I'll feel so guilty I'll never want to turn down any case which means you and Hamish will be alone all the time?!" He was panting, completely out of his element. He felt like he was going insane. "I'm going to lose everything..." The words cracked free of his heart and fell from his lips before he had time to stop them, he felt like a child. Completely vulnerable and open to John though he was struggling against it. Everything he'd known to be true about himself was violently upended and now he was left aching and raw. It hurt that the people that had harmed his son had hurt so many others. He'd never faced anything like this and he was completely lost as to how to handle it. His breath came in short shallow bursts and his entire body was still tight with pain. John brought his lips to Sherlock's again, making the kisses last a bit longer still trying to calm his mind.
"When we met, what did you honestly think about me?" Sherlock asked curiously, smiling up at John. "I was trying so hard to impress you once I figured out you were looking for a flat mate, could you tell?" He asked, his hand now stroking John's leg as he gazed into his eyes.
into Sherlock. His mind giving over to pure instinct and desire, desperate to bring them both over the edge.
"My, he is observant." Sherlock teased. "But that is exactly why Hamish Watson-Holmes, we wait for our drinks to cool before we drink them. Daddy should know better, he's a doctor."
"What?" John asked softly, only half awake. Sherlock slipped his hand back under the blanket, carding his hand through John's hair which caused him to relax. He didn't take long to fall back asleep, at which Sherlock let out another sigh of relief. There was a soft knock on the door, clearly Victor.
for Mycroft to slip into the roll. He quickly flipped the water on and began to pull off his pants and trousers, freezing when he saw the look on Mycroft's face.
it was going to be. No place has ever felt like home the way this place does." He pulled Sherlock closer, nuzzling his nose into his hair. "But even knowing that nowhere is home without you."
"You left me on the street outside the crime scene. By the time Greg let me through you were gone, love." He spoke softly because he was worried Sherlock would be angry and he was sad at having him embrace with Victor interrupted so suddenly. He pulled back from Sherlock and turned to back to Victor. "It's not the first time you've done this, we can return the wallet tomorrow. Victor are you alright?" John walked over to make sure he handy scratched anything.
good boy." He smirked, once again Sherlock was drunk with this power. The sheer force of it making him have no control over himself. They were both reduced to pure instinct and desire, their minds blissfully blank as they focused on one thing - driving each other insane. "Now to make this more interesting." Sherlock laughed in a low deep growling way. "Every time I spank you with the riding crop you have to thank me." Sherlock climbed on top of the bed and started to squeeze John's ass. "Now, how many do you think you deserve, hm? You've been a good pet. Should I give you ten? Or do you want more than that? I think ten is very generous."
"I do love him. It's just difficult for me, Sherlock. You three have this bond that is just incredible and I just worry that..." Alex looked away.
"He gave me one too." Greg said softly as he came into the room behind Mycroft, closing the door behind him. "Thought it would be best considering you started your habit again." Sherlock groaned and rolled his eyes.
"Oh he saw Hamish downstairs with Mrs. Hudson and went to say hello. Who's the adorable little red head belong to?" He grinned as Greg blushed a bit.
"Yes well, that is a credit to my brother in this moment. But John doesn't hide things well and he didn't leave the flat, which means the drugs are still available to Sherlock. He is giving my brother an extraordinary amount of trust. I only hope he can earn it." Mycroft sighed again. "What do you think? Is John good for him?" He softened slightly as he asked for Greg's actual opinion, turning to look his partner fully in the eyes.
"I can't believe you two used to be so... Close." Greg said, his surprise clear though he spoke with a chuckle. "For as long as I've known the both you, you've acted like you could never get along. Yet here the both of you are acting like you are best friends and with the joy of being children again."
"Nightmare.... Sorry." John forced out with a sigh, instantly trying to cover his emotion and weakness with his normal demeanor. He ran a hand over his face, his voice was dry and scratchy. He wasn't really doing well was he? "When did Greg get here?" He asked quietly, tightening the bathrobe around himself. "How long have I been asleep?" He tried to ask normal questions, pretending the nightmare was nothing. Sherlock tutted.
"Oh! Your little doctor got you walking a straight line now, yea?" He chuckled darkly, teasing Sherlock. "And here I thought he was the reason you were using again. Isn't that what you said? You started to care about him and you tried to use drugs to block those feelings out. So what did he find out or something?" Victor laughed again. "No, your idiot brother told him didn't he? Set your little guard dog on you. So what, is he
"Sherlock I am buying you a new set of dishes." Mycroft grumbled as he sorted through the plates in order to find enough decent ones for all of them.
"Oh if you all want me to." She blushed, flushed with pleasure as the brothers both turned to encourage her presence.
"Oh, I know. You don't have to tell me." Sherlock said with amusement as he brought his lips to John's neck and he started ravish it with kisses. "Are you going to go put on that uniform for me?" He whispered as he started to rub John's thighs, John grabbed his hands and pinned them down, ravishing him with kisses.
"John, if you didn't know he was doing this how can we be sure he even trusts you?" Every single fiber of John's being tensed and he looked at Mycroft with a dark look. Greg had a momentary concern that John might launch himself across the desk, but he relaxed just slightly. Mycroft for his part realized what he had said and sighed. "I didn't mean it like that, stop being so dramatic." He scolded.
"Maybe not being alone will help." John offered softly. He flicked off the light and gently slid down, keeping Sherlock against him as he got comfortable. "But either way, I'm right here. Nightmares or not if you need anything at all, wake me." He held Sherlock firmly but with gentleness, running his hand soothingly over his back. His other hand gently gliding through that dark hair, sighing softly at the pleasure of it. Sherlock nodded slowly, he could do that. If he had some sort of nightmare or felt like he was going to be sick, he'd wake John. It would be easy to do now because he knew John honestly wanted to take care of him, he'd thought that was the case before but now he had
"Shut up!" Hamish snapped. "No you don't." He was crying. "You just left. Daddy was sad! Papa is sad!" He tried to pull away and Victor refused to let go. "LET ME GO!" He shouted.  He was behaving just like Sherlock. Unable to properly express his feelings so he got angry.
"I was a sex demon before, you just didn't know it." Sherlock answered with a smirk, but then they were kissing again and Sherlock went blank. He still couldn't put his finger on it, what it was about kissing John that simply made everything melt away from his awareness, except John. The pain, his thinking, his worries, all of it was just gone. His face hardened with sheer determination, he was not going to let John talk him out of this, sex made him feel better and they were going to have it again. "Fine doctor, I'm determined to keep it down then." He whispered against his lips before smirking as an idea came to him. "I want you to take control this time, John." He whispered and before John could object - "Maybe you'll like it. I can be very submissive, when I want to be."
"Do it." He ordered and once he felt the burning sensation he winced and muttered. "Son of a bitch." He pulled his arm away from Sherlock with a groan. "Shit. Fuck." He continued swearing as it burned. He shut his eyes for a moment, shaking his head to try to distract from the pain. "Well, this is the second night in a week we've had to leave, Mish with them." John said through gritted teeth. Once the pain began to fade away, he opened his eyes and let out a sigh. "Christmas is in four days and I haven't gotten a damn bit of shopping done aside from filling Hamish's stocking."
John finally pulled the jumper on the robe over his arm as he slowly made his way back downstairs. Greg and Mycroft both watched him with clear concern as he shuffled into the room towards Mycroft. He dropped the drugs in Mycroft's hand before moving into the bathroom and running water to splash over his face. Sherlock watched John leave with concern, noting he was paler than he'd been last night, almost as if he was ill. He tried to stand and go check on him when Mycroft forced him to sit back down. Sherlock snapped at Mycroft, his voice still low.
"Well, how is a fort maded out of 'ankets gonna protect ya?" Greg snorted out a laugh and looked at Mycroft with a grin.
"You're not an awful person, Sherlock." John moved over and took Sherlock in his arms. "Feeling isn't really your thing. You didn't even admit to having feelings until recently. And to be honest you have been so terrified of hurting the man who was your first and only friend for so long I think things got mixed up. You didn't know what signals you were sending. You were entangled with him because you were afraid of being alone. He came because he knows you care and he wants you to be happy. It's not an easy thing, it will be hard, but you care and that's more than anyone else is doing for him right now. You just have to give him time and space to process all of this. And you have to acknowledge how he feels and tell him where you need him to be in your life. He deserves the straight truth from you. Maybe not right this very moment now but in the course of all of this. He deserves that Sherlock. But he needs his friend too." Sherlock was trembling, partly because of the flu but mostly because of the overwhelming emotion surging through him.  He knew John was right, that Victor deserved to hear the truth from Sherlock's own mouth but he didn't want to say it. I didn't want to watch his face. He'd seen that look before, when he'd played off his experiments of touch and sentiment with John as mere idle fascination. He didn't want to see what the overall crushing blow would do.
"I'll be okay, Sherlock. Really. Go. Go catch them." John whispered, forcing his tears to slow as he hugged Hamish close to him. Inhaling his little boy scent and allowing it to relax his mind. Sherlock wanted to scream. He knew if he hesitated any longer the murderers would strike but he desperately wanted to remain by his family.
"No, not really." Victor mumbled as he started to make the tea. Sherlock sighed from the couch. He could hear the pain in Victor's voice even though he was trying to mask it. "I'd rather just do it myself while I can, John." He said John's name kindly, betrayed some emotion and John found himself almost summoned to Victor's side by it. Victor sat down at the kitchen table, burying his face in his hands. Honestly the shower did help him feel better but now he had nothing to hide the emotional pain he was in. He closed his eyes tightly wishing he could just run away somewhere. Somewhere far away from all of this mixed up emotion, but he had nowhere to go. This was the only safe haven left for him, even though it felt half like a prison. And even if he could shoot up it wouldn't numb these sorts of feelings, it never did.
"Oh no..." John mumbled softly, he knew that look. There was some unspoken challenge going on. They all looked confused when Mycroft stood suddenly, Sherlock tensing as if preparing for an attack and then looking utterly bewildered as Mycroft walked towards the kitchen.
"While we were having sex." He said firmly, turning to meet Greg's eyes. Trying to recover from his flustered state. "Je pense que tu veux entendre que." He whispered boldly, smirking. Greg couldn't stop the soft moan that escaped his lips. Oh he loved that. He absolutely loved that. Mycroft speaking a foreign language was like having your ears wrapped in the softest silk. He remembered how amazing it had sounded listening to Mycroft hold full conversations with people in Paris. He covered his mouth with his hand to keep himself from making any more embarrassing sounds as he scooted closer. The look in Mycroft's eyes was almost enough to make fire pool in his groin.
But no one ever showed but the biggest surprise for John came when three days later Sherlock rushed up the stairs to Baker Street with the baby boy in one arm and an adoption certificate in the other.
"Naked." Sherlock answered with a weak smile at John. "You have noticed I walk around naked in a sheet, right?" He asked as he watched John dry his hair. "I should think you noticed when we were at the palace." He teased.
It had been an easy crime scene or so Sherlock had thought. Two men robbed a small accounting firm and then made off with the books and the money. Sherlock easily cornered them in their warehouse and was going to sweep in, deduce them thoroughly, and then watch smugly as the Yard hauled them off. But John said he'd seen a third man and came storming into the building. The two men and two others (the one John saw and another who came from outside) attacked them and now John was bleeding from his bicep where he'd been stabbed fairly deeply and had potential head trauma. Sherlock easily ignored his own injuries, though his own arm ached from where it was likely sprained. Pain was nothing for him.  He had a cut above his right eye that was still bleeding, his coat was torn, watch busted, and he had several moderately deep cuts himself - none requiring stitches but nasty all the same. His hands were shaking slightly as he tried to work, because for a moment he'd seen his husband in mortal danger. Something that still did not sit well with him. They'd been married for two and a half years but it was still a new challenge every day for him. Especially now that Victor was happily settled with his fiancé Alexander. John didn't have someone to cuddle anymore, well... That wasn't entirely true. He had Hamish, but no adult contact. So Sherlock was trying his best to adapt which if this was any evidence of it - he was doing a miserable job.
"Oh no you don't. You sit right here." He ordered as he patted his lap. "I want to make sure you don't get too close." He said with wicked grin.
"What?" John asked with confusion and he heard Hamish mumble something about 'taking care of Daddy because he was sick' before Sherlock easily lifted him into his arms and carried him into the bedroom. "What on earth? We can't just leave him in there alone." But John quickly realized he didn't have anything to worry about. There was a slight noise of a chair being drug over and Sherlock easily pictured what he son was doing in the kitchen, a small smile on his face.
"No problem," Greg said with a soft smile as he slid across the seat to sit next to Mycroft. "Oh stop making that face," He told Mycroft firmly once he saw the very faint sight of a pout on his lips. "Angelo's is a very nice place. I've been there many times." He tried to assure his rather picky partner, smirking as he did. "And before you even ask, yes, I do remember all the expensive restaurants you have taking me to
"I do too." Mycroft conceded and pulled Greg back to himself, holding him against his chest. "Everything will get better, love."
"I'm alright, love." Sherlock said softly. "I am just very wound up after today. I'm sorry I made you two worry.
"I don't want you to apologize. I loved it." Greg, with his eyes closed searched for Mycroft's lips and found them. "I love you. I love what you do to me. All I ask is that you keep me awake." He said with a smile as he pulled away to rinse the shampoo out of his hair. He then handed Mycroft his shampoo. "Here you go, darling." He whispered as he handed it to him. "You wash your hair, I just," He stopped to yawn, "Want to stand here and hold you." He finished as he wrapped his arms around him.
“Yeah, we did. That's how I got hurt." John answered, rocking Hamish in his arms. He felt awful. No child should have to be so worried about his parents. But there was no way they could stop working. They were good at what they did and Sherlock could never stop, his mind would explode if he didn't have a case. The consulting detective wanted to speak but his throat felt tight. Hamish's words felt like a confirmation of how horrible he had been the last few months. It felt like the words John himself couldn't say were finally in the open. Sherlock
"You always are." John whispered and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  "But I meant besides the puppy. Like toys or books. I have a feeling that Father Christmas is feeling very gracious this year so you may get everything you want." He said with a bright smile. "But I think he'll only bring you everything as long as you promise to stay in bed until Christmas morning this year. Last year you kept trying to get up to see him and I think he took some of your gifts back with him because you almost caught him." John wasn't exactly lying. The previous year Hamish had almost caught him putting out presents and he grabbed the presents and ducked back into the bedroom falling over Sherlock who had finally gotten up to help him.
"I love you." He whispered before turning to look to Victor. "As long as you're happy, we can keep doing this. But if you ever want this to stop, you just have to say so." Victor went a bit wide eyed, they were leaving this all up to him?
"Yes, I wanted to see you wear it." Sherlock answered with a grin as he began looking for some food for Greg who currently walked back carrying three large boxes. "You're doing wonderful, Greg!" He shouted.
"Yes, Captain." He said with a giggle. "I've imagine things quite a few times, though this when I thought I was only sexually attracted to you. I didn't know I was in love with you then but the desire still remains." He climbed on top of John, straddling him and leaning down a bit to play with his hair and whisper in his ear." I've imagined just like you said walking over to you and making you drop you pants, pushing you up against the squad car while I sucked you off in the middle of a crime scene. I think of that when the crime scenes are boring and we're waiting on Lestrade to tell us some sort of useless information." He grinned, "But when it's a really exciting one, I try to misbehave. Have you noticed? I wanted to see if I could anger you enough to take me aside and teach me to behave." He leaned down and brushed his lips over John. John groaned softly.
John grunted and ran a hand over his face. He couldn't have been sleeping long. He seemed to become aware of the fact that both of the other men were staring at him with concern and he flushed slightly. He turned to look at them both in turn and saw the look on Sherlock's face.
. He'd been flat on the floor and heard someone shouting his name. He felt strong hands on him, pulling him off the floor and sitting him on the couch. His head was spinning and he couldn't see clearly. Were his eyes closed? They were. He forced them open only to find a blonde man, who was clearly a doctor - likely military judging by his movements. He was touching him gently and saying his name as he tried to find out if Sherlock was able to respond. Sherlock's eyes betrayed his confusion as he noted the man's shirt was unbuttoned. He was older, was this one of Victor's 'friends?'
"Please... Don't hurt each other..." He asked in a small voice. Feeling guilty. "I want you both to use me. Please don't fight..."
"A few days? It's Christmas." He complained. "I need to be out shopping and decorating the tree with my son." John argued raising his voice too much and making his head give a painful throb. He winced and the doctor smirked.
"Come on 'Mish, your gloves and scarves are down stairs." John reminded him as he lifted the boy back in his arms and walked down stairs. Sherlock chuckled slightly as he heard Hamish rattle off questions demanding why John carried him everywhere and for what reason he always needed to wear gloves. Sherlock met them at the base of the stairs with a smile, offering John the boys' gloves. "He certainly will never be bored with all the curious questions he asked." John handed Hamish to Sherlock and smiled as he watched the detective hug him tightly and press gentle kisses over his cheeks.
"I've thought about you that way a few times these past few months." He confessed, but then he was leaving out the part that was when his mind would start buzzing so loud he would have to another shot of heroin. "You're not mad at me anymore, is your sex drive that potent?" He teased.
"I didn't take any of the drugs!" Sherlock informed them all because he could see what they were thinking. Just because they were bickering with each other didn't mean anything. He could see it written on their faces. Their blurry moving faces. "I don't have to take them anymore, I'm fine." He said firmly, as if he was trying to convince himself. He shut his eyes again and took a deep breath.
"He isn't just my patient, he is my partner. He has always been my partner. You aren't helping showing up here with keys made and ready to drag him out. I have this under control and I would hope you two of all people would know that if anyone can help him through this it is me. After all I'm the one here day after day." John was actually shaking with anger. His words weren't meant to be so angry but they were like a slap in the face.
"Focus on me, love, not them." John whispered carding his hands through Sherlock's hair very gently.
John whimpered slightly, not entirely thrilled to have had his kiss disturbed. He let his hand snake up into Sherlock's hair and tugged it gently, pushing his mouth to Victor's.
Sherlock was upstairs helping Greg consolidate and move John's things. When they heard John shout his name he dropped what he was holding and ran down stairs, immediately climbing back into the fort to find John in a cold sweat. John was paler than normal, his eyes wild, and his breath shaking as he tried to calm himself. Sherlock felt fear in his chest but it subsided quickly as his focus enveloped John.
"I... I never wanted him to be in love with me. Not even in Uni. I just... I just wanted him to care about me. I never wanted thing to get that mixed up." He hid his face in John's shoulder wishing he could breathe through his stuffy nose. Victor bit his bottom lip as he heard that, it hurt to hear. "If he's loved me for this long... John, that means there's never really been anyone else. After I left he never found anyone else."
"You're getting yourself worked up... I will save Italian for when we have a holiday alone." Mycroft teased, his voice actually full of arousal but also sternness. He felt Greg's hand slipping down towards his waist and he smirked. "Arrête ça." He commanded in French, pinning Greg's hands in his own. "Do you want to upset our son?" He purred softly in his ear. "Arrête ça." He repeated, but it was clear he was enjoying this. Greg smirked, he had no idea what Mycroft was saying but he was quite sure he was telling him to stop.
"Victor you look well. The reports in the papers say you're doing very well at your father's company. I saw that Alex got a promotion as well. Congratulations." Mycroft smiled as Victor flushed slightly.
touch. He gasped loudly, gripping the sheets tightly. "Oh God, John!" He moaned and focused on keeping his eyes shut tight, determined not to move. "Thank you for sucking my sock, Captain." He panted, trying his best to be submissive for John. He would have to do more research later, so next time he would be even better at this. A grin toyed at the edge of John's lips, he understood that Sherlock was out of his element and it made him absolutely giddy with ego. He didn't care about power anymore, all he cared about was making Sherlock feel amazing. He sucked him harder, humming as he did and enjoying how Sherlock tensed. He gently, slowly pushed his finger inside Sherlock - moaning around him as he felt how tightly he clenched around his finger.
Mycroft rolled his eyes as he read the text. He was currently sitting in a parked car, alone, while he waited for Greg who was inside a now empty home. There were four dead bodies inside. Four more deaths to this incredibly annoying case. They hadn't gone on holiday. Greg was so obsessed with the case that they couldn't leave. Mycroft had done everything persuade him but he insisted the case was more important because people were dying. To which Mycroft replied.
"Hm...." Hamish hummed snuggling into Sherlock and gripping John's jacket tightly. "Can we play pretend? I watched a show about a castle. Castles are nice." He was watching John intently leaning against Sherlock. Sherlock had his eyes closed, fighting a memory and the desire to open the case file tucked in his jacket.
"Are Marius and Hamish still downstairs?" Greg asked Victor as he moved to sit next to Mycroft at the table.
"We made it a little while ago... Papa!" Hamish said and ran to the top of the stairs just as soon as John took the cup. John took a quick sip of the hot tea before he moved to stand up. Sherlock was home and in one piece. He watched as Sherlock and Greg came up the stairs and his face tightened. Sherlock looked alright despite the grief and desolation clearly written all over his face. John could tell he was trying to bottle it up, trying to shove his emotion down so his brother and son couldn’t deduct it. John could see how he was trying to hide it as clear as day but he didn't mention it, instead he just walked forward and give him a weak kiss. "You okay?" He asked, not wanting to pressure him too much. He waited until Sherlock set down all the various bags in his hands before gently touching his chest.
"They pretend I don't see it but they're obviously shagging each other." Sherlock with a snicker as John set down next to him. He felt himself relax as John placed a hand on him. That helped. His touched helped in ways Sherlock couldn't fully understand or explain. When John started rubbing his back he subconsciously leaned into the touch. He could see his brother eyes on them and he blushed, suddenly closing his eyes to pretend his brother wasn't watching him.
"Three months.... Christ." John’s voice shook and he couldn't stop the sob that broke free of his chest. He doubled over slightly and for one moment his entire heart was open and vulnerable to Sherlock in a way Sherlock had never seen before. But it lasted only briefly before John straightened up, forced out a rough breath, and again tried to shove the emotion away. Sherlock felt the guilt again as he realized what John was doing. Realized that John was holding in all his emotion because he'd never given him reason to believe it would matter. He’d never done, not even when he returned after St. Bart’s. But that single sob conveyed so much in so short a time, Sherlock's addled brain grasping desperately onto every detail it provided. His own eyes glassing over as he realized he was hurting the
"I'm fine, really. I just stood up for a little bit and got this awful head rush, I'm fine though. I promise." He insisted, trying his best to smile at John. "Here, get in." He ordered as he reached behind him to turn the hot water on. John wasn't convinced and it gnawed away at his heart, but he decided to give Sherlock the space to tell him on his own. He set his stuff down and took his bathrobe off.
"We are mad. Utterly crazy." John grinned and held Sherlock to him. "I promise to try to be better about this." He whispered. Feeling a bit of the body aches that he'd been ignoring. "I swear, but you'd better promise me too."
"We could have it done up with blue paint and gold trim. We'll get gold colored sheets and curtains." Mycroft offered softly, turning just slightly to watch his brother and Hamish. Sherlock gave him a look: We're fine.
"Oh no..." Sherlock smirked and he maneuvered so his toes hooked the waist band and slowly slid them down. He followed them, licking a hot trail down John's chest.
"I do. It was the first time I didn't have a nightmare without him around." He admitted in a soft voice, nuzzling closer to Victor. The two were rather like cats, craning for each other's warmth."I know I will come stay at least but I am sure he will too. Whenever you need either of us we will be there." He closed his eyes enjoying Victor's scent and warmth. He blushed more but sighed happily, Sherlock could be angry with him as much as he liked. But John needed this. He needed someone who would let him touch them for long periods of time, someone who would let him pull them close and hug them, someone who was softer around the edges. Victor lifted his head feeling particularly bold because of John's actions and checked to make sure he didn't hear Sherlock coming up the stairs. He smiled at the silence and pushed his away into John's lap like a puppy. He'd done it a few times before because he liked being close to John as possible. He knew that it might cause a problem if Sherlock ever came in and caught them but he fancied himself smart enough to be sure that didn't happen. Besides being held made him feel safe and relaxed and John was the only one of the two who seemed to like to hold him for long periods of time. He'd tried several times to cuddle with Sherlock but he'd just been met with rejection.
"I-I'm sorry." He whispered the hint of tears still in his eyes on the verge of spilling over into real tears. "I'm sorry... I shouldn't... I shouldn't have let him... He made me think I needed them." Sherlock wanted John to understand that he didn't intend to have more drugs brought into the house.
"Seriously, what is going on?" Victor said quietly, looking mildly shocked. He motioned between the two brothers, looking slightly incredulous. He turned to John and Greg with a skeptical look. "Have you two
"Nothing like that. We need help but we also need freedom." John snapped, ignoring the comment about the panic attack. But the thought wormed its' way into his mind and he felt himself sink back into his body and it was true. He had been having a panic attack but his mind and body had been split on it until just now. He trembled a bit harder and tried to hide it as he reached for his tea.
"And you were supposed to be here an hour... What the hell happened to you two?" Greg stopped as he entered the hallway.
"Yea he does." He mostly mouthed. He smiled broadly. This was all so strange and yet deeply satisfying for him. Victor knew what it was like, what it was like to love the mad man lying between them. He understood it on a level no other person in the world could. It was deeply satisfying to know he now had someone to talk to. He knew if they got up Sherlock would wake and he was really quite comfortable and didn't feel as sick for the moment so he just let himself remain there. Rubbing the back of Victor's hand and feeling the warmth of Sherlock between them. "He's pretty deeply asleep, for real this time." He whispered. Victor felt his cheeks warm at the sight of John's smile. He also felt those terrible butterflies at the pit of his stomach but he tried to ignore them as nuzzled Sherlock's hair with his nose.
if you give us a chance." John said firmly, his arms still crossed. Sherlock meanwhile was drowning his brother out, he'd learned how to tune out his voice years ago. He listened instead to John's voice as he argued with his brother. He couldn't help but feel the need to be closer to him but he honestly didn't want Mycroft or Greg to pick on them, therefore he settled on 'accidental' contact. He stretched out one of his feet and as he did it just happened to brush against John's leg as it came to rest just inside his ankle. He needed some sort of physical contact, that kept the pain away. But his concern was raised as he observed John red with anger. Whatever Mycroft was saying was truly upsetting him.
Sherlock stood quickly and collected the check for the breakfast. He walked over and paid at the counter while Hamish hummed happily and played with John's hair, as they stood near the door. Sherlock strode back towards them and without hesitation he closed the gap between himself and John, claiming John's mouth in a deep but short kiss before walking over and holding the door open for him.
"Sherlock Holmes get out here this instant!" Mycroft growled through the door. "Greg, please make some tea." He sighed, looking over at his partner. "It's going to be a long afternoon."
"No no, I really don't want to watch you two shag." Greg said, now turning a bit red himself. "Mycroft's already told me you two have a pretty... healthy sex life and that's almost too much information as it is." He looked over at Mycroft and smiled.
"We have to ask Nanny about the puppy but maybe if you are extra good you will get one,” Sherlock promised him.
"Your Daddy didn't sleep well last night. Let's let him rest." He whispered softly to the little boy, smiling as he protested.
"We're...mad." He said with a chuckle. "Utterly insane for ignoring our own well being like that." He brushed his lips over John's again, not caring that he could very well get sick. "But we've always done that."
"So what were you texting Victor about earlier?" Sherlock asked, knowing that John wasn’t ready to talk about his mumblings which he heard perfectly. "And don't say you weren't. He and I are the only ones you text after it gets dark."
Sherlock noticeably changed, his body tensed, his eyes widened a bit with fear as he started to text Victor back.
"That's good, but just a bit dull." He told him with a shrug. John had picked bland food, that meant he was not able to stomach the usually strong flavors he preferred. That deducting hummed in his brain but was chased away but a sudden boldness. "Do you want to try mine?" He asked with a smile. John's eyes met Sherlock's and he was absolutely floored by the statement. Greg couldn't entirely understand the emotion that was written so clearly on John's face, but he smirked as he watched the two of them forget once again that other people were around. Sherlock had never let John eat off his plate before, there were many reasons but the chief one was that he was incredibly possessive over things he decided belonged to him though he did not respect that sort of behavior in others. Now though a new feeling rolled through him and he felt everything that was his now also belonged to John.
"Yes." Sherlock sighed. "Mycroft was going to get a dog. We went to the rescue to look them over and one attacked me." He focused on running his hand through Hamish's hair. "It was fairly traumatizing. So I have never liked dogs since. But I will think about it." Hamish had fallen asleep, one hand on John's leg and the other on Sherlock's shirt. Sherlock smiled. "He worries just like you."
"Thirty nine." He said sadly. "I'm afraid you are getting the flu, if you were just catching a cold the fever would be mild."
"I couldn't sleep anymore and didn't want to keep you awake. I felt really hot so our rather comfortable embrace started to feel a bit like a prison. So I came in here to make sure you got some rest." Sherlock explained with a shrug. He leaned into John's touch with a appreciative smile. "I just wanted you to rest since we did stay up rather late last night." He gave a sly smile.
Sherlock hated this, he hated how Mycroft was breathing down the back of his neck like this. He wanted to be alone with John and going out on a double date with Greg and his brother was far from being alone. With a sigh, he pulled on his jacket and began walking up the stairs. He stopped only a few stairs up as he heard John coming down.
"Why?!" Hamish groaned, sounding very Sherlockian indeed. "Why is everyone always kissing?" He pouted, looking at Greg. Greg chuckled.
Victor took a deep breath and put a hand over his heart as he looked up the stairs. It still fluttered slightly whenever he came here, memories crowding around every corner. He still couldn't shake that feeling, deep down in his core that this place was
"Well it can't be too big, we have to get it through the door, love." John said with a chuckle but at his son's frown he gave a sigh. "But I promise we will get one as big as possible." John promised giving both of his boys a kiss on the cheek. "And of course we're getting Nanny a prezzie- present." John corrected himself with a laugh; he would start talking like Hamish if he wasn't careful. And that would annoy Sherlock to no end. "What do you think she would like?"
"I am not a prick! I haven't done anything to you!" He insisted through gritted teeth.  He opened his eyes and glared at John, not caring that the man was crying at the moment. At least he hadn't cared until he noticed. Why the hell was John crying? John didn’t cry and he certainly didn’t seem aware of the fact that he was now. "It's none of your business and I'm not going to tell you so you might as well let me leave!" He stood slowly only to be pushed back down again by John's angry hands, "STOP FUCKING PUSHING ME AROUND JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T PROPERLY DEFEND MYSELF!"
"Lay back on the table." He growled, clawing into Sherlock's hips as he helped him up. Sherlock gave a pout as he laid back on the table which was still somewhat cold and caused him to shiver. He was disappointed as now the only part of John he could reach was his waist and he sighed once he realized that. He pouted.
"Thank You 'Mish."  He smiled and pulled away to look up  at Greg. "Help me, Daddy?" He asked nervously and Greg gave him a warm smile.
"Show me Uncle 'Lock." He pleaded as Mycroft set him on the ground. Greg followed John into the kitchen to help him with the soup.
“Hm?" Sherlock hummed as he continued to stroke John's firm chest. "There's nothing really going on up here," He confessed as he pressed his lips to John's cheek and kissed it a few times. "My head is just filled with you: I'm thinking about how much I love you, what sort experiments you and I are going to do... My mind is currently fixated on you and to be honest I suddenly don't mind at all."
"He's wonderful." Sherlock said, leaning into John with a fond smile. "But so are you, and I'm going to help you get clean. So is John. And once you are we'll find you a job. We'll get you back into school if you want. And maybe you can become the person you were meant to be in the first place."
"Greg, this is what the game can cause just in case my brother didn't go home and show you himself." He said and Greg actually blushed as brought a tea try into the living room and sat it down. When Mycroft shouted at Sherlock, he only turned to grin at him. "You woke me up, Mycroft. Don't expect me to behave." He hissed as he grabbed John's hands and moved to sit with him on the couch. "Why are you here? I let Victor have that money. There isn't anything to discuss. He needs it."
"Not yet." He purred, walking forward. "I owe you your punishment first. Then you may have your reward. Ask to receive your punishment." He whispered, running his hand just above Sherlock's skin, knowing the slight touch would drive him insane. "You are to receive five spankings, because you couldn't keep that amazing mouth to yourself." He growled low in Sherlock's ear, nipping it gently. "Ask your Master to begin." He was already aching, but he knew he had to do this correctly. He had to make this moment perfect. Because this was something Sherlock would never give to just anyone. The heady excitement of it made him almost tremble but he focused his mind. He'd thought about this, Christ he had. Sherlock had been desperate to see this outfit since he found out John snuck it home. But John had hidden it. The one time he had managed to hide something well. He wanted Sherlock to be ready to explode with desperation before he let him see it. But he slipped one foot next to Sherlock's so his gaze would fall on his boot and the cuff of his pants. Enough to tease. "Now." He growled.
"How are you feeling?" He asked softly, settling back down. "Victor will need this too. Mycroft brought me more when he brought lunch so we have what we need. If... If he starts it as soon as he gets here the withdrawal should be easier.." John was dropping in and out of sleep, trying to force himself beyond the wall of exhaustion and failing.
"Don't worry, you were very good. But you did get a bit carried away." John rubbed his thigh to soothe him as they got in and he stayed very close to Sherlock. "So, now you have to decide where you want to receive your reward." Sherlock blushed a bit and he leaned close to John's ear. He had been thinking about this since all night, since John mentioned rewarding him. He had considered every room and currently his choices were a tossup between the kitchen and the living room.
"I'm sorry, little one." Alex whispered, resting a hand on his back and rubbing it gently. "Would you like to go lay down with Daddy and Uncle Victor?" He suggested. When Victor's eyes went wide Alex just nodded. "It will calm him down." Alex whispered, running a hand through Hamish's hair.
"No. He does?" Hamish asked Sherlock in awe, scooting into his lap. Sherlock put his arms around him and let him snuggle in close.
"Can't afford to, Sherlock." Victor mumbled suddenly grabbing his head. "Please, don't scream right now, alright? I feel like my head my is going to explode."
"Okay then, we'll have nothing to worry about." Greg said with a snicker. He loved this, he knew he was torturing his husband but it was so much fun to watch. "Let me think... I think about this a lot but I'm going to try to think of my
"I've never talked about Harry with you before... I was trying and you just..." He shook, hard. It felt like a slap in the face. He tried to reason this away, he was too tired or too tense from dinner... But that wasn't the truth. The truth was he didn't feel like he was enough anymore.  "He grabs your attention just by sending you a message," His voice was low as he spoke, partially for feeling childish and partially from the jealousy and hurt. "He has for awhile now. Just like
"John, stop it." Victor's voice was tight with pain. "Why do you insist on lying? He's going to go mad. Tell him now. You saw how he was acting up there with Mycroft. He's trying to be different." Victor put his hand on John's shoulder. "You owe it to yourself, to Hamish, and to him." John took a deep breath because he felt like his heart was racing out of control. He didn't want to tell Sherlock right now. Right now just didn't feel like a good time but he knew Victor was right, Sherlock was trying to be different. He was trying to reunite the family so that they could have support. As John really stopped to consider everything that happened, he blushed. Sherlock was doing this for him. Trying to make things better so that John could have an actual family.
"Don't- Don't do that when I'm holding Hamish." John said with a giggle as he scooted away from Sherlock. His husband knew damn well what whispering in his ear did to him. "No. Just no, Sherlock. Just because people flirt with me doesn't mean you get to tease me like this." He said firmly. "And for the record, I never flirt back." He said with a smug smile.
." He winked and couldn't stop the chuckle that escaped his lips when he watched his husband's face turn a bit red.  Mycroft simply strode over and sat on the couch beside Hamish. Beginning to roll the sleeves of the shirt up for Hamish, who giggled.
"He wasn't allowed to tell anyone. Of course Sherlock could have told you, if you had been interested." Mycroft was watching Sherlock closely now, realizing he was holding himself back. A slight smile playing on his lips.
"It's too short." Hamish pouted about the tree John was looking at. Sherlock meanwhile shamelessly began chatting with one of the girls who worked there, clearly being his most charming until she was red in the face and wandered off muttering. He walked back.
Sherlock study John for a long moment. He was having a panic attack. Oh Christ he really was and he was trying to stop it. He held John a bit tighter.
"Sometimes Dads are like that, yea?" John offered softly, swiping his thumb over Sherlock's hand again. "I like being able to do this." John smiled and squeezed Sherlock's hand to indicate his point. Sherlock's cheeks warmed a bit and he leaned closer place a soft kiss to John's cheek.
"Oh, like you use when I get sick!" Hamish nodded. "I want to be just like my Daddies." He announced proudly. Sherlock was still a bit red, it always caught him off guard when either of his loves did something so sentimental. He rubbed Hamish's arm as the boy snuggled in closer to John.
"It tastes awful. It usually taste good." Sherlock sighed, shaking his head. "I want to try to eat more." He insisted. Subconsciously, he began to stroke John's leg because it made him feel a little warmer.
"Just let me talk to him first." John was pacing, anger and betrayal coursed through him. "If you want him better then let me go to him." He wasn't focused, his entire being fixated on the feelings pouring through his veins.
Sherlock would be purring if he was a cat, knowing that today was going to be a very long tormenting day for his husband, but only in the very best ways. John let out a very noticeable breath once Sherlock's foot was gone. He was relieved it was over, giving him a chance to allow his body to recover and the blood to return to his brain. Under normal circumstances Sherlock's teasing would not have bothered him, but he always worried about doing things like this around Hamish. He did not want to accidentally scar their child for life. He pulled his food back over eating a bit more, now that he believed it safe to do so. He finished his coffee and helped Hamish finish his pancakes.  Stealing a bite before he remembered Hamish's cocoa.
"He gets a pardon until after Christmas, but I'm going to throttle him if he ever does this again. I do know how to dispose of a body so no one can find it. He would do well to remember that." Sherlock said it a bit darkly, flinching slightly as John washed off his cheek, noting it was bruised. "And what do you mean preparing for the day I broke down?" John gave a sigh finally putting the flannel away. He grabbed a dry towel and began drying Sherlock off.
"You're strange, Doctor Watson." Victor said quietly but he did relax at the sound of the music. He closed his eyes doing exactly as John instructed and listening to the continued soft commands John gave. John's weight was a comfort beside him and as his mind relaxed he felt his attention shift to his memories. Suddenly he wasn't in Baker Street anymore. He was in his old flat laying down on the couch with his head in Sherlock's lap. Sherlock playing with his hair as he studied. The memory continued on for a long peaceful moment before the soft sound of John asking if the music was helping snapped him back. "Sort of. It takes my mind off the drugs but it makes me think about him." He whispered the confession, turning to look at John. John was close to him, the way a friend would be. There were no signs of fear or disgust in his features, just interest and concern. "He was the one who introduced me to this music. I used to only like alternative music... I still like it but now I like this too. When we were in Uni I'd take me music and mix it with classical, just to annoy the hell out of him. A few times he liked the combination though." Victor smiled fondly before closing his eyes again. John coughed raggedly and Victor was reminded that he was just as sick as the two of them were. "You should go back to bed, John. It's late and we both know Sherlock needs someone sleeping next to sleep at all."
"I believe I did mention earlier that it would be a miracle if we made it out of bed." John giggled and kissed him again. "Stop kissing me so bloody well and I'll stop responding. Otherwise just do whatever the hell you want with me." He purred the words as he claimed Sherlock's mouth again.
Sherlock couldn't focus on John at the moment, his mind racing away as he planned all the violent things he would do the next time he saw Victor. It was all he could focus on. John didn't know what to do so he just kept running his hand over Sherlock. He knew this pattern. Sherlock was stuck in a cycle in his mind, but he'd... What hoped he could work miracles?... He tugged at Sherlock's sheet until he found a way to slip his fingers against Sherlock's skin using a bit of pressure to massage his shoulders, trying to coax the muscles to let go when the mind wouldn't.
2) Pet names - I know in S3 there was some clarification given around names for the Holmes men. Since we already had Mycroft calling Greg, Greg - we left it that way. We also decided that Greg has been given some special permission by Mycroft to get away with calling him Myc' - we just do what the characters tell us.
"Stop it Sherlock! Stop touching me." Victor growled, slapping his hand away. "Yea, your best friend... After everything..." He got up and started pacing even though it hurt his head to do so. "I don't know why I agreed to this. What was I thinking that
"Then we will ask them." Victor grinned. "No, I don't use handcuffs... I just own you otherwise. Sherlock is much darker than I am..." He grinned. "Perhaps we can join them on holiday for a few days..."
"Hm..." John looked thoughtful. "Sure, but I will probably take most of it home unless you share it with me." Mycroft was surprised at how easily the two could just fade from the world and into each other.
"Sherlock and I have some last minute shopping to do since we have a new addition to the family." Mycroft offered to break the silence.
"I loved this," he began and they all knew there was a 'but' coming after that, "But... I don't think it'd be wise if we ever did it again." John raised an eyebrow and looked squarely at Sherlock. It was clear he expected an explanation to follow.
"No. You marry people you want be related to but aren't yet." Hamish said softly. "Hm..." He pouted but looked thoughtful, Greg knew
"Yep!" He giggled heading downstairs with the adults before running around the coffee table in the living room. Greg chuckled and looked back at Victor who was now hiding his face in Alex's chest.
"I don't know about being beautiful, Sherlock... I'm just... Me." He shrugged a bit. "And I'm not afraid of showing that side to you, you're the only one I could ever show it to." He whispered softly, his eyes positively drinking in every movement Sherlock made. "I love you, God I do." He whispered, his hand finding its way back into Sherlock's hair. "I wish I had told you that sooner, but I was too afraid..." He blushed. "I told you that shower was pointless." He chuckled softly, pulling Sherlock back for another kiss. Using the time their lips touched to purely worship Sherlock with his kisses, gently nipping and licking at those slightly swollen lips attached to that bloody brilliant mouth.
"Are you alright? Is the light or noise too much?" His words moving as quickly as his thoughts. John stared at Sherlock curiously, shaking his head.
"Angelo's would be lovely. Plus it's our turf." He grinned again and Sherlock licked his lips nervously. "So if they want to play the double date game they will have to play on our terms, even if we have to play dirty." John was having far too much fun and it was doing horrible things to Sherlock. Horribly wonderful things. "How many times do you think I can make Greg blush?" John winked and asked conversationally. He smoothed down his hair on instinct and retrieved his black shined shoes, completing his pseudo military look. Sherlock's eyes followed every move he made, already feeling like he was somehow in an unspoken manner being dominated by John.
"Then I will just have to work harder." John whispered and kissed down over Sherlock's jaw and onto his neck. He heard his phone chime in the other room, knowing it was Mycroft or Lestrade but he didn't move instead he focused his attention twice as intently. His hands now running over Sherlock's arms and chest over his shirt as he suckled on that gorgeous neck. "Talk out loud, Sherlock. Tell me what you experience." He whispered, his fingers finding their way under his shirt. Sherlock sucked in a breath, he had never been touched like this. Not once in his life and it was exciting and utterly terrifying.
"You've got that look on your face again." Greg said softly with a wry smirk as they pulled up to Baker Street. Mycroft had his focused but concerned look on his face. The one that he always got when he was worrying about his brother. He smirked at the confused expression on Mycroft's face. "The one that reminds me you really are related to Sherlock Holmes."
"What's wrong with Mish?" Marius asked with a pout as he now sat at the table nibbling on a cookie as he stared at Sherlock and John's bedroom door.
"I can operate fairly well on the amount of sleep I got. You were supposed to wake me up if you couldn't sleep though." He chided gently, still running his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "Why did you come out here?"
"Plans change Matthew." Mycroft said it sternly and the man fell silent. Mycroft did a final check of everything making a woeful face at the state of the refrigerator but seeing to it that the food was properly and safely stored. "Off you go." He waved the three of them out of the flat.
"A cold shower won't bother me Sherlock." He said softly his tone giving him away. He tried to act normal but he was hurt by Sherlock's decision he still couldn't trust John with the whole truth. "I guess I will shave at the sink while you shower next then." He said quietly. Sherlock could see how he was hurting John and it physically pained him to hurt him, even emotionally. He stood and wrapped his arms around John, kissing his shoulder.
