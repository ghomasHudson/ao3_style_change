"You do, John,"  Sherlock said.  "I... have never had a friend like you before.  Or indeed, at all, really."
with Mycroft.  But Sherlock looked so hopeful, that he shoved down the confusion and everything that came with it and agreed with a smile.
"Honestly, I'm still not sure," John said, several lies raising themselves in his mind and dismissing them just as quickly, he decided saying nothing was the best defence.  "Nothing as far as I can tell.  Just to annoy us both."
John woke up, almost more tired than when he'd gone to bed, his sleep restless, his mind to busy to quiet into sleep fully.
"Can we get a bottle of wine with dinner, please Angelo, white, I'll leave the exact choice to you," Sherlock requested.
Mycroft sighed.  "You are aware of course, my brother prizes his intellect above anything else.  In the past, that has included friendship, but with you, John... Sherlock is different.  I dare even say
"Tell him, John.  My brother cares for you, more than he will ever allow himself to admit, even in the privacy of his own mind, his actions are very telling in this circumstance.  If action is to be taken, you must be the one to take it."
John wanted to say it would always be so.  But he wasn't ready – may never be – to take Mycroft's word on Sherlock's feelings and he wasn't ready – knew he never
"Not nightmares," Sherlock surmised.  "You move awkwardly after nightmares as if your injuries are bothering you."
"I'll send someone over for your order in a few minutes boys," Angelo beamed at them, before scuttling off.
"Thank you," John said.  He didn't bother to pretend he didn't know what Mycroft meant – it was pointless with either of the Holmes brothers anyway.
"I realise I've taken up a lot of your time John and I do apologise, the case load has been... I will try to..."
Sherlock smiled bright and happy, the way he did when something genuinely pleased him and John let himself pat Sherlock's arm on the way past.  Happy, to make Sherlock happy, even if he was himself in a little bit of turmoil.
"You'll always be my best friend Sherlock, even if I do ever meet someone else," he settled for instead.  Less obvious, more diplomatic.  It was the absolute truth, but it felt like it wasn't.
"Sounds great, let me just get changed yeah?  Mycroft does enjoy his dingy warehouses," John said.  And it would give him enough time, hopefully to shove his feelings down far enough that Sherlock wouldn't press him about it.  Or what Mycroft had to say.
"He has no real friends to speak of, you'd surely have met them by now, yes?  No mentions of past relationships, just a vague excuse that he's married to just work.  A somewhat beneficially mutual working relationship with Lestrade and a few other police officers, who will still
John nodded agreeably, just as the waiter came to take their orders and he quickly forced the whole issue of Mycroft to the back of his mind again, instead, engaging Sherlock in conversation about their last case.  A far safer topic and Sherlock did love the chance to explain why he was a genius.
He fell down more than sat, but once their eyes met at the same level he found himself liking, as well as admiring, the woman behind them.
"Sit down, Captain Watson, and drink some whisky immediately," she said, and she was the Queen, wasn't she, so he did.  The whisky tasted real.  I mean, the glass was that heavy, cut glass that feels sharp on your tongue, and the whisky was definitely one of the fiery peppery ones, not the languid smoky ones – Talisker perhaps?  And the elephant was… thing was, it smelled of elephant.  Hallucinations don't smell real, do they?
“Sherlock.” John greeted him, settling back. He heard a huff, followed by the sound of clothes being thrown around. The water surrounding him suddenly shifted, and he peeped open his eyes to see Sherlock not so gracefully entering the jacuzzi.
John didn’t understand and it was obvious for Sherlock, who then sighed and continued, “He got sick, and my parents didn’t want to spend the amount of money it would take to make him better. I didn’t get a say in it, he was “just too expensive to keep. He could’ve been saved John.” Sherlock said, looking up at John, his voice cracking. “It wasn’t the death that upset me, it was that it was completely preventable.” He finished, taking in a deep breath, his lip quivering. John placed a hand on Sherlock jaw, slightly caressing him.
John hadn’t realised that Sherlock was in the room and so at the sound of his voice from the front of the room startled him, causing him to hiccup and looked behind his shoulder. He quickly turned away but Sherlock saw his face; his eyes were red from rubbing them, his cheeks and nose colored red and were glistening in the mellow light of the lamp on the bedside table. He was shaking slightly but Sherlock crept further and when he was next to John, he knelt down and waited for John to be comfortable in talking. It was awhile, but John finally got his breathing under control, the tears no longer coming.
Soon John had reached Sherlock’s cock and began licking and sucking the head, causing Sherlock to emit rather loud moans. He quickly placed a hand over his mouth but John looked up and said, “I…I would like to hear you.”
John moaned in pleasure, the heat of Sherlock’s mouth and the cold air around him creating goose bumps along his skin. He shivered as Sherlock swallowed around his cock, the head nearly at the back of Sherlock’s throat.
John burrowed his face into Sherlock’s neck. “When we get home, we can warm up in the shower.” He whispered.
“Shh, its okay Sherlock. You don’t need to be snappy. I just want to make sure you’re ready and that you’re comfortable.”
Sherlock shook that thought from his mind as it reappeared. He shrugged off his coat and scarf and went into the kitchen to prepare.
“Yes.” John nodded quickly before he began unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt. Once the removed the shirt he moved to Sherlock trousers and soon enough Sherlock was completely naked, goose bumps forming on his skin as he was looked at by John.
John didn’t know why he was reacting this way, but his face grew hot as he eyed Sherlock who no longer looked annoyed.
John’s eyes widened, realizing he had said that out loud. Before he could come up with something to divert Sherlock’s attention, Sherlock leaned forward, capturing John’s lips.
was now standing in the hallway. The realization came to him, creating a facial expression of excitement.
“Oh fuck…Sherlock!” John gasped. He rocked his hips in time with Sherlock, his hands tightly holding his hips. Sherlock moaned, bringing a hand down to stroke his cock. He rocked against John, their lips grazing each other's.
More fluff I know, but I needed some cheering up and so now that we have had some sex, I will try to continue on with some more angst maybe? I've been sort of stuck in a writer's block, not knowing exactly where to go with this but I will try very hard to update more regularly.
“Oh for Christ sakes!” Lestrade yelled. John walked to his door to take a glance, only to see Lestrade appear in front of it. “You two had sex didn’t you? I warned you guys. Jesus.” Lestrade rubbed his face. “Its too early for this. “ He muttered as he unlocked John out.
“Thanks mate.” John responded, and made his way back to Sherlock who was now on the floor, letting out heavy breaths, his voice ragged from the retching.
John had been talking to a group of older veterans along with Bill and Charlie when he heard high pitch laughter. Looking around, he saw Sherlock in between Layla and Emily, as well as a few other women and two unknown men. He looked rather annoyed, but was trying to be polite. John threw him an apologetically look, when one of the men leaned forward, and whispered into Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock responded with a real laugh, his eyes twinkling at the stranger. The conversation forgotten, John began to walk forward, jealously growing fast within him as he saw one of the ladies place her hand on Sherlock’s shoulder before rubbing his arm slightly.
It was over so fast. Carl Kent was kneeling on the floor, moaning in pain, clutching what was left of his hand; Sherlock was standing up, texting Lestrade. John still had his gun out, pointed at Kent, his breathing rather even for having just shot someone.
“Sherlock—oh, Sherlock.” He groaned as he swung his head back, knocking it against the window. “Oh fuck, yes, Sherlock. Harder. OH!” He gasped, as Sherlock sucked his neck hard.
Before he could stop himself, John suddenly began thinking of all the pain these people had caused him, and everything he remembered only served to fuel the fire he could feel igniting in the pit of his stomach. He thought of his wonderful father, a man who relished the impact his psychological abuse had on John and his mother. He thought of his sister Harry, an alcoholic (not at this table) who despised her blood relatives so much that she left John to suffer them all on his own. He thought of his mother, someone so numb that she didn't seem to care about her son's unhappiness or her own. He thought of the helplessness and despair he felt as a child, living in a world where these wretched people lived and breathed his misery as if it were a turn on for them, making the hand around his glass tighten with suppressed rage. He thought of all these things without shutting them out so that he could feel justified in his hatred and so far, it seemed to be working. Then his gaze fell on the person directly in front of him, and before he knew it, all of that anger he'd used as a shield vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving nothing behind but fear.
John turned and headed off, to where, he didn't know. His head was swarming with even more questions now than when he'd first entered Moriarty's humble abode. While Greg's story was starting to come into play, his own remained a huge mystery, one with enough twists and turns to keep him guessing until the bitter end.
In the corner of the room, far away from the prying eyes of its occupants, a burly gentleman of forty-seven and a half stepped in view to gaze confusedly at the panicking old man before him. "What?" he asked, accent heavy with disdain.
Yes, it is I, your wonderfully talented narrator, in the flesh. No need to adjust your sight. I have risen. After three long years, I am officially back on the market. I bet you thought I was dead, didn't you? Yeah, I'm talking to you in the corner over there. Don't think I don't see you picking your nose by the glow of your computer monitor. Disgusting.
if it was their salvation. John didn't want anything to be their salvation. He wanted it to be their doom.
Agatha Holmes clutched her cheek with care, breathing deeply as she ran the digits of her other hand through what was left of the old man's white hair. "There's really no need to fret, Barnabas. I'm just . . . sore." Agatha, being the overly dramatic woman that she was, then made a show of putting both of her palms against her face in feigned sorrow, sighing forlornly. "Oh, so sore."
Moriarty's gait was raptorial. Every step was littered with determination, the nature of it intimidating without even trying. He was a small man, yes, but not weak. There was no such thing as a weak Alpha. Everything about him, from his slicked back brown hair, to his brown eyes, to his well-tailored suit screamed class, but there was something off about his sophistication. His eyes held a bit of madness which mirrored in his contorted lips, a hint of crazy penetrating his form in a silent signal to John that said only one thing:
Anyhoo, while you must have suspected I was lying in a ditch somewhere as maggots slithered in and out of my eye sockets, I'm here to officially put all those pesky nightmares to rest. I have no excuse for my absence (unless being a jackass counts) because I can't for the life of me remember why I disappeared in the first place. That's how long it's been. All I know is that I stumbled back to AO3 for reasons completely unknown to me and found a story I barely recalled writing. I just finished skimming through the entire eight chapters and I must say, my reputation most definitely precedes me.
All these things were floating around in John's head, driving him mad with intrigue. So mad, in fact, that he somehow found himself disappearing from the room he'd originally inhabited to go off in search of Sherlock's brother, leaving a very different pair of Alphas doing the same bullshit display of power as the ones outside not even a half hour ago. Despite the size of the mansion, John quickly found what he was looking for, determination coursing through his veins at the sound of hushed voices just on the other side of the corridor.
John didn't bother to respond. Instead, he continued to watch the old man babble with what must have been a pretty stupid look on his face. Getting involved in such a crazy situation will often do that to a person, after all.
"Long enough. I suppose you want to discuss Gregory now, though I don't know how much I can disclose to you at this time."
John cursed under his breath and went into the adjoining bathroom, splashing cold water on his face while he contemplated committing suicide. Sure, he wasn't
Before going any further into the complexity of our prized couple, we must first take note of the events surrounding them at this particular time. While you may be shouting at your storyteller through whatever electronic device you are using to observe the brilliant narration put forth before your very eyes, it is highly recommended that you tap into whatever patience you possess and focus on the relationships outside of our Alpha and Omega. For you see, there comes a time in certain stories where the perspective of the narrator is needed so that you can process information necessary to understanding the bigger picture, a picture which, believe it or not, involves more than our main protagonist. Observe:
The older man might have been right about this marriage not solving a thing, but he couldn't help kicking himself in the ass for not predicting an actual bond existing between the Alpha and Omega. How was he going to keep such a situation from spiraling out of control? More importantly, how was he going to keep himself from falling prey to the same fate? Gregory Lestrade was his mate. He detested the feelings that developed at just the thought of the boy. He made Mycroft feel something he'd always thought was beneath him. For the first time in his life, it wasn't just Sherlock Mycroft needed to protect, but a certain little Omega that the Alpha was sure would one day be the death of him.
"Tell me," Mycroft said, walking slowly toward the people basking in the glow of chandelier bulbs, "what exactly is it that you people expect to get from marrying him off to some worthless Omega who won't last more than a week in my brother's presence without wanting to kill himself, hmm? Do you think that by ensuring the bond between these two particular kids that you can somehow mend the rift between our families? Do you truly believe you can attempt to right such wrongs without consequences?"
"My love," he interrupted, placing an emphasis on "love" as if he loathed the very thought of such a concept, "is reserved for myself alone. 'Love' has nothing to do with this. Given that you lot are thoroughly incapable of thought, the burden of rationality seems to have fallen on me now. Logic may escape the minds of goldfish, but it most certainly remains a prisoner within the metaphorical bars of my own. This contract you've agreed to might as well be a death warrant. My brother will never love the Omega the way an Alpha is supposed to. Given your Omega's penchant for independence, he is more than unlikely to accept this marriage anymore than my brat of a sibling will. All this is going to do is stir up more conflict between the Holmes's and the Watson's, resulting in an all out war. Surely, you must know that."
John didn't know why he bothered waiting for an answer, but when it became apparent that they'd rather stare at each other than help the poor little Omega stranded in the middle of nowhere, he threw his hands up in exasperation and headed in the direction of the mansion in the distance without once looking back to see if the Alphas had decided to follow. When he'd reached the double doors, he knocked with all the strength he could muster and waited for an answer, trying his best to ignore the little tidbit of information relating this Moriarty to a cold-blooded killer.
"Disapproved?" John repeated stupidly. "Oh, no. Quite the opposite, actually, yeah. As long as he's a rich Alpha with a big knot, that's about all an Omega can hope for, wouldn't you say, father?"
Mycroft's silence lasted longer than John was comfortable with, leaving behind a stillness that was both awkward and unpleasant when created between people who don't really know each other. When the man finally replied, his answer caught John off guard in a way that he didn't expect, the second shock of the night making him wonder if fate itself wasn't trying to give him a heart attack.
John's companion looked at him as if in a daze, a flicker of something unfamiliar invading his eyes. "You don't want me to answer that question."
Murder. There was a murder in the family. John couldn't seem to wrap his brain around the bizarre scene before him. He didn't move. He didn't panic. He didn't scream to the heavens for help. All he did was stand there and-whether or not this made him a bad man, he had no idea-wonder just why in the hell he hadn't thought of doing that to the dumb bastard when he'd had the chance..
"Our only hope hasn't even bothered to show up yet. We've got one that's M.I.A. and another one that's sitting here acting as useless as the rest of his kind. What a sorry bunch you're putting your trust in. An Omega bitch who doesn't know his place and an Alpha who can't even be bothered to keep time! That's rich!"
A look between the brothers was exchanged, leaving John with a sinking suspicion that Mycroft never told the younger Holmes about their intended destination. Their silent battle of wills was astoundingly childish to John, but he found himself unable to look away. Sherlock in particular seemed rather perturbed by John's reveal, though for what reason, he could not say. Why Mycroft would choose to keep something that seemed so trivial to John from his brother was a mystery he was keen on solving. Why did those bastards insist on keeping so many damned secrets? And what was it about those Holmes brothers that always had John questioning everything he knew about, well, everything? Damn Alphas.
From the back of the study where everyone was gathered, a man stood with his legs and arms crossed as he leaned against his father's desk. His dark hair and even darker expression immediately put the lawyer in the very awkward position of shuffling nervously in front of his general audience while being interrupted with, "Do you people honestly think this marriage is going to change a thing?"
"Of course. I may not be able to stop this wedding from taking place, but I can at least make what happens afterward bearable for the both of us. It's an extremely generous offer, one which I hope you'll accept with limited reservations."
Sherlock looked at the horizon, his arousal deepening. John smirked at the reaction he was emitting from Sherlock and continued to tease him, slowly massaging his chest, before he too became aroused, and suddenly he kissed Sherlock’s jaw bone, moving quickly behind his ear, nibbling slightly.
“No need to apologize. You clearly were convinced that I had made everything up, that I didn’t mean what I told you when you…were on the ledge.” He said, glancing around the room and then taking a seat at the small table.
After breakfast John sat down at the table between the windows with Sherlock on the other side, determined to keep his focus away from John who had ordered them to talk about Marie. It was Sherlock who suggested John have breakfast first before and thank god that worked. But now they were sitting across from each, the silence stretching on until John, annoyed but worried more, broke it.
“John, please, I’d rather we continued on kissing rather than just to use words to explain what is obviously happening here.”
“Oh, well…Sherlock and I have some sort of deal. He helps on cases, and on orders from his brother, I make sure he doesn’t relapse, or have any drugs on his person.”
“Hey Greg, do you, by chance, have any gingerale?” Greg looked at John confused, then at Sherlock, who was clutching the railing rather hard. At the sight, his eyebrows rose, and he responded,
Lestrade looked at John oddly, but whatever he was going to say was interrupted by the slamming of the door, footsteps pounding the stairs as a disgruntled Sherlock entered the flat.
When their moans and whimpers were beginning to grow louder, John burrowed his face harder against Sherlock’s bare neck. He moved a hand from gripping Sherlock’s shoulder to Sherlock’s mouth, silencing him only slightly.
John blushed and with a look of desire from Sherlock, he slid Sherlock’s pants down and started doing what he’s wanted to do for a long time to
The next two months went on normally. John was quite surprised how good Sherlock was at caring for a dog, he always fed her daily meals and made sure she always got a belly rub. It was quite extraordinary to seen the detective, who was usually so harsh and kept his emotions hidden, to be really caring and joyful.
“John!” Sherlock ran after him and nearly hit his face on the slammed door. “John!’ Sherlock banged on the door. “John, open up, please, just let me in.” He rattled the doorknob but it was locked.
“Great! Do you have a particular preference or did you just want to look around, see who you connect with?”
Sherlock’s right nipple and causing Sherlock to arch into the touch and let out a low moan. Humming in pleasure, John moved on to the left one and then moved back up and began sucking his neck, determined to leave a mark.
“Great. Yeah...this is lovely.” John answered, setting his bag full of some clothes and a book down onto the table. He then walked over to the armchair that sat across from a more squared one.
“Oh right, I can help you with that. I have a sock index so I’ll need to reorganize everything to make room for your things. Come on.” Sherlock said, making his way towards his-their bedroom. John followed.
“Murder, the victim was a public figure or something. Come on John. The game is on!” Sherlock responded, bouncing down the stairs.
John led Sherlock outside of the ballroom, onto the deserted balcony. The cold air did nothing to him as he pushed Sherlock against a wall, a few vines hiding them from view.
John looked down at him, his cheeks flushing deeper than it already was. “I do too. But we shouldn’t keep them waiting.”
John and Sherlock headed across the docks to Greg and Molly, who were standing by a beautiful, 95-foot sailboat, apparently named
“Sherlock…” His voice shook and before Sherlock could react, John was on top of him, their lips crushed together. John’s left hand was treading itself through Sherlock’s hair as his right hand slide in between them, stroking Sherlock’s clothed cock.
“Sherlock.” John whispered, following him swiftly. The street was practically empty, a few homes dark and others with a light or two on.
“I can just…take care of that…in the bathroom.” Sherlock said, trying to sit up only to be held down by John.
“John.” Sherlock said, more clearly, standing up, placing a hand onto John’s shoulder. “John, you need to wake up.” He spoke, ready for another hit but relaxed slightly when he noticed John’s breathing was slowing down, his body relaxing.
John stayed seated, glancing around the flat. It felt warm, but the warmth didn’t comfort him. He felt too many things at once, causing him to feel overwhelmed the most, and within only a few minutes, John got up quickly and practically ran to the bathroom, emptying his stomach. After a few dry heaves, John stood in front of the mirror and cleaned his mouth, followed by a glass of water. The realization of what happened hit him, and he bowed his head in shame, his eyes stinging. After a few minutes, he took a deep breath and pulled out the pill bottle he was prescribed. They said to take one every morning, and so he did.
“Yeah, yeah of course, here.” He kneeled down slightly to the mini refrigerator, grabbing a can of gingerale.
“You were able to take Kent down. I could’ve been injured and you stopped that from happening. So thank you.” Sherlock said, quietly.
John rested his cheek against Sherlock pink chest. “Sherlock…” He started, titling his head up. Sherlock's eyes were closed, and after a second John realized he was fast asleep. Smiling, John turned slightly to turn the light off before resting back against Sherlock's chest, sleep enveloping him quickly.
John relaxed too. “I think its betrayal. We’ve been in each other’s company for two months, but we didn’t exactly get to know one another. We’ve never even gone out on a date.”
rooms. He pouted silently as he made his way from room 800 to 805, the next room on his list of checked out rooms. He knocked first, had learned that mistake of not knocking in room 609, and waited. There was no sound so he assumed the guest had gone down to an early breakfast. He unlocked the door and made his way in.
“Look, Dr. Watson, although you did assault someone in front of numerous officers, and you did have a illegal weapon on you, given what happened and the whole situation, myself and the superintendent have agreed to let you go without charges.”
The two laid down on top the table, slicked in come and sweat, worn out. John was the first to break the silence.
Sherlock stopped midway from getting up and slowing sat back down. John was glaring at him but he looked more worried than angry.
John blushed deeply at that and giggled softly before leaning in to press a kiss to Sherlock’s nose. He moved around his face, placing soft chaste kisses along Sherlock’s cheekbones, forehead, and nose before finally pressing a kiss onto his lips. They began slow, copying each other’s movements, deepening the kiss but still at a slow pace. But it soon became rather hot in the bedroom and Sherlock broke the kiss suddenly to peel off his shirt, revealing his pale smooth chest. John, in awe of his beauty, caressed his chest and began placing kisses along his collarbone and down his upper chest. He
“Mhm. I have a better idea.”  Sherlock said, and before John could think what he meant, he was being pushed into the ambulance, the doors closing right behind. They were thankfully alone, John realised, as Sherlock gently pushed him onto the stretcher.
John's breathing grew ragged as Sherlock lowered himself onto John. The two men gasped as pleasure erupted through them. Once Sherlock was seated fully on John, he wasted no time. He rocked his hips, instantly feeling John's cock brush his prostate.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but offered up what John thought was his attempt at a comforting expression. John gulped again.
“Carl Kent’s place. His wife was found murdered in their backyard. Nothing was taken from the house, but the front door had been broken down. Seems like an attempted burglary gone wrong. But footsteps found around the body are practically identical to Kent’s.”
“I…” John’s smile faltered before completely turning into a frown. “I…I like to be close with you Sherlock…”
I realized i didn't want to continue with a case so i finished this one up and im sorry its weird. And I am so sorry i haven't updated in forever! I promise I will try to update more frequently. I have some idea now where to go with this so I will be updating a lot sooner now : )
“Long time no see!” John exclaimed. He hugged Charlie and then turned slightly around, wrapping an arm around Sherlock.
Lestrade led them out of the car and through the precinct. “In here.” He said, indicating them into a cell block. “Not a word. No snoggging. Please. You are being held here for public indecency. You’ll both be out by morning.” He said, his voice showings signs of lack of sleep. He uncuffed them and not so gently shoved them into the cell.
After leaving some dry towels and blankets down next to them, Lestrade and Molly left them alone, blushing slightly.
Sherlock nodded, his pupils dilating more. John removed his hand from Sherlock’s mouth to his trousers. He began unzipping Sherlock’s trousers as he placed his lips back on Sherlock’s neck, sucking hard. Sherlock withered beneath him, legs trembling slightly. John shucked Sherlock’s trousers and pants down far enough to reveal his aching cock and plump arse. He grasped Sherlock’s arse, slapping it slightly, which caused Sherlock to gasp loudly. John pulled back, covering Sherlock’s mouth again with his hand.
Sherlock looked expectantly at John who stepping forward, handing the woman a folder with all the essentials.
As John sat down on the bed and began pulling Sherlock on top of him, Sherlock halted, his nerves growing.
The next few chapters will be a bit short, but I will try to make them long. Apologies for such "interesting" chapter titles
“No luck?” John asked, a smile growing on his face as he looked over at Sherlock, who was hunched at his seat, glaring at the computer.
He slowly and efficiently prepared John as he sucked a mark on the side of John’s neck, the doctor’s moans and praises growing louder and rougher as Sherlock fucked him with his fingers.
Sherlock snapped his head up, his eyes now adjusting to the fact that John wasn’t on the floor anymore, and he flushed harder, the summer heat doing no help for his and John’s arousal. He cleared his throat, trying to provide any answer when John causally walked over to him.
John blinked, completely not expecting that and although he believed it to be impressive, was rather pissed off at the mention of the gun and with a rush of anger, he punched the tall man sending him to the ground. Before two officers could swarm in to detain John, he grasped the man off the ground by the lapels of his coat and whispered, “Just because that was impressive does not mean I am not going to hurt you.” The tall man looked surprised at the word “impressive”, but before he could respond, John shoved the man back to the ground as officers swiftly lead him away.
John nodded, his throat tight, his eyes letting out the last few tears. He leaned forward, wrapping his arms around Sherlock, who stiffened at first, but then relaxed and wrapped his arms around John’s waist.
The small man brandished his stick and the empty green sofa directly opposite to John vanished.  In its place was a baby elephant.  John found himself on his feet and was embarassed to realise the girlish squeaking noise had also come from him.
Once upon a time there was a doctor who was also a soldier who was wounded in a war.  He came to live in Baker Street with a mad genius consulting detective, followed the clues from a pink suitcase, shot a man who was trying to kill the mad genius (but don't tell Lestrade) and heard the name "Moriarty" for the first time.
She rang a bell and the strangest man John Watson had ever seen walked in.  He was about three feet tall, wearing a robe like a graduate gown, and carrying a pointed stick.  He bowed to Her Majesty and then took up position on the carpet opposite her, with John at his right and a small silk-covered sofa, matching the one John was sitting on, to his left.
Mycroft withdrew, and John Watson found himself standing at attention in front of a small elderly woman.   He focused on the turquoise dress, triple string of pearls and diamond and pearl brooch rather than the face he had known all his life if only from postage stamps.
"Doctor Watson," the man who was the British Government said, "I have a number of things to tell you that are going to be hard for you to hear."
"This is Harry.  He's my orphan nephew.  I'm adopting him.  I thought he could have my room upstairs.  Mycroft's people have just about finished childproofing the flat while you were lost to the world, and apparently Mrs Hudson has another flat downstairs that Mycroft is going to rent for you to use as a lab.  Problem?"
"Harry's parents were part of the world of magic.  His uncle and aunt are not.  I am told that it is likely, when Harry is eleven, he will receive a letter inviting him to attend a school of witchcraft and wizardry, but until then it seems he is at risk of magical harm unless he is living with a blood relative.  Absent the abusive aunt, that means you, Captain Watson.  The members of the magical community are as much Our Subjects as the rest of us and I do not approve of any of Our children being persecuted for their background.  It is necessary, for reasons which you do not need to know but which I assure you are entirely real, for him to live with a blood relative and it is important that his whereabouts remain unknown by the magical community.  It is therefore Our Command that you adopt your nephew and raise him as an ordinary small boy.  Do you have any questions?"
It was an elephant, he thought.  His brain had stopped working properly, because it was telling him that… the Queen… had summoned a dwarf… with a wand… who had transfigured a sofa… into an elephant.  Mycroft must have slipped him a hallucinogen in the car, because as if meeting the queen wasn't weird enough there was no freaking way sofas turn into elephants…
"Magic is real.  There's an entire culture of magic users living quietly and separately amongst us.  Do you believe me?"
Buckingham Palace was slightly shabbier than he had expected, inside.  He wondered if he could get away with nicking an ashtray or something for Sherlock, by way of a souvenir.  After all, being thrown into the Tower for treasonous larceny wouldn't be the strangest thing that had happened to him so far today.
"Stanley Evans, quite.  Would it surprise you to know that he was, in fact, your biological father?"
"Bear with me.  The… provenance… of Stanley Evans' relationship with your mother and therefore with you we can come to in a moment.  As you may know, he moved away and lost contact with your family when you were quite a small child.  You may not know that he went on to have two daughters.  The younger of those daughters was killed in a tragic incident a few months ago, leaving a one year old infant.  The infant was placed with his aunt, the elder of the two daughters of Stanley Evans, where it was thought he would thrive alongside his cousin.  Unfortunately his has proved not to be the case.  The aunt's family are wholly unsuitable to raise a child and have, in fact, been arrested for child abuse.  You may wish to know for example that they thought it appropriate to house their young charge in a cupboard under the stairs.  Ah.  I see we are arriving…"
"Have been for nearly an hour," John said, finishing assembling the cot.  He made sure Sherlock was actually looking in his direction and gestured towards the playpen.
But there was, indeed, a block of cheese, around six foot tall and six feet wide, where the sofa used to be.
The little man (Dwarf? Goblin? Elf?) flourished his wand and the cheese was a sofa again.  Then he bowed and left in the ordinary way, walking, opening the door before him and shutting it behind him, the whole thing.
Then the Doctor and the Genius went back to the flat they shared in Baker Street, kissed on the staircase, fell into bed together, and lived happily ever after.  Even Mrs Hudson was happy, because she finally had something to brag about when Mrs Turner next door went on about her married ones.
"I'm sorry this has to be such a brusque introduction to the world of magic but I really have very little time this morning.  The users of magic have been living alongside us for centuries, quietly, unseen.  Mycroft is my liaison with their government, led by their Minister of Magic.  I have various protections around me, as do some of the senior members of my government like Mycroft.  I am going to give you this…"
“Mhm.” Sherlock hummed, kissing John roughly. “Your arse is on view you know.” He whispered against John’s lips.
Sherlock was currently looking through photos of the murder of Isabelle Delacour, a graduate student in animal behavioral studies. John busied himself looking through information about the victim and at the words painting on Isabella’s bookshelf.
John looked at the cabbie and then at the gun and then did he realise he too had a gun. He gulped and carefully observed the cabbie and the way he held the gun. It was then rather clear to him that the cabbie’s gun wasn’t real. He knew a real gun when he saw one and he felt rather stupid for not noticing it first.
“I like sex. It…it makes me feel good knowing I can…make others-Sherlock-feel good.” He said, blushing. “And it makes me forget.” He said, sort of as an afterthought.
It wasn’t long before Sherlock came, followed right away by John, their cum mixing as Sherlock slumped forward onto John, who wrapped his arms around Sherlock as they caught their breath.
“You…” Sherlock cheeks reddened slightly at the memories. “You have been much more…sexual in the past few weeks.
Sherlock smiled back, the air in the room turning silently as the two stared at each other. They were brought back to the present with the awkward cough from the inspector.
"Please understand, John. I didn't want any of you to suffer. We all thought that if a Holmes developed a bond with a Watson that we could unite our families through them. You may not know this, but when you and Sherlock were children, we had the two of you meet. From the moment you both laid eyes on each other, I knew, John. We all knew. It was destiny. This thought of an arranged marriage was placed in our heads through divine intervention. I believe there is a higher power up there somewhere, and I can't help but think they were smiling down on us all the day we discovered the undeniable proof that you and my son were meant to be."
More silence. Then, "Well, I certainly wouldn't blame him for being late. The boy is obviously nervous and is stalling. I remember when I first found Frederick-"
The pieces from John's conversation with Mycroft on the phone the other day finally fell into place. "When you told me you'd talk father into letting me go away . . . the part where you told me it would be a place of my choosing . . . you lied to me?"
Holy hell, Batman! I am so overjoyed at the number of reviews I've gotten so far, and completely surprised that everyone seems to be liking the narrator. Thank you guys so much for the support. I wasn't expecting to have this chapter up so quickly, but I'm really glad that it is. The next one won't be up until sometime next week, what with Halloween and all that. I hope you all like this one and I look forward to seeing y'all real soon. Toodles!
"Quiet," Ichabod hissed at his son. "You don't get to speak after the nonsense you pulled before your Alpha came through that door."
"There's still hope," he heard from behind him. "I know it doesn't seem like it now, but maybe we're doing the best thing for everyone and we just don't know it yet. There's no need to worry your pretty little head over it just yet, hon. Everything will be just fine."
John's mouth opened slightly in understanding. So, that's who this was? One of Moriarty's . . . playthings? Were they even in a relationship? Or was he some kind of male escort there to satisfy all of this Jim's disgusting fantasies? Only time would tell, he supposed.
It wasn't his fault. He knows that. He's simply a person of admirable determination. He was determined to drown away his sorrows in a bottle and prevent himself from going off into La La Land. He did both. However, certain times in life require submission, regardless of a person's dominant nature, and John's overworked brain was certainly making damned sure he knew the ramifications of ignoring his need for some serious shut-eye. That didn't matter, though, because he was determined-yes, DETERMINED-to soldier on. Not even science was going to prevent him from surviving another sleepless night unscathed, and if fate should try to interfere with John's plans, fate would get a great big kick in the nuts . . . so to speak.
Sherlock gave him a knowing look. "John. You may be able to lie to everyone else in your life, but you can't lie to me."
John's head slumped in defeat. Of all the bullshit he'd had to deal with the past couple days, this definitely took the cake. "I don't see what choice I have."
"He's going to be fine," Sherlock said, addressing Mycroft. "Nothing more than a panic attack. By the looks of it, he's been having them for a while."
When two families get together to put aside their differences through a marriage, it is generally preferred that the lovely couple be present for the good of all that are involved . . .
It took John a moment to realize that the call for order had come from him. When his brain caught up with the situation, something inside of him snapped.
What does he do? Where do they go from here? Would it be wrong if he acknowledged the bond he shared with Mr. Holmes? Would it anger John?
"Can I help you?" he asked, voice much deeper than the Omega anticipated, and heavily dripping with distrust.
"You people are fucking crazy! Why the hell do you want to drag me and my mate to some random location? What has Greg done, huh? What could he possibly be involved in?"
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. After searching the other boy's face, he replied, "I require an assistant."
"I understand your frustration," Greg said, standing beside his best friend. Following John's eyes, he looked across the street at the group of Alphas giggling like school children at recess, ignoring the way his breath mingled with his companion's in the cold autumn air. "With all the hype society gives them, people like us can't help but wonder what the hell they have that we don't."
Pontius Watson, father to Olivia Watson, cut her off. "Nobody gives a good goddamn about that boy, Ingrid. He was nothing but trouble."
The thought of Greg was what finally made John speak up, taking a bit of pleasure in the fact that he was breaking the rules by speaking without an Alpha's permission. "Hello."
John's eyes snapped open at the familiar baritone voice. His sight immediately found the black shoes standing on the floor and traveled up, past the black trousers and purple shirt until those damn blue eyes pierced a hole right through him the way they'd done the first time he'd ever been cursed with their presence. A chill slid down his spine, slipped into his knickers and implanted itself in his groin.
"I want you to take care of him. I can't explain, and I don't want you to say anything to him about this, but the boy has included himself in something that runs deeper than you can ever imagine. I've taken liberties to make sure he has a safe place to stay, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to accompany him on his journey."
Mycroft shot John a threatening look. "I know this is all sudden right now, Sherlock, but do try to trust me when I tell you that I know what I'm doing."
"Right . . . okay, then. Well, it's 7:15 now. The Holmes family should be here soon, so you'd better get ready."
"Listen to me," Ichabod snarled quietly. "I will not be made a fool of. I was informed that the set price was 1,000,000 pounds. You assured me that if the money was delivered by tomorrow, John would be out of the question."
Stillness tightened its hold on the Watson home, one word echoing off the walls like voices in a cave.
John looked into his Alpha's eyes. He saw something there he couldn't quite place. Sure, there was that logical, emotionless rationality Sherlock flaunted, but there was something else beyond that, something John wished he could identify.
The discussion of a mating between an Alpha and Omega must obviously prompt a few quizzical stares, and so we shall now delve into the differences surrounding the Alphas, Omegas, and Betas. Yes, we must never leave out the Betas, for it was one Beta in particular that served as a referee for a different coupling that the reader will certainly see at a later time, one which John will be very much involved in-
The sound of his cell blazed through the quiet of his room, disrupting his thoughts. Frowning, he picked up and recited his usual "Hello?" into the speaker.
Mycroft was one hell of a secretive man, but John was patient. While he may have been able to keep so much inside of him for so long, it was only a matter of time before the now angry Omega discovered every single one of Mycroft's guilty secrets. He makes his friend commit murder, drags him and John into a mess they don't understand and manipulates them on every turn. After what he'd just heard with Mycroft and Greg, John was more determined than ever to get to the bottom of Pontius' death. While John didn't hate to see the man go, Pontius was obviously involved in something that could have possibly implicated Mycroft, leading the man to have him murdered. But why make Greg do it? What role did John have in this? Could it have something to do with the strange phone call Ichabod received about John? Were John, Greg, and possibly Sherlock the only ones in the dark here?
All of John's thoughts flew out the window as Sherlock came impossibly closer, so close that the Omega could feel his body heat through their clothing. While Sherlock's offer was more than tempting, John just couldn't see why he should trust someone he barely knew enough to put his life into their hands. What if he was lying? This could just be some play on his emotions, couldn't it? Although . . . if that were true, what reason could Sherlock have for lying? It was clear that he didn't want to get married anymore than John did. What if he really was being sincere? While John found it incredibly hard to trust an Alpha, Sherlock made an excellent point about them not all being the same. What if he was different? What if he deserved more credit than John was giving him?
-were brought into this godforsaken world. Through the gossip trickled down over the years, John, of course, learned that he was bound to be married. As one might imagine, he wasn't exactly thrilled with the idea.
"Very attractive, too," John said, wincing slightly at the sudden jealousy that overtook the Alpha. Why was he so possessive of the Omega? A man like that couldn't love . . . could he?
The room fell silent as the stench of greed filled the air. Across the street, the sound of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata could be heard through the open window, ivory keys darkening the atmosphere with their woeful lamentations. With wind rustling the pale orange leaves of trees made bare by fall, the issue that determined to be taken care of was given nature's soundtrack so that it may know of autumn's understanding and willful participation in giving voice to the urgency of resolution.
wondering just where in the hell he was. With the exception of the ticking brought forth by the grandfather clock, the dinner table was silent as eyes darted from one face to the next, each person trying to figure out the reactions of the other.
The chiming of the clock inside the house warned John that the hour of death was upon him, and it was with obvious reluctance that he fought the urge to tear the Alphas apart, instead turning from his friend and heading inside to get ready, trusting that Greg would follow (which he did). Stepping inside, he took a look at his surroundings, shaking his head in defeat.
Sherlock finally found one. Within 10 minutes, the paperwork was dealt with and Sherlock began leading their new puppy out the door when John stopped him.
“John. I enjoy working cases.” Sherlock responded. “Lestrade is the only detective inspector who can stand me. I like the puzzle and waiting for clients isn’t ideal. For Mrs. Hudson, the flat, and now for you.”
“Oh…John…now, please…” Sherlock whispered, his voice hitching as John’s two fingers brushed against his prostate.
“Obvious. The guest list says you checked in around 10 pm last night and from the evidence in the room you didn’t bring any possessions apart from the clothes on your back and your cane. You didn’t even bring your cell phone. You clearly put a lot of thought in this suicide with your ID and note on the table in clear view. The only question is…why?”
Sherlock woke up to a rather unfortunate feeling. Blinking in the dark, his nose stinging, he looked at the sleeping figure next to him and it suddenly became apparent to him that John was having a nightmare. Swiftly, Sherlock turned the light on and began eyeing John. He was sweating slightly, turning his head to the side. His face was contorted as if he was in pain and with no warning, a hand shot up and the next thing Sherlock knew was that he was now on the on his back on the floor, the side of his head hurting. It was then he realised he was woken up from John’s smacking him in then nose.
“Of course not John, I’m perfectly capable of not getting seasick, I just have to keep my eyes on-” And at that moment,
“I’m giving you a choice; you can choose a bottle and take the pill or you can get a bullet in between your eyes.” He lifted the gun. “Your choice.”
Late morning sunshine shined through the room, waking John up. He stretched and finding the spot next to him warm but empty. Surprised that Sherlock had stayed in bed a lot longer than usual, John got up and plucked one of Sherlock’s robes from the floor and made his way to the kitchen where he found to be clean. Before he could comment, Sherlock, who had been hunched over the microscope, looked up and said, “Mrs. Hudson did the cleaning.”
Once at Scotland Yard, John found himself surrounded by noise and people, and he was beginning to feel unease. Sherlock was bickering with the detective inspector—
“Go away John. I don’t want to talk about my feelings.” The last word said in such a disgusted tone, John cringed.
John minutely flinched, startled.  “No, I—it would have been tempting, so I’m sorry. I’m sorry for embarrassing you—.”
Sherlock looked at John, and noticed his eyes were sparkling. Without needing to speak a single word, John titled his head. Sherlock smirked slightly before leaning forward, capturing John’s lips. The two kissed harshly, and roughly, a red faced Lestrade trying desperately to maintain to the speed limit.
These words sounds familiar but John couldn’t figure out why. He ate his sandwich on autopilot, running the words through his mind for about ten minutes.
“Oh…John.” Sherlock hummed, turning his head to capture John’s lips with his own, tasting himself mixed with John. They swirled their tongues together for a bit until John pulled off, a slight grimace on his face.
Sherlock sucked in a breath before scooting back a bit to allow room for John to stretch out a bit. John followed suit, quickly sliding fully under Sherlock, and with the help of Sherlock’s quick hands, they both got John’s trousers and pants down past his knees, the shocking cold air causing John to gasp.
Sherlock looked at John, who, despite his eyes being raw and still wet, and his nose runny, and frankly looking like a mess, was smiling.
John rearranged himself, pulling his trousers down enough to reveal his cock. He lifted Sherlock higher a bit a he aligned himself with Sherlock’s entrance.
He didn’t have to wait much longer when he heard the soft click of the front door, followed by the very distinct footsteps of John, carrying two—no three—bags of groceries.
As the detective and doctor stood in the elevator, laughter erupted, causing John to pin Sherlock to the wall.
Sherlock’s lips twitched to the promise of a grin. “I do.” The grin fell and was quickly replaced by uncertainty. “Do you mind?”
“He was a dog, John. And I was a child. Nothing more John. I don’t…I don’t want to talk about his anymore John.”
“Alright, Lestrade, I get it. Can we go-o?” The bite in the snap lost due to the sudden stutter in Sherlock’s voice as he became more aware of how cold he was.
“I’m sorry John, I don’t know what to do. I was going to tell you but there was never a good time…and I never usually wait for a good time to say anything but I knew you needed time…to get used to me….and I didn’t want to scare you off-“
“I…” John started, but he remembered feeling bored and overwhelmed, and he didn’t want to appear weak in front of Sherlock, so he looked away before speaking again. “I…I was tired.”
. And with that, John discarded his sandwich, and made his way as quickly as possible back to Scotland Yard.
“John,” Sherlock said, breaking the kiss. “I…I may have a list…actually.” He said, suddenly feeling shy.
“Yeah…” The man said quietly, apparently in thought. “That was really…impressive….um….have we met before? Those deductions…your voice…its all sort of familiar…”
Sherlock smirked which only caused John to crash their lips together, nipping at Sherlock’s already swollen lips.
“In here.” The cabbie broke the silence, and walked in front of John opening a door, still pointing the gun at John. John went into the dimly lit room and the cabbie followed behind leading them to sit face to face at one of the tables.
As John rested against Sherlock, Sherlock said quietly, “Mycroft’s men stopped by with the rest of your belongings. We could…I mean I could help you unpack tomorrow if you want?”
This sudden movement caused Sherlock to turn slightly green, and before John could even regain his steady footing, Sherlock hurled his upper body over the railing, letting out last night’s dinner.
John woke up with a start. His cheek was stinging, and there was a heavy weight pressing into his side. Blinking away the dizziness and blurriness, John looked in front of him to see Sherlock leaning over him, panic written across his face.
The two men suddenly broke apart at an abrupt knock. John looked quizzically at Sherlock who seemed unfazed as he made his way to the door.
any people out. He went back to what he was thinking yesterday before John had interrupted him. He was thinking of John, obviously, and was trying to and failing in remembering when he started getting the fluttering sensation in his lower abdomen. These thoughts about his straight flatmate had only led him in an intense sexual fantasy that left him hard and snappy when the actual man had interrupted him, leaving him hard and causing him to sit rather tight and uncomfortable while John persuaded him to go sailing with him and Greg. That’s been happening a lot, getting hard whenever John entered his mind, or worse, his vision. Maybe with the intense cold air, he wouldn’t this time.
Sherlock gasped, and practically jumped out of the shower, shampoo dripping from his hair as he ran naked to the kitchen where his phone was.
Feeling sorry and anger at Sherlock at the same time, John stood up straighter and let out what was practically an order.
At the bedsit, John sat on his bed, a gun in his left hand and an almost empty bottle of whiskey in his right. The hand with the gun shook slightly, the tremor going through his whole left side. He took another gulp of the burning liquid. After ten minutes, John got up slowly and then placed the gun back in its drawer, and threw the now empty bottle away.
John’s breath caught, and he let out a rather shaky breath. He kept his eyes closed while he spoke. “I’m sorry about the bed.”
“Let me.” Sherlock said, swiftly unbuttoning John’s jeans and pulling them along with his pants completely off. John ended up naked from the waist down, his jeans and underpants thrown without a thought to the floor. Sherlock ran his hands along John’s naked skin, emitting goose bumps to form as he then grasped John’s arse, pulling him closer. He kissed John harshly, causing John to moan in pleasure.
Sherlock didn’t reply, but walked over to the mouse trap lying on the table. “And you expect to catch one with
“Um…I would love to Sherlock…but I don’t think that’s a good idea…my therapist said to start easy…she didn’t think that me moving in was a good idea but my progress was good and so…I think I should start slow with the newness of all this…” John answered quietly.
The two men laid there, Sherlock’s arse now in full view. Sherlock looked at John, and when their eyes met, they both burst out laughing.
“I was just worried, Sherlock. Seeing you broken up over Marie made me realise you don’t get attached easily and I wanted to be careful and take things slow. Obviously that didn’t happen but I’m not complaining, last night was….was just perfect Sherlock, and I would like to do that again…more often” He looked up at Sherlock who had blushed a rather deep color at the mention of last night and the idea of doing that more often.
“Have you continued to do sexual acts that you are not comfortable with but continue them to make Sherlock happy?”
Sherlock looked up at the family, all gushing over Marie as she licked them in greeting and in one last attempt, he chocked out “but I cared for her” and without a response, Sherlock spun on his heel and sprinted back home.
Sherlock interrupted John but crushing their lips together. John immediately relaxed into Sherlock’s hold and he snogged back relentlessly. Their lips moved beautifully, sucking and nipping at each other.
Silence once again filled the flat, but it was a calm silence. John sat on the sofa, slowly threading his fingers through Sherlock’s curls while he slept off the emotional and sentimental day. While he slept, John began to think about where their relationship was going but realised that he and Sherlock were meant to be together and thinking too much into it will not do any good. So instead, John ever so tenderly rearranged them so that they were spooning, him against the back the sofa, hugging Sherlock and soon he too was fast asleep.
“Of course I’m serious Sherlock! The mouse didn’t do any actual harm, but I would like to catch it to release back to nature where it belongs, Jesus.”
Lestrade than sat up and unlocked the handcuffs from John and lead him out of the building with the information for the future therapy sessions.
“You’re welcome. I admit I’m not very good with interacting with people but I felt I at least should see how you were doing.
Sherlock huffed, but didn’t say anything until he was right in front of John, ushering the paramedic away with a glare.
Sherlock, upset but trying hard not to show it, shook his head. He reached over gently and took John’s hand in his and squeezed lightly. To Sherlock’s relief, John squeezed back and kept his hand there.
But after the heartbreaking relationship John developed with his commanding officer, Major James Sholto, John tried to just date women and hoped he could find a wife who would tolerate his nightmares and his limp but that never happened. And after returning home one last time after being shot and seeing the demons of war, he slowly fell into depression until that a particular day in late January.
Everyone stood in silence until Ichabod broke the ice. "And just what in the hell do you think you're doing?"
Regretfully, the narrator is now going to have to withdraw from the storytelling and allow John's thoughts to explain what is currently happening in the story for you, as her ego and bum are hurting too much to go on. We shall meet again, reader. Until then, enjoy the show, and may you be blessed with better coördination than that of . . . well, you get the picture.
Mycroft walked away and left John alone, obviously assuming he would follow. And why wouldn't he? What other choice did he really have? He could resist, but that would only add more fuel to the fire and that was not something the Omega wanted at this point in time. He could, however, make the man's life a living hell. He'd come to the conclusion that he was going to do the same with Sherlock, partnership be damned. Why not give equal treatment to the brother-in-law as well?
A chance to escape from beneath his domineering father's iron fist? How in the world could he possibly say no? There was just thing he had to ask.
