“You have utterly ruined me, Doctor.” I placed a small kiss to his neck, God I loved the sounds he made. John ran his hands down my back and I couldn’t help but relax against him.
“If you don’t tell me, you’re going with me.” Sherlock, stubborn as all hell, didn’t say a word. They left early that morning, packing the car for the day. “Do you want me to drive?” John asked.
“Mhmm!” Rosie handed him the picture and he stopped, frowning a bit. “That’s me and you and Sherly and auntie Molly and uncle Greg and uncle Myc!” John and Sherlock were holding hands in the picture.
I roll my eyes this time. He truly is an idiot. I could have injected elsewhere, he should know better as a doctor. But I push up my sleeves and show him. Clean, no marks, no bruises. John’s whole body relaxes with relief and he goes to turn off the kettle that begins to whistle. He pours two cups but one will go cold.
“Umm…” Though he was young, he was rarely at a loss for words but there was something about his father that sent his heart racing and his palms sweating.
“God, Sherlock I’ve been wanting to tell you for, ages. Our friendship is the world to me but, I want more.”
“A complete nutcase but he’s one of a kind…flaws and all. He’s saved my life countless times and I his and that’s what we do…that’s how we move forward. When one of us is down, the other carries his weight and we move on.”
When Sherlock came home late that night, he quietly made his way to his bedroom. He switched on the lights and paused as he saw an envelope on his bed. His blood ran cold as he he approached the bed and opened it. He recognised John’s handwriting immediately.
Sherlock’s mobile rang, assuming it was a client, he picked it up, his eyes still trained on his microscope. He stood suddenly, his chair falling to the floor with a crash as he ran down the steps of 221B, grabbing his coat and forgoing the taxi, he set off at a sprint. He burst into the A&E, rushing up to the desk, “What room is John Watson in, I don’t have time for your incompetence, what room is my husband in!”
Sherlock could hear muffled voices of the doctor speaking with his parents in the other room and he wasn’t going to stick around and wait for his parents to yell at him.
“Daddy? We’re making a family tree but I don’t have a mum…can I put Sherly there instead?” John paused for a moment.
“I can’t have a conversation with a dead man.” He rolled his eyes and grabbed another biscuit. His mothers face paled.
“John. It’s fine. I didn’t mean to…I should go.” He turned quickly, striding back to the plane but John followed. “John, what are you-“ He tried to protest as John yanked him inside the plane, everyone dispersing into their respective compartments of the plane, thinking that a row would be ensuing. “John-“
It was never signed. John frowned, trying to understand what it meant. He had been receiving these letters for months now and he didn’t know what to make of them. Someone was very adamant about expressing their…devotion to John but he had no idea who it was.
Sherlock shrugged, looking out the window, a smile still on his lips as he thought of John. “I told the truth.”
They got to the beach and John laid out a blanket. They found a rather secluded spot which John knew would be best. He took off his shirt and smiled as the sun hit his skin. “As much as I hated the war…I miss the warmth sometimes.” He looked over at Sherlock who was sitting on the blanket, arms wrapped around his legs. “Love, you’re going to get heat stroke. Do you have your swimsuit on under?” Sherlock nodded but didn’t move. “Come on then.”
Sherlock either didn’t notice or care that John was in a mood that morning. He grabbed the nearly cold tea and munched on a few biscuits and despite John’s irritation, he was glad to see Sherlock eat something.
“My?” He stood just inside the room, the bird loose in his hand. His brother had his eyes closed, fingers still plucking away. Sherlock frowned as he remembered his brother announcing at dinner the last time he was home that he would only like to be called his full given name. Of course their parents approved, it was more formal, grown up. Sherlock cleared his throat and tried again.
“I did. Took twelve and a half minutes to solve. The criminal class has become dreadfully dull.” Sherlocks phone chimed with a text and he picked it up, groaning as he read the text.
With a hand leaning against a tree to hold him up, Sherlock took deep breaths to calm himself, looking around at his surroundings. He didn’t recognize this part of the forest. The trees were thicker and left little space in between which saved him from feeling much of the rain. It had grown dark as he ran and he could barely see a few feet in front of him. Fear ran through him for only a moment before he took a deep breath and let himself calm down, all he had to do was retrace his steps, he could easily follow the trail back. He nodded to himself and turned back to follow his foot prints in the mud but to his horror, they were gone. His heart started to race and he looked around for any sign of where he had come from. There was nothing obvious but to turn around and hope he was heading back in the way he came. The forest grew more dense and quiet, the rain must have eased but the dead silence only made him more anxious. He pulled off the heavy rain soaked jumper, shivering with cold even in the late summer heat.
John knew he wouldn’t get any answers with Sherlock in this state. He sighed and helped Sherlock lay down, placing a blanket over him. “Mmm John…are you angry at me?”
“John, I…” He was utterly bewildered but John could see the slight upturn of his lip and the glint that began in his eyes. John began to grin.
“I’d love to. Pick me up at one.” John grinned and started back to school, Sherlock following numbly after him.
“I’m not stupid! I heard what you said to my parents.” The doctor acted as if he had no idea what Sherlock was talking about and it just made him angrier. “I’m not a sociopath!” Dr. Yates sighed and briefly wrote in his notebook.
“Bach’s violin concerto in A minor. I usually prefer Mendelssohn but his music is a bit too cheerful for the occasion.”
“John,” Sherlock says, his voice even deeper than usual. His eyes that currently shine dark blue in the dim light of the hallway stare at me, before he adds “We should leave.”
“When I was younger my mum used to take me and Harry to local farms during holidays, we were too broke to go anywhere else.” John shrugs his shoulders.
Something about the situation seems wrong. It's a slight detail that doesn’t reveal itself to Sherlock yet. He thinks about the case, but there is practically no chance that he won’t solve it tomorrow. The solution has to be quite simple. He goes through the details in his mind, trying not to fall asleep as he grows more and more tired. John’s steady breath adds to Sherlock’s tiredness. John, who is lying next to him. Asleep. In a muscle shirt. John. His last thought before drifting off is that John never falls asleep so quickly, because he usually struggles with the anticipation of a nightmare.
“I work at a clinic near Hyde park. The job is good, yeah, very good. I mean it’s not like chasing criminals across London, but it pays the rent.”
When the train arrives in Dartmoor, John isn’t sure whether he did anything else. They rent a car in a shop near-by, which Sherlock has to drive due to John’s inability. He never needed a driving license in the army and never felt the urge to get it afterwards. Who needs a car in the cab-filled city anyway? John didn’t even know Sherlock could drive. He wonders whether his friend went to one of the posh driving schools of the suburbs that cost a fortune in his teens.
“He’s the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I’ve ever been fortunate enough to meet. He’s the best man I’ve ever known,” he concludes.
Sherlock has to chuckle. “That’s true. He was a bad cabbie. Should’ve seen the route he took us to get here!”
With a shaking hand, he reaches for the envelope addressed to him and sits down in his armchair. He reads the words, then reads them again, but it isn’t until the third time that their meaning fully unfolds. There’s a single tear rolling down his face, falling onto the page and leaving a stamp on the very last sentence. He feels like throwing up, like laughing, screaming and crying all at once. He’s been such an idiot. How could he ever have doubted Sherlock’s feelings for him? And why didn’t he realise his own sooner?
John noticed that he was still holding Sherlock’s hand and quickly let go. He cleared his throat and hoped that their daughter had not yet acquired her father’s skills of deduction.
“Ah, Anderson. Here we are again,” Mr. Holmes says. It’s obvious from his tone that he’s not particularly fond of the officer.
“That was me playing but I don’t blame you for not remembering, given the amount of alcohol you just consumed in the last half hour.”
Sherlock averts his gaze from John’s chest to the nurse. She’s giving him an encouraging smile, obviously trying her best to convince him. She’s not been in their room before, so she can’t know Sherlock’s previous responses to this suggestion. Her name tag says Nancy with a tiny elephant next to it, suggesting that the pediatric station is her usual working environment. She seems tired around her eyes, probably caused by being a single working mother of twins, but Sherlock can’t tell why she’s not involved with the other parent anymore. Even his deduction skills seem to have left him.
“’Night, Sherlock.” I want to do something to show him my gratitude and try to hug him, but stop myself at last because I remember that we don’t hug each other (except during teary best man speeches) and instead end up patting him weirdly on the shoulder. He seems amused but doesn’t say anything and leaves. For a moment, I watch him leave into the dark night, until I get too cold and close the door behind me, the warmth of the flat engulfing me like a blanket.
Sherlock, already on his way, throws the blanket into one of the police cars. Once he’s reached John, however, he doesn’t know what to say. His heart is beating a little faster, but he blames it on the shock.
This time it’s Sherlock who offers his hand. John hesitates half a second before taking it, unlike Sherlock did at Bart’s. He can once again feel the tingling in his fingers; the sensation of finally having found the place where his hands belong. Once he lets go, the feeling remains like an echo. He tries to study John’s features as best as he can – the smile on his lips, the blue eyes, the grey stubble and the creases on his forehead – and stores the image in his mind palace, before he turns around and leaves.
“Despite everything, Clara and I never got along great. I guess deep down I always saw her as a liability, which is awful I know, but if it hadn’t been for her, I would have left home earlier. Does that make me a horrible person?”
think about it, Mary’s words actually make some sort of sense. If he had left her to be alone, he would have waited a decent amount of time before he pursued anything with Sherlock. He would’ve felt a hundred times worse, knowing that Mary was heart-broken and alone and miserable. He wouldn’t have run off into Sherlock’s open arms. It would’ve killed him, but John’s not the type of person to jump from one partner to the next. Now, however, he knows that Mary’s not alone, and definitely not miserable either. At least this way, he can screw being nice and waiting a decent amount of time because his wife just diminished that time to zero.
“Yes, it did.” Sherlock said and very carefully took John’s left hand from across the table. “You see?”
At that, he gives me a quick look. It somehow makes me feel exposed, as if he can read me like an open book. “I know you’re an army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him. Possibly because he’s an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic, quite correctly I’m afraid. That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?”
“Er, if you want we can discuss this another time?” I ask while getting up from the sofa and depositing my empty boxes in the bin. I feel guilty. This is the first time Sherlock started to open up a bit, and now I’m leaving. I return to the living room to find him still sitting on the couch.
After dinner, they sit down on the sofa to watch some telly. John has been particularly enjoying torturing Sherlock with James Bond movies since he lost his memories. If Sherlock had known beforehand how many of these dull films existed he never would’ve agreed to a James Bond marathon. But John seems to enjoy it and that’s enough reason for Sherlock.
John breaks off and stares up at Sherlock. Somehow his hands have found their way around the lapels of Sherlock’s coat, causing him to be hauled close against his friend. Sherlock is still staring at him, with his eyes wide open and an expression on his face that John doesn’t recall ever seeing before.
“No, it’s fine, John. I’m sorry, I was just about to come pick you up,” Mike replies. He turns towards the stranger, not making amends to introduce him to Sherlock.
When Sherlock wakes up the next morning, the other side of the bed is empty. For a moment he can’t hide his disappointment, but he hears the shower running in the small bathroom. When John enters the bedroom, his silvery hair is still damp from the shower. He smiles down at Sherlock.
Sherlock returns shortly afterwards without his dressing gown. He buttons up his suit while directing me towards the stairs.
“Yes, sorry. Yes, Mike. Hello. Hi.” I shake his hand. He smiles at me. I don’t usually like meeting old acquaintances. They remind me of the life I used to have and never will have again.
Sherlock turns around slightly, causing John to see his long fingers flying over the violin, almost too fast for his eyes to see. His head is tilted in order to hold the instrument in place, his long arm moves up and down with the bow in hand. Sherlock’s eyes are closed, and the expression on his face is of pure relaxation. It’s different from his mind-palace face, less stressed but also more focused, and suddenly John thinks that Sherlock has never looked more beautiful. He wishes he could take a picture of this moment and frame it in his mind.
Sherlock exchanged a look with John, apparently trying to tell him something telepathically, but John couldn’t figure it out.
Dr Molder leaves to give John some privacy and Sherlock offers his hand to help John get up. John takes it and slowly moves towards the pile of clothes in the corner of the room. He looks at the clothes, then at Sherlock, then at the clothes again.
It’s only now that Sherlock realises that they have to finish a case. The sooner they get it done, the faster he can focus on more important things.
“You really shouldn’t worry too much, Mr. Watson, I’m sure it’ll all come back to him soon,” he adds.
So he does have feelings for the bloody woman. And he thought she felt the same, but four weeks ago he found out that she was gay. That’s why he’s heart-broken. I feel a strange mixture of sadness for him, anger for her, and a small pinch of something else for the confirmation. I resign from telling him that feelings are probably the only thing in the world you can’t calculate. Sherlock is still looking at me. For a moment, I allow myself to stare back into his green eyes and try to convey something with mine.
“Are you kidding me? I’m afraid all the time!” John takes a sip of his beer, as if bracing himself for a long monologue. Sherlock notices that his own breathing is slowly returning to normal speed.
Slowly they fell into their own rhythm and John found that he didn’t have to look at his feet in order to get the steps right. Sherlock was guiding him with his large hand on John’s back; and John remembered how Sherlock had once admitted to him that he had always loved dancing. There was a spark in his eyes that John rarely witnessed, something similar to when he played the violin.
They’re still leaning against the wall, both panting and giggling and enjoying each other’s company, when John’s phone buzzes. He fishes it out of his trousers, and quickly scans Mary’s text asking him when he’ll be home.
“That our client is Finn Saltire?” He must notice Sherlock’s look of confusion as he adds: “The famous baseball player?”
“Yeah, you’re probably right. But we just never really talk about these things, so it could be quite awkward,” I reply.
“Ah, you’re both here, that’s great. Sherlock, I’m glad you’re back,” he says, turning towards Sherlock and giving his shoulder a light squeeze. He shares a knowing look with John before continuing, “Your brother told me I’d find you here.”
“So why do we need to go to Sussex for a case? Is it really that promising?” John asks. Sherlock can’t keep himself from grinning. “Oh John, if you had any idea. There’s a boy gone missing from his preparatory school. He didn’t disappear alone, however, he seems to have taken his German teacher and the latter’s bicycle with him. There are no suspects, no traces – according to the police – and no apparent reason for anyone to kidnap the kid. It’s like Christmas in summer.”
Fifteen minutes later, the cab pulls over in front of a shabby sky scraper. Sherlock hurries out of the car so I roll my eyes and pay the cabbie. The man, Mr. Simon, lets us into the house and tells us that his apartment is on the thirteenth floor. He waits at the door and gives us a short nod and handshake.
“There are only two possible answers. It’s best if we split up. Lestrade, you go this way,” he says, pointing to the right side of the tunnel, “John and I will take the other way.”
“Sure. We wouldn’t have been able to do it all just now.” I look around and feel pleased with myself. The changing table is already placed in the left corner of the room, stuffed with a ton of diapering supplies, the smoke detector hangs on the sealing, the dresser is set up next to the changing table and the electric outlet covers are already applied. “But don’t worry, there’s still lots of work to do. We need to put up the crib and the bookshelf and we can arrange the bouncy seat and the baby monitor.”
Sherlock runs his hands through his hair, tucking at the curls in frustration. He hasn’t been having the best day when Mike Stamford enters the lab at six in the evening. He unsuccessfully tried to convince Lestrade that the series of suicides threatening the dull idyll of crime-free London is, instead, a series of cold-blooded, well-planned murders. However, Scotland Yard’s incompetence has once again succeeded Sherlock’s already low expectations, leaving him sulking in his lab with a couple of unimportant experiments to pass the time, waiting for the next strike of the killer.
John gives the doctor and Sherlock a long look. “Okay. Okay, maybe that’s for the best,” he finally says. “I should probably get changed then.” He looks around the room for his clothes, which Mrs. Hudson had brought with her the very first night she visited.
Sherlock has been following the mysterious man for the past twenty minutes. He has taken a zigzag route to what seems to be an abandoned warehouse, looking over his shoulder every now and then. Luckily, Sherlock manages to increase the distance between them without losing sight. If everything goes according to plan, the man he’s been following will turn out to be Sebastian Miller, the psychopathic serial killer he and John have been trying to find for the last four weeks. Given the suspicious outward appearance, combined with his earlobes and the way his shoes are tied, Sherlock is 99% certain.
“Oh, it was very nice. Although I didn’t get to see as much sunlight as one might expect,” Sherlock replies. The two of them have always been like this, using sarcasm to overplay awkwardness.
Reluctantly, I pull away. Sherlock immediately leans closer to kiss me again, but I take a tiny step back.
We walk the rest of the way in silence. The case is definitely one of the frustrating ones. I check my phone but Mary hasn’t texted me so far. Before reaching Baker Street, Sherlock suddenly turns to walk into the wrong direction.
I stroke his penis more quickly and move my fingers inside of him just a bit. I can feel his prostate, so I slide my finger against it and feel the body underneath me shiver.
He stood up swiftly and decided to search for them in the flat anyways, just to be sure. There was no need to panic, yet. He started in the bathroom, then Sherlock`s room. With adrenaline in his veins and a pounding head he sprinted up the stairs. John`s own room was empty. He kicked open Rosie’s bedroom door with his left elbow and felt relief wash over him.
“To 2011, of course. And to me finally getting rid of that ridiculous hat,” Sherlock says pointing over towards the greyish hat hanging on the hall-stand.
“Terrorists can get into all sorts of problems unless there’s an Off switch,” Sherlock explains. He looks up at John, and suddenly realises that they are
“See, you know –“ but John’s words are cut off by the lights suddenly turning on. Sherlock stares up at John, who’s looking down at the timer and lets out a groan, his face in shock.
Upstairs, Sherlock is playing the violin. He’s facing the window and is lost in the sound of his instrument. Sometimes I could lose myself in it, too. He’s playing something unrecognisable but incredibly beautiful. When he tilts his head back, his curls fall onto the nape of his neck, and I have to fight the urge to touch them.
“If you could see this now, you’d probably laugh at me. You’d tell me that the afterlife is a fantasy made up by people who can’t cope with the death of their loved ones, or something like that. And I’d laugh at your arrogance, but of course you’d be right… Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I’m moving on. Actually, I’ve got a date.”
After a couple of minutes, he takes her hand as she decides to walk over to me. Rosie doesn’t seem content, sometimes she prefers to walk without help. Sherlock lets go of her hand and searches my eyes. He’s still quite insecure when it comes to these things. I nod as if to say ‘It’s fine, she can walk on her own’ and in that exact moment, she stumbles and falls. I see the panic on Sherlock’s face and run towards them. Rosie immediately starts crying, probably more from shock than real pain. I hold my arms open but as I’m about to pick her up my daughter turns towards Sherlock and screams “Papa!”.
“I'm so sorry, Mr. Holmes. There must have been a misunderstanding. Dr. Huxtable only booked one room for you and I’m afraid that we’re booked up.”
There’s a quick smile on her lips before she closes the door. John picks up his phone from the desk to text Mary that he’ll be home soon. Due to her part-time employment, she had the day off. Maybe they can watch and old Western over dinner, if John manages to concentrate this time. He already feels tired at the prospect of his couch waiting for him.
“While I do agree that you occasionally are, I do not see how you’ve come to the conclusion that I – “
Sherlock and John had decided to imprint Rosie’s feet and hands onto the only white wall at 221B – the wall left to the living room door. At the moment, John’s hands were coloured green while Rosie was lying on the ground next to Sherlock, trying to decide which tube Sherlock should open next. For some reason, there was a spot of pink in her blonde hair and Sherlock had a mixture of blue and red all over his arms and fingers.
“Well, technically everyone does.” John clears his throat. “Most just fail to find each other.” Sherlock can tell that it bothers the married man more than he’d like to admit that he hasn’t found his, either.
“You should get some rest,” he says to John, whose eyes are already closing in an increased frequency.
When Sherlock arrives, some heads in the restaurant turn. That git is wearing a purple shirt and a tailored suit which he definitely wasn’t wearing before, John notices. He has to swallow when Sherlock approaches the table.
John took a deep breath and looked Sherlock straight into the eyes. “I love you, Sherlock, I always have. I loved you when we were flatmates all those years ago, when you were gone, even when I was married to someone else. I’m sorry it took me so long to say it. It’s as true today as it was back then. And if you’ll have me, I’m yours.”
“I don’t bloody care! I was terrified, Sherlock. I was scared to death!” John feels the frustration of the last weeks, or maybe even the last year, stirring up inside him, adding fuel to his anger.
On my way back, I think about the fight Sherlock and I just had. It wasn’t really a fight, only me being frustrated and screaming at him. Why does he think that I care about what people think? As far as I’m concerned, I don’t give a flying fuck if people mistake us for a couple. Well…
Sherlock is already halfway around the corner when John catches up. “Wait! I’ll just have to make a quick call... someone’s expecting me.”
“I have to tell you something that I‘ve wanted to for a long time. I was just so afraid and I didn’t want to lose what we already had by reaching for something more, something I thought I could never have.”
John slowly takes a deep breath; he can do this, he is a soldier after all. He dealt with things far worse than giant pets in Afghanistan and, frankly, in London, ever since meeting his madman. Cautiously, he walks towards the source of the sound, tightening his grip on the flashlight. He circulates a massive tree and finds himself amidst a couple of smaller bushes. From his current position, he can see a flash of lights going on and off in the distance. What the bloody hell is going on? Is this Morse code? John decides to retrieve his notebook and starts scribbling down the transcription just to be sure.
“Well, I thought we could go to the park again. Rosie really seemed to like the swing last time. Do you want to come?”
“Well, if you are so eager to find out I think you look a –” “Sherlock!” John interrupts him. “Look!”
“Thank you, John. That’s a good idea.” He looks up at John who seems genuinely pleased with himself.
Sherlock turns to look at me. He seems to actively study my features before saying “It must have been hard for you, considering how it was for me. I knew I’d probably see you again, yet those were the two most dreadful years of my life.”
John is sitting in the filled subway, stretching out his legs to ease the pain of a long day at work. He starts massaging his temples in an attempt to stop the growing headache, but he’ll probably have to take a pain killer once he gets home.
it says. How strange. I decide to look him up on the internet. It might not be the worst idea to be at least partly prepared. I wonder what he does for a living, because he doesn’t appear to be a chemist or a doctor. The text has to be for someone who has the power to arrest people. Is he a policeman? He didn’t really seem like that, either. My internet search leads me to a website called
Upon entering my flat, I immediately hear Rosie crying from the kitchen. Alana is standing next to the highchair trying to feed my daughter without success. She looks relieved when she sees me.
In the end, he doesn’t even have to think twice about the proposal. He’ll be able to spend time with John, get to know him better, maybe even get him to help on cases again. It’s more than he ever thought he’d have.
It had started about two months ago in June when Sherlock had received a telescope from one of their wealthier clients as a thank-you-for-saving-our-son’s-life gift. Although Sherlock had never been particularly interested in astronomy, John had convinced him to at least use the telescope once. They had been spending their Saturday evenings with piles of blankets and cushions on the rooftop ever since.
When Mary doesn’t respond, neither verbally nor non-verbally, John continues. “You deserve to be with someone who can give you his undivided attention, someone who devours you above anything else. And I’m afraid I’m not that person anymore. I’m so s–”
John shook his head. “Sherlock, you weren’t supposed to spend money on this. We could’ve taken plastic toy rings, for all I care.”
Sherlock noticed that John was still grinning and eyeing him afterwards. He was staring at him so intensely that it was starting to scare Sherlock a bit. The knowledge of finally being allowed to stare at John, without having to fear that he’d notice, still overwhelmed Sherlock sometimes.
“I just… what you said reminded me of something you… didn’t say.” He finally looks up from his tea and smiles. Something in his look tells me to let it drop.
At first, I don’t know how to respond. I haven’t been on a date in ages. If I’m being honest, I wasn’t really interested in dating when I lived with Sherlock, and then I was just too sad and depressed to even consider going out. It somehow feels like cheating, agreeing with her now. But would Sherlock really mind? He was never interested in such things, at least not with me, anyway. And it’s not like he’s coming back anytime soon. Life only moves forward, I learned that the hard way. I know I have to move on, and maybe this is the first step in the right direction.
Before I lay down to hopefully get some sleep, I think about my blog. Ella’s not gonna like the fact that it’s still empty. I didn’t really have anything to write about before, but now I do, so I go back to my desk and start writing. Before pressing publish, I hope with slight embarrassment that Sherlock Holmes doesn’t decide to do the same thing and look me up on the internet tonight, because then he’ll most likely find this blog. On the other hand, he already knows more about me than most people and probably doesn’t need the internet for that.
The months following his invalidity were the hardest of his life. He sought a purpose in the dull routine of his existence, failing to return back from the war with his body and soul alike. Only when he started working as a doctor again he felt useful, if only for the sake of his patients. He started thinking that his person would give him a purpose in life, and even signed up to one of the bloody websites. It was in that time when he wished to find his person for the first time in his life that he met Mary, instead. Upon first laying eyes on her, he wished to feel the sensation of their souls bounding when he shook her hand – but nothing happened. After a couple of weeks of consideration, he decided to take matters into his own hands. How likely was it that he ever found his person, anyway? Wasn’t he too old already? Did he really want to remain lonely for the rest of his life because of a childhood fairy-tale?
“That feeling is mutual,” he manages to get out after a while. Sherlock’s eyes are full of honesty, and all of a sudden John is sure that Sherlock
John could feel his stomach drop to the floor. He closed his eyes for a split second, hoping to hide his minor panic attack from his family, and took a shaky breath. When he opened them again he found Sherlock staring at him.
Sherlock nods but looks at John intensely, probably thinking about something more profound than whether he would’ve liked to stay for desert after all.
The expression on the other man’s face shifts to blatant anger. “Oh don’t pretend you worked that out, somebody told you that.”
I can’t help but stare at the motion he is doing with his hands. If he did something like that with his – no, don’t even think about that. I clear my throat. He really does go through a lot of trouble to access this phone. “Why is that so important to you, anyway? It’s just a bloody phone,” I blurt out.
“You haven’t written a word, have you?” she asks. No, I haven’t. She, on the other hand, has written quite a lot.
There was a long silence in which John felt his heart beat uncomfortably in his chest, and then he heard Sherlock’s deep voice. “And I’d probably kiss you back.”
“Because I love you, John. I have loved you since the day I saw you at the pool with explosives strapped to your body.”
Sherlock is, I notice with slight disgust, holding an eyeball with some large tweezers in his hand. He’s apparently trying to roast it as he is holding a lit blowtorch near to the optic nerve dangling behind the eyeball. He is wearing his camel coloured dressing gown which was always my favourite on him.
Walking up to the giant Victorian building, Sherlock feels confident. His leg is much better now, almost healed from the welcome-gift Miller gave him back in May. The warm July sun has made his Belstaff unnecessary a couple of weeks ago, but Sherlock wouldn’t want to miss the feeling of the fluttering fabric around his torso. John is right next to him, grinning like an idiot after the fight they’ve just had. Of course he didn’t understand the only fool-proof way of entering the dominatrix’ flat was with the right disguise. When Sherlock asked him to punch him in the face, he seemed pretty reluctant at first, but an initiation from Sherlock’s side made him eager to return the favour.
John can practically feel Sherlock furrowing his eyebrows. “You’re about to go on a date, you should at least wear a shirt.”
Up to his full length, Sherlock can see the giant metal tank in the middle of the room, connected to a water pipe. A couple of stairs are leading up to the roof of the tank, and the sides consist of glass, giving view of the rushing water inside.
“Do we have everything?” John asks, carrying a suitcase in one hand and his jacket in the other. He’s slightly sweating, Sherlock notices. He holds the front door open for John and his ridiculously large suitcase. “We will only be gone for two nights. That is, unless I solve the case today, then we can leave tomorrow morning,” he responds. He lifts a hand to call a cab and sighs. Even he finds it a bit too warm in the sun and considers taking off his coat.
He didn’t change much in the flat, only added a couple of his things to the bedroom. This way, it still seems as if Sherlock lives there. After the first couple of weeks, however, Sherlock’s scents started to dissolve, causing John to cross the boundaries of privacy and opening Sherlock’s wardrobe one desperate Sunday afternoon. At first, he only breathed in the distinct mixture of washing powder and Sherlock’s cologne before closing the doors abruptly, feeling ashamed of himself. Then, when the pain became too unbearable, he started to touch the silky dressing gowns inside, letting the soft fabric run through his hands like liquid. Now, he finds himself taking one of Sherlock’s closing items out of the wardrobe in order to smell them properly more frequently than he’d ever admit. But even the clothing scents decreased over time, and the only things left from Sherlock are his items themselves. John has been clinging onto them like a squirrel to its last nut; he already finished half of Sherlock’s science magazines, even though he regularly falls asleep whilst reading.
“I’m sorry, Dr. Watson, but my brother’s instructions were very clear. He doesn’t want either of us to contact him. I was informed, however, that he left you a
Sherlock tried looking at Rosie’s face and saw that she was about to fall asleep. “I’ll bring her to bed. Wait for me here, I’ll take the monitor.”
“Sherlock.” Still no answer. He seems frozen, the way he is staring motionlessly at me. “That’s getting a bit scary now,” I add after another couple of minutes.
“Because he could’ve helped you, or, in this case, die with you. But I know you, Mr. Holmes. You and I are quite alike. We’re both lonely wolves, wandering through the night. We don’t need dogs following us around, slobbering us with their words of praise. We’re better off alone.”
“Yeah sure, it’s not like you didn’t want to bring a suitcase at all, leaving me to the task of packing for the both of us,” John replies sarcastically. Sherlock ignores his comment, takes the suitcase from John and hovers it into the boot of the cab. He goes around the car and manoeuvres himself into the back seat. John is already in the seat next to him.
“That’s… I don’t know what to say. This is a family unicum! You should keep it, it should stay in your family.” I clear my throat. This is truly a thoughtful gift. And it is for Mary’s and my child. I’m not sure we deserve it. Bloody hell, I know we don’t.
“I don’t think there are any.” He looks up at John, his brilliant flatmate. His conductor of light, as he had once so embarrassingly declared aloud. How could Sherlock have missed something so obvious?
“I’ve always been able to keep myself distant… divorce myself from feelings.” Sherlock isn’t even sure what he’s talking about anymore. Is this still about fear? His hand continues to tremble.
“Rosie, aren’t you old enough to walk down the stairs now?” John asked before loading up their plates with toast and scrambled eggs.
I clear my throat before I continue. “I know it’s stupid to fall in love with someone who doesn’t feel things that way, but I couldn’t really do anything about it. It just happened. I hope you’re not mad at me. Okay. Well. Thanks for listening…”
“Yes, of course. I promised you I wouldn’t, but I couldn’t possibly turn down this case. I hope you understand.”
He leans down closer to the bomb and starts patting around the device, searching for it. When he finally feels the tiny stick attached to the side of the bomb with his fingers, he lets out a deep breath before clicking it.
The second he fell was the longest second of my life. I ran over to him immediately, but it was too late. I grabbed his wrist to feel for a pulse, but there wasn’t one. How could I have ever taken his pulse, his beating heart for granted? The moment I realised that he was… that he was gone, I fainted.
“And why did you return?” John tries to ignore the shaking in his voice. It must be the endorphin. His heart is beating so loud he’s sure Sherlock can hear it.
The look on Mary’s face will haunt him for the rest of his life. It’s a mixture of disappointment, sadness, shock, despair and, above all, hatred.
“Yeah, but I’ve made my peace with it. Honestly, once you move past the half-century mark nothing really scares you anymore,” Greg said chuckling.
John swallows, because all of a sudden his mouth is too dry and Sherlock’s mouth is too close yet not close enough, and then he crosses the remaining distance between them and crushes their lips together. After a short pause of hesitance, John finds himself pressed against the stone wall by Sherlock’s lean body, kissing him back intensely; and John’s mind goes blank. The kiss is passionate and urgent, and John craves for more. They part their mouths and deepen the kiss simultaneously, their lips and tongues moving against each other in perfect rhythm. All thoughts leave John’s mind except for the shattering clarity that this is where he truly belongs. It’s unlike anything he has ever experienced. The sensation of Sherlock’s mouth against his makes him feel as if all his life he saw the world in black and white, and only now realises the screaming colours. He never would’ve thought that a kiss could connect him to another person so completely, so irretrievably.
“I was afraid in Afghanistan; I was afraid when I saw you floating in a tank; I was afraid of getting married; I was afraid almost all of my childhood.” He stops abruptly. Sherlock isn’t sure whether John regrets what he just admitted, but there seems to be something more to it.
John opens his eyes, panting heavily, his mind still trying to process what just happened, but once he notices the expression on Sherlock’s face, his heart drops to the floor. Sherlock looks shocked; practically horrified.
John, unaware of Sherlock’s revelation and subsequent panic attack, wakes up. Sherlock quickly sits down in his armchair and steeples his hands underneath his chin, trying to appear deep in thought. He watches John putting aside the blanket with a confused look and stretching his arms.
“So, Mary Morstan…” I pause, waiting for him to finally get it and conclude my sentence. But Sherlock only brings out a short “Yes” and waits for me to continue.
“Yes, honey, that’s right. But that doesn’t change the fact that I’m your Daddy and Sherlock is your Papa.”
John and Sherlock raised their heads simultaneously, but whilst Sherlock nodded in agreement, John shook his head vehemently.
“I’ll get him,” Rosie said and ran off before John had the chance to stop her. When Rosie returned with Sherlock a minute later, John’s hands were already a little sweaty. He blamed it on the heat in the pavilion.
“When he died, I was devastated! It took me years to put me back together and then I just wanted a fresh start, so I didn’t tell you. I fell in love with you, but then… the day we got married a man picked up the bouquet for me, and it was Francis. I recognised him immediately. I was so confused and desperately needed to talk to him, so I got away after our reception and he explained everything to me. He wasn’t killed by the bomb all those years ago, but was taken hostage and only got away a few months ago. He searched me immediately but it turned out rather difficult because I had moved away. Jake, I love you, believe me I do, but Francis is the love of my life!” Hatty raises her voice at that, but she’s shaking visibly.
Sherlock rolls over to the side, now facing the wall. John doesn't have to realise how much he's enjoying this.
“I did. I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for,” he says while putting on his coat. “Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t a difficult leap.”
“It means I can tell that you’re going through a rough time, both of you. Did anything happen yesterday?”
John could have sworn to see Sherlock’s face brighten up, but he might be mistaken. It’s not like he was a huge help on today’s case, for that matter, but Sherlock seems to be looking forward to his company nonetheless.
Slowly, he ascends the stairs until the voices become more distinct. He can hear Sherlock asking for him.
A hand comes up behind his head that gently guides him down, closer to Sherlock’s face. “I felt it, too,” Sherlock says before kissing him.
The innkeeper, a tall man with a notorious lack of sleep called Reuben Hayes, welcomes them in Sussex and offers them a key. John takes it and just as Sherlock is about to ask for his own, Mr. Hayes wishes them a good night.
And for some reason John knows exactly what he wants. He stops in his movements, his erection starting to press uncomfortably against his jeans. John gives Sherlock’s length one last kiss before he moves back up, propping himself up on the side of the sofa in order to strip down his remaining clothes. Sherlock, apparently mesmerized by the newly presented data of John’s naked body, stares at John with a burning look in his eyes that pierces right into John’s soul. He presses John closer into the sofa and flips them around, until John finds himself on his back and Sherlock atop of him.
I decided yesterday to finally visit Mrs. Hudson today. She has been calling and leaving a ton of messages after I packed my bags and left Baker Street, but I couldn’t bring myself to respond. Gradually after time, the calls got less and less frequent until her last message at Christmas. I hardly remember what she said, because I deleted the message immediately afterwards. I might have been a bit drunk, too. I never really liked the holidays anyway.
She laughs and for a second Sherlock can see the tiredness behind her eyes. “Believe me, I’m not doing this for you.”
I exhale a breath I didn’t realise I was holding. I should probably feel jealous, but I don’t. If anyone apart from me has been like a father to Rosie, it’s Sherlock. He’s been with her on her birthday, when she was sick, on Christmas, when she couldn’t sleep at night and when she needed a companion to play with during the day. The truth is, Rosie probably won’t remember Mary. I try to keep her mother in her memory, but childhood amnesia makes it difficult. Sherlock, on the other hand, is going to be there for Rosie for the rest of her life.
“Yes, it’s fine. It’s absolutely fine.” Sherlock has already half left when he turns back around towards John hesitantly.
With that, he takes his still unpacked luggage into one hand and his coat into the other, and slams the door shut.
“Take-out seems reasonable. There’s a Chinese restaurant around the corner whose owner still owes me a favour.”
But even after he’d met John, he’d still been able to keep his feelings under control. He managed for so long to keep the affection he felt for his flatmate at bay. With every passing day, he’d gotten better at concealing his lingering looks, his amazed gazes, his longing expressions towards John. Or had he?
John silently tells himself that everything will be fine; surely he’ll stop thinking about Sherlock when he stops seeing him and eventually move past this bloody mess. There’s no reason why anything in his life should change. As he slowly drifts off to sleep, John wonders why he doesn’t fully believe himself.
In the afternoon after my shift at the clinic, I decide to visit his grave. I haven’t been here since New Year’s Day. It’s very cold outside, so I take my green coat that I hate because it always reminds me of the one Moriarty put me in all those years ago. The graveyard isn’t too far from my apartment. I don’t bring any flowers, as there are usually some there whenever I come by. I assume they are from Mrs. Hudson, or Molly, or maybe even Mycroft. I haven’t seen either of these people since I moved out of Baker Street. I actually tried to phone Mrs. Hudson a couple of times last year, but she wasn’t at home when I did. After a while it got easier to just not pick up the phone at all. And who knows what Mycroft is up to? He was devastated the last time I saw him. No matter how much Sherlock would fight me for it, I know that the two brothers loved each other.
They sat in silence for a while, watching the London sky stretching out below, when all of a sudden a shooting star shot across the sky in the distance. Sherlock and John sat up straighter while Rosie made a gasping sound.
I can’t help but think back to the first time he proposed it, two weeks ago. He behaved strangely on that tarmac, the way he chose the words made it seem like he was gonna say something completely different, something that would’ve made me freak out completely. Of course I found out later that he was as high as a kite, which probably explained his behaviour, but in the last few weeks I found myself wondering frequently what he had really meant to say, nonetheless.
They sat down – Rosie and Sherlock on the long side of the bench and John on the shorter one next to Sherlock – and ordered. When they received their drinks John was but a little surprised to feel Sherlock’s hand being placed mere centimetres from his own on the table.
“Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine,” he asks in a very deep voice, one you would recognise among thousands.
After a while he goes back into the living room to find John asleep. He’s lying on his side, his head draped underneath a small cushion. His lips are slightly parted and his left arm is hanging down, almost touching the floor. Sherlock decides to throw a blanket over him and gives his arm a light squeeze while doing so. Suddenly John shifts in his sleep until he’s more on his back, causing Sherlock to freeze in his movement.
“I hope she understood. It’s hard enough for her without Mary and with two fathers, instead. Do you think the other kids will make fun of her when they’re older?”
John slowly shakes his head. “No sorry, I can’t. I love you, Mary, I really do. But with him it’s – ”
When neither Rosie nor Sherlock came down the stairs giggling five minutes later, John started to worry. If Sherlock had planned to go out with Rosie tonight, he would have texted John. John quickly fished his phone out of his pocket but there was no text from Sherlock.
Upon approaching his grave, I see a couple of fresh white roses in front of it. I wonder who put them there this time. I don’t really talk to the grave, or him, not since the last time.
“Let me just get out so you can use the toilet first,” John adds. He slips past Sherlock and brushes him with his arm while passing through the door.
“John? John Watson?” I hear a voice directly behind me. I turn around. A man with glasses and brown hair walks towards me. His face seems familiar. Do I know him?
“I know this must be very hard for you, but Dr. Watson doesn’t remember you at the moment. He doesn’t seem to remember anything after his return from the war back in 2010, where he got injured as well. This is probably just a temporary case of retrograde amnesia, but a calming environment is crucial for your husband’s recovery.”
Mr. Saltire looks confused and caught. How boring. John, on the other hand, looks at Sherlock with amazement and possibly something else.
“What’s going on?” Sherlock asked. For the first time in a long while, his mind was blank. Why had Rosie lied to him about John’s whereabouts? Was this some kind of intervention the two of them had planned because of the toes in the freezer?
“We live there, it’s in central London,” he tells John. John nods again and clears his throat. He looks down at his fingers and clenches his hand into a fist. Something is obviously bothering him.
“Stop! Stop, we can’t giggle, it’s a crime scene. Stop it,” John says but the smile is still wide across his face.
It’s hours later that Sherlock notices the golden piece of jewelry lying on the coffee table, burning itself into the deepest part of Sherlock’s heart.
It’s been ten and a half years since John limped into a lab room at Bart’s, seven years since Sherlock’s return from the dead, five years since Mary died with her unborn child, three and a half years since Sherlock and John got together, almost two years since they got married, and three days since the worst day of Sherlock’s life. He had come close to feeling like dying before. The day he was shot by Mary, for example, or the day he overdosed and passed out in an alley, or the day he watched John getting married. But none of those days, none of the wounds he had endured during his time away, could ever compare to the feeling of watching the love of his life crash out of the windshield of a car and onto the bonnet. His heart had definitely stopped beating for a second and sunk down into the pit of his stomach. All he remembers is frantically opening the driver’s door of the parked car and pulling John’s body down onto the asphalt. He doesn’t remember checking his husband’s breathing, calling an ambulance or the panic-filled ride to the hospital. All he remembers is pain.
Sherlock shot him a glance and John tried to shrug his shoulders apologetically without Rosie noticing, before crawling over towards them.
Mary’s mouth has dropped open. I shrug my shoulders. “It’s what the girl at the baby market recommended.”
After the third turn John knew where they were headed, but he decided to remain silent for Rosie’s sake.
Rosie slowly crawled off John’s lap and moved closer to Sherlock, who put his arm around her shoulder. John watched, still wondering after all those years how he could be so lucky. He leaned closer to Rosie and pressed a kiss onto her forehead, his cheek almost brushing Sherlock’s arm.
When Rosie had started to speak, Sherlock had already been a father to her for longer than Mary had been in her life. It hadn’t been much of a surprise that John’s daughter had refused to call Sherlock by his name and had given him the endearment she must have picked up somewhere, instead.
“Breathe through your mouth.” I open the door and fetch the nasal spray from the living room. I’m exhausted. I didn’t get much sleep lately. It’s almost as bad as when I was living with Sherlock.
“Urgh,” Sherlock groans. “You can be such an idiot sometimes. If I didn’t love you, I might as well kill you right now!”
John’s stare turns into a grin and his face reddens a bit. “I know, I know, but... sorry, I’m being irrational.” And then he does the most wonderful thing, he starts to giggle.
“The size is most certainly not the only distinguishing feature,” Sherlock tells the angry-looking man behind the counter.
On the roof of the building, they are rewarded with an astonishing view. The air is crispy cold so John tucks his hands into his coat pockets. He feels Sherlock’s presence right behind him.
Rosie sat laying upside down on her bed with her head off the end and her arms raised in a crossed position above her eyes. Overall a pose she probably shouldn't hold for very long. Her sobs had settled a bit but, she continued to sniffle. Gina had seen the crap telly shows her uncles sometimes watched, Rosie had all the symptoms of a broken heart. Crying, comfort food as evidenced by the jaffa cakes on her side table, isolation, and even anger if the argument she heard when her Dad dropped off her and Max. Da had always said that a broken heart was the most world ending thing that could happen to a person. Da was composed of 78% logic, 20% weird government loop holes, and 2% noir film buff, so he must be correct on this.
Rosie could have argued, could have lectured or debated but, there’s no debating stupidity. So instead she stood up and threw her cards on the table.
“Perhaps, I just like proving you wrong.” Mycroft was quiet, and no longer leaning back with ease and comfort. He was looking towards the entrance, bow furrowed.
“Ah, I see. My apologies Rosie.”  He smiled gently at her and then stood, picking her up and leaving the office for the kitchen.
“You’re sure,” Mycroft spoke barely loud enough to be heard, “it’s.” He stops, unable to find the right words for once, and looks at his husband. Greg too, wants to ask the question that leaves a bitter and decaying taste in his mouth.
“Sherlock! Other children are perfectly normal, don’t go about insulting them.” She turned to Mycroft, her words a little harsher than when she scolded his brother. “Mycie, honestly you should know better than to place such hateful thoughts in your brothers head,” she lowered her voice so that only he could hear and kept her tone sharp, “He has enough going on up there without further damage.”
The two men jumped in surprise and turned in the direction of the commotion. Sherlock couldn’t see Mycroft’s face but, he knew he was frowning. Just then Sherlock received texts from both of the men.
Lestrade now gives a full bark of a laugh. “Well you’re half right, with you giving Sherlock special permissions in Eurus care, the two of you are her only access points into Sherrinford.” He leans jovially against Mycroft. “Except, Sherlock has banned her from bothering you about it with the threat of not seeing Rosie for a year if she does.”
Mycroft sighed, but his face did not change from the bored and vaguely annoyed expression he kept the these days. “Well it was the correct conclusion to come to given the, as Sherlock put it, data we had. And my name is Mycroft, mummy. I am no longer a small child to be coddled, fed biscuits, and patted on the head like some dog that has done a trick.”
Mycroft gives a long with, cracking an eye just to give the inspector a look of loathing. “She’ll have to come to me then, which means I better sober up and find the quickest way for her to see Eurus.”
“Everyone keeps telling me you’re the bad guy.” Five year old Rosamund Mary Watson made her proclamation unprompted, while drawing unicorns on the scrap paper Mycroft had given her. She was lying on her stomach in the middle of her newly minted Uncle’s home office. The particular unicorn she was drawing had a bright blue mane and purple hooves and horn. She was blissfully unaware of the hurt expression on her Uncle’s face.
Rosie bent backwards dramatically falling over John’s arm. “Nooo” she moaned, dropping the ginger nuts in her display of displeasure.
“It was sloppy, Mrs. Tarly at m old school, had done a better one, and it was blue and purple.” Stasha had sneered a bit at their art teachers name. “Daddy says we can play in the garden or we can play cards at the table.”
“I agree. And only what I’ve been able to deduce since waking up from our nap. My silence alone should be reason enough to hear her out.” Sherlock and John both turned their attention back to Rosie.
“How can my dads think you’re the bad guy, you’re sweet.” She looked at him, a watery smile on her face, but her eyes were sincere.
Mycroft had been drinking more since Sherrinford, he tried to make excuses for himself but sitting here now, he could no longer lie to himself. Mycroft was sat on a bench under a railway arch, positively reeking of alcohol, somewhere in Vauxhall. He’s not entirely sure how he came to be here either. He remembers another argument with Mummy, first on the phone, then continued six hours later when she had randomly popped in to visit Sherlock. Really he doesn’t remember anything after leaving 221B with Mummy berating him in his retreat.
This was how Mycroft found her five minutes later. Being a proper adult, he settled the twins, calmed his niece, and righted the playroom. Later that evening he spoke to his husband, brother and brother-in-law, and commended Rosie on not burning the house down or murdering anyone. After seeing photos of the carnage of the playroom they all agreed it was an amenable first attempt at babysitting.
Greg laughed. “Well, now that prying eyes are gone, would you like to accompany me to dinner upon our return to London?”
Sherlock laughed. “It’s just until the weather breaks, love.” He lays on his back, feet still folded in ‘criss cross applesauce’ as Watson would say. “Hmmm, I did say treasure. Though Mummy seems to have cleaned out my hidden compartment ages ago.”
“Yeah, so let’s get you home so I can call your brother and end his constant worry about where you’ve gotten to.” The men stand, one possibly leaning on the other, and begin their walk away from the bench in Vauxhall. Mycroft can only think in astonishment in how the tables of brotherly obligations have turned.
“Oh” Rosie explained, “Speaking of black and yellow, did you see Mrs. Suresh’s optical illusion painting on the back wall today? It was memorising!”
“Which is exactly why the fight happened. Not with her, for her” she rushed to explain. “She’s younger than the rest of us, she skipped a couple years. And there’s this other girl, she’s not so nice. No one really likes her, except for her cronies. Well, I was walking across the courtyard after my free period and...this other girl had Annaliese, the smart one, pinned in a corner.”
She doesn’t hold the same hope for Mycroft, he’s too far ensconced in her brother Rudolph’s shadow. He used to be such a caring, if a bit awkward, lad. Now he calls his brother an idiot, slow, and warns him away from basic human emotions. A year ago he would welcome hugs and would wear soft comfortable jumpers. Now though, he’s practically his uncle’s miniature.  He wears suits, though not yet a three piece like her brother. If she were being honest with herself, though she can’t as it’s a thought too much to bear, she had lost all three of her children in that fire. She is torn from her thoughts by the sound of the front door bursting open and Sherlock shouting a proclamation.
“Sherlock said last week that you thought I was snobbish and cold.” Mycroft spoke distractedly eyes focused on the entrance, where now a woman with long blonde hair was being blocked from entering.
Mycroft stayed as he was, simply choosing to look up at the man through his eyelashes. “Yes, what else would you call an invite to my parents’ house for Easter? Not only did I invite you, but Sherlock’s invitation to Dr. Watson and young Rosamund means that we’re squashed into my full size bed. Did you really think I would forget the Watsons?”
Rosie sat up, and turned to face the desk behind her. Her brow was furrowed, troubled. “But only, I don’t see how you can be.” She looked him straight in the eye. “Daddy and papa were really worried before the wedding yesterday, because Aunt Molly had a convention, and Nan Hudson was going to be visiting her sister. Which meant you had to watch me. And I don’t understand,  because you love us.” She looked at Mycroft with pleading eyes, seeking confirmation.
John took a breath but it was obvious he still was cross. “We weren’t contacted Sherlock. I don’t care that we’ve been on a case we should have been told. And what do you know about the situation?”
Mycroft smiled, taking mugs and other supplies from their various places. “Now as for why your fathers believe me to be the bad guy,” he paused turning to face her while the milk heated, “Your Papa and I share a long history, one where I often left him out of the loop and took my position as oldest very seriously.” Rosie nodded, listening intently. “I wasn’t,  and still am not, very straightforward or honest in my micromanaging of his life, though I’ve lessened my habits the past few years.”
She was left there stunned, not at the coldness of her eldest but, her middle child’s eyes. They held a light again however,  it wasn’t the spark of joy she hoped for. It was an empty baleful fog covered light of intelligence and annoyance. The same Mycroft now carried, the same she saw in her daughter’s eyes after they escaped the fire. Truly, her children were lost to her.
“I think it was the radiator pipe. The one poking out of the wall below the window.” Sherlock made this announcement as he continued to prod the affected eye.
John looked to Sherlock, silently asking if he knew what was wrong. Sherlock chewed his bottom lip and then sighed.
Rosie sat her chopsticks down and took a deep breath. “I got in a fight at school. They suspended me.” She kept her eyes on the table, and tried to make herself as small as she could.
Regina Scarlet Ashe Lestrade-Holmes had never seen her cousin Rosie cry like this before. I mean she'd seen her in some pretty bad states, like the time she and her brother were 5 and Rosie watched them for the first time. There was also the turkey incident, but nobody brought that up. This however, was a different beast entirely. The always sunny, steadfast, intrepid cousin she knew was not currently present.
He cries, first a few sniffles, then a few tears, until eventually the dam cannot be held back. The knees of his trousers become wet with the abundance of tears and snot. His chest, eyes, and abdomen become sore with the strength of his grief, decades of forced upon responsibilities and secrets. A life of self inflicted loneliness, all in the name of protecting his family, pours out of his soul. He doesn’t wail per se,  but he does scream. He screams as loud as he can for as long as he can. He screams until his throat is raw and his eyes produce no more tears. He hurts, physically, but the torment he allowed to himself to release has stopped the onslaught of emotional pain. He takes a few steading breaths and centres himself and his resolve to escape.
“I think Papa gave him puppy eyes. Plus he said you’ve been trying. Daddy just grumbles about that.” She too sipped her cocoa, receiving a cream moustache for her efforts. “But you do care, I mean who would have pushed adoption papers through on short notice, and record amendments that let me have Papa and Daddy’s last name, but only Daddy’s for school? Everyone hates paperwork but you did extra, so I could be happy, that’s love.”
“Sounds like someone’s been watching their films again,” Molly teases. Mycroft raises an eyebrow in mock reprimand, drops it, and then laughs. He laughs freely, joyfully, and with love in his heart, his tablemates join him.
“Yes well, status update.” He tried to sound as fierce as he could. The time for mourning was over, he had to be the Ice Man once more.
“Well that was fun,” Sherlock said with mirth, “But a nice long hot shower is over due.” John sobered immediately.
I realise I could have gone deeper in the defense of those the character Stasha was attacking. But I was getting super angry just typing out Stasha’s words and wanted to leave the fic unfinished. I may even delete this one and try and find a different inspiration for the prompt.  However, when I first saw the prompt this was the first thing that came to mind, given the current social climate.
“Yes,” Greg groaned, “But I don’t see why we have to be doing the heavy lifting. Doesn’t this count as legwork?”
“Can’t help but feel you’re winning on both ends of that, Love.” He craned his neck a bit to go in for  kiss. Only for Mycroft to yank back and smirk down at him.
“Yeah. The janitor walked around a corner to see me wailing on the other girl. Annaliese had run off the second she was free. She did try to tell the headmistress later that I hadn’t started it but, she wouldn’t listen.”
“Of course not!” Sherlock’s face was full of concern, as he sat straight up, nearly bumping his head. “Whatever would give you that idea? And you’re not bad at Maths, you hate Maths, there’s a difference.”
“Sherlock we’re home,” John shouted up the steps “Rosie decided you absolute must have gingers nuts, so please thank her for them” he said making his way into the kitchen.
“That’s literally your job” Greg deadpanned. “Besides, I’m sure Her Majesty would be highly disappointed in you for not going along with the government’s new interdepartmental social niceties initiative.”
“John I’m sure she has a perfectly good reason. Please, give her a chance, and don’t yell.” Sherlock cut in, keeping his voice even.
“I assure you Detective Inspector, that despite your aversion to my basement, there are no monsters in it.”
“You did the right thing, and we’re proud of you,” John began, “however, you lied to us and attempted to keep us out of the loop. For that your papa and I need to discuss your punishment. You’re upset, so why don’t you take your food to your room while your papa and I discuss what we’ll do.”
The Holmes-Watson household sat gathered around their kitchen island enjoying a family meal, for once. Sherlock and John had just solved a case around lunch that day. Which meant they both returned to Baker Street dirty, exhausted, and simply collapsed in their bed. Which is how their thirteen year old daughter found them upon her return from school. Normally the sight of her dads collapsed after a successful case brought her joy and excitement, for it meant slow and relaxing times with them. This particular time though, made her stomach twist in anxiety. Dads focused on a case meant dads not paying attention to her worries, dads on a solve high meant hyper fixation on her every mood. The traditional takeaway celebration dinner would mean trouble. So here they sat, two on a solve high, one playing with her food.
Sherlock turned around to face him, letting the absolute exhaustion show through his entire body. “I can’t do this anymore John. The Work is everything, at least it’s supposed to be. But then Watson, Rosie, got hurt and everything stopped. I don’t think I’ve been fully aware of anything in weeks. But she can’t get hurt if I work down here, she can’t be assaulted painfully and suddenly if the Work is locked away down here. 221B is home. Mine, yours, and hers. The Work can live down here.”
“What data my dear? And of course you’re not stupid, neither are you an idiot.” She says the last bit giving a reproving look at her elder son.
Sherlock and John stood covered in mud and other various river gunk, in front of a ranting Greg Lestrade. It was raining, they were soaked and cold, and shivering. The D.I. however, was not content to let them go frolicking home to a warm shower without a proper talking to.
Greg and Mycroft sat across from a very nervous looking Molly Hooper, at a corner table of her local pub. It was just past 7 p.m. and the place was packed with football fans and regular visitors of the establishment. In other words it was loud, an no one was giving their little table any mind.
He’d been in her cell for hours. He’d tried everything he could to get out but, as he’d designed it to keep Eurus in, it wasn’t a fruitful endeavour. Now he simply sat against the wall farthest from the blood stain left from the governor’s attempt to save his wife, knees tucked up close to his chest, face resting on said knees. Eurus was gone, Sherlock and Dr. Watson were gone, and he was left trapped unknowing of their fates, unable to help.
Sherlock reached up to touch the eye John was focusing on. It was tender but not painful. Funny, he didn’t remember being struck in any way. He marched into the bathroom without explaining.
He had been very very cross. He was very loud about it too. Until he wasn’t. He stopped all at once, and just stared at Sherlock, forehead crinkled in concern.
“Well, they don’t tell me,” she drug out the ‘e’, “Daddy just says things to Papa when they think I can’t hear them.”
Mycroft frowned deeply. “Rosamund, desist immediately. Your godfather has correctly determined the raw poultry bird to be unsafe for playing.” Rosie was undeterred and kept at her shenanigans.
“If you think for one second that I’ll trust some common movers with heirlooms you’re more of an idiot than previously determined.” He stood up to leave, but bent over the desk stopping his face mere inches from Greg’s. “Besides the deal was, you help shift everything down a room and I’ll order the larger tub for the master bath.” Mycroft wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
“Honestly Gregory you make it sound like some sort of clandestine shadow deal, instead of a friend offering surrogacy for two dear friends.” Mycroft sniffs, but the occupants of the table see that it’s all jest and no heat.
Rosie Watson-Holmes has always had a soft spot for the school pariahs, especially after all of the stories she’s heard about Papa and Uncle Mycroft’s childhood. Children could be unkind, and this nine year-old was determined not to be. However, Rosie’s patience was being tested by one year four classmate. Said classmate was a new student whose parents had moved to London three months ago, her name was Stasha. Stasha, as all new kids are, was approached by most of the class her first few weeks at school. Yet somehow had managed not to make a single friend, worse, she ate lunch alone. After a month of eating alone, Rosie decided enough was enough and that she would befriend the girl.
“You jumped off the fucking bridge, the bridge for the love of god. Tower Bridge! Are you insane? No don’t answer, of course you are!” Greg paced in front of them, hand gesticulating wildly. “It’s not enough that you didn’t wait for back up, no you had to tackle the man and jump off a bridge! Not only am I going to be buried in paperwork for the next eternity but I just know your dear brother is going to kidnap me the second I leave the office. Just to inquire why I didn’t stop you! Well I’ll have words for him!” He stopped suddenly, and looked them both over carefully, eyes darting about their faces, legs, and torsos. He sighed. “You’re sure you’re both ok?”
“So,” Lestrade begins as he takes a seat next to the government official, “You can behave like an adult and come with me, or you can be dragged to the car and into the station.”
Mycroft takes her hands in his, and she stills, subdued at his expression. “Her name is Eurus, she’s mine and your Papa’s younger sister. She is ill, very ill.” Rosamund’s eyes widen in concern. “She’s not dying I’ll sweetheart, her illness is of the mental kind, it makes her dangerous. Very few people are allowed to see her, your Papa is one of them, and he visits every fortnight. She cannot speak anymore but, she does play the violin.”
“I...yes. But she is not well, and I do not know how to explain it to you properly. However, I think you can understand this. If your Daddy, Papa, and I agree on something, then you can be sure all avenues of thought, practicality, and sentiment, have been explored. Currently, the three of us agree, you should not be in contact with Eurus Holmes.”
“Perhaps you’re right, but there is still a lot of ground to be made before I ever have your Daddy’s trust. But I do believe we  have that time.” They smiled at each other and sipped their drinks, content in each other’s company.
Rosie looked down into her lap, contemplating her uncle’s words. “Daddy says Papa has a sister, but that I’m not allowed to see her. Daddy has a sister too, but we see her sometimes. Why can’t I see Papa’s sister,” she questions, “she’s your sister too! That means we can go and see her while Daddy and Papa are on holiday!” She was excited now, a full on grin graced her face, and she was positively bouncing in her seat.
“The man is observant after all,” Mycroft said in mock surprise. He leaned a bit closer and whispered, “But let’s be clear, your offer is actually our second date.”
“What do you say Watson, want to be the King to be my Queen” he asked while scooping her up and grinning at John.
Sherlock, dressed in full drag, stood perplexed at John’s outburst. “Honestly John how do you expect me to track the money fraudster if I don’t follow him through his Drag Race circuit? And the skirt is supposed to be this short.”
Rosie nodded, relieved she wasn’t in worse trouble. She picked up her plate and an extra container of chicken. Once she was out of sight, and earshot, Sherlock turned to his husband.
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Sherlock knows we intend on converting two of the basement rooms into a play area for Rosamund, he wouldn’t dare interfere.” Mycroft leaned on the desk, resting his chin in one hand. “Besides Gregory,” he stretched out his partner’s name, “Isn’t home decor meant to be a relationship builder?”
Rosie immediately stilled her movements when she felt Mycroft’s mouth begin to cover her arm. Mycroft bit down, only enough to rest his teeth on her flesh, without any pressure or leaving any indents behind. Rosie opened her mouth in a gasp and looked Mycroft in the eyes. Then Mycroft made a deep chest growl, trying to sound ferocious. Rosie shrieked in joy and began giggling, she found the situation hilarious. Mycroft removed his mouth from her limb, and the took his pocket square out to wipe the bit of saliva from her. He then leaned across the table to pump a bit of hand sanitizer into his palm. He first rubbed it into his hands, and then the access onto Rosie’s arm.
Mycroft’s attention was once more focused on Greg, his moment of discomfort gone. “Sherlock was banned from this pub when he was 12.” Mycroft gave a slow sly smirk.
Sherlock doesn’t remember leaving the hospital, or calling Molly to retrieve his experiments. He just knows that somewhere between John shouting at him and the nurses escorting him out that he made a decision to change. Truly change. Three weeks later Mycroft found him in 221C, with three walls gutted and the floor ripped up, laying on his back on said floor panting. His hands were sore, apparently he ripped at least some of the floor up by hand. He explained what he wanted, and Mycroft called professionals for the remodel. John had been staying primarily with his daughter, only leaving to shower at Lestrade’s, as it was closer. After Mycroft made his calls John had come storming down in 221C and demanded why he hadn’t been to see his goddaughter.
“Why yous face is coloured?  Markers is for paper only.” Her face was crinkled in concern but her eyes were inquisitive and bright.
Things started out fine. Stasha was actually short for Nastasha, and she enjoyed hiking, playing with and investigating insects, and loved Star Wars. Rosie couldn’t understand why she hadn’t made friends sooner. Then about a week after Rosie had first sat down to eat with her, Stasha started talking about how horrible London was. It turned out she moved from a small rural seaside village in southern England. It was fine at first, a few complaints about smog, and the commute to school. Then it was how she didn’t like her neighbours, Rosie thought perhaps they were mean, but Stasha never gave specifics. Then it was how much she hated the art teacher Mrs. Suresh, but Rosie always found her to be patient and funny. Rosie was a bubbly naive child, whose rose tinted glasses were about to be shattered.
“Redbeard could do the best tricks.” His eyes began to water and his bottom lip trembled a bit. He stopped abruptly, shaking his head, and then looked directly into her eyes.
There in the distance, through the easing rain, Sherlock could make out the figure of his brother and Greg Lestrade. Mycroft was standing under his ever present umbrella while Greg was down on one knee presenting a ring box. Sherlock could see Mycroft nod yes, enthusiastically. Greg then stood and kissed Mycroft passionately. The two seemed in perfect bliss, the now misty rain creating a lovely fog in the forest. Sherlock found it deplorable and shouted. “I’m telling Mummy!”
“Rosie love, remember Uncle Sherlock can’t have the ginger nuts unless he uses his manners. Don’t let him- Sherlock! What on Earth are you wearing...and it’s too short!” John shouted in alarm.
“You sure do have a lot of off colours in your neighbourhood. Is it because of the sandwich shop? Ours only has the Ghanbari’s next door and the Attar’s at the corner.” She spoke nonchalantly but Rosie was flabbergasted, Stasha couldn’t mean what she thinks she meant, could she?
Mycroft covers his eyes with the heel of his hands and leans back. “Inspector" is all he offers in slightly slurred speech. Gregory Lestrade had been dropping in to his office nearly every day since the incident. Mycroft knows his brother had asked the inspector to keep an eye on him but, after another verbal lashing from his mother, he was in no mood for the arrival of his assigned babysitter.
Normally Mycroft would be stoic, use his desk as shield, and be waspish with his replies. He could not do that now, not just because his charge was five, but because she was correct and she needed to know she was. Mycroft stood, and walked over to the girl. He didn’t feel looming for such an important conversation would be appropriate, so he joined her on the floor, legs crossed, back bent so he could be as level with her as he could. “You’re right, I do love you, all of you. And your fathers, at least your papa, know this deep down,” he paused, “But, there is a lot of history between us. There are some things they cannot forget, or forgive, no matter my intentions.”
“School is boring and the other children are dull,” he said firmly, “I’m going to father’s study to read his anatomy books.” He ran up the stairs and out of sight.
“Looks like we’re going to be stuck here for a while,” Sherlock said as he stared out morosely into the torrential downpour, “luckily I’ve  brought snacks and your Daddy made sure you were bundled up before our adventure.” Sherlock grinned down at his adopted daughter, his head was just lightly brushing the ceiling of the structure.
Mycroft placed a mug of hot chocolate, topped with cinnamon and whipped cream, in front of her before sitting down. “Yes well, your fathers don’t see it that way,  nor do I expect them to.  And as for your daddy, we’ve never gotten on. Our relationship only became worse. To be honest I’m very surprised he’s allowed me any role in your life.” He sipped his drink.
Sherlock made no reply but could hear Rosie asking to be put down, and then making her way to the living room, obviously looking for him. Rosie, not seeing him, toddled towards his bedroom door which was slightly ajar. Sherlock ignored her and continued to focus on his face, satisfied with his eyebrows he had moved on to his cheeks. Rosie had pushed herself into his room.
“There’s nothing in this world that could possibly make your Gran love you less, or for her to feel you’ve let her down.” Sherlock leaned over and kissed her cheek. “Besides Mycroft is the family disappointment.”
Sherlock was sitting at his work bench in 221C Baker Street. The basement flat had been converted into Sherlock’s permanent lab years ago. Originally Sherlock had though his makeshift workspace in 221B’s kitchen had been sufficient enough, safe enough. He promised John it would be. Then the most terrifying thing to happen in Sherlock’s life occurred.  Rosie, Watson, his second conductor of light had pulled herself up the side of the island and come into contact with poison sumac. She was two, and apparently highly allergic. He hadn’t expected it, hadn’t even seen her ghosting her little hands around the edges, only to come in contact with a pile of leaves from his latest crime scene. It was only when Watson started crying, and her cries became wheezy and wet, that he looked over the island to see her sitting on the floor in pain.
“How do you know it was Gran?” Rosie was sipping on an apple juice box, staring out the window of the tree house.
Sherlock scooped them up and opened them. “Ta, love” he said as he tossed one in air and caught it with his mouth. John chuckled and walked away with the still dramatically displeased toddler.
She leaves the kitchen and heads into the hallway to great her sons. Sherlock is yanking off his wellies and raincoat, letting them fall to the floor and deposit a puddle of water. Mycroft places his Tesco umbrella in the stand and removes his overcoat to reveal his school uniform, which is pristine despite an entire day at school, not a wrinkle or stain in sight.
Rosie had tears in her eyes, and was once more looking into her lap. “OK.” Her voice was strained and small. She sniffled. “I still don’t understand something though.”
“Oh.” Mycroft desperately wanted to know what they were saying, especially since they wait until their daughter was out of sight. However, he didn’t want to use Rosamund, she trusted him, really trusted him. Mycroft wasn’t going to betray that trust, this little girl was thus far his only family member that seemed to see him as he was, human. Not the best thought but, it was the truth. No matter his intellect, or how vocal he was about the dangers of sentiment, he would always be human.
“The foreigners. Daddy says they should all be gone by now. The vote was pretty clear, we’re taking our country back, finally having the gonads to stuff it to the EU. They’ve been robbing us for years and we won’t stand for it any longer.” By now neither child was paying attention to their cards, but instead looking at each other dead in the eyes.
Sherlock froze, turned his face towards Greg’s exclamation, and looked absolutely offended. His moment of pause was enough for the manager to toss him out.
“Well mate, you’re coming home with me whether you like it or not.” Lestrade’s words are firm but, they hold no malice. “See I’ve been an emotional drunkard idiot myself and I get it. The thing is though that it doesn’t help one wit and if you hadn’t gone and ran off you’d see that you’ve got Sherlock backing you up.”
Greg ran a hand down his face in exasperation. “OK,  first things first. We agreed that if my office door and blinds are closed you’ll call me by my name,” he flicked his hands in an impatient gesture at the door, “and secondly, Love I am not afraid of basement monsters. I’m afraid your brother has set weird traps and gags in among the heirlooms. He showed me a video of your ancestral paintings by the way.”
Mycroft smiled and nodded in agreement. “Yes, they duet together. But Rosamund, you will find no sympathy from your fathers, Aunt Molly, Nan Hudson, or even me, when it comes to visiting Eurus. Perhaps when you are older, an adult really, talks can be entered into allowing some sort of contact, though I make no promises or even encouragement about it.” He spoke softly, but his voice was firm.
“We’ve had three joint Balls, gatherings, and even a damn company picnic together since we moved into the Curtis and not once have you actually been in attendance.” Greg was speaking in an admonishing tone to the younger man beside him but, his eyes were full of mirth. “Yet here we are now, in the most decrepit old pub the North could muster up, sipping a cider.”
It should have gone well but, fifteen minutes in she had needed to change her pad. Rosie walked two doors down, used the bathroom and returned to chaos. She was gone three minutes. The playroom was suddenly covered in her things as the twins had gotten into her overnight bag. The one she retrieved the new pad from, and flung the contents about the room. Well being an awkward, frustrated, and tired teenager that she was, she screamed. This some how convinced the twins that it was play time. It was not. Now Rosie was at the end of her rope, the playroom was a mess, and her Uncle would be home any minute. She was done. She didn’t yell, she didn’t stomp away and lock them in the playroom and wait for her uncle. Instead she sat down on the floor as the twins sang their songs, and she sobbed.
Before she could reply to that rather rude and out of line remark Sherlock spoke softly in almost a whisper.
Gina left the safety of the in-between that was her cousin's doorway and stepped fully into the room. "I'll kick his ass if you want me to." Rosie's sniffles stopped, and she let out a short wet laugh and rolled over facing her cousin.
He was somehow completely at ease in the dingy pub. It might have something to do with being the closest pub to his parents’ cottage, but Greg doubted that. Whatever his reasons Greg was certainly enjoying the view. Mycroft had always been attractive, but a less stiff Mycroft was a gorgeous one.
“How long have you been standing there?” His voice is raw, and it seems he can barely speak above a whisper, but Lestrade hears him all the same. The D.I. takes this inquiry as permission to enter.
“Rosamund, quit it, or I’ll bite.” Mycroft said sternly, then turned and flashed his teeth at the child. She paused briefly, concerned.
Mycroft has yet to remove his hands from his eyes and is beginning to see random spot in his inky black vision. “Wouldn’t our departure interfere with your shift, Inspector?” Mycroft is sneering but his state takes some of the bite out of his words.
“Not long.” He offers a small kind smile. Mycroft takes this to mean that he’d been there for most of it.
Sherlock stood in his bedroom facing the mirror inside his wardrobe. He pivoted, turned, and adjusted his stance multiple times, observing how his body looked in his chosen undercover outfit. He froze with his lips pursed, chin raised and neck extended, eyes squinted and focused on his right eyebrow. He heard the door to the flat open.
“I didn’t really deduce the fight. Mycroft called while Anthea escorted Rosie to the bathroom that first day. I know I should have informed you, but Mycroft said Rosie was absolutely distraught, she’s never been in trouble before.”
Mycroft leaned across the table they shared, situated in a dark corner. “Well,” he paused smirking, “I’m not one for forced Bureaucratic social gathers.”
“It’s nothing really. Just some school stress.” She spoke nonchalantly  and shrugged her shoulders, but she didn’t look up at her Da, and continued to draw figure 8’s in her fried rice.
However, that was unimportant. What mattered now was his current Trust, and Rosie’s care should anything happen to either John or himself. None of that was the issue though, the issue at hand was Rosie’s pure enjoyment of his brother’s presence. Not five minutes ago she had been bashing him upside his head with her tiny fists. Rosie was displeased at not being allowed to play with the exploded chicken, and she saw Mycroft as the one preventing her from doing so. Even though it was Sherlock who handed her over to him to keep her away from the mess.
“The wooden puzzle on the outside can be solved by anyone, but the combination for great Aunt Bathilda’s old wall safe comes from the cartesian coordinates of a cylinder, in other words, it requires Maths.”
“You know, Nan Hudson sometimes wonders how you can lure Daddy out on your adventures. She also says that’s she proud I have a proper head on my shoulders.” Rosie is grinning too, eyes full of mirth. “Yet here I am, all of seven years old, trapped in an old musty and creaky tree house with my Papa. All because you said ‘Want to go for a hike? There could be treasure’. And honestly I’m my fathers’ daughter.”
Greg nodded. “Good, go home and get warmed up. I’ll call you both into the station for your statements tomorrow.” He turned and walked back towards the crime scene, and the squad car that held their suspect.
When getting mushy about your relationship with your cousins, the quote often goes something along the lines of ‘cousins are your first friends.’ In most cases that’s correct however, at this exact moment fourteen year old Rosamund Mary Watson-Holmes was decidedly not friends with her five year old cousins Gina and Max. No, definitely not.
"I don't know about that Regal Regina, but I think a cuddle would do me some good." Rosie sat up and extended her arms towards the younger girl. Gina ran and bounced on to the bed and into Rosie's arms. They made themselves comfortable and enjoyed each other's company. Gina, though glad to offer her cousin the support she needed, was mentally preparing the demise of a teenage boy. For now however, it was cuddle time.
“I don’t understand, I thought we were the same, that we were friends.” Stasha looked terribly upset as Rosie finished her call.
“He threw his dissected frog at his lab partner, who happened to be the owner’s daughter. I should say said incident occurred after Sherlock had smuggled the abomination onto the playground. He wanted to show the girl why she missed question three of the lab write up.” Mycroft was now mirroring Greg’s position.
It had been a year since the fire that burned and hollowed out Musgrave Hall. A year since she was forced to concede that something was wrong with her only daughter. A year since the last spark of joy left her middle son’s eyes, and a year since her oldest had stopped eating cakes and started forging his tongue into a cutting blade. So much has changed but, today was the biggest change come to pass. Her children had always been home schooled before, now though, she thought it was best to send them out into the world. Perhaps Sherlock would brighten at the thought of adventures with someone his age again, maybe they can stop feeding into his restructured memory, maybe he can finally grieve.
Greg laughs. “Well I’m not  a walking pregnancy test like some people.” Mycroft then coughs that’s sounds suspiciously like Sherlock. “And this one has been keeping his promise of no deductions when it comes to you and our arrangement.”
Then Mycroft had to go and ruin it by being...cute. Sherlock snarled at the thought, he had been facing the living room scrubbing the island when it happened.
“No!” The Lestrade-Holmes twins kept dancing in a circle in the centre of their playroom. Rosie’s pads stuck to every surface imaginable. The windows, walls, the back of Max’s shirt. Everywhere. If that weren’t bad enough each twin also had one of Rosie’s bras on. Rosie was currently chasing Gina attempting to remove said article of clothing but, the slippery little snake demon dodged and danced at all the right moments.
Molly smiles, through tears, but not unhappy ones. She shakes her head. “No, no, it won’t be like last time,” she grins, and the entirely too loud pub is suddenly silent, at least to the ears of the three involved people, “four and a half months. Honestly I thought the baggy clothes and yoga pants would give it away the moment you saw me.”
“So there are cameras in our living room and kitchen. You only want to look out for us, and Papa says you took out the voice recorders. That means you can only peak in and see how we are, you’re always working Uncle Mycroft, how else will you know we’re ok.” Rosie spoke as if this were normal behaviour, as if all families behaved as hers did. It was touching.
Maybe it was the fact that this was their first time going out to dinner wearing these rings. John stared at his ring for a while. After less than a day, it had felt like the ring had always been there.
Once they are settled with boxes of delicious duck and rice half an hour later, Sherlock mentions the 19th century case again. He tells John why he hasn’t been able to solve it yet, the reluctance of admitting his failure clearly audible in his tone. John promises to look into the medical records of malaria cases in late 19th century Brighton, to which Sherlock replies with a content smile. They also go through the Monkford case again. John takes notes on one of the empty notebooks he picked up from the floor, almost forgetting his boxes of food completely. He slips the notebook into his pocket afterwards and quickly finishes his dinner.
I climb down the stairs still in my pyjamas to find my flatmate curled up on the sofa. “I need you to go to the supermarket and buy the following supplies: crystal iodine, baby powder, a make-up brush with soft bristles and a blue plastic container,” he says with closed eyes.
Sherlock is lying on his back, with the scarf wrapped tightly around his neck, but he sits up straight when he sees the tray in John’s hands.
It wasn’t as if Rosie had changed Sherlock’s entire being. She had merely brought out a side of Sherlock that had already existed, a side that had been successfully hidden beneath a mask of indifference that probably only John had ever seen taken off. Rosie’s love for her Papa, however, had caused Sherlock’s mask to dissolve.
“You do? What a marvelous coincidence! I could use your help on this case. Lestrade found an abandoned car with the owner’s blood smeared all over the front seats. No sign of the body, though. Will you come along?”
For a moment, Sherlock is confused by the nature of the question, before he realises John is asking about his profession. He tries to ignore the fact that his name sounds strangely different from John’s lips and shifts in his seat.
“Well, there seems to be some sort of connection between us. I knew he was in danger – it turned out he was about to take a damn pill that could’ve killed him – so I went to where he was and… saved his life. ”
“Alright, okay I get it!” I interrupt him. “So what’s the iodine for?” I ask, deliberately trying to change the subject.
When she turns around to leave, the guy asks: “How do you feel about the violin?” I turn around to look at the woman, but she’s already leaving, apparently not feeling like the addressee of the question. Who does he mean, then? Mike? Or me?
I wonder what he needs my help for. Maybe he has already forgotten his text from before. “Busy?” I ask.
“Why exactly are we doing this again?” John whispers. He is close to Sherlock, very close, almost closer than strictly necessary for the situation.
“Well, that was true for a long time. But after meeting you, my priorities shifted somehow. I just never had the courage to tell you.”
Sherlock was already halfway out of the door when he turned back. “John? We’ll figure it all out, as we always have.”
He looks up at Sherlock again, after staring at the table for the last ten minutes. Sherlock fights the urge to lean forward and embrace John with all his strength. The hound, Henry Knight, Sherlock’s panic attack, Baskerville, none of these things matter anymore.
I head straight to the cemetery. The air has changed into a slight breeze, so I turn my coat collar up like Sherlock always does. He and his damn cheekbones. None of this would’ve happened if he weren’t so ignorant about other people’s feelings. And his own.
John pinches the back of his nose before retrieving to his room to decide what to wear. He leaves a sulking Sherlock on the sofa.
As soon as we’re in the cab, he turns his head to the window and starts talking. “I haven’t really talked to the client, yet, except via e-mail, but I’ll ask him to repeat his story in a face-to-face conversation. I only know that the client got married on the 22th and his bride apparently disappeared from the reception. He couldn’t come to Baker Street so we’re meeting him at his house.”
He points at a large tree in front of them and starts jogging towards it. Sherlock follows immediately. There is a bicycle slightly hidden underneath a pile of leaves, but it's not alone. The body next to it is already cold. Dried blood on the forehead reveals the cause of death.
Just as I am about to ascend the stairs, I hear hysterical noises coming through the door of 221A. Fearing that Mrs Hudson might have lost her mind, I open the door to check on her. She is sitting at her table and, I realise with relief, laughing in a high-pitched tone.
“W…well, the only thing I can think of is that she dropped her bouquet right after the ceremony and this guy picked it up for her. He was one of the staff I guess. After that, she started acting a bit differently.”
Sitting down on a comfy red armchair in the living room, John feels ashamed of himself and his thoughts. Is it his fault he feels that way about this flat? He takes the tea from Sherlock, who has taken a seat on the black leather chair opposite of him.
Sherlock helps me by serving as a step ladder. He gently pushes me higher up on the wall and I finally manage to land on the other side. A minute later, Sherlock lands on the ground as elegant as ever.
The visible reluctance for the last two words makes Sherlock’s heart sink. Never in a thousand years would he have believed that one day John would say
Sherlock stops. John looks intimidated and Sherlock already half expects him to run to his coat and storm off, if he’s anything like the John from ten years ago. Instead, John reaches for Sherlock’s shoulder and squeezes it with his hand, then rests it there and smiles.
They lie down next to each other; Mary’s back curled against John’s torso. He nuzzles into her hair, taking deep breaths and inhaling her scent to calm himself. Frankly, he doesn’t recall the last time they lay together like this.
“Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any gold ones at 7 a.m. in the morning, so we’ll have to make do,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock and John don’t talk about their fight the next day. Or the day after that. They don’t kiss anymore, either. They both try to ignore the tension between them and avoid sitting on the sofa at the same time. Days turn into weeks and Sherlock doesn’t remember the last time their relationship has been this distanced. He doesn’t know what to do; John is usually the one who knows what to do, except he can’t ask him for help now. They still go through their routine of visiting places, watching photos and visiting acquaintances, only now it seems like they’re not making any progress, at all. In the evenings, the silence stretches between them and Sherlock focuses his attention to solving cold cases from the 19th century. John, on the other hand, keeps spending more and more time on his phone, and tries to turn the screen away from Sherlock suspiciously often.
“Okay, but we were supposed to buy some furniture and decorate the nursery today.” Mary sits up in bed and strokes her belly.
He can’t see anyone right now, or ever. The only companion he finds slightly tolerable is his landlady’s. When he hears two pairs of feet on the steps, he prepares to exclaim his request to be alone. But when he sees who’s standing next to Mrs. Hudson, the words die on his lips.
“Okay, okay. John I am worried about you. I know from your blog that today was the day you met Sherlock –“
I stop and turn to look at Sherlock. He seems frozen, unable to move or speak. His mouth is half open and his face reminds me a lot of when he first found out he was my best friend.
John opens his mouth to say something but Sherlock silences him by raising his hand and standing up.
Back in the cab, Sherlock is typing away on his phone with quick fingers. He smiles at the screen after receiving a reply and tells the taxi driver to drop us off at an address I’ve never heard of. I look at him questioningly, but Sherlock remains silent. We drive for a couple of minutes when the taxi drops us off at a side road. Sherlock tells the driver to wait for us and I follow Sherlock without asking.
Back at 221B, Sherlock calls for Mrs. Hudson, who seems to be absent. He distantly recalls her mentioning another weekend away with her current partner, but Sherlock doesn’t remember whether it’s still the one with the wife in Winchester or not. Maybe it’s better for him to leave without his landlady trying to talk him out of it. He decides to call her from Germany; but the knowledge of not seeing her again hurts more than he anticipated.
Sherlock tries to sound convincing. The least he wants is to make John feel obligated to spend time with him. Sherlock knows John feels torn between spending his free time with Mary and him; and he hates it. He doesn’t want to be a burden; an obligation for John just because they happen to be bonded by fait.
He took Sherlock’s hand into his own and carefully nodded their fingers together. Sherlock’s hand was a lot warmer than Rosie’s and his lean fingers fit perfectly into John’s.
Frankly, the old Sherlock, the one pre-John, never had problems with that. He had his feelings locked up in his mind palace for longer than he can remember. After Redbeard, he had learned to build up walls and not make the mistake of loving again. Because love was a dangerous disadvantage, found on the losing side. Only after he met John had he realised that love was also worth the pain, the sacrifice. And that love, true, real and selfless love,
Just in that moment, Sherlock recognises the look on John’s face. It’s the expression he makes when he feels slightly uncomfortable, mostly around strangers who ask him inappropriate questions. Sherlock feels like he’s going to faint and tightens his grip on the armrest.
John, clenching his left hand into a fist, looks up at Sherlock with an indeterminable expression. “I’m glad I
In between all of the visitors and restaurants, Sherlock lets John get to know him again. They spend their days almost like they used to in between cases, expect they never touch and John doesn’t bicker with him. He doesn’t even complain about body parts in the fridge anymore. He seems too careful not to hurt Sherlock, or he simply doesn’t care at all. But never once has he taken his ring off. Sherlock still sleeps on the sofa, because he can’t bear to go up to John’s old room and transport himself back to 2010.
“We already talked to the lad’s wife,” Lestrade explains with his arms crossed, “and she thinks it was his brother Keith. He would inherit their father’s house if his elder brother died. She says that her husband never drank much alcohol, and that he was only drunk because of his friend’s stag night.”
He steps further into the room, staring at Sherlock’s empty chair for a second. He only notices the letter in the corner of his eyes once he turns back around.
Mike suggests to introduce me to said person right away, a guy who apparently works at Bart’s, too. It’s not a far walk from the park. Mike needs to go back after his lunch break, anyway. Being back at the hospital feels strange. This is a place I used to spend most of my time, I used to have friends here, colleagues, and I even met a couple of my girlfriends here. Being here now makes me feel out of place. I don’t belong here, not anymore. We go through the large corridors of the building until we reach the lab area. Mike holds the door open for me as we enter one of the labs. The room is empty except for a tall man who stands at one of the tables extracting a liquid from a pipette into a petri dish. He has dark curly hair and a very tall and slim figure. He’s probably about my age, maybe a bit younger, his skin is quite pale and he’s wearing a suit (in a lab), which makes him look a bit posh. He seems focused on his task.
“That’s alright, I will do that. You go and – ” She gives me a questioning look. I realise I haven’t told her why I needed her to watch Rosie today.
I make myself some breakfast in the kitchen. While buttering my toast, I take a quick glance at the calendar. I know what day it is today, but I can’t help it. Right next to the calendar, I suddenly see him standing against the door frame and grinning at me. Of course he has to show up today, that selfish git. I haven’t seen him this early in the morning in a long time. He must know which day it is, too. He watches me while I eat, the same way he used to whenever I ate and he wasn’t hungry or refused to eat because of a case. Before leaving for work, I make sure that he stays seated at the table, and I pray to myself that he won’t come to work with me.
“I can’t afford London on an army pension,” I admit. Eventually, I will have to move to the countryside. Get back to work, obviously not as a soldier but as a doctor. It could be nice, I guess.
“But who –”. The doorbell interrupts my next question. Sherlock sighs and stands up at once, obviously glad to have an excuse to leave the conversation. I hear him talk to Molly downstairs. Maybe he’s interest in her, I briefly wonder. I’ll probably never know. I walk down to see Sherlock with Rosie in his arms. I thank Molly again for babysitting but can’t take my eyes off of Sherlock and my daughter. My heart does a little jump at the sight. God, I must have missed her more than I thought.
“Watson!” Sherlock can’t help but snap at him. This must be a nightmare, it must be! He has probably fallen asleep on that damn chair after all. But the thing is – no nightmare has ever felt so horrifying.
The cab ride home feels like torture. Neither of them dare to speak, but their eyes are glued together. Sherlock is still holding John’s hand tightly, and John enjoys the warmth spreading from Sherlock’s fingers as well as the tingling that never seems to fade when their hands touch.
“I brought booze,” he adds and shows Sherlock the whiskey bottle in his bag. It’s a sad attempt at drowning his problems in alcohol. His sister would be proud of him, John thinks. The whole issue is that Mary made up her mind too late. Had she told him that the thought of him and Sherlock together made her uncomfortable after a couple of weeks, he would’ve understood. He was surprised by her openness towards their friendship, anyway. She even encouraged him to spend time with Sherlock when John still felt too guilty. So why did she change her mind now, when Sherlock already took a spot in John’s heart, when not seeing him anymore just isn’t an option? Why does she try to forbid their contact now that they’re such good friends? What made her change her mind?
It all goes down very quickly. Within seconds, the three men are lying on the ground – two guns pointed at them; one of them dead. Miss Adler, however, can’t keep her mouth shut.
“Yes, that’s my name,” John responds. His voice is firmer now and he can already lift his head a bit. “So, what happened, Doctor? Why am I here?”
“Ah Molly, coffee, thank you!” The lad says while handing me back my phone. He asks her something about her lipstick, which seems quite rude, but she doesn’t seem to mind. Maybe they are friends.
. I can still see him clearly, with his dark curly hair and his long coat flying in the wind, making him look like a hero with a cape. No matter what he told me back the night before he… the night we were both arrested, he was a hero. And he always will be.
“Yes, apparently I am. Doesn’t happen very often, but if it does, I do require some sleep. Even my brain needs reproduction of the oligodendrocytes to function properly.”
“Thanks. I’ll be home soon. Love you,” John says before hanging up. Returning his attention to Sherlock, he notices a peculiar expression on his face.
“Hatty, as someone who has lost his wife I can assure you that your husband will be very glad to know that you’re alive. Please come with us.”
I take a step forward. Maybe today I can make an exception. I place one hand on the gravestone like I did right after he died, because it gives me the balance and stability I need right now. I clear my throat, look around to check that nobody is watching me, and start to whisper.
“Hey, Mike. Are you ready?” He quickly glances at Sherlock and their eyes meet. “Or should I wait outside?”
After meeting Sherlock, however, he realised that it can be different. The more time he spent with Sherlock, the more time he wanted to spend with him. He was never bored during the long afternoons at 221B, never preferred solace to Sherlock’s presence, never wanted more distance, or less conversations. Right from their very first encounter, John was hooked. He was drawn to the detective like a magnet. The first weeks spent apart were harder than he could’ve possibly imagined; as was the joy of being reunited. When he found Sherlock in the warehouse tank a couple of months later, he didn’t even think twice about jumping in after him. He would’ve gladly drowned to save Sherlock’s life. That’s when he knew he’d found his best friend. During The Woman case, John started to notice that his feelings for his person went beyond friendship. He was furious when he found Irene Adler flirting at Sherlock, yet he didn’t care when the new nurse flirted ambitiously with Mary. He tried blaming it all on the soulmate thing, pushing all emotions into the back of his mind, ignoring the feelings that where stirring up underneath the surface. Now it seems these repressed emotions were unwillingly released, coming at him like a flood and causing him to kiss the holy hell out of Sherlock in the middle of the night.
“I’m sorry, mate, no civilians today,” the officer says. His grey hair is sticking out in several directions and John figures that he’s probably got better things to do right now, but his voice is polite nonetheless.
“I know, but then again I didn’t really have much time to prepare. You see, I always know when I’m being followed. So there really was no use in your charade.”
John sits up a bit straighter, changing his composure immediately. He looks at Sherlock curiously, apparently thankful for the change of topic.
The gift is the board game Cluedo, which John and Sherlock haven’t played in a long time. In fact, the last time they’d played, it ended with the board pinned to the wall above the mantelpiece. After that it was more Monopoly and card games for them. Sherlock grins.
“Then I take her hand –“ he carefully takes Sherlock’s hand into his own and starts to draw tiny circles with his finger – “and I try to convey my attraction with my eyes.”
We talk a bit more about the possibilities of Rosie’s future, until I hear her cry from the baby monitor. As I’m about to get out of my chair, Sherlock places a hand on my shoulder and pushes me back down.
The frustration is audible in his voice. I have to swallow the accusation that I went to Tesco for nothing down and instead try to think of something to cheer him up. “Why don’t we ask Greg to give us a new case? Could be fun.”
Inside, pitch black darkness embraces Sherlock. He has to blink several times to adjust his vision before slowly moving forward. He tries to deduce everything he can – no lights, no screams or cry indicating a potential victim, no sign of any human being in his immediate environment. He stays still, waiting for what he knows is going to come.
When the voice of that ginger-haired Brit whose name John always forgot started filling the air, Rosie dropped John’s hand and looked up at him expectantly.
Sherlock straightens. “I want to reconstruct the situation as closely as possible. Besides, Mr Bellinger could be hiding something himself, and I don’t want to rely on his intervention.”
They start giggling simultaneously. John, unwilling to keep a straight face, pushes aside the lacking memory of when he last laughed as much with Mary.
“You're the new guy,” the boy's face didn't change from the bored expression that he had before John had spoken.
John could only imagine what the woman were talking about as he passed through the glass doors to the lobby. He only hoped that he hadn't blundered his first impressions too badly, but John couldn't imagine pretending to be pleasant today.
The rest of the day passed and soon enough the rest of the office started to rustle in their packing up.
“I know, but if you remember correctly, I did warn you away from him. He screwed my cousin last Christmas and never gave back her cardigan,” the brunette looked over to John with a warm smile and stretched out her hand, “Hi, I'm Molly, the only woman in the office who Anderson hasn't tried to sleep with.”
The boys eyes flashed, not in anger at John's response, but seemingly in excitement at the idea of a respite from the monotony of the day.
Walking through the office wasn't any experience that was new to John. Back corner, accountants, other corner, quality control. Grey and carpeted and quiet, it looked the exact same as the Slough office, the only difference being the people. As they went through the office, Anderson started a sleazy narrative of all the women he had “stuffed”, and John could feel his disgust in this man grow in his throat. He'd met worse, though.
The moment the words came out of Sherlock's mouth, John felt an unusual relief, as well as even more embarrassment.
“No need to worry, although I'm thankful that you did.” Sherlock did seem genuine, if not a bit embarrassed himself. He looked to John for the first time since it happened, “He's my brother,” He continued, huffing out a breath that was more self deprecating than Sherlock intended.
Anderson's white cheeks coloured, and the earlier bravado that he demonstrated with John disappeared the moment he started sputtering, “You-now, listen here-”
seeming as John, a near stranger come to his defence, he said, “Well, as interested as I am in this a half testosterone, half dramatic-flare induced stare off going in front of me, I think I'll just take my leave.”
Sally stuck her hand out as well, “And I'm Sally, the one who fell for it. But I assure you, the moment I saw their wedding picture, I punched him in his naked balls and left.”
His question was answered when he heard the low rumblings of Sherlock's voice accompanying another's.
“Yeah, good thanks,” John said with a more genuine smile than they had seen yet, before turning back to his work, “See you both tomorrow.”
“John, where will you go?” This was asked while John was packing his belongings from around Harry's small house, Harry following closely behind and even going so far as to standing on his backpack strap until he gave her an answer of a shrug. John didn't have any idea of where he would go, but he would never admit to Harry that her questions were working. Where
John shook both of their hands, but didn't offer his own name. After all, they had heard been at the meeting.
“Oh! Yes, he's just past those double doors there,” she called, watching John's already retreating back with trepidation, “Oh boy, let's hope Sherlock called in today. John doesn't look like he'd appreciate a grilling at the moment,” she said softly to Sally, already anticipating the worst.
“Ugh,” moaned Sally, “I make one drunken mistake and now he won't leave me alone! Granted, it was my first week, and I had no idea that he was married,” Sally's eyes cut to the other woman, who pouted playfully back.
His father would have called him a coward. He was always brutally honest, John Watson senior. His mother would have scolded his father before saying that it was the safe thing to do, and that it was a smart choice. Harry, well...she was probably right to be worried about his choices. And really, he should be grateful for her concern, but all he wanted was to get away from her.
“Sherlock?” His head lolled against the headrest of the seat and John cursed, holding his fingers to Sherlock’s pulse. “His hearts racing…call an ambulance!” He opened Sherlock’s eyes, one at a time and frowned, “His pupils are dilated.”
They were kept warm, the paramedics wanting them to go to the hospital but they both adamantly refused, wanting to go back
“Right, if you’re just going to insult me, I’ll be leaving.” Mycroft tried to hold in a dramatic sigh and pulled out an envelope from beside him. He handed it to John. “What’s this then?”
Prompt: John takes Sherlock to a military ball and all the other male soldiers are fawning over Sherlock causing John to get jealous. (For Belle333)
Sherlock got to his feet and quickly went over to one of the curtain covered windows and pulled it aside. It was raining again today but he didn’t care. He pried open the latch and pulled open the window, rain pelting his face. Without a glance back, Sherlock crawled out and pulled the window shut behind him before taking off towards the woods. The ground was muddy and his shoes quickly filled with water. He wasn’t dressed for the weather and felt his jumper weighing him down from the rain it collected. He ran and ran until his lungs burned and his legs wobbled.
Once the darkness has finally reached Dartmoor, the three of them make their way to Dewer’s Hollow, the place where the client’s nightmare began. Equipped with a handful of flashlights, John feels secure next to his tall companions. It’s not like he believes in the gigantic hound story, but he wouldn’t exactly enjoy being out here on his own either.
There’s a pause during which Sherlock just stares at him. John clenches and unclenches his left hand, looking at the floor.
“Nice to meet you,” Mike’s friend says while stretching out his right hand. Something holds Sherlock back from taking it, so he places the phone into the offered hand, instead. Dr. Watson clears his throat, his other hand briefly clenches into a fist, and retrieves the phone back into his pocket.
“I can sense that you’re feeling distressed,” Sherlock admits. It’s rare for either of them to mention their bond so openly.
Sherlock quickly types away a message into the phone while simultaneously deducing the man in front of him. The words fly across Dr. Watson’s body and Sherlock reads them with practiced ease.
“Well, when we became flatmates, I studied the texture of your jumpers, the percentage of grey and blond hairs on your scalp and the responses you had to my dressing gowns, among other things. But these were just the calculable, obvious things. Even though I’ve spent so much time by your side, you still remain a mystery to me. That’s what I always found so intriguing about you. You’re like the double side of a coin: you’re a doctor, which means that you heal people, but you’re also a soldier; on the first glance one might find you an average looking man, but upon closer look you’re the complete opposite of ordinary; you have a warm heart and always care about others, but you’re also brave and strong and protective. You’ve saved my life so many times with your gun; but even more times with your heart.”
I exhale sharply. “Do you think his murder’s got something to do with the case? It could be a coincidence.”
After telling Mary that I’m going to see Sherlock, I head towards Baker Street. I can’t help but feel a bit nervous. It’s ridiculous. I wasn’t really nervous when I asked Mary to marry me, so why I am nervous to ask Sherlock to be my best man is beyond me. He probably already expects it, or at least deduced it from my facial expression when we last saw each other. I enter the flat with my keys. Sherlock never asked me to return them and I never offered to.
I realise this first chapter is basically a summary of the first part of 1x01, so apologies for that!
“You think I’m not capable of loving?” Sherlock’s voice is calm, but the hurt in his eyes betrays him.
“Yeah. It’s been over three weeks and I think today is a good time to start again,” I reply, thinking about the date. It’s weird that I still notice it every single year.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Sherlock asks while placing his violin onto the small table next to him.
“You don’t have to,” Sherlock interrupts. He suddenly realizes what a great deal this is for John. It’s also a sign of his trust, something Sherlock doesn’t take for granted.
John only manages a couple of nervous breaths, so Sherlock props up the panel against the wall of the train in order to examine it more closely. There’s a countdown clock momentarily frozen at 02:30, so there’s still some time left.
“Do you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr. Holmes?” Miss Adler resumes. “However hard you try, it’s always a self-portrait.”
Sherlock has to blink several times, trying to let the words sink in. The last six weeks were a torture for him, but all this time he thought John had already forgotten him. The only comforting thought was that he was doing what John wanted, what was best for him. Knowing that he was unhappy as well makes it all so much worse.
When their lips finally met, John closed his eyes and felt the same sensation of falling that he had experienced the first time. Only this kiss was a lot more intense, demanding almost. John guided his hand around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him closer. Sherlock, who made a gasping sound in response, had one hand in John’s hair and the other around his torso. They kissed and kissed and kissed, and it was better than John could’ve ever dreamed of.
I turn around and look for my watch. It’s still a bit early to get up on a Sunday but I can already hear Sherlock downstairs. He must feel restless, because he hasn’t had a case in weeks. The time in between cases has improved significantly, but he still needs the thrill of the chase. Since Rosie and I moved here, Sherlock has banned all his experiments from the kitchen to his bedroom. The flat was already baby-proof before, and he only did experiments in the kitchen when Rosie wasn’t there (and immediately cleaned up afterwards, to my joy), but now he keeps all his stuff in his bedroom. I can hear him rummaging around with his lab supplies, he must still be working on the carpet-blood reaction experiment. Sherlock has gotten a bit slower with his experiments, although that’s mainly because of my daughter.
“S?” John frowned, watching as the dragon searched down at the page, “h…e…r…l. Your name is Sherl?” The dragon snarled and continued, “o…c…k…” The dragon sat back and looked expectantly up at John. “Sher…lock. Sherlock. Is that your name?” The dragon moved and climbed up John’s arm again to wrap around his shoulders. “Sherlock. It’s nice to meet you.” John stroked a hand down Sherlock’s tail and smiled as he buried his face in John’s neck and fell back asleep.
John chuckled and quickly went through his last few patients. He was done sooner than expected so he packed up and left for the day. He got home a little after four, setting his things down and looking around for Sherlock. He paused when he heard a voice and the shower going. He crept slowly towards the door. John covered his mouth to hold in the laughter as he heard Sherlock singing in the shower, something he had never heard in all their years together.
“What are you reading, My?” His brother didn’t respond and Sherlock backtracked, realising why. “Um…I mean, Mycroft?”
It took a few moments of Sherlock analysing John’s physical health before he slowly backed off from Mike who still stayed petrified on the ground. John moved and stroked a hand down Sherlocks snout, soothing him and speaking softly. Sherlocks body slithered around his, tail encompassing Johns legs and wings wrapping around his body, his eyes still warily pointed at Mike. Soft growls rumbled out of his throat every so often, John following with a stroke and a soft hush.
“Fine. Cold.” He carefully leaned his shoulder against John’s, needing the contact. “Wasn’t really planning on a swim today.”
He’s watching me, speculating. He thinks I’ve been using, I can see it in his eyes. The betrayal. How humorous that he finds my using a betrayal to him and not to my own self. But I haven’t. Not yet. He comes over and grabs my wrist without warning, stopping my pacing. He feels my pulse and it’s racing. I feel anxious and itchy and the last thing I want is to be touched.
John cleaned up the dragon properly and bandaged him with his mothers help. He made a nest out of blankets and pillows on his bed and placed the dragon inside. John watched as the small creature tried to stay awake, looking at John as if he was everything in the entire world. John laid next to the dragon, smiling as he watched him fall asleep. John watched the dragon a while longer before his own eyes closed and he slipped into slumber.
“It’s okay…I won’t hurt you.” He moved slowly as the dragon eyed him suspiciously. John reached out the rest of the way, the dragon sniffing at the air, centimetres from John’s fingers. The dragon hissed and tried to lash out at John, making the young boy jump and fall on to his backside. Exhausted after the exertion, the dragon tried to curl up, whimpering as the wounds continued to ooze. John sat up and tried again, “I just want to help…you’re bleeding. Please. Please, let me help.” He slowly reached out again, the dragon eyeing him warily but too exhausted to fight anymore. John carefully lifted the dragon into his arms, avoiding the wounds as best he could. “You’re heavier than I thought.” John brought the dragon over to the stream and tore apart the bottom of his trousers, washing and wrapping up the wounds with the upmost care. The white dragon was barely conscious but looked upon John as if he expected betrayal at any second.
“Hey, Sherlock!” John grinned and sat across from him on the ground. “I didn’t see you in class, I thought maybe you weren’t here.”
John let out an incredulous laugh. “I’m not letting you get high while I sit in the next room and act like I’m oblivious to you destroying yourself, Sherlock!”
The music continued on without interruption, the keys being masterfully played by a boy of seventeen. He wore a navy suit, having just come back from University. Though they were vastly different in may ways, they shared a fascination for science. It was one of the few things that they would talk about and Sherlock would soak up his brothers knowledge like a sponge.
Maybe Sherlock could be the right kind of excitement for him, and it was that thought that made him blurt out,
“Well, yes. I mean, who else would I be?” John responded quickly, in a tone that he would probably be ashamed of at a different time. But right now, all he was, was annoyed. Annoyed at the day, annoyed by the sales sheets, annoyed by the bored kid in front of him that probably had much better things to do, while John had nothing waiting for him whatsoever.
“Sally, hon, how was your weekend?” Anderson said, an oily tone overtaking his already displeasing voice.
of course you are right. You could be no one but the new employee that was just transferred here, based on your cuffed trousers,” Now the boy's face was far from bored. In fact, John felt the weight of the icy blue eyes as he scanned his body intensely, as if reading a book, “Here are your sales sheets.”
“Yes...yes, of course I do,” Anderson replied, straightening his tie in a show of forced superiority, “Just go to reception to get your new price sheets,” And with that, the man turned on his heel and left.
They continued in silence once more, and John started to question what was going on. Why was he following this beautiful man? He tried to reason with himself, saying that he was there for protection. After all, Sherlock's delicate, bird bone looking body didn't look equipped for what might come out during the night.
. Sherlock could be a Soviet spy for all John knew, capable of more than his appearance let on. He spent the last five years of his life avoiding excitement, which John was sure was a main component of Sherlock. Although that was true, he couldn't bear going back to the life he left behind in Slough: dull, lifeless...empty.
tall. His tweed suit matched his voice perfectly; posh and important-seeming, but really, John knew nothing about the world of bespoke suits. However, that wasn't the first thing that John noticed. The first thing he noticed was the sharpness of his brown eyes as they cut to John's, and that they nearly made John falter in his steps. His mouth was curled up in a minute smile that John couldn't tell was genuine or not, which was unnerving to him as he considered himself good at reading people.
Good first day?” Molly asked as she glanced at the clock that read 5 o'clock. Sally paused in her own packing up to see John suck in a breath, as if gearing up for a rant. But instead;
“Oh Sally, he's just a kid,” Molly didn't try to hide her disapproval as she would for others, and Sally felt only a morsel of guilt.
“Well, it's nice to meet you both. Can you point me in the direction of reception? I'd really like to get settled in...with my sales sheets...” John trailed off, realising that he was in the same boat that he was two weeks ago.
The boy sighed, just a puff of air past his lips, “You cuffed the hem of your trousers, but the rest of your suit is tailored, so it's not due to an ill fit. Fashion? Doesn't seem likely based on the fact that your suit is at least 10 years old, and your haircut. Now, why else would you cuff them? Perhaps trying to hide the mud stains that you got on your walk in today. From the amount that you cuffed, you must have walked a long way. Although everyone that works here knows that our building is right next to the tube entrance, so you must have gotten lost.”
But John was only amazed; he couldn't even imagine how the boy's brain must be working to pick up that information. And John was willing to bet that he could read much more than just that.
“Yeah, sure mate, thanks.” John replied, hiking his bag higher on his twinging shoulder, ignoring the look of pity that Anderson gave him, no doubt having been told by David his story.
The next time John checked the clock, it was an hour later, and the sun had completely fallen past the horizon and the office was gathering shadows. John couldn't see anyone around and so the shadows were making him jumpy- not acting as a security blanket as they once had. The towering pile of leads that he'd been working on were now all logged into his personal clientele sheets, and his desk was sharply organized the way that he liked it. Not wanting to go ,back to his empty flat (Harry was right about the loneliness, he'd give her that), he sluggishly started to pack his bag. As John made his way to the reception area, he mindlessly wondered if Sherlock was still there.
“Hi, uh, could I get my sales sheets?” asked John when he reached the desk, looking down on a head full of dark curls. When the owner of the head looked up, John tried hard to ignore the magnitude of his pale eyes. Instead, John tried to wait for the boy's response without fidgeting under his gaze.
Perhaps it was his sister's morning talk about his job and his sleeping on her couch (again) and his refusal to admit that he kept a gun in his gym bag. Perhaps it was the receptionist's eyes on him as he struggled to come to terms with his lessening attraction towards her and more towards her rough and crude fiancée. John imagined it was a combination of everything in that had him gasping for air in a town with absolutely
“What brought this on? Why all of a sudden?” She had asked when he got home that same night with the news, cheeks still flushed with the excitement of something new finally happening in his life.
going on. Nothing to keep his mind or body occupied and off the temptation of a stiff drink. He felt stifled, and when David called him into his office, offering him the head of sales position, instead of accepting, all he said was, “I'll have my notice on your desk by the end of the day.”
“Oh, right,” John responded, not sure how to respond, forgetting his previous annoyance in the wake of such an odd response. He grabbed the binder, and turned back in the direction of his desk.
The boy hardly took a breath while he was explaining, and when he was done, his cheeks were a bit flushed. His eyes were wary, guarded, an expression that John was very familiar with.
From then it was only waiting out the two weeks while they found a replacement (not that it would be difficult to find a willing person to fill a skill-less position) and ignoring his sister's constant questions.
After the meeting, John took his stuff and went to find his desk. Anderson, being head of HR, offered to show him around the office.
Sally, thinking the opposite, said, “No, actually he seems to be in the perfect mood for it. Maybe little Sherlock will get a nice bop,” she responded, all too gleeful at the thought.
If the tone didn't jog John's memories of his sordid youth on the streets, although he was familiar with a darker edge twinging the ever present authority, then the words were sure to do it. John had heard those exact same words many times in his past, enough times to know that it usually makes for an unpleasant situation.
“Alright everyone, I'd just like to take a moment out of our meeting to give a welcome to our new sales associate, John. He's a transfer from our Slough branch, so, you know, just show him around and how we do things here in London,” Anderson gave a large slap to John's back and sent him back to his seat. John felt the gaze of his new co-workers on his back as they murmured welcomes. John just gave a vague smile, and tried not to let the boredom show on his face.
The other man immediately raised both eyebrows, as if in surprise, even though the rest of his face remained falsely pleasant. Mocking.
“Sherlock,” The boy responded, not yet relaxing his posture, still eyeing John in anticipation of his response.
“Your desk, my good sir.” Anderson says with a forced flourish, gesturing to a space in the sales clump of desks, between two small women, neither of them looking up to greet the two men. Anderson's disposition changed as he approached the woman to John's right, who John noted straightened her back, as if waiting for a fight.
“Sherlock, I told you not to ignore my calls,” said a deliberate and distinguished sounding voice, the type that John still had a hard time not automatically resenting, “You have two more days to get me what I want,” The voice continued, taking on a tone of authority.
Not wanting to seem like he was eavesdropping, John moved faster towards the two men, who he still couldn't see. As he passed through the double doors to the reception desk, heard Sherlock heave a sign.
he go? He had no qualifications, having dropped out of uni after only one year. Two years after that he spent drinking on Harry's couch, which certainly didn't make the death of her wife any easier to take. When he finally got back on his feet, he found himself applying for a sales job, which is where he had been for the past six years. It was that thought that had him calling in a favour to his boss. By the end of the phone call, he had been in contact with head office, and officially transferred to the London branch.
