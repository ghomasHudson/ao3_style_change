John looked down and then shook his head slightly. "Leave me some of your stuff, I'm a doctor. I will do everything that I can."
"You're nervous." His therapist said (he really needed to remember her name, but he just couldn't.)
Sherlock understood, he had seen the orderly with the broken arm as they had coming into the building, seen the way he had glared at John, instinctively holding his cast covered arm to himself.
Sitting in silence as someone watched you so intently was nothing new to Ari, but having one Sherlock Holmes watching you was totally different.
“I know. I tried to warn you.” John’s thumb ran over his cheek. “Just breath for me okay.”
Sherlock frowned, he didn't want to trust the man, but freedom was just feet away. Looking at the others he held his knife out then slowly made his way to the glass doors that led outside.
“John.” He tried again, this time getting the whole word out but his voice no more than a whisper. Clenching his fists, he tried again but ended up coughing, a lot, which in the end was the thing that woke John Watson.
Sighing John got up off the bed and made his way to the unit that dispensed the painkiller they had been using and frowned finding it turned up to the full amount.
“No.” He growls.
"Sherlock?" John called through the door...John.
"Yes."
Sherlock stood with his hand out, reaching for the door handle, but he froze, finding himself unable to touch, to open the door.
"No thank you John."
Sometime while he had been out his shirt had been cut from him leaving him topless. The area he had been shot was heavily gauzed but already blood could be seen bleeding through.
Sherlock turned to John his perfect eyes opening. “I got back in, you allowed me that. I’m trying to control the pain on my own.”
.~.~.~.~.
"My sister, he thought she was my brother."
Silence fell around them for a time till Sherlock stood and walked to the wall his hand running over the smooth surface.
Pushing those memories away he sat and listened as Sherlock spoke, as Mycroft answered and then watched as Sherlock slowly became tired and then simply fell back to sleep. He watched as the man slept for a while before letting go of the hand still wrapped around his fingers.
"Right, of course, thank you."
Sherlock looked at the man as he curled up on his side, his hand placed under his head. "Will you be here when I wake?"
"I'll be back tomorrow. You have nine days left." Moran broke eye contact first but only so he could look at Sherlock. "Make sure he can at least stand long enough to receive his first beating."
Sherlock stared at him from his seat, but said nothing more.
"John?"
"No John, it's too dangerous!"
Sherlock stays still, his eyes cataloguing everything, listing everything, its length, its bulk, its circumference, everything and then the things does the most unlikely thing. The head of it ripples then settles, giving Sherlock a perfect image of his own face.
Looking down at Sherlock who had stilled once again with his hands on John's hips, his head tilted back to look up at John. His eyes were wide, fully dilated, his lips slightly wet from licking them and as John watched Sherlock slowly ran his tongue over his lower lip.
John laughed and shook his head. “I really do need to sleep.”
The man continued to look at him but said nothing so John started to check him over.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock was moved to a private room, they deemed it best as the screaming from before had disturbed the other patients and their families, and they know when he woke again he will be in just as much pain.
"Mycroft Holmes." Mycroft held out his hand but John simply held his hands up showing the blood covering them, Sherlock’s blood. "Right." Mycroft dropped his hand taking a deep breath as he did so. "Please, take the car. I will be waiting upstairs for Sherlock to get out of surgery, meet me there?"
John was confused and it must have been written all over his face because Sherlock sighed before he carried on.
“He seemed so determined and yet so resigned to whatever was going on that it just confused me.”
"I leave that to you John."
"Then kiss him John." She didn't have to ask twice, John moved like a hungry man, delving hands into Sherlocks hair and kissing him that would make anyone blush, but Ari had seen much more on her life. As she watched she started to shimmy out of her dress then kicked it away as she walked around to stand behind John and let her hands roam over his back and waist before reaching around and started to pull his shirt free.
"Well after being a doctor for over twenty years I would hope I have some skill when it comes to looking after the human body."
"No John." Sherlock took John’s face in his hands, his eyes searing as he stared down. "I love you. Please don't think that a lie, please don't put what we have worked for in the same box as everything else."
"How did I miss it?" Sherlock suddenly asked causing John to smile. "Moran knew but I didn't!"
“Him.” He breathed out then his eyes opened at he left his mind palace.
At that thought he stopped, took a breath and lifted his head, his eyes now somewhat used to the dark. He could make out Sherlock spread out on the floor, still naked and probably freezing, but there was nothing either man could do. For one Sherlock was now tethered to the floor after stakes where forced into the concrete and the rope attached to Sherlock’s wrist and ankles had been attached to them, keeping him spread out, unable to curl up into himself, denying him any sort of warmth.
Leaning his head against the the cool tiled wall he let the warm water run over his back, hissing slightly at it stung. When he opened his eyes he expected to see blood red water running down his lower body and down the drain. But it was clear.
Tea was delivered once they all sat, only John had water, in a plastic cup, that for some reason Sherlock couldn't help but focus on.
"But what if I trigger another flashback in you, like today."
“Okay Sherlock, if you can hear me, I’m right here.” He got no response. Cursing he moved to kneel right in front of Sherlock, his hands gently resting on Sherlock’s knees. Two things could happen when Sherlock finally woke. One he would pass out; this would be the preferred option. Or two he was going to lose himself to the pain, and that was not something John wanted to happen, not again.
Blinking his eyes a few times to clear them he allowed his night vision to kick in then just led there watching as John slept on, unaware that it was still raining, that Sherlock was awake and watching him. He looked peaceful, happy, the stress of the day not even a shadow upon his features. Reaching out he ran a gentle finger from temple to chin, then over soft lips, round cheeks, eyebrows and nose. He ingrained the feeling of each into his mindpalace, into the room, no the wing he had over time built just for John.
As for staying, it made sense, he couldn't leave, not again, not now not ever. He needed to be where John was, always, and though he knew that was just a little not good, he really didn't care.
“How did you find us?” John asked suddenly. He hadn’t been given any information about how they had been found.
"Confirmation." Was his answer. "I need...I know, I mean he's sat right next to me, but I need to feel this when we talk about it."
"You have not spent the last four months eating here, sleeping here, working here, resting here. You don’t know how she feels when something is wrong, how she sounds when something moves, when something causes her to shift. You may have designed her Sherlock, but the Leviathan is ours, not yours and you were totally stupid to think we would need your help!"
Once they left John pulled out his phone as he made his way into the hallway, the phone having already been dialed  by the time he got there and so was ringing when he just lifted it to his ear.
Sherlock sat with his head in his hands. His fingers gripping his hair and tears drying on his face.
"Not a one." Sherlock said brightly.
"Austin Craver did things, unspeakable, evil things. Things I can't...I can't think about, let alone talk about."
"I'm here to help make the steps the two of you have problems with." She answered going to her knees. Sherlock had undone John's jeans allowing Ari to pull them down along with his boxers. Looking up as John turned to kiss Sherlocks full lips she ran a hand up each leg before cupping John's balls and placing kisses on the underside of his rather hard cock before looking down and taking John into her mouth.
Not this time.
“Greg I need your help.”
"I was already dead John." Sherlock took a few steps closer but John spun and took steps back, to which Sherlock stopped and raised his hands. "I wont touch, John, not until you are ready. Please trust me."
"You're the most ridiculous man." Sherlock shook his head as he spoke, still smiling.
"Okay. This way." The forth said causing Sherlock to frown and the others to step back.
"Nine nine nine, what emergency services do you require?"
"Yes." Sherlock said breathlessly.
"John, it is a part of me...it is me, I want to see the damage done."
What he was dealing with now, more than anything was blood loss, he need a transfusion.
“Yes.” Mycroft says. “He seems to like toying with you.”
Blinking a few times Sherlock slowly let his eyes adjust to the light of the hospital room before looking about, taking in everything around him.
Lestrade had been kept back in the warehouse so when the doors to the ambulance closed he found himself alone with one of the paramedics.
.~.~.~.~.
But he couldn't.
"The torture was the easy part, the pain reminded me I was alive. But the sleep deprivation, dehydration and starvation was what nearly drove me to the edge."
The man stared as John talked, what little colour drain from his face as John’s soft voice spoke like a lover.
"Over seventy three hours."
"Neutron counter's not showing very much."
"The others touched, of course they did, but this guy was different. The others did it to hurt, to cause humiliation. But this guy, his touches were gentle and...and he...he caused me...god this is so hard."
"I know I dont. But I want to."
"Basic torture, water given rarely and in drops only, food given days and days apart. As I said they hardly let me sleep."
"Good...I thought I could do it, let you go. I'm sorry."
“Yes, but could you please stop everything from spinning?”
"Yes."
He hadn’t seen the extent of the damage to his arm so he was unsure if he needed stitches or not. He got his answer a whoever was tending to him started to stitch. Tensing he tried to slip back into the welcome nothingness that was unconsciousness but he was denied it.
"I did something, and Mycroft deemed your time up and so he ordered your return."
"They both have two weeks! Make sure they are healed and fed, give them everything they need, then I shall deal with them."
“John…” Sherlock sounded lost, confused. “John, please, please, I can’t…just…oh god, please, just give me more, please John.”
Standing he ignored his stiff body, his frustration and anger overtaking.
"I'm well aware of that John."
"Because I was a mess." John sighed looking down at his hands before talking again. "He spent a few nights with me towards the end. We got on and I enjoyed his company then when I thought he was in the shower I called you."
"That doesn't bother me John...does it you?" Sherlock asked, trying hard to keep his voice steady.
“Sorry…that’s it? You’re sorry? Damn it Sherlock we shouldn’t have even been here! We were to be in Italy, but you insisted we postpone, that we just do this one case and then we would go, we would have our fucking ‘sex holiday’ as you like to say. We should be sat by some pool, or lazing about in bed, or searching the local area, we should be doing anything but this!”
Moran's face dropped then he barked out a laugh.
"Okay..." John said as he finishes pulling on his wet suit. "Molly’s not going...Anderson can run Little Geek."
"We have him! My god! We have him!" A voice sounded over the radio. John turned back the water expecting news of a body being found.
"If this doesn't work I will hold you personally responsible for any lasting damage."
John listened as he dried Sherlock, then taking a pale hand he walked them both into the bedroom.
Fisting his hand’s, he opened his eyes, the urge to lean down and brush his lips over Sherlock’s temple so strong that he gave in after only a few seconds. Placing a hand back on to the soft curls he lent down and just breathed in the sent coming from the man, a combination of hospital issue soap, antiseptic and something so unique he was sure it had to be Sherlock’s own sent. Smiling slightly, he placed a gentle kiss to warm skin and just allowed himself to stay there, breathing Sherlock in and allowing himself to reassure his racing heart and evil mind, to know that Sherlock was alive, that he was in safe hands, but most of all to know that he, John, had him.
Sherlock let himself be led, his eyes still refused to open, especially now he had a name.
"Yes. It is a bugger and when I think it's nearly healed it throws another flashback at me."
It wouldn't be till much later that he realised that he never gave the man that had helped him his name, so how the hell did he know it.
Sherlock glared at the men already sitting in the small sub his pale multi-hued eyes taking in everything about each and every one of them before turning to the controls and pulling on the headset.
"Git."
“Pocket,” Sherlock said, indicating his front trouser pocket to which he was pretty sure John muttered: ‘Of course it is.’
And there was the question John had been waiting for. Could he leave Sherlock?
The light on his phone flashed, it had been flashing for a while now, it taunted him, deemed him a coward every time the blue light lit up letting him know he had a message.
John lifted his head to look at Moran as the blond stood holding the doors open.
"Tired."
“When can the monitors come off?” He asked as John pulled his blue t-shirt back on.
Mary smiled placing the bottle with the other stuff before leaving yet again.
“No I can’t.”
"You're bleeding internally as well as externally." John stated not wanting to lie, knowing the man would see right through it. "If I had my bag..." John shook his head as his voice caught.
If there was one thing he hated it was being cold. He had spent so much of his life being hot that at the first chill in the air he felt it deeply. Hence the thick jumpers, cardigans, vests and shirts. He liked being warm, liked the comfort of it, the peace it gave him.
“Hold!” Greg shouted as blue eyes went from cold hard steel to soft tired and thankful. The gun lowered as John took a step back, letting out a breath and sliding down the wall as his back met.
“Err, well, not exactly.”
"The matchbox!" John suddenly said, sobering quickly but still smile.
"Relax Sherlock." She heard John say so she reached down and took hold of Sherlocks cock, it  was still wet from John's mouth making it easy to move her hand up and down and twist.
"Ag...reed."
Hours pass.
Sherlock felt tears building as he watched John smile, watched his eyes shine even as the pain in them still could be seen.
"We dont have to do anything today. But I had some of your DVDs sent over, Mrs Hudson also sent enough scones and cakes to last four weeks." John smiled into the pillow before shuddering as he realised that it was probably Mrs H that found him. "She's not mad, she is worried and very happy that she did find you."
It had been four months since he jumped, since he left John to believe he was dead. He forced the man he loved to watch, to see it all and to feel it as though it was real when in fact it was a lie. He let the man that had loved him his whole life believe he was dead and yet here Sherlock was, willing to risk it all just to see John, to hold him, kiss him, just once, just today.
“John.”
.~.~.~.~.
He is replaced by a self-righteous, middle-aged woman.
“Damn it!” Sherlock cursed, dropping the cigarette when it burnt his fingers. He glared at the offending object, finally crushing it beneath his shoe. When he focused again on the scene across the street, the man stared back at him while his companion continued to talk.
“We only just started making one, how Moriarty made one so quickly is yet again something I am trying to find out.”
“Do you have the feed yet?” He asks not looking up.
Closing his eyes again he took in a deep breath as he tried to calm his racing heart.
“He is so much more than that, so much more than we give him credit for.” Sherlock’s eyes flicked to John who was breathing hard, sweat beaded upon his brow and his blue eyes were on fire. “Let him go James.”
Taking a quick assessment of himself he winced as he worked out what would have been hit and also registering that the bullet was still in him.
(9:30am) I have no idea! It was just left here all ready set up by one of Mycroft’s lackeys. JW
"Did they bring Star Wars?" He asked after a few sips of tea.
Leatrade frowned and looked to John who just shrugged.
So now he paced, as he thought, while also trying very hard not to let fear overwhelm him as his mind started once again to play tricks. It seemed to want to join his experience with John into what he had suffered through at the hands of his torturers.
"Fine, but if there are any changes-"
"I was raped and tortured." He muttered falling onto the sofa. "I desensitise myself."
The kettle clicked on causing John to look up with a frown as Sherlock went about making tea. Smiling slightly he put down the file he had in his hands and just watches as Sherlock grabbed two mugs then paused, glanced at his watch and grabbe another.
"Happy?"
The livingroom was empty when he walked in, the sound of the shower running though informed him of John's whereabouts. Walking to the sofa he falls down onto it, his head falling back to lean on cushion as his eyes close.
“No...don’t you dare touch him!” John screamed as they pulled back the covers and got Sherlock to his feet.
"He hurt you." Mycroft answered as he stepped into the room. "At the time I over reacted. I apologise John."
"It's okay, you can sleep now, pass out....please just pass out!" John quietly said as he ran out of packing gauze. Pulling his jumper off he folded it and pressed it over the wound before taking the medical tape and taping it down.
Silent for a moment, his rescuer hesitated. “Okay, do you have someone there to watch you for the night?”
John lowered himself to the ground so he was on the same level as Sherlock.
"I know. John would talk about you not liking others touching you. That only he could treat you when you got hurt."
"I look forward to it John."
Standing he moved himself around Sherlock’s IV’S before lowering the side of the bed and then gently moving to lay next to Sherlock’s long frame. Getting himself as comfortable as possible he led his head down next to Sherlock’s, his forehead resting against soft curls. He let himself relax before his eyes closed and within minutes he fell asleep.
"We...not like this." John smiled sadly.
“Well, you know Sherlock, too damn focused, son of a…fuck!” John pulled his hand back as he jammed his finger with the wrench. “He didn't leave me... he just left me behind.” He muttered as he sucked on the cut on his finger.
"Too much effort." John murmured back, Sherlock only understanding because of years of talking to John in a exhusted state.
"John...there are things, things you need to know, but-"
As the rig crew appear, all on high alert, all taking in Sherlock pushed against the wall the room fills with tension as everyone gets ready to fight.
Now that John had done as he had been instructed, Mycroft was glad to see the man looking well rested and not as drawn as he had been.
“Sherlock?” Mary shook at Sherlock’s shoulder waiting for a response, when none came she noted the dosage and set the drip to keep it at the level it took to keep him under.
“No…okay, but I would feel better passing this by John first.”
"Yes."
“Shot him in the head, I didn’t even give him a chance to fight, I did that once and lived to regret it.” They reached the door with the take across it, Greg pulling it all down and allowing John into the building.
"No...no...no...oh god...no...stop, please, stop." Sherlock’s voice had change from a shout to a whimper, each word a knife in John's chest.
“Thank you, thank you for sticking with him, thank you for saving him, thank you for killing Moriarty, thank you.”
"Say it." Sherlock finally said look up. "Say what you did."
John moved a curl from in front of Sherlock’s eyes before placing a kiss to his forehead.
Standing up straight John looked down at Sherlock then back to his brother and shrugged slightly. “You saw the video.”
"Right."
Something serious must have happened to him, something affecting his ability to leave, but no matter where he looked within his palace he couldn't find a single reference to what that thing could be.
"We had people try to break through to you, they all died doing so."
“What the…John!” Sally shouted as she tried again.
Falling into the bed John closed his eyes as he let out a breath and covered his eyes with his arm.
John sighed as he lent his head against Sherlock’s chest, his own arms wrapped tightly around Sherlock’s waist.
So if you got this far with me then please let me know what you thought either by comment or kudo all mean a lot.
“John...”
"I don’t care, you are John to me, your past means nothing, I only care for it because it led you to me. But now you are mine...that sounds good. You are mine John Watson, that is all I care about."
One lad in particular caught John’s attention though.
“My tolerance for most will be too high, even none opioids.” Sherlock said as he turned away from Mary to look up at John. “This is fine, just this, this I can do.”
“Of course not.”
Sherlock nods to John as he and Mike steps into the moonpool and slowly made their way to the edge and then dropped slowly into the dark water below. As the reach the sea bed Sherlock takes the chance to look around at his beloved rig, to take in as much as the damage done but keeping his focus on the task ahead. As they walked, pulling their own air umbilical’s behind them, they walked through the wreckage with little Geek following behind like some sort of loyal dog. As they reach the first valve assembly, the thing that would give them much needed air and time, Sherlock turns to Mike.
"John it's wrong."
“Is there any problem?” Demarco demands.
Stacy hit the emergency button as Sherlock flat lined. Staff seemed to appear out of the walls pushing him and John back as they flattened Sherlock onto his back and being mindful of his injuries started CPR.
He had been walking around in a skin that no longer belonged to him, that no long felt right. Everything was wrong and he wanted out.
"Since you pointed out that thinking can be loud, and you are the loudest thinker I have ever met."
Four hours passed, in that time someone had come to speak to Mycroft twice, both times giving reassures that everything was being done to save his brother.
“More than one word, will done.”
"I asked him to My." Sherlock watched his brother's features soften at the use of his shortened name, something Sherlock hadn’t used in a very long time.
Sherlock was pacing, phone in hand while he had another phone at his ear.
Sherlock laughed at that as he brushed away tears.
"You took the hit on the front didn't you?" The man blinked once. "You are currently stemming what ever bleeding you have by keeping yourself pinned to the floor." Again the man blinked once.
“Moriarty.”
“What are you going to do about it?”
Doctor Ansari had arrived just as John said this.
"What did I take from John?"
"Mary." The blonde supplied with a smile.
"Let him in."
“Remove explosive bolts one through six in counter clock-wise sequence.” Monk reads out.
"Everyone I know will die too."
John paced.
"She-" coughing the man winced and once he was done blood slatted his chin and hand. Lying back he looked at his hand for a moment before looking back to John. "Sherlock."
Sherlock growled as he moved his hand knowing that his physical body also moved, but when no feeling of being touched upon said hand was felt he knew it had been missed.
"Probably for the best." John muttered.
“Okay, what was the last thing you remember?” John asked as he looked back down at Sherlock. John stared as the man looked up at him, those pale eyes searching, as though he was trying to read John’s very soul.
They left him alone, left him with Sherlock, never once asked for him to leave, didn’t even try to get him to move away as they took Sherlock’s stats. He didn’t once leave, only to use the adjoining bathroom, nothing more.
"So no forcing each other to say things." Sherlock says with a nod.
John turned to slowly look at her.
John watched him fall.
"Yeah?" John askes with a laugh.
“I…oh god it hurts!”
Sherlock could clearly hear the frustration, the anger in John's voice. He knew if John looked at him now he would also see it written all over his face, after all, John was an open book. Or so Sherlock had thought.
"It has to be said. Your life depended on what I did that day and I would have done anything to make sure you lived."
"No...I'm sorry. Silly games, no more?"
"And what would your next action be?"
The bandages came off easily, layer by layer the nurse removed the white fabric. This would be the first time he got to see the wound. He had been told about it, could feel it, but had never seen it.
Sherlock frowned. “I have all that?”
Sherlock laughed slightly. "William...no one calls me that."
"No John, I will always feel guilt for what I did, for what I put you through, just please let me look after you forever, then I can live with it all."
Sherlock was silent but he moved a little as though uncomfortable before finally speaking.
"Oh." John looked at Sherlock them smiled. "Always protecting me."
Sherlock turned his head to Mycroft, those eyes of his searching over his face and causing Mycroft to smile.
Pushing off the wall he made his way down to the café, his thoughts muddling through everything before falling back onto Sherlock, to soft curls and pale skin, to the thought that the kiss his had just given the man might very well be the last.
"You, here, on the stairs. The last time we were here together we both ended up running from the police."
They slept, it wasn't even tea time when they finally stopped talking and the emotion of the day caught up with them sending them both into a much needed sleep.
Now he was hiding, hiding from his past, from his fear, from his nightmare made flesh.
"Stop it." He finally said, turning away from John.
Sherlock’s breathing became erratic and then alarms started to sound as his heart rate accelerated and his oxygen intake decreased.
“I blew his brains out!”
"Where?"
"Sofa or bed?”
“Mycroft?”
"Sherlock...don't. Don't you dare!"
"My, my, I really did make you a work of art." Shivering as Morans hand ran over his back, tracing the scars he bit his lower lip to keep from protesting, protesting would only make it worse.
John held the magnifier over the strip of film Sherlock had placed over a pinball machine within the mess hall, using its light to help see the film more clearly. Frowning he glanced up at Sherlock before looking back down. The picture was darkness with a single line of light running through it. It could be anything, a dropped torched, a light flare as the picture was taken, but certainly not what Sherlock said it to be.
"Sherlock we are....well not exactly. We are about an hour from London."
John stood numb and not really seeing it all as the chaos moved around him, the smell of blood and antiseptic filling his nostrils but he didn't even notice it, just as he didn't take note of blood on the floor, of the people screaming as news of their loved ones not making it was broken to them.
"Yeah, I guess we do."
"Are you alone?"
John reacts first. "What? Why? When?"
This was the second time Lestrade had been able to visit, the first a week ago and it had gone well. At least Sherlock had thought it had gone well until that night he found John in the shower, curled up on the floor, his clothes still on and the water near to scalding. It had taken a day for John to come back to himself and Sherlock was lothed to have Lestrade visit again, but John had insisted and so they spent a few hours watching a game then after took a walk through the gardens.
Turning his head into Sherlock’s curls he smiled.
John blinked against the suddenly brightness turning his head to his arm, protecting his eyes as best he could before peeking out and allowing his vison to adjust.
"I know you want to use it, so all we need for you to do is stand, take all of three steps and it is all yours till you need to get back in the bed."
"I...I hope I didn't over step having all your stuff moved here."
"Indian! Definitely that."
"Agreed." Sherlock nodded as he ran his face against John's hair.
“I know,” John placed another kiss to Sherlock's head. “I love you.”
the drive out of London wasslow,,the traffic tedious, but they had left with plenty of time so there would be no chance of missing the appointment.
.~.~.~.~.
"My flashbacks are dangerous."
"Yes." Sherlock agreed.
Gold, small tiny flecks of golde  dust sprinkled as though by a child covered the greens and blues.
.~.~.~.~.
“Hello I’m Molly. Come play?” She asked looking over her shoulder at the other children who were all stood watching.
John continues to frown then looks at Sherlock and smiles.
Four men stood with guns pointing at the two of them and just behind them was another, this one well dressed, his blond hair artfully styled. Grey eyes watched the two of them for a moment then he sighed as he looked at the dead man on the floor.
"If Mycroft can help."
"No...I just know you."
Giving Dimmock a smile, John turned and made his way through the hatch.
"A four or five-year-old made it out...I let him go." John suddenly stood turning away from Sherlock as his hands delved into his hair gripping it tightly. "I never told anyone that, not even Harry."
"You of course did it the right way."
"Exactly."
Closing his eyes Sherlock tightened his grip on the man’s hand, hoping to translate that to his real hand.
The gun was pointed at John, John who was kelt with his hands tied behind his back. John, who he had been searching for. John, who he had loved forever, John, the one person he couldn't lose.
When word reached them that the plane had landed and they were on their way, the nerves kicked it. It was silly really, after all he had seen Sherlock a few times since the fall. But this was different, Sherlock was coming home, it was over, he had finished what needed to be done and he was on his way to see John.
“Jesus, Sherlock-“
John walked through the control room, towel in hand as Anderson sat at the mic, the only light coming from a single emergency lamp, the radar screen and an external camera screen that flicked threw images as it monitored around the rig.
"You stomach is rumbling." John said as Sherlock looked down at him with a raised eyebrow.
Sherlock's eyes drifted to his a small smile on his lips.
"Okay."
“Very well.” Mycroft turns to his brother, his hand taking Sherlock's for a second. “Rest well brother mine.”
"John?"
"Well his is huge. Corridor after corridor of rooms all holding different information."
Putting down he scotch he ran his hands through his hair a few times, a habit he had when trying to calm his racing heart and ranging emotions. He missed John, god did he miss him. Missed his smell, his laugh, his touch, his everything.
John was stood just inside the room leaning against the wall. He had left Dimmock in the care of Monk and Mike, while he stayed with Sherlock as Coffey spoke to him.
"No problem." They both held the others eyes until Sherlock nodded once and walked away.
"It's okay, you're okay, just breath."
They stared each other down, neither of them back down, the air filling quickly with tension.
Silence answered him, Mycroft was still there but he was still and no sound came down the line.
"I needed to see if he had regressed at all with it being just the two of you for so long. It would seem he has and for that I can only apologise. I should have kept up his therapy on that. But things progressed far to quickly with the two of you and unfortunately his haphephobia got put on the back burner."
“We need Flatbed to unhook the umbilical before the storm hits!” John shouted but Coffey just looked at him with a dead glare as they disappeared totally into the water.” Un-fucking-believable.”
"Not this time." Sherlock confessed softly, something John knew was hard for him to admit. Something had happened and Sherlock had no way of predicting it of stopping it and that was something Sherlock will never easily admit to.
“What! Seriously! Come on John what else could it be?
Who was he with?
Sherlock felt tears stinging his eyes but he ignored them as he took John's face in his hands and kissed him, this time with such tenderness that it hardly equated to a kiss at all, but it was what this situation called for, that quiet comfort and simple contact that meant John was not alone anymore.
"What things?" he asked sternly and she couldn't help but shiver at the command in his tone.
"John, please." Sherlock looked on the verg of tears, his eyes glistened with unshed tears, his hands shook, his chest heaved. "Please don't make-"
“Okay, that’s good.”
Right, so this story is basically a learning curve for me. The way this has been written is I found the script for the Abyss and I'm editing it to fit around the charters from Sherlock. It is a lesson in editing for me, something I'm not that great at doing, but it has been fun and will be seeing it through to the end.
John stared openly, his eyes showing that same awe they always show when Sherlock is being clever.
So this is to everyone that has waited so patiently for this update, I am sorry to keep you waiting for so long, I hope this makes up for it, or if not then the hopefully the next chapter will ;)
With that thought, he made his way to one of the two bedrooms, he would at least try to sleep. After all, even if he had an hour before the nightmares began that would be something.
"You have new scars." John muttered as he ran his thumb over a white line running over the back of Sherlock’s hand.
"I was protecting John." He finally said as he opened his eyes.
“What if he lied John?” Greg asked quietly.
“Leave.”
"You know exactly what I'm doing Sherlock."
"Oh, do one, Mycroft." Sherlock said as he blushed ever so slightly.
"I know, Cathy was just explaining. She thought this was some sort of waking flashback, but I'm not so sure."
“All I do is sleep.”
"Painkillers?",
“Fuck.” John hisses pulling himself through the door and head after Sherlock. “‘Lock, stop!”
The soft nature of her face suddenly turned and Sherlock braced himself. "Because it's the only explanation I can come up with to why you came down here!" She suddenly hit his arm. "You and John are going to kill each other within a day!"
(2:22am) Sleeping is for the weak. Besides my head wont shut down! I...Harry didn't stay long, she tried to hug me and well I let her then didn't speak. I dont really remember what happened, what was said, Cathy said I blanked out. I haven't done that in weeks Sherlock because you...no...sorry...I wont blame you for this. I need to learn to deal with this alone. JW
"No, you have triggered all this and I believe you can help bring him out. But not right away. So for now he is being transferred to a hospital outside of London, it is a high security hospital. It is located in a old manor house and it is more like a home than what you see around you now."
"Do it, I don't want him to suffer because I was too afraid to see him in pain again."
"Sherlock, this place is my home." John says causing Sherlock to look at him with startled eyes. "At least it is at this moment in time. Be nice to those that work here."
So now the question was, what would happen if John closed the gap?
"That's good. What could help keep you grounded?"
Breathing steadily through his nose, he just watches as the two men dealing with Sherlock wrapped black nylon rope around his ankles and wrists then lift his arms over his head so that he is totally stretched out on the floor.
"Yeah."
"Don't." John warned.
The two fell fell into laughing again, John cluching at Sherlock’s arm as he lent against his shoulder while Sherlock lent back aginst the sofa, his head tilted back as he laughed.
“Don’t! Don’t ever call me that, not ever!” John hisses.
Crystal eyes opened, freeing a few tears as they did so, and just looked at John as though he was everything.
"Well done John." Sherlock said as his eyes shone with the high of a new, rather baffling case.
"Thank you John...for...well for all of this."
Molly hummed quietly to herself as Beany sat on her shoulder while she controlled Big Geek, the bigger badder brother to Little Geek. As she moved it around the rig she paused then turned the small water drone back and then had it hoover as it looked into the rooms taken up by the Marines. Coffey and Schoenick where stood opposite each other, with Coffey’s back to the window.
"John-"
John was asleep when they deemed Sherlock strong enough to go back in.
Jim slowly undid his jacket pulling it from his arms and throwing it Christen, he then undid his shirt cuffs and rolled the sleeves up his arms.
“So, no one to look out for you.”
"Tell me about Harris."
"Hey, thanks." John let himself fall onto the floor, his back braced against the wall.
However, waking after an overdose and slit wrists was not an experience he ever thought he would face, afterall he thought he would die, wanted to die because he just couldn't anymore. Couldn't function, couldn't feel, couldn't human.
John looked good, he was in a well cut suit in a navy blue colour, with a white crisp shirt and a deep grey tie.
John sighed and let himself fall forward till his head rested against Sherlock’s shoulder. Breathing for a time he let Sherlock wrap his arms around him, pulling him closer as his fingers stroked gently down his back.
Sherlock was busy taking Coffey's pictures when the lights started to dim within the cab and power flickered in and off before the spot lights outside dimmed completely.
“Oh god.” John stepped forward taking Sherlock from Mycroft, a move Sherlock seemed to appreciate as he wrapped his arms around John and just held him.
He had been five.
.~.~.~.~.
“What are you doing?” Molly asked leaning in closer to the screen.
"Why did you come back?"
"John." Sherlock stood his hand once again hovering but not touching, but then he wouldn't touch, because he wasnt real.
"Yeah...but then it always is, we just somehow find a way out of it."
John pulled his arms free taking a step back and for a moment Sherlock just watched as a thousand emotions ran across John's face and eyes before the shutters came down and the ex-solider that could face anything stood before him.
Leaning his head back on the stretcher he let his eyes close and just concentrated on his breathing.
"Danger follows you, it shrouds you and i see that, I want that. But now it is not why I stay, it's not even why I had to find you after the explosion. I stay because in less than five seconds I knew I had found what I have always been searching for."
“I’m staying here tonight, if you want to join me after your meeting then do so. If you can’t then I will see you again, possible when this is all over, but hopefully it will be tonight, room four two six.”
Getting in was easy. Sherlock heard John’s sigh as he looked around, and frowned at the stairs.
"Sherlock may be my patient, but by extension so are you. So go, sleep, he won’t be going anywhere."
Anyways enjoy :) x x
"Mycroft was bluffing." Sherlock’s eyes rolled as he spoke. "Besides he needs me too much to allow me to be gone for so long."
He had it for nearly two years.
Sherlock nodded, a smile on his lips which again did strange things to John's stomach and had him near enough running for the bathroom.
"Okay, just tell me if you need me to come back."
Normally Sherlock would have nodded his understanding, but he just grunted instead as John manoeuvred him until his arm rested over John’s shoulder. As they approached the stairs, John circled his free arm around Sherlock’s waist.
"Right, because everyone would spend an hour with their hand in someone’s gut for no reason what so ever. You're right, you’re not at all special." She winked at him as the elevator door opened and she stepped out leading him back down to ICU.
Yes! Of course.
“Okay that is good, really good.” The voice was happy, hopeful, but it was also starting to fade. “Can you op…”
The two men continued to work as Molly kept moving Big Geek trying hard to get just a glimpse of what they were up to.
"He's alive John."
His words seemed to unlock Sherlock’s movements because in seconds he hand gone from still to grabbing John and pulling him onto his lap so that John straddle his legs.
"I thought I got rid of you." Sherlock muttered and turned back to the wall.
Just thought I would put that, yes I know John is very OOC in this. I normally have John as the strong one of the two, not so much in this. So bare with, because this is going to be a journey for both our men and it wont be easy x x
"I think for today we need to establish some rules."
“Yeah, we were just leaving.” John answers grabbing Sherlock by the arm and pulling him out into the corridor and then heading towards the control room, the rest of the crew following close behind.
John listened with a smile as his crew sang, at least the guys had kept their moral up, saw the adventure in what they were doing even if he could read their worried looks when they thought he couldn’t see.
"Harry?"
Molly picked up a canister containing a pink transparent liquid.
Seven divers ride the back of Flatbed like workers on the way to the fields. John and his civilian crew, Dimmock, and Steven, sit across from the marines.
"Because you would have said yes to what ever kept him alive. But now, because you are a doctor, you will find yourself thinking rather than reacting."
"Sherlock...now," John paused as he took his own steadying breath. "Now might not be a good time, but I will answer what I can, what I feel needs answering."
As he turned onto Bakerstreet he again adjusted his grip, his eyes casting downward for a second. When he looked back up he stopped dead, his grip loosening causing his shopping to fall, the bags spilling everywhere and those around just stared and walked round, not a single person stopping to help.
"Because I get trapped."
“Separation sequencer disconnected. Next?” Wilhite asks.
"He didn't do it on purpose." Sherlock said as he sat up but sat up, close to John, taking the pictures from his hands. "Moran never asked, he never made it easy and he most definitely never made me feel safe. He took what he wanted when he wanted, how ever he wanted." He stared down at the photos, the images a contrast to the man he knew. In the pictures the man was clean cut, well dressed in a tailored suit and dress coat. He was a far cry from the man with days old stubble, dirt covered jeans and messed up hair that Sherlock remembered. But it was still him and he was surprised it had taken so long to have a reaction to Moran being so close once again.
"He's going to wake up in a moment." This came from John. "You should be there when he does."
Keeping her hand still she watched Sherlocks face, the slight frown of pain, yet the pleasure of it all so clear on his face.
The door suddenly opened as Anthea walked in, followed my Mycroft holding up a very tired and injured Sherlock.
"Okay, so you think you will be okay without me for a while?"
“John?” Mary walked back in, but John kept his eyes on Sherlock.
"John, you need to sleep." Mary was still crouched before him. "How about I fetch you another tea, some toast as well as some blankets. You can sleep here and no one will disturb you until you wake or Sherlock wakes."
John saw the glimmer of hurt that word caused before stepping back away from the mic and heading down another hall.
"Easier said than done when you expect my crew to go down to that sub with you."
"I...sorry, I should have seen it, should have known."
"What have I told you about that word? You are still mine Sherlock."
"Yes," she nodded. "Oh god yes!"
“I don’t know.”
Looking down at the body before him, he let his eyes run over the fully clothed form searching out for an clue as to the cause of death, hoping that his skill as a doctor hadnt completely gone after nearly three years of disuse.
"Yes, for as long as you will want me here." After pulling off his coat and gloves he made his way into the kitchen, always keeping to John's five foot circle that he placed around himself.
"He told you he did that. That he just rang to hear your voice, but you didnt listen! You where so caught up with wanting a message that you never really listened to them! He...he..." Mycroft shook his head, his eyes closing. "I wont say it for him, but you know how he feels, now sort it!"
Getting into the flat they both headed for the bathroom, grabbing towels and stripping off their soaked clothing.
A call to Lastrade and a trip to bart's confirmed the blood to be Sherlock’s.
"Thanks."
Cathy looked up her yes narrowing as she took in Mycroft stance.
"We need to get him back to the rig, now!"
“Shh.” John pushed himself up off the wheelchair wincing slightly but not allowing his pain to stop him. As he moved onto Sherlock’s bed he gently reached out and brushed back a few strands of dark hair before leaning forward and pressing their foreheads together.
"John." Sherlock shifted and turned to face John for the first time.
John then moved, pinning Sherlock to the bed, a wide smile on his face.
"No." John turned back, concern clear on his face.
"I know Sherlock. So lets try to fix it."
"I...god." Sherlock hissed leaning down to hide his face in John's neck. "I want to be...tell me no if you dont want to...but I need to be in you John."
“Sofa is fine,” Sherlock said, once again trusting John to guide him.
"John, you are being held under the mental health act." This was Sherlock, causing John to growl.
"Okay, we will set up everything here." The lead officer said with a slight smile.
"Your turn sweet cheeks."
"Why?"
"No, you got snippets of his life, a small amount of information about what was going on."
“What? No!”
The sound of the door opening caused John to look up and blink a few times as light brighter than what was in the room flooded in, then a silhouette blocked it and Lestrade was there.
John thought, He was pretty sure that Sherlock was bleeding internally, it was the only thing that could cause Sherlock to continue to get worse. If he had his bag he could do more, possible find the bleeding, give painkillers and just do more than plug the wound with his fingers.
"Austin Craver."
Before him, in a crouched position, was a man with short dark hair and deep brown eyes. He was dressed in a well cut suit and a smile lit his young face.
"I wouldn't object John, and I will only do as you ask."
Sherlock stared wide eyed at his brother.
"Right...bye Greg." John muttered then turned, walking away.
"Hold on to something." He warned and released the cab into the water.
"Right well then I guess they are your crew, for now."
Behind him he could hear people talking, could here the excitement, could feel the joy as the person they had been searching for reached the little base they had set up.
"It has been quite a day." Sherlock said quietly.
“He's not in a coma, we know this from before, from when you pointed it out.”
The shower had been refreshing and as he shaved away his months old beard he really couldn't belive how much he had changed. It had been so long since he had been able to really look at himself, the last had been over a year ago, when he had to sew up a cut on his forehead. Since then he had recived a few more cuts but most were superficial and had healed without aid, some were a little deeper and had caused scaring. He also looked thinner, his normally pale skin more grey than anything, but that he put down to stress and tiredness. As for his hair, it was longer than he liked, but after a good wash he had been able to tame it a little.
“We already tried them, no signal.”
"What about John?" Mycroft looks at him and laughs slightly.
"I am resting. Coma remember?" Sherlock  glared at the man even as he felt himself becoming all the more tired.
"I can not leave John."
"Still lying to yourself I see. Tell me, when he touches you what really goes through your mind? Is his touch you can feel? Or is mine?" Moran had him pressed against the glass door leading to the patio.
"She loves it." Molly said taking the rat back and placing it on her head before shining a torch in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock forces himself to stay put, to lean against the counter and just stay.
"Love you too you madman." John replies with his cheeks still damp from tears. He leans down and ever so gently kisses the lips of the man he loves.
When she came to, John was kissing Sherlock and damn she wanted more of them. Grabbing at John she sat up kissing him hard, her tougue darting into his mouth the taste of herself still in his mouth.
“My sister, I better go.” John looked down at his picture then with a few more swipes to the ground he nodded and looked to the boy in the tree before dropping the stick and smiling at the others.
"Of course."
"Okay fine that was a bit stupid but its true!" John said with a smile.
John continued to look up then just started to walk again without looking back at Sherlock.
"Tuesday 28th at 2pm?"
"No...no hold on! Sherlock hold on!! I can't hold you, god please!" Sherlock felt himself slipping, felt as his arm slid in John's hand but he kept his eyes John’s blue tear filled eyes.
“He’s fine, I was able to find enough of the drug to make him stay out of it.” Lestrade’s eyes widened slightly at John’s words.
"Yes, but I'll tell them to leave." Sherlock answered as he lent up and pressed his face to the side of John's neck. "I'm so sorry John, I was going to tell you, I thought I had told you."
Sherlock works at the base of the wreckage, checking the valves on the rack of oxygen bottles still somehow clinging on to what was left. He was stood right on the edge of the canyon wall with nothing but darkness glaring up from the sheer drop behind him.
Sherlock didn't understand. He was crying, why was he crying? It was stupid and irrational and yet here he was, tears falling down his face as John spoke to him of love and promises and placing a ring on his finger.
John didn't get the chance to say bye. Sherlock had fallen unconscious while still in the train and hadn't regained consciousness since. It was a blessing that he couldn't feel the pain his body was going through, but John was a doctor, he knew that the reasons that led to a person losing conscious and Sherlock’s all led to blood loss.
John turned to her then his eyes wide with shock.
"Are you staying?" John questioned cautiously.
John laughed at that, a dark humourless laugh. “Have you even worked it out yet Greg?”
"No...you cant be here John, you need to go back to London."
"Sorry...sorry I didn't mean to frighten you. I left someone to come look for you. Told her I would be back to help."
"You git."
"Danger is addictive to me, but you Sherlock Holmes outweigh even the most dangerous of situations."
John paused for a moment before he looked up and smiled slightly.
Sherlock turned his attention back to Redbeard before he tried to move then hissed as his body protested.
“Yeah?”
"No, I can have my car take you and being you back if you like."
It had been three days since John had been put in with Sherlock. In that time Sebastian Moran had introduced himself to Sherlock, something John hated, he wanted Sherlock as far away from all of them as possible. But Moran was the one to take Sherlock to the bathroom as the man refused to have a catheter, but it meant Sherlock was taken from John and he really didn't like that.
“Then do what you did before.”
Sherlock held his eyes as he slowly led back onto the bed, the pain of such controlled movement evident in his eyes.
Felling Moran step back he slowly lifted his head and finally something snapped.
“Don’t touch that!”
"Thanks."
“You remember that?”
“No.”
“I remembered.”
A pale boy, around his age sat up in a tree, his legs dangling down, a book in his hands and his mope of curly black hair falling into his eyes as he read. John watched him closely, trying to work out how the boy had climbed as high as he had, and how he had done it with such a big book.
"But I do. I need to talk, I need to tell...someone."
"I got hurt in some god awful village, in the middle of nowhere, they didnt really have electicity so it was probably the darkest place I had ever been. I was stuck in a hut for about a week, but it had a hole in the roof so I spent most of my time just watching as the day turned to night and then back to day. I slept mostly in the day though, so come the night I could watch the moon. It was full on the fist night and as the week passed it changed, became smaller and smaller. I would imagine you watching the same moon and in that time it...it gave me comfort."
“Sure,” Sherlock lied.
Sherlock looks up as John comes to stand next to him, before turning back to the panel he is working on.
Sherlock sighed but allowed John to reattach the leads, moving his arms as commanded then sitting back and still as John put his nasal cannula back on. Once John was finished he found himself staring down at Sherlock who was just watching him intently.
"That is no concern Maddie, some of the field stitches I've applied have been a lot worse than that, they become badges of honour in the end." John let him self relax for a bit before slowly sitting up.
When Mary returned she placed the toast on the table as well as the new cup of tea, she then pulled out a bottle of water from her pocket and held out a small cup with two tiny pills inside.
Tears sprung up in his eyes fast and steady, ignoring them as the fell freely down his face to gather on the pillow.
Looking up from where he sat on the sofa, he took in the two brothers. Mycroft was in his three piece suit but the tie had been pulled at and the top button undone. Sherlock had no shirt, but white bandages where wrapped around him in an attempt to keep his wounds safe. John had done what he could, but he wanted Sherlock to go to hospital, soon, so that he could be stitched up properly.
Closing his eyes, he found himself bowering into John a long contented sigh escaping his lips.
"Did you have to kill my most skilled torturer?"
They stare at each other for a while before Sherlock turns back to his work.
They held each other’s eyes as the music started to replay, the violin filling the silence as they just looked.
"Before, why now."
John looked to Mycroft then up at the monitors. "How long have you been in pain?"
"I...I don't know if I can."
"Hi." John said, fighting the urge to put the phone down.
John had fallen asleep his head resting on his arms while his hand kept a hold of Sherlock’s. When he woke he was stiff and so sore that he cursed himself for not taking up Mycroft’s offer to sleep in a real bed.
"He's around." Moran said as he stopped and pushed open another door leading into a bathroom.
"Trust me love. Please, this is warm, safe, and I am right here."
"The rooms are like apartments." He said instead.
"But this is not about John."
"Course he does, ruddy bastard went and got himself some rich thing to scrounge of off."
"I know you dont like to be touched. So I apologise. But I didn't want you to hurt yourself." Sherlock slumped back in his chair. He looked tired, his emotions still on show though he had been able to cover most of them.
(Decided to write an epilogue so keep a look out for that x x)
"You have two weeks’ respite doctor Watson, then the fun can begin."
"It's okay." John placed a hand over Sherlock’s and squeezed it gently.
Listening he heard Sherlock lock the door then pick up two mugs, placing one on the table close to John and sitting down on the only arm chair.
"Cuddling is good." Sherlock said softly as he tightened his arms gently around John.
“Okay, hard part over.” Pulling and shifting his friend, John was able to get him to sit up allowing him to pull on the black jumper.
John rolled his shoulders, his fingers flexing as much as they could as he tried to keep hold of the heavy shopping bags in his grip.
"Yeah, the explosion, the screaming, you...you I remember in detail. From the moment you stepped onto the train...but you already know that."
“I saw it John, it was…it was the most beautiful thing I have seen. The light it produced was breath-taking and the mechanics of it, the way it moved, glided through the water. So unlike our own craft, so unlike this huge tin can. It was perfection John; it was everything I could dream of designing yet would have no idea where to start.” Pushing away from the wall Sherlock stood over John, something John had first hated about Sherlock but now he felt his heart rate increase as he looked up. “You know me John, you know me better than anyone. I could never make something like this up, hell if it was anyone else I would be telling them how stupid they sounded. But this is me John! Please, you have to…please.”
"You know what it is!" Sherlock accused his eyes wide and angry.
Greg ran a hand through his hair then nodded. “Let’s go.”
A hand landed softly on his forearm causing him to look down but seeing nothing.
"Really?"
Johns voice comes over the com "You should be almost to it, 'Lock."
Right, so this is a shorter chapter, but it is a bridge chapter to the next part of the story. Enjoy all the same :)
As the water moves back through the rig, Sherlock moves with it until turning off and heading up a ladder that led towards Coffey’s room. When they reached the room the water was already there, its head scanning the warhead.
“Well isn’t this a lovely picture.” A soft Irish voice whispered into the room.
Sherlock tightened his hand on John thigh, holding the leg up and against him as John canted his hips allowing Sherlock to slip in deeper, a moan leaving John’s lips as Sherlock went completely still.
"Possibly nine...there are another two over there." He nodded to the machines.
"Traitors don’t get put to the top of the list."
Closing his eyes, he pressed a kiss to John’s forehead and just let himself breath in the other man, letting his presence soothe him, even as he worked through what he had just remembered.
"Oh...oh John I am so sorry!" He whispered looking down at the still passed out doctor. John had tried to kill himself, he had also showed signs of stress just before passing out, stress linked to Sherlock’s fake suicid to Sherlock admitting he would have done it no matter what.
"Bolts." Sherlock’s eyes slid to the floor before he just let his eyes close and slump against the bars.
"Yet here I am, telling you I can and will wait. I thought this would never happen John, why would I push for it if it ended up pushing you away." Sherlock’s thumbs moved in small circles on his back, causing him to relax.
"Always looking after me." Sherlock said after drinking half the tea.
He shook his head slightly. "No..."
"She found John?"
“Bart’s, always Bart’s. But Mycroft wants you moved.” John whispered back, his eyes closed even as he gripped at the cotton t-shirt Sherlock wore.
"Yes." Cathy nodded as John glared at her. "Do you want to talk about what you said to me earlier?"
"I just spent nearly an hour with my hand plugging up his abdomen. I need to make sure he is okay."
“What was her name?” The Man asked as he came to stand at the other side of the window.
He couldn't believe he was leaving her, but he just couldn't stay and not look.
John glared then all the fight left him as he took in Sherlock’s wild hair, ripped salt stiff clothes, scraped hands and dirty bloody knees.
The needle found his neck, the sting of it making him hiss then darkness quickly took over and his found himself slumping against the person holding him.
"I'm sorry, so sorry." He hears John's voice shake then a hand presses firmly onto his abdomen. A scream rips its way out of his throat then blissful darkness takes him.
"Right...fine."
So now he was right back in that cell and he physically couldn't do anything, even as his mind continued to shout abuse at him.
"Leave." John whispered.
Leaning into the touch John let his eyes close before turning and kissing the ring upon Sherlock’s finger.
"Yes." John smiled, lowering the gun as Sherlock stood. "It worked."
"Because your skin is too tempting." As to prove a point John ran his lips over the pale skin on Sherlock's shoulder and neck.
The man Sherlock now knew as ‘John’ turned away, his body tense with anger.
The man smiled causing John to smile back.
John’s heart raced, his breathing ragged as he searched the water below.
"Lay down." Sherlock instructed, so she did, legs open, looking up at the two of them. Sherlock knelt between her legs, his fingers going to his mouth, as he wet his fingers she moaned lifting her hips, willing and wanting. When he was done, Sherlock found her folds and prodded gently till his finger found her entrence and pushed in. He finger fucked her for a moment before taking them out and laying over her, lining himself up and then pushing deep into her. Arching up to met him she closed her eyes and just allowed the feeling to wash over her.
"Mr Holmes?" Sherlock eyes closed as a female voice answered.
Watching himself step onto the train, the world around him brightened once again, adding people, detail, like the posters on the walls, the graffiti on the doors and the tatty covered seats. The people he had deduced stood out more than those he hadn’t, but they still had more substance, like the lady stood before him, long blond hair, pale skin, black trousers, red top, she had been boring and so Sherlock had simple ignored her, but still her basic features stood out.
"No John?" The question sliced through his heart causing him to close his eyes.
"No." Sherlock hissed and he felt Cathy tense next to him.
Sherlock nodded against his him before placing a soft closed mouth kiss to John's lips and taking his hand, then leading him through the gardens and back to the flat.
“No, no don’t do that.” Sherlock says shaking his head and holding his hand up as Molly doubts him. “Listen, I know you can make this drone go where ever you want it to go.”
"More sessions?"
John fell to his knees, his hands at Sherlock’s belt and trousers. Within a second John had Sherlock’s cock in his mouth and Sherlock had no choice but to hold on to whatever his hands could find, so John’s head had to do.
"Listen guys, lets just talk about this logically. Sherlock couldn't have pissed you all off this much, not enough to kill us."
When Moran entered the taller man raised an eyebrow at him.
"Is he..."
“Just…tell me again.”
John frowned and looked up, he needed to go, he needed to find Him.
“He went front-office on you.” Sally said as she nodded then turned back to her work before pointing up and handing John her wrench. “Tighten that for me, right there.” She said as she grabbed another tool.
"Yes it is. They took from you and it is perfectly normal to feel anger and loss for what they took."
"Right, gather round people." Coffey suddenly shouts out and everyone turns to him.
"Yeah." Sherlock nodded,  a look of want on his face.
John shifted off the bed as soon as Sherlock let loose a scream of pain, the room flooding with nurses and doctors instantly. Stepping back, he felt a hand steady him as he stumbled slightly, turning to find Greg holding him.
"Now that would be telling, and its nothing to worry you curly haired head about."
Pulling the shirt down over Sherlock’s head after helping with the arms John found himself staring up and into Sherlock’s unbelievable eyes, the colour of them still a total mystery to John even after all the years they had known one another.
Sherlock pushed himself closer to John, pushing his face against soft hair and warm skin. He breathed in the man's scent letting it take over all other senses for just a moment before breathing out and letting out a sigh.
"Well hi there Sherlock. Thought you were back in London."
"Yesterday was...stressful. With everything else that was going on I guess I just lost it."
"Suit yourself."
A lump he did not expect formed in his throat as he tried to form answer.
“As am I!” Jim said cheerily. “Now, what do we have here?”
“Why?” He asked his breath catching in pain.
After his day, after what he had done, he was tired, bone weary but he couldn’t sleep. Sherlock had passed out hours ago, his burst of energy drained quickly, his body’s need to rest quickly taking over and causing him to crash so hard John had been unable to get any reaction from him.
"I tried to kill myself."
Sally moved Flatbed easily through the water as though it is an extension of herself. The sub was her baby, she piloted it and she looked after it. Everything about it was hers and as she reached the top of the platform she manovoured it into place ready to set out the long arm to unhook the umbilical.
Now it was wasnt a matter of John minding this contract, no, in fact he longed for it. He missed it when it was gone, yearned for it when it had been a while since the last time, he even asked for it at times, not directly but asking Sherlock to look at something, anything that would just have that tall warm body press up behind him.
"No."
"Stop...stop Sherlock, just...here." He pushed Sherlock back before reaching for the bottom of his own shirt and pulling it up over his head. Sherlock quick caught on and soon they were both blissfully naked.
Sitting back in his chair he waits for Anderson to get back before heading down to the moonpool.
John allowed Mycroft to go first, falling in behind him as they made their way to the ICU.
Mike cuts the hose as Anderson wedges a crowbar into the gap his ring was keeping open leaning on it as the door stops trying to close now its power has been cut. Mike joins in while John pulls with both his hand’s helping in the effort to save him.
Cathy sighed shaking her head. "I know I'm going to regret this."
"Good." The kiss that followed was so full of emotion, a story of the feelings running through the two men, a tale of everything they had been through and of everything still to come.
Dull light filtered through the closed heavy curtains of the bedroom. It informed its occupier that a new day had started but John just stared at the wall, his eye's blinking slowly as he replayed one of their days, the day at the theme park, with the wet shirt and blue slushy. He liked that day, he had turned fifteen and Sherlock had been there, it had been their second day.
Sherlock tries to talk, tries to make John listen, but John has shut down.
He thought back to his panic attack earlier, trying to place the cause, the reasoning behind it. He knew he had taken on a lot when he had agreed to oversee Sherlock’s care, something he had been willing to do, something he needed to do. But now thing had progressed between them, John had fallen hard for the man, and because of that, Sherlock’s fear at John leaving him, just to get a coffee had triggered something in John; he was just as afraid to leave Sherlock. That was why he had panicked, why he had to get back to Sherlock straight away and why he slept in chair not really built for sleep rather than taking the bed that was offered to him every night.
They kissed again, this time slowly, lovingly. Until Sherlock pulled back placed a kissed to John's forehead and muttered a few words before leaving as the car came to a stop once again.
Cathy for her part just kept smiling. This was a session were she would name a topic then sit and listen. Today she had given the topic of cases. They could talk about any case they liked and before long John had started to giggle and they soon started going through all the funnier moments they had been through.
"That was...how did you know all that?"
"You need to let go."
“How did you guess the link?” John asked at which Sherlock looked to Mycroft.
“Yeah, at least that you remember.” John whispered.
Slowly, with the help of Maddie, John re-wrapped Sherlock’s chest and abdomen. He had Sherlock lent against him with the curly head resting on his shoulder, while Maddie did most of the wrapping.
"Do you find anything of me unappealing?" John asked, standing up straight, his eyes hard and defensive.
“So, how far?” John asked.
He was being watched, they both were and with that John closed his eyes and slowly crouched down to begin gathering his shopping. Picking up his bags he started to fill them once again until one item remained. Reaching out he went to grab it when another hand picked it up.
"Just keep everything to how we have them." John said quietly as he stopped next to Anderson.
"Right...thank you."
John laughs again, which turns to sobs of sadness, joy, who the fuck knows what, just too much emotion. "Git." He replies fondly.
"I...it's family only I'm afraid."
"No, why should I?" He asked is a small voice.
“Who are you?” A small voice asked causing John to look down and smile as a small girl with mousy brown hair and big green eyes looked up at him.
Once Moran had the belt free he pulled back on the knife and quickly turned Sherlock till he was facing the wall.
"Yeah...give me ten minutes to shower and dress."
Sherlock was still asleep, his legs twisted in the sheets, his hands clasped above his head, his face twisted into a snarl and a hiss escaping his lips as he twisted as though trying to escape something.
"Right." John was watching their linked hands.
"Leave, don’t bother coming back." Mycroft glared down at John. "Now."
By the time they returned home it was close to five in the morning.
"Stop."
“Yes.”
"That it will be more active than your typical coma patient."
"What the hell John? Its a fucking killing field out there!" Greg said as he made his way to the two on the ground his eyes taking in the other four dead men before really looking at John and Sherlock. "Holy crap!"
“Very well.” Mycroft says with a nod. “I will see to it done, by the end of the day, Austin Carver will no longer exist.”
so enjoy and please, as always, let me know what you think?
"I'm turning off now Sherlock."
John pushes past Molly, grabbing the mike and calling up to the Explorer.
The search was cut to the life boat, the helicopter having to head back to refuel, the promise that it would return heard over the radio John had insisted upon having.
Laughing, Sherlock is stunned at what he sees, a smile plastering itself across his face which the water mirrors so Sherlock sticks out his tongue, again the water copies sending a thrill of excitement through Sherlock’s body.
"Huh umm." John stopped kissing but only pulled back slightly. Opening his eyes Sherlock stilled to find John looking right at him with eyes dark with passion yet alight with so much emotion that Sherlock was afraid he would drown.
Carrying on down the corridor he heads to the control room where he find’s Sherlock knee deep in water, tools everywhere, grease and oil covering his hands and face, shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbow and a look of concentration on his face.
“Whose then? Sherlock? Talk to me...” John nearly begs as he moves even closer.
"Then forever you shall have."
"Yeah, it is a pretty good feeling." Standing John moves the small table closer to Sherlock so he can easily reach the computer before moving all the IV bags and monitors so he could re-hook Sherlock to everything.
"It's okay John." Sherlock finally whispered, his hands moving up from John's hips up his sides and stopping on his back. "We dont have to do anything."
“Humm?”
"But John has yet to forgive himself." Cathy stated.
He felt sick, he was exhusted and his head was killing him.
"Yes."
“Yes doctor.”
"Easy brother mine."
He's eyes never left John.
As the train stopped at the next station people flooded off and John took the first chance to grab an empty seat, his leg thanking him as he took his weight from it. Relaxing slightly he looked up and down the cab as people filed on, squeezing into ever space available. It was then that he saw him, the man with the dark curls, with clear crystal eyes,  and skin so pale it almost glowed against the dark material of his coat.
“Then I will make him pay.”
"Everything."
"Sherlock!"
"Time is it?" He mumble.
"No...it's not." John looked to Maddie then to Sherlock’s drip. Maddie didn't need any more instruction, she quietly moved out of Sherlock’s line of sight and prepared a sedative.
As they reached Baker Street, Sherlock indicated where to go and John guided him to the black door.
Ari frowned, then sighed as she lowered her head. "I can't stay in a relationship that won't last John, what we have going now is good, it's fun, but it's not a commitment."
The man looked at John then down at Sherlock who had closed his eyes again.
"I...they...where did they go?" He suddenly panicked remembering that not minutes ago his captors had been with them. Now only John and Cathy remained.
The morning moved slowly.
"I'm so sorry for before."
"That is probably the most graceful I have ever seen you." Sherlock said with a hint of a smile to his voice.
"You said I would never be able to get you to beg, you begged, So I win."
"Just..." John stared as a sob escaped his lips. "Just don't do it again! Please Sherlock, I couldn't be without you, not agian."
"Right." Lestrade nodded as both John and Sherlock stood. "Any ideas?"
.~.~.~.~.
"I wish I could say it's an inconvenience, but I don't think I would want to be anywhere else. So you are welcome."
“Cab Three, check. Right behind you." Mike answers keeping close but in full control.
Looking up at the damn lights and blowing out a cloud of cigarette smoke, Sherlock sighed as he leaned against the cold brick wall. Early December had arrived with a chill that threatened snow, adding another layer to his already deep annoyance. He really hated this time of year.
He knew he felt the way he did due to being put out with a sedative,  he just couldn't remember why he had needed to be sedated in the first place.
Hefting his bag a little higher on his shoulder, Sherlock looked up at the Christmas lights again, and sighed. Soon the shops would remain open longer, the evening shift would become busier and he’d have to interact more frequently with people. He grimaced at the thought. Sure he got on with Molly, but she was smart, something they both had in common, and though she was a little quirky, they got on well. She had a crush on him, but she never let it get in the way of their friendship. Molly was the only person he didn’t rub up the wrong way, and she was his only friend.
“I know, I just…I need to keep trying.”
Cathy held John's eyes then turned to Sherlock.
"Not your fault mate, I would have done the same if my partner was injured." The paramedic offered, which caused John to open his eyes and stare a moment.
"Course it does."
"Do you feel the same?" She asked as she came and sat next to the two of them, so that she was at eye level with Sherlock.
“John?”
With a sigh Sherlock lowered his hands and slowly opened his eyes. The sun was setting casting the flat into shadows yet adding a golden light that Sherlock hated, it reminded him too much of golden hair and blue eyes.
"Hello John, it's good to see you awake."
"Coming from the man who-" John stopped himself. He knew something had happened to Sherlock while he was away, knew he had been hurt, tortured and where there was tortured he knew there could be more. "You have no patience Sherlock, you never have."
“Sherlock.” John lifted his head as Doctor Ansari appeared. “I’m your doctor, it’s good to see you awake, but as I’m sure John has already told you, we need to put you back under.”
John tried to process this, to wrap his head around it. He really had chosen a man that attracted danger, he just never realised just how dangerous.
“Holy…damn.” She muttered hitting record as they attached something to what was clearly a war head, a warhead that seemed to getting an upgrade of some sort.
“I understand that, I really do, it’s just…I’m fighting with myself here John.”
"In a bad way."
The nurse smiled. “It’s my job doctor Watson, really I should be thanking you.”
"That is not John." Sherlock gets out as he concentrates on his breathing.
“John…”
"Yes." The man studied him closely before shrugging. "I'm sure it's fine, all fine."
“That was different, that was me trying to save your life. I saved it, now I’m trying to keep you comfortable, to keep you here.” He felt his breath catching as tears threatened. “You remember that?”
"The coma is to help you body heal without the interference of your higher brain function. But you still need to rest your brain, so come on, to bed with you." The man led him down the hall, passing a few doors till reaching the door that led to an exact replica of Sherlock’s bedroom at his mothers house.
"Okay, so what is the plan?" Sherlock asks.
"I get it."
“I'm not taking anything to sleep, he might wake up.”
"Easy." A woman (he looked at her a moment, John's therapists, his mind slowly provided) was stood right next to him watching him closely. "We should go in."
"You have Sherlock?" He asked panic clear in his voice.
"Of course I will." John frowned slightly.
“What is that?” John asked, his knuckles whitening as his grip increased on the bars.
"We'll take reading as we go. If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away. Simple." Coffey said his eyes still glued to the map before them.
“John?” Doctor Ansari asked as he walked through the door.
"Then lets go catch us a murder." Sherlock said cheerful causing another chuckle from John as they both left the crime scene.
"Check this out." He drops Beany in the box and, before Molly can protest, closes the lid. Beany is forced under the surface. She struggles for a second, and then bubbles come out of her mouth. After a moment she casually starts to swims around in the liquid, completely submerged, breathing it all in. Mike and the others stare into the box, amazed.
John looked at Sherlock, shocked at the compassion he seemed to be giving Maddie.
Stepping out into the hall he slowly made his way to the end, looking through doors as he went till he spotted Cathy talking to Mycroft.
"Maddie?" He asked without looking at her.
"Yes you will. I need to hold back the painkillers; I need to save as much as possible so that when the time comes I can give you as much as I can without it knocking you out. I need you to walk out of here and it will happen."
John kept hold of Sherlock’s hand his eyes not leaving the pale face. When Sherlock looked back to him he was surprised when the hand he held pulled him down some more until John had to place his free hand on the pillow and he was inches away from Sherlock’s face.
(9:25am) This new phone is a bit complicated. JW
They stared at each other for a minute then Sherlock nodded. "Thanks."
"He hasn't woken yet. You should get some rest...a shower, shave, even a hair cut."
"His heart rate is dropping!"
"Remind me though, not to ask her to make tea for me again, this is dreadful."
“You sure about this John?” Lestrade asked as John pulled on the jacket.
"So they want me to talk. No idea what I am to talk about but here I am talking." A sigh. "I don't know what this is accomplish." This clearly not to Sherlock but to whoever is with John.
"Moriarty."
"Okay, so first thing?" She asked looking down at John.
"This is stupid." Sherlock muttered.
"John." He said louder pushing himself from the tiles. "John?"
“Sherlock, you are high, you don’t know what you are asking.”
"What? You mean like you? Running off into danger without even informing me!"
“Well?” John asked.
John continued to stare, his breathing slow and steady. He was at a cross roads, make Sherlock leave or let him stay. He knew what the easiest move was, let him stay, forgive him. But if he did that then John was sure they would never get pass it all, never be able to have a future because John would never forgive him, not fully. So best to end it now.
"Sherlock?" John's voice was soft, as soft as the fingers now in his hair.
“Do you know him?” John asked, concern in his voice.
"John." He moaned as the lips ran over one of the longer scars on his back, the remembered pain slowly being erased by the soft loving kisses John gave it.
"Thanks Mary." With that Ansari led John to the family room and left him to himself.
“We should come back here.” John looked up using the window to look behind him. Sherlock was lent against the door, still dressed in the black suit he had been wearing before, and looking amazing.
"What?"
"Since when have you been able to hear me think?"
Hope the jump around with the time line is not too confusing x x
“Very well. Then we can just sit here and wait.” Mycroft went back to his phone, typing away as John finally pulled himself away from dark curls to pull another chair closer to the bed, the small movement of Sherlock’s fingers missed by everyone.
“Just, leave him, he knows now what he is up against with you and I think as long as you both stay clear of each other then it would be best for all involved.”
Anyways, this is not going to be forgotten, it will be completed just need to give me time. I don't have an update schedule, but I will try to at least get a chapter up once a month.
What the fuck?  How was John here? John was in London, safe, sad, lost but safe.
"My boss is a bit pissed off, he wants to make sure you and Sherlock get what's coming to you."
“Well excuse me!” Molly said holding her hands up and stepping away.
John looked down then noting that what he thought was a blanket was in fact Sherlock coat.
"No...not this. I will keep him alive, I will say yes to what ever keeps him here, but I  will not decided on this. He is your brother Mycroft! You have more say in this than I do!"
"You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?" Mike asked coming over to have a look.
The speech had been good, people listened to him, they reacted to his stories and the follow up questions had been good giving further detail to what he had done. It had been good to talk about his time as an army doctor, good to talk to people that understood what he had been through.
"My...” Sherlock sighed and took a few breaths before starting again. “I can't think John. My mind has rebelled and I cannot think!"
"She is under the same condition as you and Sherlock. No harm is to come to her." Moran's tone was bored, but John believed him.
"Yeah, I did." John replied easily.
Bitting his lower lip he turned and looked to Cathy 's office, the door was open. Making his way over he saw Cathy talking to another patient, but she clocked John instantly.
"Right, so not being cryptic and mysterious at all then." John said with a sigh.
"Forever...I want you forever."
“Of course not.” Sherlock hissed, then shifted, his head pushing back against the pillow. “John.”
John showered four times before finally going to bed. But he didn't sleep.
“I…I think so. You see I have an enemy of sorts.”
“I think he can hear you.” John said looking back to Philip. “And if that’s true, about his parents, then he’s not a freak, he’s sad.”
“Jesus.” Greg ran a hand through his hair as he looked across at John. “How did you escape?”
"Wait." John said turning to Maddie. "You need to go, it’s been days."
"I’ll just go get a coffee." John suddenly said but before he could move off Sherlock had his wrist in a vice like grip. Panic suddenly overcame him and he just couldn't allow John to leave.
"No! No dont!" John took a few steps forward raising his own gun. "One more move and I will blow your bosses brains out. Both of the men raised their gun's to John,  a situation he liked a lot more because a gun wasn't aimed at Sherlock.
"Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving. We're on a tight timeline."
Today Cathy had gotten him to open up about John messages. About what they ment for Sherlock, about how he clung to them, especially after he had escaped.
Gently he ran his hand through tangled curls and lent down to talk to his friend.
"Yes."
"I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive."
“No…please…” Sherlock pleaded quietly his deep voice broken with fear.
She nods but he doesn't understand why.
Waking, Ari found herself half on John, her legs tangled with Sherlock as he led on her back. She was basically the middle of a very hot sweaty sandwich, she really could think of worse things.
Greg stumbles as he tried to keep upright as he shouts orders to his men, or at least tries to as waves hit the Explorer and the wind throws the ship about as though it was a ragdoll.
"I'll be fine. Come on."
“I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.” He works with a wrench, John simply watching as the man that still was his husband worked on the thing he created knowing that right now all of Sherlock’s focus would be on doing what he could to save those still alive.
"Bloody hell John!" she hissed glaring at him. He smiled walking up to her and pulling her into his arms
The lights flickered above him showing him torn apart body parts and burnt skin, it also showed blood and so much more that he really didn't want to think about it and it was only because of his training that kept him from running in the opposite direction.
Sighing, John let go of Sherlock allowing the man to remove his hand but also allowing John to turn and bury his face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck.
"Right." John nodded as he let out a breath. "Just umm, just stay there, dont move, dont flinch."
This is especially for AlwaysJohn x x
.~.~.~.~.
"John...John don't, don't! Just...fuck, John just let me go!"
"Okay...that’s a bit...flattering." John smiled as Sherlock tilted his head at him.
"Pleasure." Sherlock said with a smile before his eyes fluttered close.
Sherlock snapped his head around to the man. "Coma?"
“Like what?”
Rushing through the flat he unlocked the door throwing it open to find Cathy and two ordarlies with concerned looks on their faces.
"Resting." He was able to force out, the effort of just saying that one word a massive drain on his reserved energy.
"No!" John screamed and dashed through the crowed that was heading away from the fire.
"I'm fine."
.~.~.~.~.
He paused watching Greg carefully, reading his face, his reactions. “Mycroft Holmes knows exactly who I am, what I am capable of. The first time I met him he basically had me cleared of all past mistakes, faked a lot of my background, officially had Harry made my sister, issued me a firearm, begged me to look after Sherlock, even offered me payment, I refused that. But I took my role as Sherlock’s protector seriously.” John looked to the door they stood at his face hardening once again.
The tears John had been holding back broke free then and he let them fall silently.
That was his brother, his baby brother. Nine months ago he had pulled him from that dump of a drug den, skin and bone, high as a kite and so damn filthy Mycroft hardly recognised him. It had taken a week to get any sense out of him, then another month to finally convince Sherlock to go to the best rehab centre in Europe.
John huffed out a laugh. "Never heard of that being a feeling before."
"Of course. You can do whatever you want here."
"John?"
"Care to look?"
“I work with the police, on cases, I help them when they are out of their depth, which just happens to be always. Anyway, I also take on private cases, they pay the bills but they are boring, sometimes not even worth my time. But as I said they pay the bills.” Sherlock looks at the screen, at the man. “About two months ago I was contacted by someone that had, for a lack of a better term, started a game. He left me clues to cases and I solved them in the time frame he gave me.”
"You were mourning John, your thought process not right. You can be forgiven for not realising. As for me, I was stupid. But I couldn't risk them knowing or finding out because they would have gotten to you before I could have."
Licking his lips, Sherlock pulled his phone from his pocket. After a few seconds he switch on his speaker and waited.
Sherlock jumped back onto the bed and just watched John as he continued to laugh.
"She is mad at me, but only on your behalf."
"John, can you stay with us?" She asked gently. She could see how close the ex soilder was to running, to closing off once again.
“John- “
John lets out a breath, closing his eyes and trying hard to control his racing heart, his burning emotions.
Lowering the phone he looked at the screen then dialled his voice mail.
Sherlock felt drained, he was hot, his hair stuck to his neck and forehead and even though his breathing had evened out he still felt dizzy.
"I know. We are here to help." The police officer closest to him said as he took a step closer. "John, you need to move away from the edge, this whole ledge could go at any minute."
Sherlock looked up at him with a look that said 'think John' and nothing else.
He watches as his words cause Sherlock to first step back then lift his hands as though to reach out to John before lowering them again. The mans face, normally so closed off showed every emotion, showed his fear, his pain, his anger, his heart ache. John in return showed nothing.
Dont take the drugs. Continue to think clearly, but feeling everything as it hit, and continue to feel like his nerves were being set alight every few seconds.
"Can I leave?"
“Got it! It's dropping straight to us.” He says hit the control so that the speakers fill the room with an eerie pinging sound.
"You hate me." Sherlock suddenly sobbed.
"They told me what happened, what you did. We would have done the same in the end. It gives the doctors a chance to come up with what else they can do. I know doctor Ansari stayed up most of the night to come up with something."
"Your therapist, Cathy?" John nodded. "She has asked me to stay, in the family rooms. Would that be okay with you?"
"I told you I...Austin has done some horrible things."
"Go answer the door Sherlock."
"Thanks Mycroft." John's voice broke through his musings, his hands lowering the paper before folding it gently and placing it on his lap.
"Very good. It would seem your flashbacks can be recalled which means when they happen a part of you is still aware. That will help us when it comes to helping you deal with them but it will aslo lead to this disorientation you feel when you are lucid."
(See the end of the chapter for
"How goes it John?" Greg asked as he appeared on the screen.
“I’m John.”
The house was perfect and John found he no longer had any reason what so ever to hate a thing about his father.
(3:25am)
As John’s vision cleared he saw Moriarty leaning over Sherlock.
"A mind palace?" Doctor Ansari asked.
“John to the control room! John…oh.” The com cuts off and Sherlock runs.
"Okay." John finally nodded a small smile on is face.
Sherlock woke violently, he lashed out his fist clenching as he clearly went to strike John, but John was quicker, catching the first in his hand as he grabbed Sherlock’s other wrist and pinned It to the bed.
"How deep?" Molly asked clearly interested as Beany the rat cleaned her whiskers upon her shoulder.
"Sherlock, your defence is indifference. You wrap yourself up in it, but you need to face this."
"Okay...well I could do with fresh clothes and a decent shower-"
"Tell me about the sky in Afghanistan." Sherlock said turning to look up at the sky.
He had been give the much needed blood transfusion and the self-operation he had to perform was in the end a lot simpler than he thought it to be. The distance the bullet had to travel to get to John had been such that the bullet had slowed and it had only gone a few inches before it nicked a rib and came to a stop.
“Okay, just try and get some rest, k?”
“John, whatever your former life, your training has helped to get Sherlock free, it stopped further harm and probably saved both your lives.”
"Agreed."
"Heroine...under the floorboards by the fireplace." John shrugged, the movement bring his attention to his restraints. "Well fuck."
"I...John." He looked up as his heart pounded in his chest, as the fear that had been kept locked away in his chest slowly seeped free and spread through his body.
"Close the blinds." Mary said as she picked up Sherlock’s wrist and timed his heart rate, even though a monitor did that for her.
He had finished work early and he knew he needed to go shopping, that he couldn't live on Mrs Hudson’s scones and cakes forever. So with his last patient not turning up he left with the intent to fill his cupboards once again. He should have ordered online instead.
"Mmk." He mumbled leaning back aginst Sherlock, allowing his eyes to fall close and letting sleep take him.
"Doctor, formally an...army Doctor. Currently living in London after being...invalid after being shot...oh god..." the man's eyes squeezed shut and his hand found John's wrist gripping it hard. "You should go...go to her..."
“Sherlock no!” John stands, grabs Sherlock’s wrist and pushes them down so that they are on either side of Sherlock’s head. Now only inches from Sherlock’s face John freezes as glazed blue, green, silver eyes look up at him.
"John?" The speed the man moved was astonishing. He looked down at Sherlock then turned to Mycroft, he had clearly been crying, but Mycroft said nothing. "Go home, sleep, shower and eat. He won’t be waking up any time soon."
“Yeah…” John opened his eyes. “How did…damn it!”
Sitting up Sally puts an arm around John’s shoulders a smile on her face that was far from comforting. “John, let me tell you something. He isn’t half as smart as he thinks he is.” The smile turns mischievous as she picks up Sherlock’s air-hose and pretends to knick it.
But seeing John this way, having him there, right there just a few feet away, but unable to reach him was tearing Sherlock apart.
"Watson-Holmes...but not for much longer."
"Why is it taking so long?" John murmured his eyes never leaving the door.
Taking another drag, he turned his attention to the people milling about on the dark street, some shopping, others meeting up for a night out or going on a date. During his last break of the evening, all of them walked past him as though he were invisible.
"He...he will be pitying and I dont want that."
Sherlock went to retort but Coffey continued. "Oh but wait...you’re Watson right?"
Sherlock smiled, then he frowned.
"He...I'm not the same. He is used to someone strong, someone willing to fight, to run into the danger not away from it...I cant...I-" A knock on the door stopped him. Eyes wide he started to look around, there was only one door in or our, the room he was in was on the second floor and he knew the windows didn't open wide enough for him to even get his head out of. He was stuck, trapped, he needed to get out!
"Oh your loyalty is admirable." MaCormick said placing a hand over his heart. "Always the loyal little solider."
John laughed. "Tell me that if you do remember this."
"Including destroying a whole village?" Sherlock asked mockingly, but the look John gave him spoke volumes. "Bloody hell, John!”
"Yes. Sherlock, we could reason with you on some level but John, you are unreachable when you are down."
"What if I refuse."
"They died." John shrugged. "Why should he care about that?"
Sherlock smiles back before heading to the other side, little Geek following him faithfully with its lights lighting the way.
However, Sherlock’s arm tightened around him ad then soft lips pressed against his neck followed by a sigh.
"John, you have missed all your medication for today. Do you think it best to take some?" Cathy had been sat in the dinning room, waiting since the sun had set for John to wake.
Closing the door, he went back to Sherlock’s bedside, once again picking up his long pale hand and holding the fingers to his lips.
“No.” Sherlock shakes his head frowning at his own thoughts.
"I had a panic attack." John said, knowing this was the first time he admitted that that.
“Hey,’ Lock...” John calls, causing Sherlock to look back at him. “I'm glad you’re here.”
“Right, lean back as much as possible I need to see what I’m dealing with.” John ordered, holding the towel as Sherlock moved then removing it to look at what was done.
"What?" Sherlock turned his head, burying his nose in John's hair, just behind his ear causing the tremors John had become use to, to run through him.
"There is nothing, only the drug use."
"Thank you, I will of course come every day, and if anything medically comes up that you feel you cannot answer then call me."
“Waiting.” Sherlock was able to say as his eyes closed. “He is waiting for John to leave.”
“You need to get some sleep.” Was all Schoenick countered, but Coffey just turns and walks away as though he didn’t here.
Leaning against the now closed door, Sherlock sighed as he looked around. A version of John always joined him in this room, but not this time, this time the John of his mind palace kept away, just like the real John.
Closing his eyes Sherlock sighed and then totally relaxed as the sedative hit his system.
"Yeah, I'm here Sherlock."
"Thank you by the way." John said as they entered an elevator.
“Right, well, Sherlock, I’m John and I’m going to have another look at your head. Can you turn onto your side for me, facing the sofa cushions?”
Sherlock knew he had fallen the moment he had seen John on that train, his mind had raced with a million different ways for him to go and talk to him, to get a chance to know him. He never once thought that he would end up in hospital with John looking after him, being there for him, let alone kissing him.
"Meaning?"
Blinking he turned to the door, Mary stood there causing him to frowned.
Sherlock sank back down into the chair his eyes closing in relief.
"Okay, shall we then?"
"Do you think we could order out?" John suddenly asked from his position next to him. While they had been watching the films they both found themselves getting more comfortable with each other to the point that Sherlock had his feet up on the coffee table and John had curled up into his side, his head resting either on Sherlock's arm or his side, right now John had his head on his side while he held Sherlock’s hand with both of his, his fingers running over the line of Sherlock’s palm.
Why didn't he move? He could be kissing Sherlock by this point, could have that tongue inside his mouth, yet he stay still. What was holding him back?
Sherlock frowned, his eyes moving over John rapidly to which John’s fingers flinched from Sherlock’s hips to make sure his sleeves covered his wrists, Sherlock saw the movement though and his hands moved from John's face to his wrists.
"Sherlock will miss you?"
In his mind the sound of Sherlock’s scream as he pressed on his wound echoed endlessly through his mind, even when he tried to drown it out with songs from the Spice Girls it continued on. So now he just let it play, let it torture him to the point he could hear nothing else.
“Of course.” Mycroft says, picking up his bag and standing. “John, we will sort this out tomorrow.”
"Thats just it, we, me and Sherlock, talked about this. We don't just want the child to be ours, we want it to be yours as well. We want us all to be a family."
Running through everything they had spoken about he tried to work out where they were. John had said they where in England, just outside of London. Why? Why were they not at home? Looking about he took in the bedroom. It was well furnished, comfortable and stylish, but it wasn't lived in, it wasn't owned by anyone, it looked more like a hotel than a home. But then there was the living room, the kitchen the other people. He stopped in the others he had seen, the two men dressed in pale blue scrubs, the woman, dressed in a comfortable trouser suit. They all wore badges, all looked concerned and not at all afraid as Sherlock welded a knife at them. The badges, what was on the badges? Names; Cathy, Mark, Steven.
Jim flinched slightly at the voice, curling up more.
Oh my, I am so sorry for the long wait on this! Its been hard juggling two stories at the same time, as well as writing mini one shots, so I apologise for letting this one sit on the back burner when in reality its one of my most favourite ideas to date!
The smile John gave him at that moment caused a flutter in his chest that spread a warmth through the rest of his body.
Silence took over the room once again, the sound of sipping the only thing heard until Sherlock finally spoke.
"John?" Mycroft found himself grabbing John's wrist, his voice giving way to panic.
"Can I sleep?" Sherlock asked as he fell onto the sofa. It had been a long day, far too long, he didn't even care that the sun had yet to set. He just wanted to curl up in bed, with John holding him and sleep.
"Fun...okay." John stepped back from his husband a sly smile on his face. "New game. First to touch loses."
"He would push me against the wall when they allowed me to have my arms free."
"Shit." John stood, turned from Sherlock and walked to the window over look the gardens. Anger was building again, the one emotion that seemed to rule everything since he had started to feel again. It could be overwhelming at times, debilitating to the point he had, shamefully, been sedated. Cathy had been working hard to help him control it, to shut it down or talk it through, at times though he just needed to hit something, anything, hence the new punching bag in the corner.
"Yes."
"No you're not, but getting you both home is the aim here."
John's blue eyes darted up to his, the blue darkening slightly. "No fair, and you can’t, not yet."
"Why?"
"You're protecting me from the pain." He said to the wall and the looked at the man from under his curls. "And you are doing the same."
"It was an act." Sherlock murmured. "With Moran?"
"You have a few minutes before we take him down."
However, that was all about to change. Finally, after years of service to Her Majesties Crown, George Watson came to the end of his career and he and his wife Viviana had deemed it time to settle in one place and had bought a lovely cottage with three bedrooms, a huge garden with a stream running along the back of the grounds hidden by trees and wild flowers.
Once they were back in Moran looked at Maddie.
"John is being sectioned under the mental health act. He has agreed to this, but even without his concent he would be held." She looked down at the file she held for a moment. "John has requested one thing. He wishes for you to remain his next of kin, yet has made it clear you are to have no contact with him for the foreseeable future."
Heading in that direction he stopped half way there as a gun shot rang out, then he was running.
"No." John shook his head as he lookes up from his position on the floor. "That would destroy him."
He had just finished writing about the mother confronting the son when the warmth had appeared at his back, dark hair brushing against his face, warm breath ghosting over his neck and collar. His hands stilled on the keyboard, his breath hitching as he tried to breath in after his initial sigh, but the air was now full of Sherlock’s scent and he was lost.
"Sherlock?" John asked leaning down more.
"We are taking things slow." John said looking back at Sherlock.
"Doors lock at eleven." Mark says looking towards the clock. It was ten thirty.
"You're not crazy."
Kneeling, he took hold of Moran's still arms and pushed the man onto his front before wrapping the bloodied belt aroud Moran's wrists. He then searched the man for his gun and any other weapons before backing away.
“Sorry.”
"Remind me never to take anything you have hidden in the flat again."
“Hi.” John said softly as he slowly let go of Sherlock’s wrist and slowly lowered the other hand with Sherlock’s fist still clenched with it.
“The one we were involved in.”
“Maddie is dead Sherlock.”
"I...that is...they caught me."
“The images triggering a memory.” John almost whispered. “Mycroft you need to get doctor Ansari.”
"It's the trust we still need to work on, we both know that. But I know you love me, I know you're sorry and I know you are the only true thing in my life right now." Leaning up he brushed his lips against Sherlock’s, but didn't outright kiss him.
"Why not?"
“Humm...John.”
I got stuck on this one, I didn't know how to proceed and then yay it came to me.
The man looked back down at Sherlock now crying, tears running down his face, his eyes open but staring blankly at the ceiling.
He was covered in bruising, a possible broken knuckle, but as he flexed his hand he just deemed it as badly bruised. His face was sore but without touching it he was unsure what the damage was. Legs and arms fine if a little sore from strain and the beatings.
"I don't care, I need help! I can help!"
"Yes, also the new one...I didn't know they had made a new one."
"Do you realise, you have the most beautiful face?" Sherlock had asked as he had John pinned to the bed, causing a smile so bright and beautiful to form on John's face, a smile Sherlock needed to kiss and so he did.
"If you don’t follow orders this lovely pretty nurse will slowly lose her looks." With that Moran pulled free his pen knife, flicked it open and lifted the blade to the nurse’s cheek and ran it down her skin.
"I cannot believe you let them do this John!" Sherlock said his voice causing the others in the room with John to stop what they were doing and look up.
The monitor silenced as the medication took affect.
"He looks good."
They walked the rest of the way to the small courtyard outside the flat in silence, but Sherlock enjoyed the DI's company.
“At least you recognise me, so no memory loss,” John said with a warm smile as he got to his feet and held out a hand. “Easy up.”
“Of course he is.”
"Oh." John smiled then looked back to Cathy. "I agree."
“Sell it, make me believe you.”
"We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work. We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for fucksake. I can't believe you let them grab my rig!"
“No…John!”
Kneeling the man ran his eyes over Sherlock’s body and John knew, knew exactly what was about to happen.
"I should tell Cathy that." John said in a dead voice before he shook himself slight and looked up with a small smile. "So now you know the depth of my crazy."
“You remember?”
Enjoy xx
As he woke more he snuggled down into his pillow then sat up and turned to look at a still sleeping Sherlock.
When Sherlock looked back up at he smiled his hand moving from his hair to his face.
"Right, and you just happen to be watching the footage of me and Sherlock just before the explosion?"
"John, the mother did not weep, she was angry and disappointed."
John frowned.
"John." John looked up as Sherlock placed the now empty mug on the small coffee table between them. "I should have cancelled the phone."
"I don't want to see anyone else, the thought of having anyone else, other than you or Cathy, is...it hurts."
“And?”
Sluggishly he tried to turn but he was held fast, a deep velvet voice whispering in his ear.
"Why?"
"I know." John said in a rather tence voice. "He's pretty much right about everything."
"Your brother has told me that you left to do some rather dangerous work. You must have gone through a lot in the time you where away. Then to come back, to have your partner-"
“How did you know that?” The man slowly lifted Sherlock’s head with one hand and gently touched his scalp with the other.
Sherlock frowned. He knew that voice, the command in it's tone, the fear, he knew it well. Yet the face, the body was wrong.
"Sure." John nodded while giving Sherlock a small smile. As he knelt he felt Sherlock stay close but knew that he was looking around the room searching for more clues.
As John worked Sherlock let his head fall back against the pillow. He concentrated on his breathing, letting the air fill his lungs fully before letting it out again, doing this over and over, feeling the air enter his blood, traveling to his brain and clearing the cobwebs slightly.
"Not always, I got it wrong about Harry."
"Sorry." He muttered placing the card he had been given into his back pocket.
Looking behind him, he sees the enraptured look on John’s face that was perfectly mirrored in the waters.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry?” Sherlock looked at John, with eyelids heavy and uncooperative.
“Just do what you have to”
John was working on his recent blog post, writing up their last case, a boring four, yet it had paid well. A missing family hireloom worth more than John makes in a year had gone missing.
“No!” Sherlock said loudly causing him to wince. “He's here, staying close.”
“Fuck…”
"They moved him in here yesterday afternoon. It now seven in the morning. John the night staff told me that you haven’t moved since they brought Sherlock in here, they kept bringing you tea but you haven't once touch it." The blonde can and crouched on the floor next to the chair.
“Good girl.” He smiles causing Molly to roll her eyes at him.
“Maddie.” John protested pulling against Moran and looking at the girl led on the floor, her blood pooling around her.
"Sherlock?"
"Afternoon Sherlock." She greets with a smile as she closes the door. "How are you feeling today?"
"Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight." He orders as the darkness from the abyss engulfs them.
"Late. Come on, bed."
"Course."
(22:43pm) Well that sucked. JW
"Over and out." John said and pulled the headset from his head.
Coffey watches as his men huddle around an open missile hatch of the Montana using the large arm to help as they slow went about extracting one of the war head from a missile.
(10:08am) I would rather watch your back, it would make me feel so much better. But for now, please just promise me you will look after yourself. JW
“I know, we all know. Just be sure to take care of you as well.”
John fell asleep around one,  just as they put in the very last film, the one Sherlock had yet to see and if he stayed up to watch it, who was their to tell.
"Doctor Watson?" A voice behind him asked.
"We really should get up."
John let out a breath, his heart restarting at full speed. However, Mycroft still looked down at him with anger, as though the man thought that just a look would make John leave.
"You John Watson can never be call pathetic, you had reached a breaking point, one I caused and will be making up for, for the rest of our lives."
Around him was all the equipment he had tried, a sledge hammed, a saw, a battering ram that he had seen the police use to get into reinforced doors, there was even explosives and finally behind him was a JCB with a small wrecking ball attached to it, none of it worked. The wall itself was as pristine as when he first came across it, but the other walls bore the scars of the explosive and of the use of the wrecking ball.
"Just...keep breathing and when you're ready, come out of the car."
“So he sent you here.”
"No." He whispered as the lips on his shoulder turned to teeth and bit down hard causing him scream out and struggle against the hands holding him.
He felt as John's attention returned to him fully. The smaller man's body shifted slightly, soft lips grazing his temple then his forehead before a whispered voice spoke to his ear.
A moan was all that answered him sending another bolt of despair through him. He couldn't help.
Oh god, ohgodohgodohgod! Why couldn’t he hold on? All he had to do was hold on, hold on and pull. But the ground was too slippy, it crumbled under his weight, under Sherlock’s weight.
He was just finishing the article he was reading when an alarm from one of the monitors went off.
“Sherlock!” John shouted as he shook the bars.
"Agreed." Sherlock said turning to John.
"I'm sorry."
"No, definitely another way, walking through a park, through town, at a coffee shop, book shop, anything other than this." John lent further down and just pressed his lips to Sherlock’s temple so when he spoke again it was against soft, still warm skin. "Anything other than this."
"But for now, in this instant I am happy." John whispered then placed a soft, almost none existent kiss to Sherlock’s lips. When he pulled back he winked and jumped out of bed.
Coffey suddenly stands, the room falling silent as he and Schoenick leave the room. Watching them, Sherlock narrows his eyes catching the blood running down Coffey’s hand.
"Let me." Monk moves forward and somehow sorted the dials out. Within seconds Dimmock stops fitting and fell limply against John.
"All you need to know is that I hold a minor position within the British government...though I am sure once he wakes he will tell you otherwise." Mycroft petted Sherlock’s hair once again before straightening and walking to the end of the bed. "Look after him John, make sure they do everything they can to save him and I will be back later. Call if they have him go down for surgery before then." He pulled a card out and passed it John. "One of my men will be outside at all times, if you need anything just ask them."
“John, take me to bed, please, take me to bed.” Sherlock asked against his lips.
The hospital was in chaos.
John gently placed the hand he held onto the bed and slowly sat back and stretched out his back, lifting his arms up into the air to stretch them also.
"If I'm right, and he is trapped, we can only wait."
Once Sherlock was ready Mary turned to John with a smile.
They both looked down as John shifted then turned onto his side and instinctively sought out Sherlock, his hand stilling once it rested over Sherlock’s heart.
"Yes, though in a different area."
The room fell quiet for a minute causing Sherlock to look about catching Coffey’s arms moving slowly as they hid under the table.
"Of course." She said with a smile before digging into her bag and brought out a tupper wear box. "I brought some cakes, your favourite."
John’s hands were covered in blood as he kept pressure upon the stab wound in Sherlock’s abdomen. He had already used his coat to try to stem the bleeding but it didn’t help and in the end he had ripped Sherlock’s shirt apart and he had looked at Sherlock in the eye as he plugged the wound with his fingers causing Sherlock to cry out in pain.
"Sherlock you can not predict everything! Its just not possible!"
Lifting John’s head gently from his lap he lay him down then stood, went through the flat and opened the door leading to the hall.
"Come here!" He ordered, his tone giving no hint of leeway, Sherlock would move and that was the end of it.
Within the hour Mycroft had a cleaning crew in, along with Beth, or was it Angela, he didn't really care. But with her help and Sherlock barking orders, the flat was returned to its former glory.
"Oh...I'm sorry he's not your boyfriend?" Mary asked frowning slightly.
“Light, it was light, blue in colour and bright enough to light up the darkness for about a hundred feet and I could see it for some time as it made its way down into the abyss. It was small, whatever it was and it moved fast, extremely fast.”
"Oh thank god." John moaned as Sherlock opened his eyes. "I know, I really do. But you need to stay awake."
"Not yet." The man suddenly frowned and looked towards the door. "Soon though."
John laughed. "If you have only just worked that out you're more stupid than I thought!"
"Why?" Mycroft asked his heart rate doing the opposite and sky rocketing.
"Make you watch as I die? Make you listen as I leave my note, make you feel as though your heart has been ripped from your chest. Make you what Sherlock?"
"He hurt me."
“Yes. But not with you…with you it is like silk, like soft warm light.” He held his hand out then, not touching but waiting for Sherlock to reach out to him. “You are so safe Sherlock.”
“No, I believe that, I know you’re not high.” The tension suddenly disappeared and Sherlock slumped, his taller frame sagging as he leant back against the wall.
John smiled, Sherlock pleased with his act.
“Quiet!” Mike shouted as John entered followed seconds later by Sherlock. “Seriously guys shut it!” Mike turned to glare at those still talking excitedly.
John tried to keep his breathing slow and calm, to just be the rock in Sherlock’s storm. But he found it hard to hold himself back, from showing any emotion and so he tightened his hold and found himself pressing kisses into Sherlock’s curls.
"No!"
“There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months. I'm tool-pusher and we're working this automated derrick of his. Then we are back on the beach and... we're living together.” John said with a smile and a shrug.
He had spent most of the evening trying to distract himself, working on a cold case Greg had sent over after the murder case they had been look at it the morning came to a head when one of the girls many boyfriends interviewed and then cracked, confessing to it all. It was, in the end, a sexual encounter gone wrong, it would seem the girl liked air restrictive sex, hence the older brusing. Unfortunately the boyfriend had pushed it too far and had killed the girl.
"So something so traumatic has happened causing my brain to shut me in?"
John nodded.
“No Sherlock, he was here-”
"No, not you, not you."
John woke up.
Sherlock looked down as the last layer slowly peeled back and he got a look at his body for the first time since the explosion.
"Don't try to flatter John, answer the question."
They hadn't spoken since the movie had started, the both of them just watching the screen but not really taking it in.
“So what is it?” Molly finally asked Sherlock as she stood before him.
.~.~.~.
“Of course.” Mycroft left without another word, his phone raising to his ear before he even left the room.
John smiled, a smile that was cold and not at all what he was used to seeing on the normally controlled and well-mannered man he knew as John Watson.
"I believe you helped to stabilise and rescue a man named Sherlock?"
(9:38am) You didn't think? I find that hard to believe, but for now I will. However I will put this out there right now. I am so mad at you Sherlock! You left me! Again! But worse than that you left in the middle of us working through that same issue from last time! I...damn it Sherlock! JW
"Oh." This was a first for him, nightmares he was used to but not this, not reliving it in the way he just had. "John?"
*I’ll be waiting. *
"The male body is sensitive in a way a woman isn't. Give it enough simulation and it will react even if you don't want it to. It was not your fault Sherlock."
“Okay.” He say thinking for a moment. “We have to.”
"This Moran was in Afghanistan at the same time as me." John said as Sherlock sat next to him.
"He wont hurt you, not again, not with me around."
Looking down he saw a woman with blond hair, covered in blood and with green wide eyes.
"But look at him now." Slowly John lifts his head to look at Sherlock. The pain was gone from his face, his body relaxed and though he was pale, almost grey in colour, he looked a damn sight better than what he had been like when awake.
John let himself be moved by the DI but his eyes never left Sherlock’s form as his body continued to fit, as it tried to dispel the drug Moriarty had been giving him. The drug that John knew would either kill, or cause such damage to Sherlock that he would probably end up on medication of some sort for the rest of his life.
Sherlock paces, his heart racing, a smile plastered onto his face as the others chat between themselves adding to the level of excitement in the already charged room. The only people not talking were the marines, they stood behind a table, with Coffey sat before them, his hands hidden under the table.
John nodded though there was no video feed this time.
“Come on.” Grey pulled him back slightly to John’s side of the room.
Pulling his phone from his coat pocket he shrugged out of the heavy material, hanging it while he opened his phone and started to devour the files Mycroft had sent him after they had met.
“No!” He growls as he reaches the door to where Coffey was.
"Leave." John repeated for the third time. "I can not get up and make you." He lifted his wrists as much as he could, the restraints only giving him the smallest of movements to prove his point.
Smiling Sherlock kissed the top of John’s head. “John, do you remember a man on the train, in the next cab. Grey suit, dark eyes.”
"You don't have to."
.~.~.~.~.
"Over two hundred."
"You're freezing."
“Coming from the man who just told me not to hang around him in case all hell is let lose.” Crossing his arm’s, he leans his hip against the table and looks at John. “I don't know what I saw. Okay?” He admits wincing slightly at the admission. “Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, that much is obvious. So fine it's a Russian submersible.”
"Left pocket." Sherlock lifted his face up, his eyes hooded, his pale skin covered in sweat and looking more grey than white. John held his glazed eyes for a moment before searching out the left pocket in Sherlock’s trousers. When he felt a hard metal object in the pocket his eyes widened but he didn’t move.
“Sherlock?” John asked watching with concern as pain became evident on Sherlock’s face.
“Still here.” Sherlock whispers his eyes opening slightly. “Just holding back.”
John looks to the doctor who just shakes his head slightly. "You gave John full authorised medical say on your brother Mr Holmes. You lost all right to say who could be at his bedside when you did that, only John has that right."
"John!" Sherlock tried to grab at John's hands, trying in vain to stop what was happening.
"How the hell is she going to help Sherlock?"
“Molly, you think everything's a conspiracy.” John smiled.
"Did they stop the bleeding?" He asked not looking at her but looking straight ahead as he stood at military ease.
Turning back to himself, Sherlock ran the memory backward, only himself and Mind John not moving. He let the memory run right to the moment before he stepped onto the train. As the world went dark he stopped it and let it play forward once again.
“We got Russian subs creeping around.” She said then her eyes widened. “What if something goes wrong? They could say anything happened down here! Give our folks medals or something, know what I mean?”
Moving back into the room he picked up the clothes he had taken and went to Sherlock.
"Anyone in there!" A voice behind John shouted and a couple of voice answered, including John's.
"Magnetism. You and Ansari have it, those two definitely have it, me and Sherlock had it, still do...I think." John turned to look at Sherlock then, it had been hours since doing so, yet his hand had never left the still hand placed on the top of the covers. "He screamed. I was right next to him, he had tried to bury himself against the side of my face, my neck, when I did it. I didn't even think, I just knew it would work, that he would pass out. But the scream, I caused that and it will be forever playing in my head." Tears ran silently down John's face as he lifted the soft pale hand, raising it to his lips and running his lips over the knuckles. "I hope he doesn't remember."
So of course it was cold, no one had lived in the flat for nearly three months.
"Yes."
“Okay?” John asked, running his fingers through sweat soaked curls.
"Trust me?" John whispered as Sherlock lifted his hands to place on Johns arms.
He thought he could do this, but seeing John blank out like that and seeing the chaos when he woke was heartbreaking. All throughout the day Sherlock had wanted to reach out, to touch John, on his arm, his face, his hair, anywhere. But Cathy had advised against it, waking John while he was in such a state was dangerous. So Sherlock did as he was instructed and waited. When he woke, shouting at the world Sherlock had done as he had been asked, he stayed silent and just watched as John left. Cathy had said it was for the best to leave John to himself.
It was Sherlock’s time to still. This he hadnt been told, he had thought sleeping pills, painkillers, not class A drugs.
"Before we go." John stopped her as she reached the door. "He's wanting to go home."
Green was also a colour. Again not boring green, more like a crystal green, the kind of green you could find in the most clearest of waters.
“I know.”
As Mary left John broke down, a sob escaping his lips.
“BOOOOH! We want names!” Finley, a rigger, called out.
She led for a while just enjoying the peace but soon her body demanded she move, which would undoubtedly lead to waking the two of them up.
"Always unconscious when I need a password." Sighing he instead dialed the only number he could and placed the phone to his ear.
John sighed and lowered his head till it rested next to Sherlock’s, his left hand clenching the covers while his right rested over Sherlock’s frantic heart.
"Just...this sounds so pathetic, can we just cuddle?" John ducked his head, heat flooding his cheeks. But then Sherlock was pulling him down till his head was resting on Sherlock's shoulder.
"Okay...okay stop you made your point!" John walked to the other side of the bed and looked over at Moran. "Let her go!"
"She-"
“What happened? Why…” He frowned then gasped as his free hand went to his abdomen. “Fuck.”
“I was on the train because I was led there. I believed I was tracking down a murder, I now believe that to be a false trail, just away to get me on the train.”
Wow i finished it! 82 chapters long and nearly 45000 words. This is by far my longest story and I have loved writing it.
Sherlock's heart stuttered then started beating fast and hard in his chest.
"John, he's waking up."
“They made me watch, as they drugged him, dislocated his shoulder, hurt him, stripped him, I watched from a cage and I could do nothing to stop them.” John looked down at Sherlock his eyes running over the peaceful face, the cut at his hairline healing well, but it would scar. It was the only thing visible on the sleeping man to show he had been through anything, but under the covers, under the hospital issue gown was a body broken and hurting. “Moriarty had cure.”
"He was right John."
"Not dreaming John." Sherlock’s voice rumbled through him. "However, it is nearly eleven and Cathy wants to see us then."
"I really wanted to die, I couldn't do it anymore, couldn't pretend, couldn't deal with it. I missed you so much and I knew that no matter what I tried I would never feel happy, feel whole again and I just couldn't go on." John suddenly laughed. "It sound's so pathetic, wanting to end my life because I couldn't exist without you. But there it is."
“He was caught, tortured, I spent four weeks on the ground to get him out.”
"Yeah...gave me a bunch of cases the moment I got back."
"No, you need to leave." He panted.
“We searched this building John, we would have found Moriarty.”
“Right, so do you forgive me?”
"Well, yes." John answered with a frown.
John felt tears threaten as a lump grew in his throat. This brilliant man, the man that held his heart sounded so alone, was in so much pain and John could do nothing.
Turning he walks back to the main desk.
“Where are we?” He asked his left hand moving from silken hair to John’s shoulder, his fingers tightening.
Sherlock reached out then taking John’s hands in his own but said nothing as John squeezed his fingers gently.
"John?" Mrs Hudson’s voice sounded, closer than it should have been so he turned to her slowly, finding her close but still out of his own personal space.
"His brain will rot for sure if he has no external stimuli." He missed John laugh slightly as he lifted the paper back up and started to read once again.
"Did they rape you?"
"Give me...blood, and I will." He so wanted to add that he would also sort the mysterious guy out as well but he kept quiet.
"Oh shit, please tell me that's not you freak!"
“Sherlock, it’s okay. You’re safe.” His eyes shot open at the voice his eyes falling to John, sat in a wheelchair, his blue checked dressing gown from home wrapped around him. The cut on his temple had stiches, his hair was clean and he had had a shave.
