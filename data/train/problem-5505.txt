The frown on Sherlock’s face promised a cascade of questions Emily didn't have the patience for at the moment, and she held up a hand to stop him. Then, she pulled back her sleeve until her left forearm was bared. The Dark Mark curled its inky signature across her pale skin the way a writer trails ink on parchment.
“Thank you,” Arya told her, but Emily just rolled her eyes and turned to follow Harry.
Arya frowned slightly at her words. Why they were focusing so much on who was helping or not helping Moriarty, she did not know. “I fail to see how any of this is relevant. What we should be figuring out is how to stop these people from harming my sister, and how to fix this ‘dead rising’ problem. Emily has already given us a solution, we just have to find it.” The looks the rest of the room gave her as she spoke were not comforting. “What?”
He glanced up at John, who was biting his lip while watching the video over his shoulder. “What is so important about this? That woman with the headband told us all of this already.”
Emily’s first impression was of walking in the sky. Windows covered every wall but the one that held the door. Even the roof was made of glass, and when the sun was out the room must have shone with light. But dark heavy clouds had replaced the once blue heaven, and the room was cast in shadow.
, and the door swung open.
"I will see you there. I have to go, I think Blasmer set the west tower on fire again," Eragon turned to go, then glanced at her again. "Are you ok, Arya?"
And now everyone is fighting for no reason when there are
she thought.
“You know what, Potter,” he said slowly, “I do believe that’s the first time you ever asked for my help.”
Emily noticed that her mouth was hanging open, and she shut it. "And I'm supposed to believe that?"
Malfoy looked between the two of them and guessed the truth. “Hold on, are you saying you
Eragon and Arya looked at each other. "Umm... for transportation," said Eragon.
Standing up, she grasped the rubble from the bottom and pushed her shoulder against it with all her strength, lifting as she did so. With a crumbling sound, it slowly started to move. Emily strained against it, her arms screaming, until the boy’s leg was completely free. She dropped the rubble, panting, her head pounding.
“You with anyone?”
“And remember: If you can’t find the culprit soon, who knows when the next bombing will be! Better hurry up!”
“Do you believe we can do this? Stop Lucifer and the rest?”
Islanzadi stopped tapping and sighed. She wouldn't look at Arya. "I doubt that we will ever know, my child. Death is always the final obstacle for beings such as us. It is the one constant thing in this world. All we can do is try to find this source of... astonishing power, and neutralize it."
But if Moriarty was plotting revenge, then what would he do? Sherlock shuddered to think about what terrible things he might have in store. Forget being bored, this case might kill him. And how did Moriarty come back in the first place? Sherlock was
Sherlock glanced at John. The good doctor just shook his head. “We don’t have a choice, Sherlock. We’ll need them.”
, then decided they could be trusted with finding Emily?! What if they want to kill her?"
Emily let her sleeve fall without much thought. Without realizing she was doing so she traced the star on her head. “I have one more important thing to tell you. It is about the dead.”
echoing in the empty countryside. He still didn’t turn as Thor stopped next to him. Loki’s eyes were fixed upon the horizon. He looked deep in thought.
"But if we just checked-"
"We are Dragon Riders" Eragon said curtly. He didn't seem to like being called non-magical.
"Fine."
Emily tilted her head at Harry. “Voldemort? Isn’t that the same wizard you guys were blaming for the bombing along with me?”
She ran into the front room and saw that everyone else had already arrived.
Kingsley stared at Fred, his face a mask.
young. But we don’t know.”
She looked up at Emily. “What was the name of the detective you met with in London?”
"Emily."
are back? How? And
human, but her years in the magical world had taught her that what seemed human wasn't always so. He had a presence about him; an unnatural aura that reminded her of the man held on trial at the Ministry. What had he called himself again?
Another suspect named is the criminal James Moriarty, one of the country's most top wanted men. Though his death was confirmed by the government months ago, rumors of his death being faked have already begun to circulate. There have been no more suspects named as of now.
Eragon nodded his head thoughtfully. “Your magic is very unique. I should like to study it one day.”
“I’m Harry Potter.”
Alarms were going off in Heaven, sounding through each angel's head. Whoever was in charge of Heaven now was sounding the alarms for a high level threat. The limited amount of angels left were all contacting each other through the radio. They were talking about the dead... rising? Dead people, demons, angels, and everything in between, seemed to be returning to Earth. That was impossible. But they were talking about-
he had seen his more than fair share of weird stuff.
There was a touch of silence on the room as Emily took in what had been said.
"The name of this school. Hogwarts is a place where young witches and wizards can come to learn magic in safety. It's like a second home to many, really. There's a variety of subjects that are taught here, ranging from mildly informative to a bit dangerous. I teach Defense Against the Dark Arts."
Cas drove all day and night, stopping only for gas. His mind raced while he drove, trying to block the terror that was building up in his chest. If Rose was back, than did that mean other people were returning? And if people were rising from the dead, what about angels? And... demons?
Sherlock just stared at John, dumbfounded. “What do you-”
No one spoke for a while. Each face featured a different emotion; suspicion from Ron and John, curiosity from Sherlock, apprehension from Cas, interest from Sam and Hermione, wariness from Harry and Dean. And from Arya, there was only a blank nothingness.
echoed from above. Harry and Ron exchanged an uneasy glance, but before they could do anything the lift started to go up. A strange sound started to reach them as the lift traveled upwards. It was faint at first, but the closer they got to the atrium the more it grew: the sound of people screaming.
“Ack… don’t… know…” Emily gasped, unable to breath properly.
"Well, could you at least lend me a ride to the nearest town?" she asked sweetly.
Emily’s open mouth must have answered his question. “Ah, I see now,” he said.
“Well, I thought- and Lestrade agrees with me on this!- that Moriarty was saying that if we don’t find out what she’s up to,
about her, so agonizingly
He stood up and sniffed the air. The smell of sulfur assaulted his nose.
Loki grinned at him. “My dear hunter, I can’t just go about explaining everything I do to
Emily meets Loki.
"Fine. But the end game is still the same. Emily dies," Loki told him.
Arya's face was masked in shadows. Before she could reply, footsteps reached their ears and Harry and Hermione walked into the room. Arya stood up and crossed her arms. "What are you doing back here?"
He shook Emily’s hand, then bowed gracefully to Arya. “Farewell, Arya Drottningu.”
Emily's mind reeled.
“And he’s trying to take over again?”
this is not where I belong. And you know that just as well as I. So. Why?”
Hermione studied John with a small frown. “Actually, you may be onto something. See, murder like these used to be the favorite pastime of an evil wizard called Lord Voldemort. He was killed years ago, but now of course we suspect he is back. But there’s something off about this.”
“Who are you?” she found herself whispering.
“We knew he would come for us when we heard the news. We had betrayed him before, and if there is one thing he can’t stand it’s betrayal. So my parents locked themselves in their house while I helped the Ministry try and track him down. No one had seen him though. It was like he had disappeared again. So yesterday I returned to my office to find out that all the Goyles and Crabbes had been murdered in their beds,” Malfoy took a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment. “So I rushed home, only to find my parents lying on the floor. Dead. It didn’t take a genius to guess what happened.”
Cas watched Dean idly browse the shelves of books, his fingers brushing lightly against the leather spines. He picked one blue volume and returned to the table with it, casually opening it up and flipping through the pages as though vaguely interested in what it had to say. Cas couldn’t remember the last time he had seen Dean read a book without being told to do so by him or Sam.
As they walked out into the cool night air, Harry said, “I have to return to Hogwarts. If Hermione and Ron left for a message, it must have been something big. You should come with me, Emily. I can't let you wander around by yourself."
“Let’s keep searching,” John’s voice broke through his thoughts. “You go upstairs.”
Ron snorted. "Like she ever has."
Cas landed on his back and hit his head with a loud
Sherlock turned to face him, annoyed. “So? Who would do something like that? Stay behind at a crime they committed not once but
“No more so than any other Hogwarts student,” Dumbledore mused. “In fact, compared to the school’s history of troublemakers, she was an angel. But one cannot remain a pupil their entire life.”
“We don’t know,” Hermione said. “On the same night she died, a nearby theater was bombed. The police were too busy with that to investigate one murder with almost no leads.”
Something flashed in her mind, a blurry image of a figure on the ground, yelling in pain. Without thinking she ran toward the entrance to the building, her arm over her mouth.
And once upon a time, so long ago that it seemed to never happen, but not so long ago that it could be forgotten, there lived two girls. These girls were not special- at least, not to the world around them. They were special only to each other, for they loved one another more deeply than the tallest tree’s roots. Their love was like the geysers that shoot from springs in the dreary summer heat; like the lava that bubbles and rushes from the earth’s surface in waves. They were one when together and two halves of a broken piece when apart. And they were not alike, these two girls. They were different in their own ways, but that never comes in the way of love, does it? Every word, every touch, every kiss meant more than the world to them, because they
"I wonder which one I was in," Emily said.
of that makes any sense. First of all, why would Emily ever work for Moriarty? What’s her motive? And even if she was, it would make
Emily shook her head. "You better find those eye witnesses, because they lied. Someone really wants me dead, so I'm thinking that they must be trying to get
Sherlock dug through another stack of papers, surrounded by boxes and files from years ago. The hustle and bustle of Scotland Yard was
Hermione and Ron glanced at each other. This man might be their only chance to find out about the Devil and the reason he was interested in Emily. They needed to know what was happening, preferably before they got to know first hand.
“Yeah, yeah I am. Look, how about we meet up in Upstate New York near Lake Ontario, East Bay. I’ll explain everything later.”
in the silent air. She sat up, looking around. She was in a field, under the one tree for miles around. It was a tall oak with long, still branches that reached out as if to hug the world. Its trunk was as wide as five people standing side by side and as tall as six men.
coming back, I don’t think the normal rules apply, do you?”
"Mother, I am only saying..."
They made their way down the busy street, trying not to get lost in the sea of people. Arya was completely overwhelmed, staring at the nosy machines and towering buildings with wide eyes. Coming from a world where there was no electricity or any modern technology and being shoved into London without any warning was a huge shock. She was so lost that she tripped over someone’s leg and fell toward the ground.
They entered the feasting hall, Emily a bit more hesitant than Hermione. Her dream was still fresh in her mind and the stares everyone gave her when she walked in didn’t help with her nerves. She followed Hermione to the far right table where many people from the night before were sitting, eating and talking in turns. Professor Dumbledore was speaking to a man with shaggy black hair and clean cut beard. At least five red-haired people milled about, and Emily guessed they must be related.
So the other explanation, as far from logical as it seemed, was that…
“Albus, you don’t actually believe her?” Sirius demanded, outraged.
He held her gaze for a moment, then nodded, "If you say so," and left.
“Seems like it.”
“Yes. We’ve been trying to track down one of them for the past few days,” John said. “How did-”
times, and not get caught? It doesn’t add up, John!”
this murder was going to happen! He’s involved somehow,” Sherlock murmured. “We have to get back to London, I don’t like what this means.”
“You can’t, unless you’re a wizard,” Hermione told him, glancing up at the sky uneasily. “Come on, we had better get going before this storm breaks. Lead the way, Eragon.”
of our world."
? Arya thought, staring at her sister. When Emily had been sent off to school in Midgard, they had had no idea what she was doing until she died. They had buried her there and left, and Arya had never thought she would see her sister again. Since the moment she left the forest to the other day when Arya saw her again, Emily’s life was a complete and utter mystery. And since Emily herself could not remember a thing about her past, anything could be possible.
Zacharias looked at the door to the kitchen, then to Arya’s still body. “Leave them for now. The important thing is to deliver these two to the Ministry safety. We’ll come back if need be.”
"That wasn't natural," she said slowly.
Lucifer
"She's kind of an Asgardian legend," said Thor. "She can breath fire and has other magical powers. Very powerful. Very dangerous."
Emily turned to meet his gaze. How did he know about the fire inside of her? His blue eye, like a fork of lightning across the dark sky, was set with grim determination.
Their lips met for the second time that day. The kiss was different: the first had been desperation and relief, this one was full of tenderness and an overwhelming love that made them clutch at one another as though they only had a small moment to spend together. And if that had been true, it would have been enough.
exist?” Rogers said, staring at Harry as though his head was on fire.
"Yeah," muttered Harry, lost in thought. "Except in the good old days we almost got killed a lot."
. For some reason, the use of such an inclusive word stuck in Arya’s thoughts, chasing around her brain like a dog does its tail. It was a we, now.
“This plane came down and two men came out and spoke to ‘em. They left with ‘em and flew off not five minutes ago.” As she finished her sentence, the woman broke out into another fit of coughing and they helped her to the paramedics.
Mr. Weasley ran toward her voice, his mind afluster. Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Molly Weasley greeted him as he stumbled into the living room.
“He’s an angel,” she said, swallowing once to get her voice in order.
Set 20 years after Emily's death. For background, Harry is 20, Eragon is 25 (set a few years after the books ended), the Avengers are present day age, (bear in mind that Thanos is not part of this that little purple shit; so infinity war and endgame are not part of this, they never happened) and Sherlock and John are as they were right after the events of the third season. Also season 13 (and onwards) of Supernatural is also excluded from this as I started writing this before it aired.
Harry turned his cup slightly. “We want to know if you know anything about the bombing that happened. Maybe who did it, or why?”
He blinked, trying to orientate himself. Every inch of wall and ceiling was covered in inky black paint, over which was painted thousands upon thousands of tiny silver stars, twinkling with every movement he made as they reflected the fading light from outside. The floor stood out in its wonted wooden planks against such artistry.
, and Cas hadn’t even noticed. What if they had never found the real Dean? He couldn’t bear to think about it, to think about a world without Dean Winchester in it.
There was something strange in Arya’s face as she looked at Emily. There was pain there, yes, but also a deep intensity. Her eyes pleaded with Emily, as though searching for something she had lost. It occurred to Emily at that moment that perhaps Arya had been different once. Perhaps the sister who had given her that red rose was still there, desperately trying to emerge, but afraid of being rejected.
Wind pushed the branches of the ancient trees to dance, waving at the Queen of the Elves as though in tribute to her deeds. Her mistakes.
The moment was broken when John turned around.
Sherlock joined him, helping the woman get away from the smoke. “Did you see anything?”
she thought.
“What?” Emily said blankly. Those who died after her?
Harry couldn't breath. He couldn't move, couldn't think or speak. He had dreaded those words ever since he had killed Voldemort, though he never thought they would come true. He felt like a hand had curled around his throat, forcing all the air from his lungs. Hermione and Mrs. Weasley gave a little shriek and all eyes turned to Harry. He didn't know what to say. He couldn't move. He couldn't
And before Eragon could so much as bow, the Queen swept away, leaving her two daughters to follow in her wake. Arya tried to catch his gaze as she left, but when she turned around, she found herself staring in the silver depths of Emily’s eyes. And she did not like what she saw.
Emily just stood there, as still as the trunks of the ancient trees, her silver eyes glittering with emotion.
As she rounded the next bend, she became aware of someone behind her. Quickly walking down the block, she crossed to the other side of the street and turned the corner. A moment later, the figure did too. Emily was being followed. She picked up her pace and looked behind her to see someone wearing a grey hoodie with the hood up. She started to jog up the street, twisting through the London crowds as fast as she could. As she hurried down the block, she glanced over her shoulder and saw that the figure was running after her, and gaining. Making a quick decision, Emily ran through the next corner and ducked inside a building with an open door next to a busy cafe called Speedy's. She stuck herself to the wall and held her breath. She waited a few minutes, then poked her head out of the door frame but saw no one of suspicion.
“Just be careful.”
distracting, but he tried to concentrate anyways. His long fingers flipped through a file from twenty years ago, when the bombing on Shell Centre had happened. There was a description of a girl, describing Emily exactly, as the main suspect. But that had to be impossible; how could Emily be the same age as she was
, might be the strangest thing that had ever happened to poor Arthur Weasley.
“We want to ask them about a dream Emily had,” Ron said, helping Eragon up.
“I remember you,” the doctor said slowly to the woman. “You were the one who burst into our flat and took Emily away. Hermione, right?”
“A bastard child is by no means a sin. However, a bastard is different among the elves. We do not marry- we partner for life, and a very long life it is. There is no official ceremony that separates the birth of a child from illegitimate to legal. But for me to bear another man’s child while my partner still lived… that is something I was never forgiven for. It is what hung over your head from the moment I pronounced you mine, Emily. No one could outwardly judge me for it, I was the queen. But you were only a child, and a wild one at that. You see, you do not possess the magic most elves do. You cannot manipulate the energy that flows through every living thing. You have a different kind of magic inside you. And for that you were judged.”
"I... who are you? How do you know my name?" Emily demanded, trying to focus.

Arya nodded. "Then Firnen will take us. Meet me at the turn of the river where we first parted in two days."
"Where did they go?" Cas asked without turning around.
They did, and after a few seconds, a tiny red dot appeared on the mobile map. "What the hell!?" Dean murmured, staring at the dot. Sam's phone was in New York.
And with that he stormed out of the hall, the big oak doors slamming shut behind him.
The angel entered the room himself then, closing the door to the kitchen and choosing a seat across the table from Dean.
“Rest. Tomorrow we shall talk some more.”

Cas forced himself to get up, his head still ringing. Loki was nowhere in sight. Arya was also missing. Sam was scrambling up from the floor, presumably from being thrown there.
Malfoy looked up, confused. “I beg your pardon?”
Sam shuffled in his seat. "Well, that's the point, we don't know. You can't remember anything, and we have no info what so ever on him. Anything could be possible, but it's just as likely he
“Like when you gave me that rose?”
"Of course. In the end, she will die.
Maybe instead of blaming me for every problem you stumble across, you should try and find whoever
Dean tilted his head, his eyes fixed on Emily’s face. “Do you know that for sure?”
The way she looked at her, it was like she expected Emily to know the answer. It was the same look Thor and Castiel had given her, the same accusatory glance that made no sense to her.
“But sometimes we cannot ignore these problems. Like now, for instance. We did not trust you with the existence of the supernatural, and look where it has landed us. You committed treason, Harry. You disobeyed our direct orders because what you saw conflicted with what you were told. In truth, part of this is not your fault. But you still chose to act as you did and that is where our problem lies.”
“Did you ever meet her sister?”
"How should I-" Emily started before Sam interrupted her.
“Sam is right,” Cas said, still looking straight into Dean’s eyes. “You’re stubborn, Dean, and arrogant, and fool-hearty. You think you can solve every problem by yourself. But even you know when you need help, and you’re never too proud to ask for it. You’re not stupid. You would never do something like this. You’re-” Cas struggled to control the tremble in his voice as he finished. “You’re better than that.”
She patted down her pockets and felt something beneath the dark leather jacket that hung close to her frame, so she reached into it to pull out a long wooden stick. It was made of dark wood that was smoothed and polished to a fault. Gold edged the handle and side of the stick, curling around the end like a snake. How odd. She put it back in her pocket, not willing to throw away any of her possessions yet.
"Your Majesty," the messenger cried with a lot more excitement than an elf normally showed. "There is something that requires your attention."
she answered.
Her second impression was one of eyes. Eleven pairs of piercing eyes turned to latch onto her, all of them narrowed and suspicious. Five chairs stood on each side of a large wooden desk set in the middle of the room. In each chair sat robed wizards and witches with matching frowns and bagged eyes. Sitting at the regal desk was a tall, dark skinned man without a single hair on his head. He had kind if slightly tired eyes the colour of amber, flecked with gold. He wore a pair of purple robes embroidered with golden symbols and lines that trailed down his arms and legs in intricate patterns.
Mycroft had done this once or twice, but never for as long a time before. The older Holmes would not look at Sherlock, and instead fixated his gaze on the fire.
"Well, as long as you're here, you might as well sit and have some tea."
The door suddenly opened, and in walked his business partner, Loki.
“THOR!” the purple shirt man exclaimed, jumping up. The young boy in the kitchen dropped his bagel, wide-eyed.
"Hogwarts has been closed for the time being. What with all the chaos, no one wants to send their children away right now," Hermione answered, leading her down another flight of stairs.
bombing hits our beloved city? So!” Moriarty continued, clapping his hands together with an insane glint in his eyes. “I’ve decided to helllllp! There is a little town up in Ireland that just might help you find the culprit in these
Hermione went on and on. Tonks was the woman with pink hair and changing facial features. Remus Lupin gray hair and tired eyes. The man with the peg leg, one eye, and lots of scars was Mad-Eye Moody. The Weasley family were the red-heads. There was also Professor McGonagall, a stern lady with grey hair pulled into a tight bun.
"I'm not finished," hissed Loki.
Her mother stood up. "We can not dwell on matters such as this. All we can do is try." She looked down at Arya and frowned slightly. "And I will need you to do most of the trying."
Sherlock snorted. “You go, if it’s that important. I need to drop by Baker street.”
"Yes. That's why I was so relieved to see you; I thought you were dead. But with every other deceased person returning, I guess you did too."
"You are not normal," she announced, her pupils slitting like a cat's. Cas saw her hand slide to the top of her scabbard, where the hilt of a sword lay. Behind her, the blond man did the same. "Who are you?" she asked. Her voice had a strange musical cadence, almost like a spell. Cas blinked to stay focused.
Loki held up his hands in mock surrender. “Whoa, Whoa, no need to be so demanding, hunter. He’s not dead, I promise. I believe the last time you saw him was in… Hell.”
Dean faces a closed door. Sherlock experiences a revelation. Emily meets a not so familiar face.
Besides, Harry knew what it was like to lose his parents.
“He needed help,” she croaked, looking down at the boy. “His leg, look…”
The others nodded. Shortly after, John and Sherlock got up to leave along with Harry to show them to one of the dormitories. A few minutes later Dean wandered off, and after about four second of anxiously glancing at where he had disappeared, Cas followed him. Ron, Hermione, and Sam were left at the table, deep in conversation about the book Cas and Dean had been reading earlier.
Harry advanced and Eragon tried to stop him. "No, she doesn't know what's happening, don't hurt her!"
Loki looked away first. “Nothing can ever be like it was. This is my only chance.”
“Is he a Muggle? Harry,
“Cool!” the boy at the counter yelled. The man with the metal arm was studying them, his brow furrowed slightly.
“Do you know, when I woke up on my grave, I thought I was dreaming? I figured I was in a memory, reliving a world I no longer belonged to. My first thought was to find you. I knew that once I was with you I would be fine, memory or not. I went to your cottage. I knew as soon as I saw it that I wasn’t dreaming. There was no fire lit inside. You always had a fire going, even if we weren't there. I still went inside, because I had nowhere else to go.”
“Never you mind,” snapped the witch with blond hair.
“Sherlock? Sherlock!” a familiar voice broke through his thoughts.
Arya didn't know what that meant, but Harry seemed impressed. All of these new machines and technologies seemed so unreal to her, like a dream a child invented.
As they reached the main doors down the hall, Loki grabbed Banner and pinned him to the wall. He quickly pressed the knife he had stolen from the kitchen against his throat.
“Like an angel?” Emily asked.
“I was born much earlier than you, as our mother’s first child,” Arya began. “You were born many years later, when I was an adult, but not as my full sister. You see, we do not share the same father.”
“Why?”
Arya nodded. They looked at each other, then stepped forward into the rip. Together, as always.
Cas knew he shouldn't follow Dean. He knew, deep inside, of where it might lead. But he couldn’t help himself. Dean had been gone.
This was a lie. That is what Odin told his subjects and the rest of the nine worlds. When Emily had entered Midgard, her presence had sent a flare through the nine worlds. They had been confused as to where this powerful girl had come from. Odin had put up a facade to keep his subjects calm, but the fool of an old man should have known it wouldn't keep forever. However, the Avengers didn't question his short tale. They didn't know enough to challenge him.
John returned to the room with a tray of tea. He handed one to Harry and Arya but Emily declined hers. So did Sherlock, but John looked used to that already. He pulled up another chair besides the detective and sipped his own cup carefully.
"Oh, for all my luck, I have to meet you," sighed the witch, her Scottish accent familiar. Her brown eyes sparkled with tiny lights of anger. She was wearing a tight, ankle length black dress, the same dress she had been wearing when she died. Her curly ginger hair fell over her shoulder as she lifted her chin and said, "Are Sam and Dean with you?"
"No."
“We, uh, found something,” Sam continued. “It seems Lucifer has raised the dead before. We don’t know exactly how, but we think we know some of the ingredients he used, so it’s possible he’s responsible for… all this.”
Sam cursed and Cas closed his eyes.
The Minister tilted his head every so slightly. “Why would any of us have ever met him?”
The old man squinted at him, as if trying to see his face better. "Yeah, actually, I have. Fellow came in earlier today, lookin' for some girl, and left with a young man and woman. Said he was headin' north."
“Sherlock, are you alright?” John asked.
“So, what exactly do you want my help with?” Sherlock asked, ignoring John's question.
“I can’t explain everything that I’ve done,” Harry said slowly, choosing his words carefully. “We were all scared. We never thought the dead would come back. It’s
"I don't know if, or how, she did it," Harry muttered, "but the Ministry needs to find her and get some answers."
Emily opened her mouth to speak, but the words were stuck in her throat. She just stared hungrily at the crown, not able to hide how much she wanted it. Her memories.
The two girls stood in the alcove of the castle with their arms around each other, the moon rising in the clear night sky, as the stars twinkled their merry light above.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Honestly, the 'angel' thing sounds like a load of dung to me. That guy is just crazy."
“Cas, thank god. Dean wasn’t answering. Is he with you?”
“I brought you a beer,” Cas said, placing the cold beverage on the table between them. Dean gave him a small smile and moved it to the side, not bothering to open it. Ok, reading books for fun and rejecting alcohol? Something was up.
"Wait," Sherlock intervened, stepping forward. "She didn't do it. I can prove it, just don't take her into custody."
An emerald green dragon emerged from the drop off, the sun glittering off his scales like gems. It landed in front of Ayra and she laughed, placing a hand on its head. The dragon gave a low growl and pushed her lightly with its enormous head.
And in the doorway stood Fred Weasley.
was anyways. All she wanted was to get her memories back.
Before Eragon could respond to that, Dumbledore left the table and strode out of the great hall, just as the rest had done. The doors shut behind him with a loud

“That is not your decision. Emily is

“You two are going back to Midgard.” He smiled at the surprised look on their faces. “I know you, Arya. You won’t rest until you solve this mystery. But I’m not going back. I have other duties. Duties that require me to stay here. I just wanted to wish you luck, and if you ever need my help, you need only ask.”
Security cameras, all facing Sherlock, John, Hermione, and Draco. Way too many cameras for one ordinary family, way too many for a safe neighborhood. And they were all watching them.
bring back the dead. Like Riddle or-” She cut herself off, not wanting to bring up her dream.
Hermione sat down next to Ron and Harry and poured herself some coffee. Everyone looked on edge and nervous, but they all clearly felt safe in this castle and around each other. They were like one big family. Emily was the estranged cousin who was never received a holiday card.
Emily shook her head and continued to back away. "No, something's wrong, something's wrong something's wrong something's wrong WHO ARE YOU?" she roared, still clutching her head. Her eyes were full of panic, her teeth gritted and lips thin.
"STOP," roared a voice from the center of the crowd, and a bolt of flames shot into the air, disappearing before they hit the ceiling. "EVERYONE. SHUT.
At this question, the other witches and wizards stirred about restlessly, exchanging hurried glances with each other. Bones leaned down and whispered something into Kingsely’s ear and he shook his head in response.
Emily scowled and turned back toward the Queen’s chambers, ready to barge in and strangle her mother, but Arya pushed her against the wall and glared at her.
The woman coughed for a bit, then said, “Not really. I was in the buildin’ when it exploded. I got out, but not many did.”
"Any idea who would want to blame you?" he asked, ignoring her muttering.
HELLO I am back to writing this so yeah, expect some more chapters soon! Comments are greatly appreciated, and thank you so much to those who have encouraged me to keep writing!! You are the best.
But why should they be? They had no reason to trust him, even Loki would see that. He wasn't known for playing well with others, after all.
The guards dragged the laughing angel out, the door slamming behind them.
"This is the entrance to Midgard," Arya answered. She had been here a long time ago with her mother, on their way to find Emily. That trip had not been fun, and Arya sensed that this one would be equally difficult.
"Apparently on a secret mission," answered Dean, grabbing his car keys. "And we're gonna follow him."
Zacharias glanced at him then looked away quickly. “Special orders. The Minister wants to see you.”
“Oh, the willow! It’s our oldest tree and quite a beautiful one at that. It’s near the old rose cottage, if my memory serves me right.”
"I... I have to go, Dean," Cas muttered. He turned and started for the door, but Dean stopped him.
“Why are you here anyways?" the young girl shot back. "Do you know these people?”
So he started to tell him everything, as short as he could. Still, it took most of an hour to explain the events of the past few days. Dumbledore never interrupted him. The sky above seemed a bit less dark by the time he finished, the stars starting to vanish.
John’s face brooded more questions than strokes on a painting. Draco’s face warned off those questions, but Sherlock knew John wouldn’t care. Already tired of the soon to be stand off, Sherlock pulled his attention away from the conversation. His mind swirled together a confusing concoction of memories and theories. If Hermione was right, then where did that leave Moriarty? Had he just pinned that note to confuse them, or was it deeper than that?
And with that, the mirror darkened, and Arya was left staring at a blank piece of glass. She carefully set the mirror down and left the old hut. Islanzadi had long since returned to the palace deep in the heart of the forest. The sky outside was black and filled with twinkling silver stars. She looked out at the dark field of grass and sighed. It was getting colder every moment, the darkness thickening with each passing second.
Sherlock slowly lifted his head to meet John’s piercing gaze. “Moriarty sent me a piece of paper. It had the words “The White Willow, Salix” written on it. I assume that is the place he is referring to.”
“Hold on, you’re saying
Cas nodded his head slowly then took a cautious step toward Dean. Across the room, Arya’s eyes locked on Emily.
Besides, she didn't think she should trust strange men.
Sherlock was silent for a moment, his eyes training on Emily until she disappeared into the crowd completely. “I think The Game has begun.”
Emily's look of shock was priceless. "I... I didn't? I mean,
, like the one on the plane, was set on the side of the largest building. They set down on a landing pad just to the side of it.
"So this is it?" asked Eragon.
Sherlock nodded. “I know all about those.”
“But I’ve done magic before. Spells and summonings and stuff like that.”
wasn’t there.
"Of course, tweetie pie, I'll get out of your hair," she said, raising an eyebrow at his dashboard. "Might want to stock up on some gas while you're here, though."
“Hey, where are you going?” Lestrade called as John scurried after him.
“Sir,” Harry interrupted suddenly, his face a study in confusion. “What do you mean by ‘other magic’?”
Sherlock stared at him, trying to ignore the warm feeling that was spreading down his shoulder. “You heard what he said. If we don’t go along with his game, the bombings will continue! I thought
“Are you a doctor?” she asked him, tilting her head a bit to the side.
Emily stood up, stretching. “Well if you’re not going to chuck me in prison, I think I’ll go.
“I think it's safe to say that I’m not safe anywhere,” Emily whispered.
“Your story is a compelling one,” Rogers said after everyone had finished speaking. “I don't think you bombed those buildings.”
Arya and Eragon both had their swords as well as a small pack of supplies. Eragon didn't look much different from the last time Arya had seen him. His blond hair curled at the temple, his brown eyes full of warmth. He seemed more mature than when he had left. His journey, rough as it was, hadn't been able to take away the kindness that Arya had first experienced in Gilead all those years ago. He was a good friend, and could be something more, with time.
Sherlock was silent as he drove, letting his mind work as they veered down the almost empty road.
Harry glanced at Emily before answering. “Ron Weasley, sir.”
She shook her head. “Can’t remember anyone like that. But will you-”
"Miss Rose," the black haired man said, "My name is Harry Potter and this is Ron Weasley. We are bringing you in on suspicion of bombing prominent buildings in London and the use of magic in front of Muggles."
Here is some angst nobody asked for :)
they knew he was back. The rest of the teachers at Hogwarts had stayed in case anyone needed refuge in the days or weeks to come. But now, only Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Eragon were left in the Great Hall.
“Dean, this isn’t like you,” Sam said, casting a worried glance back at Cas.
Harry didn’t say anything. He simply looked at her, the girl with piercing silver eyes and magic beyond his comprehension, and nodded.
Eragon was studying Fred, his eyes narrowed slightly. Apparently this boy got suspicious fast. “So, I’m still a little confused. Arya didn’t really explain this whole ‘the dead are coming back’ thing to me. Did you say you don’t remember anything about how you came back?”
But she knew this time. It was a memory.
?” Sherlock growled, utterly annoyed.
after you as he is. You have power, and believe me, he won't let you go unnoticed."
“Wait, how do you know all of this stuff? About wizards and demons and everything?” Harry asked.
“Maybe?” she muttered, berating herself for bringing it up and wondering how Dumbledore could know that.
“Mr. Winchester, I think you had better tell me what has transpired since you met Emily Rose,” Dumbledore said softly.
Cas looked down at the hand on his arm and nodded, swallowing hard. He started to follow Rowena to the warehouse, Hermione, Ron, and Eragon in suite. At the entrance, he turned and said, “I’m sorry, Balthazar. I’m sorry we couldn’t save you.”
still seem to be mad at me. Why would Loki even be after me?”
can use magic?” John scoffed, nodding his head at Emily. She suspected he still didn't know or believe that magic existed.
“Yes, Minister,” Zacharias answered, and a moment later there was one less person in the room. The bind around Emily’s mouth was starting to hurt now as it had been slowly been absorbing the unnatural heat from her body. She hoped they would take it off soon. She was no fool; even if she tried to use her fire she would be vastly outnumbered by the other wizards. Best to wait and consolidate her power if she wanted to get out of this mess.
He blinked at her, startled. “Yeah. I was an army doctor until a few years ago when I moved in with Sherlock. How did you-”
His eyes turned into black orbs and Dean had time to think,
Robin stared at her incredulously. “You think learning how to raise yourself from the dead is the weirdest thing you’ve ever told me? Come on, Emily, you’re an elf! You were born in another
He heard loud footsteps and turned his head to see Thor enter with a glowering Stark and Banner flanking him. Loki smiled, opened his arms as if for a hug, and said, "So, what's the big decision, then? Am I allowed to join the team?"
“Clients?” Harry echoed.
Turning to Eragon she continued, “Shadeslayer, it is an honour to have you in our forest again. Should you need anything it will be provided for you. If you wish to contact Saphira there is a mirror in your quarters that will provide you as such.”
He laughed. "Guilty-y-y." He followed her gaze to the fireworks and smiled. It was not a pleasant smile.
Dean glanced down at Cas’s hand still attached to his arm and wrenched it out of his grip. Sam looked on with wide eyes and caught the angel’s gaze before he could look away.
“I see,” Dumbledore said and stood up, starting to walk down the hall. “I must go now. Miss Rose, I will see you later. But one more thing.”
you?” Harry asked when she reached them, coughing tremendously.
Sam nodded, standing up. “I do have one question, actually. How do you know who I am?
Robin loved playing basketball, whether by herself, with friends, or just watching didn’t matter. She loved racing around the court, dodging between her opponents with sweat trickling down her shirt, dribbling the ball away from greedy hands. She loved the moment when the ball hangs on the edge of the goal, tethering from side to side, deciding which way to fall. She loved the pounding of her heart as she raced across the court to block an opponent's move. She loved drinking cool, relieving water and laughing with her friends as they celebrated another game well played, slick with sweat, exhaustion, and happiness.
Sam left him sitting there, twiddling his thumbs and staring up at the stars; Dumbledore was definitely odd. He followed the directions to the library. It was huge, filled to the brim with hundreds of thousands of books. Long tables filled the center and other reading spots were crowded in among the many shelves. A few candles were lit but no one was at the main desk. He walked in, stunned at the amount of knowledge the room held.
Harry glanced around the room, as though looking for an ally. It seemed to Emily that he knew some of the people in the room. A young woman with blond hair and wide eyes gave him a look of confusion and pity. A man with a scar on his neck wouldn’t meet his eyes.
Sam stood up and took the phone from him. “It’s Cas and Dean! Let them in.”
! The two men pushed Sherlock aside and grabbed Emily by her arms. She opened her mouth, wherever to breath fire or speak she did not know, because the men turned like the woman did and the world twisted into a black void. They were gone.
Emily thought.
Cas gritted his teeth, staring at the man on the throne. “That’s Lucifer, the Devil.”
Ayra reached across the table and gripped her sister’s hands. “That is not true. I can protect you here. Here, I am a Dragon Rider, a princess, an elf. In Midgard, I am no more powerful than the Winchesters. Here you
she thought.
Harry stared down at Emily so she stared back at him, quickly clearing her face of any emotion. His bright green eyes reminded her of the oak leaves resting in the summer sun in that golden field. "Ok, Emily, Hermione and Dumbledore have convinced me not to hand you over to the Ministry immediately, but that doesn't mean I can trust you."
“I- well, yes, but this is going to sound preposterous,” Emily admitted, looking up at him. “He's the Devil.”
Sam's voice seemed to have stopped working. "I... um... who are you?"
A jet of red light whooshed past his head, narrowly missing his shoulder. Harry ducked and ran even faster. More jets of light split the air around him, and a few wizards fell to the ground as Bellatrix’s spells struck them. Ahead of him, Tonk’s had reached a fireplace. She was gesturing at them and yelling something, but through all the noise Harry couldn’t hear her.
, she thought.
“You’re back, along with some of the same company,” he finally said, pulling up a chair in the middle of the room and placing his long fingers under his chin, leaning forward slightly.
"I'm a squib, dear, my options are limited. Just take
"Dean, we can't ask her that. You heard her before, she doesn't know anything. Leave her be."
“Hmmm… well, I’m no expert, but I think you’re missing something big. I mean, who the hell shot you? Do you think you made any enemies?”
Banner looked unhappy at this, but Loki was already standing up. "Come on Banner, let's go greet the patriot."
She walked into the flat, her feet making no sound on the large carpet spread across the floor. Two chairs faced each other parallel to the fireplace, a table to the side of one. A couch slumped against the wall nearest to the door, with a bright yellow smiley face spray painted on the wall above it. A skeleton bull's head was mounted on the wall across from her, a pair of headphones placed on its horns. The room led off to a little kitchen area and a door stood off to the side.
Tony turned to glare at him before focusing back on Emily. “Shut up, Rogers. Look, we’ve been looking for you for awhile now-”
Arya raised an eyebrow but didn’t try to perform anymore spells.
“It makes sense! Why would Moriarty actively draw attention to the bombings if he wasn’t trying to trick us? What if the key to Moriarty is through
“So this is where they are,” someone said softly behind her. Arya turned to see Hermione Granger standing in the doorway of the common room, her eyes on the two girls asleep on the couch.
Harry frown at her words. “Nothing, and that’s the problem. There has been no news besides more reports of dead people being alive again. Riddle has been completely silent so far and no one knows what’s happening.”
“Tell me then, because I certainly don’t."
“Ok. It’s just… well…”
"How did you get here, Emily?"
Loki, Lucifer, Moriarty- they all wanted something from here. She was beginning to see why. Her own mother was afraid of her. She had done something in the past, something important, and she needed to know what.
At that moment, a loud shout came from the room next to them, “I DON’T CARE WHAT THE
“Everyone here, besides you and your, um, friends, are part of the Order of the Phoenix. We fight against the dark arts,” Hermione told her, despite the frowns and muttering that came from the others. Clearly they disapproved of Emily getting to know their secret organization as much as they disapproved of her getting to know their names.
Harry stepped back, glancing over at Sam, who was still staring in astonishment at the decor. “Er... yeah. Ginny, what’s happening? Where are Ron and Hermione?”
happening right now. She can’t leave until we do.”
“No, Emily. I know you. You want to help these people, I do too. So we will.
Harry waited a moment before continuing. “I only brought a Muggle to Hogwarts because I believe he can help us find out how the dead came back.”
As soon as the angel was gone Emily plunked herself onto one of the chairs at the table, stretching out her legs and arms. Arya joined her, gracefully settling herself into the seat opposite her sister.
Dean turned to face him, cocking his head slightly. “You’re bleeding.”
“Why did you try and impersonate Dean? Are you working with Lucifer?” Sam demanded.
"Wait, I'm confused," she said, ignoring his question. "Why are you not calling the police to arrest me? Aren't I wanted for some crime?"
No matter what the Winchesters said, Emily did not feel "safe" in this cold, quiet bunker. If she was being hunted she needed to know exactly what was happening to her. She didn't think she would be able to accomplish that here.
“Er- who is this?” Draco asked to no one in particular as they sat down.
could tell her?
“Alright, let him go,” Rogers interrupted, dragging Emily off Thor. The girl threw back her head, staring at the ceiling, her feet dragging against the floor.
working with Moriarty?” Dean asked. “I mean, there can only be so many wizards in the world. Do you have any idea of who we’re up against?”
“So now the Ministry has Emily,” Cas said, still pacing. “What are we supposed to do now?”
His hand clutched an old newspaper that announced the official death of the demon of London. "A terror now in the ground," it said.
This one is long
"You will go to Midgard."
“Where is the other ring?” Arya demanded, the glow in her eyes more of a glare now.
“Fine," Emily snorted. "I don't need more enemies anyways."
“Wait,” said Emily, holding up her hand. “You said ‘was’. Why isn’t she queen anymore?”
Sam opened his mouth to answer but before he could, Professor Dumbledore walked over and shook his hand. “Mr. Winchester, I was wondering when you would come to us. It is an honour.”
“If there was any news about Riddle, we would know by now,” Ron said. “All the Aurors would, but Harry would be the first.”
Cas didn't move, but stared at the spot where the god had vanished. Dean took the angel's shoulders and made him face him. "Cas, who was that?"
Thor was still making plans with Stark when Banner got up from the table. "I'm gonna go talk to Cap. Make sure he knows what's up."
“What do we do if the wizards come back? The ones who took Emily and Harry, I mean,” said Sam.
“Harry! We’ve been waiting, what took you so long?” She looked over his shoulder and caught sight of Sam. “Is that a

magic, so they are not as helpless as Muggles.”
They drove for almost twenty minutes before they found the cottage. Small and quaint with weather beaten walls, the grey brick structure had an abandoned look one might find in ghost towns or dilapidated hospitals no longer in use. Sherlock felt melancholy just looking at it. Vines decorated with blood red roses from whence the place was named covered the walls, spiraling in wild patterns from their unrestrained growth over the years.
here, Malfoy? Don’t you have anything better to do?” Harry shot back.
As Mr. Weasley told them what had just occurred, the three pairs of eyes pinned on him grew wider and wider, until he feared they would pop right out onto the floor in front of him.
The man walked toward the door, then turned around. "Oh, and my name is Albus Dumbledore. Welcome to our world, Dragon Riders. You may find it lacking, but give it a chance and with a little bit of hope, I promise you will grow to love it. I do."
?" roared Eragon from the receiving end of the mirror. The blond Dragon Rider seemed to be taking the news pretty badly. Arya knew that he was thinking of his father, Brom, who had died a few years ago. Couple that with the fact that Eragon was still young and rather inexperienced, his reaction was poor to say the least.
“Death Eaters don’t use telephones,” Lupin mused. “It’s beneath them. Besides, we would know soon enough if they were lying. I’m going to talk to him.”
He kept staring at her. She thought he was going to yell at her, punch her, or starting going off about how terrible she was like everyone else had done so far.
“I'm on a road trip, figured I could use a break,” Dean said, draining half the glass with one gulp. The barman refilled the glass and Dean drained it again.
Arya nodded, knowing what he meant. The magic that flowed through Alagaesia, that flowed through them, felt comforting and natural compared to the magic of the other world. Midgard was flat compared to her home. Sure, there was magic in some places, but more in beings than in the essence of the world. Here, in Alagaesia, the very air shivered with magic. Nothing went untouched by it. She could feel the presence of those around her again, could summon fire and lightning and all sorts of spells. And best of all…
Emily and Arya visit their mother. Thor visits the cottage.
Emily looked at the newspaper she had gotten from the woman earlier. She had been examining at it all morning, but still couldn't process what she was reading. Under the headline was a picture of a smoking building, all in ruins. She read the article again.
Castiel led them down the row of rusty storage compounds, no one in sight. They stopped in front of one with a large red three on it. Leaning against the door was a tall, good looking man wearing a blazer over a white t-shirt, talking to a ginger woman sporting an ankle length black dress.
“That’s all he sent you?” John asked, raising an eyebrow to show his disbelief.
the elf thought, frowning.
A grin slowly emerged on Dean’s face. It wasn’t a smile Dean had ever made before. It was a grin of malice, of glee, of trickery.
caused all of this!”
Harry laughed as Ron finished another joke, his glasses almost falling off his face. Pushing them back on, he glanced around the Burrow, warm and homely as always. Ginny was talking to Hermione and Bill, her long red hair tucked in a neat braid down her back. They had been together ever since the Battle of Hogwarts ended three years ago, and were visiting the Burrow with Hermione and the rest of the Weasley family. It had been a long while since they had all been together, what with their new jobs and restoring the peace of the wizarding world and all. It was august, so Hogwarts would be starting a new term soon. Hermione was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and would be leaving soon to teach. Harry and Ron were taking a well earned break from their new jobs as Aurors, so the time to get together was well thought of.
A terse silence filled the bunker, unexpectedly broken by Dean’s booming laugh. He slapped Emily on shoulder and said, “You’re all right, kid.”
“Wait, Sam Winchester? How does he know you?
Arya turned away from her, facing Harry instead. "Will you bring a message to Eragon? Tell him I won't be back just yet. And if you'll let him stay, tell him to try and find out more about what's happening."
real. Stepping back Emily collapsed into her chair, the fire disappearing as fast as it had arrived in her shock.
Emily let out a small laugh at this. “Funny, too.”
“I’m Tony Stark, and that’s Steve Rodgers. We’re the Avengers.”
He was cut off by the phone. Sherlock must have answered it.
Arya stood up and held out her hand. Taking it, Emily was lifted onto her feet. Arya reached down and traced the star on Emily’s forehead. Sadness flickered her eyes as she gazed down at her sister.
After all, Arya had said his name. And a name was more than enough for the Queen to know what had happened. She knew who had killed Emily, who would try again, but she knew deep in her heart she didn’t have the strength to stop it. She had given her life for one daughter already. She didn’t have the strength to do it again.
Once upon a time, not so long ago, there were two hunters and an angel; a family created from pain and love. They died and cried and fought for one another more times than any single person could count. They hunted creatures of hatred and fear, never wavering in the face of death. No, death held no power over these three. They loved each other as families do, and fought just as much. But in the end, they always came back together. They always carried on. Family didn’t end in blood for them.
“Those men who found Emily,” Hermione remembered. “Didn’t she say they were trying to track the Devil? They might be able to help. Could you take us to the place where Dumbledore found you?”
“Come, you need rest. I’ll show you to your room.”
“Eragon, Malfoy. Malfoy, Eragon,” Ron said distractedly. “Eragon came back with Hermione and me, he’s here to help.”
There was a pause.
“But he told other Muggles about magic. Is he supposed to do that if magic is secret?”
she would read such a story, Robin would reply, “I like to see how the detective works it out. It’s not as exciting if I don’t get to see the detective’s thoughts!”
The two witnesses were seated on a garden wall worn through with rose vines. The vermillion flowers popped out of crevices and holes like an infestation long since resisted. The witnesses were talking to two police officers. At least, that’s what Sherlock thought at first glance. The officers were dressed strangely; who would be wearing cloaks like that in this weather? Or in any situation?
Ron shouted, rushing forward to better see his father.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s too late to turn back if we aren’t,” Hermione answered. She studied the blond man. He had followed them, two strangers he had met merely a day ago, into

“It’s so nice of you to join us! I knew you would come. But where’s Emily?”

Dean and Cas were silent for most of the drive back to the bunker. Dean had originally tried to draw some information out of Cas, like who the hell that man was and how he was connected to Emily, but Cas hadn't said a word. Now, Dean was worried about how Cas had reacted with the man, as though he
The man shrugged. "I dunno. One had blond hair, the other black. Both were askin' about that girl your friend was lookin' for."
“I’ll go with you,” Hermione said. “You’ll need help if the police are there, and I’m a Muggleborn.”
Emily made sure to direct her next woods at Harry, who was biting his lip, looking deep in thought. “I am not, was not, and never will be a Death Eater. That is not who I am, and if you cannot see that already, than I don’t know what else to tell you.”
“What do you mean for
Malfoy shrugged. “I don’t know. He only killed twelve people: five wizard families and three Muggles. Only two of those families didn’t betray him. The rest ran and rejected him during the Second war.”
I am an Angel of the Lord," Uriel said definitely.
Arya stood up, her gaze on the door. “What do we do now?”
“You can’t go
“How? The locks are enchanted, everyone knows that,” said Ron.
She heard Cas yell, “SAM, COME ON!” as she charged at the first wizard with her sword. Harry shot bolts of light out of his wand as she dodged and spun around, trying not to get hit by an offending spell. Arya sprang forward with her knife, swiping at the nearest offending wizard. Emily managed to stab one wizard in the kneecap, but as she pulled back her arm she felt a spell hit her in the shoulder, sending her to the ground. She lay on her back, paralyzed, her sword skidding away from her rigid hand.
“Yeah, we, uh, buried you with it,” Ron told him, putting down his cards and turning to look at Eragon, blinking fast. “Look, we know about as much as you. People who have died recently are now appearing again, exactly as they were before they died. They don’t have any scars, blemishes- nothing. Tonks and Lupin said the same thing as Fred.
“And we want to talk to you. Just talk, I promise.”
, and turned left. As she walked, Emily took the sword off of her back and attached it to her belt. Her back was starting to hurt from the bouncing of the heavy metal. She tried to concentrate on regaining a memory, any memory at all, but her mind was blank. The golden field was about an hours walk behind her, but Emily didn't want to stick around in that creepy place. It felt off there, like the world was slowly unbalancing under her feet.
like this before.”
Emily wanted to take Robin’s hands in hers. She wanted to wrap her arms around her and never let go. She wanted to run her hands through that tousled blue hair and kiss her until she forgot everything and everyone but the girl in front of her. But for now she had to content herself with staring into those piercing golden eyes, and tell her the truth.
but everyone seems to know me and mistrusts me for one reason or another. I don't know what is happening right now, and won't be able to unless everyone stops feeling
John nodded, his gaze sweeping the room, resting on the closed window. “Do you think she really lived here all alone? What about her mother, or her sister?”
The woman frowned slightly. “Well, I don’t know exactly. The last person I remember staying there was a girl, but I haven’t seen her in years and years.”
“Potter!” Emily exclaimed, surprised to see the wizard. “What are
“Are you
“I do, because I myself have met the Devil a long time ago. But, Miss Rose, how did you know it was him?”
“It’s not that simple,” Sherlock finally said, and everyone, including Cas, turned their attention to him. “I may not know anything about magic or spells, but I
She paused before answering, choosing her words carefully. "I met two men who told me I might be in danger, so I decided to try to get far away from where I appeared. I took a plane to London and wandered around until I met the man you found me talking to." She didn't even attempt to tell them about Loki, not until she could trust them.
Almost everyone in the room flinched at the name and some muttering broke out.
Ministry business, so we won't be breaking any rules, technically."
“This was given to me by my fellow students,” she continued. “I was in Slytherin while at Hogwarts, and I was one of the few who did not support Voldemort’s rise to power. There was a boy… I don’t remember his name anymore, but he was in Gryffindor. He was a bully. I came across a group of older Slytherins beating him up and tried to stop them. They petrified me and gave me this, as a reminder of my house and who I was ‘up against’, as they put it.”
Cas stared at him for a moment as if he wanted to say something else, then turned and disappeared into the depths of the doorway.
“Well then, do start.”
good that you have that.”
“WHERE IS HE?” Screamed Bellatrix Lestrange. “WHERE IS POTTER?”
Arya gave the woman the cloth her hair had been tied back with. “Here, take this and cover your mouth. As soon as you can, get out of here.”
Islandazi studied her face, green eyes taking in every inch of her daughter, from the star on her head to the dirt on her boots. She said nothing, just inspected her like a painting in a museum, trying to figure out the meaning behind the piece.
Zacharias smoothed back his hair, staring thoughtfully at her. “Put a band on her mouth, a fireproof one mind you, and tie her hands. It’ll be easier to transport her that way.”
“Cas, there you are. What took you so long?” a tall, skinny man in a dark blazer said. “I gathered everyone here, like you said. Charlie, Bobby, Gabriel, Ellen, Jo, Rufus, Rowena…”
caution at least. Don’t be hard headed.”
“Emily, that was an incredibly brave and
"Don't care," said Emily, starting to walk pass him.
Before Harry could answer the door to Emily’s cell swung open and out stormed the fiery girl. “Well? Are we going to get out of here or not?”
As she walked through the now quiet crowd of wizards, she wondered what they knew that she didn’t. Loki and Lucifer knew whatever it was too- she was sure of it. What if
Once upon a time, not so long ago, they were two brothers, inseparable it seemed by everything but time itself. Their natures differed as much as the sun and the stars, but even that couldn't stop their comradery. They fought as siblings do, tricked as friends do, and apologized as much as family can. They never gave up on each other, no matter what happened. They were brothers; they were family. A royal family, but a family nonetheless.
echoed through the empty halls of the bunker that drowned out the sound of her feet pounding along the floor.
Sam sat down at one of the tables, his mind too preoccupied for sleep. Professor Dumbledore sat down across from him, his eyes twinkling over half-moon spectacles. “Did you know that you are the first Muggle to enter Hogwarts in over seven hundred years?”
interrupted their conversation, causing the three to look up. A small, glossy black plane with a large blue
Now that he was right in front of them, Sherlock knew they were not the police. One had stormy grey eyes and platinum hair that made his already pale skin an almost sickly shade. The woman next to him had ebony skin and bushy brown hair the same colour as her eyes. They both were dark cloaks that concealed the rest of their clothes, but there was something else off about them. He felt the same unnatural aura seeping off of them as he had felt from Harry Potter and Emily Rose.
Cas flicked his arm and his angel blade landed in his hand. Dean drew his gun and pointed it at the man.
“What-” Emily began, then stopped as she heard it. A
Arya caught the suspicious look that faced over her sister’s face. It still pained her to look at Emily. She was overjoyed, of course, that her sister was not dead after all but rather alive and seemingly whole. Yet Emily was different. It wasn’t just the absence of her memories that had changed her. In spite of the loss, or maybe
John took a step forward and placed a hand on his shoulder to stop him. “Hold on. You don’t
Sam meets Thor. Arya finds Emily and reveals part of her past.
Hermione took it and examined it carefully. "You're a witch alright. This is a wand, which ever witch and wizard has. It's used as an instrument for our magic. Most wizards can't perform magic intentionally without a wand." She gave it back to Emily and they continued walking.
Emily shook her head, deep in her mind.
The blonde man nodded. “Yeah. Sorry, but you might have to come back later. Sherlock isn’t here right now and I don’t know when he’ll be back.”
"So there are four houses here," Hermione explained as they started back to the great hall. "Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin."
“Oh, yeah,” Sam said, his face paling. “Yeah, uh, I remember.”
Robin Felix was slightly shorter than Emily, with cobalt blue hair cut in the style of a boy. Large, golden eyes were set against her dark brown skin. She wore all blue- a blue shirt, a dark blue jean jacket, blue jeans, and blue sneakers. Around her neck hung a golden chain upon which was a silver ring engraved with intricate designs. Emily remembered that ring very well. It was one of the reasons she was sitting here, holding hands with the blue-haired girl.
had bombed two of London’s most prominent buildings in a span of two days while being closely supervised (most the of time). Still, the tiny embers of suspicion and doubt lay in every one of them, ready to ignite at the slightest provocation. Not only that, but there was definitely something going on with her. It was no coincidence that she was back along with the rest of the dead. Loki and Lucifer did not target her on a whim.

, her mind whispered.
Loki looked out of the window, his breath fogging up the glass. His shoulder was freezing cold from its contact with the window, but he stared out at the grounds anyways. His green and gold leather armor was splattered with mud and now melted frost from when Stark had knocked him to the ground.
Sam shot Cas a
Islanzadi’s dark eyes stared straight into Emily’s as she said, “You have changed much since I last saw you. Then again, you were dead. And not much longer after that, so was I. How, I wonder, do the two of us sit here- cadavers as animate as Arya?”
"Cas! Finally, I've called you like six times. What happened? You alright?"
Emily was opening gaping at the witch. “How- how did you
But no, he could never ask Dean such a question. The hunter was many things, but not that. Not…
“I see,” was Kingsley’s reply.
Cas dropped down to the wide room, his eyes never leaving Lucifer’s face. “She’s not here.”
Balthazar nodded. “Yup.” He had a British accent, mixed with a slightly French pronunciation on the hard consonants. “Been trying to find you. Heaven is a
, that Cas was fascinated with. Perhaps it was his constant rebellion to God’s divine plan; to reject anyone who told him what to do because it was his destiny. The ability to find another way even if it destroyed him (which it often did), was something Cas rarely saw in humans. Not to mention the constant devotion to his family.
Rowena's appearance confirmed his suspicion that other people were coming back from the dead. He looked at the witch and sighed. Cas owed Rowena for saving his life, he couldn't turn her down now.
“Here in the United Kingdom, we do not suffer from Muggles inflicted with these ‘monstrous’ aspects. The British Men of Letters, a secret organization of 'monster' hunters, has long since purged the non-magical community of any werewolves, vampires, and the like. In America, however, there is not as much restriction. Muggle monsters prey on their defenseless neighbors, and the only force left to stop them are hunters such as the Winchesters. Though until recently they remained ignorant of our magical world, their experiences have introduced them to
“What the bloody hell
He smirked slightly. "Not many things are at the moment."
A very muscular, very tall man was angry at Sam for some reason, and in all his years as a hunter, Sam had never faced anyone like him. The man was scary.
Cas glanced at Dean, who seemed the most calm in the room. In fact, he didn’t look scared at all, but rather mildly intrigued, as though this were a play being acted out on stage.
and turned to see a black car speeding
Emily flicked it again.
“What else is new,” Cas grumbled, grabbing his arm. “Let’s go.”
“Hmmm,” answered Dean, casting Harry an appraising glance.
"I woke up about two hours ago in a field without a single memory. I only know my... my name."
Dumbledore stepped forward. “Let’s not fight about this now. The Order of the Phoenix is looking into the murders even if the Ministry isn’t. Mr. Malfoy, we welcome your help and offer you our sympathies, but to win we must not quarrel with one another. If you wish to leave, you may do so at any time, but we would be most grateful if you would stay and
Dumbledore raised a hand for silence. “Miss Rose, you said you have no memory, so how do you know that this really was the Devil?”
“That’s the woman who came in with Emily and that man,” said the doctor.
Dean did as the angel suggested, but no answer. He tried the number four more times and no one picked up. "Damn it," he muttered. "We better track the phone."
“Wait, hold on,” Arya said. “Now you’re being hunted? We must leave for home
? What if she can tell us what happened with Fred and Riddle?"
Sherlock frowned. “And where did she go after she rescued the boy?”
"Hogwarts?"
Hermione glanced over at Ron. His expression was uneasy, clouded with doubt. However, if they wanted to find Sam and Dean, they had to help Cas.
“Well, I-I-” Mr. Weasley stammered, fumbling with his glasses.
“Not much. This case is getting stranger and stranger the more I dig into it.”
“Do you still want to come?” Cas asked.

Everyone was staring at her now. They all seemed weary, as though just realizing how much they didn't know about her. It was as if they had put all worry and suspicion aside to come together and distrust
“That’s it?” Mycroft let out a tiny sigh, looking relieved. “Well, partly. I believe she may have a hand in this.”
Cas nodded. He knew Dean and Sam didn’t stand a chance against highly trained wizards, but Emily, Arya, and Harry might. He tried to step closer to Dean but stopped as the wizards in the doorway pointed their wands at the small crowd.
“Yeah, well, we found her.”
don’t know.”
Arya hesitated, then stepped forward and placed a hand on her mother’s arm. “Mother, I have done as you asked. I entered Midgard and found that what is happening here is occurring there as well. And I have brought my sister home.”
Emily's silver eyes were shining with rage and flames flickered along her arms and torso, not burning her clothes or skin. She glared around the room, everyone quailing under her fierce gaze.
“We need to destroy the rings, don’t we?” asked Arya. She was still staring straight at Emily with those gleaming green eyes, an intense fire focused on one narrow target.
am not going to sit around until someone tries to come kill me.” She didn’t care about their decision anyways. Even if they had decided she was guilty, she would have just run away.
Emily had read the article about Sherlock Holmes. He had solved some of London's most puzzling cases and had gotten famous over the internet along with John Watson, a former army doctor. Emily wasn't scared of him though. From what the papers said, he didn't seem to have any special powers like those angels who had been chasing her. He was just really smart. Besides, she was in America, far away from him.
"But you knew that already," drawled Moriarty, never turning from the window. "That's why you're here. I assume you want something?"
Arya pressed a finger to her lips and slipped past Hermione, closing the door behind her. Emily deserved a few more hours of that precious peace. It was the least Arya could give her.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Oh.”
"I want the same thing you do," said Loki, who sounded unnerved, as he always was around the criminal. He had that affect on people. "Revenge."
“What about Loki? He was the one who impersonated Dean, and Lucifer admitted that he knew of it.
Arya walked over and knelt next to Cas. She placed a warm hand on his head. A moment later, the pain vanished and he felt his eye unswell.
"Oh, I did nothing to Emily. She was the one who hurt me, she declined my kind offer of help. My poor feelings. I think she's getting to be a bit suspicious, but maybe it's just bad influence," the man sighed. "But you," he leaned forward, his face right in front of Cas's. "How do
“Is that Dean?” she asked softly.
“Was it a man or woman?” Sherlock demanded.
Cas jumped up from his seat, his heart pounding. Dean looked up from his book, frowning slightly. "You okay there, Cas? You seem a little spooked."
“Just watch, Sherlock.”
“Nothing matters but you, Robin,” Emily whispered. “Just say the world and we’ll leave. We’ll run so far away that no one will be able to find us again. We’ve been given another chance to be together. Let’s not waste it.”
alike, except one was missing his left ear. Across the table from her was Dumbledore.
Stark was staring at Emily with an appraising look. “So let’s get everyone on the same page. Monsters and supernatural creatures are real, as well as the Devil. Loki escaped and immediately went after Emily, who ran away and ended up in London with those two,” he pointed at Arya and Harry. “Yeah, by the way, gods exist too. Two bombings have happened since you came back from the dead, Emily, and in the more recent one we found you right in front of the building. You were known, before you died, as the suspected bomber of Shell Centre but were never caught. There has been only
Emily turned to Robin and said, “Can I see your ring, please?”
The guards stopped and no one made a sound. "Oh, didn't you know? Emily Rose is back, and all of this is her fault," laughed Uriel, his blue eyes boring in Kingsley's brown ones.
“Not so fast. Before anyone leaves, we need to figure out what to do with
“Zacharias,” Harry pleaded to him, and Emily’s gaze moved to rest on the green eyed wizard. So Harry knew this man? “Don’t do this. Hear me out and this will all make sense, I promise.”
This is just the intro for the story, it really begins next chapter. Please comment or something I would love to know what people think.
“You slipped away for a moment,” John frowned. He opened his mouth as though to continue, but thought better of it.
“Where did you find this, exactly?” the old headmaster asked. His voice was quiet but full of some emotion Eragon couldn’t identity. It scared him.
No. This had to be some sort of screen, enabled to play a gif of some kind over and over again. It was not, as some tiny part of his brain (the
did this, so we have to take charge. It's the Ministry's job to quiet magical threats."
The sky outside was slowly turning a pinkish hue when they pulled into the gas station. Next to it was a small bar that seemed to still be open. They got out of the Impala, stretching and groaning as they popped their stiff joints.
The other ministry workers glared at her and murmured under their breath. They did not approve of her snarky attitude.
“I don’t know,” Emily simply answered.
Hermione glared at him. “Four, and there’s no need to get suspicious about the last one. Apparently the one in New York was traced back to James Moriarty, the other suspect in the Heron Tower bombing. He could have done the other two as well.”
She gave her the article and Emily read through it. Most of the article talked about how this was all some big plot of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to spread fear throughout the nation. There was a description of “

Emily stared at him. “I wouldn’t know even if I did, but I don’t think wizards use guns, so whoever killed me probably didn’t attend Hogwarts.”
"You're not here to see me?" Sherlock questioned.
she thought.
Sherlock tossed a book over his shoulder, continuing to search through the boxes. “There is no logical reason for this, none at all. I doubt they are telling the truth, but that just makes the case all the more

"Damn it, Cas."
Arya stepped forward. "You can not. We must bring Emily home, right now. We need to fix this 'dead rising' problem."
Ok, maybe it had been reckless going to the city where she was being hunted, but Emily had wanted to get away from Loki and hiding in plain sight seemed like her best option at the moment. She had sneaked onto a plane the other night from the nearest airport and had been wandering the streets ever since. Besides, as long as she was here, she could try to dig up some research on that bombing she was convicted of.
As they followed the pale haired man, Hermione wondered if this was such a good idea. She didn’t dislike Eragon- he was actually quite a nice guy- but she didn’t fully trust him either. He was a stranger to them; a non wizard in a sea of problems that might just swallow them up. She wondered if following him was the right thing to do.
“You have changed. You are not the girl you once were.”
Emily joined her at the table. “Was I?”
His troubled expression told her that he was getting increasingly desperate. If the dead were really back for good, with the Devil and a dark wizard at the lead, than old rules didn’t apply. Surviving was all that mattered.
“Hold on,” Hermione interrupted, pointing at the driver. “Who are you? How do you know Eragon?”
Harry and Ron were chatting in their office when Kingsley arrived. Fred had returned to the Burrow so that he could tell the other Weasleys about what had happened, and Hermione was waiting outside for them. Hopefully, Ginny would start to gather as many Order of the Phoenix members as she could. If Voldemort was back they needed to be prepared.
Maybe it will help get my memory back.”
is using bombs? Why hasn’t
Mycroft stared at his brother, frozen, his eyes wide. “How do you know about her?”
“I-in Hell, in a room filled with papers. It was on top of this folder, but I don’t know what was inside it. Why? What does it mean?”
"Who... who are you?" she asked, confused. Apparently, she didn't know who he was.
The woman walked until she was right in front of Emily, her eyes not leaving her face. She placed one graceful hand on Emily's cheek.
of the facts.
"Emily," she breathed. There was something so familiar about her, so close, that Emily could feel her heart breaking in two as she stared at the woman.
Hermione's mouth fell open. "You were having a cup of tea with the man who is supposed to bring you in on
Her mother did not answer immediately. Instead, her eyes trailed the path of a bright blue butterfly as it passed over their heads, landing on a nearby flower. "During the end of that battle, when I knew I was going to die, I thought about the day you were born. You were a tiny baby, and were so light I thought the wind might carry you away. Your father had never been so happy. He held you in his arms so gently, so softly. You looked so peaceful there. I knew I would do anything necessary to keep that peace there. We elves pride ourselves on our advanced brains, but even we must sometimes succumb to emotion. During that battle, I thought of your peaceful face that day, and knew that the only way to keep you safe was to give myself to the void. To death. So I did."
He sighed, resting his instrument at his side. Maybe a change in scenery would help him think. He opened his door, stepped out into the kitchen, and stopped short.
Harry sighed and stared down at the bacon. It was arranged into a smiley face, but the end of one of the pieces was broken off so it formed a little bacon smirk instead. “Believe me, I know. But we still don’t know how the dead are back and I can’t concentrate on anything else. I mean, no one’s ever done this before. What could have happened?”
He looked down and noticed a white slip of paper peeking out from under the gun. Frowning, he picked it up and smoothed out the wrinkles. The only thing written on it was:
THINKS IS BEST, HE’S COMING FOR US ALL AND YOU KNOW IT!”
," Sherlock roared, jumping up from his chair. "What is the matter with you? She's-"
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked.
John raised an eyebrow at Sherlock, who resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He didn’t need a look to register the significance in the woman’s words.
“Arya.”
Harry Apperated on the side of a road in America, his wand at the ready. The Ministry had sensed an alert here and had sent them, the Aurors, to investigate. Kingsley thought that the person they were looking for, some convict girl, might be here. The setting sun blinded his eyes for a moment, too bright against the blue sky. Fields of golden grain waved at him from behind a fence, their tall stalks visited by dragonflies and other insects. Ron appeared next to him, looking around in bewilderment. "Bloody hell, what happened here?"
Islanzadi lifted one regal eyebrow in response, then turned her attention toward Ayra. “I presume you were not able to discover the source of this… occurrence, while in Midgard?”
He made his way to the gas station where his car was parked and decided to pay it a visit. It was a small, dingy store with no customers. The person behind the counter, an old man with almost no hair on his head, looked up as he entered.
Thor’s eye were full of suspicion and unfounded anger. “How
Hermione studied the blue eyed man, talking in his well worn clothes and tousled hair. He
Emily knew she hadn't bombed Heron Tower. But from what the paper said, she had been found laughing in the center of the first bombing scene. Had she really done that all those years ago? Was she a killer? She didn't think so, didn't want to believe that she was capable of something like that. But the fact remained that she couldn't remember.
Emily followed her sister out of the palace and through the forest. The morning was brisk and light, and a slight breeze rippled through the trees. Try as she might Emily couldn’t spot a single elf, and wondered where they were.
“It's just- Voldemort always wanted to be the center of attention. He never tried to hide what he'd done if everyone already knew he was at power. This murder, so soon after those bombings… it's like he doesn't even know they
"Spooky," mumbled Stark.
yourself.”
Emily held it up so that everyone could see the ring clearly. “I enchanted a set of rings Robin and I gave one another to bring me back from the dead. Mine was gold, hers silver. They were intended to represent our shared bond. However, I think part of the enchantment malfunctioned. My ring was, to put it simply, connected to death so that it could be activated when I died. Robin’s ring is connected to life, so that the spell had an anchor to pull me toward. When Robin died right after me, the spells on each ring must have been canceled out, so I was stuck in death. Something, or someone, must have activated one of the rings to bring me back, but how the enchantment also brought back millions of others…. I just don’t know.”
