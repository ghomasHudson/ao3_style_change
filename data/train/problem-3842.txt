"You weren't well?" hissed Castiel. "Do you know how I was? I was left by you for a book. Do you know how cheap I felt? I loved you, Dean. With everything I had. I wanted to spend my life with you." Tears welled up in Castiel's eyes. "I would have left my family because of you. I was going to ask you to marry me. Do you understand?" Castiel looked down at the floor for a moment, then glanced at Dean.
"Oh come on, we're all drunk anyway. It'll all be forgotten later." Gabriel struck a conciliatory tone. Then he turned and looked at Sam. "Winchester, I'm right, aren't I?"
He hooked his fingers into Dean's belt loops, pulling him even closer so that they were pressed together from the waist down. Dean was so surprised by this new closeness that he released himself from Cas breathing heavily and looked at him slightly intimidated. Cas smiled and used the new freedom to change places. Now Dean was pressed against the wall. Cas looked at Dean briefly to assure himself that it was okay for him, but the only thing he could see was this newly awakened lust. He kissed Dean hungrily and stroked Dean's lower lip with his tongue to get admission. Dean granted and also opened his legs a bit so Cas could put a leg in between. This touch was also unknown and Dean gasped. He separated himself from Cas, closed his eyes and let his head sink against the wall.
When they separated after a short time and looked at each other now, anyone could have believed that the stars had moved from the sky and sparkled in their eyes. In the background, the chorus ran for the last time.
The clock was already showing half past eight, but Cas waited patiently. He had left his trench coat in the room today, knowing how much Dean liked him without the coat.
"What the hell?"
"No, I don't. Sure, there's a certain amount of 'getting to know each other again' involved, but I believe in us. You know what I mean? If there was nothing more between us, I could have sent you away earlier without a second thought. You probably wouldn't have even come here. So. I don't know about you, but I'm going back home today. You're welcome to come with me, and it doesn't have to be permanent yet, but I want to get out of here."
It had been five years since Dean had broken up with him. And he could not talk about it with anyone until today, because Dean was still in the closet. Their relationship had never been public and that was also the reason why Castiel suffered so much. He would have liked a hug, but he had promised Dean at the time to keep quiet.
"No. Not really." Pause.
Castiel backed away, letting Dean enter. Dean closed the door, grinned briefly, pulled Castiel to him, spun them around, and pressed Castiel against the door. Their lips met and they kissed until they couldn't breathe. Then Dean broke away and looked at Castiel.
They went back to their old room, grabbed their things and headed of to the next floor for the new rooms. Dean's room was on the opposite from Sam's, so they said good night and parted ways.
"I told you I missed you. Hey, what's up? The music's not playing?!" Cas released himself completely from their embrace and went to the vinyl record player. The smile disappeared.
"Cas?" asked Dean quietly. "Can you give me your address?"
It wasn't the first blow job he'd had, but the mere thought that it was Cas this time made his pelvis involuntarily pop up. Cas gagged slightly, he probably hadn't expected it.
"No, I don't care. Now go," Castiel replied irritably. "And don't call me 'Cas' anymore, that time is over."
Cas recognized the melody immediately, smiled and closed his eyes.
"We need to-" He gasped, Dean had reached under his ear and was sucking lightly. "We need to talk, Dean."
He got up, showered, and made his breakfast in a good mood. According to the time, it was more like brunch, but he didn't mind. He sat down at the kitchen table and looked out at the courtyard. The sun was reflected in the blue water of the large swimming pool.
Cas sat up and Dean opened the box. In it was a dark brown wooden ring, similar to the one Cas shown earlier, parted by a single blue line.
"Dean?" asked Castiel softly.
"I made a promise to myself, Cas. Since you are
„Cas, you mean everything to me. When you're there, I feel like I can feel everything all at once. Love, friendship, trust, sadness, passion, desire, security... I wish you would never leave me again. We had good times and bad times and we will continue to have them, but with you as a steady point on my side, I feel safe and can look more positive into the future.So-“ Dean took a deep breath and opened a small box that he had been hiding in his hand the whole time and Cas opened his eyes and mouth.
Castiel stood with his back to Dean and seemed not to have heard him.
"No, Dean. It wasn't just a kiss then, and it isn't just a kiss now!"
"Cas Love Tracks" was on it, and something else that made Dean smile. Cas had written "To Dean" very neatly in Enochian. Dean shook his head in amusement. "Oh, Cas," he sighed softly. Then he got up, got dressed quickly, picked up the mixtape and the flowers and went into the kitchen.
Castiel turned and looked out the window. Just like Dean had done a few hours before. Tears ran silently down his face.
Jack had backed out by now and Sam... Sam had slipped from the bed to the floor and was crying uncontrollably again. He missed Dean. He missed the brother and best friend he'd always had at his side. He missed the little taunts, the gloating comments, Dean's music, Dean's food, even Dean's long showers. It had always been a sign that he was not alone. Those rare little touches. Sometimes a hand on the arm, sometimes on the shoulder. What would Sam give to get one last hug from his big brother?!
He had discovered a place that night that he had never shown to anyone before, not even Sam or Cas. It was a place just for him, he thought. But today it was about to change. He was gonna show Cas that special place. He had something planned…
Cas sighed softly and released himself from the embrace. He stepped back a little, put one hand on Dean's face and smiled at him.
„Dean, what- Wow-“ Cas didn't know what to say at all. All around the lake, lights went on. It looked like a giant halo. Just across from them, a big white banner suddenly appeared. Behind the banner, a very bright light shone towards them, while a darker light, from somewhere below them, shone towards the brighter light. In the middle they met and formed a kind of threshold.
"Hey, Dean." Castiel laughed nervously. Dean looked at him with an icy stare, then walked toward the hall closet and picked up his jacket.
„You have a point“, he said, smiling at Dean.
The argument that followed had ended with two bloody noses and an angry and disappointed Castiel. Wondering if all the whispered words of love had meant nothing, he had walked out of Dean's apartment and out of their, until then, shared life.
"No, thanks. You have helped me a lot. Thank you very much."
"Ssh." Castiel's hand was still stroking him in a lazy motion but he tightend his grip a little bit. "Let me show you how sorry
𝕋𝕙𝕒𝕟𝕜 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕤𝕠 𝕞𝕦𝕔𝕙 𝕗𝕠𝕣 𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕕𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕤𝕥𝕠𝕣𝕪. 💙 𝕀𝕗 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕗𝕠𝕦𝕟𝕕 𝕤𝕠𝕞𝕖𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕥𝕙𝕒𝕥 𝕓𝕠𝕥𝕙𝕖𝕣𝕤 𝕪𝕠𝕦, 𝕡𝕝𝕖𝕒𝕤𝕖 𝕝𝕖𝕥 𝕞𝕖 𝕜𝕟𝕠𝕨.
"Do you picked this day randomly to ask me or does it have a deeper meaning for you? For me it has. Three years and three days ago we got together. So three and three, I thought it made sense. How about you?"
‚Cas, turn around‘ was written on the banner.
Now Dean turned to his right side, he didn't want to get up yet. There was something on Cas's pillow, but with his eyes not yet fully open he couldn't see what it was. He rubbed his eyes a few times and then leaned on his elbows. What he saw now astonished him. He blinked and looked again. In fact...
While he himself could have spoken the film from memory, everything had been new and exciting for Cas. Dean had watched him through the film. He had sat cross-legged on the floor, leaned his head on his arms and watched the action on the screen with his mouth slightly open and his cheeks red.
Dean sat up straight again and wiped the tears from his face. "Isn't life a bittersweet melody?", he asked himself. "At the time, Cas told me that if everyone else had left, he would be the only one by my side. And now", Dean smiled sadly, "now everyone else is here and he is gone. What an irony."
And this is exactly what he tried to remember. Because what he wanted to tell Dean was something he had kept to himself for far too long and secondly it was very upsetting. He had done something to bring 'their' Jack back to the brothers. Cas was hoping that with the food and stuff to keep Dean calm. He knew that the hunter could become very passionate in all areas. Cas also had a gift for Dean.
This time he had really screwed up.
Everywhere were burning candles, rose petals on the floor like like a trace. He closed the door and followed the petals. When he stood before the bed he wondered if maybe he got the wrong room. On the bedcover, written in more rose petals, was a heart and in the heart he could read '
Castiel smiled happily and got into the car. He would now start the drive to Lafayette with the certainty that Dean was back. It would take a few days, but then....
But since Sam rarely left his room, Jack waited until Sam had fallen asleep. He knew that he now only had a few minutes before Sam would wake up again through a nightmare. He had seen that happen.
"Come on", Cas whispered, and they walked to the middle of the clearing. There he settled down and pulled Dean down with him. They lay side by side now, looking up at the sky.
"101 Glouchester Road, Lafayette, Louisiana 70506, It's called Willow Gardens."
"Cas?"
"Aren't you even interested in how I found you?" Dean sounded cautious.
"Cas, please." He begged but Castiel only pulled him closer.
When Castiel's first finger pushed in he sighed but also tensed up. Castiel kissed his neck and then under his earlobe.
2) A daisy can be found everywhere so it was easier despite the fact that they were at a motel and it would be a little bit weird if Dean had found white roses or something similar in its meaning.
What Dean didn't tell Castiel, however, was that he would be on his way right away. He was going to call his boss and see if he could go on vacation a week early. That way, he and Castiel would have more time to get their lives back in order.
„The song doesn't fit“, said Cas and Dean looked at him.
Sam and Eileen stood at the stove. Eileen at the pot and Sam behind her. He had both arms wrapped around her middle and whispered something in her ear. She turned her head slightly and looked at Sam in a dreamy way. He smiled at her.
"Say hello to me-" Castiel whirled around, his face contorted angrily. He walked toward Dean. "Say hello to me?"
Dean took a photo of the bouquet and was about to send it when he remembered that it was total nonsense. He read the message again. Something confused him.
"Yeah, how could you. You only had your career in mind, after all."
Meanwhile they had finished eating and Dean thanked them for the nice idea. Cas smiled. He loved it when Dean was happy, and right now he was.
could be heard, Cas turned to Dean.
„Just turn around, please. You'll see.“
"You're such an ass, Castiel!" Dean was really yelling now. "I'm doing everything here. I'm bringing in the money so we can afford all this shikie-mickie stuff. This big apartment, new designer clothes, new cell phones. All so my 'honey' can be happy." He pronounced the word 'honey' with such disdain that Castiel looked up. "And you? You just squat on the sofa and have your hands elsewhere immediately when I have little time for you. Was she the only one, Cas? Mmh?"
"Ugh... Cas-", he whispered, eyes filled with lust.
„Dean, this is--“
"I missed you, you know?" Cas muttered, his head resting on Dean's shoulder.
"We've been together for three years now and 'though it was a well hidden secret and I could've never shown you in public, I'm so glad you were by my side through this times. So many nights I laid alone in hotel rooms and wished you were there so that we could've talked, watched TV, cuddled or done so much more.
Things like that, which seem rather cruel and reckless, were Dean's way to show them how much he loved them.
Cas's voice had become low and Dean stared straight out the window. He couldn't believe that what he heard here was real.
It was way past midnight when Castiel woke up. He had a headache and felt exhausted. He sat down and saw that Gabriel had fallen asleep in the armchair across from him. He got up and went to the kitchen to heat up the pasta from yesterday. Halfway through, however, he turned around, went back and took the letter.
In this list were: 'Dirty Dancing', 'Gone with the Wind', 'The Notebook', 'Pretty Woman', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'When Harry met Sally...', 'Out of Africa', 'Notting Hill', 'City of Angels' and of course 'Titanic'. But their absolute favourite of the 30 or so films they rented was 'Bodyguard'. Therefore it is not surprising for Dean that the song of Whitney Houston was included.
"I'm ignoring you? That's funny, I could say the exact same thing," Castiel replied, suddenly very serious and tense. "You're always just working, coming home late, who knows where you are-"
Dean was shocked. Cas normally sparkling eyes looked tired and showed no sign of hope.
Cas leaned on his elbow, pressed Dean's head so that he could reach him and kissed him.
"I thought you got lost", Dean said softly and smiled. Cas could do nothing but stare at Dean.
Cas got up and looked at Dean through his eyelashes.
"Relax, Dean," Castiel said softly. As soon as Dean did it he moved his finger in and out, slowly. Dean's breath came through his open mouth and his fingers curled the sheets.
With the ending, I wanted to give Sam the normal life he always wished for.
"Cassie-"
Dean was all the more surprised not to find Castiel there. He shrugged his shoulders and went on to the kitchen. Here he was even more surprised. Castiel, who loved order and cleanliness, had literally left a garbage room. Dean shook his head in wonder.
And that was all he could say, because all he could think of to say was moan. Cas had put him in his mouth without warning.
After dinner, he cleaned up and packed his suitcase. Laundry and toiletries would be enough for a week. He wouldn't want to stay longer than that, if he could even stand it that long. Tomorrow he would be on his way.
"You mean- You're asking if I'm serious about the man I first saw when I was a teenager in school, the man I met again in college, the man who showed me what it could be like to be with another man, the man who helped me through every hard time, the man I couldn't imagine as a better partner and father to our children, the man I love more than anything-" Dean had to catch his breath. "You're asking if I'm serious about marrying this man? Of course I'm serious!"
After the phone call, it was to take a full two days for Jack to locate Eileen.
Before all the turmoil started, Dean and Castiel had talked about it and both had agreed that they would make it through the four months.
"And you're perfect." Dean kissed his cheek and then whispered in Castiel's ear. "And it's so cute that I can still make you blush after all these years."
Of course, Castiel had to pass Gabriel on his way out. The guests, except for Meg and Sam, had all left. Meg stepped into his path first.
"Sorry, Cas, but after that phone call tonight, I left right away."
"Turn to your side." Dean obeyed.
"Dean, I missed you!", Cas said quietly. "And I'm sorry for my surprising arrival here but I couldn't wait any longer." Dean chuckled and pushed himself on to his elbow.
"You know what, Gabe? I'm really surprised you didn't bring 'him' here. After everything you've done here. You probably wanted to start small first by bringing his brother here. But it doesn't work like that. You may have had good intentions when you lured me here, but I can't trust you anymore. You promised it..."
"Oh-" That's all I could hear.
When they calmed theirselfes after it enough that they could talk in a normal way, they turned to their sides so they could look at each other.
"Dean, please don't cry. I never really belonged to you, you're too good for me. I love you, you know that but my time has come. I'm sorry for the pain and the tears I caused you but I promise you'll forget me by and by. You'll live on, laugh again and meet someone new. Someone worthy of your companionship, your warmth, your love."
"Thank you", mumbled Dean and almost flew out the door. A lot of people in the class looked at him in bewilderment. That wasn't really Dean's style.
Now he noticed that there was no more music playing. He took out the cassette and looked. More than half of the tape was played. Dean frowned, put it back in, and rewound a little bit. Nothing. "Hmm," he did, repeating the process until the end of the tape was reached. He took the tape out, turned it over, and put it back in.
Cas came running just two minutes after the bell rang. Dean went ahead and had just disappeared around the corner when Cas caught up with him and pushed him powerfully against the wall.
"You're just incorrigible." He kissed Dean, and now it was Dean who turned them back.
When he sang the last sentence he looked towards his brother again as if he wanted to say it to Cas. Cas got goose bumps and smiled again. He loved Dean so much.
"Wow, isn't that a little unfair?"
In the kitchen, he reached behind the refrigerator and pulled it forward a bit. Behind it were loose wooden boards from the wall. He pushed one aside, reached in and pulled out a small black box. This was where 'it' had been well kept, Castiel didn't trust electronics and would never have moved the refrigerator.
Dean wasn't angry, to be honest he was relieved Cas had told them his secret. But Dean was more than disappointed that Cas hadn't told it earlier. Now they didn't have enough time left to figure out a plan that could save Cas.
Arriving at his car, he was astonished. A daisy and a folded note were stuck under the windshield wiper. Castiel put his suitcase in the trunk, went back and took the flower and note. The daisy he tucked behind his ear, the note he opened. He remembered that Dean had always carried a notebook with him. Then he began to read.
How much he had missed Dean...
Dean wasn't someone who said
"I can't tell you the young man's name, but you observed it correctly. He and I were even a couple until his career became more important to him." What Dean had written in the letter he concealed. Somehow he doubted Dean had meant it.
It wasn't a long act but it was an act full of love and passion. Afterwords both men were lying panting and exhausted between the sheets and pillows. Sated and far more than happy, Dean snuggled against Cas. Cas pulled Dean even closer and placed a light kiss on his head.
"Fuck," Dean breathed, burying his hands in Castiel's hair while Castiel rested his on Dean's hips. Their erections lined up, Castiel thrusted up in a slow move.
"Yes?"
"Cas?"
As Sam kissed Eileen, Jack cleared his throat. The two adults looked at him.
"Cas, it wouldn't change anything." Dean answered as quietly as Cas.
It started in the spring.
Back in his bedroom, he turned on his cell phone. He had a message from Meg and one from Gabriel. Meg's was nothing more than 'maybe we'll see each other again', while Gabriel's was 'PLEASE get in touch. We need to talk.' But Castiel ignored them. Yes, maybe he had overreacted, but Gabriel had broken his promise. That hurt. He lay back in bed and turned off the light.
"I missed you," whispered Castiel.
"What's wrong?" Dean's voice sounded so loud it sounded like he was lying next to him. Castiel swallowed.
I love you' very often. To be honest he never said it. But Cas knew that with everything Dean did, he told it.
He shook his head briefly, got up, and put his plate in the sink. Then he grabbed a jacket and went to the car.
Sam sat in his room, but he forgot to close the door. Jack, who had dared to go into the library and read his book very quietly, suddenly heard a song. He followed the very sad melody and stopped at Sam's door. Sam sat with his back to the hall and therefore could not see Jack.
Dean sat back down in his seat while Cas turned on the vinyl record player. They could have used one of their mobile phones, but Cas thought that wasn't appropriate.
The boy went, without looking at Dean, to the toilets. Dean, who stood bent over a sink, looked at Cas in the mirror questioningly. Cas shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.
Dean tugged impatiently at Cas's coat, which straightened up, took it off and was immediately back with Dean. He stroked down Dean's upper body with his hand and this time stopped just above the belt. He let his hand slide under Dean's shirt. Dean, who had not yet been touched by Cas at this spot, raised his hand towards him. As they were no longer directly on top of each other but slightly offset, his already slightly swollen member pressed against Cas' hip. The relieving pressure made him groan again. He repeated the movement and surprised Cas. He then released himself from Dean's lips with a soft groan and Dean took the opportunity to switch places.
"Dean, you feel so amazing", Cas moaned. He pulled out a bit and went back in. Dean groaned and bit in Cas's lower lip.
"But, you never showed anything to indicate that."
He went back to the bedroom, where his private desk was. In the left drawer were still things from the relationship with Dean. Letters, small souvenirs, a disposable camera and a frame.The frame contained his favorite photo of the two of them. It was taken when they had met, before they had really gotten together.
Then he left the house and his, for one day returned, old life.
"Cas, please don't get scared now but actually have a plan... When we are in London we have an appointment at the London Eye. Sam and me get in to a gondola. You, your best man and a pastor coincidentally will come in there too. After two rounds the wheel will stop with our gondola on the top.
Dean noticed how his lower abdomen reacted, even more than before. He slid his arms under Cas's coat and pulled the boy even closer. Cas increased the pressure of the kiss, which finally took Dean's breath away.
"All right, Cas. I want you to go to sleep now. Thank you for telling me all this. Really. Thank you for trusting me." He stopped short. "When you wake up again, the world will look very different, I promise."
Sam was getting thinner and thinner and looked more tired every day. He couldn't even be there for Jack, who had lost the only father he had ever had. He knew that Jack was sad, and he was suffering the loss. Only, either Jack didn't care so much or he was just good at hiding it. He walked around that bunker as happy and unknowing as ever. It drove Sam crazy, and one night he was yelling at Jack. He was very drunk and afterwards, smiling bitterly, he realized that he was behaving like his own father. Jack only left his room after that when he could be sure that Sam wouldn't see him.
Dean went up again so only the head was in his mouth. The tip of his tongue swiped around it and then pressed into the slit. Castiel held onto the sheets and moaned. Then his hands let go and he slid them into Dean's hair. Dean hummed in approval and the vibration went right down Castiel's cock.
Once in the kitchen, he put the plate of noodles in the microwave and then sat down at the kitchen table. With shaky fingers, he turned the letter over and saw that indeed there was no return address or address on it. He thought about whether to read it or not, but then decided to do so. He took the folded papers from the envelope and began to read.
Cas just looked at him and said nothing. They started to eat.
"Cas", mumbled Dean and kissed Cas on the temple. "Hey, I've only been gone a couple of days and nothing bad happened."
Everytime when Cas drifted off to day dreaming with dark clouds in his mind, when he got sad or anxious, Dean was there. A little touch, a hug, a smile, kind words. Dean held Cas above water when he forgot how to swim.
It was such a tender kiss that Dean's heart ached. The kiss was so different from all the others before it, including the ones earlier at school.
I hope you enjoyed the story, despite the deaths?!
The knocking did not stop. Grumbling, Castiel got up, took a step and fell lengthwise. He had forgotten his suitcase.
Castiel put his second arm around Dean as well and pulled him close. They were still lying under the covers, all sweaty, and they were supposed to be taking a shower, but neither of them wanted to get up. Now Castiel also felt Dean start to shake and cling to his arms.
Dean had stopped the Impala by now. He turned off the engine, turned off the lights and took a deep breath.
After Cas fell asleep, cuddled up to Dean, Dean took the phone and the headphones from the nightstand. Ever since he saw Cas crying with music in his ears he wanted to know the song which left Cas this upset. He pressed play and listened...
They were both on the lawn, and since it was still 80 degrees, they didn't need a blanket.
"Inias, truth or dare?"
One day, when Cas and Dean were alone at the bunker, Cas was standing alone in the library, starring into nothing.
"Dean, you should come to the reception desk", he told Dean.
"Dean, your question from this morning..." Castiel tugged on Dean's ear. "Was that one in jest, or did you mean it?" Dean looked at him for a long moment, then stroked his finger across Castiel's nose and cheek.
"Don't go!" Cas softly pleaded. "Can you hold me, Dean?"
When they met, it was never more than a little smooching, cuddling, talking and enjoying the togetherness. At home they could not meet each other. With Cas there were always too many family members present and with Dean Sam was present. Not that Sam would have had anything against it, but he was at an age where he had to question everything and Dean couldn't he would ask an awkward question when their father was there. That's why they only met outside the school in places where no one could bother them. Quieter corners of parks, wooded areas between their houses, the lake...
"Cas..." he said in a husky voice.
"Cas?" Dean tried to push Cas away, but Cas clung to him.
Dean repeated this a few times but Castiel pulled on Dean's hair harder and Dean let go of his cock. Castiel motiones that Dean should come to him and Dean crawled up Castiel's body. Then their lips came together in a slow but passionate kiss which sent shockwaves of pleasure down both their spines. Castiel's tongue grazed Dean's bottom lip and Dean opened them so their Tongues could meet. They both groaned.
But before Castiel could say something, Dean pushed himself up and shifted so he'd sink down between Castiel's legs. He took of Castiel's boxer shorts and wrapped his hand around the other man's length. Castiel gasped, pushed himself up and settled onto his elbows. He wanted to see what Dean had in mind. Dean stroked his hand up and down, slowly, and Castiel hold his breath. Yes, it was a good feeling.
The third was their photo from the refrigerator, but now torn in half:
Curious as he was, but with a proper distance, Jack followed Eileen. She disappeared into Sam's room and nothing was heard anymore. The next morning she appeared in the kitchen, prepared a small breakfast for two, took it and disappeared again.
After a few minutes he got up and started to pack his suitcase. He packed laundry, toiletries, a few of the vinyl records, his favorite mug and the small plush dog that was on his bedside table. He put it all in the car already, but then ran back again. He had forgotten something.
This chapter isn't really a chapter.
"So what?" asked Castiel. Inias had his hands clasped between his thighs.
In February, they sat down and talked again and decided to go away together in two months.
It was two days until his birthday, but Castiel wasn't looking forward to it at all.
"What's the matter?" asked Dean. "Can't sleep?"
"I want you to leave this apartment and not come back until I'm gone."
Dean had shown Cas his absolute favourite film at this film evening - Dirty Dancing.
But now there's a happy ending, which I'm sure nobody thought of...
„Dean?“, Cas asked quietly.
"I don't wanna hurt you, man-"
"Yes?"
"Cas?" Dean's questioning voice brought him back. He cleared his throat slightly and looked at Dean.
"So it's true? You had an affair with a man? With that Dean guy?"
He started the engine and drove off.
Dean came in, saw it and rushed to him. He took him in a tight embrace, crossed his wrists behind Cas' upper back and spread the fingers of his hands. Then he lowerd his head onto Cas' chest, under his chin.
Dean just nodded, not ready to talk sense again.
"Was she the only one?" hissed Dean.
Cas looked at the ring, then Dean.
Dean put his arms around Cas from behind and Cas dropped his head against Dean's shoulder. Dean in turn laid his head down in Cas's crook of the neck. For a few moments they stood there like this, then the nightly silence, in which they had only heard a few crickets, was interrupted by a melody.
It had been a week since Gabriel had been there, listened to him, brought the letter from Dean, and asked Castiel to come home with him.
They were silent for a moment.
The fourth was just a post-it:
"I thought we were here in the kitchen." Jack tilted his head to the side with a questioning look. "What's going on? You two have been acting so strange all day, you can hardly keep your hands off each other?!"
Dean opened his eyes. They both chuckled. Cas placed a soft kiss underneath Dean's ear.
"Huh?!" thought Dean and watched the cassette.
"Sir, did you say something?" The truck driver turned to Dean with the phone on his ear. He had dialed 911 and now he knew the ambulance was coming.
Gabriel grinned.
"Oh. Oh, that's why you were so weird. I was starting to think..."
Castiel shook his head, and Dean threw a punch. Castiel whimpered briefly, was released by Dean, and plopped back in his chair.
Dean smiled, although Cas couldn't see it. He hugged his boyfriend even closer and looked up.
"Dean, it's not-"
Dean slid the unit back against the wall and looked at the refrigerator door one last time. There was a picture of him and Castiel hanging on it and Dean gulped.
But now he had to wait. Dean had been gone for almost a week by himself. This morning he had checked in with Cas and said he would be back late tonight.
The pastor knows the guy who will be on duty there when we are there. I know it isn't a big wedding only a private one but the big fest we can have after my tour.
Cas looked at Dean with big eyes and nodded. Dean screeched like a teenage girl and wanted to hug Cas but Cas asked him, by raising his hand, to stop.
Dean slid to the floor and began to cry. In less than two hours his whole life had fallen apart and he had lost everything he loved. The radio was playing in the background, which he had not noticed before. The song that was playing did not help to improve his mood.
"Cas, where-" Dean stopped his question. The room was darkened and lit only by two large candlesticks. Dean looked at the table first, then at Cas, stunned.
Now he sat on Cas hips and began to move back and forth with slight movements. Cas groaned, this time louder, as their abdomens touched again. Dean grinned and put his hands next to Cas's head. Cas hands disappeared again under Dean's shirt and began to stroke his lower back. Then he let them slide under the waistband and into Dean's pants and pressed both cheeks once. Dean raised his head jerkily and looked at Cas. He sat down and Cas followed him. Dean pulled his t-shirt over his head and Cas started to open his shirt. Dean took over the rest and pulled the shirt off finally. Dean pulled Cas towards him and both were more than excited that their upper bodies now touched each other without the disturbing clothes.
"Nooo... I don't think so?!"
"I wanted so badly to talk to someone about this, it would have been a lot easier for me to deal with the whole thing. But I stuck to our agreement, Dean. Even though it was damn hard. To be honest, it still is. I don't understand how you could break that promise?!" Castiel had spoken very quietly, but Dean had understood everything. He loosened the hug and pushed Castiel a little away from him.
"Yeah, later", mumbled Dean, winked and pulled Cas' head down again. What started light and as a kind of game grew heated. Cas and Dean were busy for quite a while.
It wasn't really a question, but Dean stopped talking anyway. Even in the dim light, Cas could see that tears were streaming down Dean's face.
"It wasn't an affair, Gabe. It was more, we were together for three years. And I was ready to ask 'the one question.' But at the time, it had looked like my feelings wouldn't be reciprocated in the end."
"Forget it," Dean interrupted. "How long has this been going on with you and her?"
An hour later, Dean was in the middle of what he thought was a Star Wars marathon, Castiel came through the living room and went to the kitchen. He had headphones in and was talking on the phone through them. He didn't even pay attention to Dean and Dean, who had briefly looked him over, turned back to the TV.
"What?" Castiel sounded irritated, but Inias didn't seem to mind. He stepped inside and closed the door behind him.
"Um... I think... I'll just..." He tried to get up, but Cas told him to sit still.
In March, Castiel seemed happier and more excited than he had been in a long time, and that lifted Dean's spirits considerably.
How he still hadn't wanted to go back to his family....
"Don't you think that's a little too soon? I mean, we haven't seen each other in five years."
„Cas“, mumbled Dean, „turn around, please.“
It was a Thursday afternoon when Sam reread the letter from Castiel. The angel had explained how the deal had come about and how much the brothers had meant to him. Cas had also briefly told about the last evening with Dean. Especially how happy Dean had been. Sam was saddened that he had not been able to see his brother anymore. But he was happy that Castiel could take this beautiful memory to his 'grave'.
A week in which Castiel had thought a lot. And he was still thinking.
They originally planned to use the first two weeks of the month for vacation, but Dean's boss and his staffing schedule intervened. Dean passed this on to Castiel and they both agreed that they would go later. But by mid-April, the 'vacation together' issue was forgotten and never brought up again. Dean wondered, hadn't they both been so excited?!
Dean was happy. Cas had done everything right with the tape. And now when he thought about it, he admitted to himself that he had been holding out on Cas for far too long. He decided as soon as he got home, he would call Cas. He would ask him to come by and then tell him that in the future he would stand by him in public. Let the others think what they wanted to think.
"Cas?"
The other guests held their breaths as Gabriel and Castiel stared at each other.
"Cas, you are crazy!" Dean said softly. "But because of that... I love you."
Both of them were sweating and heavily breathing now. Castiel slipped out slowly, took off the condom and threw it on the ground. They could care about it later.
"Dean... When do we-"
"I'm so happy right now, you know!" Inias had spoken very softly, as if no one should know, then he hugged Castiel. Castiel was totally confused at first. The last time Inias had hugged him like that was probably a good ten years ago. When they were younger it had been normal, later it had become weird. But the way Inias was clinging to him now.... Castiel swallowed, then returned the hug. Inias was almost 23, but here in his arms Castiel was not holding a young man. He stroked his brother's back reassuringly.
Dean made a deal to save his brother and went to hell for that. When Cas raised him from there he thought that Dean only went to hell because he was the big brother and wanted to protect his little brother Sam. Later he got it.
Dean put his legs and arms around Cas's body after Cas pulled out. He held him there, chest heaving and Cas buried his head in Dean's neck bend.
"Here... Something is wrong with our current room, so they gave us new ones. You have one and I have one." He throw the the key towards his brother who easily catched it. Sam looked a little confused but stood up.
Castiel smiled. "I won't." Then he kissed Dean, tenderly and his hand and hips began to move again. Dean choked out a moan and Castiel moaned in response. Castiel's hand tightened a bit more around Dean and his thumb swiped around his head and Dean realized the certain feeling in his abdomen.
Slowly Cas walked towards him, but Dean told him to stop. Cas stopped and looked at Dean with big eyes.
At first Cas couldn't understand it.
When the song started, his head fell on the steering wheel and he cried without restraint.
~ The phone number is made up, nevertheless I ask not to try it, because it could be real.
Cas laughed, he actually laughed. This first verse was nearly 100% like the phone call he had with Dean this night. Dean had told him that he loved the music, the fans, to be on tour... But he misses Cas everytime. And sometimes he wishes he could just cancel a show and fly right back to Cas.
That's why Cas was so happy when Dean promised him this one time to do something alone with him. He knew that what Dean had wished for was almost impossible, but he had wanted to hope a little bit.
"Yes, okay, I'll tell him", was all Dean heard, then the barkeeper hang up and came closer to the brothers.
(See the end of the chapter for
The time with the Winchester brothers, especially the time with Dean, had made him develop feelings and emotions he had never known before.
"Cas, honey, I've got something. I know the vacation had to be cancelled because of me. I've got a new date now."
"Cas, please! It's gonna be weird. Cas?"
"It's like I'll never forget," Cas said quietly. "For five years I've been trying. I've dated other men, but no one can replace Dean. To me, he was and is the one great love."
"If Sam knew I was listening to this kind of music, I bet he'd look at me in a weird way," Dean thought.
"Dean, it is beautiful!"
"I'll make it good for you, Dean." He let go of Dean's hard on and Dean whined. But he gasped when he felt Castiel's finger brushing against his hole. Castiel removed his hand and turned away to grab the lube which was standing on the nightstand. He also took a condom. He was sure that he wasn't 'ill' but better safe than sorry. When he gripped Dean again, the other man squirmed. Castiel chuckled.
A bouquet of roses, the most beautiful roses Dean had ever seen and a cassette.
"i missed you too" whispered Dean. He placed a kiss on Castiel's nose. "I missed your face, your lips, the way you kissed me, the way your fingers tightened in my hair." He placed a kiss on Castiel's right cheek. "The way your body moved, no matter if you were under or above me. The way we cuccled afterwards." He kissed Castiel's left cheek. "The way you talked. The way you listened when I had a bad day. Your cooking, your selfmade pie, how you managed to stay calm when I talked about 'Baby'. The many times I turned your romantic movies down and switched channels so I could watch my action movies and you never said anything. And so much more. Cas, I'm really glad you're here." Dean's voice hitched. "And I'm so sorry." He kissed Castiel again, this time on his mouth. "Let me show you how sorry I am, okay? Please."
At some point, Dean turned off the road and drove onto a dirt road. After a while he stopped, turned off the engine, looked over at Castiel and squeezed his hand. Castiel turned away from the window and looked at Dean. An almost shy smile came across their faces. At such moments, they always felt like newly in love teenagers.
Dean pulled at Cas's arms, and Cas understood. He slipped so far over that he lay on top of Dean. Dean took a deep breath and enjoyed being near Cas. As if by magic, his lips opened and their tongues began to play slowly. This went on for a few minutes, then Cas separated from Dean's mouth. Dean tightened the grip around Cas's upper back, almost as if he was afraid Cas would leave now. This one seemed to feel this and laughed softly one time. Then, just like when they met at the gym, he went over his jaw to Dean's ear. There he gently kissed the spot under his ear and nibbled lightly on the earlobe. Dean's breath would stop and he'd open his eyes. This was more intimate than anything he'd ever done before.
Cas turned his back to Dean, and Dean took a few steps back.
" thought Dean. "
A knock woke him up. Still half asleep, he glanced at the cell phone he had somehow placed on the nightstand. Eight o'clock.
Dean and Cas had both remained true to the name of the song. Their thoughts had been with each other until the end.
Then there was a knock.
"Argh," Castiel made, dropping back onto the pillow. Dean's mouth was warm and wet. There was also a tiny hint of teeth as Dean slowly went down. He let his tongue explore the underside and Castiel had a hard time to not push up his hips.
"I miss you, and I can't sleep." Castiel had mumbled, but Dean had understood him.
"Yeah sure you can, he's not there." Castiel listened for a moment. "Right... See you then. Me too!" Castiel made a kissing noise, then hung up. Dean's stomach turned.
"Don't be a dick, spill it out!"
Sam looked uncertainly at Castiel. "I don't know..."
"Sweetheart... Who do you think helped me change your room and who do you think is the bodyguard right now in front of our door? Hopefully he still has his music on?!" Cas giggled again. "So, yes Dean, I have a best man."
I want this to be over. I don't wanna hide anymore. I wanna go shopping, go to the cinema, go on a vacation but I wanna take YOU with ME." Dean stopped and breathed in, then he went on.
~ If you wish, I will describe the deja-vú of Dean & Castiel more precisely in one of the following parts.
"Mmm."
„Cas“, Dean started to say, „this may come as a bit of a surprise, and you can believe me.“ He cleared his throat. „You can believe me, I am very nervous right now. I never thought I'd be doing anything like this here. But-“, he cleared his throat again, „but ever since I've known you, everything's been different somehow. Just like before, you came from the light then, while I lived in the dark. When we met then it was as if I was crossing a threshold into a new world.
When Cas went down to save Dean he did it because he thought Dean deserved to be saved. Dean had suffered so much in his short life, lost important people. He was a broken man when he left earth and he got tortured in hell. He was also shown how to torture. But the one thing that impressed Cas the most was Dean's soul.
That's when the boy came to the sinks. He looked at Cas and smiled, then dried his hands and left the room. The door wasn't even closed properly when Dean was already at Cas.
When Castiel woke up around half past eleven, he felt surprisingly well. The sun was shining brighter, the birds were singing louder.... Whatever that was.
"Been a while... Whose fault is that, then? Certainly not mine, and honestly, I could have lived better without a reunion. So, you said hello. Mission accomplished, you can go again!"
The brothers and Cas had just returned from a case and had gathered in the kitchen to 'celebrate' the successful ending. Dean and Sam sat at the table, Cas leaned against the counter.
"New ones?", Dean asked, "Does it mean we have separated rooms?"
Gabriel had placed said letter on the sofa table, got up, and Castiel lay down. He didn't want the letter, but Gabriel insisted. Castiel grumbled, but his brother only put a blanket over him. When Castiel fell asleep, Gabriel disappeared. The letter was still on the table.
"Dean?"
Dean sobbed and began to cry.
"Bullshit. You needed time to yourself."
Lisa was his best friend, but that's all. Dean had had relationships too, but with all of them it had been a partner and these 'relationships' had not lasted more than a few days.
"You're really killing me, Dean." Dean lowered his head, playfully but gently snapping at Castiel's throat, growling like a hungry animal. Castiel laughed again and pulled Dean's head into the crook of his neck. Then he spun them both around so that he was on top.
They kissed again and Dean wrapped his arms around Cas' neck. Cas, however, broke away shortly after and began to kiss gently and approach Dean's crook of the neck again. He continued moving down the neck until he reached Dean's throat. Here he bit. Not in a way that hurt Dean, of course, but in a way that would be seen.
Cas and Dean didn't like the fact that they had to keep their relationship such a secret. But they knew exactly what would happen if the quiet boy from the year before last and the straight-A student from last year were seen together. Neither of them wanted to risk that, partly because Dean had one more year of school to attend.
"You were saying?", asked Dean. Cas laughed and pecked Dean's nose.
"You talked about us?" asked Castiel in shock. "You talked even though we agreed to keep it under lock and key?" Castiel began to tremble.
Cas kissed Dean like there was no tomorrow.
"Ehm... Well..." Inias choked, had to cough, and promptly blushed. The other guests whistled and jeered, but Castiel stood up and went to Inias. The man had lowered his head.
"Dean?" Castiel sounded perplexed. Dean reached for his key. "Dean, how long?"
When they moved into the bunker, Dean had driven through Kansas one night when he couldn't sleep. Even though he was born here, lived here for a while (before his father, Sam and he started a life on the road) and now lived here again, he didn't know all the places.
"No, Cas", Dean whispered, "keep going."
The second was a box:
"Farewell, Gabe."
"Oh shit, Sam was right!"
At quarter to nine he heard the door of the bunker open and when he heard the familiar 'Cas, I'm back' he knew Dean was back. But he remained sitting in the library without saying anything. Dean would now go to his room for a moment before he came into the library. Dean knew that Cas's favorite place was there and he also knew that he would find the angel there.
"Cas,
"Yeah, maybe, but it's true. You write an application maybe once a month and that's it. Especially since it's been going on for two years."
Dean had changed, Castiel had to admit. He had become thinner, he had dark rings under his eyes and the first gray appeared in his hair. But that was only noticeable because Dean and Castiel were standing close to each other. The only thing that hadn't changed was the gleam in his green eyes. Castiel shook his head slightly. How long had those eyes haunted him? And how often did they still do so today?
Many angels died but Cas wanted Dean to be saved. He later got told that when he first laid a hand on Dean in hell, he was lost. These people were right.
Dean had called Cas yesterday because they hadn't seen eachother for months and he needed to hear his voice. He wanted to take Cas with him this time but Sam warned him not to. Dean tried to get a place for Cas in his crew but Cas had told him that he preffered to work in his brothers company. He was the deputy CEO at htis candy firm.
Dean would never admit it. Neither to Sam nor to Cas but he was heartbroken. He felt betrayed but most of all sad. He felt like he was about to be robbed of something he wasn't allowed to have. Time and a life with his best friend, his angel Castiel.
"Ugh, Dean-" Castiel turned his head to the side, chuckling. "Stop it."
Now Castiel looked at the photo somewhat wistfully. It reminded him of a time that was long gone. Yes, he and Dean had decided to try again, but could they have back what they had once had? He didn't know himself where these doubts came from. He hadn't had them yesterday. Maybe they would go away when he and Dean had everything settled. He put the picture back in the drawer.
Cas turned to Dean.
"Yeah, later", mumbled Cas, took Dean's suitcase and bag, throw them on the ground, put his arms around Dean's neck and crashed their lips together. Dean sighed and responded by puting his arms around Cas' back and kissing him back.
"Man, I'm glad you were here today. It would've been too much trouble for me to do it on my own. As much as I hate to admit it." Dean made a face for a second.
"Very nice," Castiel thought and smirked. Then he left the room.
The library was still dark, only the candles illuminated it. And these candles were now standing so that it looked as if Dean had wings. Cas opened his mouth. Dean giggled.
"No, just like this." Castiel told Dean. He had found a languid rhythm for them while kissing Dean deeply. But when Dean begged again he managed to put more power behind the next thrust. Dean rocked back against him and Castiel who by now has burried his face in Dean's neck, moaned.
Cas cleared his throat and Dean suddenly had a very bad feeling.
"CASTIEL NOVAK!" they all cringed, for no one had heard Naomi and Chuck coming. "What are you yelling about? Have you looked at your watch? And what are you up to, leaving us again without saying anything?"
But now that Sam hadn't eaten for a whole week, it was too much for Jack. He sat on his bed and wondered who else he could ask for help. He had already called Jody, but after several unsuccessful attempts he had given up. One last possibility was this young woman Sam had talked about a few times. After much thinking, he remembered that Dean and Sam had once told him about a retirement home where she had worked under a false name. He also knew that Sam kept a flyer somewhere.
Then it was quiet again. They stood tightly embraced in the moonlight and enjoyed this undisturbed time together.
Cas heard Dean come into the library. From the entrance hall you could see the room itself, but not the tables in the library.
"How could I. In this family, you only count if you marry a woman, or in Anna's case, a man, and start a family. With me, questions were never asked because I was so busy with school. Later came university, I had more opportunities and since I always had good grades, Mum and Dad didn't ask either. When I finished studying and came back here, it became more difficult then. When I met Dean, I often got into trouble explaining things to Mum. I'd quite often come home late or stay out for a few days, but I never brought a woman with me. Secretly, I wonder why I didn't get caught to this day."
A little later, Dean pulled away from the kiss. He was slightly dizzy, he needed air. Not that he regretted it. When he looked at Castiel, he seemed to feel the same way. Castiel laughed, still a little breathless.
" Break. Dean looked at the tape. "Cas?," he whispered.
It was half past eleven and Dean and his band had a little 15 minute break. Right now they came back on stage and Cas got a little nervous because Dean looked towards his brother and winked. Could it be that he was about to sing the song for Cas?
" Dean thought, "
Dean rolled over and snuggled against Castiel. He buried his head in the crook of Castiel's neck. Castiel stroked his back soothingly.
"Me? I'm Mildred Baker. I had a run-in with Dean a few years back. But what are you calling here for?"
It was early afternoon, the sun was shining down from a blue sky and it was even still warm for October. Their jackets lay beside them. The sandwiches and most of the salads and other appetizers had been eaten. They lay on their backs looking up at the sky. As at the meal, where they had spoken only when necessary, so now they said nothing. It was nice sometimes to just be silent with each other.
When Cas lost his wings and his power, he was lost.
They both laughed quietly for a moment, but did not move otherwise. They just held on and listened to the song. At the end of the song, Cas nudged Dean with his nose.
"You're amazing, you know that? Even when things aren't perfect, or we're fighting or something, you're always there. You can always be counted on, no matter the situation."
In a split second Dean and Cas separated from each other. Cas acted as if he was drying his hands and Dean stood, a little lower bent to not be seen in the mirror, above the sink and pretended to want to wash his hands. Both held their breath.
The picnic basket and the cooler were placed on the back seat, Castiel had the picnic blanket folded on his lap. Music was playing softly, Dean softly tapping along to the beat on the steering wheel every now and then. Castiel held the blanket with one hand and looked out the window of his door. Their free hands lay, fingers intertwined, between them on the bench seat. Only the soft clatter of dishes and bottles could be heard otherwise.
All this just came back to Castiel's mind now. As so often when he thought about Dean and his life.
For three years, Dean and he had been together, but then Dean's book became a hit and Dean became an celebrated author within a few weeks. Then, just before his 25th birthday, Dean told Castiel that he was ending their arrangement because he wanted to concentrate on his career for now.
„I'm gonna blindfold you now, okay? You don't have to be afraid, otherwise the surprise would be gone“, whispered Dean Cas into his ear.
"Dean, you gonna make me cry!", Cas once sniffed. "But you know what? Bees like sweets, so continue being my
Today Dean turned 17.
The little flower stands for: New beginning, loyalty, trust, innocence, constancy, purity and modesty.
"I think you know there's still some clarification needed on some things, but I hope we do better this time." Dean laughed softly.
When he removed his fingers to add a third one, Dean gripped his hand.
Dean smirked and Cas frowned. A slight hint of fear could be seen in his eyes but also curiosity. Dean stayed silent and just locked eyes with Cas. Now Cas got a little nervous and boxed Dean's shoulder in a light way.
"Dean?" Castiel frowned. "What-?"
„Yes“, Dean replied, „everything‘s good.“ Dean was glad that it was so dark. So Cas could not see how excited he was.
"I'm sorry!", he mumbled. The next thing that happened was Cas turning out the light with a little wave of his hand. The room was black now and nothing was heard except for their breathing. But if someone would come in now there would be a long build tension in the air.
"I've moved our vacation to there now. Tell me, are you even listening to me? You're just looking at your phone."
As if struck by lightning, he broke away from Dean and inhaled. Dean also breathed heavily, but grinned at Cas.
Dean was close and Cas began to loose the steady rythem, so he as well was near. Dean put his arms around Cas's neck and dragged him down for a hard and breathless kiss.
He drank his coffee, listened to the birds he could hear through the open window and enjoyed Sunday. It was a little quieter outside, you could hardly hear anything from the neighbors. In the distance he heard a low rumble and thought, illogical as it was, that maybe a thunderstorm was coming. He shook his head, got up and took the dishes to the sink. He took the rest of the groceries to the refrigerator.
He let the picnic blanket slide into the footwell, moved closer to Dean, put his hands around Dean's face and kissed him. Dean made a surprised sound, but muffled by their joined lips, and returned the kiss. At some point they broke away from each other and looked at one another, cheeks flushed and breathless. Castiel's eyes glistened a little.
How he had never managed to start a new relationship again....
There were so many times when they got angry and disappointed at each other. But they always came back. Because only in each others presence they felt safe, they felt home.
"No, no, no", Cas thought, "this can't happen. I gotta pull myself together. I got something to say to Dean. I knew it was gonna be hard, but so hard? Dean is so happy. I haven't seen him like this in a long time. Ugh, I can't. But I have to..."
How afraid he was of meeting his parents again....
How he had run away after their breakup....
After the ceremony we have a whole week to ourselves. I don't know if you like this plan but I'm actually a little excited?!"
Castiel returned to the apartment late in the evening. It was dark.
"Dean, just hold me now..."
Sam had spent many days and nights trying to find out where Dean was. But no one would tell him where his brother was now. Not the angels, not the demons, not the witches, not the other hunters. No one would help him. They seemed glad to finally have the Winchester brothers like they wanted. One gone, and the other exhausted and helpless.
Cas was the first to break away and smiled at Dean.
Cas moved a bit and Dean shivered when he felt Cas' lips on his ear.
Cas had stopped talking and Dean heard him sobbing. Meanwhile Dean himself had driven to the side, because he was crying and could not spot the road anymore. Cas had scared him many times before, but this time he topped everything.
"Dean, officially this is my apartment. Even though you're paying for it."
"Cas, you don't have to leave right now."
"I forgot to give you your ring. I wanted to do it when you've shown me my ring-", he rummaged in his bag, blew out the rest of the candles (only the ones on the bedside tables were still burning) and came back to the bed, "-but I got a little distracted."
"Oh, so here and there. What is it?" Dean looked at him and Cas knew he must have noticed something.
„Sshhhtt.“ Cas was interrupted by Dean. „Just listen...“
"Hey, what's up?" he asked softly. Dean turned his head and his watery eyes looked at Castiel.
Dean and one of the bodyguards stood up and went to the reception. They were greeted by a middle aged woman with a warm smile. Dean smiled back.
It was just a simple kiss and Castiel turned so he was laying on his back. Dean pushed himself up and settled on top of Castiel, never breaking the kiss. When they came up for air, Dean burried his hads in Castiel's hair. They looked at each other.
"What?"
", he said quietly. "
"Dean?"
They sat at dinner, Dean wanted to surprise Castiel with a new date.
„Yes“, Dean replied just as softly.
"You can't do nothing, that's the problem. I wish you could turn back time and we could start over again. And don't waste so much time in the beginning. I feel like I just started to get to know you and now you'll leave me. It isn't fair! And tell me man.. How can I love someone new when you're the first and the last one in my life?!"
"Hey, buddy", Dean whispered. Cas closed his eyes again. Dean sighed and was about to leave but Cas grapped his arm.
"Yeah anyway. I'm sorry." They were both silent for a moment, then Castiel spoke again. He was sitting cross-legged by now, and in such a way that he could now look at Inias. "That you are confused, I can understand, but have you ever thought about it? I mean, why are you confused? I was no different back then. But I realized very soon that girls could be nice, but that I couldn't do anything more with them. It were always the boys who fascinated me."
"Happy Birthday, boo-boo!", he whispered, still a little breathless.
Ten minutes later, an arm wrapped around his shoulders. Castiel flinched slightly, turned to the side and looked at Inias. His little brother, who had grown taller than him by now. When Castiel had left, Inias had been close to his majority.
The thought that Gabriel had kept this to himself for so long, when he was the family clown and could never keep his mouth shut, made Castiel's throat tighten. He had looked down at his hands so Gabriel wouldn't see what was really going on. Gabriel must have guessed, though, and had taken Castiel in his arms. Castiel had cried and told the story between a few sobs. Gabriel had held him and Castiel had also mentioned that he had felt so alone. He would not have known how to explain his rushing away. Gabriel had then assured him that he would no longer be alone. His big brother was back now.
"Yes, Dean, I will marry you but-" Cas stood up.
"What happened?"
"Dean?", Cas asked in a quiet voice.
When song number 5 started Dean had to smile. It was 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston. This choice of music was so typically Cas.
"Yes it is, Cas" Dean said, putting his hands around Castiel's face, "it's that simple." He looked at Castiel intently, then lowered his head a tiny bit. Their lips touched, just very lightly, but for both of them it felt like time stood still. At first Castiel didn't move, but a short moment later he sighed, wrapped his arms around the middle of Dean's body and returned the kiss with more vigor.
Dean wasn't able to do anything, so held on to Cas's shoulders. He watched Cas who had closed his eyes while pounding into him.
Sam gets the worst news he could get. He falls, but he can get up again, also because of Jack's help...
It was his birthday, 8 o'clock in the morning and Castiel was thinking.
Dean put his head on Cas's shoulder and Cas put his head on Dean's.
"Okay."
The thought of this conversation made Cas very sad right now, because he knew that this would never ever happen anymore.
Dean's cock was leaking with precome. Cas licked at it and swallowed down. He slid up and down, sucking. Dean felt a finger moving. Oh Lord- Was Cas?- Shit!
"Okay then", Dean said. The woman gave him two keys for their new rooms and Dean went back to Sam.
How much he wished he didn't wake up alone in the morning or go to sleep alone at night....
"Cassie, come home with me. "
"Cas, don't be mean", Dean asked, almost as a child. "Come here and -aah-!"
Dean opened his room and was surprised.
"You left that out earlier, though. You hadn't mentioned that detail, but now I can understand your behavior."
"No."
"Cas, it's good to see you again." Castiel and Inias had stopped. Castiel looked at his brother and whatever it was, Inias looked like the time he had come home as a young boy with a bloody nose and scraped up legs and hands. That had been the time when Inias had been so teased by the boys in his class. He had run all the way and hid in Castiel's room until he had come home, cleaned the wounds, put band-aids on them, hugged Inias and promised him that everything would be okay. Inias had always come to Castiel when something was bothering him, even later as a teenager. Until Castiel had left.
Castiel swallowed.
"Cas-" Dean panted, eyes closed. "I need- Can you-?" Castiel hushed and kissed Dean's neck. After a moment he inserted a second finger and kisses his shoulder.
While the song was playing, Cas and Dean had moved slowly swaying to the music. Wrapped tightly in each others arms, spinning in circles. Dean's head resting on Cas's shoulder and Cas's head in Dean's crook of the neck.
How the argument with his brother kept him busy....
"Yeah, Cas, I'm alright." Dean murmered. He turned his head and smiled. "Just move, please." With his other arm an hand Castiel held him even closer and locked their lips. It turned out to be a very passionate but also gentle kiss. Castiel pulled his hips back a little bit and pushed forward again. Dean let out a quiet moan and Castiel repeated the move. Only this time he pulled out a bit further before diving back in.
"No. That's not what I meant. I'm just surprised at how much I really meant to you."
Sam was at the very end, he couldn't take it anymore and just wanted to leave.
At first he was a little confused, but then it came back to him. Dean was here and he was lying, snuggled close to Castiel, behind him. Dean still seemed to be asleep, so Castile kept quiet, snuggled a little closer to Dean, closed his eyes and smiled. Yes, Dean was here.
Castiel looked at him with wide eyes. Then he cleared his throat.

"Yes, I couldn't at some point. When I found you were gone.... I wasn't well."
The sight made his stomach turn. Two shocked faces looked at him. Castiel was lying on his back, a woman, about the same age, was sitting on top of him.
He needed to see him and he needed to see him now. He sent Cas a note asking the teacher to let him go to the bathroom.
Another week went by without Sam moving from his room. Jack had gotten into the habit of leaving food outside his door. In most cases, Sam would only take a few bites. Too little, but still something.
Dean had told Sam that he was gonna go for a drive tonight. Without his brother. He didn't mention that Cas was gonna be there. Not that Sam didn't know it, but Dean didn't want to tell him specifically. He just wanted some time alone with Cas. It had never really been a problem with Sam living in the bunker with him all that time, Dean was even happy about it. He liked having ‚his‘ people around so he could look after them. But now he just wanted to get out.
The finger was massaging the ring of his hole while Cas had him still in his mouth. Dean gasped and whimpered. Cas seemed to have mercy with him. He pressed one finger in, slowly and thoughtful since it was Dean's first time. He hummed around Dean because of the tightness. His mouth and finger were now in the same movement and pace. It was so overwhelming but it wasn't enough. Maybe Cas felt it too because he let go of Dean's dick, crawled up to his face and lingered over his mouth while he added a second finger. Dean's eyes opened.
"It's all right. And yeah, I've thought about my confusion a few times, but just like you said - in this family, it doesn't count. And that's why I leave it at meeting women."
"I may be an ass, I know that. But you were in one, weren't you Cassie?"
He sighed.
„Yes, Cas, that's it!“, was Dean's answer. He felt like he was glowing inside as he saw Cas smiling proudly now. They kept listening to the tape, but just as Cas was about to look out the window again, Dean secretly stopped the tape. The song that came now, he needed later.
„Cas, I'll turn it around later. It's not worth it now. We're almost there, and it would be stupid to stop in the middle of a song.“ Cas tilted his head to one side and thought for a second.
His best friend Sam and his 'nearly-son' Jack (because Jack had chosen Cas as his father) were there and let him stay in the family of which he was a part before he lost his wings. But this didn't change the fact that he still didn't felt complete. Something was missing. Sam and Jack tried their best but they couldn't really help him...
„Cas, I'm sorry. I didn't know my mpff-“ Here he was interrupted by Cas. The angel had thrown himself into Dean's arms and kissed him stormy. Dean kissed him back and then they parted ways.
Cas made it infinitely sad to be not as important to Dean as Sam was. But what did that one dog in the one cartoon say... Oh, yeah. 'The human heart can only love one'. How right he was. With Dean, no one would take that place but Sam.
Castiel's family knew nothing of his homosexuality, so he was all the more surprised when Gabriel at some point hinted in that direction. He told his little brother that he had gotten the idea when he had picked up a letter without an inscription from the mailbox almost four and a half years ago.
It rang twice, then picked up.
They drove down the road sitting in Baby. Dean as driver, Castiel as passenger. For the way back, it would be the other way around. Castiel was the only one he would readily allow to do that. Sam had to ask for days, and then Dean would just grumble and hand over the key. But with Castiel...
"Do you know that today is my birthday?", Dean asked quietly.
Dean's hand curled gently around the base. His gaze flicked up and met Castiel's. They already had one round earlier but it hadn't been like what was about to happen now. This time it would be different.
He couldn't ask any more questions, because Cas pushed him against one of the bookshelves and his lips were back on Dean's. Even though this kiss began as stormy as the previous one, Cas slowed the pace. He wrapped both arms around Dean's middle and pushed against him. Dean responded by wrapping his arms around Cas's hips and kissing back. So they now stood in the dark library for a few minutes.
The woman nooded with an apologetic face.
"No, Dean. Please don't." Cas murmured in Dean's crook of the neck.
Cas swallowed.
"Yes, Dean, I'm listening. You're off, you said. Sorry." Castiel smiled slightly. It looked more like he just lifted the corners of his mouth, though. He put his cell phone down on the table. Turned it over, screen down. Then he glanced at Dean.
"Cas?" asked Dean. He sounded tired, but not as if he'd been asleep yet.
Cas began in a very slow almost killing tempo. But it wasn't enough, for both of them. So when Dean begged for more, Cas sped up. He paused to role up his trenchcoat and put the bundle under Dean's lower back. When he got in now, Dean cried out. The new angle helped Cas to hit Dean's prostate with every thrust.
"Yes."
"Okay...", mumbled Cas and pushed in deeper. He was shaking with the effort of holding back. With his own tip he passed Dean's ring of muscle. Dean moaned louder than before and Cas clenched his teeth. He was ready for other moves but Dean wasn't, so he thought. But Dean was ready. He wrapped his knees around Cas's hips and tried to pull him in faster. A few moments later Cas was fully inside and nothing was heard but their heavy breathing.
Dean broke off the kiss and turned his head to the side. Castiel started to kiss from his chin to his ear, never stopping to roll his hips. They're both heavely breathing by now. When Castiel reached Dean's ear he murmered.
"Cas, damnit man, please move", whispered Dean and jerked forward with his hips.
"Dean? Is that really you? I'm so happy to hear from you."
'[...] Enjoying your time together?' How did Sam... Well, maybe Cas had mentioned it.
"That's not fair, Castiel. You know how much that book meant to me." Now Dean sounded angry. Castiel narrowed his eyes. Had he been asked later what had triggered it, he probably would have just shrugged. Whether it was Dean's obsession with the book or the argument with Gabriel that was still bothering him? I don't know. Whatever it was, the anger boiled up again and Castiel lashed out.
For a whole week, Dean stayed with his brother. Then Castiel called.
"Oh, God... I'm sorry," Dean said quietly, but Cas was not deterred. And Dean? He had never thought that chasing his feelings could be this good. He dived his hands into Cas hair and pulled him down a little more. Cas has losened up a bit so he wouldn't gag ths time. Instead of he growled and Dean could feel the vibration of it. It made him shiver.
Sam put his beer bottle on the table. He cleared his throat.
Dean turned his back to Castiel and looked out the window for a moment. Then he began to speak again in a normal but quiet voice.
~ Gabriel's disappearance will be explained in one of the following parts of the series
"Will you let me in?"
"I know but please-" Cas sobbed. Dean laid still but then, after a few seconds that felt like minutes, Cas could hear a mumbled 'okay'. Cas murmered a soft 'thank you' before he crashed their lips together. Their hands moved over each other. They both groaned at the contact, as touch starved as they were. So when Dean rolled on top of Cas and Cas pulled him down, holding him firmly, the kisses and touches grew heated fast.
Yesterday, when Dean had called Cas from Glasgow, they were on the phone for four hours but at five in the morning Dean had said 'goodnight' because the next day he had to be in Edinburgh.
"Don't worry, I won't stop this time", Cas whispered in Dean's ear. Dean moaned softly and searched for Cas' lips. This kiss would become more passionate.
(See the end of the chapter for
It includes all the explanations, descriptions or informations.
Cas had passed this on to Sam and Jack, and miraculously, Sam had found a case a few states over. He left with Jack about an hour after Cas told him. Silently, Cas thanked the younger brother and wondered if Sam knew anything.
"Well... So you know..." While Inias was searching for the right words, Castiel had sat down on the bed and gestured for Inias to join him.
The next morning he called the Oak Park Retirement Home. He introduced himself as Dean Winchester, because he thought he could get more information that way. After he got in touch, he heard laughter in the background and then nothing. He was about to hang up when a very nice sounding lady answered.
"Wow... I didn't know that."
He stared at the screen. His wallpaper was the photo he had taken of a picture of a four-year-old boy. The boy's mother shopped regularly at the supermarket where Castiel worked under the name Steve. One day the boy had given him a picture that had a flowery meadow painted on it with lots of bees buzzing about. There was also a big bee and Jonny, the boy's name, had explained to him that it was Castiel/Steve.
"Ah, fuck", he gasped, since Cas began to suck him in earnest.
~ Dean and Cas will talk more in one of the following parts.
„Wow!“, whispered Cas reverently. He heard a faint click again, but just as he was about to turn around, Dean was behind him.
Dean kept repeating over and over again that family comes before everything'. Only now did Cas understand what it really meant. He would never be family in that way. He had come into an existing system, was accepted and liked, but still he was the fifth wheel. That which was only used when one of the others did not work and was otherwise put away. If he left the brothers, they would not even ask where he was, they would just wait for him to come back.
Castiel didn't answer and went back to looking at his hands. Dean swept the table aside and reached for Castiel's T-shirt collar with his left hand. He pulled it up and raised his right hand as if he were going to punch. This time Castiel flinched.
"Cas, you're unbelievable! Of course I will marry you, you dork."
He was so overwhelmed by Dean's statement that he couldn't answer. He couldn't even return the hug. Cas quietly decided to never leave Dean, the man who he loves the most above everything else, as long as he would live. Dean had always been his home and that wouldn't ever change.
Dean's mouth fell open in amazement. "I didn't know that!" he whispered.
"No." Castiel spun them around again.
He had done so much for the brothers, so many things. Only because of Dean had he rebelled, had stood against his brothers and sisters, had turned away from heaven. He was convinced that Dean was destined for the good and therefore needed to be protected.
Soon after he turned around, Dean could feel Castiel's strong hands wrapped around his stomach. Castiel spooned him tightly, pressing his lips to Dean's neck. He groaned and turned his head so he could give Castiel a proper kiss. While Castiel's hands wandered down over his chest to his hard cock, his mouth came to Dean's ear.
"Dean, will you marry me too?"
"Cas, what is this?"
The crowd was furious and Cas was happy, Dean sang this song only for him. He was so excited to see Dean that began to shiver.
His phone was buzzing. He pulled it out of his pocket and saw it was a message from Sam. When he opened the message, his brother and Jack smiled at him. Dean rolled his eyes, but he had to grin. 'Our case is going well and as I heard from Cas, you got home safe last night. I hope everything is well with you and you are enjoying your time together?' Sam's message said.
Dean was very busy at work. The press office where he was employed was very busy because of a big meeting with many politicians from all over the world. He therefore had less and less time for his boyfriend. Due to extra hours, he now quite often came home much later. Most of the time Castiel was already asleep.
Castiel smiled at Inias, who had come into the living room. He gave Sam an expressionless look, which Sam returned. He gave Meg a brief but firm hug. He also hugged his father and mother; it would be the last time, he knew. Then he stopped in front of Gabriel, looked at him sadly and held out his hand.
"Since December-," Dean repeated. He snorted and took a sip of beer. "Since December." Much too quietly, he set the bottle down.
"Mmm," Dean said now, but didn't let that stop him from continuing to spread kisses on Castiel's neck.
"Cas-"
I'm sooooo sorry!!!!
Sam was curled up on the floor by now, looking like a little baby.
"Naawww, Cassie, still the the great protector for our youngest?" Gabriel's voice dripped with false pity. Even if he meant it in jest, Castiel knew Gabriel knew no such thing as boundaries. Even when they were children, Gabriel had it in for Inias. He never got violent with him, but words can sometimes hurt more than a fist.
"You know, Jack", Eileen started and put her hand on Sam's, so that they were both resting on her stomach "eight months from now..."
