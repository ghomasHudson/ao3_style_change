Lestrade was beginning to think the blaze at Markham’s flat was the least bizarre thing he’d encountered that morning. When John returned fully dressed, Lestrade said, “There was a fire at Markham’s flat.”
WHEN SHERLOCK OPENED his eyes, the sky outside was turning a pearly grey at the edges, heralding the coming sun. He inhaled deeply, and John murmured a response to the movement in his sleep, slightly adjusting the way he laid draped on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock took a moment to focus on this, on all the places where their bodies intersected, the points of contact burning like small stars to form a constellation. He listened to the pounding of his heart, felt the throb of it as the blood pulsed through him, and became aware of the answering thud of John’s heartbeat against his. If only they could stay that way indefinitely. But time was short now, so Sherlock began the slow process of disentangling himself.
“I should go meet Irene,” Sherlock said, working an apologetic note into his tone. “She wants to plan . . .”
The clinic stayed busy, so Sarah hadn’t had many chances to observe John at work, but she was impressed with what she saw. He worked quickly but with supreme care. Maybe more care than was absolutely necessary? She watched the way John’s hands lingered for a second longer than needed after laying each strip of adhesive. But then looking at his face she realized it was because he was lost in thought. And the way his eyes traveled over Sherlock had more to do with John mentally piecing together the trauma that had been inflicted than it being some kind of visual caress.
It was more difficult getting John out of the car than it had been to get him in; John spent some time trying to shrug off their best efforts until he grudgingly relented to their tugging and urging, only to come close to falling on his face when they attempted to extract him.
John waited for the light to go on, although Sherlock surely knew he was awake. Thanks to his military conditioning, John was a light sleeper, could be made alert in a matter of seconds. Not something he enjoyed—he preferred to wake more gradually—but it had proven to be a useful skill since meeting Sherlock.
“I refuse to believe you’ve been forced to resort to clichés in order to get someone to feel you up, Christopher.”
John stirred reluctantly against what had become his least favorite part of their developing routine. “Too early,” he mumbled, trying to burrow under his pillow.
“Bird,” Sherlock slurred. It seemed to John that he started to say more, but the wave of slumber crested over him before he could manage it.
“And this,” Sherlock said, holding out a hanger that held a nicer shirt than the kind John typically wore.
John re-banded the remaining correspondence and put the chest back where he’d found it. He took the time to put the other memento boxes back in the closet as well, though he knew they were impossibly out of order. But better to leave as little evidence as possible.
Sherlock considered. How far away he was from where he’d been abducted would rely partly on how long he’d been unconscious. Difficult to determine while wearing a blindfold, since he couldn’t tell whether the sun had set yet. They’d grabbed him on the road outside Weald House, roughly two hours from London. He could easily be in London or any of its immediate environs. The Ritz again? But the place didn’t have the closeted and contained smell of a hotel room.
“Almost six,” said John. “Not like you to fall asleep on the job.” He’d meant it jokingly, but it came out sounding harsher than he’d intended.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “You’d have to ask Whitcombe, then. I’ve never been good at . . . that kind of thing.”
. As a parting shot she’d warned them that their lovingly decorated honeymoon suite at Weald House was still waiting for whenever they chose to return.
A smile tugged at Irene’s lips. “Really? I think maybe he’s mentioned you, too, but—” And here she gave an exaggerated frown as if trying to remember, “I could be thinking of someone else.” Then without waiting for Harry’s response, Irene turned to John once more. “Wake up, John. I dragged him all the way down here; the least you could do is be awake.” She leaned in and peered at him. “Not self-medicating again, are you?”
“The calyx was to be your ransom. I didn’t know Charles was . . . I didn’t know what Charles was doing,” Sherlock rephrased.
“And until then, I’m just supposed to continue pretending you’re dead,” John surmised. He stood only to realize his breeches were loose. “Huh,” he said, refastening them while eyeing Sherlock suspiciously.
“Almost there,” said John, giving Brandywine’s rein a tug. The horse snorted his disapproval but moved forward nonetheless. Being close to his goal, John became more insistent and Brandywine eventually gave up stopping every few feet.
“I don’t remember; it seems likely I was already unconscious at that point. But Moriarty would have needed help to move me. Well,” he said abruptly, “this is interesting but what we really need to know is—”
“Mm.” Sherlock headed for the bathroom. “You won’t be without company,” he called over the clatter of toiletries being tossed into a kit. “Your sister is going with you.”
The eyes slid toward the sound of his voice, and seeing him, John drew himself up and back as if trying to pull into the corner of the sofa. “No,” he said. “No. You—you don’t get to call me that any more.”
Sherlock felt his heart pick up speed. He could not recall a time when he was happier to have such a suspicious, nosy, and overbearing older brother.
But Charles was looking at John. “It seems we caught you as you were going to bed for the night. You shouldn’t let us keep you.”
“I’m not—I don’t know what I am,” said John. “I’m—I’m confused, and . . .” He tried to trace his feelings to their roots, but all the wires inside him were crossed.
“All right, well,” the nurse said, walking over and fixing the chair in one smooth motion, “we’ll keep him under sedation for the next eight to twelve hours, mostly to stop him from moving around too much. And after he’s awake,
Sherlock sat up and buttoned his shirt. “I think I’ll . . .” He stood and half strode, half stumbled to his room, slamming the door behind him.
“Probably not,” Sherlock agreed, though John noticed that his companion made no motion to touch his food, instead picking up the newspaper that was folded on the tabletop in front of one of the vacant chairs.
So at first Sherlock mistook Lestrade’s astonishment for shock at the general carnage of the flat. “Moriarty,” he recounted grimly. “He . . .”
“Sit,” Sherlock instructed gently, and Mrs. Grossman entered with a tray weighted with a pitcher of iced water, two glasses, and some bread with butter.
John often reflected on the duality of having such an impatient flatmate who himself required such fortitude to deal with.
“Whenever a man tells a woman something, she invariably views it as an opportunity to redouble her efforts in the hopes of changing his mind,” said Sherlock. “No, she’ll either need to come to the conclusion on her own or have someone else—another woman would be best—tell her.”
But any jealousy Sherlock had been primed to feel was cut by closer examination of the image. Because while Eoin was looking directly at John, even leaning a little toward him, John showed no such inclination—literally or figuratively. John remained stolidly upright and appeared to look past Eoin rather than at him.
Sherlock blinked rapidly, surprised by the turn in conversation. “No. Upsetting Mycroft would only be a side benefit.”
“Don’t be childish; you know what they are. And if I’ve taught you any kind of deductive skills, you also know they haven’t been used in ages.”
But if that were strictly true, Sherlock’s actions now did not make sense. He had a case, and by all the unspoken and unwritten rules that framed the way Sherlock worked, he should be completely engaged with that and not at all interested in his flatmate, who had no valuable insight to offer at the moment.
John could think of little he would like less than having to spend any time at all in Mycroft’s quelling company. “He’ll probably just send his assistant,” John called hopefully, “and Mrs. Hudson can let her in.”
But doctors and soldiers cannot afford to be rash. Even when they must act and react swiftly, it is always with thought and precision. There are guidelines. This often determines the difference between life and death.
“Now I’d like to get out of here with a minimal amount of fuss,” Mycroft continued. “It’s bad enough I had to come at all. Mr. Moriarty, if you please—” Mycroft gestured for Moriarty to join him. “Mr. Tait is under the impression that I am Inspector Lestrade, so if you’ll follow my lead . . .” He and Moriarty began to walk away, but after a few steps Mycroft paused. “Sherlock! Are you coming?”
“Is this an interrogation?” John asked suddenly. “What do you want to know, Sherlock? How we met, or what happened the first time we slept together, or—” When Sherlock blanched, John added impatiently, “You don’t expect me to believe you were celibate for two years?”
John was tempted to ask if that’s how he’d done things, but Sherlock was bringing the tray, which he set on the table before settling in a nearby chair. John handed Charles one of the cups then took up guard standing beside his flatmate’s seat while he sipped from his own mug. Sherlock left his tea untouched, his eyes focused on the windows across the room.
JOHN STOOD THERE for some while; it was too early yet to go over to the clinic. His mind wandered; first, his gaze having landed on the computer, idly wondering what Mycroft might want with it, then thinking he should at least shut it off . . . And he would need to leave the flat unlocked so Mycroft could get in . . . Not that locked doors seemed likely to prove much of an obstacle for him. But John didn’t want to be present when Mycroft turned up, either; he didn’t like the way the older Holmes brother looked at him as if trying to pin him in place with his eyes.
Sherlock herded John into John’s bedroom and sat him on the edge of the bed, waiting a moment to be sure John wouldn’t topple. But his flatmate was already making the slow climb out of the sleepiness that the last dose of drugs had caused, and remained upright. Soon, Sherlock knew from experience, the insomnia was likely to set in.
He tried to focus on the road; it was dark now, and Sherlock had been right in suggesting John might fall asleep while driving, tired as he was. But he also couldn’t help taking in little glances at the man sleeping next to him. John liked watching Sherlock sleep, always had, though it embarrassed him even to admit it to himself. There was something lovely about how blank Sherlock’s face became, how quiet his features, the eyes closed instead of constantly roving, looking for input. Sherlock looked sweet when asleep, young and soft and inanimate, like someone in a painting by Leighton or Jones.
“Fingernail polish,” said Sherlock, dropping to the hardwood. “And black shoe polish, too; whoever she is, she was wearing dress shoes.”
His own curiosity piqued, John took his new clothes to the closet to hang them, then poked his head into Sherlock’s room. The walls were hung in dove moire, the bedspread was iceberg blue with cerulean stripes, and the rug was Wedgwood in hue. The overall effect was of an encapsulated rainy day.
Sherlock scowled and looked to the doorway. There stood Lestrade, and behind him Sargent Donovan. “Who called you?” Sherlock demanded, though he already knew the answer.
After the door had closed behind him, Irene turned to Sarah, pointed in opposite directions, and mouthed, “Fighting.”
Sherlock moved forward, briefly considered the hideous chair, then took a seat on the edge of the bed instead. “I’m sorry, John,” he said again, and it occurred to him that he would most likely be saying it for the rest of his life.
John waited. Sherlock could feel his flatmate’s expectancy crawling over him, but he couldn’t bring himself to meet John’s gaze. Instead, Sherlock scrambled mentally to come up with a way of telling John about Moriarty’s visit that wouldn’t anger or upset him. But every potential scenario ended with John stalking off either to his bedroom or, worse, out of the flat entirely. Sherlock felt as if he had just been checkmated at chess.
He turned his head to look at the man beside him. The smooth back was inviting, but Sherlock knew better than to touch a sleeping soldier. The one time he’d made that mistake, only his own quick reflexes had saved him from having his nose broken. Since then he’d resorted to waking John from a distance.
“Well, maybe Sherlock sized it for himself,” John retorted, suddenly feeling defensive. For some reason, the idea that Sherlock had gone to the trouble . . . Sherlock, who never put himself out for anyone, who wouldn’t even go to the grocery . . . It shook John at the core to consider the possibility that Sherlock might have had the ring sized for him.
“No, that’s—” Sherlock grabbed the frame from which the sketch had been taken and flipped it around to view the photo. “That’s part of Lambeth. And
They searched in silence for some while before John asked abruptly, “Why did you want to become a saint?” When Sherlock didn’t answer, John stopped and looked over at him, could tell by the way Sherlock was studying the page he was holding that he was only acting like he was absorbed in something, pretending not to have heard the question.
“I’m sorry it’s taken me so long,” Charles said. “There were a number of factors that prevented my coming.”
John grimaced. “He was being so . . . deliberate. Precise. It seemed like . . .” He swallowed. “Like the placement had meaning.”
God, why was he thinking about this? He sat up. He needed to find something to do, like maybe sort through the post.
But Sherlock had picked up the guidebook, flipped it open to the marked page. “Who says we’re staying there from May to August?”
“Sherlock,” said John. If he could get his flatmate to look at him, maybe he’d be able to discern the deeper feelings involved, if there were any.
John was trying to figure out what to do with both Mrs. Hudson’s cool box and the casket that Sherlock had handed over to him. “Yes . . .” He finally managed to get the box behind his feet while holding the reliquary on his lap; not a comfortable arrangement, but the best he could do.
“How do you know?” Lestrade asked. It came out more sharply than he’d intended, his mind having drifted to other things again.
“I . . . don’t know,” John admitted. He was too tired for trick questions and wished his companion would come to the point.
But Sarah wasn’t the type to let questions go unanswered, either. “Then you were there as what? Helping Sherlock?” she asked.
“She was there at the time.” Mycroft leaned his weight against a counter and took another hesitant sip of his tea.
“I need Irene,” Sherlock said suddenly. He looked down at himself and realized he didn’t have his phone. Was it still in the hired car? He had no idea what Moriarty’s men had done with that.
“Right. I’ll call you when we’re in,” John told her. As he hung up, he felt a wave of frustration. Sherlock’s unorthodox methods were starting to take a serious toll on John’s personal life, and John forged a new resolve to set things straight all around.
He wondered fleetingly if there were any chance he had morphine in his kit. Seemed unlikely but might be worth a look.
—but his eyes were closed. Either he really had fallen asleep, or he was studiously and steadfastly ignoring his sister.
Sherlock silently cursed Mycroft for not having buried that deeper. “What do you want to know?” he asked Lestrade.
“I don’t suggest we wait to find out,” said Sherlock as he joined him outside. John noted how tightly his companion held the reliquary, how white his knuckles were.
“How is it you’re always running into him when you visit, and I live there and never see him?” Sherlock asked.
John was formulating an appropriately snippy retort when Mrs. Hudson appeared in the doorway. “You’re up!” she crowed.
“Well, I’m no psychologist, but . . . In my experience, there’s something to be said for the theory that some people want to get caught.”
John turned to Charles with an apologetic smile. “You’ll have to forgive him; he’s had a lot going on just lately.”
benefit, not mine! None of what you do is for me! At best my wellbeing is a byproduct of your fascination with whatever mystery you’re solving at the time!”
Irene guided him around the museum to where Cleopatra’s Needle stood and found them a vacant bench, but Sherlock didn’t sit. Instead he pulled out his phone and began to pace as he dialed.
Lestrade cleared his throat. “Right, so . . . We should move on to what happened with you then, Doctor.”
“She’s a . . . medical professional . . .” Though Sherlock’s tone suggested he wasn’t persuaded of Sarah’s credentials.
“OH MY GOD,” Sarah said when Sherlock shed his coat and what remained of his shirt. She stood next to John in the glass booth that separated an antiquated computer from the radiology room. “What the hell happened?”
Christopher leaned in closer than made Sherlock comfortable, but Sherlock refused to give ground. “I’ve missed you.”
“Well, then,” said Sherlock, pushing the car to an even higher rate of speed, “allow me to show you what you’ve been missing.”
“Marks where the camera can catch them,” Sherlock finished dully as he turned circles in the space between the end of the bed and the desk, toying with the belt. “I remember. Explains why you model suits, I suppose.”
“Now, Elyse,” Gerrie said. Looking at John she added, “Though you must admit, it does appear a tad incriminating, leaving so suddenly.”
John rolled onto his side to face him. “Then as your doctor I will be required to take charge of your care.”
“In a way . . . It could be,” Sarah told him. “My parents have enjoyed many years of domestic bliss.”
“IT’S NOT YOUR fault,” Sarah told John as they picked at the Chinese food they’d ordered. “You had no way of knowing.”
Then the manager’s eyes lit with understanding. He held up a finger to indicate that John should wait and disappeared into his office, returning a minute later with another envelope. John accepted it with little grace but froze when he saw his name written on it. The handwriting was Sherlock’s.
“If you’re worried I don’t comprehend the damage my ‘death’ did to John, allow me to put you at ease. I am very much aware of it. But it was the lesser of evils, and in the end it will be for John and I to sort out between us. He needs no intermediary for his feelings, and I would guess he would be angry to learn of your trying to insert yourself into his affairs.”
This wasn’t entirely true, though Sherlock would have been hard pressed to describe the things that did unnerve him. None of the ones that sprang to mind were corporeal, for one thing; two dead bodies, regardless of their similarities to John and himself, were far from ‘spooky.’ Intriguing, yes. Frightening, no.
Sherlock allowed Irene to lead him out of the room and downstairs to one of the myriad of taxicabs that choked New York. His only thought was to get through the hour with as little effort as possible, maybe by nursing a drink and not saying much. He was so absorbed in this plan he almost didn’t notice when the cab stopped and Irene got out, forcing her to lean in and hiss, “Sherlock!”
But John had already come to the same conclusion. The weight and feel of the piece was too familiar for him to believe there could be another so identical to the one he was used to.
“No, I’m—” The fingertips were delicately feathering their way along the old wound. “That’s probably enough, don’t you think? It’s not like you’re painting the Sistine Chapel.”
“Devoted.” It being a weekday morning, the museum was far from busy, so there was no wait at the admissions desk. Irene handed Sherlock his ticket and a floor plan and gestured to the left. “Old Greek and Roman stuff is that way.”
Mycroft spared her a glance. “Surprised you didn’t come out earlier,” he remarked, “once you knew Sherlock was alive and well.”
“She’s not a suspect,” said John in hopeful and sympathetic tones, his inbred streak of chivalry coming to the fore, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John passed a wheeled basket piled with hospital laundry and paused. He glanced up and down the corridor. Empty. Eyed the basket. Checked his watch. Visiting hours would end soon, but if he were there as a doctor . . .
Mr. John had evidently found the remainder of the refreshment she’d offered their guest. Mrs. Grossman looked again at the stranger, who had lost all his color now.  “There,” she told him, “it’ll be no bother at all to have Dr. Watson take a look at you.”
“Of course I’m not disappointed!” said Harry far too loudly for a hospital, or even a bar, unless perhaps there was loud music involved. “But it’s a shame to worry Mum and Dad for no reason.”
Which meant it was no routine question of logic bothering him. Something deeper was troubling Sherlock Holmes.
“Mm,” was all Sherlock said in reply, uncertain how much conversation was to be expected on the subject. It was clear there had already been some in his absence, given John had done damage to Patrick’s face.
As Sherlock closed the door behind him, John had a thought. He strode over and pulled the door open. “Take my gun at least!”
He turned and found Sherlock watching him. John lifted his eyebrows in an unspoken question, and Sherlock asked, “Feeling more awake?”
It was a very strange feeling, but not a foreign one; he’d undergone a similar sensation after being wounded in Afghanistan. He supposed he’d been on medicine then, too.
“Well,” said Mrs. Grossman, who prided herself on her good manners and never liked disappointing people, “I should say the least I could do is offer you some tea before you go.”
“Ha!” John swiftly suffixed his involuntary bark of laughter with, “Sorry. Uh, no.” He paused. “I’ll have some of the carrot cake, Irene; it might be the last time I get to have any, if Sherlock gets his way.”
But John shook himself and said, “No, it’s fine. I’m fine. Um . . . I lost track of time, so I don’t know how often he was giving me the drugs, but there was more in the syringe each time. An opiate of some sort, clearly.”
IRENE TRAILED AFTER John as he strode down the sidewalk, working to keep up while still engrossed in the video on the phone. “Oh my God,” she said. “John! You missed it!”
Sherlock was aware of Lestrade’s true reason for stopping by, and he was somewhere between flattered and irritated by it. “Well,” he said now, “it’s little enough to go on, but we’ll see what we can find out. What’s the name of Lumley’s bakery?”
John stared at the steaming mug. He didn’t even like oolong that much; he preferred Darjeeling. Shouldn’t Sherlock know that by now?
And now, looking at the photograph, John didn’t want to leave it. But he knew he shouldn’t take it, either. Not if he was going to accomplish the clean break he needed.
Gerrie sat back in the chair, failing to hide her disappointment. But moments later she rallied, and sitting up again she said, “Well, I’m that glad that he has you to look after him, since he won’t let Mycroft. And you a doctor besides. I’m sure he’ll be happy to see you when he gets in. Not much fun for him, having only his mum for company.” And she heaved another sigh, offering John the opportunity to contradict this last statement.
“Try them and find out,” said John, sitting down again to finish his own meal, though he paused and looked at Mycroft before taking a bite. “
John started to laugh, huskily, and this time he couldn’t stop himself, even though it hurt. “I’m the fine tuning.”
“I’m sorry,” said John as he bent down for a closer look. “It was probably instantaneous. We should—” He broke off. He’d been about to suggest they go find Sherlock, but another thought sprang to mind. What if Henry had found Sherlock after all?
“And if Irene doesn’t come back tonight, where will she stay? Have you given her the keys to your flat?” Sherlock wasn’t sure how far the planning for this rendezvous had extended. He glanced around, set his untouched wine on the desk.
John ran his hands over his face. He needed to focus on more practical matters. The house wasn’t his now, not really; he should pack up and go back to London, start sorting things out there. Sherlock was gone for now, but who knew when he might be back? John couldn’t see staying at Baker Street, waiting. He needed to clear out and start over. He needed some distance.
“Never mind her,” said Sherlock as he passed back through the kitchen. “She won’t tell; will you, Chloe?” He threw her a wink and was gone, while she stared with barely concealed hatred after him.
Elyse wrung her hands and shook her head. John had never actually seen anyone do that before, hadn’t thought people really did that, but there it was. “Oh, Jeremy! Somebody shot Henry!”
Sherlock’s eyes drifted toward the tall windows that fronted the room, giving a view of the portico outside. “Mycroft suggested . . .” His voice trailed.
Charles returned from securing the door and instead of returning to the chair he’d been sitting in, he perched himself on the edge of the bed.
Irene sighed as they wove their way through, past and around people on the sidewalk. “Tamzen is usually more fun, but lately she’s too busy being angry at Jonah for not kicking his drug habit . . .” She darted a glance at her companion. “Sound familiar?”
“A lucrative enterprise,” said Charles measuring out the amount of liquid in the needle. “I’m going to assume you don’t have Sherlock’s tolerances.”
“Or something,” said John. “I’ll tell him to call you if and when I see him, but I have no idea when that will be. You’re better off trying yourself.”
John could practically hear Lestrade reading between the lines. “You two have a fight or something?”
On the way downstairs, Sherlock provided a list of instructions. “You’ll sit to her left, but don’t sit until she does. Mum’s a stickler for this sort of thing, in that way only people who weren’t born to it can be. Don’t let the amount of tableware alarm you, just watch me—”
But even as John was opening his door and telling himself that, no, he couldn’t leave Sherlock in the car, Sherlock opened his eyes. Started to sit up, then drew up short, his face contorting in a way that suggested he wasn’t sure what had just happened.
“I think he’ll be that irate at having lost to the Martlets, and he’ll be prepared to take it out on me,” said Sherlock grimly. “The fact that Elyse is willing to pay him is just a bonus.” He unlocked the street door and John followed him upstairs, then produced his key when it became evident Sherlock didn’t have his.
Sherlock was lifting the top slice of bread for a better look at the contents of his sandwich. “Uh . . . no. Are those grapes?”
Sherlock’s older brother looked up from whatever he’d been reading, something he’d no doubt picked up off one of the teetering piles strewn around the room.
But Moriarty was chuckling. “No need to worry on his account. Do you think he’s worried about you? If you’re lucky, he’ll be along in a little while. I’ve asked him to bring something by on your behalf.
Light, he needed light to see . . . what he didn’t want to see, but he had to look because Sherlock almost certainly needed, what? Medical attention? Was he even breathing? The darkness paired with the heavy bedspread made it impossible to tell.
“You should ask Charles,” Sherlock said absently as he reached over to adjust the blanket that shrouded John’s shoulders.
“Of course he’s planning something,” Sherlock said with no small exasperation. “And now he’s trying to distract us from whatever it is he’s up to.”
But the lily would be small and almost certainly in a drawer somewhere. Sherlock began walking past the racks the way one would walk past library shelves, stopping only when he found what—or rather, who—he’d been looking for.
JOHN FELT AWFUL. He felt dry despite the copious amounts of sweat that covered him and hot despite the shivers that wracked his body. Pulling air into his lungs seemed like a Herculean effort, and his heart was kicking like a snared rabbit. John pictured the lapin ripping his insides apart with the claws of its thumping rear feet. He imagined the blood bubbling up in his throat, dripping from his nose, ears, mouth. He needed surgery, he realized. The rabbit had to be extracted; he just needed a knife.
Things at Weald House promised to be mundane, even boring, which was fine with John after all the drama of late—the most recent adventure in London and the bizarre revelations of the day before. And while part of him kept telling him to go home, another part insisted he couldn’t possibly leave Sherlock to face things alone. Not for an entire week. So John began to look at the whole thing as a sort of holiday. Or maybe it was more like dinner theatre? Like he was some poor bloke pulled up from the audience to play the straight man in a parlour enactment.
normal since under usual circumstances they would never do that. Why create dirty dishes, after all?
So after his shower, John went back into Sherlock’s room and pulled the case from under the chest-of-drawers. His eyes strayed toward the letters, but John forced himself to ignore them. He gathered the needles and put everything else back.
As the Register began speaking, a pang of alarm darted through John. Did Harry have the ring? He started to look over his shoulder, wanting to ask her, but caught Sherlock’s worried frown. John stared back helplessly.
Sensing the growing tension, Irene turned to John and said, “We’ve converted the old nursery rooms on the third floor for your parents and sister.” She turned to Sherlock and continued, “And space for your mom, too, when she gets here.”
John resolved not to care and started for the butler’s pantry. He’d take all the keys if need be and try every one of them until he found the one that would free his car.
Mrs. Watson obliged by releasing Sherlock and stepping back. “How are you boys holding up? Nervous? Oh, it’s all right,” she went on without waiting for answers. “It’s normal to have nerves.
Sherlock returned, looking much more himself, and dropped John’s mobile phone on the bed. He held his own in his other hand. “I haven’t looked at them. If you’re feeling up to it . . .”
They arrived at the car, and as they settled in John began to dread the notion of having to sustain a conversation. It seemed ridiculous, but after all the lovely things Sherlock had just said to him, John felt pressure to come up with something equally eloquent. He hadn’t planned anything for the ceremony, and now he felt empty and unprepared, as if sitting for an exam for which he hadn’t studied. Words weren’t John’s strength (his now defunct blog proved that much); he was better at doing things to show he cared.
“In the pantry, under the sink.” John was moving to fetch it when she asked, “Do you think she got out of the pond?”
John watched him for a while, hoping for a clue so he wouldn’t have to ask, but he finally gave up. “What are you doing?”
John was curious but didn’t want to pry, literally or figuratively. Deciding it was quite likely Sherlock hadn’t eaten lunch that day either, John opted to get on with making some dinner. But when he was halfway to the kitchen, he heard Sherlock stir.
The second man took a seat in a chair beside the bed. “I hope for your sake and his that we’ve made some progress. It won’t do to have our customers dying. Makes it so difficult to keep business in the black.”
“Ah,” said Charles in understanding. “I simply hate to think you might be angry or disappointed, dearheart. I wasn’t sure how much you knew about the—the trial and my conviction and such. I know Mycroft was keen to keep you out of it, so I didn’t know how much filtered back to you.”
Sighing, John hoisted the statue and followed Sherlock down the turning staircase until they came to the landing about halfway down. Sherlock gestured wordlessly to the niche, and John returned the unidentified saint to his rightful place, silently asking for absolution on Sherlock’s behalf for having misused the holy icon. Not that John was a superstitious or even very religious man; he simply believed in erring on the side of caution.
And then, just as John was ready to begin stammering some kind of excuse for his being there, the woman broke into a smile. “Why, it’s John, isn’t it? Sherlock didn’t say you were coming.” And with that she had his arm and was towing him into the house.
Charles stared hard at John for a moment, and though he smiled, the eyes were hard. “It’s me you must forgive; I shouldn’t have come so late. I was simply so eager to see him.”
He didn’t shower—he didn’t trust leaving John alone that long—though he had, over the course of the days, several causes for changing his clothes.
Sighing, John wondered whether he should take the Tube or a cab to Lambeth. The Tube would take longer but felt less conspicuous. And something told John he should attempt to keep things low-key. Yet time seemed to be a factor in this whole affair. But as John turned to fetch his wallet, a jingle from his jacket pocket reminded him of Sherlock’s car keys.
Sherlock supposed Madeline might know where the portfolio was. At the very least she could get him access to the flat they had been planning to move into, in the off chance Markham had left it there. Upon reflection, Sherlock surmised it might be a task better left to John; he was better at dealing with people, especially women who were liable to burst into tears at the drop of a hat.
“Said you weren’t answering your phone,” Mrs. Grossman told him. “Probably can’t hear it when you’re riding.”
Sherlock’s visage darkened further. “Don’t call me that. Seriously, it’s rude to continue calling someone by a name they don’t like.”
John sighed. “Yes, I guess I did,” he answered, making it sound as if this fact somehow proved a point.
to me. Oh!” he added in surprise when John did roll the rest of the way over and tucked himself close.
“Fuck it,” John said as he found Sherlock in his contacts and dialed the number. “Answer it, goddamn it.”
John’s head spun and the room around him blurred. He blinked rapidly in an attempt to clear his vision. As he focused, John realized he wasn’t in the flat and wasn’t in a hospital; he was in a hotel room.
“Let him rest here a little first,” Sarah told him. “We can order something in. You haven’t eaten yet, have you?”
John felt the room sway around him. Instinctively he reached out, looking for a piece of furniture, something to hold onto, maybe a chair to sit in. Instead he was startled to find something soft and warm behind him, bracing him.
“Jeremy!” he exclaimed at seeing the old butler struggle with what was evidently a heavy load. “Let me help you with those. She’s in the yellow room.”
“No, really, I preferred not to watch Moriarty kill you. Which is what he would have done, right before killing me.”
“What’s it for? Does it prove something?” Sherlock asked. “I’ve always assumed it’s more for the guests than the two people being married.”
The cane planted itself in John’s line of sight, and holding it, Moriarty slid down so that he could look up into John’s lowered gaze. So John closed his eyes. Felt Moriarty’s hand on his cheek then his chin. Didn’t resist when Moriarty leveraged his head and bent closer to murmur, “You’re going to die, John. How does it feel to know that?”
John nodded absently, and Gerrie finally began to eat, giving John and Sherlock the freedom to eat as well. Sherlock surprised John by attacking his meal with barely restrained gusto, though upon reflection, John counted three days since he’d last seen his flatmate eat anything. Which wasn’t unusual; Sherlock’s appetite was like a tide, out for long stretches before washing ashore again.
Sherlock had lapsed into silence, but Lestrade could tell he was impatient by the way his eyes darted at everything they passed and his fingers tapped a subconscious melody on his knee. Lestrade wanted to be able to tell Sherlock everything was going to be fine, but he didn’t know that for certain, and he’d been in law enforcement long enough not to make the rookie mistake of offering empty assurances.
John whipped his head back around. “It’s everywhere! You wear it like an invisible suit! You won’t even let me—” He reached toward the cut on Sherlock’s temple, but Sherlock deftly drew away. “Maybe we should get
But then the steps moved away, and with that John made a decision. He stood and was startled to discover he was shaking.
“Oh, God,” said John, bringing his hands to his face while Sarah blanched beside him. “Sorry,” he said to her, “sorry, I’m just—I’m giving him a little leeway tonight.”
room, the one he’d so carefully constructed to suit his needs, and resentment began to bubble up once more. He’d come to love that room and that house and the people there, both at Weald House and in the local area. But John also wasn’t any good at lying, and certainly not over any length of time; how could he possibly pretend this was all his when he knew Sherlock was alive?
But the paper appeared older than that. It was the kind of lined notepaper students might use, folded in the way a letter would be, and slightly yellowed with age.
If Elyse picked up on the sarcasm, she was too polite to show it. “Yes,” she said again, turning her smile toward Sherlock. “And how is London?”
John made it a point not to look at his flatmate this time as he wondered whether Sherlock would do as he’d been told. There seemed to be a long wait, but at last Sherlock came the rest of the way into the kitchen, took the platter off the counter, and brought it to the table.
There was a stretch of silence, and John began to wonder whether the car hadn’t heard him and if he should just go ahead and start driving. But as he sorted out how to use the paddle shifters, the car instructed him, “State your destination.”
John was ready to tell her exactly where she could go, but Irene’s laughter had drawn Sherlock’s attention from across the room. He took in the sight of Irene’s hand on John’s arm and the way she was beaming up at him, and moved as if to walk over. But Christopher said something then, dragging Sherlock’s attention back to him.
“Don’t get snide with me, Sherl, you know it doesn’t work,” said Irene. “Look, I know you had what you thought were good reasons for doing what you did, and it can’t have been an easy decision to make—”
Lestrade did not fail to observe the way John flinched at this statement, and moved by something indefinable, the inspector half snapped, “Well, if anything should happen to you and John, I’ll be sure to check yours straight away.”
“I was only surprised because he’d never done anything else I’d asked of him,” muttered Sherlock, now sorting with barely contained fury.
At the moment of opening his eyes, there came a surge of confusion. Sherlock was used to waking suddenly, but he had not realized he was asleep. For the previous four days, in his drive to be attentive to his flatmate’s needs Sherlock had done nothing more than doze; now he mentally berated himself for slacking in his duties.
SHERLOCK DID NOT wait to be buzzed, waved or escorted into his brother’s building; he sailed through the common areas and past a number of raised eyebrows, John hurrying nervously in his wake, casket in hand.
When he arrived, the hotel lobby was vacant; even the desk lacked staff. John had to ring the bell several times before anyone appeared. “I was told there was someone here in need of an English-speaking doctor,” he told the man impatiently. Because now he was starting to worry; medical needs were nothing to take lightly.
“I’m not looking for what I already have, John. I can do stylish and sophisticated all on my own. I want the person who can save me when I’ve been shot, the one who’ll go looking for me when I’m lost, someone who reminds me to eat and lets me pretend to be brave when the truth is the only reason I’m not terrified is that he’s standing next to me. That’s you.”
Except that he couldn’t find John. The living area was abandoned, and John wasn’t in his room. Sherlock even checked his own room on the off chance John had decided to go through some more of his things. But no, John was most definitely not in the flat.
Sherlock frowned and started to shrug off John’s hand, but even that small motion seemed to threaten his equilibrium. He shot Mycroft an inscrutable look, but the older Holmes remained stone-faced.
AFTER MAKING THEMSELVES as neat and hay-free as they could, John and Sherlock returned to the house with the sole intention of showering (separately, just to keep focus) and readying for the arrival of John’s parents. But Mrs. Grossman was already preparing lunch in the kitchen, and when she asked, “Did you have a nice ride, then, lads?” John’s stricken expression nearly gave the game away. Lucky for them she was intent on her work.
John took a step back, working to mask his hurt, though it hardly mattered because Sherlock’s attention was on the door. “Not like Moriarty to run,” he mused.
Mrs. Hudson bustled back in with a pile of blankets. “Here now, no use crying over it,” she said as she set them at the foot of the bed. “He’ll be fine, you’ll see. Have some tea, and don’t worry about the tray; I’ll come back for it later.” She paused at the door. “And I’ll bring you up something to eat. The two of you look half starved on top of it all. Just don’t get used to it,” she warned before sweeping out again.
me? You’ve been dead for two years, or might as well have been, and you come here to tell me you missed me? You could have saved yourself the trouble, and me some—What kind of person does that?” he asked abruptly, his voice rising. “What kind of person puts someone they profess to care about through something like that? It’s . . . deranged.”
“Hungry? I can’t see how you wouldn’t be,” the landlady went on. “I’ve brought up some toast for Sherlock, but I can make more, no trouble. I just didn’t know you were awake,” she added with a hint of rebuke.
John took a deep breath and reminded himself that being in hospitals made Sherlock peevish, and that he shouldn’t take it personally. “I was hoping this would keep them from kicking me out in the next half hour.”
Sherlock turned then, his expression severe. “If there were any risk to the public, certainly. But there’s not, and they have no right to marketed voyeurism. If it were me, John, or you, would you want to see it as a headline?” He turned back to the wall without waiting for an answer. “Here, I think.”
But maybe that didn’t matter. After all, the words weren’t for him; Sherlock cast them off and out like so much useless weight, like stones found in a pocket. And if one was diamond, what of it? Sherlock had no more use for it than any other rock.
Irene began circling the table. “So that eliminates . . .” She began turning cards face down on the table. “But that’s just flavor,” she said. “You can have any of these designs, depending on the kind of icing you want.”
“Yes, because of course if there were, that person would want to make sure we knew it,” Sherlock said. “It’s the lack of evidence that proves it. Assuming they drank the hemlock, there would need to be at least one glass or cup containing the dregs.”
“I don’t see how; I was only being honest.” She paused. “And what are they doing to the master suite that I can’t stay there?”
It took every modicum of Sherlock’s willpower to keep him from putting a bullet in Charles right then. But Sherlock had a measure of curiosity in him about all that had transpired, and he was determined to sate that before his bloodlust. So as Charles leaned farther forward, Sherlock stepped up and placed the muzzle of the gun at the nape of Charles’s neck. “I’d say you’re already in trouble.”
“I don’t belong to you any more. You don’t get to—to take up where you left off as if you hadn’t . . .” John shook his head as if clearing it of something unwanted.
“You’d be first in line, I take it,” Sherlock snapped, then sighed. “She would have her choice of suitors, certainly, if her brother didn’t keep her leashed like one of his damn dogs.”
Michael’s eyes darted from Sherlock to John and back. Then, apparently deciding there was no trick involved, he stepped forward. But as he reached for the silver casket, a shot rang out, shattering glass in a nearby window.
“I really expected more people around,” Harry sniffed. “More flowers at least. Those are nice, though,” she said. “Who’re they from?”
“OKAY, WAIT,” IRENE said as they started up the staircase to the museum’s main entrance. Sherlock obediently stopped walking, and Irene was several steps ahead before she realized it. “I didn’t mean
“There may not be much affection between us, Sherlock, but I’m still your older brother, and as far as I’m concerned the only one allowed to bully you is me.”
, John thought as they walked in charitable silence to the stables, the tension blowing off of them like so much dust.
“What? Oh.” Sherlock obligingly took the rein and led Brandywine into the stable where he snapped cross ties onto the halter and began untacking. “Tell me what you know,” he told John as he worked.
Knowing that Sherlock still had difficulty bending over, John reached down to retrieve it. “The Tower,” he read as he handed it to his companion.
Sherlock flinched, his eyes flicking to meet John’s briefly before turning away again. “Don’t. Touch me.”
“Lovely,” Sherlock murmured, turning his attention back to the computer. “The lilies aren’t much of a research subject, although at least two sites claim they work in tandem as a sort of combination lock or key . . . to some unspecified safe or vault.”
“No.” Sherlock took the opportunity to step back farther so that John could see their guest. “John, this is Mr. Charles Whitcombe.”
A doctor emerged through the heavy wooden doors that led back to the emergency operating rooms. She made a beeline for Patrick, who deftly pushed John a tiny bit forward. The doctor hesitated. “Are you all here for Mr. Holmes?”
He hadn’t even waited for the door of the office to finish slamming shut before starting to yell. Irene took this as a bad sign, and she backed up until her rear connected with the large desk that filled most of the space in the room.
Mycroft had been trying to tell him something. Lambeth had some kind of connection to the Martlets. Not a contemporary bond, but something older and deeper, maybe even at the root.
“Indeed,” Charles agreed. “Now, if you’re not going to eat, we’ll get on with it.” He crossed to a large desk and picked up a needle and a vial. “If the chemicals are balanced right, this will be one of the fastest addicting street drugs on the market.”
Sherlock wasn’t the least bit satisfied. Breaking Charles’s nose hadn’t been near enough. But Lestrade had wrenched the gun from his hand, so the best Sherlock would have been able to do would be to kick Charles, if only Lestrade weren’t preventing him.
Sherlock felt as if the world around him had slowed down. “Irene . . . has a way . . . of making . . . the most ridiculous things seem . . . like a good idea.”
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Mycroft asked. “I have more options for helping you if you stay.”
No getting away with ignoring her now, Sherlock supposed. He pulled in a breath and looked at her squarely. “Hardly.”
Sherlock felt as if he’d just been tossed into the deep end of a swimming pool. They were dangerously close to a discussion of feelings and all the messy, subjective points of view that would entail. Desperate to stick to the facts, and thus stay on solid ground, Sherlock said, “I went to New York to do as they’d asked so I could get you back.”
That earned him a glare, but at least it got things moving. Sherlock rose and started for the doors without checking to see that John followed—which, of course, he did. And continued for no little time, always a few steps behind as Sherlock moved swiftly in the direction of the falls.
Or maybe he shouldn’t wear it at all. Maybe this was a test and wearing the ring was the equivalent of a failing grade. But on second thought that seemed unlikely because Sherlock took slights personally, and to not wear the ring would be a slight. Wouldn't it?
John reluctantly approached the horse, shying when Morningstar turned his head toward the newcomer. Elyse frowned. “There’s no reason to be frightened, Doctor. Morningstar is quite docile.”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut briefly in an attempt to reset himself, though he filed this new data away for later analysis. “Dinner then,” he said, and Irene let out the breath she’d been holding. “We’ll bring something for John, and I’ll want to speak to his doctor . . .” He turned and nearly walked directly into Mr. Watson.
Sherlock hung up and stood, thinking to return Lestrade’s phone and ask him to drive him to Kensington, but he drew back when Lestrade, now standing alone, turned to him with an unexpectedly pleased expression on his face. “There were two men taken from your flat.”
SHERLOCK STARED AT the door for a long while after his brother had exited. “We’re going to have to start locking that,” he finally said.
“No, it’s—” He looked again at Lestrade, who had stepped away with the doctor. “A friend’s. You can call Mycroft if you need to reach me.”
“Oh, of course not, dear,” said Mrs. Hudson. “I had the delivery man bring it. But it was quite the trial.”
John could tell from Sherlock’s voice that his flatmate was halfway asleep already. After hours of feeding his curiosity, he’d satisfied something in himself—something John never would be able to—and could rest, if only for a while.
“It’ll be a game to him,” Mycroft said. “He won’t send his best because he doesn’t want them to succeed.”
“ISN’T THE FLAT back—?” John began, thinking that after three visits he should know where he was by now. But as he glanced up and down the block, he realized he still had no idea.
“It’s not some beauty contest,” Sherlock snapped, finally bringing his gaze to meet Lestrade’s. “He doesn’t get a consolation prize for being runner up. He doesn’t get to walk away with ‘almost made it.’”
“I phoned him last night when we got back to the flat. He knows the circumstances we’re laboring under.”
“We could pick something out . . . somewhere . . .” John went on, looking out the window again. “Where are we going?”
Just as he’d expected, a room key was waiting for him at the Dorchester, and Sherlock once again silently thanked his brother for accommodating his needs. Sherlock supposed he should do something nice for Mycroft, and if he got through this without ending up dead or in prison for murder, he’d be sure to show his appreciation. Maybe he’d actually agree to help Mycroft with something . . .
Sherlock complied in silence, was buttoning his shirt and contemplating his bare feet, when John said suddenly, “We shouldn’t do this.”
But Irene was nodding, pulling him into the tiny apartment. “Oh yes! You had that same look when Christopher walked out. And you didn’t come all the way over here to see my latest show.” This last was delivered with a certain amount of censure.
She laughed, clapping like a child who has performed a great trick. “What’s one more mess in this place?” she asked him.
Sherlock did not sympathize, nor did he deny Charles’s allegations. Instead he simply stated, “And yet here you are. What could be so important that you would risk my brother’s long reach?”
Lestrade shifted his weight slightly, a direct sign of his discomfort. “Charles Whitcombe,” he said.
John ran his eyes over the map of abuses that was Sherlock’s body. “Her lily must be one of these.” He reached out as if to touch, but Sherlock stepped back and plucked his shirt from the chair.
Irene hesitated but decided to let the issue slide. “It wasn’t that hard. With the right look and some convincing credentials, I was able to get access. Jonah made the replacement.”
Sherlock looked to John once more. John had at last closed his eyes, though they were streaming now as if he were crying. Sherlock knew this was a symptom of the withdrawal, but he hated the sight of it. He returned to the bed. Sat down. Brushed one of the wet cheeks with his hand.
“They’ve always been high. You used to think this was fun, but now it’s nigh impossible to get you to agree to come along.”
“John.” It was no use asking what was wrong, Sherlock knew; this afternoon was only another item in what had become a steadily growing list.
“Has been in our possession for some time. It took us a while to figure out what we needed to open it.”
Charles froze, but maddeningly he also laughed. “You never struck me as the type to play jealous lover, Sherlock.”
“I’m sorry,” Irene said. “I was just trying to find a way for Sherl to release some . . . tension. I didn’t know you were coming too, or I never . . . But wait!” She placed a hand on John’s forearm, and he found himself staring at her well-manicured fingers; the woman had absolutely no boundaries. “This is perfect, actually!” she went on, laughing. “You and I can go to dinner and—”
The sound of footsteps in the corridor drew Irene’s attention back to the doorway. Finally! Sherlock was coming.
Sherlock hesitated. “All right,” he said softly, setting something on the tray beside the untouched water and bread before exiting. And John didn’t want to look because he knew what it was and what it meant, but his eyes were drawn to it anyway.
Mycroft shrugged as he went over to a highly polished bar and began pouring drinks. “It’s only gold plate; the value is mostly sentimental. And historical, I suppose, if one were a collector of such things.”
Sherlock took the shirt and slipped into the bathroom to change. “No need to be modest,” Irene teased.
“Something like that,” Sherlock murmured, turning blindly for the door. Was there dust in the room? Why did his eyes hurt? “I should go . . .”
“A swift or a martin, by most accounts,” Mycroft told him. “Used to be people didn’t think they had feet, so it was thought they didn’t land. Because they were always flying, they were considered tireless, and so on a coat of arms signified unceasing effort.
Sherlock, now done destroying the evidence, moved on, leaving John to catch up. “Threw it in the pond. How do you think my boots got so muddy?”
John stared at him for a long time, and it suddenly struck Sherlock as absurd that they were having this conversation while lying in John’s bed after four and more days of having been sequestered in their flat as if on some disastrous, backward honeymoon.
“Merely a precaution,” said Moriarty as he finished with John’s wrists. “It’ll take a while for you to bleed to death from that. And in the meantime, we can have such fun together. Oh! Your hot water is ready.”
Patrick sailed through the doors, and John wondered fleetingly if he’d passed Mycroft on the way, before having less charitable thoughts when Patrick took the seat on his other side and whispered in John’s ear, “I’ve released him into your custody.”
Mycroft only blinked at him. “Set it on the desk there, if you would, Doctor,” he told John, though his eyes never left his brother.
Irene waved the idea away. “You can’t think about it like that. John is a big boy; he can decide whether he wants to be with someone or not, and whether that someone is good for him or not.”
ONCE SETTLED TO her satisfaction, Gerrie made her way back downstairs in search of someone to greet her the way she felt she should be greeted. She found her oldest son settled in a chair in the library, reading one of the several daily papers he made it a habit to peruse.
“AH, JOHN,” SIGHED Sherlock as he entered room 367 and fell into the chair beside the bed. It was a strangely square contraption, filled with foam and covered in a particularly awful shade of sea green vinyl. Sherlock frowned down at the piece of furniture in which he sat, picked idly at a place on the left arm where a seam had begun to fray, then reluctantly allowed himself to lean back, only to have the chair unexpectedly lean with him.
SHERLOCK CAME TO in his usual abrupt fashion and discovered he couldn’t see. Blinked. Felt his eyelashes brush against something.
“I know my son, John, so take my word for it: you could move halfway across the globe, and he’d go find you.”
Sherlock dismissed the notion of karma, the belief that he somehow deserved this as cosmic punishment. Even if he did, John did not.
John didn’t bother to argue, but as he turned to guide Sherlock back to the clearing where they’d found Henry, Sherlock said, “Your gun.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, instead making straight for the pile of post John had left beside his computer. He had only just begun flipping through it when there came a knock at the door. “Must be, if he’s been watching the flat to see when I get home.” He waited a moment to see if John would come back to answer it, was more than a little annoyed when he didn’t, and resigned himself to opening the door on his own.
Stepping forward, John offered his hand to their guest. “John Watson, pleased to meet you,” he said firmly, drawing Charles inside before turning to Sherlock, who was looking at him with an incomprehensible expression on his face. John met his gaze and put a hand on his arm. “Sherlock, sweetheart, why don’t you make some tea?”
Sherlock pulled his shirt the rest of the way off, then wasn’t sure what to do with it, but John took it and set it aside on the nightstand. “Lie back.”
“The night Moriarty . . .” Sherlock thought back. “I was going to meet Lestrade at a crime scene in Shoreditch.”
After tossing his phone onto the chair with his coat, Sherlock reached for Christopher’s belt. “How bad have you been?” Sherlock asked. It was a rote question, bred from old habits, and he knew Christopher’s answer before it was spoken.
“If you keep letting him rope you into things, you’re eventually going to get hurt. Well, look! You have already!”
Sherlock set his cup on the counter and preceded John to the door, opening it and holding it for him. John mumbled a thank you and stepped out into the mid-summer warmth.
Sherlock stood and Mycroft waited for his brother to pass and exit the room ahead of him, an old habit born of Sherlock not always following when he was expected to. But Sherlock stopped beside his sibling and said, “I almost lost him, Mycroft.”
So the gun would be somewhere Eoin wouldn’t normally have a reason to look. But John wouldn’t keep it too far out of reach, either. John’s sock drawer yielded nothing, but at the top of the closet Sherlock found John’s old medical kit, and in it, amid a collection of implements and old vials, was the gun.
But Sherlock was shaking his head. “You don’t get up from making love, go drink a paralytic poison, then go back to bed. And there’s no note.”
a distraction, but Sherlock knew it was only because he allowed it. And he allowed it because he enjoyed it. The walls Sherlock had spent years building, the ones that enabled him to compartmentalize people and his work and let him divide his emotions from the whole, had been breached, and the sensation was so novel, was so like a high or a rush, that he hadn’t bothered to reseal the fortification.
So with a furtive glance over his shoulder at the door, John lowered the bed rail and gingerly lay down on his side of the bed (and it
“Your father instructed us to carry on,” Sherlock reminded him. “And he strikes me as someone who is used to having his orders followed.”
LATER, ONLY A handful of moments would stand clear in John’s mind, one of them being how agitated Sherlock seemed when John first set eyes on him standing on the small dais in front of the seated guests. John knew that Sherlock would have been pacing if he hadn’t been so very aware of all the eyes, that he might have done so anyway if Mycroft weren’t silently willing him to remain in place. But once Sherlock saw John he grew calm, and John understood. Sherlock was overstimulated, needed something to focus on, and John was that something.
Sherlock scanned the available furniture, none of it appealing. The sofa had a distinct sag to its middle and was covered by a crocheted blanket that looked more itchy than homey. The chair was worn enough that Sherlock suspected one could feel the springs driving into his back should he sit there. But there was a small dining table with two straight back chairs against one wall. He decided one of those chairs would do.
“Me? No, I can’t imagine I have a reason to be angry. Let’s see, you went to New York while the man you were afraid of held me hostage and forced me into a drug habit that resulted in what I can honestly say has been the worst . . . however many days it’s been of my life . . .”
Understanding began to crystalize in Sherlock’s brain. John’s upbringing didn’t allow him to take his sister to task for her behavior, so John chose to avoid her rather than deal with the constant frustration of not being able to chastise her.
Sherlock turned his attention to the man who stood at the foot of the bed. Tall and muscular, thinning hair, good posture. Military. Possibly militant as well. At the very least, he clearly had expectations about how his son should behave. Yelling at his sister was evidently
Sherlock relaxed again and gave the hand a small squeeze. John suddenly realized how much he missed being close to this man. It was easy enough in a tiny flat in London—sometimes that was too close. But out here, and in separate bedrooms (
That line of thought was getting him nowhere, John realized, but he seemed unable to shake free of it.
“It’s under construction,” John told her as he gathered three of the bags, leaving Jeremy with the two least heavy pieces. “Besides, the yellow room is the nicest one.”
Mycroft harrumphed in a way that caused Sherlock to think his brother didn’t want to talk about it any more than Irene. “Tea?”
feel better,” said Sherlock. “Do you want me to talk about it? What do you want to hear, that he started at the top and worked his way down? That he told me to close my eyes and think of England?”
But John couldn’t process what was going on. He clutched the case, his eyes darting between Moriarty and the bedroom door.
Maybe if he ignored her, she would go away? Like one of those animals—what were they called?—that played dead . . .
The sense of foreboding he’d been battling rose up again, threatening to choke him. John wasn’t superstitious by nature; Sherlock never would have tolerated him if he had been. But something about this made John feel as if they were tempting fate. At the very least, did Sherlock have to wear it on his left hand?
“What? Oh,” said Mrs. Watson as she turned to John. “All right, Johnny dear, we’ll be back to see you . . . when? Tonight? Tomorrow?”
But this statement smacked of paranoia; Sherlock needed more facts before he’d be willing to voice such a sentiment. And maybe, just a little,
Sherlock transformed his expression into something suitably grave. “Awful,” he agreed. “And are you . . . a friend of John’s?”
“Good old John, he’ll do anything for you, won’t he?” John demanded. “Stitch up your cuts, pretend to be your boyfriend—”
Moriarty’s smile became strained, and for the first time Sherlock could see into how affected he was by the situation. Whatever these Martlets had done to him—killing Lumley, maybe more—had impacted Moriarty more than he was readily willing to admit. “It doesn’t matter,” he answered now, turning toward the door, just inside which Sherlock still stood. Not wanting to appear to be giving ground, the detective stepped aside only slightly to allow Moriarty to move past him. But Moriarty paused in the doorway and said, “Lumley and Markham were the bell. Time to move on to the book.” And with that, he stepped out and was gone.
Then John and Mr. Watson returned, John blinking at everything around him as if he’d never seen any of it before, and the group went outside to meet Mycroft in the Range Rover. The trip was an eerily quiet one and seemed to take far longer than it should, despite Mycroft’s aggressive driving. In the end it took no longer than half an hour, but time had become elastic; John had the sense it was bending strangely around him, and he found it impossible to believe that not more than two hours before, he and Sherlock had been standing before all their friends and kin, well and whole and happy.
“In my pocket.” John came over and slipped an arm around Sherlock to ease him away from the support of the car. “Come on,” he said, as if coaxing a small dog.
“Where is he?” Henry boomed as he flung the front door open without having bothered to ring the bell.
But Sherlock was beginning to understand that John needed something more from him. And John was safe enough to experiment with. So after exhausting himself with research on the case, Sherlock had showered, put on his pajamas, and gone to John’s room. In an attempt to maintain some control over the situation, Sherlock had anchored John with his arm; John was sometimes a fitful sleeper.
John pulled open the drawer and indeed found a little leather-bound volume, which he picked up. He saw it had been lying on a pen.
“I can’t. I don’t. But, John, if you had seen him . . .” Sherlock searched for a way to explain, but as someone who didn’t usually trust in intuition, he was at a loss to articulate what amounted to a gut feeling. “He was upset, John. About what they’d done.”
“And this is your evidence that he cares? Sherlock would be the first to point out it’s circumstantial.”
John blinked rapidly. “There was . . . a crime. I was at the scene, so . . . They need my DNA to match what they find.”
The landlady stared a little longer before going to the door. “Do try to be nice to him,” she pleaded. “He’s still not completely well.”
From somewhere outside the storeroom came a loud, protesting voice. “I thought he was CID! He said he was a detective!”
John had no need to ask either who was speaking or about whom he was inquiring. “Mycroft,” he replied, forcing himself to be pleasant. “Always nice to hear from you.”
“Well, that’s a start,” Irene said cheerily. “No nuts, no doilies. We’re narrowing it down at least.”
John turned and saw that they’d made it about halfway around the pond now. Looking across it, he realized they’d been walking slightly uphill, too; the pond lay a little below them and the house farther down the slope still, just past the tree line.
And when John had believed there was no alternative to living without Sherlock because Sherlock had been dead (or so John thought), John had eased himself back into the stream of the normal world and managed to pull off a fair imitation of someone with a life of his own.
“She doesn’t know you well enough to trust you. If Mother did it, that would work, but I don’t think Mother would ever—Ah, you can get the best view of the house from here.”
“Really?” John looked over his shoulder as if expecting to be able to see flags, tents, people—whatever constituted this jubilee. “Should we go?”
John shrugged. “So kill me, kill him, kill us both. You still won’t have won by your wits, only by default.”
“Not at first,” Sherlock said. “But eventually I needed funds, and I couldn’t tap into what I’d left to you; it would have been noticed.” He sighed. “I was only stopping by; I didn’t mean for you to see me.”
“You received a letter, didn’t you?” Moriarty asked. “Every initiation is equal parts an offer and a threat.”
“You can wake up in the cab, we’ll eat at Mycroft’s, and we’ll be done well before you need to be to work. Get dressed.”
“He made it plenty clear that he didn’t want me anywhere near them,” said Sherlock, rising. “Anyway, he has Eoin to back him up.”
John had forgotten he’d put it in the back of his waistband. Though it was concealed by his jumper, Sherlock’s sharp eyes had noticed it immediately.
“WELL, I’M GLAD you’re happy to see me,” said Irene when Sherlock came down the stairs, his expression one of preoccupied irritation.
John thumbed open the lid. Inside was a ring, the gold band marked in a sort of Celtic knot design, a large oval sapphire at the apex. It was lovely and clearly old, for though it was polished, it showed signs of long wear.
Sherlock shook his head slowly. “He’d talked about leaving, but never in concrete terms. It was rather more poetic.”
“Really?” John didn’t hide his surprise; he’d assumed anyone who’d known Sherlock as long as Irene would have met his mother at some point.
“Christopher adored him, you know,” said Irene. “He would have stayed for as long as Sherl let him.”
Sighing, John stepped into the flat. “What’s a Candlemas mural look like, exactly?” he asked as he began sorting through the nearest stack.
Sarah stuck her head in farther and saw Sherlock was lying facedown on the bed. “Ribs must be feeling better then,” she remarked.
Sherlock looked again to John, who was intent on his cake. “Yes,” he said again, handing back the nearly untouched slice of lemon chiffon. “Come on, John.”
“What?” John retorted, momentarily confused by the question. “No,” John assured him once he’d concluded that Sherlock was worried about his shoulder, “it’s fine.”
Sherlock withdrew, sitting farther back in the chair, and John watched as the face—the face he thought he’d never see again in life—fell blank. “Mrs. Grossman, please give us a minute.”
But Irene shook her head. “I don’t know John very well, but Sherlock will be a mess if we can’t get them back together.”
“Tell them I’ll send them a bill,” Sherlock told him as he opened the door. “And that next time they have need of my services, they should ask me outright.”
But John shook his head. “That’s not a good idea. It’s bad enough I agreed to take you out of the hospital; I don’t want anything to compromise you.”
John wasn’t sure what to say. He could tax Sherlock with having shot a neighbor’s dog, but he didn’t see that it would do any good. So he backtracked. “So how can I help with Miss Baskerville?”
“Wait!” said Irene, standing to go after him. “John, I promise, I didn’t know . . .” She stopped. “But then who sent you the text?”
Throwing back the sheet, he sat up, collected his trousers from the floor, pulled them on and slipped into the living room, stopping short at what he found.
“Certainly. He talked so much more about you than about any of his other, er, friends. Made you sound very interesting.”
Mrs. Hudson came twice each day, quietly leaving and removing sandwiches and tea. Sherlock made himself nibble from time to time, only to avoid a lecture. And maybe, of lesser import, to spare her feelings.
They’d only been off the Shuttle a short while, traveling now through Belgium, Sherlock having chosen a direction at random. John was sure the view would be lovely, if only he could stomach seeing it fly past at 160 kph. Maybe more. He was too afraid to even peek at the speedometer.
John looked toward the house again, but they were coming down again now and the trees were beginning to mask the building. He dropped his eyes, trying to think of something to say, and then saw—
“I don’t . . . know,” Sherlock admitted. The words pained him; he didn’t like not knowing things. “But maybe he’d be happier with Eoin, or anyone else for that matter. Maybe being with him is a way of hurting him.”
“He doesn’t mean anything by it, you know,” Mrs. Hudson soothed. “It’s the stress; you know how he gets.”
John decided he’d go one better by bringing his and Sherlock’s bags down and putting them in the car directly, thus saving them a later trip. He only hoped he’d be able to tell which car was Sherlock’s.
“Well, can I come in?” And here was Charles, all warmth and camaraderie, like an old friend stopping by. Never mind that it was after midnight now, that it was clear Charles had been watching the flat and waiting for Sherlock to come home.
Sherlock ripped the sketch in half, ripped those pieces in half again, and pulled a lighter from his coat pocket.
So he’d hired Mrs. Grossman through an agency and a service to come regularly to tend the grounds. And when he’d found himself strangely reluctant to dissolve the stables as he’d originally intended, John had hired Tim, the teenage son of a local farmer, to see to the horses.
John glanced one more time at the door, stretching his ears for the telltale sound of footsteps on the staircase. Nothing. Then he turned and looked at the statue. “It didn’t break,” he remarked.
Sherlock did rise then and pushed past Sarah. “Lestrade,” he acknowledged. “Have you brought John’s gun?”
JOHN HAD KEPT his head lowered so that most of the scalding water ran over his neck and back, though plenty splashed his shoulders and traveled around his neck to his chest.
Irene shrugged. “To get something to eat? And don’t tell me you’re not hungry,” she added preemptively.
He ascertained which of the various noises his flatmate made should be acted upon and which could be disregarded.
A waiter approached and paused as he recognized Irene from earlier, his curiosity obvious. Irene grinned broadly and pointed to her companion. “This is my other one!”
He ran his hands over his face, took a deep breath, and selected the most recent letter from the pile. Which, upon reflection, wasn’t all that recent, since it hadn’t been sent to Baker Street but to Kensington, where Sherlock had lived with his brother.
Behind him, Sherlock heaved a sigh of exasperation. “Suit yourself, John; I’ve done what I can.” It was a clear dismissal.
“I should probably tell him about the ceremony,” Sherlock said absently. “God, I hope Irene hasn’t said anything yet.” He stood. “I should probably—”
But the idea that he was responsible for what was happening . . . That, traced back to the roots of the problem, was not outside the realm of possibility.
“There’s a railway,” Sherlock observed when they arrived, “and a platform . . .” He was thoughtful about it, but John ascribed this to Sherlock’s general interest in how things worked. Only later would he come to comprehend Sherlock’s true motive for the walk that night.
John wasn’t sure if Sherlock meant the statement or the packed overnight bag. Wordlessly, he hefted the case from its place on the bed. Sherlock picked up the garment bag and gestured for John to precede him out the bedroom door. Reluctantly, John complied.
Thus reminded of more pressing problems, John sighed and went to collect his toiletries. But when he came out of the bathroom after fetching his shaving kit, he found Sherlock pulling on his coat once more.
Sherlock answered “yes” at the same moment John said “no.” When Sherlock frowned a question at him, John said, “I’m not ready to see anyone.”
Sherlock looked at him as if he’d gone daft, so John dropped the subject, grateful for once that they were nearly to Mycroft’s. But then Sherlock murmured, “The uncertain glory of an April day.”
John gave the kind of shrug that comes with being resigned to having nothing unique to offer. He was there to state the obvious, to trail behind the shiny Sherlock Express like an unnecessary caboose whose only potential function was to signal the end of a train of thought. “Only that this one is or was married.”
Sherlock looked at her, then quickly away. “Visit?” he asked her as he stepped over to join the two men.
“Then Chloe felt they should get a fair shot at being together. After all, Elyse had no other ready suitors.”
He tried to reason that perhaps Charles had only been making sure John didn’t drown. But that only made him want to laugh at his own self-delusional naiveté.
Not wanting to move Sherlock if he could avoid it, John carefully slipped a hand under Sherlock’s back to check for an exit wound. There was none. A small relief.
John allowed his shoulder to bump Sherlock’s arm in a semi-affectionate gesture, the type that could be easily shrugged off if it became clear that Sherlock was not feeling open to such things at the moment. But Sherlock merely glanced at John, then reached for his hand. Frowned slightly. “Does that hurt?” he asked.
He kicked off his muddy trainers just inside the kitchen door and headed up the hallway with the plan of packing his things before hunting down his car keys. But as he passed the library, he heard Gerrie call, “John?”
Tamzen eyed them speculatively as Sherlock slipped off the suit coat. “Should I ask what you’re up to?”
But whether they’d died there in bed together or had been placed there—just one of the many questions Lestrade would need to answer.
“He needs more blankets,” Mrs. Hudson decided, breezing to the door. “I’ll fetch them. Goodness,” she added as a parting shot, “what you put him through, Sherlock, it’s a wonder . . . Well, I guess he wouldn’t stay if he minded,” she amended when she caught sight of Sherlock’s stunned and colorless visage. She hastily disappeared.
Eoin glanced at the morphine drip, and John realized he thought John was subtly asking him to do it. “No, Eoin,” he said gently; Eoin’s feelings were so fragile, John sometimes felt he couldn’t talk louder than a whisper. “I didn’t mean for you to do anything you shouldn’t.”
That day saw Mr. John off to the stables after breakfast, and after clearing the dishes, Mrs. Grossman was on her way to see to his room when there came a knock at the door. Being not at all a young lady, it took Mrs. Grossman some little time to turn herself around on the stairs and come down again.
John concentrated on his breakfast, very aware of Mycroft’s eyes on him. Then his phone chimed. “Excuse me,” he said as he extracted it. “Sarah wants to know how you’re doing,” he told Sherlock.
With a sigh, John rang the older Holmes, fully expecting a tirade but receiving only silence. After waiting a minute for some kind of response, John said, “Well, then, I’ll just be—”
“I don’t . . .” John wasn’t sure where he was going to fit the box. It could go on the passenger seat for now, but once both he and Sherlock were in the car, one of them was probably going to have to sit with it on his lap. “I don’t know,” he said now with more alacrity. It was time to get moving in any case; let other things take care of themselves.
And Sherlock was about to ask time for what, exactly, but John said, “I want to do it while the lawn is still green. And I don’t want to wait another year.”
And like a shot passing through him, all at once the answer seemed obvious. He reached for the doorknob and wrenched it open.
Even as John worked through this mental maze of information, he tasted something strange in his throat, and realized after a moment that it was the coppery flavor of blood.
Sherlock glanced at the pale, immobile figure in the bed. “I’m his fiancé.” He wasn’t sure this was still true, but it would suffice for now.
