“Er- thanks, mate,” said John, turning to face the others as well. “Let’s spend the rest of today on the Proud Riff and on Monday we can practice Ain’t We Proud.”
John’s stomach had a new home again. It now settled into his throat, painfully dry for want of the man before him.
“Which story would you like to hear, my dear?” John's fingers looped in and around the curls so delicately, a lesser effort wouldn't have moved the hair at all. He thought of the beautiful mind beneath these curls. Once storing every memory like a computer and now weakened with age- but always beautiful.
John gulped down a lump of panic that crawled up his throat. What did he know? “Right, but I still reckon I’ll keep pretending you don’t.”
“John, when we need to pretend to be a couple, things like spontaneous physical contact are expected to maintain-”
“Don’t mention it,” Sherlock responded with a soft passion he couldn’t keep out of his voice. The words came out in a murmur.
-” he continued, delighted when John joined in to harmonize flawlessly in the latter half of phrase.
2. Sherlock Holmes' once rigid worldview and values have softened and morphed into something more recognizably suitable for domesticity.
Law school made sense. He could control his fate, control some small aspect of his life when everything else always seemed to be frenzied and refractory. He could hyper-fixate on rules, logic, and due process. In this strictly structured career path, he would have discipline and be able to focus on fighting the many situations he found unjust in this world. It was an attempt to structure his life while still helping others in some small way.
It was hauling through the airless vacuum of space. It was treading from the deepest depth of an unexplored ocean. It was strength he never knew he had- the strength John Watson inspired in him. Sherlock needed to move, his mind clicking into activity, changing gears to embrace reality when he’d fought against it for so long.
The yellow light of the ancient bulbs cast harsh shadows across faces hard with a sentiment John couldn’t place. He saw in Wiggins a clarity that rarely shone through. Tobias was swallowing hard, though remaining silent. John’s words circled around all of them, the appearance of an echoing “Don’t you?” hanging over them all.
“You- Do you want to fix it?” “It would look better.” John’s hand rubbed the back of his neck, his eyes dancing.
But now they had wandered the streets of Cardiff with no apparent purpose for too long and John would soon need treatment for hypothermia.
An hour is an incredibly short time when you’re doing the thing you were born to do. It positively flew by, the time flowing at the exact tempo set by their band.  When they concluded their final song, the individuals who had taken up dancing on the huge marble floor before the stage stopped with panting breath and clapped enthusiastically.
He was also brilliant and perceptive. He was also friendly, if not a bit odd. He was a skilled musician and writer. He was poised and his motions were elegant.
“Watching you then, I met your night-shadowed eyes. The whole of the world froze save for us and one solitary snowflake. It fell rebelliously down from the heavens to assume its place on the tip of your nose.”
(ALSO, a technical note: I have done extensive research in preparation for this fic. A portion of my research focused on terminology for gay people in the 1940s. According to my research,
Sherlock was eight years old when he first heard that there was a difference between a house and a home. He'd never thought anything of it, the seemingly trivial distinction. Yet in his fourth year, his English teacher spoke of how a house is a place where you live and a home is a place where you belong.
That wasn’t to say that the war did not cause a great deal of distress in ways unrelated to his sexuality crisis. There was a multitude of scars that were obtained across his mind and body. It was inescapable. One by one, Philip saw his brothers in arms succumb to disease, die from infected wounds, or otherwise lose their ability to cope with the constant demand of war.
Today was Bath and Body Works' annual candle day. I worked twelve hours there so this is a short, fluffy piece because Johnlock can always cheer me up. Off we pop!
Only when the mask was removed wholly and completely did he turn to John, heart heavy with the knowledge of what John had unknowingly done for him.
John was barely holding onto any understanding of Sherlock’s stream of consciousness, though he understood that Sherlock was speaking more for himself than for John’s own understanding.
He knew three profound truths: He loved Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes loved him, and nothing in the whole universe would ever pull them apart.
I have five passes to get me to shut up, three passes for a non-condescending explanation, two passes where he can fill in the blank, and ONE where he is allowed to ask me ONE question about my sex life. SH
Sherlock is not a good singer. Yet lately, he can't seem to stop singing around the house. John is too distracted by the horrible pitch to hear the lyrics, but he should be paying better attention.
It took him a moment to find any words, unsure of how to express the depth of his confusion. It was not a feeling he was accustomed to. The sound a ill-suppressed laughter from his brother and his boyfriend gave him his voice to simply ask, “Snowmen?”
Mike treat him so warmly? He briefly considered being kinder to the man before mentally shaking himself back to sense and reminding himself that sentiment was no benefit to him.
“Alright,” John muttered and Sherlock placed him down gently back on the floor. He withdrew his hands, relishing how it felt to drag his fingers along the outline of his waist. “Thanks,” he said to the wall.
see him. His eyes would fill with tears, they would embrace, and John would whisper in his ear: “I never gave up on you.”
When cases went well, he could forget his addiction- put a pause on all of it. When cases did not go well, it intensified his desire to fall under, to succumb to his biggest weakness. After all, what was he good for if not solving cases?
“How?” asked John. The word held more emotion than Sherlock had ever heard in the man's voice. In the lonely word was a world of pain and conflict. It broke under his uncertainty and Sherlock felt his hands turn clammy in the absence of John’s warmth. Sherlock sat up, his blanket falling to expose his chest but resting comfortably around his hips as he stared bewildered at John.
It was quite the challenge to refrain from the smile fighting to spread across his face. The man was so adorable at that moment, too short to complete the task he adored and too disgruntled to pull up a chair or step-ladder.
“I would love to go back to school,” he confessed. “Medical school, specifically. Always fancied being a doctor.”
Although he couldn’t see him, John felt him go rigid on top of him. After ages of difficult breathing and fighting to get out from beneath him, he finally heard a soft “Oh” from above him.
Hesitation, a brief moment of stillness from John while his eyes searched Sherlock’s eyes, scanned Sherlock’s face, dragging one moment into a hundred before succumbing. When he spoke at last, his voice was enriched with more tenderness than Sherlock could handle. “Sherlock Holmes, are you a consulting detective?”
With his arm was extended, the letter remained safe- dry and pristine. His tears came unabashedly in this isolated room, his face absolutely drowning in the volume of them. His vision was blurred, his air flow constricted, his voice emitted a pained growl that he had no control over. There was nothing he could do but allow it all. He was helpless to even attempt a facade of control. It took everything- strength, control, effort, focus… It took
Sherlock shook his head, curling bouncing with the motion. “Afraid not. Wasn’t there when it happened.”
Only through the existence of a friendship did it occur to Sherlock how sad he’d become in only eight short years of life. Overflowing with emotion and forced to repress every drop of it, he’d been more deeply injured and he knew.
She walked up to him, arm outstretched holding the paper out for him to take. John gripped it, eyes narrowing to figure exactly what he was looking at. Five young men, standing stylishly together. The third to the right and standing toward the front was- Good God, it was Sherlock. He was standing with a guitar over his shoulder. He was leather-clad, effortlessly cool.“Feast your eyes on who you’ve just made a date with: Sherlock Holmes, guitarist of Midnight Focus.”
There was just one problem: John couldn't focus on the movie. Even sitting as close to the arm rest as possible, John's knee was still resting against a portion of Sherlock's leg. He was hyper-aware of the contact and his mind was racing with thoughts of grabbing his knee, throwing his legs over his hips to straddle him, or resting his head against the robe-covered shoulder. He wanted to touch him, to turn this one minuscule connection into something from his dreams.
That is how he came to be standing there, thirty-two days later to see his knight gone with the papers reading:
Wiggins nodded, that same vacant stare directed at nothing in particular in response to his words. “Killer diller, Cap.”
Though he remained silent and composed, it filled Sherlock with a mad desire to immediately unbutton his shirt and remove it from his waistband.
“Not that there’s anything wrong with you,” Sherlock said in a frenzied rush of words. His eyes were wide with fear of his own miscommunication. “I just don’t do it. The whole… ‘dating’ thing.”
Sherlock sauntered off to refresh their beverages, John’s heart sick with the whiplash of emotions. Perhaps it was cruel to tease himself this way. Perhaps it was cruel to Sherlock to befriend him when there was so much left to confess. Perhaps it was cruel to both of them.
But it was perfect. John himself was a decent singer but nothing astonishing. Perhaps not even good enough to win the contest.
The low murmur of conversation that filled the room around him seemed to grow impossibly loud, the sound of it filling his every corner of consciousness until it was an intolerable din, an audible itch he couldn’t scratch.
Sherlock's unblinking eyes filled with tears slowly, slowly without falling as he looked upon John in that dim room, leaning minutely away, the muscles in his face shifting into a mask of pure disgust, hatred, contempt.
“Exactly!” Sherlock positively leapt at John’s understanding. “This is it, John. This will win us the preliminary- the whole damned thing, even. It will connect with audiences but furthermore, it’s authentic. The band fought in the war, the singer lost a loved one in the war- it’s a song to honour the troops that also honours the families back home. I’m telling you, John. This is it.”
The dimly lit room was suffocating him, the solitary light illuminating Mycroft with a darkness befitting of the demon he was.
John was struck into silence by the scene before him. A mass of black curls bounced gently around the man's pale face as his head turned to the waitress, telling her dismissively that he would have the scampi di gamberi for their starter.
“Hey, this is Greg,” John said over the music when they got to the circle table John had been sitting at with Sherlock. “The bassist, as you saw.”
The world was a plane of fog, a painting of balsams, surrounding him with green thickets. Each bristle was ringing with clarity, millions of points of interest and his mind couldn’t handle the ferocity with which it was trying to register the information.
“Because,” he interrupted again, speaking so every work out of his mouth was clipped, “I work alone.”
The words haunted him like fire. The threat thrived on his life, his every breath supplying it with greater power. The more he lived, the closer he was to the fruition of Moriarty’s plan.
“It’s not very wifely to steal your husband’s business secrets,” said Mycroft as he settled in an armchair. Jane sat in front of him and the rest of them remained standing.
“Wanker,” teased John, but he was still smiling. The hands tightened around his waist until their bellies and chest were flush together. Sherlock’s own hands cradled John’s shoulders, fingertips tracing the smaller and bigger scars that adorned John’s skin. They were nose to nose and though Sherlock knew where this was heading, the kiss was still a bit of a surprise.
“Sherlock,” John called softly, unable to wait any longer. Sherlock jerked and looked at John wild eyed, and that made John feel so protective, he forgot his own uncertainty.
Sherlock was trying to rip John’s clothes off, but John didn’t let him, compensating the restraint with murmurs of praise and affection, telling Sherlock things he wouldn’t probably dare say outside the confines of the bedroom. John undressed Sherlock slowly, kissing and caressing every bit of revealed skin and finally Sherlock relented to the rhythm. John didn’t forget he was asked to show what he felt for Sherlock and he was intent on doing just that.
Sherlock looked at John so ridiculously affronted, that John started to laugh. It didn’t take long for Sherlock to huff a laugh as well.
“Tell me, what else have you figured out?”, asked John and licked the underside of Sherlocks ear. Sherlock could barely speak.
Jane looked as if she wanted to say something, but then she just nodded and allowed them in her room. It was very similar to John’s, but there wasn’t an adjoining door in it.
“Please.” Sherlock’s voice sounded so small, and gently, very gently, John pulled Sherlock’s face down to his. He first caught Sherlock’s lower lip between his, then upper, then firmly kissed the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, while caressing Sherlock’s hair, letting the curls slip through his fingers again and again. Sherlock swayed a little and pulled John closer in to a tight hug, and John deepened the kiss, amused by how characteristically impatient Sherlock became even while kissing. Sherlock kissed like a man possessed, devouring and claiming, so John did his best to calm him by letting his hands wander in wide soothing strokes wherever he could reach.
John drove himself to exhaustion. He wasn’t thinking clearly anymore, and his temper was shorter than ever. At this rate, he might strangle Sherlock before even having a chance to find out if Sherlock would terribly mind being kissed. The cases usually provided a welcome reprieve, allowing him to safely indulge in admiring Sherlock, without giving away the depth of the feeling. Sherlock on a case was safe to be next to, but a caseless detective was a dangerous creature, nosy and scrutinising, too curious about the details John would have liked to keep hidden. John marched towards Baker Street and ruminated about all the ways Sherlock made the situation worse. It seemed that the more time John tried to stay away, the less considerate Sherlock became, always demanding attention, always standing in the middle of John’s path, always probing, deducing and observing, never leaving John a chance to gather his thoughts. It was less like living with a first class detective and more like with a toddler left at daycare for a first time.
The rational part of Sherlock’s mind knew that if he got up from the sofa and made himself do something, anything at all, eventually the heaviness would lift and little by little, he would regain his functionality, but right now, it simply wasn’t worth it. He was useless, pathetic, and weak, and he wrapped himself in the too familiar feelings like in a blanket. The only consulting detective in the world – the reason there weren’t more was that the world didn’t need any, and would get on just fine if Sherlock would cease to exist. In fact, ceasing to exist was such an inviting thought. Sherlock knew enough about various ways to die to know that there weren’t any neat one’s – death was messy, often painful, and required much more effort than he had to spare at the moment. Sherlock would have preferred wishing himself out of existence, the way he wished to wake up as a pirate when he was a child, but even his strong will was not enough for that.
Sherlock sighted again, and John expected the conversation to end, but after a moment, Sherlock answered.
“I like this place so much, and Kristen became such a good friend,” said Jane and smiled at the other woman.
“That’s exactly what I said to Francis the other day! I said – if you’re allowed to have sleepovers, I’m allowed my SPA weekends,” agreed Jane.
John held Sherlock by the waist, and they swam in an exhilarating speed, deeper and further from the tree, and the glimpses of strange creatures and their habitats excited Sherlock so much he forgot all about boredom. When they finally stopped near the huge seaweed covered rock wall, Sherlock felt as breathless as he usually was after a good run. This rock had to be the bottom of the tiny island Sherlock had noticed far in the middle of the lake. He never expected to be able to visit it, at least not from this angle. The crystal-clear water and the white sand covered bottom reminded Sherlock of sun lit forest clearings, where naughty nymphs lured the willing satyrs for some carnal pleasures. They can keep their clearings – Sherlock ended up in a much more exciting place.
“I didn’t meant to. Kristen approached me here, a year ago and convinced me my husband was doing something illegal,” Jane managed a sad grin. “I became worried and gave Kristen financial data from my husband’s home computer. Mostly it was old or public, but there were some confidential documents.”
“Sherlock, as pleasant as this is, I’m not a teenager anymore. I doubt I’ll be up for another round tonight.”
“You’re amazing,” whispered John, while Sherlock tattered on the edge, unable to tip over, “I don’t ever want to stop. But like I said, I need to you to return to the lake because of me.”
“Oh.” Dark thoughts flew through John’s mind, and who could have done something like that to Sherlock. John had to keep his hands fisted to prevent from reaching out to
“Do I? No. Wait. Oh!” Serlock’s mind started racing. John was aware what sort of “case” Sherlock was solving, and he was ecstatic about it, but what did that mean, exactly?
“Maybe,” said Sherlock and glanced at John with a soft smile on his lips. John’s heart soared – was Sherlock hinting that John was the one?
“Yes, a couple of blocks away from that Vietnamese restaurant we went to last week,” said Sherlock out of the blue.
In the evening, when John came back home from the clinic and grinned from ear to ear the moment he stepped in to the flat, Sherlock had enough.
The fact that the feeling was temporary was of no comfort – he felt awful right now, and only right now existed. The future was not a certainty, the past offered only regrets and shame, and right now was unbearable, so he lay on the sofa, his back to the world, wishing for everything to just stop. At least he was alone – at his childhood home, Mommy used to fuss about him and Mycroft tried to force him out of his misery by the share force of his disapproval. None of these tactics reduced the misery, or the time it took for it to pass. His father was the only sensible one, letting him be and not making Sherlock feel guilty about it. It was better now, when he had a home of his own and no one to inconvenience just because he wasn’t functioning like a proper member of society should.
Before Sherlock could even take a breath to give a dignified response to such an outrageous statement, the creature leaned back and dived in the water infuriatingly gracefully, his whole body arching backwards before going under. The restless tentacles were the last to disappear.
At dinner, they were seated with the charming elderly couple, who were content with very little conversation. It was fine by John, who felt drained, though there wasn’t much in activities that day. They didn’t have much time left – John had to be back at work a day after tomorrow and Sherlock hated being away from London for that long, but Sherlock wasn’t showing any of the distress signs he did an evening before. Maybe he had a theory and just waited to test it. John would have appreciated being more informed, but this time he figured it was his own fault as he fell asleep while Sherlock was explaining his thoughts.
He didn’t wait for John to respond. The detective fled for the front door before John understood what was happening.
The thing was, he didn’t feel hungry at all. In fact, his stomach balked at the very idea of food, and he faily buzzed with energy in the cool air. He’d forgotten to grab a jacket in his haste to leave the flat but was thankful for that fact, as every time his thoughts (against his will) returned to Sherlock’s eyes and the way his body had tilted (had it really? Had John imagined it?) he felt flushed.
He slowly brushed his hand over Sherlock’s crotch and reveled in the resulting moan. As much as he enjoyed teasing the man, he was also incredibly aroused. But he wanted to do this right.
He texted Lestrade, asking for details. Then he took a breath and tried to assume a non-threatening, relaxed pose in his chair.
“Five,” John said, crossing his arms. He was caught between annoyance at the mouse situation and confusion (along with a bit of concern) about Sherlock’s choice to buy food unprompted.
Sherlock made no move to push him off, which was just fine with John because he wasn’t sure he would have been able to do much more than just slump to the floor. He waited for his heartrate to get back under control and dutifully blocked out all of the alarm bells clanging in his mind. He wasn’t quite ready to think yet.
Several days later, John was setting some laundry in Sherlock’s room and he found his photograph had been stolen from him for the second time. Except now it had acquired a simple black frame and sat atop the other man’s dresser. John smiled and made a mental note to kiss Sherlock silly when he returned from wherever the hell he was.
under John’s gaping stare and looking for all the word like a teenager who’d just been walked in on by his mum.
Sherlock disappeared through the doorway and John couldn’t help but shake his head as he shrugged on his jacket. The man would never stop surprising him.
The concept was, to put it mildly, mind-blowing. He had no idea Sherlock even had a sex drive let alone –
John scowled, crossing his arms and planting himself stubbornly. He was a bloody doctor after all, and he took care of him in nearly every other aspect.
John, feeling a little dazed, fell backward onto his chair. He couldn’t help but huff quietly in incredulous laughter.
John barked a laugh, causing Sherlock’s eyes to snap up. “Nothing to worry about? Christ, Sherlock, you’re
“Yes. It’s for you. I assumed you would have been too busy in your reconnaissance to make anything.”
“Well, ah, that’s all better then,” he stammered, getting quickly to his feet. The room swam a bit – god, maybe he
“Cheeky bastard,” John muttered and snatched the mouse up by the tail. To his surprise it hardly reacted, simply dangled from John’s gloved grip – and still refused to let go of the bit of biscuit clenched between its tiny pink hands.
“Don’t. Even.” Sherlock warned, in an attempt to sound commanding. The edge of desperation in his words undermined the effect.
epilepsy–“ Sherlock had been talking to John from the other room for a while now, but his voice faltered as he returned to find John staring down at the photograph.
Another odd wave of affection swept through John. A tiny bit of guilt, too. But it’s not as if anyone besides the two of them knew what John’s little breakdown had been about. The fact that The Incident (and even, weirdly, the very idea of Sherlock masturbating) stirred in him such an unusual mix of empathy and warmth was something he was not quite ready to analyze.
– and then out of nowhere things had gotten – intense, and then John had felt light-headed and had some kind of mini panic attack?
secret kept them apart. He couldn’t help but feel this way, and he wondered if Sherlock felt the same.
He studied her for several minutes. “She was stabbed four, maybe five times before she died.” John rattled off a few more observations before he chanced a look up in Sherlock’s direction.
It was one of the old Polaroids, a little worn at the edges. One corner had a stained blotch from where someone had spilled tea on it.
When Sherlock realized that John did not appear to be moving any time soon, he rolled his eyes again but did shift the computer off his lap onto the table. He stood and gingerly untucked his shirt (ripped on the side with a small dark stain, John now noticed) from his trousers, pulling it up to reveal a jagged cut about an inch and a half wide just below Sherlock’s left ribcage. It had stopped bleeding but there was some residue of dried blood and John had the impression Sherlock had hastily wiped it down with something before forgetting about it altogether.
It was John’s favorite. He ate ravenously, realizing only once the first noodles passed his lips that he hadn’t eaten since the toast much earlier. The detective rattled off some facts about a case Lestrade had brought to him involving a missing businessman, possibly connected to an opiate drug ring. John’s aggravation slipped away as he slurped his noodles and the circumstances of the case drew him in
John rolled his eyes. For being a genius, the man was such an idiot. John quickly moved to snatch up the pack before Sherlock returned to the room to stop him. He hadn’t seen the man smoke in months, and he wasn’t going to let him ruin his progress just because he was bored out of his mind and John wasn’t there to nag him.
Sherlock spent his days by the lake. There was an oak tree that long ago grew too close to the water and nearly fell down, but still managed to cling to the soil, looming horizontally over the deep end. Sherlock laid on its trunk, facing the lake, one hand lazily tracing meaningless patterns on its surface. The forest provided a shade no matter where Helios was on his travels through the cloudless sky, so Sherlock remained alabaster white even without bothering with clothes. Thick scent of everblooming flowers floated in the air. An occasional snippet of a flute melody filtered in through the trees. There wasn’t even a breeze. Sometimes Sherlock would stop moving his hand to let the water calm down and take a good look at himself, then sigh deeply and disturb the surface again.
“I’m ashamed of what I’ve done, but in my defence, I did my best to not give away too much. Just enough to give her an impression I was working for her, until I found the solution.”
The ride in the taxi gave John a little more courage. Sherlock’s hand was resting between them and John felt bold enough to lightly cover Sherlock’s gloved fingers with his own, testing the waters, to determine whether it was the unusual place that allowed Sherlock to act more human and warmer towards John, or was it a true shift in their relationship.
“John, my dearest John,” Sherlock whispered above him and John whimpered. Sherlock’s hand was resting on John’s nape, and slowly it started creeping higher, fingers slipping in the short hair. Sherlock was careful, as if not sure if this was allowed and John would have laughed, if he had any sense in him at the moment – as if he could ever deny Sherlock
“I am not asexual by the most accepted definition of the term. I just don’t have a pleasant experience with it.”
“Are you saying, that if I was so inclined, you would be willing to consider a relationship,” Sherlock looked away for a moment. “With me.”
“I should probably,” said Sherlock and gestured vaguely. John didn’t say anything and it took Sherlock a few more minutes to get up at shuffle back to his room. “Get ready for breakfast, maybe someone new will show up,” said Sherlock before closing the door.
“I’m not afraid,” Sherlock tried to scoff and failed miserably. John couldn’t bear to look at the raw emotions on Sherlock’s face, so he grabbed Sherlock’s shirt, pulled him closer and rested his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock not only didn’t push him away, he hugged him loosely, caressing his back.
Sherlock flipped them over. At first he only looked, like John was one of the crime scenes he had to asses, but then began his slow and methodical exploration of John’s body. John tried to be more involved, but Sherlock gently, but firmly put John’s hands down. It was strange at the beginning, not doing anything back, but then John understood what was happening – Sherlock was not trying to please John, he was taking pleasure for himself, and John was just the one who happened to be around. The only thing John could contribute was his reactions to what Sherlock was doing, as Sherlock eagerly collected them all – John’s moans and grunts as well as squirms and giggles. Sherlock quickly found the erogenous zones John himself knew about, like the spot under his ear, and then discovered some new ones, like the inside of his elbow. Sherlock was very thorough but tortuously slow, and he deliberately avoided the place John wanted to be touched the most. John doubted he ever was so turned on without any chance of release.
“No, I provided a sympathetic woman with information so she could help my family. I didn’t expect it to go so out of hand.”
“Your husband’s forgiveness is not my domain. Your sentence though, largely is, so I suggest you tell us everything,” said Mycroft.
The next day Sherlock wandered in the forest, but whatever direction he turned to, he would always end up at the path that led to the oak by the lake. Growing more and more frustrated, he increased his pace, stomping the ground with determination, but the paths refused to take him anywhere else. The day went on, but Sherlock was not about to admit his defeat, staying away from the lake with increasing difficulty. The lake belonged to the water creatures, but the tree was Sherlock’s, and it was unfair that he couldn’t go back to it just because somebody had the audacity to throw an offhand remark. Who was the creature to declare it was it that Sherlock came back to? He went to the lake just because he felt like it, it wouldn’t be different if he kept doing that. Sherlock didn’t have to explain himself to anyone, nobody had any right to claim to know his motives. Still, going back to the tree felt like defeat, so Sherlock turned towards the shallow end of the lake, to the clearing were the nymphs often went for a drink or a quick splash. He sat down on the sand, letting the water lap gently at his stretched out legs. Surely, it was too shallow there for any lake inhabitant to creep up on him here.
Next morning, Sherlock went straight to the tree. He went back because of John, and Sherlock wanted John to know that. As Sherlock sat on the tree trunk, feet lowered to the water, he savoured the anticipation. Sherlock knew that John would take his time, this was how this game worked, but that didn’t stop Sherlock from coming here with the first rays of the morning sun.
John let out a wholehearted laugh, surprising Sherlock and himself. Whenever John longed to touch Sherlock, he had to be content with a friendly pat on the shoulder or an elbow nudge, and he just got a permission to let it all go. Sherlock asked, no, Sherlock demanded to be touched and John was eager to oblige him. Going straight to bed just after he got up and dressed seemed ridiculous to John, but at least this time the bed wasn’t his own.
Sherlock was already there, lying on a sunbed, still glistening with the massage oil, nearly ethereal in a white fluffy robe. John took a few moments to absorb the sight of him like that, grateful for the physical exhaustion of the exercises and swimming.
John sat thinking for a moment. Still holding himself next to Sherlock. As close as he dared. The sun had set a half hour ago and the room was quickly darkening. Sherlock jumped up and found a small lamp in the corner to turn on. Nothing bright. Nothing that could be easily seen from outside. Placed against the farthest, darkest corner of the room.

“I had you monitored closely, for obvious reasons … after the fall. At about thirteen months in, they dropped all of their surveillance efforts …  Your grief was … convincing.” Sherlock winced at the words as they came out, as if visibly pained by the admission. And yet the fact remained …
Dr. John H. Watson found himself smiling. Must be another Doctor Watson here that regularly attends. But he wasn't complaining. This did look lovely. And more than edible!

The boy picked it up and read it word-for-word exactly as John had seen it …   His mind stuttered a bit as it logged that this was reality. “Thank you,” then a lightbulb came on!
John smiled, “‘Course. Anything. Anything I can do, to help restore Sherlock Holmes to the world where he belongs. I am yours ... to use as you will, Sherlock.”

The doors were thrown wide open, and the florists were shuffling in and out with huge arrangements between them. Festooning the room. A ridiculous amount of hydrangeas, lilacs, leaves, and for some reason … green carnations? Filtering in.
He was almost disappointed he couldn’t guess her tastes wordlessly … Sherlock would have. She set her cup down politely a moment later. Making a face. Having drank it all still. “Thanks,” she lied politely.
He coughed, a fit of coughs … stumbling up and out to the living room to get a glass of water. And resolute
John breathed a long sigh of release. Not even realizing he’d been holding his breath. Bottling up his anger. He shook it out. Watching the room empty. Spilling into the next one.
Sherlock was glad she hadn’t suffered long. She had been hurting for a while, and hiding it like the fighter she was. He was glad she had gone peacefully, in her sleep.
He stopped himself. Still unable to say it. Still unwanted. This knowledge that what he would have to say eventually, was in and of itself ...   unbearable.
“So sorry, no Signore. No Holmes. Have seen him here before. But not this weekend.” He bustled off to attend to other things.
John sucked in a breath, apologizing, “so, so sorry! Are you alright?” Looking the man over, and making sure he hadn’t just stained that impeccably
The weight flipped and fell back into his hands. He set it down on the table again. He was trying to avoid John's eyes. Still, he glanced just to make sure it registered.
Not the superman you always think you have to present to the world. To impress. No. Something far better. The human.
Going to hand back the phone with a cheeky reply when Molly came into the room - interrupting - offering him a cup of coffee. And John took the mobile back almost too quickly.
Sherlock cornered him as soon as they entered the hallway and had started, just started … to remove their coats.
Perhaps he had done it to avoid any hurt he thought he might cause otherwise? One doesn't, after all, want to kick a stray after one has nursed him back to health ...
Molly had touched his shoulder to get his attention. "No, John," Molly had shaken her head, "he's just … gone!" And she pointed him to the room to see for himself that the body was not there?! And then ... all around them, EMT's, doctors, nurses, were suddenly ... disappearing?
He had never wanted to be inside of someone's ribcage before. Sharing their beating heart. Listening to their beautiful brain. Feeling their every breath as it passed through their lips and into their lungs …
Archives of articles? Of crimes solved? The internet would be full of it. Maybe he could even find a picture?
He only decided to break the silence, to beg the question resting on his lips ... because he needed to know
John thanked the merchant and pocketed the cord. Stepping towards the cold night air that rushed in. Realizing it had very quickly become nightfall.
Only that the ‘why’ had to have a purpose. And the purpose had to have a heart behind it. It wasn’t Nat’s own idea. But she wasn’t against it. And it was almost like … she was being kept busy as well ...
Everywhere. Blowing away. Like bubbles. An empty, useless thing one couldn’t grasp. Or hold on to it. Or kiss it’s broken cheek.
… of course … the embezzlement case. The article that had drawn his attention to this very restaurant in the first place.
more interesting,” the man slid his finger along John’s jawline, feeling the stubble that had begun to form there, and sending a shiver down John’s spine. No doubt logging the reaction he was getting, and enjoying it. John felt boneless. And about to lose control … when he suddenly released John from his stare down, stepping back and flourishing his hand in invitation down the road, “why don’t you join me for a drink? Or … “ looking up at the sky and realizing the time, asking, “dinner?”
“Sherlock, this is a big deal. I get it. Life threatening even. You can trust me. I’ll get him to come up here! Hook or crook!” Mike picked up his briefcase and jacket and double checked the time on his phone. Stashing it in his pocket with the silent setting on. Just as Sherlock had instructed.
"You boys need a stern talking to, that's what!" She managed at last, placing a plate in front of his nose harshly. She was able to pull Sherlock out of his reverie for a moment to focus on some soup that came next.
had chased … John smirked at that. His mind automatically zipping to the text that lay unanswered - a Pandora's Box - in his pocket.
Tag me as well! Would be honored to read and share with you! @helloliriels on Tumblr, Twitter, and Insta.
Sherlock made a small noise beside him, and John turned his head to look but kept his eyes down. Tucking his hand back between his legs, as if realizing just now, that he had been rubbing his leg
A couple nearby had made an "awww"-ing sound and caught each other up in kisses as they ran to each other.
Do you know why I got angry? hmm?" John asked now, absolutely serious, "back at the restaurant? Do you know what you said?"
He rubbed at his bad shoulder. Feeling the cold seeping in now that it was getting windy, “S’nothing! Just this damn … shoulder. Prize from invading Afghanistan.” He tried for humor, to knock it aside as if nothing, but felt it still linger between them … the connection. Lost.
"Doctor Watson?" an almost American voice sounded behind him. And John turned around out of his reverie.
These scenic tour boats were everywhere, John found. A steep fare for a scenic, romantic ride, usually a slow loop through the canals and back to their point of entry. They all had their spots …
He had already said it out loud several times today. And he hoped he wasn't making the biggest mistake of his life now by assuming one more was possible ... ?
John’s eyes flinted to Philip, their number one flight risk. “Whatever gigs we can get, we’ll take. If there’s a place in town where we can play a set, we’re going to do it. No exceptions. We book every opportunity starting now. We have 97 days until the final round. We take them all, place all the funds in a savings and earn our way to London. We book a train, we book a hotel, and we perform. All with the savings we’ll get from 97 days of hard work.”
“But as I said, he’s not just the government, he has his stubby, grimy fingers in the church as well. He’s ordained and if that doesn't say anything about the state of organized religion, I don't know what does. Anyway, so my brother- a government official, to put it lightly- married us. He officiated a secret ceremony with Mrs. Hudson and Victor’s sister as witnesses. He oversaw the legal proceedings of it and kept the official certificate hidden and safe. In the copies he sent to record keeping, he changed one of our names to avoid suspicion. However, officially, we were married because the original marriage license remained unaltered. We followed all the rules. Well, all the rules except for the big one- no woman involved. My brother was willing to break that one rule as a favour to me. And like I said,” he added with a flourish, “my brother is ordained. So it is official in both senses.”
Sherlock literally leapt with joy at the suggestion, whirling on the spot to pluck the box from where it sat. John watched with love in his heart. He was light with it, his blood singing with pure adoration. This, right here, was enough. The two of them, bickering with familiarity at times and coming together with complete joy and affection at other times. It was an intimacy John couldn’t describe.
Sherlock’s eyes glinted in the dim light of the flat. Wide and loaded with emotion, they stared directly into John’s and this- this intense eye contact- was more intimate than any physical touch they’d ever shared. John’s eyes, exposing a terrifying vulnerability and marked with tears, met Sherlock’s understanding eyes to convey dizzying passion. He couldn’t bear to blink, lest he miss even one minuscule moment of this connection with him.
At home, Sherlock was not on sulking the sofa, which could have been a good sign, if it wasn’t for Mycroft, who was sitting opposite Sherlock in John’s armchair. They were clearly in some disagreement. A thick manila envelope was lying on a table between them, so it must be some case Mycroft was trying to persuade Sherlock to take. John usually took Sherlock’s side in these arguments, but Sherlock needed a case and John wanted a distraction, so he went in with a more open mind than usual.
“None of my employees are involved. It’s about the trade secrets of one of the biggest car factories in the country, all of this is in the file, if you cared to read it.”
“Your scars,” answered Sherlock, watching the tentacles twisting and turning leisurely, inching closer and closer towards Sherlock’s feet. “And your muscles,” added Sherlock as an afterthought.
Sherlock was special after all. He was the only one in the world, or at least the part of it he could easily reach by walking, which basically meant the same thing. The forest was full of life, brimming with animals, nymphs, satyrs and centaurs, but Sherlock had yet to meet anyone who could resemble himself even the slightest. The other creatures were simpletons, needy and eager, always playing games that were so boring Sherlock didn’t ever bother to acknowledge them. Sherlock was reduced to spending his time alone, looking at his image on the water and wondering if there was a purpose of him being the way he was, with a mind that could solve the trickiest riddles and a heart that yearned for something even Sherlock couldn’t name.
The breakfast was self-served and people were mingling about, chatting and being friendly. The policy worked – most people were in groups, and tables for six were mostly full. John met the women from yesterday and they invited him to join at their table, which John gladly accepted, despite the eye roll from Sherlock.
“My son is very well too!” the woman brightened up even more. “He’s such a smart boy! He recently learned how to tie the shoelaces and now he does it quicker than me using both of my hands!”
Slowly, John’s hands moved from the front, to hugging Sherlock around the back, pulling him closer. Lifting his head to face Sherlock seemed like an impossible task until he felt Sherlock’s lips on the crown of his head. John lifted is chin up, and Sherlock bend his down, their cheeks brushing, keeping as much skin to skin contact as possible. Slowly, carefully, their lips found each other, pressing firmly, both of them not daring to move at first. Even this tame kiss made John’s head spin. John’s lips parted, and Sherlock hungrily chased the movement, making the kiss more heated. This wasn't the sort of kiss that necessarily led somewhere – this was the needed-like-breathing one, messy and desperate. John only noticed himself being aroused when Sherlock slit his leg between his and gasped at the contact with John’s erection.
“You would have liked the professor with arthritis,” told John. “A very perceptive fellow, he would probably enjoy reading you monograph about ash. I should tell him about it next time he comes for a visit. I’ll turn on the T.V. now, say if the sounds are irritating.”
Sherlock went to his room to change. One of the reasons he was so meticulous about his wardrobe was moments like these – he grabbed a random outfit without thinking too much, confident that he will look decent enough. This was urgent.
“God, I’m an idiot,” Sherlock breathed out and the next moment, John found himself being kissed within the inch of his life.
“The girls were found in this basement,” said Sherlock, standing in front of one of the ordinary looking houses in the street. All the windows were dark.
John was quiet in the beginning, but after a while, he started reading aloud the parts he probably thought Sherlock would find interesting or entertaining. He was wrong of course, but his voice was much more pleasant than the one in Sherlock’s own head, and as no response was required, Sherlock listened without really caring what was being said. From time to time, John placed his hand on Sherlock’s bare ankle, just below the hem of his pyjamas, and gently rubbed it before lifting his hand to turn the page. The touch was friendly and unoppressive, and it anchored Sherlock the way nothing before managed to. After a while, John put down his book and started telling Sherlock about his day at the clinic, the hand on Sherlock’s ankle remaining a constant presence.
“You have my overly sentimental brother to thank for this, Mrs Warstein, but I have a proposition for you. We the British government are reluctant to let the talent of the people go to waste if it can serve our great nation. If you would be so kind to join the team of IT specialists that defend Great Britain from cyber threats, maybe we will be able to arrange a less harsh punishment for you crime as well as some discretion,” Mycroft said this in a tone that made it clear Jane had very little choice in this, but she looked relieved and was nodding eagerly even before Mycroft finished.
“None of the staff could have done it,” said Sherlock out of the blue. “Mycroft’s intelligence must have been wrong.”
In a brief moment of panic Sherlock took a shocked gasp, expecting the water to flood his lungs and then finding that he was breathing as easily as if he was on land. They were still sinking deeper and Sherlock tried to both look around the unfamiliar territory and figure out how was it all possible.
John woke up with a start from a knock on the door and sat up straighter at his desk. A nurse peeked in.
John placed a hand on Sherlock’s hip and pulled him in. There should have been nothing to worry about – Sherlock could see the answer in John’s eyes, and yet, Sherlock never felt such an eager anticipation to hear the words out loud.
This simply wouldn’t do. Nobody commanded Sherlock, he was his own man, free to wander wherever he wished. Sherlock would never bow to somebody's bidding, not even the creature’s as exciting as the one from the depth of the lake. Sherlock huffed an annoyed breath to solidify his resolve, and strolled back to the forest, without any intention to come back to the lake any time soon.
John closed the door behind Mycroft and stopped to think for a minute. It was risky, going somewhere with Sherlock only, but on the other hand, if Sherlock would be busy enough with the case, John might have a chance of getting his thoughts in order. Changing the scene would do good for both of them, and who knows, maybe it’s just the opportunity John needed to find out what Sherlock thought beyond simply being married to his work.
Instead, Sherlock was standing facing John, eyes wide, gripping the corner of the table and overall looking like he just saw a ghost. Or, since Sherlock was not the one to be afraid of ghosts, Anderson in charge of all murder investigations. The gown billowing behind Sherlock added even more drama to his looks.
John floated in the high so strong, he barely felt Sherlock still moving, but he was unable to properly respond. Finally, Sherlock went rigid, and the look on his face was worth all those years of waiting. Sherlock relaxed and John closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them again, Sherlock was deeply asleep, slumped on John’s shoulder, out like a light. John caressed Sherlock’s naked shoulder, relaxing himself and settling for sleep, but it wasn’t as quick to come. There were too many emotions bubbling in his chest.
“Do you ever wish you had a relationship like that?” John nodded to the direction the couple went to.
After breakfast, John and Sherlock went to the Turkish baths. John watched Sherlock relax in the steamy room. Just transport, my ass, though John. Sherlock was clearly enjoying himself and John added the baths as something he might suggest during one of Sherlock’s moods, if there were decent and less expensive ones back in London.
“A child,” replied John, rubbing his face. Sherlock didn’t know the details, but he understood enough. John’s practice meant he rarely had to deal with deaths of his patients, but injuries and terminal illnesses still existed, and even John Watson couldn’t save everyone. Something had to be done, before John plunged into self-blame and hopelessness that would last for days.
“He will never forgive me, will he?” said Jane, looking genuinely distressed. John expected to catch a hard criminal, a seasoned spy able to blend in and snatch important documents from carelessly left laptops, not a housewife who was barely keeping from sobbing.
“I love you,” said Sherlock, looking John in the eyes. “I was certain my pathetic pinning was obvious.”
“I’m fine John,” said Sherlock. “There’s no need to subject some poor quack to the horrors of my subconscious.” John rolled his eyes, but let it go for a while.
“Yes, please,” answered Sherlock and sat up. His head was still too heavy, so he rested it on the back on the sofa, until John came back with two mugs. They sipped the tea, watched the show, and Sherlock offered a deduction here and there, though not as many as he usually did. It only was worth the effort because John reacted with surprise and amusement.
The train home was constantly full, people moving about. Sherlock entertained John with deductions, and complained about the awful sandwiches, but there were also shy glances and bit more restlessness than usual. The need to do something was becoming more intense the closer they were to home, but John didn‘t dare anything with so many people around, not even asking a proper question.
“Don’t you dare say anything about taking it slow!” Sherlock looked dead serious, ready to fight whatever statement John came up with.
“Yes. That. Do tell me.” It was definitely too warm, he will have to have a word with Mrs Hudson. And maybe John was right to nag him about labelling things in the fridge.
It took an especially hard episode, when even John’s efforts didn’t make much difference, for Sherlock to agree to go. John helped him find a specialist that looked least like an idiot and accompanied him to the first appointment. Sherlock tried to be patient, he really did, but after a fifth question about his feelings towards his mother, Sherlock stormed out of the room. He felt a perfectly normal and common mixture of devotion and annoyance towards his mother and had absolutely no time for this nonsense.
The tentacle reached the crease at the top of his thigh and Sherlock willingly spread his legs further apart. He felt John lifting himself up from the water, moving so close Sherlock could feel John’s breath. It was very satisfying to find it uneven, though the tentacles still avoided Sherlock’s nearly fully erect cock. John deliberately puffed a breath up Sherlock’s throat, then just under his ear. It took a lot of Sherlock’s willpower not to grab John’s face and smash their lips together, but everything John was doing was too good to make him stop.
When they finally arrived, John was immensely glad he convinced Sherlock to go. The place was gorgeous, tastefully luxurious and definitely not something John could ever afford on his own. He left Sherlock to deal with the receptionist and sort out their rooms, and wandered about in the lobby, taking it all in – the huge paintings of bright landscapes, subtle living flower arrangements and carefully placed nick knacks decorating the place. The colours were all soft pastels or various tones of white, with some gold here and there to justify the price of the rooms. John could already feel the tension of the week starting to drain.
“On the contrary. I am here to make you come back,” said the creature and lifted itself halfway from the water, few of its tentacles creeping up on the branches. Sherlock purposely didn’t flinch. “But the next time, when you return, I want you to return for me.”
Afterwards, John lain in bed hungry, sweaty and with his arm going numb, because Sherlock was dozing off on it, and yet, he didn't even think about getting up. Yes, he definitely was very happy. Even if there was an occasional head in the fridge.
“You know. Feelings. Relationships.” John’s mind supplied an image of Mycroft’s snarky face. “Sentiment.”
That night, John woke up from a loud noise. Sherlock was standing in his room, the adjoining door wide open.
Sherlock was so agitated he didn’t know where to begin. He wanted to know everything there was to know about John - from his mind to the taste of his skin, but there was no way to ask probing questions while licking someone, so Sherlock just observed John, undeciding how to proceed, while no new detail he noticed helped him to figure it out. John seemed fine with that at first, but after a while, he gently pushed Sherlock into a wall.
When John came back from the bathroom, Sherlock was lying on a bed in his typical thinking pose. John would have preferred Sherlock to choose his own bed, but since Sherlock left a wide enough side for him, he wasn’t about to complain – John was tired and it didn’t seem worth the effort.
At first, Sherlock ignored the show, but his curiosity got the better of him and he turned around. Too tired for deducing, he simply stared at the T.V., catching a detail here and there.
Sherlock felt the tentacle inside him thicken and the one around his cock loose it’s rhythm, and John let go of his arms and braised himself on the rock, bracketing Sherlock’s face with his arms. Sherlock might have been extraordinary, but he wasn’t omnipotent, especially against the sight of John loosing control. John trembled and stiffened up, driving the tentacle inside Sherlock even deeper and Sherlock stopped tampering the build-up of tension and simply let go, every nerve ending in his body exploding with ecstasy. Sherlock floated in a bliss for what seemed like an eternity, gradually regaining his senses and control of his limbs. Apparently, John felt the same, since they managed to drift away from their spot with the currents of the lake.
Sherlock stretched out his legs once again. The creature in front of him was powerful, and obviously dangerous, but there was nothing menacing about it at the moment. It didn’t look as if it was about to make Sherlock do something he didn’t want. Might as well enjoy the encounter then. At least the creature was interesting.
“Not necessary, thank you,” answered Sherlock. He doubted he would be able to sleep, not after a whole day of dosing on the sofa, but pills made him groggy in the morning. He was tired though, and none of the experiments seemed important enough to start immediately. The bed then, there was nothing else left to do.
John stood straighter. “Yes. Right. Are you aware that you sometimes talk out loud when you do that Mind Palace thing of yours?”
“I hope you will let me,” continued John, in the same breathless whisper that tickled Sherlock’s ear and made him yearn for more. “I need your permission, Sherlock.”
John turned on the programme they watched a few days before, the one Sherlock enjoyed deducing the contestants in. The host tended to ask the contestants personal questions, so Sherlock could check if his deductions were right. He got about eight out of ten, not bad for something observed only through the screen. John called Sherlock amazing a lot that evening, it was a warm memory.
At the dinner table, they were seated with a couple of women. The policy of the place was to make guests mingle with each other, make new acquaintances and form connections as part of getting better spiritually ritual. John enjoyed the company – the women, though both had husbands at home, were chatty and attractive, but Sherlock was positively sulking, not contributing to the conversation at all. At least he was eating – the day’s activities must have made even him hungry and the food was excellent despite the expected nod towards being healthy. He and Sherlock ate way too much noodles and curries, it would do them good to have something green and steamed once in a while.
“I couldn’t just leave him there,” shrugged John and they went on, approaching the place Sherlock intended taking them to.
They never talked about it. Sherlock probably knew anyway. When John came to terms with falling in love, he briefly entertained the idea to hide it from his flatmate, but it wasn’t worth the effort. Sherlock was a great detective, after all. So John didn’t restrain his affection much, and Sherlock graciously allowed it, accepting both John’s praise and nagging as something much anticipated, yet a great surprise each time. All things considered, John was happy.
When he came back, Sherlock was sprawled in one of the armchairs in John’s room, deep in thought, fingers under his chin and eyes closed. He didn’t move when John came in. Sherlock’s head was leaned back over the armchair, and John reached out to shuffle his hair to draw his attention, but when John’s fingers touched the soft silky curls, the intended movement turned into a caress, and John just kept on stroking Sherlock’s hair. Half of John’s mind was screaming at him to stop and apologise and the other was greedily trying to memorise all the wonderful sensations. Sherlock leaned more in to the touch. In for a penny, thought John and gently scratched Sherlock’s scalp. Sherlock’s fingers relaxed, but he didn’t move, so John repeated that a few more times. Sherlock opened his eyes and looked straight at John. The gaze was full of acceptance and trust, and at that moment, John became sure that they will get there in the end.
Sherlock was digging his heels until the very last minute, but John pretended he was about to go without him, and surprisingly, it did the trick. Despite Sherlock‘s sulking, John felt quite optimistic in the train. He took a few days off and welcomed the familiar excitement of the case, though this one promised to be more Sherlock insulting the staff of the SPA than chasing someone all over shady alleys. Halfway through the journey John opened the file to occupy himself, and Sherlock snatched it from his hands. The great detective was not so indifferent to the case after all.
“For god’s sake, enough with the obvious!” shouted Sherlock. “There must be a cause for your mood, but you haven’t been on a date in a while, you still hate your job and haven’t won a lottery, so pray tell me, why?”
Despite reassuring himself, Sherlock still felt on the edge. He listened to every rustle of the reeds nearby, followed every ripple on the water surface and startled when a fish jumped out of the water. There was no shade there, and the bright sun shone right to his face, making him blink and rub his eyes. It was nothing compared to the tranquillity and comfort of lying on the tree. Sherlock was about to stand up and go away, but he bent down to wash his face before that. Just as he lowered his hands from his eyes, he saw a familiar face at his feet. The creature was lying on its stomach in the shallow water, head propped with its hands, tentacles lazily trailing behind it, as if it was there for hours, content to observe Sherlock’s miserable attempts to cool himself.
By all accounts, John should have hated Sherlock. Maybe not really hated, but at least be annoyed by Sherlock’s rudeness, self-absorbance and an ability to make their flat inhabitable with his vile experiments. Just yesterday, John came back from a very difficult workday to find Sherlock slumped on the sofa and all their mugs and bowls, which were clearly intended for food and food only, filled with sewage water. With bits floating. It made John gag just thinking about it. Sherlock only threw “experiment” as an excuse, as if that was supposed to justify soiling their dishes. John was still mad, but at the same time, it was just Sherlock being Sherlock. John wouldn’t want him to be anything else. John liked Sherlock just like that, and there was the heart of the problem – John liked Sherlock a little too much. In fact, John liked Sherlock so much, that the things he wanted to do to Sherlock were dirtier than that sewage water, so honestly, John had no moral high ground to stand on, and so he tried to hide in the clinic, pretending that he was needed there more than he really was.
Sherlock and caressing him in an offer of comfort. Sherlock might be dismissive of bodily pleasures, but that didn’t mean there was a reason for him to suffer, especially in what was supposed to be an expression of desire and attraction. Sherlock glanced at John and once again denied the assumptions.
Finally Sherlock gasped for air and John leaned back a little to look at him. Sherlock was dishevelled and wild, as if he was chasing criminals through the greater part of London.
There was something unfamiliar building up behind the excitement and curiosity that Sherlock felt. It took a while for Sherlock to name the feeling, because it was so new, but he finally realised what it was.
Sherlock only agreed to visit the next one because John insisted. To Sherlock’s surprise, the therapist made no promises of curing him, nor did she force him to talk about his parents. Half the time they spent discussing the rationale behind her therapeutic exercises and after a while the appointments became something to look forward to instead of a tiresome hassle. She taught him some strategies to either mitigate the episodes, when he felt they were coming, or deal with them easier, if they still happened. Some of those things Sherlock already knew about, but there were a few unexpectedly effective, as sceptical as Sherlock was in the beginning. John had a new arsenal in his fight to get Sherlock to sleep and eat better, but it was all right, because Sherlock himself started noticing that he was better off with a stricter regime, though some of the more complicated cases still managed to throw him out of it. John didn’t blame him for that, and Sherlock was grateful.
John looked like he wanted to argue, but eventually he sighed and stood up. They went out and John followed without a question, still lost in his reminiscence.
“All of them. I’ve heard so many rumours about the incredible Sherlock that visits the lake often, I had to come and see for myself.”
The white and yellow flowers that sprouted on the path towards the tree that Sherlock used to frequent were a coincidence. Nymphs were quite fond of them.
The tentacle curled around Sherlock’s cock, round and round, covering it completely and then gently tightened and loosened in a maddeningly slow rhythm. Instead of bringing Sherlock to completion, it increased his wanting until it engulfed all the thoughts of his vast mind, leaving no space for deductions, observations or witty remarks. Even begging for more was out of the question. Sherlock would have trashed if he was able to move at all. If the pulsing could go fraction faster, just that little bit tighter, Sherlock could catch his release and he kept chasing and chasing it, feeling it so close, and still just slightly out of his reach.
“John,” the creature answered, and crawled up, until his face was at Sherlock’s hip. “How did you know I was a soldier?”
“So that’s the secret of your youthful looks,” answered John with a wink and the woman giggled. Sherlock pushed his plate away and leaned back, crossing his arms and scanning the crowd. John glanced at the direction he was looking, but nothing caught his eye.
John gasped. It was as hard to contain his joy as it was the disappointment a moment ago, so he kept his eyes fixed to the front and concentrated on keeping in the giggles that threatened to escape. He risked a glance towards Sherlock, who was equally rigid, except for a shy smile on his lips. John was sure Sherlock didn’t even know it was there.
“Patience,” repeated John, while the very tip of the tentacle finally probed Sherlock. All the remains of restrain left him.
Sherlock jerked back abruptly, braking the kiss and making John a little disoriented. “I’m so sorry, John, I seem to have misjudged–”
“Patience,” said John, though his voice betrayed the same hunger Sherlock was feeling, “I don’t want to hurt you.”
They went to the lobby, where a handsome muscular young man in a white uniform was already waiting. He was pleasant and professional, asked Sherlock if he had any injuries or spine problems and then led Sherlock away, leaving John to look for a yoga class on his own.
John grabbed an opportunity to tease Sherlock a little. “Sherlock, I hate to tell you this, but we already are in a relationship. An exclusive one, ta for that.” John added good-humouredly and started counting on his fingers. “We live together, bicker all the time and everyone thinks we’re sleeping together.”
“Partly because I was afraid. She hinted about blackmail. And partly because,” Jane looked away, breathing deeply to keep tears at bay. “I have a degree in software development. I was good at what I did. But then I met Ben, got married and had kids. At first I was glad I didn’t have to go to work anymore, but soon it became insufferably boring.”
“Yes,” John agreed before Sherlock could finish, because there shouldn’t be anything Sherlock had to feel awkward asking, not in bed with John.
“Sherlock,” breathed John, still griping Sherlock’s shirt tightly in his hands, not able to let go just yet. John was overwhelmed, clutching to Sherlock like a life line. He never thought he could ever have this, didn’t even dare to hope, and as this was happening he found himself unable to cope. And yet, it was Sherlock who thought he was risking. The sound‘s that came out of John’s throat were undignified but he could no more stop them as he could let go of the fabric in his fingers.
“Kristen is being transported to a secure facility as we speak,” said Mycroft. “Even if your husband did anything illegal, Kristen had no means to do anything– she is an industrial spy from Germany.”
John spent a couple of very pleasant hours in the park around the SPA, nodding in greeting to other patrons, which were milling around. Thankfully, none of them wanted John’s company, so he could aimlessly wander around, admire the well-kept flower beds and carefully trimmed decorative bushes. John expected to do some serious thinking, but in reality, his mind was blanker than ever. Sherlock’s confession was simmering in the back of his mind, but he had yet to decide if it meant anything. He and Sherlock were growing closer lately, but it was difficult to say if it lead to something. These things were hard to guess with any person and were damn near impossible when it came to Sherlock, so John stopped trying and just enjoyed the walk.
It was getting dark. John had enough sense to close the curtains before leaving, and as soon as the sun began descending, the flat was submerged in long grey shadows. John was often thoughtful like that, catering to Sherlock’s whims and wishes, though there was little he could offer in return. Hopefully, John would find himself a date for the evening, or go for a pint with friends, or do any of the activities normal people did, so Sherlock could willow in his misery undisturbed. Until now, John managed to suffer through Sherlock’s moods without much fuss, and Sherlock dreaded for the time when it would finally be enough for John and he would either demand for Sherlock to snap out of it, or move out himself. Quite possibly both – people often left, even the ones who seemed promising at first. It was one more proof that Sherlock deserved to suffer and there was no point in fighting it. It was only rational – Sherlock was not a valuable member of society and thus he didn’t feel like one, therefore, getting better was not an option. He already got enough handouts – an occupation to entertain himself with, sufficient resources and, unlikely as it was, John as friend. John already stayed far longer than Sherlock predicted, though Sherlock had to admit he hoped that John would continue to stay. Hope was not in any way rational, not in this case, when all the evidence from the past proved the contrary. The familiar knot of anxiety rose in Sherlock’s stomach and he did his best to will it down – he survived in the past, and he will survive this one, worrying won’t change anything, so why think about it? Sherlock sighed deeply. It was about all the effort he could spare in terms of movement, so he remained on the sofa, in a state between wakefulness and dozing. He couldn’t tell how much time has passed, but he didn’t really care.
John was dazed all the way home, and even when he climbed out of the taxi in front of their door. Sherlock, as always, fled the taxi first, leaving John to pay and the familiarity of it was reassuring. Still, going in to the flat was a daunting task.
The embodiment of gracefulness and aloofness, the world’s only consulting detective and overall an incredible human was tripping over his own feet for John Watson. The sight took John’s breath away and he momentarily felt self-conscious and undeserving, but Sherlock glared back at him, as if daring to say anything and John just had to swoop in for another kiss. And so they stumbled, clutching to each other, only vaguely keeping the direction they intended to go to. It was alright though, as the flat wasn’t that big, and those
“Oh, how lovely,” keened John, while a tentacle caressed Sherlock’s perineum. Another tentacle rounded Sherlock’s buttock and the tip of it teased his crevasse. John’s mouth left Sherlock’s and proceeded down his neck, while Sherlock arched and bucked, just barely, because the strength John held him with didn’t allow any more. It felt like drowning, but instead of panicking, Sherlock just wanted to go deeper.
“They were trying too hard. They kept emphasizing how good friends they were, but none of the signs of real friendship were there. Jane showed a lot of signs of distress and mistrust and Kristen didn’t even know Jane had a daughter instead of a son – so I looked into Kristen’s background and it was a straight road from that.”
John stared back at Sherlock, unable to utter any of the million thoughts that rushed through his mind. John lived with the most brilliant man there was and yet, both of them somehow managed to miss something that was right in front of their noses.
“It’s like having sleepovers when we were schoolgirls! Except the wine and the massages,” exclaimed Kristen excitedly.
“Drug addict,” said Sherlock, while the man in the show went on about the strength of his faith in god. John gaped at him in disbelief.
John had an inkling that Sherlock wanted him to take a yoga class only as a petty revenge. John was never very bendy and his injuries prevented him from a full range of movement, and the chirpy young instructor was more prone to spouting spiritual nonsense then helping the attendants to do the poses properly. As a cherry on top, most of the class were experienced enough to do most of the damn asanas effortlessly, while John fumbled even through the most basic ones. All this, while Sherlock was enjoying a massage by that gorgeous man, who probably was much more capable at his job than the yoga instructor had any chance to be. Contrary to the whole yoga spirit, John was furious by the time the class ended.
It was almost midday when something huge forced out of the water, splashing the tree and Sherlock on it, reached the height of Sherlock’s face, twisted mid-air and dived gracefully in the water again. After a couple of breaths, John surfaced again.
“Anyway,” John patted his pockets for a wallet and looked around for his jacket. “I’m popping down to Tesco’s, grab something to eat before we both starve to death. Anything you need?”
“A health resort. A SPA, if you may. I want you to go there and check the lead,” Mycroft patiently repeated after John asked him to. “We’ve been reliably informed that the information leaks come from somebody working there.”
John swam closer and tickled Sherlock’s foot with his tentacle. Sherlock kicked the leg to splash John. They were both grinning like idiots and Sherlock once again felt the goosebumps on his skin, but he didn’t want to show his excitement too much. It was much more pleasant to let John take the lead, and John apparently read his thoughts, because he chose that moment to curl the tentacle around Sherlock’s ankle and yank him into the water.
They ate, and though John still looked remorseful, his posture showed less of despair by the time the evening ended.
“A few years,” replied John, not even bothering to deny the implication. Sherlock didn’t even hear it, scanning the surroundings and observing the staff. John noticed nothing out of the ordinary, but then, he barely ever did.
They stayed for a bit in a companionable silence, Sherlock staring at the ceiling and John staring at him.
“Closeted gay,” mumbled Sherlock about the contestant who kept gushing about his girlfriend. John snorted.
Sherlock stood a little straighter, his face appeared more composed. No permanent damage done due to the slip up, then.
When John woke up, it was already morning. Next to him, Sherlock was sleeping, still in on his back, but his hands were lax and face turned a little to the side. John felt his heart flutter. The ridiculous man probably fell asleep in the middle of his rant, or that Mind Palace exercise of his. It was rare for Sherlock to sleep properly in the middle of the case, but John was certain it would do him a world of good. John stayed in bed, observing his companion, trying to be as still as possible, to even regulate his breathing so he wouldn’t wake Sherlock up. Despite that, not long after Sherlock opened his eyes.
Sherlock snapped out of his near sleeping state when he heard the door open. John was home. He was early – no pints or dates then. Pity. The flat filled with sounds of John moving about, and on one hand, they were familiar and comforting, but on the other, Sherlock could nearly see the disapproving shake of John’s head when he glanced in the direction of the living room sofa, where Sherlock was still in the same position John left him in the morning. John would change, start dinner and would ask if Sherlock wanted any. Sherlock would not answer, so John would eat his meal alone, and would either go out for the evening somewhere more cheerful, or would do something boring that didn’t require being in the living room. If Sherlock was lucky, this would not be the day when John decided enough was enough. There was some clatter in the kitchen and Sherlock tensed in waiting.
“Is it my turn to be mad at you for being too happy?” asked John, though his smile matched Sherlock’s.
Instead of going back to his experiment, Sherlock stepped closer to John, with an intent and focus that was usually reserved for at least six rated cases. “You’re attracted to me, but restrain yourself because it’s me who doesn’t want to have sex with anyone or–”
“I’m not the one who claims to be the world’s only consulting detective,” said John and cupped Sherlock’s cheek to prevent the defensive bristle. “And I love you too. I won’t ever stop telling you that. I want you be certain.”
That did it. John went beetroot red and rushed to his room with a mumbled excuse about needing to pack. He folded his shirts and collected his toiletries, his mind buzzing with the need to figure out the next step. They should sit down and talk openly, tell each other their expectations, but John knew this was never happening. They would have done it long time ago ago, if they were capable. He could just march in to Sherlock’s room, take him in his arms and kiss him, but he risked a punch to the jaw and an end to the most important friendship John had in his life. There was always a chance he just interpreted things the way he wanted to and Sherlock was just friendlier because he was less stressed out. John stood with a ball of dirty socks in his hands, lost in thought, until Sherlock came in to ask if he was ready to go. John nodded, threw the socks in the luggage and went out after Sherlock.
Sherlock should have known. John tended to act unpredictably from time to time, and thus the evening went on a little differently. John did prepare something, but he didn’t ask if Sherlock wanted any, nor did he sat down to eat alone. John came to the living room and sat on the end of the sofa, moving Sherlock’s legs a little to make room. Sherlock risked a glance at him. John opened a book and settled in, as if it was perfectly normal to have a quiet evening reading while your roommate imitated a log.
“Me, having feelings of romantic nature towards you.” Sherlock fidgeted a bit. It was too warm in the flat, and a little stuffy, and he might have eaten something contaminated for lunch, because there was a hint of nausea in the back of his throat.
He must have demanded that out loud, because more tentacles joined in touching Sherlock. A tentacle curled around his one of his nipples and gently pinched it, while John licked and sucked the other. Sherlock felt caresses on the underside of his knees, barely there tickles on his toes and rhythmic curls on his stomach, but the most pleasure come from the tentacle than glided up and down his fully erect cock, while three of the tentacles crawled up Sherlock’s neck and caressed his cheek. Sherlock turned his head and licked the tip of the closest one, feeling it move on his tongue. He enjoyed the taste and texture, and the gasp that he heard from John filled him with deep satisfaction. The tentacle on his buttocks went from teasing to insistent as it reached Sherlock’s opening, and Sherlock tried to push down on it, but John still didn’t let him.
That was an understatement so absurd, Sherlock didn’t even acknowledge it. It was John’s turn to roll his eyes.
“Stop, John, I didn’t mean anything like that. It’s just that my first time was horrible for both parties involved, mainly due to inexperience and lack of clear communication of expectations. And the subsequent ones were tedious, so I simply stopped bothering with the thing completely.”
“My sincerest apologies,” said Sherlock, and pecked John on the corner of his lips. John giggled. Sherlock was moments away from bursting in to waltz with John. Maybe John would mind too much.
“A wife and two kids,” said Sherlock about the one that just entered the studio in the show. A host then proceeded to question a contestant and he revealed being very happily married and proud of his three daughters. Sherlock grunted in annoyance.
“I sure you will. There must be someone out there for you,” reassured John, though the though made him sad.
“Do you trust me?” asked John and Sherlock merely rolled his eyes in response. Sherlock came to the tree and let himself be dragged into the water, surely the answer was obvious enough?
“I am very well, doctor, thank you,” the woman was bringing their menus and rushing the girls who waited the tables simultaneously. In Sherlock’s opinion, John should have been treated with this level of respect in every place he showed up.
John‘s heart sank. He tried hard not to show his disappointment and keep his breath under control. He could never fool Sherlock, but it seemed important keep at least a little of his dignity. John wanted to turn away from Sherlock, but the window would reflect his expression perfectly, so John kept his eyes fixed firmly to the front. Nevertheless, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Sherlock very slowly removing his gloves, putting them neatly on his lap, and then his hand returned to the middle of the seat, this time covering John’s.
Out the corner of his eyes, John saw Sherlock walking away from the reception and trotted after him towards their rooms.
Sherlock made an approving grin. Mycroft and Sherlock had one of their wordless conversations that annoyed John so much, and then Mycroft heaved a put upon sigh.
When John went in to his room, Sherlock wandered in behind him, looked around and went out without a word, only to reappear a moment later through the connecting door, roll his eyes and shut those as well. They had adjoining rooms then. John wandered if it was a coincidence, or Mycroft arranged for that, and what it meant, if he did. Most probably, Mycroft expected John to rein Sherlock in, as the detective was so reluctant to take this case.
That was more than Sherlock had ever offered about himself. It explained a lot, but it still baffled John, that somebody had a chance of intimacy with Sherlock, the most remarkable human there was, and made the experience unpleasant. If Sherlock allowed to, he should be cherished and cared for, and somebody had that chance and didn’t take it. It was a sad thought, especially since John could do nothing about that.
“The things I would like to do to you,” whispered John to Sherlock’s ear. The tentacle moved up Sherlock’s belly, reached his nipple and curled tightly around it. Sherlock bucked up.
Sherlock waited for Mrs Dhawan to go away. “You were so sad that you couldn’t save the boy’s hand, and they are just happy that their son is alive,” Sherlock told John.
Jane smoothed the wrinkles of her nightgown with her palms. “I know it’s the worst excuse I can offer, but Kristen brought back excitement. I was important, I had something else besides the cleaning and feeding my kids.”
Sherlock’s free hand went to caress John’s temple, and Sherlock was surprised to discover that was something he wanted to do for a long time. John reacted favourably to that and the next moment, Sherlock was being kissed, gently and sweetly, and there was something already familiar about John’s lips on his, as if that’s where they were supposed to be. Sherlock finally understood how John felt after finding out – Sherlock wanted to never stop, but his happiness caused him to grin, and it was hard to grin and kiss at the same time.
“He’s just being annoying,” said Sherlock in a tone that suggested it should have been obvious. “And I’m not alarmed of sex, by the way. Just indifferent.”
“No, I don’t mind your feelings of romantic nature,” John shook his head at that, stepped closer and took Sherlock’s hand. “Do you still wish to do that experiment or can I just tell you the outcome?”
As the evening grew longer, Sherlock got more and more restless. John would have been glad to stay longer, have a bit of more wine, but it was obvious Sherlock needed something, so John excused for them both and left with Sherlock. They came back to John’s room, where Sherlock started pacing and spouting his deductions at a speed John had no chance of following. Sherlock made long pauses where he just paced the room, but he didn’t ask of any contributions from John, so he decided to just start getting ready for bed.
His head turned then and John was startled by how handsome he was. He had a long, narrow nose, a pronounced jawline, short locks of sandy blond hair, and blue eyes that were hooded with intoxication. John had always been a sucker for blue eyes.
God, he wished Victor was here. He would clap John on the back with a bark of laughter that would light up his eyes and say “Ease up, Watson. He’s my husband, not a croc.”
When he returned, John took an immediate long drink from the fresh glass of beer. He knew exactly the question to ask.
The changed dynamic between them pained him in a way he could not express. It was sharp, unrelenting. John felt that he'd lost a friend- and in a way, he supposed he did.
His head snapped to see her face through the doorway. She smiled mischievously before taking her final exit.
If John were a bit more like Sherlock, maybe he could solve the case of what was going through his companion’s mind.
“Captain John Watson,” introduced Sherlock, his hand brazenly gesturing to where John stood uncomfortably extending his hand to Wiggins who, instead of shaking his hand, just stared at him with a half smile. John dropped his hand uncomfortably when Sherlock continued, “John here is in need of your talents on drums for his band.”
John repressed the urge to roll his eyes alongside Philip. “It’s fine,” he dismissed. “Let’s meet him.”
A hard lump found its way up his throat, lodging itself stubbornly in its familiar spot as he put his enormous instrument into its lined casing. It truly was ludicrous how unnecessarily huge the instrument was. Though as much as he complained about its size, he would never admit aloud that there was no better sensation than that of feeling the vibration of the plucked strings through the whole of his body. It was an unparalleled comfort to his frantic mind.
Philip very much doubted this. But the offer of friendship was far too tempting to deny. And furthermore, his willingness to extend kindness despite his own frankly appalling behaviour stirred guilt from deep within himself. Which is how he came to release a reluctant, “Alright. Sure.”
Sherlock’s hands could not be satisfied with any one position on John’s body. He grasped the strong shoulder blades, allowed his hands to wander the length of his spine, the gentle give of his sides, run down his arms and glorifying in every new piece of information he could immerse himself in.
The winter wind whipped a long pea coat around his legs, standing far from John- and not just physically. His answers had been short, his patience thin, his demeanour unkind.
“I think,” John said, voice muffled as the words were spoken into Sherlock’s chest, “this is the most extraordinary stag night in history.”
Watching John swear before God and his family that he would eternally love and protect another was unendurable. It was verifiable proof that his love had always been unreciprocated. It was visual evidence at odds with the hypothesis he’d always known he shouldn’t propose. Yet by the warmth of John’s light, Sherlock had revealed more of himself to the man and fell in love along the way.
But now Victor was dead and perhaps Mycroft should blame himself for having obliged Victor's ridiculous, fatal request.
His left hand was resting gently on his upper right arm while the other cupped John's neck. The motion was tender and provoked further tears. Still, he kept his hand over his eyes, far too ashamed to reveal himself.
One night, after everything has broken apart as much as it could possibly break, John attempts to fix it all.
Apparently, he’d decided a meeting at his home would be most appropriate. John travelled the streets with only slight confusion due to less familiarity with this portion of town and, after a fair amount of walking, glanced once more at the paper in his hand.
He set his trumpet down and set to release it from its case, eye fixed with intention on the latches.
His stomach lurched uncomfortably, driving his thoughts away from the death that was creeping up around him. His thoughts spiralled, always spiralled, always to the same place.
. “So you’ve noticed that I never-” Since he couldn't finish these thoughts, he let the sentences fall away to insinuation and was elated to find a smile spread wide and disbelieving on John’s face.
A knowing smile crossed his face, nearly all of his teeth exposed at the width of it. “You said you never understood it
Redbeard was a pseudonym that seemed to match a man’s persona. Yet the writing was loopy and neat. Based on that, the balance of probability said that they were a woman.
“Afternoon,” he murmured, excitement leaving him with great speed to be replaced by overactive anxiety. He rose his right hand to look at his watch, realizing with dread that he was far too early. 17 minutes early, to be exact.
It had, of course, been lovely. But what he’d thought was a simple uncontrollable urge to lie brought him to the larger bedroom in the house, hands wringing in on themselves as he asked his elder brother, ten years old at the time, “Why do the words from my mouth sound different from the thoughts in my head?”
John wanted to groan, wanted to shake the brilliant mind and make him see reason. He knew- could feel it in his gut with absolute certainty- that this was meant to be: Sherlock joining their band of broken men to convey the image of wartime struggle for this contest. Sherlock needed this band as much as John did, as much as they all did.
“And in London? Our hotel will be five-star and stand eleven stories high. The lobby will be so beautiful, it was in a movie that was released less than a month prior. They’ll show us to our sparkling rooms, the beds soft as can be imagined and a view of Big Ben himself. Guest services will welcome us and say: ‘You’ve arrived at last. You’ve been fighting for far too long.’”
He promised himself that he would just go in to check whether anybody else played a move on the chessboard, but he was kicking himself for hoping. After all, it would probably be weeks before somebody decided to engage in the game he’d begun. It was a stupid hope. But it was all he had.
They looked together around the corner, Mary’s slight figure leaning into a man as her hair fell in swirling curtains around her. This new bar was noiser, more lively.
They followed her 1.5 kilometres to another bar (stumbling over their own feet only thrice between the two of them) and sat at a table that was more than sufficiently hidden from her view. She continued her attempts to ensnare a mate, her booze-driven mind unaware that the two men had eyes on her.
John suffered the pain of lost love and now Sherlock, too, understood how significant that agony was.
Sherlock Holmes was 32 and life was boring. Worse, even, life didn’t feel worth living. He was blown along life’s swirling breeze in pointless motions; always moving but never settling anywhere.
John pulled away quite suddenly, the motion causing a sharp panic to rise in Sherlock. But he simply pulled away enough to look into Sherlock’s eyes, his hands remaining delicately on Sherlock’s chest, fingers softly dancing along the sensitive skin.
“Don’t insult me,” Sherlock said, voice falling to frustration for the smallest moment. “I know you’re hiding something. I know it. I used to think it was okay, that it would pass, that I could live with it. But it’s not. And it hasn't. And… I can’t.”
He turned on the balls of his feet away from him and took one step before John threw caution to the wind and gripped him tightly by the elbow. He felt his fingers dig through layers of flappy skin before he got a grip on any bone or muscle.
He deliberated the concept, staring with wonder out his bedroom window. The leaves were turning red, several weak leaves floating along the breeze to a new home. Did he have one? A place where he felt comfortable, a sense of belonging, or familiarity?
“I couldn't stop my hand from rising to wipe away that snowflake. The attempt to resist was futile. I rested my thumb on your nose, the moisture melting between my thumb and your skin before I swiped away that moisture. My hand rested on your cheek, a motion I had no excuse for. It was the natural position to assume after my thumb brushed your nose.”
Sherlock should have deduced it. Should have known the tree’s height, the width of the base, and the height of John’s maximum reaching span would not allow it.
“Sherlock Holmes,” he repeated softly and it was such a ridiculous thing to repeat, his face flashed to expose his embarrassment. Jerking into motion quickly, he dropped his gaze and murmured “nice to meet you” before entering a long silence between the two of them, John focusing hard on attending to the bloody gash.
It turned out they were, in fact, only one second. Passing by one another for one split second. The two had just one second together and the million more miles before him seemed impossible to traverse alone.
Whatever he’d been expecting, it certainly hadn’t been that. “Mary?” he practically shouted, ducking down in the booth as her head turned to the source of her name. Then, in a whisper, “Why was Mary going to hire a private detective?”
The question surprised him. Partially for the interest Sherlock now showed in him and partially for the strangeness of the inquiry. His finger itched toward another shot, the desire unstoppable within him. “What do you mean?”
“Well, for one thing, they keep your feet warm,” John said distantly, flipping over the price tag of a tie that he thought Lestrade might enjoy.
“You had too much to live for,” Death says as though these words don’t pierce Sherlock's mind with needles of confusion.
“Sherlock,” John called from his piano where he was amassing a pile of unorganized papers. “You okay?
They wrapped their set to a scattered round of polite applause, taking their leave off the stage to the modest backstage room with dust so thick, it was palpable on his tongue.
The day John Watson arrived in his life was red: exciting, spontaneous, and daring. The two of them were full of physical energy, enthusiasm, and determination. The flames of passion licked awake the red within him.
“And I know I’ve said it, and you’ll hear me say it for the rest of my life, but I cannot express to you how sorry I am. I’m sorry for hurting you, for blaming you, for hitting- for assault-”
His eyes flitted unbidden to the box beside him. Not the Iceman, but a snowman. Perhaps it wasn’t such a ridiculous idea.
“Obviously,” said Sherlock in a tone that suggested the question had been an unimportant one. “Tea?”
Sherlock was clearly too horrified to speak, to move, to react. This was not what he’d expected. He was motionless, breathless, helpless.
“We’re performing in about a week and a half,” he said quickly, words stumbling across one another in their race to escape. “Since you found us Wiggins… Do you want to come watch?”
Sherlock groaned, throwing his head back with annoyance. John nearly drooled watching his neck as he did so. Then, turning to look at John, he said, “I actually do need to go do that.”
Good LORD, I cried buckets and buckets while writing this. I know not everyone finds this sort of stuff sad but I was
When there was not immediately an answer, he rose his head again to find Sherlock’s eyes penetrating him.
“Hmm?” hummed Sherlock in response, his eyes blinking him back to reality as they refocused on John.
It seemed to Philip that everything he had ever gone through was simply preparing him for the thick guard he now put between himself and everyone else around him. He exited the military at long last and finally go to law school- a long-time dream of his.
It was always John Watson. Always the reason he stopped himself from creating a forced encounter with death. Always the reason he allowed the marching. Always the reason he saw a purpose in the march forward. Always the reason he fought against death.
!” he shouted as loudly as he could manage, his hand crushing the telegram in his hands. The telegram, the unlikely cause of his shattered heart and crumbling world, shook in his clenched hand. He wanted to turn the newly formed fist against his brother, but his body collapsed beneath him, no longer in possession of the strength it took to live.
“So Phil here told me about your band idea,” he announced and Philip shot a guilty glance to John for a reason he couldn’t fathom.
Their set was good, with Philip offering a particularly skilled solo on his saxophone. Greg plucked softly to give a mellow, steady beat for Philip to groove against and after an impressive two minutes of enthralling jazz runs, Greg caught his eye and gave him an encouraging, dazzling smile. In response, Philip’s eyes went wide, his fingers slipping from their proper position for the smallest of seconds, and while the momentary loss of control was nearly indiscernible to the ignorant crowd they were playing for, it earned a stern look from Tobias.
No. Whisky. He needed whisky. He got up, thoughts of turning off the radio fading away with his desire to numb his thoughts. Scavenging the cupboards, he found merely one empty flask and one empty bottle, both mocking him with their broken promises. A final chord played with the cheery song when a low, soothing voice began to speak into the emptiness of John’s apartment.
John drummed his fingers against his palm as he made to follow the man in a last-minute attempt to keep his fingers limber. Sholto picked up his case containing his trombone while Greg, Philip, and Tobias carried their instruments loose as though they were extensions of their own hands.
John’s trembling fist collided against the rustic wallpaper, the resulting crack a lament for everything they’d worked toward. The pain of impact didn’t register, the faint calls behind him from his bandmates landing mute upon his ringing ears.
At four years old, he’d made his mother tear up a bit when she’d asked her sons how they were enjoying their supper and he had responded, “It’s disgusting, mummy.”
Deep sigh. I didn't mean to write light angst. It just sort of... happened. Regular readers know that I love (
John sought out exactly the right words in the English language to express his horror. “Because I cannot fathom such horror being unloaded onto you. I feel… a terror that such a terrifying thing was done to you.”
Over the course of the next few weeks, that game was the highlight of his days. Every day, he would stop in before work, during lunch, and after work to check up on the progress. Most days, there would be at least one move from his competitor- Redbeard. On wonderful days, there would be two. On the worst days, there were zero moves.
So he suffered alone and in silence. He watched as he made enemies with everybody around him and was helpless to prevent it. He would have given anything in this world or this life to be able to break himself of the malison that turned every person he’d ever known against him. They were right: he was rude, he was cruel, he was unbearable.
His laugh was water in a desert, a lick of warmth from a much-needed flame, a gulp of country air after years in the city. It put a smile on his own face, and he knew right then everything was going to change. He burned for want of going back in time to fix it all.
As for Jonathan, the most thrilling part of that saga has already been told. After Philip realized he had feelings for him, those feelings wouldn’t be silenced. Nothing of their dynamic changed, but he spent most of their time together pining after the gorgeous young man. Jonathan proceeded to date a respectable string of women and Philip learned far too early in his life what it was to squash down jealousy that would threaten to consume him.
“Playing the game, John,” he said matter of factly, a finger rising to the corner of his lip to wipe away the smallest of drops that had made its way to his skin.
No. No, it wasn’t okay. Without realizing he’d made the decision, he was on his feet and throwing open his bedroom door. He felt as though he were floating toward his destination rather than stomping like a maniac in a manner that would surely offend the floorboards. Rounding the corner with his eyes on the prize, he spotted the light come to life under the doorway and a wave of newfound anger mounted in him. So Sherlock was awake. The brilliant, clever man definitely knew what this was about, too.
“Come on, sir. I’m dyin’ here,” John begged, his eyes wide with an attempt to portray every sincerity. “The whole town’s giving me the same runaround; not a gig in sight. The only thing I live for is to play. If I can’t play… what’s the use of me making it back?”
“So,” said Sherlock slowly and he knew that Sherlock was feeling uncomfortable as well. Why had John thought this would be a good idea? “Would you like to know which of your band members was a prisoner of war?”
It appalled him even now, John’s cruelty. His rapid and merciless execution of all hopes Sherlock had ever been foolish enough to maintain.
John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were not two birds of a feather. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were two sides of the same coin; the unity in a whole of two opposites.
A lightness filled him that could have permitted him to take flight right there and then. Joy beyond joy, relief beyond relief, and hope beyond hope made his soul as buoyant as air.
Bisexual panic rose in him, his mouth dry and uncertain whether or not to continue yelling at him for ruining the game. He debated switching his approach to flirting.
His eyebrows moved together in thought. John had the impression that perhaps he’d reach his thoughts quicker if he were sober. “What is that- the Solomon Islands, right?”
Sherlock pushed forward, hoping to change the direction of John’s mood. “I don’t mean you’re-” but his throat burned with the almost truth. He twisted his face from the fire in his throat and altered his tactic. “I mean to say… has your moderate intelligence allowed you to-” a deep breath to steady his nerves- “nothing anything peculiar about me?”
Sherlock stood silently for a long moment, his brain’s churning was nearly audible in the silence. “It’s a horror I can’t bear to see in your eyes. These scars… they’re… ugly.”
John’s mouth crept into a smile so slowly, the pace of it sent bolts of fear through Sherlock’s veins. He dropped the newspaper and his eyes moved lazily to connect with Sherlock’s. The contact bound them together and in that moment, only the two of them existed in the whole world.
John walked over to the bar with what he sincerely hoped was an easy, steady walk. Within just a few feet of Mary but pretending not to notice her, he called for another shot- a shot he desperately wished he wouldn’t actually need to take. It was quite enough for the world to spin without needing to throw up.
In two days, they would be called to a stage to perform the fruits of their hard work in front of a live audience. Their performance would additionally be broadcast throughout the greater Cardiff region via radio airwaves. With every practice run, their performance improved in quality and John was filled with irrefutable certainty that on the 16th of December, they would give the greatest performance of all.
Sherlock nodded in response and Lestrade thought hard for a moment. “You know, you’re lucky. Won’t ever have to know the pain of love, I guess.”
The sun was setting behind him, the last rays of the day holding on desperately to dimly illuminate the world at its most ominous.
Without too much thought, John shoved Love Actually into their DVD player. John remained kneeled before the telly just long enough to skip through the trailers and select play on the menu before rising to his feet.
The thought arose so violently, John was sick with the abruptness of it. It was ridiculous, of course. It was far more likely that he was distant because the two were, in retrospect, strangers. But the two words rang in his head getting louder and louder.
Slowly, millimetres taken at a crawl, he felt his body lean closer to his best friend in response to Victor’s own increasing closeness. The two were shaking, either from anticipation, fear, or any other emotion running rampant within them, and for the smallest of moments, before their mouths found one another, their eyes were wide open and observing the universe in each other’s souls. When their lips touched with the lightest of brushes, their lids fell closed and Sherlock’s entire stomach clenched into a tight ball that dropped straight out of his body. His mind went completely silent, wholly consumed by thoughts of Victor.
“It’s a rather fascinating story- actually, not particularly.” John laughed, unable to tear his eyes away from Sherlock. “Though I’d love to share it with you. Perhaps-” he swallowed, his expression faltering for the first time with what appeared to be nerves. “Perhaps over dinner? I know a great little Italian place.”
There were two other murders, of course. But Lauren was the outlier. It was no use solving the others, solving Lauren’s would solve it all and without hers, he could not solve the others.
Together, they laughed against the wall of 221B. John’s laughter ricocheted against the walls melodiously and his heart constricted with love. He hadn’t caught the signs then, but he recognized them now.
Yet he was early and without his desktop to occupy his attention, he took to watching his classmates enter and reasoning how many hours of sleep they got, whether they shared a bed with a sibling (and if so- sister or brother? Older or younger?), or any other information he could accumulate based on the provided evidence. Anthony slept alone in a bed that was too big for him for roughly nine hours. Steve slept with a sibling- no, two siblings for four hours, but not consecutively. Margaret slept for seven hours with no interruptions but something delayed her falling asleep. Perhaps fighting parents? Perhaps discussing something of interest with her brother? Or perhaps-
“Look,” he said, exasperated. He turned on his heel and addressed a furiously perplexed Sherlock. “They’re cute, alright? People like cute things. Even if they’re not ‘practical.’ Sometimes ordinary people like to get things just because they're cute.”
The fateful day of the competition sat a mere nine days from Sherlock’s introduction of the song. With their standard rehearsal schedule, it would have left a mere four rehearsals at ninety minutes each. It would have been tight, even for this accumulation of music experts. At the behest of John, they managed to work in two additional rehearsal times for the lot of them to cement their perfection. As a result of these six rehearsals, two gigs at The Crescent, and the pressure of the impending competition, tensions were running high among the seven men.
“Yes,” she finally said with the note of a question in her voice. “Are you a client? Did you hear of him through his advertisement in the paper?”
Sherlock was stopped in his steps, but his gently curved back was still turned to the desperate John whose tongue struggled to form the words swimming just out of reach. That back, John knew, was host to a disarray of scar tissue tragically delicate in its grooves and ridges.
“Sherlock…” the contrast between the consonants and vowels as the name escaped John’s lips were intoxicating, unparalleled in its impact on his whole body.
Her mouth crept slowly across her face, a mischievous glint in her eyes that did nothing to appease the knot in his stomach. Slowly- too slowly- she extracted some sort of pamphlet from within her jacket. No, not a pamphlet- a flyer.
Relief flooded through his entire body, illuminating him from the inside and providing him with an unfamiliar lightness.
They collapsed into one another, their longing for one another making itself known in the way John’s hands reached to cup Sherlock’s face, one hand slipping along his neck to entwine itself in his hair and the other remaining steadfast along his cheek with a ferocity that felt, more than anything else, like home. Sherlock’s legs moved him closer to John until one was between John’s and the other was to the left of his. It was only their embrace that allowed them to remain standing at all, but it seemed the least of their worries.
“Listen,” he said softly, gently. “You don’t have to- perform. Just… come to a practice. I can say you’re there to give feedback- which you can. Okay? And we can make a deal.” This got Sherlock’s attention, his eyebrows shooting upward and his body leaning in. “If you like it- if you find yourself glad you came, then you sing along with me on one of the practice songs.”
Shit. When he and Sherlock had come up with the brilliant idea of John flirting with Mary to try to find out information, this possibility hadn’t occurred to him.
Tobias’ eyebrows grew closer together in thought, a slight frown forming. “There’s this guy- trombone player- but he’s got a real bug up his ass...”
The simplicity of it. Sherlock had spent so much time identifying the possibility of lies, he’d never realized they only needed to change their frame of reference.
“Oh, this handsome soldier boy. Obviously too old for me but it didn’t stop me. I waited hours for him outside his dorm with flowers. When he saw me there, he laughed... I cried.”
The closet, the foot of the bed, various patterns on the floor, and one floorboard on the right side of his bed saw thinner dust accumulation compared to the rest of the flat.
John isn't tall enough to place the star on top of the Christmas tree. Luckily, Sherlock can help with that.
“Hmmm.” The happy sound escaped Sherlock slowly. It was another minute before his eyes opened to their present world.
The Mind Palace, in theory, was a memory recollection system. In practice, however, it was capable of so much more.
The wrong idea? What was the right idea? But he was strolling away before John could even begin to wonder what was happening.
“Nothing at all,” he laughed. “I told you- my brother has influence in all government matters. To boot, he happens to be particularly meddlesome. He marked me as a 4-F in the official records the moment he caught wind of the war- in 1934.”
“That's Captain John Watson to you,” he said running the last few metres toward him with deep breaths.
John’s lips, more gentle than he could ever have imagined, were firm and knowing on his own and Sherlock relished it. There was a safety in it, the knowledge that he could give himself completely over and not worry about getting lost; he had John Watson.
. It’s what I do, John. I see things, I make sense of the physical evidence in front of me and make my deductions based on what I see. I don’t
“Leave me alone,” Sherlock pouted, rolling his shoulder away from his touch and sinking lower into the booth.
It was a gloomy, dreadful, chaotic day when his assistant informed him that Victor as awaiting a private meeting with him. Mycroft was as startled as he could be, a fairly difficult feat to accomplish.
John sat out of her view with his back to her, of course, in case she scanned her environment and saw him again. Sherlock, however, was certain she would not recognize him as the culprit who sloshed an entire glass of water all over her.
How could he have let it happen? His rage, ever close to boiling, steamrolled every rational thought in his grief. Beyond reason, he blamed Sherlock.
“John!” he bellowed, aggressively loud against the ringing silence John’s ears were accustomed to. He walked into the flat past John without waiting for any further exchange of formalities.
truth. For example, he was able to simply tell his brother to shut up when he was being unbearably imperious. Commandments, after all, were neither truth nor falsehood; they were simply orders.
He deliberated the concept, staring with wonder out his bedroom window. The leaves were turning red, several weak leaves floating along the breeze to a new home. Did he have one? A place where he felt comfortable, a sense of belonging, or familiarity?
He waited several minutes for a response, and when one didn’t come he threw the phone onto the counter, muttering things that would make Mrs. Hudson blush. Armed with a scowl, a small wastebasket, and a flyswatter, John settled in for a day of mouse-hunting. Honestly, it was hardly the strangest way he’d spent a day off. Life was rarely dull these days.
Sherlock’s tiny gasp of surprise only drew John closer. He leaned down over the man and let his hand come up to firmly hold Sherlock’s head in place. After a moment he pulled away to study him the way an artist pulls away to consider the brushstroke he has just made. Sherlock’s expression, though shocked, clearly was not one of horror and disgust, so instead of letting him take a moment to recover, John mercilessly pulled him in for another kiss. He’d waited long enough. Both of his hands slipped into dark curls, cupping Sherlock’s skull in place as he pressed their mouths together.
The unmasked horror on Sherlock’s face drew a few deserved chuckles from John. Immediately, the ghost of a smile lifted a corner of Sherlock’s lips, belying his affected alarm. The detective shot a look at John out of the corner of his eye, a silent acknowledgement that all was forgiven and he was grateful.
He hadn’t seen this photo in ages. It had been packed up with the rest of his military memorabilia in a box in his closet. John had set the box there when he’d first moved into Baker street and had had no reason to disturb it since.
He wondered about the photograph while buying jam at Tesco. He wondered about it as he was trying to fall asleep at night. He wondered about it as he listened to recorded temperatures and took pulses. He wondered about it, especially, while he and Sherlock sat comfortably side by side on the couch watching telly, discussing cases, simply enjoying each other’s company.
“John, I don’t have time for whatever dull remarks you’re going to make about cleanliness,” Sherlock waved him off, setting down a plastic bag on the table. “The mice are of no concern. I can tell from your posture that you were able to find all six.”
The cab ride was not particularly fun for either of them. Sherlock sat slumped in his seat with his eyes glued to his phone. This wasn’t unusual, but John had spent enough time sitting in silence with the other man that he could tell a comfortable silence from one filled with tension, awkwardness, and with both of them distinctly trying to avoid looking in the other’s general direction.
They paid him the same regard as their recently vaulted brethren, which was none at all. They ignored him completely as he swore and stomped back to the kitchen for the glove, everything starting to look a bit red.
Instead, he’d unleashed a torrent of vitriol at any Yard officer who dared question his methods or deductions.
He couldn’t be certain, but he had a sneaking suspicion that Sherlock had never been with another person this way before.
He was confused because somehow the photograph he’d been obsessing about, the photograph that in his mind he’d built up to be some hidden key to his understanding of Sherlock’s inner life – thinking that if he
“Well it was before I knew they part of an experiment,” John grumbled, before re-thinking his stance. “Wait –
The result was immediate as Sherlock flushed pink. John let his eyes follow the blush down his cheekbones, down his neck, disappearing into his shirt. John decided that was his favorite thing in the world.
It just made him seem more…human somehow, knowing that he sometimes succumbed to temptation the same as all of the other “dull” people he (pretended he) was so repelled by.
Sherlock actually looked up at him for the first time, and now John saw the fear he’d been expecting.
John trusted Sherlock, he really did. He knew that the man had no desire to fall back on old habits.  Perhaps John
“Breathe, Sherlock,” he murmured against his lips, recalling somewhere in the back of his mind how he’d had to now urged the man to eat, sleep, and breathe. Sherlock gasped, moaned, and fisted his hands in John’s jumped to pull him even closer.
There was a faint shuffling sound, and a few minutes later, Sherlock emerged, impeccably dressed with every hair in place and an expression of complete indifference. As if he hadn’t spent the last three and a half hours hiding inside his room. John barely suppressed a self-satisfied smirk.
Sherlock looked gorgeous, though still a little wide-eyed and like he might dart at any moment if John’s hands weren’t firmly twined in his curls. His lips were swollen and parted as he gulped down another breath. Despite the younger man’s nervousness, John could feel him staring at his lips again and he grinned a little mischievously.
Sherlock pointedly ignored him in favor of opening the laptop. He was sitting just a little too stiffly, John noticed.
“John,” Sherlock gasped, an edge of warning in his breathless voice. He look up at John, curls plastered to his forehead in sweat and legs spread wantonly wide as he let John have all of him, every bit.
“Then it will be an even more insufferably dull three days while I do nothing but wait to return to London,” Sherlock complained. The return flight had already been booked. It was a busy travel weekend and Mycroft had certainly already had to pull some strings to get the flights as it was. “I still find it hard to believe that the hospital will cease to function if you take a few days off.”
“It was quite an unfortunate series of comments,” Sherlock murmured in agreement, letting his head fall back onto the seat as he regained his composure.
John frowned at that, but the smell of the take-away was an effective distraction. “Is that Thai?” he asked cautiously, edging nearer the bag.
, John insisted to himself. Just a weird moment that he had imagined. Sherlock wouldn’t even remember this by the time he’d returned home. John had just – had too much caffeine, is all.
John stomped over to the window and wrenched it open. He flung the furry white interloper down into the alley, feeling maybe just the tiniest bit vengeful as he did so.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice betrayed a hint of nerves. “We can pretend it never happened. Our working relationship does not need to change at all.” Sherlock’s voice was quiet, and under different circumstances John might have thought he was pleading.
There were little moments of shared grins and laughter. Looks that expressed things that didn’t need words. The unvoiced understanding that they were in this, whatever
An image of Sherlock as a scowling, scrawny child popped into his head unbidden – a bright eyed, curly-headed boy forced to sit still during an endless supper when he’d rather be up in his room working on an experiment.
John also made sure to make an inordinate amount of noise every time he walked up the stairs to the flat, to the point where Mrs. Hudson asked him at one point if he could please keep it down, love.
Sherlock was quiet, staring straight ahead with his hands clasped in his lap. John studied his outline a moment more before turning to look out his own window, feeling like a terrible friend.
He felt scrambling hands at his own trousers and moaned openly against Sherlock’s lips as the man worked him free of his pants. John didn’t care if he was too old to be having sex crouched over someone at a table like they were in a shadowed corner of a college party. He shamelessly leaned over Sherlock, bracing one arm against the table as he used his other to grasp both their erections firmly in his hand.
He shut the window and turned around to survey the flat with a sigh. They really needed to be more careful about leaving food and entrails out…
hear me coming up the stairs,” He continued, enjoying the way Sherlock’s chest rose and fell underneath his wandering hand. God, the man’s body was responsive. “You can usually where I’ve been and what kind of day I’ve had just by listening to the way I take those seventeen steps. Because you’re brilliant.” He kissed Sherlock’s neck. “Amazing.” He kissed his cheek.  A choked whine from Sherlock. John let his hand drift down and finally come to rest on Sherlock’s thigh. “But not that day. Interesting.”
"I want you by my side," Sherlocked breathed next to him. So quietly, only they could hear. His lips hardly ghosting, as the cameras flashed around them. Both were blankly staring at the crowd that surrounded on all sides. The police escort. The caution tape. The reporters. Here Sherlock was baring his heart out, and wishing - more than he had ever wanted anything in his whole privileged life, that for one precious moment, they could have had the privacy of 221b. The chance to say this in closed quarters. Behind locked doors. And to take it all back, if need be...
.”  John was practically growling.  But it was a ‘I’m-barely-holding-myself-back-here!' Kind of growl and a 'you-better-damn-well-hurry-up-before-
“Right,” John nodded, stepping up, “ - explain away then?” John pressed up against him and took a few more kisses, so willing, so readily offered, before he himself was pulled into Sherlock’s room by the hand, and the door shut and locked with a twist of the knob.
Mike was looking at Sherlock closely. Watching as the telltale signs of his 'sociopath' façade slipped briefly below the radar, and he was staring at a young boy behind the eyes. It was somewhat disorienting ...
"Please," he indicated with his hand to the seat opposite him and hoped he looked as welcoming as he could.
in rebellion - just to see what this woman would do in response? And how long it would take her to notice …? When someone shuffled into the room waving for attention and they were off to ANOTHER part of the rehearsal.
“Could get used to this,” John teased. He pushed open the door to 221b with his palm, Mrs. Hudson had left it on the latch for them.
Sherlock was saying from his perch on the top of the booth. Logically the only place to sit with Emmy in his seat. He was eying John with some amusement … and something softer … that made John’s stomach flutter a bit.
“He lives,” John said wryly, ignoring the scowl cast his direction. Sherlock didn’t say a word as he swept through the room, gathering up his coat and scarf. Not talking was fine, John decided. As long as he didn’t feel like he needed to hide away. He heard the other man pause in the doorway for a moment, and the clear his throat.
Sherlock was frozen, eyes wide, staring at John’s as if he had absolutely no idea what the man could possibly mean. John waited patiently, expecting some kind of response…but clearly he had broken Sherlock, who continued to stare at John as though he’d just declared himself the queen. Leave it to Sherlock to make John to all the work, as usual.
John warmed to these changes like a cat curling into touch. He didn’t feel as guilty ducking out of his (rare) dates when Sherlock texted him to
Well, alright then. John could live with that. He could still feel the tension radiating from the other man, though, and knew that something was still off. He hoped the murders would cheer Sherlock up. Once again, John marveled at the oddity that was his life.
“John,” Sherlock groaned, managing to sound both irritated and breathless at the same time. “Obvious.”
He could have been imaging it, but he thought he saw a faint flush creeping up the other man’s neck, whether in response to John’s words or his demands is anyone’s guess.
He thought he may be the only one. That idea, coupled with the fact that Sherlock was actually willing to let him share in this little secret, made him feel even more protective and admiring of this complex man.
Under John’s close scrutiny, the detective’s actions seemed uncharacteristically awkward and hesitant as he pulled off his scarf and coat and hung them up. He didn’t meet John’s gaze.
All in all, it had been an unusual evening, and John was beginning to worry that maybe he’d been a little too cavalier with Sherlock’s feelings. He worried his bottom lip, trying to decide if he should apologize or just ignore the situation like Sherlock had asked him to.
Every once in a while, Sherlock would use a dropper to add several droplets of liquid to the water bottle fixed to the side of the cage. He would then submit the mice to a variety of tests involving loud noises, various strong-smelling chemicals, and even a rangy-looking cat from the alley that he’d smuggled inside when John wasn’t paying attention.
He finally seemed to catch up to the moment and then was kissing John back, clumsily but enthusiastically. He didn’t seem to understand when to breathe at the right time, and John felt him swallow several times nervously. He pulled back to regard Sherlock’s expression again.
Thinking this without thinking it, John could feel the last vestiges of his irritation with his flatmate dissolve into a warmth that spread throughout his body. He could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him and noticed he was still smiling, but couldn’t be arsed to stop or care. At the moment, John was truly happy to share his life with his impossible, brilliant idiot of a friend.
The closeness sudden;y seemed unbearbly intimate – Sherlock’s gaze was unwavering, nervous, and at the same time as if he’d just made a deuction and was waiting for John;s mind to catch up, but all John’s mind could think was that he would only need to lean in a few more inches –
The look of utter surprise (and a bit of horror) was unlike any John had seen on the detective’s face before.
At times 221b felt downright cozy, John decided, reaching into the cabinet to pull out a mug for tea. His hand closed around something small and furry  -- and warm. And
He never walked in on anything resembling The Incident again, and a part of John  -- a part that that he tried to ignore –  was disappointed. It’s not that he wanted to see his best mate wanking in their living room – or anywhere, for that matter, his mind quickly added – but he wanted
Although it wasn’t a question and his voice, while quiet, was even and calm, John could hear the fear and uncertainty in Sherlock’s words.
John placed a hand on Sherlock’s back to steady him as he applied antiseptic, noticing how the man’s muscles contracted and stiffened under his fingertips. The tap-tap-tapping of the keyboard ceased for just a moment.
After taking several deep breaths and conjuring up the most gruesome images he could imagine from their previous cases, John felt in control enough to turn back around. He made his expression very neutral and set about inspecting the closest body.
Sherlock read every intention in John’s expression as easily as if he were a roadside billboard. They locked eyes for a beat.
John studied the beautiful man’s face before him. The vulnerability obvious in his searching eyes and the tense line of his mouth made John’s heart clench.
“You alright? I’m not hurting you?” John murmured, pausing briefly to try and read his friend’s expression.
Sherlock’s expression wavered as John took another step closer. He could feel the taller man watching him from his peripherals the way a cornered dog eyes a threat.
The moment was so intense (and pleasant) that he couldn’t help but breathe a quiet, involuntary puff of laughter, which instantly raised a swatch of gooseflesh on his patient’s exposed skin before him. He hadn’t relized he was leaning quite so close. The keyboard tapping faltered again.
I worry about.” John realized how this sounded only as it left his mouth, but he chose to ignore it. He stepped purposely into the dark haired man’s personal space for the second time that evening. “Let me see.”
“Am I…right?” he asked, pulling away slightly. “Is this okay?” He tried to sound genuinely concerned (he was) and not like he was too far gone (he was, also).
Sherlock no longer looked impassive, was no longer frowning slightly. His eyes were wide, nervous, practically fearful.
John flipped on the telly, still smiling. These moments with Sherlock were like small but precious, polished little gems. People wondered (and he sometimes wondered too) how he lived with and spent so much time with Sherlock. The man could be acerbic, dismissive, self-absorbed, and downright rude.
John’s eyebrows jumped towards his hairline. “You want me to – I mean, er, yeah...” He stood. “Right.”
John froze in place, but his eyes darted from Sherlock’s flushed expression – to the couch  -- to the pillow  -- and finally to the smallest fluttering of movement, which appeared to be a scrap of paper settling to the ground between the two men.
am not the one in the wrong here. You can’t have mice running around out flat, Sherlock. What would Mrs. Hudson say?”
That was clearly the wrong thing to say, because it caused him to relapse into a fit of giggles that he hopelessly tried to hide as a coughing fit.
There was a beat of silence and then they both burst into laughter. John couldn’t come up for air for what felt like hours.
Sherlock cried out and his hands scrambled for purchase across John’s back. John worked them together, his hand growing slick. Sherlock was breathing too raggedly to be able to kiss him back now, and John watched Sherlock watch John’s hand pump between them.
Accurate, but a bit of a surprise that Sherlock had considered that. It was probably the closest to an apology John was going to get. And he
They lived together, after all. It wasn’t that weird to occasionally glimpse some embarrassing behavior every now and then between someone you shared a home with. Okay, in this case, it
Someone in the flat made a rather unmanly sound and before John knew what was happening, a small white mouse had leaped from his hand onto the counter. It scurried towards a plate of biscuits Mrs. Hudson had brought up the evening before.
He slumped forward on top of the other man, dimly aware that neither had properly gotten their trousers off and their legs were hopelessly tangled. And sticky.
The case involving the missing businessman was quickly becoming one of John’s least favorite cases. One evening Sherlock returned to the flat stinking of sickly sweet opium. Rationally, John knew that Sherlock was not using drugs. But the smell provoked a strange visceral response in him and images of Sherlock with a needle in his arm jumped to mind, unbidden, causing an irrational burst of anger and adrenaline to course through him. Before he knew it he was on his feet.
Amidst the disgust, John couldn’t help but feel a little irritated by the creature’s utter lack of fear of him. He grabbed an oven glove out of the drawer and held it threateningly over the intruder.
He strode quickly but without direction, letting the rhythm of his strides bring his body back under control.
Sherlock rattled off several things he had gleaned from his visit to the opium dealer’s house. Several minutes later a steaming mug was settled on the table beside John, who had set down his book again and was letting the facts of the case wash over him. As so often happened in their relationship, John had to simply trust the the wave of information Sherlock sent his way would be eventually picked over, distilled, and rearranged into a cohesive narrative.
