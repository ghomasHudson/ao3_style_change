Mrs. Hudson brought over the blasted dish. "Why, this looks delicious! And the smell, too," said mum. "Thank you, Martha. You should join us, if you are not too busy."
Soon, he could hear a loud chatter with heavy footsteps. He could see a crowd of students pouring from the stairs on the right side of the lab door, and just like Sherlock has told him, many of them were in semi-formal jackets.
"You and I both know that they do not care about a couple of deaths. Not when they don't affect their precious positions." Sherlock said with a sneer.
"Thank you," she purred, looking up at John through her lashes. She was deliberately trying to look pliant and submissive. It worked.
He locked his gaze into John's, and John spent a moment pondering what he should do as he gazed back. If he noticed the almost-iridescent colour of Sherlock's eyes, he ignored it.
"John, really? I just dug out from Sherlock's mind and narrated all that you wanted to know about Sherlock! What he found so fascinating about you when you consider yourself so ordinary, why did he never tell you that he was alive, and why the fuck was he still around you when you feel terribly guilty about beating Sherlock at the morgue?"
England was famous for its feeble rain, except for days like this when it decides that a fucking squall was acceptable in central London.
Sherlock has heard enough. He tore his glance away, signaling that he's done with their talk. His parents regarded him for a while before going back to their chat, and they looked over at him more frequently than before. Sherlock ignored them all. Everything suddenly became so much more tasteless than it was already before. He mechanically chewed the potato cubes as he stared blankly at the pattern on the table. He could almost feel the body weight, the heat, and the friendly yet alert eyes of the stranger from that very morning. Not a stranger, apparently. John Watson, doing the impossible job of dating Mycroft Holmes.
Sherlock tumbled down the stairs. He was going straight for tea. As he adjusted his skewed dressing gown over his pjs, however, he could hear a muffled clinking sound coming from the kitchen. Sherlock stopped on his feet, swiftly turned on his senses, however sleepy they were, and concentrated on the sound:
Mycroft's paramour, or something boring like that. The small blond who had seemingly enjoyed their little talk in the rain (
"A soldier with a marksman's ability who kills with a principle and also heals. Really, Sherlock, with the way you are, you couldn't really help yourself falling in love with him then and there."
He decided to call Mike eventually. The signal went on, and it went to voicemail. Of course. John huffed in frustration and called Irene. He was instantly greeted with a sensual voice of "I'm busy. I'll call you if you're worth it," which was the voice she'd recorded for her answering machine. John punched Molly's number. She answered, but said that she was stuck in her lab with a bunch of eyeballs.
After sitting down with his cup, he watched curiously around, looking for Sherlock. He wasn't there. Probably taking a bit longer, then. John sipped on his cup, and wondered mindlessly about what was going on. Why would someone suddenly follow him and Sherlock? Because John has done nothing extraordinary in his life, it must've had to do with Sherlock, that was for sure.
Massaging her temple for the imminent headache, she picked up her phone from her lap. Really, there was only one thing she could do.
. Oh. But here's another twist. You do love your contradictions. Your paradox. He kills with a firm moral principle."
John was making tea, Irene was on her phone and Bill was watching the telly. It was one of those rare evenings where all three stayed in after dinner.
To pick someone like that off the street would take time. And Sherlock didn't have much time. The corpse was decomposing every second he took. Lestrade has promised him two hours, and insisted that he had to send the body off to the morgue after that. A corpse too far in its decomposing state wouldn't be too much useful for Sherlock as well. He needed to see, he needed to observe everything before the idiots at NSY erased everything significant from the scene by removing the body with their intrusive, idiotic hands.
Sherlock poured himself a cup, put two spoonfuls of honey, and turned around. He leaned against the counter and took the cup near to his lips. He always indulged in the smell before he drank his tea, and today was no exception.
"Left wing, tall and spacious, and ooh. Isn't this delicious. The first room on the ground floor, what can I see here?" She said, closing her eyes, her face expression looking like she's just tasted something exquisite. "The first time you two met. How romantic!"
"And then at Angelo's. You didn't correct Angelo's words because you did think 'date' was something where two people who like each other go out and have fun. And you already liked John, so no problem. But then, you thought he might be interested in you sexually, and you panic once again. Because as you've told yourself repeatedly since Redbeard, you don't do sentiment. And - oh, oh - also because you were, and are, a virgin."
"Because his date is coming with him this Christmas and we don't want your brother to be embarrassed in front of him," answered his father.
Sherlock leaned back into the backseat of the car with a sigh. It would've been so much better if he could chase down the coordinates himself. Why wouldn't just everyone leave him ALONE? He closed his eyes, blamed Sherrinford, blamed his parents, blamed the stupid driver and the two agents guarding the door as if they aren't completely wasting their time and energy trying to be promoted at MI6 by impressing his brother - which won't happen, because they already failed to catch Sherlock at the university campus - and imagined what he could've done, if he was free on the street. He would chase the murderer faster than anyone in the Yard, and-
, bring anyone over, but now it seems like that is almost the only available option left. It still baffles me why they would bring a guest, let alone why they are here and not in London, when it's nothing close to their summer holidays. But then again, the British government does not always work on schedule."
John sighed. Seventeen, that wasn't too bad. As much as John was barely an adult, Sherlock was barely a minor.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. If Mycroft feels comfortable about it? If it pertained to his work at the government, it wouldn't be a matter for Mycroft to feel comfortable about or not, because it's not about his comfort, but rather about the matter's confidentiality itself. It didn't make sense that someone so young and so obviously a student to be involved in high-risk, confidential government affair as well. The only possible option left was that this had to do with Mycroft's personal life.
John looked so harmless. Small and kind-looking blue eyes. Even his hair was the opposite of aggressiveness - fair, light, blond and airy.
He started eating, and the space was soon filled with the sound of silverware clinking against china.
John made his posture straight, stretching out, making sure that his biceps and pectorals - they weren't not impressive, thank you very much - were emphasized as he did. His hair was slightly wet, and a drop of water took this moment to be its time to descend upon John's torso, sliding down on John's left nipple.
free time, which is the excuse he can use for not studying. It was the polite thing to do, too, of course. Sherlock has walked all the way here just for John.
Sherlock gave Lestrade rapid instructions as to where to look for the (obviously) missing suitcase, and with promises that they will let Sherlock know as soon as they find the case, the two of them were back on the streets, outside the police tape and away from the scornful looks of the constables.
Mrs. Hudson knocked on the open door of 221B. Sherlock looked up from the microscope, and in a matter of seconds, deduced that the client couldn't be more than a four. Tedious. A schoolteacher whose life problems couldn't be possibly anything more than her husband's (presumed) affair. And it wasn't even real. Her husband wasn't that much of a risk-taker.
That made Irene put her phone down. "Why, yes." John ignored her voice going down a key. "Your rich, old man."
"Did he ever fuck you in that Rolls-Royce that he always pick you up with? Does he roll up the partition, or show you off to his driver?"
What was happening to him, he had no idea. For the first time since he'd been forcefully seated in the car, Sherlock's brain stayed quiet, overwhelmed in anticipation and fear of the unknown change that has been made within himself, his own body betraying himself so furtively and stealthily, utterly unbeknownst to him.
"John," he started, wearing them. It looked out of place with how he carried himself now - a popular and brainless uni jock - and John still couldn't figure out what was going on.
John jumped between buildings, ran up the fire escape, laughing, giddy, shouting "Unbelievable!" and "No way!" but following anyways, tripped over, ran into dead ends, felt dizzy when he looked down, until Sherlock finally stopped.
He could feel through the rope that Sherlock was putting his own weight down on the other side. Step by step, John climbed. To not slip against the slippery concrete wall with only the help of a rope was a challenging thing. He was very close to slipping and left dangling on the rope - that was the worst case scenario, because Sherlock won't be able to lift him up and eventually, John will have to crash into the dirty concrete floor - but he didn't, and finally, he could set his foot on the windowsill that looked like it hasn't been cleaned for a decade.
The car stopped at a red light. The two agents guarding him went rigid, trying to offset any attempt at an escape. The driver cast an uneasy glance at Sherlock through his rearview mirror, at which Sherlock looked straight back.
At one stroke, he would step into the light, face the stranger, and take the stranger's throat in his left hand and shove the deer into the stomach with his right. He'll have to do all of it in a single, fluid motion. Throat and shove. Throat and shove. It was hardly anything difficult. The stranger didn't even know there was someone in the shadows, waiting for them. Sherlock had the upper hand. The sound of his own heart beat loudly in Sherlock's ear. Thump, thump, thump, thump.
After rattling so, Sherlock grabbed John's backpack out of his grasp and slung it over his right shoulder.
"What- oh, of course. Of course." His practice was cancelled because the rain was forecasted. Of course Sherlock knows it before he did.
Sherlock scoffed. "Look at the state of that ventilator. It's clean and yet old. Everything else is severely undermanaged except for that one. Why? Because it is legally required to maintain laboratory ventilators in a certain state. That window is most likely connected to an Applied Physics lab. I can't ask for a better place to find stuff for a break-in than a laboratory."
"Sherlock, what did I say about guilting people for your convenience?" Mummy asked, her voice stern.
"Sherlock!" John yelled, running towards the two men, but they pushed John out of their way with ease and concentrated on putting Sherlock inside their car. When John clambered back up as quick as he could, the car was already gone, without a trace.
Sherlock waved his hand, trying to look dismissive. It failed, because his eyes were still on his feet. "Please. Child's play." He took what looked like a lockpick from his coat pocket and held it in the air, giving a second for John to take a look.
"Well then. Aren't you going to deduce why I'm here?" The woman asked in a condescending tone. It was so out of character, at least according to what Sherlock has deduced.
"Yes, yes. But you also can't leave him. The flight where you thought you could never see John, ever again? You were planning to commit suicide. To commit overdose."
Then there was the exam. Oh, the exam. It was impossible. John's two-hour studying at the library did almost nothing. The only consolation was Molly venting with him after class, about how unfair the professor was with that exam - he never really talked much with her before, and now he felt like he'd made a friend.
"But we do know that he's quite wonderful," said mummy, her eyes glistening. "He's kept Mycroft busy for more than two months, and that is a first."
This is officially the worst day in his life, thought John to himself. Maybe it was childish to say that, maybe there were worse thing that has happened to him in his life, but fuck rationality. John was soaked from head to toe with coffee on his new shirt and his ridiculously expensive textbooks were now slowly turning into a wet piece of rag. He hurriedly ran towards a near building to avoid the rain. As he stood near the entrance with some other students who gaped at the heavy rain together with him, he wondered what he should do. He pondered calling someone. Mike? Irene? Molly? Bill? He thought of calling Mycroft, maybe.
"That settles it, then." Sherlock opened his ridiculously big umbrella, which opened with a 'pop,' and sprinkled raindrops everywhere. "Come along. I'll share with you."
"Oh pish posh, Sherlock. I'm immortal. I can hear your mind. Did you really think I didn't notice the text you sent John? And did you really think I can't hide John from you when all you were relying on was to hear his
The boy was watching him with hopeful eyes. Those innocent eyes were likely one of the very few things that give the boy's true age away, thought John.
Sherlock rattled away. "You're not a complete idiot, quick on your feet, athletic, and have medical knowledge. You live in central London, close enough to NSY and the crime scene. Need I say more?"
Sherlock's mind jerked. No one, not Mycroft, not Moriarty, not even Eurus could read his mind like this.
John hastily finished whatever was left on his plate, washed it, made Bill promise that he will change the lightbulb after eating, made Irene promise that she will replace the chair tomorrow - she said she will accomplish the task, and told John not to question her methods. John didn't want to know more. - and flew to his bedroom. He knew from the buzzing of his phone that Sherlock has texted him quite a few after what he's last checked. He sat down on his bed and checked his phone.
The number one rule for combat was to do everything before the other expected it. Sherlock stood near the kitchen entrance, making sure that he hid in the shadows and was not being seen. He never had a full-on combat before, but he didn't need a first-hand experience to excel at something. He wasn't an idiot. If one calculates every single thing perfectly inside one's mind, one doesn't need
excuse of keeping me safe, the more responsible you will be for the murders that could've been prevented if only you saw reason."
"But you also had the Holmes brain with you, and it made you constantly mock your own heart. You wanted to be a machine, that's what you'd say, but deep in your heart, you wanted to be a pirate. Your brain sneered at stuff like dancing, but your body loved it. You lived off the high on solving crimes, but at the same time, you knew that the criminals were wrong to inflict harm on the innocent. Contrary to what Sergeant Donovan would say, you'll never be the reason they find a body, because no matter how you aspire to be, no matter how much your Holmesean brain tells you to be, you can never be evil."
John didn't catch all of it, but what John could hear, it was ridiculous. The accent was like he'd learned it from a book or something. And the content of it was equally ridiculous. He must be thinking of the stereotypical, media-portrayed university jocks that hit the club 24/7 because they don't have something better to do.
Sherlock smirked, and John had to let out a laugh in disbelief, because what he's said was very much in Sherlock's character right now. It was exactly what cheesy twenty-somethings thinking themselves as cool would say.
They had spent the night together; after a luxurious dinner like usual, Mycroft has taken John to his flat and the two of them watched
It has been only two years since Mycroft has officially took his way into the area of national affairs. Unofficially, it has been longer, of course, but he could never give anyone the advantage of underestimating his work that he's done when he was still at Oxford, only for his status of a student. Two years weren't a long time, and Mycroft was, no matter how unreal it was to say it, only a man. He was still at the stage of building connections and apprehending the whole complicated cobweb that was the British government.
Sherlock didn't expect the mystery man to understand what he was talking about, but he certainly didn't expect what the man did right after: he was laughing. Giggling. Shaking-his-head and looking-up-at-the-ceiling kind of giggling.
The cops. How adorable. Unwittingly, a whiff of laughter escaped Sherlock's mouth. This surprised the agent on his right, although he thought he didn't show; but of course he noticed. Sherlock ignored it.
Seconds passed, and Sherlock stood back up, taking his hand off and distancing himself from John. The place where his hands were on John's face felt suddenly empty.
The food was indeed delicious. Never did John know that there was another level to a simple breakfast fry-up. Toast was crisp on the crust and soft on the inside, sausage was juicy and meaty, and his fried egg was cooked just the right amount so that John could spread it all on his toast with his beans. Delicious.
Sherrinford was, according to himself and regrettably to Mycroft as well, the smartest of the three Holmes brothers. He was the oldest of them all, too. With seven more years on his back and a even bigger brain in his head, Sherrinford was already at the pinnacle of the British government. Behind closed doors and hushed whispers, he was the hidden figure that had the most powerful authorities at his very disposal; The PM, for example, was nothing but for a publicity stunt that Sherrinford could move around like he moved his pawns on his chess board. He wouldn't do anything bad, of course, not because he couldn't, but because of the sense of patriotism that he and Mycroft (inexplicably) shared.
"Yes!" Sherlock exclaimed, jumping in excitement. "Yes, I'll do that. Now come along, John!" He yelled, and him and his dramatic coat swished outside the room. Chuckling to himself, John ran after the mad boy genius.
"You really should hone your observation skills," Sherlock answered, instead, a smirk on his face. "And, you should watch the forecast before leaving. Your rugby coach does."
An amused look passed though her face. "Worried from the instant I mention John Watson. How transparent." She paused, frowning slightly, as if trying to pick the right words.
Mrs. Holmes sighed and tilted her head back. Sherlock was always the difficult one. Sherrinford and Mycroft, they practically raised themselves. Ever since they were little, she knew that her children were too smart, too clever, too extraordinary for anyone else on the planet. It was sheer luck that two of them craved power, authority, and self-preservation; she was never worried about them when they started school, when they went off to universities, and when they started their careers. They would make sure that they themselves were okay.
John took his leg back, making sure he didn't make any contact. Mycroft didn't comment on it, but John could see that he was trying to figure out what John was doing.
Sharon grinned so widely, that although it didn't reach her eyes not yet, she looked almost a little bit happy and a little less terrifying.
"I know your brother seeing someone is quite out of the ordinary. I know. I thought you wouldn't care much, but-"
"It doesn't matter." Sherlock retorted. He sounded a bit petulant. "I only need to fool those who think this is how you talk."
She nodded enthusiastically. "Yes. Dr. John Watson. Ah-ah. Don't try to deny it. I can hear your mind, remember? You don't believe me yet? Aren't you stubborn. Hmm. Let's see... what if I tell you that I know you have a John Wing in your mind palace?"
Sherlock shook his head. "No, stop. I'll deduce it. You're in your early twenties, and you study anatomy, possibly a med student, or a veterinary school, but I think medical school is more likely. You like tea with milk. You just drunk tea with milk here, in our kitchen. Left handed. You play rugby, and you play it well. You are very quick on your feet, especially with your body, but it doesn't seem like you learned it from training. You learned it through experience. It's not likely that someone like you had to go through heavy bullying, though. So it must be something else. Abusive father? A-hah. Now, what is a young, sporty medical student with an abusive father doing in my kitchen on a Saturday morning, helping themselves with tea?"
She was worried. So, so, worried. Sherlock talks about her worries as if they were the most unnecessary, irrational thing ever. But she knew that it was justified. She knew that her youngest child, no matter how old, was still the same boy who was anxious to touch aconite without gloves, deep down. To put him next to murderers was the last thing she ever wanted to do. Sherlock trying to guilt her by mentioning preventable murders did nothing; she couldn't care less about them if it meant to keeping her son safe.
If that was how he was going to play this, then sure, thought John. He was confident in his skin. He could have breakfast almost naked.
That made Sherlock glance up. "John, you're studying medicine. Surely you must know that the average age and BM ratio of those likely to suffer cardiac arrest at surprising incidents are nowhere close to what you are-"
This afternoon, while he was buried in his pile of experiments, he had a message from DI Lestrade. A new suicide (
And among his busy days of barreling his way into the heart of Great Britain were the days when he resented his older brother Sherrinford.
"I will be the one who'll get hurt," said John. "He's going to be fine. He's all controlled and immaculate."
"A boy in my school suddenly died, and many thought it was an accident, but I was so convinced that he was killed. He was a swimmer, a very skilled one, and one day, he turned up dead in the pool. Many thought it was just drowning. It didn't make sense, because he was a good swimmer, and he very annoyingly reminded everyone of it. Naturally, I noticed that his shoes was missing."
He remembered where he'd last put his handgun. It was in the salad drawer. He also remembered that he had his phone in his left pocket of his trousers. If he moved fast enough, he'll be able to text John with his left hand. Mycroft would bring in more reinforcements, but he'd much prefer John for several reasons. In the meanwhile, he had to figure out who this person was.
Sharon frowned. "It's too loud, your head. You really do think fast for a human, don't you? It must be exhausting for your human body to maintain. I was getting used to Sharon's moronic monologues in her head, you know. And you're like a supercomputer, compared to her."
suicide, murder, Sherlock corrected him) had just been discovered, he'd said, and that he wanted Sherlock to take a look at it. He begrudgingly admitted Sherlock's theory of the serial suicides actually being serial murders because in this case, there was a note, and it hardly looked like a note left by someone who was going to kill herself.
Maybe he could've had John follow him too, because he'd like it, Sherlock knew, and because Sherlock appreciated John's company. John liked it, liked the chase, the danger, the thrill, and he seemingly enjoyed being with Sherlock, too, no matter how improbable that was to be true. He liked what Sherlock did and said things like "amazing," or "brilliant," or "fantastic," (he'd said them four, three, and one time, respectively, during their whole encounter since Musgrave) and he had this look on his face when he watched Sherlock as if he was marveling at what Sherlock was capable of doing - the look of pure amazement, adoration... And John's excitement at chasing down an actual criminal will be tangible through his expressive face and body movements and it would send electrifying sensations down Sherlock's spine... John will get all wide-eyed, giddy, giggling, breathless, looking up at Sherlock with that distinct fondness of which John has only allowed glimpses to Sherlock, and when he acknowledges himself, he might lick his bottom lip sheepishly, because he showed his heart too much...
A strange sense of fondness swept through Sherlock's gut as he watched the blue eyes crinkle with a smile.
"According to this Facebook page, we have a group of students bored enough to escape their class in ten minutes. They will be crossing the hallway from the right in any minute. Ten to eleven students, and several of them graduated from boarding schools. They're likely to wear suits. Great for you to join in. Don't talk to them, don't act like you are doing anything that involves them. Just walk with them, not too far away, and remember what I told you about your walks. Try to imitate them if you can. As soon as you're out, follow them until they start realizing that you're in the pack. Leave them and head onto the café near the Chemistry department. I will meet you there."
would know, not really, unless I tell them, which will be never. She doesn't show it. Never. The only people who know it in the world are her girlfriend, herself, and I. My mum don't have a clue and she sees Harry almost every day. And you just... you just figured it out by just taking one look at my phone."
It turned out that surprisingly, despite the staggering evidence that there must be a pink suitcase, there wasn't one.
"I mean. You can come up for tea, if you'd like? Our flat's nothing fancy, but you can dry your fancy trousers until the rain stops."
John caught the tall stick of blackness disappear behind the Physics building. As far as John knew, that place had nothing but trees and weed that grew up to your knees.
Oh, God. He was going to fall in love with Mycroft and he was going to regret it, because he'd never be satisfied with what they had now if he was
It was child's play to escape his deserted parents' house, of course, but what would he do about the Lestrade part? He could show up without a guardian, barge his way in and dazzle Lestrade until he forgets his stupid caveat. But there was the danger of Lestrade taking notice and not agreeing to Sherlock's future participating in the case, which Sherlock might need to solve the case. Serial killers rarely made a mistake easy enough for Sherlock to solve in one sitting, he needed to be included in the follow-up measures, the full-on investigation. Just distracting Lestrade wouldn't work. He had to bring someone.
Nobody responded, and silence continued. Sherlock didn't really expect much else from his brothers' minions, but it was worth a try.
Thinking of the burgundy gravy as blood wasn't enough to sate him anymore. He viciously stabbed the carrot, instead.
"It's fine. You wishing to go to Cambridge is enough of an answer. You can decide whatever you want to do as you study."
Sherlock stopped, effectively stopping John too. Sherlock had his whole body turned towards John, he noticed.
John nodded. The back of his blond head glistened under the sunlight that seeped through the kitchen window.
"Turn the car around this instant. All of you will be responsible for four new murders in the next month if you don't." Sherlock announced to the rest of the car.
It was astonishing, how he could portray himself as someone completely different in a matter of seconds.
But of course, the luxury of seeing who was possibly one of the most dangerous men in London, completely undone, could last only for a couple of seconds. After the peak of orgasm, Mycroft was back to his detached, controlled self; cleaning himself and John up, not callously but not with affection, either, and then going to sleep without the cuddles and sweet-nothings that came in the afterglow of sex for most people. John was a bit hurt about it at first, but now he was okay with it. He understood Mycroft's boundaries, and he found no difficulty respecting them. So he slept, wordlessly, next to Mycroft's warm body. He wasn't kicked out of the bed after sex, at least.
Halfway through his meal, John adjusted his seat, and his bare knees brushed against Mycroft's. The island was a bit small for two people, after all.
"Oh, piss off." The stranger grinned, meeting Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock grinned back. "Mycroft told me about you, but he never mentioned the scrummage bit."
John glared at Sherlock's profile, and stopped when he realized that it could hurt his neck if he kept it on. Damn it!
Although John grumbled, he followed Sherlock's instructions, and after a while, Sherlock made an approving noise.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open when he realized that he was straining against his trousers. He looked down and immediately observed a bulge in his groin.
First Class marks. Numerous awards. Socially respectable jobs with high salary. Oh, Sherlock couldn't be more bored.
John, startled, fumbled with his phone and almost dropped it. Sherlock caught it swiftly. He then proceeded to examine it.
After a generous wash, he dried himself off and went out of the shower. He was not bothering to cover himself up.
Sherlock sat on the yellow bench between lockers. He was looking less blushing virgin and more like what John remembered of him in the rain.
Sherlock glimpsed at the pouring rain. "I think I should be asking you that, John. What are you going to do? You obviously have been victimized by the untimely rain. Do you wish to wait until it stops? Calling someone clearly hasn't worked."
He hummed noncommittally and glanced outside his window instead of agreeing. At this perfectly usual set of behavior, his mother turned her body back towards her front and chatted on.
It muddled his brain, his mind, and the memories of John's face and body were fuzzy and romanticized and heavily emphasized in certain areas in his otherwise clear mind's eye.
John blinked several times at this. He went over her words in his head, and found out that it was, indeed, true. He's believed that he was fully satisfied with keeping boundaries with Mycroft, but that was only because he thought of it as something casual, something that will break off sooner or later. He has been unconsciously building a barrier for himself not to get hurt once the time comes.
Sherlock did not dare to make a sound. Everything in his head was going full speed, trying to make sense of this woman.
The windows to his Rolls-Royce was a one-way vision glass; he could see everyone outside the car, but it didn't work the other way around.
Sherlock looked so happy at this that any remains of uncertainty in John's mind about following Sherlock vanished altogether.
"Oh God!" Sherlock exclaimed, exasperated. "Will you please leave me ALONE!" He bellowed at the car.
After they both orgasmed, John went into the shower to clean himself up. When he came back, he found Mycroft leaning against the headboard with a particular, inscrutable face.
, within what felt like a millisecond, hit on Sherlock's wrist, hard, making him drop the deer instantly in pain, and ducked so that Sherlock's left hand on his throat would grab nothing but air. The sound of marble crashing into the granite floor wrung deeply between the two. Sherlock was then pushed against the fridge, the stranger's body pushing him with all his weight, and his arms were firmly grasped by the elbow, preventing him from using his lower arm and hands in any way.
All of that was spoken rapidly and nonchalantly, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. It left John in a awe, and he had to actively tore his gaze away from the teenager's face not to come off as creepy. He said, eventually, after a beat:
He stepped into the light, and at the face of a surprised-looking blond young man, he took his throat and then-
"... nice young man, finally we get to meet him. Martha's staying with us, so she'll help us with the turkey. Oh, we have to get the tree. Do the Mcclarggens still sell their blue spruce? ..."
Sherlock threw himself over the chaise longue in frustration. His mother did not bat a lash. She continued reading as if there wasn't her nearly grown-up son huffing and puffing next to her.
But Sherlock might have some place to go, so maybe not. As the two of them approached the door to his flat's building, John decided to just ask.
"Oh, God," said the blond, as his laughter subsided. "What- What just happened? You- is that a deer?" He pointed at the ornament on the floor. Fortunately, it wasn't broken.
"I said no," Sherlock snarled. "Why do you need me to say it when you can just dig in like you've been doing for the past five minutes?"
The crowd began to wane down as they started to dissipate, going by their ways, and as John sensed the one standing on his right side-eyeing him in confusion, he left the group and walked across the lawn. The chemistry building wasn't too far off.
Mycroft followed his path because it was only natural. He craved power and he loved Britain. There really was no other choice.
Irene chuckled. "Oh, John. You don't run away from danger. You run towards it. When will you learn that about yourself?"
"Yes. In his locker, there was a full set of outfit of his, but no shoes. I made a scene. The police were a bunch of idiots, and they ignored me when I told the they had to find the shoes. But why would there be everything else except his shoes? There were everything, including the little tiny scraps of paper he'd had unbeknownst to himself after having gum. Then why wouldn't there be his shoes? He wouldn't have just waddled into school that morning,
She was grinning widely with her eyes glistening under the bright incandescent light. It wasn't a content grin. It was... maniac.
Sherlock didn't know what to think of it. It showed John's character as a ... what? Caretaker? Team player? Thrill-seeker?
John. Sherlock mechanically answered the text with the relevant details, informing John of the progress and the prospect of taking the culprit into custody soon.
"... Her coat - it's slightly damp, she's been in heavy rain the last few hours - no rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp too. She's turned it up against the wind. She's got an umbrella in her pocket but it's dry and unused. Not just wind, strong wind -too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried. So - where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time? Cardiff. She travelled from Cardiff today intending to stay in London one night from the size of her suitcase."
He did look like a jock, however clichéd and stereotypical. His posture and the placement of the jacket somehow made him look bigger and muscular; it filled exactly the right places to deceive the eyes.
Mycroft could watch every corner of Mary's face twist at this, and the face was one of the very few images that he knew for sure that he could never delete from his mind.
That was true. "But you know people," said John. "You just know their psychology and stuff. You're like a psychic."
"Of course not." Mycroft took a bite of his sausage. "I have a chef who comes in. You'll find the taste excellent."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "Pirates are a perfectly viable career choice, mother. It is a common mistake to believe that all ocean surfaces are under the control of the government. It is not, I assure you."
Sherlock closed the window. The lab immediately became dark, with the little bit of sunlight seeping through. He threw away his rope, and took out his phone. The light from the phone made Sherlock's cheekbone inhumanely sharper; he looked like an alien.
"I'm here to take care of that hollowness inside you. The loneliness that devours you every time John can't see you."
"...you can figure it out, yourself. You're practically inside my head already," snapped Sherlock. He opened his eyes and glared at the uninvited visitor.
John could clearly see the boy's cheek blushing, which made the condescending comments lose its bite. Completely.
The room was dark with only one tableside lamp on, and John could remember watching Mycroft's face while hearing this. Mycroft looked impassive, nonchalant, and perfectly like his usual self. He was observing John's face with the air of can't-be-bothered-ness, with no single sign of vulnerability apparent.
"And then there's John, who gets so high on adrenaline during that chase that he forgets his cane. Who enjoys the crime-solving, just like you. Who even kills, brutally murders a civilian without a single tremor. But all of that with a firm moral principle holding his posture straight, like a soldier does. That faith, that firm principle in morality. That loyalty he shows towards you against Mycroft and the cabbie. The look of being appalled at the possibility of you being a drug addict. He's dangerous and he likes danger, but he is, at the same time, so grounded in his own morality like a soldier who blindly follows their commander."
. The hiding and being chased, climbing walls, disguising and jumping around roofs and fire escapes. Oh, he felt so
Nobody, not even the best damn cartographer of Great Britain would've known that there were such an intricate ways to travel around London via roofs. John was sure of it.
Musgrave was quiet, almost always, but especially on Saturday mornings. On Saturday morning, the house was mostly empty save Sherlock, because mummy and father went shopping on their car and Mrs. Hudson did not come in until noon. The sound of birds chirping and wind swooshing through trees filled the house, compensating the typical chilliness of countryside mornings. Serene.
Sherrinford has visited his office about an hour ago. And in that short period of time, he's silently judged, ridiculed, and incapacitated what Mycroft's been doing for the past month with the MI6. Mycroft couldn't be mad at him, of course, because Sherrinford was, as always, right. Mycroft has seen ten steps ahead; Sherrinford has seen twenty. Nobody else could even see one or two, he knew, but that was not the matter. From when he was young, he knew that nobody else other than the three of them actually mattered. They were the three humans living in the world of goldfish. And this time, like most of the times, Mycroft has lost to his brother. Again.
A little precariously, Sherlock succeeded in opening the window with one leg on John's shoulder and the other on the pipe. It creaked open. Taking a look inside, he jumped in.
The dining table went back to mindless chatter between the married couple. Sherlock picked at his food, tried some of it when mummy pleaded him to, and passed his time. It seemed like the conversation he dreaded the most this evening has passed without much problem. His parents were always keen on the education and stable occupations of their children, and were thrilled when they found out the two elder sons were taking high positions in the British government. Sherlock was the oddball of the family: he didn't have good grades because he never cared for them, he wasn't interested in something stable like the government
"Clever! Very clever." Her laughter, despite how loud and exaggerated it was, somehow did not reach her eyes.
But spending Christmas break with his family - that was a bit of a jump, John thought, because although the sex was fantastic, he never had the idea of Mycroft wanting anything more than just sex, and so he had adjusted himself to the idea of having a rich, smart sexual partner that took care of everything.
"The thing that you did back at your home," John started, remembering that day. He couldn't believe that it has already been more than a week. It felt like yesterday, seeing Sherlock right in front of him. "The... um, 'deductions,' you called it? Right. Those. They were impressive, too. But I guess I thought Harry's drinking was something that
So it was sentimental. That still didn't make sense. Why would she scratch the name 'Rachel' at the wooden floor by her dying breath, and leave her phone with the murderer? Did the murderer deliberately took the phone? That didn't happen before, so highly unlikely.
. But would the idiots that call themselves the police listen? No. So I had to make my own investigation, and follow a man who could have a motive to kill the swimmer. Unfortunately, I was noticed, he phoned the police, and I got a restraining order."
"Oh my god," John groaned. He almost put his two hands up in the air, but realized that it could compromise his precarious towel placement, and stopped. "You could've given me a heart attack."
." She coaxed. "I just know what people like, and- well. I guess you are right. I do know people. They are my expertise."
And they arrived right in front of the door. John quickly fished for his key in his pocket, opened it, and stepped inside, leaving the door open and Sherlock still standing outside. The younger man looked hesitant. John smiled. "Yeah?" John asked again. "I really don't mind if you've got someplace to be."
He didn't even worry about the young genius taking the right path, and was, therefore, not surprised to see a familiar street appear in front of him some minutes later.
, and mummy was giddy with the news she'd collected from her morning shopping. If that wasn't enough, father has just put his brown notebook on the sitting room table, which meant only one thing: he wanted to talk about university with Sherlock over dinner. Everything was practically putting Sherlock off, and all he wanted to do was to shut himself up in his room and go back to his experiment.
He took the makeshift rope in hand. It felt strong. The knots were in ways that John had never seen before. Probably one of those fishermen ropes or something. He made sure that both of his hands were tight on it, and started stepping onto the wall, putting his whole weight against the wall and the rope.
of vulnerability, when he orgasmed. It looked like he had allowed himself a miniscule moment of letting himself go completely, if only for that instant. That look on his almost always impassive and judgmental face was so alien to what John's known of Mycroft. To see it, to dig it out of him, it was addicting. John prided himself to be the one who could bring that side of Mycroft.
Sherlock watched John's sagged shoulders and blond-grey top of his head as he realized that - he couldn't do that.
"...Schoolteacher. Worried about husband's possible affair but really doesn't care much. Favours the first child just a bit. Likes Danish pastry. Calls cat various names. Likes...to make jumpers."
He despised the looks his competitors have sent him when he officially neutralized the project, as if they were the reason Mycroft had to back off.
The relationship between the two first started when John, unwittingly, made friends with a high-profile assassin that went by the name 'Mary.' The woman had been on Interpol's most wanted list for two years, and CIA's classified list for five. Despite the age difference between the two, they became close, and in the end, John was instrumental in finally taking the elusive criminal into custody. At first, Mycroft suspected heavily about John's involvement with Mary and her incriminating exercises, because Mary and John became too close too fast. One day, they were exchanging names and shaking hands, and the next week, they were found kissing on the doorstep to the hospital that Mary worked.
Sherlock shrugged. "Shot in the dark, really. Your phone, it's expensive, and it has engravings on the back that says Harry Watson. It's not difficult to deduce that this is your gay sister that you'd told me the last time we had... an
"You and father had our abilities assessed. Surely, you can think of me able to take care of myself?"
Seeing John, Sherlock smirked, still in character, and gave him a lazy salute. John didn't have the chance to do anything (because he was so surprised at the hair) before Sherlock took his gaze away and ordered himself a cup.
John had thought about it all afternoon, wondering what he should say. He liked Mycroft. He was nice, tall, smart - well, to be exact, insanely smart, he was a proper genius - and though he was controlling and authoritative, John found it hot. It was very sexy when Mycroft made everything right, instantaneously, with only a few words and facial expressions; John had the chance to see this firsthand when his dinner reservation was somehow cancelled. Yes, it was very attractive. John didn't manage to go through a film that night without touching Mycroft.
"You don't need to worry about something supernatural like this, ever again. We don't come down too often. Once in a thousand human years, maybe. Even less. We don't do this when it's hopeless, and it's really not too often when your level of desperation is unresolved when there's this much hope. Toodles!"
"I have to say, Mycroft never spoke of you," started Sherlock, looking back up. The man was watching him with amused eyes.
Decided. Sherlock knew what he was talking about. How could he not? The brown clipbook in the sitting room said it all. University.
When the two of them were back to what they looked like earlier that day - except for Sherlock's slick hair, it still stayed that way -, Sherlock stuck his back to the wall and watched the road, not leaving the shadows of the narrow alley they were hiding in.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, mummy raised voices of agreement, and father smiled at Mrs. Hudson. Everyone was worrying over him. It was horrible.
"Do you know anything about him?" Unwittingly, his voice came out cross. His mother didn't comment on it if she noticed. She watched Sherlock curiously.
"Yes, and I know what a Holmes can do. But I've never heard Mycroft listing all of his observations at once before, so it's still impressive."
After John put his clothes on (he made sure there wasn't anyone else, this time), he opened the door and found Sherlock waiting for him. Sherlock took one look at John and walked past him to go inside. John followed him in.
Sharon could see that the massive brain of Sherlock Holmes was agreeing with him, despite a part of it screaming,
"The last thing you wanted to see before you died was John's blog about how you two first met. About how he found you fascinating and brilliant."
John thought he was funny. Good. Sherlock then noticed the agent on his left was now incredulously checking his face through the reflection on the side mirror, and then realized that he has been beaming at his phone. Beaming, he was indeed; grinning from ear to ear like an idiot. Ugh. He quickly changed his face to a sulking one.
The Interpol agents were riling her up, part in strategy to make her admit more than they could prove with that strand of hair, and part because they were personally antagonistic against this ordinary-looking woman who'd been ruining their lives for so long. And amongst their attempts was the question of how it feels to lose everything just because of a kiss with a twenty year-old, a nobody.
Several minutes passed. Sherlock was cataloguing various alternative possibilities just in case her phone wasn't an iPhone when the text came in.
Sherlock ignored him again. Instead, he observed their surroundings, nodded to himself a couple of times, and pulled his gloves out of his pocket.
Mycroft broke out of his reminiscing at John's change of posture. He was checking his phone, probably wondering why Mycroft wasn't already there. He didn't receive anything on his phone, though, because John had learned tactfully that Mycroft preferred to initiate contact with John.
The way John stared down at Sherlock in confusion and wariness when he pushed him against the fridge.
"Anyways. I'm immortal, you see. And I live up there," she pointed at the ceiling. "And once in a while, I take a peek down here," she said, gesturing around herself," you know, what you humans call planet Earth. And I really like to take my time, you see. I just like to watch your little minds do the same thing over and over again until you finally leave your feeble bodies. But- hmm. This is where you come in, Sherlock."
The mystery client shrugged. "Anyways. Back to business. So. As you've already guessed, I'm not a human. Not a runaway patient, either. Not your sister, not that idiot who thinks of himself as God - Moriarty, was it? - and most definitely
"Just do as I say, John. I'll explain later. Now stop asking questions and hurry! We're running out of time."
The case was over. Well, at least until the officers found the pink suitcase, their job was done. Or so it seemed like it, at least to John.
was his area. He was mindlessly thinking about the types of coagulation he wanted to try next, when father knocked on the table for his attention.
Mystery man blinked. Sherlock watched his eyelashes, fair and blond and long, reflect the sunlight as he did.
Cambridge. University. Sherlock becoming of legal age to do whatever he pleases. No mother can stop him then.
"Oh, no. Don't worry. I'm not trying to hurt him. I'm trying to help him. And you. Mainly you." Sharon grinned again, showing her teeth this time.
"You know what I mean. Moriarty was interesting because he knew the thrill of the game. Irene Adler, too. But you were always the one with the heart, weren't you. You knew, instinctively, what's right and what's wrong, from when you were very young. Mycroft and Eurus didn't, but you did. That's why you were the weak one. The stupid one."
"I- er, I should change-" John fumbled with his hands, pointing at himself. He just had a towel around his waist. He really wasn't expecting to see anyone in the kitchen.
"I can see why you liked him from the first sight. A doctor, who served in the military. Who heals but also fights. A bundle of contradictions. Your mind-palace John says stuff like: "I'm an army doctor, that means I can break every bone in your body while naming them." Oh, my. Your kink is showing, detective."
Her face became inscrutable. "But sometimes, when one of you get too fussy over something. Too obsessed. Too desperate. Too... too loud. Then it just wouldn't do, all right? It disrupts us too much. It's too loud."
"And before I go, John, the best disguise is to hide in plain sight. Do not attempt anything out of your way to convince the onlooker."
"Right. Right. Of course. Well- yeah. You- I don't know how you got most of it right, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
Sherlock shrugged, and put it back. "It's vomit from a dead woman's body, John. It's hardly anyone's property."
None of them realized anything; the group of students were comprised with friends, acquaintances, and strangers. Nobody cared and nobody knew that there was someone that wasn't from their physics 301 class. John made sure not to look too stiff nor too casual as he merged himself among the pile of suit jackets and posh accents - and like that, he was successfully out of the building in what couldn't be more than a minute.
"He doesn't need a bed," said Irene. "His sugar daddy probably has a lovechair designed only for John."
John blinked several times, shut his mouth that he hadn't realized that was gaping wide until then, and then asked: "Okay. How? How could you
"Here," said Sherlock, fishing John's phone out of his pocket and handing it to him. It looked rather small in Sherlock's hand.
With that, and to John's surprise, Sherlock winked. He then abruptly spun around on his heels, his dramatic coat swishing in the air, and started pacing away, fast.
"Now, don't do that. Let's not waste anymore time, shall we?" She said, as she leaned back in the uncomfortable client-chair and crossed her legs.
Sherlock lock his gaze into the other's, breaking it off seconds later. He glanced downwards. He realized that he still didn't know the man's name.
The door chimed and John could see a tall jock in a rugby jacket, who had his hair completely slicked back, trudge in.
The car was taking a turn, and observing this, Sherlock could deduce that his mother had called Sherrinford instead of Mycroft. It was usually Mycroft's business to take care of Sherlock, but apparently, Mrs. Holmes took this occasion so seriously that she had to call the oldest, sliest, and the overall worst mastermind of the family and not settle for second best.
His father chuckled. "I don't think so. You know how he's like. We can always set him up. Didn't you say Martin's youngest just came back from Turkey?"
She stood up, took her bag, and looked at them, left and right. Sherlock broke the eye contact and faced her. John's eyes were still on Sherlock.
"He's petite, our little John. I know for a fact that his daddy is quite taller. Maybe something that has a 'u' shape that fits his little body in the middle?"
Sherlock pursed his lip. Even after all this years, the moment was inscribed into his memory, more than any others.
"I'd love to, but I have stuff to take care of back home," said Mrs. Hudson. "I'll be back in a tick. Oh, and Sherlock, dearie, do try to eat a bit."
They stood on the pavement next to the crime scene, and John realized that he was still in Sherlock's suit jacket and Sherlock still in his rugby jacket. John was about to suggest that they finally switch clothes when Sherlock grabbed John's wrist and ran into a back alley nearby.
"Well, that's all right," said father. "We don't need another politician in this house. What kind of career do you see for yourself?"
The phone he'd left on his thigh buzzed. Sherlock hastily fumbled it open, ignoring the two agents' curious looks that they believe are inconspicuous.
Sherlock took the ornament out with his right hand, making sure that he didn't make a sound. The stranger in the kitchen was still rattling muffled noise. Slowly, stealthily, he approached the kitchen.
"Whatever witchcraft you boys do. Anyways, he's going to be here for two whole weeks, and it's obviously a big deal for Mycroft, so you'd better behave, Sherlock."
"Stop it," muttered Sherlock. He didn't pass a mystery, he never did, but this was getting too much, even for him.
Sherlock smirked. "It's starting to become clear to me that you don't ask the most pressing questions in unexpected situations. I supposed that you'd be curious why I'm here."
After a moment of debating with himself, Sherlock decided to give it a go. If this was all a dream - which was the only possible explanation at this point - he might as well use this ghost his own mind made up as a therapist.
Sherlock slung over his jacket around him. It looked slightly awkward on him - the boy was all public school, posh hair, posh trousers, and although his jacket was not cheap, it looked a bit too casual on him.
Sherlock huffed, curled himself in a ball, and glared at the space in front of him. He was sandwiched between two SIS agents, and from experience he knew that these men would not budge from their seats, no matter what kind of insult Sherlock threw in their faces.
, they immediately seized Sherlock in both sides, blocking any way of escape, and dragged him away. Sherlock was yelling, screaming, his feet dragging on the pavement and people around them watched over with concern - but the two men were completely unperturbed.
He stood up. "I don't think we should keep our disguises anymore, but it is best if we still wore these clothes until we arrived at the Met. We don't have to do anything else, of course, and so you will be able to walk in whatever way you please."
As he mindlessly let the leaf do its work, his mind took him back to the evening before. Mycroft had called him for a date, as always, and John obliged because he was free. Mycroft always knew when John was free, and although John didn't used to think much into it, Sherlock's comment about Mycroft being the British government along with Sherrinford had made John wonder if Mycroft kept tabs on John's life. Regardless of his doubt, John went out with him and had a nice time as usual. Expensive dinner in a private setting, John talking about his day and Mycroft listening with not too much interest but not without entirely, and going back to Mycroft's place for a shag.
A whiff of scent perturbed John's senses as Sherlock kept doing things to his hair. It was impossible not to look at Sherlock's face while he did so. He was concentrating, and the tiny furrow that appeared in the middle of his brows when he did was oddly captivating. It could be because of Sherlock's two, glass-like eyes. They were completely different from Mycroft's; they glistened, almost iridescent under the sunlight. John had to admit that, although he'd never say it out loud because it might be inappropriate, Sherlock was beautiful in an unconventional way.
John rolled his eyes and sighed. She did this all the time. It was just tea, though, and he didn't mind too much. He poured two cups of tea, put three sugars in for Irene (he really thought Irene should take less sugar) and a splash of milk for his own.
The lightbulb right above their sofa has been broken for weeks. It was Bill's fault, and he has been giving the two of them excuses after excuses for not getting a new one. John and Irene could get one by themselves, but the two of them agreed that they shouldn't give in until Bill did. The result was weeks of dingy light in the living room. Irene was the biggest victim of the two, because lord knows that she loves to shag her girlfriend on the sofa. John still hasn't managed to shake the image off his head.
He could feel Sherlock's rapt attention on his back, waiting for John's answer. John shoved the last of his stuff into his bag, zipped it, and turned around.
He looked around, and found nothing that could be even remotely used as a weapon. Sherrinford did learn from his mistakes, of course.
his parents, he really didn't want to explain everything only to invite more questions from them. And it's not like they ever understood his answers. He poked at the mushy carrot instead of snapping. He will endure this, and it will pass, and he will soon go back to his blood samples.
"...very well." Sherlock replied. John was going to be here anytime soon, and he could never pass an intriguing mystery. He gathered his hands near his chin, assuming his thinking position. "What do you wish to talk about, then?" He asked, gaze not leaving 'Sharon' for a second.
Mycroft will tell him to buckle up and fight against the sentiment, to conquer it and to laugh at the face of it, to ridicule it.
"Well. I can't tell you my real name. But this vessel's name is Sharon. I think. 'Sharon Macfiller.' Horrendous name, don't you think?"
"They now know our disguise, so there's no need for it." Sherlock commented as if he'd read John's mind.
That was true. That was true, and it had surprised Sherlock several times this afternoon. For every single time Sherlock had expected John to cop out, John had surprised him. He didn't cop out, but instead asked what they were doing next. They. Together. It was apparently natural for John to think that he wasn't going to leave Sherlock alone, despite the glaring fact that it was obviously Sherlock's tail that was being chased and that John didn't have any obligation to stay with him.
was the sexual drive that had long before infiltrated the others around his age. The drive that Sherlock had firmly believed himself to be exempt of its effects, up until now. This,
When John came out into the kitchen after showering, he was surprised to see Mycroft at the breakfast table.
He was deep in his musings about the kinds of expensive equipment Cambridge must have in store, leaving his parents chatter on about banal, useless ordinary chitchat. He was barely listening when a phrase caught his ear.
, and he was just overall, utterly and undoubtedly, uninterested in anything that would secure a bright future ahead of himself. The other two Holmes brothers thought differently.
"You really should let me out, there's a serial killer on the loose," Sherlock sung melodically. "Your wife will not be pleased to know about this, yes I'm talking to you, Mr. Driver. She's a hardcore romance fan. She already dislikes the fact that you had to work on your day off, and what will she say when she receives a phone call in the middle of the night informing her that you didn't so bravely rebel against your boss to save the lives of innocent Londoners? That you just conceded to the pressure of society instead? Oh, don't make that face, you must already know that none of you idiots can hide anything from people like me."
He didn't have time to change, however, so he had to power through. He had his next class in two hours, and he could be expecting a short exam of some sort so he had to study at the library. While he was there, he had a text from his coach, who was letting him know that the practice was cancelled that evening. John sighed, because after all of the disturbing sessions and coffee-spilling of the day, he could really use some exercise to get it out of his system. Accepting his fate, he obediently turned his attention back to his textbook.
"What are you doing here?" John shouted. He hurriedly wrapped his lower half with the towel. It was barely enough.
Immediately, the tension in his shoulders, the ennui in his eyes, the anxiety that's been riddling under his whole small frame - melted away in the crinkles of the smile, and Mycroft watched it in fascination.
"What does it even mean?" John asked. "Going to meet the parents at Christmas? People just do that, right?"
The tall boy genius stopped on a roof that John didn't recognize, because of course, he doesn't look for roofs when he goes to places.
"Christmas? Oh. Kate and I are having a party at her place." She said with her eyes still fixated on her phone. "What about you?"
He needed to get away. Get away from the idiotic, self-reassuring delusional morons. Get away from their tiresome, futile mind games and their greedy eyes.
But it didn't clear off the cloud that seemingly decided to hang around and ruin John's day, and literally so, because as John walked out of his building with no umbrella and all of his heavy textbooks in his arms, rain started pouring as if someone accidentally tore a hole in the sky.
"I envy people like you." Irene said, dryly. "What is it like, to be satisfied with only one partner? Are you really satisfied, or are you just deceiving yourself?"
It was only then that John realized that he had left his phone in the jacket that Sherlock wore. So no communication was possible, until the meeting at the café. The only option left for John now was to follow exactly what Sherlock has told him, and hope they meet again without the plan going awry somehow in the middle.
Power of gaze. The power inherent in the unilateral structure of those who watch and those who are watched. It's typical, a cliché; the reasons, the mechanisms of such power structure have been dissected up to the smallest element by countless scholars. Nonetheless, just like anything serious ever is, it is absolute.
. You are frugal, no, I don't mean it as an insult, and so you wouldn't spend this much on something like a phone, and if you did, you'd treat it like you treat your watch. That watch, it's an old model, it's not expensive, and yet it's pristine without a hint of its age. You obviously take care with your stuff, you are careful with them, and this phone has scrapings and scratches all over its charging port. Never seen a sober man with those marks, never seen an alcoholic without them. They fumble with their chargers in the dark, and they leave marks because they are almost always drunk."
As soon as Sherlock was out in the daylight, he took one look around and muttered something unrecognizable under his breath. Wordlessly, he spun around and started marching towards god knows where. John didn't have much choice but to follow; his attempts to call the boy had been utterly ignored. Sherlock was walking fast, and John had to jog slightly not to lose him.
John shook his head in disbelief, and a distinct fondness towards this - this unbelievable wonder of a creature in front of him - washed all over him as he did so.
"No, fuck, it's nothing like that. Don't you have better things to do than judge me and my sex life?"
"Not really, son," said father. "Well- he said something about him being more of an active type than Mycroft. We think maybe the lad plays sport of some kind."
"Yes, but I have my hands tied to this phone," said Irene, with a pleading voice. "See? I'm really busy swiping left and right."
The stranger was now awkwardly standing near the fridge. He was fidgeting with his hands near his jeans.
The cab ride was filled with Sherlock feeding details of the first three cases to John, and before he knew it, they were at Lauriston Gardens. Many of the constables frowned immediately when they saw Sherlock, and after an angry conversation - more like Sherlock's rapid rattling deductions and the officer's shouting abuse - and a radio call to the DI, they were let in.
What the "Christmas with the parents" itself meant was pretty important, too, but the real thing was precisely what Irene had just told him. John could see it becoming clearer than anything else once Irene put it like that. He'd go to Musgrave (the last time he was at the place was still vivid in his mind), meet his parents and the whole family. He'll hear stories about Mycroft's childhood (although John couldn't imagine Mycroft as a child, not ever), about the silly little embarrassing details that will make the unassailable Mycroft blush like a teenager. He'll see photo albums and Mycroft's old room and he'll listen to him awkwardly talking about the experiences he'd had in his backyard, about how he'd dirtied himself with dirt and water because he must've been if he really didn't just jump out of her mum's belly already fully-grown. He'd show John the beautiful country sky in the night, and all the stars and the quiet and the fresh air will make John feel helplessly romantic, and he will fall. Fall in love with Mycroft.
But Mycroft could also see the tension in his shoulders that couldn't be found in twenty year-olds, the flick of his eyes towards possible weaponry whenever he thought he could sense danger, and most of all, the terribly well-hidden sense of ennui, concealed and repressed under the bright ocean-like eyes and wonderfully kind smile. The kind that could be found in those who were bored of life, bored of existing. Those who were dangerous. Those who were...
Her lips made a straight line, but it seemed like she decided to let it pass. She picked up from where she left before. "...Ashton... daughter, did you see her, Siger? She's all grown up. Like our little Sherlock."
Then, just like that, he changed back to his original self with a snap of his fingers. His posture changed completely - no more of the brainless, look-at-my-enormous-dick thrust kind of sitting with his legs spread apart; his head was snapped back up high from being laid back and looking idiotic and brainless, and even his grasp on the cup changed into something more graceful, more gripping with all of his fingers rather than the ragged, beer-chugging way of handling it that it was moments ago.
Sherlock paled, and he could feel his blood draining from his face. He then turned to the woman, or the angel or the demon, whoever it was, who was now watching them with a devilish satisfaction on her face.
In less than a couple of minutes, a sturdy rope that looked like it was made from a couple of lab coats came tumbling down the wall. He could see Sherlock's messy black curls at the end of it, hinting that he was at the other end, holding onto it.
Sherlock was, apparently, still enjoying himself. John rolled his eyes but he knew he didn't look too annoyed. He was too intrigued.
"Mm. Yes. Massively successful at twenty-four. Successful enough to have John Watson at his beck and call."
"It might be!" Sherlock bellowed. "It might be, and you won't know it if I am perfect for the job, if you don't even give me a chance!"
John sighed and did what he was told. The coat was bloody bulky but he managed it. When he was done, Sherlock approached him, and when John was going to voice his discomfort for standing too closely, Sherlock combed through his still-wet hair.
Sherlock didn't answer. John faced him again, and he could see the tall boy looking downwards and blushing at the tip of his ears. It was adorable. That was almost the only thing that reminded John that the boy standing in front of him was indeed years younger than him, because with all that deep voice and the height and the posh clothes that he was wearing, he could fool anyone that he was a student here at Barts.
Sherlock stepped back, took a glance at John's overall feature, and smirked with satisfaction. John didn't know exactly what Sherlock has done, but he could guess that his hair was a lot calmer and looking more groomed, judging by his feel.
Sherlock covered John's mouth with his hand, crouching his whole body over John's. It was cold, dry, and large. Large enough to cover John's whole face.
Sherlock stood there for a few minutes, looking at the empty doorway. He then heard the sound of a car engine starting in the distance. Mycroft must be leaving, now. He hurriedly moved to the window at the back of the kitchen, from where he could see the front gates. He could see Mycroft's black Rolls-Royce Phantom rolling off smoothly like its name.
"Kate's stupid rule is driving me insane." Irene told him. "I can't shag someone matched with her until after she's done with them. Surprise, surprise! We have similar taste, everyone!"
"How indeed," Irene slightly tilted her head, gazing at John. The bowl of broccoli in her hands were now forgotten.
your hallucination. Are you seriously doubting your own consciousness when you've been clean for five months, now? Oh, speaking of five months..."
"I know you can't trust me still. But it's a good deal, isn't it? Just spill out what I already know, and you may or may not get your heartbreak fixed."
Sherlock cleared his throat. The blond mystery man's face was less than fifteen centimeters away from Sherlock's. He could see confusion written all over the fine-haired brows and cerulean blue eyes.
Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. Three texts came in consecutively. How does Sherlock type that fast was beyond John.
He sat, with his legs gathered in front of him and feet on his chair. He put his chin on top of his knees. He knew his whole body screamed 'sulking,' and he didn't care.
"I don't doubt you can, because apparently you're a genius. But... all right, I won't do anything. So what are you going to do, now?"
John smirked. "That is indeed a definition of a stalker. Following someone, convinced that they've murdered someone."
Sherlock took his suit jacket off without taking off John's rugby jacket in breakneck speed and threw it over to John, unannounced. Thank god John caught it, because it certainly wasn't the type of thing that fitted the treatment to a filthy, questionably littered concrete floor.
"Well, yes," answered Sherlock, gesturing to it absentmindedly. "Mummy's choice. Don't understand it."
John was going to demand him an answer, but because Sherlock looked urgent, he sighed and took his rugby jacket off. It was burgundy and beige, and had "John Watson" sewn over his back.
As he strolled as if there wasn't anything happening, he could feel his blood pumping through his veins, and it was just like what he felt after a good match but even stronger.
Sherlock started his way without even asking John where to, and John hurriedly caught up with him, lest he got soaked again.
"But you have been thinking of this thing between you and him as something temporary, haven't you? Something that will end eventually?"
"I don't think so. But I do know who's responsible for it," said John. "Someone who likes seating furniture for their lovemaking."
John glared at Bill, knowing that it won't have any effect. It didn't. Bill's messy school scarf was dangling along with his laughs and John wanted to tug it and choke him to death.
him. You wanted to impress him with all you've got, and so you try your best to gain information and try not to deduce him too much but - ooh, you panicked and just blurted everything out, didn't you? - and then you panic some more, which leads to you leaving with a wink and a comment about your riding crop in the morgue. So anxious and so flustered at the face of someone you like. Why, that's just adorable."
Sherlock pursed his lips, nodding. "There's always something. Real life's never so neat. Too many loose threads, too many possibilities."
"You're a piece of work," commented John, as he sat down next to her on the kitchen table with his own cup. "I think you should be an actress. You could be someone like, I dunno, Meryl Streep, maybe?"
"I said, I hate repeating myself. Do keep up, John. Your flat is less than fifteen minutes by foot and there is no need for a bus. Now stop making insipid suggestions and follow me. You do have to walk faster than me, after all."
John silently agreed to this, because even if John wasn't penniless, London cab fare was something that he could not afford easily.
Detective Inspector Lestrade, the man-in-charge introduced himself to John. He surveyed John's ID carefully, as if he doubted forgery, and Sherlock huffed and puffed in irritation until they were finally cleared to see the body.
"From the moment you figured out he shot the cabbie, there was just no way out. I'm sorry. The universe has indeed been cruel to you, hasn't it?"
"Did you sleep well, John?" Mycroft asked, slicing a piece of toast on his plate and not looking up. There was a full English breakfast on it.
It took the man a couple of blinks and seconds before he understood what Sherlock was talking about. He gave Sherlock a sheepish smile. "Well, not wrong, technically. You just missed something. I..."
"It's exhausting, isn't it?" She asked, with a voice that didn't show any compassion. It was just a question.
He found the café and because he still had his wallet on, he could order himself a cup of tea. He liked coffee, but he felt too excited now to drink caffeine.
Sherlock ignored it. "You saw the news. Everyone is convinced that they are all suicides, just because they can't figure it out. They need me. The Detective Inspector on the case said so. He hates me, but he needs me. That's how desperate they are. The longer you peg me down and prevent me from doing something under the
As he pretended to show the client the short way to the client's chair, he stealthily took his phone out and texted John behind his back, as fast as he could with one hand.
), his leave has been satisfactory. He'd solved a serial murder, for one. The credit was going to Lestrade, but Sherlock couldn't care less about that. Because the case has been such hot topic for the public, Lestrade solving the case immediately put him on the express train to his promotion, which allowed Sherlock to grill a promise out of the DI that he will consult him with further cases (
How did she know that Sherlock was thinking about the jumper? Sherlock knew that his face didn't betray his observations, he trained himself mercilessly for it. And what did she mean when she said 'humans,' as if she isn't one of them? Is this person some sort of an escaped psychiatric patient? Was this- Sherlock made sure he concentrated to his uttermost ability at this - Eurus, again?
And then, with a flick of her finger, something transparent fell behind where Sharon was sitting, and there was-
Which was exactly why he almost screamed like a schoolgirl - but he didn't, he just gaped like a fish instead - , almost dropped his towel - but he didn't, he gripped it back at the last minute, thank god - when he saw a dark figure lingering near his locker.
"Changed your mind, then. Oh, don't think too badly of this jumper," she said, feigning pity as she looked down at herself. "Sharon loves it. As idiotic as she is, I do like it when humans do this sort of thing."
"You wouldn't know if I tried. Seventeen. I'm turning eighteen next January. So, believe me, I wouldn't have had to come here if only I were born three months earlier."
"Five months, isn't that when John agreed to move back in? Yes, I know that, of course I do. As I was saying, I'm not human."
Hearing everything he'd pushed inside his mind palace, fleshed out in actual words, was harder than he expected. Sherlock closed his eyes. He was worried John might come in anytime soon, but he could hear John's footsteps on the floors and identify them any second.
John rolled his eyes, collected his books and adjusted his backpack before he jumped under Sherlock's umbrella. He was slightly irritated at how taller the younger Holmes was. Life was so unfair. So unfair. Well, Sherlock could at least hold the umbrella.
Although John still didn't know what was going on, who was following them and if he should be trusting Sherlock on this, he found himself somehow eager to follow what he's been told.
Sharon sighed. She continues digging up Sherlock's mind palace. "And then you had to Fall and John had to go and marry Mary. That rhymes. Fun. But not so fun for you. You never expected John to be so affected by your death, and when you found out that he was indeed furious, you were afraid that he'd never forgive you. Terrified. Much more than you have been when you faced Moriarty's henchmen. But you would've done it again, just like you've done, because... a-ha. John could never know, because that was part of the deal. If John knew, the instant he knew, he was getting sniped. And you knew that John wouldn't be able to completely hide it once he hears that you're alive. He's like that, isn't he? So transparent."
The man tilted his head, probably hesitating a bit, before opened his mouth again. "Ah well. Fuck it. I never got bullied, no, but my sister did. She's gay, and she got a whole lot for being one. I'm not someone who can just ignore those looks and name-callings and all that. I have a temper."
"You really should watch the way you eat," said Irene. "The ravioli already stained your jumper. Honestly. How are your screws so loose all the time?"
"And he looks totally unphased. Nerves of steel, you say? Nerves of steel, indeed. And a crackshot, too. Whoo- now, the doctor is not only just a fighter that heals, isn't he? He is acclimated to danger, and he kills without batting an eyelash, kills
A serial killer with a note, it was Christmas. The only flaw in the electrifying news was the fact that he was "grounded" by his stupid parents who still thought of him as a child and that Lestrade was a coward who didn't want to take responsibility of a legal minor on his crime scene unless there was a guardian to whom said responsibility could be shifted. (
John then remembered that Sherlock hasn't really told him why he was here. Sherlock has told him something about taking a look at the city, or something. Was that true? John wondered. Mycroft never told him exactly how much younger Sherlock was. He'd told John that Sherlock was still living with his parents, and that was about it. Sherlock could be going to uni anytime soon; did Sherlock come to London to have a look at Barts as a candidate? John doubted it. Sherlock didn't look like the medicine type. He looked like he'd do something more exciting. But what did he know? He's seen the boy only twice, now.
Several minutes later, John found himself crowded against the kitchen counter by a fully aroused Mycroft Holmes.
Fortunately, Sherlock took it. "We are finally free to go to the Met. The DI is expecting me soon. We'll need to take a cab. Don't worry, I'll pay."
"But seriously. What are you two doing? Are you exclusive, at least?" Bill asked, coming back from his howling.
"Dark windows but the marks are uneven, suggesting that it's not a curtain, it's the inside equipment reflecting whatever little sunlight this side of the building offers to the room. This means empty laboratory. Even better, I just checked the booking site, nobody's booked that lab for the next three hours. There's no need to fret over getting caught. One side of the windows are darker than the other, and it's only because there are two sets of windows and the other only one; the vertical lines on the darker side are distinguishably separate, meaning that one of it is pushed slightly further than the other, suggesting that the window is not locked. Conclusion: stop worrying about my plan."
"Oh please," Sherlock huffed. "Normal's boring. Now," said Sherlock, suddenly leaping on his feet, "what do you say? All you need to do is to stand next to me and show your ID to the inspector in order to prove you're over eighteen."
He shook his head. "Nah. Best leave it here, though. You can ask him later. He'll tell you if he feels comfortable about it."
After a beat of silence with John just staring at the little piece of pattern carved in their faux-wooden table, he sighed.
He was grateful that the conversation ended with just that. He told them Cambridge in order to appease them, and it worked. He was indeed intending to go to Cambridge, mostly because they had the best Chemistry resources. His report card wasn't fantastic because he never cared, but his official test scores were off the roof. It wouldn't be difficult, he knew.
Mycroft sighed, exasperated. But John could see that it was feigned to conceal the fact that he was, indeed, affected.
) and who had invited Sherlock up for tea, signaling that he wanted to spend more time with Sherlock. What if he invited John to a crime scene instead of tea? Would John still be up for it? John was a med student in his third year, surely he had autopsy classes - he couldn't be that affected by a dead body, despite the context of it being a victim of a serial murder. He also recalled John's excitement in his eyes when he fought Sherlock off and pressed him against the fridge the first time they encountered one another. John wasn't someone who recoiled at the face of dangerous situations, for sure. John's pupils dilated, his heartbeat elevated; in front of violence, he was excited, not afraid, and focused, not distracted.
"N- no. It's... er…" John stammered, knowing that saying "it's his brother" might sound a bit weird. "It's someone else."
"Wear that. Yes, leave the bottom button open. Straighten your spine and push your chest out. Not too much, John, don't be an idiot."
. Although Mycroft cringed and winced at the overt clichés, John could see that he appreciated the intensity and the beauty of the sentiment that was central to the theme. As far as John knew, Mycroft wasn't an emotional man, and he certainly stayed away from making romantic gestures to John. It didn't take a genius to know that Mycroft appreciated sentiment as long as it wasn't his own.
Sherlock was adamant that they find it, because apparently, it was an easy enough job for the incompetent NSY officers to take care of.
That did it. His mother sighed, closed her eyes, removed her reading glasses and put them on the coffee table. She then looked over at his son. Sherlock continued, not giving her a chance to stop him in advance.
"Medicine? We don't know. Oh, wait a minute. Didn't Mycroft say something about picking him up at Barts?"
"Lady and gentleman," Bill started, appearing on the doorstep. "I brought the bulb!" He waved a Tesco bag in the air.
That evening, Sherlock's parents insisted that Sherlock join them at the dinner table, as per usual. Mrs. Hudson was making boeuf bourguignon, one of Sherlock's least favourite
"And then what you can describe as the best day of your life happened. He said, "The Police don't consult amateurs," and up until that point, you have so carefully stopped yourself from blurting out all those deductions in your head, afraid that you'll scare off someone you liked. But because you are a show-off who couldn't stand being called an idiot, you had to say it all out, and when you were finished and was almost half-convinced that the doctor was going to kick you out of the cab, what did he say? "That, was... Amazing." "Extraordinary. Quite, extraordinary." You were quite surprised, weren't you?"
." Amused look was apparent in his friendly face. "A deer when there's like a thousand knives lying about in this house."
- but here she was, eyebrows raised and one hand on her waist, leaning against the doorframe with the utter arrogance that cannot be found in any of her hideous homemade jumper threads.
"If you are so concerned about the lives of Londoners, I will let Mycroft or Sherrinford know. They will take care of it faster than you will, I'm sure." She said, with a calm voice.
Sherlock tried not to show his irritation at her not-so-subtle jab at his rivalry against his brothers.
He didn't answer John's question, and instead coughed a couple of times as if trying to find the right voice, straightened his posture and stroke various poses, murmuring something as he went.
He'd also discovered sexual attraction, apparently. But he'd decided to ignore that steadfastly for now.
Suddenly, the proximity felt too much. Sherlock wriggled himself out from the now fully loosened grip, and the man let him do so. He went over to the counter where the kettle was sitting. Taylor's Yorkshire Gold. Not bad. Sherlock opened the cupboard above for honey. He could feel the man's gaze behind him.
His phone buzzed, and the two agents did not budge at the sound. Sherrinford was not confiscating his phone this time, then.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, ignoring the expected shock almost everyone had whenever they first encountered Sherlock's deductions.
It would be an understatement to say that Sherlock was horrified. He's never had an erection before, other than those of biological necessities - those inconveniences that he impatiently willed away several mornings of the week, to be precise - and certainly not one that was born out of evident sexual arousal.
When the driver hesitated to remove the gear from neutral to drive, the agent in his left spoke: "It's better than to be murdered by S himself."
like too." Irene said, poking John in the chest. "You don't run away in these situations. Now that you know exactly what's going on, you wouldn't be able to bear not even trying. All that Christmas stuff you've just imagined, all those sentimental moments that just flashed through your minds- you know it's playing with fire, doing all that with someone who you're not already in love with, but you want to try it, still, now that the option's in your hand."
The pouring rain somehow made a bit of a bubble around the two of them. John could feel Sherlock's warmth next to him, and it felt like everything around them was in utter chaos - the unbelievable vigour of the downpour, people running everywhere and cars honking and the bus splashing - while the two of them under the ridiculously huge umbrella were cocooned, safe, and cozy. The rain that somehow found its way to their knees and below only sharpened the contrast of how dry and comfortable he felt on his upper body.
"...and I wanted to see the young man's picture, at least, and he was terribly embarrassed. It was so good to see that, Siger. Our boys are finally growing up! I wonder if Sherry's seeing someone, too."
And now, Sherlock was begging her to send him off to London. To solve a serial murder. With Scotland Yard.
It seemed that Sherlock had changed his face appropriately to the topic at hand. Who wants to talk about
John had never spent a Christmas with his boyfriend's (or girlfriend's) family. Well, he did meet his first girlfriend's mum at their house, but that was just when they were young. Even younger than now. He didn't know what the gesture meant by then. He still didn't know what it means, exactly, meeting the other's parents. How serious is it, exactly? Does it mean they have to get engaged, or something, in the future? His knowledge about this kind of stuff extended only to the lines from romance TV dramas and movies, which meant nothing actual, nothing real-life. Damn it.
The phone stayed quiet longer than before. Probably having a mid-walk crisis at the fact that the man he's been dating was, in fact, omnipotent. Sherlock let out a low hum, tapped his feet against the seat of his car, and deduced people that he could see through the car window.
Another minute has passed, and still no reply from John. It was possible that John decided to end the conversation without any word of parting. Sherlock did it all the time. But he knew that it was part of social conventions to not end one without phrases like "good bye," or "take care," or, in the case of texts, annoyingly something like "ttyl," "gtg," or something of the sort. Sherlock just never cared for social conventions, but others did. John definitely did. He also knew that this convention hinged on two conditions: one, if the conversation wasn't obviously ending, and two, if the participant was trying to be polite. Was John not trying to be polite with him? But he seemed to be enjoying the conversation they were having. Wasn't he? Regardless, Sherlock sent him another text. John was involved in the case, too, and it was only logical that he was sent the information regarding said case.
