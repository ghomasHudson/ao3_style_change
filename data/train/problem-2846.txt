Castiel raises an eyebrow. “I suppose I know how it is in theory.”
“Yes. A little birdie told me my son had found a mate, and I thought I should meet you, see if I approve,” Lucifer says. Dean would bet his

“Thank you for dinner, Meg, I had a lovely time.”
“It’s possible.”
choices?”
Dean Winchester, apparently, is a man of infinite tupperware containers.
“Maybe whoever left it doesn’t need you to return their feelings, Cas,” Dean says, voice tight.
It’s both different and incredibly similar to having sex with a woman; with Amelia. The motions of his body are mostly the same, the joy of connection, but the angles are a little different. Dean’s body is thicker, firmer. Plunging into his lube-slicked hole certainly feels different. Not better,
. Okay. Well, we need to pick a place. I need to get back into school, and you need… a social life.”
“Mhm. I think you just like costing Crowley business.”
Castiel resumes carding his fingers through Dean's hair, closing his eyes to savor the soft, contended sound he draws out in response. “I am too, Dean.”
“I just… I wanted to be able to call Sam as soon as possible if you had another nightmare.”
He doesn’t realize he’s drifted until he wakes, still naked, Dean snoring gently on top of him. It’s been over a year since Castiel last had sex, but he doesn’t remember ever passing out quite so easily before.
“What? No, shut the hell up,” Dean says, even though he did. He didn’t realize Sam was still there eating the rest of his damn meal.
Sam’s all dressed up for work, shoulder bag at the ready. He works in IT for some fancy engineering firm, which is wild because when Dean left for Thailand, Sam was a lawyer. Back then, Sam was dating a firecracker named Ruby, he was working for an up and coming law firm here in Wichita, and every single suit he wore cost more than Dean's entire wardrobe put together. Then Dean comes home four years later, Sam's already married and divorced Ruby, he's quit practicing law, and he’s traded in the expensive suits for khakis and a polo shirt so yellow sometimes Dean can’t look directly at it.
The man tilts his head. “I live here. Alone. Are you waiting for me?”
“I would. I would like that. I feel like there’s some stuff we ought to talk about.”
going to name five women from Firefly. “Chloe Bennet, Jamie Chung, uh… oh, and Castiel Novak,” he says, smirking at Charlie.
“And… and our first kiss can always be this cute mistake we made, because we’re so comfortable with each other we didn’t even realize we’d done something… new?” Dean tries.
Claire’s finally gotten off the bed, shouting “Dad! Jesus FUCK!” over and over,
From Cas - 8/07/17 - 4:00pm: They said three weeks, in order allow for time to make script changes and have me back by midseason.
Jimmy smiles and sighs. “Me too, Claire.”
Castiel puts his face in his hands, letting out a sad whimper when the action hurts his nose and moving the bag of corn back onto his face. Kaia comes over with two Advil and a glass of water, which she hands to Claire. She’s dressed to go, bag slung over her shoulder.
When he wakes up, they’re not holding hands anymore, but Castiel is lying on his side, watching him. There’s a lot of emotion in his eyes that Dean can’t decipher. He’s so fucking bad at reading people these days. He can still read Sam pretty well, but he had nearly twenty-six years to learn him. Castiel’s new, and Dean doesn’t “get” people like he used to. His eyes dart down for a split second, to Dean’s mouth, maybe.
It’s a nice shade of blue, certainly nicer than the moldy-concrete-gray color the house’s previous owner picked. “I don’t know,” Dean says. He points to a color two shades down, this one just a little brighter, a bit more saturated. “I think I like this one…” He moves Castiel’s thumb from over the color’s name, grimacing when he sees what it’s called. Well, then.
“Thank you so much for this,” Castiel says. “I confess I’d forgotten all about dinner. Would you like to join us?”
“You don’t have to
before, that’s all.”
Already this position feels more base, more brazen. “Fuck me, Dean,” Castiel says, feeling silly with the words until Dean all but growls and grips Castiel’s hips with both hands.
pace, pistoning in and out of Castiel like a machine.
“I have a deadline to consider.”
Dean relaxes back against the couch. “Well then, you don’t have to.”
“Struck out, yeah?”
((Nineteen weeks post-rescue))
Castiel reaches in his pocket, pulling out a phone. “It is.”
the right pressure against his prostate. “I noticed.”
Dean works the long briefs down, over Castiel’s knees, past his calves, off his feet, and then Castiel is completely bare save for Dean’s ties around his eyes and wrists. He wonders how he looks right now, what Dean sees. He wonders what
“You drove to Chicago from Kansas. For pizza.”
“Whatever you’re attempting to ask,” Castiel says, teeth nipping at Dean’s lower lip, “the answer is yes.”
“What do you think, kid?” Dean says as Hael is surveying her work.
“Dean, I’ll be fine, really.”
“What’s got you so peppy?” Hannah asks once Castiel is done bringing the partners their lunches.
“He’s very strong,” Lucifer says, eyes on the ceiling as though he’s looking up at Castiel. “I’ve heard he feeds well from you.”
He never expected to see Dean, also known as Archangel Barachiel, wearing a Christmas sweater. It’s a patchwork of sorts, large red, white, and black squares, with holly, poinsettias, Christmas trees, and doves embroidered in various sections. The sweater has a red forward-point collar, with downright
“My brother? Was it Michael? It was Michael wasn’t it.”
“You can’t just name five women from Firefly,” Charlie interrupts.
“Come on, you
“Wow, you’ve had this house planned for a while, huh?” Dean says.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“So… what’s your story man?” Dean says. It sounds like he’s aiming for casual.
“Who do you want to be, Dad?”
, feeling good together.”
“I want… he’s my landlord, and I just found out it’s his birthday, and he’s been so kind to me and my daughter, and he was the first friend I made in this town, I want to get him something special.”
“You should meet Balthazar,” Dean says, before frowning. “Actually you’re just his type, you should
This is such a bad idea. But Gabriel's there, and he's willing to listen. “There was a thing I wanted… and I didn’t think I could have it. But I
“Younger. Less intimidating.”
Dean spends his entire walk to the bus station smiling to himself, and he’s not even really sure why.
Dean goes to bed that night wondering if Tessa can be his great love if he doesn’t even miss her.
Castiel arrives at Sam’s house at noon on Saturday, wearing those damn aviators, a Pac Man t-shirt, and jeans that fit him so well Dean almost whimpers when Castiel walks past him into the house.
Dean has so much embarrassed anxiety running through him it’s almost painful. “I guess not, not really. But sometimes I feel too much like we’re weird Uncle Dean and his boyfriend shacking up in the basement. Like we’re characters in Sam’s story instead of leading our own.” Dean groans, scrubbing both hands over his face. He doesn’t know what the fuck he’s feeling or how to explain it.
To Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:15pm: fuck
“Not true, Claire makes me add pepperoni and olives.”
“Yeah.” Sam keeps inviting Dean to come along, but Dean’s hold on reality is just a bit too tenuous for something like dressing up as a warrior and pretending to battle a medieval magician in the park or whatever it is Sam does. “This is more important, though, so if—”
“So?”
Castiel grins. “You’ll be pleased to know that I helped make the food and it still came out edible!”
“Dunno, I can say a lot of bullshit about how it wasn’t anyone’s business, or it didn’t matter, but I guess it was just fear, and maybe projecting like… internalized homophobia.”
Cas. Was that Britney Spears?”
From Cas - 8/14/17 - 9:21am: That sounds like a lot of work.
To Cas - 8/23/17 - 12:38am: okay you definitely misunderstood that conversation
“I’m not negative, I’m cautious. Really it’s this person’s fault for not signing their name.”
They make it a month. A month of Castiel snacking on Dean’s sins while they’re on hunts or out for drives, a month of acrobatic but non-glowing sex. After two weeks they take the sod rolls out of the basement and tarp over the garden boxes. There’s just no way to keep those alive without Castiel’s grace, and Dean doesn’t want to spend nine months with dead grass in his room.
When Claire doesn’t follow up with “just kidding!” Castiel makes his way out to the Continental, pulling open the box of books he has in the back seat.
Castiel feels a little like he just got backhanded in the heart. What he wouldn’t give to erase the scars Amelia has left on their daughter.
“So,” Dean says, eyes drawn to Castiel’s Ganesh tattoo as they often are.
“Or red,” Claire says.
From Cas - 9/01/17 - 5:38pm: You’ll drive up here?
did you just ask me?”
The video quality is fairly poor, but Castiel can see what she’s pointing at. A tall man in a baseball cap that obscures his face to the camera’s high angle. He’s carrying a small package and a teddy bear, and he wouldn’t be remarkable if it weren’t for his unmistakable bow-legged gait.
I’m sorry I asked.”
“When he saw me in the same aisle as him, he grabbed his son’s hand and rushed away as fast as he could.”
Castiel’s lost. “Product? Like… marijuana? I’ve never really been into it, but if you think it would help—”
Castiel lets out a soft little gasp; Dean’s heart does a backflip. “I… absolutely, that sounds like a good idea.”
,” Castiel mutters, over and over, “you feel so
“What the fuck is
There’s no bus back to Wichita until tomorrow, so Castiel offers Dean his couch. It’s pretty early in the evening, but Dean’s drained, Castiel had seemed emotionally if not physically exhausted, there’s no reason for them to stay up. Dean actually wanted to talk to Castiel some more, but he figures they have time; they’ve already exchanged phone numbers, discussed compensation... this maintenance plan is pretty much a done deal, they’ll have time to talk again later.
“That sounds awful.”
“That can’t be good for your back, Dean.”
“You are angry that we didn’t intervene,” Castiel says flatly.
a sexual offer.”
“Yeah?”
Meanwhile, there’s still so much to do. They’ve got the old furniture piled up behind the house to deal with later, they have a decent amount of cleaning supplies, but they’re in serious need of lumber. They need to replace floors, a few load-bearing beams, the porch… and Castiel wants to make their bed himself.
“Yeah, I—”
“Dean,” Castiel whispers.
“Yep.”
“It seems hopeful to me.”
“Can’t you just guess?”
They travel for ten hours before they reach Lexington, Nebraska at eleven at night, hungry and exhausted. They eat their weight in curly fries at Arby’s before heading to an Econo-Lodge.
“If you don’t like it, I’m not gonna feel hurt, or mad, okay? It’s important you know that. We’ll stop and do something else.”
“Well just like you, I retain veto power, so no naming me after those boys in One Dimension.”
Rachel smiles, patting Castiel on the shoulder. “Let’s just say if you’ve been wondering why this position comes with such great pay and benefits, you won’t be wondering that by the end of the day. Now, if they try to rope you into working for them in your off-shift time, tell them no. If they think you’ll be at their beck and call during non-work hours, they’ll be calling you at all times of the day making demands.”
“Delivery men?”
” Castiel insists, “I might be on my way to that state, but let’s not exaggerate the situation, Dean.”
Castiel glares. “You’re being ridiculous.”
“I wanted to know where you went!”
“And we
Castiel smiles. “When you put it that way… I suppose it
Castiel is crouched in front of the strawberries, sampling them and moaning with each bite. His wings are still out, sprawled lazily in the grass behind him, looking as fucked-out as Dean feels.
Dean looks at Castiel, who’s now apparently frozen. “Dude,” he whispers, leaning over to gently smack Castiel’s arm with the back of his hand, “you have to speak.”
“How about—” Michael stops suddenly, grimacing.
“Do you need personal space at this particular moment?”
Nothing happened. They didn’t talk, didn’t really touch. They watched part of a movie and ate some popcorn. Is that worth reporting? Would it be better or worse to be honest? Dean debates this the entire drive home, taking his time walking up the two flights of stairs to his apartment.
“Not really,” Castiel says. It’s a school day, so no one is home but Dean, Castiel, and Sam’s dog. They’re on Sam’s couch, watching daytime TV with the volume low while Dean gives Castiel a foot rub. Dean’s wearing Castiel’s red cassock, and Castiel is wearing Dean’s Batman boxers and Superman t-shirt.
“Are you fucking shitting me?” Jess shouts from the living room. “Holy shit. Holy
“Sorry to ruin your morning after bubble,” Hannah says with a yawn, “but I’ve got brunch with Hester, Benjamin, and Ambriel... and that means coffee.”
“You look…” Dean trails off, because his first instinct was to say “smashing”, but that sounds like something Ketch would say. Or Austin Powers.
“Really? Not
“Should I bring Meg a corsage?” Castiel replies.
in pleasure; Dean’s already wishing he had something to record the beautiful sounds he makes, the sinuous way his body moves between Dean and the shower wall. Dean finds himself sucking a bruise low on Castiel’s neck, and judging by the sounds Castiel makes, he’s into it.
“But he had popcorn.”
“I’m old and full of surprises,” Dean says with a wink.
“Dean?”
Oh God, Dean didn’t notice. All the lights are off, he couldn’t tell. But there’s a face in one of the windows. The person in the window tilts their head slightly,
“Know what I think?” Claire says from where she’s perched in front of the TV.
“I know, I…” Castiel buries his face in his hands. “I don’t know what to do, I’ve never been attracted to a man before.”
“That you were
“You said good with
“Hey, it’s fine,” Dean says. “I know the feeling. There’s stuff I did when I was younger that… they were more about pleasing my dad than what I really wanted.” He starts to get that lost, faraway look he gets sometimes, and Castiel nudges him with his foot.
Henriksen. “I can do that. I think you, at some point— and I’m not saying it needs to be this Wednesday or even this
“Boring, yes. But I like the quiet, and I love the smell of paper.” Castiel takes a bite of his food and sighs happily. “This is wonderful, Dean. I really ought to eat things other than sandwiches and bake-at-home pizza.”
“Claire, that entire apartment smelled like sweat and dogs, I don’t care how big the bedrooms were,” Castiel says, glaring at the Craigslist listings on his phone.
“Why bother? He’s nearly broken through, may as well let him finish his work. It’s been good to meet you, Dean, pity we didn’t have more time to talk.”
“Say please!” Claire whispers.
“You’ve been pretty unflappable since you started here,” Gabriel says, “we were just curious about what’s got you so rattled.”
“Har har.” Dean groans, crawling out of his “fort” and onto the bed.
“Claire Elizabeth Novak,” Jimmy repeats. “Let’s give it a couple of weeks, shall we? And after that, we can see about making it legal.”
Castiel raises his eyebrows. Gabriel certainly didn’t mention that in the interview. “
“Padded bra. When Muriel was still pre-surgery, pre-HRT… she loved her padded bras. But keep it tasteful, size wise, kiddo. And when you’re dating? Disclose safely. In public, or with a friend,
“I assure you, there are no sedatives in my underwear, Dean.”
Castiel frowns. “She wanted us to act as though Claire were broken, sick, in need of curing… when the only thing making Claire sick was living as someone she wasn’t. So… my life with Amelia ended, and I was blessedly granted custody, and we left.”

of the main characters, yes.”
“Sammy, I want to go, but—” Dean sighs. “I hate the way they look at me. I hate the way their voices sound when they talk to me. The pity is almost as fucking unbearable as them trying to act like nothing’s changed when
But fine. Two snacks of Dean’s choice.
they’re having some sort of silent conversation.
“Don’t urinate near the tent,” Castiel mutters.
“Something to perk you up. Hope you haven’t had lunch yet.”
“I’ve always known that Hester was wrong. That other version of myself proves it.”
“So I can get a little drunk.”
“Are you a competitive child?”
“Don’t stop.”
“That’s um… that’s good.”
Castiel stops struggling. “Lead the way.”
“Lose weight from

“I’ve been doing a lot of reading about the relationship between genitalia and identity, and I think—”
it’s a fact.”
“You need friends!”
“If we intend to live in the area, I’d rather not give people the wrong impression.”
“We’d still like to see it if we could?”
“No… no, that’s not... for me, it’s more like… no matter what someone’s packing downstairs, that’s not going to be a deal breaker. Who I’m into is just who I’m into.”
They’re both silent for a while, but eventually Dean reaches the Crown Heights area and Castiel has to give him directions. God damn this is far from where Dean found Castiel, did that guy really jog all that god damn way and plan to jog back?
“Yeah I
“Me?”
intact considering it fell out of a fucking plane.
“This is how I raised you?”
There’s a buzzing sound.
Dean nearly chokes on his salad. “The fuck? High on coke?”
There was this niggling fear in the back of Dean’s mind, that maybe the build-up was all they had, but even as Castiel is gently dabbing Dean’s stomach and softening cock with a cool washcloth, he knows this is more than sexual tension.
“I feel like you’re just talking about yourself at this point.”
“I… use a jojoba oil shampoo. Were you smelling my hair?”
Dean is…
“If you can keep a secret, why does the entire office know about Malachai getting food poisoning and ruining his pants?”
“Well, figured I should wait for your nose to heal.”
Castiel looks around as well. A great deal of his belongings are still boxed or bagged.
“Christ was born in April,” Castiel tries.
father, and I have a say in this. We’re not doing this, Amelia.”
Castiel nods sadly.
“The style is similar, though the content is so different. They’re so beautiful,” Castiel says wistfully, eyes drifting to the lower right corner of the painting. His eyes widen at the “DW, 2015” painted there faintly. “
“Looking for a fresh start.”
Gross. “Like a kid?”
lime green nail polish. Dear God in heaven.
“What if he likes you too?”
By the time their burgers arrive at their booth, Dean’s spilled most of the important details to Mary. Things with Tessa growing distant, jealousy over Ketch, the kiss, jealousy over Castiel, and then “let’s see other people for a while”. Mary’s a good listener when she’s actually around, and it feels good for Dean to get this off his chest to a loving parent.
Castiel smiles. “I like that.”

“I despise you.”
“Yeah but you said it all…
of casseroles. The fridge and freezer are getting crowded. On the plus side, they’re good casseroles. Most of it’s coming from my Aunt Ellen and my Uncle Bobby... neither are blood relatives, that’s just what I call them… anyway, they make good food. They’re real anxious to get meat on my bones,” Dean says, pinching his own cheek. He’s filled out a lot since he got back, but he still doesn’t have the body he did before; fit, but comfortably pudgy in places. He actually misses the bit of tummy fat he used to complain endlessly about to Lisa.
Dean looks at Castiel for a long moment before scooping up some ice cream in his spoon. “Not to make your pain about me, but you’re kinda hurting my feelings here, man.”
“I think I’d like to do it.”
“How do I look?” Castiel says, holding his arms out.
Dean looks Castiel over, trying to imagine him in all black, scythe by his side. “Will it be you?”
“Strawberry was my father’s favorite for years, which was a big deal because my father was…”
No response. A few seconds tick by, and Castiel pushes the button again.
It really is a horrible invasion of Dean’s privacy, but at the same time it helps to know Charlie cares that much. “Half a point.”
to die… I’ve never felt more hopeless in my entire life. That medication was supposed to help me, and instead it made everything worse. I really… I really thought I might end things.” Castiel gets this little smile then, and Dean feels the ache in his heart start to ease. Right. This is the past. “Then one day, Anna and Rachel came by, just to say hello. I’d internalized quite a bit of my struggle, they didn’t know I was getting worse. They were both excited about a story they’d read in the newspaper, about a man in Kansas who’d been thought dead after his plane crashed at sea years ago.”
” all the way to the bathroom.
Oh… oh, that’s
“So, you’re like… a nerd, huh?” Dean says, smirking.
“But I’m
“Sure, you can have my paper, thank you for asking.”
Castiel spends another hour in his pajamas, but his heart is no longer in the whole “crying into a tub of ice cream” thing. He eats a bit more, because it’s
Yep, Dean’s having some thoughts.
“Tell me about it.”
Castiel makes a squeaking choking sound and shakes his head vigorously. “No.
“Of course I do.”
“What did you get him?”
far. I’ve driven farther just for pizza.”
“I was thinking it would be cheaper… we might not find a place in Jasperville right away, which would mean staying in motels… which would eat up my savings…”
“I, uh…” Castiel retreats into his room, unsurprised when Claire and Sam follow. “I have two…”
“What’s in Illinois, Dean?”
“Yes, I’ve heard that,” Castiel says, nodding sagely. He’s fidgeting with the little stuffed bear he gave Dean the day they met. “Though I think perhaps you’re just looking to stuff your face.”
Sam pauses in cleaning, looking up at Dean with too-keen eyes. Dean knows he’s looking at Dean, wondering just what, or
“I didn’t know my friend would be
“I… look like me, but in a suit.”
Castiel wonders if he should put a stop to this.
“I somehow ended up with a date for tomorrow night…”
“Yeah, good luck, Cas!” Sam says.
“I suppose.”
By the time they’re finished it’s nearly eight, and they have a three story house complete with a yard and a garage mounted on the green posterboard. Castiel takes about a thousand pictures with his phone, and gets Dean and Hael to pose with it.
“You remembered.”
Dean is there, same old Dean. Same faded black Led Zeppelin t-shirt, same pair of dark blue jeans with a hole forming at the right knee, same devastating green eyes, but… no beard.
“Is that a Hickory Farms basket?”
The door swings open, and… no.
“He only calls us his step-brothers when he’s annoyed,” Gabriel says, smirking.
“It’s a bit at odds with his uh… gruff exterior, I suppose.”
Castiel reaches out with an aborted movement, then drops his hand. He says nothing, so Dean continues.
Dean’s arms go around Castiel’s shoulders almost involuntarily. He groans, long and low at the slow, inexorable shove of Castiel into his body, toes curling as his voice cuts off on a high gasp when Castiel bottoms out.
when I’m in full drag. Start small, work your way up.” Samandriel starts curling the ends of Claire’s extensions.
” Claire says by way of greeting. “They smell so good, but I haven’t had time to try them, since I’m kicking everyone’s ass.”
Castiel sighs. “I hate this place.”
Ketch speaks for what seems like the first time tonight. “I really don’t.” Tessa nudges him.
Dean thinks he could probably sleep on the couch, but he doesn’t want to waste an hour trying to find out, so he bids Castiel goodnight and heads out to the air mattress still waiting in the backyard. He spends a minute or two getting settled under the glow of the “bedside” flashlight; taking off his boots, shaking dry foliage off the blanket, then he lies on his back and closes his eyes.
Castiel pushes the door open. “I hadn’t noticed this before, but you’re a bit of a dick, aren’t you?”
“I mean technically he did… four years ago.”
“He sure as fuck never has before, but there’s a first time for everything.” Dean has an odd little smirk that Castiel thinks might be pride.
to live across from someone that has so many loud arguments that he has to warn his tenants about it?”
Dean stands slowly, uncomfortable. This is way too intimate a moment for him to be witnessing, and Castiel seems like he’s gotten past the fear portion of the call. “I’m gonna—”
“Hello, Mr. Complicated.”
Castiel sighs, glaring at Gabriel over his cup of coffee. “Go fuck yourself, Gabriel.”
“What?” Gabriel says.
“Jasperville.”
Castiel vanishes while Dean is working on washing the back of the house, and when he’s finished Dean finds Castiel at the front, holding up his array of paint swatches and squinting.
Dean smiles up at him. “I just love that Illinois backyard ambience too much.”
That startles a laugh out of Dean, which inexplicably triggers his orgasm. He comes, whimpering and confused, making a mess on the sheets and almost immediately turning to jelly in Castiel’s arms.
“Given half a chance, my dad will put his nerd hat on for just about anything,” Claire says with a smirk.
? Of course. Of fucking course, Ketch.”
“I mean kind of, I don’t know. He was nice about it. We talked until we fell asleep and when I woke up he was all snuggled up against—” Dean cuts himself off, but it’s too late, Sam’s already perking up again.
“I don’t know,” Castiel says with an annoyed huff, “pick something for your damn dinner.”
Dean always thought of himself as in shape. He doesn’t hit the gym or go on semi-daily runs like Sam, but hunting can burn quite a lot of calories, with the digging graves and the fleeing from monsters and the wandering the woods in search of whatever beast he’s hunting that week. So, yeah, Dean thought of himself as in shape.
“If you were a gentleman, you’d do the kind thing and pretend you didn’t witness that.”
Dean’s almost speechless. “Fucking

“I hope you don’t mind,” Castiel says once they’re on the road, “but I made… plans for tonight, since I assumed you’ll be sleeping.”

“What I’m saying is… if you’re ever willing… I mean it’d be cool to still hang out. Even when I’m in Lawrence. It’s not
“I cried while watching Pretty Woman. At the end, when Richard Gere shows up to whisk Julia Roberts away. I guess I should be up front about that before we do anything.”
They spend a few hours watching a football game on TV. Or, at least Sam and Castiel do. The three of them are all on the couch, Castiel in the middle, and Dean spends the entire game thinking about how Castiel’s leg is pressed up against his. By the time Sam turns the TV off, Dean’s not even sure who the fuck was playing or if they watched the full game.
He doesn’t know where to go. Lawrence feels more like home, but Dean’s still got a job, that’s not a good commute. Jo lives with her mom, Ash’s apartment always smells like old beer cans and pot smoke, Mick lives with god damn Ketch, Tessa is at Charlie’s, and Victor just flat out refuses to have guests over.
“Sucks to be you,” Brunette Ruby says.
“Oh jeez, don’t tell me you’re into that too. I mean hey, I’m cool with it, but I expect to see your costume.”
blushing now.
“A quirk that can be attributed to your trauma.”
Dean doesn’t even want to know how the hell that happened. “Well, I’m uh… staying with Sammy for a little while, Tessa and I are kind of on a break.”
pee on it.
“I apologize, it’s early in the afternoon where I am.”
Castiel shrugs and sets his notebook and pen down. “I guess. Unless you have some ideas for the show tonight.”
Claire just grins. “I’m unpacking your room while you’re gone. Unless there’s stuff you don’t want to me to see.”
“I could do that…” Castiel’s already drifting back towards his bedroom, yawning loudly as he goes.
“We’re talking about this now?” Dean says.
“Okay,” Claire says, gripping her pillow tighter.
He hears the sound of rustling paper and looks over to the partners handing wads of cash to a smirking Lucifer.
From Cas - 8/08/17 - 1:13pm: [IMAGE ATTACHED]
“Do you miss it?”
“So he had sex between innings,” Dean says, scooting to make room for Castiel.
“So… a teacher or a florist.”
“Yeah?”
“From the commercials?!”
It takes quite a while to get Castiel ready. He coasts on mild feelings of pleasure, the sound of Dean’s slowly elevating breathing. It’s a little hard to tell since he can’t see, and he’s not used to this, but he’s fairly certain Dean is up to four fingers when his hand moves away, and the kisses along Castiel’s hips stop. Castiel hears rustling as the bed shifts.
This is one of those moments when Dean wonders if he’ll still be hunting when he’s his father’s age.
After texting Claire to dip into their leftovers for dinner, Castiel drives to the Jasperville Mall. He drifts from store to store, waiting for something to jump out at him. It’s getting very late in the evening and Castiel is crestfallen when he realizes the mall will be closing soon.
“Dean is… gruff… but also very warm when he opens up. He’s a wonderful cook, a gifted painter… he loves his car. He’s kind, and shy...” Castiel finds himself staring off into space. “He has a lovely smile.”
“I do? I do.”
“Oh… oh my.”
“He represents a large part of my past and my identity, but no, he’s not my favorite player.”
Claire has one final appointment with Dr. Milton, and she comes out with a long list of mental health resources in and around Jasperville.
Dean nods, timid, and Castiel follows him across the hall. The movie Stardust is on Dean’s TV, paused near the beginning. It’s one of Dean’s go-to comfort movies, sometimes he even plays the soundtrack when he’s having trouble sleeping.
” Castiel insists. “I don't even date men.”
“I don’t have to do that, I’m tethered to Sam.”
Dr. Hamilton is
“Yeah, like you do when you’re too chicken to call someone you want to date.”
ugly car, man.”
“I’m a teenager. I need variety, or my mental and emotional growth will be compromised.”
Sam shrugs. “I mean there was always a slim chance this was some weird prank…”
“I worked hard for this exhaustion.”
“Eight.”
To Cas - 8/08/17 - 2:30pm: I’VE HAD YOUR TONGUE IN MY MOUTH AND HE THINKS I’M LYING
“Later… later… I want to know what this is like, first.”
From Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:51pm: You’re very sweet, Dean. Thank you.
“We’re not friends, and there’s no way he knows Jon Hamm.”
“She wasn’t willing to let Claire be Claire, and that caused irreparable damage to our marriage.”
“He does not.”
Dean hears the faint sounds of clicking and typing when he gets up, and he pads out to the living room. Castiel is in his pajamas, wrapped up in a blanket and sitting on the couch with a laptop balanced in his lap. He’s… playing World of Warcraft.
Sam takes a step back. “Uh, nothing.”
Castiel is also, apparently, a morning person. That wasn’t at all clear when Dean saw him hungover and miserable that day so many months ago, but when he hasn’t been drinking the night before, Castiel likes to get up with the sunrise and go for a jog. A
Dean rests his head on Castiel’s raised knee, laughing hard. “Holy fucking shit, Cas.”
“I think learning by doing is the way to go. Don’t worry, Cas. In my experience as long as you don’t bite down it’s pretty hard to really mess up a blowjob.”
“And I take it you didn’t find an answer?”
Sam sighs, but nods. “Okay, but we gotta go home for this conversation.”
“You’re a true hero, Cas. Didn’t know they made boxer briefs that long,” Dean says, gesturing at the rather long orange pair Castiel is wearing.
“And we’ll relive our greatest hits together, huh?”
“Not yet… I just needed…” Castiel puts both hands on the back of Dean’s head, pulling him in for a kiss. Dean moans into the kiss, hips rocking gently, cock slowly sliding in, out. Their kiss continues as Dean builds a rhythm. He has one hand underneath Castiel, one hand braced next to them. Dean is everywhere.
Castiel fights the urge to back out right then and there. The woman that lived above them in their apartment in Pontiac had loud, frequent,
“Nothing would make me happier.”
“Awesome. Love me some summer sausage. Headed to the store… how do you feel about roast beef sandwiches? Just need to get some rolls.”
“I am.”
To Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:19pm: see you get it
Tessa glares. “I know that. But you didn’t have to give him my dinner.”
From Cas - 8/11/17 - 4:35pm: How will you entertain me? Some sort of strange brother strip show?
to you?” Castiel manages to say.
I’m not afraid of some grouchy, ill-tempered—”
“For one, my county was conservative, and my part of town wasn’t particularly diverse. When I was eleven, my friend Roger’s parents got divorced, and his father moved to Arkansas. Our loving community rather pitied and ostracized Roger’s mother until she remarried a good, Christian man and went back to having a good, normal family. I didn’t know about that for years. Oh, there was a girl I liked that I had to stop dating because my parents found out her parents were atheists. My grandparents on my mother’s side were…
Cas, that’s some alarming shit, but yeah I’m okay. Didn’t even see any demons while I was there. It was probably the best case scenario as far as visits to Hell go, right?” Dean wonders if he should share the part about having Lucifer's approval. Now's probably not the time.
“Well, that’s… that’s good to know.”
“Uh… no?”
Dean mutters something, but he doesn’t move.
Dean grins. “It’s a gift.”
Impala67: look it’s a delicate friendship... when things are more solid, I’ll see if he’s open to you slobbering all over him and asking for his autograph
Life drifts toward routine.
Dean jerks the dish away. “It’s hot.”
“Very wise words.”
Castiel breathes in deep; the air here smells very sweet. “One hundred thirty-four days, eighteen hours, twenty-one minutes, and twelve seconds.”
Okay, so it’s a casual thing, nothing to fret about. Castiel was just here yesterday, it’s not a big deal.
“I think my day is wide open.”
“Oh my, I’m getting excited about this already.”
“Very funny,
“I enjoy kissing you far too much to let something like that get in my way.”
“Then why did you guys split up?” Blonde Ruby says.
“Never read my Wikipedia page? I thought I was your ‘Celebrity Freebie’,” Castiel says, making air quotes in an awkward if not endearing way.
Castiel wouldn’t have thought it possible, but Dean actually seems
“No, not really.”
“Why him? Why not Hank Aaron or Babe Ruth?”
“Pew, pew!” Dean replies, firing two finger guns at Castiel in return then pretending to holster them at his waist.
Not that Castiel’s expecting to lose Dean, but… sometimes a friendship can falter when one friend confesses a romantic interest in the other friend.

“Well, as I’ve mentioned, I was not exactly in demand socially, but I did attend a few… I suppose commitment ceremonies among angels.”
“Yeah, it was uh… it was kind of weird,” Dean says, sitting on the couch. He’s assuming they didn’t get their nails done
“So, you call Castiel yet?”
“Please don’t tell anyone, Hannah. I’m not ready for the partners to ruin this yet.”
“No problem. I’m gonna head in now, Abaddon promised to break out the strap-on if I struck out tonight,” Meg says with a wink.
“I had a wonderful time tonight, Dean, thank you for making me feel welcome,” Castiel says softly. He’s lying on his back, but his head is turned to the right towards Dean.
From Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:30pm: I have a date tonight.
Jimmy pulls Claire close, kissing the top of her messy brown hair. “You want to pick my new name?”
Victor, don’t—”
“Yeah. I mean.”
“Well... well okay, then.” Claire’s crying, but she’s smiling.
“Sometimes there is a ceremony, but nothing with white veils, or marriage licenses, or officiants.” Castiel looks up from Dean’s copy of The Sirens of Titan. “Why, would you like to get married?”
Castiel’s heart makes strong efforts to leap out of his chest. He hears some rustling, Dean removing clothes, maybe. Then Dean’s lips are kissing along Castiel’s hip bone. The kisses are slow, savoring, going lower and lower until Dean’s tongue is swiping at the head of Castiel’s cock. Castiel’s hands involuntarily attempt to move towards Dean’s head, but of course they can’t.
After probably three minutes of solid,
Castiel seems uncomfortable, so Dean fights the urge to giggle hysterically at the thought of this guy knocking on all his neighbors’ doors trying to fucking find him.
“Should I bump Novak for Dr. Sexy?” Dean chuckles.
want kids, and… there was other stuff, but that was a big one. We just weren’t working. So, I was going to break things off when I got home. But of course, I didn’t make it home.”
Dean is being so… talkative and friendly. It’s making Castiel nervous, like he’s going to say the wrong thing and ruin it.
“Gabriel called it a ‘signing bonus’. He’s in great spirits today, I heard it’s because you upset Lucifer.”
“Yeah, he did.” Dean grins and clutches Castiel’s hands tight as he looks into his eyes, already anticipating the glow. “Even the fucking devil can see how much I love you, Cas.”
“That’s no reason not to tell me.”
“You have a lovely smile,” Castiel says.
Sam and Claire spend a few minutes working mousse into Castiel’s hair, twisting and smoothing until they’re both satisfied. Claire beams proudly when they’re done and snaps a photo with her phone.
They walk out to the kitchen, which looks like it hasn’t been tended to yet. There’s dirt and discolored grout where the stove should be, and the fridge is in need of a good scrubbing.
“And he was attempting to turn you into a bird?” Castiel says, touching one of the sigils drawn on Dean’s right side.
“I wanted Ezekiel for a boy, Claire for a girl.”
“Did you have something else in mind?”
At this, Dean falters, pulling back and looking down at Castiel with a bit of panic. Castiel startles, pulling his hands away.
Castiel takes his shirt off, and when Dean turns back around he’s holding three ties. Castiel is shocked, he had no idea Dean actually
Castiel sighs. Seriously, how is he not in pain with the way he’s sitting? “No, I didn’t. There is no progress to lose.”
Castiel makes some sort of grotesque growling burping sound, and Hannah rubs his back. “A few of his castmates blew into town this weekend, there was a lot of drinking. Our house looks like a bomb went off.”
“Holy shit, Dad.”
“I’m glad to know Claire has found such compassionate new friends. Well… if you three get hungry, there’s leftover macaroni and cheese, leftover pasta salad, leftover meatloaf, and leftover mashed potatoes…”
“Rent’s due on the first, but since that’s not that far away, I’m obviously not gonna expect you to pay for that.”
Dean’s not sure if Castiel means don’t stop fucking him, or don’t stop loving him, but either way he knows his answer.
at this place, Cas. You killed all our plants!”
“Party pooper.”
“Yes, I guess we are.” Castiel’s scowling like a child, which makes Dean feel better about how petty he’s being himself. “I…” Castiel looks away. “I saw Tessa a few days ago. She asked me if I had seen you.”
Castiel is often quiet, thoughtful, gentle. Dean thought that would be mirrored in the bedroom; it’s not. As soon as the door is closed he all but tosses Dean into the bed, crawling over him while Dean uses the toes of his right foot to pull off the sock on his left.
Castiel furrows his brows. “Why on
“I hope she hasn’t stolen the rest of my chocolates,” Castiel says.
And the movie is over, Castiel mutters “Have a good night, Dean,” and slips out of the row as quickly as he came.
“Kids called me ‘Dean the Ween’ the
After a few seconds, a gruff, annoyed voice comes on over the little speaker by the button panel. “Ed and Harry are gone, go check Ed’s mom’s house.”
Their hips press together once Castiel is on top of Dean, and Dean feels his lower half jerk with electricity when their cocks come into contact. Castiel is hard, and Dean wants… holy fuck does he ever want. He’ll even let Castiel keep those ugly fucking boxer briefs on while he fucks Dean if he wants.
“How much sex can
Castiel’s eyes trail down to Dean’s jeans, brows furrowed.
“You’re… are you alive?” Dean says, staring as his feet carry him toward the barn and the angel. The relief he feels is heady, and for a moment he feels like he might float away entirely.
To Cas - 8/04/17 - 11:47pm: that’s the spirit!!!!
(Tuesday, eight days later)
Dean yanks the laptop away from Castiel, hand brushing against Castiel’s downright shameful erection in the process.
“Holy shit.”
“Yeah, well yours are.... focused.”
“Really?”
After dinner, Dean unfortunately gets a call from Sam, who needs a jump on his car battery. Castiel is a
“Don’t,” Dean warns. “This isn’t— I just—”
“Ain’t love grand?” Sam says, a big dopey smile on his face.
“So… move it.”
“It’s just… we’re all in a period of adjustment right now, it’ll get easier.”
“Am not,” Dean lies, gritting his teeth when Castiel’s hand circles his dick, “I could go like this for hours.”
“But—”
” Dean groans, palming at Castiel’s backside. “Yeah. Yeah, okay.” He dips his thumb into Castiel’s body briefly, and Castiel can feel him getting into place behind him.
“It only seems that way because you grew up human. Angelic customs are just an unfamiliar culture.”
Castiel wakes alone in a comfortable bed. He hasn’t seen much of Dean’s room since he and Dean became acquainted, so he’s a bit surprised to be waking up in it. Dean must have carried Castiel in here after he fell asleep, which is… an appealing thought. He digs his phone out of the pocket of his slacks, noting that he managed to wake up five minutes before his alarm went off. He has a few texts from Claire that he missed last night, all of them about Claire wanting more mozzarella sticks. He smiles, shaking his head and pocketing his phone again as he takes in his surroundings. There are more of Dean’s paintings in here; a rosebush where each rose is painted with a palette one would more likely use for painting flames, snow falling on a desertscape, a koala playing a banjo. The eclectic mix of subjects makes Castiel feel warm.
“My face hurts.”
Dean shows Castiel how to make homemade mozzarella sticks and dipping sauce, and it’s very enjoyable. Dean is attentive and patient as he always is in the kitchen, but now it’s…
Except Dean did tell Benny to take the couch, but Benny has a bad back, he shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor. Nothing hinky there.
hands are spread over Castiel’s hips, and every time Castiel feels Dean’s beard against his thighs he feels electrified. Dean moves back so he can pull at Castiel’s pants and underwear until they’re around his knees then leans forward again, doing something
“I’d rather not, Meg.”
“Sorry, Dad.”
“Or you.”
good feeling about Gadreel, but…” Hannah sighs. “He’s a big fan of that show Dexter, and he wanted me to role play as— you know what? It’s not important.”
“A beekeeper.”
“Yeah, Dean of course, of course!” Sam’s doing that thing where he’s getting way too excited about the prospect of spending time with Dean. It makes Dean feel oddly guilty. “What made you want new clothes?”
There’s no music backing Dean, but it doesn’t matter. He sounds
lot like witchcraft, but apparently some things in the system need repairing first. They need new pipes or chicken feet or a virgin sacrifice; Dean wasn’t really listening because a fox was flapping its tail at him, but Castiel said all that can wait.
“Hey.”

“I feel… out of sorts. I suppose I have for months, but it didn’t really
“No, come on, they charge an arm and a leg for that shit.”
There’s a long pause, then the front door makes a beeping and clicking sound. Castiel tries the handle, and it opens.
“Get me out of here,” Castiel says mournfully, before letting Dean pull him out of his chair.

“Please.”

“It doesn’t have to be the

Everything’s the same as it was the last time; the water rippling yet still, the sky just overcast enough to make the sun feel less oppressive, the little tackle box by the camping chair.

“Eat me,” Dean hisses. He can’t help but stare, though. Those are two really good looking dudes. Castiel glances in their direction as they pass, and Dean feels his insides do some weird god damn shit when they make eye contact. Castiel seems to slow, but maybe that’s just in Dean’s head. Then he hears it.
much, so he looks for places on the lower end of the price spectrum. He finds one with fair prices and great reviews; Harvelle’s Roadhouse Diner.
It’s nearing the end of April. Number of screaming nightmares from Dean? Zero. Number of pointless dates Castiel has been on since March? Three. Number of times Castiel has walked in on Sam having sex in the basement laundry room? Also three, unfortunately.
“Well then, I’m glad I didn’t buy anything from him,” Castiel says.
and closes his mouth.
“You’re not what?” Dean’s lost. He wants to understand so he can fix this, but he
Dean finds his way into the kitchen while Castiel moves to what Dean assumes is his bedroom to continue the call.
“If you could wait until I’m out of earshot before insulting me to strangers, I would appreciate it,” Castiel says.
There are long stretches of time where Dean feels not at all present, more distracted by the sound of Castiel’s laugh, or the scent of ginger and cinnamon that seems to cling to him. Twice Dean loses track of the conversation because he’s too busy wondering what conditioner Castiel uses.
“Hey, don’t worry, it’s fine. I’m glad things worked out during your incredibly platonic conversation with your bro, man.”
“Uh… dunno. Bad breakup. Needed some distance, and my friend Charlie was here, so I moved in with her for a while, then I was on my own for a couple years, then Tessa… I go back to Lawrence a lot though, my brother and my mom live there.” Why is he telling his life story to this guy?
Wait, what? “You told me you ended up in sports because you’re a fucking groupie for numbers.”
“Hey now, I helped make those mozzarella sticks last night.”

“Dean Winchester brings you

“That’s… good. I’m glad you’re being responsible about this.”
Castiel shrugs. “We could?”

“Nonsense, I was happy with what we had.”
“Well congratulations, man. That’s awesome news. Calls for a celebration, in fact. I’m gonna make burgers tonight.”

And reads.
got him an eleven day stay in a psych ward, pumped full of drugs his malnourished body could barely handle.
Claire is still considering whether or not she’ll want to eventually tangle with things like hormones and surgeries, things to help her cope with what Jimmy’s read is called “gender dysphoria”. He’d tried reading up on the surgeries, but he got a bit overwhelmed and opted to worry about that later. Right now they can’t afford surgery anyway, and Claire decided she wanted to wait until her life was more settled before trying hormone replacement therapy that could throw her emotions into chaos. So, that’s all on the backburner. But what Jimmy
“He’s at the hardware store looking at paint samples, gonna work on that next weekend.”
Castiel kisses Dean again, but doesn’t say anything. He’s told Dean again and again that sometimes he doesn’t know how to respond, but that he always, always wants Dean to say what’s on his mind, even if he has no immediate answer.
To Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:29pm: you’re kidding. about what?
“I was uh… just coming to get Claire and Sam for dinner,” he mumbles.
“Crowley’s shit is overpriced and poorly made.”
When Castiel gets inside, Claire is at their dining table with what looks like a fresh bowl of cereal. When she looks up and sees Castiel she beams and shoves her bowl of cereal to the side.
” Castiel whines, “that’s why I tried to ask you!”
The woman groans. “Ugh, yes.” There’s a sound of fabric rustling, a thump, and then there’s a man whining for the woman to stop hitting him. “This is for you,” the woman grumbles.
“Well now you’ve seen me sitting on a bed covered in pizza boxes and beer cans, wearing my clothes inside out… I have to kill you.”
“My ass is cold,” Dean says. He starts to pull Castiel down on top of him, but Castiel doesn’t budge.
“Uh… yeah, I uh… I like singing. Used to sing in high school. Glee club.”
After a moment she turns her attention back to Castiel. “I’m sorry,” she says as Castiel takes his Advil. “There’s a lot of stuff I’ve worked through with Dr. Mills, and I forget that you don’t automatically just know about it.”
They’re not back five minutes before there’s a knock on the door. It’s Dean again, holding two medium-sized tupperware containers.
Dean nods. His heart sinks a little, at the thought of Castiel being gone that long, but three months is nothing… really.
“That’s actually a fair point. I guess most of our interacting has just been in daily texting sessions… uh… not that that’s
Tessa promised she’d let Dean tell their group about his sexuality in his own time, but sometimes these days Ketch looks at Dean with a little too much consideration, and Dean just fucking knows that he knows, and he’s being a judgy little fuck about it.
Back when Pamela first ditched Dean for Jesse, it took all of three weeks of seeing the happy couple around town for Dean to feel like he couldn’t be in Lawrence anymore. Looking back, Dean knows they never would have lasted, but at the time…
“No one says it po-tah-to,” Sam replies.
Dean spends his Sunday in bed, drinking beer, watching basic cable on the motel’s shitty television, and eating an entire stuffed crust pizza over the course of an afternoon. He receives seven texts from Charlie, two calls and one text from Jo, a text from Mick, and a link to a fucking kitten video from Ash. He doesn’t answer any of them. He doesn’t know what to say.
“You’re a friend of Castiel’s?”
Castiel doesn’t know what to do other than stare back. “I agree.”
“So, one important thing to know, Cas, is that not everybody likes anal sex. It might start off feeling weird, or awkward, or even painful, but it’s supposed to eventually feel good, and if it
Claire shakes her head vigorously. “No.
Castiel loops the tie around his neck to start the knot. “Do I want to look peppy?”
As often happens when Castiel is on his own, his thoughts have turned to Dean. Castiel’s attempts to branch out socially have less to do with him wanting to expand his social circle and more to do with Castiel being afraid that if he loses Dean, he’ll have no other friends.
“I feel the same way, Gabriel. Part of me believed you dead… until today.”
The woman laughs, sharp and genuine. “
“I thought I’d gotten over that need for him to think something of me, I really thought I had, but I was so fucking wrong. After that, I dropped out of school, I enlisted in the army.” Dean’s face is in his hands. “Fucking dumb, man. Not enlisting… but doing it for
“I have had time to cope,” Lucifer says. Dean has no idea if he’s being sarcastic.
“Come on, it’s funny!”
“Illinois,” Dean repeats. “It’s less than a day away.”
“Human relationships are all about compromise, Cas,” Dean says, pulling another sheet of gingerbread out of the fridge and popping it into the oven.
“Well, let’s see them?”
“He’s your dad, I dunno,” Dean says awkwardly.
“It’s a
he tells himself,
Cas. It could have taken you two, even three minutes to do what I accomplished in one. You were right to wait for help.”
? You lay a guilt trip on me and come back with that excuse?”
It’s gentle at first, but just at first. There’s sighing, slow rocking, Castiel trailing kisses along Dean’s jaw. Once Castiel works up a rhythm, once he works a little more lube in between them, the pace ramps up. Dean’s lost then, lost when Castiel grabs him by the meat of his thighs to hold him open, lost at the sporadic, electric contact with his prostate. His hips are rocking of their own accord, desperate, like if he stops moving Castiel will too. Silly, but he can’t fucking help it.
Castiel stares at Dean, aghast. “I… what? No?”
“So…” Castiel taps his spoon on his cereal bowl.
Those moments all pale in comparison to that first touch of Castiel’s lips, the stunned and relieved noise he makes against Dean’s mouth. There’s no hesitation at that moment, his arms immediately wrap around Dean, one hand smoothing from Dean’s back to grip the back of his hair. There’s a bit of shuffling and shifting and then Castiel’s all the way on his back, one jean clad leg wrapped around Dean’s waist. Castiel kisses like he does nearly everything else he’s passionate about; with focus, with precision, with his entire being.
“You anglin’ for a tip, sweetheart?” Dean says, grinning.
It’s hard, watching Sam sob, grieve, and stand alone in a corpse filled barn, but Dean does. After two minutes, though, Sam is straightening his back; face a mask of tear-plastered determination.
“I was watching you through the peephole, and…. you looked terrified, man.”
“Unless you need to spend some time alone with your bear friend.”
you look like shit.”
He lies on the forest floor, sweating, dirty, and cursing himself for ever leaving Sam’s basement. Dirt and pine needles are clinging to every part of him, and he’s cold but overheated at the same time.
“If you ever get married again,” Claire says around a mouthful of burger, “let it be to him.”
“So?”
“My apologies,” Castiel says from his place on the sidewalk, “I was just admiring your choice of plants.”
you know what I mean.”
?” Dean asks, trying not to overtly gawk at Castiel and figure out where he’d lose weight from. He looks
Sam rolls his eyes. “Yeah, but you had like this life altering experience with him, and you said you’d probably go see him again, I thought you’d… you know. Made a friend.”
“Cool,” Dean says, moving his fingers apart inside Castiel.
Right at this moment though, Castiel isn’t doing any brainstorming. He’s not writing lists of angel names, or scribbling out arguments between Jody and Donna over who gets to drive, or deciding if Claire and Alex would carry guns. He’s not even watching the snow fall onto the vast Oregon forest just outside his bedroom window.
“You’re gonna be with me, Cas, things are gonna get vulgar.
There’s something… odd about Castiel’s time at the store. There’s a strained dynamic between Dean and John that Castiel can’t quite put his finger on. There’s love there, certainly… but there’s also this energy that’s sad and guilty. Perhaps they have a past rift that hasn’t quite mended. Castiel is very curious, but asking about it is of course out of the question. Instead, Castiel asks about something that is equally none of his business.
“Yeah, I guess not. But he’s gonna be grilling steaks and pouring beers.”
making this about himself. That certainly won’t do. “You're right, Claire, you're right. Well, I’m still sorry.”
“I’m just trying to spare you from a future of constipation.”
“Because it’s the fucking weekend, and I came to your apartment because I thought I’d surprise you and take you and maybe Tessa to lunch?”
“Look, it’s not my fault if the nuances of modern dating are lost on you, sweet cheeks.”
“Go put your mouth on his mouth.”
Who would trust a man perched upon a bloodstained throne?
Castiel stares at the phone, not saying a damn thing.
To Cas - 8/25/17 - 9:33am: fine if you don’t care about spelling just keep calling it selfy like a FOOL
“Sounds like you’ve really thought this through,” James says, rolling their eyes.
“Hey!” Sam says, coming into the room. “Is that a dick?”
Castiel chuckles, something sad and humorless. “Yes. He sent one package to one family member four years ago, and when I didn’t reply, he simply let it go.”
Ewwwwwwww.

“It’s
“For me or for her?”
“Dean, I’m on
Dean looks up from where he’s trying to get the ladder in a secure place. There’s a man standing there. He’s in his forties, with dark hair, green eyes, and a confused expression.
Tessa sighs with what sounds suspiciously like relief. Her eyes are watering too. “Okay. So… so we’re on a break now.”
so he’s just going to be cold. He wraps his arms tightly around himself, staring up into the dark tree branches he can make out with light from some streetlights in the area. It’s not as quiet as Sam’s backyard; there’s distant traffic, and someone a few houses away has their television up really loud, but it becomes white noise after a few minutes.
“Okay, bring us your weird sweet potato pizza,” Dean says, sulking slightly. “There’s
The next few weeks pass quickly. Claire finally gets to a point where she feels caught up in school, and Castiel isn’t generating enough office gossip to warrant the partners’ interest. He goes on a couple of “friend dates” with Meg, who has entered into a romantic relationship with her dominatrix roommate. Claire has a counselor she sees every Monday, and Castiel just spent a distressing amount of money on a salon trip for her to get her extensions replaced, or adjusted, or tightened, or whatever it is that happens to hair extensions.
From Cas - 8/11/17 - 4:24pm: I have people to do that sort of thing for me.
“I apologize,” Castiel says gently, “I had no idea I’d caused any trouble at all.”
Henry doesn’t end up spilling Claire’s private business to anyone. Castiel has no idea why, but he’s also not sure it’s his place to ask, either. Claire’s resilience is remarkable. Within a few days she seems to have forgotten the incident for the most part. Castiel certainly didn’t bounce back so easily when he was her age, and he wasn’t dealing with anything like what she’s going through. He knows Claire’s afraid sometimes. If they go somewhere new, Claire is apprehensive about using the bathroom. Sometimes she hunches in on herself near groups of men. More than once Claire has seen a story about a trans woman being attacked or worse and had to skip school for a mental health day. But for the most part, she’s content. By the time summer comes, she’s down to seeing her therapist only twice a month.
“Maybe?” Dean sets the bear back on Castiel’s stomach and takes one of the chocolates. Damn, that was the last raspberry creme.
Someone starts clapping, and Castiel turns to see Gabriel leaning against the wall, grinning. He’s in cargo shorts again, but he does have shoes on this time. Well, sandals. He’s also managed to find a t-shirt that matches his toenails.
“I’m journaling,” Castiel says blandly.
“I don’t know how to respond to that.”
Dean grins, taking Castiel’s hand in his. His hand is sweaty as fuck, but all Castiel does is squeeze and hold tight. “Well okay then, let’s get started.”
understand what Castiel is getting at. Dean’s had artistic blocks plenty of times, it always passes. It can be annoying, even make Dean restless, but it’s never been like whatever Castiel is going through.
“Oh God. Oh sweet Jesus. Oh heavenly Cthulu, if Arthur Ketch is one of those ‘same sex is only okay when it’s women’ assholes… grant me the fucking strength.” Okay,
They’re still sleeping in the tent, because the house isn’t
“Sam…”
Dean grabs Castiel’s hand and pulls him in the direction of the stairwell as the elevator doors close. Castiel has an odd and intense urge to lace their fingers together which he ignores until Dean lets go.
When Dean comes in through the back door, Castiel is seated at the kitchen table, clutching a cup of coffee tighter than Dean held onto that damn life raft in the ocean. His hair is in disarray, there are dark circles under his eyes, and he doesn’t seem to have noticed Dean walking in and standing next to him.
, and even beyond that there are plenty of guys that date and just do hand and mouth stuff, and that’s okay.”
Dean, I’m certain I can tighten a hinge without anything catching fire.” Castiel’s glaring as he speaks, and Dean can’t help but smile. That “they’re my annoying family but I love them” shit always tugs at Dean’s heartstrings.
about helping Dean pay what he can’t cover. Sam is fucking weird. Dean gets it though, he does. Dean’s back, and the “novelty” hasn’t exactly worn off. Sam’s excited to have his brother back, and Dean understands, which is why he lets Sam talk him into going out to dinner after they’re done shopping. And a movie after dinner. And then they go out to play pool and have rumless Rum-and-Cokes.
“We should
tired but happy,” Dean says, exhausted. “Had a good Thursday with my brother, guess that feeling is still sticking with me even after a long-ass bus ride.”
“Here? Like, Wichita?”
“Yeah,” Dean mutters, and his voice cracks, his voice fucking
“Exactly. What about you?”
“No way, this is way more orange than that. This is prescription bottle orange, I feel like if I reach inside I’m going to come back with a handful of Xanax.”
but he thought the point was— okay no, if this is what Tessa wants, might as well go for it.
“This is a sore spot for you.”
“I’m waiting for inspiration to strike.”
“Really?”
“Thought you could talk to animals,” Dean says, nudging Castiel with one elbow.
Castiel toes off his sneakers, then crouches to pull off his socks.
“I want to tell you that it’ll be fine, but you know I can’t promise—”
Dean nods, somber.
“Damn, Cas.”
Castiel folds his arms petulantly. “Please do be on your way then.”
“We’re fine, everything is fine,” Castiel says, even as he’s bleeding all over Kaia’s shirt. “I ran into the wall trying to escape an uncomfortable moment and have created an even worse one.”
“Where are you from, what’s your birth name, are you on the run from the police…”
James nods. “I knew it. I
“Maybe I’m sick,” Castiel says halfheartedly.
“I-I apologize, I know with women it can be untoward to… to… but you don’t
Castiel smiles. “Not if you’re expecting me to take them off myself.”
“He lives!” Victor shouts when he answers his phone.
“I’ll remind you,” James says. “It’s okay if you slip up, Dad. The fact that you’re willing to try, that’s… that means the world to me.”
It was more than fine. It was incredible. Dean hasn’t gone more than an hour without thinking about it for three fucking days.
Dean almost puts the M&M’s back before he remembers he’s thirty-six years old and can do whatever the hell he wants. “You’re just jealous.”
“Now,” Dean says, walking to his closet, “shirt off.”

how much we had to pay Brady when their little tryst blew up.”
“I keep feeling like I was humiliated when that kiss happened, even though I wasn’t. I feel like a fool. My boyfriend kissed another man in front of me.”
“Uh… Tessa kind of stopped watching the show, so…”
“Yeah, I know. But in the meantime, I’d rather not deal with a bunch of people that knew me before…
It’s practical.
“Your brother has
Moondork: Howdy ho!
“A turkey shaped like your hand?”
Victor lets out a guffaw. “It’s a

From Cas - 8/07/17 - 3:51pm: That’s what I heard from my manager. I’m unbelievably touched.
Definitely not today, but some day.
I can do this alone.”
“Please don’t.”
Castiel would love to disagree, but it would be a lie. He and Amelia learned early on that their personal idea of what was “sin” didn’t quite match up. No marriage is perfect. Eventually they learned what topics were best left not discussed. Amelia wouldn’t begrudge Castiel’s more liberal beliefs so long as Claire was brought up in Amelia’s church. It hadn’t seemed so bad at the time, but if Castiel knew then what he knows now, he’d never have agreed to it.
“What, Meg? That was four years ago.”
“I guess that’s true,” Dean says, fidgeting with Castiel’s toes. He has cute pinky toes.
“It’s from last year.”
three sizes too small.
He hears someone sigh behind him.
“I’ll take it. So, um… what’s up?”
Dean’s halfway to Wichita when he starts getting the intense urge to turn back and change his clothes again. What the fuck is he wearing? He looks like he works at the fucking GAP or some shit. There’s no time to turn around, though. Dean blew too much time changing his clothes, fixing his hair, and arguing with Sam.
Castiel sighs in genuine contentment. “It is.”
Tessa definitely looks different, though. Her medium length hair has inexplicably grown several inches, and she’s wearing a soft, simple looking white dress that Dean’s never seen before. She smiles when she sees him staring at her hair.
From Cas - 8/14/17 - 11:14am: Believe it or not, laying around my sister’s house all day isn’t very fulfilling.
“Yeah, we’re not going to Crowley’s Furniture.”
“Holy shit,” Dean says, scrubbing a hand over his face, “this is

To Cas - 8/23/17 - 12:46am: assbutt?

“Given this some thought?”
“What were they like?”
“Alright, yeah, that one’s on me. But to be fair, Malachai is a dick, and him shitting his pants was hilarious. Come on, kiddo. Catharsis is good for the soul. I’ll keep my yap shut.”
Damn it. “It’s not the same!” Dean insists.
“Charlie, what the

nice to look at.
“Dean?”
Castiel gets in immediately, pulling the door closed with a relieved sigh.
“Why not? You’re rich, you’re hot, you’re on TV!”
“Mmm, yes,” Castiel says. He sits up, then turns over so he can get onto his hands and knees. “I wanted to try… like this.”
“Do I get any points for not telling anyone where you were?”
“I think you’d look fucking
“Yes.”
He really, really wishes he hadn’t shown up dressed like a software engineer or whatever.
Castiel smiles again. “I rather like the beard.”
“Holy shit,” he says, eyeing Castiel’s gift basket, “I guess I don’t have to ask how your day went.”
I actually got to eat some pie.”
“Because we’re not broken, we’re scuffed,” Dean adds, nudging Castiel with his elbow.
” Claire says, nudging Castiel’s hand on the table.
“Hey…” Dean says as the door opens, jaw slowly dropping.
“Love you Cas,” Dean whispers. Castiel has stopped moving, but Dean picks up the slack, holding onto Castiel’s hips and rocking up into him.
At first Dean thinks it’s one of those giant fucking flies from the island; they’re loud, especially when they’re right near Dean’s ear. It’s his phone though, vibrating on the floor next to him.
“His name is not actually Dr. Sexy, Dean.”
“Cool. See you in a few hours, Cas. And get some fresh air. Go for a walk or something,” Dean adds, voice a bit harsh.
Castiel closes his eyes as he often does when he’s trying to paw through eons of memories. “I recall being sore and tired, as there were no sins to feed on to rejuvenate me, and I recall pride in the work I’d done… however I don’t recall the soreness and the pride being linked.”
“Actually no, I didn’t know that.”
. You said you were going to relax about this. We’re checking this place out, and
“You’re kidding.”
“Nothing, I merely didn’t know if Dean was interested in men,” Ketch says, voice even.
John grimaces. “Whoops.”

” Dean says, “you’re cool to hang with, it’d be cool if we could do it again sometime, even if I’m possibly temporarily relocating a couple hours to the north.”
Castiel beams, that same smile Dean saw before The Empty came to claim him. “I’m happy for me too. But… for all Jack suffered under Billie’s plans, he has opted to keep much of her rules in place. We cannot manifest to the living, and I could not interfere with your death.”
Castiel sighs happily, enjoying the feeling of Dean’s lips on his skin. To have this love freely given, to know Claire is safe and happy when less than a year ago the two of them were uncertain and miserable in a lonely apartment back in Illinois... Castiel feels truly blessed.
Dean gags just imagining how that would taste. “Speaking of soy sauce in coffee… well not really, but I hope you’re hungry. Sammy’s making chicken fingers.”
and you let Jo name five from Avengers!” Dean grouses. “Okay Morena Baccarin, Gina Torres…” Dean pauses, because he really
“Yeah, that doesn’t surprise me. He hates his birthday. You know how some people are. He’s gonna hate this, and the fact that I’m gonna drag him out for dinner and bowling later, but he’ll live.”
On his way back, Castiel passes a house with over a dozen small cacti lining the walkway. He slows, pausing to admire the plants. It’s a clever choice, seeing as the things won’t be needing much water.
“Don’t get him anything too fancy… he gets real awkward about it. Aim for thoughtful over impressive.”
THE END
Jimmy pauses in pouring the cereal into bowls. “Oh?”
“That’s what I
“I’m sorry that you have such a present reminder of that terrible experience,” Castiel says softly.
The bus Dean’s taking this time leaves at around three in the morning, and since the idea of walking that far in the middle of the night kind of freaks Dean out, he gets a ride from Sam.
Castiel sighs, leaning against Dean and letting Dean guide him toward the Impala. “Very well.”
Castiel assumes they are the “Harry and Ed” that Sam spoke of before, so he presses the buzzer.
They rut against each other, artless,
” Amelia says, slapping her hand down on the brochure lying on the counter. “He’ll get better, and be
“We’re not doing that.”
“You knit?” Meg’s grinning. Castiel likes how often she smiles.
The more Castiel’s tongue rubs against his, the more Dean wants to get his pants all the way off so he can spread his legs wide, let Castiel right in. He can’t though, not without stopping to take his boots off, and that sounds like something that would take far too long. So he rocks up against Castiel, and Castiel does the same, still kissing Dean, making all sorts of incredible soft grunts and groans as they move together. Fuck it’s good, it’s so good, but Dean wants just a little more. He reaches down, making sure not to break their kiss, and he wraps a hand around them both, holding their cocks together tight.
Dean recoils. Or he would if he felt like moving. “No way, I earned this.”
On the drive out of Wichita, Dean finds himself driving past Tessa’s apartment out of habit, which is vaguely amusing until he notices Ketch’s motorcycle in his parking space as he goes. His heart sinks just a little, but he keeps driving.
“A good
Dean freezes, completely caught off guard. They’re standing in Castiel’s room, towels wrapped around their waists. Castiel sits on his bed with a weary sigh and looks up at Dean.
“We’re from the midwest too, just came from Illinois,” Castiel says.
” Mick says, almost too enthusiastically. Victor walks over with a pitcher of beer, filling everyone’s glasses then looking around expectantly.
“I bet. Kaia, get a wet washcloth. Claire, do you have any tampons…” Dean grimaces. “Or, uh… Kaia.”
“Is it customary to
Castiel steps a bit closer. “Me too.”
“Thanks, man, but… I’m getting out of here for a while.”
“What
They’ve been out for two weeks. A werewolf hunt just outside Tulsa, a shapeshifter in Omaha, a wendigo that’s somehow ended up in Flathead National Forest.
Castiel smiles. “I assure you, there is no pranking going on.”
“I’ve gotta warn you though,” Dean says, smiling, “starting to expect fireworks after all.”
“I can’t believe out of the two of us
“Yeah, it means—”
they’re not ripping my shit apart.”
! He called him a—” Hael pauses, eyes wide. “Well, I’m not allowed to say that word.”
It’s fine, though. Life is still good, Castiel is still very glad to be in Jasperville. Claire is doing wonderfully in school, despite the fact that she seems to spend all of her free time with her friends or on the phone with Kaia. Castiel’s branching out a little himself, too. He goes jogging with Meg some mornings, and last week he went to a movie with Sam, the Rubys, and Sam’s co-worker Jo. He had a great time, despite being at least five years older than everyone else. He went to a St. Patrick’s Day party with people from work and enjoyed himself… even got a great video of Gabriel doing body shots off the usually straight-laced Naomi. He went on another date, this time with Meg’s friend Lilith. It was terrible, because evidently Meg has terrifying friends, but at least Castiel gave it a shot. Plus Meg was eventually able to retrieve the wallet and keys Lilith stole from him, so all’s well that ends well, in Castiel’s opinion.
“I’m not. Well, not really. Kaia and Kevin and Alex and Patience all know, but I haven’t told anyone else. As far as most people know, I’m just the B in LGBT… but yeah I told my friends a couple weeks ago. Totally cool, totally lowkey. And like I said, I thought my body type would be a deal breaker, but
know.
There’s a moment when Dean is twisting the brush in Castiel’s hand, showing him the right angle to hold it, and there’s a little tingle, a
Something is building between them, building fast. It’s a little scary, it’s not as though Dean’s had feelings for someone recently. And Castiel is… new. Important. Someone Dean wants to keep around. He’s already thought about introducing Castiel to Sam, they’d probably have a lot in common, like World of Warcraft, and being functioning members of society… fuck what if Castiel likes Sam better? Is he going to have to compete with Sam for Castiel’s fucking attention?
“What did you want to be when you were a kid?”
“I’ll fight you for him,” Charlie says.
“Wichita is not Canada or California, that’s true… though I don’t understand why that needed to be stated.”
“But I have… I have these
“Thank you for letting us know,” Castiel says.
white stitching along the edge. It’s horrific.
Dean glares and steals the bag of Cheetos Charlie is holding. “Do you want to be on my shitlist too?”
Castiel turns. “Dean.” There’s a bright red spot on Dean’s cheek where Sam slapped him.
He reads one of the G-rated stories, then another, then another.

Moondork: Fine, ruin my fun. When do I get to meet him, anyway?
you know? But I also kind of never want to see her again. It’s confusing.”
“I don’t know if I’d call it that…”
“Hey,” he says, sauntering over with his hot chocolate in one hand, phone in the other, “how much you think the tabloids would give me for this pic?”
The first thing Castiel’s eyes are drawn to is the pentagram tattooed over Dean’s heart, surrounded by a circle of flame. It’s thick and dark, so it’s natural for the eye to go there first. If not for the tattoo, he’d have noticed right away. All over Dean’s chest and stomach, scars. Meticulously made symbols Castiel recognizes from studies in his youth. There are a few slashes and gashes, but the sigils stand out more.
to himself, he told Henriksen about the damn chess pieces, after all.
“I know. I retain vetoing power. But I want to see what you come up with. You’re my
It’s the first time either of them have said that name in ages… Castiel is surprised at how disconnected he feels from it.
“Very well. Yes, she got my penis in her mouth.”
He reads out loud from The Fellowship of the Ring for five minutes, maybe less before Claire interrupts. “Do you think I’m going to Hell, Dad?”
,” Castiel says, “it just came so naturally at the moment, and I... I feel like we skipped something important there.”
“They’re not
Castiel shrugs. Dean can see something in his expression, though it’s hard to be sure in this light. He thinks he sees something like fear, though. Maybe sadness.
Valentine’s Day rather sneaks up on Castiel, until Claire comes home late the night before, squeaking and squealing and screeching incoherently.
To Cas - 8/11/17 - 4:37pm: that’s the worst thing anyone has ever fucking texted me, thanks
“Right.”
“Yeah.”
Castiel groans. “Yes, they absolutely will.”
Dean’s never lived with a romantic partner before. Things never quite got to that level with his other exes, except with Pamela, but Pamela kept putting things off, then she cheated on Dean with her ex, then she broke up with Dean. They’ve made their peace since then. Dean more or less forgave Pamela for cheating, Pamela more or less forgave Dean for burning her favorite leather jacket. They even talk if they spot each other when Dean’s in Lawrence. But, it’s fair to say that some of Dean’s insecurity and jealousy stems from that time of broken trust, years ago.
“Dean,” Castiel all but whimpers.
He sees Sam’s face in the display picture, so he answers. “Hey.”
“Yeah, that.”
now?”
. Castiel groans, body tensing as it starts rushing toward an orgasm. He’s getting loud, he knows, but it’s hard to control when he feels this good. He comes with a shout, one arm and both legs wrapped around Dean, head thrown back, body shuddering. Dean buries his face in Castiel’s neck, growling out a few choice curses and biting down as his body jerks forward, hard. The sensation of Dean’s teeth in Castiel’s skin pulls a full body shudder out of him, and he groans again, letting his eyes fall closed.
Cas.”
Cas,” Dean says, unzipping the tent.
“Call me, maybe…” Castiel says, eyebrows furrowed.
“Even when it’s swimming in mayonnaise?”
It’s about a week later when Castiel comes home to find Blonde Ruby sitting at the table, looking somberly at Claire. Claire’s right hand is submerged in a bowl of ice water. There are scrapes and bruises on the left side of her face.
“I have no earthly idea. She told me to pick her up at seven, and to dress sexy. How do I dress sexy? How did you dress on your date?”
“No, it’s not. I gotta talk to Benny here, but… but that’s no excuse, alright? I’m sorry,” he says with so much feeling that Castiel can’t help but feel soothed.
Dean snorts. “Have you ever tried to watch Showgirls sober?”
“You don’t like
“It was actually the easiest thing I did all day. One nail.”
Castiel snorts. “Believe it or not, Dean, I’m not all that concerned with what others think of my masculinity.”
“Leftovers!” Kaia and Kevin cheer in unison.
are you doing here?”
“We were best friends in high school. He was the one that talked me into going to college when you were three… so I could get a better job. He helped watch you, helped me study… and now… now I’m the person he runs away from in public. I won’t be sad to leave… all my friends think I failed you by not sending you to Indiana, this town is full of… reminders of a life that I no longer fit into.” Castiel belatedly realizes sharing this information might be putting an unfair burden on Claire. Wow, he really
“Not at present.”
“No, nothing happened. I just hate how he looks at her, and I hate how he doesn’t give a shit about how god damn obvious he’s being. It doesn’t matter that nothing’s happening between them, he’s still being a dick.”
“Hmm, sounds good… can I?”

“The hell was

“Well, I can’t promise to stop panicking about this, but I promise to try. A break sounds… really good.”

“I did.”
“Well, I definitely don’t see you doing that. I see you doing something sweet and quiet, like teaching sixth grade or selling flowers.”
He pulls over at a 7-11 in Topeka so he can get out his phone and make a call.
He opens the door, heart doing a dumb flip at the sight of Castiel standing there holding a plastic grocery bag and a laptop. He’s wearing jeans and a Comic-Con t-shirt, hair messy around the pair of aviator sunglasses on top of his head.
“I’m your father, I’m meant to protect you, not—”
“It’s ridiculous, really. When I was younger I had quite the tolerance, but… years of filming and avoiding alcohol and the empty calories that came with… I didn’t drink all that often the past few years.”
But even with the downsides, it’s worth it. It’s a strange, imperfect setup they’ve got going so far, but for the most part, it’s pretty awesome.
“So? I got it back for you, didn’t I?”
“Ruse…?” Dean says, stepping aside to let Castiel in.
this. And finally I was into a guy that wasn’t an aloof prick, I wanted to chase that, and not have it fall apart. But the thing is, every relationship falls apart until you find the one that doesn’t. And us staying together, that was just holding us both back from finding the one that sticks.”
“Yeah, just uh… one second.” Castiel darts back into the apartment to grab the wrapped gift off the coffee table, then follows Dean into his apartment.

Hey, you had an interview today right? How’d it go?”
“No.”
“I wouldn’t say Gabriel likes me either.”
“Be honest.”

Castiel bends down to kiss at Dean’s neck. It’s cold as fuck out, but Dean’s warm all over. “I thought you wanted to shed some inhibitions with this act, beloved.”
Castiel chuckles, rocking against Dean even though he can’t possibly get any deeper. His wings flex and fan out before curling forward and surrounding them, blocking Dean’s view.

This man has
Castiel strolls through his neighborhood awed at the differences and similarities to the somewhat wealthy, conservative chunk of Pontiac he lived in with Amelia. The most comforting thing he notices is how many people have LGBT pride decals on their cars, and even rainbow flags in some windows. The lawns are mostly dead and unwatered, which Castiel knows is for conservation reasons, but the homes are lovely and varied.
Instead, Dean’s just looking at the server’s retreating form. “She forgot to take our drink orders, man.”
“Well the boy is gay, so I’m thinking Dean has a better shot,” Billie says, reaching over to pat Tessa’s knee when Tessa starts pouting.
“I didn’t know I even had the ingredients for this.”
“Then Amelia… you need to understand that this…” Jimmy puts one hand on the brochure. “This is not what is best for him… for them.”
Thank you to everyone for your comments as I posted chapter after chapter the past few weeks, I know I rarely respond, but I always read them, I'm always jazzed to see those notification e-mails. Finding out a chapter had someone laughing their way to an asthma attack or hearing about a couple reading my fic together, or learning the story cheered someone up on a bad day, that always means the world to me. I don't say that enough, how grateful I am.
Castiel shrugs. “I didn’t either.” He swings his legs off the desk and stands, padding over to the couch with his notebook and pen in hand. His jeans have an ink stain on one thigh in the shape of Mickey Mouse. How’d that happen?
“Well, I don’t have any ailments you should be aware of. Do
From Cas - 8/18/17 - 7:27pm: Of course. You’re a close friend, Dean.
“Dean?” Castiel says, voice tiny and afraid.
Claire beams at Castiel, her expression full of pride. “Kaia and Kevin are in most of my classes, they’re going to help me play catch up over the next few days.”
Interesting. Dean had no idea his girlfriend was into the guy from Halo Project. “Who else is on your list, Tess?”
Castiel sighs, willing his erection to retreat and heading to the bathroom to wash his hands.
Castiel is silent for a long moment. “But they
“Yeah, yeah.”
“If you’re hungry, Dean left you some garlic bread in the kitchen,” Sam says. “
“Yeah, well it’s protocol. I’m sorry I scared you, Cas… I can’t control it.”
He’s not sure how much time has passed, but he’s no longer warm and sweaty, and his heart isn’t racing, so it must have been a while. Good Lord, Dean is heavy.
“I’ve won every arm wrestling challenge you’ve issued.”
“I could eat it.”
“You built this?” Dean says, looking the place over. Sure, it’s a mess, but it’s more than Dean could do.
Lucifer grins salaciously. “My money’s on boyfriend.”
Dean can almost hear the eye roll. “I’ll see you in an hour, Dean.”
“That week they talked about Hell in Sunday school, and Pastor Raphael forgot he was talking to
Dean looks surprised, then he smiles, just a little. “Oh.”
It feels like it takes forever for Castiel to remember to open his mouth and respond. “You named your car Baby?”
“He wasn’t interested in anything I had to say, he asked if I could introduce him to Kelvin, and at the end of the date he assumed I’d be paying because I’m an actor, and asked me to sign something for his sister.”
“Is that a no?”

They lie there, hands joined between them, and it’s all Dean needs to fall asleep.
“Just trying to, uh… calm down.”
Dean chooses a motel far away from Castiel’s neighborhood, far away from his own neighborhood, the Palm Motel. It’s not the nicest motel, but there are no bed bug related reviews on Yelp, which means it’s good enough for Dean. He tosses his bag of clothes on the floor, sets the duffel containing his other shit on the table, and goes right to sleep.
“Ah… a breakup. We… my ex and I... had many mutual friends. His group had become my group, but when we broke up, it became pretty clear that they were still
“They don’t smoke around you, do they?” Castiel says from his chair.
“Yep.”
Claire is on the couch when Castiel comes inside, cell phone in one hand, chocolate in the other. She grimaces, moving to set the chocolate back down.
To Cas - 8/18/17 - 7:24pm: really?
“You okay?” Dean says, sounding a little out of breath.
“Worth it though, right?” Blonde Ruby says, winking.
After some scrubbing and shampooing, Dean follows Castiel downstairs, wrapped in Castiel’s plush blue robe. Castiel is wearing sweatpants and no shirt, so Dean gets to stare at the hickey he left like a possessive high schooler. They gather their discarded clothing from the steps as they come down, giggling like kids. Dean feels like he could float away on this giddy feeling.
“Oh. Well, I have this great big crush on Kaia, and… but I was never going to make a move because she’s a lesbian, and I worried the uh… parts I have would be a deal breaker, you know? Because for some people they are, and honestly I was afraid to find out if she was one of those people... but she's not!
where their fingers are touching. Static electricity without the static. Dean looks at Castiel, and Castiel stares at Dean, and then they both let the moment fall away and continue painting, just like that.
“You know I do.”

“Well, no one’s stormed out,
trust you, and you don’t trust me either.”
“In the interview, you failed to mention that the four of you would be betting on whether or not I’m gay.”
Castiel’s hand suddenly flies to his mouth, eyes wide. “

how did you— why are you—
To Cas - 8/11/17 - 4:25pm: really???
“I got it!” he says, waving his keys, “I’m on it!”
Dean, meanwhile, has narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “You think I can’t tell when someone’s giving me a fake name, kid?”
It’s perfect, and when he comes, perched on his kitchen counter, legs wrapped around Castiel’s waist, he’s powerless to look anywhere but into Castiel’s eyes.
“You’ve been good about helping me get used to my name, I was thinking I should do the same.”
“A breakup that I handled kind of terribly. I mean I know that’s not the same as losing your footing in the world but…”
is out there somewhere. They’ll cling to it for dear life, and when they wash up on an uninhabited island with nothing but plane debris, unopened FedEx packages, and a waterlogged corpse to keep them company, they’ll keep going for as long as they can. They’ll keep going until their body gives in or their mind gives up.
Castiel turns toward him, looking confused. “Way better? They are virtually the same show, minus the title character making the unrealistic choice of wearing cowboy boots inside a
“Or I could pull some strings, get you a temporary gig at the studio.”
Dean smirks. “Guess I’d better find out for sure.”
The man turns a little, just enough for Dean to see— oh, for crying out loud, it’s Castiel Novak. Fuck, Dean’s never going to hear the end of this. “Not goin’ for

to you?” Dean says, feeling like it’s better for both of them if he doesn’t address that.
Castiel breathes a small sigh of relief. “Thank you, Dean.”
He’s ashamed, even if Sam doesn’t say anything judgmental when Dean comes crawling out of his tent in the morning. He’s ashamed that he can’t just sleep in a bed or a couch, he’s ashamed to have this weird habit, the most obvious sign of his baggage that he’s too embarrassed to even tell his therapist about. But the shame doesn’t change the fact that it’s easier to sleep this way, so once again Dean finds himself lying on his back in Castiel’s backyard, eyes on the branches of the slippery elm tree he’s underneath.
“Well, I started thinking about—”
James takes Jimmy’s hand, and the smile Jimmy gets is so
“I don’t know. I only had the one reference for our application, and do we even
Castiel sighs.
“You look really, really good like this, Cas,” Dean says. The bed dips on the right, and then Dean’s lips are pressing against Castiel’s, tender at first, then a little more demanding, then his tongue is in Castiel’s mouth and Castiel jerks in his simple restraints, body pulsing with want as he’s reminded that he can’t sit up, can’t put his arms around Dean, can’t
“Awww, he’s just looking out for you.”
“Holy shit.”
so it’s going to be a cold day in some dusty old cabin that’s probably covered in cobwebs and full of raccoons. Is this
“Alright,” Dean says, voice taking on the tone he gets when he’s teaching Castiel to cook, “remember what I said before, you gotta tell me when you don’t like something. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t like it, it’s not even the end of the night. Like I said, I’m a
“Pretty good,” Dean says. Fuck, he’s fucking tired.
“Regardless, my intentions are platonic. You’ve mentioned not getting out much, so I understand if you’d rather not…”
Dean’s suddenly a fan of slow news days.
“We heard there was an apartment for rent?”
God, it’s weird joking about
Dean starts up his car and drives away as fast as he can.
“Yes!” Claire cheers, pumping her fist into the air.
“That’s wonderful, Castiel.”
“You talking about the neighborhood, or me?”
Dean would stare at that decal for hours during the day, when he wasn’t crying over the old photo of his parents in his wallet, or the picture of Sam at his high-school graduation, or the handmade coupon for “one free kiss” that Lisa had given him on their last Valentine’s Day together, or his own ID. That dove had places to go, but it was there on the island with Dean, waiting for… something. Death, probably.
did she do your homework
Sex with Castiel is always incredible. There’s a grace, a surety there that often doesn’t exist outside the bedroom… or tent, and although Dean has grown to truly love the sometimes awkward, emotional, and uncertain man that Castiel often is, he sure as shit enjoys the intense and confident version as well. Dean’s heart is already beating hard, his toes already curling and cramping. He always comes so fucking fast when he bottoms. Castiel knows it, too, and he chuckles into Dean’s hair as Dean’s moans start turning higher and lighter.
“Can we just... forget about Friday? The past few days have been miserable, and I miss you… can we forget about it?”
“Oh we’re so not going there. Forget it.”
Claire.”
“But Chuck—”
“I was gonna.”
“I don’t suppose he moonlights as a delivery boy?”
Castiel frowns. “I suppose that depends on your definition of troubling. I certainly don’t have a criminal past, if that’s what you mean.”
The journey up the stairs takes a long time, there’s a lot of kissing and clothes shedding along the way. By the time they actually stagger into the guest room Castiel sleeps in, they’re both down to their underwear, and Dean’s only wearing one sock. Castiel is wearing long boxer briefs that are an absolutely eye-searing shade of orange, but Dean can barely speak let alone form a sentence that would enable him to give Castiel shit about them.
Oh, oh
“Well,” Castiel says, looking… sad, maybe. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate the ride. The one time I don’t bring my phone with me, and… anyway, thank you.”
Dean’s voice is thick with restrained rage; Castiel can tell he’s the type to be fiercely protective of his family.
“Claire made it,” Castiel says, heart warming at the way Dean so carefully detaches the bow and sets it aside.
“Hello, Dean.”
Castiel looks a bit guilty at that. “Just need to perk up with this coffee… that I made yesterday.”
“You were gonna. Dean you’re in your fucking thirties, this running away from home during a breakup shit isn’t cute anymore.”
“No you didn’t.”
Castiel gently turns the sandwich over. Golden brown on one side, now the other… “And you like it?”
“Yeah, well I’ll tell him I was late because my boyfriend broke his fucking face,” Dean says. He winces. “Uh, not…
Dean smiles and leans back a little. “Honestly, Tess? I’ve got a good feeling.”
“Nah.”
“Sam left the door open!” Castiel says defensively. He sighs. “I wanted to know that you were okay, Dean. You sounded… you sounded…” There are tears gathering in Castiel’s eyes, he wipes at them angrily.
“I didn’t know you… journaled.”
Castiel nods. “Yes, yes that does sound good.”
answer with your name, and ask how you can help me.”
Sam’s neighbors can hear.

“Anyway, so… yeah. The scars kinda freak people out. One girl thought I was a satanist.”
“You, uh… you okay with kissing?”
“Fine, Ms. Expert, what do I do now?”
“Not driving, taking the bus. My license expired, and the road is so… it’s real busy, you know? Not really ready for that even if I
There’s a lot of work to do in this place. Dust and dead bugs on every possible surface, old furniture that’s too rotted to salvage, broken glass, termite damage, old cigarette butts the Russian seemed to leave in every nook and cranny.
Still, there has to be something he can say to help.
Ready. Castiel is blown away by how
“Crowley’s a dick,” Dean says, “couldn’t you tell that when you were at his store?”
“So?”
Castiel refuses to start sobbing while his child is trying to open up about something.
“Well… I’ve already shared my story about my boyfriend screwing me out of a job. Oh, I’ve been stabbed.”
Castiel’s not home all that long before Claire comes home, flanked by two smiling teenagers. Incredible. Castiel watched Claire’s social connections wither and die between her depression and coming out as transgender, and here she is with two new friends after her very first day at a new school.
“Not a chance in fucking hell.”
“What

reach me until my castmates came to visit.”
“Ten minutes ago he texted me asking when I wanted to go out again.”
“Yes you do,” Castiel says, voice a little softer. “Better than me.”
Castiel’s eyes widen. He’s known people that were in the military, of course, but as far as he knows, none of them took a life. Dean has taken
There’s tragedy in this moment, that they could have had this in life and never did, but Dean’s at peace with it. Castiel will find him again in Heaven, and together they can figure out some afterlife groove.
“And they just kicked you off? Why aren’t you mad? If my boss fired me after eight years, I’d— actually bad example, I hate my job.”
“Hey… I uh… I was wondering something,” Castiel says, feeling young and small and embarrassed.
Impala67: so you wanna play minecraft or what
Dean can’t believe he’s putting his Sappy Optimist hat on right now, but here he is. “You know how much hope that package gave me on the i-island… how it gave me reason to believe I had a future… it kept me hanging on. I think… dude I think it’s pretty cool that we had that impact on each other before we even met.”
“It’s not that, it’s just… you called me ‘he’. Twice.”
“Headed home.”
“Forget something?” Castiel says by way of greeting.
“Reapers.”
“I know my couch is not the most comfortable, but surely it’s more comfortable than this,” Castiel says, voice bone-dry.
Castiel smiles. “Okay, Dr. Dean.”
Castiel stares at Dean, mystified. “I don’t have a cold, if that’s—”
Jimmy chuckles, frightened and relieved by the enormity of what’s to come. “I have no idea.”
the island, sleeping in the backyard, the way the smell of seafood makes him queasy and homesick at the same time.
Dinner is delicious, much better than both the fast food they were having on the road, and Castiel’s attempts at home cooking. The burgers are well seasoned and juicy, the fries are crisp and salty, and Sam brings them free root beer floats as a sort of welcome gift.
