I frown. “But Cas isn’t a Guardian angel.”
Cas considers it. “Did you find out anything?” he asks.
He pulls back a little to watch Cas’ face as he carefully manipulates the sound, twisting it lightly and moving it slowly in and out. Cas moans softly, straining against the cuffs as his eyes flutter closed. “Weird, but…good. Kind of…
“Depends,” Dean answers, fingertips brushing lightly over his hole. “How’s it feel down there?”
“He’s an angel,” Cas explains. “Dean agreed to help him.”
“Hmm?”
Don't hate me!
, the voice in my head answers. “It’s a little hard to see from this angle,” I say finally. Why don’t you come around to this side, so I can make sure it’s right.” Slowly, he grins, slipping off the bed and walking slowly over to the side I’m sitting on. He hesitates for a moment, watching me carefully, before shucking off his coat and sinking down to his knees at the side of the bed. “That’s much better,” I chuckle, running my hand lightly through his hair. I smooth out the leather between my fingers, carefully wrapping it around his neck, then pulling it one notch tighter. Cas makes a small sound. “Too tight?” I ask.
Dean was still much calmer than he had any right to be, especially when, inside the angel, there was a
Gabriel makes a face like he’s offended. “Oh, come on, is that any way to treat someone who’s trying to help?”
He nods. “I do. Thank you for being so patient. This is something I want to do, and I know it’s only for the party, not for forever, but…I think I just get stuck in my head sometimes.”
“Yeah, but...I mean, I think the cat’s kind of out of the bag for me, at least with Sam and Jack.”
“Oh, yeah, yes, of course,” Dean said quickly, relieved as he pulled the other man into his bedroom and closed the door. “I’m pretty sure I have some pajamas you can wear.”
Immediately after entering his apartment, the wave of guilt washes over Dean, and he sinks to the floor, rubbing at his temples in an effort to relieve the pressure building in his head. After a few minutes he manages to pick himself off the floor, walking back into the bedroom and frowning at the black box on the nightstand that contains Cas’ collar. His immediate instinct is to drive straight over to Cas’ apartment and give it to him, just to make sure he has it, but he swallows down the desire. Cas asked for space. That’s fair. He had to respect that. Instead, he runs the soft leather through his fingers, hoping that needing some space isn’t the beginning of the end. He falls asleep like that, clutching the collar to his chest, and when he wakes up it’s late. He forces himself to get up and eat something, even though he really has no desire to move. The knock at the door startles him, and he checks his watch, wondering who on earth would be visiting him this late and reining in the hope that it’s who he wants to see.
“Of course,” Dean answers, leaning in to kiss his forehead softly. “You don’t have to be nervous to ask me for what you want. As long as it’s safe for you, we’ll do our best to make it happen. Got it?”
he grinned, and Cas laughed.
I smile, kissing his forehead softly. “Well you don’t have to know. I’m right here. Just let me take care of you for a while.” He nods in agreement, pressing closer. Gradually, I increase the pressure of my fingers. It’s still exceedingly light, a very subtle difference that he would never have noticed were I touching him anywhere else. Still, his wings tense for a moment at the change before relaxing again, trusting. I watch them intently, surprised and pleased at how easily his soul bowed, how completely it trusts me. It took years to build up some semblance of trust with Dean himself, but it seems his soul is more than willing to take that chance, like it’s encouraging him. And if that is the case, it seems to be working, considering how relaxed Dean is. An idea occurs to me, and before I know it my free hand is resting at the back of his head, lightly coaxing it back. Of all the things Dean hates, letting people near his throat is one of the biggest. He tolerates it during sex, more out of duty than pleasure, but always flinches away from it outside of the bedroom. He thinks I don’t notice the tension in him when I try, but I’ve long been aware that it’s a trust issue, though he refuses to discuss it at all. Perhaps now, when he’s still so relaxed and pliant, would be the best time to help him let go of that. I expect some form of resistance, but surprisingly, Dean’s head falls back into my palm quite willingly. I slowly move it back until his chin tips up, exposing the tender skin of his throat. I plant a soft kiss there, hearing him gasp softly, but he doesn’t pull away as I expected. I do it again, grinning at the low purr that vibrates through his chest. It seems his soul’s trust is rubbing off on the rest of him, and he doesn’t even flinch as I repeat it a few more times. “I love you, Dean,” I whisper. “I would never hurt you.”
“Because…I just know you’d never do anything to put me in danger,” he answers after a minute. “Even if something sounds scary…I know the only way you’d do it to me is if you knew what you were doing. I trust you to make those decisions, so…I don’t have to worry about them anymore.”
It was Dean’s voice that stopped him. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Cas considered it for a long moment, frowning slightly as he concentrated on sorting out his newly-human sensations. “I think I’m just...tired, mostly,” he decided finally. “Sometimes it can take a while to adjust. But I’m okay, thank you.”
She nods, carding her fingers through the long blonde strands. “We are. I hope you’ll be sticking around to watch.”
He frowns at that. “I’m having a hard time thinking of anyone who deserves to relax more than you.”
Cas nods, relaxing. “Yeah, I think that would help. That’s all I can think of so far. Does that cover the basics?”
He glances up when we walk in, and Cas smiles, slipping an arm around my waist. Gabriel frowns at me for a moment. “Are you really serious about this?” he asks.
just feels twisted and bitter in his mouth, and the other options are too embarrassing still. The angel doesn’t mind.
I smile, smoothing out his messy hair. “Ol aziazor elasa,” I murmur, too spent for English.
Dean watched him curiously for a moment, debating whether or not he wanted to push his luck.
There’s a soft knock on the door, and when I open it Gabriel is standing there. “Hey...thought you might have some questions for me.”
I nod quickly. “Most definitely,” I answer. “You happen to be excellent at it.”
“I can hear your heartbeat,” I murmur. “I like it. It’s very…human.”
"What? I know how much you like taking pictures. You can do a lot more with this one than with your phone." It was true; since Cas discovered photography he's been slightly obsessed, and keeps running out of space on his phone. Sam thinks it's just a fascination with getting to freeze time, but I think it has a lot more to do with being able to hold onto those moments forever.
“Huh. So he’s stepped up his game. Maybe he got tired of working behind the scenes. Still no word on what he was experimenting for, huh?”
I chuckle. “You know I have to find out now, right? I’m a sucker for the big red button.” He groans again, but it cuts off in a sharp breath as I lightly run my hands over his shoulders again, watching as the enormous black wings unfurl over the edge of the couch. “Huh. So that’s what’ll happen if I keep doing it.”
“Alright,” Cas murmured, stroking his jaw lightly. “If you’re sure. Take your time, and stop if anything hurts.” Dean nodded, licking into Cas’ mouth lazily as he slowly sank further into the other man’s lap. They were both sweaty and panting by the time he bottomed out, the feeling familiar but also somehow new, now that it was something he’d actually wanted. Experimentally, Dean pulled himself up a few inches, then sank down again, moaning softly and hearing a groan echoed below him. When he looked, Cas’ face was contorted in a strange mix of determination and pleasure, his body strung so tight that Dean could feel Cas’ thighs trembling under him. Smirking, Dean leaned forward, mouthing along Cas’ jaw and throat. Cas mewled, his head tilting to give Dean better access even as his fingers dug into his thighs. “D-Dean,” he choked out, whimpering softly as Dean’s teeth nipped over his pulse. “It’s h-hard to concentrate...when you’re d-doing that...”
Dean nods, writing on a pad with the hand that’s not tracing over the bones of Cas’ ankle. “Okay. Then let’s figure out where the boundaries are. I need you to answer honestly based on your own feelings, not based on what you think I want, okay? We’ll talk about what you want first, and then we’ll see if there’s anything we need to discuss. Fair enough?”
“So? They could have used his,” I point out.
“I think it might be working,” I answer, kissing him lightly. “I’d like to try again tomorrow.”
I take a breath, leaning into him slightly. “Are you sure about that?”
Dean smiled, nodding. “Thank you.” He watched the door close behind them, then turned back to Cas. “Do you, uh...I can leave too, if you want; give you some space...”
“Pretty awesome, right? They have books about damn near everything here. Even stuff we’ve never heard of. It does help with research. So, what...what did you want to talk about?”
Dean smiles, nodding. “Okay. I’ll try, alright?” Cas considers this, then nods, snuggling closer, tracing light patterns along Dean’s side. After a minute his hand slips lower, and Dean gasps in surprise. “Cas…baby, what are you doing? You’re supposed to be taking it easy.”
*hides* I know, I know, cliffhanger! Part 2 is almost done I promise! In the meantime, please leave me a review if you like it (or if you hate me, but please don't hate me :P)
He sighs softly. “I…I’m not sure.”
Cas perked up a bit, nodding. “I suppose that would be a good idea. So you’ve decided to come with us?”
Karael’s expression hardens. “Touchy about your little winged lover, are we? You’re really in no position to be making threats, Dean. I have the power here, remember?” He pauses, looking deliberately at Cas. “Kill them both,” he orders. Suddenly, Cas switches from fear to anger, and the blade has only just pressed into my throat before it drops to the ground as every demon in sight goes up in flames instantly. Cas’ wings spread wide, and the humor slips away from Karael’s face. “Someone got an upgrade,” he murmurs.
I nod, relieved. “Okay. Can I help you with your research?”
Cas nodded slightly, sluggishly working through his racing thoughts. “So...what you’re saying is...this could kill me, now that I’m human.”
When Cas wakes up in the morning, it’s because of the strange noises coming from the bathroom. He gets up to investigate, finding Dean on his knees, retching into the toilet miserably. “Dean? What’s wrong?”
“Not unless they’re invited to by the person in control of the scene. That’s a very important rule here. You can look, but you don’t touch without permission. It’s how we keep everybody safe and within their limits. Some people liked to be watched, but being touched by strangers you don’t know or trust is very different. It depends on the people involved. If anyone unwelcome tries to interfere with a scene they’re immediately banned and kicked out.”
“Static could indicate a strong supernatural being. High level demon maybe. Anything else?”
Cas smiles softly, hugging him closer. “Okay then. I’ll be with you every step of the way.”
“Hmm?” Dean replies, starting to kiss and bite at his neck.
“I love you too,” I murmur, lightly combing my fingers through his disheveled hair. “So, so much. My angel.”
“Well, I guess we’ll start from the beginning,” Dean says, sitting with Cas’ feet in his lap. “You can change your mind about any of this at any time, but we need to have a starting point. And remember, this is only for this one event. Everything else stays the same. So, do you want to have other people involved, or just have them watch?”
“Hate what?” Cas asked, puzzled.
Cas laughed, grinning to himself as he went to start the shower.
Cas smiles, kissing his cheek. “I don’t mind. What are you thinking about?”
“I don’t know what to think,” I murmur. “It’s not like I can find out anyway.”
“I’m fine, Cas,” he says quickly, not meeting my gaze.
Cas smiles, nodding and getting dressed. He takes my hand, kissing me softly before zapping us back to the bunker. The main room is empty when we return, but there are muffled voices coming from the library. I frown at Cas, slowly walking toward the sound.
“Okay. That’s because you’re afraid. Does anything else hurt? Does anything feel the same as it did?”
But Sam shakes his head slowly. “No, I remember this. You used to sneak out and come home with bruises and tell me not to tell dad. What was all that about?”
I ignore his last comment, nodding and tightening my hold around his waist. “Okay. Thanks.” Cas grabs my wrist, tugging until I follow him back into our room. He’s quiet, and I frown at the tension in his shoulders. “Cas? What’s wrong?”
Cas pauses for a minute. “Do you trust me?” he asks. I nod slowly. “Okay. Then let me show you.”
Dean is tense while he considers this, his breathing tight and frightened. On one hand, there’s the voice.
I consider it for a minute before nodding. “Why is that so important to you?”
Cas turns towards the kitchen, and Gabriel gasps sharply. “What the hell is that?!”
Slowly, I look up at him, smiling slightly. “You really do help, you know? I’ve never even considered thinking about myself like this before you…”
Dean jumped a little, looking back at him, then shrugged. “I hate this,” he said eventually.
Love,
I pull him onto the couch beside me, picking up one of the books on the table. “Thank God. Hey, how’d you know about all the stuff on the list?”
The change in Dean is almost immediate. The second his father starts to descend the stairs his easy posture slips away, replaced with the stiff stance of a soldier, and I can almost see all the progress he’s made coming undone. What’s scarier, though, is the complete lack of projection through the bond. After getting used to the constant presence, feeling it shut down is alarming. It’s harder than I imagine to resist reaching out for him, but I know it would only make things worse. Still, I can’t help but shift a little closer.
Later, my mind is blessedly quiet as I rest against Cas’ chest, still trembling in his protective hold. “Better?” he murmurs against the top of my head.
“Please what?” I ask innocently, laughing at his frustrated growl. “Oh, I understand now. You want me to touch you.”
Cas nods, carefully setting the collar down before climbing into bed and pressing up against Dean’s chest. “I’m really glad you’re here,” he whispers, sighing softly.
Sam chuckles, squeezing them both a little tighter. “You’ll just have to fill me in on what I missed.” He bites his lip, glancing at Cas. “Any idea who brought me back?”
Cas shrugs. “They weren’t always black,” he explains. “They got that way when I pulled Dean from hell.”
“You ready baby?” he manages a nod, and Dean grins. “Okay, here’s the last one. Deep breath. Cum for me, baby boy…”
Cas nods. “For some parts of it, yes. I know you don’t like it. But you wouldn’t talk to me, and I was concerned.”
Cas smiled softly, pressing a kiss to the back of his hand. “I’m so excited. I missed it so much.”
I frown. "I don't know, I just knew. Something felt wrong. It felt like he was scared."
The girl nodded, glancing around the small crowd and smiling as her eyes landed on Kaia. “Yeah, I know what you mean...just don’t chicken out, okay? I promise it’s worth it. And you have to text me and let me know how it goes.”
“’Mkay,” he murmurs, too tired to keep asking questions. Instead he presses his cheek against the cool leather, letting his eyes close. “You can handle me…”
“Yes you do. What does it feel like?” I prod, repeating it again, watching his wings quiver.
Cas absorbed this for a moment, then looked at him curiously. “Who said I don’t?”
He pulls off of me with a loud pop. “I want to try something,” he says evenly, as if he’s talking about the weather. “You know I wouldn’t hurt you, right?”
Gabriel laughs. “No, you don’t. Kind of a shame, too, you’d make a hot pirate.” Sam grins at him. “Really though, all your parts are there. You have some broken bones, and you hit your head pretty hard, so we’ll have to check that out. But it could have been a lot worse.”
“There’s just…so much that could go wrong, you know? What if he just…doesn’t wake up? Or what if he does, and he doesn’t remember who I am? Or what if he remembers, but he can’t talk ever again?”
She laughs. “I can imagine.”
“You’re probably right,” he agrees. “You sure you’ll be alright watching the two of them on your own?”
…good…” he groans, clenching around the intrusion as it rubs over the sensitive spot. He pants and moans louder, hips rocking in pursuit of sensation. “Dean, I…
Dean chuckles nervously. “What, are you a shrink?”
I shrug a little. “I don’t know really. I just…really wanted to touch them. And when you said that they haven’t been touched in…probably centuries, I just…I had to. You seemed to enjoy it.”
The first thing I'm aware of is a muffled yell, followed by hands on my shoulders. I try to open my eyes, to move anything at all, but my muscles seem locked in their tense, trembling state, and I can't control them. There's a voice, and then a third hand is on me, pressed lightly against my forehead.
“Nothing,” he replies tensely. “Is that all?”
Cas smiles. “Yes, I suppose you two have a lot to talk about. Come on, Dean, let’s give them some privacy.” He takes my hand again, leading me downstairs to his newly-renovated room. “I thought maybe you’d like to explore it a little more,” he explains.
With Sam out on a run and Cas holed up in the library, I take some time to clean things up and give Baby a tune-up before I get bored. I go to the library, finding Cas curled up in a chair. He doesn’t seem to notice me, so I sneak up behind him, wrapping my arms around his shoulders. He glances up, almost admonishing, and I laugh. “Why so serious, baby?” I chuckle, kissing the back of his neck softly. “It’s not my fault you’re looking like a sexy librarian.” His eyes flutter closed as I continue kissing along his shoulder.
“Cas, are you trying to tell me that touching an angel’s wings could, potentially, be a sexual act?” He doesn’t answer right away, which is how I know I’m right. This information interests me more than it probably should. Cas’ stay at the bunker forced me to really consider my own feelings, and as much as I hate all that girly stuff that Sam is always trying to get me to talk about, it did help. It took a long time, but I’ve finally accepted my feelings for him. I’d also decided not to tell him. Cas has issues with even simple emotions, so putting all of that on him wouldn’t be fair, especially considering he’s never shown any interest in anything like that. So I decided to just be happy with the friendship and trust that he’s willing to offer. But now, the fact that he’s telling me all this makes me think he might be trying to say something else.
“It’s the only way you know how to be absolved,” he finishes quietly.
Dean nods. “How long did you see your doctor? Do you still see her?”
Dean’s expression softened with something like fondness. “I’m pretty sure the expression you’re looking for is that I was being a dick. And you’re right. I was. But this is what I’m trying to tell you, Cas, I...all that stuff I said, the things I was feeling...I may have said that it was about you, but...I meant it about myself.”
“D-Dean…?” he stutters.
Dean rubbed a hand over his face, briefly considering the chances he might be hallucinating. Alright, so not all of his thoughts about the angel had been...
A quiet gasp escapes him at that, and he shakes his head slightly. “I...I said that?” he whispers, rubbing at his forehead. “I don’t...I don’t remember that...I don’t remember any of that. I know I was hard on you, and...I know I hit you a few times, but...that’s impossible. I wouldn’t say those things...”
“Speaking of experience…how do you know all of this stuff?” Cas asks curiously. “I mean, I get that you’ve been doing this for a while, but every time you pull out something I have no idea about, and you’re just so good at it, whatever it is.”
“I think the spell scared them,” he answers. He starts a gentle bouncing motion, trying to stop it.
“I was just calling to see how your night was,” he says innocently. “Anything…interesting happen?”
When he wakes up a few hours later, he instinctively shakes out his feathers. “Cas?” he murmurs sleepily. He realizes mid-stretch that he has wings and glances back at them. “Guess that wasn’t a dream then.”
Cas is
. Just yours, Cas. Always yours.”
“It worked,” Jack says, sounding upsettingly relieved.
one? “—in the same room as my
Dean would never tell Sammy, or Cas, or anyone. But he missed being a demon. He missed being able to do the right thing—and the wrong thing, too—without that little voice yelling at him. The voice that told him
Dean sighed, bit the inside of his cheek, and sighed again. He could’ve just said it and run, but
“I’ll bet,” Dean said absently, watching Cas stare at his own photo.
Somewhere nearby, he’s dimly aware that Sam is hurrying Jack back to the car. Chuck is laughing. Chuck is gone. Sam is coming back.
“Dean, stop,” Cas said, but his tight fists and his white lips were saying
“You let Jack become God?” The same anger Dean's been keeping a tight rein on seeps out of Cas' tone, the same way the Empty goo is seeping out of his shiny black shoes. “Do you know how irresponsible that is? He’s only three years old, Dean. He still needs guidance, and love, and…”
Dean flicked his tongue across Cas’ rim as fast as he could, going faster and faster as he gloried in the whimpers escaping his man’s mouth. When he actually slipped the tip of his tongue
“Yes, Michael. We will take care of it.” With a quick nod to his sire, he turned to his mate and took his hand.
“Don’t ask stupid questions, Dean. Of course, I know that. I'm just...I don’t want to disappoint you, or freeze up because of what happened before.” Dean reached up to rescue the poor bottom lip that Cas was attempting to cannibalize by pulling it out of his teeth with his thumb.
There’s a little spark in his eyes, and he nods once. “Oh. I see. Then I rescind my earlier protests. Though, I wonder if we could modify the plan a bit.” I raise an eyebrow at him, and he grins. “I believe a bath would be more helpful in warming me up.” I chuckle, starting the water and stripping off my boxers, thankful that I didn’t put more clothes on before answering the door. Cas kicks off his shoes and socks, shucking off his own wet underwear, which stick to him in protest. I climb into the tub, reaching for his hand and pulling him in after me, pulling him closer until I’m sitting with him in my lap. I lightly run my fingers through his hair when his head falls back onto my shoulder, and he makes that soft purring sound. “You were right, Dean,” he whispers. “This is much warmer.”
I chuckle, thinking back to our recent experiments. “Only with you.”
I chuckle, nodding and walking closer. “So I take it you and Gabriel...?”
“Cas, this is Andrea, Benny’s wife,” Dean explains.
“Then…what is it? I know you don’t like feelings, so I tried not to do anything wrong…”
There’s a shuffle on the other side of the door, and a disheveled-looking Sam opens it. “Dean? What the hell, man? It’s like four in the morning.”
He scoops me up, and the next thing I know we’re both in the bathtub. He smiles when I look up at him again. “…Hi,” I whisper.
Cas makes a thoughtful sound, his fingers tangling in the hair at the back of my head and tugging lightly. For some reason, it soothes some of the ache that’s taken up residence in my chest. “And these are the first things you think about when you look at yourself?” I nod slowly. “Well, we’re going to have to change that, aren’t we?”
“I am,” I answer. “Thanks. Now, go pack up. We’ve got work to do.”
Cas gave him a watery smile, emotion welling up in his voice. “I want to get drunk with you and do karaoke. I want...I want to feel. I thought it was intense as an angel, but it’s so much
“Nothing,” Cas answered quickly, shaking his head. “Sam tells me it’s your birthday tomorrow.”
“Hey Dean?” he asks. “Why didn’t you keep going?”
Cas smiled shyly, biting his lip. “I’m not sure if that’s what you’d call it. I know you’ve always been uncomfortable with the concept. I just...I know that this is where I’m supposed to be. And I want you to know it too. I want this to be a reminder of my promise, that I’ll be by your side, every day, for as many days as we have left. But I know you’ve always said marriage isn’t for you, so we don’t have to-”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Dean,” he chuckles. “You didn’t get sick on purpose. I would never be mad at you for that. Besides, I think we’d both enjoy it more if you’re not wanting to vomit the whole time. Don’t worry about it, okay? We’ll have plenty of time for that when you’re feeling better.”
More exploration of Dean's issues in the bedroom toward the end of this chapter! I debated whether or not to include these scenes, but in the end I decided that it would be something that Dean would feel very strongly about reclaiming, and it just didn't feel genuine to not explore those things with a fade to black, or to just not talk about them. So they'll be included occasionally, and I'll post in a note at the top of a chapter if there is a bedroom scene, that way if anyone prefers to avoid them they'll be aware. Anyway, off to the chapter!
I swallow nervously, nodding. “I…yes, I think so. If you don’t mind.”
“Agreed. I didn’t want to push for any more details, but I figure if he’s in your files, then he’s most likely a part of this whole kidnapping theory we have. But if he didn’t go missing around the spike, it has to be something else.”
“So a few weeks ago when you were all happy about someone you’re seeing, it was…him?” Dean demands.
He turns, surprised. “Oh. Hello Dean.”
Dean smiles again, kissing him softly. “Good. Go wait for me in the living room.” Cas nods, settling down next to the couch to wait. He smiles when he sees the bowl of fruit already on the table, sitting next to the box that holds his collar. After a minute Dean joins him, running a hand through his hair lightly, and Cas grins when he spots the single fork in his hand. It’s become something of a routine for them, especially because it allows Cas to relax into his own space, and because Dean likes watching it happen. They stay quiet for a while, both of them relaxing into the intimacy of it. When they’re finished, Dean taps his shoulder lightly to get his attention and motions him up. He pulls Cas back by the hips until he’s settled in Dean’s lap, leaning back against his chest, his knees spread around the outside of Dean’s. He chuckles softly as he recalls the first time he did this, the day he walked in to find Dean in his apartment. “What’s so funny?” Dean asks softly.
TheSongSmith
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. “And you picked it up...why?”
Gabe bites his lip, playing with the hem of his shirt nervously. "Sammy...you...Make me different. And I-I like the person I am with you...I never thought that I'd want this, and I'm sure Cas would say he never thought this day would come, but I...seeing you in the hospital like that; not knowing if I'd ever get to see you smile again...I realized that I never, ever want to be without you, not for a single minute..."
He hesitates for a minute before taking a breath. “I guess I just have to come right out and ask it. Dean, are you...gay?”
I feel myself flush a little, nodding. “I think I’m starting to, Sir.”
I sigh, pressing closer. "I called you 'Daddy'," I mumble into his neck.
It was so easy, the answer, like Cas thought nothing of it. And as much as Dean thought he was crazy at the time, the more he considered it, the more he realized it really was that easy. Because the truth was, Dean trusted him too. He’d been more vulnerable with Cas than he’d ever been in his entire life. He’d laid himself bare; his ugly past, the jumbled nightmares in his head, every irrational fear and doubt and weakness in him. And Cas had accepted it all, without judgement. He’d healed Dean, protected him; held his hand through all the horrors and helped him build a life. He’d made him feel safe, and loved, and worthy for the first time in his memory. And now he was here, about to do something that should be terrifying...but he wasn’t scared. Because even if it went as horribly as it could possibly go, he knew Cas would still be right there to help him through it.
He shakes his head, shifting closer and wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders. “Of course. Take all the time you need.”
“If that’s what you want, I’m happy to support you,” I murmur, kissing his cheek. “If that’s the plan, then we need to decide what you’re going to share with him. I’d understand if you’d rather not let him know about our relationship. We can keep things discreet if that would make things easier.”
“I know,” he murmured, stroking Dean’s hair lightly with his free hand. “I just like taking my time with you. You’re so beautiful.”
Cas looked like he might have fallen straight off the bed if Dean hadn’t still been holding onto him. “That’s...something you want?” he asked softly.
“It’s pretty terrifying,” he admits. “But...it kind of feels good too. Like...I don’t have to be afraid of losing everything. Because I know that you, and Sam, and Gabe...you guys all care about me, not just...what I can do. And even if I mess up a hundred times, you’re still gonna be here.”
notice? Because they didn’t, and I’m not fucking stupid, Cas, okay?!” His teeth clench, and hot tears of frustration form in his eyes. “I did everything anyone ever asked of me. I followed orders, I didn’t complain, I didn’t tell anyone how I felt. And you know what he always said to me? ‘Take care of your brother, Dean. You have to protect him. He’s too innocent to know about these things. We can’t let him know what we know, it’s not right to scare him….’” He pauses to take a breath, his voice breaking. “‘Sammy is so
“Of course.” He sighs, pressing soft kisses to Cas’ chest. “We should get you cleaned up before you get sticky. And you’re probably starving.”
Dean stared, then pulled his fist back, seething.
Jack, Dean reminded himself—would have sat much closer.
“You good?”
The customer, a panicked teenage girl, sobbed. “But my mom will be home by then!”
“No,” Dean said. “No. I’m glad—I’m glad that you’re here. You know, alive.”
,” Dean hisses, clutching Sam tighter. “Do what you
Jack looked at Dean, who nodded in reassurance. Sam held out the fourth plate (filled with rather cold bacon and eggs) and leaned against the counter so he looked shorter. Jack took the plate from Sam and, to Dean’s astonishment, sat right next to Cas.
A single unmarked stone signified Cas’s resting place.
Dean rolled over. “Sam, let me go in first,” he said. “Just in case.”
His head is so very silent, and so very peaceful. The Bunker is warm and yellow-lit, and nothing is white, and nothing is beige—not even Cas’s coat, which he had turned black with a wave of his hand.
“You were only there for like, two minutes,” Sam said.
“Can I change the wrap?” the doctor asks, patient and kind and too perfect, like a robot.
“What Dean means to say,” Sam said uncomfortably, “is that you can come back to the Bunker with us, get some rest, and we can figure it out from there. Or if you want, we can let you go here and—and you can do what you want.”
In the backseat, Sam awkwardly watched the road go by. Dean saw him look between them every so often, as if he knew something had happened but didn’t want to ask. Eventually, Sam deserved explanations; he had been so patient with Jack and with Dean and now Cas. Dean tried to imagine telling him that he and Cas—well, they—sort of—he didn’t even know where to begin. He knew what Bobby would have told him, though: “Boy, sort through your own damn feelings before trying to figure out others’!”
“What?”
Also damn, I didn’t mean for this to hit so close to home. To myself, that is. Jack has some problems with his newfound freedom in the new world and the kindness of this version of his three dads. was not expecting to project this much onto these characters but o course a did. Haha!
Dean cracked an eye. Sam stood in the doorway awkwardly, holding Dean’s jacket and the car keys.
“Holy—”
“I think this is something I need to do alone,” he told Jack, doing his best to ignore the heartbroken expression on the kid’s face. “Besides, Sam’s right; you seriously need a nap.”
Jack’s lips curved into the faintest smile. “Star Wars,” he said. “We had that.”
The doctor helped Dean to a chair in the hallway. Once she’d stopped bandying about, Dean thought, she wasn’t so bad.
“No,” says Sam.
The three of them clambered out of the Impala and headed up an expansive marble staircase, to the front door of the museum where a tall hippie-looking guy was taking entry fees.
“He always wants to talk,” Dean said. “But never about what actually matters.” In a daring moment of despair, Dean rested his forehead on Cas’s shoulder. “And I don’t know what to say to him, anyway. ‘Sorry the new version of Jack is afraid of you? Sorry the other version of you was clearly a huge douche and Jack will never get over it?’”
“Shut
Jack’s attention snapped away from Sam. “Yes?”
Cas shot upright. “What?”
“Hey, hey, hey!” Dean grabbed Sam’s shoulder. “It’s not him, alright? It’s not him.” He kept his eyes on the road, feeling Sam exhale under his palm. “It’s a damn case, we don’t know
Dean wrinkled his nose. “You what?”
“Know how to handle it?” Dean guessed. He could relate. When Dean had first come back from Purgatory, the normal, everyday routines seemed so terribly mundane and yet overwhelming. He had reverted to functioning on autopilot, except that his autopilot had changed in Purgatory to become constantly moving, constantly on fighting edge. The slow hop from motel to motel had been both relief and torture. Dean could only imagine what Jack had gone through. The sudden shift from one world to another was probably one of the most terrible things to happen to the kid.
In the doorway, Jack stood with rings of orange flickering, as if he and Cas were having a standoff. He was fully dressed, complete with the brown patterned jacket that the sheriff had given the original Jack. Dean thought about that Jack, and how clueless he had been at first—how he’d copied Dean’s every move in a crash course of being human. Then the orange and blue lights died out. The new Jack reached towards his own throat as if remembering the feeling of Cas’s grace from last night.
Back into their world, with another Jack.
Lucifer stands behind Cas, a red-hot fire poker in hand. Sam’s stomach drops beneath him so fast he gets dizzy.
Dean shifted so that Jack was leaning against his shoulder. “Say, uh, what’s up with you and Sam?” At the question, he could feel the kid tense up.
“Good morning,” Jack said. He sat at the kitchen table, a blank sheet of paper and pencil in hand.
So Dean slips out the door and closes it quietly, then slams every other open door he sees on the way to the kitchen. He pounds on the closed ones with his elbow, his fist, his foot. From somewhere in the vicinity of the dungeons, he can hear Miracle barking his head off.
you back.”
“You remember when we used to stay in motel rooms all the time?” He continues, lazily sitting up and stripping off his jacket. “Those were the days. Don’t get me wrong, the bunker’s nice and all, but there’s just something about a motel. Lived in ‘em since I was a kid. Lots of history in these rooms, Cas. So many people in and out. Lots of babies made in this bed, I bet.”
It was one thing to hurt Sammy. Sam could handle anything Dean threw at him, whether it was a hammer or some sharp words. Sammy had grown up with Dad.
“Get the hell away from me!” Dean gives as good as he gets, landing punch after kick, but the thing just keeps shoving him backwards until his knees hit the edge of the bed. He goes down, and the thing goes down on top of him. Dean braces for impact.
“Oh,” Dean says helplessly. “
“Sword fight?” Cas asked, tipping his head even further and narrowing his eyes. And he
“So that’s the part you’re arguing with,” Dean said, tipping his head to the side just like Cas always did and letting his eyes flash black. “Not the part about your desperate romantic love.”
wanted to see you.”
“Dean. I love
“Cas—” Dean’s voice broke,
“Really?” Cas asks, warm breath going straight into Dean’s ear and making him shiver like he’s just walked into a cold spot. “I assumed that after…what I said…you would be reluctant to see me again.”
But why should he?
But Dean doesn’t care.
Dean carefully sets the dish down on the drying rack and hangs the towel on a peg.
“Damnit, Cas. You’re an angel. You’re
“Wish you were here,” he says. Then laughs, because he sounds like a friggin’ postcard.
“Ever tell you how I got my edge in the bedroom? It was a motel in Missoula. The guy in the bedroom next to me…man, I owe him so much, Cas. So much. We stayed there a month, and those walls were thin like paper. I mean, I could’ve caved one of ‘em in just by leaning on it. And that guy, he’d just say what was going on the whole time. I mean, it was like he was narrating his own life.
Oh, God.
me. Bed, desk, whatever. Lube’s in the top drawer with the handcuffs. Spare gun’s in there, too, and I keep it unloaded if you wanna get really freaky.”
And there he is.
“You fell from heaven when you fell for me. How intensely poetic.” Cas was looking down, but not at the ground. He was looking at…“You’re looking at my lips right now,” he continued, slowly licking his lips and leaving them glistening with saliva. “Do you want to know what it’s like to kiss me, Cas? Or are you thinking about these lips somewhere further south? I’d be good, you know. I have a lot of practice.”
please, Cas. Oh, god, baby. Right there. Right there. I—I love you I—
“Cas.” Dean put on his most commanding tone of voice, and Cas stopped just before the edge of the demon trap. Good. Dean had saved his most devastating blow for last. “I loved you too.”
“You were about to go off on your own forever, and now you’re worried about us dying?”
“And you won’t leave?” Dean can see the wheels turning in Sam’s gigantic brain, trying to predict whether Jack will listen to them or whether Sam will have to figure out some kind of God-summoning spell every time he wants Jack to come by for a beer.
“I shall have to thank him. And Jack?”
Thank you so much for reading! I think that Jack deserved so much more from Dean, namely an apology, and now (non-canonically but whatever) he has it. So, yay! Also, a big thanks again to my beta reader, who is amazingly supportive and a wonderful friend. Can you believe that sharing your Ao3 with people you actually know can have benefits/not ruin your life?
“Dean,” Cas said, and Dean hoped that Cas would never stop saying his name. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my time in heaven, it’s that happiness doesn’t come from remembering the past. But it also doesn’t come from imagining the future. Happiness isn’t in the having. It’s in just being. It's in just saying it.”
He was kissing his best friend, kissing a
He’ll pretend that it’s enough.
“Wish you’d left your trench coat. Used to carry it around in the trunk, back when you went all God on our asses and then up and turned faith-healer-slash-husband. Whenever Sammy and I got separate rooms, I’d sneak it out of the trunk and use it as a pillow. It smelled like you, man. Like…gun smoke and pine needles and light.”
There was a moment of silence. Dean sat back down on his bed and reached under the pillow. The knife bit into his thumb. Well, there went Dean’s last hope of this all being a dream.
. As we are both aware, this body is not my true form and angels have no gender. It is obvious that you are attracted to Jimmy Novak. I apologize for the fact that he is no longer here. Now will you please allow me to leave?”
They have time.
“And Chuck brought my dad—I mean, Lucifer—back from the Empty, right? To fight with Michael?”
Besides, why stop himself from being happy now just because it might mean he was sad later? Couldn’t he just be happy for one goddamn moment?
So, Cas seems to have forgotten the entire goddamn reason he let the Empty take him in the first place, which is also the reason that he and Dean can never be together, which means...
I cannot tell you how much I've appreciated every single comment on this work. I've been incredibly busy/stressed recently (i'm about to go on a cross-country RV trip...ugh) but I will reply to all of your comments soon. And if you feel moved to comment, please do! They are pretty much all that's getting me through the packing.
. I bet it was the high of pulling one over on me that sealed your deal. I hope you’re goddamn happy about it now, Cas, I really do. It’s the only thing that’s gonna get you through forever in the Empty.”
“Screw you, Cas. You don’t know dick about this,” Dean snapped, standing up from his bed and dusting his hands on his pants even thought they were perfectly clean. Cas looked a bit taken aback, and Dean realized that maybe he’d gotten too angry too fast. He’d had the Mark for so long, and then he’d been a demon. Dean wasn’t sure if he knew what appropriate anger was anymore. “I didn’t cut you out because I didn’t want to see you. I ripped up that picture because I
And then Jack is there to do all the crying and welcome home-ing and I love you-ing. Everything Dean can never say.
“It’s…”
“I was imagining that
For the first time since Mom had died, he’d been completely selfish. And it had felt
“I have come to believe that those are epithets usually accorded to platonic friends. If I remember correctly, you have often called Sam by both.”
“All that…what?”
They’ve saved the world.
“You remembered,” Cas said, voice completely neutral, face blank. “That was several years ago. I’d assumed you would have forgotten.”
“Lisa wasn’t real.”
Before, it had always been that Cas didn’t like him like that. But now that was out the window. He could argue that Sam wouldn’t like it, but that would be a lie. He could say that he wasn’t in a good place, but really, when had he ever been? He could say that he was straight, he was dangerous, he was damaged goods. He could even spin the table and say that he was in love with someone else (Benny? Crowley? That stripper from the bar?), and this whole thing had just been a big joke.
But this wasn’t a case, this was Dean’s life. In love with an Angel of the Lord who used to love him too. Who might still love him, if he hadn’t fucked everything up. He hadn’t only only missed his chance with Cas, he’d salted and burned his chance and then put it through a meat grinder.
Not about the gross black gunk, not about the ratty overcoat, not about the messy hair.
, man, flat out screaming. So I sat up right next to the wall and listened, and with all that narration I knew what he was doing every time. Just wish he’d screwed a few guys too, y’know?”
,” Dean growled. He grabbed Cas by his stupid tan jacket—the one he’d fished out of rivers and cried over whenever Cas died—and hauled him across those final few inches. Cas didn’t resist. He’d always done whatever Dean wanted, except go away.
“Dean, you are a good person. You deserve to have good things.” Cas was standing now. Dean’s next pass would take him less than six inches away from him.
“Cas…man, I can’t do this. I can’t do this without you. I can’t.
Maybe somewhere, in one of those alternate universes that Chuck destroyed, there was one where the only thing that Cas wanted—the only thing that Dean wanted—wasn’t something they could never have.
They’ve saved the world. His son is the new God. He and Sammy have somehow both survived, and although that’s all he’s wanted, Dean hadn’t really thought it was possible. And his best friend had died after telling Dean that he loved him, and that had been so much worse than the end of the world, but now he’s back with those blue eyes and those lips that Dean can’t stop staring at.
“I assumed that you would not willingly part with this information,” Cas said, finally turning his head to face Dean. His head was tipped quizzically to the side, eyebrows knotted and lips ever so slightly pursed. Dean tried to swallow, but his throat was far too dry. “Was this assumption incorrect?”
It’s only been two weeks and I just…I can’t. I can’t even breathe.”
Dean was in his bedroom, standing on top of a crumpled up porno magazine and bleeding just a bit from the cut on his thumb. His neck was at an awkward angle, and his eyes burned from all that crying. He was holding onto an Angel of the Lord, someone who had been around longer than he could comprehend and whose true form he would never see. But whose lips were so goddamn soft, all that crap didn’t seem to matter.
“No, I don’t.” Dean really hadn’t been sure if he did or not, but now he knows. This kid is
“Dean,” Cas said, swiping a tear off Dean’s cheek with his thumb. Dean didn’t even bother to hide his full body shiver. “What’s the matter?”
“What the hell, man?” He asks, when Cas pulls away too soon.
“Dean,” Cas said, catching his shoulder as he passed. “Please, don’t talk about yourself like that. You are the most wonderful man in the world.”
“Don’t see why not.” Dean finishes swiping goo off Cas’ shoulder and pulls him back into another hug. “I missed you.”
“That all you have to say?”
be playing with Dean, because who doesn’t know what that gesture means?
When Dean was a demon, this reaction would have made him absolutely elated. Now, just like Cas and Lisa, it was the opposite.
“Why do we have that so-called ‘profound connection’?” Dean asked, sketching finger quotes. They were rather ineffective, because his arms were tied down. But hey, it was the thought that counted. “Is it because you’re the one who pulled me out of Hell? It must have been exhausting, going to all that effort to keep me from being a demon. Remind me, Cas, how did that work out?”
“Dean, I have never failed to hear your prayers before. Why would you imagine I would start now?”
“He was weird, man,” he continues after a moment. “But damn, it worked. Those girls were
Finally.
The ringing brings Dean out of a dead sleep, loud and insistent and like the worst case of tinnitus he’s ever had.
“Hello, Dean.”
Fun facts time!
5. I have enjoyed every single one of your comments, and I absolutely promise that I'll respond to all of them when I have the energy!! It's been a crazy couple of weeks but I can't believe the response for this story. Thank you all so much for reading, and please, if you'd like to comment know that it will make my week.
“Sam and Jack are down the hall,” he tells Cas as he lays down on one of the beds and lets the magic fingers do their work. Sam explained how the electricity’s still on, but Dean couldn’t have been paying less attention. “Just you and me.”
“What?” Cas asked in a broken whisper, not turning around. The angel blade in his hand clattered to the floor.
“I do not know,” Cas said, looking like he’d just been given a calculus problem to solve (well, he was an angel. Maybe they just automatically knew how to do calculus).
“Could’ve at least left us a body to burn. Fucking selfish.”
“You could simply have asked me to pose for another picture. I do not believe that you are telling me the whole truth, Dean.”
“That’s the worst part, isn’t it?” Dean continued in a whisper. “If only you’d said something. If only I’d said something. Everything could have been different, we could have been together for years. Maybe I wouldn’t have become a demon at all. But we’ll never know, will we, Castiel?”
“Damn it, Cas.
But, like many other things (Sam putting a hand on Jack’s arm to keep him back, the cars honking at the newly erected blockade, all the people they’d brought back from the grave standing around), it doesn’t matter right now.
“But..”
“Oh my god,” Sam breathes, either not realizing the irony of his word choice or not caring.
The darkness doesn’t respond.
“Cas, I — forget it.”
Anyway, Dean had his own angel sword now. And even though he wasn’t a demon anymore, he could still rough up an angel pretty good.
after Dean had come back from purgatory. Dean had never really bought into it, especially because Sam was definitely hiding something that entire time, but now he’s kind of grateful that he’d listened to just a bit.
Either explanation was pretty friggin’ weird. Cas was usually
“Hello, Dean.”
“You can’t just leave, kid. You can’t.”
Dean let the question dangle in the air for a moment. He wasn’t hoping for a response, more for a bit of time to answer it himself.
part of him. And what Dean had said to Cas…that couldn’t be undone.
“Yeah, Cas, I loved you too. Why do you think I stopped sleeping around when you came on the scene? Why do think I kept letting you come back, and back, and back? I used to hug a pillow at night and pretend it was you. Benny let me call him your name when we were in the sack. All those busty asian beauties in my room? Haven’t touched them in years. They’re just to keep up appearances. My real stuff is that one picture I have of you. And yeah, I used to obsess over what it would be like to kiss you, too. I bet you’re a biter. Would you mark me up real good, Cas?”
Luckily, the kitchen came equipped with a meat tenderizer, and he bought a whole load of rib-eyes just for the occasion. It’s not quite the same as killing something with a hammer, but it’ll have to work.
“Well, yeah,” Dean says, dusting down Cas’ coat just for something to do. That Empty goo really does stain. “Have you seen yourself, man? What a catch. Besides, we’ve spent so much time around each other, it’d be weirder if we didn’t start catching feelings. It’s like Stockholm syndrome. But now we can both help each other get over it, y’know? Get back to being best friends.”
“I am fact-checking your statement. Is that not what you do, when you’ve received potentially important information?”
“When I was with Lisa, I was in this little make-believe bubble. It was like a djinn, you know? Lisa took away the monsters and the angels and everything. I was just a normal person with an awesome car.”
“I see,” Cas finally said, standing up. “I have the information I came for. Thank you for your time, Dean.”
There’s a popping sound like about twenty pounds of popcorn going off at once, and Dean’s going to kill that kid. He swings his legs out of bed and stomps over to the door, but just before he grabs the handle the door lifts itself off its hinges and hurls itself across the room.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, not looking up from whatever he was holding in his hands. That gravelly voice of his seemed to reverberate inside Dean, making goosebumps pop up on his skin like he’d just stepped into a cold patch. For the first few weeks after Cas had started hanging around, he’d used up the battery on five EMF meters trying to find the ghosts following him.
“Watching a porno with the world’s hottest dude—” Was he under a truth spell?
“How’d you do it?” Dean asks, eyes so unfocused that every shadow on his ceiling could be an Angel. “You never slept. You just stood there like a…a…a gargoyle or something. Just staring, staring all the time. With those eyes, Cas, those
family. And family is better together.”
“Sam and Eileen are doing good. Which is good, right? It’s good. But I can’t understand half the conversations happening in my own home and they’re always kissing and I can’t
And not when he cared more about the feeling of Cas’ chest under his hands than the feeling of overpowering an angel.
, well, Dean was planning on
“I’m all open for you, Cas. Come on. Break down the damn door.”
“Should’a seen that hunt, man. Killed so many sons of bitches. Almost got a nail to the back, but hey. All in a day’s work, right?”
“I thought you considered me part of your group,” Cas continued, voice and hands both trembling. Dean though he saw a tear in the corner of Cas’ eye, but that couldn’t be right. Angels don’t cry about messed up old photos. “Part of your family. But you have cut me out of a group picture. I can only come to the conclusion that you did not, in fact, wish me to be included.”
Dean guns the Impala, Zeppelin blasting over the speakers and Jack sitting in the passenger seat. The windows are down and the road is smooth.
be fine. And I’m the only one you’re really worried about, right, Cas?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cassie, Lisa, that one girl in Port Authority—never did get her name, but she was a hell of a lay. Even Benny, and that went on for quite a while. You know me, a monster’s a monster. But when you’re under the sheets…oh man. Totally worth it.”
He turns back to the bed, hoping it’s something he can just kill with a gun and go back to sleep. As he takes a step, the bulb in his lamp explodes.
nervous anymore. “Why have you removed me from a group picture and hidden me under your floor?”
He crosses to the wall and flips off the light switch. No reason to use up the electricity now Mrs. Butters isn’t here.
The voice that sounded just like Dad.
Cas’ lips tightened, and his eyes darted to the side. Dean could smell the blood in the water, and he was absolutely starving.
“Cas!” Dean screams, hands clutching at his chest.
), and Dean wants to stroke his hair, or kick him in the stomach, or grab him and pat him down to make sure that every single hair on his body was back.
property, not any angel’s. Cas should know by now. You don’t just go around touching another dude’s stuff.
you, Cas!” Dean was shouting now. And it felt good, but now that he was human, he knew that taking his anger out on Cas was a mean thing to do.
The word seems to be coming from somewhere else, some
Great. So now Dean was a teenage girl crying in his boyfriend’s arms.
Anyway, I cannot overstate how much I appreciate every single comment or kudos. So please, if you have the time/energy/inclination and want to become my new favorite person, let me know what you thought! Either way, thank you so much for reading <3
4. I actually speak some sign language and have spent a lot of time around Deaf people, so writing Eileen was SUPER fun/interesting! For example, Deaf people are in general a lot "ruder" than hearing people. They just say it like it is. So when Eileen talks about Dean acting weird and wanting to screw Cas, those are just her honest interpretations, not her being catty. It was a pretty fun characterization.
He laughs out loud, even thought it’s not particularly funny. He lets himself fall backwards on the bed.
“I turned into a demon! I hurt you, Cas. I left you for dead. I made you go insane, I almost killed you, I…”
Almost.
not real when you’re not around. You just…you make everything…bright. And happy. Sometimes you just make everything so real that I can’t even stand it.”
, the one that could command half of heaven. And his eyes were narrowed but still full of emotion, and
“I believe so,” Cas said, after thinking it over for a moment. Dean didn’t know when he was gonna remember that Cas didn’t get the
For the last two weeks, Dean had slept just as little as he could get by with. He’d tire himself out working on Baby or a new lead, and then fall asleep wherever he was at the time. Sam was starting to get worried.
Dean had felt those lips before, under his clenched fist and bruising knuckles. He’d known they were soft. He’d imagined how they’d feel under his own, just after jerking off to that goddamn picture and right before rolling out of bed to fight the most dangerous son of a bitch he could find.
The kiss is messy and full of teeth and the sweet taste of saliva mixed with blood. Dean’s been so ready for this for the past eleven years.
kid. Cas’ kid.
Cas left his angel blade on the floor. He walked over to the door like a condemned man walking to the gallows, and as the door closed Dean heard the beginning of a heartbroken sob.
Dean and Cas are acting weird. Like, weirder than normal. And not in the "I'm possessed by Lucifer" or "I have a mark on my arm that's making me kill people" way, Sam can deal with that kind of weirdness. No, it's the strange behavior that makes Cas wear a sweatshirt meant for the size of his true form. The kind that makes Dean wear three jackets in sweltering heat. The kind that makes Eileen roll her eyes and call them pea-brains.
He shakes Cas’ shoulder, then again, and again until Cas’ eyes finally open. It’s only been a few days, but Dean’s breath still freezes in his chest at the sight of those eyes.
“Wouldn’t mind it if you fucked me,” he adds, almost as an afterthought. “Take off that trench coat and just do me up against the wall. I’d be good for you.”
“See,
“I miss you,” Dean tells Cas, staring up at his ceiling. “I wish we’d gotten in one kiss, you know? Just one. Just before you left. I mean, if I’m actually wishing things, I wish you were still here. So I could beat the shit out of you for even thinking about leaving me…us. I mean us.”
“No, I won’t leave. Not if you don’t want me to.”
“No,” Cas moans, so quietly that Dean can barely hear him. “No, please…”
easy to kill.
1. My amazing beta reader for this story is doing something super cool (and purposefully vague) that basically proves what I've always thought: they'll be a broadway star one day. You all heard it here first.
“Jesus Christ!” Dean yelps, jumping back and shaking his hand. What had Dad always told him?
“Would I go into the friggin’ Empty and drag you out by your stupid trench coat if I didn’t want to see you? You’re my best friend, man. I don’t see why a little crush should stop that. Hell, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel the same way.” Dean pulls away, clapping Cas on the shoulder and stifling a yawn.
“‘I want you to break down the door,’” Cas says in that gravelly voice that sends shivers up and down Dean’s spine. He’s almost too concentrated on the voice to understand what Cas is saying, which makes no sense anyway. ‘“Next time I see you, you’re gonna grab me and shove me up against whatever’s nearby.’”
“I love you too.”
when he wanted Cas to show up.
“Shouldn’t we go back to the bunker first?” Sam always thinks about everything so much. Like right now, he’s probably gauging the number of people around them, and just how big a headline a grungy man in an overcoat appearing from thin air would be. But Dean has always been an action kind of man.
real, sometimes it feel’s like
Jack closes his eyes, and Dean can see the burning gold through his eyelids.
Dean has taped a picture of Cas to his wall. His gun is loaded. He’s not wearing ear protection, and he hopes he goes deaf. He hopes one of the bullets ricochets off the concrete and rips into his skin. He hopes he causes Cas even more torment by being in pain that he can’t heal.
Dean sighs and runs his hands over his face, dripping cool water down his forehead.
“I don’t see that we have anything more to discuss.” Cas refused to meet Dean’s eyes, staring down at one of the Busty Asian Beauties instead. “You have used a picture while engaging in self-pleasure—” trust Cas to use the driest language ever “—and described this body as
Dean sucks in a shuddering breath.
Love you all <33
“Went into town today, first time in a long time. It’s kinda nice, seeing people again. Knowing I saved all their lives. But you know whose life I couldn’t save?”
“While we’re on the subject, why
“Don’t you
He held up the wrinkled black and white photo, the last one Dean had ever taken with Ellen and Jo. He had the rest of the picture laying around somewhere, probably shoved into one of the books in the library as a bookmark. Sam wouldn’t be too happy when he found it, but that hadn’t happened yet.
He opens his mouth—to scream Cas’ name? To whisper a prayer? To shout a curse?—but all that comes out is a torrent.
“Yes, I can. I have to.” Jack gently pushes Dean off to the side. Dean knows that Jack could’ve easily blown him two states away.
“Hi, Cas.” Cas smiles a faint, exhausted smile. And not for the first time, Dean realizes just how often he’s stared at those lips.
And then he remembers.
Dean was wrong. He very much likes where this is going.
why. That’s why I…Cas, I’ve been a disappointment forever. I disappointed Dad, I disappointed Sammy, and Lisa, and Cassie, and every other goddamn person I’ve ever met. Hell, I even disappoint me. Why don’t you get that? I’m horrible to you. I sent you away. I let you die for me, and then I left you in Purgatory. Why the hell are you still here, Cas? Why don’t you just give up on me like everyone else?”
“Why are you still here?” Dean asked, leaning forward in the chair, ignoring the way the ropes tightened across his chest. “I’m sure you have more important things going on. Me and Sammy, we spent our whole childhood alone together. Another couple minutes won’t kill us. Unless I get my way. But even then, it’ll only kill him.
“When you’re working a case and you’re trying to get the lowdown on some son of a bitch, you do. But I’m not some random-ass witness in a hick town. We’re…friends. You could just ask me, man.”
you. That’s gotta mean something, right? Us against the world, man. Us against the world.”
Again, thank you for reading. I hope you all have a wonderful day!
“I was a babysitter once,” Cas said, not raising his head or opening his eyes. “It was an interesting experience.”
And now he had another chance. A chance to walk away from Cas and never mention this again. But hey, he wasn’t doing anything else today. And he hadn’t talked to Cas in way too long.
Maybe Cas could’ve kept going forever. Dean didn’t really know if he needed to breathe or not. But Dean was, once again, just a lousy human. But even though he had to pull away, he didn’t pull far. His rasping breaths minded with Cas’, their foreheads still touching. Cas’ hands were clasped around the back of his neck, and Dean wasn’t even worried that it would turn into a chokehold.
Maybe, if he asked very nicely, Crowley would let him into hell early. As in,
And Dean wants to punch him in the face for leaving them (leaving
2. I spent SO MUCH time color picking a specific photo of Cas' eyes and typing the hexidecimal code into various paint sites to get the color name. Do you think I got it right?
And now, Dean is finally going to do more than stare.
But he had about a zero precent chance of getting into heaven after all he’d done. And he and Cas, they could work things out. They’d stayed friends through so many betrayals and fights and failed attempts to become the new god. Why should this be any different?
“No! Well, in a way…actually, no. Come on, Cas. Of course I’m not sword fighting with a friggin’ picture!”
Dean rolls over. He smooths his finger over the trigger of the gun laying under the pillow.
“Hope the Empty’s all it’s cracked up to be. Hope you’re having a fucking wonderful vacation up there, you bastard.”
“And why,” Cas continued, still crosslegged on the floor but looking just as menacing as he had when he’d struck down Dick. Dean was somewhere between glad he’d been cut off—because what the hell was he going to say to that?—and nervous about what Cas would say next. Dean didn’t even think he could
And then he got it.
But Dean’s throat burns and his lungs ache and the word is ripped from him like Cas himself was, just a week ago.
rip up my floorboards? I’m getting some mixed signals, man.”
Has it really been a week?
By the time he gets to the kitchen, all the slamming and the trip to the Empty have come together to make every muscle in his body ache. He kinda wishes he’d kept that hammer he’d tried to kill Sammy with back when he’d gone all black eyes, for the sake of convenience.
,” Dean whispers against his mouth. Cas slips his tongue past Dean’s lips, and Dean just lets him. It’s Cas. It’s
“Damnit, Cas, I said it! I love you too. Now get your feathery ass down here or I swear to God I’ll never speak to you again.”
It had been so much easier to carry on a conversation when Dean hadn’t cared what anyone else said.
“Cas.
“I will not force you to tell me anything, Dean.”
Well.
And then there's the way Cas is looking at Dean...
“They missed you too, o‘course. Sammy’s spent the last couple of weeks—” three months, two weeks, five days his brain supplies, but Cas doesn’t need to know he kept count “—reading up on all the Empty lore. He’s the one who figured out how to get you back.”
But his imagination was nothing—
But all that build up was just going to make Dean’s eventual success that much sweeter. He had years of practice, manipulating witnesses to tell him all the juicy details of whatever crime they were investigating. Hell, he’d even gotten Death on his side a time or two.
“Yeah,” Sam says, shooting Dean a disapproving glare. “You’ll do a great job.”
All that matters is that Dean is kneeling next to Cas, and he’s breathing, he’s
y’know?”
He blinks blearily over at the clock: it’s almost seven. So Cas had been standing there for who knows how long, watching him sleep? If he hadn’t just gotten back from the Empty, Dean would punch him for being goddamn creepy.
“Dean—” Cas started, and Dean looked up to see that they were just inches apart. Good. Right now, he didn’t want personal space.
“I don’t want to. Please don’t make me. I won’t hurt him.”
Yeah, Dean had remembered love when he was a demon. It was destructive, weak, and useless. He’d felt it, and then he didn’t anymore. It was a point of attack instead of a breach in defense. He’d been a smug son of a bitch, hadn’t he? Hadn’t cared about anything but Cas’ pain. That kinda nearsightedness could get you killed on a case.
“You aren’t hurting anyone.” Dean suddenly realizes that Cas hadn’t just left him, he’d accepted an eternity of torture to save Dean. Because he loved him. Which is honestly more than Dean’s ever expected out of life. “It’s me, Cas. Jack brought you back. You’re alive. You’re here. It’s me.”
“Shut
But Dean didn’t want to get blood all over his bedroom floor.
“No, I ensured that she was not a product of deceit. I performed all the necessary tests before you moved in with her.”
“Omniscient.” Jack’s eyes light up, and Dean has the feeling he doesn’t like where this is going. “So I can go to Heaven, and Hell? What about Purgatory? Or…the Empty?”
Sam. Every time Dean saw his little brother, he had to fight the urge to start a chick-flick moment, complete with tears and hugging. Which was just so damn embarrassing. What was he, a thirteen year old girl? He’d apologized for trying to kill Sam with a hammer. Sam had nodded his acknowledgement. It was over, okay? It wasn’t like was gonna do it again. Him and Sammy, they were probably okay. It wasn’t like Sam had never tried to kill him. Hell, he’d succeeded once or twice. So Dean knew he’d carry around that guilt for the rest of his life, but whatever. They were okay.
“I’m going to get Sam,” Cas said, turning away from Dean. “Maybe he’s found something to help you.”
leave bed without your gun. If he gets killed now, it’ll be Dean’s own damn fault.
“Left us?” For the first time, the anger that Dean had been so carefully keeping out of his voice fights its way to the surface. He grabs it in a stranglehold and drags it back down. No use letting Cas know how he’s cried every night of the last three months, two weeks, and five days.
“Hey, Cas, remember the time I made you a mixtape? Hope you enjoyed it, man. Took me forever.”
He could make so many excuses.
“What?” Jack calls back.
None of it matters.
Sometimes, Dean wonders exactly how much Sam knows.
“Cas!” Dean stands up, stretches his aching back, and pulls Cas into a tight hug. As usual, Cas’ arms hang uselessly by his sides. “Good to have you back, man.”
, and it didn’t feel wrong. It felt more right than anything—even listening to Zeppelin with Sammy in the passenger seat and Cas in the back—had ever felt before.
“Yeah, Jack. I forgive you. Do you forgive me?” Sam had been a stickler for
Cas made a little choking sobbing noise. His shoulders were slumped, and his head was bent. Dean had done it.
“But you
“Nope,” Dean said. He was distantly aware that this was up with the dumbest things he’d ever done. He was cutting off a fully powered-up friggin’ angel, not to mention trying to continue a conversation he’d been avoiding for the past six years. “You ain’t leavin’ until you hear me out. So get comfortable.” He gestured to the bed, and when Cas didn’t move, shoved him so that he stumbled backwards onto the bed. And yeah, the shove felt good. But not when Cas was looking at him with those puppy dog eyes.
“And the Cas came back, the very next day…” he sang out loud, then laughed. He liked his new laugh, harsher. Meaner. Cas didn’t like it, that was obvious from the way he held his shoulders. Good.
. I’m just an idiot with a car and a gun. You do everything for me, and I do nothing for you. I don’t even deserve to be your friend, okay?”
Castiel didn’t respond. Dean hadn’t expected him to. He was about as interesting as the shelves he was standing next to. At least they creaked sometimes. Cas had been standing over there for hours, and Dean didn’t think he’d even breathed.
As in, fighting. Rolling around on the bed, maybe on the floor, crumbling up all those porno magazines as they took turns straddling each other. They’d both have fucked-up hair and their breath would rasp, and there would be a thin sheen of sweat just over Cas’ lip. Maybe he’d lost his trench coat and jacket somewhere along the way, and his muscles were rippling under his shirt with the sleeves all rolled up…
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not sure, buddy,” Dean said, carefully stepping around his magazines to sit on the bed. Sure, he didn’t use them anymore, but that didn’t mean they didn’t deserve respect. “But you can ask anyway, and we’ll see.”
Through his black eyes, he’d been able to see so many more shades of gray. Nothing was completely innocent, and humans weren’t that different from monsters. He’d tuned out that voice like a classical radio station done whatever the hell he wanted. He’d taken care of himself, not Sammy. He’d killed and screwed whoever he wanted, and didn’t feel like he was disappointing Dad or using some random lay to get over Cas.
Dean almost falls out of his chair, where he’s been sitting up all night—supposed to be sitting up all night—to look out for Cas. Kinda ironic, him watching over a sleeping angel. At least it would have been if he hadn’t fallen asleep on the job.
Dean could smell the nervousness coming from his mate and he did not like it! He threaded their fingers together and gave them a reassuring squeeze.
He looked up from the face of his sleeping son to look at his mate's wings. They were glorious: a true shifting black that had his own green and the Winchesters' purple woven throughout, depending on how the light landed on his feathers. The bottom of the wings varied in all colors of blue that had been created, making Cas' wings one of the most unique set Dean had ever seen.
Well, crap on a cracker. The angel (Was he still? He's an omega, so…?) passed out in her lap again. She pulled herself out from under him to get him some water to help cool him down. As she looked at the clock, she figured she still had time to call the boys. The large vamp nest that Garth asked them to take care of would soon be the target of the Winchesters.
He walked down the stairs to enter the club heading straight for the bar. He desperately needed something cold to drink. Dean smiled, winked, waved at the women and men that called to him as he walked. He had to avoid a few hands, too, but most of audience was well behaved.
“Dean claimed her,” he mumbled into his alpha’s chest. He refused to let go until his tears were done. He felt safe. He knew Emmie was safe and he was going to take the comfort he was being given. Dean was holding him as if he was precious, rubbing circles around his back. Cas was amazed at how quickly he was attached to this gorgeous angel.
“Look at all these omegas!”
"Alright, it's my turn." Dean kissed Emmie and Cas before standing up to take his son from Gabriel (who made him promise to give him back, soon!) to present him to Michael.
Thank for reading and enjoy!
“I’ll try, Alpha.” He felt the blush on his cheeks from calling Dean ‘Alpha.’
“You marked her?”
<3Roo
“Charlie?”
Also the next chapter will start out with a time jump.
"Hello Ladies and Gentleman. My name is Crowley and I wish to thank you again for coming to the opening of Crowley's Club. I know, I know. It's not very original but I don't care. Now, we have something different coming up. I'm sure if you know anything about the Alphas in The Alpha Review, you know that some of these studs like to dance for someone they pick up on stage. There has only been one dancer that has never danced with someone on stage."
“You most certainly can, Cas.”
“That is Prince Castiel. That is what he smells like.”
“Dean, you are the best alpha I know. You, and you alone, raised me to be the alpha I am. Ya' know when I met Jess, I didn’t feel worthy of her. I kept her at arm’s length until I had a conversation with Bobby. He told me that you don’t get to choose who you love or who loves you. He reminded me that we aren’t guaranteed tomorrow, so you should hold on to love, not run from it.”
“Do you like what you see, Alpha?” he asked as coyly as he could with his slick soaking the bed.
“You know it does.”
Dean had never been this hard or felt this desperate for anything in his life. He released the hold on his alpha and growled, lips still right next to Cas' ear. The tip of his cock immediately lined up right where it was supposed to, and he began to push. Ready for his alpha, Cas' body opened up and welcomed him in, and Dean sank into the heat of his mate.
“Dean, talk to him again, please.”
He had kissed before, but never had he been so consumed with the taste of someone. He could almost taste the honey scent of Dean in his mouth. It was heavenly. Cas let his hands wander from the broad shoulders (hot damn!) down to the alpha’s hands that were holding him by the hips.
He stood still like only an angel could, while he let his eyes roam over the human omegas in the room. There were male, female, short, tall, skinny, fat, blonde, brunette, red, and raven-haired omegas in the room. Sam counted over hundreds of omegas standing around with looks of disbelief on their faces.
He was also now mated to a strong, wealthy, handsome alpha, who also happened to be a prince. And he would never have to worry about Castiel advancing to the throne, because he was at the back of a long line of royals. All the advantages of nobility without the menacing machinations of politics.
happiness. John’s afraid that being mated and having pups would soften them. I think its best if you just don’t worry about John Winchester.” She tossed Emmie (it was gonna take a while to get used to that!) over to him.
“Is this how you do it? Do you do it faster, slower, harder? Show me, Omega. Show me how you would jack off, looking at the poster with my body on it.”
He closed his eyes after seeing Dean’s face coming closer. He expected Dean to ravish him, but he was surprised when he felt the gentle nudge of a nose against his. Cas leaned into the palm Dean lay against his cheek, slightly turning so he could scent the alpha’s wrist. He felt the puff of air on his lips right before Dean finally touched his lips with his.
“Isn’t he coming in?” Damn, he sounded needy, but he couldn’t help it. He needed Dean.
Sure enough when the Alpha looked at the floor he was leaving a trail of feathers as he paced around his living room.
“Fuck, Dean! How the hell did I get naked and you’re still wearing your damn jeans. Off!”
"Cassie."
He was changing from his g-string to a pair of black leather boy shorts when Benny walked backstage.
The final picture took Dean’s breath away. Bal was sitting on a couch holding a newborn Cas with a sign next to him that read “Big Brother For Life!”. Cas was the most beautiful pup he had ever seen with those blue eyes dominating his face, a headful of unruly dark hair (somethings didn’t change apparently), and he was squinting up at Bal.
“Damn straight, man.”
“Dean? Who is it? Someone you recognize, obviously. Tell me, Omega.” The prince deeply desired to know who had captured his omega's notice.
Thanks for reading.....xx
Cas was surprised when everyone around him began going wild. Clapping, banging on the table, whistling. They all started chanting the name Dean. The Alpha must be something to get this kind of reaction. He was going to have to wait to find 'his Alpha' when this dance was over. There was no way he could do anything with this commotion going on.
Looking up, he saw Sam give him a sympathetic nod. He continued loading things into the trunk and pulled out jugs of water. That was the closest thing to showers they would be getting right now. Just enough so his Baby’s leather seats didn’t get ruined.
There were even days over the past three years that he had looked forward to being given to Lord Zachariah. He shuddered under his covers and determined to think of better things.
Panicked omega permeated the air, and Cas’ hand now had a vice-grip on him. “WHAT! HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?!? NO, WHY???”
“Omega, reach back and hold yourself open for me, please.” He wasn’t sure if it was what he asked or the fact that he
He tossed his forearms over Cas' shoulders as he slid from a side to side wave of muscles back to the S-wave like a cobra. Dean could smell his Omega's arousal now. It wasn't just him getting hard for him, he was leaking slick now, and he wanted that amazing smelling flavor on his tongue. He leaned forward to Cas' ear again.
“Absolutely.”
Fortuitously, the gardens were next to the huge lawn that was to host the AO Meet. Shortly after the sun's zenith, the alphas would arrive and the gathering would begin. Dean could already see the colorful tents and tables that were soon to be filled with tasty nibbles and thirst-quenching libations. The area was swarming with busy servants.
"Cas. Who was the guy who called you 'Cassie'?"
“Dean, your mother and I will be in the next room for the dinner part of this ceremony. Say your goodbyes now and we shall see you soon.”
“Cas, whatever you need to ask me, it’s alright. I'm listening.”
Son of a bitch!, Dean thought but he wasn’t sure it if was what Cas had said, or the kiss, but he could feel tears in the corner of his eyes at the same time he could feel his cock filling out more to rub along the slick groove between his omega’s cheeks. It was gonna be awesome and he was more than ready to lose his virginity with Cas.
“Yeah, something wrong with that?” the alpha smirked back as he lined up his cock, rubbing with the head and teasing Cas’ entrance.
"Cassie! Good news!"
“Sure...hang on.”
"Oh, now, Emmie," he whined as she began rubbing the plums on his chest after he had removed his shirt in an effort to save it. He side eyed his omega hearing him snorting in laughter.
"I don't know, sweetheart. He will tell you that after your rut is over and you report for your first Virtue assignment. I hope he lets you have a houseful. I can't wait to spoil them."
"What the fuck, Cassie? Faith in what? The Angels?"
"No! I mean no, you don't have to change anything for me. I love you just the way you are and it makes me happy that you want to take the time to feed, clean, and play with our pup." Dean kissed him again on the nose just to see him go crossed eyed trying to watch. When he snickered Cas pushed him away by placing his hand on Dean's face. "Go wash our pup but come back soon, Alpha."
“He refuses to use the dildo I bought for him. I’m having a hard time keeping him hydrated and he’s only eating a bit here and there. But I promise, I'm doing the best I can.”
“Tell me, please!”
involved.
They worked like a well-oiled machine until there was no one left but for Alistair, the Senator of their district.  Cas was surprised to see him here since he kept hearing that Alistair's wife was trying to keep her own bakery open with not a lot of success, which she blamed on Cas's store.
Cas! Give me your knot!”—and he was caught and felt his canines lengthen, so he grabbed Dean's hair, pulled his neck to the side and bit him. And surrendered to ecstasy.
So all he had to do was introduce himself and greet them and, ah, here they were.
Sam walked back to his station to wait for the signal that it was time to walk the alphas through. Michael sent him the message that he was to keep an eye on the cute omega until he could decide what to do about the whole situation (Actually, Michael told him to watch out for “his brother’s mate’s brother.” Now how did Michael know that?) Sam was very curious about that omega. He was also very confused, because he found himself attracted to him.
Dean could smell his mate getting more upset and he really didn’t like that. He wondered if his mom wasn’t happy with her son’s mate after all. Before he could start spiraling out of control, Cas stopped him with a soft purr.
He could feel Dean’s whole body vibrating with tension. Cas raised his hips and his cock rubbed along Dean’s larger one, causing them both to groan. When he did it again, the alpha ground his hips down at the same time. Oh, that felt amazing.
“Well, it’s just that you, Sam, Michael, and everyone that’s here has accepted Emmie and me without reservations or question. Someone is missing though, and I wondered if it was purposefully, or is your Mate avoiding what is a day of celebration?” He tried (and failed) to keep his voice and scent neutral but he had to know what he was up against regarding John Winchester.
“Yeah, Dean, it’s me again.”
All Hail the QueenMaire for her wonderful Beta skills <3 <3
“So, after breakfast with Bal tomorrow, I can’t wait to introduce you to my parents when we go pack my things.”
It seemed as if the alpha had a sense of self preservation, since he merely dabbed at his lip with the back of a hand and nodded in silence.
Sam was out of the car before Dean had slammed to a stop, chasing after the two alphas that ran as soon as they saw the Impala zooming up the dirt road. Good, that meant two were already dead, and he could take care of the three that were left.
Cas unbuttoned the alpha’s jeans and teased the zipper down as he sucked on Dean’s tongue. Oh, the things he wanted that tongue to do to him! But he was apparently going too slow for Dean, ‘cuz in the blink of an eye, Cas found himself sitting naked on top of his also, gloriously naked mate!
"They are coming to Lawrence on your birthday and I got us tickets to the show!"
“Mine?”
As Dean was letting Emmie drink, he stared out the sliding doors at the gifts Michael had left for them to find in the morning. He sent a 'thank you' thought to the elder alpha and got a reply that the bouncy house was strong enough for him to join his pup and that she needed to learn how to swim, hence the pool on the other side of their yard. He noticed that Sam and Gabe were standing outside the guest house looking like they were having a very serious conversation. Dean hemmed and hawed about interrupting, but his curiosity (and his pup's grunts of excitement as her gaze followed a hummingbird) made him walk out the door and call out a hello. He watched as the two men walked over, smiles on their faces and their shoulders bumping with each step.
Charlie stepped forward and curtsied. “Your Royal Highness, if I may?” She barely hesitated to wait for the prince's nod. “Sir, may I present Master Dean, son of Baron Winchester. Sir, this is His Royal Highness, Prince Castiel.”
He walked into the kitchen to get one last dessert to share with his brother and dearest friend. He had made a new recipe that morning that was appropriately enough a new version of an angel food cake.
“You really like it, Cas? We can change anything you want, plus we need to fix a room for our pup.” He was kissing Emmie’s head after every word just to hear her laugh. Cas’ inner omega wanted to purr.
“Fuck off!”
She hugged him again. “You are most welcome. I'm gonna go work on making something for us to eat for dinner, and no arguments! You will eat or I'll tell Dean.”
“Son of a bitch! Cas, you are. So. Hot. I can’t believe that you’re mine. You gonna come again, Beautiful?”
“What’s wrong, Charlie?”
“Before we go where our instincts and desires are telling us, I just need you to know that I will never let your Father hurt you or our pups, ever,” he promised against Dean’s lips before sliding his tongue in the alpha’s mouth.
“Since?” the prince prompted. He had leaned forward, perhaps to encourage Dean to explain.
Dean was watching the angel standing in front one of the huge, double doors into the hall waiting for his signal to open the door and proceed. Just when he thought he would pass out from excitement, the angel looked him in the eye and gave him one nod. This was it.
This really isn't a chapter. It is a bonus scene that was asked for, and I thought it would be fun. Hope it meets expectations.
“Oh! Is that why Gabriel has remained in Heaven? It seems as if Michael has shared more with you than with me.”
"Cause I saddle up my horse
but Cas whimpered as he hurriedly complied.
“Lord Winchester, if you say another word disrespecting my mate, I will pummel you into the ground and send home your broken body.
Suddenly Dean was standing next to him pulling him over to the chair. Cas made himself comfortable. Just as the music started the Alpha did something odd. Cas had seen many of these types of dances on the videos people posted an in all of them the person in the chair was facing the audience. Dean turned him so he was facing the curtain.
He stepped back into the circle of his mate’s arm, pulling the alpha’s nose to his neck, letting him scent Cas’ understanding and love. They had the rest of their lives to get to know each other, but at this moment Cas needed to taste his mate.
Cas had twenty minutes left before he had to walk to Alistair's office to turn himself in. He did not want him to send his men after him, they were known to be destructive in their attempts to get people to go with them. He had made a quick will leaving everything to his brother. Their friend Balt, helped them out with the wording on the will. He was still sniffling, Gabe was blowing his nose, and Balt was drinking his espresso with tears pouring down his cheeks.
**********
Sitting on the back patio swing was one of Dean's favorite activities, especially on Saturday afternoons when his whole family was there. This weekend though, Sammy and Gabriel were missing from Family Fun Day festivities, but that couldn't be helped since the pair was on their Mating-Moon. Sammy had to go through a year of training for his 'top secret' job before Michael would okay their mating, and Gabriel had to go through Omega School since he was so young in the Sire's eyes. The omega hated it until he made some friends and turned them into tricksters, too.
“Grammie, that’s what I used to call my grandmother, if that’s alright.” Somehow he wasn’t surprised that his mate got his shyness from his mother too.
I’ll admit I could feel it, the first that we touched
Dean threw Cas’ leg from being draped over his arm, to up and over his shoulder as he stretched his body higher for better leverage. When he stopped to look at Cas, he stared for a minute at the beautiful man spread out beneath him. His blue eyes were almost completely omega gold, his mouth was open, panting, and there was the deep blush of arousal all over his body. And it was all for Dean.
Dean stopped just inside the door with his eyes on his feet. This was the hardest part for him: not being able to look for his omega. He wasn’t allowed to raise his eyes unless his omega stopped him. They had only just started when Dean heard a whimper from his omega, causing his inner alpha to issue a welcoming growl. Sam then pushed him on to begin walking down the aisle between the lines of omegas.
Dean could smell his and Sam’s anger in the car, and he was glad that Sam didn’t add his ‘worried’ scent to the mix. Baby was gonna stink for a while as it was.
"Cassie? Have you actually lost your mind?"
This is for my ABO BINGO SQ: Heaven Needs More Angels & Reverse/Verse.
“Crap on a cracker, Dean! He wants you to chase him. Go chase and claim your omega!” He watched as she opened the bunker door, only taking a split second to smile at her before roaring and running inside. He had an omega to claim!
He knew had a few dances lined up, so he swiped the towel through his hair one last time before he made himself walk back out the room full of Betas and Omegas that were waiting for him.
He was so lost in the flavors exploding in his mouth that he didn’t quite realize that Cas had had enough. One second, he’s tongue deep in his omega, and the next Cas had flipped over and Dean was face-planting on his mate’s hard cock. Huh. It was a very pretty cock, so he did what came naturally, and swallowed him down until his nose was buried in the dark hair at the base.
"Every day with you and our family is perfect, Alpha. The day we met, I was sure I was about to die, but it turned out to be the true beginning my life. I love you." He certainly couldn't resist capturing his mate's lips in a kiss before he began pushing the swing with his foot.
But the claimed omegas rarely objected, either. Watching alphas fight for the right to mate them was biologically exciting, and the smell of their pheromones and arousal brought them to a state that almost felt like heat. At the end of a claim fight, the winner would take one look at their “prize,” and most omegas instinctively ran. The alpha would give chase and immediately mate the omega wherever they were caught. Most matings were downright messy.
Cas' eyes immediately opened wide. “Ah! What the...Dean. Silly Alpha, what a way to wake me. Well, since you’re down there...”
"How many children do you think Michael will let us have?"
He slowly raised his head before opening his eyes to see the most beautiful omega ever created, and he was his mate! He was just a few inches shorter than Dean and he had the bluest eyes, but they held unshed tears. Dean didn’t want his mate to be sad.
“I’m not concerned about furniture, Dean, and I feel at home with you, the place doesn’t matter. I mean eventually, I’m sure we’ll redecorate, but for now I just want to get there and build a nest. Oh! Do you have a nesting bed??” The omega was definitely upset now.
Dean stood with blood still dripping down his face, machete in hand, when he dialed Charlie’s number.
Without too much detail I did Not have another heart attack like we thought I did, and after several days of tests Drs determined that the heart disease I do have is still where it was, no worse, and nothing new is wrong. I had a case if Angina that scared us all into thinking I was having another heart attack. I had wonderful Drs n nurses to help me along with my family. Not to mention all the love n support from you all. Your messages meant so much.
“You’ve never been with anyone?” The thought had his alpha pacing back and forth, wanting to burst forward and Claim His Mate.
He watched as Dean walked over to wrap his free arm around his shoulder, nudging Cas to lay his head on him. He wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist and settled in to watch Emmie scenting the air. He laughed when she sneezed, scaring herself into crying.
“Son of a bitch.”
“Omega.”
Hearing his alpha talk about saving the nesting bed for ‘them’ made him swoon. What an amazing man he was blessed with. He stepped around the suitcase on the floor so he could wrap him in a hug. He kept his arms around his neck as Dean spun to face him, looking down into his eyes, a bit sheepishly.
“No one will ever touch you again, Omega. You are safe. We are going to make sure that other omegas are safe from him and that he cannot do any other kind of damage. What can I do to help you?” He placed his hands on Cas’ face to look into the anguish of his gaze.
, it sounded as if he had chomped on the glass afterwards.
“That is...an effective threat.” He sighed, then nodded. “Yes, Charlie, I will try to eat later.”
Dean listened as Cas called Charlie back to return her phone.
“I see.” Cas looked down gazing at his cock, letting the alpha know that he had felt his reaction. “I believe I would like for you to take away the fear because I want this time to belong to us, completely.”
“Who will watch her while we are in rut and heat? I don’t want her to be separated from us, not when I just got you both. She doesn’t have a nursery in our nest. I didn’t know or I would have fixed one up for her, I swear!”
“Oh, Dean! That feels so good…so, good! Harder, please. I need your cock, I need your knot!” He was almost delirious in his pleasure at feeling the alpha’s knot start to catch on his rim as Dean fucked him harder and harder.
He walked over with Cas to the next room so he could explain Michael's wishes. Once they were seated, he took both the omega’s hands and rubbed circles with his thumbs to help settle him.
"I'm just very tired, hungry and tired," he grumped with a smile on his face as he gazed into Dean's eyes while taking Emmie in his arms to cuddle her.
“He doesn’t know what he needs. He's never...he just presented, Sam. He doesn’t know what he wants ‘cuz he’s in heat.”
"I bet. Hey, Mom? Do you know if Dad's coming to the ceremony?"
“Guys...” He could hear the worry in the red-head’s voice.
Charlie hung up without waiting for a response and went to check on Cas.
As he scrubbed the dried blood from the vamps’ nest out of his hair with hot water, he silently thanked Bobby Singer for teaching him general handyman skills as well as car maintenance. It felt luxurious after driving more than a day with an itchy head, but he hurried so he could go inside as soon as Charlie came out.
"Sounds like so much fun, lil' bit. Did you bounce?" he asked her as he walked into the nursery with Dean on his heels. "You go start breakfast, Alpha. I'll change our girl and meet you back in our bed. We'll watch some cartoons 'til she's asleep, then I'd like to cuddle you 'til I'm asleep again, ok?"
“Where the fuck did you get those crappy looking things, Big Bird?” Listening to Alistair laugh brought back bad memories for the omega like someone flipped a switch, and he needed to be away from him right now.
“Yes, Cas?”
“Oh! My mate is out there!”
“Yes, Dean?”
“Take me, Alpha.”
“What? Thrown from Heaven?!? How, what...Charlie. Angels don’t have genders and this really is not the time to be messing with my head.”
“You like having your nipples nibbled on?” he asked with a smirk.
"Yes, dear. When your Omega picks you, the two of you will wait in line to go before your original sire. You shouldn't have to wait long, since Michael didn't allow many to join the ceremony this time. When you stand before him your Omega will place their mating bite on your collar bone and then you will bite them. They will have already been instructed that your bite and mating with an Alpha angel will change them into a cherub and they will have duties after your offspring have stopped nursing."
“Omega.”
"You're on, assbutt." He huffed out as he laughed.
Please take care of yourself.
"Let's get you a bottle and we'll go outside and see Michael's gift, wadda ya say?" Wrapping her in his arm, he walked towards the kitchen to her chants of 'num num nums.' She definitely had a Winchester appetite.
“The second bite while we’re mated is what gives you some of my grace to change you to into an angel.” He ran his hand up and down the strong muscles of Cas’ back to soothe him.
Sam nodded once. “Yeah, no question, I will.”
“She’s my best friend from puppyhood. She's an omega who mated another omega. I would ask her to carry a pup for us. If she and Jo ever decide to have a pup I told her, if it was alright with my omega, I would help them.”
Cas loved the sleek, black Chevy next to which Dean and he were standing. He ran his hand gently along her lines, treating her like the treasure she was, and he could smell that the Alpha was pleased with his reaction to her.
"We...we just gotta get outta here alive, then it's gonna be okeydokey."
“No, Bal. There's no one. This is what I can tell you, what I know right now. Without having talked to Cas about what he wants, here are the things I want.”
“Dean, if it happens...well. I don’t know anyone better than Team Free Will that could keep our child safe. After the first time we will use condoms, of course, until we can actually talk about our future. But I promise you, whatever happens, I'm yours. Your Omega. Now, please, I need to feel you inside me again,” he said as he nipped at the alpha’s nipple, causing him to push Cas until he was again on his back. He couldn’t help giggling at his alpha’s reaction.
"G'morning, Emmie!" Dean let go as Gabe reached for his niece, and the omega broke into laughter as she flew/floated over to land in his arms.
"Cassie?"
"Feeling better?" Poor Cas had been sick for the last week with morning ("it's not just morning, Dean!") sickness.
They were both watching the handfuls of omegas and their guides (all guardians were forbidden from the Meet) walking across the lawn. No one was looking at anyone in the eyes. Steps were taken slowly.
“Cas, you’re mine. I need to claim you, Omega. I need to have my knot and my teeth inside you. I need you to tell me I can, please. Please tell me that I can have you.” He could hear the snarl of his alpha in his throat as the scent of Cas’ slick got stronger. Fuck.
“Look at me, please, Dean.”
“O.K., we can do that. Are you laying down, and comfy?”
“Yes. He is one of the lucky ones that has been deemed ready to find their mate. He’s really nervous, but I know how much he hopes to find his omega. He is a good angel, a good alpha, and he believes in Truemates. Since Michael informed him that he could stand during this ceremony, all Dean has done is try to get his home ready. He wanted it to meet all of his omega’s needs.”
His thoughtful Dean had already released his shirt's ties, so he had only to pull it over his head to uncover the top half of him. He didn't stop to look (there'd be time for that later), but dove in to cover the omega with kisses and long licks, nips and the drag of teeth along the miles of freckled skin. “
“You do make me feel good, Omega. Sometimes you just look at me and it’s all I can do to keep from coming in my pants, and now that I can have you?!? Fuck, Baby. I could live the rest of my life buried inside your heat.” Cas groaned as his alpha entered him slowly but steadily as he spoke.
“What’s going on, Sammy?” Dean whispered back. He heard a commotion just off to his right.
Dean pushed off the tempting pillow, stretched and threw back the covers. “Why did you let me sleep so late, then? You know how my father is.” After he rubbed his face, he looked up to see the servant impatiently waiting to dress him, so he huffed and slid off the bed.
“Alpha, please! I need you inside me, please!” He really couldn’t help the thrill that shot through him (especially through his dick) when his omega begged.
The beta put her hands on his biceps and turned him around to look into the food tent.
“Hey, Dean.” Her voice sounded more subdued.
“Oh. Yeah, makes sense. Be careful!”
!” as he took a corner too fast. Cas threw his head back, laughing, but kept his feet moving.
“Good. Dean, do you accept Castiel as your omega?”
Those blue eyes glared back at him halfway through his speech, and his omega grabbed his shirt with both fists. “Dean Winchester! You are so much more than what you just said. You are a big brother who has raised your little brother and you put him through school. You are buying out Bobby so he can retire, instead of just leasing a place and starting your own business. You have given your friends, along with yourself, opportunities to make money to follow their own dreams. I will not have you talking bad about my alpha, capice??”
He wanted to chuckle at the disgruntled look on the man’s face, but then Cas slapped his hand away from his cock and wrapped his own hand around it. Dean’s mouth went dry as the omega leaned back supporting himself with one hand on Dean’s raised knee (he wanted to be a helpful alpha), and began stroking himself with slow, even motions.
“Alpha.”
He let the smell of Cas’ heat scent wash over him. Oh, his room smelled amazing. Dean could barely keep from grabbing his cock and jerking off all over the bed. The blankets were pushed all together, making a nest on one side of the bed. Dean could see that the sheets were dirty with Cas’ come and slick. Fuck. He needed to get a move on and bring his omega back to their nest to claim him. His inner alpha was begging for him to get his omega’s scent all over him.
“Right away.” And it literally was. Somehow (he guessed he would learn eventually) Alfie made the bowl appear out of thin air. He thanked him before returning to his own dinner. Mary refused him when he said he could feed Emmie, saying that it was her privilege. He shrugged and accepted that his pup had many more people (angels) who loved her, too.
Dean walked up to his brother and wrapped him in a hug, wings and all. He had always taken care of Sammy and that wouldn’t stop any eon soon. Their dad had never really made time for them except to issue orders and train them, daily. Mary, their mom, was a much better parent and Dean didn’t believe it was just because she was an omega. She just radiated love all the time, even before becoming a Cupid.
Sorry it's been a minute since I've updated this story, I'm still working on my Bingo challenges, and sometimes my health just gets the best of me.
“Thank you, Dean.” He could feel his absence as soon as he walked out of the room. Huh. That was new. He smiled at Emmie as Mary laid the pup in his arms before sitting next to him on the couch. She was being such a good pup, even with all the new smells surrounding her.
"What do you need, Dean? You cleaned til everything is sparkling, you had Mom give you a fresh haircut and grooming, and you showered til you used all the hot water."
“No, I'm not mad, Angel. I'm glad you told me and I'm so sorry it took this for me to step up and admit how I have felt about you. Years, Cas, we’ve wasted years.” He was surprised to see Cas smile at him.
“Dean, Alpha. If you register for a room smelling like you do, with my scent on you, too, well. I’ve read too many reports of the police showing up, to make sure that an omega isn’t being forced. I think it’s wonderful, but I don’t need them.”
“Yeah, Charlie-girl, put him on. Sammy, pull over a minute.”
He danced forward sitting in Dean's lap making sure that he was right on Dean's cock.
"Gabe, please. Just help me do what I need to. Please."
He turned onto the road for the bunker on two wheels, knowing that the roar of her engine, combined with the gravel flying, would alert the alphas there. He
“They don’t want you to see the bloodshed, Charlie.” The brothers smiled at each other listening to Cas explain the reasoning.
Dean glanced over as the thought sunk into Sam’s brain at the same time. These alphas had traveled over a thousand miles to grab Cas. Yeah, that wasn’t happening.
He accepted his brother’s help taking off his flannel, wanting to be able to move easier as he tore apart the assholes at his door. Dean purposefully thought of them stalking and chasing Cas that far with something vile on their minds. He thought about what they would have done with his angel had they caught him.
“I just don’t want to stop once I get my hands on your body.”
“Hurry.” He couldn’t help the growl that was in his voice. Dean had very little control left of his inner alpha, who wanted nothing more than to have his cock and teeth buried in his omega.
“Will I change immediately?”
"Yeah, what the hell? He's a big, grown Omega. He can bathe by himself."
He threw his head back and howled in sadness.
“You’re not mad?”
“Let’s do this and then cuddle our pup for a bit, hmm?”
He had known it would be his best friend, Benny, that spoke for them all. He always called Dean out on shit, and that's one reason why they were so close.
Emmie woke crying upon hearing her omega daddy yelling. Dean picked up the pup and placed her on his shoulder. As she quieted down with her face planted in her alpha's neck, he motioned for Cas to follow him from the room. This was not something that the whole room needed to hear, and they were definitely listening after Cas’ outburst. Michael gave him a nod and motioned for the pup. He waited for Cas to kiss Emmie’s head, left his own light peck over soft curls, then handed her to Michael.
The breeze balanced the warm sun beautifully and he detected a lovely scent as he walked towards the tents. He inhaled deeply and smelled the wonderful combination of fresh baked bread and honey. Suddenly he was ravenous for bread and honey, so his eyes searched the tables, even though unconsciously he knew those items were not on the list of offerings.
Gripping his torso tightly, he paused for just a moment to make sure his omega was all right. Cas moaned and shoved his ass back until they were completely connected. He gasped and thought no more. All he could do was feel. He felt his balls slapping against Cas' skin. He felt the sweat under his hands. He felt the heat and wet surrounding his cock. He felt the vibrations of Cas’ shouts and moans through his arms. His nose rubbed along his mate's neck and in his hair and he felt
“More, Alpha. Dean, I need more!”
**********
"Gabriel! What is she going to do now?"
Before he fell over backwards, he caught Dean's hand with his own and helped him up. His trousers fell to the ground.
“Dean!”
"So it's true? I will go into a rut and my Omega will go into heat as soon as we mate?"
Dean stopped directly in Cas’ personal space, so close that the omega had to tilt his head slightly to maintain eye contact.
“Charlie, so not funny.”
“Caaaas....what’s going on, Babe? Talk to me, please.” Dean put his hand on his mate's back and slowly rubbed it up and down.
On the one hand, Dean couldn’t wait to be alone with Cas, but on the other, he didn’t want to let go of his pup. He kept rubbing his nose in her hair to smell the combined scent of him, Cas, and something that was her own, like the faint hint of blueberries. His family smelled like pies. Oh, he was so in love. Huh. Wow. Dean was surprised at how quickly and easily he had fallen, but then again, his omega and pup were perfect.
"Gabriel, there is no way to stop this. You learned the same things I did in history classes. I need to get some things in order."
“Dean...gonna...I’m gonna come again!”
“Apologies.” He could feel his blush when she looked at him with one eye brow raised. Cas hated that he didn’t have control over his body at the moment, but he knew that Dean would be here soon to help him.
💙💚Roo
As he listened to the snarls, rumbles, and growls Dean was emitting grow fainter with each long stride of his alpha, it took everything in him not to answer back in moans, whimpers, or purrs. He had hidden in the room where his scent was concentrated for a reason. Dean knew he had been staying in there, so he wouldn’t think anything of the presence of Cas’ strong scent. Now that his alpha had prowled past, Cas carefully made his way to the bedroom door to make sure he was in the clear.
“When will I become an angel?” He loved the tilted head that Cas did when he was thinking. He had only known his mate for a very short amount of time but it was something he adored about the man.
“Oh! Nothing really, I'm just not sure what all I should bring this trip.” He was folding some shirts and stuffing them in a large duffle bag.
He had thought it was intense when Dean claimed him, but the thought that everyone (especially those who had watched him dance) would know that Dean belonged to him…Oh, crap! That was fucking hot.
He could feel the heat off Cas’ blush when he buried his face into Dean’s neck at his brother’s words. Dean rubbed circles on the omega’s back as he looked the beta in the eyes.
After an hour of three grown men doing the bidding of one tiny princess, Dean was exhausted and she was ready for more breakfast. He waved goodbye to the others after arranging for them all to have dinner together, then he went back into the kitchen to give his pup some mushy fruit.
Cas had refused to let Charlie turn off the cameras, although he agreed to stop recording what was going on. Both omegas wanted to make sure that their family was going to be alright.
His pelvis had also been grinding on his hard cock and he decided that Dean's pants needed to go. So he just grabbed the front and ripped them right off.
"Sit down, Gabe."
“Well, he was upstairs, and apparently his boss, Naomi, had enough of him picking you over his Heavenly responsibilities, so she threw him outta Heaven. Like, literally threw him. He said he felt his wings burn as he fell, and after impact, he felt his body change and his heat started.”
Poor, poor Jack…but aw be ok eventually ♡)
The drive was a quick one. They had only managed to get through half of Led Zeppelin's
Sam twitched. “You don’t even like Star Wars.”
Dean scoffed, then realised that he was probably right. “Whatever. Someone—Cas—can you go see if he’s alright?”
The ceiling fan whirred. Outside the window, the sky glowed with stars.
Sam wakes up peacefully.
Cas said nothing, but put a comforting arm around Dean.
[Dean’s a/n: bitch, stop making me have feelings]
“Well, what’s your favourite animal?” Dean asked, drinking from his mug.
They were still holding hands.
Pressing his forehead to the crackling weeds on the ground, Dean let out a hoarse sob. Dead bodies he had gotten used to, but Cas? Even when he had first buried the seraph’s cold vessel, it hadn’t been like this. The decaying mess on the grass seemed to be a final declaration; terrible, stark proof that Cas was really gone.
out,” Jack said. “Like he used me—uh, sort of as—something like a ladder—”
Dean looked up to see Sam’s eyes filling with tears. “Hey, come on now, none of that.” He reached up to wipe a stray tear from Sam’s face.
He got his answer soon enough. The walls of the church began to shake violently, urging the Winchesters out of the car and to the side of the building. Dean grasped at the wood, fruitlessly attempting to steady the vibrating church. The wall jumped away from his hand.
“Auntie my ass,” Dean muttered. “What do you want? Herbs? Books?”
“She enacted the Law of Surprise,” Cas said slowly, like he was explaining to a child, “and claimed what comes to greet you at the shop tomorrow.”
“Okay, well, time to go!” Dean took a few stumbling steps towards the church; the ground underneath them was beginning to shake.
Cas looked between the closet and Dean for a moment, then smiled in a way that Dean was not prepared for. “Thank you,” the angel said warmly.
“The kid likes it, of course I’m watching it.” Dean smiled, clapping his hands decisively. “Okay, I’m going to do that, and you should go do whatever.”
Ignoring his brother’s lifted eyebrows, he pressed
The kid nodded and threw both arms out, eyes glowing with desperation. The rift tore open. Dean didn’t waste a second, grabbing Jack and half-carrying him to the centre of the church. The rift was already closing. With a split-second prayer, Dean leapt through, pulling Jack and himself out of the dying world.
“We’ll be back by then,” Dean said firmly. Then, with a last glance at Sam, he stepped into the rift.
can’t do anything.”
“Sam, wake up!” Dean’s stomach roiled. “Sam!”
“I missed you,” replied Cas evenly. “With all my heart. I mean, I wasn’t exactly conscious in the Empty, but once I was, I missed you terribly.”
Cas was standing in the doorway, staring at Jack, who slept deeply under a pile of blankets.
“The Meat Man can make anything edible,” scoffed Dean, unsmiling. “Just drown it in ketchup, it’ll be fine.”
Dean beamed proudly at him. Sam smiled in relief, pulling out a skillet and some eggs. “Egg omelette special, coming right up.”
Enter more Star Wars content and a conversation much needed.
“The other version of him—we didn’t get along.” Jack kept his eyes down. “This version of you is even nicer than the other Dean, but you’re—the core of you, it’s the same.”
“I can’t—Dean—” Sam’s voice sounded raspy.
Sam sniffed. “I guess,” he said. “I just—I don’t know.”
“Samuel?” The voice of a very real doctor wafts through the door. “Do you need someone to come in?”
looked like the kid had shakily copied the letters off a newspaper.
“It feels like—grace—like Lucifer—but
Dean felt his heart drop as the world went blurry. By the time it righted itself, Sam had slumped against the coffee table, slack in the throes of unconsciousness.
“You don’t know that it will!” Cas shouted. Then, minding Sam downstairs, he moved over to Dean’s bed. “Look,” he said quietly, “that demon wants to rule the timeline. We have no way of knowing what will happen even if it does…consume you. What if it kills the rest of the town after you? What if it was lying in the first place?”
“Let’s take the job, and get back to helping people,” Dean said quietly, letting Sam go. “We owe it to them, at least.”
from empty.
“It sounds like a rejected world,” Cas said. “One that no longer satisfies Chuck. Perhaps the shadow monsters were doing good by doing bad.”
we cared about, our
Dean thought,
Next time, your Auntie Rowena might not show up when you need her.”
Sam followed suit. “Afternoon, officer,” he said. “We’re here about the disappearances. Five of them were yours?”
The final one. EIGHT MONTHS LATER.
“We will,” Sam said, and dragged Dean into the foyer. Jack was close behind.
“Are you really ready to face this foe?” Cas asked in his gravelly baritone.
Dean needed to sit down.
Cas looked unsure. “Rowena is…a possibility.”
The wall clock ticked towards midnight.
Sam looks up with wild eyes. “He’s disappearing,” he gasps. “He’s—”
Dean automatically began to comb his fingers through Sam’s hair, the way he’d done for decades whenever Sam needed him.
“Cas,” he whispered after a while.
you know?” He wiggled an eyebrow. Dean caught Sam making a face and jabbed him subtly with an elbow. “But they didn’t come back, didn’t answer no calls, nada,” continued the policeman. “We don’t know what to do. For now we’ve sealed it off and declared it a no-go-zone, but short of risking the whole department there ain’t much we can do in terms of searching.”
Dean looked up. “As soon as she sees it’s a wisp, she’ll turn tail.”
“Do I?” Sam stared mournfully at the table, tears making their silent path down his cheeks and dripping off his jaw.
Sam eyed it, but stood tall. “Hit me then,” he said. “But it won’t solve anything.”
“Ribs,” exhaled Jack. “It’s not serious, I’ll be fine—”
Sam refuses to look at Lucifer at the table. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see the Devil attempting a handstand against the wall.
Behind Dean, Sam wilted against the wall. Dean let go of Cas’s hand and gave both of them a look, one that propelled them to step back. Dean closed Jack’s door, shutting Cas and Sam out into the hallway for the moment.
“If you so wished,” Rowena said. “Under my direction, naturally.”
Jack tilted his head. “I chose what to do yesterday.”
“I know,” Dean said, breaking off his song. “Dude, you’re doing so good. You can’t blame yourself for having instincts, okay? I—I have them too.” Dean thought about how one of his instincts used to be to turn to Castiel; to search those mournful eyes for answers. He thought about how the angel used to be able to calm Jack with just a sure gaze. “You’re allowed to—to—to react to things,” he finished lamely.
“Too bad!” Dean bellowed. “Call him up.” The fingers gripping his gun trembled slightly; he shifted his stance.
