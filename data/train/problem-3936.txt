“Dean,” Cas said, tears threatening again but he had to be strong for Dean. He had asked about his pain so he had to man up, listen, and be there for him.
Dean sat next to Castiel in the car as he watched Lee kiss Claude goodbye. Claude was sobbing, and that made Dean’s eyes sting with tears too because the thought of leaving his blue eyed angel behind was unfathomable. He sniffled back his tears and Castiel gave him a small smile and they entwined their pinkies together on the seat and only detangled themselves when Gordon and Lee sat in the backseat.
love with you."
“Shit. Shit! G what did we do? What did I do?” Dean was rambling and panicking. Gordon ran towards him and held him in his arms.
“No, I think we might’ve just gotten rid of one,” Dean chuckled and the trio laughed again.
“No. His body language and general demeanor towards me were clear enough.”
“Cas-," Dean tried but it was too late because Castiel turned and briskly walked to the door and out of Dean’s apartment closing the door behind him.
“So what do you expect me to do, Michael? I can’t take that money. So find something else to do with it, like I don’t know, give it to charity or something.” Castiel whispered. He didn’t want anyone eavesdropping on this very sensitive conversation.
with his phone number and email address.
“Liked it? Babe, that was so intense and amazing. My thighs are still shaking and I can’t feel my hands or legs!” Dean snorted. “Best sex I’ve ever had.”
“Cas, I don’t know if you are on the other side of this door, or if you can hear me. Maybe I am just talking to myself, but I just need to say something.” Dean huffed and leaned his head on the door and placed his hand on it. “Cas...I...I need you. I need you in my life. I know that now, thanks to Sam for knocking sense into me. I know I hurt you more than anyone ever has-I broke your heart and now I may be asking for too much. I need you but I don’t know how to be the perfect man for you because I never was even if you saw me that way. And now, I am at your door at 2 in the morning asking you to forgive me. I am asking you to give me one more chance to prove that I am worthy of you.” Dean huffed again and realized that he had said so much without saying anything at all. He bit his lip nervously when he heard more shuffling behind the door. Castiel was home and now was his chance to say it all before it was too late.
“Really? Is that why you basically abandoned us?” Castiel asked, watching his son.
“We agreed that assumptions are dangerous, Dean,” she said as she turned the hourglass upside down starting their session.
“Yeah, but this was different. He...uh..he found magazines of...uh...naked men under my bed. You know, gay porn and he uh...he...let’s just say I was homeless for six months.”
“I was playing tennis with my brother who then decided to ditch me and hang out with ‘an old friend’ instead,” Castiel laughed. Dean smiled at him and Castiel felt like his heart would burst in his chest.
“Are you sure? Because the last time he walked out on me he was done with me and I had to grovel to get him back.”
“Sam, this is Castiel,” Dean said, introducing his brother to Castiel. Both Sam and Castiel seemed awed to meet each other for different reasons; Sam was happy to meet Dean’s longtime new friend, and Castiel was shocked at how big Sam actually was. His 6’1” frame seemed small compared to this giant.
Dean sipped his beer a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
“You look really nice in that outfit by the way,” Hannah complimented him. Dean was wearing a jockey's outfit that Castiel had given him. Castiel had insisted that they go shopping but Dean had said that since they were the same size, it was better to borrow his clothes.
“No, just the name. I need to change it because apparently there is another wine brand with that name. That’s why I came to see Mick,” Gordon explained, sipping his wine, and his face was beaming with excitement, “And you? Did you finish up the project you were working on?”
“Wherever you’re going,” Dean replied, a twinkle in his eye like he was up for anything.
“What?” Jody looked at him as if she was assessing whether he was kidding or not. She shook her head and tapped his arm playfully. “You wouldn’t hurt a fly so that’s
At some point, the pair had danced rather provocatively together, bodies grinding oh so close, but Dean managed to avoid contact when Max tried to grab his waist and grind into his ass. On seeing the almost pornographic scene in front of him, Castiel walked out of the bar for fresh air, his fists clenched so tightly that he almost tore the skin off his palms. He couldn’t do this anymore. He had behaved himself the whole day, watched Dean flirt with Max, innocent or not, they were flirting, and now this? He needed a smoke, but he didn’t have any cigarettes since he quit years ago while in college. He contemplated calling a cab for Dean, but he couldn’t let his friend down like that. He had trusted him to drive him home, so he stood at the entrance of the bar and took deep breaths to calm himself down.
“Dean? You made this impromptu visit, we weren’t scheduled for another meeting until next week. You need to talk to me,” Mildred said, looking at Dean with a worried look on her face. She was supposed to be stoic, but she had come to love Dean, for some reason. She was treading on dangerous ground, caring too much for her patient, but she saw Dean as a son to her. All she wanted was to help him, and she would never cross any professional boundaries.
Their middle sibling, Sam, stood leaning against the wall of the alley.  Lydia couldn’t see the lower half of Sam’s face behind the mask he used to hide his identity, but she could tell he had a shit-eating grin on his face.  They were siblings, they just knew stuff like that. Dean rolled his eyes, winking at his siblings,
“Yeah, yeah: ‘your telekinesis is stronger than most and you only want to use it if absolutely necessary,’ honestly, if I had an ounce of the power you do I’d never get up again.” Dean chuckled as he wrote on the sticky note and proceeded to stick it on the gang member’s forehead
Lydia snapped back to reality as her brother, Dean, was sent flying into a wall by the Demon’s telekinesis. Powers were fairly common now, most of the people Lydia knew had some kind of special ability. Lydia smirked at the Demon,
“Why you wouldn’t just work for Bobby, who knows what you do at night, is beyond me.” Bobby had raised the kids after the state had removed them from John’s care.  He was a former hero who had retired after a debilitating injury and now ran a garage, which Dean worked at.  Lydia sighed; her job as a psychiatrist didn’t have those kinds of perks: she was already dreading having to spend a day picking through people’s psyche with 3, maybe 4 hours of sleep on her side.
“Yeah, well you haven’t been fifteen minutes late since high school, so I think we’re even.” Jace looked at her with an overexaggerated look of offendedness. Lydia rolled her eyes and waved her hand towards the box of tapes on the floor near Jace’s feet. He smirked and grabbed a tape of Nirvana songs from the box, sliding out the other tape which had begun playing Witch Doctor by Cartoons. He looked at with mild disdain, before tossing it in the box as Come As You Are began.  The two settled into a comfortable silence as they drove towards the hospital, Nirvana blasting over the Corvette’s speakers.
Okay, so I’ve spent way more time then I should have developing these oc’s(by way more time I mean literal months) and these characters will probably appear in any in canon works I write as well.  I love them and I really hope anyone who reads this loves them as much as I do.  Anyways, getting right into it, let start with Lydia.
Yay, we finally have the actual first chapter! I hope you guys enjoy this, but just a reminder-I don’t really have a release schedule, this is going to get updated whenever I have the time.
Lydia glanced around as the car came to a final stop in front of her apartment.  She climbed out of the car, thanking her brother for the ride, as she began to walk towards the entrance to the apartment building. She turned around as Dean started to pull away from the curb and shouted,
“It’s a good thing you don’t then-wait what the hell does that say, Dean?” Lydia stared at her brother, who was currently trying to hide the note from her field of view.  She raised an unimpressed eyebrow and snapped her fingers, filling the alley with a loud, high pitched ringing. Dean stumbled away a few feet, holding his ears and glaring at Lydia. She sighed in faux annoyance as she stepped forward to read the note, snapping her fingers again to rid the alley of the ringing.
“Yeah, I agree with Sam; I can’t be late for work again and I think he has a case tomorrow, so he definitely can’t be late.” Lydia glanced towards her brother for confirmation and he nodded.  Sam had probably picked the hardest job of the three of them.  He worked as a defense attorney for a firm in the city that often worked the cases of those wrongly convicted.  Sam loved his job, but Lydia could see the toll that doing double duty was taking on him sometimes, not that Lydia was surprised: Sam had always been a workaholic and an overachiever.  Dean grumbled a bit but finally assented and the three ambled back to the black ‘67 Impala that Sam and Lydia jokingly called the Batmobile.
"You have to go, Dean. Now. Find the vampire. I'll remain here. They won't pursue you." Castiel collapses to the forest floor, hands and knees sinking into the damp mulch. He coughs and blood fills his mouth, spatters the leaves beneath him.
"He doesn't have a fever," he informs Bobby.
Cas is a no-show for a couple weeks after that. Dean tries to shrug it off. Fails.
“Demons, dark spirits. I ain’t saying it’s easy, but a man’s got a right to protect his property.”
— — — — —
He's unprepared, this is so unpredicted. He knows what's next and he doesn't.
"It gets harder each time," he murmurs, looking down.
“But I’d also like to be able to ask you questions, to know more about your past. This thing—us—it’s not exactly normal, as you said.” Castiel drags a fingertip along Dean’s jaw, delineating the air where its edge should be, imagining he could feel the scruff of Dean’s light five o’clock shadow. “And I don’t mind that, but I do mind you shutting me out.”
Except there’s a mark along the crest of his right shoulder. Two pink half moons. The shape of a lover’s bite.
Dean's cock twitches happily at Cas's attention, but even that feels like a stab to the spine.
Sam bursts into relieved laughter. Elbows propped on knees, he hangs his head before smiling up at Dean, eyes shining. “Hey, Dean.”
"Yeah," he answers, cracking open the door. "You too."
Dean shifts up onto his elbow and leans all the way over Cas to grab the tin of petroleum jelly from the floor where it got chucked last night. They'd gone fast and hard, desperate for proof of life and each other. It did the trick, and Dean would always take Cas however he could get him, but this morning he wants something to commit to memory.
"Stay safe," he says, voice not much more than a rasp, and pushes away.
The angel scrutinizes himself carefully, rubbing a hand over his mostly bare face. Dean left a short layer of five o'clock shadow just for old times' sake, but Cas seems to be frowning at his reflection.
There's spare razors under the sink and a half used can of Barbasol in the mirror cabinet. He'd used them earlier himself.
The sun sinks out of sight, leaving just a ribbon of light along the western edge of sky, and Castiel feels its warmth slide out of the air. He takes his final sip of beer but is reluctant to go inside while Dean seems content to stay.
“I can’t speak for him, Sam. But I do believe he loved me too.”
Dean hadn't thought that far ahead, and he has a point. But for all Dean knows Cas is still an angelic virgin.
(2011), which inspired Cas's backstory and
Cas breaks off with a growl, forehead pressed to Dean's, both of them breathing hard.
"So are you taking off, or . . . " Dean chucks a thumb at the Impala.
"I know." Dean can hear Cas's smug smile. He brushes his hand over Cas's crotch and Cas gasps. "Dean," he breathes, throaty and eager. Dean's the smug one now.
It's when Dean begins rutting against Cas's thigh that it finally hits him that what they're doing—what they've been doing—is having sex. Really one-sided sex, but still. Sex. And now? Well, blowjobs and nudity are pretty above and beyond the call of help-your-hard-up-friend duty.
“So he let you stay? All those families had to go, but not you.” Sam was obviously a shrewd prosecutor.
But her rebuttal is almost drowned out by a laugh. An honest-to-goodness belly laugh. Only without a belly—or, rather, a source. Castiel flinches as it reverberates around him.
Dean comes with Cas's wet fingers inside him and reverent fascination written all over that wide, blue-eyed stare—he's almost not sure which one set him off first. Cas keeps going, at Dean's insistence, circling, stretching until he slides clean into him, stuttering Dean's name and digging his fingers into his flesh, face screwed up like a sin. Dean smoothes the creases from Cas's forehead with his thumbs; kisses his cheekbone, his eyebrow, his bottom lip; and tells him to move.
Twisty feelings of guilt and inadequacy, those twin desires to
He rolls his hips instinctually, breathes out Cas's name. His hands seize into fists around the bedcovers and his head twists, forehead pressing into Cas's neck. He's about to beg, but Cas doesn't make him. Warm fingers crawl into place over and around Dean's cock. "Oh God," he groans, hips pushing down, back arching. "Just like that," he says when he settles back down, "Just like that, Cas, yes."
"No shit. Nightmares from the sound of it."
After the initial, joy-driven smack, Cas pours himself into the kiss, his heat and gladness melting Dean all the way down to his boots. It's far from their first kiss, but as Cas breaks off with a happy pant, Dean can't help feeling like it took him forever to get here. He takes one more kiss from Cas's warm mouth and pulls back, air puffing white between them.
Still feeling shell-shocked, Dean opens the book and scans the page for what it is Cas wanted him to find—a passage is marked with a pencil line in the margin. Psalm 34, verses 17 to 20. Sam slips out without a word as Dean reads:
"Cas!" Dean's hands are on him in seconds, turning him over, sitting him down, searching for wounds. "Cas, talk to me, buddy."
“What?” Castiel asks at the same time as Meg pipes, “Yes!” He frowns at her as she grins at Sam.
Castiel has taken so many steps. But Dean asks for a few more. He can give him those.
It’s a new war, one Castiel hasn’t yet determined how to be part of, and one Dean would prefer he didn’t try to fight. He will though, maybe soon. If Castiel has learned anything the last few years it’s that humanity isn’t equivalent to weakness—as angels often assume, and as Dean should well know. Nevertheless, it’s taken him time to adjust, and Castiel understands he’s a target for the wrath of fallen Heaven. Remaining in the bunker while Sam and Dean risk their lives for information against Metatron is strategic, for now. But strategies change, and Castiel is slowly finding new strengths.
“Hey, forgive me for breaking up the broment here, but that can’t just be it. Cas needs his house back.”
The next time Dean wakes up, he's warm. And he's not alone. Cas is curled next to him, lying on top of the covers in shirtsleeves and socks, with one arm circled over Dean's back.
Dean likes constant pressure. Overstimulation. More than anyone should be able to handle is the way Dean wants it. And he bucks and thrashes when he gets it, like now. Castiel holds two fingers at just the right spot inside him, giving it the shortest of strokes, mostly gentle pressure—nudging, holding, nudging as Dean fucks back on his fingers. His other hand is wrapped around Dean’s cock, holding firm and steady as Dean pulls and pushes, writhes and curses. “Fuck, Cas, fuck. There, fuck yes, fucking love— Cas. Shit. Oh God.
And instead of telling him why, instead of telling him he was worth every risk, Dean kisses him.
Not that he needed Dean’s death to have been symbolic or grand or for him to die a hero. It doesn’t change how he feels about him. They’d still be skating the bounds of reality and the laws of what Castiel thought he knew about physics with this strange relationship. But maybe because of how he feels for Dean and because they find themselves together in this way, the randomness and unfairness strike him deeper.
"Yes, it is."
It's not the conventional choice. Certainly not what he'd set out to find after sealing the deal on saving the world. But—Dean sees the hundred times Cas quirked smiles at him across the kitchen island, remembers the look on his face after that first taste of spaghetti sauce, his earnest expression as he'd asked Dean to explain more about cooking—it doesn't look so bad. It seems like it could be comfortable. And durable. Like it might hold up under all the shit Dean's sure to put it through.
Months then, Dean guesses, standing back—finally—to make sure he didn't miss a spot. Cas looks older and younger clean shaven. His skin looks new and baby faced, but the creases at his eyes are more evident, more ancient.
“We have work to do,” Castiel pants.
"I will heal, Dean,"  Cas tells him. "But until then I am weak."
But he's pissed at Cas, too. Because maybe Cas's motives were all well intentioned and in Dean's best interest and whatever, but Cas had still been a manipulative little bastard. He'd played his little angel games, slipping into Dean's life, making himself indispensable and desirable, and then disappearing for weeks. And Dean had eaten it all up, pining for him and missing him and slowly cutting out the bullshit because even Dean knows you don't play games when you're dealing with somebody you love and—
Dean's eyebrows shoot up and he risks sharing a quick look with Cas. "Then why isn't everybody on the museum staff trying to boink each other's brains out?"
"Keep watch," Castiel snaps as he again lays hands on Dean. Guilt and anger rip through him. He was wrong to take from Dean while he was wounded, wrong to endanger Dean with his presence in the first place. "You will not die," Castiel commands as he forces Dean's heart to beat, his lungs to expand. "You will not."
That makes Dean shift, but he continues. “They didn’t get along, him and Dad. Got so good at peacekeeping at home, figured I’d go work on it overseas and joined up with the Marines.”
“Yes.”
Meg’s stories are just getting to him. And even if she’s right, even if the house is somehow—impossibly—haunted, it’s probably the benign kind she’s explained to him. A residual energy. Maybe that’s why it affects his electricity. That’s a plausible scenario.
Dean shakes his head. "I was, but I'm not anymore. It wasn't your fault, Cas."
“Hello, Meg.”
Their tongues push together and tangle for a moment before Cas slinks out from behind Dean. Dean falls back into the pillows as Cas shifts into place above him. He kisses his way down Dean's neck, chest, stomach. He doesn't seek out the splotches of come, but he doesn't avoid them either. Dean's knees draw up, hands fly to Cas's hair. He squeezes his eyes tight against his dimming vision, trying hard to hold on this time. He's pretty sure he wants what comes next as much as the monster curse is making him want it.
Meg tilts her head, accepting that. Castiel frowns back at the house.
It's a few minutes before Dean comes around to full brain function again. Even then he waits for the kitchen ceiling to stop spinning, for their pulses to stop jumping. Eventually he pries his hand out from between their bodies. It's sticky as fuck, but he shakes Cas. "Hey. You alive in there?"
Dean scrabbles with Castiel’s shorts while Castiel concentrates on keeping the soft, blunt head of Dean’s dick nudging against the base of his wrist. When Dean’s fingers find Castiel’s own cock he trembles, breathless.
Cas smiles softly to himself and continues to stir the pot. "Thank you, Dean," he responds, but it's not an acceptance.
Dean glances up at Cas, taking in his just-open collar and crooked tie, full lips and mussed hair. He can't shut down what those things do to him, have been doing to him more and more lately, ever since Cas got back and cleaned himself up. And it's worse when Cas looks at him like this, all worried, wanting eyes. Dean's head spins. His balls tighten.
Dean can't get over Cas's sleek, clean-shavenness, soft and new. He touches his face to Cas's—temple to temple—and just holds there for a minute.
No, these are just dreams. How or when or why Cas made Dean's list of happy things to dream about (homey kitchens, favorite foods, a warrior angel of the Lord . . .), Dean isn't too sure. But it's not the weirdest thing that's ever happened to him, so he doesn't give it much thought. Until Castiel shows up in Lisa's kitchen.
“Lemme guess. You were expecting someone older.”
He steals a look out the screen door as he passes and sees Meg hovering in the shadow to one side. She raises a hand in a careful wave but knows to stay silent. This is Sam’s show now.
Dean needs Cas's voice to not sound so much like sex, and he needs his pants off pronto. The two seem to be related, but he doesn't have time to think about that.
“So even when you’re not here, you’re still . . . around?” He isn’t sure that makes sense, but Dean seems to understand.
Fingers still interlocked in his lap, Dean opens his palms. “Care to elaborate?”
Sam Winchester. Age 50s. Lebanon, KS. Other locations: Lawrence, KS; Palo Alto, CA. Family: Eileen Winchester, Colleen Winchester, Deanna Smith.
He hears Dean tell him it is safe to sleep, so he does.
"Hey. Here." Dean's arm appears through the curtain, holding a towel. Castiel takes it and dries himself, wrapping it around his hips when he's finished as he's seen the Winchesters do. He opens the curtain to step out.
“No,” Castiel answers again, only this time Sam says it with him. He looks to his left and Sam shrugs.
Lots of things happen kind of at once then. The lights blow. Sam starts shouting for Cas, or at Cas, or something—Dean can't tell because Bobby's babbling beside him, saying things like "hang on, idjit" and "stay with me, Dean." There's another fucking pain in through his abdomen, and it's hard to breathe.
"I'd prefer to stay, while I can," Cas says quietly.
"Seriously?" Dean perks up for a second, stupidly proud. "Alright, so that's—" Math is also hard. "Eighteen? Just . . . Jesus fuck—" He doubles over fast, landing squarely in Cas's lap.
"Cas—" Dean's voice sticks.
It's the last thing Dean remembers.
The crown of Dean's head tingles under Cas's single-minded scrutiny. He doesn't know why Cas is here now or why he feels like he's done something wrong when he's finally been doing every damn thing right lately—he's holding down a normal job, contributing to a family, supporting Sam's being in law school. He's living the kind of life everybody always told him he should and nobody ever thought he would. Dean doesn't know where Cas fits into that, or if Cas is supposed to, but it wasn't Dean that got all grabby hands, so if anything's fucked up here it's Cas's doing.
Scooting in behind Cas, Dean reaches around him to hover a hand over the pan. There's barely any heat coming off it. He turns up the burner a smidge and kisses the bare skin on Cas's shoulder.
"Not since I'm dying, you mean."
Almost as suddenly as he began, Dean leaves off, dipping his hands into the bath water to shake off the lather. "All right, rinse time. If I turn on the shower, think you can keep yourself on two legs long enough to rinse off?"
Bologna had seemed novel at first, but that wore off quickly. Ham proved boring—he needed a lot of mustard to make it interesting. Honey turkey was tasty when paired with a sharp cheddar. At the moment he’s low on ingredient options.
His errant hips have a similar effect on Dean, though. He gives a short groan that Castiel feels in addition to hears and Dean mimics the movement, pushing his own pelvis up and into Castiel's. Arousal meets arousal and Castiel shivers and moans, one hand quickly gripping behind him for support.
“I see.” He’d considered researching how to summon a reaper to give Dean a second try, but obviously he wouldn’t need to pursue that avenue if what Sam said was true. “Does that mean there’s nothing to be done?”
If he’d never seen photos of them side by side in their youth, Castiel wouldn’t have guessed this man to be Dean’s brother. But there are hints of Dean, even now, around his eyes and in the set of his jaw.
"And he seemed okay to you? Like, normal?" It's a dumb question—it's not like Cas is ever exactly normal. But Dean wants to be sure Cas wasn't hit with some kind of kinky witch curse or something. So far as Dean knows most devil-worshipping trash got burned up with the plans for the apocalypse, but better safe than sorry, and it's the only explanation he's come up with so far. Not to mention, witches, man,
"S'not the last," he tells Cas.
"There." He clicks off the razor and Cas opens his eyes. Dean dusts some of the stray clumps of dark hair away before standing and holding a hand out for Cas to get up and have a look in the mirror.
And then it does. It all falls away, blank and black behind his eyelids as he comes, rushing hot and firing through his bones. Cas's fingers scrape through the damp hair at the back of his head and Dean grunts a gruff curse into his shoulder.
"Jesus, Sam, and you didn't think to tell me?
's and
Or maybe he is. It's hard to tell.
in general. It's become Cas's routine as much as Dean's, kind of like hunting had. He's become part of the process, made himself essential. Dean tries not feel touched by that, but there's some kind of vice around his lungs anyway as he says, "You could stay for dinner, you know. I mean, if you wanted."
Dean laughs at that, loudly and freely. His joy is cut short by a punch of pain, though, and he ends up coughing. "Aw, fuck." He can feel it, that painful insistence. It's building strong already. "That was fast."
Cas cries out. "Yes," he confirms, breathless, "please, yes."
But when Dean stands again, he's nose to nose with Cas. Centimeters separate them, and Cas's laser angel gaze is loaded with something a hell of a lot more dangerous than anger. Dean swallows even though his throat is dry and turns away, iron-willing back the memory of last time they were this close.
even though he knows he's not sleeping because this has not happened in his dreams and—
“Dude!”
Sam's version of "fixing that," Dean finds, is baby food. Pureed peas were not what he had in mind.
— end —
"Rarely." Cas concedes.
He gestures at the door and Ava’s face floods with relief.
Dean starts to laugh into Cas's kiss. "Dude, we are so alone right now." Cas nods against Dean's mouth. Dean strokes his thumbs over Cas's hipbones. "So're you thinking what I'm thinking?" Cas growls something that can only be an affirmative and Dean kisses him more, picturing what it will be like to really get his hands on him, to strip him down and stretch him out on—
"You're ill," he says, standing in Bobby's library.
“I’m sure. If there is one, I mean. I’ll be there tomorrow.”
"Is that what I think it is?" He points to what looks like an old, metal tackle box painted black with white sigils on it.
"Do you need . . . "
He shakes his head. Assuming there's something left up there to pray to, he tells it to make sure Cas comes back with all his bones, too.
Dean grabs Cas's torso, forces him to slow down, stop. "Shhh, hey. What? There's more what?"
"If I can't
"Dean," a low voice says. A hand cups his shoulder.
Dean got to keep all the kitchen equipment he'd bought that Lisa swore up and down she was never going to use. She also gave him a set of pots and pans and one of those overhead pot rack things for Christmas. He enlists Cas's help in hanging the rack in the space above the sink and subsequently has to focus on not falling off the kitchen chair he's standing on every time he looks down to take one of the parts from Cas and sees the angel staring up at him, his mouth open in concentration and, coincidently, at the same level as Dean's crotch.
He comes till Cas kisses him and tells him it's done.
The Godfather
Dean wavers where he stands. He tries to concentrate on not falling forward and accidentally catching himself with his lips on Cas's mouth, but that only makes it more of a possibility. Cas is all wide eyes and parted lips and
“Scythes,” Castiel corrects.
"Come on, c'mere," he beckons, tugging Cas fully on top of him. Cas grinds down, mimicking Dean's move earlier, and Jesus, yeah, that's more like it. Dean can't resist going with it, kissing and tasting Cas everywhere he can, their hips exchanging thrusts. Eventually, though, he forces his way up again, tilting their bodies just enough to get his hand around both of them and fuck yes.
"Sam, it may be quite some more time," Cas says patiently, reasonably, like he isn't watching Dean hump a pillow in the middle of a sex-curse meltdown.
Cas tilts his head up and whatever's going through his head, it's nothing to do with what Dean just asked. He's a million miles away, and there are more emotions wavering across his face than Dean can name—worry, relief, supplication, sorrow, joy, disbelief.
So, at this point, what's one more?
A couple seconds of rustling through the bags and he pulls out his final purchase—OUIJA. He settles cross-legged on the living room floor and pierces the plastic wrapping with a thumb, discarding it behind him. Meg had described the general principles to him, but he gives the instructions a cursory once-over, then lays open the board in front of him.
might be reaching, but he likes this little life he’s building and has been on an even keel. But now it’s 3:00 AM and he’s not certain he’s slept at all since forcing himself to bed around midnight.
were my present." Present and olive branch—Sam's way of saying
sick."
Cas pleads again, his hands clasping and unclasping at a loss for what to do. "Dean, I—"
And then he remembers every tool that ever turned up somewhere he was sure he hadn’t left it, every just-out-of-reach screwdriver, every inches-from-where-he’d-thought-it’d-been coffee cup, every missing piece of hardware or book, every mysteriously open door.
He hops to the side and moves to sit down, with the plan of taking off his other sock and using it to wipe the red off his foot. Instead, the hand he extends while levering himself down also lands in the paint pan.
Seeing as it's been a whole month and Dean still has no clue how the fuck to play this—because he
Cas is frowning at Dean as though he thoroughly disapproves of the second head Dean's grown.
Hell, for all Dean knows it
Sam’s lips roll in and he presses his mouth in a light line. He nods hard again. “Because of me. Because I left.”
Castiel closes the folder and tosses it aside. Technically he can complete the paperwork tomorrow, on company time. After all, he’s promised himself boundaries this time. Work-life balance.
, Castiel thinks, hands splayed over Dean, parting him. He shuffles back on the bed and leans down, mouth meeting skin just where he’d meant to. He presses the fat flat of his tongue into the furrow of Dean’s body and Dean destroys a moan.
Castiel frowns at the space where Dean disappeared. Clearly that last question had been the wrong one for the moment, but he tells himself not to feel bad for asking. Dean’s hurt over Sam and whatever happened between them is what makes him resistant to talking, even if his emotions manifest in other ways.
He shakes his head, lips into a thin line. Dean rolls his eyes. "Look, I'll do whatever you or Heaven or whoever needs me to do, okay? I get that I'm the universe's bitch. Not saying I like it, but I get it. Bad shit happens, and better to me than somebody else. So, just, lay it on me."
One item that never goes missing is the toy army man from the china hutch.
He hasn't seen Cas in weeks and he's not exactly excited to see him now. This angelic intervention isn't helping any.
Dean doesn't wake up a lot after that. He sleeps through a couple days, then a couple more. When he does come to, every now and then, there's usually somebody keeping watch.  And it's usually Cas. He wonders what that means for the war.
Dean rolls out from under him and finally shucks his briefs. He scoots on his knees between Cas's thighs and Cas leans up to beg a kiss with his mouth. Dean gets himself slick—the first time he's touched himself all morning, but it only takes a few pulls to makes sure he's hard enough. Below him, Cas lays back and cants his hips, ready and waiting like the well-trained sailor he is. He smiles crookedly at Dean as though he caught the thought, but it disappears as Dean slides two fingers into him, teasing, testing.
It isn’t exactly necessary to keep it charged, or even on. He’s long since deleted work-related applications and avoids his email account. Why torture himself with stock tickers when he’s no longer required to check in on what the market’s doing? What use does he have for email, or phone service, when there’s no one from his old life willing to break Angelus ranks and contact him? But it’s the principle of the thing. He should be able to charge his cell phone in his house. He should be able to rely on his electrical outlets.
"Yup." Dean crosses one boot over the other. "It's my place of residence." He watches Cas's spine straighten.
“He— They— It what?”
Sam spreads his hands in a gesture identical to Dean’s. “I don’t know. I didn’t know he stayed. I thought after I left . . . I thought for sure he’d let go, somehow. That I was the reason he was sticking around and without me he’d give up. But damn, he sure is stubborn, isn’t he?” Sam’s eyes well with tears again, and Castiel feels his own prickle in sympathy. They share another watery smile.
Once there, he’s greeted by another helpful sign. This one is taped to a faux stone pillar at the end of a shelf row and reads CARD CATALOGUE with an arrow pointing down to a computer station below. Castiel frowns at it.
The pain didn't kill his boner. It's just as hard as it was before, and it
"It's hardly a chore, Dean," Cas adds, his voice a nice, soft, sexy kind of low.
Cas gets caught in cataloguing Dean. He touches and kisses him everywhere—arms, elbows, abs, thighs—fingers stroking and palms smoothing by turns. It's all to the good, but Dean's dick aches for attention.
"It wasn't worth the risk."
“It’s fine,” Castiel replies, lips just brushing the crest of an ear. Dean smells of smoke and myrrh, the increasingly familiar scent of earthbound angels—his trip with Sam was successful, then. Castiel doesn’t ask how it went, what they learned.
A week, a heap of used sandpaper, and a can of primer later, the dining room already looks fresher, brighter, friendlier—even with the china hutch looming at the center of the room covered in a drop cloth. He spends a morning applying the first coat of paint to the room, but when his stomach growls in protest that he neglected to ingest anything other than coffee for breakfast, he concedes to a break.
“Yeah.”
"Anyway, I like it here. Sam's, what, two hours away," he lists, fishing the vanilla out of cupboard, "off in law school la-la land at Notre freaking Dame. Lisa doesn't mind that I'm here." Dean digs out the shortening. "Ben's a cool kid." He shoves his head into the fridge. "Plus, I have a job, and—oh, crap, looky there." He swings the fridge door shut and does a bad job of sounding disappointed. "We're out of eggs."
The pain pushes through him, bright and stabby. Dean rolls sideways on the bed, cupping his balls. "This is not okay!" he yells. All he can think about is how awesome that last release felt, how thrilling the pressure of his own touch is. He can feel his dick twitch in his palm. He's about two seconds away from ripping into his fly again.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. Cas doesn't know you're not supposed to say shit like that, but Dean could still come from hearing it, just from the sound of his voice. He has to start breathing through his mouth.
Cas steps away with a shake of his head and, managing the most solemn smirk Dean's ever seen, says calmly, "There are some things a man must do for himself, Dean," before disapparating.
here.”
He hardly looks human anymore. They've seen all kinds of fucked up things this year, maybe Dean's some special new brand of monster. Any hunter worth his salt would take one look at him, shoot first and ask questions later. He's walking dead, shrunken and rotting in his own scarred skin.
Dean gives a surprised, uncertain little moan, muscles tightening.
—lit up at point-blank range, showered with gunfire, and crippled by a couple torpedoes to the gut—that could happen on any given convoy or cruise.
Dean hangs up as he climbs out of the car and slams the door. Pissed off doesn't even begin to describe this one. And, all right, sure, so he's mostly pissed at himself. For not figuring it out sooner, for fucking up the thing he wanted before he even knew he wanted it, which has got to be a special talent.
inside him. But he can't not.
“To me, to Dad. Hell, to Bobby. And you come back now to ‘help’? It’s a little late for that, Sammy, don’t you think? We’re all dead!”
The silence here is different too. It’s not completely silent, of course. The chirping chorus of birds outside is loud enough to wake him before dawn, and if he listens close enough he can hear the wind whisper through the field grass. The house itself creaks like an old man’s knees, and even though the man from the heating service bled the radiators the pipes shake and bang as steam pours into them. Occasionally Castiel hears doors open or close downstairs while he’s upstairs, though he hasn’t yet identified the culprit drafts.
Cas's hands flutter up to his shoulders, seeking anchor, but Dean weaves their fingers together and pins them down. He sets his knees and fucks him faster now, feeling the strain burn in his thighs, the aftershocks of Cas's orgasm pulse around him. Dean sucks kisses from Cas's mouth, their skin slippery, his dogs tags pooling on Cas's chest, Cas's hair in hopeless, sweaty spikes. Dean wants to erase everything around them—the barracks, the island, the war, the world—to make this moment stay and the rest disappear.
He has a routine, a reason to get out of a bed. It’s an improvement. There’ve even been days he hasn’t thought of Angelus at all, and he’d pushed away the guilt that came with that realization by hammering down the floorboards harder.
," Dean protests.
“Yeah.”
There's this terrifying split second where Dean gets no response whatsoever, but then a grin cracks wide and delirious across Cas's face and Dean probably couldn't have stopped the accompanying kiss even if he'd wanted to.
Other than the expanse of visible sky, what strikes Castiel most is the amount of space below it. Orderly angle parking and broad intersections with wide shoulders stretch the cityscape. There’s room for parking lots and grass curb strips and crosswalks with brick inlay. It’s not as though he’s never visited a small city before, but it’s different thinking about how this may be his city now.
They unpack the boxes in the kitchen and put stuff away as they eat. (Well, Dean eats. Cas has a few token bites of burger but it turns out he's not interested in food that wasn't cooked by Dean, so Dean finishes his, too.) Dean's not used to unpacking with the intention of staying. As the cupboards and drawers fill up, he has to stomp down the feeling that he's spreading himself too thin, making it too hard to clear out in a hurry. But then he looks at Cas carefully putting away dishes or asking him where he wants to keep the colander and reminds himself that that's the point: he's not going anywhere.
Stripped of sight, Castiel feels his way along the outline of Dean’s bare body. Rather than straddling him again, he climbs between Dean’s parted knees, smoothing his hands up the backs of Dean’s thighs, over his ass. He brushes a thumb at the very base of Dean’s spine, where the cleft of his body begins—a statement of intent, a question without words.
"Both," Dean snaps, and cringes as the first perk of arousal hits him. "I can't," he gestures at his crotch, "You know, make it stop."
“Fine,” he growls and gets to his feet. He checks the stem nut’s hold once more and keeps his wrench in hand as he heads into the hall. “Coming!” he barks from the top of the stairs, hoping to prevent the workmen from knocking down his front door—he doesn’t need another thing to repair. Halfway down, he hears a door open and stops mid-step.
Half an hour later, Castiel has maintained his floor plan and the radio is back where it belongs. As an afterthought, he fishes behind the console for the cord and plugs it back into the wall. When the radio flips itself on and the classic rock station kicks up the second he steps back, Castiel rolls his eyes. He won’t give Dean the satisfaction of acknowledging it out loud, but he agrees it would’ve been a shame to leave the thing unplugged and never use it.
There’s a rustle that must be Dean shaking his head. “Just come for me, baby. Come on me.”
Something's different this time. And not just because Cas is the one who's initiated it, or because he's teasing, taking his time. Something's changed. Something's more serious now. It's in the air between them, in way they touch each other. Dean can hear it the way he calls out Cas's name. This morning he said it just because of the sensory overload, or as a warning of impending orgasm. But now each time he says Cas's name it's a little needier, a little dirtier.
"There's one thing we ain't considered," Bobby says, voice low, and Dean can picture him speaking to that glass of bourbon clutched to his chest, not meeting anybody's eyes. "Might not be anything oogly boogly at all. Might just be a regular ol' human thing. Could be he's just plain sick with something."
Miraculously, Cas pulls off. He has that interrupted-and-angry look, complete with well-used red lips, but Dean tugs at him more and tries to, like,
Since then he’s bounced around the house, unofficial overseer of Castiel’s restorations. Sometimes he’s swept into a pocket, but most of the time he’s stationed on a shelf or countertop or stack of books. It’s not really a conscious thing. Castiel scoops him up, juggles him in his palm as he thinks about his next move, tosses and catches him idly, like someone more athletic might toss a tennis or baseball. It helps him think, and if he also occasionally gets lost for a time wondering about where the little green army man came from and who left him behind. (A child? a grieving parent?) Well, Castiel works on his own time now. There’s no one to scold him for daydreaming.
And he does. A week later.
Dinner's not made. The tub of chicken is upended and all the meat Dean shredded is scattered in a greasy mess on the floor.
Eileen gives a knowing “ah” then turns to her guests. “Hi guys. Want tea?”
, Dean" Sam says and ducks into the car.
It’s an obituary for one Patrick Leahy from 2007. Castiel scrunches his eyebrows, trying to understand how this is relevant and Meg points him to sentence toward the end. He reads it aloud to himself. “Survived by his daughter Eileen [Sam] Winchester of Lebanon, Kansas.”
“Oh, Cas. Please, Cas. Cas—” Dean chants, verging on frantic.
Panic shakes through Dean, because, just, "No." He knows what Cas is going to say, but it's not true. He's fine. He'll be fine. And he's certainly not fucking
“Goodbye, sweetheart,” Castiel smirked and winked at Dean as he got out of the car.
“Babe! We did it!” He gushed and then moved to hug Kelly and then Billie. Billie was awkward at first but she gave in. “I’m sorry,” Dean apologized to Billie who just shook her head with a small smile.
“You think?” Dean snarked.
“Adam, where are your manners?” Michael asked, slapping his hand.
“I’m sorry, babe, but that was a goodbye kiss. We can’t do this anymore,” he sniffled and moved away from Castiel to sit on the farthest corner of the sofa away from him. Castiel was baffled and his mouth hung open. He was hurt, he cared about Mick and liked what they had going.
The truth was that as far as the world knew, Chuck was communing with monks in Tibet trying to find himself. However, Castiel had told Dean the sad truth; his father had run away from home because he was ashamed of his brother Nick and nobody knew where he was.
"No. But try to understand."
“Yeah,” is all Castiel managed to say.
“Congratulations, Dean, Cas,” Sarah said softly and smiled at the couple.
He kissed Dean’s neck, which seemed to be his weak spot. Castiel smiled and tucked away that information for later. He nibbled on his ear while he lazily fisted Dean’s cock that was steadily dripping precome. Dean was a writhing mess and was groaning incoherently by the time Castiel started licking his nipples. He removed his mouth from Dean’s body and sat back down on his heels and watched Dean sprawled before his like a god; legs splayed open, body flushed, his pink pouty mouth slightly open, his eyes dark with a storm of passion raging behind them,
He called Dean but there was no response and Gordon wasn’t answering either. Dean had said they were having fun so he texted him instead.
“What the
“I don’t want the police finding out about this.”
“It was all me.
“Yes, to know what to do when you are married and things like that,” she explained while sipping her tea. Castiel gawked at her while Dean put a whole macaron in his mouth and chewed.
Starting at his shoulders, Castiel massaged Dean’s neck and collar bones then moved down and gently massaged his well-toned, freckled back. He then moved to his lower back. He sat gently on Dean's thighs and applied a bit of pressure on Dean’s lower back which he massaged thoroughly, eliciting a few groans at first, and then finally moans. He got off Dean’s thighs and knelt back on the bed massaging Dean’s hips, thighs, legs and feet, intentionally avoiding his ass. Once he was done, he moved up Dean’s legs and kissed his inside of his knees causing Dean to wiggle his ass.
“I told you, you are beautiful, I hope these photos remind you of that every day,” Castiel said softly and looked at Dean. He was met with wet hazel eyes.
It also didn’t help that he and Castiel had grown close as friends again. They texted each other almost every night, asking each other how the other's day was and what the other ate. Sometimes they talked about the books they were reading since that was something they had in common.
The sun peeked through the trees and birds chirped merrily as they passed small towns that were scattered throughout the area, with paved roads crisscrossing the region to allow easy access to many trailheads. There were also abandoned burons, which were essentially small huts with thatched roofs that the tour guide said were traditionally used by shepherds.
“Jesus, Cas. You didn’t even let me finish what I was saying last night," Dean said sitting up on the bed and rubbing his eyes.
“Okay buddy,” Dean said, giving Lee a side-hug before he left the room, and Dean was left pondering about their conversation as he got ready for the day ahead.
"I'm sorry if you feel that I crossed a line. I just don't understand how you would tell Gordon about Cas and not me."
Castiel wanted to protest, but all those things Dean had said made sense so he pondered to find another solution but nothing came to mind.
“I love you too, Dean,” Castiel replied knowing that Dean was not going to talk about it, but he was glad he had given him a great experience that he hoped one day would erase all the pain and shame he had suffered over the years.
“Hey, hey, hey. Dean, look at me. You deserve everything good in this world. Everything. If it is me you need, I am here. Whatever you need, I will get it for you. Anything.”
“Cas,” Dean whispered and when he turned to look at Cas, he had tears in his ears. He detangled himself from Cas’ embrace and kissed him with so much emotion that Cas felt it seeping into his essence. “I love you, Cas. More than you will ever know.”
. She still wants to be the first one to do an interview with us. Also, my followers keep asking who you are,” Castiel said, sipping his herbal tea. Dean brought him a plate of cookies and sat next to him sipping his coffee.
“A bully? What the hell?” Nick felt insulted, but it was funny how he didn’t realize he was being rude.
“Can I ask you something?” Mick asked, adjusting himself to sit comfortably on the sofa to face Dean.
Dean did not have an argumentative bone in his body at this point, he was simply wound up from the tense muscles. He figured it was better to just give in and enjoy this.
“And you’re still not funny,” Dean took the toy from where it had fallen on the bed and threw it back at Castiel. Castiel caught it and looked at it like it was the most interesting thing in the world. He did not say anything back but Dean came and kissed him on the cheek. “I love you so much.”
“What I have always wanted,” Lee said plainly. “You.”
“Cas, are you okay? Dean asked. He was feeding a very hungry Jack his bottle.
Castiel shook his head. He now understood that Dean had been messing with him the entire time.
As the night wore on, Dean and Castiel didn’t talk to each other again, but there was no outright hostility, just a cold war brewing underneath the surface. Balthazar was called to sort some managerial things out, and he came back later saying that he had to go back to work. He told them that their meal and drinks were on him. Gordon tried to protest, but Balthazar was not having it.
“So, the wedding. Do you have a location? Food? Drinks? Suits? Invitations?” She asked, looking between Dean and Castiel.
“How did he take it?” Gordon asked, squinting his eyes since the light from the late afternoon sun was a bit much.
?” Castiel countered and Dean seemed taken aback. He fumbled for words but it seemed none were forthcoming so he just gawked at Castiel. Castiel stared back.
“What?” Cas asked as he felt Dean watching him.
myself for money?” Dean said feigning a laugh but Cas could hear the pain behind it.
Feedback is appreciated.
“We couldn’t leave each other even if we tried.
“So, I want you to meet my family,” Castiel said plainly, lazily caressing Dean’s arm as they were cuddling on the couch. They had somehow managed to detangle from each other and clean up. They were now watching a lifetime movie that they weren’t paying too much attention to. "You’ve already met Zar of course, but everyone else keeps asking after you,” Castiel continued.
He wanted to grab that beer bottle from his hands, break it and jam one of the pieces in Lee’s neck, and watch the life leave his eyes. Instead, he looked down, took a few calming breaths and stayed put.
“I hate to admit it but it feels kind of good to hang out with someone other than my husband or my friends,” Dean said, sipping his bubbly and moaning as the lady massaging his feet touched a pressure point.
“Happy?” Lee laughed sarcastically. “Is that why he was cheating on him with his lawyer friend?”
"Say something, Dean."
“Let’s go meet your new partner, slacker,” Rufus patted him on the back and walked ahead of him to the IT department which was two floors down. They took the stairs because Rufus believed that an engineer should always be fit. Also because Rufus didn’t trust elevators. For an engineer, he was awfully skeptical of an engineering marvel, and his defence, when asked why he didn't trust them, was to say that he just preferred the stairs. The truth was, he was claustrophobic.
“Maybe later,” Donna winked at Balthazar and everyone laughed again. This was a fun night.
“I...uh...it’s the Empty. It’s coming for me, Dean.”Cas said, trying hard but failing to swallow the lump in his throat and to trying even harder to push the bile rising in his gut. His mouth felt dry like he had eaten sawdust. “It’s coming for me, I don’t know when or where but it’s coming and I am afraid.”
? You living in eternal damnation? You think I’d want that for you?”
“It’s just a feeling I got and then when I saw you lying there all I wanted is for you to want me. But I also wanted to be in control. To watch you come apart beneath me.”
Castiel had not said anything to that. He felt the same way but confirming his fears to Dean would have only made things worse.
“You are making my point for me. What are you waiting for? Just rip off the band-aid, Dean. Just do it.”
“I don’t want to jinx it,” Castiel looked up at Dean. Dean saw the worry in his eyes and he couldn't stand to see Castiel looking grim after such joyous news.
Dean had this weird look on his face like he was disgusted with himself. Cas reassured him by holding his hand again but Dean retrieved his own shortly after. Cas left his hand outstretched on the table as if saying to Dean,
They sat awkwardly in the back seat trying not to sit too close to each other. Castiel removed his suit jacket and folded it on his lap.
“He would never say no to you. Just tell him to be there,” Balthazar winked at him as he got up from the floor and checked his phone. “Shit! I was supposed to call this beautiful woman I’m seeing like five hours ago, and now she’s blowing up my phone. Can I go do that?”
Lee looked at him and then said, “I need like 200k.”
The ghost—
, and Castiel leans over him again, sucking at his throat and eliciting more shocked, eager sounds as he aligns his cock along the wet cleft of Dean’s ass.
He spreads his palms on the cool plaster of the wall, rolls his cheek against it too. He's on his knees and Cas is under him, in front of him, his mouth—his mouth is really good. Too good, too too good. Awesome, even. Dean's thighs shake. He tries to think about something else. He doesn't want to come already, or does he? He tries to think.
Sam gives that a considering “huh,” and slides his gaze to Meg. “What about you? Did you get to know him too?”
Cas slips off his barstool. "I think this," he motions to the bare chicken bones and assorted sandwich stuff "—cooking—makes you feel useful. Needed. But also in control," he flashes Dean one of those small, almost-ironic smiles, "which you like." Dean feels his pulse pick up as Cas makes his way around the counter. "It's another way for you to do what it is you always do, Dean: provide and protect."
"I don't care what Cas says," Dean cuts him off. "He's not part of this."
Instead he thinks about how he should be saving his money, not dumping it into empty equity. He’s known that all along, of course, but the consequences are real now. His investment in his house traps him here. There will be no flipping the property. There will be no selling, period.
Sam’s brow crunches again. “Oh. So, are you the new owners then?”
Anyway, there's always Cas and a kitchen and some kind of food and kissing. Despite the fact that it's his own subconscious at work, Dean blames all this solely on Cas.
“I know it doesn’t sound particularly sane, but we lived—or, well—existed together. It was easy to be close.”
"No, not you."
Reminding himself he has to get back to cleaning before he loses all momentum—and daylight—Castiel closes the drawer, leaving the little collection where he found it, where the original owners presumably wanted it. But on impulse he pops open the display glass door and sets the toy soldier on a shelf, positioning him just so before gently shutting it again. He couldn’t say why.
"Dean, don't hang up. Dean—"
Castiel lowers the grocery bags as carefully as he can with shaky arms and steps over them into the room. The furniture is scattered out of its arrangement. The couch has been shoved aside, rucking up the area rug along the way, and the TV stand looks as though it’s been yanked straight away from the wall, its plug still trailing. The radio console is all the way back across the room, exactly where it had started.
And that's how they are when Dean comes—Cas leaning in close, Dean's fist wrapped in Cas's tie, his legs bent up and around Cas's thighs. It rushes over him tidal-wave hard, and Cas's fingers feed the warm slick from tip to shaft as Dean's brain tumbles.
Castiel looks up and cocks his head, realizing something very important for the first time. “You spoke with your brother? After, I mean. As a ghost?”
He expresses exactly none of these thoughts out loud.
He also doesn’t go to work. It’s poor form to take a week off this early in his tenure, but when he explains that his house is in need of fumigation, Anna is more than willing to give him space and time. It’s dishonest, of course, and Castiel doesn’t like the lie. He also doesn’t like that, if you carry through the metaphor, Dean is characterized as a pest. But the threat of bed bugs or termites or roaches—Castiel doesn’t specify—is enough to make his officemates relieved by his absence rather than suspicious.
“Ouch,” the ghost—
He hears Sam shuffle in excitement. "So get this, the horn is black rhino, from Ke—"
“Nuh-uh,” Dean admonishes. He tugs at Castiel’s knees, half his usual strength at best, until Cas is seated up around his lap. “Do it here,” he says, fumbling Cas’s hand into position around his own hard cock. “Wanna see you.”
Dean snorts. “Dude, sometimes I think you’re the one who’s a hundred years old.”
Cas sighs, plucks the measuring spoons from the counter and metes out a teaspoon of vanilla. "You never talk about you, Dean. The only way to know anything is to ask."
There's a stir of the air and suddenly Cas is there.
Cas does look, but not for long. He turns his face away, lip bit and breath held. Sorrow and reluctance and something unreadable quiver on his face. It takes him two tries before he speaks. "Dean, I—" he stops again, huffs. "I see your pain, Dean. But I also see you as I always have."
Sam's jaw drops. "What . . . Are you serious? He's our best bet to—"
“Huh. What dicks.”
In an instant, Cas grabs Dean's hips and pulls him tight to the cleft of his ass, grinding back against him. He even bends forward, parting his cheeks enough to cradle Dean's dick. Dean loses his breath. Dirty fucking angel.
Cas looks confused—less I-don't-understand-that-reference confused and more why-is-that-a-question confused. "I— Yes," he snaps to. "Of course."
At first he'd liked how easy the job was, he explains. Compared to shouldering the responsibility for locking away Lucifer, it was a frickin' dream, and not getting chased around by monsters that wanted to eat him was a definite perk. "But now, I don't know. Sometimes I'd rather be making a couple hundred salt rounds," he chuckles. He grabs a paring knife and keeps going with both the chicken and his thoughts.
"Hold on," Cas says quietly.
"I don't know what you don't understand about 'not leaving you,'" Dean mutters, hands continuing their futile search.
The warm, waning light of the day blazes across the fields around the house and Castiel soaks it in, eyes closed. It’s not actually silent out here the way he’d expected it to be. The fields surrounding the house have been coming alive as spring has deepened toward summer and the chirp of crickets and the sleepy evening titter of birds fill the air. It’s a welcome contrast to the relentless drone of the sander. And he can hardly remember when his life featured only a soundtrack of sterile HVAC hum and city traffic.
"I have to tell you all the things I've done. Your opinion of me may change once you know . . ." He shakes his head, changing tack and picking up speed and turning on the imploring, "I've tried to undo them, Dean, but there's danger for us now, all of us. Unknown things await if Crowley succeeds in opening the door to Purgatory and—"
Meg ignores his annoyance. “Wow. This is actually exciting.”
“Or was just that stubborn,” Castiel offers.
Benny smirks at the two of them a little too knowingly. "You and that friendship thing man."
“There’s a clawfoot tub up there!” Ava pipes up, bending to the side in an attempt to follow Castiel with her voice. “Cast iron!” Castiel nods and backs off the stairs.
There’s a creak and a thump just before Castiel reaches the kitchen but when he whips through the door—heart pounding in his throat and wrench up ready to swing—there’s nothing. Nothing but the kitchen door swung open, doorknob bumping against the wall in the breeze.
Dean’s answering grin cracks like the dawn but his “Hey, Cas,” is soft. Tender, even. Enough to make Castiel blush.
— — — — —
The knocking becomes a banging. Castiel didn’t even know the house could echo, but it does now.
It's not what Cas would call wise for Dean to be here, to
“He loves you too, Sam. He’s proud of you and protective of your memory.”
"You too," Dean adds as Benny adjusts his cap and turns away, whistling as he retreats through the trees. Dean sighs and looks down at Cas's sagging neck and shoulders. "We made it, Cas. Just you and me now. Home sweet home." He thinks about that for second, earth being at least a plane of existence away from Heaven. "Well, you know. Close enough, I guess."
. But, shit. This is more.
This. Everything. This. Dean. Here. Now. Castiel is full, brimming. His heart, his mind, his body filled with Dean. And still it builds.
Dean tastes bitter and earthy. It mingles with the coarse musky scent of arousal, and Cas revels in it. Skating a hand up Dean’s back, he sucks a kiss into Dean, lips tight with a graze of tongue, then pulls away to take a playful bite of one butt cheek.
“Good.” Castiel cringes at his own lameness.
"I don't heal, Cas. I don't eat, don't crap. I can barely
"Uh, yeah, all right, so Cas was here. The other day. He—"
Dean doesn't have to ask what. "I want you, Cas," he repeats, turning his hand and spreading his fingers. "You're mine and I want you." He forms a cup with his hand and strokes as Cas begins to rock into his touch.
Dean tries hard to bring his brain back from flat line over the way Cas said
It should be more unsettling, the disappearing. Dean was visible, and then he wasn’t. No slow fade, no mystical dissolve. But although it was abrupt, it wasn’t scary. Castiel wouldn’t characterize anything about Dean as scary. In fact, compared to what he’s been told about paranormal encounters that seemed . . . remarkably normal.
Stuff from table clatters to the floor as Cas pushes Dean onto it. From flat on his back, Dean leans up to grin at him. "You are a kinky bastard, aren't you?" he teases as Cas drags down his boxers and jeans, but Cas doesn't answer and that's the last coherent thought Dean manages for a while.
there?"
The split lip is a bigger problem. Hard to impersonate an FBI agent looking like you were on the losing end of bar brawl. (For the record, it was a lucky hit from a flailing teenage vampire.) There are more bruises too, on this thigh, his shins, his ribs. They get purple dark, but don't make the turn to fade to reddish yellow. They're not big, but they don't go away.
"The curse, it's like, I don't know, confusing the good with the bad. Everything that feels good feels
They share a brief smile before bouncing their attention away from each other.
"Cas!" Dean pounds up the stairs, two at a time, as Cas shouts his name again. Not shouts. Screams. He skids into the bedroom and hits the light to find Cas cringing and twisting, his eyes still screwed shut. "I'm here, Cas," he says, going straight to the bed. "Cas! Wake up. I'm here. You're okay."
“Told ya.”
Cas peels up and blinks at him, hair destroyed, eyes blurry. Dean smiles. He could get used to waking up to that.
Things are getting messy inside Dean as the yes-good-want-reward feeling vies with the punishing fuck-or-die pain, but in there somewhere are his actual emotions. They're in that damn locker. His voice cracks. "Yeah, okay? Yeah, 'course I do."
“Yeah, alright. I’m coming with you.”
He'd think it was some sick angel plot, except no one else was ever involved. Cas never dragged Heaven into it, never talked about some greater good. He'd never asked for more, only asked about what Dean wanted and gladly accepted what little Dean gave him. And then Dean went and daydreamed about a happily ever after with Cas held at arm's length.

Castiel rolls his eyes before carefully aiming hammer and nail, wishing for the umpteenth time he’d bothered to rent a nail gun. He makes contact with the nail head on the first strike and pounds until the molding is held fast. “It seems to me the repairs to
His hands find Dean's hips and pull him tight. His mouth opens to admit Dean's tongue and oh—
Once they're in the bedroom, he picks up where they left off, tugging Cas close and kissing him. Dean traces the tip of his tongue along the cusp of Cas's bottom lip, where it meets his skin. It's this perfect ridge, smooth and precariously thin. His hands, meanwhile, travel in two different directions. One goes up so Dean can push his fingers into the hair at the base of Cas's neck, making him gasp, and the other heads down, finding a bare hipbone to tease with his thumb.
is not responsible for this.
“Has it occurred to you that you could help me?”
“Don’t make it weird or anything, Cas.”
Dean realizes he can see more of Cas now, the bedroom dark has faded into gray, predawn half light. He smiles back, remembering where they started—bloodied and beat. It was hours ago, but that feels like another life too.
Cas dips and drags that one slick, smart finger in and around the rim of Dean's body, knowing exactly what to do to tease. Dean twitches and squirms at every touch. It's jagged bolts of pain, flashes of
and saves the crushed in spirit.
Black fangs and a whiplike tongue that drip gray bile. Yellow fangs covered in red. Fangs on monsters that can't kill him but can kill Dean. That frightens him more.
Dean is so close to coming. Cas is laid out below him, panting and gripping and rasping out
Dean rolls to a stop at a red light in an intersection that's never this crowded this early. "Right, yeah. That's about what I was thinking."
Cas is frowning at the circle of lumpy batter currently not cooking in the pan. He looks as though he's considering whether a good smiting might make it golden brown. "I used the money I found in your wallet."
Every movement, every incremental adjustment of their bodies brings Castiel closer to a feeling he doesn't understand, but he knows this is what he wanted. This is what he sought from the first moment Dean kissed him. To experience this intimacy, to occupy a moment and feeling together. It's exquisite.
"I don't think it was just you," Dean offers. Because he's gone over it again and again and that psalm seems to be about him more than it is about Cas. "I'm the righteous one, right? I think maybe my 'cry for help' was just wishing that you'd, I don't know, be around more. Sam died, or I thought he did, and you never came, you know? And then you were back, but you had the war and I was just pissed you weren't, I don't know . . . it sounds stupid, but . . . mine? anymore?" Dean scratches at his eyebrow and tries not to feel embarrassed by his honesty. "I think it was a tradeoff. You needed a reason to stay because I wanted you to stay."
"Cas—" Dean begins to counter, but Cas shakes his head minutely, silencing him.
He's tired, he aches, and this isn't fun anymore—if it ever was—but he still feels it. The scorching want is still there, maybe even hotter now. He doesn't want it there anymore.
They do. And Dean is lost.
“He thinks it’s his fault. It wasn’t. Courts charged the trucker with vehicular manslaughter, but Sammy . . .” Dean shakes his head. “He never stopped blaming himself.”
“Bacon,” says no one visible, which must mean it’s Dean. Castiel swallows his heart beat.
Dean's got a little brother who'll be old enough to fight in a year. He'd be out here already if Dean hadn't begged him not to lie about his age on his enlistment papers and finish high school first. He doesn't want to think about Sammy manning a machine gun, or seeing half the shit he's seen. Dean looks over at Cas, wishing for the thousandth time he was still CO in Dean's boat. He's already got too much to lose on these front lines.
For the first time in the two weeks he’s been in his new home, Castiel feels like listening to music.
It isn't long until he comes, still wrapped around Cas. He blacks out almost immediately, of course.
"Dean," he pants. "Dean, please. Oh—"
"Photophobia," Cas grumbles and the others nod.
"Hello, Dean."
Dean skates his palm up, over, and down the bend of Cas's hip, watching as the sheet pulls down, showing him more skin. With the air warm as breath, Cas doesn't even notice. It was worth it for this, Dean thinks, this one chance for a sleepy, slow morning fuck. The kind they never get to have.
“Never mind,” Castiel smiled as he walked past Dean to join everyone else leaving a blushing and mostly confused Dean standing with an empty beer bottle in his hand.
"Join me in my cave? We can watch a movie. Any movie you want."
“Maybe.”
“I mean he’s respectful and all, but I think he wanted to hold a grudge so here we are,” Castiel said as he got up and went to stand by the window looking out into the ocean.
"So you made him an accomplice?"
“Finally!” Lee exclaimed from where he was seated on the floor next to Dean’s bed. “He’s awake guys.”
“Yeah…Well...I...uhh...I’ll leave you to it then. It was nice seeing you again, Dean,” Castiel said genuinely. He was happy to see him.
After they had finished eating, Castiel was sitting on the sofa with Dean seated on the floor scrolling through the channels, his body between Castiel’s legs.
Dean groaned and Charlie nudged him.
“That’s great because I kind of told them we’d be joining them at our family ranch in California on New Year’s Eve,” Castiel confessed, kissing Dean’s cheek.
“Wow! That’s quite impressive!" Castiel exclaimed.
The rest of the dinner went perfectly until Chuck said he wanted to show Bobby around and talk about hunting and scotch. Naomi offered to give Sam and Dean a tour of the home. Castiel was left alone so he decided to go to his room and pick up his old poetry journals.
“You mean me eating you out?” Castiel laughed. Dean nodded, closing his eyes as if to hide his embarrassment. His face and chest were still flushed from their activities, but Castiel could tell he was blushing.
. That was amazing babe,” Mick purred as he got off from where he had been riding Castiel and settled beside him on the bed. Castiel sat up, as he removed the condom from his spent cock, tied it, and threw it in the trash can beside the bed.
“Good Morning, handsome,” Lee greeted Dean and kissed him. He was laying next to Dean in bed shirtless with a smug smile on his face, his blue eyes were dancing over Dean’s equally shirtless torso. From the feel of it, Dean was fully naked.
“The show is about to get started, I just came to say hello. I’ll see you after,” Dean said, looking at all of them.
“Yeah, all babies cry sometimes. But Jack is fussier around me” Dean whined. “I’ve failed as a parent.”
“Our little boy isn't so little anymore,” Castiel said softly and looked at an oblivious Jack.
“The night we went out with the band?”
“Dean--” Castiel started but Dean didn’t let him finish.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked. There was a lot he had not told Castiel but he was playing coy to see whether he should divulge anything.
On their fourth date, Castiel took Dean on a helicopter night tour of NewYork City. The awestruck look on Dean’s face meant the world to Castiel, although the death grip Dean had on him the entire time they were flying over the city was not fun at all.
Castiel explained, or rather half-lied, to Mick that he had gotten an important work call from overseas. Mick knew better than to ask Castiel about work. However, he was skeptical about believing his excuse at first but came around when Castiel showed him proof. Yes, he had received a call earlier that night about work from London, so he wasn’t exactly lying, was he?
“But it won’t be the same. Two years of not being able to touch you is torture,” Castiel whined.
“Where are you going?” Sam asked, pulling his chair back to look at Cas.
“Dean, I know I hurt you, but trust me, I did it for us. I did it so we could be free and together, the way we should’ve been from the start.” Castiel tried to explain but Dean was having none of it. Castiel had loosened his grip on Dean’s arm which gave Dean the opportunity to get away from him. Once Dean was free, he reached for something in the pocket of his sweatpants.
“Oh God, Cas this was the best date ever!” Dean smiled as they walked along the river afterwards.
“Yeah, we are okay,” Castiel’s voice was softer now and his eyes looked as beautiful as always; big and the most unique shade of blue Dean had ever seen, “I'm sorry for walking out on you like that and making things unnecessarily complicated. My mom makes me insane.”
Jack was a very serious and determined baby, but his laugh always brightened up the room. He also always squealed whenever Dean was watching
“Fine, but just one,” Dean negotiated.
Sam knew. Of course, he was the first person Dean had told after he and Castiel got together. He was the one that had nudged Dean in the right direction.
Castiel spread Dean’s ass cheeks further and kneaded the toned flesh and started licking his husband’s pink sensitive ring of muscles. Dean let out a choked cry, hips stuttering as Castiel's tongue pushed into him.
“Self-deprecate.”
“Just open it, you paranoid baby.” Castiel smiled and watched as Dean’s long fingers reached for the small box and opened it.
Gordon was waiting for her at the end of the aisle in a black tuxedo. Dean was standing closely next to him, tears in his eyes remembering how, two years prior, he was the one walking down the aisle, Castiel waiting for him at the end of it. Gordon looked up at Bela adoringly. She was his at last, after years of patient waiting. Bela reached the altar and she held out her hand, Gordon took it and their eyes met and they smiled at each other, tears in Gordon's eyes. Bela was trying so hard not to cry but Dean saw how misty they were. They belonged to each other; Dean knew that. They always have since they met two decades ago.
Two days later, Castiel walked into Dean’s office at 8 p.m. carrying his briefcase. Dean was working on his laptop waiting for him.
“Frustrated, agitated. Since he told me about Mick, his sex buddy or whatever he is, we haven’t spoken,” he said a tinge of bitterness and regret in his voice as he stood up and paced the room, Mildred followed him with her eyes from where she sat on her armchair.
, Castiel thought the entire time Dean was sucking him off.
“Death would be better than being around you. You’re a disappointment,” John slurred and tried to get up again but he couldn’t.
“The money that was transferred from the offshore accounts that Nick had me set up was transferred to this bank here in the US that the FBI seized,” Michael pointed at the document, showing Castiel what he meant.
“So, what do friends talk about?"
“To life,” Dean reiterated as they clinked their glasses together and sipped their drinks.
Neither of them could have asked for anything more than what they had with each other. Their lives were even fuller because of their found family that they got to hang out with almost every Sunday evening.
“It was a pleasure being your first. I love you,” Castiel blurted out in excitement. He stopped in shock as he realized what he had just said.
“As well as can be expected,” Chuck looked at him as he put on his reading glasses and unfolded the newspaper that Metatron had brought for him.
They rode to the vineyard chatting away. Lee and Gordon were bickering as always but Dean was engrossed in the beauty of the place. The countryside was beautiful with the rolling vineyards and mountain meadows that span out throughout the area. They had passed a few villages with green plains and cows grazing around when they drove here earlier. It looked like something from a painting. The clear blue sky made it seem like he could achieve anything in that moment. And for some reason, he felt like he was riding to his destiny. He was hopeful that things would work out unlike his life back home where John would be waiting to scold him for making him spend a few hundred dollars to hire help to do the same amount of work Dean usually did for a third of what he was paying while Dean was away. He pushed the thought away and took in the scenery as they approached the chateau where the vineyard was located.
