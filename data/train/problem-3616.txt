“Dude, what you doing?” Dean asked, his breath hitching, but only slightly. He steadfastly ignored the open stare they were receiving from the minivan mom at the red light; Cas of course had no awareness of anything but Dean at that moment.
“Beautiful and strong but aloof and vicious,” Cas expounded, and Dean looked at him sideways. Um. Whatever. He didn’t like cats anyway.
“I thought I was being subtle,” he told Sam. “You’ve been talking about her so much.” Dean was about to pick on his brother for not confiding in him as well, but Sam was actually flustered, and it was Christmas; maybe he’d be nice to him this time.
The idea was hot as hell in theory; this bombshell luring them both into her bed and having her wicked way with them. Watching Cas get aroused and then climax almost made Dean light headed at just the suggestion. But it was the part where
He’d finally come into the room enough to now set the wriggling kitten upon the map table, where she began sniffing at the edge of Russia. She looked so lost and bedraggled; it was little wonder that Cas had been drawn to her.
Cas pressed him forward, making him bend at the waist so that Dean had to bring his hands up to the table’s surface to catch himself, the marble cold and unforgiving. There were no other sounds in the room than the back and forth of their harsh breathing and the slide of angel hands on human skin. And then as Cas explored further, a moan came from his throat.
Dean!” During the course of this mouthful, Cas’s tone went from gloomy to scolding on the last words. He glared down at his human, all not-quite-six-feet of righteous celestial power threatening to rain upon Dean. And the hunter knew it was a lost cause; they obviously now had a cat.
Dean swigged his coffee, not even appreciating the taste. He wandered into the library where Sam was at the table, leaning over his laptop.
Cas had lately taken to going for walks in town now that it was getting warmer, which helped give him and Dean some rather needed space since they were closing in on final wedding plans. Dean was also working on a secret project for his lover, so the time apart was working quite well. Until it was the angel that surprised him.
“He’s gone,” he said blankly, beyond caring if he was starting to panic.
If Dean had wanted to blindly attack either of them, this speech left him almost as frozen as Cas. The ghost was Dante? And this Sirona wanted to keep Cas as a pet angel so she could heal people? Not the usual nefarious motive Dean was used to being up against. Not like it mattered; it was still his Cas’s freedom that was at stake. Dean didn’t know how much longer he had before whatever that creepy little dude was mumbling would be complete.
Suddenly the quiet of the moment was broken by the rooster screaming again, making Sam jump. It seemed angry, and almost like it knew Sam, and was acting awfully at home in the car, not to mention had purposely grabbed the army man that Sam now had his fist curled around as if it could ground him…
He smoothed his hand over Cas’s dark hair, taking note of the angel’s breath huffing along his collarbone on every exhale. He made a mental note to start seriously looking for a little cabin they could escape to for nights like these; he wanted Cas to be able to completely let go sometimes. But this memory of being together under the Christmas tree was one he knew would stay with him for the rest of time. His fingers reverently traced along the thick feathers of the wings that Cas didn’t have the energy to put away yet, and his angel sighed contentedly, his soft cock ever so slowly slipping out of Dean.
“Can I kiss you?” Dean’s voice was rough, almost broken but barely held together.
at you like that? Like you were the center of their world and they might crumble if you went away. Dean grabbed for the lapels of the trench coat before his knees gave out.
All Dean could do was catch his breath and stare at Cas’s full wet lips for a moment, terrified to meet the angel’s eyes but also perfectly happy with where his gaze currently was. His entire body was thrumming. And the ringing was persisting.
“Or maybe it was those little nervous gold monkeys,” Cas rethought. “They were very much like Sam.” Dean released a laugh that scared the seagulls circling the cars they were walking by on the trek back to the Impala. He’d insisted on driving here, on treating this as close to a normal, well, date, as he was able to. Besides, he knew Cas liked being able to ride shotgun for a change.
They slipped into the party easily enough, and Dean understood why he’d had to put a costume on. He saw everything from pop culture movie references to some of the more traditional monsters, including one fully furred werewolf that he’d be impressed by if he didn’t know the real thing looked nothing like that. There was even a troupe of people who had painted themselves blue and were running around as Smurfs.
When Cas returned to the bunker one day, the expression that he wore was one Dean had never really seen before as the hunter flashed a warm grin in greeting up at him. Dean sat at the map table, checking his email, and he noticed Cas’s hair and the shoulders of his trench coat were damp from a sudden spring shower, but he was making no move to dry off.
“We’re not really supposed to believe that those are real chipmunks singing, right?” Cas asked at that particular song, amusing both Winchesters as they relaxed for a bit after their meal. Dean soaked in the perfection of the moment with a smile in his heart. Sam had been forbidden to get on his laptop today for anything but playing the music, so that he wouldn’t run across any cases to worry them. One day, just one Christmas Day of peace: the three of them deserved that much.
Dean was terrified in the best of ways as Cas drew closer again, and he could feel the heat of the angel’s dick before it even touched him. He shouldn’t want this, there was no way this wasn’t going to hurt, and he wasn’t sure he’d ever forgive himself or Cas for this.
“Now, my sister, she’s the one that can heal anything or anybody. It’s always Sequana this and Sequana that, she gets all the glory and riches. While little Sirona has always had to be in her shadow. Well, not anymore,” she gloated, her creepy eyes gleaming. “Once my old pal Dante over there is done with his spell, I’ll have an angel and all the healing power that goes with him. Then let’s see who can help more people!”
As Cas drew the little black box out into the open, Dean fixed his eyes on his angel’s handsome visage, and his heart gave three wild thumps. Like they weren’t already engaged.
“As you wish,” Castiel said again, and it almost sounded like there was a smile in his voice. “Don’t worry, Dean. I’m going to take good care of you. Forever.”
“Motel?” he asked hopefully. He needed a shower and a bed, something fierce.
The day after and where Dean goes from here.
When Cas goes missing, it's rescue mission on. Dean will be damned if anything tries to take his angel away now, no matter where he might be.
It stood about two feet tall, and its sturdy bulk was a rather impressive presence in the confines of the car. Now that the bird was still, Sam could tell the feathers were a glossy mix of deep brown and auburn red mingled with some forest green that shimmered a bit in the morning sun. Towards its hind end, the feathers got darker and the tail was a plume of black and dark emerald green. As far as chickens went, it was rather nice looking.
“You seem distracted,” Sam noted. Dean spared him an annoyed glance then centered his gaze back on the center of the dark road, the yellow line reflecting in the headlights.
“I know, and I’m sorry,” Sam told him. “I just need backup, man.”
“And this will help with that?” Cas asked him, his head tilting in his patented curious move and his eyes squinting. Not that Dean was watching him that closely from where he was doing a second shot. This was good, he thought. So Cas hadn’t somehow turned into a sex god when he’d put on that costume. He just looked like one.
He looked up from the cat to his Cas and saw that those beautiful eyes were nearly glowing as he watched the kitten explore more of the surface of the map table and start to peer around at the huge room she’d found herself in, her bravery slowly expanding. That was the look that was usually reserved for him, Dean couldn’t help but notice, and he knew he was doomed. Cas was in love. With a goddamn feline. He could already feel the prickling behind his eyes and the tickle deep in his sinuses. He added allergy medication to the growing shopping list in his head.
“Merry Christmas, Cas,” Dean smiled back. He slid closer to his lover to be able to kiss him good morning. He loved Cas’s bed rumpled smell of having cuddled with him while Dean slept, it was another of those tiny intimate details that made the hunter sink deeper every time he noticed them. He sighed in contentment with his head against Cas’s chest, wrapped in the angel’s arms. But it was Christmas, and they had to get up.
“I love you, too, Cas,” Dean breathed after a moment, his heart beating irregularly at the gentle but stark confession even as he drifted off to a doze, using his angel as a pillow.
The feathered head jerked to the side on a tilt and the animal let out another short squawk that almost sounded like the word “jerk”. But that was impossible, and insane. Sam needed to get this thing out of Dean’s precious car before it shit on the leather seats or something.
“Stop lying to yourself,” Cas’s gravelly but sweet voice murmured into his ear. “I see the way you look at me. I’m a celestial being, I can feel the desire coming off of you in waves whenever I’m around you. It took me awhile to understand what it was, but now that I have...I
“They’re so gorgeous,” Dean gushed, knowing he’d never be able to verbally express what the sight of those wings did to him. “They’re so you, they’re so…”
An hour later and Dean had almost lost sight of Cas as more guests had arrived at the party. The alcohol was flowing, people were getting more talkative, and it was getting tough to try to get information while also watching Cas’s every move and the way his shoulders flexed underneath that tight tee. Dean inched closer to where the angel was, tuning his ears into the conversation he was having.
Tension and reluctant longing and trying to get Cas to understand consent.
There’s blood on Dean’s beautiful face, blood that Castiel has caused to be there, and the angel stares in horror at what he’s done. This is love? This is horrible. And the knowledge finally hits Castiel, on this dirty city street at ten o’clock on a Thursday night, with Dean injured by his hand crouched in front of him. This is love. He’d never imagined it to be this messy.
“C’mon, Dean, let’s go home,” Cas said, and teleported himself and the rooster into the map room of the bunker. The Winchester’s base had become something of a home to Castiel as well, even if he didn’t spend as much time there as the guys. But the brick walls, the polished wood, the smell of hundreds of old books and parchment were familiar and welcoming to Cas, and he hoped they were to Dean as well, especially now.
“Why anybody would want into this family, I don’t know,” Sam joked as he hugged Cas back heartily. “But I already think of you as a brother.” Cas just beamed that thousand watt smile at him when he stepped back.
He had a thought to take a glance over his shoulder but there was no way he had the balls for that. If he kept his eyes glued shut that made this less real somehow. Or was it more real, as he could practically feel Cas’s concentration while the angel defiled him?
As for Cas, he’d confessed several times in the weeks leading up to Christmas that he didn’t really know how to do this material gift thing. They had both of course comforted him that he didn't have to get them anything, Dean especially adamant that he’d already given him the best present ever, himself, but Cas had still tried.
Dean began licking the rest of the shaft in earnest, not fully knowing what he was doing any more than Cas had, but having a clear picture of what he knew felt good and the until-now unexpected desire to replicate it. He did appreciate how warm Cas’s cock was on his tongue, and the heavy, almost sweet smell of it filling his nostrils. He’d always figured chicks did this for brownie points, so maybe you’d go down on them later, or just fuck them better, but now he saw there was an enjoyment to be had in having your face full of cock, though he would have died before ever admitting that to anyone. Or again, maybe that was just cause this was his angel.
Dean gently took the ring from Cas and slipped it on his fiancee’s left ring finger, a rush going through him at the symbolism of the action. Cas held his hand up to admire the band, eyes soft and shining.
“Don’t ever bring me to this damn room again,” Dean told him levelly, not so depleted as to have lost all of his anger. “Beds are way more comfortable.”
“Underwear too,” he had to tell him, and helped the angel pull his boxers down with his pants to pool between his feet. Cas’s cock sprung free, huge and hard as ever, and nearly slapped Dean on the side of the face. Dean’s heart had time to thud twice; was he really about to do this? And the answer - this was his Cas, and the
This thought slowed and then stopped his fingers where they’d worked their way onto Dean’s feathered neck. The hunter turned rooster had not only not stepped away, it almost sounded as if he was emitting a purr of enjoyment while his eyes blinked slowly at the angel. But on the chance Dean was not fully in his own mind right now, and Cas had no idea if it was possible that he was, he couldn’t pretend that the real Dean would be as consenting as this chicken was to being petted. Oh he could wish he was...he often had...but if it had not happened by now in all their human years of knowing each other, no matter how many looks they’d shared, Cas had to respect that.
“Dean?” Cas asked it, and the rooster gave a squawk that was becoming familiar to Sam, and walked around in a tight circle as if to say, yeah, this is me. He fixed Cas in his golden stare and blinked once at him. The angel had stood up as the man and the rooster had approached, and now he had to sit back down.
It was a quiet morning even on this main county route, the spring sunshine smiling down. Sam couldn’t even remember the name of the town but it seemed like a nice place. Only a couple of cars wandered by as he unlocked and swung open the driver’s side door of the Impala. All of a sudden, a wild squawking sound tore into Sam’s ears, and in a cloud of Midwestern dust a blur of reddish brown fluttered up from underneath the car and right into the front seat. Sam wasn’t quick enough to stop the ball of...was that feathers?!...from clumsily flapping into the spot behind the steering wheel. He blinked twice, hard, and then could only stare. That. Was a chicken. Standing on the bench seat of the Impala, almost proudly.
“Castiel, angel of the Lord, will you marry me?” Cas began shaking his head and for a split second Dean was terrified, regardless of what he already knew to be true, but Cas was smiling warmly and widely down at him.
Features somewhat domesticDean, caringDean, fantasizingDean, coming-to-terms-with-his-feelingsDean and Cas just being adorable.
“You look, you look good, Cas,” Sam reassured, and the corners of the angel’s lips turned up a bit at the corners. This most certainly did not make Dean jealous. Why was this making Dean jealous? Dean poured himself a third shot.
“And as for you over there,” Sam directed his attention to his older brother, “Don’t think you’re getting away with stopping and buying one of those ‘This is my Halloween costume’ shirts.”
Castiel’s grip was heavy on Dean’s shoulder as the angel marched the hunter into that damn green room, with its walls as white as ever, the garish gold accents as overdone as ever. This wasn’t the first time Dean had been forced into this room of course, but he’d thought he was done with it. Zachariah was dead, killed by Dean’s own hand, the apocalypse had been averted, with no archangels having had to possess anybody. There was no further need for the celestial dicks to try to make Dean do or not do anything. He thought. So why was Castiel bringing him here?
Dean's known for awhile now that someday Cas would bring home some kind of pet. Just as he's known he wouldn't be able to tell him no. And then there's the matter of a name.
“C’mon, let’s go get a drink,” Dean said, looking into Cas’s eyes, his voice as not-pleading as he could make it but he wasn’t sure he succeeded.
“I know. I know,” Dean soothed now. “And I love it when you do, trust me. But if you lose it out here, you could destroy the whole place.” He shuddered to think what that beauty of a tree with all its lights and delicate ornaments alone would end up looking like, not to mention the sharp projectiles that would result.
Only heavy feels in this chapter, but there will be more smut to come (no pun intended lol).
“Relax, Dean, I want to make this good for you,” that gravelly voice floated towards him even as there was a nearly unbearable pressure at his opening. Dean closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, trying not to ball his hands into fists. Relax. Right.
“Nothing,” Sam finally said with an air of soft finality, at least for the moment, and Dean sent up a silent thanks to no one in particular.
“Cas, stop it,” Dean commanded, his voice strong as he leaned up to get his weight shifted back to his feet. But Cas was stronger and a hand pressed into his back, keeping him bent forward slightly while the other hand continued to knead his ass. To top it all off, he could feel the edge of a trench coat brush against his legs every so often. It was insult to injury; he was being molested, there was no other word for it. And now Castiel’s low voice came again, huskier than Dean had ever heard it:
“She was nice,” Cas said innocently, to which Dean could only shake his head and grin. “Why didn’t you want to spend time with her?” Dean’s hand was still on the angel’s shoulder, and if Cas was this naive, he wasn’t sure he ever wanted to remove it.
Dean twisted around to peer into the backseat, his hand holding tight to the steering wheel to ground himself like only his baby could do. His heart turned over at the sight that met his widening eyes.
“Didn’t mean to make your cowboy jealous,” Harley said smoothly, her voice like smoke over ice. She now gave Dean an appreciative once over, obviously liking what she saw as the tip of her tongue came out to rest on her upper lip. Goddamn she was sexy.
With a glance up at his lover’s expression, and of course Cas was staring down at him wide eyed, excitement and love shining in those blue orbs so that was the only thing Dean saw before his tongue came into contact with cock for the first time. Not one to back down from a challenge, even one he’d only made for himself, he licked a healthy path up the underside first, and didn’t let himself shy away from the already leaking head and slit. It really didn’t taste that bad, he reflected, especially as Cas let out a little whimper of pleasure above him. If he thought that felt good…
“Dude are you serious?” was all Sam could think of in response. He had to pinch the bridge of his nose and close his eyes a moment. In their admittedly strange lives, Dean had been possessed by a demon, performed a spell that made him act like a dog, and other sundry oddities, but full transformation into another species was a new one.
And even though there might be a ceremony and a signed piece of paper to come, this was all that mattered, this made it real between them, this feeling of claiming as the silver band settled around Dean’s ring finger. Overwhelmed by the emotion of the moment, the Christmas tree lights glowing and the music playing low, Dean felt the moisture behind his eyes.
Nothing about the locked car or the dark and closed up bar suggested foul play to Sam, so he figured he’d drive back to the hotel room and try to track Dean’s phone. He smirked to himself as he thought of his brother coming back to the parking lot after he’d pulled away and having a heart attack that his baby wasn’t there. Would serve him right for taking so long. Fuck, Sam hoped this was as simple as that.
Sam came back to the driver’s side and slid into the seat, watching the rooster as it clearly watched him. If he didn’t know any better, he’d think the thing was staring him down, trying to tell him something. Sam looked away from those sharp eyes, and turned the key in the ignition, thinking surely the impressive rumble of the Impala’s engine would scare the bird away. But it seemed to actually stand up straighter. Now it seemed to be analyzing the tape deck Dean insisted on keeping in there. It’s not like it was even original to the car, so Sam didn’t understand how it was so wrong to update to an iPod dock.
“I bet you do,” Dean teased, slipping back into his smartass persona as best and as quickly as he could. “Be right there,” he promised and hit the end button.
Suddenly a nubile female with barely anything on is leading him away, and Dean is smiling wider than ever, and Cas knows he doesn’t want this. He’ll admit he’s been curious about sex, sure, but this feels wrong. The potential experience is not so important to him that he’s willing to overlook the lack of love between partners, and there is simply no way to establish that as quickly as what it seems this girl would like to. Cas tries a comforting gesture, telling her some good news about her past that he can sense, but she gets very upset with him, and Cas is left even more confused. But then Dean is there, with him, instead of with the female he’d been appropriating, rescuing Cas in this situation. The man’s arm seems tighter around his shoulders than usual as they stand in the alley behind the establishment and Cas would rather be here than in that overly scented room with that strange girl. He wishes her well. Everyone deserves real love, not a false version.
“Don’t worry,” Sam told him, “I’m making you the whole package of bacon. This is just the first round.” Dean paused, not quite believing he was about to say these words.
“But what about Cas?” Dean couldn’t even care that he had a one track mind right now.
“So what was your favorite animal?” Dean asked on the way back to the car, once they had seen everything and the zoo had closed its gates behind them. Cas thought for a moment, deeply considering.
Dean's been wondering what this would feel like, and he knows he can trust Cas to take care of him. And some more wingkink, in rather a big way.
He never in a million years thought he would find himself in this situation. The minutes seemed to be dragging on, Cas’s thumb frozen in place at his entrance, the angel’s breath hot on his shoulder blade, as if he wanted to make this last as long as possible. Or maybe he was thinking. Dean squeezed his eyes shut, willing Cas to get on with whatever he was going to do to him so it could just be over with.
“Um, Cas,” Dean started, “Your tail…” Not that he’d been looking at the guy’s ass, he just hadn’t been able to help but notice.
“That’s not - really the same…” he started, then gave up. “Did you really lay here all night?” he asked the angel instead.
Sam and Dean were both ready to go. They’d done their due diligence, and gotten what they could out of these people, which was a decent amount. To be fair, it was Sam that had worked his way in with the older set who had told him stories of the great uncle, long dead now, who’d been a serial killer. This explained a lot, even if the family would never have been able to understand that.
“But I must ask you for your approval of this arrangement,” he said seriously. “As deep as my bond is with Dean, he is your brother and I have no intentions of getting in the way of the connection you had with him first.”
“She knew my life and since then, my death, has been devoted to the study of angels and that I possess the knowledge of the old magics. She promised she would only perform good deeds with your power and I - I am afraid that I let the romance of it go to my head.” If it was possible for a ghost to weep, Dean almost thought Dante would have been. Dude was certainly remorseful, but if he knew that kind of old magic, couldn’t he be considered dangerous?
“The tigers,” he said seriously. “They remind me of you.” Dean tried not to let his chest puff out a little at this. When your lover compared you to a tiger, it was hard to remain humble.
As usual, he’d stepped too close, and now rather than the “Yes Dean?” that the hunter had gotten used to hearing in that gravelly voice, Cas made this sound, like a cross between a snarl and a growl. Dean’s head drew back, and under normal circumstances he would have laughed, but he couldn’t quite manage it. Not with Cas’s bluer than blue eyes, somehow made brighter by all the black, so intent on his own, and Dean guessed the message was clear: Cas was not meant to be some common house cat. Out of nowhere, Dean had an image of trying to put a collar on this Cas and he did an abrupt about face to get away from the angel and
Dean's not too fond of this wedding planning thing, but of course he'll do anything for his angel. And a couple of familiar faces make an appearance.
And he had to stop here, because his breath was stolen by the unfurling of said wings, glossy black erupting from behind his lover, and someday he’d have to ask Cas what that felt like, to his back, to his vessel’s bones and muscles and tendons.
But he did anyway, peering over his shoulder the best he could, his gaze catching the trench coat of course, the scuffed loafers, the pants now shoved down to Cas’s knees. Dean managed to skip over the motion of the angel’s hand slicking himself up on his way up to Cas’s face.
Shane. Such a stupid name to get between them like this, to have ruined the night, and to be getting Cas’s attention even now. Which was Dean’s fault, he had no one to blame but himself for that. The jealous rage, at himself and Cas as well as that stupid Shane, coiled in Dean’s gut and heart and refused to budge. It was still going to be a long night.
But an appropriate name for the kitten hadn’t occurred to Dean yet; he’d never named anything, never had a pet. He’d suggested the rote black cat handles: Midnight, Shadow, even Onyx, and Cas had dismissed them all out of hand. Apparently he wanted something more unique. Then why didn’t he name her? Of course, he had never done so either.
“So why are we here?” Dean asked, forcing the tremor not to rise in his voice. He was tired from the fight with the archangels and he wasn’t sure how much strength he had left to bring down another celestial being, even a lesser one, if he had to. Sam wasn’t able to get in here, wherever here was, and it had been Cas that had saved him from destruction in this room once before. If he was now turning on him...Dean was trying hard to not admit to himself that he was scared, but he was.
“Of course she can’t,” Sam agreed, “But she has the skills to reverse this. I hope. We’ll just have to owe her one.”
“Dean, I told you to take off your clothes.” Cas’s voice was still stony but there seemed to be a breathless quality to it now. Or maybe that was just because Dean could feel the warm rush of air they caused on his ear with Cas being so damn close. The sensation caused a twinge deep in his belly. Rabid fear, no doubt.
“Wow,” Sam breathed as they approached the ancient building in the gathering dusk. The cobblestone streets were still thronged with tourists, taking picture after picture of the old stone walls and columns.
He kneels down to the asphalt, the rain and dirt dampening his trousers, but he doesn’t notice. He wraps his arms around Dean and uses the last little bit of grace available to him to heal what he’s done and to give the man as much comfort as he’s able. He realizes there are tears in Dean’s eyes. Dean asks what Castiel is doing, the angel supposes because they’ve never been this physically close for this long before. He responds that isn’t it obvious, he’s holding him, and Dean chuckles, a sound that Cas loves.
“Congratulations, guys,” Sam told them. Dean only nodded, his throat oddly tight at watching Cas and Sam bond. Once upon a time, Cas hadn’t been Sam’s biggest fan, way back when the angel had first started hanging around. They’d come a long way.
How had Cas learned to kiss like this, and Dean almost broke away to laugh when he remembered the porn the then-even-more-naive-angel used to watch. With the few brain cells that were still in operation as Cas swirled his tongue around his and
“No,” he told the well meaning angel. “She needs something milder than that. I’ll...I’ll go get some baby shampoo,” he said, realizing they didn’t have anything gentle enough in the bunker to wash this delicate creature with.
It was like he was a kid again, only better. Dean had the vaguest of memories of these kinds of Christmas mornings from when he was a very small child, waking up with the sudden knowledge that it was
“C’mere,” Dean muttered, hoping Cas would get the hint. “Please,” he added, just conscious enough to be grateful for only being half conscious; he didn’t know if he could ask for this otherwise. He vaguely heard a sliding of fabric, then was rewarded with Cas settling onto the bed next to him, warm and soft and so close. Dean stirred enough to shimmy back to give Cas some room as the angel laid down, everything but the coat on of course. Dean grinned weakly at him and used the last of his strength to try to draw the solid body towards him.
“Fuck, you’re good at that,” he told Cas breathlessly once he’d managed to pull back. Cas’s fingers clutched tighter at the back of his neck and his waist where they were anchored in response, and Dean could have sworn he felt him tremble. He definitely identified the press of heavy warmth on his hip, and a thrill of uncertain desire trickled through him at this knowledge. This whole sharply attracted to a male thing was still new to him, and he wasn’t sure how far to let blind lust lead.
Cas’s eyes widened in turn, big soft pools that Dean could lose himself in if he wasn’t careful. He wasn’t feeling particularly careful lately.
“Give me that.” He took the computer from Dean and began coolly booking two flights with a laser focus.
“I don’t know what choice we have,” Sam said, looking at his brother the chicken. “We can’t leave him like this. I guess we could see if it just wears off with time.” At this, Dean lifted himself onto his strong stick legs and strutted over to Cas, who was sitting on the corner of his bed.
“When have you ever listened to me on that?” His eyes were half closed, begging for rest, but he could just make out the shape of the angel standing next to his bed. Dean lifted a heavy arm and attempted to make a grabbing motion at the air. He was fading fast.
“You came for me,” Cas mumbled into Dean’s hair. “You came for me.” Like there’d been anything else Dean could have done.
“Yeah well, a lot of these people would like to do more than mingle,” Dean told him, not sure how to explain.
“I hope you two are very happy together,” Cas beamed. Sam shook his head, not without a grin.
Dean had been able to maintain a nice buzz, just shy of drunk. Now they just had to get his...their...angel and get out of there. But where the hell was Cas? He wasn’t at the bar, he wasn’t at the snack table, he wasn’t at the edge of the dance floor where he’d enjoyed being for a good portion of the night, watching all the costumed fools flail about.
Dean could only lay there for a few moments, having reached for Cas’s hand and gripping it tight, thoroughly blissed out in both mind and body. Cas’s hand slipped out of his as he stood up, looking utterly pleased with himself and licking his lips. Dean stared at him for a moment, and unconsciously licked his own lips in response. He gathered his wits and took the plunge.
“It doesn’t exactly work like that,” he explained. “I mean, look at how long it took you and Dean to get together.” Now it was Dean’s turn to look embarrassed, and his nerves were jumping as he retrieved the small gift bag where he’d hidden it under the tree. Cas and Sam could not have segued into the next portion of this day in a better fashion if they’d tried, and Dean knew he couldn’t stall any longer. He placed the bag in Cas’s hands, and stood there watching, hoping he’d like it, hoping he hadn’t gone too corny, hoping it wasn’t too much.
“Don’t worry, I got you a few things. I know you already have the boots.” Dean downed his last shot and made his way to the bag, admittedly curious. He had to grin when he peeked inside. Sam might be an annoying little brother but he did know him, and if he had to wear a costume, Dean could deal with this.
“Thanks Cas.” Dean knew he should say it as well, but all he could seem to do was smile what even he could tell was a goofy smile at the angel in gratitude. The warm gaze he was receiving in return told him that Cas was getting the message, though, and Dean was so glad the whole not letting themselves look at each other thing seemed to be over.
It was so hard to read the guy. One minute he’d be all righteous and devout, then the next almost gentle in his confusion over some human matter. And through it all, he seemed fascinated with Dean, too much so if one asked Dean; the stares that never stopped, the standing too close, the always there when he least expected it. Still, Cas had raised him from Hell, and had done enough to convince Dean that he wasn’t like the other angels. So Dean trusted him when he’d put that hand on his shoulder and told him to come with him. Now he wasn’t so sure.
“Dude,” he found himself addressing the rooster. “I don’t know where you came from, but you gotta go back there. Dean is going to kill us both if he finds out there was a chicken in his car.”
Oh, and a bonus deleted scene that just didn't end up fitting anywhere:
“He’s in France.”
“So does this mean you’d like me to give you away at the wedding?” Sam asked Dean, his voice teasing. Dean shot him a withering look, even as he privately acknowledged that it probably wouldn’t be inappropriate. It’s not like any ceremony they were going to have would be any sort of traditional.
Dean and Sam were only an hour from home, the job done, the spirit killed, and Dean had been driving all night. They’d had to beat it out of town when the local cops got a little too suspicious and they hadn’t stopped other than for gas to be on the safe side. Dean was exhausted, his eyelids close to drooping, and he knew he should let Sam take this last stretch. His thoughts were wired, though, keeping him somewhat alert.
Cas’s lips danced in a smirking smile that managed to be tender and loving as he stared down at Dean, his eyes playful.
“You’re very hot,” Cas whispered seriously in his ear, and Dean punched the gas a little harder than he meant to. That hand on his thigh was creeping closer and closer…
There was no brother in the other bed. Dean’s duffel sat just where he’d left it in the center of the messy sheets last night before he’d gone out. Sam pushed himself up to peer at the floor, not letting himself worry yet. It wouldn’t be the first time Dean hadn’t been able to make it to the bed. Floor was clear. Eyes flicking to the digital clock, Sam’s heart sped up a touch. Nine thirty. This was pushing it, even for Dean. He was as concerned about Mom as Sam was.
“Very well, I’ll be there shortly.” Sam hung up, reached around the rooster shaped Dean to close the passenger door and replace the army man safely in the ashtray, and put the Impala in gear.
“Hush,” Cas soothed. “We’re here now.” He began shifting, and though Dean didn’t really want to move, he was hopelessly willing to let Cas do whatever he wanted. It was amazing the difference a few words, an intimate lesson, one kiss, and some hot chocolate could have.
This job had come up at a good time, an unusual death by a household Halloween decoration, over in Indiana. Something to get Dean out of the bunker and away from everything. Or so he thought.
“Take off your clothes,” Cas said brusquely, in lieu of an answer to Dean’s question.
Thank you for reading and coming along for the ride!!!
Dean ran for the door, using the last of his adrenaline to power through anyone who tried to stop him. Once outside, he gulped the cold air, and made a beeline for the Impala. Shit, that’s right, Sam had the keys. Dean sunk down on the damp frosty ground, his back against one of Baby’s tires, and buried his face in his arms, wishing the world in that moment away.
All good things must come to an end, though, and Dean’s climax began threatening.
Dean knew this might be the oddest thing he’d ever said, turning down extra bacon, but he’d decided he had to start somewhere. It was one of his gifts to Cas, if unspoken; he’d said he wanted him forever. While Dean certainly couldn’t give him that, for the first time he had a reason to try to make responsible decisions concerning his health so that maybe he could be around for as long as he could be anyway. This whole eating better thing was a new concept and would be rough to get used to, but if that’s what made his man happy...
Cas had been staring at him for years, and while Dean had sneaked plenty of secret glimpses in exquisite denial, it was high time he openly returned the honor. There was a certain comfort in the angel’s mere presence, that much Dean had learned to appreciate a while ago. But it took him slowing down and facing Cas, and himself, just like this, just like now, before he could truly soak in the value of what Cas had been trying to give him all along. Maybe only a true angel would have been able to be this patient with a cursed lunkhead like him.
“I’ll be fine,” Sam said again. “Keep Dean safe. If those British bastards find out about this...”
“Yeah, and some people die,” Dean shot back.
“Yeah,” he answered Sam’s call, hoping he sounded halfway close to normal. There was no way after that.
No one ever had to know. He’d swear Cas to secrecy or death once this was over, and they could go on with their lives. The memory of how fucking amazing having most of Cas’s fingers buried in his ass felt while his dick leaked precome onto the floor of this cursed room would fade. Dean pushed back and tried not to release another whimper as the fingers withdrew.
and with this possessive gleam in the angel’s baby blues, as well as this new brand of soreness deep inside him, it was hard not to feel like he’d been claimed in every possible way. Dean allowed his head to droop onto Cas’s shoulder before Cas teleported them away. He’d unpack all that later; he was just so drained right now.
His big paws were grasping Cas by the hips, pulling the angel’s ass back into him. Not that he had to work hard, from what Dean could see, that perfectly shaped leather clad ass was all too eager to be rubbing against what he was sure was an erection in the leopard man’s thin leggings.
be touching Cas that Dean shut down. The angel didn’t even really know about sex, Dean was not okay with him being taken advantage of like this. At least that’s what he told himself as his fingers dug into Cas’s shoulder harshly.
“Oh stop it,” Cas said, his tone exasperated but still gentle. Then he thought, why not, what was the worst Dean could do right now, peck him to death? And he reached up his hand, finger outstretched, to stroke once at the bottom of Dean’s comb along the top of his beak, as Tracy had done. Dean’s first reaction was to pull his head sharply back, and Cas braced himself for the pointy end of that beak to stab at the skin of his hand. Maybe he deserved it - that had been bold, something he’d never do to a human Dean. Though perhaps he’d like to, and he tried to shove that thought away.
“As many as you can, then. Please,” Dean interrupted, through a grimace now. If he didn’t get some booze in him immediately, he was going to lose it. And they’d only just started the second, much longer, leg of their flight.
He’d never heard an angel
Cas blinked up at him, not unlike a cat himself, and smiled at Dean, no words needed. He must have finally hit on a name Cas approved of. Snapping the light off, he cuddled in closer to his angel with their cat between them, and in the dark found his favorite lips to press the softest of kisses to while Grace’s purring deepened.
“Do you still wish me to not look over you while you sleep?” A shadow of a chuckle escaped Dean’s throat.
“I’ll be around if you boys change your mind,” she left the offer open, and Dean turned Cas away, not sure whose ass she was checking out more as they walked off towards the bar.
“Um, sometimes?” Cas returned with a shy smile, and the woman grinned wider, even more predatory. She was gorgeous, almost as tall as Cas in her platform boots, tits filling out that halter top nicely, with nipples almost poking through the cloth. The tiny shorts barely covered a nice round ass, there was just a hint of cheek peeking out underneath the fishnet stockings. Any other time Dean would have been trying to get his own hands on that, but what the hell was she doing flirting with Cas? And had he just flirted back?
“I’ve never understood where humans got the halo idea from,” Cas shared with Dean after the girl had walked away, making Dean wish he could lean in and kiss Cas’s cheek. Sometimes he was just so cute.
Dean half growled as he wrenched the door open and stepped back out into the October night.
“You have no business here,” she intoned, and this was when Dean noticed she had the slitted pupils of a snake. He held himself in check, knowing he was outnumbered; there was still that other figure over there, a rancid looking short man that Dean would have bet his baby on was a ghost, and he was just standing there staring at Cas. Dean's hand twitched, wanting to attack, but he needed more information about what the hell this all was.
“Nothing,” Dean returned, pretty sure his voice was steady.
"I need to settle something with a demon, and you have a little more rapport with them than I do,” Rowena told him, with a sideways glance at the impressive building they were in the parking lot of. Sam sighed. He’d known this wasn’t going to be good.
“He could always come too,” she said, still speaking to Cas. Dean’s already tight jeans tightened a bit more at this thought...slipping that halter top off of those tits, shimmying those shorts down, those full lips on Cas’s chest, her hands cupping Cas’s ass...no. No. No. No.
you Dean.” It was now the angel that sounded tortured, and that finger was still circling, teasing or threatening, Dean wasn’t sure which anymore.
“For that matter, it’s not good for humans, either. And you know I wish you didn’t drink so much.” This earned him a sharp sideways glance from the rooster, and Cas wasn’t sure what had caused him to say this. It was surely true, but he’d never had the nerve to say it to Dean before, he usually kept it to a remonstrating look when the human was starting to drink too much. He knew Dean wouldn’t listen to him even if he did say something. But now he had to listen, now Cas some control. He pulled the glass fully out of the chicken’s reach and twisted his arm around to push it up on the table. Only to have Dean give him a dirty stare and appear to begin measuring up the table height to see if he could fly or jump that high.
“He’s safe,” he said quickly. “Mostly,” he added. “We both are. I just, need help figuring something out.”
“That was truly magical,” Cas gushed as Dean started the engine, and he had to look over at his angel’s face. An angel of the Lord, with powers beyond anything most of humanity was capable of understanding, thought a zoo was magical. And this is why Dean loved him. With no warning, he lunged over the console to lay a quick kiss on Cas’s lips, leaving the guy gazing after him adorably as he planted his ass fully back in the driver’s seat.
“You need to...not lose it...as much as last time…”
“Is Dean being a little more cocky than usual?” Rowena said by way of a greeting, openly smirking, obviously enjoying this immensely. Sam had to admit, very much to himself, that that was a good line, but he kept his expression neutral.
“We’re gone too much for a pet,” he tried, somewhat lamely.
” It wasn’t even big enough to meow properly. Dean’s shoulders fell, the tenseness leaving his body now that he knew there was no threat. He sighed, reminding himself that he’d known this day was going to come, he’d just hoped he’d have a little more time. And seriously.
Dean flicked the radio on and his ears were met with the sweet sound of some good old Stones, Start Me Up to be precise, and his head immediately started moving to the jangly beat. The Impala rolled along, her driver’s shoulders now into the groove as well, and with a glance at Cas on a right turn, Dean saw the angel was also bobbing his head. They caught each other’s eye and the widest of grins exploded on their faces before they shared a raucous laugh. Dean didn’t know if he could get used to being this happy, but he was thankful for every moment of it that he was blessed with.
“If you liked the zoo here, wait till you see Columbus or San Diego,” Sam told him. Dean envisioned a lot of miles being walked in his future.
Sam opened his mouth to attempt to reply, even though he looked as if he might not know how to just yet, but the older Winchester interrupted.
It’s not as if there’s many chosen vessels, however, especially for such beings as Michael, and Cas blames it on that status at first as to why he’s drawn to Dean. What is it about him that made Father choose him? As he spends more time with Dean, the angel begins to see under the hard exterior the man has constructed to the turmoil that lies beneath.
Of course the angel, altruistic as ever, had to ensure the animals he saw in these cages were being as well taken care of as possible, so he grilled every other zookeeper he came across like they were a murder suspect. Dean tried, at first, to halt his enthusiasm, but quickly gave up; this was one more thing he loved about the guy, after all. Watching Castiel alternate between fierce advocate and enthralled child, Dean felt lucky just to be in his presence, to be the human that this incredible angel had chosen.
“I borrowed your clothes again. I hope you don’t mind.” Castiel did indeed have the band tee on, the flannel, the jeans, and Dean was so happy to see him it almost hurt. But.
“How was the…” Sam started to say, but Dean just tightened his grip on Cas’s hand and dragged the angel along, too horned up from all the teasing and completely out of fucks to give.
“Seriously, Cas, what the fuck?” he tried asking once more. One hand was smoothing down his spine while the other wandered over a pec, then slid lower. Dean’s heartbeat was fluttering in his stomach and he wished he could stop it long enough to think straight. Because he was, undisputably, straight. There was no way he should be enjoying these touches, these caresses, of the calloused hands of this dude that he’d barely begun to consider a friend.
The rooster answered with a lower pitched yell that again sounded like it could be saying, “jerk” and pecked at Sam’s arm, more gently this time.
And Cas acquiesced; slowly, gently, then faster and needier, and with every rhythm change, tips of feathers trickled along the human’s arms, and ribs, and hips, and thighs, alight with power and grace.
“Yes my cowboy,” Cas returned with a hint of a smirk, and didn’t that just make Dean’s pulse speed up a touch. He drew Cas away from Harley finally, finding some joy in the way her eyes fell as she had to let go of Cas’s arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s not my keeper!” Dean was indignant but was swiftly put in place by those sterling eyes flashing at him.
Then a handful of dancing zombies parted just so, and Dean had never been so thankful for a glimpse of black pointy ears. He had to pause for a moment to take in the scene before him: the ears were moving with the rest of their wearers’ body, in a slow sinuous movement, not wholly on the body’s own.
He couldn’t even think about using Sam’s possible objections as a defense; dude was a softie that wouldn’t be able to say no to those bright green eyes and that tiny little pink nose and...ugh, the creature was stinking cute. But Dean hated cats. Really.
?! Really? Of all things?” Cas was aware of how he felt about the creatures.
person he would ever do this for, ever be on his knees for, came back at him as he wrapped his fingers around the base of that impressive shaft.
Cas was sitting in one of the lawn chairs on the sidewalk of the motel when Sam pulled up, his trench coat dusted with red from the Outback. The familiar crease in his brow deepened when he failed to see Dean sitting next to Sam, not to mention that Sam was driving. Cas watched the younger Winchester get out of the car, followed by this large red rooster, who hopped confidently down onto the ground and proceeded to strut, there was no other word for how he was walking, next to Sam as they made their way to the room’s door. In spite of his curiosity about Dean’s whereabouts, Cas couldn’t help a small smile. He didn’t get to spend enough time around animals, and they were all so fascinating.
The trench coat was back, which made Dean’s reminiscent smile begin to turn down but then a warm mug was being pressed into his hand and the relief flooding over him at the reality that Cas was there at all overrode any disappointment.
There's just something beautiful about these guys and their love for each other that is so inspiring, as well as the wonderful readers I've had while I've been posting.
The rooster’s deep golden eyes were almost intelligent as he looked around at the Impala’s interior, down at his own feet, over at Sam, and out of the windshield. The bird’s movements were sharp and quick, his thick comb bobbing a bit with each twist and turn of its head.
If it was ever just them, he thought, and they had a place, he’d never be able to deny Cas getting some sort of pet, Dean realized. They’d probably end up with a gimpy one eyed dog or something equally as pathetic. Or Cas would get his hands on something illegal and ridiculous, and Dean wouldn’t have the heart to tell him no. Where in the world were these thoughts even coming from, Dean pondered as Cas sat on the ground at the lemur enclosure, perfectly content.
“I’ll do so much good with him. I just needed a real live angel. And I finally have one.”
Dean finally finishing giving in and Cas at least trying to practice consent.
He set the rooster down on the floor, letting Dean get his legs under him, realizing maybe he’d been holding him for a touch longer than he’d strictly had to. He unclipped the leash from the harness, and considered taking the whole thing off of him, but if he should need to leave with him again, he didn’t think he’d be able to get it back on Dean by himself. So on the pink thing stayed, but Dean seemed unconcerned with the encumbrance now.
“I see that, Suzy Homemaker,” Dean returned, starting up the coffee maker.
“Eating,” was Dean’s knee jerk response. Well, he had been nibbling on a little something.
Cas was moaning himself, shoving in deeper and deeper until Dean was completely impaled. Fuck, it hurt. But it also somehow didn’t, as if being filled like this was right and good and perfect and if Dean had been capable of rational thought he would have slapped himself for these feelings. So luckily he wasn’t, he was just a ball of lust and need with an angel buried inside him.
Who was he kidding, he was not in control here, nor did he want to be. He relished Cas’s soft grin as his lover sank deeper into him, the angel’s strong hands coming to cradle his upper thighs. Cas’s thumbs dug into the delicate flesh just shy of where Dean’s legs met his pelvis, and this simple touch, combined with the still exotic burn of his hole being stretched, almost had him coming. Though he desperately wanted to keep watching Cas and the way his lover’s face twisted with the sensations he was experiencing as his cock had slowly nestled its way all the way inside of the human, Dean’s eyes closed involuntarily and his neck arched his head back into the floor. His body was sheer electric bliss already.
“Damn, you’re huge,” Dean mumbled in between licks. He knew there was no way he was going to get this whole thing in his mouth, but he’d do the best he could.
The man let go of Cas’s hips in order to defend himself, and Cas stumbled forward with the force of Dean beginning to shake his dance partner. This meant that the man had the room to turn and swing at Dean, which he did, uttering an angry, “Dude, what the fuck?” as he did so. He landed a blow squarely on Dean’s jaw, proving he was no stranger to a tussle. But he was also no match for an enraged Winchester, and Dean shook off the punch and hurled himself towards him.
Cas sat down heavily on the bed, his legs not able to hold him any longer, angel or not, and even through the faceful of semen, Dean had to give a proud smirk at his accomplishment. It actually didn’t taste as bad as he’d thought it might; he’d heard it was bitter, and okay, there was that one time he’d shot a load so hard a spot landed on his lips and out of morbid curiosity he’d licked it off. That had reminded him of cheap warm beer that had sat out open for a couple of days.
Confusion doesn’t even begin to describe what Castiel is feeling the night that Dean tries to get him laid, whatever that means. Oh. He means to lay with a woman. Cas knows Dean does this activity a lot, Sam has told him. And Dean is comfortable in the brothel, all easy smiles and a relaxed posture for once. It’s good to see. The light is dim and while the music is unpleasant to the angel’s ears (he’s learned to appreciate the finer songs that Dean plays off the cassette tapes in his automobile), Cas is content to sit and watch Dean.
And through all of that, he’d never demanded anything, just the privilege of watching over Dean while he slept and being the one to keep the nightmares away. Dean swallowed thickly, not sure he deserved this angel staring back at him, but also knowing Cas wasn’t about to go anywhere. There was too much history between them for words to be particularly necessary, so now Dean just reached. He was enfolded into the arms of an angel as surely as if he’d always belonged there.
“Dean, you’re exhausted,” Cas told him gently. “Take your cocoa and go to bed.” Dean took a sip off of his mug; not as rich as his mom’s but not bad for an angel that probably didn’t know what it was supposed to taste like. He wished he could wrap Cas in a hug, he wished he could stay up and spend time with him, but he was a mere human and he did need sleep. So he followed his friend’s well meaning orders and shuffled off down the hall, clutching his mug tightly. This being taken care of thing was nice, he thought in a daze, peeling his outer shirt off and swapping his jeans for sweatpants. Dean all but collapsed into bed, making sure he downed most of his cocoa before his head found the sweet spot on his pillow. A soft but deep voice tethered him to the waking world for a bit longer.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice began to cut through the haze of rage and jealousy, and he could feel Sam’s strong arms trying to pull him off of the guy on the floor.
It wasn’t until Cas leaned back again that Dean realized he’d eased another finger into him and the stretch, which should have been painful or at least unpleasant, was anything but. Dean’s fingernails scrambled at the marble table top, instinctively trying to find a purchase that wasn’t to be had, still not okay with how this was going down but unable to deny the jolts of pleasure that were shooting up his spine when Cas twisted his fingers. Just. Like. That.
“And Cas?”
Planning for the future wasn’t a Winchester’s strong suit. Sam tried desperately to hold onto an idea of something, some apple pie life out there, and Dean just scoffed at him usually. Living was for the moment, not an abstract point in the future that you might never see. So it was Dean’s philosophy to eat, drink, and make whoopie like there was no tomorrow.
This was stupid. They pretty much played dress up every other day of their lives, but at least it was in still-normal clothes. Though Dean did have to admit, the sight of Sammy in a ruffled white shirt, knee-high black boots, a swash-buckling red coat, and an eye patch was hilarious. Leave it to his little brother to use this as some sort of wish fulfillment.
He was unsure whether to put the bowls on the floor for Dean to eat, as that seemed demeaning, but Dean solved that when he launched himself, wings outstretched, at the low kitchen table and was able to gain the height and land there. Cas smiled and nodded at this, oddly proud of Dean. And he realized this meant he would probably be able to reach the map table as well, so he went and retrieved what was left of the glass of whiskey, downing it in two shots with a grimace.
Dean's falling deeper and deeper, and Cas is, as always, there for it. Comfort, affection, and more kisses.
“Oh no you don’t,” Sam said as he made to grab it out of the beak, not caring about the risk of another peck or bite. Maybe it was stupid or too sentimental, but that little green army man that he’d put in that ashtray when he was three years old was part of the soul of that car, part of Sam’s soul. He couldn’t let some wild chicken take off with it.
“Your tail’s a little bent.” He watched as Cas twisted around to try to grab the costume piece and straighten it, the shirt riding up to reveal the tiniest strip of cream colored skin. Dean knew he was staring and he just saw Sam drawing closer out of the corner of his eye. He would have to ask his brother where the hell he had found this outfit for the angel. Seriously, leather pants?? That had no right to be hugging Cas’s ass like that as Dean fixed the kink in Cas’s tail before Sam could. His hands were trembling a little, he found, as he narrowly avoided smoothing one of them over said ass. This was going to be a long damn night.
Dean jumped as Cas’s fingers started prying into his ass crack, going where no one had gone before. In one swift motion, the human found his pants cut in half so that Castiel could kick his legs further open. No. There was no way this was really happening.
They settled into each other, Cas’s left hand finding Dean’s right to lock onto tightly. His new ring pressed into the skin between Dean’s fingers, adding another layer of closeness that was new to both of them. The human was damn near overwhelmed and he had to focus on breathing for a few moments in order to attempt to speak.
“Cas -” Dean tried again, attempting to squirm away from the fingers spreading his ass cheeks but with nowhere to go, pressed as he was up against the hard table.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas at the bunker and Cas is enjoying learning about holiday traditions, one in particular.
Cas’s eyes lit up when Sam gave him the passes to multiple zoos around the country.
“I think I do have business here in fact,” he returned, and tried a slow sidestep that would take him closer to the center of the room. Something told him this chick, while she might be powerful, wasn’t a fighter. So if he could just figure out why Cas was stuck...the goddess moved with him, continuing to block his way.
“Are you hungry, Dean?” he asked the chicken, refusing to fully notice how Dean looked disappointed that Cas had stopped and gotten up. He could appreciate that it seemed as if he’d lifted Dean somewhat out of his morose mood over Sam being gone, at least for the moment. Especially as the rooster perked up at the mention of food and trotted into the kitchen, his claws clicking on the old tile.
Castiel rather likes being drunk. He sees what Dean sees in it. The world gets fuzzy for awhile and problems don’t seem to matter anymore. Sam seems to be judging him, but he helps him to the couch anyway. Cas doesn’t quite understand why he is wishing so badly that Dean would sit down next to him, but he knows the man is busy trying to save the world so he doesn’t let himself pout about it like he wants to.
“Write down what you got for info tonight,” Sam instructed as he shoved their things into their bags. “I’ll arrange to have a couple other hunters take over the case. We’ve gotta get out of town.”
He didn’t let himself worry too much until he’d gone and made coffee and surreptitiously checked over the bunker. Sam’s room, bathroom, dungeon, even the storeroom, Cas was nowhere to be found. Of course, the guy had his own life, and it’s not like he had to tell Dean every little thing he did. But he hadn’t left Dean’s side in two weeks now and the suddenness of this just didn’t feel right. What if something was wrong?
Sam glanced around the quiet parking lot swiftly, looking for he wasn’t sure what. The rest of the flock? A chicken wrangler? A candid camera? There was just the rooster, the warm sun, and one more car going by on the road. Sam stared at the bird, who was being very still. The bird stared at Sam, or seemed to, the golden eyes bright and observant. Sam didn’t have a lot of experience with chickens, none really, when he did a quick inventory of his knowledge on them. Dogs had always been more of his thing, cats were also great. But this was beyond him.
Dean swallowed and licked his lips, barely able to hold onto much control currently himself. Cas was looming over him, nestled in between Dean’s shamelessly spread legs, and the anticipation of being able to watch his fiancee as Cas entered him made the coldness of the hard wooden floor pressing into Dean’s bare back worth it.
Soon enough, he heard a familiar set of footsteps approaching and he wiped his face to look up and see Sammy, eye patch now gone, and not meeting his gaze.
“I thought we were gonna - never mind,” Sam broke off. “I need you to come talk to the constable. I have a feeling he knows something he’s not letting on, and I want to question the widow.”
The angel lifted himself to his feet, determined to put these thoughts away. No good came of them. He’d seen people wasting away by pining over others, and though Dean was able to make him weak in many ways, he had to stay strong, so he could continue to protect the Winchesters, and help them in turn protect the world.
The attempt of distraction-by-job, Sam's not totally blind, and Cas misses Dean.
“It’s all right,” he heard Sam reassure the attendant. “He’s with me.” She nodded gently and poured some cola and off brand whiskey into a small plastic cup, handing it to Dean with a slightly more genuine grin. He drank half of it in one gulp, and the nice lady promised she’d come back around to him soon.
Dean worries too much and Cas is being introduced to Christmas television specials.
“Uh-huh,” was all Dean could get out, his own eyes wide at what was happening. Could he really let Cas go through with this? But then his dick was in the angel’s friggin mouth, those lips learning the feel of the swollen head, and Dean was pretty sure yeah, he could totally roll with this.
“Well, aren’t you a handsome fellow?” Cas greeted the chicken warmly. Did the bird just stand up even taller than he had been?
And yes, for those who don't know, chickens can and do purr when they're content and relaxed.
There weren’t just walls around Dean’s heart, there was an armed fortress. A lot of people had baggage that made it hard for them to let anyone in, sure. By the time Dean was sixteen duty and emotions had become almost indecipherable from each other, and by the time he was twenty, duty was king. Take Sammy for instance: he loved his brother of course, but did that mostly spring him from his ultimate job to keep him safe? He was fine with that particular knot never getting unraveled.
It had been an emotional day, and the whiskey from the spiked eggnog was still warming his blood, and aw hell, the real reason Dean’s eyes were stinging was that he was just so deeply in love with and devoted to this angel...he didn’t need or want the excuses anymore.
“Cats are more self sufficient than most animals,” Cas returned. “I’ll get her an automatic feeder. And lots of toys,” he added, holding the kitten up to his face and speaking as if in promise to it. Her.
“I don’t want to move too fast,” Dean explained. “For either of us. But you especially. I want to make sure you’re okay.” It was maybe the lamest and sweetest thing he’d ever said to someone in bed, but even with his body begging otherwise, he meant every word. Cas leaned in close again and a jolt shot down Dean’s very spine as the next words were said through hot lips against his earlobe.
He couldn’t stop thinking about that kiss that was so much more than a kiss, or at least had been to him. Paranoia had reared its ugly head once he started turning it over in his mind. Why did Cas leave so quickly, other than that’s just what he did? Had Dean been too much, even though he’d been trying to be careful? He’d friggin climbed into the guy’s lap without warning. Should he have waited till Cas had initiated more physical contact? Probably. He was the one that had started this whole thing. And if Cas was feeling better enough to teleport again, that meant he had the option of not being at the bunker when the guys got back. That idea was the one he hated the most.
got to get out of town,” he then said. “You didn’t do anything wrong, you should stay and work the case. We still don’t know where killer uncle is buried.” Sam paused in his packing and regarded Dean with that shrewd expression of his.
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” Cas intoned, and never had the words sounded sweeter.
“You really love him, don’t you?” he had the gall to say out loud. Dean gritted his teeth and continued to focus on the polished wood grain of the table. He wasn’t about to answer something so foolish. Winchesters didn’t talk about feelings.
And then Dean was climbing into the back seat, wrinkling his suit, scuffing his baby’s console with his shoe, quite beyond caring. He needed, needed to be closer to Cas. The angel didn’t miss a beat; where most anyone else would have at least looked surprised at Dean’s behavior, Cas just studied his face as steadily as ever as the man came to be sitting in his lap, straddling Cas’s thighs with his own. There was a comfort in that; the idea that not much could rattle Cas, that he’d catch Dean almost no matter what. Of course, he’d been doing exactly that for years already.
Organ music engulfed them as they walked into the church proper. The interior was stunning, all marble arches and echoes, candles and stained glass. It was a surprisingly light filled chasm that could inspire piousness of the most wayward soul. Dean knew they weren’t about to find what they were looking for in the common area. With a nod to Sam and the practice of so many hunts together, Dean slipped down a corridor when the dulcet’s back was turned, and Sam did likewise down another hall.
Cas could have said something, he could have moved away, but he found himself rather honored that Dean was there, next to him on Sam’s comforter. Chickens were social animals, Cas was reminded; Dean must just not want to sleep by himself in his room. So Cas turned the volume down on the TV a bit as Dean tucked his head back on his wing and promptly fell asleep. The angel fought the urge to reach out and feel those rich feathers under his fingers again. Instead he just watched Dean, for once still and peaceful, almost as much as he watched the television all night.
sounded from his person.
Sounds came rushing back to Dean again, mostly the babble of horror from the crowd on the dance floor, crushing close again to see the man on the ground’s injuries, and Sam trying to keep them calm. The music had gone silent some time ago. With one last look of warning, Cas all but threw Dean to the side to go to the blonde man. Dean’s heart lurched at this, and a dread settled into his stomach. He was aware of people staring at him like he was a monster, but nothing was making him sicker to his stomach than the look of disapproval in Cas’s beautiful eyes, and behind that, the image burned into his retinas of the angel’s body pressed tightly against someone else.
Castiel is fascinated by emotions, though he cannot tell this to many of the other angels. He watched what happened to Anna when she got too caught up in the humans’ sentiments. But he tells himself he can stay detached, and just observe. He knows emotions are why these little creatures do almost everything that they do, and sometimes he thinks if Father would bother to pay attention to that, he could take better care of them. But it seems as if it doesn’t matter to Him one way or the other what happens to his creations lately, and Cas has to try not to let this fact bother him. It is not his place to question Father. It is his job to be a good son, and a good angel, and obey. Emotions are not part of his makeup by nature and maybe he's not supposed to understand them.
“Don’t tell me you don’t want this. I may not understand much of human subtleties, I will admit that. But I’ve been around long enough to know desire, and want, and lust.” Cas leaned into Dean, and between the way his voice deepened on the last word and the bulge Dean felt being pressed into his leg, the hunter’s heart turned right over. What exactly were Cas’s intentions?
“Mingling,” he got out through closed teeth, perhaps a little nearer Cas’s ear than he’d meant to. Cas turned to look at him, as did his admirer.
Apparently Cas had kept in touch with, what was her name, ah yes, Emily, and he showed Sam his phone now. Dean, ever the nosy brother, read over Sam’s shoulder.
Dean’s breath was shaky and his body tense as he held himself precariously on the angel’s knees, unsure of how far to go, what his next move should be. If Cas were a random woman, Dean would be kissing his way down her throat by now. But Dean wouldn’t have recklessly climbed into a random woman’s lap in the middle of the day, in the middle of a case. He could not stop staring at the angel, the even dusting of dark hair on his jaw, that Dean had to wonder how it would feel under his fingers; the pulse point in his neck that Dean could swear was thumping almost as fast as his own regardless of Cas’s outwardly calm demeanor; the subtle wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, which deepened just a touch as Cas’s lips quirked upwards in a soft grin.
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” Cas breathed.
“Be careful,” the angel told Sam, who nodded briskly, seemingly not concerned with having to corner the demon who was trying to take Rowena’s new casino away. There was surely no way she’d gotten it by honest means and Sam was going to bat for her, knowing the deal itself was probably on the up and up, as far as demon deals go. But there was no help for it.
What a ride this has been! From a little one shot to 18 chapters, I never expected all of this (Paris, an engagement, Christmas, a kitten named Grace) when I posted what became merely the first chapter. This was my first posting a WIP as I wrote it, and easily my most successful story to date.
“Of course I did. You’re my angel,” Dean replied with the little breath that was left to him. They were both squeezing so tightly, so wrapped up in each other, that neither noticed Sam returning to the doorway and watching them with a warm, easy smile on his face.
“Just find him,” Dean forced out, his current state of stress making any conscious agreement of Sam’s words superfluous. As he watched, Sam’s brow wrinkled at whatever he was seeing on the laptop, then it furrowed, and then the furrow deepened. Dean was about to snap a, “What?” at him when Sam finally spun the laptop around so the screen was facing him.
Cas, perhaps taking the song literally, or maybe just getting a hair up his butt, slid over as far as the console would allow, leaned over it, and began running his lips up and down the side of Dean’s throat. Dean instinctively tilted his head to the other side to allow him access while keeping his eyes on the road. He was a damn good driver and if Cas wanted to mess around, he could still keep focus without too much of a problem. Nice 45 mile-an-hour cruising speed on the way back home, and oh that was Cas’s hand on his inner thigh.
“I’ll be in Sam’s room, watching TV if you need me,” Cas then told Dean as the chicken pecked heartily at the sandwich. It wasn’t often that Cas wanted to escape thinking, at least not anymore, but when he did want to, television was the best way. Dean should be good on his own from here. If he could get onto the table, Cas was sure he could get down, and since it was nearly evening, he’d probably be going to sleep soon anyway with his internal clock set to bird. Cas made sure Dean’s bedroom door was open so he could get into it without hands, and retreated to Sam’s room himself, leaving the door on a crack in case Dean did end up needing something.
“Dean?” Sam tried, his eyes squinting in disbelief. No way.
“So do you have a name for her yet?” Emily asked, sitting down on the floor in a graceful cross legged pose that made Dean’s knees hurt to see. Of course, she and her dork of a boyfriend did yoga together regularly as far as Dean knew. She danced her nails across the wood, giggling a little when the vibrant green eyes jumped to follow those instead of the toy. The pointy stick tail waved in the air after her.
“You know,” he said before his breath ran out on him again, “You’re supposed to kiss someone before you fuck the ever loving shit out of them.” Dean’s heartbeat was in his throat. He wanted to run from the room, even though he still couldn’t, and at the same time, he never wanted to let go of Castiel.
Even Cas, who would have been able to get away with saying he was a tax accountant if anyone asked, had gone all in, Dean discovered as the angel walked out of the motel bathroom. Little black cat ears sat atop his always messy dark hair - seriously, it almost always looked like someone had just been tangling their fingers through it and that someone certainly wasn’t Dean. Cas wore a simple black tee that looked a little too tight on him, which Dean guessed was one of his, and were those pants friggin leather? And of course there was a tail, long and also black, hanging from the back of his waistband. Jeez, it’s not like they were going to a gay club, Dean thought, but he knew Cas wouldn’t understand that remark.
Dean never had the luxury of choices, not the way other people seemed to. Oh, he’d had the illusion of them, like Lisa and Jo most notably, but all that always ended up in was those that he cared about in danger or dead, because of him. He’d given up, he wouldn’t endanger anybody else. But then Castiel came along, and stayed. Cas, who wouldn’t be shaken off, driven off, scared off, beaten off, even killed off. Cas, who had his back no matter what, who’d followed him literally to the ends of the earth and beyond, well after he knew what kind of a bastard Dean was, and he just kept coming back. He was strong enough to survive whatever got in their way, it seemed. He’d sworn himself to Dean entirely too devoutly and in so doing made himself the only real choice that maybe Dean had ever had, or for that matter, would have.
He knew he bumped into a few people on his way to where Cas and this asshole were putting on such a disgusting display, and it didn’t slow him down in the slightest. What he did see, once he got there, like a matador’s flag, was the purpling bruise that Cas now had on the side of his throat. Coherent thought going up in flames, Dean grabbed the blond by the back of the neck, even though the guy was taller than he was, and squeezed for all he was worth.
? Then Dean is placing a bag of fast food in front of him, saying that nothing helps a hangover like a greasy burger, and Cas knows this is Dean taking care of him, and he feels better immediately. The food is odd but not unpleasant. He is more comforted by the fact that Dean is in a better mood today than yesterday, after a successful mission.
Meanwhile it felt like Cas was growing impossibly bigger inside of him and he was certainly slamming into Dean harder than ever. With a low, drawn out cry of the hunter’s name, Castiel came, flooding Dean’s insides, a sensation that had Dean wishing it would never stop. Dean was wrecked, used, and it was all this damn angel’s fault.
The Impala sped up at this, tuned to Dean’s unconscious reactions, her owner only able to keep so much control.
One hand slid inside the stupid suit jacket the guy still had on, and the other dug under Cas’s ribs, and Dean clung on for dear life. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d held someone or let himself be held by anybody; it wasn’t exactly his MO. Cas, though, as in all respects, was different, and so Dean buried his face into the angel’s neck, getting drunk on the scent of his skin directly at the source. With Cas, he didn’t have to be proud, or strong, or duty bound. Cas’s hands were firm against his back, and Dean felt his worries drain out of him, at least for now.
He threw the shirt out and took a long ass, hot ass shower when they got back to the motel, noting that Sammy had hidden the whiskey bottle when he got out. Which he knew was probably for the better.
“They say Dante used to come here, to sit and think,” Sam said, a touch of reverence in his voice. Damn nerd.
Dean caught the unsure glances sent up his way every so often, though, so he did his best to offer some direction. It was mostly along the lines of, “Oh, god, that. Right. There. Fuck,” and, “Yeah. Suck it, just like...Ohh.” But he was able to give some constructive criticism every once in a while, such as, “You can grab it too, don’t be afraid to...oh god,” and “Wetter, please, make it wet...fuck.” Dean was having all he could do not to move his hips, not to overwhelm Cas, not to take hold of his own cock and help jerk himself, knowing his lover wanted to learn.
Sam swore, as he shoved his last pair of somewhat clean jeans on and tucked his pistol in the waistband, clipping his favorite knife to his belt for good measure. If Dean was still asleep wrapped around someone, Sam would give him hell. He opened the door to the motel room and ran a hand through his bed head hair. At least it was a nice day, the bar Dean said he was going to wasn’t all that far, and Sam had long legs.
“Where are you guys travelling to?” The young man sitting in the row ahead of them had twisted around and wanted to know.
“Stay focused,” Sam warned quietly, always able to tell when Dean’s horn dog tendencies were surfacing. What, he could appreciate a nice body was all. And it would be just too easy to get laid tonight; everyone knew Halloween was an excuse for people to be a little sluttier than they usually were.
“DEAN,” another voice commanded, and another set of hands grabbed him tight. These arms were clearly not taking no for an answer, and they were the only ones that Dean could not struggle against.
“Devotion,” he read the engraving as if it were a sacred text, and Dean released a sigh of relief that it had turned out right while his heart swelled with joy at hearing that deep voice speak that word. There was a matching ring that was burning a hole in his pocket, and Dean brought it out now, silently asking Cas to slip it on him.
Thoughts of ending up as some sort of ritual sacrifice after all jolted through Dean’s brain and he began to twist around to face Cas. Maybe if he was able to look him in the eye he could figure out a motive, or if he was possessed suddenly or something. But he was barely able to catch a glimpse of that unsettling blue before he was turned around forcibly again towards the table, both shoulders in a vise grip now and the warmth of Cas’s body too close behind him.
“You bastard,” he shot, but the insult lost some of its heat due to the still breathless quality of Dean’s voice. The blue eyes that he was glaring into were dark with sated lust and examining him as if he were a foreign galaxy. It seemed the angel had no comeback, regardless of how many words he’d had not that long ago.
“Cas…” he started, trying to figure out how to word his upcoming arguments in a way that his lover would listen. But the angel was not even going to let him get that far.
“Can you track his cell phone?” Dean asked next, with a nod to the computer that Sam was staring at. A quizzical brow was crooked his way.
He didn’t let his bleary eyes search for light until he’d hit the last step of the staircase, and though he did see a glow coming from the hall off of the library, it was the cozy scent in the usually masculine air of the bunker that caught him off guard. Chocolate? Sam and Dean exchanged a curious glance and wordlessly made their way towards the kitchen. The rich smell got stronger, and Dean had a flashback of his mother having hot chocolate ready for him when he got home from preschool on Fridays. He was very young, barely four, and would often ask for it on other days but she was adamant that it be a special treat.
So there was an apple pie and a six pack of Dean’s favorite beer under the tree with bows on them, and Cas beamed with cautious pride when he told Dean he’d made the pie. Sam gave a wink at his brother over the angel’s messy hair, suggesting that he may have helped some. Between the two of them, they weren’t quite helping Dean’s newfound resolution to eat better.
Layla. Maybe. The Stones had Ruby Tuesday. Good god, no, any name but that. Angie, though, that could work. Mmm, too casual somehow for her. Lodi, from good old CCR, likewise Suzie Q. That could be cute. Ugh, none of them wanted to fit.
“What?” came out, too sharp. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Dean restrained his foot from leaning into the gas pedal more than a touch. There was no outrunning this, but it was still his instinct to try.
But now here was Cas, standing up and taking his place by Dean’s side again and, casual as anything, leaning over to smooch his rough cheek and catch his hand in his. Their fingers slotted together naturally, muscle memory established already, and Dean couldn’t help answering the grip with a squeeze of his own. Maybe...just maybe, tomorrow was suddenly worth considering.
It all makes sense now: the irregular heartbeats, the constant concern for him, the loneliness when he hasn’t seen him for awhile, the longing for his attention, not that he ever has to wait long. Castiel has fallen in love with Dean Winchester. Well, he had wanted to know what it feels like to feel.
“Is that good?” Cas asked huskily, and Dean had to breathe a laugh onto the end of the shaft that he’d been just about to wrap his lips around. Only Cas would ask that.
The angel was not crushing him, though he was yanking and tearing, his hands everywhere at once, and Dean only realized what was going on when it was almost done. The room air was cold on his bare skin for a moment, and then it seemed to heat up, and he wasn’t sure if that was from the shame of being unexpectedly naked or if Cas was doing something to heat the air.
“Just tell me how I’m doing, okay?” Cas requested, and those gorgeous eyes locked on Dean’s from where they were hovering above his groin, and thank goodness breathing was an automatic thing, because Dean would have forgotten how to.
“I’ll try,” Cas promised with a tight nod, and Dean impossibly fell even a little more in love with him. He then reached down, past his own straining erection and heavy balls to take hold of Cas’s deliciously firm cock. It was going to be inside him again, was all Dean could think excitedly as he guided the swollen head to his tenderest of places, silently telling Cas he was ready. His other hand was on Cas’s left hipbone, and Dean adored the way that even though it was the angel fucking him, he was more than willing to allow Dean to take control.
“You haven’t seen Cas, have you?” The words came out tighter than Dean meant them to. His brother barely glanced up as he shook his head.
The Winchesters had just taken out a whole vamp nest in one afternoon, and yeah, sure, Sam conceded that Dean deserved to celebrate a little. But they were supposed to be heading back to the bunker early in the morning, to keep working on a way to get Mom back from the British Men of Letters. She said she was hunting with the bastards lately and that it was her choice, but her boys had their doubts.
