Cas spent most of the weekend observing the easy banter between the family. He had never lost some of his awkwardness, was still reserved. Some behaviours once learnt never left. Foster care had taught him to lay low, avoid attention. In Cas it had led to a shy and somewhat odd demeanour that some people struggled with. He didn’t make it easier for those people. It was not his responsibility.
The remainder of the evening passed in a blur. Everyone wanted a photo of Dean and Ben. Dean’s face ached from smiling by the end of the evening. And somehow he had lost track of Cas.
Pamela walked up and slapped him on the arm. ‘So that gorgeous hunk is what that angel who scorched me all that time ago looks like?’ Dean snorted.
Dean got mad. Thought Cas didn’t want Claire in his life, started making plans for them to move out immediately.
Once he had recovered his cool he joined Claire in the kitchen. ‘Not that I don’t love having you around more, Dad, but what’s the plan? I mean long term?’
Surprisingly they sit down at a booth without a second glance. They’re towards the back so Dean slides off the sunglasses but keeps the cap on, ducking the brim down when a waitress approaches.
Finally reaching some sort of agreement, Cas and Dean break eye contact. Cas strides across the room, stopping a few paces in front of John. ‘It is,’ he pauses, ‘interesting to finally meet you, John Winchester.’
Cas rolls his eyes. ‘His surname. Not Winchester? Is that a stage name? Are you going to be a Campbell or Winchester?’
‘Sam,’ Cas says his name like a lifeline. ‘This is Dean’s wife. Lisa, this is Sam, Ben’s teacher.’ Sam holds out his hand with a smile. Castiel stands still unsure how best to continue. He’s never been good at this.
Looking back on it, that was the point when things started to go wrong. Cas didn’t trust Dean to not find someone like her again who wanted to rip what they had apart.
After stowing the bag, he climbs into the car next to Cas, pulling down his scarf slightly to reveal a very full beard and scraggly hair poking out from under the hat. Cas notices striking green eyes peering under the peak of the hat.
The air at the lodge was frosty over Christmas, and not just due to the snow. Dean couldn’t work out what was up with Cas. He was glum and snappy. Even Claire was barely managing to get him to snap out of it.
He thought of Sam as the little brother he’d never had. Cas, well Cas was something else. He couldn’t put his finger on it. His best friend, even though he’d only known the man briefly. Something about them just clicked immediately. Cas was nothing like his public image. He was weird and dorky and had a great dry sense of humour and knew little to no pop culture references (Dean was teaching him, don’t worry). Dean found everything about the man fascinating. And it seemed Cas felt similarly. He chose to spend as much time as he could with Dean.
‘I just can’t put my finger on it.’ Cas gave Claire a warning look. She seemed to understand all of a sudden.
‘I want to relax, enjoy my life, not run from project to project, all around the world, never having a home base that feels like home, you know.’
By the time Cas arrived half the bottle was gone. A few others had partaken with Dean, but it had mostly burned its way down his throat.
‘He also has you. He’s never spent much time here, but since meeting you, it’s like he never wants to go home.’ Sam laughs, then turns to Cas, serious face on, ‘He’s talking about buying an apartment here, making it his home base. That’s on you.’ Cas blinks. Sam smiles, ‘You help him to see positives in a lot of things. Lighten his load. You’re very good for him. More than you know.’
Dean doesn’t look up, he can’t. He ignores the warm grip on his forearm. Cas tried again as Dean gathers his bag and thoughts. ‘Are you sure you wouldn’t like to have a drink with me?’
‘Cas, wait, you don’t understand, I didn’t mean….’ But Cas was gone, his bedroom door resolutely shut.
‘Your daughter sure can sing Cas!’ Balthasar yelled over to the sofa where Cas and Rowena were huddled over glasses of wine.
He feels a warm gust of wind and looks up to see Cas before him. Dean launches himself to his feet and grabs Cas, pulling him into a bone crushing hug. Cas hugs back, but pulls away quickly. Dean can’t let go of him, but Sam and Eileen are frantically questioning Cas about their son.
Dean wound down his window. ‘Don’t forget your lunch sweetheart.’ Passing a bag our to her. She grabbed at it. She turned round and gave him the finger, he let rip laughing. He gunned the car and pulled out of the parking space, chuckling to himself.
He laughs as he buries his face into her hair, like father like daughter, breathing her in. They stay like that for a few moments until Claire remembers her friends.
‘Some party Gabe asked me to stop in at. It’s at your hotel. I just need to show my face then I’m done.’ Dean nodded and carried on walking. There was a moment of silence between them as they waited for a car to pull round.
That’s all it took. All of a sudden it was like time was rewound and the intervening five years hadn’t happened. The weird silences and awkward body language were gone. Within minutes they were both cackling away, reminiscing, talking about Sam, Claire, everything.
Dean was outside throwing around pieces of the gazebo they had been deconstructing. Claire knew better than to go and speak to him.
They settled back into a routine with one another easily, albeit Dean was waiting to ask Cas about the article. He was curious about the one who got away. But more than that, he wanted to be a shoulder to cry on, to support his friend.
‘In the morning.’ He paused, might as well get this over with. ‘Actually, I’ve been meaning to say to you. Uh, Benny and I have been kinda seeing each other.’ He held his breath. She looked at him. ‘That ok?’
He was collecting his key as he heard a commotion behind him and saw Cas entering the building. The blue eyes met his instantly. Dean was stuck, like a deer in headlights, unable to move.
‘He is. Technically. Just chooses to use another name. Some bullshit about me affecting his career, blah blah.’
‘Dean, if you wanted your home to be with your parents it would be. If you don’t, it won’t be.’ He nods, taps the bar with his knuckles and heads out.
‘I’m sorry Dean, I wasn’t suggesting...’ but Dean has crossed the space between them and starts kissing Cas.
He goes to collect Dean from the airport when he arrives for a visit. It’s their new tradition. They get to spend some time together just the two of them catching up. He’s not sure how it happened, it was just mutually agreed between the two of them and Sam somehow that he would always get Dean.
‘Nothing. It’s easier that way. My work is everything. But I’m always hopeful I’ll find someone to spend my life with.’
But Claire does send a message to the group chat offering her house for the evening of the prom. Everyone is very excited, especially when they hear Dean is likely to be there too.
Dean looks at him in confusion. ‘And then I come home and you tell me you don’t think I look at you as boyfriend material. That’s true.’ Pain flickers across Dean’s face.
Without them noticing, the rest of the Roadhouse has cleared out around them. There is a feeling of anticipation in the air.
He tried to speak. Found a tube in his throat stopping him. He tried to move. He couldn’t. The machines started beeping wildly. Sam jumped up, doctors and nurses flooded the room.
‘Yeah, I mean they’re all pretty starstruck. But I had to tell them sometime. This way it was quite fun. They know about you, too, by the way.’ She laughs, ‘expect to be cornered by Beth when she next comes over. She wants to find out your secret identity.’ Claire snickered.
‘He’s coming early, before Jack and Sam tomorrow, said he wants to spend some quality time just us. Said he’s seen enough of the other two, some health kick they’re on, said it’s driving him up the wall.’
‘Sam’s right, I know he’ll have taught you a lot, but you can’t possibly get what it’s like in a place where Chuck has control like that. You’ll need someone with you, someone to protect you.’
‘Yep, definitely.’ She crosses her arms. He begins to laugh, a proper belly laugh. Sam looks across at them, a grin on his face. He loves seeing his brother like that. It doesn’t happen very much any more. Not since they left.
Cas is following the exchange with ever growing confusion, apparent in his squinted eyes and tilted head. Bobby and Ellen smile, eyes glinting, from the sofa by the fire.
He began the opening lines. Cas couldn’t see Sam on the stage anywhere. Suddenly he appeared before Cas.
‘I love you too.’ Came softly from Dean’s lips. ‘That’s why. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I tried living without you. I can’t.’
He replays the evening in his mind. Dean had insisted on paying because he had, in his words, dragged Cas out with him. Cas isn’t used to people being friendly without an ulterior motive. He doesn’t think Dean has one. Dean hadn’t even been looking for Cas yesterday. It’s very rare he makes new friends. He has to stick with the PR strategy his team dreamt up. In the states it leaves him very little option to meet new people he actually might like. He can’t remember when he made a new friend. His others all predate his fame or are in the industry, and honestly aren’t really true friends. He doesn’t usually let his guard down and trust new people. Somehow Dean is different, has already got under his skin.
He senses Cas before he even speaks. Maybe it’s his scent. Perhaps it’s a noise, a rustle of fabric. Or possibly it’s just an extra sense just for Cas. To know when he’s near.
The director, a British man by the name of Crowley, takes the stage and introduces the film. He asks Ben onto the stage with him.
‘I’ll be along soon. With Eileen.’ Dean smiled warmly at his brother and pulled him in for another hug. He wanted to hear all about their life, from both of them. He got in the car and drove back to The Roadhouse.
‘Ok, enough chick flick moments, let’s get this show on the road.’ Dean climbs into the truck and turns the engine. He plugs his phone into the stereo and turns up the volume, blasting AC/DC.
Dean smiled but it didn’t reach his eyes. ‘You know I never thought I would end up like this. When Claire was born I could never imagine living apart from her. The fact that she barely ever stays with me is so unbearable that I can’t even think about it.’ Cas could see the pain in his eyes.
Dean got up and started ushering Ben upstairs to get him ready for bed. He was surprised when Lisa joined him. She read Ben a bedtime story (Dean didn’t have the heart to tell her that usually it was the other way around now) and kissed her son on the head before saying goodnight. Dean was waiting at the door when he heard Ben mumble, ‘Missed you, thank you for coming to stay.’
On the ride back, Ben’s excitement reaches its peak as he chatters incessantly about all the stuff they’re going to do. He charges into their house and whirls around showing Sam and Jack things without a breath.
Cas smiles, remembering the way Dean used to fuss round him, Claire and Jack, being a protective mother hen. He nodded. ‘He’ll make a good husband to a lucky woman one day.’
Claire had an event after school and wanted to drive herself. She didn’t know how long it would go on for and her argument, which Cas thought was reasonable, that it would make most sense for her to drive herself home.
‘Thank you Becky. I need to sort some things. I hope you have someone who can help you through this.’ Becky nodded silently as Dean ushered her out.
She watched as Cas clearly argued with Sam before taking a seat at the piano. The camera pulled back to see Dean’s reaction as Cas started singing. She saw surprise and confusion register, before Dean turned and didn’t take his eyes of Cas for the rest of the song. The audience reaction was nothing like the reaction in her brain.
‘The last person I dated was a studio set up. She wasn’t interested in me, just getting some press. We slept together and I woke up to her taking photos of me, naked.’
It made sense, he supposed. He was still surprised at Claire’s comment. Dean decided to leave the coffee and headed upstairs deep in thought.
‘I imagine it was yes, so nice that your dad could make it too.’ She eyed Claire who simply nodded. ‘He wanted to make sure I had a good time.’ Mrs Harvelle gave her a warm smile before walking off.
That got Dean’s attention. He hasn’t heard from Cas. He’s tried calling and texted every day. His messages haven’t been read. His calls unanswered. He wants to clear the air between them but needs to do it in person. Apologise for the misunderstanding.
‘Red for me. Can you make a recommendation?’ Castiel looks up. The waiter is clearly star struck but gathers his thoughts quickly. ‘We’ve got a delightful St Emillion, heavy cherry flavours. Or if you prefer something lighter a Pulgian Primitivo?’
‘Charlie!’ Dean scooped her into a hug, ‘digging the Star Wars t shirt. I don’t think I could love you more!’
Cas and Jack’s door is ajar when he goes upstairs. He stops outside and sees Cas sat on a chair, book on his chest, head slumped. Dean creeps inside. He picks up the book and covers Cas with a blanket. Not much he can do about the chair, he’s going to have a sore neck in the morning.
Then Dean spots a headline on a gossip magazine while out shopping for groceries. ‘Castiel Novak engaged?’
Cas visibly relaxes, ‘Yes. I will call Sam.’ Dean runs up stairs while Cas is on the phone. Sam promises to be there as soon as possible.
The lights dimmed. The piano and soaring electric guitar gave the slow dancing couples in the middle of the dance floor for more than a quintessential high school experience.
With a sigh Cas got off the bed and slowly descended the stairs. Dean was stood in the hallway, he hadn’t showered or changed after the concert ended, as he customarily did. Cas also noticed the clock in the hall read only an hour after the finish time. Dean had come straight home.
It feels like barely any time has passed on that bridge, Sam looks just like the brother he always knew. They hug, pleased to be reunited.
While Cas may not be a nervous flyer like Dean, he still gets to the airport early as he likes to plan ahead and adhere to the rules. As a result he’s left to twiddle his thumbs as the checkin desk isn’t open when he arrives.
Cas blurts out a laugh, ‘I could never play in front of an audience Dean. That’s for you and Sam. It’s not me.’
‘Well well, what do we have here Cassie? Your latest boy toy? Moving up in the world I see.’ He gives Dean a once over.
‘It’s ok, I’m getting special Cas vision. He’s sent me up with a direct video link.’ Sam looks baffled.
Games night becomes drinking games night. They decide on Trivial Pursuit first. Claire complains about not getting her own beer while Dean feeds her sips from his. It’s not that sly.
‘Mmmm yes!’ Dean gulps down the scalding cup placed before him in moments. It helps him gather his thoughts.
‘I am Michael’s perfect vessel. In the same way that sam is Lucifer’s perfect vessel. It’s what yellow eyes wanted, what it was all for. Heaven wanted it too. We destroyed their game plan, or thought we did. We both said yes eventually, just not at the same time.’ A flush spread across Dean’s cheek. How could he be so stupid. He was just a pawn all along.
The rest of Ben’s filming goes without a snag. It’s soon the final wrap on the film and Dean is packing up their temporary house. It’s ended up being more like 9months than the initial intended 6. He feels different from the dejected man that arrived at the start of the year. He’s feeling, well, if not positive about the move back to be with Lisa, optimistic, no that’s not right, hopeful, yes that’s better. But he’s still a cynic. Lisa said she wanted to try. He would give it a go. But he was worried. Would they be able to reignite their spark? Time would tell.
He’ll never stop being Dean’s friend, but Cas just needs a little bit of distance. He needs a distraction.
They are quiet for the rest of the journey, but it is comfortable. Neither feels like they have to say anything more. Dean is mulling over the things Cas has said to him.
‘Dean.’ Cas voice forced Dean’s attention to his face. ‘I could not imagine a higher honour. You are a wonderful man. My best friend.’
That’s normally what happens. This time, Benny is out for smash and grab, as much of Cas’ as possible, no strategy, but effective brute force tactics.
After a few days he was fed up. He got up and headed over to Sam’s house. Jody was off on a work convention so she wasn’t around to distract him. If Sam wasn’t needed with Jack, he hoped Sam would be up for keeping Dean company.
‘Yeah we could do that, I’m not planning on touring so much so I can definitely block out her holidays to make sure she came come home with me, if she wants to of course.’
A week later Cas wakes up to a series of beeps from his phone. He sees 10 messages from Dean. Some of them are single swear words. Some of them are his name.
‘Well, Friday or Saturday probably. Got a show in Oregon on Sunday. And I promise to cook for the rest of the week, spare you Cas’ dangerous attempts in the kitchen.’
‘Well, I’ve been 16, I know I’m not going to be able to stop you. At least I can make sure you have decent stuff!’
“Oh, very, very good,” Castiel chuckled with delight. With this he moved positions so he was kneeling behind Dean.
“Huh.” Now Dean looked more impressed. “And that was how they got into that museum back in Houston to steal those angel gadgets,” he concluded. “Did you manage to get back the amulet and Stick of Destiny too?”
“Helping me, when Metadouche – er, I mean, Malcom, was being an ass. That guy's had it in for me since I was twelve and I threw up on his shoes. They'd put me and Sam in a room full of candy and had just expected us to leave it alone. We were there all day doing press for our first film, and... well, children, no self control,” Dean shrugged.
, exactly what Dean had been looking for. It was, Dean had to admit, another action film, but the action took place in the Amazon. It was about saving the last of the rain forest, set in a universe where all but a small section had been destroyed.
“As an average, for six of you having cum, should be about… 22 milliliters, I think?” Dean didn’t even try to pretend he didn’t know average load amounts.
On Dean's second to last night in town, the two had caused something of a sensation around downtown when they decided to go out drinking together.
“I was guessing,” Castiel shrugged. “But I look forward to finding out for myself if the rumors are true.”
hard last night. Dean wondered if the press had caught him and Castiel making out on their way back to the hotel.
“No,” Castiel smiled down at him indulgently, cock still moving silky-smooth and oh so very fulfilling.
Unsure what to do with himself, Dean traveled back to see his folks for a little while. He told them the film had gone well, but production had been so troubled he wasn't sure if it would ever make it to release.
The day before his 91st birthday, a reaper had appeared to help Dean with his journey to the afterlife.
True to his word, he then proceeded to vomit all over one of the supporting actors, including his script. Bits of puke remained in his beard as security dragged him off muttering and mumbling to himself.
“Pizza delivery driver? It’s a cliché for a reason. And unlike the plumber fantasy, the delivery driver isn’t going to cost you a mortgage to call out
“You’re still coming tonight, right? Mom invited you?” Dean was oblivious to the quiet freak out Sam was having. “It’d just be nice for you to get to know Sam.”
"Yeah, yeah I got it," he confirmed. “Place I interned at during freshman year spring break taught me how to use it all.”
Seeing how happy Sam was in his new environment, Dean couldn't help but feel proud of his brother for stepping out of his comfort zone and doing something different with his life. No part of Dean had ever been resentful for Sam wanting to stop when he did. Dean in fact had felt a little envious at how easy Sam made living in the real world look.
“I phrased that badly. I mean, an object that is somewhere between red and pink. Though, it is good to hear you understand that system.” Castiel’s voice was full of pride.
“You?” Sam’s voice was thick with disbelief. Castiel looked more like a… a librarian, or accountant or… something. Not a soldier.
Castiel's writing output had never been higher since he’d started limiting his pizza deliveries. He suddenly found himself just brimming with ideas.
They stopped for the evening six hours into their drive. Despite the U-Haul on the back, Sam made it in just before Dean had.
“Cool,” Dean said, like it meant nothing. “You might want to keep that from Mom until you’ve settled on what you do wanna do. Experience has taught me she doesn’t take too well to these things otherwise.” Dean turned to grin at Sam.
Castiel studied Sam’s face again. He seemed to have a thing for that, just looking and trying to find answers. “That sounds pretty risky. Plus, if I use handcuffs, I always have the key and a spare nearby. No need for lock picking.”
Having a pediatrician as a boyfriend was the greatest, Castiel thought to himself. It allowed Castiel to feel calm too, in a way he never had before he’d had Dean around.
"I'd like that," Dean beamed up at Castiel. "That is some impressive bush you have there," Dean said as he stroked a hand over the surface, feeling the lush foliage of Castiel’s primroses.
“Sex is mostly about the physical sensation to me. But you wanted to talk, I don’t see how talking about my sexual antics is helping.”
“Absolutely! She said it is important for group bonding,” Donna explained getting out of her seat. “Come on guys, we've all been sat here on our own for long enough.”
“You show me how to do that and I’ll show you how to get a plastic army figure out of a child’s nose without them crying.”
“Last one there lays eggs!” Sam shouted suddenly, taking off for the wooden rope ladder acting as the only route of access into the tree house – at least for those without the ability to fly.
“We got no idea either,” said Dean. “That they overpowered Cas as well? Something’s up.” He looked tired, but Sam could see beneath that was the level of exhausted Dean achieved when he was
“And anyway,” Donna turned on Benny again. “The aunts died in film six. How could they do a spin-off?”
John’s illness and subsequent surgeries, repeated hospitalizations, restrictions to his lifestyle… the whole lot. It had taken its toll. He’d seemed on the mend the last time Sam had seen him alive.
Dean hadn't intentionally sat besides Castiel at the restaurant, nor later at the bar they ended at, but fate (or their co-stars) seemed determined for them to spend time together.
Stomach full of food and heart full of peace, Sam went to bed happy that night. Which was why he was so surprised that he felt so awful the next morning, almost like he hadn’t slept at all. One night of good times apparently wasn’t going to cure him of the melancholy taking over his soul.
“Teach a man to fish in a state of permanent nighttime, and he can provide for himself the rest of his life?” Dean guessed.
Dean stuck his tongue out in automatic childish retaliation, not thinking about how Sam couldn't see him do so.
“I am helping – emotional support is very important.” He punctuated his sentence by tossing up another peanut. Sam crossed his arms and watched judgingly as Dean choked for a moment on the peanut. Dean coughed and spluttered, rolling forwards and coughing harder again until the nut moved.
“It wasn’t hard, I just called them and ordered it. I didn’t think you’d want to drink tonight so,” Dean shrugged. “Not that you have to open it tonight, enjoy it whenever you like” he rambled on.
Sam laughed despite the sadness in his heart. It was a hollow feeling. He didn’t know in that moment to voice the love for his brother he had. Despite everything they’d been through, despite the fact they’d basically ignored each other for most of their adult years, Dean had still driven out to help him pack up his stuff.
“They discovered that someone stole my original screenplay and now another company is making it.” Chuck explained to the others.
“We’ll start with bubblegum and reassess at that point. If everything goes well, we will then proceed onto apple. You may ask for me to stop at any point, no safe word today, just tell me stop.”
“Are you still willing to do my yard work and clean my pool?” Castiel had to ask, had to be sure of Dean’s motivations.
Dean had spotted Becky in the crowd as soon as he'd found his spot at the table and settled down. With a pit of dread in his stomach, he knew without doubt she'd be the first one magically picked for a question.
It wasn’t the most traditional of beginnings. But then what was traditional about the story of an angel and the human he’d once rescued from hell?
“Yeah well, if I’d told Jess a little sooner what my feelings were, I wouldn’t be limping towards 40 without a roof of my own over my head or any idea on what I wanted from the future.”
“Hannah wasn't either, if that makes you feel any better. She'd have lost her job if she didn't agree, and I'd have lost money for the charity. We're going to do so much good with that money, you have to believe me.”
Sam smiled sadly at Castiel, looking weary in a way Castiel hadn’t seen since before Chuck had died.
Do not see this movie. I went hoping to give Dean Winchester a fair chance to show he's more than just Sam Winchester's older, less good looking brother. If anything, I learned he's
Dean couldn't help but instantly like Charlie and Ash. They were warm, funny, and obviously crazy as all hell for willingly getting involved in the film.
The future was a big, nihilistic unknown, but the present? The present was being warm, sated and happy together.
Instead, they managed last moment to get a director. Gabriel Plaisantin was welcomed on board. He was known mostly for directing commercials, but must have known some deep secrets of the studio bosses to get his first movie directing gig be film with as big of a budget as
“I…” He studied the stranger. He looked like he might be a little older than Sam was himself, dressed in a tan trench coat and three piece suit.
It wasn’t the most conventional moment to realize he was in love with Dean, Castiel reflected, but he wouldn’t change it for the world.
“Your eyes roll back a little when you orgasm,” Dean said with a sly grin, forever fascinated every day at the new things he was learning about Castiel.

"You’re right," Dean conceded. "We can research the children, but the world isn’t ending right now. I can’t wait to do this all over again. Actually, thinking about that, how will you know when is the right time to come back? Did the others tell you?”
“I do not do nudity,” Anna repeated in firmer tones. “I'm sorry everyone, but I cannot be a part of this.”
“The world would probably implode,” Sam joked darkly. He felt though like someone was squeezing his throat as the emotion built. “Thanks, Dean,” he choked out, feeling such a rush of gratitude and love for his brother. Emotions tinged with some regret that he’d held Dean at arm’s length for so many years.
He microwaved his leftovers from the night before as lunch and ate that while contemplating in vague terms his presentation for the interview on Monday. He might not want the job but he needed to shake off this persistent fatigue as quickly as he could. Having a goal, having a place he had to be at a certain time, having a
“We both need to appoint deputies to take over some of our duties and make a promise we’ll all spend more time together. The universe has changed over the years, granted, we haven’t changed that much though, Sam. We still need each other. We’ve just lost sight of that lately.”
Amazon,” Bela further explained. “So we're going with a sort of generic rain forest. Chuck is still working on the details for that.”
“Well... that would make sense with the whole closing line,” Castiel replied slowly, looking equally puzzled by what they'd just watched.
“Hell yeah,” Dean laughed, slapping a thigh. “They had this apprentice once at the garage. Dad sends him out to buy tartan paint. Dude was out for six hours before he had to admit defeat.”
Sam sat down next to Dean on one of the couches. Jody clearly entertained enough that she had so many seats free.
“That’s okay, sweetheart. It’s my fault really for buying it for you.” Dean stroked the child’s hair so gently. “How about your dad helps you clean up, and I’ll make some special tea for you? Get that tummy feeling all better in no time at all.”
“How about I take your bed for the night, Dean, and you two stay in here and talk like you clearly need to?”
He felt the mattress dip a little under him as Castiel got on the bed too. He crawled up towards Dean and then proceeded to simply stroke Dean's back in a soft, soothing motion that sent shivers up Dean's spine.
“Probably because I've spent most of my life around adults. Sam, if I'm honest about it, was really my only friend growing up who wasn't over 18.”
Leaning down so he could whisper into Dean's ear, every now and then nipping and licking the shell of his ear, Castiel started.
By the time he himself had hit 21 and Sam had just turned 17, the boys had stared in seven Jones Brothers films. The premise for all were fairly similar. The brothers (playing brothers), defeated evil while somehow making it through life.
“Cas! You’re, um, back early.” Dean scooted his chair further under the table, only further proving to Castiel what he had already assumed.
“Yes, whatever, one of those?” asked Fergus Crowley, another actor Dean had been keen to work with upon signing up for the project.
Sam made a noise of acknowledgment but otherwise was preoccupied in burrowing down under the blankets.
He wasn't sure why he felt like he had to tell Castiel this. They were in the middle of sex already.
“We've got the best people in this cast, and I personally have never felt such a strong sense of camaraderie in before on a film set.”
“What do ya think?” Dean asked Sam later as he pulled out of Jody’s driveway, the Impala’s engine roaring perfectly.
His tongue felt stuck to the inside of his mouth. So not only would this be a massive flop, but it was going to be
“I don't... I don't do this much,” Dean mumbled, as they both paused a moment to get used to the feeling of Castiel deep within Dean.
Sam took a deep breathe. “I got this,” he agreed. If only because he didn’t see that he had any other choice. “And Dean?”
“Dean's been a delight to work with. He's brought so much to the role. My co-star has taught me a lot about the profession, as have all these kind actors on stage with me here now.”
Castiel ran his thumb along Dean’s lower lip and then slide it into Dean’s mouth past those luscious lips. Dean happily sucked on the offered thumb, always happier to be sucking on something when given the option. He wanted his mouth full more frequently than he wanted his ass full.
Dean started to moan again. The sound of Castiel’s breathing so close to his ear driving him just as wild as the sensation of Castiel’s delicious cock sliding in and out of him, making him feel so good.
“I've never had my balls waxed before,” Dean could hear Garth saying. “Huh, I wonder if I'll like it.”
Castiel huffed out a laugh. “I used to be in the military. And I promise you, as a kid, that was all I ever wanted to do.”
Sam’s expression dropped. “Oh.” It had been just over thirteen years since their dad had passed away. “Yeah, of course.”
“Yup,” Dean smirked. “Sam and I stayed in regular school through the first and second films, coming back when possible so we could be normal. But soon... well, our life was just too different from the other kids. And it was getting awkward fitting the travel in. Mom pulled us from school, got us a tutor. I started enjoying learning a bit more after that.”
“It was my fault too, I should have made him leave it in the kitchen. I was just distracted by you being here and…”
“We'll prepare you for that as well, don't you fear! Given some of the, ahem, rumors that have been spreading about this production, we wanted to cap off filming with a press conference, just to assure everyone things are fine.”
They decided it was for the best if they said their goodbyes at the hotel in case any cameras were at the airport.
Castiel looked at Dean unblinkingly. “Isn’t it worth the risk? Of all the dumb risks we’ve taken over the years, isn’t this one worth it?”
“Sure, yeah, that would be good.” Dean had no beer at his place and since Sam hadn’t been out he hadn’t drank in… he wasn’t even sure.
The battery on Sam’s laptop had died a couple of hours ago and he’d meant to get up to plug it in but time had gotten away from him. Time spent watching some shopping channel with the sound off. Zoning out on the smiling hosts while pretending everything was wonderful was easier than trying to figure out why he didn’t feel like he wanted to practice law anymore. School, grad school, internships, days, weeks, months of not sleeping, the debt (oh the debt), so he could achieve his dream. And suddenly there he was at 35 years old, sleeping in his brother’s spare room, questioning where he’d gone wrong.
“If your morning was anything like it was when I appeared here as Six, you’ve already had your share of fun today,” Castiel Seven argued back.
“That's fucked up, man. Fucked up and oddly... sweet.” Dean shook his head and let out a low growl. “But it does finally explain everything. I've felt so
“You know,” Dean started as he chewed his pizza. He took huge bites, Castiel knew already. Dean’s cheeks would squirrel out, almost like Dean just liked the sensation of his mouth being full of something hot and moist. “I’ve got a question for you.”
“But?” Dean added, stomach suddenly dropping. Oh. So maybe this was going to be the part where he was thrown aside. He shouldn't have been so surprised. Just in the heat of things the night before it felt like maybe this time would be diff–
Castiel ruled over Heaven and Sam over Hell, and yet Dean was still being screwed over by both sides. They had to keep him alive, had to keep him in the bar to keep the balance of the universe whole. Because neither Sam nor Cas wanted to lose Dean, and that was the only other option they had.
Dean put the back of his hand up to Jack’s forehead. “He doesn’t feel hot,” Dean told Castiel. “Do you feel sick?” Dean asked the child.
Slowly all the actors decided the best place to go. A couple of calls were made to invite members of the crew various people had befriended. It was probably about as close to a wrap party as they were going to get.
“If I had told you straight up my last name was Winchester you’d have worked it out.” Sam wasn’t going to let Castiel blame himself for something they were both a part of. “Is it too much to hope you have two best friends?”
“25 milliliters?” Dean guessed with a smile, eyes glazed with lust. His math abilities peaked when it came to three things: weapons, auto-mechanics and orgies.
“Does it matter why?” Castiel pressed, voice still eerily calm. “Why does it matter who the hell I sleep with?” It was a challenge, clearly.
Castiel studied Dean’s backside, trying to decide what he could take. What both of them could take. If their hearts could handle trying this and the potential of things not going well.
“I taught myself to pick a lock from a YouTube video once,” Castiel admitted. “I’d locked us all out of the house.”
“I was in New York for four years at one point, my sister was at college there and I ended up hanging about.”
“I’ve waited so long to be the one in this position,” Castiel Ten sighed, happily thrusting his hips into Dean’s mouth.
Even though he didn't know the language, he still somehow felt like he made friends with the cast. Castiel remained firmly at his side, helping him communicate, introducing him to the small company of actors, all of who Castiel knew well.
It was only a bottle of apple cider, but it was a bottle made on an orchard Castiel used to visit as a child with his family. He hadn’t been able to go back in years and vaguely remembered telling Dean just once how much he’d missed the taste. Being a single parent was amazing, and he wouldn’t give it up for the world, but it hadn’t left much room in life for traveling like he did in his own childhood.
“It is real. Everything about my grace tells me this is real.” Castiel had done extensive self-reflection. As his strength grew, he pawed at as much as the universe as he could, trying to figure out if there were holes that pointed to this all being a self-contained dream.
Sam agreed with him. “I woke up one day and everything just felt off. Like it wasn’t my life and my skin itched because nothing seemed to fit right. San Francisco's been great and all but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life there.”
“Gonna be a hot mess. If I don't take the work now while I can, offers are going to stop coming, and I won't have a choice in if I want to keep being an actor or not.”
After a couple of days of being a bum at his childhood home, Dean traveled on to see Sammy where he was holed-up in New York studying. He spent his days at Sam's fancy apartment reading while the kid was in class, and their evenings playing video games – when Sam wasn't studying, that is.
The restaurant was nice, and decidedly not the sort of place John would have picked when he was alive. Each of them had taken it upon themselves to dress up appropriately for the occasion. Castiel was still in a suit, as he had been so far every time Sam had seen him. Even Dean had combed his hair back and put on a tie.
Crowley, Tran, and Talbot seemed like a tough company by reputation. Being interviewed by the named partners was novel, but given the size of the firm shouldn’t have been such a surprise to Sam. They weren’t any different to many of the lawyers he’d dealt with in the past. He’d felt confident and in control batting down their questions, and even earning himself a nickname before the hour was out.
Sam joined in with the laughter of the others. Feeling very content to be around his family, and also sick that he’d probably ruined a happy future for them all before they’d even had their entrees.
“You bake them?” Dean was suddenly deadly serious. Sam wondered if this was his tone for interrogations too.
“No! No, nothing like that,” Castiel said, interrupting Dean's thoughts about how disappointed his parents were going to be. “Hannah's my sister.”
“I... was thinking we'd just get room service?” Dean suggested with a wince. “Not because,” he added hurriedly, “that I don't want to be seen with you. But it can be a bit of a pain in the ass going into public with me sometimes.”
“After you do this,” Bela was quick to interject, “you are free to go. We have the press conference organized next month to introduce the first teaser footage to selected members of the press. There will be a quick q&a session. After that, we need you from November for press, and then the movie premiere end of the month. But no more filming,
When he still hadn't had a call from the studio asking him to go back to the film, Dean decided to make his next stop his Uncle Bobby's place.
Neither of them was asleep, content to revel in a semi-lucid state, just happy with the comfort of being next to each other. It was never guaranteed that there would be a next time for moments like this. They’d both agreed that instead of worrying over the future, they’d just live in the present and do what they could to be together when they could control it.
He was stiff from all the packing and the focus on getting things done. It felt surreal locking the door up and hiding the key on top of the door frame. He wouldn’t have normally ever done that, but given the apartment was empty, and this way he avoided a last awkward goodbye with Jess, he was prepared to let it slide.
“They've engineered it all. All the disasters, even down to Chuck's original script getting stolen.”
“Well then I need you to not come so you can fuck me into oblivion after this shower. If that's good with you?”
"Magic? I can't do magic." Or rather, he probably could, but didn't want it at the cost it came with. Sam tried his best not to remember the feeling of power he used to have with the demon blood in his system.
Sam blinked and looked at his glass. It was somehow empty except for the quickly melting remainders of ice.
“I'm shooting a few episodes for a TV show up in Vancouver,” Donna started. “My agent said it was best to get in and try and establish myself better before this film, you know, drops,” she finished with a sad sniffle.
“I've never spent all that much time in Canada. Sounds fun, we should make some bookings to look at houses in the area.”
Castiel was already sat at the bar as Sam walked in. He had his head bowed and looked to Sam like he was close to slamming his forehead on the wood repeatedly.
Dean wiped the grease off his fingers with a paper napkin. “It’ll get better. You’re scared now because you don’t know what’s coming. You’ve defined yourself by your work for so long that’s gotta be scary too, just quitting like that. But I’m here for you, Sammy. You ain’t doing this alone. Life isn’t ever perfect. We always want things we can’t have,” Dean’s eyes flicked briefly to the couple cuddled up in a nearby booth, “but then again, we are the Winchesters. If we ever got everything we wanted–”
He was pale beneath the sheen of sweat, with scruffy black hair and a nose that had been broken a good couple of times.
Dean was soon lost in the sensations and couldn’t track which Cas was where and how many of them had cum in him.
“Been starving your baby brother there, Dean?” Donna winked at him and Sam smiled, mind slightly panicking that she was flirting with him. He wasn’t ready for anything like that.
Dean examined the plant before him. So healthy, so strong. "No problem. I've been told I’m good at handling
He paused before he undid any further buttons, just taking in the sight… and maybe trying to tease Dean a little.
Besides the fact they were not filming on location so that the film could retain its self-proclaimed environmentally friendly credentials, half the people he was meant to be acting with were currently made of little green balls on sticks. He thought he'd actually be working with all the cast together, however, it turned out that because of the special way they had to film the humans playing the centauricorns, the humans and centauricorns all had to be shot separately.
A lot of the kids who had been young when they started making Jones Bros films were of college age now and desperate for photographs with the two. They didn't mind stopping to take hundreds of photos so long as the good times continued to roll. Hell, it was a bit of a boost to his ego, and Dean needed that after the weirdness of the film set he'd come off.
“Hey, listen up!” Jody was the one who had made the noise. “Since we're finally united, how about we all go out to dinner somewhere? Since we won't see each other again probably until the press tour?”
At least the press they'd done already, no one had seen a full version of the film. But after this, there would be reviews.
Dean felt a jolt in his stomach when he heard a knock on the door. He got up to open it and was greeted with a hug from all his assembled family members.
Castiel looked deeply into Sam’s red-rimmed eyes. After a moment of study, he seemed to accept what Sam had told him.
He dropped his underwear fully to the ground to reward Dean’s continued honesty. Dean’s cock had drooped a little but was happier once Castiel was on the bed, crawling up towards Dean. Castiel positioned himself over Dean so that he could take their cocks into one of his hands and stroke them together. Dean, meanwhile, continued to hold onto the headboard.
“I’m not joking,” Bobby shakes his head. He seems more present than he did before. He huffs as he scales the stares, leaning hard on Dean for support as he does. His words are punctuated by the effort to climb up and are uneven with every footfall. “When you first arrived here, and insisted on doing a full day’s work, even though there was no call to. I never asked. You just did it. What, you thought you had to earn your keep? Prove yourself? What was it?” He asks. Dean swallows. There’s a knife at his throat.
favourite,” Novak answers. Dean’s guts twists. He isn’t sure he has one—Christmas is a time so wrapped in pain and grief for him. What could he sing, that wouldn’t destroy him? Perhaps Novak did well to choose a lament. He settles on a song which was always Cassie’s favourite, heart panging in a motion remarkably similar to that when the shepherd began singing.
Dean swears above him and in the next instant Castiel is sat up, cool hands are pressing at his too-hot head, watery, concerned emeralds peep at him from behind thick, brown, damp lashes—and is Dean crying? Why is Dean crying?
Sam shrugs. His shoulders are sloped and Dean realises he must have barely slept. Must not have slept, at all.
Another grating silence. Castiel resolves to look at the trees flitting by outside of the chariot, too.
As the moon begins to wane, and the Angels have stayed in Hera for near a quarter of their time, Sam and Ellen finally manage to push Dean into dancing during one of the feasts in the Dining Hall. They push him more literally here, than figuratively—Dean thinks he catches Castiel laughing at him, much to his own chagrin.
“I’m not,” Cas shakes his head with a laugh, looking back up. “King’s college has cows in the fields behind it. And there are a bunch in the fields on the way to Grantchester, still near the town centre. The town centre being King’s, to me.”
“How do I say it back?” He asks, pressing his palm flat against Cas’s and slotting their fingers together. Castiel glances down and smiles at the familiarity and warmth held in the simple gesture; and his eyes flit back to Dean’s, almost shrouded in disbelief.
put on you, because of all that stuff. Love shouldn’t be a burden. I shouldn’t have made it a burden. I’m sorry…”
“Sure,” she nods. Sam appears through the door of his bedroom, and spotting Dean talking with Eileen, pulls a sheepish expression.
“The Novaks are coming round for dinner tonight,” she kneels in front of Dean, still holding Sammy. “So you’ll get to play with Castiel some more, then. Is that okay?”
Castiel scowls, but as he does so, Dean appears at the end of the row, awkwardly looking for a way in. His eyes are a little red.
“That’s good,” Dean hums. He snaps the ends of a dead branch in his path. “I think it’s foolish. I don’t even want to be king, anyway: Sammy could have my crown in a heartbeat, and I wouldn’t care. I’ve seen what power does to us, and it isn’t noble.”
And however much Jael did not fear death, knowing that beyond it—no matter how prolonged or painful death was made, Abra waited to welcome each of her children back into her arms—they
thing 5: thank you to all the lovely friends who saw me and supported me, who sent me reactions to the story as they read it, who affirmed me when i felt scared about what i'd produced or down on myself and what i was writing. you are the redemption of a vulnerable act and an often toxic space. i'm so grateful for you, and all the lovely readers, who made this feel worthwhile. thank you to my dad, who i miss. you are, all of you, often in my mind and always in my heart.
“Christmas Eve,” Cas states. “And my name on your lips was a more welcome gift than any other I could think of.”
Presenting these to Castiel is downright mortifying: the entirety of the Heran nobility seems to be present for the ceremony, all the Angels who came down with Castiel, the royalty from all the Earthly Kingdoms, even from Dione. The whole hall is wreathed with vines and adorned with blossoms, early evening sunlight pours through the windows and splashes everything even more multicolour.
just saying. Anyway—when Jimmy said all that stuff, I knew who I wanted to live it out with. Of course I did. So I told him—I said I wanted to marry Cas.”
Dean grins at her, but she pulls a face back, getting up and takes Elanor off Dean. “I’m confiscating her,” she says, matter-of-factly, “until the two of you stop being gross.”
know,” Dean shakes his head. “But I don’t care any more. You know? I’ve realised. What’s the point?” He huffs and sits down, next to Castiel, who cannot help but stare, wondering.
of them,” Michael corrected himself, ashamed of the way his voice trembled. “Why did I have to choose? And why did I end up with neither?”
be successful. But do it anyway. The world needs art, and art can’t be made for profit. I don’t mean that at all in the sense that we shouldn’t pay for art, or support artists: but there have been poets and painters and filmmakers who have made things for money, and something raw in the soul of their work is lost. The audience can tell. I mean, they’re making a movie about
Balthazar was right when he called it one of the gayest songs out there, apparently. Well, a man was most definitely singing it for a man.
“I don’t really think of it in that way,” he confessed. “I—I have never wanted the world beneath my feet. Only ahead of me, around me.”
“Yes!” Castiel shouts. “We have had—and continue to have—our own problems, you know! But apparently, you’re too self-indulgent to realise it! And I don’t know if that’s you, or all Humans, but the assumption that at any given moment, Angels ought to be ready to jump down from our home in the mountains and help all of you, is—”
to each other, the fact that Dean’s head was rested on Castiel’s chest only moments beforehand as both of them rested in the dim starlight.
“I mean, talk to me once the shock has worn off, and we’ll see how I’m feeling,” Dean smirks, glancing up at her. But, at her worried expression, he says, “I really don’t mind, Claire. Or—it’s hard to phrase this right. Obviously I don’t want you to make a habit of this. I don’t want you to make a habit of a
“C’mon,” The Human tugs at Sam’s sleeve, but the younger boy does not exit just yet. Dean’s lip curls, but he storms back into the Great Hall, not looking back. Samuel looks at Castiel a moment with his big, hazel eyes, the worried expression gnawing at his features a moment.
“Well, thank you both—and congratulations. It was such a beautiful wedding. And we had such a good time, right until the last moment.”
“You—you kept it,” Dean says, soft and sad, hands shaking. “You—I thought I’d lost it, forever, when I abandoned it—abandoned
There are voices in the living room. Dean glances up and down the hall. A mirror, cracked in the corner from when Dean and Castiel were racing down the stairs and knocked it over, hangs to his left. The crack seems more like detailing than anything else, strangely beautiful in a clear, silver shape, a smooth line contrasting the faded gold of the mirrors frame. It rings with memories.
“Did he?” Ellen asks, beaming. “That’s awfully sweet of him…” She smiles down at Dean as he rests. “That’s very sweet,” she repeats, softer this time. Her eyes crinkle at their corners, shrouded by silvery tears. “He and Sam have been like sons to me, I suppose. And brothers to Jo.”
Balthazar calls him, all excitement and smug vivacity, the next day. Castiel had been convinced—or rather, wildly hopeful—that it was Dean calling him again. He tries not to sound too disappointed when he realises it isn’t.
“It’s really me,” Castiel confirms, and Dean shudders at the sound of that voice, body ringing in a crescendo of relief and delight, and the awe of a man kneeling at an altar. God, it feels like he’s waited for eternity.
“She had your chart right in her hand,” Dean points out. “And hey—you and me both: Dean Winchester, burnt out, 27, not had a long-term relationship for 9 years, depressed, daddy issues, heavy drinker, plays guitar in a dive bar—”
Castiel waits by Dean’s side like that until the Prince awakes. Several servants come in to tend to him while he sleeps, redressing wounds and soothing hot cloths over those cuts that have reopened, and on multiple occasions Ellen enters the room and insists that Castiel gets some rest, or food, or both. But the Angel politely refuses.
The jade-eyed Human wears minimal amour—he has only been training, after all. Dean isn’t wearing a helmet, nor a breastplate, although he does don a boiled leather shirt, along with a gardbrace and pauldron on one arm. The other is left free, probably for ease of mobility.
Over the years these tattoos have grown in number; his anti-possession tattoo and a couple of music tattoos Castiel doesn’t understand; a tattoo to match the names he carved into the bunker table,
He hears his name ringing in his ears, and he wants it to be his Angel, but he looks up and sees Sammy with arms wrapped tight around Dean’s body; Sam is crying too, and every time Dean sobs that he
did. It was like the dawn. There’s a reason I called you Sunshine, all those years. There’s a reason I still do.”
Three weeks have passed since Castiel last saw Dean, on the final day of shiva. Mourners dwindle and the house seems to deflate, visits lessen, the walls grow further apart and the bricks which form them settle neet and tight and unyielding. Castiel wonders if he actually
“Dear brother,” she presses her forehead to his and gazes earnestly into his eyes. “If Abra has willed you and Dean, then you will be. If not, the world will continue to turn, the birds continue to sing, the stars to shine, and I will continue to love you so dearly that planets will be born in the night sky the same shade as your eyes.”
“Let me be,” Dean growls. Still there is no sign of dark scruffy hair, oversized black coat, scruff of stubble. Dean frowns.
burns?” Dean asks the doctor, who frowns, confused. “Mr Novak’s. Have you looked at his hands? They need tending to, as well.”
“A few days. Not to worry. Hera will have its outrageously young and inexperienced King back, soon enough.”
“I mean,” Samandriel clings on all the tighter, a note of urgency slipping fretfully into his voice, “that I want you to stay.
Dean gestures, lip trembling, eyes unfocussed on a point just below Castiel’s jawline, to where he’d been looking, out the window. Castiel follows the motion and sees the sign he’d all but completely forgotten about in the chaos of the night: ‘FOR SALE’. It stills him for a moment. He turns back to Dean.
“Oh,” Dean steps back in disappointment, this time. “Well… Yeah. I’m at their engagement party. It’s—it’s the first time I’ve seen any of them for… for…” But he trails off, unable to finish. Castiel sighs softly.
“So you could, uh,” Dean fumbles, “if you want—I mean—obviously, you don’t have to, and obviously, there aren’t any expectations, just—if you wanted to stay, and talk, or just—even just sleep—I mean it’s been six
A billow of black and silver smoke barrels round a turning to their right, and separates them, twisting and twining and curdling into the figures of a dozen Demons, and among them, Lucifer, Uriel, Zachariah—and one who must be Metatron.
“That leather hood, in your hand, Mr Davies,” Cas sighs. He glances back to Bobby. “This hawk has a broken leg,” he says seriously.
“Called it,” Gabriel grins. It breaks the silence. Most of everybody laughs. “That’s twenty dollars you owe me, Michael.”
that,” Dean bites out, and is surprised by the tears in his eyes. Castiel steps forward into the room.
“He breathes,” Castiel does just this for effect, breathes theatrically in a deep, growling kind of way, just as a dragon really
All of them know that something in the air is broken, stagnated. The sound of cutlery on plates rings a little too loudly and Dean doesn’t know why, but it takes him nearly half an hour to stop wincing every time he hears it. But it’s nice—weird, but nice, and Mary gives them gifts and they give Mary gifts and something about it, though stilted, is acutely familial in the yellow light of the living room as they sit and unwrap. Her gift to Dean is not at all unexpected—when he was a kid, every Christmas or birthday he was guaranteed something musical from Mary, because she knew for sure that was what he liked. This year, in being a process of rebuilding, Dean guesses, she’s gotten him something harking back to a time of investment in Dean’s hobbies, even if it was always the safe bet, never requiring that much thought or engagement. The equivalent of her present for Sam, this year, for example—a massive pile of old books he gets stupidly excited over. Mary’s present to Dean is a violin—and, to be fair, he doesn’t own one, and has always wanted to learn.
The High King trembled, which was the truth. He could not, and never would hold the child. The boy felt, strangely, not even his to hold.
Castiel who Dean still watches as he reads, devours, book after book on lazy autumn afternoons, same line of a frown perched over his brow which has now developed into a permanent line on Castiel’s face, a furrow Dean likes to kiss and run his tongue over, graze with his thumb while they’re lying in bed, heart soaring. Castiel who Dean loves to give cooking lessons to, who is slowly getting better at not burning the butter or forgetting about the milk heating until it scalds and bubbles over, Castiel who Dean loves to watch clumsily chopping onions, particularly when they make him cry, Castiel who teaches Dean about plants and, while gardening with him, will take Dean’s hands in his own and sweep soil over the roots of something just planted, and Dean will relish the dirt that ends up under both of their nails and the roses Castiel will bring in to stand in a vase in the kitchen.
It’d be pretty fucking ridiculous—and ridiculously selfish—for Dean to turn around, now, and tell Cas he’s actually been in love with the guy all along. Then what? Cas would be torn between his old home and his new, his old loves, his old friends—and that’s assuming Cas would take it that kindly. Maybe he’d be fucking
Castiel whittles away the next few hours by poring over Dean’s letters to him—he hasn’t told Dean this, but he’s kept every one of them. They write often, and in the hours where Castiel finds himself pining for the Human’s presence, they hold something of a comfort. He wonders if Dean has done the same.
The blood-sea sounds all through the talks. Zachariah is more vocal, this time; Castiel raises eyebrows to his sister who seems troubled by the agenda he pushes. Zachariah seems intent upon using Dean as a weapon in the war, now.
,” Dean groans, exasperated, picking up his cell and jamming his thumbs onto the screen dramatically as he glares at Charlie. “You happy, now? I’m texting him. Are you happy?”
But Dean is laughing too much. Castiel’s protests, and his accusations of bullying, even his attempt to knee Dean in the groin, are all either dodged or met with laughter.
knows the truth about Dean and Cas. Well, Anna and Jo obviously know. But that was kind of inevitable, and Jo knows Dean well enough not to pry or make a big deal out of it, and Anna isn’t the kind of relative who’d rock up to you after figuring or finding it out, lean in close and say,
Growing distracted by trees and kingfishers and the contented bees around, it was nearly sundown by the time Mary ventured back to the castle, in the end. The sky had cleared itself considerably, just as Mary’s bad mood had dissipated in the presence of the forest, and now, as well as having hundreds of wildflowers woven into her hair, Mary also had stuffed as many mushrooms as would fit into her bag, having scattered the remaining cake for the birds to eat, and nibbled on a little herself. She had found a leaf larger than her face with all the colours of green, red and brown composing its surface, and a handful of blackberries so ripe that they were delicate to the touch, threatening to burst with dark, sugary juices, and were a deep enough purple-black that they seemed to soak up all the colour around them.
Then Dean shares more information about Protest Music, passing around handouts for the class, talking excitedly and bantering with each of the students. And then, returning to the front of the class, he turns to his students with a much more serious expression, and explains to them what it is they’re about to listen to, what it’s about, and why songs like this were, and always will be so important. Then, through the speakers at the front of the classroom, he plays Nina Simone’s
The kettle is switched on and Dean is thankful for the rumble it provides, only slightly distracting from the awkwardness of the figures stood and sat in the kitchen. Jimmy has his back to Dean as he gets out a cup and teabag and Dean can’t help but wonder what he looks like. His face is stoic, Dean imagines: professional, polite. Not betraying the hurt he feels toward Dean on behalf of his son. Or maybe not? Maybe Jimmy glares at his teacup; wishing it was Dean and that he could melt it with his gaze. Maybe he scowls with all the fury in the world of a rightfully loving father. Maybe he blinks away tears at the sting of Dean’s betrayal.
The dog seems very pleased at the touch. It bows, before jumping up again, nosing at Castiel’s leg for more attention.
since their fight. And now that they have the chance, Castiel is giving short, curt answers and brushing past Dean as though he’s nothing more than a stranger? He and Castiel have never fought for so long: ordinarily the shepherd’s forgiveness for Dean’s impulsivity and hotheadedness comes almost immediately. Dean had assumed that this time would be like any other. Apparently he was wrong. He starts up the stairs again, scowling.
“I am not long for this world,” she said, and Michael approached with the drink, pressing it, hot and unearthly, into her palms. But she shook her head and, with unsteady hands, placed it on her nightstand. She was almost too weak for even this. How would she give birth, tomorrow? She could sense it coming, the beating of a death-drum.
He trips. He trips, and trying to catch himself, instead catches his hand on a bluegrayblack and jagged rock. A
“You’re very kind,” Dean says. Cas’s expression is dark, which almost makes him smirk. Alastair looks at the shepherd for the first time.
Samandriel approaches Castiel—another thing which would be considered unusual in the Human realms—and smiles in a friendly, travelweary manner at him. While Castiel is in his home in Evadne, he has very few people to actually
So Castiel does. And in the nights that follow, Dean will follow him as his wings unfold and, once Castiel’s body has unfurled from itself, Dean will climb up into one of his palms or wings or beside the crack of his chest, or onto the lion face or in the lion mane, claiming how warm and soft it is, and sleep. And Castiel will lie still staring up at the sky, listening out for enemies beckoned by the beacon of Castiel’s trueform, listening to the evening out of Dean’s breathing, listening to the breathing of Benny, uneven with wakefulness and hurt and thought.
No. No, this is not where he comes out to his father. Not while he’s lying, heartbroken and drunk, on the cool marble of his bathroom floor, unable to hold back a sporadic stream of tears that leave his eyes without warning and with both impossible, mortifying ferocity and trembling melancholy.
“If he’s home for the weekend, it’d be better if we just let him come in,” he sighs. “Otherwise he’ll annoy me
Adam is in the kitchen standing over a steaming pot, with Ellen hovering over him, smiling instructions at him.
“Um—” Dean’s voice is cracking in his throat. Cas makes an impatient sort of noise, but Dean can barely think. What gets him off, when he’s thinking about Cas, during those few times when he can actually get some
hard on gifts and gestures for all your birthdays, but,” Dean quirks a smile, “so worth it. For one thing, nobody would think they could hold a candle to me, after that. They’d be like, ‘nope, Castiel is very obviously in love with Dean, no way in hell I can compete’.”
“Cause a community college degree doesn’t lend itself to fame and success,” Dean answers, rolling his eyes.
“I’m under no illusions,” Dean tries, “no illusions that I had an easy upbringing, or that things were as they should have been. But you know better than most. You said it, one night in the Croft. Tragedy rarely strikes once, and only once. My father was a broken man, when my mother died—”
going to give her, not when it’s pie. Cas smirks, because recently Dean has taken to indulging the dog of her every whim and wish, which is part of why she’s taken to coiling on the bed at their feet as they sleep. Part of why—maybe all of why. But Dean is absolutely not sharing his pie with the creature. It’s been too long since he last had it. Cas sighs happily upon his first mouthful, and Dean beams, heart an opening flower.
“I’m fine,” Castiel repeats, shaking his head. He blinks confusedly in the cool night air. “I… fell?”
When Gabriel knocks at the door, Castiel shuffles behind his father’s legs and decides he feels much safer, hidden, here.
“Right,” Dean nods. Something in his heart pangs at the loss of contact. Is he that cold, that the desire to renew it is so great? “I wonder how it’s going. I hope they haven’t done anything to Adam’s snow fort. He was proud of it.”
“I’ve told him not to rock the boat,” Mr Penryn shakes his head. “He says it’s easier not to do so when you are paid enough to feed you and your loved ones, let alone keep a roof over your head.”
Castiel peers at his boyfriend. Samandriel’s eyebrows slope upward with worry and his hands are tugged out of Castiel’s to twist and fiddle with one another. A bitter cocktail of pity and guilt surges through Castiel, and he stands, taking hold of Samandriel’s hand again.
to say whether I love someone, or not…” Sam mutters bitterly, his eyes flitting pointedly yet meekly away from Dean.
“That’s very similar to what Dean said,” Castiel chuckles, his eyes flicking over to Dean’s face, which immediately reddens.
“What, you’re telling me you don’t have sex, now?” Dean asks, still trying to pry himself free from where Castiel has him pinned.
“Just trying to impress my angel boyfriend,” Dean quirks a smile. His jade eyes flash with a teasing warmth. But Cas’s insides clamp up at the word.
And it’s true. But maybe, once upon a time, Castiel had hoped beyond all hope that Dean wasn’t straight. And maybe, that hope beyond all hope had translated itself into a belief that Dean
The city is a sanctuary for travellers, merchants and traders, as well as those fleeing from their past for whatever reason. Frankly, Castiel feels as though he is doing the same. Toward the top of the gates, and divided equally between each of them, lies the golden emblem of a phoenix, wings spread wide apart on either side of it as it gazes down at Castiel with fiery eyes that ought not to seem so passionate and animated considering their stillness. Golden carved flames surround the bird, and seem to ripple off the image, their tongues winding their way in spiral-like patterns around the entire body of each of the gates; Castiel is thus forced to remind himself again that there is a very good reason for all the Angel Kingdoms being renowned amongst the Earthly Realms for their architecture.
“Who would you see?” Dean asks. Castiel frowns. “Who would you see, if you revisited the caves. You say—the one who loved you most, the one who ought to have loved you better, the one you have loved most. Who would you see?”
“As I said,” he says, softly, “you won’t believe me all at once. And, you know, I can’t blame you. I can still barely believe that it’s a love you return. But it is a love returned. A perfect circle.”
Claire giggles and confirms that she can share her breakfast with them. They all sit down. Claire is still crying, eyes smudged with tears and makeup. Maybe it’s just the light, or the occasion, or the emotions of the day. But for a moment, Castiel thinks Claire carries some kind of unknowable resemblance to him, to his father, in the flash of her bright blue eyes as she smiles at Dean and passes him some of her breakfast.
Bobby enters and greets a few of the chirruping birds before sitting at the head of the table, leaning his canes beside his chair.
died four years ago, I’m—” Castiel cuts himself off and balls his fists. “John died four years ago and even if it had been more recent, grief doesn’t excuse the way Dean acted—”
He looks mortified that Castiel has caught him and Lisa making out quite so passionately—Lisa’s legs are still wrapped around Dean’s body, Castiel’s eyes burn, Lisa glances up at him and offers a small smile which he can’t bring himself to return.
The four Earthly Kingdoms—the nations in which humanity dwells—are mainly surrounded by the mountains. Three of the four are completely encompassed—these are the kingdoms of Hera, Eofor, and Corinna.
start bouncing, and it makes Castiel laugh, and Dean giggles, giggles as though he doesn’t quite know what Castiel finds so funny but he wants to join in and he’s happy to be here, playing with Castiel.
He does this increasingly. Calls the man Cas. It’s easier to shout across a field in the early mornings as greeting. It’s faster to say when asking for help or to be reminded of how to prepare and cook food for their meals together. It makes them feel closer together in the low firelight when Castiel is leaning over the book with Dean, helping him walk out sentences like the rising of the sun.
Dean’s breathing doesn’t even out for many hours. He lies curled on his bed shuddering as he was when he thought he was about to die at the hands of men who hated him for kissing another man. He lies shuddering and can’t stop and won’t leave his room, doesn’t, can’t. It grows dark beyond the windows and when he finally returns to himself he realises that it must be well past midnight, and that the others at the Eyrie must have eaten dinner and assumed Dean would be dining with his shepherd in the Croft, as he usually does. He swallows. His mouth tastes sour. His hands won’t stop trembling, and he’s lightheaded. He’s covered in a thin and cold sweat.
The words are bellowed loud enough that the panes of the windows rattle. Adam blinks, stunned for a moment, eyes shining, before turning on his heel and running down the corridor.
“She would’ve,” Dean nods. He squeezes his father’s hand on instinct, and then wonders if perhaps this was a mistake.
Dean’s cheeks tighten a moment, sour with regret. He doesn’t look up at Castiel, only watches the rippling waters.
“I like it when you’re close to me,” Dean says, eyes shining, because again, the want is twining round his bones and making him ache. Cas lifts his head from Dean’s shoulder with a soft expression.
“We need to tell Michael,” Is all Anna says, her throat dry and rough. “We need to summon him here, right now. I’m sorry Castiel—but these are matters far beyond our capabilities.”
“By the river, today,” Dean starts, and finds it difficult to swallow. “You seemed to think—think that I might find some way—some way away from you, as if I ever could.”
want to look out for you.” Dean looks vaguely comforted by these words. “And your parents love you. They ought to be acting for your interest, always.”
he shuddered these words out like a prayer. “You have held my heart from the first, do you not remember? Be not inconstant to this life, be not inconstant to
“Can’t believe my own little brother’s not a virgin anymore,” Dean beams, and accepts the light kick Sam offers him in response to this.
“Do you think Mary’s noticed my car’s still out there?” Dean asks with a nervous laugh, a thrill of worry flashing through him.
“I loved your book, by the way. The poems. Dean always talked about your writing when we were going out. Said how amazing it was, how amazing you were. He was right. He always talked about you. I guess I should’ve paid better attention… I guess I should’ve
This admittance comes coupled with a spasm of hurt up Castiel’s left side at the thought of how possible it was that he could have lost Dean.
“It seems it,” Novak cracks a smile and hooks his finger, fishing out a lot of disgusting looking substance from one of the lamb’s mouth and throat, when it begins coughing.
“I’m not hungry,” Castiel says, looking down at his hands. They seem older than he remembers. And yet, it seems so unfair that Jimmy died when Castiel was so young.
Dean comes round that evening with Sammy at six thirty. Dean’s eyes are red, and he doesn’t speak much. Sam looks worried and speaks perhaps a little too much to make up for it. They eat dinner, play a game with Castiel’s dad at the table, talk for a little while, and help him tidy everything away. Dean and Castiel do the drying, Jimmy washes all the pots and pans, Sam brings all the things from the dining room table to the kitchen. Fairly soon after this, Sam goes up to bed in Gabriel’s room, Jimmy handing him a book to read.
King Victor gave the usual speech—about it being such an honour to host the Heran King and his men, about how glad he was that the pre-established trade-routes would continue under new rule, how fortunate the earthly kingdoms were to bear witness to such a young and valiant ruler of the most powerful kingdom in all the Earthly Realms. He reminded John of their kingdoms’ shared heritage and language, and then prayed out to the ‘Mother and Father Gods’—whoever the fuck they were—that the years of John’s rule would be kind and peaceful and that
“Oh…” Ellen still seems a little confused. Cas has stirred and embarrassedly fumbles for his shirt, which also came off, earlier.
“Yeah,” Dean beams. All his chest knows is wonder. “I guess Chuck didn’t get everything. I mean, maybe there’s people he missed, you know?”
feels rude and unfair of the shepherd, but Castiel doesn’t seem to agree. As with everything, the shepherd is steady, patient, in these lessons. Like the earth. Novak points out, repeatedly, that as a man of the soil himself, Dean ought to know the inherent patience and trust in the act of planting a seed, smoothing soil over it, and waiting. Slowly, Dean’s hand falters less over each letter he mimics in his notebook, slowly he feels less as though he is uneasily drawing them out, copying their shapes, but is rather transferring from one book to another some meaning, like two rivers meeting and deepening, or a stream branching and parting.
was our family. It caused this massive rift. Half of my mom’s family were on our side, half of them on Zachariah’s. But it was all too much. And—and the house that we
“What’re you guys celebrating?” Dean asks nervously, with an uncomfortable smile that puts Castiel ill-at-ease.
“Don’t be dumb,” Dean rolls his eyes, holding an old paint can in one hand as he climbs the ladder to his and Cas’s treehouse.
a plea to keep Dean safe, the river that runs through him has both its source and its returning point in Dean. Strange, that in the scorch of hellfire, Castiel found every tide of love.
“How could you tell?” Dean asks, and almost laughs with how ridiculous the old man is being. “You couldn’t see her, until you came down here. You
the destination is what’s most powerful: Dean’s descent into panic turns out to be even worse than actually arriving there. He wakes up a couple of hours after he and Cas must’ve drifted off, and in the interim they’ve drifted away from each other. He wakes gradually with a building sense of panic until his eyes are opened by the pounding of his heart, and maybe this gradual process was prompted by Cas shifting his arm away from Dean’s body, but the distance between the two of them now mimics the distance between Dean and Calm.
Dean’s words are filled with a burning need, rasped out through a tight throat, rough and heavy with desire and restlessness, but Castiel
to go downstairs, to the old piano he used to practice on, and play out several chords and notes in partner with the music, singing cautiously. And then, when he’s happy, he picks up his old guitar and tunes it again. Many of the strings have grown loose with time, and dust coats the instrument’s neck and body, making Dean cough as he plays out the chords and weaves them into something complex, and, Dean thinks to himself, surprisingly beautiful.
Dean bites the inside of his mouth and pores over the blunt letter for what feels like an age. His gaze snaps up to the door when he hears a soft, confident knock at it.
Eventually the anger in Dean’s chest is extinguished, perhaps by the pinch between the shepherd’s brows or the way he bites his lip when focusing. As his anger mutes, his shame grows. His face heats, a hot itchy heat which grows across his cheeks and makes the chair he sits on feel hard and uncomfortable. He stands, and Novak looks at him.
“You gonna make Cas that coffee, or not?” Sam asks, tone infuriating. Dean scowls at his brother but turns to pour Cas a cup.
“Just—I guess it’s a reminder of who we were, when we knew each other. Nothing will bring back images of your past self like talking to someone who—who still
“But they started it,” Dean mumbles, and bites down on the urge to flip Castiel off when he sees the Angel smirking at how childish Dean sounds.
“Yes,” he admits. “I would use this opportunity to read from London to Edinburgh, but I’d always get distracted when we got further north than York… the landscape suddenly becomes this wild and beautiful and mystical thing,” he smiles, looking back at Dean, who, dammit, is
“How many years do you have, Mr Winchester?” The shepherd asks. “Surely enough to cope with a little stinging.”
“No,” Dean glowers, and leans back again, withdrawing. “I just think it’s strange, that you’d spend all your time with me, and not trust me with—”
does Michael not remember how emotionally compromised he was by the location, last time?—but his older brother barely registers his words, and Zachariah smiles sickeningly at Castiel from across the council table and says the matter is settled.
“All is forgiven, Dean,” Castiel tries, and the words hardly make it past his lips. Not because he doesn’t mean them. Because he means them, too much. “Always, always forgiven.”
“It hurts, doesn’t it, Mikey,” he says, blood lobbing from his mouth. “You sound bitter. It hurts, doesn’t it?”
“Hello,” she nods to Dean, something in her eyes telling him that she knows at least a little of what went down between Dean and Cas when they were eighteen, before Cas left for England. “You know you can let yourself in, right? That’s sort of how this works—”
“They absolutely did,” Cas chuckles, reaching out to ruffle his niece’s hair. Mara’s eyes crease up and her nose wrinkles.
God, now Dean can see Cas’s muscles, unhidden by a damp shirt that clung so sinfully to them in the rain; now he can make all of them out, their rise and fall, their firmness and how they fold over each other like waves down his arms. The boy Dean fell in love with all those years ago is a man, a grown man, with thick arms and broad shoulders and how the
“Yes, I’d like that,” Castiel confirms. His eyes regard Dean with a new and unfamiliar kind of gentleness.
“I guess, because of a lot of things, it might be hard to describe what that relationship is—what that relationship means to you, you know?” She asks, looking over at Dean. Dean frowns and puts the pan down, becoming suddenly, strangely, acutely aware of his hands. “A lot of things—sorrows, trials, barriers—might make that kind of friendship, that kind of relationship, hard to articulate. Sometimes feelings are hard to define, out loud, or even to ourselves.”
“Hey, good lookin,’” he greets, with a winning, casual grin as Lisa pulls him in for a tight hug, arms around his neck and shoulders. Castiel swallows and glances down as Lisa presses a soft kiss to Dean’s lips by way of greeting. Dean smiles smugly, confidently, down at her, and Castiel’s hopes of
Castiel clenches his fists and digs his nails into his palms to stem the press of tears at his eyes as Dean turns away again.
He remembers the first song when it comes on, how confused and happy he was when it leaked out from Dean’s car’s speakers.
early,” Charlie loops one of Dean’s arms around her to help Castiel share the weight, but she’s so short it hardly helps.
The shepherd thanks Bobby, offering a small and simple nod to substitute a bow, and follows after Dean. Down the hall in stubborn silence, the only sound their footsteps and the ticking of Novak’s thoughts, the swishing of Dean’s resentment inside his skull.
Shouting, and the clatter of blunted swords. Gabriel followed the sound until he reached his brothers’ quarters.
Castiel says, before he has time to stop himself. Michael stops in his tracks, and Castiel flinches, expecting outrage. Something upset and confused twists in his heart when he sees that the King only looks despondent and accepting. Michael’s expression is not surprised, only downcast.
“Forever,” Dean answers, and Castiel is lost with the word. “Don’t—please don’t—all I want, is,” Dean fumbles, “wait,” he falters. Castiel has loved, and longed, with the expression Dean wears: frown twinging his features, ticking with the music of a thought. “Don’t you—won’t you have to, I don’t know, do your angel business, help out in the new heaven?”
Castiel finally brushes his fingers against the High King’s shoulder. He looks up at the stone face of the Human. It is oddly familiar.
The shepherd’s expression shifts again, washes with softness. Like the gentle waves, the gentle waves that lap at soft sands in the coves beneath the cliffs, away from the lash of the Atlantic. The soft waves which were like the dawn, this morning.
He’d wanted to hear something like this, had been all but begging for it—but now that it’s said, the words cannot ring true in his ears, can barely make it
is the most unpromising expression he thinks he’s ever seen. He’s seen her afraid before. Only once—only when Michael looked as though he were about to smite her off of the earth for comparing him to Lucifer—and now she looks filled with more terror than Castiel would have ever thought her capable.
“She’s still not ready to wean, yet?” Dean asks, and Castiel seems to steady himself before replying.
“Well, I’ve been listening,” Jack says, and in response to Castiel’s quizzical frown, continues, “I reopened the line to heaven. I listened to what Sam and Dean were saying.”
Castiel replies, looking up at Anna. Her deep, ruby wings twitch slightly as she frowns thoughtfully at him.
“I, um—I realised, at Dorothy and Charlie’s wedding. I saw you with Castiel, and I felt—I felt so many things. But mainly ashamed, for all the months I clung onto you, unable to accept—” She breaks off. Dean glances up, troubled. “You’re a very easy person to adore, Dean,” Lisa confesses, smiling sadly, “and I—I adored you, and thought I knew how to love you as a result of that.”
It’s a dry heat the day she arrives, and maybe that doesn’t help, nor the fact that there was traffic all the way over here, nor does the fact that Claire’s case worker spends the entire time talking down to her, talking about her like she isn’t there, and making barbed comments about Claire’s track record with foster parents. Claire stays quiet, arms crossed, jaw clenched shut, staring at the ground, tapping her foot.
He lets out an aching sigh, which from his many mouths sounds like the weeping of a wounded animal, more like a herd of them, layers of the sound to match the layers of song which ring from the fracture across his chest.
“Well, Angels aren’t really told about Humans in a way that makes you all sound mystical and supernatural. Perhaps that’s because many of us—if not
I’ve read some of your stuff—you’ve got talent, and we all saw it, even in school. Of course, the things you write about help—you’ve picked a subject that’s very popular, right now—”
cry when she calls him dad. They’re sat at dinner, and Dean is set to give Claire a drum lesson afterwards—Castiel had to push
Mary doesn’t talk at dinner time. Meals are punctuated by the crisp clatter of cutlery on porcelain plates, and Sam’s worried gaze creeping up to both Dean and his mother through thick eyelashes and a mop of hair. Dean spends most of his nights at Lisa’s, until, one day, he can’t anymore.
So Sammy dropping out of law school? Dean can’t exactly blame him, even if it hurts to see his brother discard his dream like crumpled paper; even if Dean worked pretty damn hard to fund Sammy getting there. He can’t blame him.
“Heya, guys,” Dean coughs, half-nervously, into the mic. Jo Harvelle drops a stool next to Dean’s and places a generous glass of something amber-brown next to him. Dean nods gratefully at her, though he is clearly a little distracted. Castiel stays in the shadows. “This is, uh—I’m gonna start out with some old classics, just covering them—and then,” he swallows, smiling self-consciously. “I’ve actually been writing a couple of original songs, recently. So I thought I’d play you those. Sound good?”
“It’s not your fault,” the shepherd reasons. Dean looks away, lip curling. “But you’d like to learn?” The shepherd asks. Dean shrugs, face hot. Sam has always seemed to have to key to some secret and joyful world which Dean, for his illiteracy, was barred from. A door which could never open to him. “If you would, you know,” the shepherd says slowly, carefully—is he nervous?—“I could teach you.”
According to Anna, Lucifer and their father had entered a dispute a before he had left, too. She won’t say what it had been about. Castiel hadn’t even been born at the time of the fight—he would come into being almost
“I don’t know,” Sam shrugs. “Something new. What do you think would be there? Do you think there would be
Dean beams up the man. He likes Mr Novak very much, he's decided. Mary hums thoughtfully, unconvinced.
Dean gasps, hands striking against the ice-slick stone of his balcony and ripping open, as another of these black figures of smoke catapults itself at him.
He doesn’t pursue the thought much longer—he slips into a kind of strange, half-asleep, half-awake state where he paces up and down a blackened room.
Dean bites his bottom lip, and, for the first time in their conversation, looks a little uneasy. Castiel feel all the more smug. He’s going to enjoy this.
“Sorry for scaring you, though, son,” Bobby huffs. “Didn’t want to do that. Didn’t ever want to do that.”
Next chapter: more conversation from Dean and Cas in the present day. Also, more hurt (I'm sorry). Things get better.
“We are thankful for what his father did when he was alive—but John is gone now; and all of that is irrelevant now that—”
Lucifer tilts his chin up in the cold moonlight. It splashes eerie colours over his pale skin, paler than Castiel’s or Michael’s. His lip curls. There is an unkindness in his gaze Dean never saw in Castiel or his oldest brother.
“I cannot say,” He admits. “Only that Michael could never kill one of us… I don’t think. And certainly not his twin. Not for anything in the world. They say he and Lucifer were inseparable. Nothing in the heavens could part them.”
“We’re gonna have to return you to your room, soon, aren’t we?” Dean asks sleepily. Castiel’s heart sinks again.
hit me, Bobby?” Dean snarls, his lips curling. “You really would?! After so many years of pulling your father-figure crap; you’d
Something in his mind was niggling at him. Made him think of Dean. Maybe he had done the wrong thing. Maybe he should text him. He would always need him, but he didn’t want to burden Dean’s life.
‘I’m not Sam. I just can’t walk away from him. I can’t watch him suffer without trying to help. It doesn’t make me a good person.’
‘So, you seeing her again then? I don’t know how these arranged things work. Do you have to do a certain number of dates?’
Dean sees movement to the side and catches Cas and Eileen having a conversation in ASL, she is trying to smother giggles, Cas looks concerned. Eileen is holding Sam’s keys.
Sam and Eileen refuse to let Cas and Dean help clear up. They make their way to the garden and sit on the deck, catching up, staring at the stars.
Dean looks around. How to tell John where he is, what has happened, what he’s missed. He’s struggling to find the words when Sam steps forward and pulls John in tight for a hug.
The intense stare was back, the one he knew so well, even though it was coming through brown eyes rather than the normal blue.
The greeter at the door giggles at something Dean says and turns to usher him in. Dean looks up, catches the eye of whoever he is meeting and his face breaks into a huge grin.
They headed over to the piano, the top of which was littered with torn out pages of the notebook. By unspoken agreement they decided to try out the new song.
‘You will Dean. But please, not today. You are worth more than this. After everything you’ve done, all you’ve given. You deserve more from life than a death like this.’
‘Marv mentioned that there’s been a few bits go missing lately, stuff moved around. You haven’t seen anything. During your late nights working hard in the office?’
Claire opened a cupboard and pulled out more stacks of sheet music. ‘We’ve got plenty, we’re a musical family!’
He remembers what Dean says about the network paying and decides to order everything on the menu. He knows Dean has a large appetite on a normal day, who knows what it will be like after a workout.
She grabs Cas by the elbow and drags him to the door. ‘The rumours are true my friends!’ She grabs Cas by the face and pushes him against the wall, planting a blistering kiss on his lips. After a startled instant in which Cas and Meg stare one another, he appears to return the kiss with similar enthusiasm.
Somehow they had moved onto dating history. Dean was telling Cas about Lisa. ‘I dunno man, it’s like we both woke up one day and it was gone. All that stuff I used to love about her drives me nuts.’
Cas finally cottoned on. ‘I am not embarrassed to be your friend Dean. Any person would feel extremely lucky to be considered your partner.’
Castiel just continued to look at Dean without responding. ‘I forgot you do this.’ Dean murmured to himself quietly.
‘We were going to ask you round to ours for dinner one night. He’s staying with us again this time.’
‘I already am.’ Cas is surprised by the big smile from the man across the table. He doesn’t know what to make of him really. He’s certainly different to how he expected him to be. Of course the bravado was there, the film star smile. But there was a vulnerability under it that Cas would never have expected.
Eileen nudged him, signing below the table, ‘You ok?’ Cas gave a brief nod and a reassuring smile to her.
Dean was outside vigorously pulling posts out the ground. Cas was stood next to him with a huge swathe of fabric in his hands. They were clearly in the middle of an argument, Dean venting his frustrations on the posts in front of him. Cas, resigned, waiting for him to work through his anger. This was a familiar sight to Claire.
‘I’m with you, my real family, it’s all I’ve ever wanted.’ Cas smiles back at Dean. ‘If I hadn’t already called the Empty, I think this moment would do the trick. Knowing I will get to spend the rest of my life here, with you, that is all I want.’
Meg peers at him suspiciously but her eyes are quickly drawn by an Adonis who passes behind Cas and she swiftly makes a bee line for him. Cas leaves the bar shortly after, Meg doesn’t notice.
Before he says anything, Cas turns around surveying the room. ‘I think this will do tonight, I will do the rest in the morning.’
Cas looks at Ben and the both simultaneously mouth fajitas. ‘The latter please dad.’ They both grin at one another. Dean makes mean fajitas.
He almost falls over backwards as Dean Winchester turns around and flashes him a grin. ‘Morning Cas. Assume you like pancakes?’
‘Would you like to join us?’ Becky motions behind her to a table with her own two children. They look bored and miserable.
Dean finds himself looking at his companion in the mirror behind the bar. She’s perhaps a little older than him, shoulder length dark hair, glasses, suit dress. Odd look for a pie festival. He mentions it to her.
Ben looked at her like he had never thought about it like that before, turning his gaze to watch Dean pinned in the corner by Beth and Freddie  peppering him with questions. ‘Yeah but it’s a pretty awesome job.’
Dean is flabbergasted. She can’t be serious. He’s saved from having to answer from Ben and Jack arriving demanding water. He tells them to wash up as dinner is ready.
‘Oh, and there’s something else for all of you. He said it was best to give it to you now otherwise he would forget.’ The woman passed a bag to Claire. She pulled out signed posters from Jack and passed them around. Patience actually started crying. Claire rolled her eyes.
Dean starts dating again around Easter. Doesn’t generally get past the first date. Gives up after a while. A year goes past. The contact with Castiel ever decreasing. The divorce is finalised. Dean feels an incredible lightness, a feeling he hasn’t had in years.
They set the bunker up as command HQ. Travelled around to Hunter gatherings to share know how and tips. The famous Winchester brothers, everyone wanted to hear about the prize fights, the deaths, the deals, the demons, the angels. Dean never spoke about Cas. Soon word got round not to ask.
Cas stopped short when he caught Sam and Claire watching, sighed and ran his hands through his hair. He sat down inside, exhausted. ‘That man will be the death of me.’
The next morning, slightly bleary eyed, because yes she had taken Dean’s suggestion of the hip flask and had partaken heavily once he had come to perform, she came downstairs to greet her Dads and uncle.
‘You could have come, still. Stayed out of our way. I think he was really disappointed you didn’t.’ He sighs, looks away.
The next morning, slightly bleary eyed, because yes she had taken Dean’s suggestion of the hip flask and had partaken heavily once he had come to perform, she came downstairs to greet her Dads and uncle.
Becky nods silently. It clicks into place. The way Lisa has been around more, often out for dinner with this man, explaining it as business negotiations. Home late after things ‘ran long’. She’s never really explained what their business deal is, vague about it whenever Dean asks.
‘I needed to tell you. But you don’t need to worry. The Empty will only come when I am truly happy. That’s not likely to happen at the moment, given the circumstances.’
The pair slowly make their way towards Dean and Ben. Ben is being interviewed by a reporter and doesn’t notice them until they are stood beside him.
‘Yes, but as an actual human now too. Not just a hunk of meat.’ She turns back to Dean, ‘though I won’t say no.’ She gives him a sweet smile.
After another week, Cas decided that he’s put off reality long enough. He needs to get a new job. He sends of a spate of applications and is surprised to get an interview almost immediately.
Lunch is a raucous affair in a low key diner. Castiel watches Dean intently, trying to figure out what it was that made the man so captivating. His caring nature shone through in his interactions with Sam, Ben and Jack, with the waitress.
When Christmas came around, they retreated to the cabin again. Dean organised a giant tree to be placed in the hallway and filled the room with presents. He tried to make it as special as he could.
‘Cause me distress?!’ Dean laughs like a maniac. Cas watches him quizzically, ‘You died!! How was I supposed to take that?’
‘You never need to apologise to me. That was, I don’t have words... incredible doesn’t cut it. If felt, different. Different to when we played it at home. Different to when Sam sings it. I’ve never felt like that on stage ever before.’
Eileen sobs, Sam weeps. Dean is unable to form words. Cas is the only one able to say thank you to Jack. ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t have enough strength left to heal him once I got us back here. You saved him.’
‘You have no idea how hard this is. I’m supposed to sit here waiting for you, like some old fashioned wife waiting for her husband to return from war? With no idea what’s going on. How am I supposed to do that?’
‘Guys, come here. We’ve got a visitor.’ He turns around as John wrenches open the car door about to launch at Jack. Dean holds him back. ‘Dad, it’s ok. He’s not a threat.’
Cas continues, ‘The longer it went on the harder it got to come out. I worried people would think it was a gimmick. It’s not like there was anyone I was hurting. So I just didn’t.’
Dean passes out on the sofa not long after arriving home. Cas covers him with a blanket and sits down next to the unconscious man.
Dean knows such people exist. He’s sure it’s a great idea. Particularly with someone of her skill set. He’s found out she used to run the publishing house he’s working with but got kicked out when she and her co-founder had a falling out. Dean isn’t stupid. He’s asked around. Knows that she’s considered to be an unpleasant person by most of her co workers. But he’s also aware that lots of driven career women get tarred with the ‘bitch’ brush for having the audacity, shock horror, to have ambition and voice their opinions. He’s seen a softer, caring side to her personality, as well as the strong independent woman he first admired.
‘Oh, you know. The same. He always is. So are you.’ Dean snorted, but then, she’s right. That’s kind of the problem. He sighs, runs a hand over his face.
Cas didn’t bother to answer, he just pushed his way to the door. He barely said anything to his friends on the drive home.
The following week, rehearsals are postponed again so Sam takes the chance to get in some more school work, putting Ben ahead of schedule while they can. He’s pleased with Ben’s progress, tells Dean he’s got a very bright kid.
Dean turns back again, an odd look in his eye. ‘You have me at a disadvantage, Cas.  You know what I do. How about you? Need to get to know the in laws.’ He waves the spatula.
‘Cas said he did know me, as in past tense. He still knows me as well as he ever did. I haven’t changed.’ As an afterthought, muttered quietly ‘unfortunately.’
Cas wanted to listen to what he was saying, but he couldn’t forget the reason why he left in the first place. But he had to try to get past it for Claire’s sake.
As Jack reaches the group Dean looks round. Mary is stood stock still with the machete still in one hand. John has now turned his focus in her direction as well. They are staring at each other.
‘I’m not going to tell you how to live your life. But, is this what you want?’ Cas cuts in, he can’t hear anymore. Is that selfish? He can’t help it.
Ben bounds through their front door when they reach Texas. Lisa is waiting for them. She grabs Ben for a hug. He squirms out of it after only a few seconds. In the months they have been away he has gone from being a young kid to an awkward teenager, he has shot up and is now taller than Lisa, Dean expects his voice to drop any day. He’s a different boy. More independent, more confident, he’s started the transition to being a young man. Dean is so proud.
Like the fact that Cas is jealous of Benny? That Benny has decided that he doesn’t want to tangle with Dean’s complicated family situation?
‘No, let me finish. This might be the end of me, tonight. You need to know your worth. How much you mean to me.’
The sight brought tears to her eyes. Nothing discernible had changed, but she could see the ease with which they joked with each other, just the fact they were sat on opposite ends of the same sofa rather than across the room was different. She decided not to disturb them.
He looks out into the hallway and spots Cas and Dean. He can hear Cas preparing Dean for the unpleasantness that is time-travel. That’s fine, let them get there and find their bearings? He’ll check in again later.
He must have fallen asleep half way through Princess Bride as there’s a pounding on the door just as Wesley et al are about to storm the castle. The last Cas knew Wesley had been in the fire swamp with Buttercup.
Rowena was up for the challenge. She and Cas put their heads together to come up with the best plan. Sam and Dean scouted locations.
John hasn’t said a word, just sits there watching. He relaxes once all three have finished testing. Dean scrabbles around and finds some chairs.
They talk about Sam and his work with Jack, and Eileen and her business (she’s a speech and language therapist and has her own consultancy business so she can work remotely if she wants to follow Sam on any of his trips). They talk about Dean’s son, he shows Castiel pictures, they are all adorable and Ben looks just like him.  Castiel tells him about his son Jack in return.
‘Cas.’ Dean walked hesitantly, spoke carefully, confused at his appearance. ‘What are you doing here? Did Sam tell you?’
When Claire came bounding in from school the atmosphere was still there. She gave them both a look and proceeded to ignore the tension. There was a slight thaw over dinner and the remainder of the evening was bearable, if not pleasant. Until they started discussing the next day.
‘Oh? And anyone else knew we should know about? I’ve had reports of you taking a lot of trips to Northern California lately. Is there a new girlfriend on the scene.’
The scene outside had escalated. They had both downed their weapons of post and fabric. Dean was stomping back and forth shouting, while Cas was looking stoically back at him. But Claire could tell, his temper was about to boil over. A few seconds later, she was proven right. Cas, in his quiet intense way, slowly walked up to Dean, spoke firmly to him in a way that made Dean shrivel. He then turned on his heel and walked back into the house.
Mrs Harvelle sat down on a bench and patted the space beside her. ‘I understand that someone unusual dropped you at school this morning.’
He looks around at all the people he loves, grateful. At peace. Something he never thought he would get. He’s surprised at how many people are pleased to see him. They all speak to Sam, yes, but it’s like smiles get slightly wider when they look at him. He’s not sure how to take it. Why would they be looking at him like that?
A date was set when Jody’s parents could watch the two kids, and they went out on the town. After some shots and cocktails the discussion turned to romance.
‘Yeah, we’re just heading out on the boat for the day. Hold on Claire. Everything ok?’ Cas looked worried.
‘Um, Sam?’ He glances up at Cas, who points to Eileen. Sam flashes a grateful smile at Cas before grabbing his keys from  Eileen and flouncing past her.
Somehow that makes Balthasar’s eyes go even higher. Cas decides to twist the knife a little, ‘You did meet Eileen didn’t you Balthasar? Once? Maybe?’
Dean looked like he was about to speak again, Cas held up his hand, ‘ I need to tell them who I am. Other wise they will start digging.’
‘Dude, it’s a signed original. You don’t know what I had to do at Comic-Con to negotiate this.’ She was clearly very proud of herself.
‘When did you know?’ He hisses at Sam, ‘Last night, after dinner. Sorry I should have said but I wanted to see your face.’ Dean scowls back at him. ‘Jack is his son.’
‘So, shall we go home then?’ Sam opened the car door, looking back expectantly. Cas claimed in wordlessly and didn’t say anything until they got back to the Lodge.
Oh. Ok then. ‘Sounds great man.’ Dean claps him on the back. Well it’s not like they had been best pals for long. Cas probably has a ton of other friends in LA or wherever he goes.
Cas murmurs his agreement, suddenly conscious of his cheap jeans in the nice bar, noticing the other male patrons are in nice suits.
‘Cas meet Baby.’ Dean gestures to the gleaming black car. Cas knows little about cars but can see this is a very well, lovingly, preserved old car. Dean opens the garage door, jumps in and starts the engine. ‘Listen to her purr Cas!’
‘Dean, I admire you more than you could ever know. Not for your money or your fame, but because of who you are, your caring nature. You made me care too, re-evaluate my life. You make me happier than anything else in the whole world. Even though I could never have you as anything more than a friend, that’s enough. So long as I had you in some way.’
‘I’m glad he has you to show him, Sam, you’re such a good brother. It pains me to see him have such a low opinion of himself, to put his wants and needs to one side and never prioritise himself.
‘It’s different Castiel. We’re taking on a partnership with a sponsor organisation to try and raise our profile. You’ll need to work closely with your counterpart, a gentleman by the name of Crowley. The team must have a leader at this crucial time.’
He text Claire once he was home to make sure she had a good night. He went upstairs to his room and got changed into pjs and a T-shirt. He got into bed and tried to control his racing thoughts.
After they had all become familiar with one another, rooms were allocated. Sam and Eileen had the master room. They settled in while Dean shipped Cas and Claire to interconnecting smaller rooms next door. Jack and Dean were sharing the giant twin room in the other side of the house.
‘So anyway, it’s only a few days. I’m going to show them around, we’ll see how things go when we get back home.’
Claire piped up from the back seat, ‘I don’t want to be accused of eavesdropping, but Jack is right Dad. I don’t know what sort of mess Dean would have been raising me without you. He entrusted his only child to you. And let you get on with it because he know you would do an amazing job as my Dad. Whatever the issues you guys have had, I’m sure they can be fixed.’ Cas stared at her in the rear view mirror.
Cas wordlessly heads upstairs and grabs a spare toothbrush, towel and pjs for Dean placing them on the spare bed. ‘Thank you Cas, I really needed this.’ Cas smiles before closing the door behind him.
They spent that evening in the bunker reminiscing about John over pizza and beer. It felt odd to be mourning someone who had been gone from their lives for so long. But for Mary it was so much more fresh.
When Dean’s comments are serious strategy points, more often than not, Cas follows his suggestions. They’ve worked problems together long enough to know how one another thinks. He trusts Dean’s guy and knows that Sam will have his son’s interests in mind.
‘You and Ben. It’s always like this, I’m great all week but the moment you walk in all he sees is you.’
He gets to the hotel early but decides to go in anyway, get a drink to calm his nerves. He rounds the corner to the bar and finds Dean there already. Jeans, black t-shirt and leather jacket, leaning casually against the bar chatting to the barman. Effortlessly cool.
It felt so different to when Cas hugged him. It wasn’t the same. But it was so close. Dean hugged back.
The doctor closest to him seemed happy with the machine readings. ‘We’re going take this tube out now Dean. Just stay calm.’
‘Nice to meet you Meg. Cas, this is a Graves. A type of Bordeaux. I’m reliably informed by the very knowledgable bar tender that it should be light and drinkable. Perfect for a relaxed birthday evening with friends. Plus,’ with a wink, ‘I got her number.’ Cas rolls his eyes.
‘Alright then,’ Dean claps his hands together, ‘let’s get this show on the road.’ If this was as good as it got, then he wanted to get it over with.
‘Hello Dean.’ Jack beams and holds his hand up. Dean nearly choked at the familiarity of the greeting, said in the same intonation, just a different voice to the one he’s used to.
Dean snorts, ‘Better than either of us, especially if he’s going up against full strength angels in flares.’ Sam snorts, they both let out a howl of laughter when Dean suggests picturing Cas with a 70s outfit.
Dean settled himself at the library table with Sam. They had the Men Of Letters records in front of them, searching for information on the Pearl.
‘Look, Cas, let me be honest. I really like you, I think we get on like a house on fire. But I wasn’t really looking for anything, I did this because Rowena asked.’
Dean waited for them to finish and stopped in for his own hug. Sam introduced her to his parents who, through the magic of heaven, were able to sign fluently. Dean watched their interactions with only a minor pang of jealousy.
‘Lisa, when you were thinking about him being gone for 6months and missing him, did you think about missing me?’
Sam watches the exchange quietly. Castiel is about to speak when Jody appears at the open door, ‘Dean! Is everything ok? I heard shouting and slamming outside.’
‘And is that why you’ve teamed back up with your old writing partner, Jimmy? It’s been, what, five years since you wrote with him? I was at your gig recently. You can really feel his influence on that one song, ‘Profound Bond’. Its a real shift away from the last album, Perdition, where he didn’t collaborate on any of the songs.’
Cas gave a small smile. ‘This is not a vessel Dean. I made it. I thought it might please you.’ Dean’s jaw dropped open.
‘It was awesome. Jack was amazing. Dad and Sam were incredible. You were right, it’s so much better in a stadium.’
‘Yo, angel boy.’ Meg high fives him. He never quite knows how to respond to her. They met in college and formed a close bond immediately. But he wouldn’t say they had anything in common.
‘Did it occur to you what I saw when I arrived? You and Meg. And Balthasar telling the press he’s your best friend, confirming your relationship.’
After being checked over by the doctor at the hospital Cas is diagnosed with a mild concussion and is sent home with a worried Sam and Eileen.
Cas nods, realising the importance of Sam being able to keep his own life private. As a prosecutor any unnecessary attention on him could influence the cases he tries. It’s how he and Eileen met, Eileen was an interpreter for one of the witnesses in a case that Sam was dealing with.
‘Yeah it was, but something happened with the dad. He was a nice guy but they didn’t like the screen test with Ben. They want to keep her though. Gabe said something about his first choice having been unavailable.’
‘Rumours have flown for years that Castiel Novak, the renowned heart-throb, preferred men to women. Is this the confirmation we’ve finally been after?’
‘Dean, I was stood with someone this evening. She was listening to you play ‘Purgatory’ and telling me how she could hear that song was written with two voices each telling the other they love each other. I had never heard it like that before.’
‘I don’t think that’s a good idea Cas. It was dark last night, our driver didn’t get a good look at you.’ Dean stops, not wanting to continue his line of thought. Cas tenses, he understands what Dean is saying.
By this point the car is drawing attention. Once they see the car, people start to spot Dean. He’s gone for the full rockstar look, leather jacket and subglasses (it’s not raining, but it’s hardly sunny). Claire sinks lower still and starts groaning. ‘Daaaad, please? Come on! You’re so embarrassing!’
Dean’s voice was on fire. He was mesmerising. Cas couldn’t stop staring as he sung the melody and lyrics they had worked on together all those years ago.
Sam’s son looks at his father. Dean can see the hesitation. He doesn’t know his namesake after all. Sam nods, ‘You can tell him anything Dean. He’s my brother. He was beside me every step of the way.’
‘Glad you and Eileen had some time to chill man, you both need it.’ He swallows, ‘I hear Cas has a new gig?’
‘Well, this place just gets more and more astounding. You boys have managed to build yourselves a family between stopping apocalypses. So you knocked this Cas up then?’ He gestures to Jack, ‘Are you going to make an honest woman out of her Dean?’
He pondered his sanity as he stood waiting for his key. He was an idiot, he would get the first plane back tomorrow, he should never have come. Cas wouldn’t want to see him.
Younger Dean’s eyes bug out. His father and uncle snort with uncontainable laughter. Jack looks around, ‘I’m told it’s how younger people greet each other in your time?’ He’s confused by their mirth.
‘Right back atcha, pal.’ He bent down to grab his bag, ‘I’ll leave you to your beauty sleep. Good to see you man. Sorry, again. Have a good trip.’ The words spill out of his mouth. He forces himself up out of his seat. He walks away, refusing the urge to turn back.
Cas reached out to wipe away the tear. It was all it took. Dean launched himself into Cas’ embrace. Neither of them knew how long they stood like that.
Dean breezes in, beautiful as ever. ‘Cas! Have you tried the bed? It’s heaven!’ He’s flung himself, starfish-like, across the middle of his bed. Cas is stood in the doorway watching his friend grin as he bounces on the bed like a child. The smile is catching. Cas can’t help himself grin back. He relaxes. This is what he’s here for. It’s going to be fine.
Lisa was on her best behaviour all day. She was funny and charming, attentive to Dean, playing with Ben. Dean could see his son glowing. He tried to speak to her but she was cleverly dodging him.
The pie festival was quietening down. He’s swilling the whiskey around in the glass in front of him slowly, lost in thought. He feels someone sit down in the seat next to him, hears a low voice order a drink. The same as his.
That doesn’t sound quite...  ‘Are you back together?’ He doesn’t want the reply, but frankly he needs to rip the plaster off. It’s nothing to do with him really. And of course he wants Dean to be happy.
Sam nodded sagely and they buried their heads back in the books. They had been at it a few hours when Cas came rushing in. ‘I think we need to put this on hold Dean, I’m hearing murmurings on angel radio. I think Michael is nearby.’
He does miss Balthasar. They were good friends for a long time. Both before and after they dated. But their lives went in different directions a while ago.
‘I don’t care how rusty they are. Brush them off, dust them down, polish them up, but you’re doing this job whether you like it or not. The team is extremely dysfunctional. It needs strong leadership.’
Dean couldn’t help but catch the difference in Cas descriptions of him and Sam. So he quickly jumped in with, ‘You see dad, it’s hopeless, he’d be lost without us!’ John’s lips rose briefly in a smile that didn’t meet the eyes at Dean’s attempted joke.
He approaches Ellen who is cleaning glasses. ‘Do you have a place for me to crash Ellen?’ She gives him a look. He knows that look. He chooses to ignore her.
When Charlie gave him the papers Dean exploded. He cancelled everything with Amara. Scrapped the whole album. He nearly lost their contract with the label, Amara threatened to sue him. He didn’t care.
‘What? No?! Him, yeah I suppose he is, I mean he’s said stuff, ah, but I don’t really know what to do with it. But me, no, I’m not ...’ he looks around wildly for someone to help him, turns back to Benny and shrugs. ‘I love him. He’s my best friend. But it’s not like that.’
‘Yes Dean, you are.’ Cas stroked the side of his face as Dean started sobbing. He broke down and let Cas cradle his head.
Ben absorbs most of Dean’s energy for the rest of the day, understandably. By bed time he’s excited about tomorrow and less tearful. Sometimes Dean forgets he’s only a teenager as he’s grown so tall, but at times like this he’s like the little kid he used to be.
He couldn’t help himself in the meantime, searching for reviews of the tour and Amara. The general consensus was the same - the chemistry was undeniable.
‘You should have thought about this when you said we should move out. It’s too late to be having second thoughts, Cas.’
‘You could bring Castiel? I usually bring a friend along. No pressure for a date. Probably a good place to meet some new people too. And I imagine lots of people would love to meet you Cas.’
He wasn’t expecting what he heard. His head whipped round as he saw Cas singing and playing the piano.
Dean hides a satisfied smile. ‘He’ll be here.’ Bobby claps his hand on Dean’s shoulder reassuringly.
‘Well, you guys can see each other then too.’ Dean nodded quickly, smiling at Claire. He felt like he was in some warped version of The Parent Trap.
The door pushes open, he turns momentarily to see a tall man with dark, long ish hair walk in. Sam’s trend is catching. Why can’t anyone trim their hair? Dean grumbles to himself like an old man. Well, this is as old as he’ll ever get. That’s a thought right there.
‘I’ve been telling your father about the heavenly wars and my role as garrison commander. We were strategising.’
Cas hadn’t fully retired, he still did the odd bit of work here and there. But it was very much on his terms now. He was sufficiently sought after. Often he didn’t have his name included on a song anymore, he wasn’t bothered, he was well know enough, but Dean knew his touch well enough that he could tell.
He had seen Dean chatting up men as often as women. Although he had only had long term relationships with women. But that was just luck. Dean hadn’t planned it that way. Clearly, Cas didn’t feel like that about Dean.
Claire looked up from her homework, ‘Nah, probably just the usual turkey coma in front of the TV.’ Her gauze turned thoughtful, ‘Though you can cook this year, last year we had to order pizza coz Dad nearly set fire to the turkey but the inside still managed to be raw.’ She gave Cas a side eye glare.
Castiel gingerly opens the passenger door and climbs in. Dean jams a tape into the deck and the first strains of a guitar come thronging through the speakers. He turns the volume dial up and backs out onto the road. So sue him, it helps him relax.
One day he’s in the office late finishing some work for Sam when Luke shows up at his door. He’s been texting Dean the recipe for a dish he’s making for Amara.
Dean’s gaze flicks to Cas. Hell. Of course that’s a sensible idea. Why had he suggested sharing a room. Oh god. He should leave off hard liquor as it makes him an idiot the day after too. He fails to answer Ben.
‘Well if you two are finished with your moment, I’m coming too. If you’re letting Dean in the same room as this angel then what’s the harm in me coming too.’
Cas nodded. He signed the papers and handed them back. ‘Bye Charlie, Claire and I are moving. It’s been lovely working with you.’
Apparently he managed to drift off to sleep. He was woken abruptly by the front door slamming and Dean calling his name loudly.
‘Local too.’ He shuts the lid sharply. ‘Meet you at the car in ten.’ And stomps off to his room leaving Sam slightly shell shocked.
Dean laughed, but started to relax. It was still some time before filming started and it had just been delayed. Something about bad screen tests and recasting.
It was a cold day. Ridiculous really. Dean slipped on a patch of ice in the yard. Doctors said it was inevitable, his spinal cord was so close to having been severed all those years before, it just took a sharp fall to give up the ghost. They were impressed he had lived as long as he had after the findings of his autopsy. The couldn’t understand how he had survived some of the injuries which marked his body. Nothing short of miraculous. He must have a guardian angel, they concluded.
He looked at Cas, somehow seeing the real Cas, despite the woman before him. I miss you, he thought, did he say that out loud?
‘Cas.’ Dean doesn’t turn round. Cas can see from the set of his shoulders that he is angry. Perhaps also from the punch. Dean was good at showing anger, but less skilled at demonstrating thue other emotions which were bubbling beneath the surface. But Cas knew him well. He could read the Dean Winchester emotion smorgasbord without the man even having to turn around.
Dean made his way eventually to his publisher’s office. Tess had offered him good guidance so far. She wanted to meet to discuss editors for his book. She had some suggestions for him to consider and wanted to talk about them in person.
Sam dropped his fork on his half-eaten plate. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d actually been around to celebrate their dad’s birthday. He’d always called his mom to talk on the day, check in with her.
Castiel looked over at the bar stools and frowned. It did seem entirely possible, given the projection of things. There were only so many objects in the bar Dean could make use of like that, and he had steadily worked his way through using the pool table balls already.
“To people watch, if I’m being honest. And if someone catches my eye, I try to see if they’re interested back.”
“What's she like?” Dean asked Kevin, still curious to find out about his new supposed co-star. If he could call her that seeing as they hadn't even met yet. “I'm guessing you've met her?”
“Would you be available to help me catalog the time relic? I can never recall all the details of that system Sam set up.”
He helped Bobby out during his stay, doing as he and Sam had as children on their holidays: deconstructing old wrecks of cars for scrap, doing some inventory, fixing fences, whatever Bobby needed. It was the perfect way to clear his mind while he tried to figure what he wanted to do with his life after the film finished in proper. All he knew for now was that he wanted to completely finish his filming before he even started looking for a new project.
“I booked the rooms in my name at the motel. Since I’m hauling this thing I’ll probably be behind you. See you there?”
Despite everything though, inside he felt warm and happy – which was not how he expected to feel watching the intentional disaster that was
Castiel found himself slowly remembering this part of himself again. The part that remembered how much he loved humans. He had never forgotten that he did love humanity, but he’d forgotten how strongly that could make him feel. Parts of him were being woken up with each new activity he tried with Dean. Hannah had stepped up admirably to help take part of his leadership duties from him too, allowing Castiel to spend much desired time with Dean.
“Sometimes, Sam…” Castiel hesitated, not quite sure how best to communicate to Sam things as he saw them. “You’re still fairly new to this
“I know the changes look like a lot, but really it is for the best,” Bela assured the group. “In fact, the studio is increasing the budget another $100 million, that's how much faith we have in this.”
Maybe it was the food, the taking on calories his body had probably been screaming out for, or maybe it was the way he was sitting with such a talkative group but Sam’s mind felt awake and alive for the first time in the last week.
Castiel was unaware of the silent crying, unable to see much beyond the vast, flawless expanse of Sam’s well-muscled back.
In the year Dean had been working for him, Dean had come to know Castiel better than any of his neighbors knew him. Probably better than a lot of his friends, and
“Surely the film isn't going to be ready for another eight months at least?” Jody questioned, eyebrows drawn together in confusion. “The amount of post-effects you're going to have to do? Last film I worked on had nowhere near this amount of green screen and they were working for a year after principle photography finished.”
Dean had no right to be annoyed or upset about the fact he was pretty much locked up here, not when he was the one who agreed to it in the first place.
That didn't mean Dean had any idea what he wanted to do with his life. So much of his time growing up had been these films that he'd never really thought about it. He'd been offered a few roles. Nothing had seemed right though. Dean's only direction in life was his strong desire to show that he was more than just some former child actor. Aged 22, Dean Winchester wanted to make a name for himself as more than just a kid.
“Huh.” Dean let himself drop back onto the couch next to Castiel. “If there’s only ever ten Castiels, maybe something does happen.”
“Does it matter, Sam? What’s the point of having two powerful entities in the family if you can’t even get a garden that goes on forever? I call it
As he showed Sam all the plants he’d put into the space, Sam grew more in awe of what had been created.
Dean ran a hand over his bed mate's hair, smoothing it, enjoying the feel of its silky texture under his fingers. He remembered doing the same thing last night, and again a few hours ago.
Bela beamed out at the audience from the stage, observing the hands that shot up. The cast was sat behind a long table to the side of where she stood.
“It takes more than a few shots to get to me these days, um,” Dean swallowed nervously. “So long as you feel able to consent?”
Dean thought of Benny with the restaurant he ran back to between filming movies. Before he could stop himself, he thought back more intently to Benny proudly showing them all photos of his wife and kids.
“We weren’t going to say anything today,” Sam fought back, irritated suddenly that he was having to defend a situation that wasn’t of his own creation. “I didn’t want you knowing at all.”
Dean couldn’t stand up. His wrists had been cuffed behind his back to his ankles, forcing him to keep the kneeling position he’d been in for the last… Well he wasn’t sure how long. Hours, days, weeks? Time passed so oddly now.
Dean let out a sudden laugh. “Mr. Cas, just being over your lap like this? You have no idea how many of my fantasies have already been fulfilled. Even if you send me out that door right now, without my clothes, I’d be happy.”
“Wow, oh wow. I thought living in this hippy city would have left you a little more enlightened than that. Life’s what you make of it, Sam. Be that kids or a weird seahorse fetish thing. That’s what Cas has always said.”
“I'm deeply sorry you were dragged into this, Dean,” Castiel said so sincerely Dean couldn't help but believe him.
“You’re going to get pounded by two of us later,one back here, another in your mouth, everyone else stroking your skin. It’s the closest experience to heaven on earth that I’ve ever had.”
Amara comes in with a warm smile two take away coffees and brownies for them. She kisses Dean on the forehead before turning her attention to his leg.
He coughs a little nervously, ‘Thank you for indulging me.’ A shy smile, and the audience goes wild.
‘I love acting, but I barely feel like I do that anymore. It’s all the bullshit that comes with it, all the time. It’s draining.’ Dean’s eyes are shining with moisture, he looks away.
‘Your food was delicious Ellen. But you still have a lot of leftovers, I’m not sure they’ll get eaten.’
Gabriel’s head whips back to Cas. He gives him a withering look. ‘Yes Cas, I know that. I’m not stupid.’
It was this scene that their parents arrived back to. Mary could immediately sense something in the air. She came over to Dean with a question in her eyes.
Dean knocked on the door, hissing loudly, ‘Cas! Just next week. Please listen to me.’ He didn’t get a reply. He tried the door handle. It didn’t budge. He didn’t want to shout and bang on the door and wake up the boys, he resolved to speak to Cas in the morning. Explain properly.
There are hugs between Ben, Cas and Gabe, the trio pose for photos together. Then Cas is stood in front of Dean.
The ride back to the bunker is quiet, all three of them lost in their own thoughts. Dean glances back at his dad every once in a while in the back seat. Sam texts his mom to tell her not to come and meet them as planned, just head to the bunker. He’s not sure how to broach that particular topic.
He made his way to a small bridge across a stream in the park which was between his apartment and the river. He was part way across when he spotted a figure walking towards him, head down and shoulders hunched. He started. He no longer had a protective detail, he hadn’t had any further contact from his former employer. He had hoped the episode had passed.
‘I’m very glad I didn’t end up with Dad after my mother died. I would have ended up like him. Or in care when he went to prison. My mother knew you were the right choice to look after me, to be my father.’ Jack smiled his innocent yet knowing smile at Cas.
By Saturday night Castiel is choosing his outfit with trepidation. Jack is supervising, ‘No dad, not that one. Try this one.’
He arrived at the lodge they had rented with Claire for the holiday a little ahead of schedule. One of the others must already be there as he could see smoke coming out of the chimney.
Dean was starting to feel more content. But, he couldn’t help but dwell on the people who were missing today.
She brushed it off, ‘Nah, we’re all good Sam, it was cool.’ She pondered for a moment. ‘I think Dad wants to make up for lost time.’
They chat for a while, Amara sat casually on the cushion next to Dean, her feet tucked up under her. Dean watches her when she’s speaking, gesticulating with her hands, gazing intently into his eyes with her stories. He feels an electric spark between them.
They all nodded. Before her other dad, the one she lived with, had moved them to Northern California he had done something (Claire was always vague) in the music industry. She had connections and often hooked them up for sold out gigs.
Slowly, at the front of the stage, another silhouetted figure appears, standing in front of a microphone. Smoke swirls around him as the guitar stops, echoing through the arena. A growling voice begins to sing. The crowd goes wild as they recognise the band’s first big hit ‘Empty’.
‘Yeah I think you’re right there. It’s not like he hasn’t seen you since you’ve moved here, he’s still seeing you as frequently as before, but I think it was different coz he would always stay in a hotel, he didn’t get to live with you.’
Silence descends. Things turn weird again. Dean grabs his sunglasses and makes for the door. ‘Catch you later Cas.’
Castiel turns. ‘The opposite actually. I think she liked me a lot. It wasn’t fair to lead her on. She thought it was just a normal blind date situation and that we had ‘hit it off’.’ Wow, he even did the air quotes.
‘Yes, I will come back eventually. We’re filming three films back to back, it’s likely to be a while.’
Dean was outside vigorously pulling posts out the ground. Cas was stood next to him with a huge swathe of fabric in his hands. They were clearly in the middle of an argument, Dean venting his frustrations on the posts in front of him. Cas, resigned, waiting for him to work through his anger. This was a familiar sight to Claire.
‘If you want Cas, I can put out a statement. Explaining that you’re my friend who helped write that song. You don’t want your identity revealed etc etc.’
Sam and Eileen load their car. Jack is heading back with them. He’s got a low key party with some friends. Sam and Eileen are planning a cosy night in.
‘I’m not asking you to like him. Just give him a chance to know the boys I’ve got to know and love.’
‘I think I’m going to call it a night.’ He downs the rest of his drink and leaves money on the bar. He can feel that long stare again, it’s giving him goosebumps.
‘We’re headed out shortly. Found a case nearby. Probably could use an extra pair of hands if you’re up for it?’
They drive for miles chit chatting about nothing and everything. Cas forgets who he’s speaking to, he finds it so easy to speak with Dean. He’s sure that must come from hours doing press gigs and chatting up, directors? Producers? He’s not sure, but industry people he’s sure need chatting up. He’s not delusional to think that Dean particularly likes spending time with him, just that chatting is a good a way to pass the time as any. Unless a good song comes on, then Dean is singing at the top of his lungs and using the steering wheel as his drum kit.
‘Yes, we did meet.’ Balthasar leaves it at that. Cas looks away satisfied. Dean nods as thought he understands but he’ll ask Cas later. There’s a story there.
Dean generally feels like a sore thumb at these things, but Gabe and Cas make him feel welcome, they don’t ditch him when Ben is off doing whatever it is he is needed to. Cas and Gabe are just guests so they have no set role, but of course they are still in general demand. Dean follows the group around meeting people. Surprisingly everyone he is introduced to is interested to meet him.
Cas has explained to them both that this isn’t Sam’s fault, that it was his own decision. Neither brother will listen. They are too embroiled in feeling guilty and taking it out on one another. Eileen just rolls her eyes and tells Cas that they’ll get past it.
‘Campbell was their mother’s maiden name. Dean was already making a name for himself when Sam was in college. He didn’t want there to be any conflict or wrong impressions so he sought to distance himself, use a different name. Dean is supportive and understanding. It gives Sam some extra anonymity.’
He ends up going to a lot of ‘functions’ over the next few months. There’s another company that Lisa is trying to work with. Their CEO and his wife are often at the functions, he and Lisa spend their time off talking business, Dean is left to chat to his wife, Becky. Becky is, in Dean’s opinion, frankly, crazy. But probably harmless. He hopes.
‘How about you? You don’t look like one of the competitive pie eating team.’ She seemed entirely serious, was she actually asking that question?
‘I looked it up. I know there were rumours about a singer who was their support act at the time. That she and Dean were together. I don’t remember much about Amara, but I think maybe she drove a wedge between them? I don’t remember her coming to the house like his old girlfriend Lisa.’
Dean is speechless as Cas rejoins him, bewildered and flustered. He tries to gather his things to walk away before Cas gets to him. He finds his legs won’t move.
Dean smiles. ‘Ok then. See you soon then.’ He shuts the door, grabs his bag and walks into the terminal.
On the screen, Dean is singing softly, Sam on the acoustic guitar accompanying him. It’s one of their early songs. Cas and Dean had written it together.
He’s not prepared for Cas coming down the stairs in and electric blue suit with matching blue tie. The exact colour of his eyes. It’s incredible. Dean is stunned. Entirely lost for words.
That stopped Cas in his tracks. Other people, namely Balthasar and Rowena most recently, had made similar comments before. He had dismissed them. But the fact that Claire could see it .... it made him stop to think.
The whole tour had come to theirs for a barbecue one weekend in the summer. She was there too. Dean had mentioned her briefly, their new support act. Amara was beautiful.
The hallway was huge with a sweeping staircase winding up in front of them. They could hear clattering from the door to the right. The walked through what appeared to be an open plan dining/kitchen area as a head which had been stuck in a cupboard peered over the top of the work surface at the sound of their approach. Dean beamed at the sight of them.
Cas is sure he can see Dean wince. He lowered his voice when he replies. ‘Yeah, that was an accident. I’m not sure we’re going to work out. I was trying to tell her that. Saying I was going away so we weren’t going to get to see one another for a while Somehow it ended up with them coming with me.’
‘I understand Dean.’ His head whips back round. ‘It’s why I left my job, you’ll recall. And I’ve never really felt at home, always expecting to move on, even from my own place.’
‘This is a memory of Jimmy’s, somewhere he and his wife went, long before I came along. They were happy here. In love. I thought I would borrow it for us. Is this no good? I can change it again.’
Claire looked at him suspiciously but didn’t question it. They all started to say goodbye when Jack piped up suddenly. ‘Can I come back with you guys? I’ve still got a few days before I need to head back to work.’
Another sip. ‘But that’s not even the reason either. He’s had our back more times than I can remember. Not just physically, he’s been there for us, he’s on our side, we can rely on him, powers and wings or not. He’s a weird dude I’ll grant you, but I would rather have him than not.’ He glances up from his coffee to see his dad and Cas studying him.
‘What about him Sam? I knew there was a new drummer. Keeps raving about how good he is. Sounds like he’s a good drinking pal too, they always seem to be out on the town together.’
‘I missed you Cas. God, I missed you so much. You can’t do that man! You can’t say that and then just leave.’ Dean gasps for air, ‘You weren’t here when I needed you.’
‘I thought we lost you. In the ambulance. It was odd, you said ‘Goodbye Dean’. If I hadn’t seen it come from your mouth I would have sworn it was Cas.’ Sam shook his head. ‘You were gone. For a long time.’
Cas is drying the dishes after dinner on Sunday evening as Dean strolls in. He was exempt from dish duty as he had cooked them all dinner, and had gone outside for some fresh air. His cheeks were pink from the cold. The snow storm gone as suddenly as it appears, making way for some warmer, if still fresh, spring air. It was still chilly once the sun started to disappear.
‘I always think that the song sounds like it’s got two different voices, don’t you think. Each one telling the other how much they love them.’ She listens for a moment, ‘See?’
Well, that’s not quite true. They’ve had a brief text exchange every day, but Dean had got used to chatting to his new friend. As he was sat idle in the airport, trying to distract himself from thinking about the flight ahead, he realised how he’d got used to speaking to Cas every day. Hell it’s more than he speaks to Lisa.
Dinner is a success. Cas can see why Dean is so taken with Ben, he really is a great kid. Lisa is a delight too, warm and funny. She gets on well with Sam and Eileen.
Sam and Eileen let him go home the next day. They order him a new phone (his was gone and the cash from his wallet, clearly designed to make the attack look like a mugging) and send him home with food for days and instructions to rest.
Cas didn’t reply. Dean put the coffee pot down, the tone of his voice changing as he rambled on, ‘And, you know, it gets lonely now Ben is gone. I can only bug Sam so much.’
Cas didn’t respond. Eventually, ‘I’ve had that charge levied at me before. Like I told you, he was, is, my best friend. He and his brother are my family. Of course I love him.’
Charlie is half way through a long story about a trip through the (fictional) land of Oz with her friend Dorothy. She was a keen gamer.
‘Dean, you can never let me down, but I can’t stand by and watch you get back together with someone like that. I can’t watch her mistreat you, it’s too painful to see.’
As he drifted off he made a mental note to upgrade Cas to first class if he did make the trip out to see him.
‘Morning pal.’ Dean shielded his eyes against the glaring sun. The snow was melting fast in its bright rays.
‘But we’re talking about you. I support your decision. Either way. You I always will provided you do what is best for you.’
Cas had been grappling with the fact that his life was wrapped up in Dean Winchester and this conversation wasn’t helping much. If anything it made him realise that he was lost the moment he met Dean. It hadn’t come later, when he realised that he was falling in love with his friend, but it had been instantaneous. He just hadn’t understood the feeling at the time.
They make their way outside and Cas is confronted with the sight of a gleaming black classic car. ‘Baby, meet Cas.’
That’s where the good day starts to unravel. As he turns the corner at the end of the road heading towards the dirt track into the woods, a car comes screaming round the corner, swirling wildly. It knocks into Dean and sends him flying. The driver winds down the window and flings some bills at Dean, ‘For your troubles squirrel’ before charging off again. Dean catches the number plate as he looks up in a haze. ‘Crow666’. Douche.
Castiel suddenly seemed to withdraw, staring with great intent at a section of the patterned carpet under his feet.
He took a few steps and rammed his shoulder into the door. The door flung open and Sam was falling… falling…
He’d had the frame of mind to let Dean know he wouldn’t be back last night. Dean’s reply had been a string of increasingly lewd emojis. Six egg plants seemed a little excessive.
The three of them might be separated sometimes, but in the end, all that mattered was that they always ended up back together. They were stronger together than they were apart. And as time and time again they’d proven, Heaven and Hell couldn’t keep them apart.
“It isn’t crazy to me to want you to be happy. I can see from the longing in your eyes when you’re watching those videos just how much you long to serve a group of men like that.”
It sounded so simple put like that. Dean didn't know how to say he'd fallen for someone, fallen hard, and was afraid he might not be able to get up.
Dean's face started to hurt fairly quickly that evening as he slipped into a suit and his familiar press-friendly smile to walk the red carpet.
not! You're not Cher!) broke with fans flocking to see the film that they supposedly fell in love during the shooting of.
The Castiels looked to each other again. Dean felt a shiver down his spine. It was almost like they could all communicate silently, but logically Dean knew it was more like all but Castiel One knew what happened. The Castiels all moved in as one and started to undress Dean.
